<text>Clinidae is a family of marine fish in the order Blenniiformes within the series Ovalentaria, part of the Percomorpha . Temperate blennies, the family ranges from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, in both the Southern and Northern Hemispheres. The family contains about 86 species in 20 genera, the 60-cm-long giant kelpfish (&quot;Heterostichus rostratus&quot;) being the largest; most are far smaller.

With small cycloid scales, clinoid blennies may have a deep or slender build; some members of the family bear the name &quot;snake blenny&quot; and &quot;eel blenny&quot; for this reason. Dorsal spines outnumber soft rays; two spines are in the anal fin. Like many other blennies, clinids possess whisker-like structures on their heads called cirri.

The majority of species possesses rich, highly variable colouration in shades of reddish-brown to olive, often with cryptic patterns; this suits the lifestyle of clinid blennies, which frequent areas of dense weed or kelp. Generally staying within intertidal zones to depths around 40 m, some species are also found in tide pools. Eggs are deposited on kelp for the male to guard. Clinids feed primarily on small crustaceans and mollusks.

The name Clinidae derives from the Greek &quot;klinein&quot; meaning &quot;sloping&quot;, a reference to the shape of the sphenoid bone.

<text>Swamp is a comic strip created by Australian Gary Clark. It was first published in 1981 in the &quot;Sunshine Coast Daily&quot;. According to Clark, the inspiration and model for this strip was the creeks and lagoons in a bushy suburban Brisbane where he grew up in the 1960s. He describes the strip as a &quot;down-to-earth look at a bewildered society thriving in an ever-increasing complex world&quot;.

The popular characters in the comic strip are : Ding Duck, Wart &amp; Mort Frog, Old Man Croc, Bob Crayfish, The Dung Beetles, Air Traffic Controller, The Ants, The Bludgerigar. Ding Duck and the Air Traffic Controller are popular worldwide in aviation circles.

The Swamp characters appear on upscale casual and sportswear especially golf sportswear in Japan and South Korea.

The comic strip is syndicated to newspapers throughout Australia, New Zealand and Europe and translated into seven languages.

Gary Clark has won 14 Stanley Awards for Best Comic Strip Artist of the Year including the inaugural award presented by Prime Minister Bob Hawke. Also, Clark has won 11 Rotary National Cartoon Awards. His company, Swamp Productions Pty Ltd was nominated for export achievement in Arts/Entertainment category in the Premier of Queensland Awards in 1999 for export achievement to Japan.

Early in his cartooning career, Gary Clark created the popular &quot;Diesel Dog&quot; cartoon featured in &quot;Truckin&#x27; Life&quot; magazine in Australia. He relinquished creating &quot;Diesel Dog&quot; cartoons for over 20 years and in 2011 was requested by &quot;Truckin&#x27; Life&quot; to being Diesel&#x27;s creator once again.

<text>The was a small, elite group of swordsmen that was organized by commoners and low rank samurai, commissioned by the (military government) during Japan&#x27;s Bakumatsu period (late Tokugawa shogunate) in 1863. It was active until 1869. It was founded to protect the shogunate representatives in Kyoto at a time when a controversial imperial edict to exclude foreign trade from Japan had been made and the Chōshū clan had been forced from the imperial court. They gained considerable fame in the Ikedaya incident and the August 18 coup events, among others. The men were drawn from the sword schools of Edo.

== History ==

Japan&#x27;s forced opening to the west in 1854, which required it to open its shores for trade or face military conflict, exacerbated internal political instability. One long-standing line of political opinion was (meaning, &quot;revere the emperor, expel the barbarians&quot;). Loyalists (particularly in Chōshū Domain) in Kyoto began to rebel. In response, the Tokugawa shogunate formed the on October 19, 1862. The was a squad of 234 (samurai without masters) drawn from the sword schools of Edo.

The squad&#x27;s nominal commander was the hatamoto Matsudaira Katamori, and their leader was Kiyokawa Hachirō, a from Shōnai Domain. The &#x27;s mission was to protect Tokugawa Iemochi, the 14th , during an important trip to Kyoto to meet with the Emperor Kōmei. There had not been such a meeting since the third of the Tokugawa , Tokugawa Iemitsu, had visited Kyoto in the 17th century. Tokugawa Iemochi, the head of the military government, the , had been invited to discuss how Japan should enact the recent imperial edict calling for the expulsion of foreigners.

Although the was funded by the Tokugawa , the leader Kiyokawa Hachirō and others had strong loyalties to the emperor and planned to gather other in Kyoto to police the city from insurgents. On March 26 (lunar calendar February 8), 1863, Kiyokawa led the out of Edo as the vanguard of Iemochi&#x27;s procession to Kyoto, which they arrived on April 10 (lunar calendar February 23), 1863.
When Kiyokawa&#x27;s scheme was revealed in Kyoto, he immediately commanded the to return to Edo. The members were disbanded and then returned to Edo where they would later form the under the patronage of Shōnai Domain. However, nineteen members, mainly from the Mito clan, remained and formed the .

====Founding members====
Serizawa&#x27;s faction:

* Serizawa Kamo
* Niimi Nishiki
* Hirayama Gorō
* Hirama Jūsuke
* Noguchi Kenji
* Araya Shingorō
* Saeki Matasaburō
Kondō&#x27;s faction:

* Kondō Isami
* Hijikata Toshizō
* Inoue Genzaburō
* Okita Sōji
* Nagakura Shinpachi
* Saitō Hajime
* Harada Sanosuke
* Tōdō Heisuke
* Yamanami Keisuke
Tonouchi&#x27;s faction:

* Tonouchi Yoshio
* Iesato Tsuguo
* Abiru Eisaburō
* Negishi Yūzan
Initially, the were called , meaning &quot; of Mibu&quot;. At the time, Mibu was a village south west of Kyoto, and was the place where they were stationed. was initially formed in three factions under Serizawa (the group), Kondō (the group) and Tonouchi. Abiru Eisaburō later died of illness, a month after arriving in Kyoto.

Internal strife soon developed within the group, Tonouchi was assassinated by Kondō on Yojō bridge, Serizawa had ordered a member, Iesato Tsuguo, to commit for deserting, Negishi Yūzan also deserted and returned to Edo, where he joined the .


Matsudaira Katamori, after the careful evaluation of the political scene in Kyoto, felt it was needed to change the scope of the &#x27;s mission from protecting the shogunate to patrolling the streets of Kyoto and restoring order in the name of the Tokugawa . On August 18, 1863, the was renamed the .

The new name may have been coined by Matsudaira Katamori (the of the Aizu clan) around this time. The opposition forces included the Mori clan of the Chōshū and the Shimazu clan of Satsuma.

The were led by Serizawa Kamo ( 1830, Mino Province), Niimi Nishiki, and Kondō Isami ( 1834, Musashi Province – he came from a small dojo in Edo called ). The submitted a letter to the Aizu clan, another powerful group who supported the Tokugawa regime, requesting permission to police Kyoto. The request was granted.

Saeki Matasaburō, having killed Araya Shingorō, was believed to be killed by a Chōshū samurai Kusaka Genzui on September 22, 1863.

On September 30, 1863 (lunar calendar August 18), the Chōshū (anti-Tokugawa) clan were forced from the imperial court by the Tokugawa, Aizu and Satsuma clans. The were sent to aid the Aizu and guard the gates of the imperial court. The opposition forces included the Mori clan of the Chōshū and the Shimazu clan of Satsuma.

Serizawa&#x27;s erratic and disruptive behavior in Kyoto eventually led to Matsudaira Katamori of Aizu giving the an order to assassinate Serizawa and his group. On October 19, 1863, Niimi Nishiki, a member of the Serizawa faction was forced by Yamanami Keisuke and Hijikata Toshizō to commit seppuku for breaking regulations. On October 30 (or October 28), a few selected members led by Hijikata went into the Yagi Gennojō&#x27;s house and assassinated Serizawa, his woman Oume, and Hirayama Goro, with Hirama Jūsuke being the only survivor who fled that night. All this infighting left Kondō as leader. Three months later, Noguchi Kenji was ordered to commit for an unknown reason.

On July 8, 1864, in an incident at the Ikedaya Inn in Kyoto, thirty suppressed a cell of twenty Chōshū revolutionaries, possibly preventing the burning of Kyoto. The incident made the squad more famous and led to soldiers enlisting in the squad.

===Squad hierarchy after Ikedaya===
* : Kondō Isami, fourth master of the Tennen Rishin-ryū
* : Yamanami Keisuke
* : Hijikata Toshizō
* : Itō Kashitarō
* Spies: Shimada Kai and Yamazaki Susumu.

===Members of the group===
At its peak, the had about 300 members. They were the first samurai group of the Tokugawa era to allow those from non-samurai classes (farmers and merchants, for example) to join. Many joined the group out of a desire to become samurai and be involved in political affairs. However, it is a misconception that most of the members were from non-samurai classes. Out of 106 members (among a total of 302 members at the time), there were 87 samurai, eight farmers, three merchants, three medical doctors, three priests, and two craftsmen. Several of the leaders, such as Sannan, Okita, Saitō, Nagakura, and Harada, were born samurai.

=== regulations===
The code of the , famously created by Hijikata Toshizō, included five articles, prohibiting deviation from the samurai code (), leaving the , raising money privately, taking part in others&#x27; litigation, and engaging in private fights. The penalty for breaking any rule was . In addition, if the leader of a unit was mortally wounded in a fight, all the members of the unit must fight and die on the spot and, even in a fight where the death toll was high, the unit was not allowed to retrieve the bodies of the dead, except the corpse of the leader of the unit.

===Uniform===
The members of the were highly visible in battle due to their distinctive uniforms. Following the orders of the commander Serizawa Kamo, the standard uniform consisted of the and over a kimono, with a white cord called a crossed over the chest and tied in the back. The function of the was to prevent the sleeves of the kimono from interfering with movement of the arms. The wore a light chainmail suit beneath their robes and a light helmet made of iron.

The uniform was best defined by the , which was colored . In the old days of Japan, during the ritual, the samurai committing would wear an . Thus the colour, in the samurai&#x27;s eyes, characterized an honourable death. The sleeves were trimmed with &quot;white mountain stripes&quot;, resulting in a very distinctive uniform.

==Boshin War==
In 1867, when Tokugawa Yoshinobu withdrew from Kyoto, the left peacefully under the supervision of the , Nagai Naoyuki. The new emperor had been named the head of a new government (meaning the end to centuries of military rule by the ). This marked the beginning of the Boshin civil war.

Following their departure from Kyoto, the were one of the shogunate forces fought in the Battle of Toba–Fushimi against the Imperial forces consisting of allied forces of Chōshū, Satsuma and Tosa in January 1868 where Kondō would suffer a gunshot wound at Fushimi during the battle.
The returned to Edo, where it was later reformed into a unit known as the and departed from Edo for Kōfu Castle on March 24 on orders to suppress uprisings there. However, upon receiving news on March 28 that the Kōfu Castle was taken by the Imperial forces led by Itagaki Taisuke, they settled at a town of Katsunuma east of Kōfu.

On March 29, 1868, the resisted an attack by the Imperial forces at the Battle of Kōshū-Katsunuma for about two hours but lost, with eight dead and more than thirty wounded, while the Imperial forces had only one dead and twelve wounded. The surviving members were scattered and retreated to Edo.

Right after the Battle of Kōshū-Katsunuma, Nagakura Shinpachi, Harada Sanosuke and some of the members left the after disagreements with long-time comrades Kondo and Hijikata and later formed a new unit with a former Tokugawa retainer Haga Gidou as its commander.

On April 11, 1868, the departed Edo again and set up a temporary headquarters at the Kaneko family estate, northeast of Edo. They would later move to a new headquarters in Nagareyama on April 25, 1868.

However, on the same day, the Imperial forces&#x27; Staff Officer Kagawa Keizō of Mito Domain received news that an armed unit had set up camp at Nagareyama and dispatched the forces there.

===Death of Kondō Isami===
During their training at Nagareyama on April 26, 1868, the members were caught by surprise by the 200-strong Imperial forces, the Imperial forces&#x27; vice-chief of staff Arima Tota of Satsuma Domain ordered Kondō to go with them to their camp at Koshigaya. Kondō was later brought to Itabashi on April 27 for questioning. Kondō was declared guilty of participation in the assassination of Sakamoto Ryōma on April 30, 1868 and was beheaded three weeks later at the Itabashi execution grounds on May 17, 1868.

===Battle of Aizu===
Due to Hijikata being incapacitated as a result of the injuries sustained at the Battle of Utsunomiya Castle in May 1868, the fought in defense of Aizu territory under Saitō Hajime in the Battle of Shirakawa in June 1868. After the Battle of Bonari Pass in October 1868, when Hijikata decided to retreat from Aizu, Saitō and a small group of parted with Hijikata and continued to fight alongside the Aizu Domain against the Imperial forces until the very end of the Battle of Aizu, where he and a handful of surviving members were apprehended and became the prisoners-of-war.

===Joining with the Republic of Ezo===
In December 1868, Hijikata and the rest of the surviving joined the forces of the Republic of Ezo in the north.

The numbers decreased to around one hundred in this period and they fought on despite the fall of Edo and clear defeat of Tokugawa. In the Battle of Miyako Bay on 6 May 1869, Hijikata led a daring but doomed raid to steal the imperial warship , in the early morning, from the warship, a number of oppositionists, including Nomura Risaburō, managed to board the ship, but were soon mowed down by its Gatling gun. Many others including the captain of were also killed by gunfire from the Imperial ships. The battle lasted only thirty minutes and the survivors and retreated to Hakodate.

On the fourth week of May 1869, Hijikata led 230 Republic of Ezo forces and the surviving against the 600 strong Imperial forces during the Battle of Futamata for sixteen hours and were forced to retreat. The Imperial forces attacked again on the next day, only to retreat. On the following night, Hijikata led a successful raid on the Imperial forces&#x27; camp, forcing them to flee. Hijikata and his forces would later retreat to Hakodate on June 10.

===End of the ===
Hijikata was killed from a gunshot wound on June 20 (lunar calendar May 11), 1869, during the Battle of Hakodate in Hokkaido. Before his death, he wrote of his loyalty to the Tokugawa on the death poem sent by his page Ichimura Tetsunosuke to the house of his brother-in-law:
A remaining group of survivors, under the last commander Sōma Kazue, who had been under Nagai Naoyuki&#x27;s supervision at Benten Daiba, surrendered three days later on June 23, (lunar calendar May 14), 1869, marked the end of the . The forces of the Republic of Ezo would later surrender on June 27, (lunar calendar May 18), 1869, which marked the end of the Boshin War.

A few core members, such as Nagakura Shinpachi, Saitō Hajime, and Shimada Kai survived the war. Some members, such as , went on to become prominent figures.

==Monument==
In 1875, Nagakura Shinpachi, with the help of the physician Matsumoto Ryōjun and several surviving former comrades including Saitō Hajime among others, erected the monument for Kondō Isami, Hijikata Toshizō, and the fallen comrades of the at Jutoku-ji temple boundary known as Graves of in Itabashi, Tokyo and held requiems for their past comrades&#x27; souls.

==In popular culture==
During the Meiji (1868–1912) and Taisho (1912–1926) periods, the Shinsengumi were generally unpopular. At that time, the Japanese considered the Meiji Restoration a great achievement and regarded the current system centered around Satsuma and Choshu as just. Therefore, the Shinsengumi were perceived as a foolish group resisting the Meiji Restoration. This prevailing notion began to change with Kan Shimozawa&#x27;s novel &quot;Shinsengumi Shimatsuki&quot; (1928). Furthermore, after World War II, there was a reevaluation of history among the Japanese. Ryōtarō Shiba&#x27;s novel &quot;Moeyo Ken&quot; (1964) gained popularity, spreading empathy towards the way of life of the Shinsengumi. Today, the Shinsengumi is depicted and beloved by people through various media such as novels, movies, dramas, anime, and more.

<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Ai Yazawa. It was serialized by Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Ribon&quot; from 1995 to 1997, with its chapters collected in seven volumes. The manga has been licensed for English release in North America by Viz Media.

A 50-episode anime television series adaptation, produced by Toei Animation, was broadcast on ABC, TV Asahi and other stations from September 1995 to September 1996. An anime film was released in March 1996.

==Story==
Mikako Kōda is an aspiring fashion designer who attends Yazawa Art Academy in Tokyo and is slowly building up her clothing brand, Happy Berry. Having been childhood friends with her neighbor, Tsutomu Yamaguchi, since infancy, Mikako reassesses her once-platonic feelings for him when he suddenly becomes popular at school due to his resemblance to the singer Ken Nakagawa and begins dating Mariko, a popular and attractive girl.

==Characters==
===Main characters===
:
:Mikako is driven by her dream of becoming a fashion designer and having all the stores sell her handiwork under the brand name &quot;Happy Berry&quot;. Mikako is at her most conspicuous when she is inspired or in a stormy mood for one reason or another. The former earns her the admiration of her classmates while the latter incenses her teacher Ms. Hamada who thinks nothing of keeping her after school to revise her clumsy handiwork. Mikako has a ferocious rivalry with Mariko who she fears will wield Tsutomu to his detriment along with unrealistic expectations of Tsutomu that leads to a very vivacious and adversarial discourse that often inflames matters on many occasions.
:
:Unlike his fiery friend and next-door neighbor Mikako, Tsutomu is somewhat equivocal in regards what he wishes to do with his life as he synthesizes abstract art from odds and ends that he has found here and there but not his feelings about Mikako as his prologue is rife with instances where he has interceded on her behalf or otherwise come to her rescue. Tsutomu follows Mikako&#x27;s lead in forming the street market club Akindo while seeming to operate according to the proverb &quot;Keep moving forward by doing your best in the moment.&quot; Unfortunately, as much of a chivalrous knight as he has been that has long embraced being in love with Mikako, Tsutomu is not perfect. Tsutomu&#x27;s eerie corporeal similarity to the Manbou lead singer Ken Nakagawa from &quot;Tenshi Nanka Ja Nai&quot; has caused several fangirls mistaking him for the musician and fanatically accosting him for an autograph, being given a love letter, or being chased around all over the place. In addition to being frightened of Mikako forcing him to forego the world and the rest of his life, Tsutomu also has a very accommodating »aim to please« personality that affords easy coercion/manipulation (or in Mariko&#x27;s case, seduction). Tsutomu&#x27;s chaotic conduct often frustrates Mikako into prosecuting a fierce adversarial divergent concourse that has led to several impulsive comments about which neither adolescent is really sincere.

===Akindo members===
:
: Mikako&#x27;s best female friend, Risa comes from Hokkaido and her dream is to design children&#x27;s clothes. She lives with her boyfriend Takeshi, a guitarist for a local band, and is Mikako&#x27;s biggest supporter as well as (later in the series) the mother of Arashi whose best friend is George from &quot;Paradise Kiss&quot;.
:
: Also known as P, she is a friend of Mikako and Risa&#x27;s. Mai wears Lolita-style clothing and always carries her stuffed animal Pucci Francois with her. She makes stuffed animals to sell at Akindo and falls for Seiji.
:
: Has purple hair and always wears sunglasses, though Mikako gets to see his eyes during the last volume of the manga. He is close friends with Tsutomu and Yuusuke and is a computer programmer that creates various computer games.
:
: Tsutomu&#x27;s best friend, Yuusuke studies painting at Yazawa (although half-heartedly) and has feelings for Mariko. He is very gruff, but has a good heart and rides a motorcycle.

===Kouda family===
:Miwako is spawned as a result of her parents finally seeing the light in regards to their childish conduct and how it adversely affects Mikako. Miwako does not get to begin her postnatal life until &quot;Paradise Kiss&quot;, whose inception is several years after &quot;Neighborhood Story&quot;.
:
:Although she is Mikako&#x27;s mother, Ruriko often acts more like a co-dependent elder sister than a mother whose irresponsibility forces Mikako to maintain their home life by herself. Ruriko is often seen sleeping the morning away after all-night deadline crunches due to her job as a shoujo manga author.
:
:Considering the conduct he demonstrates with his daughter and the sometimes erratic hours photographers like him are required to keep, Hirohiko&#x27;s divorce from Ruriko when Mikako was young was probably caused by both Hirohiko and Ruriko growing apart because they failed to do the work necessary to maintain their marriage. Fortunately, Hirohiko comes back onto the scene and does the work alongside Ruriko necessary for the two eventually reconcile and remarry. Hirohiko is also a crucial force for Tsutomu deciding what to do with his life.

===Nakasu family===
:
: Nicknamed “Body Ko” for her usual, sultry appearance. She is popular at school and has had many boyfriends, but admits she is tired of dating men who only want her for sex. She is in love with her childhood friend from Yokohama, Shuuichi. After going out with Tsutomu for a short amount of time, she begin a volatile relationship with Yuusuke which lasts for almost the whole length of the series.
:She later marries her Shuuichi, and has a son.
:
: Body Ko&#x27;s little brother, he sculpts dolls and sports dreadlocks (much to Mariko&#x27;s chagrin). He studies ceramics and gives his sister advice, though she does not want to hear it most of the time.

===Other characters===
:
:Ms. Hamada is the strict teacher of the fashion design and sewing lab classes at Yazawa that has no qualms about detaining a student after school for inattentive or clumsy handiwork -- a trap that Mikako often instigates when she is upset for one reason or another. Strangely enough, Mikako is not sent packing by Ms. Hamada&#x27;s abrasive personality or having her handiwork harshly appraised and even goes so far as to identify clumsy textile handiwork that would instigate an after-school detention at Ms. Hamada&#x27;s hands. She was also the professor for Seiji and the cast of &quot;Paradise Kiss&quot;.
:
:Noriji is the old-fashioned but well-intentioned manager of the apartment complex where Mikako and Tsutomu live. It is his good-natured teasing that inspires the epiphany as to the metamorphosis in their mutual feelings that Mikako and Tsutomu undergo throughout the series. Noriji also has a bit of a crush on Ruriko and demonstrates an almost paternal concern when Mikako&#x27;s status is unknown.
:
: Tsutomu&#x27;s classmate who owns the shed where the group creates Akindo&#x27;s headquarters and she creates large, abstract 3-D sculptures. She likes Yuusuke and admires his paintings, but she is jealous of his relationship with Mariko. She later marries Yuusuke (which then makes her Ayumi Toshiro), and she is last seen pregnant with his child.
:
: Owns a bar which is frequented by the characters who live in Mikako&#x27;s apartment complex. Father of (later in the series) Hiroyuki Tokumori from &quot;Paradise Kiss&quot;. Initially considered an &#x27;older-brother&#x27; type figure to Miwako, his role is late replaced by Seiji.
: A “sparkling foreigner” who applies for the job of manga assistant for Mikako&#x27;s mother. He is saving up money to study abroad. He used to go to Yazawa for fashion, but dropped out when he realized that his passion was in hairstyling. He becomes a close friend of Mikako&#x27;s and appears in &quot;Paradise Kiss&quot;.
: Mariko&#x27;s childhood friend from Yokohama. He has a girlfriend when first introduced. He later breaks up with her, and the series ends with Mariko and him married, with a son.

<text>Zokors are Asiatic burrowing rodents resembling mole-rats. They include two genera: &quot;Myospalax&quot; and &quot;Eospalax&quot;. Zokors are native to much of China, Kazakhstan, and Siberian Russia.

Traditionally, zokors were thought to be closely related to either hamsters (Cricetinae) or voles (Arvicolinae), but recent molecular phylogenetic studies have demonstrated they are more closely related to blind mole-rats (Spalacinae) and root and bamboo rats (Rhizomyinae) in the family Spalacidae. It appears that one of the first important evolutionary splits in muroid rodents is between burrowing forms and nonburrowing forms.

Unlike the other spalacids, which primarily use their incisors, zokors use their powerful front claws for digging. They have small eyes and no external ears. Zokors feed on plant matter such as tubers and seeds.

<doc id="495558" wikidata="Q781476" url="?curid=495558" title="Nicolae Titulescu">
<text>Nicolae Titulescu (; 4 March 1882 – 17 March 1941) was a Romanian politician and diplomat, at various times ambassador, finance minister, and foreign minister, and for two terms president of the General Assembly of the League of Nations (1930–32).

==Early years==
Nicolae Titulescu was born on 4 March 1882 in Craiova, the son of a solicitor. He grew up at his father&#x27;s estate in Titulești, a commune in Romania that was later named after him. Upon graduating with honours in 1900 from the Carol I High School in Craiova, Titulescu studied law in Paris, obtaining his doctorate with the thesis &quot;Essai sur une théorie des droits éventuels&quot;. In 1905, Titulescu returned to Romania as a professor of law at the University of Iași, and in 1907 he moved to Bucharest.

==Political career==

Following the Romanian elections of 1912, Titulescu became a parliamentarian with the Conservative-Democratic Party led by Take Ionescu, and five years later he became a member of the government of Ion I. C. Brătianu as Minister of Finance.

In the summer of 1918, together with other prominent Romanians (Take Ionescu, Octavian Goga, Traian Vuia, Constantin Mille), Titulescu formed, in Paris, the National Romanian Committee, with the purpose of promoting in international public opinion the right of the Romanian people to national unity, the committee being officially recognised as the plenipotentiary &quot;de facto&quot; organ of the Romanian nation.

After the war, Titulescu was finance minister in the second Averescu government in 1920-21. He was then appointed Romanian Ambassador to the United Kingdom, a position he held on-and-off until 1936.

Beginning in 1921, Titulescu functioned as the permanent representative of Romania to the League of Nations in Geneva. He was chosen twice (in 1930 and 1931) to be the president of the General Assembly of that organization. In this capacity, he fought for the preservation of stable borders through the maintenance of peace, for good relations between both large and small neighboring states, for the respect of the sovereignty and equality of all nations in the international community, for collective security, and the prevention of aggression.
In June 1936, Titulescu reacted to the buffoonery exhibited by the Italian journalists when Emperor Haile Selassie I spoke to the League after Ethiopia had been invaded and occupied by Fascist Italy. He jumped to his feet and shouted: &quot;To the door with the savages!&quot; (&quot;A la porte les sauvages!&quot;). Patrick Leigh Fermor described him as &quot;tall and mandarin-like, but with splendid histrionic gestures, and obviously a comic genius of the first order&quot;.

From 1927 to 1928, Titulescu was the minister of foreign affairs, a post he held again from 1932-36. After an initial period of skepticism, he concluded that Romania needed an alliance with the Soviet Union, and he conducted many negotiations with Commissar for Foreign Affairs Maxim Litvinov. These failed due to lack of support from king Carol II and other Romanian political leaders.

In 1935, Titulescu was elected a titular member of the Romanian Academy.

==Exile and death==
In August 1936, King Carol II removed Titulescu from all official positions, asking him to leave the country. Settling first in Switzerland, he later moved to France. In exile, he continued in conferences and newspaper articles to propagate the idea of the preservation of peace, as he perceived the danger of the approaching war. He returned to Romania in November 1937, partly by the efforts of Iuliu Maniu.

In 1937, Titulescu again left Romania and took refuge in France. At Cannes, he denounced the Romanian fascist regime. On 17 March 1941, Titulescu died in Cannes, France following a long illness. In his will, he asked to be buried in Romania.

In 1989, after the fall of communist Romania during the Romanian Revolution, the honouring of Titulescu&#x27;s request became possible. On 14 March 1992, his remains were reburied in the Sfânta Ecaterina cemetery in Șcheii Brașovului, next to St. Nicholas Church, Brașov after a difficult legal procedure organized by Jean-Paul Carteron, a French attorney. He was awarded Order of the White Eagle and other decorations.

<text>The Blue Water Bridge is a twin-span international bridge across the St. Clair River that links Port Huron, Michigan, United States, and Point Edward, Ontario, Canada. The Blue Water Bridge connects Highway 402 in Ontario with both Interstate 69 (I-69) and Interstate 94 (I-94) in Michigan.

==Description==
The original span is a cantilever truss bridge with a total length of and a main span of . The second, newer span is a continuous bowstring arch bridge with a total length of and a main span of .

The Blue Water Bridges are jointly owned and maintained by Canada and the United States: Federal Bridge Corporation, a Crown corporation of the Government of Canada, is in charge of the Canadian side, while the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) is in charge of the US side. A toll is charged to cross the bridges, which is used to pay for maintenance and operations.

Together, the two bridges connect Chicago and the Midwestern United States with Toronto and the Northeastern United States, one of the four shortest routes of land travel between the US Midwest and Northeast. They are the second-busiest commercial crossing on the Canada–United States border, after the Ambassador Bridge at Detroit-Windsor, and the fourth-busiest overall international crossing in Ontario in terms of total number of vehicles at 4.7 million annually . In Canada, they are the third-busiest bridges after the Champlain Bridge in Montreal and the Ambassador Bridge.

==Border crossing==

The Port Huron–Point Edward Border Crossing connects the cities of Port Huron, Michigan, and Point Edward, Ontario, at the Blue Water Bridge. Both the US and Canada border stations are open 24 hours per day. The US Customs and Border Protection upgraded its inspection facilities in 2011, and Canada Border Services Agency upgraded its facilities in 2012. In 2017, inspectors at Port Huron processed 1,579,646 cars and 826,288 trucks.

==History==
===Background===
A US Port of Entry was established at the location in 1836, when a license to provide commercial ferry service between Port Huron and what then was known as Port Sarnia. The license was issued to a Canadian man named Crampton who operated a sailboat. In the 1840s, a man named Davenport, also from Port Sarnia, operated a pony-powered vessel. Steam-powered vessels and paddle wheelers soon followed, but the first vessel capable of carrying automobiles did not arrive until 1921.

===Planning and opening===
In 1935, the Michigan Legislature passed a law (Public Act 147 of 1935) creating a State Bridge Commission to finance the design and erection of the main bridge structure of the Blue Water Bridge. In 1937, after plans proposed in 1927 to build a bridge spanning the St. Clair River languished during the Great Depression, the Michigan Highway Commission and the Minister of Highways for Canada hired Ralph Modjeski and Frank H. Masters and their Canadian associates, Charles Monsarrat and Philip Louis Pratley to design and build what would become the Blue Water Bridge. Ralph Modjeski, a Polish-born engineer who would become known as &quot;America&#x27;s greatest bridge builder&quot;, served as lead engineer for the project. In developing a design, Modjeski faced obstacles posed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which sought to ensure that the St. Clair River remain navigable for military and commercial vessels. Bridge construction could not interfere with navigation, bridge builders could not use floating platforms, and the completed span was required to clear the water by .

Originally, Modjeski proposed a mammoth suspension-style bridge with tall towers and massive cable anchorages; however, because of the vertical clearance requirement for shipping, he opted instead for a cantilevered through-truss design. The commission was approved by the United States Congress in August 1935 (Public Law 411 of 1935). The law permitted the commission to sell bonds that would be repaid by the revenue from the tolls ($0.25 toll for travelers) collected within 30 years. The first bridge was fully opened to traffic on October 10, 1938. The lead engineer was Polish-born Ralph Modjeski. This bridge originally had two lanes for vehicles as well as sidewalks.

In the 1950s, the facilities were upgraded, and the bridge’s lighting was completely replaced.

Both the U.S. and Canadian governments had agreed to operate the bridge toll-free once bonds were paid off. The U.S. side of the bridge became toll-free in February 1962, after the Governor John Swainson used an executive order to cancel the toll. This forced layoffs of the toll workers, one of which was his father. In August 1962, the BWB Authority (BWBA) that operates the Canadian side of the bridge began collecting tolls of $0.25 from eastbound traffic while continuing to collect tolls from westbound traffic. In June 1963, the State of Michigan appropriated funds for the operation of its part of the bridge.

In 1964, the eastern terminus of I-94 was completed at the foot of the Blue Water Bridge on the American side.

With the passage of the Executive Reorganization Act of 1965, the State Bridge Commission was abolished and its functions were transferred to the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) , then called the Department of State Highways.

In 1970, the U.S. Congress passed a law permitting Michigan to again collect tolls on the bridge. To comply with the law, the department had to repay the federal government $348,000 for the grant it received in 1938, which funded the approach road. That grant was repaid to the federal government and in September 1971, tolls were restored, however only collected in the eastbound direction on the Michigan side.

In 1982, Highway 402 was completed, and the Canadian approach had already been modified. This provided a continuous freeway link to Highway 401 on the Canadian side. Around this time, the bridge&#x27;s sidewalk was also removed; this was done to add a third Reversible lane on the roadway, as long lineups on each side&#x27;s crossing were common.

In 1984, I-69 was completed to Port Huron which meant that three freeways converged on the three-lane bridge.

===Twinning in 1990s===
In 1985, the U.S. Congress allowed Michigan to increase the toll to create a state matching fund for proposed improvements to the bridge plaza. As a requirement for this authority, after the bonds for repayment of construction costs were retired, the tolls had to be reverted to levels sufficient to operate and maintain the structure and associated facilities. In July 1991, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) signed a &quot;129A Agreement&quot; with MDOT regarding the disposition of toll receipts. This agreement allowed the department to fund both the annual operating costs of the bridge and the state&#x27;s matching share of the BWB Plaza Improvement Project. On the American side, the I-beam girder overpass crossing Pine Grove Avenue was replaced by a much wider embankment, which also added a four-story customs office building in the center. On the Canadian side, the original booths were demolished; they had been in use since 1938; while they were positively noted for their Art Deco style, they were too low to accommodate modern semi-trailer trucks which previously had to be directed to the outside. The $55 million plaza improvement project was completed in November 1996, at which the toll was reverted back to its original cost.

In 1992, it was determined that traffic on the bridge had exceeded its rated capacity, so bridge authorities decided to add a second span in order to accommodate the higher traffic. 

During the debate over the form of the second span from 1994 to 1995, five possible designs were proposed. The parallel chord truss Bridge and the single-span tied-arch bridge proposals were the least popular as they were not visually appealing and dropped from further consideration. Over half of public opinion had favored a duplicate of the first bridge, while the cable-stayed bridge came in second with around 21% thanks to its &quot;dramatic appearance and appeal to engineers because of their high structural redundancy&quot;. The Blue Water Bridge Authority had rejected both designs that topped public opinion, because the duplicate bridge would create a false sense of history, while the cable-stayed design would overshadow the existing bridge in height and proportion. The continuous-tied arch design, which was a distant third place in polls, was chosen for two reasons: one was that it blends in with the original span yet stands out on its own, and the other is lower maintenance costs because fewer spans are involved. The selection of the continuous-tied arch proposal was initially controversial as it did not have much public opinion support, and critics regarded this type as awkward. Consequently, the engineers changed design details to make it complement the existing bridge. For instance, the use of concrete piers and steel tower supporting the anchor span, rather than the traditional concrete tower, gave the bridge a &quot;less massive appearance, easing the difficult transition between the approach, anchor and main spans&quot;.

The engineers also made &quot;the main span attractive, but economical by settling on an innovative low arch design that merges the traffic deck with the bottom structural supporting steel for the portion of the bridge suspended over the water&quot;, which &quot;eliminated the need for expensive bracing and contributes to the graceful appearance of the structure&quot;, while the flattened arch also better matches the old bridge. For the new bridge approaches the engineers selected concrete hammer-head piers over steel piers and deck trusses, not only for economical considerations, but it also &quot;gives the new bridge a simpler look, making it easier to distinguish the old bridge from the new one&quot; and &quot;contributes to the clean lines of the new bridge and leaves the view of the old bridge&#x27;s deck trusses uncluttered&quot;. Due to each country&#x27;s manufacturing differences, the Americans used large pre-cast concrete beams (six beams for each segment) for the approaches while the Canadians used concrete pre-cast box girders (three box girders per segment). Despite this, the differing approach spans are the same depth and appear identical from the side view. 

The twinning project was a combined effort between Modjeski &amp; Masters (American engineers) and Buckland &amp; Taylor Ltd. (Canadian engineers). During the construction, two temporary masts were erected to assist in the construction of the tied arch; the towers were painted red and lighted, enabling them to be seen from afar. The approaches to the new bridge use box girders, compared to the original which hold up the road deck with trusses. The second three-lane bridge, just south of the first bridge, opened on July 22, 1997. After the new bridge opened for traffic it served both directions from 1997 to 1999, with a flyover ramp on the Michigan side to temporarily direct westbound traffic to the north of the U.S. toll plaza, while the original bridge was closed for replacement of the bridge deck, guardrail, and lighting, the latter two aspects being the same/similar to the new bridge. Upon reopening, the original bridge was re-stripped with three westbound lanes, while the flyover ramp was closed off as the new bridge exclusively carried three eastbound lanes.

===Recent developments===
In 2007, in accordance with Federal Identity Program requirements, the Blue Water Bridge Authority agreed on a name for the federal Crown corporate organization: Blue Water Bridge Canada.

In March 2009, the Canadian government announced that C$13.5 million (US$10.8 million) in funding would be allocated toward upgrading the border crossing facilities at the Blue Water Bridge. The work was scheduled to begin in May 2009. The US Customs and Border Protection would upgrade it on the US side, and the Canada Border Services Agency would upgrade it on the Canadian side. In 2011, the US side completed its plaza upgrades, and construction began to widen and improve both Highway 402 on the Canadian side and I-94/I-69 on the American side. In 2012, both the widening and the Canadian border upgrades were completed.

On April 1, 2015, the westbound span was closed to undergo resurfacing and waterproofing.

In 2018, the piers of the westbound bridge had protectors installed, additionally, new gusset plates were built.

On July 5, 2023, the westbound bridge was closed for blast cleaning, deck repairs, and other minor rehab work. It was reopened on October 3rd, 2 days ahead of schedule.

In 2020, cash was banned after the COVID-19 pandemic. It was made permanent by January 1, 2024.

Starting on May 29, 2024, the eastbound bridge was closed for maintenance, and all traffic was shifted onto the westbound bridge.

<text>Severodvinsk (; ) is a city in the north of Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russia, located in the delta of the Northern Dvina, west of Arkhangelsk, the administrative center of the oblast. As of the 2021 Census, the population was 157,213. Due to the presence of important military shipyards (specialising in submarines since the Soviet period), Severodvinsk is an access-restricted town for foreign citizens. A special permit is required.

It was previously known as Sudostroy (until 1938), and Molotovsk (until 1957).

==History==
=== Pre-20th century ===
Vikings explored the territories around the North Dvina River - part of Bjarmaland - at the start of the second millennium. British and Norman ships came to these places for mining, fur and fishing before the 13th century, but later the climate became colder and access to the northern seas became closed.

The historical records first mention the settlement on the site of modern Severodvinsk in 1419, when the Swedes sailed into the bay and burnt down the Nikolo-Korelsky Monastery that stood by the shore during the Swedish–Novgorodian Wars. Tradition has it that Saint Euphemius, an Orthodox missionary in Karelia, founded this monastery. The abbey stood in ruins until 1471, when two sons of Marfa Boretskaya died in a vicious storm; their bodies were recovered on the beach near the monastery twelve days later. At the urging of Boretskaya, the monastery was restored and her sons were buried there.

On August 24, 1553, a ship of Richard Chancellor reached the salt-mining settlement of Nyonoksa, which is still famous for its traditional wooden architecture. The British sailors visited the Nikolo-Korelsky Monastery, where they were surprised to find a community of &quot;sailors in soutanes (cassocks)&quot; and a pier large enough to accommodate several ships. The main church of this extraordinary establishment was dedicated to Saint Nicholas, the holy patron of sailors; hence, the whole White Sea became known in 16th-century English maps as &quot;St. Nicholas Bay&quot;. In late 1613, during the Time of Troubles in Russia, Polish-Lithuanian vagabonds, the Lisowczycy, captured and looted Severodvinsk with the monastery.

The Nikolo-Korelsky Monastery flourished after the establishment of the Muscovy Company, as the bulk of their trade passed through the local harbor. In August 1618 the harbour was visited by John Tradescant the elder, who conducted a survey of an island situated opposite the monastery. This island became known to the British as &quot;Rose Island&quot;, because it was there that Tradescant found an exceedingly rare plant which he named &quot;Rosa moscovita&quot; (which is now known as &quot;Rosa acicularis&quot;) and brought back to London.
The surviving buildings of the monastery were constructed at the close of the Muscovite period. The five-domed cathedral of St. Nicholas was built between 1670 and 1674, preceded by the Assumption church (1664–1667), to which it is joined by a gallery. Several decades later, the walls and towers were built of timber; the Soviets transported the best-preserved of these towers to Kolomenskoye, Moscow, where it still remains.

===Modern city===
Severodvinsk is the second-largest city in Arkhangelsk Oblast. Its main industry remains defense-related — the construction and repair of submarines at the huge Northern Machine-building Enterprise SEVMASH (Северное Машиностроительное Предприятие-СЕВМАШ). The Soviet Union&#x27;s first nuclear submarine &quot;Leninsky Komsomol&quot; was built here in 1957. At the beginning of the 1980s, the world&#x27;s largest submarine, a Typhoon class, was also built here, later recorded in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;.

The modern city of Severodvinsk developed in the Soviet period. As it began to be built it was called Sudostroy ( - &quot;Boat-build&quot;). It received town status in 1938; until 1957, it was named Molotovsk (), after Vyacheslav Molotov. On September 12, 1957, it was renamed Severodvinsk (meaning &quot;Northern Dvina town&quot;).

During World War II, a significant portion of the materials delivered by the Arctic Convoys to Murmansk and Arkhangelsk for the Soviet Union were unloaded in Severodvinsk. For example, the &quot;Empire Elgar&quot;, a British heavy lift ship that arrived in Arkhangelsk with convoy PQ 16 and subsequently spent eight weeks unloading ships from the ill-fated convoy PQ 17.

A Russian naval-base supports the sea trials of nuclear submarines from the major submarine construction- (64.5817 N, 39.8307 E) and repair-facilities located in the area. In Soviet times, the 17th-century buildings of the Nikolo-Korelsky monastery, located on the territory of the shipyard, were adapted and used for shipbuilding purposes. In recent years, the monastery buildings, specifically the main church, have been restored and re-consecrated. Church-goers attending services have to be shipyard workers or able to obtain a pass to enter the church portion of the shipyard.

Severodvinsk is an access-restricted town for foreign citizens. A special pass is required.

On 8 August 2019, a nuclear accident took place on Russian Navy&#x27;s Central Missile Range in Nyonoksa, 30 km to the west from Severodvinsk.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with eleven rural localities, incorporated as the city of oblast significance of Severodvinsk—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the city of oblast significance of Severodvinsk is incorporated as Severodvinsk Urban Okrug.

==Demographics==
Population: 
From 1950 until 1990, high-tech industries generated demand for a considerable quantity of suitably qualified experts and workers which prompted growth in population. Since 1992, the population has declined due to economic crises and unemployment that has provoked significant migration from the city.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
The city is located near the Nikolsky mouth of the Northern Dvina at its confluence with the White Sea, 35 km northwest of Arkhangelsk, administrative centre of the region.

The area of Severodvinsk Urban Okrug, which includes the city of Severodvinsk and nearby rural settlements, is , which is more than the area of Moscow within the MKAD. It is due to the fact that in addition to the city of Severodvinsk a large forest area with its settlements (villages and dachas) to the south and west of the city is included in the boundaries of Severodvinsk Urban Okrug itself. The area of the city within the city limits is .

The city is located at a latitude of 64°34′N, which means that it is possible to observe the northern lights.

=== Climate ===
Climate in Severodvinsk is subarctic according to the Köppen climate classification. Summers are cool and winters are very cold. The average winter temperature is lower than in the central, southern and even some northern (such as Saint-Petersburg) regions of the European part of Russia. In december the Sun rises after 9 am and sets before 4 pm. But from May 17 to July 27 white nights are observed in the city.

==Economy==

===Industry===

The main role of the city has been, and remains, the production and repair of submarines and military ships. During the Cold War, the city prospered, but with the decline and break-up of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War the city has declined. The city&#x27;s large military enterprises have survived the economic crises of the 1990s and have adjusted to new economic conditions. Severodvinsk now has the largest shipbuilding yard in Russia for large ships (tankers, cargo ships).

<doc id="495574" wikidata="Q7555946" url="?curid=495574" title="Solar Pyramid">
<text>The Solar Pyramid was a proposed sculpture originally scheduled to open in June 2003 in the United Kingdom. The pyramid was to have been the UK&#x27;s largest sculpture, the world&#x27;s biggest functioning timepiece, and the world&#x27;s largest sundial. The sculpture, originally planned for a site in Derbyshire, and later one in Dorset, failed to attract sufficient finance or public support to be constructed.

The design consisted of three towers, or gnomons, which leaned together to create an illusion of a pyramid.

==Design==
According to the project&#x27;s website the pyramid was to comprise &quot;three highly polished stainless steel leaning blade-like towers, which cast a shadow onto an enormous elliptical sundial base, telling the date and time&quot;. The towers would not meet at the apex, but create &quot;a shifting illusion of a pyramidal structure&quot;.

The towers were to be clad in &quot;reflective, mirror polished and green-coloured, stainless steel&quot; to reflect light and capture movement. One tower was to have &quot;a locational latitude of 53.25 degrees and is orientated due south to function in a similar, but more scientifically sophisticated manner, to that of the gnomon of an immense sundial&quot;. The tower would cast a shadow on a sixty-metre elliptical base. The remaining towers were to be aligned to the extremes of sunrise and sunset.

==Derbyshire site==
In 2002, it was announced that construction of the sculpture, designed by Richard Swain and Adam Walkden would be commenced at Poolsbrook, near Chesterfield, Derbyshire. A scale model of the sculpture was exhibited at the Royal Observatory Greenwich. The site, near the M1 Motorway, was to be visible to 45,000 motorists an hour. Completion was expected by June 2003. Eventually, work on the foundations commenced in January 2004, and it was announced that it was expected to have the sculpture in place by the time of the Autumn Equinox on 22 September of that year. By December 2005, there was little progress, with a completion date of Summer 2006 given.

By September 2007, work had still not started, mainly due to financial problems. It was hoped that construction would finally begin in Spring of the following year, with completion about nine months later. However, in November 2007, the Derbyshire site was abandoned. Instead, it was decided to build a sculpture near Poole in Dorset.

==&quot;Moments in Time&quot;==
In February 2006, the &quot;Solar Pyramid&quot; website began the sale of &quot;Moments in Time&quot; to the public. For £49.75 the purchaser received a certificate of ownership of &quot;a chosen one-minute slot at a date and time that carries special significance for them&quot;. A numbered plaque marking the minute would also be affixed to the floor of the planned sundial.

==Dorset site==
Negotiations with Poole Borough Council began in November 2007. The project had the support of Poole Tourism Partnership. The scheme for the sculpture was opened to public consultation in December 2007, but the response was overwhelmingly negative. In January 2008, Poole Borough Council announced they would not be going ahead, partly due to &quot;unanswered questions about adequate funding&quot;. The council&#x27;s leader issued a statement explaining the decision:

&quot;...no taxpayers&#x27; money will be invested in the delivery of this proposal and at this stage, Solar Pyramid Ltd has not been able to provide the necessary evidence of costs and funding for the Council to proceed with the assessment work with sufficient confidence. I will therefore be instructing the Council&#x27;s Chief Executive to make arrangements to withdraw from discussions with Solar Pyramid Ltd.&quot;
All references to Poole were quickly removed from the project website.

==Winding up of company==
According to documents lodged with the Registrar of Companies, the directors of the company resigned and an application for a voluntary striking off the register was made in June 2009. The final notice indicating that the company had been voluntarily dissolved appeared in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; in September 2009.

<doc id="495585" wikidata="Q7676670" url="?curid=495585" title="The Man Who Stole the Sun">
<text>is a 1979 Japanese thriller film, directed by Hasegawa Kazuhiko.

==Plot==
Makoto Kido, a high school science and chemistry teacher, has decided to build his own atomic bomb. Before stealing plutonium isotopes from Tōkai Nuclear Power Plant, he is involved in the botched hijack of one of his school&#x27;s buses during a field trip. Along with a police detective, Yamashita, he is able to overcome the hijacker and is publicly hailed as a hero.

Meanwhile, Makoto is able to extract enough plutonium from his stolen isotopes to create two bombs—one genuine, the other containing only enough radioactive material to be detectable, but otherwise a fake. He plants the fake bomb in a public lavatory and phones the police and demands that Yamashita take the case. Since Makoto speaks to the police through a voice scrambler, Yamashita is unaware that Makoto is behind the whole thing.

Makoto manages to extort the government into showing baseball games without cutting away for commercials. Flush with success, he follows a suggestion by a radio personality, nicknamed &quot;Zero&quot;, to use the real bomb to extort the government into allowing the Rolling Stones to play in Japan (despite being barred from doing so due to Keith Richards being arrested for narcotics possession). The request is soon granted and the band eventually plays in Tokyo.

As Makoto makes his way to the concert with the bomb, Yamashita follows him. Makoto pulls out a gun and forces Yamashita to a rooftop. Makoto reveals that he was the extortionist, and gets into a fight with Yamashita. Eventually the two fall from the roof whilst Makoto holds on to the bomb. He is saved by grabbing on to a power line as Yamashita falls to his death. Still in possession of the bomb, Makoto decides to leave. As he walks away, a ticking sound, then an explosion is heard.

<doc id="495589" wikidata="Q3246424" url="?curid=495589" title="Battle of the bands">
<text>A battle of the bands is a music contest or competition in which a number of bands compete for the title of &quot;best band&quot;. The winner is determined by a voice vote of the audience or the band who brings the most people to support them. Traditionally, battles of bands are held at live music events and forums. Popular examples include the yearly Live and Unsigned contest in the United Kingdom and the annual SoundWave Music Competition.

==Format==
A battle of the bands is a contest in which many bands, usually rock or metal bands, but often musical acts from a range of different styles, compete for the title of &quot;best band&quot;. Its history though goes back to earlier times, at least the 1930s swing era, when big band battles between famous band leaders like Chick Webb, Casa Loma Orchestra, Benny Goodman and Count Basie were regularly organised in big dancehalls, like the Savoy Ballroom. The winner is determined by a panel of judges, the general response of the audience, or a combination. The winning band usually receives a prize in addition to bragging rights. Prizes usually include cash, free recording time in a local recording studio, support or main slot at a local or large gig, a piece of new equipment, or a gift certificate. For instance, the band Phish won a battle of the bands competition in 1989 in their hometown of Burlington, Vermont, and won recording time at a local studio, which they used to record their second album &quot;Lawn Boy&quot;.

Battles of bands are sometimes held as part of a live music event; they are also commonly held at high schools and universities. The term &quot;Battle of the Bands&quot; is a trademark in Canada, held since 1998 by the Toronto promotions company Supernova Interactive.

==Historical events==
In the United States one of the oldest rows of a battle of the bands talent show has been hosted by the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, the first time in 1959. The annual contest was meant to showcase teenage musicians and singers, the participants were either independent or associated with high schools and competed in several divisions like school band, vocal group, vocalist and combo. Auditions were being held early in the year, preliminary contests in spring and the finals in the Bowl in the summer. Two later famous musicians that have performed at the Hollywood Bowl Battle were Karen and Richard Carpenter in 1966 (winner in combo and sweepstake).

One of the best-known battle of the bands competitions in the United States was the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Rumble, held by the Boston rock radio station WBCN. The competition was held by the station from 1979 until its closure in 2009, and was then subsequently operated by an independent group. Several winners and participants became nationally popular after appearing in the competition, including Mission of Burma (1979 participant), &#x27;Til Tuesday (1983 winner), The Lemonheads (1988 participant), Letters to Cleo, Morphine, Powerman 5000 (all 1992 participants), The Amazing Royal Crowns (1997 winner) and The Dresden Dolls (2003 winner).

The simultaneous release of albums and singles in 1995 sparked a media-fuelled &quot;Battle of Britpop&quot; between northern England&#x27;s working-class Oasis and southern England&#x27;s middle-class Blur. Also in the United Kingdom, the largest annual music contest in a battle of the bands format is Live and Unsigned, which has been operating since 2007. The contest regularly draws 10,000 participants, with the grand prize of a £50,000 recording deal.

==In popular culture==
A battle of the bands event forms the climax of a number of films, including &quot;Up in Smoke&quot; (1978), &quot;Cotton Candy&quot; (1978), &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; (2003), &quot;School of Rock&quot; (2003),&quot; Metal Lords &quot; (2022), &quot;Bandslam&quot; (2009), &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Bogus Journey&quot; (1991) and &quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot; (1998). In the horror thriller film &quot;House at the End of the Street&quot; (2011), starring Jennifer Lawrence, there are scenes resembling battle of the bands.

In the mid-1960s, battle of the bands events became popular in Texas. The Catacombs, a popular Houston rock nightclub in what is now the Uptown area of Houston, hosted many well known groups of the era including Grateful Dead, Jethro Tull, The Jeff Beck Group and The Mothers of Invention. Dallas, Austin and San Antonio were also popular venues.

In 1968, California rock band The Turtles released a concept album, &quot;The Turtles Present the Battle of the Bands&quot;, with the band playing in different styles from psychedelic to surf music to bluegrass.

In the &quot;Take That&quot; musical &quot;Never Forget&quot;, the show centres on a tribute band working to win the &quot;Battle of the Tribute Bands&quot;.

Third World Games have produced a &quot;Battle of the Bands&quot; card game, which takes a tongue-in-cheek look at the music business. The object is to recruit members into your band, equip them with instruments, win &quot;gigs&quot; and &quot;hit singles&quot; and earn enough &quot;Superstar Points&quot; to win. The game is also available for play on GameTable Online. There is also a &quot;Battle of the Bands&quot; video game and TV movie. In the music video game &quot;Guitar Hero World Tour&quot; and all games that followed, a &quot;battle of the bands&quot; mode is featured as an online gameplay mode.

The &quot;battle of the bands&quot; concept has had a heavy influence on reality television. Shows such as the Idol series and &quot;The X Factor&quot; borrow the basic concept of a &quot;battle of the bands&quot; except with individual singers instead of whole bands, combining the concept with a serial elimination format. There was a brief American series in the vein, &quot;The Next Great American Band&quot;, that did use whole bands. The former South African competition Rockspaaider followed a battle of the bands format, where rock-bands from all over the country are given the chance to compete for the title &quot;Rockspaaider&quot; and a recording contract. Along with the introduction of the Afrikaans music channel MK, the competition resulted in the resurgence of the Afrikaans music industry, especially the rise of Afrikaans Rock.

In the comedy film &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Bogus Journey&quot; (1991), Bill and Ted&#x27;s band Wyld Stallyns competes in and wins a battle of the bands performing &quot;God Gave Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll to You II&quot;. California rock band Primus makes a cameo appearance as rival contestants performing &quot;Tommy the Cat&quot;.

In the comedy film &quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot; (1998), The Blues Brothers Band and The Louisiana Gator Boys compete against each other in a battle of the bands. The Louisiana Gator Boys wins the Battle, and Elwood Blues suggests that the two bands perform together on stage, which they do.

The comedy-drama film &quot;Drumline&quot; (2002) features a battle of the bands with several historically black collegiate marching bands.

In the comedy film &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; (2003), Anna Coleman&#x27;s band Pink Slip enters a battle of the bands at the House of Blues before they perform at her parents&#x27; wedding.

In the comedy film &quot;School of Rock&quot; (2003), Dewey Finn enters a battle of the bands with his students. It happens in the musical and television adaptation of the same name.

In the video game &quot;Rhythm Heaven&quot; (2008), there is a battle of the bands gamemode. It is similar to the Rockers mini-game, but with songs from other mini games, except That One Song, which is the Rockers 2 song. Drummer Duel (also from the DS game) serves a similar purpose. The Live feature from &quot;Rhythm Tengoku&quot; serves as a predecessor to this, as it is similar in concept.

The 2010 comic book adaptation film &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&quot; features several Battles of the Bands that culminate in actual physical fights.

In the Australian thriller film &quot;Swerve&quot; (2011), a battle of the marching bands serves as background to most of the scenes set in the small country town.

In the animated film &quot;My Little Pony: Equestria Girls – Rainbow Rocks&quot; (2014), a trio of banished sirens from Equestria arrive at Canterlot High School and quickly transform the school&#x27;s upcoming musical showcase into a battle of the bands in order to feed on the negative energy created by pitting groups against each other.

<doc id="495591" wikidata="Q1107563" url="?curid=495591" title="Cola wars">
<text>The Cola wars are the long-time rivalry between soft drink producers The Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo, who have engaged in mutually-targeted marketing campaigns for the direct competition between each company&#x27;s product lines, especially their flagship colas, Coca-Cola and Pepsi. Beginning in the late 1970s and into the 1980s, the competition escalated until it became known as the cola wars.

==History==
In 1886, John Stith Pemberton, a pharmacist from Atlanta, Georgia, developed the original recipe for Coca-Cola. By 1888, control of the recipe was acquired by Asa Griggs Candler, who in 1896, founded The Coca-Cola Company.
Two years later in 1898 in
New Bern, North Carolina
, Caleb Bradham renamed his &quot;Brad&#x27;s Drink&quot; to &quot;Pepsi-Cola,&quot; and formed the Pepsi-Cola Company in 1902, prompting the beginning of the cola wars. 

The two companies continued to introduce new and contemporary advertising techniques, such as Coke&#x27;s first celebrity endorsement and 1915 contour bottle, until market instability following World War I forced Pepsi to declare bankruptcy in 1923. In 1931, Pepsi went bankrupt once more, but recovered and began selling its products at an affordable 5 cents per bottle, reigniting the cola wars through to today. Pepsi offered to sell out to Coca-Cola following both of its bankruptcies during this time, but Coca-Cola declined each time.

==Advertising strategies==
===Coca-Cola===
Coca-Cola advertising has historically focused on wholesomeness and nostalgia. Coca-Cola advertising is often characterized as &quot;family-friendly&quot; and often relies on &quot;cute&quot; characters (e.g., the Coca-Cola polar bears mascot and Santa Claus around Christmas).

====&quot;New Coke&quot;====
During the peak of the cola wars, as Coca-Cola saw its flagship product losing market share to Pepsi as well as to Diet Coke and competitors&#x27; products, the company considered a change to the beverage&#x27;s formula and flavor. In April 1985, The Coca-Cola Company introduced its new formula for Coca-Cola, which became popularly known as &quot;New Coke&quot;. Consumer backlash to the change led to the company making a strategic retreat on July 11, 1985, announcing its plans to bring back the previous formula under the name &quot;Coca-Cola Classic&quot;. Some think the decision to replace the original flavor was actually a strategic masterstroke to bolster Coke sales once it came back on the market, which it did; however, the Coca-Cola Company vehemently denies the claim.

===Pepsi===
Pepsi advertising is heavily supported by strategic sponsorships and online marketing. Pepsi&#x27;s logo utilizes the red, white and blue colors of the flag of the United States, drawing on a strong sense of patriotism throughout its branding.

====Pepsi Challenge====
In 1975, Pepsi began showing advertisements based on the Pepsi Challenge, in which ordinary people were asked which product they preferred in blind taste tests. The campaign suggested that, when it came down to taste alone, consumers preferred Pepsi over Coca-Cola. In at least some of these tests, the Coca-Cola was kept at 0 °C, which is too cold for the taste to come out, whereas the Pepsi Cola was kept at regular refrigerator temperature, rigging the test . This prompted Coca-Cola&#x27;s creation of the successful Diet Coke in 1982, and the unsuccessful New Coke three years later, both of which led to a major shifting point in the cola wars. However, the Pepsi Challenge was a marketing campaign and not a scientific study. Subsequent studies with scientific controls found only modest differences between Pepsi and Coke.

==== &quot;Pepsi Stuff&quot;====
In the mid-1990s, Pepsi launched its most successful long-term strategy of the cola wars, Pepsi Stuff. Using the slogan &quot;Drink Pepsi, Get Stuff&quot;, consumers could collect Pepsi Points on packages and cups which could be redeemed for free Pepsi merchandise. After researching and testing the program for over two years to ensure that it resonated with consumers, Pepsi launched Pepsi Stuff, which was an instant success. Due to its success, the program was expanded to include Mountain Dew and Pepsi&#x27;s international markets worldwide. The company continued to run the program for many years, continually innovating with new features each year. This line of commercials led to the court case &quot;Leonard v. Pepsico, Inc.&quot;, which was chronicled in the 2022 Netflix show &quot;Pepsi, Where&#x27;s My Jet?&quot;

===Super Bowl LIII===
Super Bowl LIII was played in Atlanta, which is where Coca-Cola has its head office, in 2019. Pepsi had been a major sponsor of the NFL for years, most recently renewing its sponsorship deal in 2011. Pepsi advertising tied to the game poked fun at the situation with slogans such as &quot;Pepsi in Atlanta. How Refreshing&quot;, &quot;Hey Atlanta, Thanks For Hosting. We&#x27;ll Bring The Drinks&quot;, and &quot;Look Who&#x27;s in Town for Super Bowl LIII&quot;. Both companies ran television ads during the Super Bowl, as Coca-Cola aired the commercial &quot;A Coke is a Coke&quot; just before the Super Bowl&#x27;s National Anthem, while Pepsi ran a series of ads with the tagline &quot;Is Pepsi OK?&quot;.

===Celebrity branding===
Both Coca-Cola and Pepsi made use of celebrity branding in the Cola wars, using musicians as spokespeople. Coca-Cola hired Paula Abdul to represent them, while Pepsi hired Michael Jackson. Jackson helped Pepsi with public relations and advertising, even suggesting that the company use his song &quot;Billie Jean&quot; as their jingle. 

On January 27, 1984, Michael and other members of the Jacksons filmed a Pepsi commercial overseen by Phil Dusenberry, a BBDO ad agency executive, and Alan Pottasch, Pepsi&#x27;s Worldwide Creative Director, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. During a simulated concert before a full house of fans, pyrotechnics accidentally set Jackson&#x27;s hair on fire, causing second-degree burns to his scalp. Jackson underwent treatment to hide the scars and had his third rhinoplasty shortly thereafter. Pepsi settled out of court, and Jackson donated the $1.5million (equivalent to $ in ) settlement to the Brotman Medical Center in Culver City, California; its now-closed Michael Jackson Burn Center was named in his honor.

==Comparison of products==
Many of the brands available from the three largest soda producers, The Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo and Keurig Dr Pepper, are intended as direct, equivalent competitors. The following chart lists these competitors by type or flavor of drink.

==In popular culture==

It was announced that Judd Apatow would be directing a film based on the cola wars for Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group, with Steven Spielberg as producer.

<doc id="495598" wikidata="Q2561707" url="?curid=495598" title="Blade element theory">
<text>Blade element theory (BET) is a mathematical process originally designed by William Froude (1878), David W. Taylor (1893) and Stefan Drzewiecki (1885) to determine the behavior of propellers. It involves breaking a blade down into several small parts then determining the forces on each of these small blade elements. These forces are then integrated along the entire blade and over one rotor revolution in order to obtain the forces and moments produced by the entire propeller or rotor. One of the key difficulties lies in modelling the induced velocity on the rotor disk. Because of this the blade element theory is often combined with momentum theory to provide additional relationships necessary to describe the induced velocity on the rotor disk, producing blade element momentum theory. At the most basic level of approximation a uniform induced velocity on the disk is assumed:
:formula_1

Alternatively the variation of the induced velocity along the radius can be modeled by breaking the blade down into small annuli and applying the conservation of mass, momentum and energy to every annulus. This approach is sometimes called the Froude–Finsterwalder equation.

If the blade element method is applied to helicopter rotors in forward flight it is necessary to consider the flapping motion of the blades as well as the longitudinal and lateral distribution of the induced velocity on the rotor disk. The most simple forward flight inflow models are first harmonic models.

== Simple blade element theory ==

While the momentum theory is useful for determining ideal efficiency, it gives a very incomplete account of the action of screw propellers, neglecting among other things the torque. In order to investigate propeller action in greater detail, the blades are considered as made up of a number of small elements, and the air forces on each element are calculated. Thus, while the momentum theory deals with the flow of the air, the blade-element theory deals primarily with the forces on the propeller blades. The idea of analyzing the forces on elementary strips of propeller blades was first published by William Froude in 1878. It was also worked out independently by Drzewiecki and given in a book on mechanical flight published in Russia seven years later, in 1885. Again, in 1907, Lanchester published a somewhat more advanced form of the blade-element theory without knowledge of previous work on the subject. The simple blade-element theory is usually referred to, however, as the Drzewiecki theory, for it was Drzewiecki who put it into practical form and brought it into general use. Also, he was the first to sum up the forces on the blade elements to obtain the thrust and torque for a whole propeller and the first to introduce the idea of using airfoil data to find the forces on the blade elements.

In the Drzewiecki blade-element theory the propeller is considered a warped or twisted airfoil, each segment of which follows a helical path and is treated as a segment of an ordinary wing. It is usually assumed in the simple theory that airfoil coefficients obtained from wind tunnel tests of model wings (ordinarily tested with an aspect ratio of 6) apply directly to propeller blade elements of the same cross-sectional shape.

The air flow around each element is considered two-dimensional and therefore unaffected by the adjacent parts of the blade. The independence of the blade elements at any given radius with respect to the neighbouring elements has been established theoretically and has also been shown to be substantially true for the working sections of the blade by special experiments made for the purpose. It is also assumed that the air passes through the propeller with no radial flow (&quot;i.e.,&quot; there is no contraction of the slipstream in passing through the propeller disc) and that there is no blade interference. 

=== Aerodynamic forces on a blade element ===
Consider the element at radius &quot;r,&quot; shown in Fig. 1, which has the infinitesimal length &quot;dr&quot; and the width &quot;b.&quot; The motion of the element in an aircraft propeller in flight is along a helical path determined by the forward velocity &quot;V&quot; of the aircraft and the tangential velocity 2πrn of the element in the plane of the propeller disc, where &quot;n&quot; represents the revolutions per unit time. The velocity of the element with respect to the air &quot;Vr&quot; is then the resultant of the forward and tangential velocities, as shown in Fig. 2. Call the angle between the direction of motion of the element and the plane of rotation &quot;Φ,&quot; and the blade angle &quot;β.&quot; The angle of attack α of the element relative to the air is then formula_2&quot;.&quot; 

Applying ordinary airfoil coefficients, the lift force on the element is: 

:formula_3

Let &quot;γ&quot; be the angle between the lift component and the resultant force, or formula_4. Then the total resultant air force on the element is: formula_5

The thrust of the element is the component of the resultant force in the direction of the propeller axis (Fig. 2), or 
formula_6
and since formula_7
formula_8

For convenience let 
formula_9 
and
formula_10 

Then 
formula_11
and the total thrust for the propeller (of B blades) is: 
formula_12

Referring again to Fig. 2, the tangential or torque force is 

:formula_13 

and the torque on the element is 

:formula_14

which, if formula_15, can be written 

:formula_16 

The expression for the torque of the whole propeller is therefore 

:formula_17 

The horsepower absorbed by the propeller, or the torque horsepower, is 

:formula_18

and the efficiency is

:formula_19 

=== Efficiency ===
Because of the variation of the blade width, angle, and airfoil section along the blade, it is not possible to obtain a simple expression for the thrust, torque, and efficiency of propellers in general. A single element at about two-thirds or three-fourths of the tip radius is, however, fairly representative of the whole propeller, and it is therefore interesting to examine the expression for the efficiency of a single element. The efficiency of an element is the ratio of the useful power to the power absorbed, or 

:formula_20 

Now tan &quot;Φ&quot; is the ratio of the forward to the tangential velocity, and formula_21. According to the simple blade-element theory, therefore, the efficiency of an element of a propeller depends only on the ratio of the forward to the tangential velocity and on the formula_22 of the airfoil section. 

The value of &quot;Φ&quot; which gives the maximum efficiency for an element, as found by differentiating the efficiency with respect to &quot;Φ&quot; and equating the result to zero, is

formula_23

The variation of efficiency with 0 is shown in Fig. 3 for two extreme values of &quot;γ&quot;. The efficiency rises to a maximum at formula_24 and then falls to zero again at formula_25. With an formula_26 of 28.6 the maximum possible efficiency of an element according to the simple theory is 0.932, while with an formula_26 of 9.5 it is only 0.812. At the values of &quot;Φ&quot; at which the most important elements of the majority of propellers work (10° to 15°) the effect of formula_26 on efficiency is still greater. Within the range of 10° to 15°, the curves in Fig. 3 indicate that it is advantageous to have both the formula_26 of the airfoil sections and the angle &quot;Φ&quot; (or the advance per revolution, and consequently the pitch) as high as possible.

=== Limitations ===
According to momentum theory, a velocity is imparted to the air passing through the propeller, and half of this velocity is given the air by the time it reaches the propeller plane. This increase of velocity of the air as it passes into the propeller disc is called the inflow velocity. It is always found where there is pressure discontinuity in a fluid. In the case of a wing moving horizontally, the air is given a downward velocity, as shown in Fig. 4., and theoretically half of this velocity is imparted in front of and above the wing, and the other half below and behind. 

This induced downflow is present in the model wing tests from which the airfoil coefficients used in the blade-element theory are obtained; the inflow indicated by the momentum theory is therefore automatically taken into account in the simple blade-element theory. However, the induced downflow is widely different for different aspect ratios, being zero for infinite aspect ratio. Most model airfoil tests are made with rectangular wings having an arbitrarily chosen aspect ratio of 6, and there is no reason to suppose that the downflow in such a test corresponds to the inflow for each element of a propeller blade. In fact, the general conclusion drawn from an exhaustive series of tests, in which the pressure distribution was measured over 12 sections of a model propeller running in a wind tunnel, is that the lift coefficient of the propeller blade element differs considerably from that measured at the same angle of attack on an airfoil of aspect ratio 6. This is one of the greatest weaknesses of the simple blade-element theory. 

Another weakness is that the interference between the propeller blades is not considered. The elements of the blades at any particular radius form a cascade similar to a multiplane with negative stagger, as shown in Fig. 5. Near the tips where the gap is large the interference is very small, but in toward the blade roots it is quite large. 

In actual propellers there is a tip loss which the blade-element theory does not take into consideration. The thrust and torque forces as computed by means of the theory are therefore greater for the elements near the tip than those found by experiment. 

In order to eliminate scale effect, the wind tunnel tests on model wings should be run at the same value of Reynolds number (scale) as the corresponding elements in the propeller blades. Airfoil characteristics measured at such a low scale as, for example, an air velocity of 30 m.p.h. with a 3-in. chord airfoil, show peculiarities not found when the tests are run at a scale comparable with that of propeller elements. The standard propeller section characteristics given in Figs. 11, 12, 13, and 14 were obtained from high Reynolds-number tests in the Variable Density Tunnel of the NACA, and, fortunately, for all excepting the thickest of these sections there is very little difference in characteristics at high and low Reynolds numbers. These values may be used with reasonable accuracy as to scale for propellers operating at tip speeds well below the speed of sound in air, and therefore relatively free from any effects of compressibility. 

The poor accuracy of the simple blade-element theory is very well shown in a report by Durand and Lesley, in which they have computed the performance of a large number of model propellers (80) and compared the computed values with the actual performances obtained from tests on the model propellers themselves. In the words of the authors: The divergencies between the two sets of results, while showing certain elements of consistency, are on the whole too large and too capriciously distributed to justify the use of the theory in this simplest form for other than approximate estimates or for comparative purposes. The airfoils were tested in two different wind tunnels and in one of the tunnels at two different air velocities, and the propeller characteristics computed from the three sets of airfoil data differ by as much as 28%, illustrating quite forcibly the necessity for having the airfoil tests made at the correct scale. 

In spite of all its inaccuracies the simple blade-element theory has been a useful tool in the hands of experienced propeller designers. With it a skilful designer having a knowledge of suitable empirical factors can design propellers which usually fit the main conditions imposed upon them fairly well in that they absorb the engine power at very nearly the proper revolution speed. They are not, however, necessarily the most efficient propellers for their purpose, for the simple theory is not sufficiently accurate to show slight differences in efficiency due to changes in pitch distribution, plan forms, etc.

=== Example ===

In choosing a propeller to analyze, it is desirable that its aerodynamic characteristics be known so that the accuracy of the calculated results can be checked. It is also desirable that the analysis be made of a propeller operating at a relatively low tip speed in order to be free from any effects of compressibility and that it be running free from body interference. The only propeller tests which satisfy all of these conditions are tests of model propellers in a wind tunnel. We shall therefore take for our example the central or master propeller of a series of model wood propellers of standard Navy form, tested by Dr. W. F. Durand at Stanford University. This is a two-bladed propeller 3 ft. in diameter, with a uniform geometrical pitch of 2.1 ft. (or a pitch-diameter ratio of 0.7). The blades have standard propeller sections based on the R.A.F-6 airfoil (Fig. 6), and the blade widths, thicknesses, and angles are as given in the first part of Table I. In our analysis we shall consider the propeller as advancing with a velocity of 40 m.p.h. and turning at the rate of 1,800 r.p.m.For the section at 75% of the tip radius, the radius is 1.125 ft., the blade width is 0.198 ft., the thickness ratio is 0.107, the lower camber is zero, and the blade angle &quot;β&quot; is 16.6°. 

The forward velocity
formula_30

and 
formula_31

The path angle 

:formula_32

The angle of attack is therefore

:formula_33

From Fig. 7, for a flat-faced section of thickness ratio 0.107 at an angle of attack of 1.1°, &quot;γ&quot; = 3.0°, and, from Fig. 9, &quot;CL&quot; = 0.425. (For sections having lower camber, &quot;CL&quot; should be corrected in accordance with the relation given in Fig. 8, and &quot;γ&quot; is given the same value as that for a flat-faced section having the upper camber only.)

Then 

:formula_34 

and,

:formula_35 

Also,

:formula_36

The computations of &quot;Tc&quot; and &quot;Qc&quot; for six representative elements of the propeller are given in convenient tabular form in Table I, and the values of &quot;Tc&quot; and &quot;Qc&quot; are plotted against radius in Fig. 9. The curves drawn through these points are sometimes referred to as the torque grading curves. The areas under the curve represent
formula_37
and 
formula_38
these being the expressions for the total thrust and torque per blade per unit of dynamic pressure due to the velocity of advance. The areas may be found by means of a planimeter, proper consideration, of course, being given to the scales of values, or the integration may be performed approximately (but with satisfactory accuracy) by means of Simpson&#x27;s rule. 

In using Simpson&#x27;s rule the radius is divided into an even number of equal parts, such as ten. The ordinate at each division can then be found from the grading curve. If the original blade elements divide the blade into an even number of equal parts it is not necessary to plot the grading curves, but the curves are advantageous in that they show graphically the distribution of thrust and torque along the blade. They also provide a check upon the computations, for incorrect points will not usually form a fair curve. 

If the abscissas are denoted by &quot;r&quot; and the ordinates at the various divisions by &quot;y&quot;1, &quot;y&quot;2, ..., &quot;y&quot;11, according to Simpson’s rule the area with ten equal divisions will be 
formula_39 

The area under the thrust-grading curve of our example is therefore 
:formula_40 

and in like manner
formula_41 

The above integrations have also been made by means of a planimeter, and the average results from five trials agree with those obtained by means of Simpson’s rule within one-fourth of one per cent. 

The thrust of the propeller in standard air is 

:formula_42

and the torque is

:formula_43

The power absorbed by the propeller is

:formula_44

or

:formula_45 

and the efficiency is 

:formula_46 

The above-calculated performance compares with that measured in the wind tunnel as follows:
The power as calculated by the simple blade-element theory is in this case over 11% too low, the thrust is about 5 % low, and the efficiency is about 8% high. Of course, a differently calculated performance would have been obtained if propeller-section characteristics from tests on the same series of airfoils in a different wind tunnel had been used, but the variable-density tunnel tests are probably the most reliable of all.

Some light may be thrown upon the discrepancy between the calculated and observed performance by referring again to the pressure distribution tests on a model propeller. In these tests the pressure distribution over several sections of a propeller blade was measured while the propeller was running in a wind tunnel, and the three following sets of tests were made on corresponding airfoils: 

The results of these three sets of airfoil tests are shown for the section at three-fourths of the tip radius in Fig. 10, which has been taken from the report. It will be noticed that the coefficients of resultant force &quot;CR&quot; agree quite well for the median section of the airfoil of aspect ratio 6 and the corresponding section of the special propeller-blade airfoil but that the resultant force coefficient for the entire airfoil of aspect ratio 6 is considerably lower. It is natural, then, that the calculated thrust and power of a propeller should be too low when based on airfoil characteristics for aspect ratio 6.

== Modifications ==
Many modifications to the simple blade-element theory have been suggested in order to make it more complete and to improve its accuracy. Most of these modified theories attempt to take into account the blade interference, and, in some of them, attempts are also made to eliminate the inaccuracy due to the use of airfoil data from tests on wings having a finite aspect ratio, such as 6. The first modification to be made was in the nature of a combination of the simple Drzewiecki theory with the Froude momentum theory.

<text>The CarterCopter is an experimental compound autogyro developed by Carter Aviation Technologies in the United States to demonstrate slowed rotor technology. On 17 June 2005, the CarterCopter became the first rotorcraft to achieve mu-1 (μ=1), an equal ratio of airspeed to rotor tip speed, but crashed on the next flight and has been inoperable since. It is being replaced by the Carter Personal Air Vehicle.

==Design and development==

The CarterCopter is a pusher configuration autogyro with wings and a twin boom tail, intended as a prototype and a technology demonstrator. The rotor is a two-bladed design weighted with depleted uranium at each tip, and it is mounted on a tilting mast, allowing the wing to stay at optimum wing efficiency at all speeds.
It is an all-composite design with a hull pressurized up to
0.69 bar.

The tricycle undercarriage is retractable, and has a large travel to allow for landing at up to 20 ft/sec without bounce. The aircraft had been modified and rebuilt after an accident (a gear-up landing) in 2003.
NASA had funded $1 million of the development using three research grants, and the aircraft managed to accomplish at least one of NASA&#x27;s five goals.

===Concept===
The CarterCopter concept is a gyrocopter with an unusually stiff, relatively heavy rotor, supplemented with conventional wings. At low speed, the vehicle flies as a gyrocopter, and can pre-spin the rotor for a vertical takeoff and very brief hover (about 5 seconds), and can land more or less vertically. Several technical challenges make flying a slow rotor difficult, but rotor stability is achieved through the combination of the rotor tip weights&#x27; location ahead of the blade center line (forward center of gravity) and the center of lift aft of the blade center line.
At high speed (above about 100 mph) the aircraft flies mostly using the fixed wings, with the rotor simply windmilling. The rotor spins with a tip speed below airspeed, which means that the retreating blade flies completely stalled. On a helicopter this would cause massive lift dissymmetry and insoluble control issues but the fixed wings keep the aircraft in the air and stable.

The low rotation speed and flat feathering of the rotor means that it causes little drag, and the company claims that the aircraft would be potentially able to leverage the advantages of fixed wings as well as gyrocopters, giving almost all the capabilities of helicopters (except hovering) but with a relatively simple mechanical system. Carter Aviation also claims the system is safer than a typical fixed-wing aircraft, and others have remarked that the design is much safer, much less complex and less expensive than a helicopter, a tilt-rotor or the Boeing X-50 Dragonfly Canard Rotor/Wing. The CarterCopter should be capable of higher airspeeds now only achievable by fixed-wing aircraft, but also able to land like an autogyro in any small area in an emergency.

===Takeoff===
At takeoff the pilot angles the top rotor flat (zero angle of attack) and spins it to very high speed (between 365 and 425 rpm). The rotor is then disconnected from the engine and the angle of attack of the main rotor blades is increased suddenly so that the vehicle leaps into the air. The aircraft&#x27;s main rotor has enough momentum due to heavy counterweights in the tips that it can hover for a short time safely. The pilot then applies full power to the rear pusher propeller and the vehicle starts to move forwards. As it does so, air is forced through the main rotor, spinning it faster and generating more lift. The vehicle climbs into the air, flying as an autogyro.

===Cruising===
Once the CarterCopter gets up to a forward speed of about , its stubby, lightweight wings provide most of the lift. The pilot can then flatten the angle of attack of the main rotor so it produces very little lift, dramatically reducing the amount of induced drag created by the rotor. Although the rotor is unused at high speed, the rotor is kept spinning at about 80 RPM as the rotation keeps the rotor stretched, preventing excessive flapping.

Normally a helicopter or gyrocopter cannot fly forward at the same speed as or faster than its rotor tip speed. This is because the low airspeed of the retreating rotor blade would cause retreating blade stall, whilst the advancing rotor blade would be traveling at twice the speed of the aircraft, producing uncontrollable flight due to dissymmetry of lift.

However, with the CarterCopter, the fixed wings provide the lift required to remain aloft. Since the rotor is unloaded, the aerodynamic forces on the rotor are very minor. This means that a CarterCopter can theoretically fly much faster than the tip speed of the rotor. The rotors would still experience flapping as they rotate due to dissymmetry of lift between the two sides of the vehicle, but Carter Aviation claims this is manageable.

The claimed theoretical maximum speed of a CarterCopter type aircraft is around 500 mph (800 km/h), which would be about twice as fast as the helicopter flight airspeed record.

===Achievements===

The prototype&#x27;s engine was normally aspirated, and hence limited to just 320 hp (240 kW) and the aircraft went about 173 mph (270 km/h); which is still ~40% faster than a conventional autogyro but slower than gyrodynes of the 1950s. A custom gyroplane can go 168.29 km/h (104.6 mph), and Carter says the Carter Personal Air Vehicle goes .
At 4,000 lbs weight, the CCTD can climb 750 fpm.

From 1999 to 2001 there were 4 recorded instances of non-fatal crashes, while Carter claims 10 accidents over 7 years, all non-fatal.

Test pilot Larry Neal claimed that the CarterCopter is a challenge to fly because it is a combination of helicopter, autogyro and fixed-wing aircraft.

The CarterCopter achieved its maximum mu (mu is the ratio of airspeed to rotor tip speed) of 1.0 for a brief moment on June 17, 2005, the first time any rotary aircraft has reached this level. CarterCopter&#x27;s pilot claimed that there was no great drama, and mu 1 was reached accidentally due to normal variations in rotor RPM (at 107 rpm) and vehicle airspeed; the pilot described it as &#x27;smooth&#x27; with no significant vibration. The tests were performed under a US Army contract. Carter says they repeated mu-1 with the PAV in 2013.

However, on the next test flight the same day in 2005, the CarterCopter made a hard landing (crashed), causing significant damage, but the pilots were unhurt. The crash was caused by failing propeller bolts which damaged wires controlling the rotor. The propeller was designed by Carter, and was an 8 ft scimitar controllable-pitch propeller weighing 15 lbs and had a thrust of 1850 lbf. It was initially believed that the CarterCopter was unrepairable; later inspection showed that it could be repaired, but the company chose to work on a small open wingless autogyro demonstrator instead. Also later in 2005 and using lessons learned from the CarterCopter, design began on the subsequent compound aircraft, the Carter PAV, which flew in 2011.

The company claims that the testing indicated 
that the vehicle architecture could potentially outperform helicopters on every dimension except sustained hover, and should be much cheaper to buy and maintain. The company also claims that it also very nearly matches the L/D of fixed wing General Aviation aeroplanes at cruise speed - but with near-vertical takeoff and landing. However, jump take-off ability using the stored rotor energy has never been shown to more than about 16 feet with the wing attached.

NASA has made computer models of the CarterCopter rotor above mu=1 and up to 400 knots airspeed.

<doc id="495612" wikidata="Q278216" url="?curid=495612" title="Victor Babeș">
<text>Victor Babeș (; 28 July 1854 in Vienna – 19 October 1926 in Bucharest) was a Romanian physician, bacteriologist, academician and professor. One of the founders of modern microbiology, Victor Babeș is author of one of the first treatises of bacteriology in the world – &quot;Bacteria and their role in pathological anatomy and histology of infectious diseases&quot;, written in collaboration with French scientist Victor André Cornil in 1885. In 1888, Babeș underlies the principle of passive immunity, and a few years later enunciates the principle of antibiosis. He made early and significant contributions to the study of rabies, leprosy, diphtheria, tuberculosis and other infectious diseases. He also discovered more than 50 unknown germs and foresaw new methods of staining bacteria and fungi. Victor Babeș introduced rabies vaccination and founded serotherapy in Romania.

Babeș-Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca and the University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Timișoara bear his name.

== Origin and family ==
Victor Babeș was the son of Vincențiu Babeș and Sophia Goldschneider. His father was a Romanian magistrate, teacher, journalist and politician from the Banat region, founding member of the Romanian Academic Society (22 April 1866) and President of History Section of the Romanian Academy (1898–1899). One of the personalities who have distinguished themselves in the fight for the rights of Romanians in Transylvania, Vincențiu Babeș was repeatedly deputy in the Vienna Award and president of the Romanian National Party. Victor had a sister, Alma, and a brother, Aurel. The younger brother of Victor Babeș, Aurel, was a chemist and worked with Victor at the Institute of Bucharest. The son of Aurel, Aurel A. Babeș, was also a physician, and discovered a screening test for cervical cancer.

Victor Babeș was married to Iosefina Thorma, with whom he had a son, Mircea.

== Studies ==
In childhood, Victor Babeș was always attracted to poetry, music and especially literature, as well as performance sport, natural science and dramatics. He began studying dramatic arts in Budapest. The death of his sister, Alma, caused by tuberculosis, at a young age, led him to abandon started studies and enroll in medicine. He attended the Faculty of Medicine in Budapest and Vienna. Victor received his doctorate in medicine in Vienna, in 1878. In 1881 he received a scholarship and went to Paris and Berlin, where he worked with leading teachers of the time: Cornil, Louis Pasteur, Rudolf Virchow, Robert Koch and others. He continued to study with great teachers from Munich, Heidelberg, and Strasbourg until 1886.

== Scientific activity ==

He began his scientific career as an assistant in the Pathological Anatomy laboratory from Budapest (1874–1881). In 1885 he was appointed professor of histopathology at the Faculty of Medicine in Budapest. The same year, he discovered a parasitic sporozoan of the ticks, named &quot;Babesia&quot; in his honor (of the family &quot;Babesiidae&quot;), and which causes a rare and severe disease called babesiosis. Later that year, he publishes the first treatise of bacteriology in the world, &quot;Bacteria and their role in pathological anatomy and histology of infectious diseases&quot;, which he co-authored with Cornil.

Babeș&#x27;s scientific endeavours were wide-ranging. He was the first to demonstrate the presence of tuberculous bacilli in the urine of infected patients. He also discovered cellular inclusions in rabies-infected nerve cells. Of diagnostic value, they were to be named after him (Babeș-Negri bodies). Babeș was the promoter of morphopathological conception about the infectious process, medical guidelines based on the synthesis between bacteriology and pathological anatomy. Babeș was credited with inventing the first rationalized model of thermostat and some methods for staining bacteria and fungi in histological preparations and cultures.

In 1887, Babeș is called in the country by Romanian government and appointed professor of pathological anatomy and bacteriology at the Faculty of Medicine in Bucharest. He held this position until 1926. Also in 1887, it was established, by Law no. 1197, the Institute of Bacteriology and Pathology, headed by Babeș and that will bear in the future his name (Victor Babeș Institute). In 1889 he was elected corresponding member of the Romanian Academy, and from 1893 he became titular on this position.

In 1900 he founded the Anatomic Society in Bucharest, dealing with anatomical clinical studies. In 1913, he prepared a cholera vaccine to combat the cholera epidemic that broke out among Romanian Army that was in the campaign of the Second Balkan War in Bulgaria. Between 1916 and 1918 he continued the preparation of biological products, remaining in the area occupied by the Central Powers. In 1919 he is appointed professor at the University of Cluj, newly founded that year.

Victor Babeș introduced rabies vaccination in Romania, only three years after its initiation by Louis Pasteur. He is considered the second rabiologist in the world after Pasteur and the father of serotherapy, precursor to modern immunology. His work also had a strong influence upon veterinary medicine, especially concerning prophylaxis and serum medication. He prepared the anti-diphtheria serum and conducted broad activity in researching pellagra, tuberculosis, typhoid fever and leprosy. He has published over 1,000 scientific papers and 25 monographs in the field of microbiology and pathology.

In recognition of his innovative work in medicine, Victor Babes was elected member of the French &quot;Académie nationale de médecine&quot;, of the International Committee for Combating Leprosy, received three times the award of the French Academy of Sciences. Likewise, he was awarded the title of Knight of the Legion of Honor.

== Philosophical conceptions and militant attitude ==
Besides scientific work, he was closely concerned with the problems of prophylactic medicine (water supply of towns and villages, scientific organization of the anti-epidemic fight, etc.). As director of the Institute that bears his name, Babeș has addressed some of the health and social problems of the time, such as pellagra problem, and formulated realistic solutions on the medical organization of the country, foreseeing the organization of a Ministry of Health. Closely linked with the people, Victor Babeș fought for applying the discoveries of science to improve people&#x27;s lives. He studied the causes of diseases with mass spreading (pellagra, tuberculosis), drawing attention to their social roots.

Throughout the scientific and social activities, an important role had his philosophical materialist conception, exposed especially in works like &quot;Considerations on the natural science&#x27;s ratio to philosophy&quot; (1879) and &quot;Faith and science&quot; (1924). Babeș refuted Kant&#x27;s agnosticism, Descartes&#x27; innatism, Schelling&#x27;s idealist apriorism and fideism. He consistently supported the objective nature of the world, the laws of nature and causation.

Victor Babeș founded the publications &quot;Annals of the Institute of Pathology and Bacteriology&quot; (; 1889), &quot;Medical Romania&quot; (; 1893) and &quot;Archives of medical sciences&quot; (; 1895).

== Death ==
Victor Babeș died on 19 October 1926 in Bucharest. His grave is at the Cantacuzino Institute of Bucharest.

<doc id="495614" wikidata="Q12986210" url="?curid=495614" title="Brane cosmology">
<text>Brane cosmology refers to several theories in particle physics and cosmology related to string theory, superstring theory and M-theory.

==Brane and bulk==
The central idea is that the visible, four-dimensional spacetime is restricted to a brane inside a higher-dimensional space, called the &quot;bulk&quot; (also known as &quot;hyperspace&quot;). If the additional dimensions are compact, then the observed universe contains the extra dimension, and then no reference to the bulk is appropriate. In the bulk model, at least some of the extra dimensions are extensive (possibly infinite), and other branes may be moving through this bulk. Interactions with the bulk, and possibly with other branes, can influence our brane and thus introduce effects not seen in more standard cosmological models.

==Why gravity is weak and the cosmological constant is small==
Some versions of brane cosmology, based on the large extra dimension idea, can explain the weakness of gravity relative to the other fundamental forces of nature, thus solving the hierarchy problem. In the brane picture, the electromagnetic, weak and strong nuclear force are localized on the brane, but gravity has no such constraint and propagates on the full spacetime, called the bulk. Much of the gravitational attractive power &quot;leaks&quot; into the bulk. As a consequence, the force of gravity should appear significantly stronger on small (subatomic or at least sub-millimetre) scales, where less gravitational force has &quot;leaked&quot;. Various experiments are currently under way to test this. Extensions of the large extra dimension idea with supersymmetry in the bulk appear to be promising in addressing the so-called cosmological constant problem.

==Models of brane cosmology==
One of the earliest documented attempts to apply brane cosmology as part of a conceptual theory is dated to 1983.

The authors discussed the possibility that the Universe has formula_1 dimensions, but ordinary particles are confined in a potential well which is narrow along formula_2 spatial directions and flat along three others, and proposed a particular five-dimensional model.

In 1998/99, Merab Gogberashvili published on arXiv a number of articles where he showed that if the Universe is considered as a thin shell (a mathematical synonym for &quot;brane&quot;) expanding in 5-dimensional space then there is a possibility to obtain one scale for particle theory corresponding to the 5-dimensional cosmological constant and Universe thickness, and thus to solve the hierarchy problem. Gogberashvili also showed that the four-dimensionality of the Universe is the result of the stability requirement found in mathematics since the extra component of the Einstein field equations giving the confined solution for matter fields coincides with one of the conditions of stability.

In 1999, there were proposed the closely related Randall–Sundrum scenarios, RS1 and RS2. (See &quot;Randall–Sundrum model&quot; for a nontechnical explanation of RS1). These particular models of brane cosmology have attracted a considerable amount of attention. For instance, the related Chung-Freese model, which has applications for spacetime metric engineering, followed in 2000.

Later, the ekpyrotic and cyclic proposals appeared. The ekpyrotic theory hypothesizes that the origin of the observable universe occurred when two parallel branes collided.

==Empirical tests==
As of now, no experimental or observational evidence of large extra dimensions, as required by the Randall–Sundrum models, has been reported. An analysis of results from the Large Hadron Collider in December 2010 severely constrains the black holes produced in theories with large extra dimensions. The recent multi-messenger gravitational wave event GW170817 has also been used to put weak limits on large extra dimensions.

<text>Wallace Everette Pratt (1885–1981) was a pioneer American petroleum geologist. When he started his position at Standard Oil in 1937, the company named one of their tankers after him, the SS Wallace E Pratt. He is also notable for helping establish Guadalupe Mountains National Park of West Texas and Eddy County, New Mexico through his donation of McKittrick Canyon in Salt Flat, Texas. He is also notable for his marriage to suffragist Iris Calderhead. In Guadalupe Mountains National Park, they had constructed the Wallace E. Pratt House, the Ship on the Desert, which resembled an oil tanker.

==Biography==
Born in Phillipsburg, Kansas, March 15, 1885, Pratt began his career in geology as an assistant with the Kansas Geological Survey shortly after he graduated from the University of Kansas in 1907 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree.

===Humble Oil===
From 1909 to 1914, he worked in Philippines, becoming chief of the Division of Mines there in 1912. He returned to the U.S. in 1916, and in 1918 joined Humble Oil &amp; Refining Co. as the company&#x27;s first geologist. Prior to that time the company had treated the search for oil as largely a hit or miss operation without scientific exploration. But Pratt, joined by 10 more geologists during 1918–19, proved that geology was an important factor in finding oil. Among the most notable early contributions made by Pratt and his staff were geological studies that led to the correct interpretation of the structure of the huge Mexia Field, discovered in October 1920 in East Texas. On the basis of these studies, Humble bought leases on the structure and developed substantial reserves and production. This work and leasing of large amounts of land that proved productive in Powell, Texas, in 1923 firmly established Humble as an oil producer.

By 1920, the exploitation of Goose Creek Oil Field by Humble Oil led to the subsidence of the land over the oil field. Pratt was tasked with the investigation of this novel phenomenon and produced a report in which the subsidence was definitively attributed to the extraction of petroleum. In 1926, together with D. W. Johnson, he published these findings in a scientific paper. By this year, after about ten years of active pumping, most of the productive area of the field had subsided three feet, and the submerging of the facilities had already become obvious to field operators.

Pratt also played a prominent role in the scientific progress of his profession. As early as 1922, others were using geophysical instruments experimentally on the Texas Gulf Coast as a new method for finding salt domes. After studying results from this work, Pratt concluded that Humble should use geophysical instruments and methods. In line with these recommendations, in 1924, Humble set up a geophysics group and established a shop in Houston for geophysics research and development, and the manufacture of a refraction seismograph recording in the field. Pratt served as Humble&#x27;s chief geologist and later director, and vice president. In 1937, he joined Standard Oil Co. (Humble&#x27;s parent firm in New Jersey), once again rising to director, executive committee member, and finally, vice president, a position he held until he retired from the company in 1945. In the same year that he had joined Standard Oil, the company named one of their tankers after him, the SS Wallace E Pratt.

===Petroleum geologist===
After retirement, Pratt served on the National Security Resources Board for two years and began a long career as a consultant geologist. Pratt wrote more than 100 geological papers during his lifetime, including &quot;Oil in the Earth&quot;, one of the most widely read books in his profession. An often repeated quote from this book is, &quot;Gold is where you find it, according to an old adage, but judging from the record of our experience, oil must be sought first of all in our minds.&quot; There was a limited amount to find, though: at the University of Kansas, Pratt gave a lecture &quot;Oil in the Earth&quot;, where he speculated that the total amount of oil in the United States was 100 billion barrels.
===Legacy and honors===
* One of the founders of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, Pratt was elected fourth president of the association in 1920.

* He was the first recipient of the AAPG&#x27;s Sidney Powers Memorial Award, awarded in 1945.
* In 1972, he received the AAPG&#x27;s Human Needs Award.
* He also received the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers&#x27; Anthony F. Lucas Medal in 1948.
* The American Petroleum Institute&#x27;s Gold Medal for Distinguished Achievement in 1954. He was director of API for many years.
* Pratt was inducted into the Permian Basin Petroleum Museum&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1969.
* He was named Grand Old Man of Exploration in 1976 by directors of the International Petroleum Exposition. 
* Since 1982, the AAPG has given the Wallace E. Pratt Memorial Award to the best AAPG Bulletin article published each calendar year.

=== Guadalupe Mountains National Park ===
Wallace E. Pratt donated , which included McKittrick Canyon, to the National Park Service, forming the core of the Guadalupe Mountains National Park. This land includes his former homes:

* Pratt Cabin, open to the public. 
* Ship On The Desert, a home built to resemble an oil tanker, now used as a ranger station. 

Pratt died December 25, 1981, in his Tucson, Arizona, home. He was 96.

<text>Threefin or triplefin blennies are blenniiforms, small percomorph marine fish of the family Tripterygiidae. Found in tropical and temperate waters of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans, the family contains about 150 species in 30 genera. The family name derives from the Greek &quot;tripteros&quot; meaning &quot;with three wings&quot;.

With an elongated, typical blenny form, threefin blennies differ from their relatives by having a dorsal fin separated into three parts (hence the name); the first two are spinous. The small, slender pelvic fins are located underneath the throat and possess a single spine; the large anal fin may have one or two spines. The pectoral fins are greatly enlarged, and the tail fin is rounded. The New Zealand topknot, &quot;Notoclinus fenestratus&quot;, is the largest species at 20 cm in total length; most other species do not exceed 6 cm.

Many threefin blennies are brightly coloured, often for reasons of camouflage; these species are popular in the aquarium hobby. As demersal fish, threefin blennies spend most of their time on or near the bottom on coral and rocks. The fish are typically found in shallow, clear waters with sun exposure, such as lagoons and seaward reefs; nervous fish, they retreat to rock crevices at any perceived threat.

Threefin blennies are diurnal and territorial; many species exhibit sexual dichromatism, with the females drab compared to the males. The second dorsal fin is also extended in the males of some species. Small invertebrates comprise the bulk of the threefin blenny diet.

<doc id="495628" wikidata="Q1430569" url="?curid=495628" title="Uta-garuta">
<text>is a type of a deck of &quot;karuta&quot;, Japanese traditional playing cards. A set of &quot;uta-garuta&quot; contains two sets of 100 cards, with a &quot;waka&quot; poem written on each. &quot;Uta-garuta&quot; is also the name of the game in which the deck is used. The standard collection of poems used is the &quot;Hyakunin Isshu&quot;, chosen by poet Fujiwara no Teika in the Kamakura period, which is often also used as the name of the game.

Since early 20th century the game is played mostly on Japanese New Year holidays.

==How to play==

===Basic rules===
The game uses two types of cards.

*&quot;Yomifuda&quot; (lit. &quot;Reading Cards&quot;): One hundred cards with a figure of a person, their name, and a complete poem by them on each.
*&quot;Torifuda&quot; (lit. &quot;Grabbing Cards&quot;): One hundred cards with only the finishing phrases of the poems on each.

The game is played with the players seated on the floor. At the start of a game, 100 &quot;torifuda&quot; are neatly arranged on the floor face up between the players. When the reader starts reading out a poem on the &quot;yomifuda&quot;, the players quickly search for the &quot;torifuda&quot; on which the corresponding final phrase is written.

There are two ways to play the game based on the rules above.

===Chirashi-dori===
One reader, three or more players:

#Mix up the deck of torifuda, and lay them out on the floor. Players sit around the cards.
#The reader draws a yomifuda and starts reading it out loud. Players attempt to recognize the poem being read as soon as possible, and race to find and take the corresponding torifuda as soon as they do.
#When a player has taken the corresponding torifuda, the reader moves on to the next yomifuda.
#When all the cards are taken, the player with the most cards wins the game.

===Genpei-gassen===
This playing style takes its name from the Genpei war.

One reader, two teams of one or more players each:

#Divide the players into two groups. The two groups are called &quot;Genji&quot; and &quot;Heike&quot;.
#Mix up the torifuda, and give 50 cards to each side.
#Genji and Heike sit face to face. Lay out 50 cards in front of each group in three lines facing the group.
#Gameplay is the same as in Chirashi-dori. Players can take cards from either side.
#If a player takes a card from the opponent&#x27;s side, they can move one card from their own side to the opponent&#x27;s side.
#If a player takes a wrong card, the opponent can move one card to the player&#x27;s side as a penalty.
#The side that has no more torifuda on their side wins the game.

===Strategy===
The odds of winning increase if one knows the phrases. One even may be able to take a card immediately after hearing the reader read aloud only the first letters of the yomifuda poem. Technique in reading is also very important, having to know how to correctly space out the words and the seconds of the pause.

==Competitive karuta==

In Japan there are national conventions for the competitive format of the game.

==In popular culture==
The manga, anime series and live action movie &quot;Chihayafuru&quot; portrays the story of a group of young people who competitively play Hyakunin Isshu karuta with the aim of becoming best in the world. The series debuted in 2007, and its popularity has boosted the popularity of competitive &quot;karuta&quot; in Japan and abroad.

In the manga and anime series &quot;Nanbaka&quot;, uta-garuta is the 3rd Event of the New Year Joint Cooperation tournament. 

The 21st movie of the &quot;Detective Conan&quot; anime series, &quot;Crimson Love Letter&quot;, features a uta-garuta competition as the main storyline.

<text>St George&#x27;s Fields was an area of Southwark in South London, England.

==History==
Originally the area was an undifferentiated part of the south side of the Thames, which was low-lying marshland unsuitable even for agricultural purposes. There is evidence of Roman occupation. As at Lambeth Marsh, the settlement was built on raised through roads over the marsh lands. These were likely summer residences, for in winter the land was under water. A monastery is known to have existed at Bermondsey before 715 AD. Bermondsey is likely to have been a higher, drier spot in an otherwise marshy area.

The area was part of the king&#x27;s demesne. In 1082, according to the &quot;Annales Monasterii de Bermundeseia&quot;, Alwinus Child obtained a royal license to found a monastery dedicated to St Saviour, most likely on the site of the earlier one. In 1086, the monastery became part of the Cluniac network under the Priory of St Mary&#x27;s of La Charité-sur-Loire. Bermondsey Priory later acquired additional properties neighbouring their home manor.

The area takes its name from the nearby Church of St George the Martyr, which according to the &quot;Annals of Bermondsey Abbey&quot; was founded by Thomas Ardern and Thomas his son in 1122. The small de Ardern family property occupied the corner of the junction of the high street and &quot;old&quot; Kent street (now Tabard Street); presumably this had been acquired from Canterbury after 1086. It may have been a hamlet that had developed at what is the junction of the Roman roads now known as Stane Street and Watling Street. This too was given to Bermondsey Priory in 1122 by the Arderns along with the church of St George the Martyr which is in that precinct. The Rectors were appointed by the Priory/Abbey until the Reformation changes and its dissolution.

==Suffolk Place==

In 1479 William Brandon was appointed Knight Marshal of the Marshalsea Court, and therefore, of Marshalsea prison. The Brandons also came to control the King&#x27;s Bench Prison. Prisons, at that time, were run as private concerns for profit, as a sort of forced lodging for debtors and those awaiting trial. As they became more prominent at court the Brandons grew wealthier and acquired from the Abbey parts of the western side of the high street to create a large mansion. and grounds including, notably, Moulton Close, which is now Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park around the Imperial War Museum. The house became known as Brandon Place.

Charles Brandon, the last of the male line, became Earl Marshal in 1510 and was created Duke of Suffolk in 1514; he married Henry VIII&#x27;s sister in 1516. The mansion then became known as Suffolk Place. In 1536 Charles gave Suffolk Place, rebuilt by him in fine Renaissance style in 1522, to King Henry VIII in exchange for Norwich Palace on the Strand. Shortly after, in June 1536, Bermondsey Abbey was induced to &quot;grant&quot; its land to the king as part of the Dissolution of the Monasteries: hence he now owned all of the Abbey’s manor west of the high street. Henry VIII gave this building to Queen Jane Seymour in 1537. It appears that it was the king&#x27;s intention to create a new royal hunting park and the Brandon mansion was to serve as its lodge. However, he seems to have lost interest in the project after the Queen died of post-natal complications shortly after the birth of Edward VI.

== Property of the City ==

The manor belonged to the Crown for only fourteen years, as in 1550 the City acquired it from Edward VI&#x27;s government and also the Canterbury manor on the east side of the high street. The Abbot&#x27;s manor became known as &quot;The King&#x27;s Manor&quot;. This was presumably because of the royal presence at the old Suffolk House. This had been specifically excluded from the City’s jurisdiction by clauses in the 1550 charter. The building remained a royal mansion; in 1554 Queen Mary stayed overnight with her new husband King Philip II of Spain as part of their progress to London. The City&#x27;s jurisdiction in Southwark now stretched across from the various borders with Lambeth and Bermondsey. These lands were paid for through the use of the endowments of the Bridge House Estates. From this point the City nominated the Rector of St George&#x27;s, as to the present day.

The area having been over the course of time drained, St George&#x27;s Fields, comprised broad open meadows. By the reign of Charles I it was a popular meeting place for mobs, and in May 1640 a large armed mob attacked Lambeth Palace in the hope of capturing the unpopular Archbishop, William Laud. At the restoration, during Charles II&#x27;s progress from Dover to London, the Lord Mayor and Aldermen feted the king under a large tent erected in St George&#x27;s Fields, where on 29 of May 1660, a great banquet was held prior to the king&#x27;s entering the City. According to Samuel Pepys and John Evelyn, six years later, St George&#x27;s Fields were one of the places of refuge to which the poorer citizens retreated with such of their goods and chattels as they could save from the Great Fire of London. It also became a place much favoured by open-air preachers, who were not allowed to hold forth in London.
The City&#x27;s control of the area of St George&#x27;s Fields allowed its development. From 1750 the creation of the new roads associated with the new Westminster Bridge and the improvements to the old London Bridge created the traffic nexus at Newington which because of these changes became known as Elephant and Castle, and the junction of St George&#x27;s Circus was required to connect these with the 1769 Blackfriars Bridge Road / London Road. The City also decided to relocate the Bethlem Royal Hospital from Moorfields in 1815. The location at the edge of the territory it had control of in St George&#x27;s Fields, the site of the Dog and Duck tavern, was thought at the time to be sufficiently rural for the institution but also convenient to the built up area.

St George&#x27;s Fields was the scene of riots in 1768, agitating for the release of John Wilkes and, more seriously, was the starting point of the Gordon Riots in 1780 which began in the movement to repeal the act of parliament removing penalties for Catholics.

== The obelisk at St George&#x27;s Circus ==
The obelisk at St George&#x27;s Circus was built in 1771 in honour of Brass Crosby, the Lord Mayor of the City of London. It was moved to the north apex of Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park, (the remnant of Moulton Close) a short distance to the southwest, in front of the museum, in 1905, and put back in its original spot in the late 1990s.

The obelisk was mentioned in the novel &quot;David Copperfield&quot; by Charles Dickens:
== St George&#x27;s Cathedral, Southwark ==

Although there had been a Catholic chapel at London Road a new and much larger church was required for an increasing local population. As the area is known as St George&#x27;s Fields and the site of the new church was on St George&#x27;s Road its dedication to England&#x27;s Patron Saint was suggested immediately. It was designed by Augustus Pugin, who married there, being considered the most important Catholic church in England when it was built. It could seat about 3,000 persons, and the building was 240 feet long by 72 feet wide. The church was solemnly opened by Bishop Wiseman on 4 July 1848. To mark the occasion Pope Pius IX sent a golden chalice and paten as a gift. Two years later Pope Pius IX restored the English hierarchy and St George&#x27;s was chosen as the diocesan church of St George&#x27;s Cathedral, Southwark, of the new Archdiocese of Southwark, which was to cover the whole of southern England. For the next half-century, until the opening of Westminster Cathedral, St George&#x27;s was the centre of Catholic life in London. As a cathedral it actually predates by more than half a century that of the Anglican Southwark Cathedral.

<doc id="495638" wikidata="Q9023461" url="?curid=495638" title="Lockheed WC-130">
<text>The Lockheed WC-130 is a high-wing, medium-range aircraft used for weather reconnaissance missions by the United States Air Force. The aircraft is a modified version of the C-130 Hercules transport configured with specialized weather instrumentation including a dropsonde deployment/receiver system and crewed by a meteorologist for penetration of tropical cyclones and winter storms to obtain data on movement, size and intensity.

The USAF&#x27;s Air Weather Service (AWS) received its first C-130 Hercules in 1962 to conduct air sampling missions in the wake of a resumption of atmospheric weapons testing by the Soviet Union in September 1961. The Air Force was then in the process of replacing its fleet of WB-50 weather reconnaissance aircraft with WB-47E jets but by 1965 the AWS had decided it would better served by the WC-130 in the manned weather reconnaissance role. Since that year the Air Force and Air Force Reserve have operated a total of 50 WC-130s in five variants. The WC-130J Weatherbird is the current weather data collection platform for the 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron.

Only one WC-130 has been lost during operational missions, H-model 65-0965, on 12 October 1974, flying in Typhoon Bess northeast of The Philippines. A former weather recon aircraft, H-model 65-0968, was lost on 2 May 2018 while serving with the Puerto Rico Air National Guard on its final ferry flight to retirement. Two WC-130B models were lost to crashes after being sold to international customers, and another operational WC-130B aircraft was destroyed on the ground by a hurricane.

==Development==

In 1954 the Air Weather Service (AWS) replaced its WB-29 Superfortresses as its primary weather reconnaissance platform with a fleet of WB-50Ds deployed in seven squadrons. Between 1956 and 1960 six WB-50 accidents resulted in the loss of an entire crew and caused the deaths of 66 crew members; metal fatigue and other structural problems with the type was to end its service by 1965. The C-130 Hercules was desired by the AWS as the best alternative but budgetary limitations prevented the procurement of new aircraft for the mission. Headquarters Air Force had always considered aerial weather reconnaissance an expendable luxury when budget cuts were necessary or when funds were needed for expensive programs. In 1958 its desire to field a large ICBM deterrent force resulted in the shutdown of two AWS squadrons, followed by three more in March 1960. The problems with the WB-50, brought to a head in May 1960 by fuel leaks that grounded the entire 66-plane fleet, accelerated the process, which scheduled a complete phaseout by 1963. AWS fought against the decision, however, and the proposed permanent shutdown of AWS&#x27;s flying mission alarmed high-level operational commanders worldwide, including the admiral commanding the United States Pacific Command. The commander of the Strategic Air Command, General Thomas S. Power, recommended that the WB-50s be replaced by B-47s that were being phased out by SAC, and when Gen. Curtis E. LeMay gave his support for the proposal, modification of 34 WB-47Es in 1963 for the AWS was approved and the re-activation of three discontinued weather recon squadrons scheduled for 1962.

In the meantime a bilateral moratorium with the Soviet Union on the atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons was starting its third year when a suggestion was made that the classified air sampling program monitoring the moratorium and being conducted by at least five USAF commands be consolidated under a single manager and agency. AWS lobbied for the mission and submitted a plan in February 1961 naming itself the single manager. LeMay, now Air Force Chief of Staff, approved the plan on 31 August 1961; the next day the Soviet Union resumed nuclear testing. Headquarters Air Force authorized the acquisition of five new C-130Bs factory-configured for the sampling mission to be delivered in April 1962 when AWS would become the air sampling single-manager. These became the first weather-mission C-130 aircraft.

After the five C-130Bs became operational with AWS, conversions of six C-130Es followed in 1965 but as weather platforms. A dropsonde system was installed in all the C-130Bs and the designation of all C-130 weather variants was permanently changed to &quot;WC-130&quot; on 25 August 1965. Three WC-130As were created in Southeast Asia in 1967 and 11 more WC-130Bs were added in 1970 to replace the WB-47s, which had been abruptly retired from service in September 1969. The first of 15 WC-130Hs was converted in 1973 from rescue command and control aircraft (that had themselves been modified from C-130Es). Service life of some of these variants over-lapped as they operated with the 53rd, 54th, 55th and 56th Weather Reconnaissance Squadrons. The -E and -H models have had the greatest longevity in service, 28 and 32 years respectively. Of the seven original weather reconnaissance squadrons, four of which received the WC-130 at some point, only the 53d WRS remains active, now assigned to the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC).

The WC-130J model, introduced in 1999, is currently the weather reconnaissance platform for the 53rd WRS, part of the 403rd Wing of the Air Force Reserve Command at Keesler AFB, Mississippi. Many of the WC-130s replaced in the weather reconnaissance mission were subsequently redistributed after de-modification to other AFRC and Air National Guard wings for use again in their original tactical airlift role or as training aircraft, while others were sold to foreign air forces.

== Mission ==
The WC-130 provides vital tropical cyclone forecasting information and is the primary weather data collector for the National Hurricane Center, supplemented by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration&#x27;s WP-3D Orion. They penetrate tropical cyclones and hurricanes at altitudes ranging from above the ocean surface depending upon the intensity of the storm. The most important function of these reconnaissance aircraft is to collect high-density, high-accuracy weather data from within the storm&#x27;s environment. This includes penetration of the center or hurricane eye of the storm. This vital information is instantly relayed by satellite to the National Hurricane Center to aid in the accurate forecasting of hurricane movement and intensity.

== Variants and operational history ==
The Lockheed C-130 has been operated as a Weather Reconnaissance aircraft in the following sub-types:

===WC-130B (1962–1973)===
Five new C-130Bs factory-configured for air sampling were delivered to the 55th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron at McClellan Air Force Base, California, in 1962. After operational testing and evaluation, three were distributed to the 54th, 56th, and 57th WRS and the 55th deployed one of its remaining two to Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska. In 1965 all had dropsonde systems installed at the Warner Robins Air Materiel Area (WRAMA) and were transferred to the 53rd WRS at Ramey Air Force Base, Puerto Rico, for use in the Hurricane Hunter mission. The first of thousands of such missions for the just-designated WC-130 was flown on 27 August 1965 into the eye of Hurricane Betsy, the most destructive hurricane in recorded history to that time.

In the aftermath of Hurricane Camille in August 1969 and the simultaneous shutdown of the WB-47 program, funds were appropriated to fund Project &quot;Seek Cloud&quot;, an upgrade of tropical storm reconnaissance capability by an increase in C-130 platforms and an upgrade in meteorological equipment. 12 additional C-130B transports were obtained from Pacific Air Forces and modified in 1970–1971 with the new equipment suite. One was soon transferred to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) but the other 11 went into military service, three to the 54th to replace the WC-130As and the rest to the 53rd, which had transferred four of its five original B-models to other squadrons after receiving &quot;Seek Cloud&quot; retrofits. Efforts to develop forward-looking and side-looking weather radars were unsuccessful. The second batch of C-130Bs were in service only a few years before all were de-modified and turned over to the reserve forces.

The WC-130Bs were powered by four Allison T56-A-7A turboprop engines rated at , had a cruising speed of , a radius of action of with a payload of , and a service ceiling of .

===WC-130E (1965–1993)===
In 1965 the Air Force procured six E-model variants to replace six WB-47Es in the 54th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron at Anderson Air Force Base, Guam. Three veteran airlifters were transferred from the Tactical Air Command (TAC) and three obtained new. All were modified with the AMT-1 dropsonde system and assigned to the 54th WRS, where they remained until 1972. From then to 1987, when they were assigned permanently to the 53d WRS, the E-models were assigned to the operational demands of all the operational weather reconnaissance squadrons. In 1989 they were upgraded with the Improved Weather Reconnaissance System (&quot;I-Wars&quot;) utilizing the Omega Navigation System previously installed in WC-130H model and remained in regular operational service until retired in 1993.

===WC-130A (1967–1970)===
Three C-130A transports were obtained from TAC in 1966 during the Vietnam War to conduct Operation Popeye, a rain-making operation in Southeast Asia. In early 1967 they were modified for an additional weather reconnaissance mission by installation of the AMT-1 dropsonde system. Two were based for the dual missions on a rotational basis at Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand, with a third at Anderson AFB for maintenance and crew changes. Missions were flown by crews of the 54th WRS and included synoptic weather reconnaissance to all areas of SEA. All three reverted to C-130A standard in 1971 after their replacement by upgraded models.

===WC-130H (1973–2005)===

With the drawdown of U.S. participation in the war in Southeast Asia, a number of extended-range HC-130H CROWN airborne controllers assigned to the Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Service (a sister agency of the Air Weather Service in the Military Airlift Command) became excess because of budgetary reductions. With Hurricane Camille still fresh in the minds of Congress and the American public and retention of the AWS flying mission still strong in MAC Headquarters, AWS proposed to Headquarters Air Force in March 1972 that its 16 WC-130Bs be replaced by a like number of the available HC-130Hs. The request was approved in December 1972 but altered a month later. AWS was ordered to retain three of the Bs and could give up the other 13 in return for 11 HC-130Hs. $4.5 million was budgeted for WRAMA to transfer the &quot;Seek Cloud&quot; equipment from the Bs to the newer Hs, and the changeover occurred between June 1973 and July 1974. Four additional HC-130Hs were converted in 1975.

A total of 15 HC-130H rescue Hercules were eventually modified with &quot;Seek Cloud&quot; equipment and designated WC-130H, replacing all 16 WC-130Bs in the weather reconnaissance squadrons. The WC-130H was equipped with the more powerful Allison T56-A-15 turboprop engines rated at and had wing-mounted fuel tanks that provided an additional of fuel, extending the WC-130H&#x27;s radius of action at maximum cruise speed ( (KIAS), (KTAS)) to .

A contract was awarded Tracor Aerospace on 29 September 1987 to build and install 20 IWRS suites but two days later the 54th WRS was inactivated, leaving only ten WC-130s in service, seven with the 53d WRS and three in the Air Force Reserve. Even so, the IWRS system went operational in the WC-130H in 1988 and remains standard equipment.

Manned weather reconnaissance continued to be reduced when AWS finally divested itself of its flying mission in 1991 by inactivating the 53d WRS and transferring both the mission and its few remaining aircraft assets to the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC). But the devastation wrought by Hurricane Andrew in 1992 again demonstrated the need for &quot;hurricane hunting&quot; and state-of-the-art equipment to accomplish it, and the 53d was resurrected as a full-time unit of AFRC in 1993. The WC-130s were transferred back to it but the H-models were showing their age and between 1999 and 2005 all were replaced by the new, technologically-advanced J-variant.

===WC-130J (1999–present)===

The WC-130J was the first variant obtained new from the factory since 1965. Ten were procured and assigned to the 53d WRS, now the only manned weather reconnaissance unit in the Department of Defense. The new model encountered teething problems that delayed its Initial Operational Capability until just before the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. Conversion of the Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules greatly enhanced the capability and safety of the WC-130 in its penetration of tropical cyclones on critical &quot;fix&quot; missions.
The WC-130J carries a minimum crew of five: pilot/aircraft commander, co-pilot, combat systems officer, aerial reconnaissance weather officer and weather reconnaissance loadmaster. The 53d WRS maintains twenty air crews (ten full-time and ten part-time) to meet its capabilities obligations in support of requirements for the National Hurricane Operations Plan of five sorties per day from Keesler AFB and two from deployed locations. Weather data instrumentation and the dropsonde delivery and recording systems are mounted in the aircraft on removable pallets at the front end of the cargo compartment, giving the aircraft a standard cargo mission capability also.

The aircraft is not equipped for aerial refueling, but with wing-mounted auxiliary fuel tanks is capable of staying aloft almost 18 hours at an optimum cruise speed of more than . An average weather reconnaissance mission lasts 11 hours and covers almost . The crew collects and reports weather data as often as every minute.

The Aerial Reconnaissance Weather Officer operates the computerized weather reconnaissance equipment, generates the &quot;horizontal data&quot; measurements (also known as &quot;Recco&quot;), and acts as flight director inside the storm environment. The weather officer also evaluates other meteorological conditions such as turbulence, icing, visibility, cloud types and amounts, and ocean surface winds. The ARWO uses the equipment to determine the storm&#x27;s center and analyze atmospheric conditions such as pressure, temperature, dew point and wind speed to create a Vortex Data Message sent to the National Hurricane Center.

A critical piece of weather equipment on board the WC-130J is the GPS Dropsonde Windfinding System, a cylindrically-shaped instrument about long and in diameter and weighing approximately . The dropsonde is equipped with a high frequency radio and other sensing devices and is released from the aircraft over water. As the instrument descends to the sea surface, it measures and relays to the aircraft a vertical atmospheric profile of the temperature, humidity and barometric pressure and wind data. The dropsonde is slowed and stabilized by a small parachute. Through use of the Advanced Vertical Atmospheric Profiling System (AVAPS), the Dropsonde System Operator generates the &quot;vertical data&quot; (also referred to as &quot;Drops&quot;) needed by the NHC, receiving, analyzing and encoding the data for transmission by satellite.

Between May 2007 and February 2008, all ten WC-130J were equipped with the Stepped-Frequency Microwave Radiometer (SFMR or &quot;Smurf&quot;), which continuously measures the surface winds and rainfall rates below the aircraft, mounted in a radome on the right wing outboard of the number four engine.

The WC-130J provides data vital to tropical cyclone forecasting. The WC-130J usually penetrates hurricanes at an altitude of approximately to collect meteorological data in the vortex, or eye, of the storm. The aircraft normally flies a radius of about from the vortex to collect detailed data about the structure of the tropical cyclone.

The information collected makes possible advance warning of hurricanes and increases the accuracy of hurricane predictions and warnings by as much as 30%. Collected data are relayed directly to the National Hurricane Center, in Miami, Fla., a Department of Commerce weather agency that tracks hurricanes and provides warning service in the Atlantic area.

==Accidents and incidents==

*Swan 38 – On 12 October 1974, a newly modified WC-130H (65-0965) assigned to the United States Air Force&#x27;s 54th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron and its six crew disappeared during Typhoon Bess. No trace of the aircraft or its crew has ever been found.

== Operators ==

The WC-130 are exclusively operated by the United States Air Force, especially by its Air Force Reserve Command. As of May 2014, 10 are in the USAF&#x27;s inventory, all belonging to the reserve.

On September 27, 2024, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced it had awarded a contract to Lockheed Martin Aeronautics for two Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules aircraft configured for use as hurricane hunters to replace its aging Lockheed WP-3D Orion aircraft, with service entry planned in 2030.

Duffy died on June 25, 1928, and was the first person to be posthumously nominated for an Academy Award.

That same year, the first &quot;talkie&quot;, &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;, received an honorary award for introducing sound to film, and the category for which &quot;The Private Life of Helen of Troy&quot; was nominated was dropped by the second Academy Awards.

==Preservation==
Two sections from the beginning and end, running about 27–30 minutes in total, are reportedly all that survive of &quot;The Private Life of Helen of Troy&quot;; they are preserved by the British Film Institute.

<doc id="495650" wikidata="Q109868" url="?curid=495650" title="Birgit Prinz">
<text>Birgit Prinz (born 25 October 1977) is a German former footballer, two-time FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup champion and three-time FIFA World Player of the Year. In addition to the German national team, Prinz played for 1. FFC Frankfurt in the Frauen-Bundesliga as well as the Carolina Courage in the Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association (WUSA), the first professional women&#x27;s league in the United States. Prinz remains one of the game&#x27;s most prolific strikers and is the second FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup all-time leading scorer with 14 goals (second only to Marta from Brazil). In 2011, she announced the end of her active career. She currently works as a sport psychologist for the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams of Bundesliga club TSG 1899 Hoffenheim.

==Club career==
Prinz began her career at SV Dörnigheim FC. She made her Bundesliga debut for FSV Frankfurt, where she played from 1993 to 1998. During that time Prinz won two Bundesliga titles and two German Cups. In 1997 and 1998 she was the Bundesliga top scorer. In 1998, she moved to local rivals 1. FFC Frankfurt, where she has had her biggest success at club level. In 13 seasons at the club, Prinz won six Bundesliga and eight German Cup titles. She also won the Bundesliga top-scorer award twice more in 2001 and 2007. Prinz won the UEFA Women&#x27;s Cup three times with Frankfurt, in the 2001–02, 2005–06 and 2007–08 seasons. She also reached the final in 2004, but lost to the Swedish side Umeå IK.

For two seasons, Prinz joined Carolina Courage in the professional women&#x27;s league WUSA in the United States. During her short stint in America she claimed the 2002 WUSA Championship. After the 2003 World Cup, Prinz declined an offer from AC Perugia to play in Italy&#x27;s men&#x27;s Serie A, fearing her transfer would be used as a publicity stunt and she would end up on the bench.

In her time at FFC Frankfurt, Prinz won many personal awards, including a record eight German Female Footballer of the Year awards from 2001 to 2008. She was named the FIFA World Player of the Year in 2003, 2004 and 2005. For four consecutive years from 2007 to 2010 she came second, behind Brazil&#x27;s Marta.

==International career==

At the age of 16, Prinz made her debut for the Germany national team in July 1994 against Canada. She came on after 72 minutes and scored the game-winner in the 89th minute. One year later, she won her first major title at the 1995 European Championship, scoring in the final. In the same year, she was named to Germany&#x27;s squad for the 1995 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, where they lost to Norway in the final match. She remains the youngest player ever to appear in a World Cup Final.

For the next decade, Prinz had one of the most successful international careers in women&#x27;s football. She won four more UEFA European Championships in 1997, 2001, 2005 and 2009. At the Summer Olympics she won bronze three times with the German team, in 2000, 2004 and 2008. At the 2003 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, Prinz helped Germany win its first World Cup title in the women&#x27;s game. She was honoured as the tournament&#x27;s best player and top-scorer. Prinz became the women&#x27;s national team captain at the end of 2003, and remained until her retirement. Four years later, at the 2007 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, she captained the team to Germany&#x27;s second World Cup title; she was awarded the Silver Ball as the second-best player at the tournament.

Prinz holds several national and international records. With 14 goals, she is the second all-time leading goalscorer at FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cups. From 2008 until 2012, Prinz and Brazil&#x27;s Cristiane both held the tournament record of ten goals at the Summer Olympics, although Cristiane has now surpassed Prinz. For the German national team Prinz appeared 214 times and scored 128 goals, and is the team&#x27;s most capped player and top goalscorer.

==Personal life==
Prinz is a trained physical therapist. In 2010, she graduated with her master&#x27;s degree in psychology from the Goethe University Frankfurt. Since January 2012, she has worked as a sport psychologist in the youth academy, women&#x27;s U-17 and women&#x27;s Bundesliga teams at TSG 1899 Hoffenheim.

<text>In ice hockey, a goal is scored when the puck entirely crosses the goal line between the two goal posts and below the goal crossbar. A goal awards one point to the team attacking the goal scored upon, regardless of which team the player who actually deflected the puck into the goal belongs to (see also own goal). Typically, a player on the team attempting to score shoots the puck with their stick towards the goal net opening, and a player on the opposing team called a goaltender tries to block the shot to prevent a goal from being scored against their team.

The term goal may also refer to the structure in which goals are scored. The ice hockey goal is rectangular in shape; the front frame of the goal is made of steel tube painted red and consists of two vertical goalposts and a horizontal crossbar. A net is attached to the back of the frame to catch pucks that enter the goal and also to prevent pucks from entering it from behind. The entire goal is considered an inbounds area of the playing surface, and it is legal to play the puck behind the goal. Under NHL rules, the opening of the goal is wide by tall, and the footprint of the goal is deep.

==Method of scoring==

The object of the game of ice hockey is to score more goals than the opposing team. Goaltenders and defencemen are concerned primarily with keeping the other team from scoring a goal, while forwards are primarily concerned with scoring goals on the other team. Forwards also have to be defensively responsible while defencemen need to press offensively, and it is not unknown for goalies to attempt to position the puck for a counterattack, or even attempt to shoot against an unguarded net.

For a goal to be scored, the puck normally must entirely cross the goal line between the posts and under the crossbar of the goal frame. A goal is not allowed under any of the following conditions:
*the puck is sent into the goal from a stick raised above the height of the crossbar
*the puck is intentionally kicked, batted, or thrown into the net by an attacking player; a puck &quot;may &quot;deflect off an attacking player&#x27;s skate or body provided that player does not make a deliberate attempt to kick or redirect the puck with their body
*the puck enters the net directly after deflecting off an official
*the goaltender is impeded from preventing the goal by an attacking player
*the scoring shot caused the scoring team to become offside, even if the team is no longer offside at the time of the goal
*the scoring team had too many people on ice at the time of the goal
*the goal was scored with a broken stick
*the net was dislodged prior to the puck entering it
*the goaltender shoots the puck after crossing the center line (however, replacing the goaltender with an extra attacker is allowed). 
*the puck breaks into two or more pieces prior to any portion of it entering the goal.

Additionally, in many leagues, a goal does not count if a player from the attacking team has a skate or stick in the goal crease before the puck. The National Hockey League (NHL) abolished this rule starting in the 1999-2000 season after the disputed triple-overtime goal in the 1999 Stanley Cup Finals. Brett Hull of the Dallas Stars scored the series-clinching goal against the Buffalo Sabres. There are those who believe that video replay shows Hull&#x27;s skate in the crease prior to the puck.

A goal may be awarded if a player would normally be awarded a penalty shot, but the opposing team had substituted a skater for a goaltender. In such rare cases, a goal is awarded rather than allowing a penalty shot attempt on an empty goal net.

==Credit for goals and assists==
Typically, the last player on the goal-scoring team to touch the puck before it goes into the net is credited with scoring that goal. Zero, one, or two other players on the goal-scoring team may also credited with an assist for helping their teammate to score the goal. If another player on the goal-scoring team touched the puck to help score the goal before the goal-scoring player touched it without an opposing player intervening (touching the puck in between), then that player gets an assist. If yet another player on the goal-scoring team also touched the puck before that without an opposing player intervening, then that player also gets an assist.

For a hockey player, a goal or an assist credited to them is also considered a point; thus the number of goals scored by that player plus the number of assists for them equals the number of points for that player. However, a rule says that only one point can be credited to any one player on a goal scored. This means one player cannot be credited with a goal and an assist for the same goal scored; instead the player would only get credit for a goal and a different player may get credit for an assist, if applicable. It also means that one player cannot be credited with two assists for the same goal scored; instead the player would only get credit for one assist and a different player may get credit for the other assist, if applicable.

Usually on a hockey team, forwards score the most goals and get the most points, although defensemen can score goals and often get assists. In professional play, goaltenders only occasionally get an assist, and only very rarely score a goal when the opposite net is empty (without a goaltender).

==Scoring statistics==
The number of goals scored is a closely watched statistic. Each year the Rocket Richard Trophy is presented to the NHL player to have scored the most goals. The trophy is named after Maurice Richard, the first player to score 50 goals in a season, at a time when the NHL regular season was only 50 games (compared to 82 today). The player to have scored the most goals in an NHL season is Wayne Gretzky. Gretzky is also the fastest to 50 goals; during his record-setting 1981–82 season, in which he finished with 92 goals, he scored his 50th goal in the Edmonton Oilers&#x27; 39th game of the season.

The overall amount of goal scoring is also closely watched. In recent years, goal scoring has decreased. Many believe the game is less entertaining because of this, and blame the change on the increasing size of goaltending equipment and the advent of defensive systems such as the neutral zone trap. Fans of defensive hockey counter by saying the high scoring of the 1980s was an anomaly, and this shift represents a return to the norm. For the 2004-05 American Hockey League season, four major rule changes were made that were intended to increase the scoring in games and make it more popular among casual fans:

# increasing the size of the attack zones by narrowing the neutral zone two feet each side and thus moving the goal line back two feet
# restrictions on the goaltender playing the puck
# permitting offside players to negate the penalty by &quot;tagging up&quot; with the blue line
# changing the offside rule by permitting passes which cross the center line and one blue line (but not between both blue lines in certain restrictions).

The AHL rules were slightly modified and adopted in the NHL and ECHL for 2005-06, when the NHL returned after the 2004–05 lockout.

==Types of goals==

There are a number of different types of goals for which separate statistics are kept, but all count equally:

* An &quot;even strength goal&quot; is a goal scored when both teams have the same number of players on the ice.
* A &quot;power play goal&quot; (PPG) is a goal scored by a team on a power play, that is, with a numerical advantage in players due to a penalty being served by one or more of the other team&#x27;s players.
* A &quot;shorthanded goal&quot; (SHG) is a goal scored by a team that is on the penalty kill, that is, at a numerical disadvantage due to a penalty being served by one or more of its players
* An &quot;empty net goal&quot; (ENG) is a goal scored when there is no goalie guarding the net because he has been pulled for an extra attacker
* A &quot;penalty shot goal&quot; is a goal scored on a penalty shot, that is, a one-on-one confrontation between a single offensive player and the goaltender as a result of a penalty
* An &quot;awarded goal&quot; is a goal that is automatically awarded when a goalie has been pulled and their team commits a foul that would otherwise have triggered a penalty shot
* An &quot;own goal&quot; is when a player puts the puck into their own net, scoring for the other team, giving goal credit to the last player on the other team to touch the puck
* An &quot;overtime goal&quot; is a goal scored in sudden-death overtime
* A &quot;go-ahead goal&quot; is the goal that puts one team ahead of another after the game has been tied
* A &quot;game-tying goal&quot; or an &quot;equaliser&quot; is a goal that causes the game to be tied, scored by a team that is down one goal (prior to the 1984-85 season, the NHL credited game-tying goals to the final scorers for both teams in tie games).
* A &quot;game-winning goal&quot; (GWG) is the goal scored to put the winning team in excess of the losing team&#x27;s final score, e.g., if the score is 4–2, the game-winning goal would be the third goal scored for the winning team.

==Related terms==

The goal judge is an official positioned off-ice behind each goal for the specific purpose of indicating when the puck has crossed the goal line and entered the goal. For arenas so equipped, the goal judge turns on a red light behind the goal when they see the puck cross the goal line. As in all matters, however, the referee retains final authority and can override the opinion of the goal judge.

The two teammates of the scorer who last touched the puck before them, provided that no opponent touched it in between, are each credited with an assist. Assists and goals count equally to comprise a player&#x27;s statistical scoring total.

If a hockey player causes the puck to enter their own team&#x27;s net — which in soccer is called an &quot;own goal&quot; — credit for the goal goes to the last player on the scoring team to have touched the puck. No assists are awarded. If a shot deflects off a defender and enters the net, it is not considered an own goal.

Other phrases include a &quot;garbage goal&quot;, for a goal scored more as the result of luck or opportunism than skill, and a &quot;breakaway goal&quot; for a goal scored when a player has gotten behind the defenders to face the goaltender alone.

When a player scores three goals in a game it is known as a hat-trick. A &quot;natural hat trick&quot; occurs when a player scores three consecutive goals, uninterrupted by any other player scoring for either team. A &quot;Gordie Howe hat trick&quot; occurs when a player scores a goal, gets an assist and gets in a fight.

Any puck heading towards the net is counted as a shot. When the goaltender prevents the shot from entering the net, they are credited with a save. Shots resulting in saves by the goaltender or goals scored are considered shots on goal (or shots on net). A shot which is blocked by an opposing player before it reaches the goaltender is not considered a shot on net. Also, if the puck is deflected wide of the net by another player (regardless of team) it is not counted as a shot on net. If a goaltender traps the puck that was heading towards the goal, but wide, it is often not counted as a shot; nor are shots that bounce off the crossbar or posts.

==Goal horn==
The trend of sounding a horn when the home team scores a goal originated in the 1973 Stanley Cup Finals between the Montreal Canadiens and the Chicago Black Hawks. Black Hawks owner Bill Wirtz had the horn of his yacht installed in the team’s home arena, Chicago Stadium, and had it sound after Black Hawks goals. This practice become commonplace in professional hockey. In 2022, all goal horns are paired with a song. Some notable ones include &quot;Lithium&quot; by Nirvana used by the Seattle Kraken, The Fratellis&#x27; &quot;Chelsea Dagger&quot; used by the Chicago Blackhawks, Tim McGraw&#x27;s &quot;I Like It, I Love It&quot;, which has a couple words substituted to fit the Nashville Predators, and Ray Castoldi, the music director and organist and Madison Square Garden&#x27;s &quot;Slapshot&quot;, a song used by the New York Rangers since 1995. The Washington Capitals use personalized goal songs chosen by each player - examples include Alexander Ovechkin using &quot;Shake, Rattle and Roll&quot; for his goals and Aliaksei Protas using &quot;How Much Is the Fish?&quot;.

<doc id="495653" wikidata="Q2005321" url="?curid=495653" title="Scandinavian defence union">
<text>The Scandinavian defence union was a historical idea to establish a military alliance between Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark after the end of World War II, but the idea did not come about when Denmark, Iceland and Norway joined NATO in 1949 at the request of the United States, while Finland and Sweden then did not.

Historically, Finland had fought two wars against the Soviet Union, Denmark and Norway had been occupied by Germany between 1940 and 1945, and Sweden, having been a neutral state throughout the war, had still felt the effects on either side. 

In the 2000s, military cooperation between the Nordic nations increased, especially through Nordefco. It has generally not been regarded as a mutual defence union, but since the 2010s an increasing number of defence agreements were implemented. In 2022, Finland and Sweden requested to join NATO. 

The governments of the three Nordic NATO members released statements saying that they would use all necessary means in the defence of Finland and Sweden if they were attacked before they became members. Finland became a member of NATO on 4 April 2023 and Sweden on 7 March 2024.

==National positions and chosen strategies==
=== Finland ===
Finland had fought two wars, the Winter War and the Continuation War, against the Soviet Union; and also one minor war, the Lapland War, against Nazi Germany. Before these wars Finland had close relations with the Scandinavian countries. After the Continuation War where the Soviet Union forced Finland to sue for peace, but failed in its goal of conquering and annexing the country (in a manner similar to the Baltic States), 

Finland became neutral and retained a democratic government and a market economy. However, as the country shared 1,300 kilometres of border with the USSR, the position of the Soviet Union could not be ignored in Finnish politics. Regarding the Finnish membership in the Scandinavian defence union, far reaching discussions at state-level were made with the other candidate countries. 

These discussions were abruptly ended, when Sweden made a specific requirement, that approval from the Soviet Union must be received if Finland was to join. The Soviet answer was bluntly negative and Finland stayed neutral. In 1948, Finland had signed the Agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance with the Soviet Union, and according to the Soviet point of view, this agreement prohibited Finland&#x27;s membership in any alliances that it could consider being of military nature, even in those created for defensive reasons.

=== Denmark and Iceland ===
Both Denmark and Iceland showed a clear preference for joining the Scandinavian Defence Union over NATO. According to a 2018 literature review, the reasons why Danes preferred a Scandinavian military alliance over a North-Atlantic one were &quot;ideology (pan-Scandinavianism), the domestic political situation, a strong belief in Swedish military power, and, especially given the different policies of the three Nordic countries, various lessons drawn from the Second World War.&quot;

=== Norway and Denmark ===
The proposed union was discussed by a joint Scandinavian committee during the winter of 1948-1949, but the Cold War tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union, and preparations for a western alliance that would result in the North Atlantic Treaty proved that the efforts were in vain. When it became known that the western alliance would not be able to supply the Scandinavian countries with armaments before meeting their own pressing needs, this issue ultimately proved to be the turning point for Norway, which resigned from the talks. Denmark was still willing to enter into an alliance with Sweden, but the Swedes saw few advantages in this and the proposal failed. Norway and Denmark subsequently became signatory parties of the North Atlantic Treaty and members of NATO.

=== Sweden ===
Sweden chose not to join NATO, despite a fierce debate on the issue. One of the strongest proponents was Herbert Tingsten, editor-in-chief of &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot;, the largest newspaper in Sweden, who used editorials to argue why Sweden should join. He found a great opponent in the foreign minister of the time Östen Undén, who argued that Sweden should stay non-aligned and remain neutral in case of war. The position of Sweden as a member of the western world was not in doubt, but it could not, based on the choices it had made on foreign policy, join the western military alliance.

==Later developments==
=== Nordic Battlegroup ===

Whilst not a defence union, the Nordic Battlegroup is a multi-national military unit. It is one of eighteen European Union Battlegroups that support European Union defence and security objectives. It consists of around 2,500 troops from Sweden, Finland, Norway, Ireland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.

===Nordic Defence Cooperation===

The Nordic Defence Cooperation (Nordefco) is an ad-hoc collaboration established between the Nordic countries in 2009 for finding common solutions, strengthening the national defences and increasing cooperation between them. It has not generally been seen as a mutual defence pact and it is not regarded as a command structure, but its members have increasingly added features that show some resemblance to a defence pact. In 2021, the defence ministers of Denmark, Norway and Sweden signed an agreement of increased cooperation among their militaries with a coordination structure that would make it easier to &quot;act together in peace, crisis or conflict&quot; in the southern Nordic region, and in 2022 it was agreed to further enhance the capabilities by allowing access to each other&#x27;s airspace and military infrastructure. 

A similar agreement for the northern Nordic region already existed between Finland, Norway and Sweden, which was further updated in 2022. Following Finland&#x27;s and Sweden&#x27;s request to join NATO, Denmark, Iceland and Norway released a statement saying that in the case of an attack on Finland or Sweden before they had become part of NATO, all necessary means would be used to help in their defence. Finland became a member of NATO on 4 April 2023. and Sweden on 7 March 2024.

<doc id="495658" wikidata="Q1931410" url="?curid=495658" title="Somethin' Else (Cannonball Adderley album)">
<text>Somethin&#x27; Else is an album by American jazz saxophonist Julian &quot;Cannonball&quot; Adderley, recorded on March 9, 1958 and released on Blue Note in August later that year—his only album for the label. Also on the session is trumpeter Miles Davis in one of his handful of recording dates for Blue Note. Adderley was a member of Davis&#x27; group at the time, and the album was recorded shortly after Davis&#x27; own landmark album &quot;Milestones&quot;.

==Background==
The album was recorded during Adderley&#x27;s membership in the Miles Davis&#x27; First Great Quintet, and it also marks one of the few recordings Davis made as a sideman after 1955. Indeed, Davis plays several of the first solos, composed the bluesy title track and, according to the liner notes, chose most of the material. &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; would remain in the Davis book, and &quot;Love for Sale&quot; would be recorded by the Davis Sextet a little over two months later. Miles, as quoted in the original liner notes, recounted, &quot;All my inspiration today comes from Ahmad Jamal, the Chicago pianist. I got the idea for this treatment of &#x27;Autumn Leaves&#x27; from him.&quot;

The twelve-bar blues &quot;One for Daddy-O&quot; was written by Adderley&#x27;s brother Nat for Chicago radio DJ Holmes &quot;Daddy-O&quot; Daylie. At the end of that track, Davis can be heard addressing producer Alfred Lion, saying &quot;is that what you wanted, Alfred?&quot;

=== &quot;Bangoon&quot; ===
In the 1980s, the album was re-issued with a bonus track from the recording session that was listed as &quot;Alison&#x27;s Uncle&quot; and credited to Cannonball Adderley. The track appeared as &quot;Alison&#x27;s Uncle&quot; on compact disc releases in the U.S. and Japan in 1986, and it continued to appear under this title, or as &quot;Bangoon (aka Alison&#x27;s Uncle)&quot;, on reissues into the 21st century. The composition is actually Hank Jones&#x27; &quot;Bangoon&quot;, and first appeared on Gigi Gryce&#x27;s 1957 Jubilee Records album &quot;Jazz Lab&quot;, with Jones playing piano. (Gryce also recorded a second version of the tune with Jones on his &quot;Gigi Gryce&quot; album.) The title &quot;Alison&#x27;s Uncle&quot; was created by Nat Adderley in the 1980s when he was asked by reissue producers to name a track that they could not identify. Nat Adderley&#x27;s alternate title refers to the session having taken shortly after his daughter Alison had been born.

== Reception ==
&quot;The Penguin Guide to Jazz&quot; selected &quot;Somethin&#x27; Else&quot; as part of its suggested &quot;Core Collection.&quot;

<text>The Elan Valley Reservoirs () are a chain of man-made lakes created from damming the Elan and Claerwen rivers within the Elan Valley in Mid Wales. The reservoirs, which were built by the Birmingham Corporation Water Department, provide clean drinking water for Birmingham in the West Midlands of England. The five lakes are known as the Claerwen, Craig-goch, Pen-y-garreg, Garreg-ddu, and Caban-coch.

Water from the reservoirs is carried by gravity to Frankley Reservoir in Birmingham via the Elan aqueduct. Pumping is not required because the network drops along its length from its source to Frankley. A gradient of 1:2,300 maintains a flow of less than ; water takes one and a half to two days to reach Birmingham. The aqueduct, which was started in 1896 and opened in 1906, crosses several valleys and features numerous brick tunnels, pipelines, and valve houses.

Work to build the Elan Valley reservoirs was undertaken because the rapid growth of the industrial city of Birmingham in the late 19th century had led to a lack of available clean water. Numerous outbreaks of disease prompted Birmingham City Council to petition the British government which passed the Birmingham Corporation Water Act in 1892. It allowed the corporation to acquire by compulsory purchase all the land within the water catchment area of the Elan Valleys. Thousands of navvies (workers) and their families lived in the purpose-built Elan Village during the construction of the first four dams at the turn of the 20th century. In 1952, the Claerwen dam was opened by Elizabeth II in one of her first official engagements as monarch.

Drinking water from the Elan Valley is noted for being exceptionally soft, contrasting with water from local supplies in the West Midlands, not served by the Elan aqueduct, which are noted for hardness.

The reservoirs are now owned and managed by Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water. The water filtration works further down the valley is run by Severn Trent Water.

== Description ==
There are four main dams and reservoirs (constructed 1893–1904 in Elan Valley, and 1946–1952 at Claerwen) with a potential total capacity of nearly 100,000 megalitres. The dams and reservoirs are:
*Caban-coch – 35,530 megalitre capacity
*Pen-y-garreg – 6,055 megalitre capacity
*Craig-goch – 9,220 megalitre capacity
*Claerwen – 48,694 megalitre capacity

In addition to the four main dams, there are three other dams at the site:
*The Dol-y-mynach dam – it was to be one of a series of three dams that would be built to contain the waters of Afon Claerwen. They were to be constructed in accordance with the growth of Birmingham. However, the project was never completed even though the masonry foundations of the first dam were laid at the same time the Elan Valley dams were being constructed. The work had to be done in advance because the water level of the Caban Coch would have submerged the site once the reservoir was full. The three-dam project became redundant when newer materials and superior engineering allowed the construction of the single larger Claerwen dam higher up the valley in the 1940/50s.
*The Nant-y-Gro dam – this small dam was constructed in the early stages of the project to supply water to the navvies&#x27; village at the site; it was used during the Second World War by Sir Barnes Wallis during trials of the explosive charges he intended to use in the bouncing bombs which later targeted the Ruhr dams in Germany.
*The Garreg-ddu dam – although looking like a viaduct, it is actually a submerged dam. Its role is to maintain a sufficient level in the Garreg-ddu reservoir so water can enter the Foel Tower and the gravity-driven aqueduct to the Frankley Reservoir in Birmingham. The dam is only required to operate during times of extreme drought.

== History ==

===Construction===

The Elan dam scheme was developed in the 19th century following rapid growth of the population of Birmingham due to the Industrial Revolution. The city&#x27;s expansion resulted in regular outbreaks of water-borne diseases and major epidemics such as typhoid, cholera and dysentery due to the lack of clean water.

Victorian politician Joseph Chamberlain, the leader of Birmingham City Council, began a campaign to get clean water from the Elan and Claerwen valleys in mid Wales. The area, which had been identified by civil engineer James Mansergh, would be ideal for water reservoirs because:
#it had an average annual rainfall of .
#dams could be easily built in the narrow valleys.
#the bedrock was impermeable to water.
#there was no need for pumping stations because the reservoirs in Wales would be above the water cisterns in Birmingham.

In 1892, Parliament passed the Birmingham Corporation Water Act allowing the Corporation to effect compulsory purchase of the total water catchment area of the Elan and Claerwen valleys (approximately . The Act also gave Birmingham Corporation powers to move more than 100 people living in the Elan Valley. All the buildings were demolished; these included three manor houses (two of which had links with the English Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley in 1812), 18 farms, a school and a church (which was replaced with Nantgwyllt Church). Only landowners were given compensation.

Work began to construct the reservoirs the following year in 1893. Construction was overseen by James Mansergh, on behalf of the City of Birmingham&#x27;s Water Department. Due to the height above sea level of the Elan Valley, water would be fed to Birmingham along a pipeline that employed a gravity feed with a gradient of 1 in 2,300. The schedule for the project was to build the four lower Elan Valley dams first. The Claerwen would then be built later (work was expected to begin in 1939 but was delayed by the Second World War; it was completed in 1952).

====Mineral railway====
The Elan Valley Railway, which was a standard-gauge line, was built by Birmingham Corporation especially for the project. It ran through the Elan Valley from a junction near Rhayader on the Mid-Wales Railway. The first section to be built was a branch from the main line at Rhayader to the main work site at the Caban-coch dam. This depot included a cement cooling shed, general stores, coal storage, workshops for carpenters, smiths, fitters and wagon builders, and sawmills. Further branches were eventually built to all the other dam sites. Engines and trucks reached the top of the dams on wooden trestle scaffolds supported by concrete parapets. The line went as far as the site where the foundations of the Dol-y-mynach dam were being built (lower down the valley from the later Claerwen dam). At its height, the railway had a total length of with six locomotives transporting up to 1,000 tons of materials a day. Following the completion of the lower dams, the entire Elan Valley Railway had been entirely lifted by 1916. 
Road transport was used when the Claerwen dam was built in the late 1940s and 1950s.

The railway was required because the core of the Caban-coch, Pen-y-garreg and Craig-goch dams were built from large irregular stone blocks (&quot;plums&quot;) embedded in concrete. The rock was mined locally from Cigfran and Craig-cnwch quarries by the Elan River and the Aberdeuddwr quarry on Cerrig Gwynion, just to the south of Rhayader. The shaped stones were hauled by locomotive to the dam sites on flatbed trucks. They were then lowered into place by steam crane. The central cores of the dams were encased with a concrete lining. The outside walls were faced with cut stone brought from quarries at Llanelwedd near Builth Wells and Pontypridd. The cement, which was made near Chatham in Kent, was sent by sea to Aberystwyth and brought by railway to the Elan Valley.

The cost of the Elan valley scheme ran over budget because of the failure to find suitable building stone near any of the dams apart from Caban-coch, as well as the necessity of bringing in facing stone from other quarries in mid and south Wales.

====Workers&#x27; village====
During the ten-year project to build the Elan Valley dams, the navvies lived in a village of wooden huts near the site. This settlement, which was strictly controlled to keep order and health, would eventually become Elan Village (see Elan Valley). Guards controlled access in and out; this was done to reduce illness and to stop liquor smuggling. All new workers were deloused and examined for infectious diseases before being admitted. To keep order, a man and his wife shared a terrace house with eight single men. A school was provided for under-11-year-olds, who were expected to work on attaining that age. The camp also had a hospital for injuries, an isolation hospital for infectious cases, and a bath house. Men were allowed to drink beer at a pub, though women were not. Other facilities included a library, public hall, shop and canteen.

====Hydro-electricity====
Electric street lighting in the construction village was powered by hydroelectric generators. A century later, small-scale hydro-generation was again introduced as a by-product of some of the Elan Valley reservoirs. , a renewable-energy firm, Infinis, is operating five water turbines in the district with a combined capacity of about 4 MW.

====Opening and later progress====
The project to supply water to Birmingham was officially opened by King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra on 21 July 1904. As the first four dams provided enough drinking water to meet Birmingham&#x27;s needs in the early 20th century, it was proposed not to proceed with the damming of the River Claerwen at Dol-y-mynach, Ciloerwynt and Pant-y-beddau until the 1930s.

However, that phase of construction was postponed due to the outbreak of the Second World War. It was not until 1946 that work began on damming the Claerwen. Plans to build the Dol-y-mynach, Ciloerwynt and Pant-y-beddau dams were dropped because of improvements in civil engineering and materials. Instead, work began on a single, much larger, concrete dam higher up the valley. As its designers wanted the Claerwen dam to visually match the earlier dams in the Elan Valley, Italian stonemasons were contracted to decorate the facade in a mock Victorian ashlar. Queen Elizabeth II officially opened Claerwen Reservoir in 1952 in one of her first engagements as monarch.

A scale model of the reservoir network, in the form of ornamental ponds, is located in Cannon Hill Park in Birmingham.

===Dam Busters ===

In 1942, the Nant-y-Gro dam, which had been originally built to provide water for the navvies&#x27; village, was used by Barnes Wallis to prove his theory that an underwater explosion could create sufficient hydrostatic pressure to collapse a dam wall. The test proved successful as a significant breach in the middle of the dam wall was caused by a charge placed at its base.

The lessons learned at Nant-y-Gro green lit the development of the &quot;Upkeep&quot; bouncing bombs. They were used in the 1943 Dam Busters raid when RAF Bomber Command breached and damaged several dams in the Ruhr Valley, Germany.

The remains of the breached Nant-y-Gro dam are in much the same state as it was left in 1942, although partly obscured by trees.

After the Dam Busters raid, steel cables were strung across the valley above the Caban-coch reservoir as a precautionary measure against German reprisals.

=== Aborted expansion scheme ===
In the early 1970s, it was proposed that the Craig-goch reservoir should be substantially increased in size with a new and higher downstream dam together with another dam to the north-west, impounding water that would otherwise have flowed down the Ystwyth valley. This scheme would have created a huge reservoir dwarfing all others in Mid Wales, and flooding miles of wild upland valleys. The proposals were eventually abandoned in the face of reducing projections for industrial water demand and an increasing awareness of the environmental issues that such an expansion might create.

== In popular culture ==
* Elizabeth Clarke wrote &quot;The Valley&quot; (published by Faber &amp; Faber, 1969) an account of Welsh hill farming life in the valley between the two main periods of construction. Many references are made to the dams, as well as an account of the later enquiry from the hill farmers&#x27; point of view.
* Francis Brett Young researched the Elan Valley as the basis for his novel &quot;The House under the Water&quot; [Heinemann, 1932] imagining how the scene may have appeared in 1887.

<text>The piapiac (Ptilostomus afer) is an African bird in the crow family, and is the only member of the genus Ptilostomus. It is most closely related to the Central Asian ground jays.

==Taxonomy==
In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the piapiac in his &quot;Ornithologie&quot; based on a specimen collected in Senegal. He used the French name &quot;La pie du Sénégal&quot; and the Latin &quot;Pica Senegalensis&quot;. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the piapiac. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Corvus afer&quot; and cited Brisson&#x27;s work. The specific name &quot;afer&quot; is Latin for &quot;Africa&quot;. The piapiac is the only species placed in the genus &quot;Ptilostomus&quot; that was introduced by the English naturalist William Swainson in 1837. The species is monotypic.

A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2005 found that the piapiac from Africa was most closely related to the ground jays in the genus &quot;Podoces&quot; that inhabit Central Asia.

In size it is a little smaller and slimmer than the European magpie (&quot;Pica pica&quot;) though the bill is relatively thicker. It is in length and weighs . The overall colouring is black with the feathers quite silky in texture and having a purplish gloss in good light. The base of the tail tends to be more brown in colour than the rest of the body. Unusual for a passerine it has 10 rather than 12 tail feathers. The nasal plumes are somewhat upturned on top of the bill but fully cover the nostrils. The bill itself is black in the adult but partly reddish-pink towards the base in juvenile specimens. The bird&#x27;s legs and feet are black and the iris is variable, but tends towards violet, purple or mauve with a bluish-purple outer ring. The voice is usually described as a shrill squeaking often with the jackdaw-like overtones. There is also a croaking alarm call given in anger where the head bobs.

==Distribution and habitat==
The range of the species is the tropical equatorial region of central Africa from Senegal on the west coast, eastwards in a broad band to Sudan and southern Ethiopia. Within this range, its favoured habitat is towards more open country of cultivated land with fields and pasture and small associated towns and villages.

==Behaviour==

===Feeding===
Food is obtained in flocks of ten or more birds moving together on the ground including insects and other invertebrates but will take a degree of carrion, possibly attracted as much by the associated insects this attracts as much as the meat itself. Some fruit is also taken in trees, with the oily fruit of the oil palm (&quot;Elaeis guineensis&quot;) being a favourite. Able to run fast with some agility, it tends to hop at slower speed and will catch insects disturbed by the feet of cattle, sometimes hitching a ride on their backs and darting out to catch the prey.

===Breeding===
The piapiac often nests in a palm tree, but other nesting sites are also used. Strips of palm leaf and grass stems are cemented together with mud and lined with palm fibre to form a cup, in which three to seven eggs are laid between March and April. Piapiac eggs are very pale blue, or greenish-blue with a few brown blotches.

<text>Information overload (also known as infobesity, infoxication, or information anxiety) is the difficulty in understanding an issue and effectively making decisions when one has too much information (TMI) about that issue, and is generally associated with the excessive quantity of daily information. The term &quot;information overload&quot; was first used as early as 1962 by scholars in management and information studies, including in Bertram Gross&#x27; 1964 book &quot;The Managing of Organizations&quot; and was further popularized by Alvin Toffler in his bestselling 1970 book &quot;Future Shock.&quot; Speier et al. (1999) said that if input exceeds the processing capacity, information overload occurs, which is likely to reduce the quality of the decisions.

In a newer definition, Roetzel (2019) focuses on time and resources aspects. He states that when a decision-maker is given many sets of information, such as complexity, amount, and contradiction, the quality of its decision is decreased because of the individual&#x27;s limitation of scarce resources to process all the information and optimally make the best decision.

The advent of modern information technology has been a primary driver of information overload on multiple fronts: in quantity produced, ease of dissemination, and breadth of the audience reached. Longstanding technological factors have been further intensified by the rise of social media including the attention economy, which facilitates attention theft. In the age of connective digital technologies, informatics, the Internet culture (or the digital culture), information overload is associated with over-exposure, excessive viewing of information, and input abundance of information and data.

== Origin of the term ==
Even though information overload is linked to digital cultures and technologies, Ann Blair notes that the term itself predates modern technologies, as indications of information overload were apparent when humans began collecting manuscripts, collecting, recording, and preserving information. One of the first social scientists to notice the negative effects of information overload was the sociologist Georg Simmel (1858–1918), who hypothesized that the overload of sensations in the modern urban world caused city dwellers to become jaded and interfered with their ability to react to new situations. The social psychologist Stanley Milgram (1933–1984) later used the concept of information overload to explain bystander behavior.

Psychologists have recognized for many years that humans have a limited capacity to store current information in memory. Psychologist George Armitage Miller was very influential in this regard, proposing that people can process about seven chunks of information at a time. Miller says that under overload conditions, people become confused and are likely to make poorer decisions based on the information they have received as opposed to making informed ones.

A quite early example of the term &quot;information overload&quot; can be found in an article by Jacob Jacoby, Donald Speller and Carol Kohn Berning, who conducted an experiment on 192 housewives which was said to confirm the hypothesis that more information about brands would lead to poorer decision making.

Long before that, the concept was introduced by Diderot, although it was not by the term &quot;information overload&quot;:

In the internet age, the term &quot;information overload&quot; has evolved into phrases such as &quot;information glut&quot;, &quot;data smog&quot;, and &quot;data glut&quot; (&quot;Data Smog&quot;, Shenk, 1997). In his abstract, Kazi Mostak Gausul Hoq commented that people often experience an &quot;information glut&quot; whenever they struggle with locating information from print, online, or digital sources. What was once a term grounded in cognitive psychology has evolved into a rich metaphor used outside the world of academia.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
Information overload has been documented throughout periods where advances in technology have increased a production of information. As early as the 3rd or 4th century BC, people regarded information overload with disapproval. Around this time, in Ecclesiastes 12:12, the passage revealed the writer&#x27;s comment &quot;of making books there is no end&quot; and in the 1st century AD, Seneca the Elder commented, that &quot;the abundance of books is distraction&quot;. In 1255, the Dominican Vincent of Beauvais, also commented on the flood of information: &quot;the multitude of books, the shortness of time and the slipperiness of memory.&quot; Similar complaints around the growth of books were also mentioned in China. There were also information enthusiasts. The Library of Alexandria was established around the 3rd century BCE or 1st century Rome, which introduced acts of preserving historical artifacts. Museums and libraries established universal grounds of preserving the past for the future, but much like books, libraries were only granted with limited access.

=== Renaissance ===
Renaissance humanists always had a desire to preserve their writings and observations, but were only able to record ancient texts by hand because books were expensive and only the privileged and educated could afford them. Humans experience an overload in information by excessively copying ancient manuscripts and replicating artifacts, creating libraries and museums that have remained in the present. Around 1453 AD, Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press and this marked another period of information proliferation. As a result of lowering production costs, generation of printed materials ranging from pamphlets, manuscripts to books were made available to the average person.

Following Gutenberg&#x27;s invention, the introduction of mass printing began in Western Europe. Information overload was often experienced by the affluent, but the circulation of books were becoming rapidly printed and available at a lower cost, allowing the educated to purchase books. Information became recordable, by hand, and could be easily memorized for future storage and accessibility. This era marked a time where inventive methods were established to practice information accumulation. Aside from printing books and passage recording, encyclopedias and alphabetical indexes were introduced, enabling people to save and bookmark information for retrieval. These practices marked both present and future acts of information processing.

Swiss scientist Conrad Gessner commented on the increasing number of libraries and printed books, and was most likely the first academic who discussed the consequences of information overload as he observed how &quot;unmanageable&quot; information came to be after the creation of the printing press.

Blair notes that while scholars were elated with the number of books available to them, they also later experienced fatigue with the amount of excessive information that was readily available and overpopulated them. Scholars complained about the abundance of information for a variety of reasons, such as the diminishing quality of text as printers rushed to print manuscripts and the supply of new information being distracting and difficult to manage. Erasmus, one of the many recognized humanists of the 16th century asked, &quot;Is there anywhere on earth exempt from these swarms of new books?&quot;.

=== 18th century ===
Many grew concerned with the rise of books in Europe, especially in England, France, and Germany. From 1750 to 1800, there was a 150% increase in the production of books. In 1795, German bookseller and publisher Johann Georg Heinzmann said &quot;no nation printed as much as the Germans&quot; and expressed concern about Germans reading ideas and no longer creating original thoughts and ideas.

To combat information overload, scholars developed their own information records for easier and simply archival access and retrieval. Modern Europe compilers used paper and glue to cut specific notes and passages from a book and pasted them to a new sheet for storage. Carl Linnaeus developed paper slips, often called his botanical paper slips, from 1767 to 1773, to record his observations. Blair argues that these botanical paper slips gave birth to the &quot;taxonomical system&quot; that has endured to the present, influencing both the mass inventions of the index card and the library card catalog.

=== Information Age ===
In his book, &quot;The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood,&quot; published in 2011, author James Gleick notes that engineers began taking note of the concept of information, quickly associated it in a technical sense: information was both quantifiable and measurable. He discusses how information theory was created to first bridge mathematics, engineering, and computing together, creating an information code between the fields. English speakers from Europe often equated &quot;computer science&quot; to &quot;&quot;informatique&quot;, &quot;informatica&quot;, and &quot;Informatik&quot;&quot;. This leads to the idea that all information can be saved and stored on computers, even if information experiences entropy. But at the same time, the term information, and its many definitions have changed.

In the second half of the 20th century, advances in computer and information technology led to the creation of the Internet.

In the modern Information Age, information overload is experienced as distracting and unmanageable information such as email spam, email notifications, instant messages, Tweets and Facebook updates in the context of the work environment. Social media has resulted in &quot;social information overload&quot;, which can occur on sites like Facebook, and technology is changing to serve our social culture.

In today&#x27;s society, day-to-day activities increasingly involve the technological world where information technology exacerbates the number of interruptions that occur in the work environment. Management may be even more disrupted in their decision making, and may result in more poor decisions. Thus, the &quot;PIECES&quot; framework mentions information overload as a potential problem in existing information systems.

As the world moves into a new era of globalization, an increasing number of people connect to the internet to conduct their own research and are given the ability to contribute to publicly accessible data. This has elevated the risk for the spread of misinformation.

In a 2018 literature review, Roetzel indicates that information overload can be seen as a virus—spreading through (social) media and news networks.

The latest research hypothesizes that information overload is a multilevel phenomenon, i.e., there are different mechanisms responsible for its emergence at the individual, group, and the whole society levels, however, these levels are interlinked.

== General causes ==

In a piece published by &quot;Slate&quot;, Vaughan Bell argues that &quot;Worries about information overload are as old as information itself&quot; because each generation and century will inevitably experience a significant impact with technology. In the 21st century, Frank Furedi describes how an overload in information is metaphorically expressed as a flood, which is an indication that humanity is being &quot;drowned&quot; by the waves of data coming at it. This includes how the human brain continues to process information whether digitally or not. Information overload can lead to &quot;information anxiety&quot;, which is the gap between the information that is understood and the information that it is perceived must be understood. The phenomenon of information overload is connected to the field of information technology (IT). IT corporate management implements training to &quot;improve the productivity of knowledge workers&quot;. Ali F. Farhoomand and Don H. Drury note that employees often experience an overload in information whenever they have difficulty absorbing and assimilating the information they receive to efficiently complete a task because they feel burdened, stressed, and overwhelmed.

At New York&#x27;s Web 2.0 Expo in 2008, Clay Shirky&#x27;s speech indicated that information overload in the modern age is a consequence of a deeper problem, which he calls &quot;filter failure&quot;, where humans continue to overshare information with each other. This is due to the rapid rise of apps and unlimited wireless access. In the modern information age, information overload is experienced as distracting and unmanageable information such as email spam, email notifications, instant messages, Tweets, and Facebook updates in the context of the work environment. Social media has resulted in &quot;social information overload&quot;, which can occur on sites like Facebook, and technology is changing to serve our social culture. As people view increasing amounts of information in the form of news stories, emails, blog posts, Facebook statuses, Tweets, Tumblr posts and other new sources of information, they become their own editors, gatekeepers, and aggregators of information. Social media platforms create a distraction as users attention spans are challenged once they enter an online platform. One concern in this field is that massive amounts of information can be distracting and negatively impact productivity and decision-making and cognitive control. Another concern is the &quot;contamination&quot; of useful information with information that might not be entirely accurate (information pollution).

The general causes of information overload include:

* A rapidly increasing rate of new information being produced, also known as journalism of assertion, which is a continuous news culture where there is a premium put on how quickly news can be put out; this leads to a competitive advantage in news reporting, but also affects the quality of the news stories reported.
*The ease of duplication and transmission of data across the Internet.
*An increase in the available channels of incoming information (e.g. telephone, email, instant messaging, RSS)
*Ever-increasing amounts of historical information to view.
*Contradictions and inaccuracies in available information, which is connected to misinformation.
*A low signal-to-noise ratio.
*A lack of a method for comparing and processing different kinds of information.
*The pieces of information are unrelated or do not have any overall structure to reveal their relationships.

=== Email ===
Email remains a major source of information overload, as people struggle to keep up with the rate of incoming messages. As well as filtering out unsolicited commercial messages (spam), users also have to contend with the growing use of email attachments in the form of lengthy reports, presentations, and media files.

A December 2007 &quot;New York Times&quot; blog post described email as &quot;a $650 billion drag on the economy&quot;, and the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported in April 2008 that &quot;email has become the bane of some people&#x27;s professional lives&quot; due to information overload, yet &quot;none of [the current wave of high-profile Internet startups focused on email] really eliminates the problem of email overload because none helps us prepare replies&quot;.

In January 2011, Eve Tahmincioglu, a writer for NBC News, wrote an article titled &quot;It&#x27;s Time to Deal With That Overflowing Inbox&quot;. Compiling statistics with commentary, she reported that there were 294 billion emails sent each day in 2010, up from 50 billion in 2009. Quoted in the article, workplace productivity expert Marsha Egan stated that people need to differentiate between working on email and sorting through it. This meant that rather than responding to every email right away, users should delete unnecessary emails and sort the others into action or reference folders first. Egan then went on to say &quot;We are more wired than ever before, and as a result need to be more mindful of managing email or it will end up managing us.&quot;

&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; quoted Nicholas Carr, former executive editor of the Harvard Business Review and the author of &quot;The Shallows: What The Internet Is Doing To Our Brains&quot;, as saying that email exploits a basic human instinct to search for new information, causing people to become addicted to &quot;mindlessly pressing levers in the hope of receiving a pellet of social or intellectual nourishment&quot;. His concern is shared by Eric Schmidt, chief executive of Google, who stated that &quot;instantaneous devices&quot; and the abundance of information people are exposed to through email and other technology-based sources could be having an impact on the thought process, obstructing deep thinking, understanding, impeding the formation of memories and making learning more difficult. This condition of &quot;cognitive overload&quot; results in diminished information retaining ability and failing to connect remembrances to experiences stored in the long-term memory, leaving thoughts &quot;thin and scattered&quot;. This is also manifest in the education process.

=== Web accuracy ===
In addition to email, the World Wide Web has provided access to billions of pages of information. In many offices, workers are given unrestricted access to the Web, allowing them to manage their own research. The use of search engines helps users to find information quickly. However, information published online may not always be reliable, due to the lack of authority-approval or a compulsory accuracy check before publication. Internet information lacks credibility as the Web&#x27;s search engines do not have the abilities to filter and manage information and misinformation. This results in people having to cross-check what they read before using it for decision-making, which takes up more time.

Viktor Mayer-Schönberger, author of &quot;Delete: The Virtue of Forgetting in the Digital Age,&quot; argues that everyone can be a &quot;participant&quot; on the Internet, where they are all senders and receivers of information. On the Internet, trails of information are left behind, allowing other Internet participants to share and exchange information. Information becomes difficult to control on the Internet.

The BBC reports that &quot;every day, the information we send and receive onlinewhether that&#x27;s checking emails or searching the internetamount to over 2.5 quintillion bytes of data.&quot;

===Social media===
Social media are applications and websites with an online community where users create and share content with each other, and it adds to the problem of information overload because so many people have access to it. It presents many different views and outlooks on subject matters so that one may have difficulty taking it all in and drawing a clear conclusion. Information overload may not be the core reason for people&#x27;s anxieties about the amount of information they receive in their daily lives. Instead, information overload can be considered situational. Social media users tend to feel less overloaded by information when using their personal profiles, rather than when their work institutions expect individuals to gather a mass of information. Most people see information through social media in their lives as an aid to help manage their day-to-day activities and not an overload. Depending on what social media platform is being used, it may be easier or harder to stay up to date on posts from people. Facebook users who post and read more than others tend to be able to keep up. On the other hand, Twitter users who post and read a lot of tweets still feel like it is too much information (or none of it is interesting enough). Another problem with social media is that many people create a living by creating content for either their own or someone else&#x27;s platform, which can create for creators to publish an overload of content.

== Effects of information overload ==
In the context of searching for information, researchers have identified two forms of information overload: &quot;outcome overload&quot; where there are too many sources of information and &quot;textual overload&quot; where the individual sources are too long. This form of information overload may cause searchers to be less systematic. Disillusionment when a search is more challenging than expected may result in an individual being less able to search effectively. Information overload when searching can result in a satisficing strategy.

== Responding to information overload ==
Savolainen identifies &quot;filtering&quot; and &quot;withdrawal&quot; as common responses to information. Filtering involves quickly working out whether a particular piece of information, such as an email, can be ignored based on certain criteria. Withdrawal refers to limiting the number of sources of information with which one interacts. They distinguish between &quot;pull&quot; and &quot;push&quot; sources of information, a &quot;pull&quot; source being one where one seeks out relevant information, a &quot;push&quot; source one where others decide what information might be interesting. They note that &quot;pull&quot; sources can avoid information overload but by only &quot;pulling&quot; information one risks missing important information.

There have been many solutions proposed for how to mitigate information overload. Research examining how people seek to control an overloaded environment has shown that people purposefully using different coping strategies. In general, overload coping strategy consists of two excluding (ignoring and filtering) and two including (customizing and saving) approaches. Excluding approach focuses on managing the quantity of information, while including approach is geared towards complexity management.

# Excluding approach involve the acts of reducing the amount of incoming information. This strategy aims to reduce cognitive burden by decreasing the quantity of information to process through filtering or ignoring. Ignoring is an implicit method, while filtering is explicit, with the main difference being the presence of exposure. Various strategies of excluding, such as reducing the number or volume of information sources and filtering news based on relevance have been described. Research shows that people are more likely to adopt excluding strategy when they feel overloaded.
# Including approach, on the other hand, is a proactive approach where individuals select relevant and important news for consumption, so that one does not miss essential information while preventing excessive &quot;cognitive&quot; energy use. Customization and prioritizing are several examples of this type of strategy. Customization, a concept originating from marketing, is one way to organize news based on user preferences. This approach enhances the ability to process informationrelated to information processing where how a person records, molds, and stores information is crucial. Another inclusion approach is saving. People save or bookmark online content that they come across to read later when they have more time. This strategy does not limit the amount of information acquired but instead focuses on allocating the necessary resources for information processing.

Johnson advises discipline which helps mitigate interruptions and for the elimination of push or notifications. He explains that notifications pull people&#x27;s attentions away from their work and into social networks and emails. He also advises that people stop using their iPhones as alarm clocks which means that the phone is the first thing that people will see when they wake up leading to people checking their email right away.

Clay Shirky states:
Consider the use of Internet applications and add-ons such as the &quot;Inbox Pause&quot; add-on for Gmail. This add-on does not reduce the number of emails that people get but it pauses the inbox. Burkeman in his article talks about the feeling of being in control is the way to deal with information overload which might involve self-deception. He advises to fight irrationality with irrationality by using add-ons that allow you to pause your inbox or produce other results. Reducing large amounts of information is key.

Dealing with IO from a social network site such as Facebook, a study done by Humboldt University showed some strategies that students take to try and alleviate IO while using Facebook. Some of these strategies included: Prioritizing updates from friends who were physically farther away in other countries, hiding updates from less-prioritized friends, deleting people from their friends list, narrowing the amount of personal information shared, and deactivating the Facebook account.

=== The problem of organization ===
Decision makers performing complex tasks have little if any excess cognitive capacity. Narrowing one&#x27;s attention as a result of the interruption is likely to result in the loss of information cues, some of which may be relevant to completing the task. Under these circumstances, performance is likely to deteriorate. As the number or intensity of the distractions/interruptions increases, the decision maker&#x27;s cognitive capacity is exceeded, and performance deteriorates more severely. In addition to reducing the number of possible cues attended to, more severe distractions/interruptions may encourage decision-makers to use heuristics, take shortcuts, or opt for a satisficing decision, resulting in lower decision accuracy.

Some cognitive scientists and graphic designers have emphasized the distinction between raw information and information in a form that can be used in thinking. In this view, information overload may be better viewed as organization underload. That is, they suggest that the problem is not so much the volume of information but the fact that it cannot be discerned how to use it well in the raw or biased form it is presented. Authors who have taken this view include graphic artist and architect Richard Saul Wurman and statistician and cognitive scientist Edward Tufte. Wurman uses the term &quot;information anxiety&quot; to describe humanity&#x27;s attitude toward the volume of information in general and their limitations in processing it. Tufte primarily focuses on quantitative information and explores ways to organize large complex datasets visually to facilitate clear thinking. Tufte&#x27;s writing is important in such fields as information design and visual literacy, which deal with the visual communication of information. Tufte coined the term &quot;chartjunk&quot; to refer to useless, non-informative, or information-obscuring elements of quantitative information displays, such as the use of graphics to overemphasize the importance of certain pieces of data or information.

=== Responding to Information Overload in email communication ===
In a study conducted by Soucek and Moser (2010), they investigated what impact a training intervention on how to cope with information overload would have on employees. They found that the training intervention did have a positive impact on IO, especially on those who struggled with work impairment and media usage, and employees who had a higher amount of incoming emails.

=== Responses of business and government ===
Recent research suggests that an &quot;attention economy&quot; of sorts will naturally emerge from information overload, allowing Internet users greater control over their online experience with particular regard to communication mediums such as email and instant messaging. This could involve some sort of cost being attached to email messages. For example, managers charging a small fee for every email receivede.g. $1.00which the sender must pay from their budget. The aim of such charging is to force the sender to consider the necessity of the interruption. However, such a suggestion undermines the entire basis of the popularity of email, namely that emails are free of charge to send.

Economics often assumes that people are rational in that they have the knowledge of their preferences and an ability to look for the best possible ways to maximize their preferences. People are seen as selfish and focus on what pleases them. Looking at various parts on their own results in the negligence of the other parts that work alongside it that create the effect of IO. Lincoln suggests possible ways to look at IO in a more holistic approach by recognizing the many possible factors that play a role in IO and how they work together to achieve IO.

=== In medicine ===
It would be impossible for an individual to read all the academic papers published in a narrow speciality, even if they spent all their time reading. A response to this is the publishing of systematic reviews such as the Cochrane Reviews. Richard Smith argues that it would be impossible for a general practitioner to read all the literature relevant to every individual patient they consult with and suggests one solution would be an expert system for use of doctors while consulting.

<doc id="495671" wikidata="Q837887" url="?curid=495671" title="Operation Infinite Reach">
<text>Operation Infinite Reach was the codename for American cruise missile strikes on al-Qaeda bases that were launched concurrently across two continents on 20 August 1998. Launched by the U.S. Navy, the strikes hit the al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum, Sudan, and a camp in Khost Province, Afghanistan, in retaliation for al-Qaeda&#x27;s August 7 bombings of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed 224 people (including 12 Americans) and injured over 4,000 others. Operation Infinite Reach was the first time the United States acknowledged a preemptive strike against a violent non-state actor.

U.S. intelligence wrongly suggested financial ties between the al-Shifa plant, which produced over half of Sudan&#x27;s pharmaceuticals, and Osama bin Laden; a soil sample collected from al-Shifa allegedly contained a chemical used in VX nerve gas manufacturing. Suspecting that al-Shifa was linked to, and producing chemical weapons for, bin Laden and his al-Qaeda network, the U.S. destroyed the facility with cruise missiles, killing or wounding 11 Sudanese. The strike on al-Shifa proved controversial; after the attacks, the U.S. evidence and rationale were criticized as faulty, and academics Max Taylor and Mohamed Elbushra cite &quot;a broad acceptance that this plant was not involved in the production of any chemical weapons.&quot;

The missile strikes on al-Qaeda&#x27;s Afghan training camps were aimed at preempting more attacks and killing bin Laden. These strikes damaged the installations, but bin Laden was not present at the time. Two of the targeted camps were run by the Inter-Services Intelligence of Pakistan, which at the time was allied to the US, who were training militants to fight in Kashmir; in all, five ISI officers were confirmed killed and at least twenty militants also died. Following the attacks, Afghanistan&#x27;s ruling Taliban allegedly reneged on a promise to Saudi intelligence chief Turki bin Faisal to hand over bin Laden, and the regime instead allegedly strengthened its ties with the al-Qaeda chief.

Operation Infinite Reach, the largest U.S. action in response to a terrorist attack since the 1986 bombing of Libya, was met with a mixed international response: U.S. allies and most of the American public supported the strikes, but many across the Muslim world disapproved them, viewing them as attacks specifically against Muslims, a factor that was further capitalized by radicals. The failure of the attacks to kill bin Laden also enhanced his public image in parts of the Muslim world. Further strikes were planned but not executed; as a 2002 congressional inquiry noted, Operation Infinite Reach was &quot;the only instance ... in which the CIA or U.S. military carried out an operation directly against Bin Laden before September 11.&quot;

==Background==
On 23 February 1998, Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and three other leaders of Islamic militant organizations issued a &quot;fatwa&quot; in the name of the World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders, publishing it in &quot;al-Quds al-Arabi&quot;. Deploring the stationing of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia, the alleged U.S. aim to fragment Iraq, and U.S. support for Israel, they declared that &quot;The ruling to kill the Americans and their allies—civilian and military—is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it.&quot; In spring 1998, Saudi elites became concerned about the threat posed by al-Qaeda and bin Laden; militants attempted to infiltrate surface-to-air missiles inside the kingdom, an al-Qaeda defector alleged that Saudis were bankrolling bin Laden, and bin Laden himself lambasted the Saudi royal family. In June 1998, Al Mukhabarat Al A&#x27;amah (Saudi intelligence) director Prince Turki bin Faisal Al Saud traveled to Tarnak Farms to meet with Taliban leader Mullah Omar to discuss the question of bin Laden. Turki demanded that the Taliban either expel bin Laden from Afghanistan or hand him over to the Saudis, insisting that removing bin Laden was the price of cordial relations with the Kingdom. American analysts believed Turki offered a large amount of financial aid to resolve the dispute over bin Laden. Omar agreed to the deal, and the Saudis sent the Taliban 400 pickup trucks and funding, enabling the Taliban to retake Mazar-i-Sharif. While the Taliban sent a delegation to Saudi Arabia in July for further discussions, the negotiations stalled by August.

Around the same time, the U.S. was planning its own actions against bin Laden. Michael Scheuer, chief of the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s bin Laden unit (Alec Station), considered using local Afghans to kidnap bin Laden, then exfiltrate him from Afghanistan in a modified Lockheed C-130 Hercules. Documents recovered from Wadih el-Hage&#x27;s Nairobi computer suggested a link between bin Laden and the deaths of U.S. troops in Somalia. These were used as the foundation for the June 1998 New York indictment of bin Laden, although the charges were later dropped. The planned raid was cancelled in May after internecine disputes between officials at the FBI and the CIA; the hesitation of the National Security Council (NSC) to approve the plan; concerns over the raid&#x27;s chance of success, and the potential for civilian casualties.

Al-Qaeda had begun reconnoitering Nairobi for potential targets in December 1993, using a team led by Ali Mohamed. In January 1994, bin Laden was personally presented with the team&#x27;s surveillance reports, and he and his senior advisers began to develop a plan to attack the American embassy there. From February to June 1998, al-Qaeda prepared to launch their attacks, renting residences, building their bombs, and acquiring trucks; meanwhile, bin Laden continued his public-relations efforts, giving interviews with ABC News and Pakistani journalists. While U.S. authorities had investigated al-Qaeda activities in Nairobi, they had not detected any warnings of imminent attacks.

On August 7, 1998, al-Qaeda teams in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, attacked the cities&#x27; U.S. embassies simultaneously with truck bombs. In Nairobi, the explosion collapsed the nearby Ufundi Building and destroyed the embassy, killing 213 people, including 12 Americans; another 4,000 people were wounded. In Dar es Salaam, the bomber was unable to get close enough to the embassy to demolish it, but the blast killed 11 Africans and wounded 85. Bin Laden justified the high-casualty attacks, the largest against the U.S. since the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings, by claiming they were in retaliation for the deployment of U.S. troops in Somalia; he also alleged that the embassies had devised the Rwandan genocide as well as a supposed plan to partition Sudan.

==Execution==

===Planning the strikes===
National Security Advisor Sandy Berger called President Bill Clinton at 5:35 AM on August 7 to notify him of the bombings. That day, Clinton started meeting with his &quot;Small Group&quot; of national security advisers, which included Berger, CIA director George Tenet, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Attorney General Janet Reno, Defense Secretary William Cohen, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Hugh Shelton. The group&#x27;s objective was to plan a military response to the East Africa embassy bombings. Initially the U.S. suspected either Hamas or Hezbollah for the bombings, but FBI Agents John P. O&#x27;Neill and Ali Soufan demonstrated that al-Qaeda was responsible. Based on electronic and phone intercepts, physical evidence from Nairobi, and interrogations, officials soon demonstrated bin Laden as the perpetrator of the attacks. On August 8, the White House asked the CIA and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to prepare a targets list; the initial list included twenty targets in Sudan, Afghanistan, and an unknown third country, although it was narrowed down on August 12.

In an August 10 Small Group meeting, the principals agreed to use Tomahawk cruise missiles, rather than troops or aircraft, in the retaliatory strikes. Cruise missiles had been previously used against Iraq as reprisal for the 1993 attempted assassination of then-President George H. W. Bush. Using cruise missiles also helped to preserve secrecy; airstrikes would have required more preparation that might have leaked to the media and alerted bin Laden. The option of using commandos was discarded, as it required too much time to prepare forces, logistics, and combat search and rescue. Using helicopters or bombers would have been difficult due to the lack of a suitable base or Pakistani permission to cross its airspace, and the administration also feared a recurrence of the disastrous 1980 Operation Eagle Claw in Iran. While military officials suggested bombing Kandahar, which bin Laden and his associates often visited, the administration was concerned about killing civilians and hurting the U.S.&#x27; image.

On August 11, General Anthony Zinni of Central Command was instructed to plan attacks on bin Laden&#x27;s Khost camps,&lt;ref name=&quot;9/11 Commission Report&quot;&gt;9/11 Commission Report , p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; where CIA intelligence indicated bin Laden and other militants would be meeting on August 20, purportedly to plan further attacks against the U.S. Clinton was informed of the plan on August 12 and 14. Participants in the meeting later disagreed whether or not the intelligence indicated bin Laden would attend the meeting; however, an objective of the attack remained to kill the al-Qaeda leader, and the NSC encouraged the strike regardless of whether bin Laden and his companions were known to be present at Khost. The administration aimed to prevent future al-Qaeda attacks discussed in intercepted communications. As Berger later testified, the operation also sought to damage bin Laden&#x27;s infrastructure and show the administration&#x27;s commitment to combating bin Laden. The Khost complex, which was southeast of Kabul, also had ideological significance: Bin Laden had fought nearby during the Soviet–Afghan War, and he had given interviews and even held a press conference at the site. Felix Sater, then a CIA source, provided additional intelligence on the camps&#x27; locations.

On August 14, Tenet told the Small Group that bin Laden and al-Qaeda were doubtless responsible for the attack; Tenet called the intelligence a &quot;slam dunk&quot;, according to counterterrorism official Richard Clarke, and Clinton approved the attacks the same day. As the 9/11 Commission Report relates, the group debated &quot;whether to strike targets outside of Afghanistan&quot;. Tenet briefed the small group again on August 17 regarding possible targets in Afghanistan and Sudan; on August 19, the al-Shifa pharmaceutical facility in Khartoum, Sudan, al-Qaeda&#x27;s Afghan camps, and a Sudanese tannery were designated as targets. The aim of striking the tannery, which had allegedly been given to bin Laden by the Sudanese for his road-building work, was to disrupt bin Laden&#x27;s finances, but it was removed as a target due to fears of inflicting civilian casualties without any loss for bin Laden. Clinton gave the final approval for the attacks at 3:00 AM on August 20; the same day, he also signed Executive Order 13099, authorizing sanctions on bin Laden and al-Qaeda. The Clinton administration justified Operation Infinite Reach under Article 51 of the UN Charter and Title 22, Section 2377 of the U.S. Code; the former guarantees a UN member state&#x27;s right to self-defense, while the latter authorizes presidential action by &quot;all necessary means&quot; to target international terrorist infrastructure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robinson/Priest&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Government lawyers asserted that since the missile strikes were an act of self-defense and not directed at an individual, they were not forbidden as an assassination. A review by administration lawyers concluded that the attack would be legal, since the president has the authority to attack the infrastructure of anti-American terrorist groups, and al-Qaeda&#x27;s infrastructure was largely human. Officials also interpreted &quot;infrastructure&quot; to include al-Qaeda&#x27;s leadership.

The missiles would pass into Pakistani airspace, overflying &quot;a suspected Pakistani nuclear weapons site,&quot; according to Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Ralston; U.S. officials feared Pakistan would mistake them for an Indian nuclear attack. Clarke was concerned the Pakistanis would shoot down the cruise missiles or airplanes if they were not notified, but also feared the ISI would warn the Taliban or al-Qaeda if they were alerted. In Islamabad on the evening of August 20, Ralston informed Pakistan Army Chief of Staff Jehangir Karamat of the incoming American strikes ten minutes before the missiles entered Pakistani airspace. Clarke also worried the Pakistanis would notice the U.S. Navy ships, but was told that submerged submarines would launch the missiles. However, the Pakistan Navy detected the destroyers and informed the government.

===Al-Shifa plant attack===

At about 7:30 PM Khartoum time (17:30 GMT), two American warships in the Red Sea (USS &quot;Briscoe&quot; and USS &quot;Hayler&quot;) fired thirteen Tomahawk missiles at Sudan&#x27;s Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory, which the U.S. wrongly claimed was helping bin Laden build chemical weapons. The entire factory was destroyed except for the administration, water-cooling, and plant laboratory sections, which were severely damaged. One night watchman was killed and ten other Sudanese were wounded by the strike. Worried about the possibility for hazardous chemical leakages, analysts ran computer simulations on wind patterns, climate, and chemical data, which indicated a low risk of collateral damage. Regardless, planners added more cruise missiles to the strike on Al-Shifa, aiming to completely destroy the plant and any dangerous substances.

Clarke stated that intelligence linked bin Laden to Al-Shifa&#x27;s current and past operators, namely Iraqi nerve gas experts such as Emad al-Ani and Sudan&#x27;s ruling National Islamic Front. Since 1995, the CIA had received intelligence suggesting collaboration between Sudan and bin Laden to produce chemical weapons for attacking U.S. Armed Forces personnel based in Saudi Arabia. Since 1989, the Sudanese opposition and Uganda had alleged that the regime was manufacturing and using chemical weapons, although the U.S. did not accuse Sudan of chemical weapons proliferation. Al-Qaeda defector Jamal al-Fadl had also spoken of bin Laden&#x27;s desire to obtain weapons of mass destruction, and an August 4 CIA intelligence report suggested bin Laden &quot;had already acquired chemical weapons and might be ready to attack&quot;. Cohen later testified that physical evidence, technical and human intelligence, and the site&#x27;s security and purported links to bin Laden backed the intelligence community&#x27;s view that the Al-Shifa plant was producing chemical weapons and associated with terrorists.

With the help of an Egyptian agent, the CIA had obtained a sample of soil from the facility taken in December 1997 showing the presence of O-Ethyl methylphosphonothioic acid (EMPTA), a substance used in the production of VX nerve gas, at 2.5 times trace levels. (Reports are contradictory on whether the soil was obtained from within the compound itself, or outside.) The collected soil was split into three samples, which were then analyzed by a private laboratory. The agent&#x27;s bona fides were later confirmed through polygraph testing; however, the CIA produced a report on Al-Shifa on July 24, 1998, questioning whether Al-Shifa produced chemical weapons or simply stored precursors, and the agency advised collecting more soil samples. Cohen and Tenet later briefed U.S. senators on intercepted telephone communications from the plant that reputedly bolstered the U.S. case against Al-Shifa. U.S. intelligence also purportedly researched the Al-Shifa factory online and searched commercial databases, but did not find any medicines for sale.

===Al-Shifa controversy===
U.S. officials later acknowledged that the evidence cited by the U.S. in its rationale for the Al-Shifa strike was weaker than initially believed: The facility had not been involved in chemical weapons production, and was not connected to bin Laden. The $30 million Al-Shifa factory, which had a $199,000 contract with the UN under the Oil-for-Food Programme, employed 300 Sudanese and provided over half of the country&#x27;s pharmaceuticals, including medicines for malaria, diabetes, gonorrhea, and tuberculosis. A Sudanese named Salah Idris purchased the plant in March 1998; while the CIA later said it found financial ties between Idris and the bin Laden-linked terrorist group Egyptian Islamic Jihad, the agency had been unaware at the time that Idris owned the Al-Shifa facility. Idris later denied any links to bin Laden and sued to recover $24 million in funds frozen by the U.S., as well as for the damage to his factory. Idris hired investigations firm Kroll Inc., which reported in February 1999 that neither Idris nor Al-Shifa was connected to terrorism.

The chairman of Al-Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries insisted that his factory did not make nerve gas, and Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir formed a commission to investigate the factory. Sudan invited the U.S. to conduct chemical tests at the site for evidence to support its claim that the plant might have been a chemical weapons factory; the U.S. refused the invitation to investigate and did not officially apologize for the attacks. Press coverage indicated that Al-Shifa was not a secure, restricted-access factory, as the U.S. alleged, and American officials later conceded that Al-Shifa manufactured pharmaceutical drugs. Sudan requested a UN investigation of the Al-Shifa plant to verify or disprove the allegations of weapons production; while the proposal was backed by several international organizations, it was opposed by the U.S.

The American Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) criticized the CIA&#x27;s intelligence on Al-Shifa and bin Laden in an August 6 memo; as James Risen reported, INR analysts concluded that &quot;the evidence linking Al Shifa to bin Laden and chemical weapons was weak.&quot; According to Risen, some dissenting officials doubted the basis for the strike, but senior principals believed that &quot;the risks of hitting the wrong target were far outweighed by the possibility that the plant was making chemical weapons for a terrorist eager to use them.&quot; Senior NSC intelligence official Mary McCarthy had stated that better intelligence was needed before planning a strike, while Reno, concerned about the lack of conclusive evidence, had pressed for delaying the strikes until the U.S. obtained better intelligence. According to CIA officer Paul R. Pillar, senior Agency officials met with Tenet before he briefed the White House on bin Laden and Al-Shifa, and the majority of them opposed attacking the plant. Barletta notes that &quot;It is unclear precisely when U.S. officials decided to destroy the Shifa plant.&quot; ABC News reported that Al-Shifa was designated as a target just hours in advance; &quot;Newsweek&quot; stated that the plant was targeted on August 15–16; U.S. officials asserted that the plant was added as a target months in advance; and a &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; article contended that Al-Shifa had been considered as a target for years. Clinton ordered an investigation into the evidence used to justify the Al-Shifa strike, while as of July 1999, the House and Senate intelligence committees were also investigating the target-selection process, the evidence cited, and whether intelligence officials recommended attacking the plant.

It was later hypothesized that the EMPTA detected was the result of the breakdown of a pesticide or confused with Fonofos, a structurally similar insecticide used in African agriculture. Eric Croddy contends that the sample did not contain Fonofos, arguing that Fonofos has a distinct ethyl group and a benzene group, which distinguish it from EMPTA, and that the two chemicals could not be easily confused. Tests conducted in October 1999 by Idris&#x27; defense team found no trace of EMPTA. Although Tenet vouched for the Egyptian agent&#x27;s truthfulness, Barletta questions the operative&#x27;s bona fides, arguing that they may have misled U.S. intelligence; he also notes that the U.S. withdrew its intelligence staff from Sudan in 1996 and later retracted 100 intelligence reports from a fraudulent Sudanese source. Ultimately, Barletta concludes that &quot;It remains possible that Al-Shifa Pharmaceutical Factory may have been involved in some way in producing or storing the chemical compound EMPTA ... On balance, the evidence available to date indicates that it is more probable that the Shifa plant had no role whatsoever in CW production.&quot;

===Attack on Afghan camps===
Four U.S. Navy ships and the submarine USS &quot;Columbia&quot;, stationed in the Arabian Sea, fired between 60 and 75 Tomahawk cruise missiles into Afghanistan at the Zhawar Kili Al-Badr camp complex in the Khost region, which included a base camp, a support camp, and four training camps. Peter Bergen identifies the targeted camps, located in Afghanistan&#x27;s &quot;Pashtun belt,&quot; as al-Badr 1 and 2, al-Farooq, Khalid bin Walid, Abu Jindal, and Salman Farsi; other sources identify the Muawia, Jihad Wahl, and Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami camps as targets. According to Shelton, the base camp housed &quot;storage, housing, training and administration facilities for the complex,&quot; while the support camp included weapons-storage facilities and managed the site&#x27;s logistics. Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Algerian Armed Islamic Group also used the Khost camps, as well as Pakistani militant groups fighting an insurgency in Kashmir, such as Harkat Ansar, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and Hizbul Mujahideen. The rudimentary camps, reputedly run by Taliban official Jalaluddin Haqqani, were frequented by Arab, Chechen, and Central Asian militants, as well as the ISI. The missiles hit at roughly 10:00 PM Khost time (17:30 GMT); as in Sudan, the strikes were launched at night to avoid collateral damage. In contrast to the attack on Al-Shifa, the strike on the Afghan camps was uncontroversial.

The U.S. first fired unitary (C-model) Tomahawks at the Khost camps, aiming to attract militants into the open, then launched a barrage of D-model missiles equipped with submunitions to maximize casualties. Sources differ on the precise number of casualties inflicted by the missile strikes. Bin Laden bodyguard Abu Jandal and militant trainee Abdul Rahman Khadr later estimated that only six men had been killed in the strikes. The Taliban claimed 22 Afghans killed and over 50 seriously injured, while Berger put al-Qaeda casualties at between 20 and 30 men. Bin Laden jokingly told militants that only a few camels and chickens had died, although his spokesman cited losses of six Arabs killed and five wounded, seven Pakistanis killed and over 15 wounded, and 15 Afghans killed. A declassified September 9, 1998, State Department cable stated that around 20 Pakistanis and 15 Arabs died, out of a total of over 50 killed in the attack. Harkat-ul-Mujahideen&#x27;s leader, Fazlur Rehman Khalil, initially claimed a death toll of over 50 militants, but later said that he had lost fewer than ten fighters. Death toll ranges from 6 or 50 militants.

Pakistani and hospital sources gave a death toll of eleven dead and fifty-three wounded. Pakistani journalist Ahmed Rashid writes that 20 Afghans, seven Pakistanis, three Yemenis, two Egyptians, one Saudi and one Turk were killed. Initial reports by Pakistani intelligence chief Chaudhry Manzoor and a Foreign Ministry spokesman stated that a missile had landed in Pakistan and killed six Pakistanis; the government later retracted the statement and fired Manzoor for the incorrect report. However, the 9/11 Commission Report states that Clinton later called Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif &quot;to apologize for a wayward missile that had killed several people in a Pakistani village.&quot; One 1998 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; article suggested that most of the strike&#x27;s victims were Pakistani militants bound for the Kashmiri insurgency, rather than al-Qaeda members; the operation killed a number of ISI officers present in the camps. A 1999 press report stated that seven Harkat Ansar militants were killed and 24 were wounded, while eight Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen members were killed. In a May 1999 meeting with American diplomats, Haqqani said his facilities had been destroyed and 25 of his men killed in the operation.

Following the attack, U.S. surveillance aircraft and reconnaissance satellites photographed the sites for damage assessment, although clouds obscured the area. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the imagery indicated &quot;considerable damage&quot; to the camps, although &quot;up to 20 percent of the missiles ... [had] disappointing results.&quot; Meanwhile, bin Laden made calls by satellite phone, attempting to ascertain the damage and casualties the camps had sustained. One anonymous official reported that some buildings were destroyed, while others suffered heavy or light damage or were unscathed. Abu Jandal stated that bathrooms, the kitchen, and the mosque were hit in the strike, but the camps were not completely destroyed. Berger claimed that the damage to the camps was &quot;moderate to severe,&quot; while CIA agent Henry A. Crumpton later wrote that al-Qaeda &quot;suffered a few casualties and some damaged infrastructure, but no more.&quot; Since the camps were relatively unsophisticated, they were quickly and easily rebuilt within two weeks.

ISI director Hamid Gul reportedly notified the Taliban of the missile strikes in advance; bin Laden, who survived the strikes, later claimed that he had been informed of them by Pakistanis. A bin Laden spokesman claimed that bin Laden and the Taliban had prepared for the strike after hearing of the evacuation of Americans from Pakistan. Other U.S. officials reject the tip-off theory, citing a lack of evidence and ISI casualties in the strike; Tenet later wrote in his memoirs that the CIA could not ascertain whether Bin Laden had been warned in advance. Steve Coll reports that the CIA heard after the attack that bin Laden had been at Zhawar Kili Al-Badr but had left some hours before the missiles hit. Bill Gertz writes that the earlier arrest of Mohammed Odeh on August 7, while he was traveling to meet with bin Laden, alerted bin Laden, who canceled the meeting; this meant the camps targeted by the cruise missiles were mainly empty the day of the U.S. strike. Lawrence Wright says the CIA intercepted a phone call indicating that bin Laden would be in Khost, but the al-Qaeda chief instead decided to go to Kabul. Other media reports indicate that the strike was delayed to maximize secrecy, thus missing bin Laden. Scheuer charges that while the U.S. had planned to target the complex&#x27;s mosque during evening prayers to kill bin Laden and his associates, the White House allegedly delayed the strikes &quot;to avoid offending the Muslim world&quot;. Simon Reeve states that Pakistani intelligence had informed bin Laden that the U.S. was using his phone to track him, so he turned it off and cancelled the meeting at Khost.

==Aftermath==

===Reactions in the U.S.===
Clinton flew back to Washington, D.C. from his vacation at Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, speaking with legislators from Air Force One and British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, and Sharif from the White House. Clinton announced the attacks in a TV address, saying the Khost camp was &quot;one of the most active terrorist bases in the world.&quot; He emphasized: &quot;Our battle against terrorism ... will require strength, courage and endurance. We will not yield to this threat ... We must be prepared to do all that we can for as long as we must.&quot; Clinton also cited &quot;compelling evidence that [bin Laden] was planning to mount further attacks&quot; in his rationale for Operation Infinite Reach.

The missiles were launched three days after Clinton testified on the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal, and some countries, media outlets, protesters, and Republicans accused him of ordering the attacks as a diversion. The attacks also drew parallels to the then-recently released movie &quot;Wag the Dog&quot;, which features a fictional president faking a war in Albania to distract attention from a sex scandal. Administration officials denied any connection between the missile strikes and the ongoing scandal, and 9/11 Commission investigators found no reason to dispute those statements.

Operation Infinite Reach was covered heavily by U.S. media: About 75% of Americans knew about the strikes by the evening of August 20. The next day, 79% of respondents in a Pew Research Center poll reported they had &quot;followed the story &#x27;very&#x27; or &#x27;fairly&#x27; closely.&quot; The week after the strikes, the evening programs of the three major news networks featured 69 stories on them. In a &quot;Newsweek&quot; poll, up to 40% thought that diverting attention from the Lewinsky scandal was one objective of the strikes; according to a &quot;Star Tribune&quot; poll, 31% of college-educated respondents and 60% of those &quot;with less than a 12th grade education&quot; believed that the attacks were motivated &quot;a great deal&quot; by the scandal. A &quot;USA Today&quot;/CNN/Gallup poll of 628 Americans showed that 47% thought it would increase terrorist attacks, while 38% thought it would lessen terrorism. A &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; poll of 895 taken three days after the attack indicated that 84% believed that the operation would trigger a retaliatory terrorist attack on U.S. soil.

===International reactions===
While U.S. allies such as Australia, Germany, the United Kingdom, Israel, and the Northern Alliance supported the attacks, they were opposed by Cuba, Russia, and China, as well as the targeted nations and other Muslim countries. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said that &quot;resolute actions by all countries&quot; were required against terrorism, while Russian President Boris Yeltsin condemned &quot;the ineffective approach to resolving disputes without trying all forms of negotiation and diplomacy.&quot; The Taliban denounced the operation, denied charges it provided a safe haven for bin Laden, and insisted the U.S. attack killed only innocent civilians. Mullah Omar condemned the strikes and announced that Afghanistan &quot;will never hand over bin Laden to anyone and (will) protect him with our blood at all costs.&quot; A mob in Jalalabad burned and looted the local UN office, while an Italian UN official was killed in Kabul on August 21, allegedly in response to the strikes. Thousands of anti-U.S. protesters took to the streets of Khartoum. Omar al-Bashir led an anti-U.S. rally and warned of possible reciprocation, and Martha Crenshaw notes that the strike &quot;gained the regime some sympathy in the Arab world.&quot; The Sudanese government expelled the British ambassador for Britain&#x27;s support of the attacks, while protesters stormed the empty U.S. embassy. Sudan also reportedly allowed two suspected accomplices to the embassy bombings to escape. Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi declared his country&#x27;s support for Sudan and led an anti-U.S. rally in Tripoli. Zawahiri later equated the destruction of Al-Shifa with the September 11 attacks.

Pakistan condemned the U.S. missile strikes as a violation of the territorial integrity of two Islamic countries, and criticized the U.S. for allegedly violating Pakistani airspace. Pakistanis protested the strikes in large demonstrations, including a 300-strong rally in Islamabad, where protesters burned a U.S. flag outside the U.S. Information Service center; in Karachi, thousands burned effigies of Clinton. The Pakistani government was enraged by the ISI and trainee casualties, the damage to ISI training camps, the short notice provided by the U.S., and the Americans&#x27; failure to inform Sharif of the strikes. Iran&#x27;s Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, and Iraq denounced the strikes as terrorism, while Iraq also denied producing chemical weapons in Sudan. The Arab League, holding an emergency meeting in Cairo, unanimously demanded an independent investigation into the Al-Shifa facility; the League also condemned the attack on the plant as a violation of Sudanese sovereignty.

Several Islamist groups also condemned Operation Infinite Reach, and some of them threatened retaliation. Hamas founder Ahmed Yassin stated that American attacks against Muslim countries constituted an attack on Islam itself, accusing the U.S. of state terrorism. Mustafa Mashhur, the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, said that U.S. military action would inflame public opinion against America and foster regional unrest, which was echoed by a Hezbollah spokesman. Harkat-ul-Mujahideen threatened Americans and Jews, announcing a worldwide jihad against the U.S. Al-Gama&#x27;a al-Islamiyya denounced the strikes as &quot;a crime which will not go without punishment&quot; and encouraged fellow militant groups to reciprocate. In November, Lashkar-e-Taiba held a 3-day demonstration in Lahore to support bin Laden, in which 50,000 Pakistanis promised vengeance for the strikes. American embassies and facilities worldwide also received a high volume of threats following the attacks. The attacks led to anti-Semitic conspiracy theories in the region that Lewinsky was a Jewish agent influencing Clinton against aiding Palestine, which would influence Mohamed Atta to join al-Qaeda&#x27;s Hamburg cell and commit the September 11 attacks.

==== Planet Hollywood bombing ====
A Planet Hollywood restaurant in Cape Town, South Africa, was the target of a terrorist bombing on August 25, killing two and injuring 26. The perpetrators, Muslims Against Global Oppression (later known as People Against Gangsterism and Drugs), stated that it was in retaliation for Operation Infinite Reach.

===Al-Qaeda victory===
The outcome was considered a political and strategic victory for al-Qaeda. The Taliban announced within a day that bin Laden had survived the attacks, which Wright notes strengthened his image in the Muslim world &quot;as a symbolic figure of resistance&quot; to the U.S. Bin Laden had prominent support in Pakistan, where two hagiographies of the al-Qaeda chief were soon published, parents began naming their newborn sons Osama, mosques distributed his taped speeches, and cargo trucks bore the slogan &quot;Long Live Osama&quot;. Children in Kenya and Tanzania wore bin Laden T-shirts, and al-Qaeda sold propaganda videos of the strikes&#x27; damage in European and Middle Eastern Islamic bookstores. A 1999 report prepared by Sandia National Laboratories stated that bin Laden &quot;appeared to many as an underdog standing firm in the face of bullying aggression,&quot; adding that the missile strikes sparked further planning of attacks by extremists. Operation Infinite Reach also strengthened bin Laden&#x27;s associates&#x27; support for him, and helped the al-Qaeda leader consolidate support among other Islamist militant groups. The attacks also helped al-Qaeda recruit new members and solicit funds. Naftali concludes that the strikes damaged the Khost camps but failed to deter al-Qaeda and &quot;probably intensified [bin Laden&#x27;s] hunger for violence.&quot; Similarly, researcher Rohan Gunaratna told the 9/11 Commission that the attacks did not reduce the threat of al-Qaeda.

==Assessment==

Each cruise missile cost between $750,000 and $1 million, and nearly $750,000,000 in weapons was fired in the strikes overall. The missiles&#x27; failure to eliminate their targets led to an acceleration in the American program to develop unmanned combat air vehicles. On September 2, the Taliban announced that it had found an unexploded U.S. missile, and the Pakistani press claimed that another had landed in Balochistan&#x27;s Kharan Desert. Russian intelligence and intercepted al-Qaeda communications indicate that China sent officials to Khost to examine and buy some of the unexploded missiles; bin Laden used the over $10 million in proceeds to fund Chechen opposition forces. Pakistani missile scientists studied the recovered Tomahawk&#x27;s computer, GPS, and propulsion systems, and Wright contends that Pakistan &quot;may have used [the Tomahawks] ... to design its own version of a cruise missile.&quot;

The September 9 State Department cable also claimed that &quot;the U.S. strikes have flushed the Arab and Pakistani militants out of Khost,&quot; and while the camps were relocated near Kandahar and Kabul, paranoia lingered as al-Qaeda suspected that a traitor had facilitated the attacks. For example, Abu Jandal claimed that the U.S. had employed an Afghan cook to pinpoint bin Laden&#x27;s location. Bin Laden augmented his personal bodyguard and began changing where he slept, while Al-Qaeda military chief Mohammed Atef frisked journalists who sought to meet Bin Laden.

Two days after Operation Infinite Reach, Omar reportedly called the State Department, saying that the strikes would only lead to more anti-Americanism and terrorism, and that Clinton should resign. The embassy bombings and the declaration of war against the U.S. had divided the Taliban and angered Omar. However, bin Laden swore an oath of fealty to the Taliban leader, and the two became friends. According to Wright, Omar also believed that turning over bin Laden would weaken his position. In an October cable, the State Department also wrote that the missile strikes worsened Afghan-U.S. relations while bringing the Taliban and al-Qaeda closer together. A Taliban spokesman even told State Department officials in November that &quot;If [the Taliban] could have retaliated with similar strikes against Washington, it would have.&quot; The Taliban also denied American charges that bin Laden was responsible for the embassy bombings. When Turki visited Omar to retrieve bin Laden, Omar told the prince that they had miscommunicated and he had never agreed to give the Saudis bin Laden. In Turki&#x27;s account, Omar lambasted him when he protested, insulting the Saudi royal family and praising the Al-Qaeda leader; Turki left without bin Laden. The Saudis broke off relations with the Taliban and allegedly hired a young Uzbek named Siddiq Ahmed in a failed bid to assassinate bin Laden. American diplomatic engagement with the Taliban continued, and the State Department insisted to them that the U.S. was only opposed to bin Laden and al-Qaeda, at whom the missile strikes were aimed, not Afghanistan and its leadership.

Following the strikes, Osama bin Laden&#x27;s spokesman announced that &quot;The battle has not started yet. Our answer will be deeds, not words.&quot; Zawahiri made a phone call to reporter Rahimullah Yusufzai, stating that &quot;We survived the attack ... we aren&#x27;t afraid of bombardment, threats, and acts of aggression ... we are ready for more sacrifices. The war has only just begun; the Americans should now await the answer.&quot; Al-Qaeda attempted to recruit chemists to develop a more addictive type of heroin for export to the U.S. and Western Europe, but was unsuccessful. A September 1998 intelligence report was titled &quot;UBL Plans for Reprisals Against U.S. Targets, Possibly in U.S.,&quot; while the August 6, 2001, President&#x27;s Daily Brief stated that after Operation Infinite Reach, &quot;Bin Ladin told followers he wanted to retaliate in Washington.&quot;

Afterwards, U.S. considered, but did not execute, more cruise missile strikes;
from 1999 to 2001, ships and submarines in the North Arabian Sea were prepared to conduct further attacks against bin Laden if his location could be ascertained. The U.S. considered firing more cruise missiles against bin Laden in Kandahar in December 1998 and May 1999; at an Emirati hunting camp in Helmand in February 1999; and in Ghazni in July 1999, but the strikes were called off due to various factors, including questionable intelligence and the potential for collateral damage. Similarly, CIA-employed Afghans planned six times to attack bin Laden&#x27;s convoy but did not, citing fears of civilian casualties, tight security, or that the al-Qaeda chief took a different route. Thus, Operation Infinite Reach was the only U.S. operation directed against bin Laden before the September 11 attacks. The operation&#x27;s failure later dissuaded President George W. Bush from ordering similar strikes in the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan.

<doc id="495687" wikidata="Q72348" url="?curid=495687" title="Anton Dostler">
<text>Anton Dostler (10 May 1891 – 1 December 1945) was a German army officer who fought in both World Wars. During World War II, he commanded several units as a General of the Infantry, primarily in Italy. After the Axis defeat, Dostler was executed for war crimes—specifically, ordering the execution of fifteen American prisoners of war in March 1944 during the Italian Campaign. 

Dostler was tried during the first Allied war crimes trials to be held after the end of the war in Europe. During his trial, he mounted a defense on the grounds that he had ordered the executions only because he himself was obeying superior orders, and that as such only his superiors could be held responsible. The specially-appointed Military Commission judges rejected Dostler&#x27;s defense, ruling, in an important precedent (later codified in Principle IV of the Nuremberg Principles and the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights), that citing superior orders did not relieve soldiers or officers of responsibility for carrying out war crimes. After being found guilty, Dostler was sentenced to death and executed by a United States Army firing squad.

==Military career==
Dostler joined the German army in 1910 and served as a junior officer during World War I. From the start of World War II to 1940, he served as chief of staff of the 7th Army. Subsequently he commanded the 57th Infantry Division (1941–42), the 163rd Infantry Division (1942) and, after some temporary stand-ins at corps, was appointed commander of 75th Army Corps (Jan-July 1944) in Italy and then commander of the Venetian Coast (Sept–Nov 1944), when its name was reassigned to 73rd Army Corps, where he finished the war.

==Execution of U.S. soldiers==

On 22 March 1944, 15 soldiers of the U.S. Army, including two officers, landed on the Italian coast about 15 kilometers north of La Spezia, 400 km (250 miles) behind the then-established front, as part of Operation Ginny II. They were all properly dressed in the field uniform of the U.S. Army and carried no civilian clothes. Their objective was to demolish a tunnel at Framura on the important railway line between La Spezia and Genoa. Two days later the group was captured by a combined party of Italian Fascist soldiers and troops from the German Army. They were taken to La Spezia, where they were confined near the headquarters of the 135th (Fortress) Brigade, which was under the command of German Col. Almers. His immediate superior was the commander of the 75th Army Corps, Dostler.

The captured American party was interrogated by Wehrmacht intelligence officers, and an officer revealed the mission. The information, including that it was a commando raid, was then sent to Dostler at the 75th Army Corps H.Q. The following day he informed his superior, Field Marshal Albert Kesselring, commanding general of all German forces in Italy, about the captured U.S. commandos and asked what to do with them. According to Dostler&#x27;s adjutant, Kesselring responded by ordering the execution. Later that day Dostler sent a telegram to the 135th (Fortress) Brigade passing on the order that the captured commando party was to be executed, in line with the Commando Order of 1942 issued by Adolf Hitler, which ordered the immediate execution without trial of all enemy commandos and saboteurs taken prisoner by the Wehrmacht in the field.

Colonel Almers at the 135th (Fortress) Brigade was uneasy with the execution order, and approached Dostler again to delay the execution command. In response Dostler dispatched another telegram ordering Almers to carry out the execution as previously ordered. Two last attempts were made by Colonel Almers to stop the execution, including some by telephone, as he knew that executing uniformed prisoners of war was in violation of the 1929 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War. His appeals were unsuccessful, and the 15 Americans of the commando raid were executed on the morning of 26 March 1944, at Punta Bianca, south of La Spezia, in the municipality of Ameglia. Their bodies were buried in a mass grave that was camouflaged afterwards. Alexander zu Dohna-Schlobitten, a member of Dostler&#x27;s staff who, unaware of the existence of Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Commando Order&quot;, had refused to sign the execution order for the American commandos, was dismissed from the Wehrmacht for insubordination.


==Trial and execution==
Dostler was taken prisoner of war by the United States Army and, after it discovered the fate of the commando raiding team, was put on trial for war crimes on 8 May 1945. A military tribunal was held at the seat of the Supreme Allied Commander, the Royal Palace in Caserta, on 8 October 1945. In the first Allied war crimes trial carried out by the United States, he was accused of carrying out an illegal order. In his defense he maintained that he had not issued the order but had only passed it to Colonel Almers from Field Marshal Kesselring, and that the execution of the OSS men was a lawful order. Dostler&#x27;s plea of superior orders failed before the tribunal, which found that in ordering the mass execution he had acted on his own outside the Führer&#x27;s orders. The Military Commission also rejected his plea for clemency, declaring that the mass execution of the commando party was in violation of Article 2 of the 1929 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War, which prohibited acts of reprisals against prisoners of war. In its judgment the Commission stated that &quot;no soldier, and still less a Commanding General, can be heard to say that he considered the summary shooting of prisoners of war legitimate, even as a reprisal.&quot;

Under the 1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare, it was legal to execute spies and saboteurs disguised in civilian clothes or enemy uniforms, but not those captured in uniforms of their own army. Because the 15 U.S. soldiers were properly dressed in U.S. uniforms behind enemy lines, and not disguised in civilian clothes or enemy uniforms, they should not have been treated as spies but as prisoners of war, a principle which Dostler had violated in enforcing the order for execution.

The trial found Dostler guilty of war crimes, rejecting the &quot;superior orders&quot; defense. He was sentenced to death, and executed in Aversa by a 12-man firing squad at 08:00 on 1 December 1945. The execution was photographed on black and white still and movie cameras. Immediately after the execution Dostler&#x27;s body was lifted onto a stretcher, shrouded inside a white cotton mattress cover, and driven away in an army truck. His body was buried in Grave 93/95 of Section H at Pomezia German War Cemetery.

Of the Nazi war criminals to be executed by the U.S. military, Dostler was one of only two who were shot instead of hanged. The other exception was Curt Bruns.

<doc id="495688" wikidata="Q1357342" url="?curid=495688" title="New Era Party">
<text>The New Era Party (, JL) was a centre-right political party in Latvia. Founded in 2002, the party merged with Civic Union and Society for Other Politics to form Unity in 2011.

New Era was a member of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP), and its MEPs sat in the European People&#x27;s Party group (previously EPP-ED).

==History==
New Era was founded on 2 February 2002 by Einars Repše, a politician and central banker who was very popular at that time. Originally, most of the party candidates were political unknowns led by Repše.

In its first election campaign, New Era promised to combat corruption and tax evasion. According to New Era promises, eliminating tax evasion would increase Latvia&#x27;s state budget by 400 million Latvian lats (about 750 million United States dollars), allowing for increased funding for a variety of programs and also for tax cuts. Running on this platform, the party won 23.9% of the popular vote and 26 out of 100 seats in the 2002 legislative election and became the largest party in the Saeima, the parliament of Latvia. It formed a coalition government with 3 other parties, with the New Era leader Einars Repše as the prime minister. In January 2004, the coalition fell apart and Repše resigned.

New Era was in the opposition until October 2004, when it joined a coalition government led by Aigars Kalvītis of the People&#x27;s Party. It left the coalition after a vote-buying scandal in the Jūrmala municipal elections which involved one of its coalition partners, the Latvia&#x27;s First Party. The New Era Party first requested Latvia&#x27;s First Party to leave the coalition. After Latvia&#x27;s First Party and prime minister Kalvītis refused this demand, all New Era ministers resigned on 13 April 2006. In the October 2006 parliamentary elections, the New Era party won 18 seats. After the elections it did not rejoin the coalition government. Despite its significant losses, it became the largest opposition party.

Repše has lost most of his popularity, due to a sequence of scandals, but remains one of the party leaders. In March 2007, the party established a new structure, in which it had two leaders: Einars Repše and Arturs Krisjanis Karins. Arturs Krisjanis Karins is a United States citizen, born in the United States to a Latvian family.

In 2008, prominent MPs and members of the board—Ina Druviete, Karlis Sadurskis, Ilma Cepane and Sandra Kalniete—left the New Era to create Civic Union. Its leadership resigned, and Solvita Aboltina and Artis Kampars became new leaders. The chairman of the New Era parliamentary faction is Dzintars Zakis.

In March 2009, New Era Party member Valdis Dombrovskis, who served as finance minister from 2002 to 2004, became Prime Minister, bringing the New Era Party to the leadership of a 4-party, center-right coalition government.

On 6 August 2011, it merged with two other parties to form the new political party Unity.

==Ideology==

The New Era Party had strong populist leanings and derived most of its appeal from positioning itself as the main anti-corruption force in Latvian politics. New Era supporters characterized most of the other political parties as corrupt and controlled by oligarchs. As a result, New Era had very strained relations with most of the other political parties, which made a considerable effort to leave New Era in opposition whenever possible.

On ethnic issues, New Era tended to be somewhat nationalist. Its economic positions were uncertain and have changed over time. Its original platform in 2002 included radical free-market reforms in health care and education, such as replacing government-funded higher education by student loans.

<text>Kolpashevo () is a town and the administrative center of Kolpashevsky District in Tomsk Oblast, Russia, located on the Ob River. Population: 

==History==
It has existed since the beginning of the 17th century as a village. Town status was granted to it in 1938.

==Mass grave==

During the Great Purge, Kolpashevo was the site of mass executions carried out by the NKVD, with the corpses of those executed being disposed of in mass graves. In May 1979 meandering of the Ob river caused a mass grave containing more than 1,000 mummified corpses to become exposed. A number of cover-stories were issued by the local government, first that these bones were cattle bones, and then that these were the bodies of deserters from the Second World War. Instead most of the bodies were people from Tomsk. Yegor Ligachev, the provincial party chief, took charge of a cover-up operation to destroy the mass grave using tugs, and used the KGB to coerce local people to dispose of the corpses by sinking them, although some corpses turned up in the sluiceway of a sawmill downstream, mixed with logs floated downstream.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Kolpashevo serves as the administrative center of Kolpashevsky District, to which it is directly subordinated. As a municipal division, the town of Kolpashevo, together with three rural localities, is incorporated within Kolpashevsky Municipal District as Kolpashevskoye Urban Settlement.

==Transportation==
The town is served by the Kolpashevo Airport.

==Climate==
Kolpashevo has a subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfc&quot;), with very cold winters and short, warm summers. Precipitation is moderate and is somewhat higher in summer than at other times of the year.

<doc id="495724" wikidata="Q844500" url="?curid=495724" title="McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle">
<text>The McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing) F-15E Strike Eagle is an American all-weather multirole strike fighter derived from the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle. The F-15E was designed in the 1980s for long-range, high-speed interdiction without relying on escort or electronic-warfare aircraft. United States Air Force (USAF) F-15E Strike Eagles can be generally distinguished from other US Eagle variants by darker aircraft camouflage, conformal fuel tanks (CFTs) mounted along the engine intake ramps (although CFTs can also be mounted on earlier F-15 variants) and a tandem-seat cockpit.

Initially designed and manufactured by McDonnell Douglas, the F-15E first flew in 1986 and production continued under Boeing following the companies&#x27; merger in 1997. The aircraft became the USAF&#x27;s primary strike fighter/interdictor starting near the end of the Cold War, gradually replacing the F-111 Aardvark. The Strike Eagle has been deployed for military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, and Libya, among others. During these operations, the strike fighter has carried out deep strikes against high-value targets and combat air patrols, and provided close air support for coalition troops. It has also been exported to several countries. The F-15E is expected to remain in USAF service until the 2030s. Enhanced versions of the design, called the F-15 Advanced Eagle, remain in production.

==Development==

===Origins===
The McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle was introduced by the USAF to replace its fleet of McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom IIs. Unlike the F-4, the F-15 was designed for air superiority with little consideration for a ground-attack role; the F-15 Special Project Office opposed the idea of F-15s performing interdiction, giving rise to the phrase &quot;Not a pound for air to ground.&quot; In service, the F-15 has been a successful fighter, scoring over 100 aerial combat victories and zero losses in air-to-air combat as of 2007.

Despite a lack of official interest, McDonnell Douglas had quietly included a basic secondary ground attack capability in the F-15&#x27;s design since the beginning and worked on an F-15-derived interdictor fighter. The company envisaged the aircraft as a replacement for the General Dynamics F-111 and the remaining F-4s, as well as to augment the existing F-15s. In 1978, the USAF initiated the Tactical All-Weather Requirement Study, which looked at McDonnell Douglas&#x27;s proposal and other options such as the purchase of further F-111Fs. The study recommended the F-15E as the USAF&#x27;s future strike platform. In 1979, McDonnell Douglas and Hughes began a close collaboration on the development of the F-15E&#x27;s air-to-ground capabilities.

To assist in the F-15E&#x27;s development, McDonnell Douglas modified the second TF-15A prototype, AF serial number &quot;71-0291&quot;, as a demonstrator. The aircraft, known as the Advanced Fighter Capability Demonstrator, first flew on 8 July 1980. It was previously used to test conformal fuel tanks (CFTs), initially designed for the F-15 under the designation &quot;FAST Pack&quot;, with &quot;FAST&quot; standing for &quot;Fuel and Sensor, Tactical. It was subsequently fitted with a Pave Tack laser designator targeting pod to allow the independent delivery of guided bombs. The demonstrator was displayed at the 1980 Farnborough Airshow.

===Enhanced Tactical Fighter===
In March 1981, the USAF announced the Enhanced Tactical Fighter program to replace the F-111. The program was later renamed the Dual-Role Fighter (DRF) competition. The concept envisioned an aircraft capable of launching deep air interdiction missions without requiring additional support by fighter escort or jamming. General Dynamics submitted the F-16XL, while McDonnell Douglas submitted the F-15E. The Panavia Tornado was also a candidate, but since the aircraft lacked a credible air-superiority fighter capability, coupled with the fact that it was not American-made, it was not seriously considered.
The DRF evaluation team, under the direction of Brigadier General Ronald W. Yates, ran from 1981 through 30 April 1983, during which the F-15E logged more than 200 flights, demonstrated takeoff weight of more than , and validated 16 different weapons-carrying configurations. McDonnell Douglas, to assist &quot;71-0291&quot; in the evaluation, added to the program other F-15s, designated &quot;78-0468&quot;, &quot;80-0055&quot;, and &quot;81-0063&quot;. The single-engined F-16XL was a promising design, which with its radically redesigned cranked-delta wing, greatly boosted performance; if selected, the single- and two-seat versions were to be designated F-16E and F-16F, respectively. On 24 February 1984, the USAF chose the F-15E; key factors in the decision were the F-15E&#x27;s lower development costs compared to the F-16XL (US$270 million versus US$470 million), a belief that the F-15E had future growth potential, and possessing twin-engine redundancy. The USAF was initially expected to procure 400 aircraft, a figure later revised to 392.

Construction of the first three F-15Es started in July 1985. The first of these, &quot;86-0183&quot;, made its maiden flight on 11 December 1986. Piloted by Gary Jennings, the aircraft reached a maximum speed of Mach 0.9 and an altitude of 40,000 feet (12,000 m) during the 75-minute flight. This aircraft had the full F-15E avionics suite and the redesigned front fuselage, but not the aft fuselage and the common engine bay. The latter was featured on &quot;86-0184&quot;, while &quot;86-0185&quot; incorporated all the changes of the F-15E from the F-15. On 31 March 1987, the first officially completed F-15E made its first flight.

The first production F-15E was delivered to the 405th Tactical Training Wing, Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, in April 1988. Production continued into the 2000s with 236 produced for the USAF through 2001.

===Upgrade programs and replacement===

The F-15E was upgraded with the Raytheon AN/APG-82(V)1 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar after 2007, and the first test radar was delivered to Boeing in 2010. It combines the processor of the APG-79 used on the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet with the antenna of the APG-63(V)3 AESA being fitted on the F-15C; it was named APG-63(V)4 until it received the APG-82 designation in 2009. The new radar is to be part of the F-15E Radar Modernization Program, which also includes a wideband radome (enabling operation on more radar frequencies) and environment control and electronic warfare improvements. In 2015, Boeing and BAE Systems were awarded contracts to comprehensively upgrade of the electronic warfare system of all USAF F-15s, including the F-15E, with the AN/ALQ-250 Eagle Passive/Active Warning Survivability System (EPAWSS). The first F-15E retrofitted with EPAWSS was delivered in 2022.

Having a sturdier airframe rated for 8,000 hours of service life or up to 16,000 hours with proper depot maintenance programs, twice the lifetime of earlier variants, the F-15E is expected to remain in service past 2025. , the USAF&#x27;s F-15E fleet had an average age of 21 years and an average airframe flying time of 6,000 hours. In 2012, the USAF was reportedly considering future options, with no replacement for the F-15E being slated at that time.

The F-15E design would see some export success and Boeing continued developing upgrades for international customers. More radical upgrades to the air vehicle design resulted in the &quot;F-15 Advanced Eagle&quot; family that began with the F-15SA (Saudi Advanced) for the Royal Saudi Air Force, which first flew in 2013. It replaces the older hybrid electronic/mechanical system with a digital fly-by-wire control system that opens up two additional wing pylons and a revised wing structure for increased service life. The Advanced Eagle would have further developed variants with the F-15QA (Qatari Advanced) for the Qatari Emiri Air Force and the F-15EX Eagle II for the USAF. In FY 2020, USAF began procuring the F-15EX to replace the aging fleet of F-15C/D and supplement the F-22 Raptor to maintain air superiority fighter numbers, taking advantage of the existing export production line to quickly and affordably bring additional fighters into service; the F-15EX is also an option to replace the F-15E at a later time. Another choice is the F-35 Lightning II, set to replace other aircraft such as the F-16 Falcon; a &quot;F-35E&quot; variant was studied. Adding a second seat to the F-35 is complex and costly, especially to preserve its stealth profile; providing for greater range and payload would also be difficult tasks. Alternatively, the role could be covered by a combination of fighter and bomber aircraft, such as the B-21 Raider. The F-15E may also be replaced by a clean-sheet sixth-generation aircraft design.

===ALASA===
On 24 March 2014, Boeing won a $30.6 million contract from DARPA as part of the Airborne Launch Assist Space Access (ALASA) program. The goal of the program is to cut the cost of putting microsatellites into orbit by 66% through advances in launch systems. Under the 11-month contract, Boeing will build twelve launch vehicles, each with a payload capability up to . An ALASA vehicle is to be fitted under an F-15E, which will climb to 40,000 ft, then be released and fire its four engines to reach low-Earth orbit. Awarding the contract to Boeing would make use of the F-15E as the carriage vehicle, as previous design contracts had been given to Lockheed Martin to use the F-22 Raptor and Virgin Galactic to use their SpaceShip Two aircraft. DARPA had previously insisted they wanted to select an aircraft they would not need to modify heavily to carry and launch the ALASA payload. The project was terminated in late 2015.

==Design==

===Overview===

The F-15E&#x27;s deep-strike mission is a radical departure from the original intent of the F-15 since it was designed as an air-superiority fighter under the mantra &quot;not a pound for air-to-ground.&quot; The basic airframe, however, proved versatile enough to produce a very capable strike fighter. The F-15E, while designed for ground attack, retains the air-to-air lethality of the F-15, and can defend itself against enemy aircraft.

The F-15E prototype was a modification of the two-seat F-15B. Despite its origins and retaining the same aerodynamic shape, it includes significant structural changes as well as more powerful engines. The aft fuselage was designed to incorporate the more powerful engines with advanced engine bay structures and doors, which incorporate Superplastic forming and diffusion bonding technologies. The back seat is equipped for a weapon systems officer (WSO, pronounced &quot;wizzo&quot;) to work the air-to-ground avionics via multiple screens; these view the radar, electronic warfare, or thermographic cameras, monitor aircraft or weapons status and possible threats, select targets, and use an electronic moving map to navigate. Two hand controls are used to select new displays and to refine targeting information; displays can be moved from one screen to another using a menu of display options. Unlike previous two-place jets (e.g. the F-14 Tomcat and Navy variants of the F-4), whose back seat omitted flying controls, the F-15E&#x27;s back seat is equipped with its own stick and throttle so the WSO can take over flying, albeit with reduced visibility.

For extended range, the F-15E is fitted with two conformal fuel tanks (CFTs) that hug the fuselage to produce lower drag than conventional underwing/underbelly drop tanks. They carry 750 U.S. gallons (2,800 L) of fuel, and house six weapons hardpoints in two rows of three in tandem. Unlike conventional drop tanks, CFTs cannot be jettisoned, thus increased range is a trade-off for increased drag and weight compared to a &quot;clean&quot; configuration.

===Avionics===

The tactical electronic warfare system (TEWS) integrates all countermeasures on the craft: radar warning receivers, radar jammer, radar and chaff/flare dispensers are all tied to the TEWS to provide comprehensive defense against detection and tracking. This system includes an externally mounted ALQ-131 ECM pod which is carried on the centerline pylon when required. The MIDS Fighter Data Link Terminal, produced by BAE Systems, improves situational awareness and communications capabilities via the Link 16 datalink. The TEWS was replaced by the AN/ALQ-250 EPAWSS digital electronic warfare suite beginning in 2022; EPAWSS replaces all TEWS components with lighter and more capable digital ones for increased performance.

The APG-70 radar allows crews to detect ground targets from longer ranges; one feature is that, after a sweep of a target area, the crew may freeze the air-to-ground map then switch to air-to-air mode to scan for aerial threats. During air-to-surface weapon delivery, the pilot is capable of detecting, targeting, and engaging air-to-air targets while the WSO designates ground targets. The APG-70 was replaced by the AN/APG-82(V)1 AESA radar, which began flight tests in January 2010 and achieved initial operational capability in 2014.

Its inertial navigation system uses a laser gyroscope to continuously monitor the aircraft&#x27;s position and provide information to the central computer and other systems, including a digital moving map in both cockpits. The LANTIRN system is mounted externally under the engine intakes; it allows the aircraft to fly at low altitudes, at night, and in any weather conditions, to attack ground targets with a variety of precision-guided and unguided weapons. The LANTIRN system gives the F-15E exceptional accuracy in weapons delivery day or night and in poor weather, and consists of two pods attached to the exterior of the aircraft. At night, the video picture from the LANTIRN can be projected on the head-up display (HUD), producing an infrared image of the ground.
The AN/AAQ-13 navigation pod contains a terrain-following radar which allows the pilot to safely fly at a very low altitude following cues displayed on a HUD; it also can be coupled to the autopilot to provide &quot;hands off&quot; terrain-following capability. This pod also contains a forward-looking infrared system which is projected on the HUD, typically used during nighttime or low-visibility operations. The nav pod is installed beneath the right engine intake. The targeting pod contains a laser designator and a tracking system that mark an enemy for destruction as far away as 10 mi (16 km). Once tracking has started, targeting information is automatically handed off to infrared homing air-to-surface missiles or laser-guided bombs. The targeting pod is mounted beneath the left engine intake; configurations may be either the AN/AAQ-14, AN/AAQ-28(V) Litening, or the AN/AAQ-33 Sniper.

The F-15E carries most air-to-ground weapons in the USAF inventory. It is also armed with AIM-9 Sidewinders and AIM-120 AMRAAMs, retaining the counter-air capabilities of its Eagle lineage, being fully capable of Offensive-Counter-Air operations. Like the F-15C, it also carries an internally mounted General Electric M61A1 20 mm cannon with 500 rounds, which is effective against enemy aircraft and &quot;soft&quot; ground targets.

Since 2004, South Korean firm LIG Nex1 has been manufacturing the F-15&#x27;s Head-up display; a total number of 150 HUDs were delivered by 2011. LIG Nex1 had been a participant in the F-15K program as a subcontractor to Rockwell Collins. LIG Nex1 is also preparing to manufacture F-15&#x27;s new multi-function display and flight control computer. Also since 2004, Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) has produced the F-15&#x27;s wings and forward fuselages; in 2008, KAI established another production line for Singapore&#x27;s F-15SG. KAI is involved in the design and manufacture of the Conformal Weapons Bay (CWB) for the F-15 Silent Eagle.

===Engines===

The engines used on early aircraft are the same as on previous F-15 variants, the Pratt &amp; Whitney F100-PW-220 each producing of thrust in afterburner. Later batches feature the more powerful F100-PW-229 engines with of thrust each. Saudi Arabian and Israeli aircraft are also initially equipped with the F100-229 engines. While the F-15E had also been flight tested with the General Electric F110-GE-129 with of thrust, the South Korean F-15K would be the first variant to adopt it in service. The F-15K would have two different engine types; the first batch are powered by F110-129 engines, while the second batch are powered by F100-229 engines. In 2008, Saudi Arabia decided to re-engine their F-15S fleet with the F110-129 engines, which also enables commonality with their F-15SA fleet. The Singapore Air Force equipped their F-15SG fleet with F110-129 engines.

==Operational history==

===United States===
The F-15E was first delivered to the U.S. Air Force operational units in 1988. The F-15E reached initial operational capability on 30 September 1989 at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina with the 4th Tactical Fighter Wing, 336th Tactical Fighter Squadron.

====Gulf War====
The F-15E was deployed in response to Iraq&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 for Operation Desert Shield. The 336th Tactical Fighter Squadron flew to Seeb Air Base in Oman to begin training exercises in anticipation of an Iraqi attack on Saudi Arabia; in December, the 335th and 336th squadrons relocated to Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia, closer to Iraq&#x27;s border. At the start of Operation Desert Storm, 24 F-15Es launched an attack on five fixed Scud installations in western Iraq on 17 January 1991. Missions against Scud sites continued through that night with a second strike of 21 F-15Es. At night-time, F-15Es flew hunter missions over western Iraq, searching for mobile SCUD launchers. By conducting random bombings in suspected areas, it was hoped to deter the Iraqis from setting up for a Scud launch.

On the war&#x27;s opening night, an F-15E failed to hit a MiG-29 with an AIM-9 Sidewinder; other F-15Es also unsuccessfully engaged this lone MiG-29, which was eventually brought down by a missile of unknown origin. On 18 January, during a strike against a petrol oil and lubricant plant near Basrah, an F-15E was lost to enemy fire, killing both pilot and WSO. F-15E crews described this mission as the most difficult and dangerous of the war as it was heavily defended by SA-3s, SA-6s, SA-8s and Rolands as well as by anti-aircraft artillery. Two nights later, a second and final F-15E was downed by an Iraqi SA-2; the crew survived and evaded capture for several days and made contact with coalition aircraft, but a rescue was not launched due to security issues over an airman who failed to identify himself with proper codes. The Iraqis later captured both airmen.

F-15Es destroyed 18 Iraqi jets on the ground at Tallil air base using GBU-12s and CBU-87s. On 14 February, an F-15E scored its only air-to-air kill of the war: a Mil Mi-24 helicopter. While responding to a request for help by US Special Forces, five Iraqi helicopters were spotted. The lead F-15E of two, via its FLIR, acquired a helicopter in the process of unloading Iraqi soldiers, and released a GBU-10 bomb. The F-15E crew thought the bomb had missed its target and were preparing to use a Sidewinder when the helicopter was destroyed. The Special Forces team estimated that the Hind was roughly over the ground when the bomb hit its target. As another Coalition bombing operation had commenced, the F-15Es disengaged from combat with the remaining helicopters.

F-15Es struck heavily defended targets throughout Iraq, prioritizing SCUD missile sites. Missions aimed at killing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein were undertaken by F-15Es, bombing several suspected locations. Prior to the ground war, F-15Es flew tank plinking missions against Iraqi vehicles in Kuwait. After 42 days of combat, a cease fire came into effect on 1 March 1991, leading to the creation of Northern and Southern no-fly zones over Iraq.

====Operations Southern Watch and Northern Watch====
Following Desert Storm, two no-fly zones over Iraq were set up, and enforced typically by US and UK aircraft. In one incident, an attack on up to 600 Kurdish refugees by Iraqi helicopters at Chamchamal, northern Iraq, was observed by a flight of F-15Es. As they were not allowed to open fire, the F-15Es instead conducted several high speed passes as close as possible to the Iraqi helicopters to create severe wake-turbulence, while aiming lasers at the helicopter&#x27;s cockpits to attempt to blind their crews; this caused the crash of one Hind. Afterwards, USAF leadership ordered F-15Es not to fly below to deter a repetition.

F-15Es of the 391st Fighter Squadron, 492d Fighter Squadron, and 494th Fighter Squadron regularly deployed to Turkey throughout the 1990s. In January 1993, in breach of the ceasefire agreement, Iraqi targets below the 32nd parallel north were attacked; 10 F-15Es conducted a punitive strike days later. Most missions were of a defensive nature, the Strike Eagles carried a flexible range of weapons on a typical mission. AWACS aircraft were in close contact with F-15E crews, who would receive new taskings while airborne and thus could fly unplanned attacks on Iraqi targets. After 1993, no-fly zone violations were minimal as Iraq staged a minor withdrawal; in 1997, Turkey approved the creation of Operation Northern Watch (ONW) and permitted US forces to use the Incirlik air base.

In December 1998, Operation Desert Fox was conducted when Iraq refused UNSCOM inspections. On 28 December 1998, three F-15Es struck an SA-3 tracking radar and optical guidance unit, each dropping two GBU-12 500-pound precision-guided munitions (PGMs). After Desert Fox, Iraq frequently violated the no-fly zones, thus F-15Es conducted several pre-planned retaliatory strikes; in ONW alone, weapons were expended on at least 105 days. Between 24 and 26 January 1999, F-15Es expended several AGM-130s and GBU-12s against SAM sites near Mosul, northern Iraq. They also flew in support of Operation Provide Comfort and Operation Provide Comfort II.

====Operations in the Balkans====
Operation Deny Flight was a United Nations-enforced no-fly zone over Bosnia and Herzegovina due to the deteriorating situation in the Balkans. In August 1993, F-15Es from 492nd and 494th FS deployed to Aviano, Italy. In late 1993, NATO ordered a limited F-15E strike at Udbina airfield, targeting Serbian forces in neighboring Croatia. Eight F-15Es armed with GBU-12s took off to attack an SA-6 anti-aircraft vehicle; the mission was cancelled mid-flight over the application of stringent Rules of Engagement. In December 1993, F-15Es launched to destroy a pair of SA-2s which had fired upon two Royal Navy Sea Harrier FRS 1s. In August 1995, F-15Es of 90th Fighter Squadron were also deployed. The 492d and 494th flew over 2,500 sorties since starting Deny Flight, 2,000 of these by 492d. In August 1995, in support of NATO&#x27;s Operation Deliberate Force, F-15Es flew strike missions against Serbian armor and logistics around the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo. On 9 September, an F-15E deployed the type&#x27;s first GBU-15 bomb; dropping nine on Bosnian-Serb ground forces and air defense targets near Banja Luka.

In response to the displacement of Kosovars and the Serbian government&#x27;s rejection of a NATO ultimatum, Operation Allied Force was launched in March 1999. A total of 26 F-15Es flew the first strikes of Allied Force against Serb surface-to-air-missile sites, anti-aircraft batteries and early warning radar stations. Strike Eagles were deployed to Aviano as well as RAF Lakenheath in the UK. In-theater, F-15Es conducted close air support (CAS) missions, a popular concept within the USAF. Missions typically lasted around 7.5 hours, included two aerial refuelings; F-15Es would carry a mix of air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions to perform both combat air patrol duties as well as strike missions in the same mission. Mobile SAM launchers posed a considerable threat to NATO aircraft and had made successful shoot-downs, most notably of a Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk. In order to strike from increased distances, the F-15E was equipped with the AGM-130, which provided a stand-off strike capability.

====Operation Enduring Freedom====
Weeks after the in 2001, the 391st Fighter Squadron deployed to Ahmad al-Jaber air base, Kuwait, to support Operation Enduring Freedom during the War in Afghanistan. F-15Es met little resistance during initial missions. On the first night, the main targets were Taliban military structures, supply depots, and al-Qaeda training camps and caves. Both the AGM-130 and GBU-15 bombs were expended; this was the GBU-15&#x27;s first combat usage. GBU-24s and GBU-28s were used against reinforced targets, command and control centers and cave entrances. F-15Es often operated in pairs alongside pairs of F-16Cs. Within weeks of the start of combat operations, there was a lack of targets to strike as nearly all targets had been already destroyed. The Taliban had access to SA-7 and FIM-92 Stinger portable surface-to-air missiles, posing no threat to most aircraft flying above . Additionally, fixed SAM sites near cities as Mazar-i-Sharif and Bagram were struck early on; Afghanistan had rapidly become a low-threat environment for air operations.

Aircraft commonly flew on-call support missions for allied ground forces, F-15Es usually carried MK-82 and GBU-12 bombs in this role, other weapons were sometimes carried, during one mission a GBU-28, two GBU-24s and six GBU-12s were released. Frequent targets during the rest of the war were individual insurgents, light vehicles and supply convoys; cannon fire was often expended as well as bombs from F-15Es. It was during combat over Afghanistan that four 391st crews conducted the longest fighter mission in history; lasting a total of 15.5 hours, nine of those hours spent flying over the target area. Two F-15Es attacked two Taliban command and control facilities, two buildings suspected of being used by Taliban fighters, and a road block; the F-15Es refueled 12 times during the mission.
On 4 March, another incident known as the Battle of Roberts&#x27; Ridge involved several F-15Es performing a CAS mission. Aircraft destroyed a Taliban observation post and responded to nearby enemy mortar fire upon Navy SEAL forces searching for an ambushed MH-47E Chinook in the Shah-i-Kot Valley. Several bombs were dropped as the SEAL team took fire, however one bomb missed due to the aircrew using incorrect coordinates. An MH-47 carrying a rescue team was downed by an RPG while attempting to support the SEALs. Following refueling, the F-15Es dropped a further 11 GBU-12s in coordination with ground forces, and fired their cannons on Taliban forces in close proximity to the survivors of the downed MH-47. F-16s of 18th Fighter Squadron also made strafing passes until cannon ammunition was depleted, then resorting to further bomb drops. The F-15Es suffered technical issues involving both radio and weapon failures, several GBU-12s were dropped before returning to Al Jaber in Kuwait.

Years later, several incidents occurred. On 23 August 2007, a friendly fire incident involved an F-15E mistakenly dropping a bomb on British forces, killing three soldiers; the stated cause was confusion between the air controller and the F-15E on the bombing coordinates. On 13 September 2009, an F-15E shot down a non-responsive MQ-9 Reaper drone over Northern Afghanistan to prevent it entering foreign airspace.

====Operation Iraqi Freedom====
In late 2002, during tension over suspected Iraqi possession of weapons of mass destruction, the 4th Fighter Wing at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base was ordered to maintain at least one squadron ready to deploy to the Persian Gulf. During January 2003, the 336th was deployed to Al Udeid Air Base, Qatar, in coordination with planners of the Combined Air Operations Center at Prince Sultan Air Base, Saudi Arabia. In late January, F-15Es began flying in Operation Southern Watch, typically performing surveillance and reconnaissance missions. Additional roles included simulated combat against potential Iraqi targets and regional familiarization with local procedures and rules of engagement. During OSW, F-15Es struck targets in southern and western Iraq, including radars, radio stations, command and control sites, and air defences. On one night, four F-15Es released multiple GBU-24s on the Iraqi Republican Guard/Baath Party HQ in Basrah while another flight of four destroyed a nearby Air Defense Sector HQ with six GBU-10s.

In late February, the 336th received additional aircrews, many drafted from the two non-deployable squadrons at Seymour Johnson (the 333d and 334th Fighter Squadrons) and 391st Fighter Squadron at Mountain Home Air Force Base, for a total of four aircrews per F-15E. In March, the 335th Fighter Squadron&#x27;s personnel and aircraft joined the 336th at Al Udeid. One objective was the destruction of Iraq&#x27;s air defenses and Early Warning radar network near the Jordanian border, allowing F-16s and helicopters to operate from Jordan from the war&#x27;s outset. Several radar sites and radio relay stations were hit in western Iraq near the &quot;H3&quot; airfield, encountering heavy anti-aircraft fire.

On 19 March, as F-117 Nighthawks dropped bombs over Baghdad, targeting a house where Saddam Hussein was believed to be; F-15Es dropped GBU-28s around the H3 airfield. On 20 March, the effective start of the war, F-15Es fired AGM-130s against communication, command and control buildings, and other key targets in Baghdad; some weapons missed their intended targets, possibly due to jamming by EA-6B Prowlers in the vicinity. On 3 April 2003, an F-15E mistook a USA M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) for an Iraqi surface-to-air missile site and dropped a laser-guided bomb, killing three and wounding five others.

On 7 April 2003, an F-15E, crewed by Captain Eric Das and Major William Watkins, performed a key interdiction mission in support of special forces, but crashed near Tikrit, Iraq. Das and Watkins were posthumously awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Purple Heart. During the war, F-15Es were credited with destroying 60% of the Iraqi Medina Republican Guard&#x27;s total force; they also struck 65 MiGs on the ground, and destroyed key air defense and command buildings in Baghdad. F-15Es worked with other jets deployed to Al Udeid, including RAAF F/A-18s, USAF F-16s and F-117s, RAF Panavia Tornados and US Navy F-14s.

====Operation Odyssey Dawn====
Following the adoption of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 on 17 March 2011, 18 USAF F-15Es were amongst other NATO and allied aircraft were deployed to enforce the Libyan no-fly zone as part of Operation Odyssey Dawn. On 21 March 2011, an F-15E from the 492d Fighter Squadron crashed near Bengazi, Libya. Both crew members parachuted into territory held by resistance elements of the Libyan population and were eventually rescued by US Marines. Equipment problems caused a weight imbalance and contributed to the crash when leaving the target area.

====Operations against Islamic State (2014–present)====
USAF F-15Es have participated in Operation Inherent Resolve against Islamic State (IS) militants in Iraq and Syria. On the morning of 23 September 2014, numerous American and Arab aircraft conducted air strikes in Syria against IS fighters, training compounds, headquarters and command and control facilities, storage facilities, a finance center, supply trucks, and armed vehicles. The Pentagon released videos of targets hit by ordnance deployed by F-15Es, taken by their AN/AAQ-33 Sniper targeting pods. Between August 2014 and January 2015, F-15Es flew 37 percent of all USAF sorties.
USAF F-15Es based at RAF Lakenheath in the United Kingdom performed several long range strikes against IS camps and prominent figures in Libya. On 13 November 2015, a pair of F-15Es killed Abu Nabil al-Anbari, the leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in Libya, in a strike near Darnah, Eastern Libya. On 20 February 2016, USAF F-15Es hit an IS training camp near Sabratha where foreign fighters were based, reportedly killing Noureddine Chouchane, a 36-year-old Tunisian jihadist linked to the 2015 Sousse attacks. Sources said that 49 people were killed and 6 wounded; two Serbians kidnapped by IS in 2015 were also reportedly killed.

On 8 June 2017, an F-15E shot down a pro-Syrian Regime UAV near Al Tanf, Syria; according to OIR officials, it was downed after deploying &quot;one of several weapons it was carrying near a position occupied by Coalition personnel... [It was] similar in size to a U.S. MQ-1 Predator&quot;. The drone may have been a Shahed 129; on 20 June 2017, a second Shahed-129 was downed by an F-15E near the 50 mile exclusion zone around Al-Tanf.

On 21 August 2021, a USAF F-15E shot down an unidentified drone with an AIM-9X Sidewinder missile as the drone approached US forces in Eastern Syria.

USAF F-15Es were deployed on 2 February 2024, during the airstrikes against Iranian backed militias in Iraq and Syria. USAF F-15Es helped blunt an Iranian attack against Israel on 13 April 2024 by shooting down over 70 Iranian one-way attack UAVs.

Concurrent with the fall of the Assad regime on 8 December, USAF F-15Es were deployed alongside B-52s and A-10s in what the USAF said were &quot;dozens&quot; of airstrikes against over 75 ISIS targets. The strikes were intended to prevent ISIS from benefitting from the political upheaval in Syria.

===Israel===
The F-15I is operated by the Israeli Defense Force/Air Force No 69 Squadron, succeeding the F-4 Phantom II. It is used akin to a strategic bomber due to its long range, high munition capacity and advanced systems.

After the Gulf War in 1991, in which Israeli towns were attacked by SCUD missiles based in Iraq, the Israeli government decided a long range strike aircraft was needed, issuing a Request for Information (RFI). In response, Lockheed Martin offered a version of the F-16 Fighting Falcon, while McDonnell Douglas offered both the F/A-18 Hornet and the F-15E. On 27 January 1994, the Israeli government announced their intention to buy 21 modified F-15Es, designated &quot;F-15I&quot;. On 12 May 1994, the US Government authorized the purchase of up to 25 F-15Is by Israel. In November 1995, Israel ordered four extra F-15Is; 25 were built from 1996 to 1998. Some of the air-to-air missiles aircraft can carry: the AIM-9L, Rafael Python 4 and the Rafael Python 5 infrared-homing missiles; and the AIM-7 Sparrow and the AIM-120 AMRAAM radar-guided missiles. In 1999, Israel announced its intention to procure more fighters and that a possible contender was the F-15I. However, the contract went to the F-16I.

===Saudi Arabia===
In November 2009, Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) F-15s, along with Saudi Tornados, performed air raids amid the Houthi insurgency in north Yemen. It was the RSAF&#x27;s first military action over hostile territory since Operation Desert Storm. In October 2010, Saudi Arabia requested 84 F-15SA (Saudi Advanced) fighters, upgrading of its existing F-15S fleet to F-15SA standard, and related equipment and weapons through a Foreign Military Sale (FMS). On 29 December 2011, the U.S. signed a $29.4 billion contract to sell 84 F-15SAs, as well as the F-15S upgrades. In June 2012, an FMS contract for 68 F-15S to F-15SA modification kits was placed with Boeing; the upgraded aircraft are designated the F-15SR. On 20 February 2013, the maiden flight of the first new-build F-15SA occurred.

====Saudi-led intervention in Yemen (2015–present)====
On 26 March 2015, Saudi F-15Ss, along with other Arab coalition assets, started striking targets in Yemen as part of the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, called &quot;Operation Decisive Storm&quot;. Opposing a joint force composed of former Houthi rebels and Yemeni Army forces, the strikes, at least initially, were met by ineffective anti-aircraft fire that reportedly only caused damage when falling to the ground. Early strikes were aimed at air defense sites, Army HQs, military airports, ballistic missiles depots, and launchers. During these attacks, a Saudi F-15S crashed into the Gulf of Aden after circling over the sea; its two pilots ejected safely and were recovered from the sea by a USAF HH-60G rescue helicopter; Arab coalition reports claimed enemy fire was not involved, while Houthi and Iranian sources claimed they had shot it down. On 8 January 2018, a RSAF F-15S was reportedly shot down by a Houthi surface-to-air missile; a Houthi-released video shows the F-15 increasing speed and releasing decoy flares before being struck by a projectile and apparently suffering major damage. On 9 January 2018, the Houthi media, Al-Masirah, announced that the F-15 had been damaged but did not crash.

On 21 March 2018, Houthi rebels released a video allegedly showing a RSAF F-15 being hit in Saada province by a R-27 air to air missile adapted for surface to air use. As in the video of the previous similar hit recorded on 8 January, the target, while clearly hit, seems not falling to the ground when the video stops. Saudi forces confirmed the hit, while saying the jet safely landed at a Saudi base. Saudi sources confirmed the incident involved a surface-to-air missile being launched at the jet from inside Saada airport.

==Variants==

===F-15E variants===
;F-15E
:Two-seat all-weather long-range strike and ground-attack aircraft for the USAF. A total of 236 were built from 1985 to 2001.
;F-15I
:The F-15I is operated by the Israeli Air Force where it is known as the &quot;Ra&#x27;am&quot; (רעם – &quot;Thunder&quot;). It is a dual-seat ground attack aircraft powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney F100-PW-229 engines, and is based on the F-15E.

:The F-15I features different avionic systems to USAF F-15E to meet Israeli requirements. Initially, Sharpshooter targeting pods designed for IAF F-16s were fitted for night-time strikes, but were less capable than the LANTIRN pods used on USAF F-15Es; Israel later bought 30 LANTIRN pods. The F-15Is initially lacked Radar Warning Receivers; Israel installed its own Elisra SPS-2110 electronic warfare equipment as well as a new central computer and embedded GPS/INS system. All sensors can be slaved to the Display and Sight Helmet (DASH) helmet-mounted sight, providing both crew members a means of targeting which the F-15E lacks. The F-15I uses the APG-70I radar; its terrain mapping capability can locate targets difficult to spot while under adverse weather conditions and can detect large airliner-sized targets at , and fighter-sized targets at ; it has a reduced resolution one-third below the APG-70. In January 2016, Israel approved F-15I upgrades such as structural changes, an AESA radar, updated avionics, and new weapons.
;F-15K
:The F-15K Slam Eagle (Korean: F-15K 슬램 이글) is a derivative of the F-15E, operated by the Republic of Korea Air Force. Several major components were outsourced to South Korean companies under an offset agreement, wherein South Korea was responsible for 40% of production and 25% of assembly. The fuselage and wings are supplied by Korea Aerospace Industries, flight control actuator by Hanwha Corporation, electronic jammer and radar warning receiver by Samsung Thales, head-up display, airborne communication system, and radar by LIG Nex1, and engines by Samsung Techwin under license before final assembly at Boeing&#x27;s St. Louis facility.

:In 2002, ROKAF selected the F-15K for its F-X fighter program, during which the F-15K, the Dassault Rafale, the Eurofighter Typhoon and Sukhoi Su-35 were evaluated. A total of 40 aircraft were ordered, deliveries began in 2005. On 25 April 2008, a second batch of 21 F-15Ks were ordered, worth 2.3 trillion Korean won (US$2.3 billion). This second batch differs from first batch aircraft in having Pratt &amp; Whitney F100-PW-229 (EEP) engines, license-produced by Samsung Techwin, for commonality with the KF-16 fleet. ROKAF had received 50 F-15Ks by June 2011. ROKAF expects the F-15K to be in service until 2060.

:The F-15K has several atypical features to the F-15E, such as an AAS-42 infra-red search and track system, a customized Tactical Electronics Warfare Suite to reduce weight and increase jamming effectiveness, cockpit compatibility with night vision devices, ARC-232 U/VHF radio with Link 16 and advanced APG-63(V)1 mechanical-scanned array radar. The APG-63(V)1 radar has common digital processing equipment with the APG-63(V)3 AESA radar, and can be upgraded to an AESA radar via antenna replacement. The F-15K is equipped with the Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System and weapons such as AGM-84K SLAM-ER, AGM-84H Harpoon Block II, and KEPD 350. In December 2022, South Korea approved to upgrade all of its 59 F-15Ks with new components, including AN/APG-82(V)1 AESA radar, AN/ALQ-250 EPAWSS electronic warfare system, and ADCP II mission computer.
;F-15S
:The F-15S is a variant of the F-15E supplied to the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) in the 1990s. Saudi Arabia previously sought to buy up to 24 F-15Fs, a proposed single-seat variant, but was blocked by the U.S. Congress. The F-15S, initially referred to as F-15XP, is almost identical to the USAF F-15E, the only major difference in the AN/APG-70 radar&#x27;s performance in synthetic aperture mode. 72 were built from 1996 to 1998. In October 2007, GE announced a US$300 million contract with Saudi Arabia for 65 GE F110-GE-129C engines for the F-15S. The F-15S fleet is being upgraded to a broadly comparable configuration as the later F-15SA (Saudi Advanced) and designated F-15SR with 66 aircraft planned to be upgraded by 2026.
;F-15SG
:The F-15SG (formerly F-15T) is a variant ordered by the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) after an evaluation involving five other fighters. It was chosen on 6 September 2005 over the Dassault Rafale, the only other remaining aircraft in contention. On 22 August 2005, the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) notified Congress of a potential Foreign Military Sale (FMS) of weapons, logistics and training to Singapore; options included AIM-120C and AIM-9X missiles; GBU-38 JDAM and AGM-154 JSOW air-to-ground weapons, AN/APG-63(V)3, night vision goggles and Link 16 terminals. The F-15F designation was also reserved. An order for 12 F-15SGs was placed in December 2005. On 22 October 2007, Singapore exercised an option for eight more F-15SGs within the original contract. Four more were later bought. The first F-15SG was rolled out on 3 November 2008; deliveries began in 2009; all 24 were declared operational in September 2013. Further F-15SGs were ordered, including 8 in 2010 and 8 in 2014, for a total of 40 F-15SGs by 2018. The RSAF currently qualifies personnel on the F-15SG via the 428th Fighter Squadron, a joint USAF-RSAF unit located at Mountain Home Air Force Base.

===F-15 Advanced Eagle variants===

The F-15 Advanced Eagle represents a more substantial upgrade baseline over previous models in that it has a new fly-by-wire control system and wing structure that enables two additional underwing weapons hardpoints (increasing the number from nine to eleven). Additional enhancements include the option of a large area display cockpit, the Raytheon AN/APG-82(V)1 or APG-63(V)3 AESA radar, General Electric F110-129 engines, digital Joint Helmet-Mounted Cueing Systems for pilot and WSO, and a digital electronic warfare system among other enhancements. Advanced Eagle variants include the F-15SA (Saudi Advanced), F-15QA (Qatari Advanced), F-15EX Eagle II, and F-15IA (Israeli Advanced).

===Proposed variants===
;F-15F
:Proposed single-seat F-15E variant for Saudi Arabia. Later preliminarily assigned to F-15SGs.

;F-15G
:A F-15G Wild Weasel was a proposed two-seat version to replace the F-4G Wild Weasel in the suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD) role. The F-15G was studied in 1986. A proposed modification to F-15Cs for the SEAD role was studied in 1994–95, but F-16Cs were modified to perform this role instead. 

;F-15H
:The F-15H Strike Eagle (H for Hellas) was a 1990s proposed export version of F-15E for Greece, which was selected by the Greek Ministry of Defence and the Hellenic Air Force, but the government chose new F-16s and Mirage 2000-5s instead.

;F-15SE Silent Eagle
:The F-15SE Silent Eagle was a proposed variant with fifth generation fighter features, such as internal weapons carriage and radar-absorbent material. The Silent Eagle featured conformal weapons bays (CWB) to hold weapons internally instead of conformal fuel tanks, the twin vertical tails are canted outward 15 degrees to reduce radar cross section; the majority of the CWB&#x27;s area is for weapons storage, a minority is used for fuel storage. The F-15SE was optimized for air-to-air missions, lacking all-aspect stealth features for missions inside areas protected by ground-based anti-aircraft systems. The first production F-15E, s/n &quot;86-0183&quot;, was modified to become a Silent Eagle demonstrator. It first flew in July 2010 with a left-side conformal weapons bay, and successfully launched an AMRAAM missile from the CWB in July 2010. Potential customers were Saudi Arabia, Israel, Japan, and South Korea; however the Saudis chose to procure the less ambitious F-15SA which became the first F-15 Advanced Eagle variant, while Israel, Japan, and South Korea selected the F-35. Some of the proposed F-15SE features were carried over to the F-15 Advanced Eagle family.

;F-15GSE Global Strike Eagle
:The F-15GSE was a 2006 proposal for a space strike version of the F-15E, for attacking satellites. It was to be an unmanned remotely-piloted variant, carrying a 3-stage-to-orbit solid rocket ASAT missile on its back between the twin-tails.

<doc id="495725" wikidata="Q2166376" url="?curid=495725" title="Titanium-sapphire laser">
<text>A titanium-sapphire laser (also known as a Ti:sapphire laser, Ti:Al2O3 laser or Ti:sapph) is a tunable laser which emits red and near-infrared light in the range from 650 to 1100 nanometers. This type of laser is mainly used in scientific research because of its tunability and its ability to generate ultrashort pulses, thanks to its broad light emission spectrum. Lasers based on Ti:sapphire were first constructed and invented in June 1982 by Peter Moulton at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory.

Titanium-sapphire refers to the lasing medium, a crystal of sapphire (Al2O3) that is doped with Ti3+ ions. A Ti:sapphire laser is usually pumped with another laser with a wavelength of 514 to 532 nm, for which argon-ion lasers (514.5 nm) and frequency-doubled , , and Nd:YVO lasers (527–532 nm) are used. They are capable of laser operation from 670 nm to  nm wavelength. Ti:sapphire lasers operate most efficiently at wavelengths near 800 nm.

==Types==
===Mode-locked oscillators===

Mode-locked oscillators generate ultrashort pulses with a typical duration between a few picoseconds and 10 femtoseconds, in special cases even around 5 femtoseconds (few carrier wave cycles in each laser pulses). The pulse repetition frequency is in most cases around 70 to 90 MHz, as given by the oscillator&#x27;s round-trip optical path, typically a few meters. Ti:sapphire oscillators are normally pumped with a continuous-wave laser beam from an argon or frequency-doubled laser. Typically, such an oscillator has an average output power of 0.4 to 2.5 watts (5.7 to 35 nJ in each laser pulse for the 70 MHz repetition rate).

===Chirped-pulse amplifiers===
These devices generate ultrashort, ultra-high-intensity pulses with a duration of 20 to 100 femtoseconds. A typical one stage amplifier can produce pulses of up to 5 millijoules in energy at a repetition frequency of 1000 hertz, while a larger, multistage facility can produce pulses up to several joules, with a repetition rate of up to 10 Hz. Usually, amplifier crystals are pumped with a pulsed frequency-doubled Nd:YLF laser at 527 nm and operate at 800 nm. Two different designs exist for the amplifier: regenerative amplifier and multi-pass amplifier.

Regenerative amplifiers operate by amplifying single pulses from an oscillator (see above). Instead of a normal cavity with a partially reflective mirror, they contain high-speed optical switches that insert a pulse into a cavity and take the pulse out of the cavity exactly at the right moment when it has been amplified to a high intensity.

The term &#x27;chirped-pulse&#x27; refers to a special construction that is necessary to prevent the pulse from damaging the components in the laser. The pulse is stretched in time so that the energy is not all located at the same point in time and space. This prevents damage to the optics in the amplifier. Then the pulse is optically amplified and recompressed in time to form a short, localized pulse. All optics after this point should be chosen to take the high energy density into consideration.

In a &quot;multi-pass amplifier&quot;, there are no optical switches. Instead, mirrors guide the beam a fixed number of times (two or more) through the Ti:sapphire crystal with slightly different directions. A pulsed pump beam can also be multi-passed through the crystal, so that more and more passes pump the crystal. First the pump beam pumps a spot in the gain medium. Then the signal beam first passes through the center for maximal amplification, but in later passes the diameter is increased to stay below the damage-threshold, to avoid amplification the outer parts of the beam, thus increasing beam quality and cutting off some amplified spontaneous emission and to completely deplete the inversion in the gain medium.
The pulses from chirped-pulse amplifiers are often converted to other wavelengths by means of various nonlinear optical processes.

At 5 mJ in 100 femtoseconds, the peak power of such a laser is 50 gigawatts. When focused by a lens, these laser pulses will ionise any material placed in the focus, including air molecules, and lead to short filament propagation and strong nonlinear optics effects that generate a wide spectrum of wavelengths.

===Tunable continuous wave lasers===

Titanium-sapphire is especially suitable for pulsed lasers since an ultrashort pulse inherently contains a wide spectrum of frequency components. This is due to the inverse relationship between the frequency bandwidth of a pulse and its time duration, due to their being conjugate variables. However, with an appropriate design, titanium-sapphire can also be used in continuous wave lasers with extremely narrow linewidths tunable over a wide range.

== History and applications ==
The Ti:sapphire laser was invented by Peter Moulton in June 1982 at MIT Lincoln Laboratory in its continuous wave version. Subsequently, these lasers were shown to generate ultrashort pulses through Kerr-lens modelocking. Strickland and Mourou, in addition to others, working at the University of Rochester, showed chirped pulse amplification of this laser within a few years, for which these two shared in the 2018 Nobel Prize in physics (along with Arthur Ashkin for optical tweezers). The cumulative product sales of the Ti:sapphire laser has amounted to more than $600 million, making it a big commercial success that has sustained the solid state laser industry for more than three decades.

The ultrashort pulses generated by Ti:sapphire lasers in the time domain corresponds to mode-locked optical frequency combs in the spectral domain. Both the temporal and spectral properties of these lasers make them highly desirable for frequency metrology, spectroscopy, or for pumping nonlinear optical processes. One half of the Nobel prize for physics in 2005 was awarded to the development of the optical frequency comb technique, which heavily relied on the Ti:sapphire laser and its self-modelocking properties. The continuous wave versions of these lasers can be designed to have nearly quantum limited performance, resulting in a low noise and a narrow linewidth, making them attractive for quantum optics experiments. The reduced amplified spontaneous emission noise in the radiation of Ti:sapphire lasers lends great strength in their application as optical lattices for the operation of state-of-the-art atomic clocks. Apart from fundamental science applications in the laboratory, this laser has found biological applications such as deep-tissue multiphoton imaging and industrial applications cold micromachining. When operated in the chirped pulse amplification mode, they can be used to generate extremely high peak powers in the terawatt range, which finds use in nuclear fusion research.

<doc id="495729" wikidata="Q3496076" url="?curid=495729" title="Lacto vegetarianism">
<text>A lacto-vegetarian (sometimes referred to as a lactarian; from the Latin root lact-, &quot;milk&quot;) diet abstains from the consumption of meat as well as eggs, while still consuming dairy products such as milk, cheese (without animal rennet i.e., from microbial sources), yogurt, butter, ghee, cream, and kefir, as well as honey.

==History==
The concept and practice of lacto-vegetarianism among a significant number of people comes from ancient India.

An early advocate of lacto-vegetarianism was the Scottish physician George Cheyne who promoted a milk and vegetable-based diet to treat obesity and other health problems in the early 18th century.

During the 19th century, the diet became associated with naturopathy. German naturopaths Heinrich Lahmann and Theodor Hahn promoted lacto-vegetarian diets of raw vegetables, whole wheat bread, and dairy products such as milk.

In the 20th century, lacto-vegetarianism was promoted by the American biochemist Elmer McCollum and the Danish physician and nutritionist Mikkel Hindhede. In 1918, McCollum commented that &quot;lacto-vegetarianism should not be confused with strict vegetarianism. The former is, when the diet is properly planned, the most highly satisfactory plan which can be adopted in the nutrition of man.&quot;

Hindhede became a food advisor to the Danish government during World War I and was influential in introducing a lacto-vegetarian diet to the public. The system of rationing restricted meat and alcohol so the Danish population were mostly living on a diet of milk and vegetables. During the years of food restriction from 1917 to 1918, both mortality and morbidity decreased; the mortality rate dropped by 34%, the lowest death rate ever reported for Denmark. Hindhede&#x27;s dieting ideas expressed in his scientific publications, along with those written by other Scandinavian scientists, were translated in German and well received amongst the right-wing political spectrum in post-war Germany. Subsequently, lacto-vegetarianism was strongly supported by German life reformers (&quot;Lebensreform&quot;) and became influential on some of the leading exponents of the National Socialist movement.

The uric-acid free diet of Alexander Haig was lacto-vegetarian. On this diet only cheese, milk, nuts, certain vegetables, and white bread could be eaten.

Mahatma Gandhi was a notable lacto-vegetarian, who drank milk daily. In 1931, Gandhi commented that:

In 1936, Narasinh Narayan Godbole authored &quot;Milk: The Most Perfect Food&quot;, a book defending lacto-vegetarianism and promoting the consumption of dairy products in opposition to meat.

==Rennet==

Historically most commercial cheese was made with calf rennet, making this an issue for lacto-vegetarians. Fig and thistle rennet were used in ancient times but such plant-based rennets were not suitable for the manufacture of long-ripened cheese varieties so calf rennet became the standard until there was a shortage of supply.

John Smith in his book &quot;The Principles and Practice of Vegetarian Cookery&quot; in 1860 wrote about a &quot;vegetable rennet&quot; made from the flowers of &quot;Galium verum&quot;. In 1898, W. A. Macdonald in &quot;The Vegetarian&quot; magazine commented that fig and thistle rennet had been successful in experiment but only calf rennet had commercial significance. In India in the late 19th-century, the berries from &quot;Withania coagulans&quot; were used as a vegetarian rennet and sold in powdered capsules.

Most commercial cheese in the United States is currently made using chymosin. Some vegetarians consider this an acceptable alternative, whilst others do not as the gene used to make microbial chymosin originated from calves.

==Religion==
Lacto-vegetarian diets are popular with certain followers of the Dharmic religious traditions such as Jainism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Sikhism. The core of their beliefs behind a lacto-vegetarian diet is the law of ahimsa, or non-violence.

===Hinduism===
According to the Vedas (Hindu holy scriptures), all living beings are equally valued. Hindus believe that vegetarianism is vital for spiritual progress. It takes many more vegetables or plants to produce an equal amount of meat, many more lives are destroyed, and in this way more suffering is caused when meat is consumed. Although some suffering and pain is inevitably caused to other living beings to satisfy the human need for food, according to ahimsa, every effort should be made to minimize suffering. This is to avoid karmic consequences and show respect for living things, because all living beings are equally valued in these traditions, a vegetarian diet rooted in ahimsa is only one aspect of environmentally conscious living, relating to those beings affected by our need for food. However, this does not apply to all Hindus; some do consume meat, though usually not any form of beef.

In India, lacto vegetarian is considered synonymous to vegetarian, while eggs are considered a meat product. However, in other parts of the world, vegetarianism generally refers to ovo lacto vegetarianism instead, allowing eggs into the diet.

Many Hindu wrestlers are strict lacto-vegetarians and follow a Sattvic diet. A large part of their diet is milk, ghee, almonds and chickpeas.

===Jainism===

In the case of Jainism, the vegetarian standard is strict. It allows the consumption of only fruit and leaves that can be taken from plants without causing their death. This further excludes from the diet root vegetables like carrots, potatoes, onions, garlic, radish, turnips, turmeric, etc since uprooting plants is considered as bad karma in Jainism. Jains also do not consume honey since it is considered as stealing food and also because honey collecting destroys bee hives and bee eggs and bee larvae inside it.

===Sikhism===

The Namdharis, a Sikh sect follow a strict lacto-vegetarian diet and have quoted verses from the Guru Granth Sahib endorsing vegetarianism, they also advocate for cow protection. The Damdami Taksal also cite the Guru Granth Sahib and advocate a strict lacto-vegetarian diet. Eating meat is not allowed in any form including eggs, fish and gelatine.

==Lacto-vegetarians and vegans==

The primary difference between a vegan and a lacto-vegetarian diet is the avoidance of dairy products. Vegans do not consume dairy products, believing that their production causes the animal suffering or a premature death, or otherwise abridges animal rights.

<text>The Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) is a nonprofit science advocacy organization based in the United States. The UCS membership includes many private citizens in addition to professional scientists. Anne Kapuscinski, Professor of Environmental Studies and Director of the Coastal Science and Policy Program at the University of California, Santa Cruz, chairs the UCS Board of Directors , having replaced James J. McCarthy, Professor of Biological Oceanography at Harvard University and past president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

==History==
The Union of Concerned Scientists was founded in 1969 by faculty and students of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The organization&#x27;s founding document says it was formed to &quot;initiate a critical and continuing examination of governmental policy in areas where science and technology are of actual or potential significance&quot; and to &quot;devise means for turning research applications away from the present emphasis on military technology toward the solution of pressing environmental and social problems.&quot; The organization employs scientists, economists, and engineers engaged in environmental and security issues, as well as executive and support staff.

One of the co-founders was physicist and Nobel laureate Henry Kendall, who served for many years as chairman of the board of UCS.

In 1992, Kendall presided over the World Scientists&#x27; Warning to Humanity, which called for &quot;fundamental change&quot; to address a range of security and environmental issues. The document was signed by 1700 scientists, including a majority of the Nobel prize winners in the sciences.

In 1997, the UCS presented their &quot;World Scientists Call For Action&quot; petition to world leaders meeting to negotiate the Kyoto Protocol. The declaration asserted, &quot;A broad consensus among the world&#x27;s climatologists is that there is now &#x27;a discernible human influence on global climate. It urged governments to make &quot;legally binding commitments to reduce industrial nations&#x27; emissions of heat-trapping gases&quot;, and called global warming &quot;one of the most serious threats to the planet and to future generations.&quot; The petition was signed by &quot;more than 1,500 of the world&#x27;s most distinguished senior scientists, including the majority of Nobel laureates in science.&quot; When a petition that questioned the consensus was circulated by the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine, a small, privately-funded institute, was signed by more than 17,000 science graduates, UCS declared it a &quot;deliberate attempt to deceive the scientific community with misinformation.&quot;

In August 2008, the UCS purchased billboards at the airports in Denver, Colorado, and Minneapolis–Saint Paul, Minnesota, where the Democratic and Republican presidential conventions were to be held. The two nearly identical billboards showed the downtown areas of each convention city in a cross hairs, with the message that &quot;when only one nuclear bomb could destroy a city&quot; like Minneapolis or Denver, &quot;we don&#x27;t need 6,000.&quot; The name of Senator John McCain or Senator Barack Obama follows, with this admonition: &quot;It&#x27;s time to get serious about reducing the nuclear threat.&quot; The billboards were removed after a complaint from Northwest Airlines, the official airline of the Republican convention. The UCS has accused Northwest, whose headquarters were in Minnesota, of &quot;taking on a new role as censor&quot; and of having acted because it regarded the Minneapolis advertisement as &quot;scary&quot; and &quot;anti-McCain.&quot;

In June 2020, a UCS staffer named Ruth Tyson resigned and sent a 17-page open letter expressing her opinions on racial inequality in the organization, saying that ideas of black workers were routinely dismissed or given low priority. After reading the letter, UCS president Ken Kimmell responded by saying the criticism was fair, and that he believed it was reflective of a wider culture of white supremacy in society, vowing to address issues and diversify the UCS workforce. His successor, Johanna Chao Kreilick, was chosen in part for &quot;her track record of integrating racial justice into the work and culture of complex organizations&quot;.

In February 2025, noted environmental scientist and policy advocate Dr. Gretchen Goldman became the organization&#x27;s president. 

==Funding and governance==
According to the George C. Marshall Institute, the UCS was the fourth-largest recipient of foundation grants for &quot;climate-related activities&quot; in the period 2000–2002, a fourth of its $24M grant income being for that purpose. Charity Navigator – an independent non-profit organization that evaluates American charities – gave the UCS a four out of four star rating in the fiscal year ending in September 2018, with an overall score of 91.85 out of 100. According to the organization&#x27;s IRS Form 990, the UCS received $39.9 million in total revenue and had $3.1 million in expenses and $48.8 million in net assets for the tax year beginning October 1, 2017, and ending September 30, 2018.

In February 2004, the UCS published &quot;Scientific Integrity in Policymaking&quot;. The report criticized the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush for &quot;politicizing&quot; science. Some of the allegations include altering information in global warming reports by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and choosing members of scientific advisory panels based on their business interests rather than scientific experience. In July 2004, the UCS released an addendum to the report in which they criticize the Bush administration and allege that reports on West Virginia strip mining had been improperly altered, and that &quot;well-qualified&quot; nominees for government posts such as Nobel laureate Torsten Wiesel were rejected because of political differences. On April 2, 2004, John Marburger, the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, issued a statement claiming that incident descriptions in the UCS report are &quot;false&quot;, &quot;wrong&quot;, or &quot;a distortion&quot;, and dismissed the report as &quot;biased&quot;. UCS responded to the White House document by saying that Marburger&#x27;s claims were unjustified. UCS later wrote that from then on, the Bush administration was &quot;virtually silent&quot; about the issue.

==Issue stances==
UCS has been critical of proposed Generation III reactor designs. Edwin Lyman, a senior staff scientist at UCS, has challenged specific cost-saving design choices made for both the AP1000 and Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor.

The UCS endorsed the 2007 Forests Now Declaration, which calls for new market based mechanism to protect forests, as the group has recognised the importance of curbing deforestation to tackle climate change.

The group also supports governmental incentives for people who want to preserve undeveloped land instead of selling it to developers.

It opposes the use of space weapons, and work on reducing the number of nuclear weapons around the world.

On October 30, 2006, the UCS issued a press release claiming that high-ranking members of the U.S. Department of the Interior, including Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks Julie MacDonald, systematically tampered with scientific data in an effort to undermine the protection of endangered species and the Endangered Species Act.

On December 11, 2006, the UCS issued a statement calling for the restoration of scientific integrity to federal policy-making, which was signed by 10,600 leading scientists including Nobel laureates.

On May 23, 2007, the UCS cited a joint-study with MIT and issued a press release claiming that &quot;any test of the U.S. missile defense system that does not show whether an interceptor missile can distinguish between real warheads and decoys is irrelevant&quot; and &quot;contrived,&quot; and called for an end to the taxpayer-funded program until the system can show an ability to actually address &quot;real world threats.&quot;

On June 21, 2007, a UCS report charged the EPA with political manipulation of scientific data to influence updated US ozone regulations: &quot;The law says use the science, the science says lower the standard to safe levels,&quot; said Francesca Grifo, director of the UCS&#x27; Scientific Integrity Program. &quot;In disregarding its own scientists&#x27; analysis, the EPA is risking the health of millions of Americans.&quot;

In March 2011, the UCS held daily telephone media briefings related to the Fukushima nuclear accident.

<doc id="495733" wikidata="Q120293" url="?curid=495733" title="Cold welding">
<text>Cold welding or contact welding is a solid-state welding process in which joining takes place without fusion or heating at the interface of the two parts to be welded. Unlike in fusion welding, no liquid or molten phase is present in the joint.

Cold welding was first recognized as a general materials phenomenon in the 1940s. It was then discovered that two clean, flat surfaces of similar metal would strongly adhere if brought into contact while in a vacuum . Micro and nano-scale cold welding has shown potential in nanofabrication processes.

Applications include wire stock and electrical connections (such as insulation-displacement connectors and wire wrap connections).

== In space ==
Mechanical problems in early satellites were sometimes attributed to cold welding.

In 2009 the European Space Agency published a peer reviewed paper detailing why cold welding is a significant issue that spacecraft designers need to carefully consider. The paper also cites a documented example from 1991 with the Galileo spacecraft high-gain antenna.

One source of difficulty is that cold welding does not exclude relative motion between the surfaces that are to be joined. This allows the broadly defined notions of galling, fretting, stiction and adhesion to overlap in some instances. For example, it is possible for a joint to be the result of both cold (or &quot;vacuum&quot;) welding and galling (or fretting or impact). Galling and cold welding, therefore, are not mutually exclusive.

== Nanoscale ==
Unlike cold welding process at macro-scale which normally requires large applied pressures, scientists discovered that single-crystalline ultra-thin gold nanowires (diameters less than 10 nm) can be cold-welded together within seconds by mechanical contact alone, and under remarkably low applied pressures. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and in-situ measurements reveal that the welds are nearly perfect, with the same crystal orientation, strength and electrical conductivity as the rest of the nanowire. The high quality of the welds is attributed to the nanoscale sample dimensions, oriented-attachment mechanisms and mechanically assisted fast surface diffusion. Nanoscale welds were also demonstrated between gold and silver, and silver and silver, indicating that the phenomenon may be generally applicable and therefore offer an atomistic view of the initial stages of macroscopic cold welding for either bulk metals or metallic thin film.

<doc id="495758" wikidata="Q2374224" url="?curid=495758" title="Culture of Costa Rica">
<text>Costa Rican culture has been heavily influenced by Spanish culture ever since the Spanish colonization of the Americas including the territory which today forms Costa Rica. Parts of the country have other strong cultural influences, including the Caribbean province of Limón and the Cordillera de Talamanca which are influenced by Jamaican immigrants and indigenous native people, respectively.

==Ethnic groups== 


 most Costa Ricans are of primarily Spanish or Spanish/Mixed ancestry with minorities of German, Italian, French, Dutch, British, Swedish and Greek ancestry. Whites, Castizo and Mestizo together comprise 83% of the population.

European migrants in Costa Rica to get across the isthmus of Central America as well to reach the USA West Coast (California) in the late 19th century and until the 1910s (before the Panama Canal opened). Other European ethnic groups known to live in Costa Rica include Russians, Danes, Belgians, Portuguese, Croats, Poles, Turks, Armenians and Georgians.

Many of the first Spanish colonists in Costa Rica may have been Jewish converts to Christianity who were expelled from Spain in 1492 and fled to colonial backwaters to avoid the Inquisition. The first sizable group of self-identified Jews immigrated from Poland, beginning in 1929. From the 1930s to the early 1950s, journalistic and official anti-Semitic campaigns fueled harassment of Jews; however, by the 1950s and 1960s, the immigrants won greater acceptance. Most of the 3,500 Costa Rican Jews today are not highly observant, but they remain largely endogamous.

Costa Rica has four small minority groups: Mulatto, Black, Amerindian and Asian people. About 8% of the population is of African descent or Mulatto (mix of European and black) who are called Afro-Costa Ricans, descendants of Sub-Saharan Africans enslaved by the Spanish, and descendants of 19th century English-speaking Jamaican immigrant workers.

In 1873, the Atlantic Railroad imported 653 Chinese indentured laborers, hoping to duplicate the success of rail projects that used Chinese labor in Peru, Cuba, and the United States. Asians represent less than 0.5% of the Costa Rican population, mostly from China, Taiwan and Japan.

There are also over 104,000 Native American or indigenous inhabitants, representing 2.4% of the population. Most of them live in secluded reservations, distributed among eight ethnic groups: Quitirrisí (in the Central Valley), Matambú or Chorotega (Guanacaste), Maleku (northern Alajuela), Bribri (southern Atlantic), Cabécar (Cordillera de Talamanca), Guaymí (southern Costa Rica, along the Panamá border), Boruca (southern Costarable portion of the Costa Rican population is made up of Nicaraguans. There is also a number of Colombian refugees. Moreover, Costa Rica accepted many refugees from various other Latin American countries fleeing civil wars and dictatorships during the 1970s and 1980s – notably from El Salvador, Chile, Argentina, Cuba and recently from Venezuela.

Currently immigrants represent 9% of the Costa Rican population, the largest in Central America and the Caribbean. By 2014 the three largest Immigrant Diasporas in Costa Rica are people from: Nicaragua, Colombia and United States.

==Language==
The official language of Costa Rica is Spanish. However, there are also many local indigenous languages in Costa Rica, such as Bribrí. English is the first foreign language and the second most taught language in Costa Rica, followed by French, German, Italian and Chinese. A creole language called Mekatelyu is also spoken in Limón.

=== Pura vida ===
&quot;Pura vida&quot;, a characteristic Costa Rican phrase, literally means &quot;pure life&quot;, with connotations that suggest translations such as &quot;full of life&quot;, &quot;this is living!&quot;, &quot;going great&quot;, or &quot;real living&quot;. The phrase can be used both as a greeting or a farewell, as an answer expressing that things are going well, as a way of giving thanks, or showing appreciation. In modern-day usage, the saying goes beyond its simple translation: it&#x27;s a way of life. It is a perspective on life that evokes a spirit that is carefree, laid back and optimistic.

According to Víctor Manuel Sánchez Corrales of the University of Costa Rica, the origin of the phrase is Mexican. It is thought to have come from a Mexican film called &quot;¡Pura vida!&quot; (1956). The protagonist, played by Antonio Espino, used the expression &quot;pura vida&quot; extensively in situations where it would not normally be used. Costa Ricans adopted the phrase, using it in a similar way. It was formally recognized and incorporated into dictionaries in the mid-1990s and has since become Costa Rica&#x27;s unofficial but ubiquitous motto.

== Religion ==

A 2007 survey conducted by the University of Costa Rica, found that 70.5% of the population identify themselves as Roman Catholics (with 44.9% practicing, 25.6 percent nonpracticing), 13.8% are Evangelical Protestants, 11.3% report that they do not have a religion, and 4.3% declare that they belong to another religion.

There are several other religious festivals in the country; Costa Rica has various religious denominations: Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, Baháʼí Faith, Scientology, Rastafari, Taoism and Jehovah&#x27;s Witness.

== Education ==

Education is highly cared about in Costa Rica by most of the population. About 6% of the country&#x27;s domestic product is dedicated to education, which has produced positive results as 96% of the population is literate.
Primary (1st-6th grade) and secondary (7th-11th or 12th) are mandatory for all citizens. Public schools are free, and those who can afford it may choose to send their children to private schools.

The country has five major public universities: the University of Costa Rica (UCR), the Costa Rica Institute of Technology (TEC), the Universidad Nacional (UNA), the Universidad Técnica Nacional, and the Universidad Estatal Distancia (UNED).

== Art ==
===Painting and sculpture===
At the beginning of the 19th century, some wealthy Costa Ricans paid visiting foreign painters, usually European, to paint their portraits. It was not until some of these painters, such as Bigot, Henry Etheridge, or Santiago Paramo settled in the country that Costa Rican artists learned modern techniques for drawing, oil painting, and sculpture. These teachers directly influenced Tico artists Jose Maria Figueroa, Faustino Montes de Oca, and Felipe Valentini.

Towards the end of the 19th century Costa Ricans produced artists with stronger national identities. A short list of these artists would include Ezequiel Jimenez, Wenceslao de la Guardia, and Enrique Echandi. Current renowned Costa Rican painters include Gonzalo Morales Sáurez, Rafa Fernandez, and Fernando Carballo, and sculptors such as Ibo Bonilla, Max Jimenez, Jorge Jimenez Deredia, Domingo Ramos, Mario Parra, Olger Villegas, Nestor Zeledon, and William Villanueva Bermudez.

===Music===

Most of the music and folklore comes from the north of the country, including the Nicoya Peninsula (Mayan culture) and the Atlantic coast (Afro-Caribbean culture). Costa Rican music is marked by a rhythm known as &quot;tambito&quot;, as well as a distinctive musical genre known as &quot;punto&quot;. Two examples are the &quot;punto guanacasteco&quot; from Guanacaste Province, and the &quot;sancarleño&quot; from San Carlos in Alajuela Province.

===Dance===
Dance remains an important cultural tradition in Costa Rica. Most Costa Ricans learn several traditional dances from a young age. The vast majority of Costa Rican traditional dances were born in the province of Guanacaste. National holidays are often celebrated by spirited displays of dancing in the streets.

Many consider the &quot;Punto guanacasteco&quot; to be the national dance, which showcases three different stages of courtship. Occasionally, all dancers will pause mid-dance so that one person can shout out a &quot;bomba&quot;. A &quot;bomba&quot; is a rhymed verse which can be memorized or improvised and is usually racy or witty.

===Writing===
Costa Rican literature has many women who have played a large role in every literary movement. Most notably, Carmen Lyra whose overall subject matter and perspective made her a revolutionary figure. Other well known authors include Jose Leon Sanchez, Aquileo J. Echeverría (&quot;Concherías&quot;), Manuel González Zeledón (&quot;La propia&quot;), Joaquin Gutierrez (&quot;Cocori, Puerto Limón, Manglar&quot;), Carlos Luis Fallas (&quot;Marcos Ramírez, Mamita Yunai&quot;), Carlos Salazar Herrera (&quot;Cuentos de angustias y paisajes&quot;), Isaac Felipe Azofeifa, Fabián Dobles, Jorge Debravo, Alberto Cañas Escalante, Andrés Meza Murillo, Yolanda Oreamuno and Eunice Odio.

== Cuisine ==
Costa Rican cuisine is a combination of Spanish, South American, Caribbean, and American influences. This style of cuisine is shared by most of Central America, although local variations have appeared in each of the countries.

One national dish is &quot;gallo pinto&quot; (&quot;spotted rooster&quot;), although the name has no relation to the ingredients. It is a combination of black beans and white rice, spiced with cilantro, onions, garlic, salt, and a local condiment called &quot;Salsa Lizano&quot;. It is typically eaten at breakfast with eggs, and sometimes &quot;natilla&quot; (sour cream). Fried plantains and either corn tortillas or bread are also common. &quot;Gallo pinto&quot; is a common and typical dish in both Costa Rica and Nicaragua.

Other typical dishes are &quot;arroz con pollo&quot;, &quot;olla de carne&quot;, &quot;tamales&quot;, and &quot;casado&quot;. &quot;Arroz con pollo&quot; (rice with chicken) consists of bite size chicken chunks mixed with rice and diced vegetables that include carrots, peas, corn, and garbanzo beans. &quot;Olla de carne&quot; is mainly prepared on weekends. It is a broth of corn prepared by boiling water, meat, and whole to large-sized vegetable pieces with spices. The soup is eaten in a bowl with the broth and separate plates for the vegetables and rice.

A &quot;casado&quot; is a one-plate meal that includes black beans, rice, meat, fried plantains, and one or more side dishes. The meat can vary from chicken, beef, or fish. Some examples of side dishes are pasta salad, vegetable salad, fried eggs, potatoes, spaghetti, or &quot;barbudos&quot; (green beans wrapped in egg batter).

There are some regional differences. For example, the Caribbean side of the country, because of its roots, has &quot;gallo pinto&quot; with coconut milk, while the north-western part of the country has a strong tendency towards corn products and for large, cheese filled tortillas, corn snacks, and other dishes.

<text>Powder metallurgy (PM) is a term covering a wide range of ways in which materials or components are made from metal powders. PM processes are sometimes used to reduce or eliminate the need for subtractive processes in manufacturing, lowering material losses and reducing the cost of the final product. This occurs especially often with small metal parts, like gears for small machines. Some porous products, allowing liquid or gas to permeate them, are produced in this way. They are also used when melting a material is impractical, due to it having a high melting point, or an alloy of two mutually insoluble materials, such as a mixture of copper and graphite. 

In this way, powder metallurgy can be used to make unique materials impossible to get from melting or forming in other ways. A very important product of this type is tungsten carbide. Tungsten carbide is used to cut and form other metals and is made from tungsten carbide particles bonded with cobalt. Tungsten carbide is the largest and most important use of tungsten, consuming about 50% of the world supply. Other products include sintered filters, porous oil-impregnated bearings, electrical contacts and diamond tools.

Powder metallurgy techniques usually consist of the compression of a powder, and heating (sintering) it at a temperature below the melting point of the metal, to bind the particles together. Powder for the processes can be produced in a number of ways, including reducing metal compounds, electrolyzing metal-containing solutions, and mechanical crushing, as well as more complicated methods, including a variety of ways to fragment liquid metal into droplets, and condensation from metal vapor. Compaction is usually done with a die press, but can also be done with explosive shocks or placing a flexible container in a high-pressure gas or liquid. Sintering is usually done in a dedicated furnace, but can also be done in tandem with compression (hot isostatic compression), or with the use of electric currents.

Since the advent of industrial production-scale metal powder-based additive manufacturing in the 2010s, selective laser sintering and other metal additive manufacturing processes are a new category of commercially important powder metallurgy applications.

== Overview ==
The powder metallurgy &quot;press and sinter&quot; process generally consists of three basic steps: powder blending (or pulverisation), die compaction, and sintering. Compaction of the powder in the die is generally performed at room temperature. Sintering is the process of binding a material together with heat without liquefying it. It is usually conducted at atmospheric pressure and under carefully controlled atmosphere composition. To obtain special properties or enhanced precision, secondary processing like coining or heat treatment often follows.

One of the older such methods is the process of blending fine (&lt;180 microns) metal powders with additives, pressing them into a die of the desired shape, and then sintering the compressed material together, under a controlled atmosphere. The metal powder is usually iron, and additives include a lubricant wax, carbon, copper, and/or nickel. This produces precise parts, normally very close to the die dimensions, but with 5–15% porosity, and thus sub-wrought steel properties. This method is still used to make around 1 Mt/y of structural components of iron-based alloys. 

There are several other PM processes that have been developed over the last fifty years. These include:
* Powder forging: A &quot;preform&quot; made by the conventional &quot;press and sinter&quot; method is heated and then hot forged to full density, resulting in practically as-wrought properties.
* Hot isostatic pressing (HIP): Here the powder, normally gas atomized and spherical, is filled into a mould, usually a metallic &quot;can&quot;. The can is vibrated, then evacuated and sealed. To sinter the powder, it is placed in a hot &quot;isostatic press&quot; for several hours, where it is heated to around 0.7 times the melting point, and subjected to an external gas pressure of ~100 MPa. This results in a shaped part of full density with as-wrought or better properties. HIP was invented in the 1950-60s and entered tonnage production in the 1970-80s. In 2015, it was used to produce ~25,000 t/y of stainless and tool steels, as well as important parts of superalloys for jet engines.
* Metal injection moulding (MIM): Here the powder, normally very fine (&lt;25 microns) and spherical, is mixed with plastic or wax binder to near the maximum solid loading, typically around 65% volume, and injection moulded into a mould to form a &quot;green&quot; (with binder) part of complex geometry. This part is then heated or otherwise treated to remove the binder to give a &quot;brown&quot; (without binder) part. This part is then sintered and shrinks by ~18% to give a complex and 95–99% dense finished part (surface roughness ~3 microns). Invented in the 1970s, production has increased since 2000 with an estimated global volume in 2014 of 12,000 t worth €1265 million.
* Electric current assisted sintering (ECAS) technologies use electric currents to sinter powders. This reduces production time dramatically (it can take from 15 minutes to a few microseconds), does not require a long furnace heat, and allows near-theoretical densities, but it also has the drawback of simple shapes. Powders used in ECAS do not require binders because they can be directly sintered, without needing to be pre-pressed and compacted with binders. Moulds are designed for the final part shape since the powders sinter while filling the cavity under applied pressure. This avoids the problem of shape variations caused by non-isotropic sintering, as well as distortions caused by gravity at high temperatures. The most common of these technologies is hot pressing, which has been used to make diamond tools for the construction industry. As of 2018, only hot pressing and, in a more limited way, spark plasma sintering had achieved direct industrial application.
* Additive manufacturing (AM) is a relatively novel family of techniques that use metal powders (among other materials, such as plastics) to make parts by laser sintering or melting. The process was undergoing rapid growth , and as of 2018 has been used predominantly for research, prototyping or advanced applications in the aerospace industry, though also in the biomedical, defence and automotive industries. It has been used in the aerospace industry because traditional processes are more time-consuming, difficult, and costly. Processes include 3D printing, selective laser sintering (SLS), selective laser melting (SLM), and electron beam melting (EBM).

==History and capabilities==

The history of powder metallurgy and the art of metal and ceramic sintering are intimately related to each other. Sintering involves the production of a hard solid metal or ceramic piece from a starting powder. The ancient Incas made jewelry and other artifacts from precious metal powders, though mass manufacturing of PM products did not begin until the mid or late 19th century. In these early manufacturing operations, iron was extracted by hand from a metal sponge following reduction and was then reintroduced as a powder for final melting or sintering.

A much wider range of products can be obtained from powder processes than from direct alloying of fused materials. In melting operations, the &quot;phase rule&quot; applies to all pure and combined elements and strictly dictates the distribution of liquid and solid phases which can exist for specific compositions. In addition, whole body melting of starting materials is required for alloying, thus imposing unwelcome chemical, thermal, and containment constraints on manufacturing. Unfortunately, the handling of aluminium/iron powders poses major problems. Other substances that are especially reactive with atmospheric oxygen, such as tin, are sinterable in special atmospheres or with temporary coatings.

In powder metallurgy or ceramics it is possible to fabricate components which otherwise would decompose or disintegrate. All considerations of solid-liquid phase changes can be ignored, so powder processes are more flexible than casting, extrusion, or forging techniques. Controllable characteristics of products prepared using various powder technologies include mechanical, magnetic, and other unconventional properties of such materials as porous solids, aggregates, and intermetallic compounds. Competitive characteristics of manufacturing processing (e.g. tool wear, complexity, or vendor options) also may be closely controlled.

=== Special products ===
Many special products are possible with powder metallurgy technology. A non-exhaustive list includes Al2O3 whiskers coated with very thin oxide layers for improved refraction; iron compacts with Al2O3 coatings for improved high-temperature creep strength; light bulb filaments made with powder technology; linings for friction brakes; metal glasses for high-strength films and ribbons; heat shields for spacecraft reentry into Earth&#x27;s atmosphere; electrical contacts for handling large current flows; magnets; microwave ferrites; filters for gases; and bearings which can be infiltrated with lubricants.

Extremely thin films and tiny spheres exhibit high strength. One application of this observation is to coat brittle materials in whisker form with a submicrometre film of much softer metal (e.g. cobalt-coated tungsten). The surface strain of the thin layer places the harder metal under compression, so that when the entire composite is sintered the rupture strength increases markedly. With this method, strengths on the order of 2.8 GPa versus 550 MPa have been observed for, respectively, coated (25% cobalt) and uncoated tungsten carbides.

==Powder production==

Any fusible material can be atomized. Several techniques have been developed that permit large production rates of powdered particles, often with considerable control over the size ranges of the final grain population. Powders may be prepared by crushing, grinding, chemical reactions, or electrolytic deposition. The most commonly used powders are copper-base and iron-base materials. 

Powders of the elements titanium, vanadium, thorium, niobium, tantalum, calcium, and uranium have been produced by high-temperature reduction of the corresponding nitrides and carbides. Iron, nickel, uranium, and beryllium submicrometre powders are obtained by reducing metallic oxalates and formates. Exceedingly fine particles also have been prepared by directing a stream of molten metal through a high-temperature plasma jet or flame, atomizing the material. Various chemical and flame-associated powdering processes are adopted in part to prevent serious degradation of particle surfaces by atmospheric oxygen.

Powder can be obtained through gas or water atomization, centrifugal atomization, chemically reducing particulate compounds, electrolytic deposition in appropriate conditions, simple pulverization and grinding, thermal decomposition of particulate hydrides or carbonyls, precipitation out of solution, and also condensation from vaporized metal.

=== Gas atomization ===

Atomization is accomplished by forcing a molten metal stream through an orifice at moderate pressures. A gas is introduced into the metal stream just before it leaves the nozzle, serving to create turbulence as the entrained gas expands (due to heating) and exits into a large collection volume exterior to the orifice. The collection volume is filled with gas to promote further turbulence of the molten metal jet. Air and powder streams are segregated using gravity or cyclonic separation.

Simple atomization techniques are available in which liquid metal is forced through an orifice at a sufficiently high velocity to ensure turbulent flow. The usual performance index used is the Reynolds number. At low Re the liquid jet oscillates, but at higher velocities the stream becomes turbulent and breaks into droplets. Pumping energy is applied to droplet formation with very low efficiency (on the order of ) and control over the size distribution of the metal particles produced is rather poor. Other techniques such as nozzle vibration, nozzle asymmetry, multiple impinging streams, or molten-metal injection into ambient gas are all available to increase atomization efficiency, produce finer grains, and to narrow the particle size distribution. Unfortunately, it is difficult to eject metals through orifices smaller than a few millimeters in diameter, which in practice limits the minimum size of powder grains to approximately . Atomization also produces a wide spectrum of particle sizes, necessitating downstream classification by screening and remelting a significant fraction of the grain boundary.

=== Centrifugal techniques ===

Centrifugal disintegration of molten particles offers one way around these problems. Extensive experience is available with iron, steel, and aluminium. Metal to be powdered is formed into a rod which is introduced into a chamber through a rapidly rotating spindle. Opposite the spindle tip is an electrode from which an arc is established which heats the metal rod. As the tip material fuses, the rapid rod rotation throws off tiny melt droplets which solidify before hitting the chamber walls. A circulating gas sweeps particles from the chamber. Similar techniques could be employed in space or on the Moon. The chamber wall could be rotated to force new powders into remote collection vessels, and the electrode could be replaced by a solar mirror focused at the end of the rod.

An alternative approach capable of producing a very narrow distribution of grain sizes but with low throughput consists of a rapidly spinning bowl heated to well above the melting point of the material to be powdered. Liquid metal, introduced onto the surface of the basin near the center at flow rates adjusted to permit a thin metal film to skim evenly up the walls and over the edge, breaks into droplets, each approximately the thickness of the film.

===Water atomization===

Another powder-production technique involves a thin jet of liquid metal intersected by high-speed streams of atomized water which break the jet into drops and cool the powder before it reaches the bottom of the bin. In subsequent operations the powder is dried. This is called water atomization. Water atomization cools and solidifies the metal particles more rapidly than gas atomization. Since the solidification rate is inversely proportional to the particle size, smaller particles can be made using water atomization. The smaller the particles, the more homogeneous the microstructure will be. Particles produced this way will also have a more irregular shape and the particle size distribution will be wider. In addition, some surface contamination can occur by oxidation skin formation. Powder can be reduced by some kind of pre-consolidation treatment, such as annealing used for the manufacture of ceramic tools.

==Powder compaction==

Powder compaction, one of the most critical steps in powder metallurgy processes, is the process of compacting metal powder through the application of high pressures. Most powder compaction is done with mechanical presses and rigid tools, but hydraulic and pneumatic techniques can also be used, as well as methods that combine compaction with sintering, like hot isostatic compaction. Traditional metalforming processes, including rolling, forging, extrusion, and swaging, are also used. 

The density of the compacted powder increases with the amount of pressure applied. Typical pressures range from 80 psi to 1000 psi (0.5 MPa to 7 MPa), pressures from 1000 psi to 1,000,000 psi have been obtained. Pressure of 10 t/in2 to 50 t/in2 (150 MPa to 700 MPa) are commonly used for metal powder compaction. To attain the same compression ratio across a component with more than one level or height, it is necessary to work with multiple lower punches. A cylindrical workpiece is made by single-level tooling. A more complex shape can be made by the common multiple-level tooling.

===Die pressing===

The dominant technology for the forming of products from powder materials, in terms of both tonnage quantities and numbers of parts produced, is die pressing. There are mechanical, servo-electrical and hydraulic presses available in the market, whereby the biggest powder throughput is processed by hydraulic presses. This forming technology involves the production cycle below, which offers a readily automated and high production rate process:

# Filling a die cavity with a known volume of the powder feedstock, delivered from a fill shoe.
# Compaction of the powder within the die with punches to form the compact. Generally, compaction pressure is applied through punches from both ends of the toolset in order to reduce the level of density gradient within the compact.
# Ejection of the compact from the die, using the lower punch(es) withdrawal from the die.
# Removal of the compact from the upper face of the die using the fill shoe in the fill stage of the next cycle, or an automation system or robot.

Typically the tools are held in the vertical orientation with the punch tool forming the bottom of the cavity. Probably the most basic consideration is being able to remove the part from the die after it is pressed, along with avoiding sharp corners in the design. Keeping the maximum surface area below and the height-to-diameter ratio below 7-to-1 is recommended. Along with having walls thicker than and keeping the adjacent wall thickness ratios below 2.5-to-1.

One of the major advantages of this process is its ability to produce complex geometries. Parts with undercuts and threads require a secondary machining operation. Typical part sizes range from to . in area and from in length. However, it is possible to produce parts that are less than and larger than . in area and from a fraction of an inch (2.54 cm) to approximately in length. Small mechanical presses can generally compact about 100 pieces per minute.

In die compaction, there are four major classes of tool styles: single-action compaction, used for thin, flat components; opposed double-action with two punch motions, which accommodates thicker components; double-action with floating die; and double-action withdrawal die. Double action classes give much better density distribution than single action. Tooling must be designed so that it will withstand the extreme pressure without deforming or bending. Tools must be made from materials that are polished and wear-resistant.

=== Shock consolidation ===
Shock consolidation, or dynamic consolidation, is an experimental technique of consolidating powders using high pressure shock waves. This technique is useful for very large products, including those over 3000 tons and larger than 100 square inches. These are commonly produced by impacting the workpiece with an explosively accelerated plate. Despite being researched for a long time, the technique still has some problems in controllability and uniformity. However, it offers some valuable potential advantages. As an example, consolidation occurs so rapidly that metastable microstructures may be retained.

=== Cold isostatic compaction ===
Isostatic powder compacting is an alternate method of powder compaction. In cold isostatic compaction, fine metal particles are placed into a flexible mould, which is then immersed in a high-pressure gas or liquid from all directions (isostatic). After sintering, this manufacturing process produces very little scrap metal and can be used to make many different shapes. The tolerances that this process can achieve in combination with sintering are very precise, ranging from +/- 0.008 inches (0.2 mm) for axial dimensions and +/- 0.020 inches (0.5 mm) for radial dimensions. This is the most efficient type of powder compacting (the following subcategories are also from this reference). This operation is generally only applicable on small production quantities, and although the cost of a mold is much lower than that of pressing dies, it is generally not reusable and the production time is much longer. Production rates are usually very low, but parts weighing up to 100 pounds can be effectively compacted. Because pressure is applied from all directions, lower compaction pressures are required to produce higher densities of powder in the end product.

Compacting pressures range from to for most metals and approximately to for non-metals. The density of isostatic compacted parts is 5% to 10% higher than with other powder metallurgy processes. Typical workpiece sizes range from to thick and to long. It is possible to compact workpieces that are between and thick and to long.

Advantages over standard powder compaction are the possibility of thinner walls and larger workpieces. The height-to-diameter ratio has no limitation. No specific limitations exist in wall thickness variations, undercuts, reliefs, threads, and cross holes. No lubricants are needed for isostatic powder compaction. The minimum wall thickness is 0.05 inches (1.27 mm) and the product can have a weight between 40 and 300 pounds (18 and 136 kg). There is 25 to 45% shrinkage of the powder after compacting.

Isostatic tools are available in three styles, free mold (wet-bag), coarse mold (damp-bag), and fixed mold (dry-bag). The free mold style is the traditional style of isostatic compaction and is not generally used for high production work. In free mold tooling the mold is removed and filled outside the canister. Damp bag is where the mold is located in the canister, yet filled outside. In fixed mold tooling, the mold is contained within the canister, which facilitates automation of the process.

==Sintering==

After compaction, powdered materials are heated in a controlled atmosphere in a process known as sintering. During this process, the surfaces of the particles are bonded and desirable properties are achieved.

Sintering of powder metals is a process in which particles under pressure chemically bond to themselves in order to form a coherent shape when exposed to a high temperature. The temperature in which the particles are sintered is most commonly below the melting point of the main component in the powder. If the temperature is above the melting point of a component in the powder metal part, the liquid of the melted particles fills the pores. This type of sintering is known as liquid-state sintering. A major challenge with sintering in general is knowing the effect of the process on the dimensions of the compact particles. This is especially difficult for tooling purposes in which specific dimensions may be needed. It is most common for the sintered part to shrink and become denser, but it can also expand or experience no net change.

The main driving force for solid-state sintering is an excess of surface-free energy. The process of solid-state sintering is complex and dependent on the material and furnace (temperature and gas) conditions. There are six main stages that sintering processes can be grouped in which may overlap with one another: 1 initial bonding among particles, 2) neck growth, 3) pore channel closure, 4) pore rounding, 5) densification or pore shrinkage, and 6) pore coarsening. The main mechanisms present in these stages are evaporation, condensation, grain boundaries, volume diffusion, and plastic deformation.

During this process, a number of characteristics are increased including the strength, ductility, toughness, and electrical and thermal conductivity of the material. If different elemental powders are compact and sintered, the material would form into alloys and intermetallic phases. As the pore sizes decrease, the density of the material will increase. As stated above, this shrinkage is a huge problem in making parts or tooling in which particular dimensions are required. The shrinkage of test materials is monitored and used to manipulate the furnace conditions or to oversize the compact materials in order to achieve the desired dimensions. Although, sintering does not deplete the compact part of porosity. In general, powder metal parts contain five to twenty-five percent porosity after sintering.

=== General sintering furnace ===

Most sintering furnaces contain three zones with three different properties that help to carry out the six steps above. The first zone, commonly coined the burn-off or purge stage, is designed to combust air, burn any contaminants such as lubricant or binders, and slowly raise the temperature of the compact materials. If the temperature of the compact parts is raised too quickly, the air in the pores will be at a very high internal pressure which could lead to expansion or fracture of the part. The second zone, known as the high-temperature stage, is used to produce solid-state diffusion and particle bonding. The material is seeking to lower its surface energy and does so by moving toward the points of contact between particles. The contact points become larger and eventually a solid mass with small pores is created. The third zone, also called the cooling period, is used to cool down the parts while still in a controlled atmosphere. This is an important zone as it prevents oxidation from immediate contact with the air or a phenomenon known as rapid cooling. All of the three stages must be carried out in a controlled atmosphere containing no oxygen. Hydrogen, nitrogen, dissociated ammonia, and cracked hydrocarbons are common gases pumped into the furnace zones providing a reducing atmosphere, preventing oxide formation.

=== Hot isostatic pressing ===
Hot isostatic pressing (HIP) compresses and sinters the part simultaneously by applying heat on the order of 2300 °F (1250 °C), in the case of iron, or 2750 °F (1500 °C) in the case of nickel alloys. This procedure, together with explosion-driven compressive techniques is used extensively in the production of high-temperature and high-strength parts such as turbine disks for jet engines. In most applications of powder metallurgy the compact is hot-pressed, heated to a temperature above which the materials cannot remain work-hardened. Hot pressing lowers the pressures required to reduce porosity and speeds welding and grain deformation processes. It also permits better dimensional control of the product, lessens sensitivity to physical characteristics of starting materials, and allows powder to be compressed to higher densities than with cold pressing, resulting in higher strength. Negative aspects of hot pressing include shorter die life, slower throughput because of powder heating, and the frequent necessity for protective atmospheres or simple vacuum during forming and cooling stages.

HIP produces products often of higher quality than other processes. However, HIP is expensive, and generally unnattractive for high-volume production, due to the high cost of placing the powder in a flexible isolating medium that can withstand the temperatures and pressures (&quot;canning&quot;) and then removing it from that medium (&quot;decanning&quot;), as well as the long time periods involve, which can range from 6 to 8 hours.

=== Electric current assisted sintering ===

These techniques employ electric currents to drive or enhance sintering. A combination of mechanical pressure and electrical current, passed through either the powder or the container, significantly reduces the sintering time compared to conventional solutions. There are many classifications of these techniques, but they can be divided into two main categories: resistance sintering techniques, which apply lower voltages and currents and take on the from around ten seconds to ten minutes; and electric discharge sintering, which use capacitor banks to achieve higher currents and voltages, and take from tens of microseconds to tens of milliseconds. Resistance sintering techniques include spark plasma sintering (SPS), plasma-activated sintering (PAS), and pulse electric current sintering (PECS). electric discharge sintering techniques include capacitor discharge sintering. Currently, spark plasma sintering is currently the most commonly used method of electric pulse consolidation in general.

Resistance sintering currents usually reach about 1 kA per square centimer, while electric discharge sintering voltages of up to several kilovolts also require very high currents, over 10 kA per square centimer. Resistance sintering techniques are consolidation methods based on temperature, where heating of the mold and of the powders is accomplished through electric currents, usually with a characteristic processing time of 15 to 30 minutes. On the other hand, electric discharge sintering methods rely on high-density currents (from 0.1 to 1 kA/mm^2) to directly sinter electrically conductive powders, with a characteristic time between tens of microseconds to hundreds of milliseconds.

== Continuous powder processing ==
Strictly, the phrase &quot;continuous process&quot; should be used only to describe modes of manufacturing which could be extended indefinitely in time. Normally, however, the term refers to processes whose products are much longer in one physical dimension than in the other two. Compression, rolling, and extrusion are the most common examples.

=== Compression ===

In a simple compression process, powder flows from a bin onto a two-walled channel and is repeatedly compressed vertically by a horizontally stationary punch. After stripping the compress from the conveyor, the compacted mass is introduced into a sintering furnace. An even easier approach is to spray powder onto a moving belt and sinter it without compression. However, good methods for stripping cold-pressed materials from moving belts are hard to find. One alternative that avoids the belt-stripping difficulty altogether is the manufacture of metal sheets using opposed hydraulic rams, although weakness lines across the sheet may arise during successive press operations.

=== Rolling ===

Powders can also be rolled to produce sheets. The powdered metal is fed into a two-high rolling mill, and is compacted into strip form at up to . The strip is then sintered and subjected to another rolling and further sintering. Rolling is commonly used to produce sheet metal for electrical and electronic components, as well as coins. Considerable work also has been done on rolling multiple layers of different materials simultaneously into sheets.

=== Extrusion ===
Extrusion processes are of two general types. In one type, the powder is mixed with a binder or plasticizer at room temperature; in the other, the powder is extruded at elevated temperatures without fortification. Extrusions with binders are used extensively in the preparation of tungsten-carbide composites. Tubes, complex sections, and spiral drill shapes are manufactured in extended lengths and diameters varying in the range . Hard metal wires of diameter have been drawn from powder stock. At the opposite extreme, large extrusions on a tonnage basis may be feasible.

For softer, easier-to-form metals such as aluminium and copper alloys continuous extrusion may also be performed using processes such as conform or continuous rotary extrusion. These processes use a rotating wheel with a groove around its circumference to drive the loose powder through a forming die. Through a combination of high pressure and a complex strain path the powder particles deform, generate a large amount of frictional heat and bond together to form a bulk solid. Theoretically, fully continuous operation is possible as long as the powder can be fed into the process.

There appears to be no limitation to the variety of metals and alloys that can be extruded, provided the temperatures and pressures involved are within the capabilities of die materials. Extrusion lengths may range from 3 to 30 m and diameters from 0.2 to 1 m. Modern presses are largely automatic and operate at high speeds (on the order of m/s).

==Hazards==

The special materials and processes used in powder metallurgy can pose hazards to life and property. The high surface-area-to-volume ratio of the powders can increase their chemical reactivity in biological exposures (for example, inhalation or ingestion), and increases the risk of dust explosions. Materials considered relatively benign in bulk can pose special toxicological risks when in a finely divided form. Inhalation of heavy metals can result in many health issues. Lead and cadmium are generally toxic, and cobalt can cause asthma and fibrosis in sensitive individuals.

<doc id="495775" wikidata="Q422523" url="?curid=495775" title="Ribonuclease">
<text>Ribonuclease (commonly abbreviated RNase) is a type of nuclease that catalyzes the degradation of RNA into smaller components. Ribonucleases can be divided into endoribonucleases and exoribonucleases, and comprise several sub-classes within the EC 2.7 (for the phosphorolytic enzymes) and 3.1 (for the hydrolytic enzymes) classes of enzymes.

== Function ==
All organisms studied contain many RNases of two different classes, showing that RNA degradation is a very ancient and important process. As well as clearing of cellular RNA that is no longer required, RNases play key roles in the maturation of all RNA molecules, both messenger RNAs that carry genetic material for making proteins and non-coding RNAs that function in varied cellular processes. In addition, active RNA degradation systems are the first defense against RNA viruses and provide the underlying machinery for more advanced cellular immune strategies such as RNAi.

Some cells also secrete copious quantities of non-specific RNases such as A and T1. RNases are, therefore, extremely common, resulting in very short lifespans for any RNA that is not in a protected environment. All intracellular RNAs are protected from RNase activity by a number of strategies including 5&#x27; end capping, 3&#x27; end polyadenylation, formation of an RNA·RNA duplex, and folding within an RNA protein complex (ribonucleoprotein particle or RNP).

Another mechanism of protection is ribonuclease inhibitor (RI), which comprises a relatively large fraction of cellular protein (~0.1%) in some cell types, and which binds to certain ribonucleases with the highest affinity of any protein-protein interaction; the dissociation constant for the RI-RNase A complex is ~20 fM under physiological conditions. RI is used in most laboratories that study RNA to protect their samples against degradation from environmental RNases.

Similar to restriction enzymes, which cleave highly specific sequences of double-stranded DNA, a variety of endoribonucleases that recognize and cleave specific sequences of single-stranded RNA have been recently classified.

RNases play a critical role in many biological processes, including angiogenesis and self-incompatibility in flowering plants (angiosperms). Many stress-response toxins of prokaryotic toxin-antitoxin systems have been shown to have RNase activity and homology.

==Classification==

===Major types of endoribonucleases===

* : RNase A is an RNase that is commonly used in research. RNase A (&quot;e.g.&quot;, bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A: ) is one of the hardiest enzymes in common laboratory usage; one method of isolating it is to boil a crude cellular extract until all enzymes other than RNase A are denatured. It is specific for single-stranded RNAs. It cleaves the 3&#x27;-end of unpaired C and U residues, ultimately forming a 3&#x27;-phosphorylated product via a 2&#x27;,3&#x27;-cyclic monophosphate intermediate. It does not require any cofactors for its activity 
* : RNase H is a ribonuclease that cleaves the RNA in a DNA/RNA duplex to produce ssDNA. RNase H is a non-specific endonuclease and catalyzes the cleavage of RNA via a hydrolytic mechanism, aided by an enzyme-bound divalent metal ion. RNase H leaves a 5&#x27;-phosphorylated product.
* : RNase III is a type of ribonuclease that cleaves rRNA (16s rRNA and 23s rRNA) from transcribed polycistronic RNA operon in prokaryotes. It also digests double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-Dicer family of RNAse, cutting pre-miRNA (60–70bp long) at a specific site and transforming it in miRNA (22–30bp), that is actively involved in the regulation of transcription and mRNA life-time.
* EC number 3.1.26.-??: RNase L is an interferon-induced nuclease that, upon activation, destroys all RNA within the cell
* : RNase P is a type of ribonuclease that is unique in that it is a ribozyme – a ribonucleic acid that acts as a catalyst in the same way as an enzyme. One of its functions is to cleave off a leader sequence from the 5&#x27; end of one stranded pre-tRNA. RNase P is one of two known multiple turnover ribozymes in nature (the other being the ribosome). In bacteria RNase P is also responsible for the catalytic activity of holoenzymes, which consist of an apoenzyme that forms an active enzyme system by combination with a coenzyme and determines the specificity of this system for a substrate. A form of RNase P that is a protein and does not contain RNA has recently been discovered.
* EC number 3.1.??: RNase PhyM is sequence specific for single-stranded RNAs. It cleaves 3&#x27;-end of unpaired A and U residues.
* : RNase T1 is sequence specific for single-stranded RNAs. It cleaves 3&#x27;-end of unpaired G residues.
* : RNase T2 is sequence specific for single-stranded RNAs. It cleaves 3&#x27;-end of all 4 residues, but preferentially 3&#x27;-end of As.
* : RNase U2 is sequence specific for single-stranded RNAs. It cleaves 3&#x27;-end of unpaired A residues.
* : RNase V is specific for polyadenine and polyuridine RNA.
* : RNase E is a ribonuclease of plant origin, which modulates SOS responses in bacteria, for a response to the stress of DNA damage by activation of the SOS mechanism by the RecA/LexA dependent signal transduction pathway that transcriptionally depresses a multiplicity of genes leading to transit arrest of cell division as well as initiation of DNA repair. 
* : RNase G It is involved in processing the 16&#x27;-end of the 5s rRNA. It is related to chromosome separation and cell division. It is considered one of the components of cytoplasmic axial filament bundles. It is also thought that it can regulate the formation of this structure.

===Major types of exoribonucleases===
* EC number : Polynucleotide Phosphorylase (PNPase) functions as an exonuclease as well as a nucleotidyltransferase.
* EC number : RNase PH functions as an exonuclease as well as a nucleotidyltransferase.
* EC number 3.1.??: RNase R is a close homolog of RNase II, but it can, unlike RNase II, degrade RNA with secondary structures without help of accessory factors.
* EC number : RNase D is involved in the 3&#x27;-to-5&#x27; processing of pre-tRNAs.
* EC number 3.1.??: RNase T is the major contributor for the 3&#x27;-to-5&#x27; maturation of many stable RNAs.
* : Oligoribonuclease degrades short oligonucleotides to mononucleotides.
* : Exoribonuclease I degrades single-stranded RNA from 5&#x27;-to-3&#x27;, exists only in eukaryotes.
* : Exoribonuclease II is a close homolog of Exoribonuclease I.

==RNase specificity==
The active site looks like a rift valley where all the active site residues create the wall and bottom of the valley. The rift is very thin and the small substrate fits perfectly in the middle of the active site, which allows for perfect interaction with the residues. It actually has a little curvature to the site which the substrate also has. Although usually most exo- and endoribonucleases are not sequence specific, recently CRISPR/Cas system natively recognizing and cutting DNA was engineered to cleave ssRNA in a sequence-specific manner.

==RNase contamination during RNA extraction==
The extraction of RNA in molecular biology experiments is greatly complicated by the presence of ubiquitous and hardy ribonucleases that degrade RNA samples. Certain RNases can be extremely hardy and inactivating them is difficult compared to neutralizing DNases. In addition to the cellular RNases that are released, there are several RNases that are present in the environment. RNases have evolved to have many extracellular functions in various organisms. For example, RNase 7, a member of the RNase A superfamily, is secreted by human skin and serves as a potent antipathogen defence. In these secreted RNases, the enzymatic RNase activity may not even be necessary for its new, exapted function. For example, immune RNases act by destabilizing the cell membranes of bacteria.

<text>Fernando Ferreira Meirelles (; born 9 November 1955) is a Brazilian film director, producer, and screenwriter. He is best known for co-directing the film &quot;City of God&quot;, released in 2002 in Brazil and in 2003 in the U.S. by Miramax Films, which received international critical acclaim. For his work in the film, he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Director. He was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Director in 2005 for &quot;The Constant Gardener&quot;, which garnered the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for Rachel Weisz. He also directed the 2008 adaptation of José Saramago&#x27;s novel &quot;Blindness&quot;, and the 2011 film &quot;360&quot;. In 2019, Meirelles directed &quot;The Two Popes&quot; for Netflix.

In television, Meirelles directed and produced in Brazil the HBO original series &quot;Joint Venture&quot;. In 2024, he led directing work for the crime series &quot;Sugar&quot; and the historical miniseries &quot;The Sympathizer&quot;.

== Early life ==
Meirelles was born in São Paulo, Brazil. Meirelles&#x27; father, José de Souza Meirelles, is a gastroenterologist who travelled regularly to Asia and North America (among other regions of the world), which gave Fernando the opportunity for contact with different cultures and places. His mother, Sônia Junqueira Ferreira, worked in landscape architecture and interior design.

Fernando is the second youngest of four children. He saw his older brother, José Marcos, die in a car-bike accident when he was 4 years old. His two sisters, Márcia and Silvinha, graduated in theater and psychology, respectively. Fernando grew up in Alto dos Pinheiros, West Zone of São Paulo, and spent every vacation on the farms of relatives from both sides of his family. &quot;Even I have a farm. I don&#x27;t know why I bought it&quot;, he was quoted as saying.

His first experience with cinema was with his father, who often directed 8 mm films during his job at the university. He produced mostly western and thriller parodies, using his relatives and friends as actors. At 11, in 1967, Fernando spent a year in the United States in California, where he had contact with the hippie movement, which impressed him. At 13, with a borrowed Super 8 camera, Meirelles started producing small films, inspired by Norman McLaren&#x27;s animations.

== Career ==
He studied at the Architecture and Urbanism College in the University of São Paulo during the 1980s. His graduation work was done in the form of a film, instead of the traditional designs of the other students: he went to Japan and bought professional video equipment to do the job. He presented it and graduated with the minimum acceptable grade.

While studying architecture at the University of queens mary, Meirelles became involved in experimental film-making. After several years in independent television, he became an advertisement film director. He is still one of the partners of O2 Filmes, the biggest Brazilian advertisement firm, which has produced &quot;City of God&quot;, &quot;Domésticas&quot; and &quot;Viva Voz&quot;.

Along with four friends (Paul Morelli, Marcelo Machado, Dário Vizeu and Bob Salatini), Meirelles began his career with experimental films. Eventually, they formed an independent production company &quot;Olhar Eletrônico&quot;. Subsequently, new friends joined the group: Renato Barbiere, Agilson Araujo, Toniko and Marcelo Tas. In 1982, the company aired TV programs on current affairs, as well as the children series &quot;Castelo Rá-Tim-Bum&quot;, with 180 episodes. In addition to obtaining high ratings, they also introduced a refreshing humorous informality in news reporting.

By the end of the 1980s, he became increasingly interested on the advertising market. In 1990, Meirelles and friends closed down &quot;Olhar Eletrônico&quot;, opening an advertising business, O2 Films. One decade was enough for him to become one of the most important and sought-after advertising producers.

In 1997, Meirelles read the book Paulo Lins&#x27;s &quot;City of God&quot;. He decided to adapt it to film, which was done in 2002, and decided that the actors in it would be selected among the inhabitants of slums. In a final triage, from 400 children, they selected 200, with whom they worked for the shooting of the film. The filming was done with a professional crew. The film was a national and international success.

In 2004, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director for &quot;City of God&quot;. Also, at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival, the movie received four nominations: Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, and Best Film Editing.

With the recognition, he was offered a job in Hollywood. With &quot;The Constant Gardener&quot;, he again received critical acclaim, receiving several nominations, including for four Academy Awards and the Golden Globe Award for Best Director. Rachel Weisz went on to win the Academy Award and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress. Meirelles insisted that the soundtrack be based on the music of African countries, and most of the filming was done in Kenya.

In 2007, he began shooting &quot;Blindness&quot;, a film adaptation of Nobel-prize winner José Saramago&#x27;s book, &quot;Ensaio Sobre a Cegueira&quot;. The film, which was released in 2008, was the opening film of the Cannes Film Festival.

He was one of the creative directors of the opening ceremony of the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, working alongside Daniela Thomas and Andrucha Waddington 
on a shoestring budget equivalent to less than £5 million.

In 2019, Meirelles directed and produced the HBO original series &quot;Joint Venture&quot;, in which marijuana has been legalized in Brazil. The series follows the story of a young drug trafficker from São Paulo who, after the legalization of marijuana in Brazil, decides to abandon his life on crime and sell his weed legally along with an inexperienced investor partner. In the same year, he directed the drama film &quot;The Two Popes&quot; for Netflix, starring Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Pryce.

==Personal life==
Meirelles is a Catholic.

<doc id="495787" wikidata="Q3613155" url="?curid=495787" title="Alter Ego (1986 video game)">
<text>Alter Ego is a role-playing video game developed and published by Activision in 1986. It was created by Peter J. Favaro for the Commodore 64, MS-DOS, Apple II, and Macintosh. The game allows the user to make decisions for an imaginary person (being therefore the player&#x27;s alter ego) and shows what possible consequences these decisions could have on that person. &quot;Alter Ego&quot; was released in both male and female versions, each using a different set of experiences.

==Gameplay==

The player&#x27;s alter ego begins the game as an infant; the game presents the user with a tree diagram with nodes, each labeled with an icon. The player chooses an icon representing an &quot;experience&quot; or situation to explore. Each icon bears a symbol showing what kind of experience it represents (for example, a heart denotes an emotional event). After making a choice in each node, the user is moved back to the tree with that node marked as completed. In this manner, the user progresses through the alter ego&#x27;s entire life and examines what impact their decisions had. In the process of playing the game, the player&#x27;s alter ego proceeds through seven phases with their respective experiences: infancy, childhood, adolescence, young adulthood, adulthood, middle adulthood, and old age. Some of these experiences are disturbing, and can even lead to premature death (such as being raped and killed by a child molester), though most tend to be humorous.

&quot;Alter Ego&quot; keeps track of certain player statistics throughout the game, which in turn affect the alter ego&#x27;s ability to succeed at certain choices. For example, in the high school segment, the player might be given the choice of trying out for the school baseball team, or deciding instead to crack down and study harder to improve in math. This decision might change the alter ego&#x27;s &quot;Physical&quot;, &quot;Confidence&quot;, and &quot;Intellectual&quot; statistics, which in future experiences might influence the alter ego&#x27;s ability to get into college or succeed in social situations.

==Reception==

Johnny Wilson of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; described the game as &quot;a delightful, humorous and thought-provoking exercise in decision-making, value exploration and evaluation, and vicarious wish-fulfillment.&quot; He raised minor qualms concerning the disconnect between past experiences and current situations, and the mild tendency of the game to be &quot;preachy&quot;. The magazine&#x27;s Charles Ardai described it as &quot;fascinating the first time out&quot; but repetitive later. &quot;Info&quot; gave the Commodore 64 version five stars out of five, describing it as &quot;some of the most broadly therapeutic and consciousness-raising software available&quot;, and &quot;very entertaining&quot;. The reviewer concluded &quot;I would recommend this wholesome software to anyone old enough to read&quot;.

The game was also positively reviewed by &quot;Zzap!64&quot; magazine.

<doc id="495792" wikidata="Q353501" url="?curid=495792" title="Rob Marshall">
<text>Robert Doyle Marshall Jr. (born October 17, 1960) is an American film and theater director, producer, and choreographer. He is best known for directing the film version of the Broadway musical &quot;Chicago&quot;, which was based on the play of the same name by playwright Maurine Dallas Watkins. His work on the film earned him the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Feature Film, as well as nominations for the Academy Award for Best Director, the Golden Globe Award for Best Director, and the BAFTA Award for Best Direction. He also directed the films &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot;, &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides&quot;, &quot;Into the Woods&quot;, &quot;Mary Poppins Returns&quot;, and the Disney live-action remake &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Robert Doyle Marshall Jr. was born in Madison, Wisconsin. His father and namesake, Robert Doyle Marshall Sr., was a Ph.D. student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and his mother Anne was a teacher. Like him, his younger sister Kathleen became a choreographer and director.

In 1964, Robert Marshall joined the English department at the University of Pittsburgh, and the Marshall family relocated to Pittsburgh. Anne would later work for Pittsburgh Public Schools and the University of Pittsburgh School of Education, and Robert would become associate professor of English and dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at the same university.

Rob Marshall graduated from the Falk School, and then in 1978 from Taylor Allderdice High School, into whose alumni hall of fame he later was inducted. Graduating from Carnegie Mellon University in 1982, Marshall worked in the Pittsburgh theatre scene, performing with such companies as Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera.

==Career==
Marshall went on to perform as a dancer in various Broadway shows, but suffered a herniated disc while performing in &quot;Cats&quot; and after recovering, transitioned into choreography and then directing.

He debuted in the film industry with the TV adaptation of the musical &quot;Annie&quot; by Charles Strouse and Martin Charnin. He went on to direct the 2002 adaptation of the Kander and Ebb musical &quot;Chicago&quot;, for which he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Director. His next feature film was the drama &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; based on the best-selling book of the same name by Arthur Golden starring Zhang Ziyi, Gong Li, Michelle Yeoh and Ken Watanabe. The film went on to win three Academy Awards and gross $162.2 million at the worldwide box office.

Marshall went on to direct the 2009 film &quot;Nine&quot;, an adaptation of the Broadway production with the same name starring Daniel Day-Lewis, Marion Cotillard, Nicole Kidman, Sophia Loren and Penélope Cruz, who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. In August 2009, it was reported that Marshall was to direct &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides&quot;, the fourth chapter of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; film series starring Johnny Depp, Penélope Cruz, Ian McShane and Geoffrey Rush, which opened on May 20, 2011 and grossed $1 billion worldwide.

After working with Disney on &quot;Pirates&quot;, Marshall directed Disney&#x27;s film adaptation of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Into the Woods&quot; (2014), and produced the film under his Lucamar Productions banner. His next film was the sequel to the 1964 film &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, titled &quot;Mary Poppins Returns&quot;, reuniting two &quot;Into the Woods&quot; actresses: Emily Blunt as the title character and Meryl Streep in a supporting role.

By December 2017, Disney was considering Marshall to direct the live-action/CGI adaptation of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;, which he was officially confirmed to direct in December 2018. In 2024, Marshall was hired to take over for Bill Condon as director of the remake of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, for which he will also co-produce and co-write the screenplay with John DeLuca, John Requa and Glenn Ficarra.

==Personal life==
Marshall is gay. As of at least 2007, Marshall lives in New York City with his husband, producer and choreographer John DeLuca, whom he married in 2012. In 2004, they bought a $4.2 million summer home in Sagaponack, New York, part of The Hamptons.

<doc id="495794" wikidata="Q632491" url="?curid=495794" title="Flag of Arizona">
<text>The flag of Arizona consists of 13 rays of red and gold on the top half. The center star signifies copper production; Arizona is rich in copper, producing more copper than other states in the country.

The height of the flag is two units high while the width is three units wide. The flag of Arizona consists of 13 red and gold rays in the upper half, representing the thirteen colonies and the colors of the flag of Spain, in homage to the Spanish discoverers who came to these lands, such as Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca or Francisco Vázquez de Coronado. In the center of the flag, the copper star symbolizes the mining industry of this state, is one unit high, while the rest of the flag is covered by a blue section measuring one unit high and three units wide. The lower half is dark blue, representing the Colorado River. The suggested flag size is , with the star being tall.

==History==
The state of Arizona&#x27;s website, museum, and official materials cite the following origins of the Arizona flag:

While Harris is credited with the creation of the Rifle Team flag, several individuals appear to have played a role in the design of the state&#x27;s first official flag, including Rachael Berry, Arizona&#x27;s first elected female state representative. W. R. Stewart of Mesa was working in conjunction with Harris, who was the Arizona adjutant general and head of the Arizona National Guard. Stewart, as president of the Mesa Rifle Team, felt compelled to design a flag for competition. Reportedly, Stewart&#x27;s wife Mae sewed the first flag for competition from a sketch he had made on the back of an envelope. Carl Hayden, Arizona&#x27;s first U.S. Representative, was reported to have been involved with Harris in designing the first state flag, and his wife, Nan Hayden, was responsible for sewing the first state flag.

Other individuals were also likely involved in its conception, design, and production. The Stewart and Harris version of the competition flag&#x27;s origin is due to Stewart dropping some copper dye and white material into boiling water and the result was the copper color now seen on the flag. While some sources claim the rising sun of the earlier proposals was thought to resemble the Japanese flag and was therefore changed to the present star, other sources (including official state documents) cite the Spanish flag and the influence of early Arizona explorers, such as Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca and Francisco Vázquez de Coronado, as they searched unsuccessfully for the lost gold city of Cibola as the inspiration for the colors. However, these early explorers never used the current Spanish flag, which is of much more recent design (1785).

The flag was adopted on February 27, 1917, by the 3rd Arizona Legislature. It was passed into law without the signature of Governor Thomas Campbell. The governor never officially specified his reasons for not taking any action on the bill.

In a 2001 poll conducted by the North American Vexillological Association, the Arizona flag was identified as one of the &quot;10 best flags on the continent,&quot; ranking sixth of 72 North American flags for overall design quality.

<doc id="495795" wikidata="Q7433759" url="?curid=495795" title="Scientific Integrity in Policymaking">
<text>&quot;Scientific Integrity in Policymaking: An Investigation into the Bush Administration&#x27;s Misuse of Science&quot; is the title of a report published by the Union of Concerned Scientists in February, 2004. The report was the culmination of an investigation of the Bush administration&#x27;s objectivity in science, and ultimately a criticism thereof. 

== &quot;Suppression and distortion of research findings&quot; ==

A central thesis of the report, according to the Executive Summary (on page 2 of the text), was that the Bush administration had behaved in ways considered to be consistent with the following three situations.

# Epidemic altering and concealing of scientific information by senior officials in various federal agencies
# Active censorship of scientific information that the administration considered threatening to its own philosophies
# Restriction of the ability of government-supported scientists to freely communicate scientific ideas related to &quot;sensitive&quot; issues

== &quot;An unprecedented pattern of behavior&quot; ==

In &quot;Part III&quot;, the text of the report posits that the aforementioned activities are unprecedented in the history of the United States. The report lists the following persons and organization who had supposedly acted or made statements to support this claim.

&quot;This list is sorted first by category, then by the order in which the persons or organizations are mentioned in the report.&quot;

* Organization
** REP America
* Persons
** Ruckelshaus, William
** Train, Russell
** Panofsky, Dr. Wolfgang H. K.
** Goldberger, Dr. Marvin
** Scarlett, Dr. Margaret
** Kennedy, Donald
** Bromley, Dr. D. Allan
** Branscomb, Professor Lewis M.
** Goldman, Dr. Lynn

== Recommendations by the Union ==

Page 29 of the report states: &quot;This behavior by the administration violates the central premise of the scientific method, and is therefore of particularly grave concern to the scientific community.&quot; It then goes on, in a short section titled &quot;Conclusions and Recommendations: What&#x27;s at Stake&quot; at the end of the report, to provide recommendations for &quot;restoring scientific integrity to federal policymaking&quot; (page 30). These recommendations (on pages 30–31) include a suggestion for the President of the United States to issue executive orders, and other actions, that would prevent further &quot;abuse&quot;; for the United States Congress to hold appropriate hearings, consider the consequences of statutory law under its influence, increase the amount of publicly available scientific information, and establish an organization to guide Congress in its deliberations in technical matters; for scientists to raise awareness of the aforementioned issues and provide public policy recommendations; for the public to exercise its political influence in a constructive manner.

== Response ==
On April 2, 2004, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy issued a statement by Dr. John Marburger, the director of OSTP, that claims the descriptions of the incidents in the UCS report are all &quot;false,&quot; &quot;wrong,&quot; or &quot;a distortion.&quot; He said he was disappointed with the report and dismissed it as &quot;biased.&quot;.

<text>CLP Group () and its holding company, CLP Holdings Ltd (), also known as China Light and Power Company, Limited (now CLP Power Hong Kong Ltd., ), is an electricity company in Hong Kong. Incorporated in 1901 as China Light &amp; Power Company Syndicate, its core business remains the generation, transmission, and retailing of electricity. It also has businesses in a number of Asian markets as well as EnergyAustralia in Australia. It is one of the two main electricity power generation companies in Hong Kong, the other being Hongkong Electric Company.

==History==

The company was founded in Hong Kong in 1901 as China Light &amp; Power Company Syndicate by Shewan, Tomes &amp; Co. and others. In 1903, the company&#x27;s first power station, with a generating capacity of 75 kW, was commissioned in Hung Hom at the junction of present-day Chatham Road and Princess Margaret Road. By 1919, the company was supplying electricity for street lights in Kowloon.

The Kadoorie family joined the CLP board of directors in 1930 and retains control of the company as of 2013.

In 1983, the company established a joint venture with Guangdong Nuclear Power for the construction and operation of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant.

On 6 January 1998, CLP Holdings Limited replaced China Light &amp; Power Company Limited as the new holding company listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong.

In 2018, CLP established a new branch, CLP Innovation (previously named) and now CLP Digital. The branch has a separate company listing, Smart Energy Connect (SEC) that provides environmentally friendly solutions.

==Index constituent==
As of 2013, CLP Group is a component of The Global Dow—a 150-stock index of the world&#x27;s leading blue-chips. The company has been a constituent of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, the Dow Jones Sustainability Asia Pacific Index (DJSI Asia Pacific), and/or the Dow Jones Sustainability Asia Pacific 40 Index (DJSI Asia Pacific 40). Since 2010, CLP has also been listed on the Hang Seng Corporate Sustainability Index and Hang Seng (Mainland and HK) Corporate Sustainability Index.

==Markets outside Hong Kong==
In recent years, CLP has sought to expand outside of its native Hong Kong, accomplishing this through mergers and acquisitions. Markets outside Hong Kong it has entered include Australia (through EnergyAustralia), India, Mainland China, Southeast Asia and Taiwan.

Its first market outside Hong Kong was mainland China; by way of connecting its power stations in Hong Kong to the Chinese mainland grid, CLP began supplying power in 1979.

The 1990s saw the start of expansionary M&amp;A activity with CLP acquiring nearly a half-dozen companies between 1996 and 2005. In 1996 the company entered joint-ventures with Taiwan Cement Corporation; in 1998, part ownership of Thai Electricity Generating Public Co Ltd; and in 2001, Australian Yallourn Energy. It expanded operations in Australia to include retailing when it bought TXU Merchant Energy in 2005. And in 2002 CLP acquired an Indian company, Gujarat Paguthan Energy Corporation Private Limited.

==Power stations==
CLP has a number of power stations in Asia. While most are either coal-fired or fossil fuel power stations, the company also generates electricity using nuclear, solar energy and wind power.

===Hong Kong===

Hong Kong sites include Black Point Power Station, Castle Peak Power Station, and Penny&#x27;s Bay Power Station.

===Mainland China===
CLP was the equity investors of two power stations in Guangdong province, Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant and Guangzhou Pumped Storage Power Station in Conghua, Guangzhou. It also operates a Guangxi province plant, Fangchenggang power station.

===India===
CLP power stations in India include gas powered Gujarat Paguthan Energy Corporation&#x27;s former station Paguthan Combined Cycle Power Plant and a coal-fired power station Mahatma Gandhi Super Thermal Power Project at Jhajjar, Haryana, that was commissioned in 2012.

The company also has a number of wind power sites in the country. It has now signed up for its very first solar project - Veltoor at Telangana.

===Australia===
EnergyAustralia is a wholly owned subsidiary of CLP and is one of Australia&#x27;s largest integrated energy businesses. As of 2013, EnergyAustralia generates electricity from coal, gas and renewable energy sources, and retails electricity and gas, of 5,662MW to over 2.8 million residential and business users across Victoria, South Australia, New South Wales, the ACT and Queensland.

===Southeast Asia and Taiwan===
CLP established its presence in Southeast Asia and Taiwan in the early 1990s. Since then, they have built a portfolio of quality assets in the region.

Following the divestment of interest in EGCO in Thailand in early 2011, their investments currently consist of the Ho-Ping coal-fired project in Taiwan and the Lopburi solar farm in Thailand. They are also co-developing two coal-fired projects in Vietnam.

<doc id="495797" wikidata="Q369833" url="?curid=495797" title="Flag of Arkansas">
<text>The state flag of the U.S. state of Arkansas, also known as the Arkansas flag, is a red banner charged with a large blue-bordered white lozenge (diamond). Twenty-nine five-pointed stars appear on the flag: twenty-five small white stars within the blue border, and four larger blue stars in the white diamond. The state&#x27;s name appears in blue within the white lozenge, with one star above and three stars below. The star above and the two outer stars below point upwards; the inner star below points downwards. The flag was designed by Willie K. Hocker of Wabbaseka, a member of the Pine Bluff Chapter of the Arkansas Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution.

== History ==
In 1912, the Pine Bluff Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution decided to present the newly commissioned battleship USS &quot;Arkansas&quot; with an official state flag. The chapter contacted Arkansas secretary of state Earle E. Hodges requesting information on how to obtain the state&#x27;s flag. Hodges then informed the chapter that in fact no such state flag existed. With Hodge&#x27;s support, the Pine Bluff Chapter began a statewide contest to design a new state flag. A committee was appointed, and it asked for designs to be submitted for consideration. Hocker&#x27;s design was &quot;a rectangular field of red, on which is placed a large white diamond, bordered by a wide band of blue. Across the diamond is the word &#x27;ARKANSAS&#x27;,&quot; (placed there by request of the committee) &quot;and the blue stars, one above, two below the word. On the blue band are placed 25 white stars.&quot;

In 1923, the legislature added a fourth star, representing the Confederate States. This fourth star was originally placed so that there were two stars above the state name and two below; this was to include the Confederate States alongside France, Spain, and the United States. Since this disturbed the other two meanings of the original three stars, the legislature corrected this in 1924 by placing the fourth star above &quot;ARKANSAS&quot; and the original three stars below it, as it is today. The 1924 design was confirmed as law in 1987 by Act 116, signed by Governor Bill Clinton.

In 2011, Act 1205 (formerly House Bill 1546) was signed by Governor Mike Beebe, adding some more details to the flag. In the terms of colors, the red and blue used on the flag of Arkansas are Old Glory Red and Old Glory Blue. The Act also stated that flags purchased by the secretary of state must be manufactured in the United States.

In 2018, the original 1913 Arkansas state flag and a 1923 version both underwent an estimated $20,000 in restoration cost.

== Design ==
The flag&#x27;s elements have a complex symbolism. According to the 1987 state law defining the flag, the diamond represents Arkansas&#x27; status as &quot;the only diamond-bearing state in the Union&quot;. (Crater of Diamonds State Park was the only diamond mine in North America at the time, before more recent discoveries in Colorado and Montana. However, the state park is still the only place where the public can search for, and keep, diamonds.) 

The number (25) of white stars around the border of the diamond represents Arkansas&#x27; position as the 25th state to join the Union. 

The star above &quot;ARKANSAS&quot; represents the Confederacy, to which Arkansas was admitted on May 18, 1861.

The three stars below &quot;ARKANSAS&quot; have three separate meanings:
* The three other nations to which Arkansas has belonged (France, Spain, and the U.S.)
* The Louisiana Purchase, which brought Arkansas into the U.S., was signed in 1803.
* Arkansas was the third state (after Louisiana and Missouri) formed from the Louisiana Purchase.
The statute states that the two outer, upward-pointing stars of the three are considered &quot;twin stars&quot; representing the &quot;twin states&quot; of Arkansas and Michigan, which it claims were admitted together on June 15, 1836. However, that part of the statute contains two inaccuracies:
* The three stars were in a single row in Hocker&#x27;s original design; they were not arranged in a triangle until later. Though one source indicates that the &quot;twin states&quot; symbolism was added by the 44th Arkansas General Assembly, another states Hocker&#x27;s &quot;twin stars&quot; are actually two of the 25 stars in the diamond, in the far left and right points; the latter is more consistent with the original design, even though Michigan is actually the 26th state.
* While both states&#x27; acts of admission were signed by President Andrew Jackson on that day and Arkansas became a state immediately, Michigan was offered admission only on condition of ceding the Toledo Strip to Ohio in exchange for the Upper Peninsula. Once that happened, it was finally admitted on January 26, 1837.

In 2001, a survey conducted by the North American Vexillological Association (NAVA) placed the Arkansas state flag 45th in design quality out of the 72 Canadian provincial, U.S. state, and U.S. territory flags ranked.

==Salute==
The law defining the flag also defines a text to be used in saluting the flag: &quot;I salute the Arkansas Flag with its diamond and stars. We pledge our loyalty to thee.&quot; The salute was written by author Virginia Belcher Brock.

<text>The flag of the U.S. state of Colorado was officially adopted on June 5, 1911. The flag, designed by Andrew Carlisle Carson, consists of a fess design of three horizontal stripes of equal width, with the top and bottom stripes colored blue, and the middle stripe colored white. A circular red &quot;C&quot;, filled with a golden disk, sits atop the stripes. All aspects of the flag contain symbolism related to the state, as the blue is meant to represent the sky, the gold the abundant sunshine the state receives, the white the snowcapped Rocky Mountains, and the red the &quot;&quot; earth. The gold and white portions of the flag also represent the state&#x27;s gold and silver mining industries, respectively.

The state had one previous official flag before the current one, from 1907 to 1911. The Denver chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, unaware that this flag existed, wanted to create a flag for the state and settled on a red and white colored one, designed with the help of then-state senator William H. Sharpley. This flag was presented to the legislature but, because it was less popular than Carson&#x27;s design, it was replaced. The new design passed the Senate and House of Representatives on April 25 and May 6, 1911, respectively. The flag made its public debut at a parade on May 30, 1911, and was officially adopted on June 5, 1911. Further revisions were made by the legislature on February 28, 1929, to specify the exact colors used and on March 31, 1964, to specify the size and positioning of the letter &quot;C&quot; and gold disk.

==History==
Colorado joined the union as the 38th state with the approval of President Ulysses S. Grant on August 1, 1876. An unofficial banner, consisting simply of the state seal on a blue background, was used beginning that year. The state did not have an official flag until April 9, 1907, when a design incorporating parts of the state seal complete with the state motto, , Latin for &quot;Nothing without Providence or Deity&quot;, was adopted. This flag proved unpopular, as only one physical flag was ever produced and it was never flown publicly. Rather, it sat unused in a custodial closet within the Colorado State Capitol Building.

The origin of the modern flag of Colorado can be traced to a meeting of the Denver chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) held on November 14, 1910. Those present at the meeting were unaware of the flag that had been adopted three years earlier, and came up with the idea to design a flag for the state under the impression that none existed. The DAR members created a committee which was receiving designs by the next month, and decided to support one design that contained three horizontal stripes of red, white, and red, with the state seal in the middle. Then-state senator William H. Sharpley assisted in getting the flag bill through the legislature with relative ease, though the design ultimately proved unpopular. A new design was submitted by Andrew Carlisle Carson, with horizontal stripes of blue, white, and blue, with a red &quot;C&quot; and a gold disk within the &quot;C&quot; both in the middle and offset slightly to the hoist side of the flag.

This design proved far more popular among the legislature than the initial proposal, and passed the Colorado Senate as Senate Bill 118 with &quot;no opposition&quot; on April 25, 1911. The bill was sent to the Colorado House of Representatives and passed easily on May 6, 1911. The flag made its public debut at the end of that month, on May 30, as a part of a Grand Army of the Republic parade, and was officially approved by the General Assembly as a whole on June 5, 1911, at which point it became the new flag of the state of Colorado. The wording of the bill that was passed included a permission for the use of the flag by all citizens, meaning the design could be used on items that were not explicitly flags.

However, the legislature did not specify the size of the &quot;C&quot; or the exact shade of blue or red. Therefore, some flags utilized slightly different colors. On February 28, 1929, the General Assembly added to the description of the flag that the blue and red would be the same colors as those found on the national flag. Further discrepancies arose in the size of the &quot;C&quot; and gold disksome designs had the &quot;C&quot; wholly within the center stripe, while some had the &quot;C&quot; over parts of each blue stripe. To resolve this, on March 31, 1964, the legislature further dictated the diameter of the gold disc to be equal to the width of the center stripe. This final clarification brought about the design that is in use today.

==Design and symbolism==
Within Senate Bill 118, which passed the Colorado Senate on May 6, 1911, ten specific points of symbolism within the flag were laid out. The red letter &quot;C&quot; stands for three things: the name of the state, &quot;Colorado&quot;, the word &quot;centennial&quot;, referring to Colorado&#x27;s accession to statehood in 1876, the year of the United States&#x27; centennial; and &quot;columbine&quot;, referring to the state flower. The gold disk in the center of the &quot;C&quot; represents not only the sunshine the state receives (which totals nearly 300 days annually), but also gold and the gold mining industry in the state. The blue stripes represent the sky, and the white stripes represent both the peaks of the Rocky Mountains and silver, as well as the resulting mining industry; the blue and white stripes together also represent the colors of the columbine flower. Other symbolism apart from the senate bill has been noted, including the red coloring of the &quot;C&quot; standing for the &quot;ruddy&quot; earth that covers much of the state&#x27;s terrain. The flag is laid out in a 2:3 ratio, specifically with &quot;a width of two-thirds of its length&quot;. Legislation passed in 1964 specified that the diameter of the yellow disc should be equal to that of the white stripe, while the red letter &quot;C&quot; occupies two-thirds of the width of the entire flag.

In a 2001 survey of 72 state, provincial, and territorial flags conducted by the North American Vexillological Association, Colorado&#x27;s flag was ranked sixteenth, with a score of 6.83 (the winner, New Mexico, scored 8.61).

==Protocol==
The state of Colorado and the office of the governor have laid out rules as to when the flag can be flown at half-staff and protocol for various other situations. The governor may order the flag lowered to half-staff, along with the national flag, on the day of the funeral of a Colorado service member, at the request of the president (usually for the death of a federal government official or a national tragedy), or on the day of the funeral of a state government official. The flag is always to be lowered to half-staff on three holidays: Memorial Day (though the flags are raised to full-staff at noon, a custom dating back to at least 1906), September 11, and National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day. The governor also has the jurisdiction to order the flag lowered when it is &quot;deemed appropriate&quot;. The flag is always to be flown to the right and below the national flag, a guideline specified by the United States Flag Code.

State law mandates that government buildings and schools maintain a &quot;suitable&quot; flagpole for both the national and state flags, and that the flags must be the same size.

==Other uses==

The state flag is also incorporated into the design of Colorado&#x27;s state highway markers, though some markers use a representation of the flag that differs slightly from the official version, namely one in which the red letter &quot;C&quot; does not extend into the white stripe and is cut off at the border of the blue stripes instead. The flag is also used as an inspiration behind Colorado&#x27;s newest state logo, which was unveiled in March 2019.

The Colorado Rapids, who compete in Major League Soccer and play in the Denver area, played in an alternate kit for part of the 2017 season with colors inspired by the state flag: the top was yellow with blue accents, and the shorts were blue with yellow accents.

The Colorado Rockies, who played in the National Hockey League from 1976–82 before moving to New Jersey and renaming themselves the New Jersey Devils, used the flag&#x27;s colors and emblem on their uniforms. 

The courthouse in Mesa County, Colorado, made headlines in 2007 when county commissioners realized its flagpole was flying only the national flag, making it one of the few government buildings in the state that did not fly the state flag, though no reason was given for the state flag&#x27;s absence. The flag enjoyed renewed popularity during the 2010s, with shirts, decals, and other items incorporating the design seeing increased demand.

<text>The flag of the U.S. state of Connecticut is a white baroque shield with three grapevines, each bearing three bunches of purple grapes on a field of royal blue. The banner below the shield reads &quot;Qui Transtulit Sustinet&quot;, Latin for &quot;He who transplanted sustains&quot;, Connecticut&#x27;s state motto. The flag dimensions are in length and in width.

==History==

The first state flag was adopted during the American Civil War. The banner was described as: &quot;The field of the flag adopted was a deep blue, and the three vines, which had been on the Connecticut flag from the outset, were on a groundwork of white.&quot; It&#x27;s nicknamed was Blue Peter, and it was usually hanging in the halls of the Old State House. 

In 1897 the Connecticut General Assembly approved a new flag after it was introduced by Governor Owen Vincent Coffin in 1895. The designs were submitted by Abby Day Slocomb, the regent of the Anna Warner Bailey chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution.

The design comes from the seal of Saybrook Colony, designed by George Fenwick when it was established in 1639. That seal depicted 15 grapevines and a hand in the upper left corner with a scroll reading &quot;Sustinet qui transtulit&quot;. When Connecticut Colony bought Saybrook in 1644, the seal transferred to Connecticut Colony. On October 25, 1711, the governor and legislature changed the seal. They reduced the number of grapevines from 15 to three, in order to represent the three oldest settlements (Windsor, Wethersfield, and Hartford) (or possibly the three separate &quot;settlements&quot;, Connecticut Colony, Saybrook Colony, and New Haven Colony, which had been absorbed into Connecticut by that time) and rearranged the wording and position of the motto.

In 2001, the North American Vexillological Association surveyed its members on the designs of the 72 U.S. state, U.S. territorial and Canadian provincial flags. The survey ranked the Connecticut flag 50th out of 72.
==Flying the flag at half staff==
Customarily, the flag of Connecticut is flown at half staff when the federal flag is, which may be ordered by the President or by the Governor. According to 2007-R-0624, only the governor of Connecticut may decide that the state flag should be flown at half staff, though the right is a power of office and not a law.

Typically, the state flag is flown at half staff upon the death of a Connecticut resident serving in the armed forces, upon the death of a former governor or serving member of the state legislature, or for an event of great sorrow for Connecticut.

<doc id="495806" wikidata="Q2755894" url="?curid=495806" title="Darrell Hammond">
<text>Darrell Clayton Hammond (born October 8, 1955) is an American actor, comedian, impressionist, and announcer. He was a regular cast member on the NBC sketch comedy series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; from 1995 to 2009, and has been its announcer since 2014.

Upon his departure from the cast in 2009, Hammond, at age 53, was the oldest cast member in the show&#x27;s history. He has made more &quot;SNL&quot; appearances than any other cast member besides Kenan Thompson, and impersonated more than 107 celebrities, with Bill Clinton as his most frequent impression. On September 19, 2014, Hammond was announced as the new announcer of &quot;SNL,&quot; replacing Don Pardo, who had died the month before.

==Early life==
Hammond was born in Melbourne, Florida, the son of Margaret and Max Hammond. He was severely abused by his mother, contributing to his lifelong struggles with depression and substance abuse. Hammond&#x27;s father, dealing with his own psychological problems resulting from his military service during World War II, often drank heavily and acted out violently. Hammond found as a child that doing impressions was the only thing he did his mother liked.
He played baseball in high school and at Brevard Community College. In high school, he was a teammate of future San Diego Padres, San Francisco Giants and Texas Rangers manager Bruce Bochy. He went on to attend the University of Florida, where he graduated in 1978 with a degree in advertising and a 2.1 GPA. He credits UF theater professor David Shelton for encouraging his work. After completing college, Hammond moved to New York City where he worked as a waiter, studied at HB Studio, played roles in theater productions, and performed one set at a comedy club at age 26. Hammond then returned to Florida where he was a radio DJ at BJ 105 FM, telling Howard Stern in 2002, &quot;First I tried to be a jock, which I really sucked at,&quot; followed by being a voiceover artist in the Orlando area.

==Career==

===&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;===
At 32 years old, Hammond moved back to New York to make one last attempt at being a stand-up comedian. After seven years and two failed &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; auditions, he was spotted in 1995 by an SNL producer while doing a Bill Clinton impression - shortly after Phil Hartman, who had portrayed Clinton, left the show. After an exclusive audition for creator and executive producer Lorne Michaels, Hammond was brought on board as a cast member and performed for 14 seasons. He previously held the record for the longest consecutive tenure of any &quot;SNL&quot; cast member in the show&#x27;s history, until he was surpassed by Kenan Thompson in 2017.

He also holds &quot;SNL&quot; records for the second most impressions by a single cast member (107, as of the Zac Efron/Yeah Yeah Yeahs episode), beat only by Thompson, and also for the most times saying the show&#x27;s catchphrase &quot;Live from New York, it&#x27;s Saturday Night!&quot; to start the show (76 times, beating out Dana Carvey).

He is best known on the show for not only his impersonations of Bill Clinton, but also Al Gore, Donald Trump, John McCain, Regis Philbin, Dick Cheney, Chris Matthews, Phil Donahue, Phil McGraw, Ted Koppel, John Travolta, Jesse Jackson, Geraldo Rivera, Dan Rather, and Sean Connery, in the recurring &quot;Celebrity Jeopardy!&quot; skits. His impression of Clinton is currently the most frequent &quot;SNL&quot; impression of all time, appearing in 87 sketches over 14 years in the cast and numerous cameos. Hammond also impersonated &quot;SNL&quot; announcer Don Pardo, filling in for Pardo on occasions when the announcer was unavailable.

After the end of the 34th season, Hammond retired from the show after a record-breaking 14 years as a repertory player. Hammond was the last &quot;SNL&quot; cast member from the 1990s to leave the show. After leaving the show, he has made multiple cameo appearances.

In 2014, Hammond took over the announcer role on &quot;SNL&quot; starting with the 40th-season premiere, replacing Pardo, who had died that August. Since he began as announcer, he has also appeared in skits numerous times reprising his Clinton and Trump impersonations.

The following season Hammond reappeared on the show, doing his impression of Trump just as the real Trump began performing well in the Republican primaries. Hammond moved back to New York in 2016 after Trump won the nomination, expecting to be appearing on a weekly basis during the election. However, &quot;SNL&quot; producer Lorne Michaels decided instead to go with Alec Baldwin&#x27;s impression, believing that it more effectively captured the contemporary Trump.

===Other work===
In the late 1980s, Hammond gained fame for his impersonations of Elmer Fudd and other Looney Tunes characters in the comedy single &quot;Wappin&#x27;.&quot; The song was popular enough with &quot;Dr. Demento&quot; listeners to be included on the show&#x27;s 20th-anniversary compilation.

Hammond is a frequent guest on &quot;The Howard Stern Show.&quot; He has also guest-starred in episodes of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; and &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent;&quot;. He had his own stand-up comedy special on Comedy Central: &quot;Comedy Central Presents Darrell Hammond.&quot; Hammond can frequently be seen at The Comedy Cellar in New York City.

In the summer of 2007, Hammond made his Broadway theatre debut, playing the role of Vice Principal Douglas Panch in &quot;The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee.&quot; In 2009, Hammond had a guest starring role on the FX drama &quot;Damages.&quot; The same summer, Hammond appeared with Eli Manning, Peyton Manning, and Donald Trump in an Oreo commercial, where he does an impression of Trump.

Beginning in May 2015, Hammond began playing the role of fast-food mascot Colonel Sanders in an ad campaign for KFC, until Norm Macdonald replaced him on August 17, 2015.

Since returning to Los Angeles in 2017, Hammond has appeared in episodes of &quot;Criminal Minds,&quot; &quot;At Home with Amy Sedaris&quot;, and a &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot; spoof series on sports website &quot;The Kicker&quot;.

==Personal life==
Hammond married his wife, Elizabeth, on May 9, 1990. The couple divorced in the early 1990s, then remarried in 1997. They have a daughter together. During a 2012 appearance on the &quot;Imus in the Morning&quot; radio program, Hammond revealed that the couple was in the process of divorcing, and later that same year the divorce became final.

Hammond has admitted to struggling with alcoholism and cocaine addiction. The death of a close friend in 1991 led to a relapse of drug and alcohol abuse. Hammond regularly wears all black when not performing as an homage to another friend who died by suicide in 1992. After another relapse in 2009, Hammond went to rehab.

In August 2011, Hammond filed a lawsuit against Jose Mendez and Dona Monteleone after a car accident in which he was the passenger. Monteleone, who was driving Hammond&#x27;s vehicle at the time of the accident, is a Manhattan real estate agent.

During an October 2011 interview with CNN, Hammond revealed that his mother had abused him during his childhood. His anxiety from abuse led to cutting, several hospitalizations due to psychiatric problems, and diagnoses which initially included bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder.

Hammond says that he was medicated throughout his tenure on &quot;Saturday Night Live,&quot; and that he cut himself backstage and was once taken from the studio to a psychiatric ward. The incident helped him come to terms with what he and the doctor who treated him realized was his fundamental concern, the posttraumatic stress disorder stemming from his abusive childhood. Just prior to his 2000 appearance as Al Gore in a sketch parodying that year&#x27;s first presidential debate, he had a panic attack due to forgetting his lines. However, he gave a performance so effective that Gore&#x27;s campaign staff made him watch it to understand why he had aroused negative reactions in some viewers.

HarperCollins published Hammond&#x27;s memoir, &quot;God, If You&#x27;re Not Up There, I&#x27;m F*cked&quot;, in 2011. It is an account of his abusive childhood, psychiatric problems, struggles with substance abuse, and experiences on &quot;Saturday Night Live.&quot; In 2015 he adapted it into a one-man play starring himself, directed by Christopher Ashley, which debuted in San Diego, California, at La Jolla Playhouse to positive reviews. The director has expressed plans for a Broadway residency, although Hammond stated he would prefer an actor to play him instead, as he found the tour so stressful he had to be hospitalized twice during the Los Angeles run.

In 2015, Hammond revived his Trump impression on &quot;SNL&quot;, after Taran Killam&#x27;s attempt failed to gain public interest. The following year he returned to New York after five years, expecting that with Trump having received the Republican presidential nomination that year, he would be appearing on the show more in the fall. When Alec Baldwin replaced him, he fell into a deep depression and was prescribed Antabuse and a beta blocker to prevent a relapse of his addiction problems. Hammond and his girlfriend eventually moved back to Los Angeles, where reminders of Baldwin&#x27;s Trump impression were less advertised.

===Entrapment incident===
In the late 1980s, Hammond said that he worked briefly as a stand-up comedian on Premier Cruise Line ships. One evening, while the ship was docked in the Bahamas, Hammond says he visited a restaurant, where he consumed the equivalent of 16 shots of rum. He claimed that a man repeatedly asked him throughout the evening to take a dollar bill with trace amounts of cocaine on it. When he left the bar to use the restroom, the man followed him into the stall and told him, &quot;I think you should take this with you.&quot; Believing he was about to be mugged, he relented, and the man placed the bill inside Hammond&#x27;s pocket. Local police were waiting outside the restroom and quickly arrested him. According to Hammond, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration later told him that the episode had been a setup, and that local authorities regularly entrap American tourists; he spent a weekend in jail. Hammond was released after his father traveled to the Bahamas and paid $3,000 for his son&#x27;s release.

Hammond first publicly mentioned his incarceration in the Bahamas as a guest on a 1998 episode of the radio show &quot;Loveline&quot;; and again when he returned to &quot;Loveline&quot; in 2000 and 2004, as well as during an appearance on the &quot;Opie &amp; Anthony&quot; show in 2012.

<text>The flag of Delaware consists of a buff-colored diamond on a field of colonial blue, with the coat of arms of the state of Delaware inside the diamond. Below the diamond, the date December 7, 1787, declares the day on which Delaware became the first state to ratify the United States Constitution. The colors of the flag reflect the colors of the uniform of General George Washington.

== History ==
The coat of arms in the center of the flag was adopted on January 17, 1777. It depicts a shield of horizontal orange, blue, and white stripes. On the stripes are a sheaf of wheat, an ear of corn, and an ox standing on grass, all representing Delaware&#x27;s agriculture. Above the shield is a sailing ship. Supporting the shield are a farmer on the left and a soldier on the right. The state motto, below the shield, reads &quot;Liberty and Independence&quot;. These symbols are also included on the seal of Delaware.

During the American Civil War, regiments from Delaware flew a flag which was similar to the state coat of arms on a field of blue.

The current flag was adopted on July 24, 1913.

In 2001, a survey conducted by the North American Vexillological Association (NAVA) placed Delaware&#x27;s flag 52nd in design quality out of the 72 Canadian provincial, U.S. state and U.S. territorial flags ranked.

== Laws that enact the flag ==
The design of the official state flag shall be as follows: A background of colonial blue surrounding a diamond of buff in which diamond is placed the correct coat of arms of the state in the colors prescribed by law and in accordance with §301 of this title, with the date, &quot;December 7, 1787&quot;, to be inscribed underneath the
The official state colors, colonial blue and buff, are designated by the Textile Color Card Association of the United States, Inc., New York, as &quot;armor blue&quot; (Cable No. 10663), and &quot;golden beige&quot; (Cable No. 10781) respectively; the color shades having been determined by Colorimetric Specifications of the National Bureau of Standards, United States Department of Commerce, in Test No. 2, 1/140565, dated November 18, 1954, which is on file with the Delaware Public Archives, Dover, Delaware. The colors of the coat of arms and other elements of the state flag shall be the following: Husbandman, trousers of gray-brown, shirt of red, hat and hilling hoe of brown; rifleman, suit of green, binding, bag and leggings of buff, hat of brown, powder flask and feather of gray; shield, frame of shaded yellow, top panel of orange, center panel of blue, lower panel of white, ox of red-brown, grass and corn of green, wheat and branches underfoot of yellow, heraldic wreath to be blue and silver (twisted); ship under full sail to have a dark hull and white sails; date, December 7, 1787, to be white; cord and tassels to be blue and gold.

== Governor&#x27;s flag ==
The official flag of the governor of the state shall be identical to the official flag of this state except that it shall also bear a fringe of gold, surrounding the edge of the flag and the pole upon which the governor&#x27;s flag is carried shall have mounted thereon a model of a blue hen&#x27;s fighting cock.

<text>A major subset of the &quot;Discworld&quot; novels of Terry Pratchett involves the witches of Lancre. Appearing alone in 1987&#x27;s &quot;Equal Rites&quot;, &#x27;crone&#x27; Esme Weatherwax is joined in &quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot; by &#x27;mother&#x27; Nanny Ogg and &#x27;maiden&#x27; Magrat Garlick, and together can be seen as a spoof on the Three Witches in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;, and a tongue-in-cheek reinterpretation of the Neopagans&#x27; Triple Goddess. Granny Weatherwax &quot;especially tends to give voice to the major themes of Pratchett&#x27;s work.&quot;

==Overview==
Witch magic is very different from the wizard magic taught in the Unseen University, and consists largely of finding clever and efficient ways to achieve the right results, often without using magic at all to do so. In contrast to wizard magic, witch magic relies more on common sense, hard work, and a peculiar brand of psychology known as &quot;headology&quot;, most commonly employed by Granny Weatherwax, and more commonly used on people.

Witch magic is less energy-intensive than wizard magic, which means that a witch can technically do more than an equally-powerful wizard. Also unlike wizards, witches do not make a big deal of their talents and look down on those who employ showy techniques and appearances. Witches unironically acting with melodrama, of which cackling is seen as an early sign, is often an indication of &quot;going to the bad&quot; and becoming a stereotypically wicked witch.

Another later addition to witch skills, established in &quot;Maskerade&quot;, but first named in the Aching books, is First Sight—seeing what is really there instead of what one hopes to see, expects to see, or what others see—and Second Thoughts—thinking about the way one is thinking.

Though witches rarely use magic, a low-level form of magic employed frequently is a &#x27;shamble&#x27;, a handmade device or construct used by witches for such uses as detecting or amplifying magic, for protection (like a &quot;curse net&quot;), or for sending out a spell. The shamble itself is not seen as having magical properties, being instead something to employ magic through, and can only be made from scratch in the moment it is needed and used only once. A shamble, which can consist of any number of things, must contain something living, such as a fresh egg or a small insect.

Unlike wizard magic, which is taught en masse, witch magic is taught on a one-to-one basis by older witches to apprentices. Although magical talent tends to run in families, witches do not teach their daughters, feeling that this would cause a sort of magical inbreeding.

Discworld Voodoo is considered to be an aspect of witch magic, combined with a sort of do-it-yourself religion, relying heavily on the power of belief. The most powerful Discworld voodoo-women can deliberately create moderately powerful gods for a specific purpose.

Generally speaking, witches are women and wizards are men. Despite the opinions of wizards and witches on this subject (that systemization comes easier to men and intuition comes easier to women), there appears to be no reason for this beyond cultural bias. There has only ever been one female wizard on the main Discworld continent, as described in the events of &quot;Equal Rites&quot;. The island of Krull on the very Rim of the Disc does not mind female wizards but no one from the Circle Sea would ever admit they exist.

The role of witches has been defined as &quot;smoothing out life&#x27;s humps and bumps&quot;, and &quot;helping people when life&#x27;s on the edge&quot;, often taking the role of a village midwife, medicine woman and death doula. Witches do not accept payment for their services, but it is understood that witches will accept gifts of food, clean used clothing or old pairs of shoes in return for their help. Despite not receiving traditional payment for their services, there is considered pride in being a witch, and Granny Weatherwax emphasises at every possible opportunity that it is considered lucky to have a witch in your house, and that it would be especially lucky if the witch was well-provided for.

Many witches, especially in the Ramtops, have steadings, geographical areas and populations that they are responsible for. It is unclear how steadings are defined; Tiffany has the entire Chalk as a steading, while other witches have only two or three villages. Steadings are not necessarily passed on to the apprentice of the witch who previously watched over the steading. However, steadings have some geographical bearing, as a discussion of the older witches dying off leads reluctantly to discussing a redrawing of territorial boundaries; this appears to be the mutual widening of steadings by the witches due to fewer and fewer young girls becoming witches, necessitating more work being taken on by extant witches.

Witches tend to lead lonely lives; they are generally feared and respected rather than liked, and often perform their duties with little or no thanks from the populace at large. This leads some witches to become resentful of their charges, and to use their power against them. A witch who &quot;goes to the bad&quot; may initially not feel she is doing anything wrong, but will eventually lose it, resulting in abuses of magic that may lead to her own demise. Witches call this &quot;cackling&quot; and, to keep it at bay, they pay regular visits to one another to gossip and take tea, often travelling some considerable distance to do so.

At the climax of events in &quot;I Shall Wear Midnight&quot;, it is revealed that the local witch, as the witch of that area, also has powers and authority not unlike a Justice of the peace; they are able to perform binding marriage ceremonies, as well as judge and deal out punishment onto the deserving.

The main witches in the books are the Lancre Coven: Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg, Magrat Garlick and later Agnes Nitt. A sub-series of young adult books introduced a new witch character, Tiffany Aching, who was gradually tied into the main witch storyline as her series continued.

Most fully qualified witches are known by the title of &quot;Mistress&quot;. Senior witches, also known as &#x27;Mistress&#x27;, are known by honorary titles such as &quot;Granny&quot;, &quot;Nanny&quot;, &quot;Nana&quot;, &quot;Goodie/Goody&quot;, &quot;Old Mother&quot;, etc.

The &#x27;mottos&#x27; of Discworld witches (as mentioned in the &quot;Tiffany Aching&quot; books) include:

* Always facing what one fears
* Having just enough money, never too much, and some string always on one&#x27;s person
* Even if is not one&#x27;s fault, it is one&#x27;s responsibility to deal with
* Witches deal with things, typically taken to mean taking ownership of a situation and finding a solution as best as one can
* Witches typically should not stand between two mirrors
* Avoiding cackling, and sliding into abuses of power
* Avoiding lying, though not necessarily having to be completely honest
* Never wishing, especially on stars
* Opening one&#x27;s eyes, and then opening them again

==Ramtops witches==
The majority of Discworld Witches are seen in the Ramtops region of Discworld, and, barring the latest book in the Tiffany Aching series, the primary protagonists of the Witch books are from Lancre, a country in the Ramtops region.

===The Lancre Coven===
The Lancre Coven is, as mentioned above, the main group of witches in the &quot;Discworld&quot; novels, and the ones featured in the novels referred to as &quot;The Witches series&quot;.

They began as a parody of the Three Witches in &quot;Macbeth&quot;, and also as a reworking of the Maiden, Mother and Crone archetypes (the Triple Goddess). It could also be said that they each represent a different stereotype of witches: Granny is the classic fairy tale witch, Nanny the village wise woman and Magrat the modern romantic Wiccan.

It has been explained in the books that three witches are required for a coven. Two witches get on each other&#x27;s nerves; the third one can get them to make up, so they can all get on the nerves of everyone else. If a coven has more than three members, they &quot;all&quot; get on each other&#x27;s nerves. (It is also mentioned that the true collective noun for a group of witches is not &quot;coven&quot;, but &quot;argument&quot;.)

====Esmerelda Weatherwax====
====Gytha Ogg====
====Magrat Garlick====
Magrat Garlick is the daughter of Simplicity Garlick, granddaughter of Araminta Garlick and niece of Yvonnel Garlick. She was the original Maiden in the Lancre coven, which consisted of herself, Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg. She is often described as &quot;a wet hen&quot;, generally by Granny Weatherwax. Magrat believes in crystals, folk wisdom, and cycles of nature, and is overall a gentle parody of New Age pagans.

Despite appearances, beneath her silver jewelry and heavy eye makeup, Magrat is surprisingly practical. She can defend herself physically when necessary, and is capable of performing impressive feats of real magic (as seen in &quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot; when Magrat uses her magic to turn the old wooden door into a rising oak—a display that impresses even Granny Weatherwax). Magrat&#x27;s gentle personality allows her to serve as a mediator between the often-clashing Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg, but she does occasionally display a strong temper herself. In &quot;Witches Abroad&quot; Magrat was chosen to serve as a Fairy Godmother, but her inability to master the use of the wand (which had a tendency to reset to &quot;pumpkins&quot;) prevented her from taking full advantage of the powers associated with this position. Magrat is technically a better doctor than the other two witches, since she actually believes in herbalism while Granny tends to use whatever plant or bottle of coloured water comes to hand as a prop for her headology (in this case the placebo effect), as explained in &quot;Lords and Ladies&quot;.

After a long engagement, Magrat became Queen of Lancre by marrying King Verence II. As of &quot;Carpe Jugulum&quot; the couple has one daughter, Princess Esmerelda Margaret Note Spelling. This unusual name was the result of Magrat&#x27;s attempt to correct a mistake made by her own mother, who had intended for Magrat to be named &quot;Margaret&quot; but was unable to spell the name properly when she wrote it down for the priest. In an effort to ensure the proper naming of her child, Magrat appended &quot;Note Spelling&quot; in the note she passed to the priest. This back-fired when he read out the complete sentence, and was mortified afterwards, but the deed had been done and no attempt to change it could be made.

Magrat renounces witchcraft shortly before her marriage, partially to prepare for her duties as queen, but mostly out of frustration with the way she is treated by the senior members of the Lancre coven and is supplanted by Agnes Nitt after the events of &quot;Maskerade&quot;. Her absence from &quot;Maskerade&quot; seemed to confirm that Magrat had retired from her career as a witch, but after Princess Esmerelda&#x27;s birth she was forced to assume the Mother role in the coven when Granny Weatherwax decided to temporarily step down during the events of &quot;Carpe Jugulum&quot;. Nanny was none too pleased with this development, as Magrat being the Mother forced Nanny &quot;to be the... Other One&quot;. Despite her new (temporary) role, at the end of the novel, she was asked, and acquiesced, to make tea by Granny Weatherwax, a role usually performed by the Maiden (in this case, Agnes Nitt).

Magrat makes a brief appearance in &quot;I Shall Wear Midnight&quot;, alongside her husband Verence as guest to the wedding of Roland de Chumsfanleigh (the new Baron of the Chalk) and Letitia Keepsake (the daughter and only child of the Duchess and late Duke of Keepsake), and was flown down from Lancre by Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg. In &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Crown&quot;, she is one of the people across the Disc who feels Granny Weatherwax&#x27;s death when she dies of old age; she and Verence were attending a conference in Genua at the time. It is also revealed that since the events of &quot;Carpe Jugulum&quot; Magrat and Verence have had two more children.

In the &quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot; animated adaptation, Magrat is voiced by Jane Horrocks. In the BBC Radio 4 adaptation, she was played by Deborah Berlin.

A fossil species of Mesozoic ginkgo has been named &quot;Ginkgoites garlickianus&quot; after Magrat Garlick.

====Agnes Nitt====
Agnes Nitt, daughter of Threepenny Nitt, first appears in &quot;Lords and Ladies&quot; as one of the local Lancre girls led by Lucy &quot;&quot;Diamanda&quot; Tockley who decided to become witches during the absence of the Coven in Genua. Along with Violet &quot;Magenta&quot; Frottidge and &quot;Amanita&quot; DeVice, Agnes had adopted a more witchy-sounding name &quot;Perdita&quot;&quot;. Faced with a disapproving Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg, she reverted to her birth name when she approached them to learn true witchcraft after Diamanda&#x27;s duel with Granny. Although she plays a very minor role in this book, Agnes is the only one of the &#x27;cool&#x27; new witches other than Diamanda in whom Nanny Ogg senses any real Talent. Following Magrat&#x27;s marriage to King Verence II, the role of Maiden in the Lancre coven was reluctantly taken up by Agnes. Agnes is a sensible young woman who suffers from a self-induced multiple personality disorder. Tired of being seen as just another overweight girl with &quot;a nice personality and good hair&quot;, Agnes tried to create a new, more exciting persona for herself. Agnes calls this alter ego Perdita X Dream (where the X stands for: &quot;&quot;a person who has a cool and exciting middle name&quot;). Perdita is even more romantic than Magrat, although her tastes are more Gothic than New Age.

The Perdita persona leaves Agnes in two minds about everything. The first mind is herself, good-natured and sensible Agnes; the second is dramatic and rebellious Perdita. It is said that inside every fat girl, there is a thin girl waiting to get out (and a lot of chocolate)—according to Perdita, she is that girl. The Perdita personality usually manifests itself only as part of Agnes&#x27;s internal dialogue, often in the form of sarcastic remarks (as though her &#x27;Second Thoughts&#x27; have taken on a life of their own). Yet Perdita is capable of taking real action in emergency situations.

This divided personality makes Agnes highly resistant to mental manipulation. Anyone trying to mesmerise or entrance Agnes will find the Perdita personality surfacing as Agnes begins to lose control, and vice versa. When Lancre is overrun by vampires with mind-control powers in &quot;Carpe Jugulum&quot;, Agnes/Perdita is one of the few people capable of resisting their hypnotic influence.

In &quot;Maskerade&quot; Agnes becomes a major character for the first time. She leaves Lancre to become an opera singer in Ankh-Morpork, under the stage name &#x27;Perdita X Nitt&#x27;. Agnes possesses an amazing talent for singing. She has a vocal range that extends from a deep bass rumble to a glass-shattering soprano, can sing in harmony with herself (a normally impossible ability), project her voice around a room (and the page), and mimic the voices of others. These remarkable gifts are due to her suppressed magical ability, which Agnes unconsciously used to enhance her innate musical talent.

After joining the opera company, Agnes meets a beautiful but airheaded young singer named Christine (an obvious parody of Christine Daaé in &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;). Although Agnes is by far the more talented of the two, she finds herself relegated to the chorus while Christine&#x27;s career benefits from the attention of the mysterious &quot;Opera Ghost&quot;. Agnes is also alienated from the rest of the chorus, due to her weight and practical nature. Granny and Nanny, having identified Agnes as the best candidate for the third member of the Lancre coven, soon arrive and complicate things further. In the end, Agnes realizes that her practical nature is unsuited the world of opera. She returns to Lancre and becomes the new Third Witch.

In &quot;Carpe Jugulum&quot;, the arrangement of the coven had been upset by Granny Weatherwax&#x27;s sudden departure, although Agnes retained her role of Maiden. She, Nanny Ogg and Magrat Garlick fended off the clan of vampires, the de Magpyr, who threatened to take over Lancre, whilst at the same time fending off the rather forward romantic advances of the vampire clan&#x27;s son, Vlad de Magpyr, who is fascinated with Agnes&#x27; dual mind, as it makes mind control over her difficult to impossible.

Agnes makes a brief appearance in &quot;The Sea and Little Fishes&quot;, where her voice is complimented during the Lancre Witch Trials by Mistress Clarity Shimmy: &quot;That&#x27;s a good cursin&#x27; voice she&#x27;s got there. You know you&#x27;ve been cursed with a voice like that&quot;.&quot; She is also called by Nanny to help her take Granny home when Letice Earwig accuses Granny about her good behavior. At Granny&#x27;s cottage, Agnes voices her own dislike of Letice Earwig before leaving with Nanny.

Agnes does not appear in &quot;A Hat Full of Sky&quot;, &quot;Wintersmith&quot; and &quot;I Shall Wear Midnight&quot;, stories which feature both Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg, nor does she show up in &quot;The Wee Free Men&quot;, in which Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg had a cameo. This leads to some speculation as to what had become of the coven. Her role in &quot;Wintersmith&quot; seems to have been filled in by Miss Tick, as more than three Witches together at one time becomes an &quot;argument&quot;. She does, however, appear in &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Crown&quot;, where she (along with Perdita) is one of the people across the Disc who feels Granny Weatherwax&#x27;s death when she dies of old age; and then later attends Granny Weatherwax&#x27;s Wake. It&#x27;s revealed that Agnes has been going on singing tours, and had been in Quirm at the time of Granny&#x27;s death.

===Other Ramtops witches===

====Gwinifer &quot;Old Mother&quot; Blackcap====
Witch stationed in Sidling Without and who is good with pigs, as acknowledged by Esme Weatherwax. She is mentor to Petulia Gristle, good with animals, and is apparently a pig-borer, cow-shouter and all-round veterinary witch. (The terms &quot;pig-borer&quot; and &quot;cow-shouter&quot; are plays on horse whisperer. According to &quot;The Discworld Almanak&quot;, pig-boring is a humane form of slaughter in which the animal is talked to death.)

====Gammer Beavis====
A witch who teaches school over the mountain from Lancre. She takes snuff and does her own shoe repairs, which makes her &quot;All Right&quot; in Nanny Ogg&#x27;s book, but has a nasty habit of being reasonable when provoked. Appears in &quot;Witches Abroad&quot; and the short story &quot;The Sea and Little Fishes&quot;.

====Beryl &quot;Old Mother&quot; Dismass====
A very old witch who has been fortune telling for so long that she is no longer able to keep her mind in the present (as Granny Weatherwax puts it, she has a &quot;detached retina in her second sight&quot;). Her mouth frequently appears out of sync with her words, and her footsteps often sound ten minutes before she actually makes them. Passing references to Old Mother Dismass are made in &quot;Maskerade&quot; and &quot;Wintersmith&quot;. Appears in &quot;Witches Abroad&quot; and &quot;The Sea and Little Fishes&quot; (where her given name is revealed as &quot;Beryl&quot;).

====Mrs Letice Earwig====
The wife of a retired wizard and a natural organiser, especially of things that don&#x27;t really need organising. She (and no one else) pronounces her name &quot;Ah-wij&quot; (a possible reference to Hyacinth Bucket from the BBC series &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot;). She wears a great deal of &quot;occult&quot; jewellery that doesn&#x27;t actually do anything. Granny Weatherwax dislikes Mrs. Earwig, claiming that she reduces witchcraft to &quot;shoppin&#x27;&quot;. Mrs Earwig isn&#x27;t actually bad, but is extremely snobbish and self-absorbed (which is later revealed to make her immune to an Elf&#x27;s power of glamour), has very poor people skills, and tends to assume everyone would really agree with her if they weren&#x27;t so stupid (so does Granny Weatherwax, of course, but at least she doesn&#x27;t &quot;blame&quot; them for being stupid).

Her approach to teaching appears to be to &#x27;trust in the folk wisdom&#x27; of the locals when it comes to practical things like birthing and medicine, and focus on such things as crystals, magic circles and soothing chants to help matters along. Annagramma Hawkin is her star (and in fact only) pupil. She is also the (self-appointed) chairwoman of the Witch Trials committee and has written a book about &quot;Magick&quot;; the &quot;k&quot; is to distinguish what she considers the True Craft from the everyday stuff Granny Weatherwax and other witches do—this in turn is a comedic reference on Pratchett&#x27;s part to the use of ostentatious variant spellings of the word &quot;magic&quot; (ranging from Aleister Crowley&#x27;s to some Wiccans&#x27;). She also appears in &quot;The Sea and Little Fishes&quot;, &quot;A Hat Full of Sky&quot; and &quot;Wintersmith&quot;.

According to &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Crown&quot;, she has since taken on a new pupil after Annagramma, continuing-on her flawed approach to witchcraft. When she learns of Granny Weatherwax&#x27;s passing, rather than feeling any grief, her first thoughts are to attaining Granny&#x27;s &#x27;first among equals&#x27; status (not yet knowing that Granny had already named Tiffany Aching as her successor), and about what she could now do with Granny&#x27;s cottage to make it over anew. After having been thwarted during Granny&#x27;s wake, she next attempts to &#x27;convince&#x27; Tiffany that Tiffany needs her as an &#x27;advisor&#x27; (viewing Nanny Ogg as unqualified), and is furious when Tiffany turns her away, and over the following weeks and months she fans rumours that Tiffany isn&#x27;t up to the job (as Tiffany is stretched thin trying to witch two steadings). However, when the threat of the elves rises, she is amongst those called upon to fight them off (during which her &#x27;immunity&#x27; to the elves glamour comes to light), and is amongst the force to drive the Elf Lords&#x27; Lankin&#x27;s and Peaseblossom&#x27;s forces away from Lancre.

====Ammeline &#x27;Goodie&#x27; Hamstring====
Ammeline Hamstring, also known as &#x27;Goodie&#x27; Hamstring was a witch from Lancre, the Ramtops. She appeared only in &quot;Mort&quot;, and was Mort&#x27;s first &quot;collection&quot; as Death&#x27;s apprentice. She had a grey cat.

As with all Discworld magical practitioners, she knew in advance when her death would be and again would be personally visited by Death (or had a right to be anyway) so she had time to prepare.

When Mort arrived she was an elderly lady with a hooked nose wearing a grey woollen dress. After Mort cut the line connecting her soul to her body, she realised it was no longer bound by the body&#x27;s morphic field, and with much more control than most people her soul&#x27;s form settled into the shape of her &quot;inner self&quot;. Her hair unwound itself from its tight bun, changing colour and lengthening, her body straightened up. Wrinkles dwindled and vanished, and her dress turned into something green and clingy.

Rather than go on to an afterlife, she remained at her home, intending her spirit to get thinner and spread through the forest.

====Miss Level====
A witch for whom the phrase &quot;I&#x27;ve only got one pair of hands&quot; was highly inappropriate, for she had one mind and two bodies. She formerly worked in a circus reading her own mind. The phrase is now only technically accurate, following the death of one body, although she can still use the other as a &quot;phantom limb&quot; of sorts. This has resulted in her gaining a huge amount of respect among the local population, who had previously always suspected she was two people. An intelligent and well-meaning person, she spends much of her time explaining concepts such as bacteria to people who aren&#x27;t going to believe her. Granny Weatherwax arranges for her to be Tiffany&#x27;s first teacher because (as Granny Weatherwax will only admit under duress), Miss Level is the best of Ramtops witches when it comes to tending to the sick and elderly, and waiting upon the ungrateful, which Granny considers the soul and center of witchcraft. As Tiffany&#x27;s teacher, she appears in &quot;A Hat Full of Sky&quot;.

====Miss Tick====
Perspicacia Tick is a &quot;Witch Finder&quot;, a travelling witch with the responsibility of finding young girls who have the potential to be witches. She makes a living as a teacher, a role which has given her a habit of correcting spelling, grammar and punctuation. Since she often finds herself in areas where witches are unwelcome, she has a spring-operated hat that only grows a point when she wants it to, although her name still provides a fairly obvious clue as to her real profession (&quot;Miss Tick&quot; = &quot;Mystic&quot;).

Thanks to her time as a student at the Quirm College for Young Ladies, which views time in cold water as character-building, she has also mastered the ability to stay underwater for prolonged periods, allowing her to escape punishment from superstitious witch-hunters. To aid her in this endeavor, she is the anonymous author of &quot;Magavenatio Obtusis&quot; (&quot;Witch-hunting for Dumb People&quot;), which she generously places in the libraries of various witch-hating villages. It includes such vital information as drowning rather than burning a witch, ensuring that the witch has silver coins in her boots, and is given a nice meal of hot soup and tea before her ducking.

Miss Tick appears in &quot;The Wee Free Men&quot;, &quot;A Hat Full of Sky&quot; and &quot;Wintersmith&quot; (where it&#x27;s revealed that Lucy Warbeck is learning from her to be a Witch Finder, and practices on her own while Miss Tick is out on the road).

In &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Crown&quot;, she is asked by Tiffany to help find her a couple of potential young witches looking to learn the craft to help her caretake for two steadings, after which time, Tiffany is also approached by Geoffrey Swivel.

====Diamanda Tockley====
Her real name is Lucy Tockley, but she thought Diamanda was more witchy. She was born in Lancre, but went away to school, and returned while the Coven were touring the Disc in &quot;Witches Abroad&quot;. She set up her own coven, insisting that the Wisdom of the Ancients was more significant than anything a lot of old people knew. How much natural witchiness/wisdom she actually had may be illustrated by her willingness to summon sadistic elves. At the end of &quot;Lords and Ladies&quot;, Granny speculated she might have a relationship with the young wizard Ponder Stibbons, but he returned to Unseen University. Still to be decided is how much of a witch she naturally was versus how much magic was given to her by the elf queen.

Diamanda duelled Granny Weatherwax in &quot;Lords and Ladies&quot;. The challenge was to look directly at the sun for as long as they could stand. Nanny Ogg realized that Granny would lose the duel, so she enticed her grandson, Pewsey Ogg, to run across the magic circle in which the duel was taking place. Crossing the circle caused Pewsey to cry out. Granny looked away from the sun, got up and returned Pewsey to his grandmother. While Diamanda was the technical winner of the duel, the crowd considered Granny the best witch, because witches are supposed to help young boys who cry instead of being selfish. It is as yet unknown what happened to her following the events of &quot;Lords and Ladies&quot;.

====Eumenides Treason====
An &quot;&quot;old bat&quot; who takes on Tiffany Aching as apprentice three months prior to the events of &quot;Wintersmith&quot;. Many have come to the position before Tiffany, and she is the only one to not run away. Miss Treason uses two sticks to walk and is both deaf and blind, but manages to get along by Borrowing the senses of those around her. Perhaps her &quot;creepiest&quot; use of this talent is making whatever apprentice she has at the moment her &quot;mirror&quot; before they go out. She will have the poor dear stand in front of her and borrow her sight so that she can see herself from the girl&#x27;s perspective. The girls who have experienced this say that the creepiest part is the tingling at the back of the eyes, something that anyone whose senses are being Borrowed experiences.

All witches specialise in one field or another, and Miss Treason&#x27;s speciality is Justice (in fact her name refers to the Eumenides of Greek myth, who came to represent Justice in the later myths). People come to her to settle disputes, and usually find it very difficult to lie to her. This is most likely all in their heads, as Ms. Treason has a reputation as being very scary and also very powerful. It is said by the villagers that great kings and princes had come for miles just to ask her for her advice and to seek justice from her, and that the names of everyone is woven into the cloth she weaves on her loom (her main source of income). Though the villagers fear her more than anything else, they also seem to hold great respect for her. Ms. Treason later explains to Tiffany that she knew that the villagers would never love her, and that the other option was to make them fear her: She decided they either had to fear her, or love her, so that she could hold some power over them, using what she calls &#x27;Boffo&#x27; (see below).

One of the most notable things about Miss Treason&#x27;s cottage is that everything in it is black, from the floor to the rafters. While Tiffany is her apprentice, she has to paint her cheeses with black-colored wax so that they&#x27;ll fit in with the theme. Her cottage has all the hallmarks of a &#x27;bad witch&#x27; (i.e. skulls, spider webs, etc.,); all these are fake, bought from Boffo&#x27;s, a joke shop in Ankh-Morpork. Treason also uses the name &quot;Boffo&quot; to describe the &quot;unique power&quot; that these props give her: She describes &quot;Boffo&quot; as &quot;the power of expectations&quot;;&quot; the strength that one gains from behaving exactly as someone expects you to.

No witch actually has spiders&#x27; webs in her cottage or keeps skulls for any reason, but most simple folk &quot;expect&quot; witches to do so, and so Miss Treason obliges them; the better to ensure that when people come calling they don&#x27;t see what is really there (a tired, blind 111-year-old woman), but what they expect (a venerable, terrifying 113-year-old witch). She also ensured that many of the rumours about her are kept current and circulating, to ensure the presence of &quot;Boffo thinking&quot; among her clients. One of the most prevalent rumours is that her heart had stopped many years ago and that the iron clock she carries at her waist is actually an external mechanical heart.

Miss Treason dies of old age during the events of &quot;Wintersmith&quot;, but as she, like all witches, knows the date and time of her death, she was able to enjoy her funeral ceremony the day before. On the day of her death she comes out of her house to find: many Feegles who couldn&#x27;t miss out on the ceremony (or apparently keep their mouths shut about it), a grave dug by said-Feegles, and many hysterical villagers (who are primarily concerned with Ms. Treason solving their problems, which she does, even as she walks into the grave). Mindful of her image to the very end, Miss Treason used the presence of the locals to give them one last show (i.e. walking into the grave, stopping her clock with her thumbnail to imply her death).

Tiffany, later, half-jests that continued visits by people to her grave may turn her into a goddess figure. This later comes to pass as, when Tiffany returns to the cottage, she sees that the villagers have been leaving pleas for help written on bits of paper around Miss Treason&#x27;s grave, in the hope that she can help them from the beyond. Her cottage (and her loom) was then passed down to Annagramma Hawkin, who, after a decidedly shaky start, has begun to fulfill her role properly, with assistance from Tiffany and the Boffo&#x27;s catalogue. She uses a green mask and feet props to convince people that she turns into a hideous monster when angered.

====Alison &quot;Nana&quot; Weatherwax====
Alison Weatherwax (also known as &quot;&quot;Nana Alison&quot;), is Esme Weatherwax&#x27;s late (maternal) grandmother, and, in life, a very powerful witch. Weatherwaxes have strong magic lines in their genes, as evidenced by a distant cousin also being a wizard and archchancellor of Unseen University. First mentioned in &quot;The Discworld Companion&quot; which says little about her except that her death has not been recorded.

Alison is later mentioned in &quot;Carpe Jugulum&quot;, in which the rumours that she has &quot;gone to the bad&quot; and &quot;hobnobed with vampires&quot;&quot; were proven to be unfounded. She had in fact killed the old vampire Count de Magpyr at one point by cutting off his head and driving a wooden stake through his heart. At that time, she was apparently older than her granddaughter was during the events of &quot;Carpe Jugulum&quot;. When the old Count rises again years later, he remembers her with affection and admiration. Not the same as Aliss Demurrage.

====Goodie Whemper====
Generally referred to as &quot;Goodie Whemper maysherestinpeace&quot;. She trained Magrat in witchcraft. Unlike many other witches, she tested details of spells and performed various other experiments (such as determining how many twigs you can pull from a broomstick&#x27;s tail before it crashes), leaving several shelves of notes, recipes, and instructions in the cottage when Magrat inherited it. Despite having extensively trained Magrat in midwifery, she never taught her about the events leading up to it. She also loved to watch plays.

====Mistress Shimmy====
Mistress Clarity Shimmy has only made an appearance in &quot;The Sea and Little Fishes&quot;. According to Nanny Ogg&#x27;s &#x27;mental filing system&#x27;, Clarity &quot;&quot;lives over towards Cutshade with her old mum, takes snuff, [and is] good with animals&quot;. Nanny quite likes her &quot;because she didn&#x27;t see her very often&quot;. Mistress Shimmy and Nanny Ogg catch-up during the Lancre Witch Trials, where-in Clarity fills Nanny in on the fact that her old mother died and was buried the month before, and observing the Trials, compliments Agnes Nitt&#x27;s &quot;cursin&#x27; voice... You know you&#x27;ve been cursed with a voice like that&quot;&quot;. She also observes Granny Weatherwax&#x27;s disconcerting behavior change, wearing pink and being &quot;nice&quot;, and asks Nanny Ogg about it and starts worrying.

====Mistress Letty Parkin====
Appears briefly in &quot;The Sea and Little Fishes&quot; as one of the Witches cowed by Letice Earwig during the Lancre Witch Trials. When everyone is unnerved by Granny Weatherwax&#x27;s good moods and behave nervously, Letice accuses Granny of putting the &#x27;fluence on everyone and insists she leaves. Nanny Ogg tries to get Mistress Parkin&#x27;s (one of Letice crowd), actual opinion, but has to tell Letice to shut-up when she tries to do Mistress Parkin&#x27;s talking (and thinking) for her instead.

==Younger witches==

===Tiffany Aching===

A young witch (not yet 16 at the start of &quot;I Shall Wear Midnight&quot;), Tiffany hails from the Chalk, a region of Downland Rimward of the Ramtops. Her grandmother, Sarah Aching, was a shepherd, and by Ramtop standards was also a witch, although witchcraft was frowned upon on The Chalk, until Tiffany&#x27;s arrival. Granny Aching was a friend of The Chalk Clan of Nac Mac Feegle (an army of tiny, blue, rowdy, drunken and vaguely Scottish ne&#x27;er-do-wells), and they have befriended Tiffany as the new &quot;hag o&#x27; the hills&quot;. As Tiffany was their Kelda (Queen) for a short time, the Nac Mac Feegle see her as their responsibility, and there is no time in Tiffany&#x27;s life since then when they have not (in)discreetly watched her.

===Trainee &quot;coven&quot;===
Though witches have no leader, Tiffany joined an informal &quot;coven&quot; of peer witches she gathers together for sabbats, of which Annagramma Hawkin acted as the self-appointed &quot;boss&quot; due to her having the tallest hat and the loudest voice. This coven was based in the Ramtops region and, it is assumed, no longer continued once the trainee witches received their own steadings.

====Annagramma Hawkin====
Annagramma Hawkin was introduced in &quot;A Hat Full of Sky&quot; and is a peer of Tiffany Aching, whom she initially disdains. Trained by Letice Earwig, she can be extremely snobbish and has strong opinions about what a witch should or should not be, much like her mentor. On her first meeting with Tiffany Aching, Annagramma told Tiffany that she thought Granny Weatherwax was an &#x27;ignorant old woman&#x27; who bullied and tricked people into thinking she was powerful, which, in her opinion, was an outdated form of witchcraft. Influenced by Mrs Earwig, she believed that witches should adopt a more professional form of witchcraft by employing &#x27;higher MagicK&#x27; and using such tools as sacred circles, written spells, and &#x27;real wands&#x27;.

During the events of &quot;Wintersmith&quot;, Annagramma is assigned her own cottage, taking over from the late Miss Treason. Initially, she is unprepared for the real demands of being resident witch for a village; after Tiffany rounds up their peers, the other members of their makeshift coven, and they are each able to give Annagramma small crash courses in true witchcraft (medicine, etc.) over the winter.

During this time it is revealed that her arrogance may in part be an overreaction to a deep insecurity about dealing with situations she cannot control. She admits to Tiffany, under pressure, that, unlike what her behavior might let people think, her family is quite poor, even for Lancre standards, not even having their own cottage (living in a rented one), nor do they have their own pig. This gives another reason why having her own cottage is so important to her. She later assists Tiffany by temporarily dispelling the Wintersmith&#x27;s physical form with a fireball and ordering her broomstick to carry Tiffany away before he could re-form himself.

After Tiffany and others from her peer group assist Annagramma, it turns out that she is good enough at the part of witchcraft that consists of being tall, confident, bossy, and giving people a good show to pick up the rest along the way. Granny Weatherwax had suggested that the cottage be taken over by Tiffany, due to the fact that she was too young and Annagramma would be accepted instead (had Granny suggested any other witch, Annagramma would not have gotten the cottage). She later says, upon learning that Tiffany had been helping Annagramma, that she would have expected nothing less, leading Tiffany to conclude that the whole affair had been a ploy to prove to other witches that Mrs. Earwig&#x27;s kind of witchcraft didn&#x27;t work.

She also makes an appearance in &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Crown&quot;, as when the threat of the elves rises, she is amongst those called upon to fight them off, and is amongst the force to drive the Elf Lords&#x27; Lankin&#x27;s and Peaseblossom&#x27;s forces away from Lancre.

====Petulia Gristle====
Petulia is a young witch who was apprenticed to Goodie Gwinifer &quot;Old Mother&quot; Blackcap, who is good with pigs. She was part of the network of peers gathered by Annagramma Hawkin and a friend of Tiffany Aching&#x27;s. Generally a kind soul who is thoughtful of others&#x27; feelings, she gained new strength at the end of &quot;A Hat Full of Sky&quot; when bullied too much by Annagramma, due to her tendency of saying &quot;Um&quot; a lot.

By the events of &quot;Wintersmith&quot; Petulia has gained considerable respect in the Ramtops for her abilities with animals, particularly pigs, which are said to rival those of Granny Weatherwax herself, although what Granny would say on the subject is open to debate. She has become known throughout Lancre as the &quot;pig witch&quot;, a term meant in respect, considering that most families in the mountains own a pig. Petulia dislikes the way Annagramma refers to her as the &#x27;pig witch&#x27;, because she feels that there is &quot;too much pig and not enough witch&quot; in Annagramma&#x27;s description. Despite her disagreements with Annagramma, when Tiffany asked she agreed to teach Annagramma a few useful tips on dealing with livestock.

Petulia does not appear in &quot;I Shall Wear Midnight&quot;, but she is mentioned briefly as being an expert &quot;pig borer&quot; (literally boring a pig to death as a humane alternative to more violent means of slaughter) and that she is engaged to be married.

====Dimmity Hubbub====
Dimmity is a young witch in apprenticed training, and a member of Anagramma&#x27;s coven. She appears in &quot;A Hat Full of Sky&quot;, in which she sets fire to her own hat, and in &quot;Wintersmith&quot;, she makes a toothache cure explode. Her name is similar to that of Jill Murphy&#x27;s character Mildred Hubble of &quot;The Worst Witch&quot; novels, although Pratchett says this was not intentional.

====Lucy Warbeck====
Lucy is a young witch in apprenticed training, and another member of Anagramma&#x27;s coven. She uses the term &quot;like&quot; often. She first appears in &quot;Hat Full of Sky&quot;, then briefly in &quot;Wintersmith&quot;, where she is training hard to become a witch-finder. Tiffany Aching asks her to assist the badly out-of-her-depth Annagramma and she reluctantly agrees to help out. She wears a knife and fork in her hair, because witches believe in sorting out how odd they are early.

==Witches of the Chalk==
In the penultimate Tiffany Aching book, &quot;I Shall Wear Midnight&quot;, Tiffany has left the Ramptops area and settled into her steading as the Witch of the Chalk. During the events of the book, she encountered two young women who display latent witch talent.

===Sarah &quot;Granny&quot; Aching===
Sarah &quot;Granny&quot; Aching (née Grizzel) was Tiffany Aching&#x27;s grandmother, and very good friends with the Chalk Hill clan of the Nac Mac Feegle. To them she was the &#x27;hag-o-the-hills&#x27; (that is, the &#x27;witch of the Chalk&#x27;). She died two-years before the events in &quot;The Wee Free Men&quot; occurs, and, this being the case, only appears in flashbacks. There is substantial evidence that she was a witch, although she never said she was one. The Chalk&#x27;s late Kelda confirms that Granny Aching was one, identifying that Granny Aching had &quot;First Sight&quot; &amp; &quot;Second Thoughts&quot;, as does her grand daughter and successor, Tiffany. When Tiffany speaks of Granny Aching to other witches, they often comment that she has many of the qualities of a very skilled witch, and one worthy of much respect, as her influence was such that the people she took care of ended up mostly taking care of each other (a feat only the most skilled witches are able to accomplish), even the formidable Granny Weatherwax commented that she would have liked to have met Granny Aching.

She could be described as &#x27;salt of the earth&#x27; as well as the magma that runs beneath it. She was very important in the minds of the people of the Chalk, to the point where they called the thunder &quot;&quot;Granny Aching cussin″&quot;, the buzzards &quot;Granny Aching&#x27;s chickens&quot;, the fluffy little white clouds of summer &quot;Granny Aching&#x27;s little lambs&quot; and said she cussed the sky blue. Although people laughed when they said these things, part of them was not joking. For every inhabitant of the Chalk, Granny Aching &quot;was&quot; the Chalk; its best shepherd, its wisest woman and its memory, to the point that even the Chalk&#x27;s Feegles say of her that she &quot;[told] the hills what they are, every day. She [held] them in her bones. She [held] &#x27;em in her heart&quot;.&quot; Granny Aching was &quot;&quot;as if the green downland had a soul that walked about in old boots and a smocking apron and smoked a foul pipe and dosed sheep with turpentine&quot;. She smoked Jolly Sailor tobacco, and had two sheepdogs—&quot;Thunder and Lightning&quot;.

In &quot;The Wee Free Men&quot;, one of the last things that Tiffany saw when she was &quot;truly awake&quot;&quot; was Granny Aching, dressed as an ornamental shepherdess. Tiffany also became aware of people leaving small tributes at Granny&#x27;s general gravesite, leaving her to wonder if Granny Aching is slowly becoming an actual cultural deity on the Chalk.

She was said to have a ringing personality, never lost a sheep in her life, and was taciturn &#x27;unless something was worth saying&#x27;. Her petname for Tiffany, her favorite grandchild, was &quot;Jiggit&quot; (which means &quot;Twenty&quot; in the old counting language of shepherds, as Tiffany was her twentieth grandchild).

===Letitia de Chumsfanleigh (&quot;née Keepsake&quot;)===
Letitia de Chumsfanleigh (&quot;née Keepsake&quot;) was first introduced in &quot;I Shall Wear Midnight&quot;, as Letitia Keepsake, the daughter of the late Lord Keepsake, was Baron Roland de Chumsfanleigh&#x27;s fiancée, and later became his wife and the new baroness of the Chalk. Letitia was raised in her father&#x27;s castle by her mother after his death, and most of the time is cowed by her mother&#x27;s personality. In the events of the book, it was revealed that having become involved with Roland, she also became insecure about the former fledgling-romantic relationship that had occurred between Roland and Tiffany, so she mail-ordered a spellbook from Boffo&#x27;s Emporium from down in Ankh-Morpork (which she kept hidden from her mother) and tried to hex Tiffany, but all she accomplishes is to bring Tiffany to the attentions of the Cunning Man earlier than she would have (following the events of &quot;Wintersmith&quot;).

It was then revealed that, having grown-up in a stone castle, Letitia has a talent for witchcraft, but is untrained, and for years, Letitia was under the impression that what witchcraft entails is what is actually &#x27;Boffo thinking&#x27; and wizardry (until Tiffany set her straight). After the climax of the book, Letitia and Roland were married by Tiffany in an ancient marriage ceremony by fire, before they were &#x27;officially&#x27; wed the next day by an Omnian priest. Since she is the Chalk&#x27;s new baroness, she is unlikely to pursue witchcraft as a profession but may instead take-up spellcasting as a hobby.

===Amber Petty===
Amber is a girl who has suffered from domestic abuse at the hands of her father. After learning that she has fallen pregnant to a young man who has pursued a profession as a seamster, a profession he looks down upon in a man, her father beats her in a drunken rage, causing her to lose her baby. When this is discovered, she is left with the Nac Mac Feegle of the chalk for a time by Tiffany to undergo the &#x27;soothing&#x27; by Jeannie, the Nac Mac Feegle kelda, who discovers that Amber has &quot;the gift of understanding&quot;; being able, for example, to intuitively understand the old language of the Feegle. As of the end of the events of &quot;I Shall Wear Midnight&quot;, she is married to her lover in a wedding presided over by Tiffany. She is currently being trained by the Chalk Kelda.

==Ankh Morpork witches==

In &quot;I Shall Wear Midnight&quot;, Tiffany Aching travels to Ankh-Morpork and discovers a number of witches there. In the words of Mrs Proust, &quot;Oh, there&#x27;s a few of us, Doing our bit, helping people when we can.&quot;

===Mrs. Proust===
Mrs. Proust is the runner of the Boffo Joke Emporium. She naturally looks like the stereotypical &quot;evil witch&quot; of folk stories and appears to be the &quot;lead&quot; witch of the Ankh Morpork coven. She has one son who assists in the Joke emporium.

===Miss Cambric===
Better known as Long Tall Short Fat Sally, Miss Cambric is one of the witches who accompanies Mrs. Proust to the Chalk. She suffers from tides; her body expands and contracts with the moon&#x27;s influence. She is being trained by Mrs. Happenstance. Her expanding and shrinking tendencies were very helpful in &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Crown&quot;, where she was able to inflate and fall on fairies, thereby crushing them.

===Mrs. Happenstance===
Mrs. Happenstance also accompanies Mrs. Proust to the chalk. Little is known about her other than the fact that she has a small bladder and/or bowel troubles.

==Other witches==
Other witches featured in the books include:

===Aliss Demurrage===
Aliss Demurrage, or Black Aliss as she was known (a nod to the name &quot;Black Annis&quot;, from English folklore), never appears in the books, being long dead, but she is a part of why Esme Weatherwax is the way she is. Aliss was an incredibly powerful Discworld witch. She knew all the tricks a witch should know, and had mastered the use of stories; Nanny Ogg said she could be running as many as three of them at once. Unfortunately, after a while she was unable to distinguish reality from her stories and started going mad—hence the name Black Aliss (although Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg claim the name arose because she had black teeth and fingernails due to her love of sweets). She is the wicked witch mentioned in popular fairy tales such as Sleeping Beauty, and met her end when she was pushed into the oven of her gingerbread house (à la Hansel and Gretel). Black Aliss is the bad witch in most fairy tales.

Aliss trained Nanna Plumb, who trained Goody Heggety, who trained Nanny Gripes, who trained Granny Weatherwax. Esme is as powerful as Aliss was, if not more so, and is concerned constantly with keeping herself in check lest she end up like Aliss.

While Granny Weatherwax is said to be stronger than Black Aliss, Aliss is unconstrained by right and wrong. This apparently means she could, in addition to simply being evil, extend her own life as well as interfere with the nature of causality, such as preventing swords from cutting her. (Granny did the same in &quot;Maskerade&quot;, but instead shifted the wound forward in time, and causing it to wait several weeks before she would receive it.)

A gingerbread house appeared in &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot;, whose owner had been shoved into her own oven; however, this was a different witch (Goodie Whitlow) who met the same end due to narrative causality.

===Hilta Goatfounder===
A witch living in Ohulan Cutash (a town fifteen miles away from Bad Ass), who makes her money by selling medicine (says Granny), with names like Tiger Oil, Maiden&#x27;s Prayer and Husband&#x27;s Helper. She lives in Ohulan. While she cannot stand the &quot;smoke and fug&quot; of running a witch&#x27;s tent in the market, she keeps her market stall dim, smoky, and with a dense herbal smell because her customers expect it (see &quot;Boffo&quot;). She was the one who persuaded Granny to fly on a broom and gave Granny her broom. She appears briefly in the book &quot;Equal Rites&quot;.

===Erzulie Gogol===
Mrs Gogol is a practitioner of voodoo living in Genua. After some initial confusion about whether being &quot;foreign&quot; means witchcraft is different, she assists the Lancre coven in getting rid of the Duc and getting Ella (who is hinted to be Mrs Gogol&#x27;s daughter) into her rightful place on the throne. She has a black cockrel named Legba, which is able to frighten Nanny Ogg&#x27;s tom Greebo. She resurrected Baron Saturday, Ella&#x27;s father and a victim of Lilith de Tempscire&#x27;s, as a zombie. She appears in &quot;Witches Abroad&quot;.

===Brenda Loveknot===
Known professionally as &quot;the Evil Brenda&quot;, Mistress Loveknot is mentioned in the court transcript in &quot;The Illustrated Wee Free Men&quot;. She is a professional &quot;evil witch&quot;, who was present at Princess Sandy of Brokenrock&#x27;s christening, and cursed her to be stunned by a falling hamster on her eighteenth birthday. This was done by arrangement with the king, on the understanding that it would lead, inevitably, to marriage to a handsome prince. In the transcript, Mistress Loveknot&#x27;s lawyer is at pains to point out that she is not, in fact, evil, merely fulfilling a necessary role.

==Fairy godmothers==
Fairy godmothers are something of a cross between a witch and a wizard. A fairy godmother is a woman, likely always a witch to start with, who, probably through a bequest, acquires a magical responsibility over the life of a single individual. Like wizards, fairy godmothers use a magically imbued rod (in this case a wand, rather than a staff) to produce wizz-bang effects like turning pumpkins into coaches. However, fairy godmothering is probably another aspect of witchcraft, relying heavily on narrative causality.

===Desiderata Hollow===
A fairy godmother who appears in &quot;Witches Abroad&quot;, although she dies very early on. Her career meant she travelled a lot, although she was based in Lancre. She was friends with Magrat, since no-one else in the area liked foreign food, and bequeathed her wand to her so she would stop Lilith&#x27;s stories. Even though she misspells most words in her letters (like Nanny Ogg) and is seen as unintelligent by other witches, she accurately predicts her death (just like the witch Agnes Nutter, from &quot;Good Omens&quot;) and tells Magrat not to let Granny and Nanny go with her because she knew that was the only way they would agree to go.

===Nettle===
A fairy godmother, mentioned in &quot;The Wee Free Men&quot; and named in the court transcript in &quot;The Illustrated Wee Free Men&quot;. She gave Princess Sandy the traditional gifts of health, wealth and happiness, only to be sued by the princess when she didn&#x27;t feel &quot;very&quot; happy. Nettle solved this problem by turning the princess into a mirror and her lawyer into a toad.

===Lily Weatherwax===
The sister of Granny Weatherwax, featured in &quot;Witches Abroad&quot;. When Esme was still a child, Lily left Lancre following rows with her family—and possibly some sort of scandal—and changed her name to Lady Lilith de Tempscire (&quot;fr. temps cire,&quot; &quot;weather wax&quot;). She became a fairy godmother and &quot;turned to the bad&quot;; Granny seems more offended by the fact that Lily was convinced she was the &quot;good one&quot;. It is implied that Granny was supposed to be the bad one but made herself good to balance things out. She became heavily involved with narrative magic and using mirrors to boost her power, eventually becoming the power behind the throne of Genua. She looks very much like Esme, only younger (she is actually older). She failed to &quot;find herself&quot; at the end of &quot;Witches Abroad&quot; after being imprisoned in a dimension of mirrors, and has not been seen since.

==Male witches==
There are those occupations, like that of blacksmith and beekeeping, that are so old and arcane as to be tinged with witchcraft, and by tradition, considered to have a touch of magic to them, and their practitioners are seen as witches (although male ones).

===Geoffrey Swivel===
Introduced in &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Crown&quot;, Geoffrey Swivel is the third and youngest son and child of Lord and Lady Swivel (one of the lordships of the Shires). A well-educated young man and a pacifist, he is naturally dissatisfied with the hunting practices of his father, which he considers barbaric. After a confrontation with his father over this, Geoffrey leaves home and heads up into the mountains, following the wind up towards Lancre, intending to become a witch (after having seen one flying on a broomstick).

===Jason Ogg===
===Mr. Brooks===
:In &quot;Lords and Ladies&quot; he is the beekeeper at Lancre Castle, and has a special understanding of the hives and their denizens. 

==Other media==

<text>The Left Bloc (, , BE), colloquially shortened as O Bloco, is a left-wing populist and democratic socialist political party in Portugal founded in 1999. It is currently led by Mariana Mortágua.

== History ==
=== Formation and early history ===

The Left Bloc was formed in 1999 by the merger of the Marxist People&#x27;s Democratic Union, Trotskyist Revolutionary Socialist Party, and the democratic socialist Politics XXI. It has had full party status since its founding, yet the constituent groups have maintained their existence as individual political associations, retaining some levels of autonomy in a loose structure. In the 1999 legislative election the BE polled at 2%. In 2002 this rose to 3%.

=== First parliamentary representation ===
In the 1999 election BE received 2.4% of the votes leading them to enter the Assembly of the Republic for the first time with 2 MPs for the Lisbon constituency. These representatives were Francisco Louçã and Fernando Rosas. In the 2005 election BE received 6.5% of the votes winning them 8 MPs. In the 2006 presidential elections, the Left Bloc&#x27;s candidate, Francisco Louçã, received 288,224 votes (5.31%).

In the 2009 European Parliament election they received 10.73% winning them 3 MEPs. They also surpassed the CDU for the first time in an election. At the subsequent 2009 national election, the party obtained 9.81% of votes and 16 members of parliament in the 230-seat Assembly of the Republic.

The financial crisis led socialist prime minister Sócrates to agree to a bailout memorandum with the Eurogroup. In the subsequent 2011 snap election, the country saw a massive shift to the right, with the Left Bloc losing nearly half of its previous popular support, obtaining only 5.17% of the vote and 8 members of parliament. This defeat is generally attributed to the partial support certain sections of the party appeared to offer the unpopular Socialist government while the latter pursued an austerity program in response to the financial crisis.

=== Renewal, split and recovery ===
The historical merger of ideologies that gave rise to the Portuguese Left Bloc was a process that lasted sixteen years. Its main actors aged and times changed, which led to an awareness of the need for modernization and realism. Francisco Louçã is one of the founders who most insisted on restricting theory to the basic humanistic and ethical principles common to partisans and supporters in order to conquer a wider range of constituencies. The game would necessarily be played in the framework of democracy, active participation and defence of human rights. After thirteen years of intensive labor as a leader, Louçã quit the position of party chairman in 2012 arguing that &quot;it is time for renewal&quot; and delegating his functions to a man and a woman. Catarina Martins, 39 years old, and João Semedo, a veteran, would be elected co-chairmen of the party on 11 November 2012. However, the renewal process would last for over one year.In early 2014, the Left Bloc suffered a split, when elected Left Bloc MEP Rui Tavares, who already in 2011 had become an independent, founded left-ecologist LIVRE party. Left-wing intellectuals who had come together to the Manifesto 3D collective challenged the Left Bloc to converge with LIVRE towards a joined list in the upcoming 2014 European election. Two official meetings in late 2014 and early 2015 however failed with the Left Bloc referring to programmatic differences with Tavares. So while the severe austerity programs under prime minister Passos Coelho did backdrop on the Portuguese political right, the European election in May saw the Socialists and liberal Earth Party as relative winners, whereas the Left Bloc lost more than half of 2009&#x27;s votes and two of its three mandates. LIVRE received 2.2% but failed to win any mandate.

In the 2015 legislative election, the Left Bloc achieved 10.2% of the votes and elected 19 deputies, their best result in legislative elections ever, in what was considered a major upset. On 10 November 2015, Catarina Martins signed an agreement with the Socialist Party that is aimed at identifying convergence issues, while also recognizing their differences. The Bloc supported the minority Socialist Costa Government (2015–2019) with a confidence and supply agreement. The Socialist Party government would be re-elected in 2019, with the Left Bloc returning to opposition. The party voted against the 2022 budget, triggering an election in January of that year. The Left Bloc would lose 14 seats, reducing them to five, and over half of their popular vote from 2019 — tactical voting for the Socialist Party and the Left Bloc&#x27;s opposition to the budget were blamed. The Socialist Party would be re-elected with a majority government.

On 14 February 2023, Catarina Martins announced she would leave the Left Bloc&#x27;s leadership. In the 13th Convention of the Left Bloc, on 27 and 28 May 2023, Mariana Mortágua, one of the party&#x27;s most well known deputies, was elected as the party coordinator with 83% of the votes.

After the resignation of António Costa, the Left Bloc expected to gain seats and increase their voting share. Despite that, in the 2024 legislative election, the Left Bloc achieved a very similar result, keeping their five seats. Following that poor result, and in light of Luís Montenegro&#x27;s victory, Mariana Mortágua led negotiations with the remaining parties on the left (PS, PCP, LIVRE and PAN) in order to build an alternative to the incoming right-wing government.

== Ideology ==

The Left Bloc rose to prominence &quot;following a successful anti-austerity campaign and its backing by a growing popular social movement.&quot; It has been described as &quot;Portugal’s biggest supporter of feminist, gay rights and anti-racist legislation&quot; and been associated with the New Left. It occupies a flexible and moderate position to the left of the Socialist Party (PS). In comparison to the Portuguese Communist Party, the Left Bloc has been described as &quot;more socially libertarian&quot;. At present, together with the PS, Left Bloc aims at &quot;building a stable, long-lasting and reliable majority at the Parliament, in order to support the formation and subsequent action of a government committed to the change demanded through the ballot box&quot;. This purpose foreshadows changes taking place not only in the Iberian Peninsula but as in all European territory.

=== Society ===
The Bloc has proposed a number of important laws on civil rights and guarantees, including the protection of citizens from racist, xenophobic, and homophobic discrimination, support for same-sex marriage, laws for the protection of workers and anti-bullfighting legislation. These included Portugal&#x27;s first law on domestic violence, which was then passed in parliament with the support of the Portuguese Communist Party and the Socialist Party. 

The Left Bloc has called for the legalisation of cannabis in Portugal. The party attempted to pass legislation in Parliament regarding cannabis law reform in Portugal in 2013 and 2015, both of which were rejected by the then ruling centre-right coalition government.

=== Economy ===
In terms of economics the party advocates &quot;greater state intervention in the economy in order to reduce inequalities&quot;, such as rises to the minimum wage. It has also put forward &quot;many legislative proposals defending salaries, pensions and the welfare state&quot;. The party has been described as anti-capitalist. In September 2019, the party called for the minimum monthly wage to be raised to €650 for both the public and private sectors in January 2020.

=== International relations ===
It is part of the European Left Alliance for the People and the Planet; a pan-European party that supports an alternative to capitalism.

<doc id="495814" wikidata="Q329737" url="?curid=495814" title="Butcher">
<text>A butcher is a person who may slaughter animals, dress their flesh, sell their meat, or participate within any combination of these three tasks. They may prepare standard cuts of meat and poultry for sale in retail or wholesale food establishments. A butcher may be employed by supermarkets, grocery stores, butcher shops and fish markets, slaughter houses, or may be self-employed.

Butchery is an ancient trade, whose duties may date back to the domestication of livestock; its practitioners formed guilds in England as far back as 1272. Since the 20th century, many countries and local jurisdictions offer trade certifications for butchers in order to ensure quality, safety, and health standards but not all butchers have formal certification or training. Trade qualification in English-speaking countries is often earned through an apprenticeship although some training organisations also certify their students. In Canada, once a butcher is trade qualified, they can learn to become a master butcher (Fleishmaster).

Standards and practices of butchery differ between countries, regions and ethnic groups. Variation with respect to the types of animals that are butchered as well as the cuts and parts of the animal that are sold depends on the types of foods that are prepared by the butcher&#x27;s customers.

==Duties==

Butchery is a traditional line of work. In the industrialized world, slaughterhouses use butchers to slaughter the animals, performing one or a few of the steps repeatedly as specialists on a semi-automated disassembly line. The steps include stunning (rendering the animal incapacitated), exsanguination (severing the carotid or brachial arteries to facilitate blood removal), skinning (removing the hide or pelt) or scalding and dehairing (pork), evisceration (removing the viscera) and splitting (dividing the carcass in half longitudinally).

After the carcasses are chilled (unless &quot;hot-boned&quot;), primary butchery consists of selecting carcasses, sides, or quarters from which primal cuts can be produced with the minimum of wastage; separating the primal cuts from the carcass; trimming primal cuts and preparing them for secondary butchery or sale; and storing cut meats. Secondary butchery involves boning, trimming and value-adding of primal cuts in preparation for sale. Historically, primary and secondary butchery were performed in the same establishment, but the advent of methods of preservation (vacuum packing) and low cost transportation has largely separated them.

In parts of the world, it is common for butchers to perform many or all of the butcher&#x27;s duties. Where refrigeration is less common, these skills are required to sell the meat of slaughtered animals.

==Butcher shop==
Butchers sell their goods in specialized stores, commonly termed a butcher shop (American English), butchery (South African English) or butchers (British English). Butchers at a butcher shop may perform primary butchery, but will typically perform secondary butchery to prepare fresh cuts of meat for sale. These shops may also sell related products, such as Charcuterie, hot food (using their own meat products), food preparation supplies, baked goods and grocery items. Butcher shops can have a wider variety of animal types, meat cuts and quality of cuts. Additionally, butcher shops may focus on a particular culture, or nationality, of meat production. Some butcher shops, termed &quot;meat delis&quot;, may also include a delicatessen.In the United States and Canada, butcher shops have become less common because of the increasing popularity of supermarkets and warehouse clubs. Many remaining ones are aimed at Hispanic and other immigrants or, more recently, those looking for organic offerings. Supermarkets employ butchers for secondary butchery, but in the United States even that role is diminished with the advent of &quot;case-ready&quot; meat, where the product is packaged for retail sale at the packinghouse or specialized central processing plants. 

==Primal cut==

A primal cut is a piece of meat initially separated from the carcass during butchering. Different countries and cultures make these cuts in different ways, and primal cuts also differ between type of carcass. The British, American and French primal cuts all differ in some respects. One notable example with pork is fatback, which in Europe is an important primal cut of pork, but in North America is regarded as trimmings to be used in sausage or rendered into lard. The primal cuts may be sold complete or cut further.

==Metaphorical use==
:&quot;See also Butcher (disambiguation)&quot;
In various periods and cultures, the term &quot;butcher&quot; has been applied to people who act cruelly to other human beings or slaughter them. For example, Pompey, a prominent Roman general and politician of the first century BC, got the Latin nickname &quot;adulescentulus carnifex&quot;, translated as &quot;The Teenage Butcher&quot; or &quot;The Butcher Boy&quot;, due to brutal treatment of political opponents in the early part of his career. More recently, the Bosnian Serb war criminal Ratko Mladić was nicknamed &quot;the Butcher of the Balkans&quot;. 

The term can also be used in a semi-humorous or metaphorical way to describe someone whose actions resemble the various skills and methods of a butcher (chopping, cutting, slicing, stabbing etc.) Spanish footballer Andoni Goikoetxea was popularly ascribed the epithet &quot;The Butcher of Bilbao&quot; in recognition of his perceived aggressive style of play and frequent, sometimes injurious, challenges on opposing players.
