<text>Porte de Vincennes () is a station on line 1 of the Paris Métro, situated on the Cours de Vincennes, at the border of the 12th and 20th arrondissements of Paris. It is named after the &quot;Porte de Vincennes&quot;, a gate at the former Thiers Wall, which was at the beginning of the road to Vincennes.

==History==
The station opened on 19 July 1900 as part of the first stage of line 1 between Porte de Vincennes and Porte Maillot on 19 July 1900, serving as its original eastern terminus. It was the site of the very first construction work on the métro. 

Due to its then status as a terminal station, it had a unique platform configuration, consisting of two diverging half-stations on a single-tracked loop, with the southern half-station housing the arrival platform and the northern half-station housing the departure platform. Each half-station consisted of a central island platform flanked by two tracks. Porte Maillot, then the line&#x27;s western terminus, also had a similar configuration until the line was further extended west in 1937.

The station remained as the line&#x27;s eastern terminus until it was further extended to Château de Vincennes on 24 March 1934, resulting in several changes in the station&#x27;s layout. The loop was removed and the tunnels from each half-station were extended to meet further east under a&quot;venue de la Porte-de-Vincennes&quot;. The outermost track of each half-station was also removed and filled in, creating a large side platform. The platforms were also lengthened under a new reinforced concrete ceiling, past the original tiled vault.

During the automation of line 1, the station had undergone a series of upgrades. The metal panelling installed since the 1960s was removed and the station&#x27;s platform walls were retiled. Its platforms were closed from 28-29 June 2008 to reenforce and raise the platform level in preparation for the installation of platform screen doors. The line was fully automated in December 2012.

In 2019, the station was used by 7,633,984 passengers, making it the 33rd busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 4,840,436 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 17th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 5,446,602 passengers, making it the 25th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

=== Platforms ===
The station has 2 half-stations each with a single wide side platform and a single track with platform screen doors, one for each direction. 

The station is also one of only two in the network, along with Porte Dauphine on line 2, to have preserved its original decoration with flat cream-coloured tiles, which was one of the experimental decorations tested in 1900 before the famous bevelled white tiles were selected for other parts of the network.

The station has been served by tramway T3a since 15 December 2012 as part of its extension from Porte d&#x27;Ivry to &quot;Porte de Vincennes&quot;, and also by tramway T3b in its initial section from &quot;Porte de Vincennes&quot; to Porte de la Chapelle that opened on the same day. It is one of four métro stations on the network that is located at one of the former gates of Paris and is served by two tram lines; the other three are Porte de Choisy (line 7), Balard (line 8), and Porte de Versailles (line 12). Basilique de Saint-Denis (line 13) is the only station served by two tram lines not located at one of the former gates of Paris.

<text>The Koenigsegg CCR is a mid-engine sports car manufactured by Koenigsegg and the successor to the company&#x27;s previous offering, the CC8S.

==Overview==

Debuting at the March 2004 Geneva Auto Show, the CCR was the most powerful version of the Koenigsegg CC range cars at the time. Like the CC8S it features dihedral synchro-helix actuation doors. It has, however, various improvements. A larger front splitter for optimized downforce and tweaked headlight arrangement came standard with a rear wing. New larger tires and wheels equipped with larger brakes. Upgraded suspension and a more powerful engine with twin Rotrex Superchargers, producing at 6900 rpm and of torque at 5700 rpm.

To honour the Swedish Fighter Jet Squadron No 1 (Johan röd) which had occupied the current facility of Koenigsegg, the CCR is adorned with a symbol of a ghost, the symbol of the squadron.

===Special/Tuned Editions===

====CCR REVO====

Originally a sky blue CCR with a white and blue bi-colour interior, this CCR received major upgrades from the factory upon the owner&#x27;s request in 2012 and was dubbed the Koenigsegg CCR Revo. It included numerous changes over the original car such as a clear coated carbon fibre body with candy red accents, red and black bi-colour interior with Koenigsegg Revo embroidered on the passenger side of the dashboard along with a fire extinguisher and an updated steering wheel, CCX rear diffuser, side skirts, fog lights, front splitter and wheels along with the twin-deck F1 rear spoiler found on the CCXR. The car also received engine upgrades such as an updated engine management system and superchargers.

====EDO Competition CCR Evolution====

A German-based tuning company named EDO Competition highly modified a CCR in 2011. They said CCR was originally yellow but had already received upgrades from the factory such as Silver exterior paint and 11-spoke CCX wheels, front splitter and side skirts, as well as the &quot;Top Gear&quot; rear spoiler in 2008. The company&#x27;s process with the CCR began with a modified ECU to boost power and a modified drive ratio to allow the vehicle to achieve its peak torque. The six speed gearbox was disassembled in its entirety and the plastic bushings were replaced with Uniball units resulting in the improved drive ratio. Due to the remapped ECU, power was up from and the reduction of the redline to 7,200 rpm. As a result, the EDO Competition CCR Evolution can get from 0 to in 3.2 seconds, 0 to in 9.7 seconds, and 0 to in 23 seconds. As for the exterior, the tuner offered a new set of wheels with a coat of charcoal paint and an updated front end with auxiliary lights. The interior of the Koenigsegg was then covered in Alcantara material and a redesigned center console was added to accommodate a new infotainment system with a reversing camera and a custom-made pouch for the immobilizer remote. The total cost for this customization kit was €40,000 or $56,428.

==Speed record==
At its debut, Koenigsegg claimed the CCR to be the fastest production car with a theoretical top speed of more than . Said claim was put to test on February 28, 2005, at Italy&#x27;s Nardò Ring where a team of five Koenigsegg engineers and mechanics together with founder Christian von Koenigsegg ran a standard CCR, driven by Loris Bicocchi to a top speed of , breaking the fastest production car record (if &quot;production car&quot; is defined accordingly). However, in April 2005, not long after the CCR claimed the record, a prototype of the long-awaited Bugatti Veyron took the crown with a top speed over with the production model reaching .

<text>Porte Dauphine () is the western terminus of Line 2 of the Paris Métro. It is situated in the 16th arrondissement. Avenue Foch station, served by the RER C line, is located nearby, as is Paris Dauphine University.

==Location==
The station is established under the Place du Maréchal-de-Lattre-de-Tassigny, on a loop comprising two half-stations approximately oriented north-west / south-east. It is preceded or followed (depending on the direction) by the Victor Hugo station.

==History==
Porte Dauphine station was inaugurated on 13 December 1900 as the western terminus of the first section of line 2 Nord which will more simply become line 2 on 17 October 1907. Although Line 2 had then been completed only as far as Charles de Gaulle–Étoile, it now runs from Porte Dauphine, around the northern part of Paris, through Montmartre, around to its eastern terminus at the Place de la Nation.

It is named after &quot;Porte Dauphine&quot;, a gate in the 19th-century Thiers wall of Paris. Its subtitle honours Jean de Lattre de Tassigny. because of its location under the square of the same name), French general officer, hero of the Second World War and Companion of the Liberation, who was raised to the dignity of Marshal of France posthumously. However, this subtitle does not appear on the plans.

As part of the RATP&#x27;s &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; program, the station&#x27;s corridors were renovated on 31 May 2011.

In 2019, 2,932,159 travelers entered this station which placed it at the 180th position of the metro stations for its attendance of 302.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station is famous for one of its entrances, created by Hector Guimard, registered as a historic monument by the decree of 12 February 2016 and completely restored in October 1999 for the celebrations of the centenary of the Paris metro. It has a total of four metro outlets:
* entrance 1 - &quot;Boulevard Lannes&quot;, consisting of a fixed staircase diverging into two other staircases, each decorated with a Dervaux candelabra, leading to Place du Paraguay at the right of nos. 81 and 83 of Avenue Foch;
* entrance 2 - &quot;Avenue Foch&quot;, consisting of a fixed staircase also decorated with a Dervaux mast, located north of the odd median of this avenue;
* entrance 3 - &quot;Boulevard de l&#x27;Amiral-Bruix&quot;, consisting of a fixed staircase topped with the only original Guimard kiosk with a canopy in the Art Nouveau style, located opposite the Place des Généraux-de-Trentinian on the even side of the Avenue Foch;
* entrance 4 - &quot;Avenue Bugeaud&quot;, consisting of a fixed staircase allowing only an exit and equipped with a more modest Guimard entourage (also classified as a historic monument), leading to the angle formed by this avenue and the odd alley of Avenue Foch, to the right of no. 77 of the latter.

===Station layout===

*Note: The station is on a loop, so the westbound/drop-off and eastbound platforms are slightly offset.

===Platforms===
Porte Dauphine is a station with a particular configuration. It is made up of two diverging half-stations, each in its own tunnel, joined by a very tight turning loop, only in radius, in accordance with its original &quot;racket&quot; (&quot;en raquette&quot;) layout, which is the only one on the network to be fully preserved. The arrival half-station to the north has two central tracks, the northern one serving a single side platform, while the southern one, a dead-end to the west without a platform, is used as a siding and runs alongside technical rooms. The half-station for departure is made up of two tracks separated by an island platform; on the north side is a dead-end to the west, which is also used as a depot siding, while the south side receives trains from the reversing loop. The vault is elliptical in both cases.

The station is also one of only two in the network, along with Porte de Vincennes on line 1, to have preserved its original decoration in flat cream-coloured tiles, which was one of the experimental decorations tested in 1900 before the famous bevelled white tile was selected for other parts of the network. This tiling covers the walls, the vault and the tunnel exits. Lighting is provided by a tube strip in each half station. The platforms are free of advertisements and the name of the station is inscribed on enamel plaques, in capital letters or in Parisine font depending on the location. The boarding platform has benches made of wooden slats painted red.

===Architecture===
The station contains one of the three remaining &quot;dragonfly&quot; roofed Métro entrances by Hector Guimard (1867–1942), the Art Nouveau architect who was originally commissioned by the Compagnie du Métropolitain de Paris (CMP) in 1899 to design the entrances for the Métro stations. It is the only roofed entrance that is original, not reconstructed, and on its original site. It was restored in 1999.

===Other connections===
The station is connected by public road to the Avenue Foch station located on RER C. It is also served by the Paris tramway Line 3b, whose extension to Porte Dauphine opened on 5 April 2024, and by the PC line of the RATP Bus Network.

<doc id="502608" wikidata="Q439903" url="?curid=502608" title="Armand Călinescu">
<text>Armand Călinescu (4 June 1893 – 21 September 1939) was a Romanian economist and politician, who served as 39th Prime Minister from March 1939 until his assassination six months later. He was a staunch opponent of the fascist Iron Guard and may have been the real power behind the throne during the dictatorship of King Carol II. He survived several assassination attempts but was finally killed by members of the Iron Guard with German assistance.

==Biography==

===Early life===
He was born in Pitești as the son of Mihai Călinescu, a Romanian Army veteran, and his wife Ecaterina, &quot;née&quot; Gherasim. Mihai Călinescu was a landowner and relatively wealthy man.

Călinescu attended secondary school and high school in his native city at Ion Brătianu High School. Between 1912 and 1918 he studied Law and Philosophy at the University of Bucharest, before taking a PhD in Economics and Political Sciences at the Faculty of Law and Economics from the University of Paris, with a thesis on &quot;Le change roumain. Sa dépreciation depuis la guerre et son rétablissement&quot; (&quot;The Romanian Exchange Rate. Its Depreciation Since the War and Its Recovery&quot;).

===PȚ and PNȚ===
Initially, Călinescu intended to enter the political scene as a member of the dominant National Liberal Party (PNL), but his views on politics were rejected by its leader Ion I. C. Brătianu. Instead, he joined the Peasants&#x27; Party (PȚ), a rising opposition group, falling under the influence of Ion Mihalache. He was first elected to office in 1926, as one of the 38 PŢ deputies in opposition to the second Alexandru Averescu cabinet, and was reelected for consecutive terms until 1937.

After the PȚ merged with the Romanian National Party to create the National Peasants&#x27; Party (PNȚ), he stood on the group&#x27;s left wing, together with Mihai Ralea, Ernest Ene, Mihail Ghelmegeanu, Petre Andrei and Nicolae L. Lupu. He was the PNȚ local leader for Argeș County and, when the party came to power with the Iuliu Maniu cabinet in 1928, served as prefect of Argeș before being appointed general secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture by Mihalache (who was titular Minister). In 1930, he was appointed Under Secretary of State in the Alexandru Vaida-Voevod-led Ministry of the Interior.

In the latter capacity, Călinescu oversaw actions against the illegal Communist Party: he ordered the troops to carry out arrests of suspected agitators after the miners&#x27; strike in Lupeni, and ordered troops to open fire on demonstrators during the Grivița strike of 1933, leading to the deaths of seven workers.

His equally firm opposition to the fast rise of the fascist Iron Guard (the Legionnaires, a group he helped outlaw in January 1931), contributed to the fall of the 1933 Vaida-Voevod government of which Călinescu was a member. The Guard&#x27;s leader, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, had by then issued intimidating replies in the far right press.

In opposition to the Gheorghe Tătărescu PNL cabinet, Călinescu warned against the latter&#x27;s tolerant stance toward the Legionnaires, especially after the murder of Ion G. Duca in December 1933 and the desecration of his memorial plate in 1936 (&quot;The Iron Guard is not a movement of the [public] opinion, but rather an association of assassins and foul profaners of tombs&quot;).

===Carol&#x27;s minister===
A staunch ally of France and the United Kingdom and a steadfast adversary of the Iron Guard movement in Romania, Călinescu also supported King Carol II&#x27;s move to counter the Iron Guard&#x27;s success; he first confronted the PNȚ leadership during the elections of 1937, after it signed an electoral agreement with the Iron Guard. Eventually, he defied his party by becoming Minister of the Interior after December of that year, in the short-lived Octavian Goga cabinet formed by the National Christians, being immediately expelled from the PNȚ.

He began preparing himself for the confrontation with the Iron Guard. While organizing the early elections of March 1938, he took steps to limit the Guard&#x27;s propaganda machine, and closed down all press linked to the Guard, causing violent clashes between the movement and representatives of state authorities.

Călinescu remained in office during the royal dictatorship established by King Carol in 1937, serving as vice-premier under Miron Cristea. According to historian Joseph Rothschild, he was actually the real power in the government. He was also a founding member of the National Renaissance Front (FRN) created by as the sole legal party in December 1938, and was generally seen as very close to Carol. He soon became involved in a virulent dispute with historian Nicolae Iorga, when the latter issued harsh criticism regarding Carol&#x27;s January 1939 initiative to dress large sections of the society, including Romanian Academy members, in various uniforms (a measure backed by Călinescu); Iorga remarked with irony: &quot;I&#x27;m prepared to wear the FRN uniform, but allow me to wear a speared helmet on my head, on which to place [that is, to impale] the Minister of the Interior&quot;. Eventually (in May of the same year), Iorga gave in to the demands and became a supporter of the regime.

In May, after witnessing the result of German pressure on Austria (&quot;see Anschluss&quot;), Călinescu decapitated the Guard by ordering arrests of its leaders, beginning with that of Codreanu, as well as many of its members and sympathisers (including Nae Ionescu and Mircea Eliade). Codreanu and other leaders (probably as much as 300 people) were consequently killed in custody; ostensibly because they were &quot;killed while trying to escape&quot;. Other Legionaries were pressured to sign &quot;declarations of dissociation&quot;. Many other Guard leaders, including Horia Sima, fled to various locations in Germany.

On 7 March 1939, after brief stints as Minister of Health and Minister of Education, he replaced Cristea as Premier upon his death, being considered the &quot;man of steel&quot; able to prevent the Iron Guard&#x27;s political rise and to keep Romania out of the pro-German war camp (the nickname &quot;The Man of Steel&quot; probably originated, under the form &quot;l&#x27;homme d&#x27;acier&quot;, in essays written by the French journalists Jérôme and Jean Tharaud on Romanian topics). However, he had been Prime Minister in all but name since February, when he was granted extensive powers in the wake of Cristea&#x27;s illness. Călinescu was also Minister of the Interior and Minister of Defense. In September of that year, after the invasion of Poland, certain members of Iron Guard alleged that Călinescu and the King Carol planned with the British Intelligence services to blow up the Prahova oil fields, preventing Germany from taking control and using them.
Armand Călinescu allowed the Polish Government-in-Exile and civilians to take refuge in Romania and also ordered Romanian trains to be sent to Poland to evacuate Polish national treasures, which were sent to England from the Romanian port of Constanța, an action which made the Third Reich very angry with the Romanian Government.

==Death==

Călinescu was shot dead on 21 September 1939 in Bucharest by Iron Guard members under the direct leadership of Sima. This was the last of several assassination attempts, including an attack on the Romanian Athenaeum and bombing a bridge over the Dâmbovița River, both of which were thwarted by the police.

It seems that the action was carried out with German approval and assistance.

==Legacy==
The vast majority of sources reacting to the events made ample mention of German backing for Călinescu&#x27;s killers, with the exception of German media. German sources alleged that Polish and British political forces had supported the assassination as a means to pressure Romania into abandoning its neutrality, a version that was supported by, among others, Hans Fritzsche.

A more severe repression of the Iron Guard followed under the provisional leadership of Gheorghe Argeșanu and was inaugurated by the immediate execution of the assassins and the public display of their bodies at the murder site for days on end. A placard was set up on the spot, reading &quot;De acum înainte, aceasta va fi soarta trădătorilor de țară&quot; (&quot;From now on, this shall be the fate of those who betray the country&quot;). Students from several Bucharest secondary schools were required to visit the site (based on the belief that would dissuade them from affiliating with the Guard). Executions of known Iron Guard activists were ordered in various places in the country (some were hanged on telegraph poles, while a group of Legionnaires was shot in front of Ion G. Duca&#x27;s statue in Ploiești); in all, over 300 members of the Iron Guard were killed without trial. Călinescu was succeeded by Marinescu as Minister of the Interior and by Ioan Ilcuș as Minister of Defense.

One year later, under the National Legionary State (the Iron Guard&#x27;s government), Marinescu and Argeșanu, alongside other politicians, were executed at Jilava Prison (September 1940); it was also at that time that the Călinescu family crypt in Curtea de Argeș was dynamited, and a bronze bust of him which awaited unveiling was chained and dragged through the streets of Pitești. Călinescu&#x27;s wife Adela was required to hand all of her husband&#x27;s personal documents and, in a letter to &quot;Conducător&quot; Ion Antonescu, claimed to have been repeatedly harassed by agents of Siguranța Statului.

<text>Hutchins Gordon Burton (1774April 21, 1836) was the 22nd Governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina from 1824 to 1827. Some sources indicate that he was not affiliated with any party at the time, although he was associated, according to other sources, with the Federalist Party and later with the National Republican Party.

There is some uncertainty as to the time and place of Burton&#x27;s birth. Burton appears to have been born in Mecklenburg County, Virginia in 1774. However, some sources also give his birth year as 1782. Burton was sent to Granville County, North Carolina (now Vance County) to live with his uncle, Revolutionary War Colonel and politician Robert Burton, when his father died. Young Burton went on to practice law, serve in the North Carolina General Assembly, and be elected by that body as North Carolina Attorney General. He served as Attorney General from 1810 until his resignation in 1816.

Burton moved to Halifax Town in 1817 and practiced law. He was elected to the state House of Commons on August 14, 1817 and served a single one-year term. On August 12, 1819, Burton was elected to the United States House of Representatives for the term 1819–1821. He was supported both by the Federalists, who were strong in Halifax Town, and also by the Democratic-Republican Party. Burton was re-elected in 1821 and 1823. He resigned from Congress on March 23, 1824.

The North Carolina state legislature elected Burton the Governor of the state in 1824 and re-elected him in 1825 and 1826. During his term, President John Quincy Adams appointed him governor of Arkansas, but Burton was not confirmed by the United States Senate.

Burton died in 1836 while visiting relatives in Iredell County, North Carolina and is buried at Unity Presbyterian Church in Lincoln County, North Carolina.

== Ghost ==

The circumstances of Governor Burton&#x27;s death have long been part of family oral tradition and North Carolina lore. As Armistead C. Gordon, Esq. recounts in Marguerite du Pont Lee&#x27;s Virginia Ghosts and Others, &quot;Among the historic homes in the old County and town of Halifax, N.C. is &quot;Rocky Hill&quot; the summer residence of Governor Hutchins G. Burton, a distinguished lawyer and statesman of the Revolutionary period, who married a daughter of Willie Jones, the famous Jeffersonian-Republican leader through whose efforts the adoption of the Federal Constitution was defeated in the Hillsboro Convention of North Carolina because it contained no Bill of Rights.

Governor Burton lived at &quot;The Grove,&quot; the residence of his father-in-law, Willie Jones, in the town of Halifax where John Paul, the young Scotch sailor, spent some months prior to entering the American Navy at the beginning of the Revolution, and in honor of whose owners, Mr. and Mrs. Jones; he adopted the name of John Paul Jones.

Governor Burton and his family were staying at Rocky Hill in the spring of 1836, when he was called to Texas where he owned a large tract of land. Setting out by stage coach, he arrived at Salisbury in the western part of the State and stopped there on his way south to look after some business in court. Meeting his cousin Robert Burton of Lincoln County he went home with him to spend a few days. On the trip to Lincoln County he and his cousin visited the Wayside Inn and spent the night. Here he was taken ill and died within twenty-four hours, April 21, 1836 at age 61.

His wife [Sarah &quot;Sallie&quot; Welsh Jones Burton] had been on a visit and was returning to Rocky Hill about dusk in her carriage driven by her servant William and accompanied by an infant grandchild and a nurse. As they approached the house which is situated on a high hill she and William saw Governor Burton coming down the hill on a white horse which he usually rode. Her attention was distracted momentarily by the crying of the child and when she looked again expecting her husband to speak as he approached the carriage both rider and horse had vanished.

On account of the slow mail facilities of the time, Mrs. Burton did not hear of the Governor&#x27;s death until three weeks after it occurred, and she then learned that he had died at the very hour when the apparition had appeared to her and her carriage driver.

Rocky Hill which is situated near Ringwood in Halifax County was still standing in 1918 and was then owned by Mr. S. Harrison. The story of Governor Burton&#x27;s apparition is well authenticated and has persisted in Halifax County for nearly a hundred years.

He was buried in Unity Churchyard, Lincoln County.&quot;

<doc id="502614" wikidata="Q1862419" url="?curid=502614" title="Louis Armstrong and His Hot Seven">
<text>Louis Armstrong and His Hot Seven was a jazz studio group organized to make a series of recordings for Okeh Records in Chicago, Illinois, in May 1927. Some of the personnel also recorded with Louis Armstrong and His Hot Five, including Johnny Dodds (clarinet), Lil Armstrong (piano), and Johnny St. Cyr (banjo and guitar). These musicians were augmented by Dodds&#x27; brother, Baby Dodds (drums), Pete Briggs (tuba), and John Thomas (trombone, replacing Armstrong&#x27;s usual trombonist, Kid Ory, who was then touring with King Oliver). Briggs and Thomas were at the time working with Armstrong&#x27;s performing group, the Sunset Cafe Stompers.

In five sessions between May 7 and May 14, 1927, the group recorded at least 12 sides, including &quot;Willie the Weeper,&quot; &quot;Wild Man Blues&quot;, &quot;Twelfth Street Rag&quot; and &quot;Potato Head Blues&quot; (celebrated for Louis Armstrong&#x27;s stop-time solo and triumphant ride-out final chorus). Thomas Brothers cites &quot;Wild Man Blues&quot; as a &quot;breathtaking breakthrough&quot; for Armstrong&#x27;s solo style because of its &quot;effortless flow between melody, embellishment, fill-ins, and breaks.&quot;

In these records, Armstrong continued and further developed his mastery of the jazz solo, almost completely dominating some of the numbers and further breaking down the New Orleans jazz style of collective improvisation into a vehicle for the soloist. In addition to his continued personal development, the Hot Seven sides feature Armstrong&#x27;s new inclination towards worked-out and rehearsed arrangements, which can be heard in &quot;Chicago Breakdown&quot; and &quot;Willie the Weeper.&quot;

The Hot Seven song &quot;Melancholy Blues&quot; is included on the Voyager Golden Record, attached to the &quot;Voyager&quot; spacecraft.

<doc id="502616" wikidata="Q1459231" url="?curid=502616" title="Victor Hugo station">
<text>Victor Hugo () is a station on Paris Métro Line 2. It is named after the author Victor Hugo, and located directly underneath Place Victor Hugo in the 16th arrondissement of Paris.

==Location==
The station, located between the western terminus of Porte Dauphine and the Charles de Gaulle - Étoile station, is located northeast of Place Victor-Hugo, and has a stopping point replacing an old abandoned station, their platforms established at:
* for the old abandoned station, in a marked curve under the square, along the axis of Avenue Bugeaud and Avenue Victor-Hugo;
* for the current station, under Avenue Victor-Hugo, northeast of the original location.

==History==
When first opened in 1900 as part of line 2 Nord, the platforms were built on the tight bend between Avenue Victor Hugo and Avenue Bugeaud. However, when new rolling stocks were introduced in 1931, the curve of the track was too tight for people to board and alight safely on these new trains. So, the station was rebuilt closer to Charles de Gaulle – Étoile (at the time named Étoile) on the straight stretch of track immediately after the curve.

The original station is clearly visible from the end of the platforms, and remains accessible to staff. It still features some of the original flat tiles that were first in use on the network, and have now almost entirely disappeared.

As part of the RATP &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; revival program, the station corridors and platform lighting were renovated on 17 September 2002.

In July 2018, after the France national football team won the 2018 FIFA World Cup, the station was temporarily renamed Victor Hugo Lloris after captain and goalkeeper Hugo Lloris.

In 2019, 3,841,033 travelers entered this station which placed it at the 128th position of metro stations for its usage.

It owes its name to its location under Place Victor-Hugo and Avenue Victor-Hugo, which pay homage to Victor Hugo (1802-1885), French poet, playwright, prose writer, novelist and draftsman, considered to be one of the most important French-language writers.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has two entrances leading to Place Victor-Hugo:
* entrance 1 - &quot;Avenue Victor-Hugo&quot;, consisting of a fixed staircase adorned with a Guimard entrance classified as a historic monument by a decree of 29 May 1978, located northeast of the square, at the angle formed by the eponymous avenue and Rue Léonard-de-Vinci;
* entrance 2 - &quot;Avenue Raymond-Poincaré&quot;, consisting of an ascending escalator allowing only an exit from the platform in the direction of Porte Dauphine, located north of the square, at the corner with Rue Léonard-de- Vinci and Avenue Raymond-Poincaré.

===Station layout===

===Platforms===
Victor Hugo is a standard configuration station. It has two platforms separated by the metro tracks and the vault is elliptical. The decoration is of the style used for most metro stations. The lighting canopies are white and rounded in the &quot;Gaudin&quot; style of the &quot;renouveau du métro des années 2000&quot; revival and, the bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the walls, the vault and the tympans. The advertising frames are in a faience honey color and the name of the station is also in faience, in the style of the original CMP, a unique case on line 2. The seats are in a &quot;Motte&quot; style red. The station is distinguished however by the lower part of its platforms which are vertical and not elliptical, except at the end on the Porte Dauphine side (where the accesses take place), which is located within the very end of the old platforms; it is therefore recognizable by its lower vault and the curvature of the platforms at the level of the tunnel exits.

The wall on the platform towards Nation has a niche fitted out as a small display window dedicated to Victor Hugo. It houses a particular bust in his likeness.

The abandoned old station, also of standard configuration but set in a steep curve, remains clearly visible to the passengers of the trains passing it. It is also possible to see it from the end of the platforms of the current station on the Porte Dauphine side.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by lines 52 and 82 of the RATP Bus Network.

<text>Jesse Franklin (March 24, 1760 – August 31, 1823) was the Democratic-Republican U.S. senator from the U.S. state of North Carolina between 1799 and 1805 and between 1807 and 1813. In 1804, Franklin briefly served as President pro tempore of the United States Senate. He later served as the 20th Governor of North Carolina from 1820 to 1821. Franklin was the brother of Meshack Franklin, who also served in Congress.

==Early life==

Jesse Franklin was born in Orange County in the Colony of Virginia on March 24, 1760. He was the son of Bernard and Mary Franklin, the third of seven sons.

Franklin moved to North Carolina with his father in 1774 and served as a major during the Revolutionary War. During the war he was captured by Tories, but escaped. Franklin was in the Battle of Kings Mountain and served as Adjutant of Colonel Benjamin Cleveland&#x27;s battalion. (Cleveland was a relative of Franklin&#x27;s.) He was also at the Battle of Guilford Court House. He performed further service in partisan warfare against Tories in North Carolina, service that continued to the end of the war.

In Greensboro there is a monument to Revolutionary War soldiers Joseph Winston, Jesse Franklin and Richard Taliaferro, the gift of Governor Thomas M. Holt.

==Early political career and service in Congress==

Franklin was a member of the state legislature in 1793–1794 and 1797–1798. He was elected to the Fourth Congress and served from March 4, 1795 to March 4, 1797. Franklin was then elected as a Democratic-Republican to the United States Senate and served from March 4, 1799 to March 4, 1805. Franklin was put up by the Legislature for re-election in December 1804, but Republicans at the time were divided in their support of him and Federalists did not think highly of him, and he was defeated.

Franklin served as President pro tempore of the Senate during the Eighth Congress. Franklin then served as a state senator in 1805–1806.

In 1806, he was again elected as a Democratic Republican to the United States Senate and served from March 4, 1807 until March 4, 1813. During his second period as a senator, Franklin was known as an advocate of Madison&#x27;s war measures, and as an opponent of monopolies and central banks.

Franklin was appointed a commissioner to negotiate with the Chickasaw Indians near the site of present-day Memphis in 1817, an appointment he accepted at the request of General Andrew Jackson.

==Governor of North Carolina==

Franklin was Governor of North Carolina from 1820 to 1821. During his term as governor, the Canova statue of George Washington was placed at the state Capitol in a new addition containing a rotunda that was considered an appropriate area for displaying it.

As governor, Franklin was considered to be conscientious and practical. He advocated reform in the treatment of criminals, including abolition of ear cropping.

==Death==

Franklin died in Surry County, North Carolina on August 31, 1823. He was interred in Surry County. In 1906, his remains were moved to Guilford Courthouse National Military Park, near Greensboro.

==History==

The station was opened on 7 October 1902 as part of the extension of Line 2 Nord from Étoile to Anvers. It became simply line 2 on 17 October 1907. The name of the street derives from &quot;Villa Externa&quot; (Latin for &quot;external house&quot;), a medieval farm and residence of the Bishop of Paris outside the city, that became the name of the locality, which was originally part of Saint-Denis, then Neuilly, and was finally annexed by Paris in 1860.

The &quot;Barrière des Ternes&quot; was a gate (also known as the &quot;Barrière du Roule&quot;) at the same location built for the collection of taxation as part of the Wall of the Farmers-General; the gate was built between 1784 and 1788 and demolished in 1859.

From the 1950s until 2007, the pedestals were covered with metallic camber with blue horizontal uprights and illuminated golden advertising frames, then completed with &quot;shell&quot; seats characteristic of the &quot;Motte&quot; style, in white.

As part of the RATP &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; program, the station&#x27;s corridors were renovated on 21 December 2001, then around 2008, the platforms renovation lead to the removal of their metalwork.

<text>John Branch Jr. (November 4, 1782January 4, 1863) was an American politician who served as U.S. Senator, Secretary of the Navy, the 19th Governor of the state of North Carolina, and was the sixth and last governor of the Florida Territory.

==Biography==
Branch was born in Halifax County, North Carolina, on November 4, 1782, the son of wealthy landowners. Educated at the University of North Carolina, where he was a member of the Philanthropic Society, he occupied himself as a planter and civic leader. Branch served in the North Carolina Senate from 1811 to 1817 and was the state&#x27;s Governor from 1817 to 1820. After further service in the state Senate, he represented North Carolina in the United States Senate from 1823 until 1829 and was a strong supporter of Andrew Jackson.

When Jackson became President, he selected Branch as his Secretary of the Navy. In that post, Branch promoted several reforms in the Navy&#x27;s policies and administration, many of which were not implemented until years later. He reduced the resources going to the construction of new ships, while increasing those applied to keeping existing vessels in good repair. Branch also sent the frigate USS &quot;Potomac&quot; to the Far East to punish the murderers of a U.S. merchant ship&#x27;s crew and to generally promote and protect American commerce in the region.

John Branch resigned as Secretary in 1831, during the Petticoat affair, which involved the social ostracism of Margaret O&#x27;Neill Eaton, the wife of Secretary of War John H. Eaton by a group of Cabinet members and their wives led by Floride Calhoun, the wife of Vice President John C. Calhoun. Later that year, Branch was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives as a Jacksonian and later to North Carolina state political offices. In the mid-1830s, he moved to Leon County, Florida, where he lived for much of the next decade-and-a-half on his Live Oak Plantation. In 1844, President John Tyler appointed him Florida&#x27;s territorial governor until the 1845 election of a governor under the state constitution. Branch returned to North Carolina in the early 1850s, remaining there until his death on January 4, 1863.

Branch is buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Enfield, North Carolina.

Branch married Eliza Fort (1787–1851) and had 7 children.

Branch was an uncle of the Confederate General Lawrence O&#x27;Bryan Branch. His daughter, Margaret, married Daniel Smith Donelson, the nephew of President Jackson.

<text>Mary Ann Horton (born on November 21, 1955), is a Usenet and Internet pioneer. Horton contributed to Berkeley UNIX (BSD), including the vi editor and terminfo database, created the first email binary attachment tool uuencode, and led the growth of Usenet in the 1980s.

Horton successfully requested the first transgender-inclusive language added to the Equal Employment Policy in a large American company, and championed the language and insurance coverage of transgender health benefits at other companies.

Horton is a computer scientist and a transgender educator and activist.

== Education ==
Horton was born in Richland, Washington, and raised in the Pacific Northwest. Finding an interest in computer programming in 1970, Horton moved to San Diego County in 1971, and quickly fell in love with California. She graduated from San Dieguito High School in 1973. Earning a BSCS from the University of Southern California in 1976, Horton went on to obtain an MSCS at the University of Wisconsin, and transfer to the University of California at Berkeley in 1978, earning a PhD in Computer Science in 1981.

Horton was introduced to UNIX at Wisconsin, creating an enhanced UNIX text editor called hed. At Berkeley, she contributed to the development of Berkeley UNIX, including the vi text editor, uuencode (the first mechanism for binary Email attachments), w and load averages, termcap, and curses. Her PhD dissertation was the creation of a new type of syntax-directed editor with a textual interface. This technology was later used to create computer-aided software engineering tools.

In 1980, Horton brought Usenet&#x27;s A News system to Berkeley and began to champion its growth from a 10-site network. To Usenet&#x27;s original dialup UUCP technology, she added support for Berknet and ARPANET, and added a gateway between several popular ARPANET mailing lists and usenet &quot;fa&quot; newsgroups. In 1981, high school student Matt Glickman asked Horton for a spring break project, and the two designed and implemented B News, which offered major performance and user interface improvements needed to keep up with the explosive growth of Usenet traffic volume.

== UNIX and Internet work ==
In 1981, Horton became a Member of Technical Staff of Bell Labs in Columbus, Ohio. At Bell Labs she brought parts of Berkeley UNIX to UNIX System V, including vi and curses; as part of the work on curses, she developed terminfo as a replacement for termcap (most of this work shipped as part of SVR2). In 1987 she joined the Bell Labs Computation Center to bring official support for Usenet and Email to Bell Labs.

Horton continued to lead Usenet until 1988. During this time she promoted rapid growth by arranging news feeds for new sites. Each new site agreed to be the feed for two more new sites as the need arose. This policy contributed to the growth of Usenet to over 5000 sites by 1987. Horton recruited membership in and designed the original physical topology of the Usenet Backbone in 1983. Gene &quot;Spaf&quot; Spafford then created an email list of the backbone administrators, plus a few influential posters. This list became known as the Backbone Cabal and served as a &quot;political (i.e. decision making) backbone&quot;. The backbone ensured the reliability and performance of the overall network.

Usenet began with only a few messages per day, but volume rapidly grew to become a problem. Horton added moderated newsgroups, distinguished with names beginning with &quot;mod&quot; or containing &quot;announce&quot;, and moderated the first such newsgroup: news.announce.important. Only the moderator could post messages, all other messages were automatically sent to the moderator for approval. Eventually the B News software was enhanced to permit any newsgroup with any name to be moderated.

Usenet relied on email for replies, requiring that Usenet links could be used for email. At first, all Usenet and UUCP messages used &quot;bang paths&quot;, such as unc!research!ucbvax!mark, as email addresses. Horton guided this email process, including the use of the ARPANET/UUCP gateway, using routed email addresses such as cbosgd!mark@berkeley. These addresses were complex, convoluted, and sometimes ambiguous. When Internet domains were first created in 1983, Horton championed their use, publishing the classic paper &quot;What is a domain?&quot;

At Usenix in January 1984, Horton recruited a group of volunteers to create the UUCP Mapping Project. The project divided the world into geographic regions. A volunteer for each region maintained the region&#x27;s UUCP connectivity map and posted it regularly to the comp.mail.maps newsgroup. Each site ran Steve Bellovin and Peter Honeyman&#x27;s pathalias program to create a locally optimized email routing database from this map. Horton worked with Chris Seiwald and Larry Auton to produce the smail program, used this database to route email, using email addresses such as mark@cbosgd.UUCP.

In the mid 1980s, early domain use included .ARPA, .UUCP, .CSNET, and .BITNET as top level domains, representing four major email networks. In January 1986, Horton represented UUCP at a meeting to arrange technical cooperation of these networks. Others were Dan Oberst representing BITNET, Craig Partridge representing CSNET, and Ken Harrenstein, who hosted the meeting on behalf of the ARPANET. Harrenstein convinced the others to support the creation of six top level functionally domains COM, EDU, ORG, NET, GOV, and MIL. Each network was authorized to register domains in COM, EDU, ORG, and NET. This group of registrars was the precursor to the ICANN domain name registry.

Horton implemented the UUCP portion of the registry by reorganizing the UUCP Project into the &quot;UUCP Zone&quot;. With Tim Thompson, Horton registered 150 UUCP-only organizations with officially sanctioned .COM and .EDU domains. mark@stargate.com became a valid UUCP email address, even though the message was delivered via UUCP using dial-up modems.

The UUCP Zone joined with Lauren Weinstein&#x27;s Stargate project, which built a pilot project to transmit Usenet over satellite television, to form Stargate Information Systems. The first domain they registered was stargate.com, the second was Horton&#x27;s employer, att.com. The att.com domain connected to the Internet using dial-up modems until 1990, when Horton implemented Bill Cheswick&#x27;s firewall architecture
to build AT&amp;T&#x27;s first TCP/IP connection to the Internet with a demonstrably secure firewall.

Horton&#x27;s 1990 book, &quot;Portable C Software&quot; became a popular reference for programming in C. It outlined functions and programming techniques that could be reliably used on many different types of computer systems, and which methods were unportable.

In 1992, Horton created an internal email package for Bell Labs called EMS (Electronic Messaging System). This package integrated the existing UUCP-based email system with the AT&amp;T &quot;POST&quot; white pages directory and the domain-based email world. She created and led a supported email service for Bell Labs. This system supported many email addressing formats, including those that dynamically queried the POST directory: 
* Handle: mark@att.com
* Full name: Mark.R.Horton@att.com
* Broadcast to a building: loc=oh0012/all=yes@att.com
* Complex query: all technical managers and directors in Columbus: loc=oh0012/tl=tmgr/tl=dir/all=yes@att.com

In 2000, Horton joined Avaya, where she was the Sr. Manager of Avaya Corporate Email and Directory. In 2002, Horton joined the UNIX Implementation Engineering group at Bank One, which was purchased by JPMorgan Chase in 2004. Finally fulfilling a lifelong dream, Horton moved from Columbus to San Diego in 2007, joining Sempra Energy&#x27;s Transmission Grid Operations team.

== Diversity work ==

Horton is a transgender woman. Adopting the name Mary Ann in 1987, Horton founded Columbus&#x27; first transgender support group, the Crystal Club, in 1989. In 1997, she joined EQUAL, Lucent&#x27;s LGBT employee resource group, and saw the value of being &quot;out&quot; at work, supported by an Equal Opportunity (EO) nondiscrimination policy. At the time, no major company included transgender language in their EO policy. Horton asked for its inclusion in Lucent&#x27;s policy, and recommended the language &quot;gender identity, characteristics, or expression&quot;. As a result, Lucent became the first large company to add transgender-inclusive language to its EO policy in October, 1997.

At the time, Horton identified as a crossdresser, presenting sometimes as Mark and sometimes as Mary Ann. After the Lucent EO policy was published, Horton worked at Lucent primarily as Mark, but occasionally as Mary Ann. She was the first known crossdresser to successfully work part-time as a woman for a large company. Despite controversy about the ability of corporate America to deal with a part-time crossdresser, Horton&#x27;s workplace experience was positive.

Horton championed the addition of transgender-inclusive language with other companies, supporting its addition to Apple, Xerox, Chase, and later to Bank One and Sempra Energy. The &quot;characteristics&quot; term was intended to include intersex individuals, but was removed after discussions with intersex activists who stated that &quot;gender expression&quot; best includes their needs.

Horton was one of the first transgender actors to play a transgender role on television. She appeared as Aurora, a business executive, in a public service announcement advertisement for Stonewall Columbus entitled The Boardroom in June 2003.

Horton was awarded the &quot;Trailblazer&quot; award by Out &amp; Equal Workplace Advocates in October, 2001 for her work at Lucent and Avaya. The next week, she transitioned, presenting full-time as Mary Ann. Over the next few years, she took appropriate medical steps, and legally changed her name to Mary Ann Horton and her sex to female.

In the 1990s, most employer health insurance policies denied coverage for sex reassignment surgery (SRS) or anything related to it. Horton advocated for the inclusion of transgender health benefits (THBs) in these policies. She documented Lucent&#x27;s coverage of SRS in 2000.
and championed the inclusion of points for THBs in the Human Rights Campaign&#x27;s Corporate Equality Index, which were added in 2005.

In 2002, Horton gathered data from 13 of 15 major SRS surgeons to determine incidence, intrinsic prevalence,
and average cost of SRS-related surgeries. This data, presented at the
Out &amp; Equal Annual Workplace Summit
showed that the cost of THB coverage, previously believed to be very high, is actually very low, less than 40 cents per US resident per year. This data, combined with the HRC CEI points, has led to increased coverage of THBs by large employers.

On October 28, 2022, the 25th anniversary of Lucent&#x27;s nondiscrimination policy, Horton released a memoir, &quot;Trailblazer: Lighting the Path for Transgender Equality in Corporate America&quot; recounting her life as a transgender woman and as a trans activist. 

== Current status ==
Horton currently resides in Poway, California.

Horton is retired from Sempra Energy as a Principal EMS Programmer/Analyst. (In this case, EMS stands for energy management system, a SCADA control system.)

Horton is also a Consultant on Transgender Workplace issues and on UNIX and Internet technology. She owns Red Ace Technology Solutions, providing discounted web hosting services to nonprofit organizations and small businesses.

<doc id="502633" wikidata="Q1783272" url="?curid=502633" title="Counterparty">
<text>A counterparty (sometimes contraparty) is a legal entity, unincorporated entity, or collection of entities to which an exposure of financial risk may exist. The word became widely used in the 1980s, particularly at the time of the Basel I deliberations in 1988.

Well-drafted contracts usually attempt to spell out in explicit detail what each counterparty&#x27;s rights and obligations are in every conceivable circumstance, though there are limits. There are general provisions for how counterparties are treated under the law, and (at least in common law legal systems) there are many legal precedents that shape the common law.

==Financial services sector==
Within the financial services sector, the term market counterparty is used to refer to governments, public banks, national monetary authorities and international monetary organisations such as the World Bank Group that act as the ultimate guarantor for loans and indemnities. The term may also be applied, in a more general sense, to companies acting in this role.

Also within financial services, counterparty can refer to brokers, investment banks, and other securities dealers that serve as the contracting party when completing &quot;over the counter&quot; securities transactions. The term is generally used in this context in relation to &quot;counterparty risk&quot;, which is the risk of monetary loss a firm may be exposed to if the counterparty to an over-the-counter securities trade encounters difficulty meeting its obligations under the terms of the transaction.

==Insurance sector==
Within the insurance sector, this term is extended to include companies offering or requiring high-level retrocession of insurance risk to insurance companies in a role similar to that offered by governments. This term, over time, has become more generally applied to companies offering or requiring retrocession and other forms of reinsurance.

<doc id="502634" wikidata="Q1717241" url="?curid=502634" title="Monceau station">
<text>Monceau () is a station on Paris Métro Line 2 near the Parc Monceau on the border of the 8th and 17th arrondissement of Paris.

==Location==
The station is located under the Boulevard de Courcelles at the Place de la République-Dominican, on the edge of the Parc Monceau. Oriented approximately along an east–west axis, it intersects between Courcelles and Villiers stations.

==History==

The station was opened on 7 October 1902 as part of the extension of line 2 Nord from Étoile to Anvers and became simply line 2 on 17 October 1907. The station and the park derive their name from a village in this area that was annexed by Paris in 1860. The &quot;Barrière de Chartres&quot;, a gate built in 1790 for the collection of taxation as part of the Wall of the Farmers-General, was at the same location. The Monceau park of the same name is an acquisition of Philippe d&#x27;Orléans in 1778.

Close to &quot;Parc Monceau&quot; is the Musée Cernuschi (Asian art music) and the Musée Nissim de Camondo (museum of furniture and other household furnishings), and Musée national Jean-Jacques Henner (dedicated to the works of painter Jean-Jacques Henner).

As part of the RATP &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; program, the station corridors and platform lighting were renovated on 20 March 2002.

On 1 April 2016, half of the nameplates on the station&#x27;s platforms were replaced by the RATP to produce an April Fool for a day, as in twelve other stations. Monceau is humorously renamed &quot;Ma pelle&quot;.

In 2019, 1,672,269 travelers entered this station which placed it at 269th position for the metro stations for its usage out of 303.
==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has a single entrance named &quot;Place de la République-Dominicaine&quot;, leading to the south sidewalk of Boulevard de Courcelles near the &quot;Barrière de la Rotonde de Chartres&quot;, which marks the entrance to Parc Monceau on the said square. Made up of a fixed staircase, it is adorned with a Guimard entrance, which was the subject of a decree as a historic monument on 12 February 2016.

===Station layout===
===Platforms===
Monceau is a standard configuration station. It has two platforms separated by the metro tracks and the vault is elliptical. The decoration is of the style used for most metro stations. The lighting canopies are white and rounded in the &quot;Gaudin&quot; style of the &quot;renouveau du métro des années 2000&quot; revival, and the bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the walls, the vault and the tunnel exits. The advertising frames are metallic and the name of the station is written in Parisine font on enameled plates. The &quot;shell&quot; seats, in a green color, are typical of the &quot;Motte&quot; style.

===Bus services===
The station is served by line 30 of the RATP Bus Network.

<text>Villiers () is a station on Line 2 and Line 3 of the Paris Métro. It is located on the border of the 8th and 17th arrondissement of Paris.

==Location==
The station is located under Place Prosper-Goubaux, at the start of Avenue de Villiers. The platforms for the two lines are placed side by side and approximately oriented east–west, along the axis of Boulevard de Courcelles.

==History==
It is named after the &quot;Avenue de Villiers&quot;, which once led to the 18th century village of &quot;Villiers-la-Garenne&quot;, now part of Levallois-Perret. The &quot;Barrière de Monceau&quot;, a gate built for the collection of taxation as part of the Wall of the Farmers-General was at the same location; the gate was built between 1784 and 1788 and demolished after 1859.

The Line 2 platforms opened on 21 January 1903, although trains had been operating between Étoile and Anvers since 7 October 1902. On 19 October 1904, it became the terminus for the first section of line 3, the other terminus being Père Lachaise. When first built, the platforms for line 3 were parallel and at the same height as those for line 2. However, for the extension to Porte de Champerret, the line 3 platforms and tracks had to be lowered in order for trains to be able to pass underneath the line 2 tracks.

The painter Édouard Vuillard produced a sketch of this station in 1916.

Since the 1950s and until 2008, the pillar of the two stopping areas were covered with metallic body with blue horizontal uprights and illuminated golden advertising frames. This arrangement was then supplemented with &quot;shell&quot; seats characteristic of the &quot;Motte&quot; style, blue in color.

As part of the RATP&#x27;s &quot;Metro Renewal&quot; program, the station&#x27;s corridors were renovated on 27 May 2005, then its platforms in 2009, leading to the removal of their bodywork.

It saw 6,237,308 travelers enter in the station 2018, which places it at the 60th position of the metro stations for its frequency.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has three entrances:
* Access 1: Avenue de Villiers: a fixed staircase decorated with a mast with a yellow &quot;M&quot; inscribed in a circle, leading to the right of no. 2 Boulevard de Courcelles, at the corner with Avenue de Villiers;
* Access 2: Boulevard des Batignolles: an escalator going up allowing only an exit, situated in front of no. 5 of Boulevard de Courcelles;
* Access 3: Boulevard de Courcelles - Parc de Monceau: a fixed staircase decorated with a Guimard entrance listed as a historic monument by a decree on 29 May 1978, located at the right of nos. 25 and 27 of the same boulevard.

===Station layout===
The station has three exits.


===Platforms===
The platforms of the two lines are of standard configuration. Two in number per stopping point, they are separated by the metro tracks located in the center and the vault is elliptical. The station on line 3, however, has a ceiling height much higher than normal (see above) and vertical walls as a result. The decoration is of the style used for most metro stations in both cases: the lighting strips are white and rounded in the &quot;Gaudin&quot; style for the metro revival in the 2000s, and the bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the walls, tunnel exits, vault and openings in the corridors. The advertising frames are in white ceramic and the name of the station is written in Parisine font on enameled plates. The seats are &quot;Akiko&quot; style, blue on line 2 and cyan on line 3.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by line 30 of the RATP Bus Network and is approximately 200 meters from the Malesherbes-Courcelles stop located on Boulevard Malesherbes, served by lines 20 and 93 of the same network. At night, it is served by lines N16 and N52 of the Noctilien network.

<text>William Miller (September 10, 1825) was the 18th Governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina from 1814 to 1817.

Born in Warren County, North Carolina, William Miller was orphaned at the age of 9 and inherited a substantial plantation. He briefly attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1802, but did not complete a degree. He began practicing law in 1805 and was named North Carolina Attorney General in 1810. That same year, he was elected to the North Carolina House of Commons, where he served until 1814, for two years as Speaker of the House (1812–1814).

In November 1814, Miller was elected Governor of North Carolina by the General Assembly, at the close of the War of 1812, which he supported. During his term, Miller laid the groundwork for the expansion of the state&#x27;s educational system, and he served on the University of North Carolina Board of Trustees until his death.

After serving the maximum number of three one-year terms as governor, Miller left office in 1817. He returned to the North Carolina Senate in 1821, but lost a re-election bid the following year.

U.S. President John Quincy Adams appointed Miller as an envoy to Guatemala in 1825; Miller died after three days illness in Key West, Florida en route to his post.

<doc id="502641" wikidata="Q336790" url="?curid=502641" title="John Taylor, Baron Taylor of Warwick">
<text>John David Beckett Taylor, Baron Taylor of Warwick (born 1952) is a member of the House of Lords in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. In 1996, at the age of 44, he became one of the youngest people in the upper house.

Taylor is the third person of Afro-Caribbean ancestry to enter the House of Lords. He initially practised as a barrister, and served as a part-time deputy district judge (magistrates&#x27; courts). Taylor was also served as the Vice President of British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) from 1998-2008, during he tenure, the profitability had grown from £33,000 to £8,200,000. He has also been a company director and television and radio presenter.

Taylor is a Christian, and has volunteered time for various charities including Kidscape, Parents for Children, SCAR (Sickle Cell Anemia Relief), Variety Club Children&#x27;s Charity of Great Britain, Warwick Leadership Foundation and WISCA (West Indian Senior Citizens&#x27; Association).

==Early life==
Taylor was born on 21 September 1952 in Birmingham, England, to Jamaican immigrants: his father, Derief Taylor, was a professional cricketer and coach for Warwickshire, and his mother, Enid, was a nurse. Taylor attended Moseley Grammar School in Birmingham where he was head boy, and later attended Keele University, where he studied English Literature and Law, followed by the Inns of Court School of Law in London.

==Career==

===Legal===
Taylor was called to the bar in 1978, by Gray&#x27;s Inn, where he was also awarded the Gray&#x27;s Inn Advocacy Award, and Norman Tapp Memorial Prize for excellence in mooting. Taylor undertook his pupillage at 1 Dr Johnson&#x27;s Buildings, and then joined the same chambers as the future Justice Secretary, Ken Clarke. Taylor practised from there on the Midland &amp; Oxford Circuit. In 1997, Taylor was appointed as a part-time district judge (Magistrates&#x27; Court). 

===Political===
In the 1980s, Taylor was elected to Solihull Council for the safe Conservative Party ward of St Alphege at a by-election in 1985 and was re-elected for a 4-year term in May 1988. He contested Birmingham Perry Barr for the Conservative Party at the 1987 general election, losing by 6,933 votes. He was selected by Conservative Party&#x27;s Central Office to become the Conservative candidate for Cheltenham at the 1992 general election. The campaign was seen as having been influenced by race, with Taylor&#x27;s Caribbean background reportedly causing concern to some members of the local Conservative Party constituency association, which was split by the issue. Conservative Central Office expelled association members over the issue. John Major, then Prime Minister, campaigned for Taylor in Cheltenham, but he lost the seat to Nigel Jones of the Liberal Democrats by 1,668 votes, the first time since 1950 Cheltenham had not voted for a Conservative candidate and the first time since December 1910 it had voted for a Liberal-aligned candidate.

Taylor was made a life peer as Baron Taylor of Warwick, &quot;of Warwick in the County of Warwickshire&quot; on 2 October 1996, on the recommendation of Prime Minister John Major. At 44, he became one of the youngest life peers to sit in the House of Lords at the time.

=== Other activities ===
In 2016, he appeared on the Fox News channel to discuss the potential impact of Britain leaving the European Union (Brexit).

Other positions Taylor has held include:
* Television Presenter, &quot;Crime Stalker&quot; (Carlton Television); &quot;Talk About&quot; (BBC One); &quot;&quot;Powerhouse&quot;&quot; (Channel 4)
* Non-executive Director, Currencies Direct Ltd (resigned July 2010); Mottram Holdings PLC
* Consultant, Kleinwort Benson Bank
* Chancellor, Bournemouth University, 2001–2006.
* Vice President, National Small Business Bureau; British Board of Film Classification, 1998–2008.
* Member of the International Trade Council.
* Special Adviser to the Home Secretary and Home Office Ministers, 1990–1991.
* Founder of the Warwick Leadership Academy (2014 to present) providing services to young people.

==Parliamentary expenses scandal==

In early 2009, a major political scandal was triggered by the leaking and subsequent publication of expense claims made by members of the United Kingdom Parliament. 

Several hundred members of the House of Commons and House of Lords were involved in the expenses scandal, However, only two peers—Taylor and Lord Hanningfield— were charged and convicted. Critics have noted disparities in the handling of these cases, highlighting that other peers, such as Baroness Uddin, avoided prosecution despite being ordered to repay larger sums. Baroness Uddin was investigated for allegedly claiming at least £180,000 in expenses by designating an empty flat as her main residence. She was suspended from the House of Lords until the end of 2012 and ordered to repay £125,349. ￼

Taylor&#x27;s defence in the Crown Court was that on appointment to the House of Lords he had asked other peers for advice on expenses and allowances and that he was told that the overnight subsistence allowance, the office allowance, and the travel expenses were provided in lieu of a salary, as well as the daily attendance allowance. As a result of claiming for the cost of journeys he had not made, and the cost of accommodation he had not occupied, Taylor was convicted of six counts of false accounting.

In his summing up to the jury, Mr Justice Saunders observed that Taylor was a man of good character who had devoted a lot of time to helping others. The judge imposed a sentence of 12 months&#x27; imprisonment;said that the expenses scandal had &quot;left an indelible stain on Parliament&quot;. Taylor’s defense was further weakened by the refusal of 15 members of the House of Lords to testify on his behold.On 16 July 2010, Taylor resigned the Conservative Party Whip.

==Personal life==
Taylor married in 1981 and had three children with his wife. They divorced in 2005. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that Taylor is an evangelical Christian, and in 2009 he married an evangelical Christian from the US. That marriage lasted 24 days and was annulled in 2010. He remarried in 2015.

<text>Rome () is a station on Line 2 of the Paris Métro. It is located on the border of the 8th and 17th arrondissement.

==Location==
The station is located under the central reservation of Boulevard des Batignolles, east bridge crossing the tracks to Gare Saint-Lazare. Oriented approximately along an east–west axis, it is located between Villiers and Place de Clichy stations.

==History==
The station was opened on 7 October 1902 as part of the extension of line 2 from Étoile to Anvers. The name is that of one of several streets in the area named for European capitals, in this case Rue de Rome, capital of Italy. Some of these streets having also given their patronym to the stations such as Europe on line 3 and Liège on the line 13. Rome metro station is also, with Iéna on line 9, Cité on line 4 as well as the closed station Haxo between lines 3a and 7a, one of four in the network whose name has only four letters.

As part of the RATP&#x27;s &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; program, the station was renovated on 5 November 2001.

On 9 October 2019, half of the nameplates on the station&#x27;s platforms are temporarily replaced by the RATP in order to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Astérix and Obélix, as in eleven other stations. Taking up in particular the typography characteristic of the comics of René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo, Rome is humorously renamed &quot;Ils sont fous ces Romains!&quot; (They are crazy these Romans!) from the recurring phrase from Obélix. In addition, all of the advertising posters are also replaced by sketches from the famous comic strip.

In 2019, 2,753,714 travelers entered this station which placed it at 193rd position of the metro stations for its usage out of 303.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has a single access entitled &quot;Boulevard des Batignolles&quot;, leading to the central reservation of this boulevard facing no. 60. Consisting of a fixed staircase, it is adorned with a Guimard entrance, which was registered as historic monuments by the decree of 12 February 2016.

===Station layout===


===Platforms===
Rome is a standard configuration station. It has two platforms separated by metro tracks. The platform is established flush with the walls, directly under the road, with the passage of line 2 above the railway tracks of Gare Saint-Lazare (west of the stopping point) did not allow digging at depth. The ceiling thus consists of a metal deck, whose beams, silver in colour, are supported by vertical walls. This ceiling is pierced in the centre with a well allowing direct daylight to enter the station. The bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the wall, and the tunnel exits. The advertising frames are metallic, and the name of the station is written in the Parisine font on enamelled plates. The seats are a red &quot;Motte&quot; style. The lighting is semi-direct, projected on the sides and the first row of vaults.

===Bus services===
The station is served by lines 30, 66 and 94 of the RATP Bus Network.

==Nearby==
Nearby are the town hall of the 17th arrondissement and the Institut Universitaire de Formation des Maîtres (teachers&#x27; college).

<text>The Koenigsegg CC8S is a mid-engine sports car produced by the Swedish automobile manufacturer Koenigsegg. It was the company&#x27;s first production automobile and the first production car to use the company&#x27;s trademark dihedral synchro-helix actuation doors. At its introduction, it won several awards, including the Guinness World Record for the Most Powerful Production Engine and design awards from both Red Dot in Germany and Utmärkt Svensk Form in Sweden.

==Development==
The CC8S was developed from the CC prototype. It was the culmination of 8 years of research and development. Despite limited resources, the chassis, suspension, brakes, and several other components were designed in-house by Koenigsegg. The pre-production car was shown at the 2000 Paris Auto Show, the public&#x27;s reaction to the car was favourable and international contacts were made. The car had many unique functions such as the roof, which could be stored in the car&#x27;s trunk located in the front similar to how a Chevrolet Corvette stores its roof (other Targa top sports cars of the time such as the Ferrari F50 lacked this feature), vertical opening doors dubbed dihedral synchro-helix actuation doors and a central patented free-flowing exhaust system based on the &#x27;Rocket Cat Principle&#x27;. These unique features and design received great praise from the spectators, despite large orders, only 6 cars were produced due to high production costs out of which, 2 were right-hand drive. The CC8S was replaced by the more powerful CCR model in 2004.

==Overview==
===Body===

The body is a two-door, two-seat targa top design, meaning a portion of the roof can be removed and stored under the bonnet. The chassis is made from kevlar-reinforced carbon fibre. The kevlar-reinforced carbon fibre semi-monocoque is attached to a steel subframe at the front of the chassis, and an aluminium subframe at the rear.

The engine, transmission, and rear suspension are mounted to the aluminium subframe. All body panels are made from carbon fibre, and venturi tunnels and diffusers occupy the bottom of the car. These components increase downforce in conjunction with a rear-mounted spoiler. The frontal area of the car is just , which, in conjunction with the car&#x27;s low , affords the car very low overall aerodynamic drag.

===Engine and Transmission===
The CC8S is powered by a supercharged Ford Modular 4.6–litre DOHC V8 engine made of cast aluminium with 4 valves per cylinder and carbon fibre covers weighing , with a compression ratio of 8.6:1. It produces at 6,800 rpm and of torque at 5,000 rpm. The redline is set to 7,250 rpm. The engine powers the rear wheels through a 6-speed manual transmission specially developed for the car by CIMA.

===Wheels===
The CC8S uses magnesium alloy wheels with center-locking hubs, to which 225/40ZR 18&quot; front and 335/40ZR 20&quot; rear Michelin Pilot Sport 2 tyres are mounted. The brake discs are cross-drilled for increased ventilation, and measure at the front and at the rear. The brake calipers contain 6 pistons in front and 4 pistons at the rear. The brakes are power-assisted by the Koenigsegg Advanced Control System.

===Performance===
Manufacturer estimates
* Acceleration: under 3.5 seconds
* Top speed: 
* Standing : 10 seconds, trap speed 
* Braking distance:

<text>William Hawkins (October 10, 1777May 17, 1819) was the 17th governor of North Carolina from 1811 to 1814.

==Early life and education==
William Hawkins was born at his family plantation, called Pleasant Hill, in what is today Vance County, North Carolina; he was one of twelve children born by his mother Lucy Davis Hawkins. His father, Philemon Hawkins III, was a planter and member of the North Carolina General Assembly. As a young man, Hawkins studied law in North Carolina under Judge John Williams and at Princeton University.

==Career==
Hawkins worked for two years in Georgia with the Creek people as an Indian agent under his uncle, Benjamin Hawkins, US Supervisor of Southeast Indian tribes. After that, he returned to North Carolina to practice law. In 1801, he was assigned by Gov. James Turner to settle a dispute and arrange a settlement with those Tuscarora Indians remaining in Bertie County, North Carolina. (The great majority of the tribe had migrated to New York state by 1722, where they settled with the Oneida people of the Iroquois Confederacy.) 

In 1804, Hawkins was elected to the North Carolina House of Commons from Warren County and served a single term. In 1809, he was elected as a representative from Granville County; he served until 1811. From 1810 to 1811, he was Speaker of the House.

In December 1811, Hawkins was elected as Governor of North Carolina by the General Assembly. He served the constitutional limit of three terms, which coincided with the duration of the War of 1812 through 1814. During the war, he supported the military efforts of the federal government and assisted in raising a volunteer militia of 7,000 troops.

Hawkins retired from politics after the end of his term as governor, except for one term in the House of Commons in 1817. He died in 1819 and is buried in Sparta, Georgia.

==Personal life==
After getting started at work, Hawkins in 1803 married Anne Swepson Boyd of Mecklenburg County, Virginia. They had six children together.

<doc id="502646" wikidata="Q3387769" url="?curid=502646" title="Magnetes">
<text>The Magnetes (Greek: ) were an ancient Greek tribe. In book 2 of the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Homer includes them in the Greek Army that is besieging Troy, and identifies their homeland in Thessaly, in a part that is still known as Magnesia. Later, they participated in the Greek colonisation of Western Anatolia by founding two prosperous cities: Magnesia on the Maeander and Magnesia ad Sipylum.

==Mythology==
According to the Hesiodic &quot;Catalogue of Women&quot; ( 7), Thyia, a daughter of Deucalion, lay with Zeus and bore two sons: Magnes and Makednos, the eponyms of the Magnetes and Macedones, respectively. Within Thyia&#x27;s extended family in the &quot;Catalogue&quot; are found the progenitors of several of the other early Greek tribes. Her sister Pandora II (named after her grandmother, the famous Pandora) bore Graecus (also to Zeus). And their brother Hellen, along with his three sons Dorus, Xuthus (with his sons Ion and Achaeus) and Aeolos, filled out the set of progenitors of the ancient tribes that formed the Greek/Hellenic nation.

<doc id="502649" wikidata="Q610012" url="?curid=502649" title="Place de Clichy station">
<text>Place de Clichy () is a station of the Paris Métro, serving Paris Metro Line 2 and Line 13 at the junction of the 8th and 17th arrondissement of Paris.

==Location==
The station is located under Place de Clichy, the platforms being situated:

* on line 2, northeast of the square and oriented northeast–southwest along the axis of the end of Boulevard de Clichy (between Rome and Blanche stations);
* on line 13, north of the square and approximately north–south, along the axis of the start of Avenue de Clichy (between La Fourche and Liège).

==History==
The station was opened on 7 October 1902 as part of the extension of line 2 from Étoile to Anvers. The Place was named after the &quot;Barrière de Clichy&quot;, a gate built on the road to the village of Clichy for the collection of taxation as part of the Wall of the Farmers-General; the gate was built between 1784 and 1788 and demolished in the 19th century.

The line 13 platforms opened on 26 February 1911 as part of the Nord-Sud Company&#x27;s line B from Saint-Lazare to Porte de Saint-Ouen. On 27 March 1931 line B became line 13 of the &quot;Métro&quot; following the absorption of the Nord-Sud Company on 1 January 1930 by its competing company, CMP. Like a third of the stations on the network between 1974 and 1984, the platforms on line 2 were modernized in &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style, in this case blue. In 1994, these platforms were restored with heritage green bordered tiled names on the platforms.

As part of the action plan voted on in 2010, to improve the regularity of line 13 that was chronically saturated, its platforms were equipped with platform doors from April to May 2012, as were eleven other stations on this line.

As part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; program, the station is undergoing renovations from 22 January 2018 to 21 January 2020.

On 9 October 2019, half of the nameplates on the platforms of line 2 were temporarily replaced by the RATP in order to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Astérix and Obélix, as in eleven other stations. Taking up in particular the typography characteristic of the comics of René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo, Place de Clichy is humorously renamed &quot;PlaceDeClichix&quot; in reference to the names of the Gauls based on word games and ending with &quot;-ix&quot;.

In 2019, 8,020,440 travelers entered this station which placed it in 28th position of metro stations for its usage.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has three entrances:
* access 1 - &quot;Place de Clichy&quot;, consisting of a fixed staircase, adorned with a Guimard entrance and decreed as a historic monuments on 12 February 2016, leading to the east of the square opposite no. 14, on the central reservation on Boulevard de Clichy;
* access 2 - &quot;Rue Biot&quot;, consisting of a fixed staircase lined with an ascending escalator and adorned with a balustrade in the characteristic Nord-Sud style, located north-west of the square to the right of the no. 7;
* access 3 - &quot;Rue Caulaincourt&quot;, consisting of a fixed staircase adorned with a kiosk designed by Hector Guimard in 1900 and classified as a historic monument, located on the central reservation of Boulevard de Clichy, opposite the Lycée Jules-Ferry at no. 77.

===Station layout===
===Platforms===
The platforms of the two lines, 75 meters long, are of a standard configuration. Two in number per stopping point, they are separated by the metro tracks located in the centre and the vault is elliptical.

The station on line 2 is furnished in &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style with a blue light canopies, tunnel exits and corridor openings are in flat blue tiles with blue &quot;Motte&quot; style seats. These fittings are combined with the bevelled white ceramic tiles that cover the vault and the walls. The advertising frames are metallic, and the name of the station is written in capital letters or in the Parisine font on enamelled plates.

The station on line 13 has a semi-elliptical arch, a form specific to the old Nord-Sud stations. The tiles and ceramics are the original Nord-Sud decorative style with advertising frames and nameplates of the station are in a green colour, green geometric designs on the walls and the vault, the name inscribed in white earthenware on a blue background of small size above the advertising frames and very large between these frames, as well as the directions incorporated into the ceramic tile on the tympans. The bevelled white earthenware tiles cover the walls, the vault, and the tunnel exits. The lighting canopies are suspended and semi-independent tubes. The platforms are equipped with landing doors and have no seats due to the usual heavy crowds.

Furthermore, it is the only station on the network where music, in this case classical music, is broadcast, with no official reason for this exception.

===Bus services===
The station is served by lines 21, 30, 54, 68, 74, 80 and 95 of the RATP Bus Network and, at night, by lines N01, N02, N15 and N51 of the Noctilien network

<text>Benjamin Smith (January 10, 1756 – January 26, 1826) was the 16th governor of North Carolina from 1810 to 1811.

== Early life ==
Smith was born in Charles Town, South Carolina into a socially prominent family, later moving to Brunswick County, North Carolina. His parents were Thomas Smith and Sarah Moore Smith. During the American Revolutionary War, Smith served an aide-de-camp to General George Washington and rose to the rank of colonel in the Continental Army.

== Political career ==
In 1784, Smith was elected to the Continental Congress, although it is unclear whether he actually served. He was active in the North Carolina Constitutional Conventions of 1788 and 1789, and served a number of terms in the North Carolina General Assembly, in 1783 (Senate), 1789–1792 (House of Commons), 1792–1800 (Senate), 1801 (House of Commons) 1804–1805 (House of Commons) and 1806–1810 (Senate). From 1795 to 1799, Smith was the Speaker of the North Carolina Senate, and in 1798 he was the Federalist nominee for the U.S. Senate, losing to Jesse Franklin. During his political career, Smith also sat on the Board of Trustees of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and donated 20,000 acres (81 km2) of land for the university&#x27;s endowment; he chaired the trustees during his term as governor. As of 1789, he owned 221 slaves.

In 1810, aligned with the Democratic-Republican Party (he had earlier had Federalist leanings), Smith was elected governor by the North Carolina General Assembly. He served only a single one-year term, and emphasized reform of the state&#x27;s criminal code and penitentiary system. Although Smith did seek re-election to the governor&#x27;s seat in 1811, he polled behind William Hawkins on the first ballot and withdrew himself from consideration. He later returned to the North Carolina Senate in 1816.

== Death ==
Smith died in Smithville, North Carolina in 1826 and is buried at the St. Philip&#x27;s Church near Wilmington.

== Honors ==
Smithville (present day Southport), North Carolina, was named after him.

<text>Octavian Goga (; 1 April 1881 – 7 May 1938) was a Romanian far-right politician, poet, playwright, journalist, and translator.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Octavian Goga was born on 1 April 1881 in the village of Rășinari, on the northern slopes of the Southern Carpathians, in the house at 778 Ulița Popilor, the son of the Orthodox priest Iosif Goga and Aurelia, a teacher (and a collaborator in his youth at the newspaper &quot;Telegraful Român&quot; and the magazine &quot;Familia&quot;). Between 1886 and 1890 Goga attended primary school in his native village, having Moise Frățilă, a patriotic intellectual and the possible character in the poem &quot;Dascălul&quot;, as his sister Victoria, who died early, was the character in &quot;Dăscălița&quot;.

Most of his holidays, as he recounts in various autobiographical texts, were spent in his father&#x27;s native village, Crăciunelu de Sus, Alba County, on the Târnava Mică, now part of the commune of Cetatea de Baltă, where about 20% of the families in the village bear the name Goga. The poet said: &quot;The life of the peasants on the &quot;delnițele Crăciunelului&quot; was my inspiration for &quot;Plugarii &amp; Clăcașii&quot;.

In 1890 the poet enrolled at the state high school in Sibiu (today the Gheorghe Lazăr National College), which he attended until 1899, when he transferred to the Romanian high school in Brașov (today the Andrei Șaguna National College). After graduating from high school in 1900, he enrolled at the Faculty of Letters and Philosophy of the University of Budapest, continuing his studies in Berlin and completing them in 1904.

On 14 October 1906 he married Hortensia Cosma, the youngest daughter of the politician and banker Partenie Cosma, director of the Albina Bank in Sibiu, one of the wealthiest Romanians in Transylvania. The ceremony took place at the Metropolitan Cathedral in Sibiu, with Alexandrina and Alexandru Vlahuță as godparents. The marriage broke up after 14 years, when Goga fell in love with the singer Veturia Triteanu, born Mureșan, whom he married in January 1921.

Goga was a member of the in Paris.

=== Debut in journalism ===
In the issue of 12–24 December (no. 275, p. 1098) the newspaper &quot;Tribuna&quot; (Sibiu) published his first poem, &quot;Atunci și acum&quot;, signed &quot;Tavi&quot;. Ion Pop-Reteganul from the &quot;Revista Ilustrată&quot; (Bistrița) wrote to him at the editorial office: &quot;You have talent, young friend, cultivate it with diligence, for you can become great. The good day in the morning shows itself. Don&#x27;t neglect your student duties.&quot; After this encouragement, the poem &quot;Nu-i fericire pe pământ&quot; is published on half a page. Goga, a student at the Hungarian-language high school in Sibiu, had not yet turned seventeen.

The following poems he published in Iosif Vulcan&#x27;s &quot;Revista Familia&quot; (Oradea, year XXXIV, 1898, no. 44, p. 13, November) and in the newspapers &quot;Tribuna and Luceafărul&quot; (no. 11, 1 December 1902, no. 14 - 15, 1 August 1903) were signed, above all, also &quot;Octavian&quot; and then &quot;Nic. Otavă&quot;. It was not until 15 September 1903 that he signed his first poem (Sfârșit de septembrie) in &quot;Luceafărul&quot; under the name &quot;Octavian Goga&quot;.

On July 1, 1902, &quot;Luceafărul&quot;, a publication for national culture and political unity of the Romanians in Transylvania, appeared in Budapest, where Goga published most of his poems. The founding of the magazine was due to the Romanian students who were active in Budapest within the &quot;Petru Maior&quot; Society: Alexandru Ciura, the author of the article &quot;In lieu de programme&quot; in the first issue, and Goga, who said in 1933 that the title of the magazine &quot;was related to the state of mind and literary consciousness of those times&quot;. Most of Goga&#x27;s works included in the volume &quot;Poezii&quot; (1905) appeared in the magazine &quot;Luceafărul&quot;, in whose pages the poet established himself as a genuine literary talent.

In 1904 the well-known poem Oltul appeared in &quot;Luceafărul&quot; (year III, no. 4, February 15, p. 91–92), then in no. 7, April 10, p. 151, the poem &quot;Dăscălița&quot;, signed &quot;Nic. Otavă&quot;, and in 1905, the poems &quot;Plugarii&quot;, &quot;Lăutarul&quot;, &quot;Dascălul&quot;, &quot;Rugăciune&quot;, and &quot;Clăcașii&quot;.

=== Critical remarks on the editorial debut ===
Goga entered literary publishing with recommendations from Ilarie Chendi, Sextil Pușcariu, Nicolae Iorga, Ion Gorun, Vasile Goldiș, and Eugen Lovinescu.

In 1905 the volume &quot;Poezii&quot; appeared in Budapest, reprinted by the publishing house &quot;Minerva&quot; in Bucharest in 1907. and in Sibiu in 1910. After this editorial debut, which became a &quot;true literary event&quot;, the poet became increasingly in the public consciousness. The literary critic Ion Dodu Bălan considered that Goga&#x27;s volume &quot;signifies the beginning of a new epoch for our Romanian soul&quot;, because &quot;no one has surpassed the vigour, purity and music of our language, the richness of colours, the originality of ideas, the serenity of concepts, the candour of expressions and the healthy national background, which is concentrated in these poems&quot;. The poems in this volume are considered &quot;brilliant creations&quot; and the most valuable critics &quot;understand the social, national and aesthetic significance of this appearance in the history of Romanian lyric&quot;.

After the review in &quot;Revista Familia&quot; , Iosif Vulcan returns, on the occasion of the publication of the poem &quot;&quot;, with the appreciation that Goga is &quot;an original talent inspired only by the soul of the people&quot;, and the poem, &quot;a literary event&quot;. The volume &quot;Poems&quot; was enthusiastically received by critics and writers.

Titu Maiorescu revised his aesthetic theory of 1866 (&quot;Politics is a product of reason; poetry is and must be a product of fantasy - otherwise it has no material: one, however, excludes the other&quot;). In the notion of politics, the mentor of &quot;Junimii&quot; included patriotism [as] an element of political action, eventually acknowledging that [patriotism] has become one of the sources of Goga&#x27;s poetry and inspires him in the most natural way. The proof lies in the bringing in and describing of ordinary figures in the life of the people, who, however, suddenly gain — in addition to their normal value and purpose — a significance, one might say an extraordinary illumination and brilliance, which can only be explained by the ardour of the struggle to defend the national heritage&quot;.

Other appreciations of esteem were formulated by Sextil Pușcariu, Ion Luca Caragiale, George Coșbuc, Alexandru Vlahuță, Eugen Lovinescu, Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea, and George Panu. Considered a poet of the nation on both sides of the Carpathians, the poet enjoyed remarkable literary prestige by the age of 25.

=== Death ===
Retired alone at Ciucea Castle - his wife preferred to stay in Bucharest - Goga suffered a stroke with hemiplegia in the park of the manor house on 5 May 1938 and fell into a coma. He died two days later, on 7 May 1938 at 2.15 pm, aged 57. King Carol II ordered a national funeral for him which, due to the 10th May holiday, was to begin on 11 May. For two days, on Sunday 8 May and Monday 9 May, the pilgrimage continued in front of the catafalque in Ciucea. On Tuesday 10 May, the funeral train left for Bucharest. The coffin was placed on Wednesday 11 May in the rotunda of the Athenaeum, where it remained until Saturday 14 May, when the national funeral took place. In accordance with his will, no words were spoken and a Nazi swastika was placed on the body.

Goga was buried in Bucharest, at Bellu Cemetery. Later the poet&#x27;s body was reburied at his mansion in Ciucea, according to his wishes.

== Activity ==

=== Journalistic activity ===
The poet&#x27;s journalistic beginnings were linked to the magazine &quot;Luceafărul&quot;, founded on his initiative on July 1, 1902, in Budapest, together with Alexandru Ciura and Octavian Tăslăuanu. Goga remained successively as editor-in-chief or director until 1912. The appearance of the magazine &quot;Luceafărul&quot; was to a large extent confused with the concerns and sorrows of young students, animated by the same dreams:

These young people from Budapest knew that they had a duty to defend the ideals of an entire community.

&quot;Luceafărul&quot; appeared in Budapest on July 1, 1902, on the initiative and with the material support of A.P. Bănuț, supported by a group of patriotic Romanian students. &quot;There was also a lack for Transylvania,&quot; said Goga, &quot;of a literary magazine in whose pages the local character with all its differences from other parts of our nation was imprinted&quot;. Octavian Goga&#x27;s contribution to the rise of &quot;Luceafăr&quot; was immense: &quot;Octavian Goga,&quot; wrote Ion Chinezu, &quot;wrote for other magazines, even founded some; his name is linked to &quot;Luceafărul&quot;&quot;.

With his activity in the Transylvanian Association for Romanian Literature and Culture of the Romanian People (ASTRA), his publicity concerns intensified with the passing of time, revealing yet another side of his literary talent. Under his direction, the journal &quot;Țara&quot; &quot;noastră&quot; appeared on 1 January 1907, temporarily replacing the journal &quot;Transilvania&quot;. Goga, who effectively directed this weekly, appeared first as editor and then as owner-editor. In the first issue he published the editorial entitled &quot;To our scholars&quot;, in which he stated that he aimed to write: &quot;a good gazette. A gazette that bridges the gap between the souls of the scholars and the peasants who kneel to read it on Sundays. All scholars who feel in their hearts the resonance of a duty that demands fulfilment will have their say on this paper, the profits of which will benefit our cultural establishment.&quot; The magazine &quot;Țara noastră&quot; appeared weekly in Sibiu until 5 December 1909. It then reappeared in Cluj (1922 - 1931), with Octavian Goga as director, and then in Bucharest (1932 - 1938). The issue of 29 May 1938 was dedicated to the memory of its founder, who died on 7 May.

Until the outbreak of the World War I, Goga established himself as a brilliant journalist through his articles published in &quot;Țara noastră&quot; magazine, &quot;Epoca&quot; newspaper, &quot;Adevărul&quot;, &quot;Flacăra&quot; magazine and &quot;România&quot; magazine, his journalistic prose being stylistically and thematically comparable to Eminescu. His articles approached the value of the work of a vocational prose writer. The prose writings (included in the volume &quot;Precursori&quot;) were either speeches given at Academy meetings, anniversary addresses or simply tributes to personalities or friends of the writer. Considered anthological pieces in a possible history of portraiture, Tudor Vianu dedicated a significant chapter to it in &quot;The Art of Romanian Short Stories&quot;.

Goga focused his publicity on the problems of &quot;Romanianism&quot; (the origin of the Romanians, the uninterrupted continuity in the formation of the Romanian people, the idea of the unity of all Romanians, the ideal of union in a nation state, the struggle against Austro-Hungarian oppression). Through the magazine &quot;Luceafărul&quot; he managed to strengthen his cultural ties with Romania, towards the political union of later. The magazine &quot;Țara Noastra&quot;, which focused on Goga&#x27;s ideology, also strengthened its ties with the people in the villages, advising them but also helping them with their spiritual and material needs.

=== Playwright activity ===
Although few in number, uneven and below the level of his poetic achievements, Goga&#x27;s drama, especially through &quot;Domnul notar&quot;, (published by the Institute of Graphic Arts in Bucharest), was a landmark that was followed later. The play premiered at the National Theatre of Bucharest on 14 February 1914. The play examines the repercussions on family relations and the position in the village community of the transactions and concessions made by certain individuals as a result of the policy of bringing Romanian elements into the system of denationalization and oppression of the Romanians. The action takes place in an early 20th-century village in the Ardennes (Lunca) under Habsburg rule. The revolt during which the renegade Traian Văleanu was punished, gave the individual drama its true social dimensions. The notary, like the candidate Blezu, was a tool of foreign domination. At the elections, the wishes of the people were opposed by the coalition of renegades, relying on coercive force (the gendarmes) and disqualified elements (Mitruță), even common criminals (Hopârtean).

With &quot;Meșterul Manole&quot;, performed in 1927 and published in 1928, Goga attempted to adapt the old myth to psychological drama, artistically rehabilitating the old plot of conjugal time by developing and examining erotic motivations. The main character was an artist, cynical, charming, an inveterate traveller, a great lover of passing erotic experiences.

Goga also left, as a draft, two one-act plays (&quot;Sonata lunei&quot; and &quot;Lupul&quot;), the sketch &quot;Fruntașul&quot;, a dialogue article from 1911 and the translation of Imre Madách&#x27;s &quot;The Tragedy of Man&#x27;.

=== Translator activity ===
An opponent of the Transylvanian policy of the Hungarian governments, Goga was at the same time an admirer of classical and modern Hungarian literature. He studied the works of Sándor Petőfi and Imre Madách from his high school years in Sibiu and later as a student at the University of Budapest, and was a close friend of Endre Ady. Imre Madách attracted Goga from his youth, his first attempts at translating the &quot;Tragediei omului&quot; dating from his school years. After a few paintings and scenes from the &quot;Tragediei&quot;, published in &quot;Luceafărul&quot; in (1903) or in &quot;Țara noastră&quot; (1909), the appearance of the &quot;Tragediei omului&quot; in volume form in Goga&#x27;s translation came in 1934, received as &quot;a brilliant poetic creation having the same value as the original&quot;. The second Romanian edition (1940) appeared revised by the author.

Tudor Vianu wrote that &quot;Memento mori&quot; and &quot;Tragediei omului&quot; are &quot;poems of humanity seen through the hopes, defeats and struggles of peoples&quot;. George Călinescu observed that Goga&#x27;s translation is done in a Romanian that approaches the perfection and beauty of Eminescu&#x27;s language: &quot;It is the language and even the style of Eminescu that is appropriate to our time and it is precisely interesting to see a classical poet who manages to be plastic through words, for the ear, not through colorism&quot;.

=== Political activity ===
Becoming a messenger of the nationalist aspirations of the Transylvanian Romanians, Goga was elected literary secretary of the Transylvanian Association for Romanian Literature and Culture of the Romanian People (ASTRA) in September 1906 and, together with Octavian Codru Tăslăuanu, politicized the activities of the most important cultural institution in Transylvania. Through articles published in the magazine &quot;Țara noastră&quot;, he took a critical stance towards the exploitation to which the Romanian peasants were subjected and towards Romania&#x27;s then rulers. As a consequence of these attitudes, Goga was detained in the winter of 1911 for a month in the Seghedin prison, where he was visited by Ion Luca Caragiale, who protested against his arrest in his article &quot;Situție penibilă&quot;. Two years later, in 1913, Goga was arrested again, in Seghedin.

After the outbreak of the World War I, Goga settled in Romania, continuing the struggle for the annexation of Transylvania to Romania and for the completion of Romanian state unity. He launched an extensive publicity campaign in the newspapers &quot;Adevărul&quot; and &quot;Epoca&quot; on the situation of the brothers across the Carpathians, who were subject to persecution. Together with Octavian Codru Tăslăuanu, Onisifor Ghibu and Sebastian Bornemisa, he signed the letter to the Transylvanian journalists who had taken refuge in Romania (&quot;Epoca&quot;, 15 June 1915), with the aim of continuing the publicity work for the annexation of Transylvania.

On 14 December 1914 the &quot;Extraordinary Congress of the Cultural League&quot; was held (president Vasile Lucaciu, vice-president: Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea, secretary: Nicolae Iorga, and Goga was a member of the committee, representing Transylvania).

At the meeting organized by the &quot;Political League of All Romanians&quot;, in Bucharest, on February 15, 1915, he declared: &quot;For tomorrow&#x27;s sacrifice we have crossed the border, let us come to Wallachia. We have lost our country, we have lost our homeland, but we still have our heads. We give them to you, do what you want with them. They can fall, Transylvania cannot fall&quot;.

Because of his political activity in Romania, the Hungarian government in Budapest brought Goga - as an Austro-Hungarian citizen - to trial for high treason and sentenced him to death in absentia. He joined the Romanian army and fought as a soldier in Dobrogea. When hostilities ended and the peace was signed in Bucharest, Goga was forced to leave Romania for France. In the summer of 1918, the &quot;National Council of Romanian Unity&quot; was set up in Paris, a forum for putting pressure on the great powers to achieve Romanian state unity. At the beginning of 1919, Goga returned to Greater Romania.

=== Romanian &quot;Duce&quot; or &quot;Führer&quot; ===
According to historian Ilarion Țiu, in the 1920s Goga was a supporter of parliamentary democracy, but after 1930 his views changed radically, sympathizing with Italian fascism and German Nazism. He was one of the leaders of the Romanian nationalist movement.
In 1926 together with Vasile Goldiș, Ioan Lupaș, and Silviu Dragomir, Octavian Goga left the Romanian National Party and joined General Alexandru Averescu&#x27;s People&#x27;s Party (PP), a populist movement created upon the war&#x27;s end. Interestingly, Goga, Goldiș, Lupaș, and Dragomir were all Orthodox, whereas the PNR leader Iuliu Maniu and other remaining members of the PNR were Greek-Catholic. Goga clashed with Averescu over the latter&#x27;s conflict with King Carol II. Together with Goldiș, Lupaș, and Dragomir, Goga founded the National Agrarian Party on April 10, 1932.

The government chaired by Goga (28 December 1937 – 10 February 1938) and dismissed after 44 days, was created by the National Christian Party resulting from the merger on 14 July 1935 in Iași of the National Christian Defence League (led by Alexandru C. Cuza) and the National Agrarian Party (led by Goga).

As a sine qua non for the recognition of its new borders, Romania has solemnly undertaken to grant full citizenship and equal rights to all minorities across these borders. In this regard, on 9 December 1919, the Romanian government (Prime Minister Alexandru Vaida-Voievod, 1 December 1919 – 20 January 1920) ordered General Constantin Coandă (former Romanian Foreign Minister) to sign with the Allied and Associated Powers the &quot;Treaty on Minorities&quot;, annexed to the Peace Treaty with Austria, which his predecessor, Romanian Prime Minister Ion I.C. Brătianu, had categorically refused to sign, leaving, in protest, the work of the Paris Peace Conference in May 1919. The provisions of the minorities&#x27; treaty were subsequently legislated by the Constitution of 29 March 1923 and the law of 25 February 1924, whereby all inhabitants, former citizens of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Tsarist Russia, who had administrative residence in Transylvania, Banat, Crișana, and Maramureș on 1 December 1918, in Bukovina on 28 November 1918 and in Bessarabia on 9 April 1918, acquired Romanian citizenship with full rights.

Under the pretext that between 1918 and 1924 Jews from the former Austro-Hungarian and Russian empires had infiltrated Romania, the government chaired by Octavian Goga, in violation of the Constitution and Romania&#x27;s international obligations, published on 21 January 1938 Decree No. 169 on the revision of citizenship, by virtue of which Romanian Jewish citizens were forced to prove their right to citizenship with documents, in accordance with the law of 25 February 1924, within 20 days of the posting of lists in communes and towns. On the basis of this decree, the situation of 617,396 Jews was reviewed, of whom 392,172 (63.50%) retained their Romanian citizenship and 225,222 (36.50%) lost it. The Jews who lost their citizenship received identity certificates valid for one year, with the possibility of extension, and were considered foreigners without a passport, subject to the legal regime as such.

This was the first in a series of discriminatory laws, adopted as part of a policy of ethnic cleansing, whereby the Romanian state abandoned its citizens of Jewish origin, depriving them of the most basic civic rights. The Jewish minority, left to the whim of despotic regional civil servants, began to expatriate. A wave of Romanian intellectuals and industrialists of Jewish origin left Romania, Romanian economy and culture were damaged, and leading intellectuals protested vehemently.

In an interview with the British newspaper &quot;Daily Herald&quot; in January 1938, King Carol II and Prime Minister Goga gave the figure of 250,000 and 500,000 Jews respectively as &quot;illegal&quot;. While the King rejected the idea of expulsion, denying them any rights, Goga spoke of 500,000 so-called &quot;vagrants&quot;, whom &quot;we cannot consider as Romanian citizens&quot;. Octavian Goga proposed the deportation of 500,000 Jews to Madagascar (a concept known as the &quot;Madagascar Plan&quot;), while Istrate Micescu, the foreign minister in the Goga–Cuza government, declared: &quot;It is urgent to sweep up our own backyard, as it is useless to tolerate all these scum in our country&quot;.

Prime Minister Goga pursued a pro-Nazi policy by intending to ally with and adopt the policies of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy and pursued an anti-Semitic policy by denying the legal rights of the Jewish population. The former Romanian minority freed from Habsburg oppression and turned politician propelled to the leadership of the majority population outperformed his teachers in the minority populations thrust. He turned out to be a xenophobic extremist with fascist and clearly anti-Semitic views. The historian Florin Constantiniu writes in his book &quot;O istorie sinceră a poporului român&quot; that the great poet Goga was in a state of dismay because he &quot;believed himself to be and wanted to be a Romanian &#x27;duce&#x27; or &#x27;führer&#x27;&quot;.

The paramilitary wing of the National Christian Party, the &quot;Lănceri&quot; (meaning &quot;Lancers&quot;, the word was derived from LANC, the Romanian acronym of National-Christian Defense League) contributed to the chaos, attacking both Jews and Iron Guard members.

Carol II first pushed towards a victory of the government in the snap elections in March 1938, which he had called on January 18, 1938. However, he soon abandoned Goga, preparing a coup together with the minister of the Interior Armand Călinescu, a former member of the National Peasants&#x27; Party, who acted as a guarantee for the king in the government. The coup was probably precipitated when Goga negotiated an electoral agreement with Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, the leader of the Iron Guard, on February 8, 1938, thus posing a considerable threat to the King&#x27;s power. On February 9, 1938, Carol II, Călinescu and the former national liberal prime minister Gheorghe Tătărescu set the coup for the next day. On February 10, 1938, Carol II received Goga and told him to postpone the snap elections, whereupon Goga resigned. Goga refused to participate in the national unity government the king appointed the same day and withdrew to his estate in Ciucea, Transylvania, where he suffered a stroke on 5 May 1938. He died two days later, on May 7, 1938.

=== Goga and Freemasonry ===
The Forty-Eighters, Bonjuriists and other Romanians with studies abroad imported the fashion of Freemasonry, to which the Romanian intelligentsia opted - with unequal enthusiasm and fidelity. Although invested as a Freemason, Goga did not understand the ideals of the confraternity: &quot;... April 1929: Octavian Goga militates for the founding of the Freemasonic Christian Bloc. Octavian Goga, who, although a Freemason, has no idea of the purpose of Freemasonry, because he allowed himself to talk about Christianity in the lodge - a mistake the Masons will never forgive him for. D. Goga went so far with his naivety that he proposed that the National Lodge be called the Christian National Lodge&quot;.

== Election to the Romanian Academy ==
With the award of the &quot;Năsturel-Herescu&quot; Prize for his debut volume on March 21, 1906, Octavian Goga&#x27;s poetic creation received the consecration of the Romanian Academy. The report to the plenary of the Romanian Academy for the award of the volume Poems was presented in February 1906 by Titu Maiorescu.

In 1920, Goga was elected a member of the academy, his acceptance speech being entitled George Coșbuc. In 1924, the poet received the National Poetry Prize and the Mihail Sadoveanu Prize for prose.

<text>David Stone (February 17, 1770October 7, 1818) was the 15th governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina from 1808 to 1810. Both before and after his term as governor, he served as a U.S. senator, between 1801 and 1807 and between 1813 and 1814.

==Biography==
Stone was born in Bertie County in the Province of North Carolina, the son of planter and politician Zedekiah Stone. He attended Windsor Academy and later the College of New Jersey, where he graduated with honors. Returning to North Carolina, Stone studied law in Halifax and was granted his law license in 1790. He married Hannah Turner and began the construction of a large manor house on land given him by his father, Zedekiah Stone. This is now a historic site, Hope Plantation.

In 1789, Stone was a member of the convention in Fayetteville which ratified the United States Constitution. He proceeded to represent Bertie County in the North Carolina House of Commons until 1795, when he was named to the North Carolina Superior Court.

In 1798, Stone stepped down from the court to serve in the United States House of Representatives for one term; during the contested 1800 presidential election, he cast his vote for Thomas Jefferson when the election was sent to the House for a final decision.

Re-elected in a bid for a second term in the House, Stone resigned when he was elected to the United States Senate by the North Carolina General Assembly in late 1800. He sat as a justice of the Bertie County Court in the early 1800s, including the 1802 scare over a slave rebellion in Bertie County. He resigned his seat in the Senate in 1807 to return to the state Superior Court, but was there for only a year before being elected Governor of North Carolina by the legislature in November 1808.

As Governor, Stone was an ardent supporter of agricultural and industrial development, as well as of the expansion to the education system to both sexes and all social classes. Stone was re-elected in 1809 but was defeated for a third one-year term in 1810 by Benjamin Smith. Following his defeat, Stone served in the North Carolina House of Commons for a year before being named to the U.S. Senate once again in 1813.

Stone&#x27;s second term in the U.S. Senate lasted only a year; he was censured by the NC General Assembly for failing to support the administration during the War of 1812. Stone resigned his Senate seat in December 1814, retiring to his Wake County plantation, where he died in 1818 and is buried.

<text>Benjamin Williams (January 1, 1751July 20, 1814) was the 11th and 14th Governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina, from 1799 to 1802 and from 1807 to 1808. He was the first of two North Carolina Governors since the American Revolution to serve nonconsecutive terms.

==Biography==
Williams was born in Johnston County, North Carolina, in 1751, and became a farmer. He married Elizabeth Jones on August 10, 1781; they had one son named Benjamin. Williams was a Mason and was a member of St. John&#x27;s Lodge in New Bern.

Williams served as a member of the revolutionary convention in Johnston County in 1774; he then served in the North Carolina Provincial Congress and two terms in the Provincial Council. In 1775, Williams was appointed to the Second North Carolina Regiment; he served until 1781, was promoted to the rank of colonel, and fought at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse. He also served in the Province of North Carolina House of Burgesses in 1775.

Military service:
* Lieutenant in the 2nd North Carolina Regiment (1775-1776)
* Captain in the 2nd North Carolina Regiment (1776-1779)
* Lt. Colonel or Colonel in the Johnston County Regiment of North Carolina militia (1780-1781)
* Lt. Colonel or Colonel over the North Carolina State Regiment (State Troops) (1781)

Williams served in both houses of the North Carolina General Assembly over the next three decades, one term in the United States House of Representatives from 1793 to 1795, and four annual terms as Governor. He was a candidate in the 1792 North Carolina gubernatorial election, finishing 4th. He was first elected as governor in 1799 to fill the unexpired term of William R. Davie, who had resigned. Williams was elected twice more and served for three years. During his last year in office he pardoned Congressman John Stanly, who had killed former Gov. Richard Dobbs Spaight in a duel.

The North Carolina Constitution of 1776 limited the post of governor to three one-year terms within a six year period. After three years had passed, Williams sought re-election to the position in 1805 but was defeated by Nathaniel Alexander. In 1807, the General Assembly elected him governor once again, but in 1808 they elected David Stone, ending Williams&#x27; gubernatorial career. Williams was elected one last time to the North Carolina Senate in 1809, then retired from politics.

Williams died in 1814 and is buried in Moore County. His home called House in the Horseshoe, is a tourist attraction operated by the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources.

<text>The tunicle is a liturgical vestment associated with Roman Catholicism, Anglo-Catholic, and Lutheranism.

==Contemporary use==
For a description of the tunicle, see dalmatic, the vestment with which it became identical in form, although earlier editions of the &quot;Caeremoniale Episcoporum&quot; indicated that it should have narrower sleeves. Sometimes it was also distinguished by a single horizontal band on the front and back, as opposed to the double band of the dalmatic.

==History==
In Rome, subdeacons had begun to wear the tunicle by the sixth century, but Pope Gregory I made them return to the use of the chasuble. They began to use the tunicle again in the ninth century, a time when it was also worn by acolytes, a custom that was widespread until the late Middle Ages and can still occasionally be found in some Anglican and Catholic churches for acolytes and crucifers. In some places outside Rome, subdeacons continued to wear the tunicle even from the sixth to the ninth centuries. The ceremony by which the bishop put a tunicle on a subdeacon whom he ordained began in the twelfth century, but did not become common until the fourteenth.

Roman deacons once wore the tunicle under the dalmatic, and the tunicle was part of the liturgical vestments of other dignitaries also. In the twelfth century it became customary for bishops to wear both a tunicle and a dalmatic as part of their pontifical vestments. Previously they had worn one or the other. Earlier editions of the &quot;Caeremoniale Episcoporum&quot; made the wearing of both obligatory at a Pontifical High Mass, but the present edition speaks only of the dalmatic.

<text>Blanche () is a station on Paris Métro Line 2, on the border of the 9th and the 18th arrondissements.

==Location==
The station is located under Boulevard de Clichy in Montmartre, east of Place Blanche. Oriented approximately along an east–west axis, it is located between the Place de Clichy and Pigalle metro stations.

==History==

The station was opened on 21 October 1902 as part of the extension of line 2 Nord from Étoile to Anvers and simply as line 2 from 17 October 1907. The station was not ready for the opening of the line two weeks earlier, so trains passed without stopping. The station is named after the &quot;Place Blanche&quot; (French for &quot;white place&quot;), which derives its name from the gypsum that spilled in the 17th century from the wagons leaving the Montmartre quarries, where it was mined to produce plaster of Paris. The &quot;Place&quot; was named after the &quot;Barrière Blanche&quot;, a gate built for the collection of taxation as part of the Wall of the Farmers-General; the gate was built between 1784 and 1788 and demolished in the 19th century.

From the 1950s until 2010, the walls were covered with a metallic bodywork with blue horizontal pillars and illuminated golden advertising frames. Its removal was part of the RATP&#x27;s &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; renovation program, and was completed with &#x27;shell&#x27; white seats characteristic of the &quot;Motte&quot; style.

In 2019, 3,893,362 travelers entered this station which placed it at the 122nd position of the metro stations for its usage.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has a single access entitled &quot;Boulevard de Clichy&quot;, leading to the central reservation of this boulevard, facing no. 59. Consisting of a fixed staircase, it is adorned with a Guimard entrance, whose remaining elements are subject to a registration as historic monuments by a decree of 29 May 1978.

===Station layout===
===Platforms===
Blanche is a standard configuration station. It has two platforms separated by the metro tracks and the vault is elliptical. The decoration is of the style used for most metro stations. The lighting canopies are white and rounded in the &quot;Gaudin&quot; style of the &quot;renouveau du métro des années 2000&quot;, and the bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the walls, the vault, and the tunnel exit. The advertising frames are in white ceramic and the name of the station is written in Parisine font on enamelled plates. The seats are in orange &quot;Akiko&quot; style.

===Bus services===
The station is served by lines 30, 54, 68, 74 and the tourist line OpenTour of the RATP Bus Network and, at night, N01 and N02 of the Noctilien network.

==Nearby==
The station serves the Moulin Rouge.

<text>Nathaniel Alexander (March 5, 1756March 7, 1808) was an American physician and politician who served as the 13th Governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina from 1805 to 1807.

==Biography==
Alexander was born in 1756, in what was at the time known as Anson County in the Province of North Carolina (his birthplace is located near the modern city of Concord). He was the son of a local sheriff. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1776 and was commissioned as a surgeon in the North Carolina Line in 1779. He served through the American Revolutionary War until 1782, and then practiced medicine for a time near Santee, South Carolina. He was distinguished as a politician but also as a physician, with Toner stating that he was a &quot;physician of eminence in Mecklenburg.&quot;

Returning to his native North Carolina, Alexander was elected to the North Carolina House of Commons in 1797, to the North Carolina Senate in 1801, and to the United States House of Representatives in 1803.

On November 25, 1805, Alexander was elected governor by the North Carolina General Assembly and served two one-year terms in that office, declining to run for a third. Although a Democratic-Republican, he enjoyed support from the Federalists as well. As governor, he oversaw the resolution of a boundary dispute with Georgia, the expansion of the state&#x27;s district courts, and the growth of the state&#x27;s educational system. While governor, he was also president of The University of North Carolina Board of Trustees.
Only a few months after stepping down as governor, Alexander died in Salisbury, North Carolina; he is buried in Old Settlers&#x27; Cemetery in Charlotte, North Carolina.

He married a daughter of a Colonel Thomas Polk, but the couple was apparently childless.

<doc id="502664" wikidata="Q4019073" url="?curid=502664" title="West End Blues">
<text>&quot;West End Blues&quot; is a multi-strain twelve-bar blues composition by Joe &quot;King&quot; Oliver. It is most commonly performed as an instrumental, although it has lyrics added by Clarence Williams.

King Oliver and his Dixie Syncopators made the first recording for Brunswick Records on June 11, 1928. Clarence Williams later added lyrics to the instrumental tune. He recorded the song several times in 1928, first with vocalist Ethel Waters, then with Irene Mims, aka Hazel Smith (with King Oliver playing trumpet), then again with Katherine Henderson.

The &quot;West End&quot; of the title refers to the westernmost point of Lake Pontchartrain within Orleans Parish, Louisiana; it was the last stop on the trolley line in New Orleans to the lake. In its heyday, it was a thriving summer resort with live music, dance pavilions, seafood restaurants, and lake bathing.

== Louis Armstrong&#x27;s recording ==

By far the best known recording of &quot;West End Blues&quot; is the 3-minute-plus, 78 rpm recording made by Louis Armstrong and His Hot Five on June 28, 1928. Gunther Schuller devoted page after page to it in his book &quot;Early Jazz&quot;, writing, “The clarion call of “West End Blues’ served notice that jazz had the potential capacity to compete with the highest order of previously known musical expression.” Gary Giddins wrote that this tune “came to symbolize more than any other the ascendancy of a classic American music.”

Armstrong plays trumpet and sings, backed by a band including pianist Earl Hines, clarinetist Jimmy Strong, trombonist Fred Robinson, banjoist Mancy Carr and drummer Zutty Singleton on hand cymbals. Armstrong&#x27;s unaccompanied opening cadenza is considered to be one of the defining moments of early jazz, incorporating a rhythmic freedom that anticipated many later musical developments. In addition, Lil Hardin Armstrong later explained that this introduction stemmed from trumpet exercise books that she and Louis had drilled. Also notable is Armstrong&#x27;s tender scat vocal chorus in a duet with the clarinet in its low register played by Strong. Hines takes a &quot;beautifully crafted&quot; piano solo, which was praised as a &quot;perfect... example of originality in harmony, phrases, and general style.&quot; The final chorus is dominated by a four-bar (12-second) high C (concert high B) played by Armstrong. The number is closed by the metallic click of drummer Zutty Singleton&#x27;s cymbals.

This recording was inducted in the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1979. Billie Holiday cited listening to &quot;West End Blues&quot; as her first experience with scat-singing.

Armstrong recorded several later versions of &quot;West End Blues&quot;, including for the 1947 film &quot;New Orleans&quot; and with his All Stars in the 40s.

== King Oliver&#x27;s recordings ==
Joe &quot;King&quot; Oliver wrote &quot;West End Blues&quot;, and was the first to record it on June 11, 1928, with his band The Dixie Syncopators. This recording established the basic form of the song that Armstrong&#x27;s later recording followed. On January 16, 1929, Oliver recorded the song again, borrowing from the Hot Five arrangement, though at a quicker tempo. The opening trumpet cadenza (based heavily on Armstrong&#x27;s 1928 recording) has frequently been incorrectly credited to Oliver, but was in fact played by trumpeter Louis Metcalf. Pianist Luis Russel also takes a solo, in turn basing it on Earl Hines&#x27; solo from the Hot Five recording.

<text>Pigalle () is a station on lines 2 and 12 of the Paris Métro, named after the Place Pigalle, which commemorates the sculptor Jean-Baptiste Pigalle (1714–1785) on the border of the 9th and the 18th arrondissement. The station is located under the Boulevard de Clichy in Montmartre and serves the famous Pigalle red-light district.

==Location==
The station is located under Place Pigalle, the platforms being established:

* on line 2 (between Blanche and Anvers stations), east of the said square and oriented east–west, along the axis of Boulevard de Clichy;
* on line 12 (between Abbesses and Saint-Georges), in a curve at the end of Rue Frochot, partly under the tunnel of line 2 which it crosses perpendicularly.

==History==
The station was opened on 21 October 1902 as part of the extension of line 2 from Étoile to Anvers. The line 12 platforms were opened on 8 April 1911 with the extension of the Nord-Sud Company&#x27;s &quot;line A&quot; from Notre-Dame-de-Lorette. It was the northern terminus of line C until its extension to Jules Joffrin on 31 October 1912. This line was taken over by the Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain de Paris and was renamed &quot;line 12&quot; on 27 March 1931.

The &quot;Place Pigalle&quot; was named after the &quot;Barrière Pigalle&quot;, a gate built for the collection of taxation as part of the Wall of the Farmers-General; the gate was built between 1784 and 1788 and demolished in the 19th century.

Like a third of the stations on the network, between 1974 and 1984, the platforms on line 12 were modernized in the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style, orange with flat white tiles. For its part, the stopping point on line 2, received a &quot;Ouï-dire&quot; style layout after 1988, blue in this case.

As part of the RATP&#x27;s &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; program, the station&#x27;s corridors were renovated on 29 April 2005. The lighting canopies in the connecting corridors then had the distinction of being punctuated by a few tubes diffusing a light blue, later white.

In 2019, 5,599,495 travelers entered this station which placed it in 71st position of the metro stations for its usage.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has an entrance titled &quot;Place Pigalle&quot;, divided into three metro outlets established on the central reservation of Boulevard de Clichy, the main one, located east of the place, is adorned with a Guimard édicule. This one, designed in 1900 by Hector Guimard, is the subject of a decrees as a historic monuments on 12 February 2016. The two other metro outlets, located more in the center of the square at no. 20 and 22 of the boulevard, are decorated with balustrades in the style characteristic of the Nord-Sud company.

===Station layout===
===Platforms===
The platforms of the two lines are of standard configuration. Two in number per stop, they are separated by the metro tracks located in the centre and the vault is elliptical.

The station on line 2 is fitted out in a blue &quot;Ouï-dire&quot; style. The lighting canopies, of the same colour, are supported by curved hook in the shape of a scythe. The direct lighting is white while the indirect lighting, projected on the vault, is multicoloured. The white ceramic tiles are flat and cover the walls, the vault, and the tunnel exit. The advertising frames are blue and cylindrical, and the name of the station is written in Parisine font on enamelled plates. The platforms are equipped with blue &#x27;sit-stand&#x27; benches.

The station of line 12 is established in a curve and its vault is semi-elliptical, a form specific to the old Nord-Sud stations. The decoration is in a &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style with two orange light canopies, benches in flat brown tiles and orange &quot;Motte&quot; seats. These arrangements are married with the flat white tiling which covers the walls, and the tunnel exits, while the vault is painted in white. The hallways are treated in classic bevelled white tiles. The advertising frames are metallic, and the name of the station is written in Parisine typography on enameled plates.

===Bus services===
The station is served by lines 30, 40 and 54 of the RATP Bus Network and, at night, by lines N01 and N02 of the Noctilien network.

<text>passwd is a command on Unix, Plan 9, Inferno, and most Unix-like operating systems used to change a user&#x27;s password. The password entered by the user is run through a key derivation function to create a hashed version of the new password, which is saved. Only the hashed version is stored; the entered password is not saved for security reasons.

When the user logs on, the password entered by the user during the log on process is run through the same key derivation function and the resulting hashed version is compared with the saved version. If the hashes are identical, the entered password is considered to be correct, and the user is authenticated. In theory, it is possible for two different passwords to produce the same hash. However, cryptographic hash functions are designed in such a way that finding any password that produces the same hash is very difficult and practically infeasible, so if the produced hash matches the stored one, the user can be authenticated. 

The passwd command may be used to change passwords for local accounts, and on most systems, can also be used to change passwords managed in a distributed authentication mechanism such as NIS, Kerberos, or LDAP.

== Password file ==
The codice_1 file is a text-based database of information about users that may log into the system or other operating system user identities that own running processes.

In many operating systems, this file is just one of many possible back-ends for the more general passwd name service.

The file&#x27;s name originates from one of its initial functions as it contained the data used to verify passwords of user accounts. However, on modern Unix systems the security-sensitive password information is instead often stored in a different file using shadow passwords, or other database implementations.

The codice_1 file typically has file system permissions that allow it to be readable by all users of the system (&quot;world-readable&quot;), although it may only be modified by the superuser or by using a few special purpose privileged commands.

The codice_1 file is a text file with one record per line, each describing a user account.
Each record consists of seven fields separated by colons. The ordering of the records within the file is generally unimportant.

An example record may be:

The fields, in order from left to right, are:
# : User name: the string a user would type in when logging into the operating system: the logname. Must be unique across users listed in the file.
# : Information used to validate a user&#x27;s password. The format is the same as that of the analogous field in the shadow password file, with the additional convention that setting it to &quot;x&quot; means the actual password is found in the shadow file, a common occurrence on modern systems.
# : user identifier number, used by the operating system for internal purposes. It must be unique as it identifies users uniquely.
# : group identifier number, which identifies the primary group of the user; all files that are created by this user may initially be accessible to this group.
# : Gecos field, commentary that describes the person or account. Typically, this is a set of comma-separated values including the user&#x27;s full name and contact details.
# : Path to the user&#x27;s home directory.
# : Program that is started every time the user logs into the system. For an interactive user, this is usually one of the system&#x27;s command line interpreters (shells).

== Shadow file ==
codice_4 is used to increase the security level of passwords by restricting all but highly privileged users&#x27; access to hashed password data. Typically, that data is kept in files owned by and accessible only by the super user. 

Systems administrators can reduce the likelihood of brute-force attacks by making the list of hashed passwords unreadable by unprivileged users. The obvious way to do this is to make the codice_5 database itself readable only by the root user. However, this would restrict access to other data in the file such as username-to-userid mappings, which would break many existing utilities and provisions. One solution is a &quot;shadow&quot; password file to hold the password hashes separate from the other data in the world-readable &quot;passwd&quot; file. For local files, this is usually codice_4 on Linux and Unix systems, or codice_7 on BSD systems; each is readable only by &quot;root&quot;. (Root access to the data is considered acceptable since on systems with the traditional &quot;all-powerful root&quot; security model, the root user would be able to obtain the information in other ways in any case). Virtually all recent Unix-like operating systems use shadowed passwords.

The shadow password file does not entirely solve the problem of attacker access to hashed passwords, as some network authentication schemes operate by transmitting the hashed password over the network (sometimes in cleartext, e.g., Telnet), making it vulnerable to interception. Copies of system data, such as system backups written to tape or optical media, can also become a means for illicitly obtaining hashed passwords. In addition, the functions used by legitimate password-checking programs need to be written in such a way that malicious programs cannot make rapid authentication checks.

Regardless of whether password shadowing is in effect on a given system, the passwd file is readable by all users so that various system utilities (e.g., grep) can work (e.g., to ensure that user names existing on the system can be found inside the file), while only the root user can write to it. Without password shadowing, this means that an attacker with unprivileged access to the system can obtain the hashed form of every user&#x27;s password. Those values can be used to mount a brute force attack offline, testing possible passwords against the hashed passwords relatively quickly without alerting system security arrangements designed to detect an abnormal number of failed login attempts. Especially when the hash is not salted it is also possible to look up these hashed passwords in rainbow tables, databases specially made for giving back a password for a unique hash.

With a shadowed password scheme in use, the codice_1 file typically shows a character such as &#x27;codice_9&#x27;, or &#x27;codice_10&#x27; in the password field for each user instead of the hashed password, and codice_4 usually contains the following user information:
* User login name
* salt and hashed password OR a status exception value e.g.:
** codice_12, the printable form of a password hash as produced by crypt (C), where codice_13 is the algorithm used. Other Unix-like systems may have different values, like NetBSD. Key stretching is used to increase password cracking difficulty, using by default 1000 rounds of modified MD5, 64 rounds of Blowfish, 5000 rounds of SHA-256 or SHA-512. The number of rounds may be varied for Blowfish, or for SHA-256 and SHA-512 by using codice_14, where &quot;A&quot; and &quot;X&quot; are the algorithm IDs and the number of rounds. Common id values include:
***codice_15 – MD5
***codice_16, codice_17, codice_18 – bcrypt
***codice_19 – SHA-256
***codice_20 – SHA-512
***codice_21 – yescrypt
** Empty string – No password, the account has no password (reported by passwd on Solaris with &quot;NP&quot;).
** &quot;!&quot;, &quot;*&quot; – the account is password locked, user will be unable to log in via password authentication but other methods (e.g. ssh key, logging in as root) may be still allowed.
** &quot;*LK*&quot; – the account itself is locked, user will be unable to log in.
** &quot;*NP*&quot;, &quot;!!&quot; – the password has never been set
* Days since epoch of last password change
* Days until change allowed
* Days before change required
* Days warning for expiration
* Days after no logins before account is locked
* Days since epoch when account expires
* Reserved and unused

The format of the shadow file is simple, and basically identical to that of the password file, to wit, one line per user, ordered fields on each line, and fields separated by colons. Many systems require the order of user lines in the shadow file be identical to the order of the corresponding users in the password file.

== History ==

Prior to password shadowing, a Unix user&#x27;s hashed password was stored in the second field of their record in the codice_1 file (within the seven-field format as outlined above).

Password shadowing first appeared in Unix systems with the development of SunOS in the mid-1980s, System V Release 3.2 in 1988 and BSD4.3 Reno in 1990. But, vendors who had performed ports from earlier UNIX releases did not always include the new password shadowing features in their releases, leaving users of those systems exposed to password file attacks.

System administrators may also arrange for the storage of passwords in distributed databases such as NIS and LDAP, rather than in files on each connected system. In the case of NIS, the shadow password mechanism is often still used on the NIS servers; in other distributed mechanisms the problem of access to the various user authentication components is handled by the security mechanisms of the underlying data repository.

In 1987, the author of the original &quot;Shadow Password Suite&quot;, Julie Haugh, experienced a computer break-in and wrote the initial release of the Shadow Suite containing the codice_23, codice_5 and codice_25 commands. The original release, written for the SCO Xenix operating system, quickly got ported to other platforms. The Shadow Suite was ported to Linux in 1992 one year after the original announcement of the Linux project, and was included in many early distributions, and continues to be included in many current Linux distributions.

In the past, it was necessary to have different commands to change passwords in different authentication schemes. For example, the command to change a NIS password was &quot;yppasswd&quot;. This required users to be aware of the different methods to change passwords for different systems, and also resulted in wasteful duplication of code in the various programs that performed the same functions with different back ends. In most implementations, there is now a single passwd command, and the control of where the password is actually changed is handled transparently to the user via pluggable authentication modules (PAMs). For example, the type of hash used is dictated by the configuration of the codice_26 module. By default, the MD5 hash has been used, while current modules are also capable of stronger hashes such as blowfish, SHA256 and SHA512.

<text>Anvers () is a station on Line 2 of the Paris Métro. It is located in Montmartre, on the border of the 9th and the 18th arrondissements.

==Location==
The station is located under Boulevard Marguerite-de-Rochechouart, at Place d&#x27;Anvers. Oriented approximately along an east–west axis, it is located between Pigalle and Barbès - Rochechouart metro stations. In the direction of Nation, it is the last underground station preceding the above ground section of the line.

==History==

The station was opened on 21 October 1902 as part of the extension of Line 2 from Étoile. It was the eastern terminus of the line until its extension to Bagnolet (now called Alexandre Dumas) on 31 January 1903. The station is named after the Place d&#x27;Anvers and the Belgian city of Antwerp (&quot;Anvers&quot; in French) where French troops won a victory over the Dutch during the siege of the citadel of Antwerp in 1832.

The station is located under the Boulevard de Rochechouart, which was built on the route of the Wall of the Farmers-General in order to enforce the collection of taxation between 1784 and 1791 but demolished in the 19th century. Anvers (Sacré-Cœur) is only station on Line 2 between the Charles de Gaulle—Étoile and the Nation stations that is not built on the site of a gate (or &quot;barrière&quot; in French) of the wall, which became important intersections and thus, logical places for stations. Instead, Anvers station was placed as close to the foot of the Montmartre funicular as possible. Nevertheless, the Barrière de Rochechouart was at the east, near the junction of the Boulevard de Rochechouart and the Rue de Rochechouart. Also near are the hill of Montmartre and the Basilica of the Sacré-Cœur.

From the 1950s to the end of the 2000s, the side walls were covered with metal bodywork with blue horizontal uprights and illuminated golden advertising frames. Before the bodyworks removal as part of the RATP&#x27;s &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; renovation, it was supplemented with &quot;shell&quot; yellow seats characteristic of the &quot;Motte&quot; style. The platform modernization work was completed in 2010.

On 1 April 2016, half of the nameplates on the station&#x27;s platforms were replaced by the RATP to make an April Fool joke for a day, as in twelve other stations. They use the name of the station (without its subtitle), but are humorously turned upside down in order to play on the homophony between &quot;Anvers&quot; and &quot;envers&quot; (reverse).

In 2019, 5,643,147 travelers entered this station which placed it at the 67th position of the metro stations for its usage.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has a single access entitled &quot;Boulevard de Rochechouart - Sacré-Coeur&quot;, leading to the central reservation of this boulevard, on Place d&#x27;Anvers opposite the similarly named square. Consisting of a fixed staircase, it is adorned with a Guimard entrance, the elements of which were designed by Hector Guimard in 1900 was listed as historic monuments by the decree of 29 May 1978.

===Station layout===
===Platforms===
Anvers is a standard configuration station. It has two platforms separated by the metro tracks and the vault is elliptical. The decoration is of the style used for most metro stations. The lighting canopies are white and rounded in the &quot;Gaudin&quot; style of the &quot;renouveau du métro des années 2000&quot;, and the bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the walls, the vault, the tunnel exits and the outlets of the corridors. The advertising frames are in white ceramic and the name of the station is written in the Parisine font on enamelled plates. The seats are a green &quot;Akiko&quot; style.

===Bus services===
The station is served by lines 54, 85 and the tourist line OpenTour of the RATP Bus Network and, at night, by lines N01 and N02 of the Noctilien network.

The Montmartre Funicular is accessible a few hundred meters away by taking the Rue de Steinkerque.

<doc id="502673" wikidata="Q128336" url="?curid=502673" title="William Bentinck, 4th Duke of Portland">
<text>William Henry Cavendish-Scott-Bentinck, 4th Duke of Portland, (24 June 1768 – 27 March 1854), styled Marquess of Titchfield until 1809, was a British politician who served in various positions in the governments of George Canning and Lord Goderich.

==Background and education==
Portland was the eldest son of Prime Minister William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland and Lady Dorothy, daughter of William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire and Charlotte Boyle, Baroness Clifford. He was the elder brother of Lord William Bentinck and Lord Charles Bentinck.

He was educated first in Ealing under the tutelage of Samuel Goodenough graduating in 1774, followed by Westminster School (1783). He attended Christ Church, Oxford for two years but did not take a degree. The third Duke, who spared no expense for his heir, sent him to The Hague in 1786 for experience working with the crown&#x27;s envoy, Sir James Harris. He returned in 1789.

He later received an honorary degree of Doctor of Civil Law from Oxford in 1793. He also served as a Family Trustee of the British Museum; in 1810, he loaned the famed Portland Vase to the museum.

==Political career==
Portland was Member of Parliament for Petersfield between 1790 and 1791 and for Buckinghamshire between 1791 and 1809.

He served under his father as a Lord of the Treasury between March and September 1807. He remained out of office until April 1827 when he was appointed Lord Privy Seal by his brother-in-law George Canning. He was sworn of the Privy Council the same year. When Lord Goderich became Prime Minister in August 1827, Portland became Lord President of the Council, an office he retained until the government fell in January 1828. Over time the Duke became less of a staunch Conservative, softening to some of the more liberal stances of Canning.

Portland also held the honorary post of Lord Lieutenant of Middlesex between 1794 and 1841.

==Family==
Portland married Henrietta, eldest daughter and heiress of Major-General John Scott of Fife and his wife Margaret (&quot;née&quot; Dundas), in London on 4 August 1795. At the time of his marriage he obtained Royal Licence to take the name and arms of Scott in addition to that of Cavendish-Bentinck. They were parents of nine children:

*William Henry Cavendish-Scott-Bentinck, Marquess of Titchfield (22 October 1796 – 5 March 1824)
*Lady Margaret Harriet Cavendish-Scott-Bentinck (21 April 1798 – 9 April 1882)
*Lady Caroline Cavendish-Scott-Bentinck (6 July 1799 – 23 January 1828)
*William John Cavendish-Scott-Bentinck, 5th Duke of Portland (12 September 1800 – 6 December 1879)
*Lord William George Frederick Cavendish-Scott-Bentinck (27 February 1802 – 21 September 1848)
*Lord Henry William Cavendish-Scott-Bentinck (9 June 1804 – 31 December 1870)
*Lady Charlotte Cavendish-Scott-Bentinck (14 Jan 1806 – 30 September 1889), married Evelyn Denison, 1st Viscount Ossington
*Lady Lucy Joan Cavendish-Scott-Bentinck (27 August 1807 – 29 July 1899), married Charles Ellis, 6th Baron Howard de Walden
*Lady Mary Cavendish-Scott-Bentinck (8 July 1809 – 20 July 1874), married Sir William Topham

==Death and legacy==
The Duchess of Portland died on 24 April 1844. Nearly 10 years later, Portland died at the family seat of Welbeck Abbey, Nottinghamshire, in March 1854, aged 85. Two of their sons predeceased their parents; their eldest dying of a brain lesion and their third son dying of a heart attack.

The duke expressed a desire to be buried in the open churchyard in Bolsover, Derbyshire, near the other family seat at Bolsover Castle. However, he was instead interred in the ancient Cavendish vault, that had previously been unopened for 138 years.

He was succeeded in the dukedom by his second son (but the eldest surviving), William.

The department of Manuscripts and Special Collections, The University of Nottingham holds a number of papers relating to Portland: His personal and political papers are part of the Portland (Welbeck) Collection while the Portland (London) Collection contains papers relating to his estate business. The Portland Estate Papers held at Nottinghamshire Archives also contain items relating to Portland&#x27;s properties.

==Arms==
==Titles==
His full titles were &quot;Duke of Portland, Marquess of Titchfield, Earl of Portland, Viscount Woodstock&quot;, and &quot;Baron Cirencester&quot;.

<doc id="502674" wikidata="Q369751" url="?curid=502674" title="James Turner (North Carolina politician)">
<text>James Turner (December 20, 1766 – January 15, 1824) was the 12th Governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina from 1802 to 1805. He later served as a U.S. Senator from 1805 to 1816.

Turner was born in Southampton County in the Colony of Virginia; his family moved to the Province of North Carolina in 1770. Raised in a family of farmers, Turner served in the North Carolina volunteer militia during the American Revolutionary War in 1780. He served under Nathanael Greene alongside Nathaniel Macon, with whom he formed a lasting friendship and political alliance.

== Politics ==
In 1798, Turner was elected to the North Carolina House of Commons; he served there from 1799 to 1800, and served in the North Carolina Senate from 1801 to 1802.

=== Governor ===

In 1802, the General Assembly elected John Baptista Ashe governor, but he died before he could assume office; Turner was chosen in his place and sworn in on December 5, 1802. He served the constitutional limit of three one-year terms and, at the end of his time as governor, was elected to the United States Senate when Montfort Stokes resigned before serving the term to which he had been elected.

=== U.S. Senate ===
Turner served as a senator for eleven years, re-elected to a second term in 1811, resigning due to ill health in 1816. During his time in office, he supported the administration of James Madison during the War of 1812. Around 1805, he introduced to the Senate a bill outlawing the importation of slaves.

== Personal life, death, legacy ==
Turner was married three times; first to Marian Anderson in 1793 (they had four children), then to Ann Cochran in 1802, with no children, and finally to Elizabeth Johnston in 1810 (resulting in two children). Turner died in 1824 and is buried on his &quot;Bloomsbury&quot; plantation in Warren County. In addition to Bloomsbury, he owned a second home, &quot;Oakland,&quot; in present-day Vance County.

His son Daniel Turner served in the US House of Representatives from 1827 to 1829.

<text>The following is a list of the governors and lieutenant governors of Prince Edward Island, known as &quot;St. John&#x27;s Island&quot; until 1799. Though the present day office of the lieutenant governor in Prince Edward Island came into being only upon the province&#x27;s entry into Canadian Confederation in 1873, the post is a continuation from the first governorship of St. John&#x27;s Island in 1769.

<doc id="502682" wikidata="Q807893" url="?curid=502682" title="Barbès–Rochechouart station">
<text>Barbès–Rochechouart () is a station on Line 2 and Line 4 of the Paris Métro. Situated at the location where the 9th, 10th and 18th arrondissements all share a border point, the station is at the junction of Boulevard Barbès, named for the revolutionary Armand Barbès, the Boulevard de Rochechouart, named for the abbess, Marguerite de Rochechouart, Boulevard de la Chapelle and Boulevard de Magenta.

==Location==
The station is located at the intersection of four boulevards: Boulevard de Magenta, Boulevard de la Chapelle, Boulevard Barbès and Boulevard Marguerite-de-Rochechouart.

The station is the former location of the &quot;Barrière Poissonnière&quot;, a gate in the Wall of the Farmers-General built for the collection of excise taxes (the &quot;octroi&quot;). The gate was built between 1784 and 1788, and it was demolished in the nineteenth century.

==History==
The elevated Line 2 station was opened on 31 January 1903 as Boulevard Barbès station, as part of the extension of Line 2 from Anvers to Bagnolet&#x27;(now called Alexandre Dumas). It was renamed to its current name eight days later. Line 2 descends into a tunnel to the west of the station. The underground Line 4 station was opened on 21 April 1908 as part of the first section of the line from Châtelet to Porte de Clignancourt.

The disastrous fire of 10 August 1903 that resulted in eighty deaths at Couronnes station began at Barbès–Rochechouart. During World War II, on 21 August 1941, Pierre Georges and three companions of the French Resistance shot and killed a German naval cadet named Alfons Moser when he was boarding a train at the Barbès station at eight in the morning. The killing was in revenge for the execution of Samuel Tyszelman for taking part in an anti-German demonstration.
This was the start of a series of assassinations and reprisals that resulted in five hundred French hostages being executed in the next few months.

During work carried out in 1987, the Hector Guimard&#x27;s entrance was transferred to the Bolivar metro station. The station was renovated in 1998.

On 2 December 2016, a train derailed at the station, with no casualties but blocked traffic for 48 hours on part of the line. The derailment was caused by the fall of an inverter boot from the train, located under the body of car.

In 2019, 7,974,496 travelers entered this station which placed it at the 29th position of the metro stations for its usage.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
Access to the Barbès-Rochechouart metro station is located on Boulevard Marguerite-de-Rochechouart, Boulevard Barbès and Boulevard de la Chapelle at the limit of the 9th, 10th and 18th arrondissements of Paris.

===Station layout===


===Platforms===
The two lines have standard configuration stations with two platforms framing the two tracks.

The station of line 2 is elevated, located on a viaduct which ends shortly after leaving the station in the direction of Porte Dauphine. The platforms of line 4 are underground and curved. In the direction of Porte de Clignancourt, it is possible to see the Château Rouge station.

As part of the automation of line 4, its station is being modernized, leading to the removal of its &quot;Ouï-dire&quot; style. Its platforms have been raised to accommodate landing doors.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by lines 31, 54, 56 and 85 of the RATP Bus Network and, at night, by lines N01, N02, N14 and N44 of the Noctilien network.

==Nearby==
* The environment of the station, very cosmopolitan, on the edge of the Goutte d&#x27;Or district, is often associated with the immigrants, mainly from North Africa, but also from sub-Saharan Africa. It includes many retail and import businesses and department stores, including the Tati brand.
* Butte Montmartre, to the northwest, attracts many tourists.
* The Barbès market is located on Boulevard de la Chapelle, under the overhead metro viaduct.
* Le Louxor cinema, fully restored in 2013, has a terrace overlooking the metro station.
* The Lariboisière Hospital, establishment of the Assistance Publique–Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP), is to the south-east of the station.

<doc id="502686" wikidata="Q687082" url="?curid=502686" title="William Richardson Davie">
<text>William Richardson Davie (June 20, 1756 – November 29, 1820) was an American statesman, politician, military general, Founding Father of the United States who served as the 10th Governor of North Carolina from 1798 to 1799. A member of the Federalist Party, Davie also served as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention as a representative of North Carolina. He is also one of the key founders of the University of North Carolina.

==Early life==
Davie was born in Egremont, County Cumberland in North West England, where his father Archibald Davie, who is listed in the 1790 census as living in Chester, South Carolina, had settled with his mother, Mary Richardson, whose family came from Dumfriesshire, Scotland. He immigrated to the American colonies in 1764 when his father brought him to the Waxhaws region near Lancaster, South Carolina. He was named for his maternal uncle, William Richardson, a prominent Presbyterian minister in South Carolina, and when Richardson died, Davie inherited 1 acre of his land, five enslaved people, and an extensive library. After that, he always used his full name to honor his uncle. Davie was educated by the young Presbyterian teacher Joseph Alexander at Queen&#x27;s Museum, later Liberty Hall, in Charlotte. He then matriculated at Alexander&#x27;s alma mater, the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), graduating in 1776. One of his teachers at Princeton was fellow Carolinian William Churchill Houston. Davie and classmate Jonathan Dayton would serve with Houston as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention, while two other fellow students would also be among the framers: James Madison and Gunning Bedford, Jr.

==Revolutionary War==
After leaving New Jersey, Davie began to study law in Salisbury, North Carolina, under Spruce Macay (pronounced &quot;Muh-coy&quot;), who would later provide Andrew Jackson with legal training. In December 1778, Davie left Salisbury to join 1,200 militiamen led by Brigadier General Allen Jones of Northampton County, NC. Jones&#x27;s force advanced toward Charleston, South Carolina, intending to aid the port city as it prepared its defenses against possible British assault. That threat receded, so Davie and the rest of Jones&#x27;s men returned to North Carolina after marching as far south as Camden, South Carolina.

After briefly resuming his studies in Salisbury, Davie closed his law books again in the spring of 1779 to re-enter military service. This time, though, Davie did not volunteer for an existing force; he helped to raise and train a local cavalry troop. For his work in forming &quot;a Company of Horses in the District of Salisbury,&quot; he received a lieutenant&#x27;s commission in April from North Carolina Governor Richard Caswell.

Davie did not remain in that junior rank for long. In May 1779, he and his company were attached to the legion of General Casimir Pułaski, who moved from Pennsylvania to South Carolina earlier in the year to help bolster American positions in and around Charleston. Promoted to the rank of major under Pulaski, Davie assumed command of a brigade of cavalry. On June 20, 1779, just two days shy of his twenty-third birthday, Davie led a charge against British forces at the Battle of Stono Ferry outside Charleston. He suffered a serious wound to his thigh in that engagement, fell from his horse, and narrowly escaped capture.

While convalescing from his injuries, Davie resumed his legal studies in Salisbury. The citizenry presented him with an honorary sword for his exemplary conduct and courage. Soon he completed or &quot;stood&quot; his examinations and, in November 1779, obtained a license to practice law in South Carolina. In the late spring and summer of the following year, Davie, now fully recovered, formed an independent cavalry company again. He led that mounted force in several actions during the summer of 1780.

Shortly after the Battle of Hanging Rock, Davie received word of a new army moving into South Carolina under General Horatio Gates. Gates was soundly defeated at the Battle of Camden on August 16, 1780. While the Continentals fought hard, his militia largely fled without much, if any, of a fight. Gates and what remained of his army fell back into North Carolina. Davie narrowly missed the battle. Instead of retreating north along with Gates and the remnants of the American army, Davie moved south towards the enemy and Camden to recover supply wagons and gather intelligence on enemy movements. In the time between Camden and the Battle of Kings Mountain, in October 1780, Davie&#x27;s cavalry was the only unbroken corps between the British army and what was left of the Continental forces.

Davie&#x27;s most audacious action as a cavalry officer came at the Battle of Charlotte on September 26, 1780. Ordered to cover the American army retreat and hinder the British invasion of North Carolina, Davie, now a colonel, and 150 of his mounted militia set up a defense in what was then the small village of Charlotte, North Carolina. He dismounted several of his men and had them take station behind a stone wall at the summit of a hill in the center of town. Other dismounted soldiers were scattered on the flanks with a reserve of cavalry.

At about noon, the British army under General Lord Cornwallis appeared. Cornwallis&#x27; forces numbered at least 2,000 Redcoats and loyalists. After three charges of British cavalry and infantry moving on his right flank, Davie and his men retreated northward. Cornwallis subsequently occupied Charlotte, but he remained there less than two weeks, withdrawing his forces from the &quot;hornets&#x27; nest&quot; after receiving news of the defeat of Loyalist forces by backcountry militia at the Battle of Kings Mountain on October 7, 1780. As Cornwallis&#x27;s army marched back toward South Carolina, Davie directed his men to shadow and skirmish with enemy units and to disrupt and intercept their communications.

Davie&#x27;s military service in the Revolution changed dramatically after December 1780, when General Nathanael Greene arrived in North Carolina to take command of the American army in the &quot;Southern Department&quot;. Headquartered in Charlotte, Greene desperately needed more provisions and equipment for his soldiers as he prepared to counter the inevitable return of Cornwallis to North Carolina. Davie&#x27;s leadership skills and knowledge of the region&#x27;s terrain and inhabitants impressed Greene. In January 1781, he persuaded the experienced cavalry officer to relinquish his field command to serve as the army&#x27;s commissary-general. In that position, Davie spent the final stages of the war carrying out the crucial but often thankless tasks of locating, organizing, and transporting supplies, often using his funds for General Greene&#x27;s ever-needy troops and North Carolina&#x27;s militia.

During the Revolutionary War, he was with the North Carolina militia and State troops from 1780 to 1782. He was a Lieutenant, Captain, and Major in South Carolina and North Carolina militias. On September 5, 1780, he was selected as commander of the newly created NC State Cavalry-Western District. On January 16, 1781, he was appointed by the Board of War as Commissary General for the State per request of Maj. Gen. Nathanael Greene, replacing Col. Thomas Polk, who had resigned. On February 13, 1781, the North Carolina General Assembly confirmed this position officially, which was eliminated in May 1782. He was at the Battle of Wahab&#x27;s Plantation in South Carolina and the Battle of Charlotte.
* Lieutenant in the Rowan County Regiment of the North Carolina militia (1779)
* Captain in the North Carolina Light Dragoons Regiment (1779)
* Major in the 2nd Mecklenburg County Regiment of the North Carolina militia (1779–1780)
* Major over the Independent Corps of Light Horse (1780)
* Colonel over the North Carolina State Cavalry-Western District (1780)
* Commissary General for North Carolina (1781–1782)

==Post-war service==
After the war, Davie became a traveling circuit court lawyer and orator in North Carolina. He was elected to the North Carolina House of Commons on multiple occasions from 1786 through 1798. He served as a delegate to the 1787 Constitutional Convention, where he was instrumental in breaking the deadlock over state representation in Congress in what is known as the Great Compromise, brokered by Connecticut&#x27;s Oliver Ellsworth. Davie persuaded his state&#x27;s delegation to support the compromise or the 3/5th rule, allowing proportional representation in the House but equal representation for each state in the Senate, thus placing a majority of states in favor and avoiding a possible collapse of the convention. Davie strongly supported the Three-fifths Compromise, because it benefited him, Goudy, and Jones, who relied on the people they enslaved to work their fields and maintain their homes. Davie returned to North Carolina before the Constitution was signed, but he argued for its passage at the North Carolina State Conventions in 1788 and 1789.

Davie was elected governor of North Carolina by the North Carolina General Assembly in 1798. During his administration, the state settled boundary disputes with South Carolina and Tennessee to the west. He resigned as the state&#x27;s chief executive when President John Adams enlisted him in 1799 to serve on a peace commission to France, where bilateral negotiations resulted in the Convention of 1800.

Davie remained active in the state militia and the newly formed United States Army. He served in the state militia during the 1797 crisis with France (immediately preceding the Quasi-War) and was appointed brigadier general in the Army by President Adams. After his return to North Carolina, Davie continued to be active in Federalist politics. He ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in 1800 against David Stone, and for the United States House of Representatives against Willis Alston in the 1803 and 1804 elections. (Alston, elected as a Federalist in 1798, joined the Democratic-Republican Party during the Jefferson administration).

==Founding the University of North Carolina==

As a North Carolina General Assembly member, Davie sponsored the bill that chartered the University of North Carolina. Davie laid the cornerstone of the university in October 1793 in a full Masonic ceremony as he was the Grand Master of the North Carolina Grand Lodge at the time.

He is recognized as the university&#x27;s founder and served on its board of trustees from 1789 to 1807. Davie also received the institution&#x27;s first honorary degree in 1811, an LL.D., and was given the title &quot;Father of the University&quot;. The &quot;Davie Poplar&quot; tree on the campus is, as legend has it, where Davie tied his horse in the early 1790s to pick out the site for the state&#x27;s first university. A portrait of Davie hangs in the chambers of the Dialectic Society, the oldest student organization at the university.

In October 2013, the sword and pocket watch of Davie were displayed at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as part of the commemoration celebrating the role of Freemasons in the establishment of the first public university in the United States.

==Later life==

After his unsuccessful run for the House of Representatives, Davie retired from public life to his estate, Tivoli, in South Carolina. During the 1812 presidential election, Virginia Federalists who refused to support the candidacy of dissident Democratic-Republican DeWitt Clinton against incumbent Democratic-Republican James Madison nominated presidential electors pledged to Rufus King for president and Davie for vice president. A wide margin defeated this Federalist slate. During the War of 1812, Davie served in the army as well, but declined an offer from President James Madison to command the American forces.

Davie was keenly interested in thoroughbred horses. In 1809, he purchased a champion race horse from William Ransom Johnson, a native of North Carolina who was known in American racing circles as &quot;The Napoleon of the Turf&quot;. The horse, Sir Archy sired by Diomed at Mount Airy, cost Davie the then-staggering sum of $5,000. Nearly a century and a half later, in 1955, the stallion was among the first class of horses inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, New York.

Davie died at his Tivoli estate in Chester County, South Carolina in 1820. He was preceded in death by his wife, the former Sarah Jones, daughter of Allen Jones, whom he married in 1782. Davie is buried at Old Waxhaw Presbyterian Church in South Carolina. Sarah, who died at 39 in 1802, is buried in the Old Colonial Cemetery in Halifax, North Carolina.

==Legacy==
Davie County, North Carolina, established in 1836, is named in his memory, as are schools in Davie County and Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina, and a park in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. His Tivoli plantation is now part of the Landsford Canal State Park in Chester County, South Carolina.

The William R. Davie House at Halifax was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

In April 1993, he was reassigned as Boeing deputy for payload operations, Space Station Freedom Program. Buchli currently serves as operations and utilization manager for space station, Boeing Defense and Space Group, at Houston, Texas.

===Space flights===
*STS-51-C flew the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;, and was the first dedicated Department of Defense mission. Launched January 24, 1985, from Kennedy Space Center, STS-51-C performed its mission to deploy a modified Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) vehicle from the Space Shuttle. Landing occurred on January 27, 1985, after slightly more than three days on orbit, ending a mission lasting 73 hours, 33 minutes, and 27 seconds.
*STS-61-A, launched October 30, 1985, and landing November 6, saw the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; perform a West German D-1 Spacelab mission. It was the first to carry eight crew members, then the largest crew to fly in space, and the first in which payload activities were controlled from outside the United States. More than 75 scientific experiments were completed in the areas of physiological sciences, materials processing, biology, and navigation, and the mission duration was 168 hours, 44 minutes, and 51 seconds.
*STS-29, flew the &quot;Discovery&quot; from March 13, 1989, to March 18, a five-day mission during which the crew deployed a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, and performed numerous secondary experiments, including a space station &quot;heat pipe&quot; radiator experiment, two student experiments, a protein crystal growth experiment, and a chromosome and plant cell division experiment. In addition, the crew took over 3,000 photographs of the Earth using several types of cameras, including the IMAX 70 mm movie camera, during the 119 hours, 39 minutes, 40 second mission.
*STS-48, from September 12, to September 18, 1991, was a five-day mission during which the crew of the &quot;Discovery&quot; deployed the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) designed to provide scientists with their first complete data set on the upper atmosphere&#x27;s chemistry, winds, and energy inputs. The crew also conducted numerous secondary experiments ranging from growing protein crystals, to studying how fluids and structures react in weightlessness. Mission duration was 128 hours, 27 minutes; 34 seconds.

==Awards and decorations==
Buchli is a recipient of the Defense Superior Service Medal, Legion of Merit, Purple Heart, Defense Meritorious Service Medal, Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal and Vietnam Gallantry Cross with silver star. He is a 2019 inductee into the United States Astronaut Hall of Fame. Buchli was the 49th recipient of the Theodore Roosevelt Rough Rider Award on July 30, 2024.

<text>Artemisia vulgaris, commonly known as mugwort, common mugwort, or wormwood, is a species of flowering plant in the daisy family Asteraceae. It is one of several species in the genus &quot;Artemisia&quot; commonly known as mugwort, although &quot;Artemisia vulgaris&quot; is the species most often called mugwort. Mugworts have been used medicinally and as culinary herbs.

==Description==
&quot;Artemisia vulgaris&quot; is an aromatic, herbaceous, perennial plant that grows to in height. It spreads through vegetative expansion and the anthropogenic dispersal of root rhizome fragments—the plant rarely reproduces from seeds in temperate regions, as few seeds capable of germinating are produced by plants. Mugwort cannot easily be controlled by being ploughed into the soil, as sections of the plant&#x27;s rhizomes move away from the parent plant if the soil is disturbed, causing the number of new plants to increase.
The stems are purple-looking and angular. The pinnate leaves are smooth and of a dark green tint on the upper surface. They have dense, whitish tomentose hairs on the underside, are glabrous on the upperside, and have lobes that are approximately wide. New leaves are opposite and are attached to the stem with a thin, long petiole. They are rounded, lack lobes, and are woolly-looking underneath.

The yellow or reddish-looking flower heads, which appear from July to September, are arranged paniculate branching structure. They are long and radially symmetrical. The outer flowers in each capitulum are female and the inner ones bisexual. &quot;A. vulgaris&quot; flowers from midsummer to early autumn. The brown rectangular-shaped fruit has one seed, and has ridges, a narrow base, and tiny bristles on the end.

The root system consists of numerous horizontal branched rhizomes from which adventitious roots are produced. As many as new 20 stems can grow from one root system. The main brown woody root, which is about long, has rootlets long, and approximately thick.

Margaret Grieve, in her &quot;A Modern Herbal&quot; (first published in 1931), described the taste as &quot;sweetish and acrid&quot;, but contact with the plant or consuming the beverage made from it is thought to be a cause dermatitis.

===Name===
The name &quot;mugwort&quot; is thought to have come from its use of as a method of giving flavour to beer. According to Grieve, &quot;mugwort&quot; may have been derived from &quot;moughte&quot; (a term for a moth or maggot), &quot;because from the days of Dioscorides, the plant has been regarded, in common with Wormwood, as useful in keeping off the attacks of moths&quot;.

The Ukrainian name for mugwort, (or more commonly , &#x27;common artemisia&#x27;) transliterates as &quot;black stalk&quot;. The Ukrainian city of Chernobyl gets its name from the plant.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Artemisia vulgaris&quot; is native to temperate Europe, Asia, North Africa, and Alaska, and is naturalized in North America, where some consider it an invasive weed. It is a common plant growing in places containing low-nitrogen soils, such as waste places, roadsides and uncultivated areas. The plant, which prefers alkaline conditions, readily becomes established in open, sandy ground.

The plant rarely reproduces from seeds in temperate regions, as few seeds capable of germinating are produced by plants, and the species mainly reproduces from rhizomes. Mugwort cannot easily be controlled by being ploughed into the soil, as sections of the plant&#x27;s rhizomes move away from the parent plant if the soil is disturbed, causing the number of new plants to increase.

==Ecology==
Several species of Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) such as &quot;Ostrinia scapulalis&quot; feed on the leaves and flowers of the plant. It is possibly susceptible to being attacked by honey fungus.
==Uses==

In the Middle Ages, mugwort was called , as it was believed that the 1st century preacher John the Baptist wore a girdle made from the plant. According to Grieve, mugwort was believed to protect travellers from exhaustion, heatstroke, and wild animals; it was worn on St. John&#x27;s Eve to gain security from evil spirits.

Before the introduction of hops in the beer-making process, &quot;A. vulgaris&quot; was once commonly used in England as the flavouring agent. Dried mugwort flowers were added to malt liquor, and this was added to the beer. Mugwort has been used as one of the traditional flavouring and bittering agents of gruit ales, a type of unhopped, fermented grain beverage. In Vietnam as well as in Germany, mugwort is used in cooking as an aromatic herb. In China, the crunchy stalks of young shoots of &quot;A. vulgaris&quot; are a seasonal vegetable often used in stir fries. In Nepal, the plant is used as an offering to the gods, for cleansing the environment (by sweeping floors or hanging a bundle outside the home), as incense, and also as a medicinal plant.

The dried leaves can be smoked or used to make a tea, to promote lucid dreaming. This supposed oneirogenic effect is reported to be due to the thujone contained in the plant.

=== Pharmacological uses===
Historically, &quot;A. vulgaris&quot; was referred to as the &quot;mother of herbs&quot; during the Middle Ages, and has been widely used in the traditional Chinese, European, and Hindu medicine. It possesses a wide range of supposed pharmacological uses, including anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, hepatoprotective, antispasmolytic, antinociceptive, antibacterial, antihypertensive, antihyperlipidemic, and antifungal properties.

== Phytochemical constituents ==
&quot;A. vulgaris&quot; houses a variety of phytochemicals which are responsible for its pharmacological properties. The phytochemicals belong to classes including flavonoids, essential oils, phenolic acids, coumarins, sterols, carotenoids, vitamins, and sesquiterpene lactones, among many others. Examples of the phytochemicals include vulgarin, artemisinin, scopoletin, camphene, camphor, sabinene, and some derivatives of quercetin and kaempferol.

<doc id="502690" wikidata="Q1577103" url="?curid=502690" title="La Chapelle station">
<text>La Chapelle () is a station on Paris Métro Line 2, on the border of the 10th and 18th arrondissements above the Boulevard de la Chapelle. The station is connected to the Gare du Nord and the Gare du Nord Métro station on lines 4 and 5.

It should not be confused with the Porte de la Chapelle station, located further north.

==Location==
The station is located above Boulevard de la Chapelle at the intersection with Rue du Faubourg-Saint-Denis and Rue Marx-Dormoy.

==History==

The elevated line 2 station was opened on 31 January 1903 as part of the extension of line 2 from Anvers to &quot;Bagnolet&quot; (now called Alexandre Dumas). It is named after the &quot;Place de la Chapelle&quot;, which was named after the &quot;Barrière de la Chapelle&quot;, a gate built for the collection of taxation as part of the Wall of the Farmers-General; the gate was built between 1784 and 1788 and demolished after 1859. The gate was named after a village that was annexed by Paris in 1860 and was named after a chapel to Saint Genevieve built in the 6th century.

Since 1993, a long connecting corridor has connected it to the underground part of the Gare du Nord.

During the summer of 2012, the station closed for two and a half months in order to replace the original canopies with identical ones, which protect passengers from the weather.

At the end of 2017, access to the station was known to be congested, the RATP agreed to launch preliminary studies to create a third access.

In 2019, 6,534,340 travelers entered this station which places it at the 48th position of the metro stations for its usage.

===Project===
In a study carried out by the l&#x27;Atelier Parisien d&#x27;Urbanisme (Parisian Urban Planning Workshop) during May 2012, it hypothesized the possibility of an extension of the tram tracks of the T8 line, southwest of Gare Rosa-Parks, towards the Gare de Paris-Est, using the tracks next to the RER E. It would be carried out as part of the redevelopment of an enlarged area of Paris northeast. It would run alongside the ZAC Pajol, serve the La Chapelle metro station on line 2 and therefore end at the Gare de l&#x27;Est.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has two entrances to the west end of the station, located on the central reservation of Boulevard de la Chapelle, on either side of the metro viaduct.

There is a connection to Gare du Nord through a tunnel between the metro station and the RER station.

===Station layout===


===Platforms===
The station platforms, overhead, located on a viaduct, are a standard configuration with two platforms separated by metro tracks. They are fitted with awnings, like all the elevated stations on the line. The lighting is carried out thanks to two unique light canopies of neon lights. The upper walls are made of transparent stained glass (unlike the other elevated stations of the line, which are frosted) surmounting the lower walls that covered with white and flat ceramic tiles. The platforms, devoid of advertising, are fitted with blue &quot;Motte&quot; style seats and the name of the station is inscribed in Parisine font on enameled plates.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by lines 35, 38, 45, 48, 302 and La Traverse Ney-Flandre (519) of the RATP Bus Network and, at night, by line N43 of the Noctilien.

==Nearby==
The Théâtre des Bouffes du Nord, located on Boulevard de la Chapelle, is opposite the station.

<doc id="502692" wikidata="Q600526" url="?curid=502692" title="Samuel Ashe (North Carolina governor)">
<text>Samuel Ashe (March 24, 1725February 3, 1813) was the ninth governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina from 1795 to 1798. He was also one of the first three judges of the North Carolina Superior Court in 1787.

==Life story==
Ashe was born in Beaufort in the Province of North Carolina. His father, John Baptista Ashe, and brother, John Ashe, both served as Speaker of the North Carolina Assembly, or House of Burgesses. Ashe became an orphan at the age of nine. He married Mary Porter in 1748; they had three children, including John Baptista Ashe, who would serve in the Continental Congress. After Mary died, Ashe remarried, this time to the former Elizabeth Merrik.

Ashe studied law and was named Assistant Attorney for the Crown in the Wilmington district of the colony.

He became involved in the revolutionary movement and served in the North Carolina Provincial Congress and as a member of the North Carolina militia. For a little more than one month in 1776, Ashe served as president of the Council of Safety, the state&#x27;s executive authority. He was also appointed to the committee that drafted the first Constitution of North Carolina. In 1776, he was elected to the new North Carolina Senate and was elected its first speaker. The following year, Ashe was appointed presiding judge of the state Superior Court, a post he held until 1795.

During the American Revolution, Ashe served as lieutenant and paymaster of the 1st North Carolina Continental Regiment from September 1775 until he resigned on April 16, 1776. He later served as a captain of the First Troop of North Carolina Continental Dragoon Regiment from March 1777 until the regiment was disbanded on January 1, 1779.

In 1795, the General Assembly elected him governor at 70. He served three one-year terms, the maximum constitutional limit, before retiring in 1798. Ashe was active in politics after his term as governor, serving as a member of the United States Electoral College in 1804, when his fellow Democrat-Republican, Thomas Jefferson, was reelected over Federalist Charles C. Pinckney.

==Namesakes and family==
Ashe County and the cities of Asheville and Asheboro in North Carolina are named in his honor.

Ashe was a slave owner, and one such person, Amar, was a West African woman kidnapped and brought to America in 1735 aboard a ship called The Doddington. Legendary tennis player Arthur Ashe was a direct descendant of Amar.

Ashe&#x27;s grandson, William Ashe, was a Confederate soldier in the American Civil War and a son of John B. and the former Eliza Hay. He was killed at Shiloh in Tennessee in 1862, a battle in which William&#x27;s brother, Samuel Swann Ashe, also fought.

The Gov. Samuel Ashe Grave near Rocky Point, North Carolina was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.

<doc id="502693" wikidata="Q20714" url="?curid=502693" title="Suwon">
<text>Suwon (; ) is the largest city and capital of Gyeonggi Province, South Korea&#x27;s most populous province. The city lies approximately south of the national capital, Seoul. With a population of 1.2 million, Suwon has more inhabitants than Ulsan, though it enjoys a lesser degree of self-governance as a &#x27;special case city&#x27;.

Traditionally known as the &#x27;City of Filial Piety&#x27;, modern Suwon retains a variety of historical landmarks. As a walled city, it is a popular destination for day-trippers from Seoul, with the wall itself—Hwaseong Fortress—receiving 1½ million visits in 2015.

Suwon plays an important economic role as it is home to Samsung Electronics, Korea&#x27;s largest and most profitable company. The company&#x27;s research and development centre is in Yeongtong District in eastern Suwon, where its headquarters have also been located since 2016. Samsung&#x27;s prominence in Suwon is clear: the company is partnered with Sungkyunkwan University, which has a campus in the city; it also owns the professional football team Suwon Samsung Bluewings. This team has won the K League four times and the Asian Super Cup twice. The city is also home to the K League 1 team Suwon FC and the KBO League baseball team KT Wiz.

Suwon houses several well-known universities, most notably Sungkyunkwan University and Ajou University. It is served by three expressways, the national railway network, and three lines on the Seoul Metropolitan Subway.

== Name ==
&quot;Suwon&quot; means literally &quot;water source&quot;. The area has gone by different names since antiquity, but almost all of them have this meaning. The name originally comes from the name of the statelet , from around the Proto–Three Kingdoms period. Afterwards, the area and what is now Hwaseong were together called &quot;Maehol&quot;, &quot;Maetkol&quot;, or &quot;Mulgol&quot; (). In , the name was changed to &quot;Susŏng-gun&quot; (), in order to disambiguate it from another territory with a similar-sounding name. In 940, its name was changed to &quot;Su-ju&quot; (). In the 11th century, it went by either &quot;Susŏng&quot; (different Hanja: ) or &quot;Hannam&quot; (). In 1310, it received the name &quot;Suwon&quot;.

In English, the name was formerly often spelt .

== History ==

=== Early history ===
The area now corresponding to Suwon has been inhabited since at latest the early Bronze Age. Artifacts from that period to the early Iron Age have been found in the area, and include objects such as pottery, sculpture, and arrowheads. One location these materials have been found is at , which is now a .

During the Three Kingdoms of Korea period, the area was described as being of the territory of the statelet Mosuguk, part of the Mahan confederacy. The area came under the influence of Goguryeo in the late 5th century CE, and then later became part of Unified Silla (668–935).

It became part of Goryeo after a military campaign led by King Taejo. In the 13th and 14th centuries, the area was promoted, demoted, merged, and made part of various administrative districts. The area then became a part of Joseon upon its founding, and in 1395 was made an administrative center of Gyeonggi Province.

Until the late 18th century, Suwon&#x27;s administrative centre was in modern-day Annyeong-dong at the foot of Hwasan (a hill in Hwasan-dong, Hwaseong). In 1796, King Jeongjo relocated it to its current location at the foot of Paldalsan. To protect this new city, he commanded the building of Hwaseong Fortress—a protective wall around the town.

An 1899 administrative report had the population at 49,708 people in 12,579 households.

===Japanese colonial period===
During the 1910–1945 Japanese colonial period, a number of prominent Korean independence activists came from or operated in Suwon. and Yi Sŏn-gyŏng () were both arrested for their activities.

===Liberation to Korean War periods===
On 15 August 1949, Suwon was promoted from a county to a city, with some of its former territory made into Hwaseong County.

When the Korean War began, the United States Air Force 49th Fighter Wing, then stationed in Japan, was sent to Korea with an initial mission of evacuating civilians from Suwon and Gimpo. While on this mission, on 1950, US planes in Suwon were attacked by North Korean fighters. The ensuing Battle of Suwon Airfield became the first aerial combat of the war. Suwon Airfield was attacked again two days later while General Douglas MacArthur was on site. Though the US repelled both attacks, Suwon fell to the advancing North Koreans one week later, on 1950. The following day saw the first land conflict between United States and North Korean forces, the Battle of Osan.

North Korean troops were not the only threat to life: in the early days of the war, southern authorities feared left-leaning civilians, and many were killed. Suwon was a site of such killings: eyewitness account from US intelligence officer Donald Nichols places Suwon as the location of a massacre of approximately 1,800 in late June 1950.

Suwon was retaken, fell again to the North, before being recaptured for the final time. In total, the city changed hands four times during the war.

While under southern authority, Suwon hosted forces from several countries. For example, on 1950, the Greek Expeditionary Force relocated from Busan to Suwon, attached to the US 1st Cavalry Division. The city also appeared strategically important, as in late 1951, the US Air Force&#x27;s top fighter pilot Gabby Gabreski was placed in charge of Suwon Air Base.


A memorial to French forces was erected in 1974 near the Yeongdong Expressway&#x27;s North Suwon exit. This was renovated in 2013.

===Recent history===
In 1964, the headquarters of Gyeonggi Province began a process of relocation from Seoul to Suwon. Seoul had left the province in 1949. When the construction of the headquarters was completed on 23 June 1967, the date was set as a new annual holiday: Suwon Citizen&#x27;s Day (). The Hwahong Cultural Festival (now ) was established to celebrate the occasion.

Suwon has experienced a number of administrative territory changes since the 1960s. In 1963, Suwon expanded greatly as 20 villages were incorporated from Hwaseong-gun. In 1983, two more villages were acquired from Yongin. In 1987, Suwon expanded westwards, acquiring another two villages from Hwaseong. Gwonseon District and Paldal District were established in 1988. It received more territory from Hwaseong and Yongin in 1994, and again from Hwaseong in 1995. It established Yeongtong District in 2003.

In preparation for the construction of a new planned city Gwanggyo, there were two-way exchanges of land between Suwon and Yongin in 2007 and 2019. Suwon&#x27;s most recent land exchange occurred in 2020, when it swapped some land parcels with Hwaseong.

==Geography==
Suwon lies in the north of the Gyeonggi plain, south of the national capital, Seoul. It is bordered by the cities of Uiwang to the north-west, Yongin to the east, Hwaseong to the south-west, and Ansan to the west. Suwon is near the Yellow Sea coast: at its closest point, on the Chilbosan ridge to the west, Suwon lies from Ueumdo in Sihwa Lake, a coastal inlet cordoned off to drive the world&#x27;s largest tidal power station.

===Geology and topography===
Suwon is primarily composed of Precambrian metamorphic rock. It has amphibolites that intrude through these, and also granites from the Mesozoic Era.

Most of Suwon is composed of biotite granite (Jbgr) from the Jurassic period. This granite is centred on Paldalsan. A form of Daebo granite, this rock is distributed through Homaesil-dong, Geumgok-dong, Dangsu-dong, Seryu-dong, Seodun-dong, Gwonseon-dong, and other areas. Its main constituent minerals are quartz, plagioclase, orthotic, biotite, and amphibole.

Precambrian biotite gneiss (PCEbgn) is found in northern Suwon, specifically Pajang-dong, Gwanggyo-dong, Woncheon-dong, and Maetan-dong. Visible rocks here are composed of quartz, feldspar, biotite, amphibole, and muscovite; and are generally dark grey or dark green. Mesozoic biotite granite intrudes through these.

Precambrian quartzo-feldspathic gneiss (PCEqgn) is distributed in some mountainous areas in Hagwanggyo-dong and Sanggwanggyo-dong in northern Suwon. This gneiss has primarily undergone silicification, and is mainly composed of quartz, feldspar, biotite, and muscovite. It is grey, grey-brown, and white.

Suwon&#x27;s single tectonic fault splits from the Singal Fault in Iui-dong, creating the Woncheonri Stream. The stream follows the fault through Ha-dong, Woncheon-dong, and Maetan-dong till it joins the Hwangguji Stream in Annyeong-dong, Hwaseong. This is a -long vertical fault running SSW, eventually to the Yellow Sea. In Suwon, biotite gneiss and biotite granite are brought into contact by the fault.

While the low-lying fault sits in the south of Suwon, the north is hillier: the city&#x27;s highest point is Gwanggyosan () on the border with Yongin.

===Streams and lakes===
Most of Suwon&#x27;s streams originate on Gwanggyosan or other nearby peaks. Since the city is bounded to the north by Gwanggyosan, to the west by Chilbosan, and to the east by other hills, the streams, chiefly the Hwanggujicheon, Suwoncheon, Seohocheon, and Woncheollicheon, flow southwards. After merging, they eventually empty into the Yellow Sea at Asan Bay. The entirety of Suwon is drained in this manner.

Several of Suwon&#x27;s streams feature lakes. Since there are few natural lakes on the Korean mainland, Suwon&#x27;s lakes are in fact small reservoirs. These 11 reservoirs are , otherwise known as Seoho () near Hwaseo Station; Irwol Reservoir () near Sungkyunkwan University; Bambat Reservoir () near Sungkyunkwan University Station; , otherwise known as Irwang Reservoir () in Manseok Park; Pajang Reservoir () near the North Suwon exit of the Yeongdong Expressway; () and Hagwanggyo Reservoir () at the foot of Gwanggyosan; Woncheon and Sindae Reservoirs (, ) in Gwanggyo Lake Park; and Geumgok Reservoir (), a small lake at the foot of Chilbosan. Irwang Reservoir (Manseokkeo) has been designated a world heritage site for irrigation. Wangsong Reservoir (), on the border with Uiwang, used to be partly in Suwon, but after controversial boundary changes, it is now entirely in Uiwang.

===Climate===
Suwon has both a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfa&quot;), and a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cwa&quot;).

The city is prone to occasional flooding: the 1998 flood caused the death of a US soldier, and of rain fell in 24 hours in 2010.

===Administrative divisions===


The city is composed of four &quot;gu&quot; (districts). Jangan District () and Gwonseon District () were established on 1988. On 1993, parts of Jangan District and Gwonseon District became a new district, Paldal District (). The newest district is Yeongtong District (), which separated from Paldal District on 2003. These districts are in turn divided into 42 &quot;dong&quot;.

Suwon has several new &#x27;towns&#x27;, e.g., Homaesil and Gwanggyo. The latter is perhaps the most notable of these: the first stage of its construction was completed in 2011.

==Demography==
Suwon is 50.3% male (49.7% female), and 2.9% foreign. On average, there are 2.3 residents per household. Further details for each district are shown below (figures from 31 December 2023).
===Religion===

The Catholic Diocese of Suwon was created in 1963 by Pope Paul VI. The cathedral—St Joseph&#x27;s—is at Jeongja-dong.

Suwon is the birthplace of the former president of the Baptist World Alliance, Kim Janghwan (Billy Kim). Mr founded the Suwon Central Baptist Church, though this is located in Yongin.

Mireukdang (), a small shrine to Maitreya, is located in Pajang-dong. This has a religious basis fusing Buddhism and traditional local religions.

===Crime===
Illegal dumping of household waste has been a problem in Suwon, and the city council has addressed this by increasing urban greenery. This approach appears to have reduced the scale of the problem.
==Education==

There are several universities and colleges in Suwon. These include Sungkyunkwan University&#x27;s Natural Sciences Campus, Kyonggi University, Ajou University, Dongnam Health University, Gukje Cyber University, Hapdong Theological Seminary, and Suwon Women&#x27;s University. Despite their names, the University of Suwon and Suwon Science College are not actually in Suwon, but in neighbouring Hwaseong. Seoul National University&#x27;s agriculture campus was located in Suwon until 2005; it is now in Seoul.

Suwon has 44 high schools, 57 middle schools, 100 primary schools, and 180 kindergartens. Three schools are dedicated to special education: Jahye School ( Tap-dong), Suwon Seokwang School ( Imok-dong), and Areum School ( Iui-dong). Special education is also provided in some regular schools, e.g., Suwonbuk Middle School ( Yeonghwa-dong). There is also a centre for lifelong learning at Kyemyung High School ( Imok-dong), and there are two international schools in the city: Gyeonggi Suwon International School and Suwon Chinese International School ()

==Environment==

Throughout South Korea, water management is a challenge. Suwon is 11% self-sufficient in its use of water, and plans to increase this to 50% through rainwater harvesting, including building retention facilities; and by treating and reusing sewage.

Air pollution in Suwon appears to be from a range of industrial and other sources, with origins of coarse particulate matter (PM10) shown in the pie chart.
==Industry==
The largest employer in Suwon is Samsung Electronics, which was founded in the city in 1969. Its headquarters remain in Suwon, located today with the company&#x27;s large R&amp;D complex in Maetan-dong. Samsung&#x27;s presence in the city can be seen through its sponsorship of local sports teams such as Suwon Samsung Bluewings Football Club and two of the oldest domestic basketball teams—Samsung Thunders and Samsung Life Blueminx—both of which have since left Suwon. Other major companies in Suwon include SK Chemical, Samsung SDI, and Samsung Electro-Mechanics.

* Samsung Electronics On September 1, 1973, Samsung Electronics moved its headquarters from Euljiro, Seoul to Suwon. This was to establish an electronic components facility process with Japan&#x27;s SANYO Electric Co., Ltd. As a result, the status of Suwon City grew along with the growth of Samsung Electronics.

==Landmarks==

===Hwaseong Fortress===

Hwaseong Fortress, built under the orders of King Jeongjo in 1796, is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The entire city used to be encircled by the fortress walls, but Suwon has long since expanded far beyond this boundary. There are four main gates in the walls, and Haenggung Palace lies in the centre of the fortress.

Hwaseong was built under the guidance of philosopher Jeong Yak-yong. Workers were paid for their labour for one of the first times in Korea&#x27;s history, corvée labour having been common previously. Construction details were meticulously recorded in the text &quot;Hwaseong Seongyeok Uigwe&quot; (). This document was invaluable after the Korean War: reconstruction efforts from 1964 to the present day have relied heavily on this.

===Hyanggyo===
Suwon Hyanggyo () was a government-run school and Confucian ceremonial centre during the Goryeo and Joseon periods. During the Joseon Dynasty, it was the largest and oldest state school in Gyeonggi Province. The school was originally built in 1291 beside Hwasan in Wau-ri, Hwaseong-gun. It was moved to its current location at Gyo-dong around 1795, when Hwaseong Fortress was built. The school houses memorial tablets to Confucius, Mencius, and 25 Korean figures noteworthy to Confucianism. It is open to the public on weekdays from till , but it is closed at weekends.

===Bugugwon===
Bugugwon (), built prior to 1923, is a cultural centre at Gyo-dong. There is no record of the 85.95 m2 building&#x27;s construction, but exterior photographs were published in 1923. Under Japanese rule, the building was the headquarters of Bugugwon Co., Ltd., which sold agricultural products such as fertilizers. After liberation, from 1952 to 1956, it temporarily housed the Suwon Court and the Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office. From 1957 to 1960, it was used as the Suwon City Education Support Office, and in 1974 the Republican Party used it as their Gyeonggi Province base. In 1979, the Suwon Arts Foundation was based here, and in 1981 it became an internal medicine clinic. Since 2018, it has been a public cultural space.

=== Adams Memorial Hall ===
 served as a focal point for the independence movement. The building was constructed in 1923 under Pastor William Noble with funding from various sources, including a church in the United States, Suwon Jongno Church, and local residents. Here, independence activists including Park and Lee met weekly to discuss their activities.

==Culture and contemporary life==

===Housing===
As is typical of urban South Korea, Suwon has many apartment complexes. The city has been affected greatly by real estate price fluctuations.

===Food===
Suwon is known for Suwon galbi, a variation on beef ribs enjoyed throughout Korea.

===Sport===

Suwon World Cup Stadium was built for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Today, it is home to the K League 2 team Suwon Samsung Bluewings. Local rivals Suwon FC and Suwon FC Women play in K League 1 and WK League respectively. They both play home matches at Suwon Sports Complex.

Since 2013, Suwon has been home to the professional baseball team KT Wiz. The team played at Sungkyunkwan University until Suwon Baseball Stadium remodelling was completed in time for their elevation to the KBO League in 2015. The stadium was previously the home of the Hyundai Unicorns, who folded after the 2007 season.

Two of the Korean Basketball League and Women&#x27;s Korean Basketball League&#x27;s oldest teams, Samsung Thunders and Samsung Life Blueminx respectively, used to be based in Suwon. Samsung Thunders relocated to Jamsil Arena in Seoul in 2001, while four years later, Samsung Life moved to Yongin. Top-flight men&#x27;s basketball returned to Suwon in 2021, when KT Sonicboom relocated from Busan to the renamed Suwon KT Sonicboom Arena (formerly Seosuwon Chilbo Gymnasium).

The 5,145-capacity Suwon Gymnasium is home to the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s V-League volleyball teams Suwon KEPCO Vixtorm and Suwon Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction Hillstate respectively. The gymnasium staged the handball events in the 1988 Summer Olympics. It also hosted handball and table tennis at the 2014 Asian Games and hosted the 2010 Judo World Cup.

===Museums===
Suwon has two national museums. The National Map Museum of Korea houses a collection of 33,598 maps. It is located at Woncheon-dong. Admission is free, and the museum opens daily from to Suwon&#x27;s second national museum, the National Agricultural Museum of Korea, opened by Seoho Lake in December 2022. It is located at Seodun-dong, admission is free, and it is open daily from till 

There are also a number of smaller museums in Suwon. For example, Suwon Hwaseong Museum, at Maehyang-dong, features exhibits contextualising and explaining the construction of Hwaseong. Another smaller museum, Haewoojae, has gathered some international attention. Built privately in 2007 at Imok-dong, this museum is dedicated to the history of toilets. Ownership of Haewoojae was transferred to the city council in 2009.

===Libraries===
Suwon Central Library opened in 1980 at Gyo-dong. Today, the city has 27 public libraries: seven in Gwonseon District, five in Jangan District, six in Paldal District, and nine in Yeongtong District. The council also plans to build another in Imok-dong.

===Parks and gardens===

Suwon has two municipal arboreta: Irwol Arboretum () and Yeongheung Arboretum (). These opened simultaneously on 2023 beside Irwol Reservoir and Yeongheung Park respectively. The Irwol Arboretum features 429,000 plants of 52,000 species, while Yeongheung Arboretum hosts 118,000 plants of 42,000 species over . There are also 338 parks scattered through the city. Some of these, e.g., Gwanggyo Lake Park, Seoho Park, Irwol Park, and Manseok Park, contain sizeable lakes.

===Street art===
Haenggung-dong and Ji-dong in central Suwon are known for their murals, while Haenggung-dong streets have a variety of other artistic features such as optical illusions.

===Media===
Newspapers based in Suwon include the Kyeonggi Ilbo () in Jangan District, and the Kyeongin Ilbo () and Suwon Daily () in Paldal District.

National broadcaster KBS has a drama studio and art hall in Ingye-dong, Yeongtong District. These are open to visits by appointment.

===Cinemas===
Suwon has several multiplex cinemas: three branches of CGV (in Ha-dong, Ingye-dong, and Jowon-dong); four branches of Lotte Cinema (in Cheoncheon-dong, Geumgok-dong, Iui-dong, and Seodun-dong); and six branches of Megabox (in Gwonseon-dong, Haenggung-dong, Homaesil-dong, Ingye-dong, Jeongja-dong, and Maesan-dong). Other smaller cinemas, which may show fewer foreign films, include Cinema Town, Taehan Theater, Piccadilly Theater, Jungang Theater, Royal Theater, Dano Theater, and Dano Art Hall.

===Retail===

There are several major shopping centres across Suwon, e.g., AK Plaza and Lotte Mall at Suwon Station, and Avenue France and Alleyway in Gwanggyo. Another large centre, Starfield—incorporating its own library and a Megabox cinema—opened beside Hwaseo Station in January 2024. This mall targets a younger customer base, and incorporates pop-up stores. The first pop-up for the popular game &#x27;Brawl Stars&#x27; was held here. The warehouse-style discount store &#x27;Traders&#x27; is located in the basement.

===Public toilets===
In the early 2000s, Suwon City Council strove to improve the condition of its public lavatories, and afterwards ran guided tours of the municipal facilities. Suwon has hosted several international conferences on toilet management, and the World Toilet Association is based in the city.

==Transport==

Suwon Station is served by KTX and other trains on the Gyeongbu Line connecting Seoul to Busan. From 1930 till 1972, the Suryeo Line also connected Suwon to Yeoju, and from 1937 to 1996, the Suin Line ran from Suwon to Incheon. The Suin Line has since been reconstructed as part of the Seoul Metro. Today, three Seoul Metro lines (14 stations) serve Suwon, and there are plans for network expansion. Construction of an extension of the Sinbundang Line to Homaesil is scheduled to begin in 2024. Another planned line—the Dongtan–Indeogwon Line—should create several new stations in Suwon, but this has been delayed, prompting affected cities to call for urgent action.

Suwon is also served by two inter-city bus terminals with nationwide connections: Suwon Bus Terminal near Seryu Station, and West Suwon Bus Terminal in Guun-dong. Nevertheless, bus terminal passenger numbers are decreasing. Suwon is also connected to Seoul and other nearby cities by city and express buses with departure points across the city. In 2017, a new bank of bus stops opened at Suwon Station Transfer Center. This was built to alleviate pressure on existing bus and taxi stands across the tracks. Another transfer centre is incorporated into Gwanggyo Jungang Station; this is underground, and bus stands feature screen doors. Suwon has invested heavily in electric buses—in 2019, it built the country&#x27;s largest bus charging station at Pajang-dong.

Suwon is served by several expressways. The Yeongdong Expressway (50) passes through the city, with two exits within the city limits: North Suwon and East Suwon. The Gwanggyo Sanghyeon exit on the Yongin–Seoul Expressway (171) is on Suwon&#x27;s border with Yongin, and the Pyeongtaek–Paju Expressway (17) also has an exit in Suwon (Geumgok). The Suwon exit of the Gyeongbu Expressway (1) was renamed &quot;Suwon Singal&quot; in 2014 to reflect its actual location in Singal in neighbouring Yongin.

Suwon has invested in ecological transport. The city was the first place in Korea to introduce dockless public bicycles. Traversing Suwon by bicycle is facilitated by numerous cycle paths beside the streams that cut through the city. In 2013, Suwon hosted the EcoMobility World Festival. For one month, streets in Haenggung-dong were closed to cars as a car-free experiment. Residents used non-motorized vehicles provided by the festival organizers. The experiment was not unopposed.

==Military==
Suwon Air Base in Jangji-dong, Gwonseon District was used by the United States Air Force during the Korean War, when it was the scene of the conflict&#x27;s first aerial combat. Today the base is under Republic of Korea Air Force jurisdiction, though it is still managed and maintained by the US military. The US military also maintains Madison Site—a small signals unit with nearby helipad on Gwanggyosan.

==Fauna==

While much of Suwon&#x27;s wildlife can be expected to be similar to that in the surrounding province, two species are worth noting specifically in regard to the city. Firstly, an undisclosed location in Suwon appears to be Korea&#x27;s first recorded breeding site of the white-breasted waterhen. Secondly, the Suwon tree frog—one of three tree frogs to inhabit the Korean peninsula— was discovered in Suwon around 1980, but due to urban sprawl it is no longer found in the city. It has, however, been found recently in Paju, Ansan, and Pyeongtaek (Gyeonggi Province); Eumseong (Chungcheongbuk-do); Gangwon-do; and North Korea. The species is considered endangered.

<text>Richard Dobbs Spaight (March 25, 1758September 6, 1802) was an American Founding Father, politician, planter, and signer of the United States Constitution, who served as a Democratic-Republican U.S. Representative for North Carolina&#x27;s 10th congressional district from 1798 to 1801. Spaight was the eighth governor of North Carolina from 1792 to 1795. He ran for the North Carolina Senate in 1802, and Federalist U.S. Congressman John Stanly campaigned against him as unworthy. Taking offense, Stanly challenged him to a duel on September 5, 1802, in which Stanly shot and mortally wounded Spaight, who died the following day.

==Biography==
Spaight was the father of North Carolina Governor Richard Dobbs Spaight Jr. and the grandfather of U.S. Representative Richard Spaight Donnell.

===Early life===
Spaight was born in New Bern, North Carolina, the son of the secretary of the Crown in the colony and grand-nephew of North Carolina Governor Arthur Dobbs. Orphaned at the age of eight, he was sent to live with his Dobbs relatives at Carrickfergus in Northern Ireland and later followed his cousin Richard Dobbs to the University of Glasgow. During the American Revolutionary War Spaight returned to North Carolina, serving as aide-de-camp to Major General Richard Caswell at the Battle of Camden.

===Political career===

The North Carolina General Assembly elected Spaight a delegate to the Congress of the Confederation between 1782 and 1785; he then served in the North Carolina House of Commons from 1785 to 1787 and was named speaker of the House. In 1787, he was a delegate to the Philadelphia Convention that drafted the U.S. Constitution, and he signed the document when he was 29 years old.

Under the North Carolina Constitution of 1776, Spaight was nominated for governor in 1787 but was defeated by a majority in the General Assembly; he was nominated for the United States Senate in 1789 and was again defeated. In 1788, he was a member of the state convention, which voted not to ratify the Constitution, although Spaight supported ratification. On March 24, 1788, he married Mary Leach, who had the distinction of being the first lady to dance with George Washington at a ball in Washington&#x27;s honor at the Governor&#x27;s Palace, New Bern, in 1791.

Spaight retired from politics for several years because of ill health; he returned to the state House of Representatives in 1792. Also, in 1792, he was elected the first native-born governor of North Carolina and was re-elected by the General Assembly for two further one-year terms. During his term as governor, sites were chosen for the new state capital of Raleigh and the newly chartered University of North Carolina. Spaight was chair of the university&#x27;s board of trustees during his term as governor. He stepped down as governor in 1795, having served the constitutional limit of three one-year terms.

Spaight was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1798, filling the unexpired term of Nathan Bryan, whom Spaight previously lost to in 1796; he was elected to a two-year term in 1799, serving until 1801, and though elected as a Federalist, his views on states rights led him to become associated with the Democratic-Republican Party of Thomas Jefferson. He lost his bid for re-election to Congress but returned to state government, serving in the North Carolina Senate beginning in 1801.

===Slavery===

Spaight was part of the planter class and an extensive enslaver. According to census records, he enslaved 71 people in 1790 and 83 people in 1800. At the time of his death in 1802, he was enslaving 89 people. As a delegate to the Confederation Congress, Spaight led the successful effort to eliminate Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s proposed ban on slavery from the Northwest Ordinance of 1784.

===Death and legacy===
Spaight died on September 6, 1802, following injuries sustained in a duel with John Stanly, the Federalist congressman who had defeated him in the election of 1800 for the House of Representatives. Spaight is buried at &quot;Clermont,&quot; near New Bern, North Carolina. Spaight Street in Madison, Wisconsin, is named in his honor. Most of the main streets in downtown Madison are named after signers of the United States Constitution.

<doc id="502696" wikidata="Q316823" url="?curid=502696" title="Petre Roman">
<text>Petre Roman (born 22 July 1946) is a Romanian engineer and politician who was Prime Minister of Romania from 1989 to 1991, when his government was overthrown by the intervention of the miners led by Miron Cozma in the September 1991 Mineriad. Although regarded as the first Romanian prime minister since 1945 who was not a communist or communist sympathiser, he was a socialist. He later self-identified as a liberal. He was also the president of the Senate from 1996 to 1999 and Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1999 to 2000.

He was the leader of the Democratic Force (FD) party, which he founded after leaving the Democratic Party (PD) in 2003. He had previously served as an MP in the Lower Chamber, elected in 2012, elected as a member of the National Liberal Party. He had been removed from his seat in 2015 after being charged by the National Integrity Agency with incompatibility, but restored to office in 2016 after the Court of Appeals overturned the ruling. He is also a member of the Club of Madrid, a group of more than 80 democratic former statesmen, which works to strengthen democratic governance and leadership. In the early 2020 he joined Ilan Laufer&#x27;s Social Liberal Platform, but he left it shortly afterwards. He joined the Social Democratic Party and was elected in the General Council of Bucharest in 2020, but he resigned shortly afterwards.

In 2022, Petre Roman emigrated to Switzerland, in order to become the president of the Swiss UMEF (university of applied sciences institute).

==Background==
Petre Roman was born in Bucharest. His father, Valter Roman, born Ernst or Ernő Neuländer of Transylvanian Hungarian-Jewish descent, was a veteran of the Spanish Civil War, a Comintern activist, and a prominent member of the Romanian Communist Party (PCR). His mother Hortensia Vallejo was a Spaniard exiled who would become director of the Spanish section of Radio Romania International. The couple married in Moscow, and he has several siblings.

Roman attended the Petru Groza High School in his native city. He first rose to prominence during the Romanian Revolution of 1989, when he was among the crowd occupying the National Television building, and broadcasting messages expressing revolutionary triumph. He became provisional prime minister after the overthrow of the Communist regime, and was confirmed in office in June 1990, three months after the country&#x27;s first free election in 53 years.

In 1974 Roman married Mioara Georgescu, with whom he has a daughter, Oana. In February 2007, husband and wife confirmed that they were divorcing; the divorce was made final on Good Friday, 6 April 2007. In June 2009, he married a pregnant Silvia Chifiriuc (who is 26 years his junior) in a Romanian Orthodox wedding.

== During the Romanian Revolution ==
Petre Roman was heavily involved in the Romanian Revolution of December 1989 as a member of the National Salvation Front (FSN), both as a revolutionary and as a leading political figure. Given that the revolution was led by politicians united not by a cohesive ideology, but by resentment towards the Ceaușescu regime, in-fighting soon began, especially between its leaders, namely, centre-left liberal Dumitru Mazilu, who wished to instill capitalism, and neo-communist Ion Iliescu, who wanted to keep communism/hard line socialism, but remove Ceaușescu.

As a left-wing socialist, Petre Roman was largely the middle ground between the world-views of his colleagues, as he wanted to replace the Marxist view of socialism as a transitory stage with a more democratic understanding of socialism.

=== Revolutionary activity ===
Petre Roman participated directly in the Romanian Revolution, forming a barricade in the centre of Bucharest from the days of 21 and 22 December. On 22 December 1989, Petre Roman spoke from the balcony of the headquarters of the Central Committee against the Ceaușescu regime, the first public demonstration of its kind.

On 22 December, he became a member of the Provisional Council of the National Salvation Front (CPFSN) established for the coordination of the revolutionary process and the establishment of democracy once the revolution had concluded.

=== Prime minister ===

On 26 December 1989, Roman was appointed as the acting/ad interim Prime Minister of the provisional FSN government. At the 20 May 1990 elections–the first free elections held in the country in 53 years and colloquially known as the &quot;Blindman&#x27;s Sunday&quot; ()–he was elected as a deputy from Bucharest on the FSN list.

Shortly afterwards, then president Iliescu designated him once more as prime minister on 20 June 1990. He was formally confirmed in office by the newly elected legislature of the parliament on 28 June 1990 and his governing program was subsequently approved unanimously. He was the head of government of three cabinets between 1989 and 1991, as follows: Roman I cabinet, Roman II cabinet, and Roman III cabinet. He was succeeded by Theodor Stolojan in October 1991, after the September 1991 Mineriad.

<text>Alexander Martin (October 17, 1740November 2, 1807) was a Founding Father of the United States, framer of the U.S. Constitution, fourth and seventh Governor of North Carolina, and an infantry officer in the American Revolutionary War. In private life, Martin was a lawyer, merchant, planter, and slave owner.

== Early life and education ==
Born in Hunterdon County in the Province of New Jersey in 1740 to James Hugh Martin and Jane Hunter of Ireland, Governor Alexander Martin was a North Carolinian politician and delegate to the Federal Constitutional Convention. Aside from his role in the Constitutional Convention, Martin witnessed several significant chapters in colonial and early U.S. history, including the Regulator Rebellion, the Revolutionary War, and the North Carolina ratification debates.

Martin held bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees from the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), making him one of the most erudite delegates to the Constitutional Convention. After graduating from Princeton, Martin moved to Salisbury, North Carolina. There he worked first as a merchant and later as an attorney. As his legal career took shape, the Regulator Rebellion began. On September 24, 1770, angry Regulators took over the Hillsboro Court. When their demonstration spilled onto the streets of Hillsboro, several lawyers, including Martin, who likely was serving as a justice of the peace, were whipped and beaten.

== Revolutionary War ==
By 1774, Martin had become a judge of the Salisbury District. When the American Revolutionary War began, he was commissioned as a lieutenant colonel (September 1, 1775) under Colonel Robert Howe. He was promoted to colonel (April 10, 1776) over the 2nd North Carolina Regiment when Colonel Howe was promoted to Brigadier General. The regiment was initially part of the North Carolina State troops and joined George Washington&#x27;s Continental Army on November 28, 1775. In October 1777, at the Battle of Germantown, thick fog caused Martin and the soldiers under his command to mistake British troops for Continental soldiers. After this debacle, Martin faced a court-martial for cowardice. Though not convicted, Martin resigned from the army due to stress and poor health on November 22, 1777.

In 1778, Martin was elected to the North Carolina Senate while still recuperating from his military service. His tenure in the Senate was eventful: he served as president of the Senate&#x27;s Board of War and, in 1781, became acting governor of North Carolina when the sitting governor, Thomas Burke, was kidnapped by Tories. In 1782, the General Assembly elected Martin governor of North Carolina. While the cessation of hostilities had eliminated the gravest threat to North Carolina, the end of the Revolution posed many challenges, the most pressing of which was how to treat Tory and Loyalist property. Martin resisted popular pressure to confiscate and redistribute this property, instead advocating its return to all except for North Carolina&#x27;s more infamous Tories.

After Martin&#x27;s gubernatorial term ended, he returned to the General Assembly, where he once again became the speaker of the Senate. In 1787, the General Assembly elected him as a delegate to the Federal Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, where the difficulties of the U.S. government under the Articles of Confederation would be weighed. Martin arrived in Philadelphia before the start of the convention and stayed until late August, a few weeks before the convention&#x27;s close. He played little public role in the debates there and was not appointed to any of the convention&#x27;s committees. He seconded several minor motions, none of which profoundly affected the course of the convention. Because Martin left the Federal Convention early, he did not sign the Constitution.

In 1788, Martin sought election to the Hillsborough Constitutional Convention, where North Carolina would consider ratifying the Constitution. A proponent of the Federal Constitution, Martin was helpless in the face of a wave of Anti-Federalist sentiment in North Carolina. Delegates were selected county by county, and Martin, who lived in the predominantly Anti-Federalist Guilford County, ran at a disadvantage. His opponent in the election – the Anti-Federalist Presbyterian minister David Caldwell – won a seat, as did four of his congregation. Martin was the only delegate to the Federal Convention who sought election to a state convention and lost.

== Later life ==

At some point in the early 1780s, Martin began a life-long affair with Elizabeth (Lewis) Strong, the widow of Thomas Strong of Virginia. After her husband&#x27;s death, Elizabeth settled near her family in Guilford County. She became the mistress of Governor Martin sometime after. Their only known child, Alexander Strong Martin, was born July 1787, and by 1789 she and their natural son were residents in Martin&#x27;s Danbury estate in Rockingham County, based on census records. Governor Martin recognized Alexander Strong Martin as his son in his will, his only known child.

In 1797, Martin was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society.

Martin&#x27;s failure in Guilford County did not reflect any loss of popularity in the General Assembly. He was again elected governor in 1789 and held office until 1792, when he reached the term limit. During his second gubernatorial tenure, a permanent seat of the North Carolina government, named Raleigh, was founded in Wake County. Moreover, Martin established the University of North Carolina in 1789.

Immediately after Martin left the governor&#x27;s seat, he joined the U.S. Senate. His legislative record in the 1790s indicates that Martin&#x27;s political views were nuanced. Though he had supported the ratification of the Federal Constitution and had always run for election as a Federalist, he repeatedly voted against the Federalists in the 1790s. His convictions appear to have become more Federalist amid the XYZ Affair, and he voted for all of the Alien and Sedition Acts.

In 1799, Martin, having lost the support of North Carolina Federalists, was voted out of the Senate. He returned to the North Carolina General Assembly in 1804, and in 1805 again became Speaker of the North Carolina Senate. He died in 1807.

<text>The Cleveland metropolitan area, or Greater Cleveland as it is more commonly known, is the metropolitan area surrounding the city of Cleveland in Northeast Ohio, United States. According to the 2020 census results, the six-county Cleveland, OH Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) consists of Cuyahoga County, Ashtabula County, Geauga County, Lake County, Lorain County, and Medina County, and has a population of 2,185,825, making it the 33rd-most populous metropolitan area in the United States and the third largest metropolitan area in Ohio. The metro area is also part of the larger Cleveland–Akron–Canton Combined Statistical Area with a population of over 3.7 million people, the most populous statistical area in Ohio and the 17th most populous in the United States.

Northeast Ohio refers to a similar but substantially larger region that is home to over 4.5 million residents that also includes areas not part of Greater Cleveland. This article covers the area considered to be Greater Cleveland, but includes some information generally applicable to the larger region, which is itself part of what is known historically as the Connecticut Western Reserve.

==Northeast Ohio==

Northeast Ohio consists of 16 counties (Ashland, Ashtabula, Carroll, Columbiana, Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake, Lorain, Mahoning, Medina, Portage, Richland, Stark, Summit, Trumbull and Wayne counties) and includes the cities of Akron, Ashland, Ashtabula, Brunswick, Canton, Cleveland, Elyria, Lorain, Mansfield, Medina, Wadsworth, Wooster, Warren, and Youngstown. Northeast Ohio is home to approximately 4 million people, has a labor force of almost 2 million, and a gross regional product of nearly $170 billion. Other counties are sometimes considered to be in Northeast Ohio. These include Erie, Holmes, Huron and Tuscarawas counties, and their inclusion makes the total population of the entire northeastern section of Ohio well over 4.5 million people.

===Cities by population===
These, in decreasing order of population, are the twelve largest cities in Greater Cleveland of (2020):

==Demographics==

According to the 2020 United States Census, the population was 2.186 million in the five-county MSA of the Greater Cleveland Area, making it the second largest metropolitan-statistical area entirely within the state of Ohio. Approximately 48.1% of the population was male and 51.9% were female. In 2010 the racial makeup of the five-county Area was 71.7% (1,490,074) Non-Hispanic Whites, 19.7% (409,582) Blacks or African Americans, 0.2% (4,056) American Indians and Alaskan Natives, 2.0% (40,522) Asian (0.7% Asian Indian 0.5% Chinese 0.2% Filipino, 0.1% Korean, 0.1% Vietnamese, 0.1% Japanese, 0.0% (398) Pacific Islander, 1.7% (35,224) from other races, and 2.0% (42,130) from two or more races. 4.7% (98,133) of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race (2.8% Puerto Rican, 1.0% Mexican, 0.1% Dominican, and 0.1% Cuban).
The median income for a household in Greater Cleveland was $46,231 and the median income for a family, $59,611. The per capita income was $25,668. Persons living below the poverty line was 15.1%. According to a study by Capgemini and the World Wealth Report by Merrill Lynch, the Cleveland area has nearly 54,000 millionaire households, and is expected to continue to grow at 17% over the next five years.

The Greater Cleveland area is the most diverse region in the state of Ohio and is becoming increasingly more diverse with new waves of immigration. As of 2010, both the Hispanic and Asian population in the Cleveland-Akron-Ashtabula area grew by almost 40%, Hispanics now number at 112,307 (up from 80,738 in 2000). The Asian population alone accounts for 55,087 (up from 39,586 in 2000) but people who cite Asian and other ethnicities enumerate 67,231. The Chinese Americans are the oldest Asian group residing in Northeast Ohio, most visible in Cleveland&#x27;s Asiatown. Nevertheless, the area is also home to hundreds of Indians, Thais, Taiwanese, Pakistanis, Laotians, Cambodians, and Burmese peoples as well.

The Cleveland area has a substantial African American population with origins in the First and Second Great Migrations. It also boasts some of the nation&#x27;s largest Irish, Italian (numbering over 205,000), Slavic, and Hungarian populations. At one time, the Hungarian population of Cleveland proper was so great that the city boasted of having the highest concentration of Hungarians in the world outside of Budapest. Today, the Greater Cleveland area is home to the largest Slovak, Slovene, and Hungarian communities in the world, outside of Slovakia, Slovenia, and Hungary respectively. The Slavic population of the Cleveland-Akron area comprises 17.2%, far higher than the nation&#x27;s rate of 6%. There are 171,000 Poles, 38,000 Slovaks, 66,000 Slovenes, 38,000 Czechs, 31,000 Russians, and 23,000 Ukrainians in Greater Cleveland. Slavic Village and Tremont historically had some of the largest concentrations of Eastern Europeans within Cleveland proper. Today, both neighborhoods continue to be home to many Slavic Ohioans. In addition, Slovenia maintains a Consulate-General in Downtown Cleveland. The city of Cleveland has also received visits from the Presidents of Hungary and Poland.

Greater Cleveland is home to a sizable Jewish community. According to the North American Jewish Data Bank, the community comprises an estimated 100,000 people or 4.6% as of 2023, above the nation&#x27;s 1.7%, and up from 81,500 in 1996. The highest proportion is in Cuyahoga County at 5.5% (of the county&#x27;s total population). Today, 23% of Greater Cleveland&#x27;s Jewish population is under the age of 17, and 27% reside in the Heights area (Cleveland Heights, Shaker Heights, and University Heights). In 2010 nearly 2,600 people spoke Hebrew and 1,100 Yiddish.

==Area codes==
In the 1950s, AT&amp;T assigned Greater Cleveland Area code 216, which included all of Northeast Ohio. In 1996, Area code 216 was reduced in size to cover the northern half of its prior area, centering on Cleveland and its lake shore suburbs. Area code 330 was introduced for the southern half of Greater Cleveland, including Medina County. The western half of the region, including Ashland and Richland counties, and parts of Huron, Wayne, and Erie counties, are assigned area codes 419 and 567.

In 1997, area code 216 was further split as the need for additional phone numbers grew. Area code 216 was reduced in geographical area to cover the city of Cleveland and its inner ring suburbs. Area code 440 was introduced to cover the remainder of was what previously area code 216, including all of Lorain, Geauga, and Lake counties, and parts of Cuyahoga County. Some communities, such as Parma, and Parma Heights were divided between the 216 and 440 area codes. In 1999, Congressman Dennis Kucinich introduced federal legislation to protect small and medium-sized cities from being split into two or more area codes.

In 2000, it was anticipated that the available phone numbers in area code 330 would be exhausted, and an overlay area code was introduced. Area code 234 was assigned to overlap existing area code 330. With the creation of area code 234, any new phone number in the geographical area formerly covered by area code 330 could be assigned a phone number in either the 234 or 330 area codes, with no change in local or long-distance toll status. This made necessary the use of ten-digit dialing within the 330/234 area code region. After the introduction of area code 234, assignments of new telephone numbers in the area did not continue at an accelerated pace, and new phone numbers for area code 234 were not assigned until 2003.

<text>Colonel Gary Eugene Payton, USAF, (born June 20, 1948) is an American astronaut and USAF Manned Spaceflight Engineer. Payton flew on the STS-51-C mission aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; in January 1985. He later served as Deputy Undersecretary of the Air Force under the Bush and Obama Administrations.

==Education==
Payton graduated from high school in Rock Island, Illinois, in 1966. He went on to attend Bradley University, in Peoria, Illinois. After one year at Bradley, he entered the United States Air Force Academy, in Colorado Springs, Colorado, graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in astronautical engineering in 1971. He continued with his graduate education at Purdue University School of Aeronautics and Astronautics, in West Lafayette, Indiana, earning a Master of Science degree in astronautical and aeronautical engineering in 1972. He graduated from pilot training at Craig AFB, in Alabama in 1973.

==Career==
From 1972 to 1976, Payton served as a U.S. Air Force pilot and instructor pilot, Craig AFB, Alabama. He has accumulated at least 1,080 hours in T-37, T-38, and T-39 aircraft.

Payton served as a spacecraft test controller from 1976 to 1980, at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, in Florida. He was selected for the USAF Manned Spaceflight Engineer Program in February 1980.

Payton flew on the STS-51-C mission aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; in January 1985 which launched and returned to land at the Kennedy Space Center, in Florida. STS-51C was the first dedicated Space Shuttle Department of Defense mission. The mission carried an Inertial Upper Stage and deployed a DoD satellite. This was the first shuttle mission that most on-orbit details were classified and not publicized. Payton traveled over 1.2 million miles in 48 Earth orbits, and logged more than 73 hours in space.

From 1997 to 2000, Payton also served as NASA&#x27;s Deputy Associate Administrator for Space Transportation Technology where he initiated, planned and led the Reusable Launch Vehicle technology demonstration program, which included the X-33, X-34, X-37 and DC-XA flight test projects. Prior to this, he was the Director of NASA&#x27;s Space Transportation Division from 1995 to 1997.

After leaving NASA, Payton joined the ORBIMAGE as its Vice President for Engineering and Operations.

Payton was Deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force for Space Programs from 2005 to 2010. Prior to this, he served as Deputy for Advanced Systems, Missile Defense Agency from 2002 to 2005.

He is currently distinguished visiting professor in the Schriever Chair in Astronautics at the United States Air Force Academy, teaching astronautical engineering.

==Personal life==
Gary Payton is married to Sue Payton and they have a daughter.

<text>The Gare du Nord (; ), officially Paris Nord, is one of the seven large mainline railway station termini in Paris, France. The station is served by trains that run between the capital and northern France via the Paris–Lille railway, as well as to international destinations in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Located in the northern part of Paris near the Gare de l&#x27;Est in the 10th arrondissement, the Gare du Nord offers connections with several urban transport lines, including Paris Métro, RER and buses. It is the busiest railway station in Europe by total passenger numbers, and the busiest outside Japan. In 2015, the Gare du Nord saw more than 700,000 passengers per day.

The current Gare du Nord was designed by French architect Jacques Ignace Hittorff, while the original complex was constructed between 1861 and 1864 on behalf of the Chemin de Fer du Nord company. The station replaced an earlier and much smaller terminal sharing the same name, which was operational between 1846 and 1860. A substantial refurbishment programme during the late 2010s and early 2020s will greatly redesign the station. The plans for this include a significant expansion of the station&#x27;s footprint and ability to handle passengers, expanding onsite amenities and establishing a new departure terminal in preparation for the 2024 Summer Olympics. As a consequence of this redevelopment, the Gare du Nord will become the largest railway station in Europe.

==Early history==
===Predecessor===
The first Gare du Nord was constructed on behalf of the Chemins de fer du Nord company, which was managed by Léonce Reynaud, professor of architecture at the École Polytechnique. During 1843, the engineer Onfroy de Bréville, having been placed in charge of the first section of the company&#x27;s proposed line between Paris and Amiens, produced a report that considered two different options for the terminal station. Management opted to construct the less spacious of the two options, despite the occurrence of stations serving capital city becoming overwhelmed already being a known phenomenon in both London and Brussels. For his part, de Bréville promoted the smaller option as being more than adequate to meet demand and reducing its impact on the existing neighbourhood of Clos Saint-Lazare; it was also considerably cheaper than the larger alternative option.

The engineer and architect Francois-Leonce Reynaud was appointed to design the station itself. In terms of its basic configuration, the station accommodated a total of six tracks and two large platforms underneath a single shed. This shed, which was divided into two naves, was supported by a series of cast iron columns and wooden trusses; the structure featured a relatively distinctive drainage system that used the hollow columns as drain pipes directly into the city&#x27;s sewers. Road traffic was directed to a large courtyard set to the side of the station.

On 14 June 1846, the first Gare du Nord station was inaugurated; that same year, the Paris–Lille railway was also declared to be operational. During the following decade, not only was there a major boom in railway traffic as the French network rapidly expanded, Napoleon III himself heavily advocated for grand investments in infrastructure to be made, with the railways being a prime recipient of the French state&#x27;s attention. During the late 1850s, it had become clear that the original Gare du Nord would be far too small to accommodate the demands of a major terminal station, thus it was decided to replace it entirely. The decision to redevelop the station was considerably eased by the expense of doing so being shared between the company and the city. Accordingly, the station building was partially demolished in 1860 to provide space for the current station; the original station&#x27;s façade was removed and transferred to Lille station (now Lille-Flandres).

===Current station===


The chairman of the Chemin de Fer du Nord railway company, James Mayer de Rothschild, chose the French architect Jacques Ignace Hittorff to design the current station. Construction of the new complex was carried out between May 1861 to December 1865; the new station actually opened for service while still under construction during 1864. The façade was designed around a triumphal arch and used many slabs of stone. The building has the usual U-shape of a terminus station. The main support beam is made out of cast iron. The support pillars inside the station were made at Alston &amp; Gourley&#x27;s ironworks in Glasgow in the United Kingdom, the only country with a foundry large enough for the task.

The sculptural display represents the principal cities served by the company. Eight of the nine most majestic statues, crowning the building along the cornice line, illustrate destinations outside France, with the ninth figure of Paris in the centre. Fourteen more modest statues representing northern European cities are lower on the façade. The sculptors represented are:

*London and Vienna by Jean-Louis Jaley
*Brussels and Warsaw by François Jouffroy
*Amsterdam by Charles Gumery
*Frankfurt by Gabriel Thomas
*Berlin by Jean-Joseph Perraud
*Cologne by Mathurin Moreau
*Paris, Boulogne and Compiegne by Pierre-Jules Cavelier
*Arras and Laon by Théodore-Charles Gruyère
*Lille and Beauvais by Charles-François Lebœuf
*Valenciennes and Calais by Philippe Joseph Henri Lemaire
*Rouen and Amiens by Eugène-Louis Lequesne
*Douai and Dunkirk by Gustave Crauck
*Cambrai and Saint-Quentin by Auguste Ottin

It was originally planned that a monumental avenue would be constructed leading up to the station&#x27;s façade, cutting through the old street layout. Between 1838 and 1859, around a dozen separate proposals to redevelop the streets around Gare du Nord were tabled. However, no such redevelopment ever happened despite the extensive rebuilding of Paris headed by the Baron Georges-Eugène Haussmann; the Gare du Nord&#x27;s absence from Haussmann&#x27;s work has been referred to as &quot;exhibiting arbitrariness and inconsistency&quot;. According to the railway historian Micheline Nilsen, the decision not to proceed with the redevelopment has been typically attributed to Haussmann and his personal displeasure that the city would have to bear such great expense on behalf of the Gare du Nord, and that Haussmann&#x27;s overall attitude led to a pronounced understatement of the railways. Whatever the reason, the station has persistently suffered problems with a lack of space and poor access.

==Services ==
Like other Parisian railway stations, the Gare du Nord rapidly proved to be too small to handle persistent increases in railway traffic. Accordingly, the station has been periodically reconfigured. During 1884, engineers were able to install five supplementary tracks. During 1889, the station&#x27;s interior was completely rebuilt, while an extension was constructed along its eastern side to serve the suburban rail lines. Further rounds of expansion work were carried out between the 1930s and the 1960s.

Beginning in 1906 and 1908, the station was served by the Metro Line 4 (which crosses Paris from north to south) and the terminus of Metro Line 5 (which ran to Étoile through Place d&#x27;Italie. In 1942, Line 5 was extended towards the northern suburbs of Pantin and Bobigny, while its south terminus was set to Place d&#x27;Italie. Metro Line 2 (station La Chapelle) is linked to the Gare du Nord by a long, arched circular underground passageway.

During 1994, the arrival of high speed Eurostar international services required another reorganisation of the rail tracks:
*Tracks 1 and 2: Service platforms, not open to the public.
*Tracks 3 to 6: Eurostar trains to/from London. Access to these trains is from the upper level after border controls.
*Tracks 7 and 8: Eurostar trains to/from Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands.
*Tracks 9 to 21: TGV and TER Hauts-de-France
*Tracks 30 to 36 (Suburban station extension): Transilien Lines H and K
*Tracks 41 and 44 (underground, level -3): RER D
*Tracks 42 and 43 (underground, level -3): RER B

It is also connected to the Gare du Nord Métro station (Line 4 and Line 5, 2 platforms), La Chapelle Métro station (Line 2, 2 platforms) and Magenta station (RER E, 4 platforms).

After the &#x27;Additional Protocol to the Sangatte Protocol&#x27; was signed by France and the United Kingdom on 29 May 2000, juxtaposed controls were set up in the station. Eurostar passengers travelling to the UK clear exit checks from the Schengen Area (carried out by the French Border Police) as well as UK entry checks (conducted by the UK Border Force) in the station before boarding their train. PARAFE self-service gates are available in the station which eligible passengers (EU, EEA and Swiss citizens aged 12 or above holding biometric passports) can use to clear French exit immigration checks (instead of a staffed counter). ePassport gates have also been installed in the station, which eligible passengers (UK, EU, EEA, Swiss, Australian, Canadian, Japanese, New Zealand, Singaporean, South Korean and United States citizens as well as other foreign nationals who have applied for the Registered Traveller scheme aged 12 or over holding biometric passports) can use to clear UK entry immigration instead of a staffed counter.

By 2015, the Gare du Nord was reportedly the busiest railway station in Europe, handling in excess of 700,000 passengers during a typical day. Most of these passengers are commuters travelling in from the northern suburbs of Paris and outlying towns; only 3 per cent of the traffic has been attributed to Eurostar&#x27;s international services.

There is a further construction project to build a connecting underground passageway between Gare du Nord and Gare de l&#x27;Est, which is projected to open in 2025. When open the Gare du Nord-Gare de l&#x27;Est complex (including Magenta &amp; La Chapelle) will have 77 platforms.

Security for the station is provided by the French police, the railways police and private security companies. Due to the position of the station as a gateway to the northern suburbs of Paris, there are some parts of the station where security incidents occur from time to time.

==Refurbishment==
The SNCF has long sought to improve the station to better handle traffic, particularly following the expansion of high speed rail services during the 1990s and 2000s accompanied by rising passenger numbers. By 2015, 700,000 passengers were using the Gare du Nord each day; projections produced in 2018 predicted these numbers to rise to 800,000 by 2024 and 900,000 by 2030. During 2015, the architect Jean-Michel Wilmotte was engaged by SNCF with the directive to &quot;open the station towards the city&quot;. According to SNCF Project Director Stéphane Cougnon, the programme has a budget in excess of 600 million euros (£526m). The endeavour has the public backing of Paris&#x27;s mayor, Anne Hidalgo, who has also pledged to address the frequent traffic problems in front of the station by reconfiguring its approaches. Critics of the redevelopment have included several architects and urban planners, who have typically objected to the high level of commercialisation involved.

The changes to the Gare du Nord shall be substantial, expanding its footprint to roughly two and a half times its pre-refurbishment footprint, turning it into the largest railway station in Europe. The expansion shall be facilitated largely by increasing the building&#x27;s height, as well as by pulling back the outer walls in several places. The work shall build upon the existing philosophy of keeping arriving and departing passengers separated; all mainline departures are to be centralised within a new building alongside the eastern façade. To improve the station&#x27;s interconnectivity with the rest of the city, the SNCF has reportedly considered the construction of a new eastern façade along the rue du Faubourg Saint-Denis to give direct access to the new departures terminal, as well as a new bus terminal.

Various new onsite amenities shall be provisioned across of floorspace, representing a five-fold increase. Amongst the various retailers and commercial operations planned are two restaurants that are to operate on the station&#x27;s roof, along with a gym, tennis court, putting range, fitness trail along the façade, and in excess of of green space. To improve accessibility throughout, a total of 55 lifts and 105 escalators shall be installed, more than doubling the pre-redevelopment number. Eco-friendly considerations have also been made, conforming with the demanding BREEAM standards and incorporating features such as of solar panels. Despite the ambitious scope, great care shall be taken to preserving its historic architecture and appearance, the station having been regarded as a national heritage site in its own right. The project has reportedly been modelled using several other major stations, including London St Pancras and New York&#x27;s Grand Central Terminal.

During June 2019, a city commission opted to initially deny a construction permit associated with the project. Nonetheless, work commenced on the refurbishment during late 2019, and is scheduled to be completed during late 2023. The station will remain open during the renovations despite the increased technical challenge posed by doing so, the cost of closure being judged to be too great. Substantial planning has gone into minimising disruption and maximising passenger comfort throughout the programme. Some portions of the station, such as the relatively recent facilities for Eurostar services, shall remain relatively untouched. In addition to work on the station site itself, SNCF shall be making alterations along the entire northern corridor within this period in association with the redevelopment work. It is reportedly intended for the station&#x27;s refurbishment to be completed by 2024, the year in which Paris is to host the Olympic Games.

==In popular culture==
The Gare du Nord has served as a backdrop in numerous French films, such as &quot;Les Poupées Russes&quot;.

In Nancy Mitford&#x27;s &quot;The Pursuit of Love&quot;, Linda first meets Fabrice in the Gare du Nord when she runs out of resources and is sitting weeping on her suitcase.

In US movies, both the exterior and the interior of the Gare du Nord are seen in the 2002 film &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; with Matt Damon and again in the trilogy&#x27;s finale, &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot;, released in August 2007. It was also seen in &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Twelve&quot; in 2004, and &quot;Mr Bean&#x27;s Holiday&quot; in 2007. The ending of the 2012 movie &quot;The Raven&quot; by James McTeigue takes place at the station.

Scenes of &quot;Gossip Girl&quot; episode &quot;Double Identity&quot; were shot inside the Gare du Nord.

<text>Fama Fraternitatis Rosae Crucis (&quot;Report of the Fraternity of the Rose Cross&quot;) is an anonymous Rosicrucian manifesto published circa 1610 in Kassel, Hesse-Kassel (in present-day Germany). In 1652, Thomas Vaughan translated the work into English. An Italian edition was published as an appendix of the 77th &quot;Advertisement&quot; (part), under the title &quot;Generale Riforma dell&#x27; Universo&quot; (&quot;Universal Reformation of Mankind&quot;), from a German translation of Bocallini&#x27;s &quot;Ragguagli di Parnasso&quot; (&quot;Advertisements from Parnassus&quot;). The &quot;Fama&quot; was soon published in a separate form.

The book is considered to be one of the three foundational manifestos of Rosicrucianism, and inspired Rosicrucian organizations such as Order of the Golden and Rosy Cross (1750s–1790s) and Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia (1865–present).

==The Legend==
The &quot;Fama&quot; tells the story of the &quot;Father C.R.&quot; (later referred to in the text as &quot;C.R.C.&quot;) and his ill-fated pilgrimage to Jerusalem; his subsequent tutelage by the secret sages of the East, the wise men of &quot;Damcar&quot; in Arabia, from whom he learned the ancient esoteric knowledge which included the study of physics, mathematics, magic and kabbalah; his return through Egypt and Fes, and his presence among the &quot;alumbrados&quot; in Spain. It is thought in occultism that Rosenkreuz&#x27;s pilgrimage seems to refer to transmutation steps of the Great Work.

After his arrival to Germany, Father C.R. and other Brothers established an esoteric Christian Fraternity: &quot;The Fraternity of the Rose Cross&quot;. The Brothers of the Fraternity were sent on mission throughout the world, having as their first priority to use their esoteric knowledge to cure the sick free of charge (&quot;&quot;), not wearing any special clothing, and met once each year in the mysterious &quot;House of the Holy Spirit&quot;.

The Legend shows an agreement with six articles that they drew up prior to their separation, bounding themselves one to another to keep:

# That none of them should profess any other thing than to cure the sick, and that gratis. 
# None of the posterity should be constrained to wear one kind of habit, but to follow the custom of the country.
# Every year, upon the day C., they would meet together at the house Santi Spiritus, or write the cause of their absence.
# Every Brother should seek a worthy person to succeed him after his death.
# The word CR should be their seal, mark, and character.
# The Fraternity should remain secret one hundred years.

Although Father C.R.C. is often identified as the allegorical character of Christian Rosenkreuz from the &quot;Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz&quot;, the &quot;Fama Fraternitatis&quot; does not identify him as such in the text.

==List of names in the Legend==
The Legend presented in the Manifestos has been interpreted through centuries as texts full of symbolism. Rosicrucians clearly adopted through the Manifestos the Pythagorean tradition of envisioning objects and ideas in terms of their numeric aspects, and, on the other hand, they directly state in the &quot;Confessio Fraternitatis&quot;: &quot;We speak unto you by parables, but would willingly bring you to the right, simple, easy and ingenuous exposition, understanding, declaration, and knowledge of all secrets.&quot;

===In the narrative===
*C.R. 
# I. A.
# G.V.
# R.C. (C.R.C.&#x27;s deceased father&#x27;s brother&#x27;s son): (see also description in the vault below).&quot;
# B. (a skillful painter)
# I.O. (P.A. was his successor)
# P.D. (A. was his successor, and N.N. was in turn A&#x27;s successor)
# R. (successor to C.R.C.)
# G.G.

The sentence &quot;C.R.C.&#x27;s deceased father&#x27;s brother&#x27;s son&quot; has always been a deeply enigmatic one. There is the possibility that it may refer to the rebirth process, a central tenet teaching of groups having, or claiming to have, a Rosicrucian philosophy. This would imply that &quot;Father C.R.&quot;, possibly of the 13th and 14th centuries, would have been reborn to &quot;R.C.&quot;, becoming the 14th and 15th century C.R.C. in the Manifestos. This appears to confirm what several later sources wrote about the Rosicrucian movement:
*According to the founder of Anthroposophy, Rudolf Steiner, the Mystery of the foundation of the Rosicrucian Order in the early 14th century relates to the birth of Christian Rosenkreuz in the 13th century, and his later rebirth in the 14th century.
*According to Maurice Magre, in &quot;Magicians, Seers, and Mystics&quot;, derived from local oral tradition, Christian Rosenkreuz was the last descendant of the Germelschausen, a German family that flourished in the 13th century. Their Castle stood in the Thuringian Forest on the Border of Hesse and they had embraced Albigense&#x27;s doctrines, combining pagan superstitions and Christian beliefs. 
*According to the Rosicrucian Initiate Max Heindel, the foundation of the Order of the Rose Cross occurred in 1313, early 14th century.
*According to Mason Albert Pike, and later metaphysician René Guénon and the scholar Manly Palmer Hall, the &quot;Adepts of the Rose-Croix&quot; are for the first time expounded in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; (1308–1321).

===In C.R.C.&#x27;s vault===
# Fra. I.A. Fra. Ch. electione Fraternitatis caput. [elected head of Fraternity]: possibly &quot;Iohann Andreae (1586–1654)?&quot;
# Fra. G.V. M.P.G.
# Fra. F.R.C. Junior haeres S. Spiritus [younger heir of the house of the holy spirit]: 
# Fra. F.B. M.P.A. Pictor et Architectus [painter and architect]: possibly &quot;Francis Bacon (1561–1626)?&quot;

&quot;Secundi Circuli&quot;
# Fra. P.A. Successor to Fra. I.O., Mathematicus
# Fra. A. Successor to Fra. P.D.
# Fra. R. Successor to Patris C.R.C., cum Christo Triumphantis [with Christ Triumphant]

The enigmatic &quot;Fra. F.R.C.&quot; in the vault (the &quot;R.C.&quot; in the narrative, &quot;see above&quot;) is mentioned as &quot;heir&quot;; this statement &quot;younger heir of the house of the holy spirit&quot; seems to provide evidence of the intimate relation to &quot;Father C.R.&quot;, possibly meaning &quot;Father R.C.&quot; [forming the C.R.C. initials]:
*The poet Fernando Pessoa — known defender of Masonic and Rosicrucian ideals and possible Rosicrucian Initiate, as he states &quot;Initiated from Master to Disciple in the three minor degrees of the (apparently extinct) Portuguese Templar Order&quot; (Rosicrucians seem to have had a deep presence in Portugal, intermixed with Templar tradition, and with evidence in monuments and literature, from medieval times into the 20th century) — wrote an hermetic poem titled &quot;&quot; [In the Tomb of C.R.C], which states in the final line/verse: &quot;Our Father Rose-n-c[k]reuz [Rosaecruz] knows and keeps silent&quot;, which may attribute the whole key to the understanding of the &quot;Fama&quot; to the enigmatic character described as &quot;R.C.&quot; or &quot;F.R.C&quot;.
*The sentence &quot;cum Christo Triumphantis&quot; [with Christ Triumphant] may imply that the central meaning of the &quot;Fama&quot; is to give an account of the final achievement into the &quot;Great Work&quot; (the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone of the alchemists, or the Holy Grail of the Templars) by C.R.C., Christian Rosenkreuz. This seems to describe that the symbolism of the unification of the &quot;Rose&quot; and the &quot;Cross&quot; (Christian Rose Cross), in the Legend, implies the existence of a Christic state (Christ, &quot;the Light of the World&quot;), which includes liberation from the cycle of births and deaths, comparable and higher than the Buddhic state (Buddha, &quot;the Light of Asia&quot;) described in the eastern sacred literature. This &quot;Christic&quot; process and state is pointed by major occultists as being described in some major Western literary works as the 14th-century &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; or the 16th-century &quot;The Lusiads&quot;, and, it is also, to some extent, explained in the Rosicrucian literature known as &quot;Western Wisdom Teachings&quot;.

==Origin==
In his book &quot;The True Story of the Rosicrucians&quot; historian Tobias Churton brought to light new documents that prove the Fama was written by a group of Lutheran scholars at Tübingen in which Andreae took an active part. After one manuscript written in 1612, which was intended to be circulated privately escaped their control, the movement took on a life of its own, prompting new theories and pure speculations such as those brought forward by Émile Dantinne (1884–1969) who theorised that the origins of the Rosicrucians might have had an Islamic connection. Rosenkreuz started his pilgrimage at the age of sixteen. This led him to Arabia, Egypt and Morocco, where he came into contact with sages of the East who revealed to him the &quot;universal harmonic science&quot;. After learning Arabic philosophy in Jerusalem, he was led to Damcar. This place remains a mystery — it did not become Damascus, but is somewhere not too far from Jerusalem. Then he stopped briefly in Egypt. Soon afterwards, he embarked to Fes, a center of philosophical and occult studies, such as the alchemy of Abu-Abdallah, Gabir ben Hayan and Imam Jafar al Sadiq, the astrology and magic of Ali-ash-Shabramallishi, and the esoteric science of Abdarrahman ben Abdallah al Iskari. However, Dantinne states that Rosenkreuz may have found his secrets amongst the Brethren of Purity, a society of philosophers that had formed in Basra (Iraq) in the 10th century. Their doctrine had its source in the study of the ancient Greek philosophers, but it became more neo-Pythagorean. They adopted the Pythagorean tradition of envisioning objects and ideas in terms of their numeric aspects. Their theurgy and esoteric knowledge is expounded in an epistolary style in the &quot;Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity&quot;.

The Brethren of Purity and the Sufis were united in many points of doctrine. They both were mystical orders deriving from Quranic theology but supplanting dogma with a faith in the Divine Reality. There were many similarities between the Rosicrucian way as expressed in the manifestos and the way of life of the Brethren of Purity. Neither group wore special clothing, both practiced abstinence, they healed the sick, and they offered their teachings free of charge. Similarities also were evident in the doctrinal elements of their theurgy and the story of creation in terms of emanationism. However, if one studies the Fama which was written by Lutherans, the main idea of Islamic connection is easily disproved. What was intended with the Fama was a novel in which the idea of reformation of Sciences and Arts in which a Hermetic tradition of European origin is well established.

<text>Karol Joseph &quot;Bo&quot; Bobko (December 23, 1937 – August 17, 2023) was an American aerospace engineer, U.S. Air Force officer, test pilot, and a USAF and NASA astronaut. Bobko was the first graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy to travel in space and the first person to fly on three different space shuttles across three different missions: STS-6, STS-51-D, STS-51-J.

== Early life and education ==
Colonel Bobko was born on December 23, 1937, in Queens, New York, to a family with Polish and Lithuanian roots. He graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School in 1955 before receiving a Bachelor of Science degree from the United States Air Force Academy in 1959. In 1970, he earned a Master of Science degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Southern California.

== Military service ==
Bobko was a member of the first graduating class of the U.S. Air Force Academy. Subsequent to receiving his commission and navigator rating, he attended pilot training at Bartow Air Base, Florida, and Vance Air Force Base, Oklahoma. He completed his flight training and received his pilot wings in 1960.

From 1961 to 1965, he flew F-100 and F-105 aircraft while assigned as a pilot with the 523d Tactical Fighter Squadron at Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico, and the 336th Tactical Fighter Squadron at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina. He attended the Aerospace Research Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California, and was assigned as an astronaut to the USAF Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) program in 1966.

Bobko logged over 6,600 hours flight time in the F-100, F-104, F-105, T-33, T-38, and other aircraft.

== NASA career ==
Bobko became part of NASA Astronaut Group 7 in September 1969 after the cancellation of the Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL) program. He was a crewmember on the highly successful Skylab Medical Experiment Altitude Test (SMEAT) – a 56-day ground simulation of the Skylab mission, enabling crewmen to collect medical experiments baseline data and evaluate equipment, operations and procedures.

Bobko was a member of the astronaut support crew for the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project (ASTP). This historic first international manned space flight was completed in July 1975. Subsequently, he was a member of the support crew for the Space Shuttle Approach and Landing Tests conducted at Edwards Air Force Base. He served alternately as CAPCOM and prime chase pilot during these Approach and Landing Test (ALT) flights.

In preparation for the first flight of &quot;Columbia&quot; (STS-1) Bobko served as the lead astronaut in the test and checkout group at Kennedy Space Center.

A veteran of three space flights, Bobko logged a total of 386 hours in space. He was the first graduate of the US Air Force Academy to travel in space and the first astronaut to fly on three different shuttle missions. He was the pilot on STS-6 (April 4–9, 1983); and was the mission commander on STS-51-D (April 12–19, 1985) and STS-51-J (October 3–7, 1985).

=== Spaceflight experience ===
Bobko was pilot for STS-6, which launched from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, on April 4, 1983. During the maiden voyage of &quot;Challenger&quot;, the crew deployed a large communications satellite (TDRS-1) and the rocket stage (Inertial Upper Stage) required to boost it to geosynchronous orbit. The STS-6 crew also conducted the first Shuttle spacewalk (EVA) and additionally conducted numerous other experiments in materials processing and the recording of lightning activities from space. There were also three Getaway Specials activated on the flight. After 120 hours of orbital operations, &quot;Challenger&quot; landed on the concrete runway at Edwards Air Force Base in California, on April 9, 1983.

On his second mission, Bobko was the commander of STS-51-D which launched from Kennedy Space Center on April 12, 1985. The mission was to deploy two communications satellites, perform electrophoresis and echocardiograph operations in space, in addition to accomplishing other experiments. When one of the communications satellites malfunctioned, the first unscheduled spacewalk was made to activate the satellite which required rendezvous and operations with the remote manipulator arm. After 168 hours of orbital operations, &quot;Discovery&quot; landed on Runway 33 at Kennedy Space Center on April 19, 1985.
Bobko&#x27;s final flight was as commander of STS-51-J, the second Space Shuttle Department of Defense mission, which launched from Kennedy Space Center on October 3, 1985. This mission carried classified payloads for the Department of Defense and was the second time that a Shuttle mission was used solely for Department of Defense activities. This was the maiden voyage of &quot;Atlantis&quot;. After 98 hours of orbital operations, &quot;Atlantis&quot; landed on Edwards Air Force Base Lakebed Runway 23 on October 7, 1985. Bobko became the first person to fly on three different Space Shuttles. He was the only astronaut to have flown on the maiden flights of two Space Shuttles.

== Post-NASA career ==
In 1988, Bobko retired from NASA and the Air Force to join the firm of Booz Allen Hamilton, in Houston, Texas. At Booz Allen he was a principal and managed efforts dealing with human space flight. His areas of emphasis were: high performance training simulation, hardware and software systems engineering, spacecraft checkout and testing, space station development and program integration.

In 2000, Bobko joined SPACEHAB, Inc. in Houston, Texas, where he was Vice President for Strategic Programs. He led an organization that develops concepts, processes and hardware for future spaceflight applications. In 2005, Bobko joined Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) as Program Manager for the NASA Ames Research Center Simulation Laboratories (SimLabs) contract.

== Personal life and death ==
Bobko was married to F. Dianne Welsh and had a daughter and a son. He resided with his wife in Half Moon Bay, California.

Bobko died of complications of an unspecified degenerative disease of the nervous system in Half Moon Bay on August 17, 2023, at age 85.

<text>Ice Station Zebra is a 1963 thriller novel written by Scottish author Alistair MacLean. It marked a return to MacLean&#x27;s classic Arctic setting. After completing this novel, whose plot line parallels real-life events during the Cold War, MacLean retired from writing for three years. In 1968 it was loosely adapted into a film of the same name.

==Plot==
Drift ice Station Zebra, a British meteorological station built on an ice floe in the Arctic Sea, suffers a catastrophic oil fire; several of its men die, and their shelter and supplies are destroyed. The survivors take refuge in one hut with little food and heat.

The (fictional) American nuclear-powered submarine USS &quot;Dolphin&quot; is dispatched on a rescue mission. Just before she departs, Dr. Carpenter, the narrator, is sent to accompany her. Carpenter&#x27;s background is unknown, but he claims that he is an expert in dealing with frostbite and other deep-cold medical conditions, and he carries orders from the Chief of Naval Operations of the United States Navy. Commander Swanson, the &quot;Dolphin&quot; submarine captain, is suspicious of Carpenter, and calls in his superior Admiral Garvie. Garvie refuses to allow Carpenter on board without knowing his mission. Under duress, Carpenter finally reveals that the ice station is actually a highly equipped listening post, keeping watch for nuclear missile launches from the Soviet Union, a statement which convinces the commander and the admiral.

&quot;Dolphin&quot; reaches the Arctic ice-pack, and dives under it. She surfaces in a break in the ice and succeeds in making tenuous radio contact with Ice Station Zebra. Carpenter confides to the Captain that the commander of the station is his brother. Having obtained a bearing on the station, &quot;Dolphin&quot; dives again, and succeeds in finding a lead from the station and breaks through a crack in the ice above. Carpenter, Executive Officer Hansen, and two crewmen are put above on the icepack and make the journey to the station through an Arctic storm on foot, taking with them as many supplies as they can. They reach Zebra after a near-impossible trek, and find that eight of the men on the station are dead, while the 11 others are barely alive. Investigating the corpses, Carpenter finds that one of them has been shot. They find that their radio has been damaged, and so Carpenter and Hansen return to &quot;Dolphin&quot;. The US submarine moves close to the station, and finding no open water, blows a hole in the ice using a torpedo.

The sick men are cared for by &quot;Dolphin&quot;. Carpenter does some more investigating, and finds that the fire was no accident; it was a cover to hide that three of the dead men, one of whom was his brother, were murdered. He also discovers several unburned supplies hidden in the bottom of a hut, while Swanson finds a gun hidden in a petrol tank. The surviving members of Zebra are brought on board the &quot;Dolphin&quot;, and the station is abandoned. While still under the ice, a fire breaks out in the engine room and the sub is forced to shut down its nuclear reactor. The crew succeeds in saving the ship, after several hours of hard labour, and thanks to Swanson&#x27;s ingenuity.

Carpenter calls a meeting of the survivors, and announces that the fire was no accident. He reveals that he is an MI6 officer, and that his real mission was to retrieve photographic film from a reconnaissance satellite (see Corona) that has photographed every missile base in the US. The film had been ejected from the satellite so that Soviet agents operating under cover at Zebra could retrieve it; Carpenter&#x27;s brother had been sent to the station to prevent this. Carpenter reveals the identity of the Soviet agents, and arrests them.

The film of the US bases is recovered, but Carpenter has switched the film on the Soviets. The film they successfully sent to the Soviet surface ships is actually photographs of cartoon characters on the walls of the submarine&#x27;s sick bay.

==Background and origin of plot==
The novel was influenced by the heightened atmosphere of the Cold War, with its escalating series of international crises in the late 1950s and early 1960s, such as the U-2 incident; West Berlin; unrest in Hungary, Indochina, Congo, and Latin America; and the Cuban Missile Crisis.

The novel exploits contemporary fascination with the under-the-ice exploits of such American nuclear-powered submarines as (first to pass under the North Pole), , and . MacLean may have been anticipating the excitement of his British readers regarding the upcoming commissioning of , the Royal Navy&#x27;s first nuclear submarine. Also, MacLean may have been influenced by press reports about the nuclear-powered submarine USS &quot;Skate&quot; visiting Ice Station &quot;Alpha&quot;, located on Ice Island T-3 in the Arctic, on 14 August 1958, as part of the International Geophysical Year (IGY)&quot;. At the time that the novel was published, under-the-ice operations by US Navy nuclear-powered submarines were prohibited until SUBSAFE measures had been implemented following the loss of .

&quot;Ice Station Zebra&quot; also uses the accelerating Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union as the backdrop for the novel, and may have been directly inspired by news accounts from 17 April 1959, about a missing experimental Corona satellite capsule (Discoverer 2) that inadvertently landed near Spitzbergen on 13 April and may have been recovered by Soviet agents. In 2006 the National Reconnaissance Office declassified information stating that &quot;an individual formerly possessing CORONA access was the technical adviser to the movie&quot; and admitted &quot;the resemblance of the loss of the DISCOVERER II capsule, and its probable recovery by the Soviets&quot; on Spitsbergen Island, to the book by Alistair MacLean.

The story has parallels with CIA Operation Cold Feet, which took place in May/June 1962. In this operation, two American officers parachuted from a CIA-operated Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress to an abandoned Soviet ice station. After searching the station, they were picked up three days later by the B-17 using the Fulton Sky hook system.

Finally, MacLean even mentions the newly-operational Soviet nuclear-powered icebreaker by involving the ship in an aborted attempt to reach the survivors at Drift Ice Station Zebra.

Maclean says he got much of the technical information of the novel from the book &quot;Nautilus 90 North&quot; by William Anderson.

==Reception==
The &quot;New York Times&quot; called it &quot;an exciting adventure&quot;. Another review said Maclean&#x27;s &quot;gift for sustained excitement is remarkable.&quot;

==Film adaptation==

===1968 film===
The novel was later very loosely adapted into the 1968 John Sturges film of the same name starring Rock Hudson. The most obvious changes involved the names of the novel&#x27;s characters:

* The nuclear submarine &quot;Dolphin&quot; became USS &quot;Tigerfish&quot;.
* The British spy Dr. Carpenter was renamed David Jones, portrayed by Patrick McGoohan.
* Commander Swanson was changed to Commander Ferraday, portrayed by Hudson.

Additional characters were added, including a US Marine platoon trained in Arctic warfare:

* Soviet defector Boris Vaslov, portrayed by Ernest Borgnine
* Marine Captain Leslie Anders, portrayed by Jim Brown
* 1st Lt. Russell Walker, portrayed by Tony Bill

Much of the novel&#x27;s characterisation involving the submarine&#x27;s crew was jettisoned in favour of these new cinematic creations. Also all characters from the Ice Station &quot;Zebra&quot; in the novel were removed. They were claimed to have died in the fire, notably two main villains who had caused the fire in the first place. Also removed were all references to Dr. Carpenter&#x27;s brother.

Beyond the name change, the film&#x27;s submarine has a design similar to the first nuclear-powered submarine, &quot;Nautilus&quot;, rather than the more streamlined, teardrop-shaped vessel, either the contemporaneous or &quot;Permit&quot; design, that was described in the novel. In the movie, the fire on the drift Ice Station was explained away as accidental.

The Soviet interest in recovering the lost spy satellite is shown early in the film when a spy ship disguised as a fishing trawler waits outside Holy Loch when the &quot;Tigerfish&quot; sets sail. The nearly fatal flooding of the forward torpedo room, before the intermission, is the only time in the film where the submarine is shown to be in jeopardy, unlike the novel where a fire in the engine room nearly kills the entire crew. The film does not show the return trip of the submarine. In the novel, the survivors of Ice Station Zebra are rescued and it is on the return trip that the saboteur of the station sets fire to the engine room in an attempt to get the satellite pictures out. The film&#x27;s climax involves a superpower confrontation between Soviet paratroopers and the US Marines at Ice Station Zebra itself, but concludes on a much more ambiguous note than the novel, reflecting the perceived thaw in the Cold War following the Cuban Missile Crisis.

===Remake===
On 6 May 2013, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; reported that Warner Bros. will undertake a remake of &quot;Ice Station Zebra&quot;, with Christopher McQuarrie signed to direct and write the screenplay for the film.

==Popular culture==
The novel is referenced in the 19th episode of the second season of &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;, &quot;Snow Way to Treat a Lady, Part 2&quot;. After a second avalanche during the night while everyone was sleeping, Larry wakes up in the morning in discomfort. he pulls a book from under him and reads the title &quot;Ice Station Zebra?&quot;, and throws it aside.

The novel is referenced in &quot;The Leadership Breakfast&quot;, the eleventh episode of the second season of &quot;The West Wing&quot;. While building a fire, Josh Lyman (played by Bradley Whitford) says, &quot;It&#x27;s like Ice Station Zebra in here.&quot;

The novel is parodied in the &quot;Sealab 2021&quot; third-season episode, &quot;Frozen Dinner&quot;. The Sealab crew must rescue scientists aboard Ice Station Zebra, a research station on top of an ice floe. The ice floe has turned upside down and trapped the two men, while the Sealab crew tries to rescue them in a submarine. While the scientists immediately turn to cannibalism, the Sealab sub – led by a German crew resembling that from &quot;Das Boot&quot; – predictably fumbles the rescue.

The movie adaptation of the novel is referenced in &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; Episode 23 of season 2 &quot;The Monopolar Expedition&quot;.

Howard Hughes&#x27;s obsession with the movie adaptation of the novel is referenced in &quot;I Wanna Be a Boss&quot;, a 1991 song by American singer-songwriter Stan Ridgway.

In 2018 Jack White released a song with the title &quot;Ice Station Zebra&quot;.

In the eighth episode of the second season of the American television drama series &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;, &quot;Better Call Saul&quot;, there is a scene where the character Saul Goodman, played by Bob Odenkirk, asks his new client, Badger, played by Matt L. Jones, to send him a money order payable to &quot;Ice Station Zebra Associates&quot;, the company name Saul Goodman uses for his loan out for tax purposes.

In the first season of the British cartoon &quot;Danger Mouse&quot;, the 11th episode &quot;Ice Station Camel&quot; is a clear reference to the novel.

<doc id="502724" wikidata="Q58285" url="?curid=502724" title="Alexandru Averescu">
<text>Alexandru Averescu (; 9 March 1859 – 2 October 1938) was a Romanian marshal, diplomat and populist politician. A Romanian Armed Forces Commander during World War I, he served as Prime Minister of three separate cabinets (as well as being &quot;interim&quot; Foreign Minister in January–March 1918 and Minister without portfolio in 1938). He first rose to prominence during the peasants&#x27; revolt of 1907, which he helped repress with violence. Credited with engineering the defense of Moldavia in the 1916–1917 Campaign, he built on his popularity to found and lead the successful People&#x27;s Party, which he brought to power in 1920–1921, with backing from King Ferdinand I and the National Liberal Party (PNL), and with the notable participation of Constantin Argetoianu and Take Ionescu.

His controversial first mandate, marked by a political crisis and oscillating support from the PNL&#x27;s leader Ion I. C. Brătianu, played a part in legislating land reform and repressed communist activities, before being brought down by the rally of opposition forces. His second term of 1926–1927 brought a much-debated treaty with Fascist Italy, and fell after Averescu gave clandestine backing to the ousted Prince Carol. Faced with the People Party&#x27;s decline, Averescu closed deals with various right-wing forces and was instrumental in bringing Carol back to the throne in 1930. Relations between the two soured over the following years, and Averescu clashed with his fellow party member Octavian Goga over the king&#x27;s attitudes. Shortly before his death, he and Carol reconciled, and Averescu joined the Crown Council.

Averescu, who authored over 12 works on various military topics (including his memoirs from the frontline), was also an honorary member of the Romanian Academy and an Order of Michael the Brave recipient. He became a Marshal of Romania in 1930.

==Early life and career==
Averescu was born in Babele, United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia (later renamed to &quot;Alexandru Averescu&quot;, today , a village northwest of Izmail, Ukraine). The son of Constantin Averescu, who held the rank of &quot;sluger&quot;, he studied at the Romanian Orthodox seminary in Izmail, then at the School of Arts and Crafts in Bucharest (intending to become an engineer). In 1876, he decided to join the Gendarmes in Izmail.

Seeing action as a cavalry sergeant with the Romanian troops engaged in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, he was decorated on several occasions, but was later moved to reserve (after failing his medical examination due to the effects of frostbite). He was, however, reinstated later in 1878, and subsequently received a military education in Romania, at the military school of Târgoviște (Dealu Monastery), and in Italy, at the Military Academy of Turin. Averescu married an Italian opera singer, Clotilda Caligaris, who had been the prima donna of La Scala. His future collaborator and rival Constantin Argetoianu stated that Averescu &quot;chose Mrs. Clotilda at random&quot;.

Upon his return, Averescu steadily climbed through the ranks. He was head of the Bucharest Military Academy (1894–1895), and, in 1895–1898, Romania&#x27;s military &quot;attaché&quot; in the German Empire; a colonel in 1901, he was advanced to the rank of brigadier general and became head of the Tecuci regional Army Command Center in 1906.

Before the First World War, he led the troops in crushing the 1907 peasants&#x27; revolt — where he engaged in using very harsh means of repression, especially when dealing with soldiers who refused to fight against the rebels — and was subsequently Minister of War in Dimitrie Sturdza&#x27;s National Liberal Party (PNL) cabinet (1907–1909). According to the recollections of Eliza Brătianu, a split occurred between him and the PNL after Averescu attempted to advance various political goals — the conflict erupted when he sought support with King Carol I and then, as the National Liberals deeply resented Romania&#x27;s alliance with the Central Powers, he approached the Germans for backing.

Subsequently, he was commander of the First Infantry Division (stationed in Turnu Severin) and, later, of the Second Army Corps in Craiova. In 1912, he became a major general, and, in 1911–1913, he was Chief of the General Staff. In the latter capacity, Averescu organized the actions of Romanian troops operating south of the Danube in the Second Balkan War (the campaign against Bulgaria, during which his troops met no resistance).

==World War and first cabinet==

During the World War (which Romania entered in 1916), General Alexandru Averescu led the Second Romanian Army in the successful defense of the Predeal Pass, and was then moved to the head of the Third Army (following the latter&#x27;s defeat in the Battle of Turtucaia). He commanded Army Group South in the Flămânda operation against the Third Bulgarian Army and other forces of the Central Powers, ultimately stopped by the German offensive (Averescu&#x27;s forces did not register important losses, and orderly retreated to Moldavia, where Romanian authorities had taken refuge from the successful German operations).

Averescu again led the Second Army to victory in the Battle of Mărăști (August 1917); his achievements, including his brief breakthrough at Mărăști, were considered impressive by public opinion and his officers. However, several military historians rate Averescu and his fellow Romanian generals very poorly, arguing that, overall, their direction of the war &quot;could not have been worse&quot;. Despite controlling an army of 500,000 plus 100,000 Russian reinforcements, they were defeated by a German-Austrian-Bulgarian army of 910,000 in less than four months of combat.

Averescu was widely seen as the person behind a relatively successful resistance to further offensives on Moldavia (the single piece of territory still held by the Romanian state), and he was considered by many of his contemporaries to have stood in contrast to what was seen as endemic corruption and incompetence. The state of affairs, together with the October Revolution in Russia, was to be blamed for the eventual Romanian surrender to the Central Powers; promoted Premier by King Ferdinand I during the period of crisis, Averescu began armistice talks with August von Mackensen in Buftea and Focșani, but was vehemently opposed to the terms — he resigned, leaving the Alexandru Marghiloman cabinet when it signed the Treaty of Bucharest. Despite Averescu&#x27;s talks yielding no result, he was repeatedly attacked by his political adversaries for having initiated them.
During the period, he also faced a Russian Bolshevik military action: just before Averescu came to power, as Russia&#x27;s Leon Trotsky negotiated the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany, the &quot;Rumcherod&quot; administrative body in Odessa, led by Christian Rakovsky, ordered an offensive from the east into Romania. In order to prevent further losses, Averescu signed his name to a much-criticized temporary armistice with the &quot;Rumcherod&quot;; eventually, Rakovsky was himself faced with a German offensive (sparked by the temporary breakdown of negotiations at Brest-Litovsk), and had to abandon both his command and the base in Odessa.

==People&#x27;s Party==

===Character===
Averescu quit the army in the spring of 1918, aiming for a career in politics — initially, with a message that was hostile to the National Liberal Party (PNL) and its leader Ion I. C. Brătianu.

He presided over the People&#x27;s Party (initially named &quot;People&#x27;s League&quot;), and he was immensely popular especially among peasants after the end of the war. His force had an appealing populist message, translated into vague promises and relying on the image of the General: peasants had been promised land at the beginning of the war (and they were being rewarded with it at the very moment, through an agrarian reform that reached its full scope in 1923); they had formed the larger part of the Army, and had come to see Averescu as the one to fulfill their expectations, as well as a figure who was still commanding their allegiance. Eliza Brătianu, the PNL leader&#x27;s wife, placed Averescu&#x27;s ascension in the context of Greater Romania&#x27;s creation through the addition of Bessarabia, Bukovina, and Transylvania (while making use of the condescending National Liberal tone towards the Romanian National Party that was emerging triumphant in previously Austro-Hungarian Transylvania):
&quot;[The] so very harsh losses [during the war], the defeats suffered by the Old Kingdom, the traces of foreign domination in the newly acquired provinces, but most of all the state of unhealthy euphoria that had taken hold of Transylvania, who had begun, in all good faith, to believe that only she had made the union happen, all of these have created a sort of insecurity within the borders of [Greater Romania].&quot;

As the movement initially tended to describe itself as a social trend rather than a political party, it also attracted former members of the Conservative Party (such as Constantin Argetoianu, Constantin Garoflid, and Take Ionescu), military men such as Constantin Coandă, the Democratic Nationalist Party leader A. C. Cuza, the notorious supporters of &quot;dirigisme&quot; Mihail Manoilescu and Ștefan Zeletin, the moderate nationalist Duiliu Zamfirescu, the future diplomat Citta Davila, the journalist D. R. Ioaniţescu, the left-wing agrarianist Petru Groza, the Bukovinian leader Iancu Flondor, and the lawyer Petre Papacostea. Additional support came from Transylvanian activists such as Octavian Goga and Teodor Mihail, who had previously left the Romanian National Party there in protest over the policies of its president Iuliu Maniu. Nevertheless, the People&#x27;s Party did attempt to approach Maniu for an alliance at various intervals after summer 1919 (according to Argetoianu, their attempts were frustrated by King Ferdinand I, whose relationship with Maniu was cordial at the time, and who allegedly stated &quot;Maniu is no one else&#x27;s! Maniu is mine!&quot;).

The grouping also established close links with &quot;Garda Conștiinței Naționale&quot; (GCN, &quot;The National Awareness Guard&quot;), a reactionary group formed by the electrician Constantin Pancu, engaged in violence against communist activists in Iași (the latter were feared by Averescu as well). Nevertheless, in late 1919, Averescu and Argetoianu approached the Socialist Party of Romania and its associate, the Social Democratic Party of Transylvania and Banat, with an offer for collaboration, negotiating the matter with the parties&#x27; reformist leaders — Ioan Flueraș, Ilie Moscovici, and Iosif Jumanca. At the time, Argetoianu claimed, his conversations with Moscovici revealed the fact that the latter was growing suspicious of the party&#x27;s far left wing, where &quot;the blanket-maker Cristescu and others were agitating&quot;. Averescu proposed merging the two parties, as a distinct section, into the People&#x27;s Party; he was refused, and talks broke down when the general expected the Socialists to support his electoral platform.

===Impact===
According to Eliza Brătianu (who was comparing Averescu with the French rebel soldier Georges Boulanger), several voices inside his movement called on Averescu to lead a republican &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; against King Ferdinand and his wife — a move allegedly prevented only by the general&#x27;s loyalism. Argetoianu, who admitted that &quot;I shook hands with Averescu [...] expecting a dictatorial regime&quot;, claimed that, during his stay in Italy, the general had been decisively influenced by Radicalism and the &quot;Risorgimento&quot; movement. This, in Argetoianu&#x27;s view, was the cause for his repeated involvement in conspiracies; he recalled that, in 1919, Davila&#x27;s house was the scene of regular reunion of officers, who plotted Brătianu&#x27;s ousting and pondered dethroning the king (in this version of events, Averescu initially accepted to be proclaimed dictator, but, around October of that year, called on conspirators to renounce their plan).

Aiming to answer most of Romania&#x27;s social and political issues, the League&#x27;s founding document called for:
&quot;A land reform, with the passage of the land which is at the moment expropriated only on principle [ - a reference to the 1917 promise for a land reform] into the effective and immediate ownership of villagers through the means of communes; an electoral reform, through universal suffrage, direct election, secret ballot, and compulsory voting, with representation given to ethnic minorities, since the latter would not hinder the free manifestation of political individualities; administrative decentralization.&quot;

According to Argetoianu,
&quot;in the autumn of 1919, [Averescu&#x27;s] popularity had reached its peak. In the villages, people would dream of him, some swore that they had seen him descending from an airplane into their midst, others, who had fought in the war, told that they had lived by his side in the trenches, it was through him that hopes were solidified, and he was expected of to provide a miracle for people to live a carefree and fulfilling life. His popularity was something mystical, something supernatural, and all sorts of legends had begun to surround this Messiah of the Romanian people.&quot;

Although he was also Prime Minister of Romania for three mandates (1918, 1920–1921, 1926–1927), his political success is not as spectacular as the military one. Averescu ended up as one of the pawns maneuvered by Brătianu. Argetoianu later repeatedly expressed his distaste for Averescu&#x27;s hesitant stance and openness to compromise.

==Second cabinet==

===Establishment===
Initially, Brătianu approached Averescu using their shared displeasure over the Alexandru Vaida-Voevod Romanian National Party (PNR)-Peasants&#x27; Party (PȚ) cabinet; the National Liberals managed to obtain the general&#x27;s renunciation of his goal to prosecute their party for alleged mis-management of Romania before and during the war, as well as his promise to respect the 1866 Constitution of Romania when carrying out the planned land reform. At the same time, Brătianu kept a tight relationship with King Ferdinand.

On March 13, 1920, he gave news of the Vaida-Voevod cabinet&#x27;s dissolution, and was widely expected to call for early elections as soon as this had happened. Instead, he read a document convened with King Ferdinand, which suspended Parliament (the first legislative body in &quot;Greater Romania&quot;) for ten days — the measure was intended to give Averescu the time to negotiate a new majority in the chambers. These moves caused a vocal response from the opposition: Nicolae Iorga, who was president of the Chamber of Deputies and sided with the National Party, called for a motion of no confidence to be passed on March 26; in return, Averescu obtained the support of the monarch in dissolving the Parliament, and invested his cabinet&#x27;s energies into winning the early elections by enlisting the help of county-level officials (local administration came to be dominated by People&#x27;s Party officials). It carried the vote with 206 seats (223 together with Take Ionescu&#x27;s Conservative-Democratic Party).

As agreements between the PNR and PȚ broke down (with the PNR awaiting for new developments), the PȚ joined Iorga&#x27;s party, the Democratic Nationalists, in creating the &quot;Federation of National-Social Democracy&quot; (which also drew support from the group around Nicolae L. Lupu).

===Policies===
His mandate was marked by the signing of the Treaty of Trianon with Hungary, and initial steps leading to the creation of the Little Entente—formed by Romania with Czechoslovakia and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. It was also at this stage that Romania and the Second Polish Republic inaugurated their military alliance (&quot;see Polish–Romanian alliance&quot;). The goal to create a &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; against Bolshevist Russia also brought him and his Minister of the Interior Argetoianu to oversee repression measures against the group of Socialist Party of Romania members who voted in favor of joining the Comintern (arrested on suspicion of &quot;attempt against the state&#x27;s security&quot; on May 12, 1921). This came after a long debate in Parliament over the imprisonment of Mihai Gheorghiu Bujor, a Romanian citizen who had joined the Russian Red Army in Bessarabia during the later stages of the October Revolution, and who had been tried for treason. Argetoianu, who proclaimed communism to be &quot;over in Romania&quot;, later indicated that Averescu and other members of the cabinet were hesitant about the crackdown, and that he ultimately resorted to taking initiative for the arrests — thus presenting his fellow politicians with a &quot;fait accompli&quot;.

The regions coming under Romania&#x27;s administration at the end of the war still maintained their ad hoc administrative structures, including the Transylvanian Directory Council, set up and dominated by the PNR; Averescu ordered these dissolved in April, facing protest from local notabilities. At the same time, he ordered all troops to be demobilized. He unified currency around the Romanian leu, and imposed a land reform in the form in which it was to be carried out by the new Brătianu executive. In fact, the latter measure had been imposed by the outgoing PNL cabinet through the order of Ion G. Duca, in a manner which Argetoianu described as &quot;destructive&quot;. As an initial step, Averescu&#x27;s government appointed the noted activist Vasile Kogălniceanu, a deputy for Ilfov County, as &quot;rapporteur&quot;; Kogălniceanu used this position to give an account of the agrarian situation in Romania, stressing the role played by his ancestor, Constantin, in abolishing Moldavian serfdom, as well as that of his father, Mihail Kogălniceanu, in eliminating &quot;corvées&quot; throughout Romania.

The People&#x27;s Party found itself hard pressed to limit the effects of the reform as promised by Duca — reason why Constantin Garoflid, seen by Argetoianu as &quot;the Conservative and theorist of large-scale landed property&quot;, was promoted as Minister of Agriculture. Argetoianu also accused the Premier of endorsing reform in an even more radical shape, and contended that:
&quot;[...] peasants blessed «father Averescu», who gave them land, and rallied around him even tighter. Brătianu, Duca, they were nowhere mentioned except in curses. O, human gratitude!&quot;

In October 1920, Averescu reached an agreement with the Allied Powers, recognizing Bessarabia&#x27;s union with Romania — expressing a hope for the Bolshevik government to be overthrown, it also imposed the region&#x27;s cession on a projected democratic government in Russia (while calling for further negotiations between it and Romania); throughout the interwar period, the Soviet Union refused to bind itself to the provisions of the agreement. Italy also refused to ratify the document, citing, alongside various foreign interests (including its friendship with the Soviet Union), the 250 million Italian lire owed to Italian investors in Romanian state bonds.

===Scandals and fall===
In March 1921, Argetoianu became implicated in a scandal involving the actions of his associate Aron Schuller, who had attempted to contract a 20 million lire loan with a bank in Italy, using as collateral Romanian war bonds that he had illegally obtained from the Finance Ministry reserve.

With Nicolae Titulescu as Finance Minister, Averescu resumed the interventionist course in economic policies, but broke with tradition when he attempted to legislate a major increase in taxes and proposed nationalizations — with potential negative effects on the PNL-voting middle class. The National Liberals, through the voice of Alexandru Constantinescu-Porcu, helped exploit the rivalry between the Peasants&#x27; Party and Iorga, using the latter&#x27;s rejection of Constantin Stere (a conflict sparked by Stere&#x27;s support for Germany during the World War); Stere won partial elections for the deputy seat in Soroca, Bessarabia, causing a political scandal which saw all parties (including the PNR) declare their dissatisfaction. The conflict worsened during a prolonged parliamentary debate over Averescu&#x27;s proposal to nationalize enterprises in Reșița (an initiative the opposition mistrusted, alleging that the new owners were to be People&#x27;s Party members), when Argetoianu addressed a mumbled insult to the Peasant Party&#x27;s Virgil Madgearu. Ion G. Duca of the PNL expressed his sympathies to Madgearu (who had repeated out an obscene word whispered by Argetoianu), and all opposition groups appealed to Ferdinand, asking for Averescu&#x27;s recall (July 14, 1921).

Ferdinand then attempted to facilitate a fusion between the Romanian National Party and the National Liberals, but negotiations broke down after disagreements over the possible leadership. Eventually, Brătianu convened with Ferdinand his return to power, and the king called on Foreign Minister Take Ionescu to resign, thus causing a political crisis that profited the PNL and put an end to the Averescu cabinet.

Shows of popular support in Bucharest were called of by Averescu himself, after he had negotiated with Brătianu for a People&#x27;s Party cabinet to be formed &quot;at a proper time&quot;. Ionescu took over as premier until late January 1922, when he was replaced by Brătianu.

==Third cabinet==

===New political alliances===
In early 1926, the general was again named Premier, and approached the PNR and its close ally, the Peasants&#x27; Party, proposing a merger around his leadership. This met with a stiff refusal, as it seemed that the two were about to win the elections with additional support, but the king, suspicious of the left-wing credentials of the Peasants&#x27; Party, used his Royal Prerogative and nominated Averescu as premier (with PNL support).

Averescu&#x27;s party was instead joined by PNR dissidents, Vasile Goldiș and Ioan Lupaș, who represented a Romanian Orthodox segment of the Transylvanian voters (rather than the Greek Catholics supporting Iuliu Maniu). The 1926 elections, which Averescu&#x27;s cabinet organized in March and won with a landslide (269 mandates) also brought a massive defeat for the PNL, who held just 16 seats in the Chamber of Deputies.

===Italian-Romanian Treaty===
Although not fascist itself, the new government he formed displayed gestures of friendship towards Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Fascist Italy, a state which advertised itself as a rising force — &quot;The Nation&quot; called Averescu &quot;Romania&#x27;s Mussolini&quot;, as &quot;an epithet which the new premier of Rumania bestowed upon himself&quot;. Contacts established (as early as June 1926, when Mihail Manoilescu had negotiated a loan in Rome) were one of the major points of divergence between the policies of Averescu and those of Brătianu: the former attempted to overcome the embarrassment provoked by Mussolini when, due to Romania&#x27;s debt, the Italian government had recalled the ambassador and had refused to permit King Ferdinand&#x27;s pre-convened visit.

The loan convened by Manoilescu and Mussolini made important concessions to Italy in return for a clarification of Romania&#x27;s debt status; it also led to the signing of a five-year &quot;Friendship Treaty&quot; (September 16), widely condemned by Romanian public opinion for not having called on Italy to state its support for Romanian rule in Bessarabia, and created tension inside the Little Entente (Yugoslavia feared that Italy had attempted to gain Romania&#x27;s neutrality in case of a potential irredentist conflict). Writing at the time, Constantin Vișoianu also criticized the vague terms in which the sections of the document dealing with mutual defense had been drafted:
&quot;What have we gained from Italy through this pact? Nothing. In truth, article 3 — which does not [even] refer to Bessarabia — makes provisions for the eventuality of a &quot;violent&quot; incursion and organizes a mutual assistance system [that is] original through its Platonic love-like character.&quot;

The treaty expired in 1932, and, after being prolonged by six months, it was not renewed. Overall, the political impact of contacts was minor, given that the Italians mistrusted the Romanian movement for its traditional role as instrument for Brătianu. Referring to the parallel project to marry Princess Ileana to Prince Umberto of Italy, Averescu himself allegedly stated: &quot;I didn&#x27;t get much from Italy except a throne for a Princess of Rumania&quot;.

===Averescu&#x27;s controversial projects===
Averescu continued to offer his support to far right groups (especially to the National-Christian Defense League formed by A. C. Cuza, his early collaborator), and probably considered assuming dictatorial powers.

The cabinet clashed with Brătianu when it was discovered that it had been negotiating in secret with the disinherited Prince Carol (a traditional adversary of the PNL) as Ferdinand&#x27;s health was taking a turn for the worse (Averescu later claimed that he had been asked by Brătianu: &quot;So, after I have brought you to power, you wish to rise and dominate?&quot;). The PNL withdrew its support, and, through an order signed by Constantin Hiott, Averescu&#x27;s was replaced by the broad coalition government of Barbu Știrbey, Brătianu&#x27;s brother-in-law. The general&#x27;s deposition, confirmed by King Ferdinand on his deathbed, created a vacuum on the Right, soon filled by the Iron Guard, a fascist movement formed by Corneliu Zelea Codreanu (formerly an associate of Cuza&#x27;s).

==Late 1920s politics==

The People&#x27;s Party involved itself in solving the dynastic crisis after Ferdinand&#x27;s death in July 1927, again approaching Carol to replace the child-king Michael and Prince Nicholas&#x27; regency. In November 1927, Averescu took the stand in the trial of his supporter Mihail Manoilescu, who was arrested after having incited pro-Carol sentiment; in his testimony, he backed the notion that, despite his initial anger, Ferdinand had ultimately planned to have Carol return to the throne.

His grouping lost much of its supporters to the newly formed National Peasants&#x27; Party, and scored under 2% in the 1927 elections. Around 1930, Averescu began opposing the universal suffrage he had endorsed earlier, and issued an appeal to the intellectuals in order to have it discarded from legislation on the basis that it was easily influenced by the parties in power. He and his supporter, the pro-authoritarian poet Octavian Goga, received criticism from the left-wing Poporanist journal &quot;Viața Românească&quot;, who claimed that Averescu had in fact provoked and encouraged widespread electoral irregularities during his time in office.

In November 1930, he filed a complaint against the poet and journalist Bazil Gruia, claiming that the latter had libeled him by publishing, in January, an article in &quot;Chemarea&quot; which began by questioning the People&#x27;s Party claim that Averescu was &quot;the only honest comrade of the Romanian peasant&quot; and contrasted it with the general&#x27;s activities during the 1907 Revolt. The trial was held in Cluj, and Gruia was represented in court by Radu R. Rosetti. On December 1, Gruia was found guilty and sentenced to 15 days in a correctional facility with reprieve, and to a fine of 3,000 lei (soon after, Gruia benefited from a pardon).

Averescu was promoted to Marshal of Romania in the same year, during the time when Carol returned to rule as King — the appointment was attributed by &quot;Time&quot; to his political support for the latter&#x27;s return. According to the same source, by the end of 1930, Averescu was again at the center of Romanian politics, owing to Carol&#x27;s favor, to the deaths of Ion I. C. and Vintilă Brătianu, and to the unexpected support he gained from the PNL dissident Gheorghe I. Brătianu.

== Final years ==

He ultimately showed himself hostile to Carol&#x27;s inner circle, and especially to the king&#x27;s lover Magda Lupescu; consequently, Goga was instigated by Carol to take over as leader of the People&#x27;s Party, and the latter attacked Averescu for &quot;subverting [...] the traditional respect enjoyed by the Crown&quot;. The clash led to Goga&#x27;s creation of the splinter National Agrarian Party, which, although never an important force, obtained more of the vote in the 1932 elections (approx. 3% compared to Averescu&#x27;s 2%).

Around 1934, as the Guard proclaimed its allegiance to Nazi Germany, the Italians (still rivals of Adolf Hitler), approached Averescu (as well as Manoilescu, Nicolae Iorga, Nichifor Crainic, Cuza, Goga, and other non-Guardist reactionaries), with an offer for collaboration (&quot;see Comitati d&#x27;azione per l&#x27;universalità di Roma&quot;). This apparent alliance was, in fact, marked by major dissensions — Averescu and Iorga were routinely attacked by Crainic&#x27;s &quot;Calendarul&quot;. Eventually, Averescu&#x27;s group formed, in 1934, the &quot;Constitutional Front&quot;, a nationalist electoral alliance with the National Liberal Party-Brătianu, which was joined by Mihai Stelescu&#x27;s Crusade of Romanianism (an Iron Guard offshoot), and the minor party created by Grigore Forțu (the &quot;Citizen Bloc&quot;); after the latter two parties disappeared, the Front survived in its original form until 1936, when it disbanded.

In 1937, despite his ongoing feud with Carol, Averescu was appointed a member of the Crown Council. Argetoianu recalled that he and the Marshal had reconciled — at a time when Argetoianu pondered rallying all opposition forces, including the National Peasants&#x27; Party, the National Liberal Party-Brătianu, and the Iron Guard, in a single electoral bloc (before the general election of December, the various groups successfully negotiated an electoral pact against the government of Gheorghe Tătărescu). Averescu, who, according to Argetoianu, declared was more interested in convincing Carol to allow his estranged wife Elena of Greece to return to Romania, remained opposed to the deal.

The following year, he was briefly minister without portfolio in the cabinet of Premier Miron Cristea, created by Carol to combat the ascension of the Iron Guard, and opposed the monarch&#x27;s option to renounce the 1923 Constitution and proclaim his dictatorship (the latter move signaled the end of the People&#x27;s Party), but was among the figures displayed by Carol&#x27;s regime. He died soon after in Bucharest, and was buried in the World War I heroes&#x27; crypt in Mărăști. In December, the king created the National Renaissance Front as the political instrument of his authoritarian rule.

<doc id="502726" wikidata="Q730149" url="?curid=502726" title="Samuel Johnston">
<text>Samuel Johnston (December 15, 1733 – August 17, 1816) was an American planter, lawyer, Grand Master of Freemasons, slave holder, and statesman from Chowan County, North Carolina. He represented North Carolina in both the Continental Congress and the United States Senate, and he was the sixth Governor of North Carolina.

==Early life and education revolution==
Johnston was born in Dundee, Scotland, in the Kingdom of Great Britain, on December 15, 1733. In 1736, he accompanied his father, Samuel Sr., in relocating to Onslow County, in what was then colonial-era Province of North Carolina. Samuel Sr. became surveyor-general of the colony. Young Samuel was educated in New England, and then read law in Carolina. He moved to Chowan County and started a plantation known as Hayes near Edenton.

==Career==
Johnston was admitted to the bar and began a law practice in Edenton. In 1759, he was elected to the North Carolina House of Burgesses and served in that body until it was displaced in 1775 during the American Revolution. During North Carolina&#x27;s War of the Regulation in December 1770, he introduced the anti-Regulators bill was later passed as the Johnston Riot Act in response to the September 1770 Hillsborough Riot and to later reports of a planned Regulator march upon the provincial capital, New Bern, which ultimately did not occur. The passage of the Johnston Riot Act and others precipitated an even more significant enlargement of the Regulator movement and forced Royal Governor Tryon to call out the provincial militia, which culminated in the Battle of Alamance on May 16, 1771. As a strong supporter of independence, he was also elected as a delegate to the first four provincial congresses and presided over the Third and Fourth congresses in 1775 and 1776. After Royal Governor Josiah Martin abdicated in 1775, he was the highest-ranking official in the state until Richard Caswell was elected president of the Fifth Provincial Congress.

Johnston is frequently cited as having served in the North Carolina Senate in 1779, but that is not confirmed in Senate Journals. He may have been elected, but he certainly did not attend. In Johnston&#x27;s own words, after 1777, &quot;...had nothing to do with public business...&quot; during the Revolution. Under the new state government, Johnston was elected to the North Carolina Senate in 1783 and 1784.

Johnston was the first Grand Master of Freemasons for the State of North Carolina, voted into office on 11 Dec 1787 to revive Masonic activities that had been defunct after breaking away from England. There had only been Deputy Grand Master until he was elected Grand Master. He would be elected Grand Master again in 1789-1791.

==Election as president==
North Carolina sent Johnston as a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1780 and 1781. Johnston was elected the first &quot;President of the United States in Congress Assembled&quot; under the Articles of Confederation, but he declined the office. This was reported on July 10, 1781:
==Later career and death==
Johnston served as Governor of North Carolina from 1787 to 1789. He presided over both conventions called to ratify the US Constitution. The one in 1788 rejected the Constitution despite Johnston&#x27;s strong support. He called another convention in 1789, which decided on ratification. Johnston then resigned as governor to become one of the state&#x27;s first two US Senators and served from 1789 to 1793. In 1800, he was made a Judge in the Superior Court of North Carolina, an office he held until his retirement in 1803.

Johnston died at his home, Hayes Plantation, near Edenton, in Chowan County; he purchased the house from David Rieusett in 1765 and lived there until 1793 when he moved to the Hermitage, a plantation in Martin County. The 1790 Census shows that he enslaved 96 people at Hayes Plantation. In 1816 he was buried in the Johnston Burial Ground there. The plantation house is privately owned but was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1973. It is now within Edenton, but the current house was completed by his son, James Cathcart Johnston, a year after Samuel&#x27;s death.

On the Hayes farm, Edenton, North Carolina once owned by Johnston in 1983 a copy of the Declaration of Independence was found; in 2024 a copy of The Constitution of the United States was found

==Legacy==
Samuel Johnston&#x27;s collection of books, which he bequeathed to his son James, is preserved in a full-scale replication of Hayes Plantation&#x27;s library at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The octagon-shaped historic room is on permanent exhibit in the North Carolina Collection Gallery in Wilson Library.

<text>Donald Edward Williams (February 13, 1942 – February 23, 2016) was an American naval officer and aviator, test pilot, mechanical engineer and NASA astronaut. He logged a total of 287 hours and 35 minutes in space.

==Early life and education==
Captain Williams was born February 13, 1942, in Lafayette, Indiana and raised in the nearby town of Green Hill. He graduated from Otterbein High School in Otterbein in 1960. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering from Purdue University in 1964.

==Navy service==
Williams received his commission through the Naval ROTC program at Purdue University. He completed flight training at Pensacola, Florida, Meridian, Mississippi and Kingsville, Texas, receiving his Naval Aviator wings in May 1966. After A-4 Skyhawk training, he made two Vietnam War deployments aboard the aircraft carrier with Attack Squadron 113 (VA-113). He served as a flight instructor in Attack Squadron 125 (VA-125) at Naval Air Station Lemoore, California for two years and transitioned to the A-7 Corsair II aircraft. He made two additional Vietnam deployments aboard &quot;Enterprise&quot; with Carrier Air Wing 14 staff and Attack Squadron 97 (VA-97). Williams completed a total of 330 combat missions.

In 1973, Williams attended the Armed Forces Staff College. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School at NAS Patuxent River, Maryland, in June 1974, and was assigned to the Naval Air Test Center&#x27;s Carrier Suitability Branch of Flight Test Division. From August 1976 to June 1977, following reorganization of the Naval Air Test Center, he was head of the Carrier Systems Branch, Strike Aircraft Test Directorate. He reported next for A-7 refresher training, and was assigned to Attack Squadron 94 (VA-94) when he was selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA.

He logged more than 6,000 hours of flying time, which includes 5,700 hours in jets and 745 carrier landings.

==NASA career==
Selected by NASA in January 1978, Williams became an astronaut in August 1979, qualified for assignment as a pilot on future Space Shuttle flight crews. He then had various support assignments, including working at the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL) as a test pilot, and at the Kennedy Space Center participating in orbiter test, checkout, launch and landing operations.

From September 1982 through July 1983, he was assigned as the Deputy Manager, Operations Integration, National Space Transportation System Program Office at the Johnson Space Center. From July 1985 through August 1986, Williams was the Deputy Chief of the Aircraft Operations Division at the Johnson Space Center, and from September 1986 through December 1988, he served as Chief of the Mission Support Branch within the Astronaut Office.

Williams served as pilot on STS-51-D in 1985, and was the spacecraft commander on STS-34 in 1989.

===Spaceflight experience===
STS-51-D (April 12–19, 1985) was launched from and returned to land at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida. During the mission, the crew deployed ANIK-C for Telesat Canada, and Syncom IV-3 for the U.S. Navy. A malfunction in the Syncom spacecraft resulted in the first unscheduled EVA, rendezvous and proximity operations for the Space Shuttle in an attempt to activate the satellite. Additionally, the crew also conducted several medical experiments, two student experiments, activated two Getaway Specials, and filmed experiments with toys in space, including a two-minute sequence where Williams was the first person to juggle in micro-gravity. The mission was accomplished in 109 orbits of the Earth in 167 hours, 54 minutes.

STS-34 (October 18–23, 1989) was launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida and returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. During the mission the crew successfully deployed the Galileo spacecraft, starting its journey to explore Jupiter, operated the Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Instrument (SSBUV) to map atmospheric ozone, and performed numerous secondary experiments involving radiation measurements, polymer morphology, lightning research, microgravity effects on plants, and a student experiment on ice crystal growth in space. The mission was accomplished in 79 orbits of the Earth in 119 hours, 41 minutes.

==Post-NASA career==
In March 1990, Williams retired from the U.S. Navy as Captain, and left NASA. He joined Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), working on several projects in the Houston area, nationally, and internationally. In April 2006, Williams retired from SAIC.

Williams died of a stroke February 23, 2016, at the age of 74.

==Organizations==
Williams was a member of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots, the Association of Space Explorers, and the National Aeronautic Association.

<doc id="502730" wikidata="Q2425884" url="?curid=502730" title="New York City blackout of 1977">
<text>The New York City blackout of 1977 was an electricity blackout that affected most of New York City on July 13–14, 1977. The only unaffected neighborhoods in the city were in southern Queens (including neighborhoods of the Rockaways), which were part of the Long Island Lighting Company system, as well as the Pratt Institute campus in Brooklyn, and a few other large apartment and commercial complexes that operated their own power generators.

Unlike other blackouts that affected the region, namely the Northeast blackouts of 1965 and 2003, the 1977 blackout was confined to New York City and its immediate surrounding areas. The 1977 blackout also resulted in citywide looting and other criminal activity, including arson, unlike the 1965 and 2003 blackouts.

==Prelude==
===Lightning damage===

The events leading up to the blackout began on July 13, 1977 at 8:34 p.m. EDT on Wednesday, with a lightning strike at Buchanan South, a substation on the Hudson River, tripping two circuit breakers in Buchanan, New York. The Buchanan South substation converted the 345,000 volts of electricity originating from the 900 MW Indian Point nuclear generating station to lower voltage for commercial use. A loose locking nut combined with a slow-acting upgrade cycle prevented the breaker from reclosing and allowing power to flow again. 

A second lightning strike caused the loss of two 345 kV transmission lines, the subsequent reclose of only one of the lines, and the loss of power from the nuclear plant at Indian Point. As a result of the strikes, two other major transmission lines became overloaded. Per procedure, Consolidated Edison, the power provider for New York City and some of Westchester County, tried to bring a fast-start generating station online at 8:45 p.m. EDT; however, no one was manning the station, and the remote start failed. Other, manned plants successfully started, but several had removed some of their turbines from service for routine maintenance and could not provide their rated load.

At 8:55 p.m., a third lightning strike hit Sprain Brook substation in Yonkers, which took out two additional critical transmission lines. Because the system design had prioritized protecting the already-isolated Indian Point plant, only the north-south line automatically returned to service. The poor design of Con Edison&#x27;s control-room displays did not clearly display this fact to the operator at the time.

The second opening of a transmission line left Con Edison system disconnected from key generating stations across the Hudson river. Instead, their power flowed to cross-river lines in Newark or upstate New York and then turned towards New York City. The remaining lines into New York City could not carry this excess power without exceeding their long-term capacity limits.

===Power reductions===
Con Edison&#x27;s control room operator recognized that the extant north-south lines could not maintain their existing loads for long and asked New York Power Pool (NYPP) operators in Guilderland to reduce transmission on the overloaded lines. Implicitly, the Con Edison operator meant that they should use the cross-river lines near Indian Point, because he did not realize that all of those circuits remained open following the 8:55 lightning strike. NYPP, who could see that the lines had tripped out of service, instead warned that a major interconnection to New Jersey Public Service Electric and Gas Company was also overloaded, and recommended shedding load. The two system operators repeatedly talked past each other without revealing the fundamental misunderstanding.

Meanwhile, problems at a local generator in the Con Edison East River facility required the power provider to reduce the plant&#x27;s loading. As the Con Edison system&#x27;s stability began to degrade, gas turbines at the Astoria plant could not synchronize with the system well enough to enter service. Each problem made an already dire situation worse.

At 9:08 p.m., Con Edison began shedding load via, first, a 5% system-wide voltage reduction, and then an 8% reduction. But the load lost thereby was too little, too late.

At 9:19 p.m., the final interconnection to upstate New York at Leeds substation tripped due to thermal overload. The 345 kV conductors had heated and sagged excessively into an unidentified object on the ground. This trip in turn caused the 138 kV links with Long Island to overload, and the line west to New Jersey began to overload even higher than previously reported.

At 9:22 p.m., Long Island Lighting Company opened its 345 kV interconnection to Con Edison to reduce power that was flowing through its system and overloading 138 kV submarine cables between Long Island and Connecticut. While Long Island operators were securing permission from the Power Pool operators to open their 345 kV tie to New York City, phase shifters between New York City and New Jersey were adjusted to correct the heavy flows, and this reduced the loading on the 115 kV cables. The Long Island operators did not notice the drop in 115 kV cable loadings, however, and proceeded with opening their 345 kV tie to New York City.

At 9:24 p.m., the Con Edison operator tried and failed to manually shed load by dropping customers. Five minutes later, at 9:29 p.m., the 230 kV Goethals-Linden interconnection with New Jersey finally tripped, leaving the Con Edison system isolated from the outside world.

==Blackout==
===Power failure===
Con Ed could not generate enough power within the city, and its system for automatically shedding load interacted poorly with the unusually high inductance of its buried transmission cables. Dropping large blocks of customers produced electric effects indistinguishable from a transient short inside the generation equipment. Just after 9:28 p.m., the biggest generator in New York City, the 990 MW Ravenswood Generating Unit No. 3 (also known as &quot;Big Allis&quot;), shut down to protect itself from an imagined short. When it shut down, the city could not avoid a blackout.

By 9:37 p.m., the entire ConEdison power system shut down, almost exactly an hour after the first lightning strike. By 10:26 p.m., operators started a restoration procedure. Power was not fully restored until late the following day. Among the outcomes of the blackout was the creation of detailed restoration procedures that are now well documented and used in operator training to reduce restoration time.

===Crime===
The blackout occurred when the city was facing a severe financial crisis and its residents were terrified by the Son of Sam murders. The nation as a whole, especially New York City, was suffering from a protracted economic downturn, and commentators have contrasted the event with the good-natured &quot;Where Were You When the Lights Went Out?&quot; atmosphere of 1965. Some pointed to the financial crisis as a root cause of the disorder; others noted the hot July weather, as the East Coast was in the middle of a brutal heat wave. Still others pointed out that the 1977 blackout came after businesses had closed and their owners had gone home, while in 1965, the blackout occurred in the late afternoon/early evening and many merchants were still at their properties. However, the 1977 looters continued their illegal activities into the daylight hours of the next day.

Looting and vandalism were widespread in New York City, hitting 31 neighborhoods. Possibly the hardest hit were Crown Heights, where 75 stores on a five-block stretch were looted and damaged, and Bushwick, where arson was rampant, with some 25 fires still burning the next morning. At one point, two blocks of Broadway in Brooklyn, which separates Bushwick from Bedford-Stuyvesant, were on fire. Thirty-five blocks of Broadway were destroyed: 134 stores looted, 45 of them also set ablaze. Thieves stole 50 new Pontiacs from a Bronx car dealership. In Brooklyn, youths were seen backing up cars to stores, tying ropes around the stores&#x27; grates, and using their cars to pull the grates away, then looting the stores. There were 550 police officers injured in the mayhem, and 4,500 looters were arrested.

Mayor Abe Beame spoke during the blackout about what citizens were up against during the blackout and what the costs would be.

We&#x27;ve seen our citizens subjected to violence, vandalism, theft, and discomfort. The Blackout has threatened our safety and has seriously impacted our economy. We&#x27;ve been needlessly subjected to a night of terror in many communities that have been wantonly looted and burned. The costs when finally tallied will be enormous.

During New York&#x27;s 2003 blackout, &quot;The New York Times&quot; ran a description of the blackout of 1977:

Because of the power failure, LaGuardia and Kennedy airports were closed down for about eight hours, automobile tunnels were closed because of lack of ventilation, and 4,000 people had to be evacuated from the subway system. ConEd called the shutdown an &quot;act of God,&quot; enraging Mayor Beame, who charged that the utility was guilty of &quot;gross negligence.&quot;

In all, 1,616 stores were damaged in looting and rioting. A total of 1,037 fires were responded to, including 14 multiple-alarm fires. In the largest mass arrest in city history, 3,776 people were arrested. Many had to be stuffed into overcrowded cells, precinct basements and other makeshift holding pens. A congressional study estimated that the cost of damages amounted to a little over $300 million (roughly equivalent to $1.5 billion in ).

In addition to the massive looting and violence that had accompanied it, there were four homicides. Three people died in the over a thousand fires set during the blackout, and in Brooklyn, a drugstore owner gunned down a man who was brandishing a crowbar at him while leading 30 youths past the store&#x27;s security fence.

Because of the chaos and the police being focused elsewhere, crime unrelated to the blackout also occurred. Dominick Ciscone, a Brooklyn teenager and aspiring mobster, was shot in the neighborhood of Carroll Gardens while in the company of some friends. He died at the scene. Police investigated several people with whom he had ongoing disputes, but never identified any suspects. In 1997, they received tips from individuals who did not identify themselves, but whom they believed genuinely might know who committed the crime; they did not respond to requests to identify themselves. , the killing remains unsolved.

===Shea Stadium===
Shea Stadium went dark at approximately 9:30 p.m., in the bottom of the sixth inning, with Lenny Randle at bat. The New York Mets were losing 2–1 against the Chicago Cubs. Jane Jarvis, Shea&#x27;s organist and &quot;Queen of Melody&quot;, played &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; and &quot;White Christmas&quot;. The game was completed two months later on September 16, with the Cubs winning 5–2. The Yankees were on the road at Milwaukee; less than a week later, Yankee Stadium hosted the All-Star Game on Tuesday, July 19.

===Return of power===
It was not until the next morning that power began being restored to those areas affected. Around 7 a.m. on July 14, a section of Queens became the first area to get power back, followed shortly afterward by Lenox Hill, Manhattan; the neighboring Yorkville area on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, though, was one of the last areas to get power back that Thursday evening. By 1:45 p.m., service was restored to half of Con Edison&#x27;s customers, mostly in Staten Island and Queens. It was not until 10:39 p.m. on July 14 that the entire city&#x27;s power was back online.

For much of July 14, most of the television stations in New York City were off the air (as the areas where those TV stations were located were still without power for much of the day), although WCBS-TV (Channel 2) and WNBC-TV (Channel 4) did manage to stay on the air thanks to gas and diesel-fueled generators, resuming their broadcasts only 25 and 88 minutes after the blackout began, respectively. Although much of New York City was still without power, Belmont Park (a racetrack on the border of Queens and Nassau County in Elmont) did stage their scheduled racing program that afternoon in front of a relatively sparse crowd, as many thought racing would be cancelled that day due to the blackout.

==Legacy==
===Music===
In late 1977, The Trammps released the song &quot;The Night the Lights Went Out&quot; to commemorate the electrical blackout.

The blackout is the subject of the 2022 song &#x27;Blackout77&#x27; by Crippled Black Phoenix.

David Bowie has stated the blackout was a possible influence on his 1977 song Blackout, &quot;I can&#x27;t in all honesty say that it was the NY one, though it is entirely likely that that image locked itself in my head.&quot;

There is a popular story that during the blackout numerous looters stole DJ equipment from electronics stores, and this helped spark the hip hop genre—but the only evidence is some speculation by two early DJs, DJ Disco Wiz and Curtis Fisher, who made the suggestion in an interview for Jim Fricke and filmmaker Charlie Ahearn, who printed it in their book &quot;Yes Yes Y&#x27;all.&quot; Caz later expanded from speculation to mythology, saying in a &quot;Slate&quot; article and podcast that, when the power went out, he and Wiz were playing records, running their equipment from an outlet in a park. At first they thought the outage was local and caused by something they had done, but realized when they heard stores closing that it was citywide and took advantage of the community&#x27;s vulnerability to steal a mixing board from a local business. &quot;I went right to the place where I bought my first set of DJ equipment, and I went and got me a mixer out of there.&quot; However, most early DJs dismiss this story as inaccurate, with Afrika Bambaataa stating that “Blackout &#x27;77 got nothin&#x27; to do with hip-hop . . . Whoever came with that is talking a lot of BS.”

===Complications===
The blackout also caused complications for the producers of the film &quot;Superman&quot;, who were shooting in the area. Tom Mankiewicz wrote in his memoir that cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth had attempted to draw power from a street light in order to get more light for the film, and mistakenly believed for months that this had caused the blackout.

The blackout took place at the start of a 9-day heat wave, which would begin on July 13 with temperatures reaching , and last until July 21 at , just two degrees off the all-time record high of , set on July 9, 1936, which occurred during the Dust Bowl.

The city was eventually given over $11 million by the Carter administration to pay for the damages of the blackout.

Beame accused Con Edison of &quot;gross negligence&quot; but would eventually feel the effect himself. In the mayoral election that year, Beame finished third in the Democratic primary to Ed Koch and Mario Cuomo. Koch would go on to win the general election.

The operating entities in New York fully investigated the blackout, its related causes, and the operator actions. They implemented significant changes, which are still in effect today, to guard against a similar occurrence. Despite these safeguards, there was a blackout in August 2003, although this was caused by a power system failure as far away as Eastlake, Ohio.

On July 13, 2019, on the 42nd anniversary of the event, a Con Edison blackout occurred, affecting 73,000 people on Manhattan&#x27;s West Side.

===Film===
The blackout was mentioned in the 1997 science fiction comedy, &quot;Men in Black&quot;. It was said to be caused by an alien playing a practical joke.

The 1977 blackout was also mentioned in the 2003 Disney Channel Original Movie &quot;The Cheetah Girls&quot; by character Drinka Champagne (Sandra Caldwell) at the school talent show during a blackout caused by a rescue attempt to save The Cheetah Girls&#x27; dog Toto.

===Television===
The blackout was a real-world plot setting reference in the 2020 conspiracy action TV series &quot;Hunters&quot;.

===Fiction===
Lee Child&#x27;s short story &quot;High Heat&quot; (2013) is about seventeen year old Jack Reacher first time visiting New York during this blackout.

===Video games===
In the 2005 video game &quot;The Warriors&quot;, the blackout is parodied during mission 4, though the game is set in 1979.

<text>Leon&#x27;s Furniture Ltd. () (Meubles Léon Limité in Quebec) is a Canadian furniture retailer which first opened its store in 1909 in Welland, Ontario. The controlling interest in the company is owned by the Leon family, while some shares are traded publicly on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The company has stores in all provinces of Canada.

==History==

Leon&#x27;s originated in the city of Welland, Ontario near the US border in the Niagara Region. It was founded by Ablan Leon, a Lebanese immigrant, who started out as a factory worker and then a door-to-door salesman. He was able to open a store with his profits in 1909. The original store (A. Leon Company at 244 King Street) was a dry goods outlet, which subsequently converted to furniture sales.

Leon&#x27;s original store was staffed primarily by his family. When he died in 1942, he left the company to his children. After expanding the original location, they built new stores in Southwestern Ontario.

The company moved into the Toronto area in the subsequent decades, purchasing several established outlets in the city and converting them to Leon&#x27;s name. The company went public in 1969 and opened its first warehouse showroom in 1973, touting it as the only one in Canada.

Today, roughly half of the store&#x27;s more than 50 outlets are owned corporately, while the remainder, mainly in rural areas or in cities with lower populations, are owned by franchisees. There were briefly two stores in Arizona in the mid 1990s.

On November 11, 2012, Leon&#x27;s announced plans to acquire competing furniture chain The Brick for $700 million.

Leon&#x27;s took over eight Sears Home locations in 2016, a move that allowed Leon&#x27;s to open its first store in the province of BC.

==Products==
Leon&#x27;s Furniture markets mid-range furniture, appliances and electronics; some items are discount, and some stores contain high-end showrooms with higher-priced items available. A major part of Leon&#x27;s marketing strategy is its financing plans, which allow customers to defer payments for various lengths of time (the most common of which are 6 and 18-month terms). This financing is offered through Flexiti Financial.
In an effort to attract customers living in condos or smaller dwellings, Leon&#x27;s launched their Urban Living Collection in June 2007, comprising smaller sized sofas, bedrooms and dining sets.

==Personnel==

The staff of Leon&#x27;s Furniture is separated into numerous departments in many of its corporate locations (franchise operating procedures tend to vary). Employees receive a number of benefits, including profit sharing and other benefits packages for full-time staff.

<text>Thomas Burke (&quot;circa&quot; 1747December 2, 1783) was an Irish physician, lawyer, and statesman who lived in Hillsborough, North Carolina. He represented North Carolina as a delegate to the Continental Congress and was the third governor of the state. Burke was claimed to have been a practising Roman Catholic, which would make him the first of two Governors of North Carolina who were Catholic.

==Biography==
Burke was born in Tiaquin, County Galway, Ireland, around 1747. By 1764, he had emigrated. Thomas went to Virginia and practiced medicine for several years. He studied law and began his practice in Norfolk, Virginia. He became an early supporter of the American Revolution, writing tracts in opposition to the Stamp Act. In 1774, he moved to Hillsborough, North Carolina.

Burke&#x27;s neighbors made him a member of the Fifth North Carolina Provincial Congress that met in Halifax in 1776. He participated in the debate that led to North Carolina&#x27;s new constitution. He was chosen as a delegate to the Second Continental Congress on December 20, 1776, and arrived in Philadelphia to take his seat on February 4, 1777. He was a strong states&#x27; rights advocate, although he moderated this view somewhat by 1781. In September 1777, most of Congress prepared to flee Philadelphia as the British advanced. Burke, instead, went to join General Nash&#x27;s North Carolina troops defending the city. He was present at the Battle of Brandywine before rejoining the Congress.

Burke served in Congress until 1781, when he was chosen to be governor of North Carolina. He returned home to assume that office in June. As governor, he actively supported and encouraged the militia in its resistance to British and Loyalist forces. Then, in September, he was captured by Tories under the command of Col. David Fanning. After a failed rescue attempt by patriot militia under the command of John Butler at the Battle of Lindley&#x27;s Mill, Burke was imprisoned by the British on James Island near Charleston, South Carolina.

Burke was allowed to live freely on the island under parole, but he was subject to mistreatment and deplorable conditions and feared assassination. Finally, on January 16, 1782, he escaped and went to North Carolina. He wrote to the British that he still considered himself under the terms of his parole. He resumed his governor duties before being released from parole through an exchange. Accordingly, many North Carolinians and Continental officers considered that he had broken his word and remained under a cloud of dishonor. In April 1782, he did not stand for re-election to the governorship and was succeeded by Alexander Martin.

Burke&#x27;s health never recovered from his term of imprisonment. He retired to his home, known as Tyaquin, in Orange County. He died there on December 2, 1783, and was buried on his plantation near Hillsborough. The gravesite is about 350 feet north of what is now Governor Burke Road.

Burke was claimed to have been a practicing Roman Catholic who succeeded politically in an era when Catholics held little political power and were often discriminated against.

<text>Titu Liviu Maiorescu (; 15 February 1840 – 18 June 1917) was a Romanian literary critic and politician, founder of the &quot;Junimea&quot; Society. As a literary critic, he was instrumental in the development of Romanian culture in the second half of the 19th century.

A member of the Conservative Party, he was Foreign Minister between 1910 and 1914 and Prime Minister of Romania from 1912 to 1913. He represented Romania at the Peace Conference in Bucharest that ended the Second Balkan War. In politics as in culture he favoured Germany over France. He opposed Romania&#x27;s entry in World War I against Germany, but he nevertheless refused to collaborate with the German army after it had occupied Bucharest.

==Biography==
Titu Liviu Maiorescu was born in Craiova, on 15 February 1840. Maiorescu&#x27;s mother, born Maria Popazu, was the sister of the scholar and bishop of Caransebeș, Ioan Popazu. The family Popazu came from Vălenii de Munte. His father, Ioan Maiorescu, was the son of a Transylvanian peasant from Bucerdea Grânoasă and his name was actually &quot;Trifu&quot;, but he adopted the name &quot;Maiorescu&quot; in order to emphasize his kindship with Petru Maior. Being a theologian by trade (having studied in Blaj, Budapest, Vienna), Ioan Maiorescu proved to be a free thinker. He worked at a teacher in Cernăuți, Craiova, Iași, Bucharest and he remained a bright personality of that epoch of formation for the Romanian modern educational system. Ioan Maiorescu became an inspector for the schools of Oltenia, then he worked as a teacher at the Central School of Craiova. During the Revolution of 1848 he strengthened the link between the Walachian and Transylvanian revolutionaries and he activated as an agent of the Interim Govern, near the German Dieta from Frankfurt. Meanwhile, his family, consisting of his wife, Maria, born Popasu and his two children, Emilia and Titu, travelled to Bucharest, Brașov, Sibiu and Blaj, staying in Brașov for a long while and there, the future critic attended grade fifth at the Romanian gymnasium. Settling in Vienna, Ioan Maiorescu wrote articles in the Austrian newspapers concerning Romanian and Romanians. Returning to Romania after the Union, he became president of the &quot;Obșteasca Epitropie&quot; (The Public Trusteeship), then he worked as director of the Central Commission of the United Principalities, then he worked as a teacher at the Saint Sava National College, as director of Public Instruction Eforie and then as a teacher at the Superior School of Letters in Bucharest.

===Childhood===
Between 1846 and 1848 Titu Maiorescu attended the primary school in Craiova. During the days of the revolution, Ioan Maiorescu was sent on a mission to Frankfurt am Main, while Maria Maiorescu and their children travelled to Bucharest, Brașov and Sibiu. In December 1848, under the leadership of Avram Iancu, Ioan Maiorescu&#x27;s family arrived in Blaj and then in Braşov. Titu Maiorescu continued primary school between 1848 and 1850 at Protodeacon Iosif Barac&#x27;s School.

Between 1850 and 1851, after finishing primary school, Titu Maiorescu was enlisted at the Romanian Gymnasium from Schei-Braşov, a gymnasium founded in 1850 through his uncle Ioan Popazu&#x27;s endeavour. He attended grade fifth at the Romanian gymnasium from Brașov and met Anton Pann, who left him an ineffaceable impression.

===At Theresianum Academy===
In September 1851 the Maiorescu family settled in Vienna, where his father was working within the Ministry of Justice. Later in October Titu Maiorescu attended the first grade at the Academic Gymnasium, which was an addendum of the Theresianum Academy for foreigners. A month later, they equated his results from the gymnasium from Brașov and he passed to the next grade.

While attending the academy in Vienna, Maiorescu a began to write his &quot;Însemnărilor zilnice&quot; (Daily Journal) (which he kept until July 1917, in 42 notebooks that belong today to the fund of manuscripts from the Romanian Academy Library) and he continued to write his journal until the end of his life. His notes are a good source of knowing Maiorescu&#x27;s personality. His success from 1858, when he graduated first in his class at the Theresianum Academy, was a guerdon of all his efforts and strong will.

===University studies===
He was very eager to obtain his university (after only one year of studies in Berlin he obtained his PhD at Giessen, magna cum laude, then after a year, he got his license at the Philology and Philosophy University of Sorbona and one year later, after he studied at the university of Paris, he took his license in law), but his eagerness did not affect his demureness in his studies; the foundations of Maiorescu&#x27;s extremely solid culture were established during that period.

On 3 January 1857, he sent an essay signed with the name Aureliu to the &quot;Transylvania Gazette&quot; in order to publish some of his translations from Jean Paul&#x27;s works. In the following number he intended to publish the translation of a short story written by Jean Paul and entitled &quot;New Year&#x27;s Eve Night&quot;. Although the translation was not published at that date, the letter that Aurel A. Mureşianu edited later in the &quot;Gazette of books&quot;, no 1, in 1934 is still considered the first publishing attempt of T. Maiorescu and it was republished under the same title. In 1858, beside his academic activity, he worked as a teacher of psychology in private boarding schools and as a French teacher in the house of legal counselor Georg Kremnitz.

As a preparatory for French language for the Kremnitz family, Titu Maiorescu taught the four children of the family: Klara (his future wife), Helene, Wilhelm (future Dr. W. Kremnitz, Mite Kremnitz&#x27;s husband, born Marie von Bardeleben) and Hermann. Titu Maiorescu got his PhD in philosophy at Giessen, magna cum laude. The Giessen University considered, in order to allow him to get a PhD, that the last two years at Theresianum were university studies. When he returned to Romania, he published the article &quot;The Measure of Height through a Barometer&quot; in the review &quot;Isis or Nature&quot;.

===PhD===
In December 1860 he got his license in Philology and Philosophy at Sorbonne due to the acknowledgment of his doctorate from Giessen. The following year, he published his Philosophy essay entitled &quot;Philosophical Considerations for Everybody&#x27;s Understanding&quot; () in Berlin, obviously under the influence of Herbart&#x27;s and Feuerbach&#x27;s ideas. On 17 December, after they considered the value of the essay, and after &quot;a verbal defense in front of the academic committee, brilliantly held for original opinions&quot;, the Sorbonne committee granted him the title of &quot;licencé ès lettres&quot; (Philology Licensed). Maiorescu then prepared his doctorate on the thesis: &quot;The Relation. Essay on a new foundation of philosophy&quot; (), until the end of the year 1861, when he left France.

===Career as a university teacher===

In the summer of 1862 he was assigned as a substitute lawyer at the Law Court, then he became an attorney. He married his pupil, Clara Kremnitz. In November/December, he became a teacher at the University of Iași and principal of the Central Gymnasium from the same town.

In 1863 he was assigned to teach a university course of history, on the subject „&quot;About the History of the Roman Republic from the Introduction of Plebeian Tribunes until the Death of Julius Caesar Especially Regarding the Economical and Political Progress&quot;”. From February until September he was the Dean of the Philosophy Faculty of the University of Iași. On 18 September 1863 he was elected as rector of the University of Iaşi for a period of four years. In October he was assigned as principal of the School „Vasile Lupu“ from Iași. He taught pedagogy, Romanian Grammar, Psychology and Composition there. For the first time in Romania, he initiated the Pedagogic Practice for pupils and one of these pupils was Ion Creangă.

In 1863 Titu Maiorescu published in Iași the &quot;Yearbook of the Gymnasium and the Boarding School from Iași for the School Year 1862–1863&quot;; the yearbook was preceded by his thesis: „&quot;Why Should the Latin Language be Studied in Gymnasium as Part of the Foundation of Moral Education?&quot;” On 28 March Titu Maiorescu&#x27;s daughter, Livia, was born. She later married Dymsza; she died in 1946. On 8 October Titu Maiorescu is elected to lead the Institute Vasilian from Iași, which needed to be „fundamentally reorganized“. In order to complete this mission, commissioned by the Minister of Public Directions from back then, Alexandru Odobescu, he traveled on a documentary journey to Berlin and later he returned to Iași on 4 January 1864.

Between 1863 and 1864 Titu Maiorescu taught philosophy at the Philology University of Iași.

===Involvement in social life===
On 10 March 1861, Titu Maiorescu held a lecture (&quot;Die alte französische Tragödie und die Wagnersche Musik&quot; — „The Old French Tragedy and Wagner&#x27;s Music”) in Berlin for the benefit of the monument of Lessing from Kamenz, which he repeated on 12 April in Paris, at the „&quot;Cercle des sociétés savantes&quot;“ (Circle of Academic Societies) and later renewed in the form of a communication, on 27 April in Berlin, at the Philosophy Society.

On 28 November he obtained his Law Licence in Paris, on the thesis &quot;Du régime dotal&quot; (&quot;On Dowery Law&quot;). On 10 December he began his lecture cycle on „&quot;Education Within the Family&quot;”. Afterwards he went back to Romania and settled in Bucharest in December.

When he returned to Romania, at the end of 1861, Titu Maiorescu was eager to contribute to the progress of the recently formed state, after the Union of 1859, of the cultural and political life, of a European level. At that time, when the Union was done and personalities of fresh energies and cultured people were needed, people who were educated in Western Universities, Titu Maiorescu had an early ascent, from his youth, as he was a university professor at 22 years old (in Iași), a dean at 23 and a rector at the same age, then he became an academician (member of the Romanian Academic Society) at 27, a deputy at 30, then a minister at age 34. But this ascent was not always smooth or without hardships, as he was once sued because of all the calumnies that his political opponents promoted and he was suspended from all his functions in 1864, but the verdict of discharge from the following year proved the baselessness of all the accusation against him.

Maiorescu would become a member of the Macedo-Romanian Cultural Society.

===Foundation of the Junimea Society===
The years 1860 were for Maiorescu the period of „popular prelections“ (lectures on various problemes addressed to a quite large audience) and also the period when the foundation of the Junimea Society took place. He founded it alongside his friends I. Negruzzi, Petre P. Carp, V. Pogor and Th.Rosetti. He started his work as a lawyer, then he was elected principal of the &quot;School „Vasile Lupu“&quot; from Iași, and then he founded the a review &quot;Convorbiri Literare&quot; in 1867.
Although the period that followed after the Union of 1859 represented an epoch of completion of the ideals of the generation of 1848, a few accents still had changed, the conditions were different from the romantic youth of Heliade Rădulescu, Alecsandri or Bălcescu. Maiorescu was representing the new generation, the junimist generation, which had a new conception on social and Romanian cultural life. On the political ideology plan, Maiorescu was a retentionist, an advocate of a natural, organic and well prepared evolution and an adversary of the &quot;„forms without root“&quot;, whose indictment he made in his article from 1868, &quot;Against nowadays direction in Romanian culture&quot;, in which he criticized the implementation of certain institutions which were imitated after the Western ones and to which no appropriate root corresponded in the mentalitaty, creation and cultural legacy of the Romanian people.

===Work as a literary critic===

The beginnings of Maiorescu&#x27;s literary critic activity stand apart from the previous generation. Unlike the previous years of the revolution from 1848, when an intense need of original literature determined Heliade Rădulescu to address enthusiastic appeals for Romanian literary works, the seventh decade of the 19th century was marked by a large number of poets and prosemen, who had very limited artistical devices, but high ideals and pretences. It was a time when the selection of true values was needed, on the basis of certain &quot;aesthetic criteria&quot; and Maiorescu agreed to accomplish that task. The adversaries of his ideas depreciatively called his action „a judicial criticism“, because his studies and articles did not analyse in detail the literary work that they had discussed and they contain many apothegms on it. These are based on an ample culture, a determined artistic taste and on impressive intuitions. The mentor of Junimea society considered this type of criticism (neatly affirmative or negative) necessary only to that epoch of clutter of values, as its modalities of execution would gradate later, in the literary life, when the great writers would elevate the artistic level and implicitly would have the public&#x27;s exigency augmented.

This work as a &quot;tutor&quot;, as fighter for the assertion of values, would be led by Maiorescu throughout his entire life and would be divided between his political activity (he would become prime minister, but he will lose a friend from his youth, P.P. Carp), his University activity (as a professor he had and he promoted disciples of great value, like C. Rădulescu-Motru, P.P. Negulescu, Pompiliu Eliade and others), his lawyer activity and his literary critic activity. Maiorescu was seldom reproached for not having spent enough time on writing literary works but his work as a literary critic profoundly marks one of the most lusty epochs in the history of Romanian literature: the period of the great classics. The role of Junimea society and of Maiorescu himself is linked to the creation and the assertion in the public&#x27;s conscience of writers like Eminescu, Creangă, Caragiale, Slavici, Duiliu Zamfirescu and others.

Concerning his conduct, the manner that people reproached Maiorescu for his coldness, his lack of passion, his Olympian attitude, that he seemed to hide a dry soul; for exemplifying this statement, the famous appraisal made by the igneous N. Iorga: &quot;„Nobody was warm or cold beside him“&quot;. The help that Maiorescu gave to the writers from the circle of Junimea and to his disciples and even to his adversary, Dobrogeanu-Gherea, in an important moment of his life, unfolded a man of great and at the same time discreet generosity. The lines that Maiorescu wrote to Eminescu when Eminescu was ill and was worried about the fees for his boarding at the sanatorium from Ober-Döbling prove that Maiorescu was endowed with an admirable gentleness of heart:

&quot;„Do you want to know where the means to pay your fees come from for now? Well, mister Eminescu, are we such strangers to each other? Don&#x27;t you know the love (if you allow me to use this exact word, although it is stronger than other words), the often enthusiastic admiration that I and our entire literary circle feels for you, for your poems, for your whole literary and political work? But it was a real explosion of love that we, all your friends (and only these), contributed to support the few material needs that your situation require. And you would have done the same in using the large or small sum you had when any of your friends would have needed, so we cannot forget a friend of your great value“.&quot;

<doc id="502746" wikidata="Q1330103" url="?curid=502746" title="William Henry Sleeman">
<text>Major-general Sir William Henry Sleeman (8 August 1788 – 10 February 1856) was a British soldier and administrator in British India. He is best known for his work from the 1830s in suppressing the organized criminal gangs known as Thuggee. He also discovered the holotype specimen of the sauropod dinosaur &quot;Titanosaurus indicus&quot; in Jabalpur in 1828. The first outbreak of lathyrism in India in 1844 was reported by him.

==Early life and career==
Sleeman was born in Stratton, Cornwall, the fifth of eight children of Philip Sleeman, a yeoman and supervisor of excise of St Tudy.

In 1809 Sleeman joined the Bengal Army and later served in the Nepal War between 1814 and 1816. He contracted malaria in 1813, symptoms of which occasionally reappeared for the remainder of his life (with sometimes debilitating intensity).

In 1820 he was selected for civil employ, and became junior assistant to the Governor-General&#x27;s agent in the Saugor and Nerbudda territories. In 1822 he was placed in charge of Narsinghpur District, and would later describe his two years in the role as by far the most laborious of his life. He was gazetted to the rank of captain in 1825, and in 1828 assumed charge of Jubbulpore District. In 1831 he transferred to Sagar district to cover for a colleague on leave. Upon his colleague&#x27;s return, Sleeman continued with magisterial duties in Sagar until 1835. He displayed a facility for languages, becoming fluent in Hindi-Urdu and developing a working knowledge of many other languages of the subcontinent. Later in his life, Sleeman was described as &quot;probably the only British officer to address the King of Oudh in correct Urdu and Persian.&quot; His 800-page report on Oudh is still highly regarded as among the most accurate and comprehensive studies of the kingdom during the 1800s.

Sleeman made the first recorded discovery of dinosaur fossils in India in 1828. While serving as a captain in the Narmada valley region, he noticed several basaltic formations which he identified as having been &quot;raised above the waters.&quot; By digging around in the Bara Simla Hills, part of the Lameta formation near Jabalpur, he unearthed several petrified trees, as well as some fragmentary dinosaur fossil specimens. Subsequently, he sent these specimens to London and to the Indian Museum in Calcutta. In 1877 the genus was named &quot;Titanosaurus Indicus&quot; by Richard Lydekker, but the taxonomic position is in doubt.

Sleeman wrote about wild children who had been raised by wolves with his notes on six cases. This was first published in the first volume of his &quot;Journey through the kingdom of Oude in 1848-1850&quot; (1858) and reprinted in 1852 as &quot;An Account of Wolves Nurturing Children in Their Dens, by an Indian Official&quot; and in &quot;The Zoologist&quot; (1888 12 (135): 87–98). This discovery inspired Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s Mowgli character in &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;.

==Thuggee suppression==
Sleeman is best known for his work suppressing the Thuggee secret society. Dating back as early as the 1300s, Thugs were a secret criminal group, partly hereditary in membership, who specialized in the murder by strangulation of travelers as a prelude to theft. Thugs had been known to native rulers and occasionally to Europeans, but the scope of their crimes was not appreciated (later estimated at least in the tens of thousands of victims across India). In 1835, Sleeman captured &quot;Feringhea&quot; (one of the inspirations for the character Syeed Amir Ali in &quot;Confessions of a Thug&quot; is based) and got him to turn King&#x27;s evidence. He took Sleeman to a grave with a hundred bodies, told the circumstances of the killings, and named the Thugs who had done it. After initial investigations confirmed what Feringhea had said, Sleeman started an extensive campaign, being appointed General Superintendent of the operations for the Suppression of Thuggee and in February 1839, he assumed charge of the office of &quot;Commissioner for the Suppression of Thuggee and Dacoity&quot;. During these operations, more than 1400 Thugs were hanged or transported for life. One of them, Bahram, confessed to having strangled 125-931 persons with his turban. Detection was only possible by means of informers, for whose protection from the vengeance of their associates a special prison was established at Jabalpur (at the time &quot;Jubbulpore&quot;). Sleeman had a Government Report made in 1839.
Sleeman wrote three books about the Thugs: &quot;Ramaseeana&quot;, or a &quot;Vocabulary of the peculiar language used by Thugs&quot;; &quot;Report on the Depredations Committed by the Thug Gangs of Upper and Central India&quot;; and &quot;The Thugs or Phansigars of India&quot;. The first of these books offers a detailed vocabulary of words having special meaning to the Thugs, which would be incomprehensible to their victims. These include secret exchanges of greetings that mutually identified one Thug to another. 

In recent decades, historians have begun to revisit the British administration&#x27;s campaign against thuggee, with many arguing that thuggee was an orientalist construction formed with the intention of legitimizing increased British judicial power in India. Upon India&#x27;s independence in 1947, there were 128 tribes, constituting 3,500,000 individuals, officially classified as criminal tribes. Established in Regulation XXVII of 1871, the Criminal Tribes Act (CTA) sought to identify, surveil, and &#x27;rehabilitate&#x27; groups of Indians who, due to their itinerancy, presented a challenge to British authority. As such, tribes deemed &#x27;criminal&#x27; typically included travelling craftsmen, traders, entertainers, and displaced peasants, and measures to combat their itinerancy included forced settlement, roll calls, and travel passes.

Thuggee Act of 1836, which set a legal precedent because it allowed individuals to be convicted based solely on affiliation to a criminal group, with no evidence of having committed a crime.

==British Resident and later life==

Sleeman served as Resident at Gwalior from 1843 to 1849, and at Lucknow from 1849 to 1856. Whilst Resident at Lucknow he survived three assassination attempts. He was also opposed to the annexation of Oudh by Lord Dalhousie, but his advice was disregarded. Sleeman believed that British authorities should annex only regions of India that were plagued by violence, unjust leadership or poor infrastructure and thus maintained that native leadership should be left in place when their rule was even-handed.

Sleeman also took an interest in phrenology and believed that the measurements of the skulls could help him identify criminal ethnic groups.

He died and was buried at sea near Ceylon on a recovery trip to Britain in 1856, just six days after being awarded the Order of the Bath (KCB).

The village Sleemanabad in Madhya Pradesh, India was named in his honour.

==Family==
Whilst in Jubbulpore, he married Amélie Josephine, the daughter of Count Blondin de Fontenne, a French nobleman. They had seven children. His second daughter, Henrietta, was married to William Alexander Ross, an uncle of Sir Ronald Ross. A grandson of Sleeman, Colonel Sir James Lewis Sleeman, who also wrote about thuggee and shikar (big game hunting), became a pioneer of wildlife photography in India.

<text>Bruce McCandless I (August 12, 1911 – January 24, 1968) was an officer of United States Navy who received the Medal of Honor during World War II for his heroism on board during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal on November 13, 1942. He retired with the rank of rear admiral. McCandless was the father of NASA astronaut Captain Bruce McCandless II, USN (Ret). Additionally, Admiral McCandless was the great-grandson of David Colbert McCanles of the Rock Creek Station, Nebraska, shoot-out with Wild Bill Hickok. After that incident, the McCanles family changed their name to McCandless and moved to Florence, Colorado.

==Early life and family==
The son of Rear Admiral (formerly Commodore) Byron McCandless (1881–1967), Bruce McCandless was born on August 12, 1911, in Washington, D.C. Following in his father&#x27;s footsteps, Bruce graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1932. His classmates included Richard Best, Henry Munson, and Lloyd Mustin.

McCandless married Sue Worthington Bradley, daughter of Captain Willis W. Bradley, USN. They had two sons and two daughters, including NASA astronaut Bruce McCandless II.

==Military service==

McCandless served on the cruiser and the destroyer . He was serving as communications officer of the cruiser when the Empire of Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.
On November 13, 1942, during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, Japanese gunfire killed Rear Admiral Daniel J. Callaghan and his staff, including Captain Cassin Young and all other officers on &quot;San Francisco&quot;″s bridge, except Lieutenant Commander McCandless, who took the conn for the rest of the battle. For his conduct, he was awarded the Medal of Honor, and promoted to full commander. &quot;San Francisco&quot; received the Presidential Unit Citation for this battle and, by the end of the war, was credited with 17 battle stars.

Cmdr. McCandless continued to serve on &quot;San Francisco&quot; until 1944, when he took command of the newly commissioned destroyer on July 29 of the same year. On April 8, 1945, during the Battle of Okinawa, &quot;Gregory&quot; was attacked and damaged by four kamikazes and McCandless was awarded the Silver Star for conspicuous gallantry during the battle.

Captain McCandless retired on September 1, 1952, with a terminal promotion to the rank of rear admiral. He died in Washington, D.C., on January 24, 1968, and was buried in the Naval Academy Cemetery in Annapolis, Maryland.

==Awards and honors==

===Medal of Honor citation===

For conspicuous gallantry and exceptionally distinguished service above and beyond the call of duty as communication officer of the U.S.S. San Francisco in combat with enemy Japanese forces in the battle off Savo Island, 12–13 November 1942. In the midst of a violent night engagement, the fire of a determined and desperate enemy seriously wounded Lt. Comdr. McCandless and rendered him unconscious, killed or wounded the admiral in command, his staff, the captain of the ship, the navigator, and all other personnel on the navigating and signal bridges. Faced with the lack of superior command upon his recovery, and displaying superb initiative, he promptly assumed command of the ship and ordered her course and gunfire against an overwhelmingly powerful force. With his superiors in other vessels unaware of the loss of their admiral, and challenged by his great responsibility, Lt. Comdr. McCandless boldly continued to engage the enemy and to lead our column of following vessels to a great victory. Largely through his brilliant seamanship and great courage, the San Francisco was brought back to port, saved to fight again in the service of her country.

===Legacy===
In 1971, the frigate was named in honor of RADM McCandless and his father, Commodore Byron McCandless. There is also a street at the U.S. Naval Academy named after Admiral McCandless, as well as the Colorado State Veterans Nursing Home in Florence, Colorado. Commodore Byron McCandless has a street named after him at the US Naval Base, San Diego, California.

<text>Poissonnière () is a station on Line 7 of the Paris Métro. It is located near the junction between rue La Fayette and rue du Faubourg Poissonnière, after which it is named and along which fishmongers (French: &quot;Poissonnières&quot;) brought fish from Boulogne-sur-Mer and other harbours on the Channel coast to the market at Les Halles in chasse-marées. The route from the coast generally followed that of a Roman Road and entered nineteenth century Paris at the Porte des Poissonniers.

== History ==
Poissonnière was opened on 5 November 1910 with the commissioning of the first section of line 7 between Opéra and Porte de la Villette. As part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; programme by the RATP, the station was renovated and modernised on 9 December 2008.

On 9 October 2019, half of the nameplates on the station&#x27;s platforms were temporarily replaced by the RATP to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Asterix and Obelix comics, along with 11 other stations. Although its name was not changed, the new nameplates were stylised with typography reminiscent of the comic strips by René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo, the creators of the Asterix and Obelix comics. A character from the comics, &quot;Ordralfabétix&quot;, was also added to the nameplates.

In 2019, the station was used by 3,466,034 passengers, making it the 139th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 1,686,977 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 149th busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.

== Passenger services ==
=== Access ===
The station has 3 entrances and features a 1960s-style yellow neon Métro sign.

* Entrance 1: rue La Fayette
* Entrance 2: rue de Chabrol
* Entrance 3: rue du Faubourg-Poissonnière

=== Station layout ===
=== Platforms ===
Poissonnière has a standard configuration with 2 tracks surrounded by 2 side platforms.

<text>Bruce McCandless II (born Byron Willis McCandless; June 8, 1937 – December 21, 2017) was an American Navy officer and aviator, electrical engineer, and NASA astronaut. In 1984, during the first of his two Space Shuttle missions, he completed the first untethered spacewalk by using the Manned Maneuvering Unit.

==Early life and education==
Byron Willis McCandless was born on June 8, 1937, in Boston, Massachusetts. A third-generation U.S. Navy officer, McCandless was the son of Bruce McCandless and grandson of Willis W. Bradley, both Medal of Honor recipients. His mother changed his name on June 6, 1938, to Bruce McCandless II. He graduated from Woodrow Wilson Senior High School, Long Beach, California, in 1954.

In 1958, he received a B.S. from the United States Naval Academy, graduating second, behind future National Security Advisor John Poindexter, in a class of 899 that also included John McCain. During his professional career, he also received an M.S. in electrical engineering from Stanford University in 1965 and an M.B.A. from the University of Houston–Clear Lake in 1987.

==United States Navy==
Following his commissioning, McCandless received flight training from the Naval Air Training Command at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, and Naval Air Station Kingsville, Texas.

In March 1960, he was designated a United States Naval Aviator and proceeded to Naval Air Station Key West for weapons system and carrier landing training in the Douglas F4D-1 Skyray.

Between December 1960 and February 1964, he was assigned to Fighter Squadron 102 (VF-102), flying the Skyray and the McDonnell Douglas F-4B Phantom II. He saw duty aboard and , including the latter&#x27;s participation in the Cuban Missile Crisis.

For three months in early 1964, he was an instrument flight instructor in Attack Squadron 43 (VA-43) at Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia, and then reported to the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps unit at Stanford University for graduate studies in electrical engineering.

During Naval service he gained flying proficiency in the Lockheed T-33B Shooting Star, Northrop T-38A Talon, McDonnell Douglas F-4B Phantom II, Douglas F4D Skyray, Grumman F11F Tiger, Grumman F9F Cougar, Lockheed T-1 Seastar, and Beechcraft T-34B Mentor, and the Bell 47G helicopter.

He logged more than 5,200 hours flying time, including 5,000 hours in jet aircraft.

==NASA career==

At the age of 28, McCandless was selected as the youngest member of NASA Astronaut Group 5 (jokingly labeled the &quot;Original Nineteen&quot; by John W. Young) in April 1966. According to space historian Matthew Hersch, McCandless and Group 5 colleague Don L. Lind were &quot;effectively treated ... as scientist-astronauts&quot; (akin to those selected in the fourth and sixth groups) by NASA due to their substantial scientific experience, an implicit reflection of their lack of the test pilot experience highly valued by Deke Slayton and other NASA managers at the time; this would ultimately delay their progression in the flight rotation.

He served as mission control capsule communicator (CAPCOM) on Apollo 11 during the launch and during the first lunar moonwalk (EVA) by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin before joining the astronaut support crew for the Apollo 14 mission, on which he doubled as a CAPCOM. Thereafter, McCandless was reassigned to the Skylab program, where he received his first crew assignment as backup pilot for the space station&#x27;s first crewed mission alongside backup commander Rusty Schweickart and backup science pilot Story Musgrave. Following this assignment, he again served as a CAPCOM on Skylab 3 and Skylab 4. Notably, McCandless was a co-investigator on the M-509 astronaut maneuvering unit experiment that was flown on Skylab; this eventually led to his collaboration on the development of the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU) used during Space Shuttle EVAs. Although he was classified as a Shuttle pilot until 1983, McCandless ultimately chose to work on the MMU as a mission specialist due to the prestige of the program (which ensured a flight assignment) and his lack of test pilot experience.

He was responsible for crew inputs to the development of hardware and procedures for the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS), Hubble Space Telescope, the Solar Maximum Repair Mission, and the International Space Station program.

McCandless logged over 312 hours in space, including four hours of MMU flight time. He flew as a mission specialist on STS-41-B and STS-31.

===STS-41-B===
&quot;Challenger&quot; launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on February 3, 1984. The flight deployed two communications satellites, and flight-tested rendezvous sensors and computer programs for the first time.

This mission marked the first checkout of the MMU and Manipulator Foot Restraint (MFR). McCandless made the first untethered free flight on each of the two MMUs carried on board, thereby becoming the first person to make an untethered spacewalk. He described the experience:

McCandless&#x27;s first EVA lasted 6 hours and 17 minutes. The second EVA (in which Stewart used the MMU) lasted 5 hours and 55 minutes.
On February 11, 1984, after eight days in orbit, &quot;Challenger&quot; made the first landing on the runway at Kennedy Space Center.

===STS-31===

On this five-day &quot;Discovery&quot; flight, launched on April 24, 1990, from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the crew deployed the Hubble Space Telescope from their record-setting altitude of .

During the deployment of Hubble, one of the observatory&#x27;s solar arrays stopped as it unfurled. While ground controllers searched for a way to command HST to unreel the solar array, Mission Specialists McCandless and Kathryn D. Sullivan began preparing for a contingency spacewalk in the event that the array could not be deployed through ground control. The array eventually came free and unfurled through ground control, while McCandless and Sullivan were pre-breathing inside the partially depressurized airlock.

&quot;Discovery&quot; landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on April 29, 1990.

==After NASA==
After retiring from NASA in 1990, McCandless worked for Lockheed Martin Space Systems.

He was awarded a patent for the design of a tool tethering system that was used during Space Shuttle spacewalks.

==Personal life==

McCandless was married to Bernice Doyle McCandless (1937–2014) for 53 years, and the couple had two children. His recreational interests included electronics, photography, scuba diving, and flying. He also enjoyed cross-country skiing.

In an August 2005 &quot;Smithsonian&quot; magazine article about the MMU photo, McCandless is quoted as saying that the subject&#x27;s anonymity is its best feature. &quot;I have the sun visor down, so you can&#x27;t see my face, and that means it could be anybody in there. It&#x27;s sort of a representation not of Bruce McCandless, but mankind.&quot;

On September 30, 2010, McCandless launched a lawsuit against British singer Dido for unauthorized use of a photo of his 1984 space flight for the album art of her 2008 album &quot;Safe Trip Home&quot;, which showed McCandless &quot;free flying&quot; about 320 feet away from the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot;. The lawsuit, which also named Sony Corp.&#x27;s Sony Music Entertainment and Getty Images as defendants, did not allege copyright infringement but infringement of his persona. The action was settled amicably on January 14, 2011.

McCandless wrote the foreword to the book &quot;Live TV from Orbit&quot; by Dwight Steven-Boniecki.

McCandless died on December 21, 2017, at age 80. He was survived by his second wife, Ellen Shields McCandless, two children and two grandchildren.

McCandless is buried at the United States Naval Academy Cemetery at Annapolis on January 16, 2018.

McCandless&#x27; son, author Bruce McCandless III, wrote about the journey leading to the first untethered spacewalk in the 2021 book &quot;Wonders All Around: The Incredible True Story of Astronaut Bruce McCandless II and the First Untethered Flight in Space.&quot;

==Legacy==
John McCain, who graduated from the United States Naval Academy with McCandless in the Class of 1958, stated after McCandless&#x27; death:

Lockheed Martin later developed the McCandless Lunar Lander and named it after him. This honored him as an esteemed employee of the company, and also the fact that the MMU spacewalk was facilitated by the jetpack developed by Lockheed Martin.

<doc id="502761" wikidata="Q26878" url="?curid=502761" title="Martin P5M Marlin">
<text>The Martin P5M Marlin (P-5 Marlin after 1962), built by the Glenn L. Martin Company of Middle River, Maryland, is a twin piston-engined flying boat that entered service in 1951, and served into the late 1960s with the United States Navy performing naval patrols. It also served with the United States Coast Guard and the French Navy. 285 were produced.

==Development==
Built as a successor to the PBM Mariner, it had better engines, an improved hull, and a single vertical fin tail. The XP5M Marlin prototypes were based on the last PBM-5 Mariners, the company designation being Model 237. The type was heavily improved, again leading to the P5M-2 (Model 237B), which was redesignated SP-5B. A number of P5M-1 models were also used for training, designated TP-5A (after 1962).

==Design==


The Marlin was designed as a gull-winged aircraft to place the engines and propellers high above the spray. Power was provided by two Wright R-3350 radial engines. The rear hull did not lift sharply from the water at the tail, instead rising up steadily, a Martin innovation; this gave the aircraft a longer base of flotation and reduced &quot;porpoising&quot; over waves.

The prototype had nose and tail turrets with twin cannon in each, as well as a dorsal turret with two 0.5 in (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine guns. The cockpit area was the same as the Mariner&#x27;s. It first flew on 30 May 1948.

The first of 167 production P5M-1 aircraft was produced in 1951, flying on 22 June 1951. Changes from the prototype included a raised flight deck for improved visibility, the replacement of the nose turret with a large radome for the AN/APS-44 search radar, the deletion of the dorsal turret, and new, streamlined wing floats. The engine nacelles were lengthened to provide room for weapons bays in the rear.

The P5M-1 was followed by 116 P5M-2 planes. These had a T-tail to put the tail surfaces out of the spray, an AN/ASQ-8 MAD boom at the rear of the tail-tip, no tail guns (the gun position replaced by the antenna for the AN/APN-122 Doppler Navigation Set), better crew accommodation, and an improved bow to reduce spray during takeoff and landing.

==Operational history==

===U.S. Navy===
The last flying boat operations of the United States Navy were Market Time patrols of VP-40. Maritime surveillance patrols began in February 1965 to locate small craft transporting supplies from North Vietnam to Viet Cong units in South Vietnam. VP-40 operated from seaplane tenders and patrolled off the Mekong delta between Phú Quốc and Vung Tau. The last U.S. Navy P5M, redesignated as SP-5B, was flown to NAS Patuxent River, Maryland on 12 July 1968 for interim storage pending construction of display area at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. As a display area at Smithsonian did not materialize, the aircraft was later relocated to the National Naval Aviation Museum at NAS Pensacola, Florida where it is currently on display.

The final Marlin flight was carried out by VP-40, to San Diego Bay on 6 November 1967.

===U.S. Coast Guard===
Seven P5M-1Gs and four P5M-2Gs were built for the United States Coast Guard for air-sea rescue service, but they found the planes difficult to maintain and surplus to requirements. They were subsequently transferred to the U.S. Navy, which redesignated them as TP-5As and used them as training aircraft, since they had no provision for armament.

===French Navy===
The French Navy took delivery of ten former U.S. Navy Marlins between 1957 and 1959 to replace Short Sunderlands in maritime patrol service, based in Dakar, Senegal in West Africa. They were returned in 1964.

==Surviving aircraft==
One SP-5B is located at the National Naval Aviation Museum at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida. This aircraft, BuNo &quot;135533&quot;, is believed to be the last remaining example of the Marlin. It is now displayed inside the new hangar (as of the spring of 2010) and much of the exterior has been restored. The restoration is being financed by the museum and the Mariner/Marlin Association.

<text>Charles Frank Bolden Jr. (born August 19, 1946) is a former Administrator of NASA, a retired United States Marine Corps Major General, and a former astronaut who flew on four Space Shuttle missions.

He graduated from the United States Naval Academy with the class of 1968. Bolden became a Marine aviator and test pilot. After his service as an astronaut, he became Deputy Commandant of Midshipmen at the Naval Academy.

On May 23, 2009, President Barack Obama announced the nomination of Bolden as Administrator of NASA and Lori Garver as deputy NASA administrator. Both were confirmed by the Senate by unanimous consent on July 15, 2009. Bolden was the first African American to head the agency on a permanent basis.

On January 12, 2017, Bolden announced his retirement from NASA during a town hall meeting at NASA Headquarters in Washington D.C. His last day would be January 19, and Robert M. Lightfoot Jr. was announced as acting NASA Administrator.

In 2020, Bolden was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for leadership and development of U.S. human spaceflight and space operations programs, and for revitalizing fundamental aeronautics research.

== Education ==
Bolden graduated from C. A. Johnson High School in Columbia, South Carolina, in 1964. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Science from the United States Naval Academy in 1968, where he was a contemporary of future Marine officers Oliver North, Jim Webb and Michael Hagee and future Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullen, and Admirals Dennis C. Blair, and Jay L. Johnson, and later earned a Master of Science degree in Systems Management from the University of Southern California in 1977. He is a member of Omega Psi Phi fraternity.

== Military career ==
In high school Bolden was turned down for an appointment to the United States Naval Academy by South Carolina&#x27;s Congressional delegation, which included then segregationist Senator Strom Thurmond. Bolden received his appointment after personally writing, as a high school senior, to President Lyndon B. Johnson. A recruiter came to his house a few weeks later, eventually leading to Bolden receiving an appointment from U.S. Representative William L. Dawson from Chicago, Illinois. He later received notes of congratulations from Thurmond at various career milestones.

Bolden was commissioned a second lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps (USMC) following graduation from the United States Naval Academy in 1968. He was president of his class. He underwent flight training at Pensacola, Florida, Meridian, Mississippi, and Kingsville, Texas, before being designated a United States Naval Aviator in May 1970.

He flew more than 100 sorties into North and South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia in the A-6A Intruder while assigned to VMA(AW)-533 at Royal Thai Air Base Nam Phong, Thailand, from June 1972 to June 1973. Upon returning to the United States, Bolden began a two-year tour as a Marine Corps officer selection and recruiting officer in Los Angeles, California, followed by three years in various assignments at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, California.

In June 1979, he graduated from the United States Naval Test Pilot School at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland and was assigned to the Naval Air Test Center&#x27;s Systems Engineering and Strike Aircraft Test Directorates. While there, he served as an ordnance test pilot and flew numerous test projects in the A-6E, EA-6B, and A-7C/E airplanes. He logged more than 6,000 hours flying time.

Bolden was selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in 1980. He was a member of the NASA Astronaut Corps until 1994 when he returned to assignments in the Marine Corps, first as the Deputy Commandant of Midshipmen at the Naval Academy, effective June 27, 1994. In July 1997, he was assigned as the Deputy Commanding General of I Marine Expeditionary Force. From February to June 1998, he served as Commanding General, I MEF (Forward) in support of Operation Desert Thunder in Kuwait. In July 1998, he was promoted to his final rank of major general and assumed his duties as the Deputy Commander, United States Forces Japan. He then served as the Commanding General, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, from August 9, 2000, until August 2002. He retired from the military in August 2004.

== NASA career ==
Selected by NASA in May 1980, Bolden became an astronaut in August 1981. He was one of several astronauts recruited by Nichelle Nichols as part of a NASA effort to increase the number of minority and female astronauts. His technical assignments included: Astronaut Office Safety Officer; Technical Assistant to the Director of Flight Crew Operations; Special Assistant to the Director of the Johnson Space Center; Astronaut Office Liaison to the Safety, Reliability and Quality Assurance Directorates of the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and the Kennedy Space Center (KSC); Chief of the Safety Division at JSC; Lead Astronaut for Vehicle Test and Checkout at the Kennedy Space Center; and Assistant Deputy Administrator, NASA Headquarters.

A veteran of four space flights, he has logged over 680 hours in space. Bolden served as pilot on STS-61-C (January 12–18, 1986) and STS-31 (April 24–29, 1990), and was the mission commander on STS-45 (March 24April 2, 1992), and STS-60 (February 3–11, 1994).

Bolden was the first person to ride the Launch Complex 39 slidewire baskets which enable rapid escape from a Space Shuttle on the launch pad. The need for a human test was determined following a launch abort on STS-41-D where controllers were afraid to order the crew to use the untested escape system.

A few years before his appointment by President Barack Obama to be administrator of NASA, Bolden auditioned, along with professional actors, for the role of virtual host for NASA&#x27;s &quot;Shuttle Launch Experience&quot; educational attraction at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Merritt Island, Florida.

=== Spaceflights ===
On STS-61-C, Bolden piloted . During the six-day flight, crew members deployed the SATCOM Ku-band satellite and conducted experiments in astrophysics and materials processing. The mission launched from Kennedy Space Center on January 12, 1986, orbited the Earth 96 times, and ended with a successful night landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California on January 18, 1986. Coincidently, Senator Bill Nelson, who like Bolden would also go on to serve as a NASA Administrator, also flew on STS-61-C as a payload specialist. STS-61-C was the final mission before the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster.

Bolden piloted during STS-31. Launched on April 24, 1990, from Kennedy Space Center, the crew spent the five-day mission deploying the Hubble Space Telescope and conducting a variety of mid-deck experiments. They also used a variety of cameras, including both the IMAX in cabin and cargo bay cameras, for Earth observations from their record-setting altitude of over 400 miles. Following 75 orbits of Earth in 121 hours, &quot;Discovery&quot; landed at Edwards Air Force Base on April 29, 1990.

On STS-45, Bolden commanded a crew of seven aboard , launched on March 24, 1992, from Kennedy Space Center. STS-45 was the first Spacelab mission dedicated to NASA&#x27;s &quot;Mission to Planet Earth&quot;. During the nine-day mission, the crew operated the twelve experiments that constituted the ATLAS-1 (Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science) cargo. ATLAS-1 obtained detailed measurements of atmospheric chemical and physical properties. In addition, this was the first time an artificial beam of electrons was used to stimulate an auroral discharge. Following 143 orbits of Earth, &quot;Atlantis&quot; landed at Kennedy Space Center on April 2, 1992.

Bolden commanded STS-60&#x27;s crew of six aboard &quot;Discovery&quot;. This was the historic first joint-American–Russian Space Shuttle mission involving the participation of a Russian cosmonaut, Sergei Krikalev, as a mission specialist. The flight launched on February 3, 1994, from Kennedy Space Center, and carried the Space Habitation Module-2 (SPACEHAB-2), and the Wake Shield Facility. The crew conducted a series of joint American/Russian science activities. The mission achieved 130 orbits of the Earth, ending with a landing on February 11, 1994, at the Kennedy Space Center.

=== Administrator of NASA ===
In 2009, President Obama appointed Bolden to be administrator of NASA.

In a NASA video published April 28, 2010, titled &quot;NASA&#x27;s New Era of Innovation and Discovery&quot;, Bolden said, &quot;We&#x27;re going to turn science fiction into science fact&quot;.

On the same day, at a question and answer session with employees at the Johnson Space Center, Bolden compared the Constellation Program to a stillborn baby calf extracted from a camel&#x27;s womb by U.S. Marines. Bolden said, &quot;We&#x27;ve got some stillborn calves around, and we have got to figure out ways to help each other bring them back to life&quot;.

In a June 2010 interview with &quot;Al Jazeera&quot;, Bolden said that the top three goals he was tasked with by President Obama were to help re-inspire children to want to get into science and math, to expand NASA&#x27;s international relationships, and, &quot;perhaps foremost&quot;, &quot;to reach out to the Muslim world ... to help them feel good about their historic contribution to science... and math and engineering&quot;. The White House disagreed with Bolden&#x27;s statement, with the press secretary saying Bolden probably misspoke and &quot;That was not his task, and that&#x27;s not the task of NASA&quot;.

Bolden said his agency&#x27;s long-term ambition is landing astronauts on Mars. He has cited spending cuts as a concern for major NASA projects.

On August 28, 2012, he was the first human being to have his voice broadcast on the surface of Mars. Although the rover has no speakers, it received the transmission of his voice and then beamed it back to Earth.

In 2013, he noted the National Aerospace Week as Administrator of NASA.

On October 28, 2015, Bolden presented the next steps for a human journey to Mars at the Center for American Progress in Washington, D.C.

On January 12, 2017, Bolden announced his resignation from NASA during a Town Hall meeting at NASA Headquarters in Washington D.C. His last day would be January 19, and Robert M. Lightfoot Jr. was announced as acting NASA Administrator.

After leaving NASA, Bolden has served on the United Arab Emirates Space Advisory Committee.

== Personal life ==
Bolden lives in Alexandria, Virginia, and is married to Alexis (née Walker); the couple have two children. Bolden is a Christian, stating in a question and answer session in May 2010:
In the 2024 United States presidential election, Bolden endorsed Kamala Harris.

<text>Baron Kilmarnock, of Kilmarnock in the County of Ayr, Scotland, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1831 for William Hay, 18th Earl of Erroll. This was a revival of the Kilmarnock title held by his great-grandfather William Boyd, 4th Earl of Kilmarnock, who was attainted in 1746 (with his titles forfeited). The barony of Kilmarnock remained a subsidiary title of the earldom of Erroll until the death in 1941 of the eighteenth Earl&#x27;s great-great-grandson, the twenty-second Earl. The earldom, which could be passed on through female lines, was inherited by the late Earl&#x27;s daughter and only child, the twenty-third Countess. The barony of Kilmarnock, which could only be passed on to male heirs, was inherited by the Earl&#x27;s younger brother, the sixth Baron. He assumed the surname of Boyd in lieu of Hay the same year he succeeded to the title. the title is held by his younger son, the eighth Baron, who succeeded his elder brother in 2009.

The current Barons Kilmarnock are the hereditary Clan Chiefs of Clan Boyd.

<text>The University of Baltimore (UBalt, UB) is a public university in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. It is part of the University System of Maryland. UBalt consists of four colleges in applied arts and sciences, business, law, and public affairs. The University of Baltimore School of Law is one of Maryland&#x27;s two law schools.

==History==

===Early history===
 Founded by a group of Baltimore business professionals, UBalt originally sought to provide educational opportunities for working men and women, meaning that the first classes were held not above the ornate dragons of the current liberal arts and policy building, but in a four-story rowhouse on St. Paul St. in 1925.

In 1937, after the addition of day programs to augment the initial night courses, a full-scale junior college was added to the university&#x27;s offerings. Other changes in the following decades included the construction of the Langsdale Library in 1966, according to an administrative history of the school. In the 1970s, UBalt merged with Eastern College, Mount Vernon School of Law, and Baltimore College of Commerce.

During the presidency of Thomas Granville Pullen, the university became regionally accredited in 1971 with the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools and built the Langsdale Library. For a three-decade period that started in 1975 and would eventually end in 2007, UBalt became an &quot;upper division academic institution,&quot; offering only third and fourth year undergraduate and post-graduate course work. Also in 1975, ownership was assumed by the state of Maryland.

In 1988, the state merged UBalt into the new statewide university system, the University of Maryland System, which was later renamed University System of Maryland.

=== Lower Division Initiative and later developments ===
The &quot;Lower Division Initiative&quot; was a program that began in 2005 to extend the University of Baltimore&#x27;s position to once again offer the first two years of the baccalaureate degree. In April 2005, the University System of Maryland&#x27;s board of regents approved plans that would allow UBalt to start accepting freshmen and sophomores. Under the original plan, freshmen and sophomore were to be admitted starting in the fall of 2006.

In a unanimous vote on February 15, 2006, the Maryland Higher Education Commission approved a revised mission statement submitted by the University of Baltimore, thus enabling the university to return to four-year undergraduate status. This was the same initiative that had received approval from the board of regents in 2005; however, the plan was revised slightly, calling for freshmen to be admitted in the fall of 2007.

The university stated that the new program better reflected the current focus and was designed to prepare students in business, pre-law, technology, public affairs, and applied liberal arts. It also said that it would offer freshmen &quot;free&quot; tuition for their first year, a benefit made possible by an anonymous private donor. An estimate stated that 140 freshmen were expected in the incoming class of fall of 2007.

Near the time of the change, the university also changed the school colors and adopted the new slogan, &quot;Knowledge That Works&quot;.

Since beginning to accept freshmen again, UBalt has built a new, 12-story building for the university&#x27;s law school along with the construction of additional residential capacity on campus. In May 2014, it was announced that Kurt L. Schmoke would become the university&#x27;s eighth president, succeeding retired president Robert Bogomolny.

As of 2022, the renovation of Langsdale Library, which was renamed to Robert L. Bogomolny Library, was complete. The renovation was designed by the German architectural firm Behnisch Architekten, which had also been responsible for the design of the 2013 law school structure at Charles St. and Mount Royal Ave.

Starting in 2005, the university&#x27;s MBA program has been the target of nearby institutions&#x27; criticism regarding a supposed diversion of funds, with UB&#x27;s status as a traditionally white institution bringing calls for a restructuring of state funding. As of early 2022, that criticism was ongoing.

==Academics==
The university offers numerous undergraduate, graduate, and professional as well as several certificate and joint degree programs. It offers 19 Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degree programs, spanning the arts and sciences, public affairs, and business.

At the master&#x27;s level, UBalt offers a Master of Public Administration (MPA), a Master of Business Administration (previously offered jointly with Towson University), and 13 Master of Science and 3 Master of Art degrees. The MPA program was the first in the state to be fully accredited by the National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration (NASPAA); it was also ranked #72 nationally in U.S. News &amp; World Report&#x27;s 2023-24 edition of &quot;Best Grad Schools.&quot; Additionally, the university offers two Master of Fine Arts degrees. The Practitioner Specialization of the M.S. in Counseling Psychology program is accredited by the Masters in Psychology and Counseling Accreditation Council, and both the undergraduate and graduate programs in Criminal Justice are certified by the Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences. The university&#x27;s Masters degree in Applied Psychology, Counseling Psychology concentration, is accredited by the Masters in Psychology and Counseling Accreditation Council (MPCAC). The law school offers a Master of Laws degree.

At the doctoral level, UBalt offers a program leading to a research-based Doctor of Science degree in Information and Interaction Design. UBalt also offers a Doctor of Public Administration. Through its law school, UBalt offers the Juris Doctor.

===Colleges and schools===
The university is composed of multiple colleges and schools:
*Merrick School of Business
*School of Law
*Yale Gordon College of Arts and Sciences
*College of Public Affairs

==Campus and student services==

The main campus is located in Baltimore&#x27;s Mt. Vernon cultural district, close to downtown and the Inner Harbor. The Lyric Opera House, Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall, and the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA) are nearby. For the most part, the main academic buildings surround the intersections of Mount Royal Avenue and North Charles Street. Gordon Plaza is at the center of campus.

===University buildings===
The buildings include:
*H. Mebane Turner Learning Commons
*The Academic Center
*The Charles Royal Building
*John and Frances Angelos Law Center
*Robert L. Bogomolny Library
*UBalt Student Center
*William H. Thumel Sr. Business Center
*The Liberal Arts and Policy Building

===Student housing developments===
The university, the Bozzuto Group, and the Gould Property Co. entered into a public-private joint venture to develop UBalt&#x27;s Bolton Yard parking lot into a mixed use development, including apartments, a UBalt student bookstore, other retail, and garage parking. The project, which is named the Fitzgerald at UB Midtown, broke ground in 2008 and was largely complete by 2011.

The Fitzgerald project was viewed at the time of its inception as a prelude to future public-private development projects—for instance more student housing. To that end, an October 2010 announcement indicated that the university was planning an 11-story student housing tower, to again be built in partnership with a private company, according to The Baltimore Sun. The student housing tower was largely complete by mid-2012.

According to a 2014 &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; article, the university was considering building additional dormitory space on West Oliver Street, at the site of a facility currently used for postal vehicle maintenance. That development has yet to be named. According to a 2023 &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; article, the university intends to enter into a ground-lease arrangement with the development firm Zahlco for the eventual creation of apartments and ground-floor retail on the former postal site.

===Police and public safety===
The University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) and University of Baltimore (UBalt) began a public safety collaboration in the first quarter of 2022. All police officers on the UBalt campus are employed by the UMB Police Department (UMBPD). The UMBPD is a fully certified law enforcement agency through the Maryland Police and Correctional Training Commissions (MPCTC).

UBalt maintains responsibility for campus security performed by unarmed, civilian security personnel known as the UBalt Safety and Security team. Uniformed officers from UMB — sworn, armed, and professionally trained and certified — are assigned to patrol the UBalt campus. At the same time, UBalt&#x27;s Safety and Security staff provides building access and control, including office lockouts, welcome desk staffing, interior/exterior patrols, and more.

===Local transit===

Penn Station, with connections to Amtrak and MARC service, and a Light Rail stop, are just to the north of campus. The University of Baltimore/Mt. Royal station on the Baltimore Light Rail system is on the northwest edge of campus. The State Center station on the Baltimore Metro system is just a few blocks from campus. UBalt runs shuttle bus service between its academic buildings, parking garages, and the nearby public transportation/local transit stops.

===Satellite campuses===
In conjunction with the University System of Maryland, UBalt offers courses and several undergraduate and graduate degree programs at the Universities at Shady Grove in Rockville, Maryland. Through a partnership with the College of Southern Maryland, UBalt offers the upper-level undergraduate coursework leading toward the bachelor&#x27;s degree in business in Southern Maryland. UBalt also offers online classes.

==Student life==
UBalt has numerous academic clubs, student organizations, and an active student government; as of May 2017, more than 90 were listed on the university&#x27;s website. The academic clubs usually sponsor a host of programs and speakers throughout the school year. Not all clubs are academic or sports-related, however: Clubs related to improv, crafting, religions, languages, and film are among the non-academic, non-sports options. The &quot;UB Post &quot; is the monthly student newspaper, which serves the purpose of keeping the general student population informed of upcoming campus activities, as well as relevant news. Run by students, it is available in print and online, and has been published since 1933. Leonard Robinson is the editor-in-chief. A student-run press, Plork, provides additional printing experience for students majoring in fields related to media design, publishing, and writing, as does the university&#x27;s 50-year-old literary magazine, &quot;Welter&quot;. The Student Center is the central place for students—housing The Hive market and cafe, the UB Campus Pantry, the Interfaith Space, student government and organization offices, and study lounges.

The University of Baltimore has not offered any varsity sports since 1983.

===Student housing===
In the years 2012–2017, the number of UBalt students living near campus increased 134 percent. Students have the option to reside in The Varsity, located on West Biddle Street 0.2 miles from the campus, or in other private complexes nearby.

===Campus recreation and wellness===
UBalt has an athletic/fitness center named Campus Recreation and Wellness, which is continually growing for the betterment of the university and surrounding community. It has an aerobics studio, a sparring/boxing room, two indoor racquetball courts, a well-equipped gym, a basketball court, and locker rooms. The Recreation Center, located on the third and fourth floor of the Academic Center, offers fitness classes free of charge on a first-come, first-served basis to all members and hosts the Sport Club and Intramural Sports teams. At one time, UBalt owned and operated a golf driving range in the Mount Washington neighborhood of Baltimore. However, this facility has been leased to the city. Campus Recreation and Wellness seeks to serve the recreation, fitness, health, and leisure needs of the university community through instructional and competitive sport activities, including aerobics classes, golf lessons, intramural sports, informal recreation, and sport clubs. The Recreation Center facilities include basketball, racquetball, badminton and volleyball courts, weight and cardio rooms, aerobic and spinning studios, indoor golf cage, foosball, darts, Wii gaming system, as well as locker rooms and a sauna. The facilities are open to students, faculty, staff and Recreation Center members with valid UBalt BeeCards.

The UBalt men&#x27;s lacrosse team won four USILA Division II national championships in four consecutive years, 1956–1959.

===Honor societies===
The university hosts chapters of several honor societies, including:
*Alpha Chi
*Alpha Phi Sigma
*Beta Alpha Psi
*Beta Gamma Sigma
*Mu Kappa Tau
*Phi Alpha Theta
*Phi Theta Kappa
*Pi Alpha Alpha
*Pi Sigma Alpha

<text>Colonel Philip Meadows Taylor (25 September 1808 – 13 May 1876), an administrator in British India and a novelist, made notable contributions to public knowledge of South India. Though largely self-taught, he was a polymath, working alternately as a judge, engineer, artist, and man of letters.

==Life and writings==
Taylor was born in Liverpool, England, where his father, Philip Meadows Taylor, was a merchant. His mother was Jane Honoria Alicia, daughter of Bertram Mitford of Mitford Castle, Northumberland.

At the age of 15, Taylor was sent out to India to become a clerk to a Bombay merchant, Mr Baxter. However, Baxter was in financial difficulties, and in 1824 Taylor gladly accepted a commission in the service of the Nizam of Hyderabad, with which he remained dutifully attached throughout his long career. He was speedily transferred from military duty to a civil appointment, and in this capacity acquired a proficient knowledge of the languages and the people of southern India.

Meanwhile, Taylor studied the laws, geology and the antiquities of the country and became an early expert on megaliths. See more at South Asian Stone Age. He was alternately judge, engineer, artist, and a man of letters.

While on furlough in England in 1840, he published the first of his Indian novels, &quot;Confessions of a Thug&quot;, in which he reproduced the scenes which he had heard about the Thuggee cult, described by the chief actors in them. This book was followed by a series of tales, &quot;Tippoo Sultaun&quot; (1840), &quot;Tara&quot; (1863), &quot;Ralph Darnell&quot; (1865), &quot;Seeta&quot; (1872), and &quot;A Noble Queen&quot; (1878), all illustrating periods in Indian history and society and giving prominence to the native character, institutions and traditions, for which he had great regard. &quot;Seeta&quot; in particular was remarkable for a sympathetic, romantic portrayal of the marriage between a British civil servant and a Hindu widow just before the Indian Mutiny. Taylor himself is thought to have married in about 1830, although his autobiography states 1840, to Mary Palmer, daughter of William Palmer (1780-1867) who was the son of General William Palmer (1740-1816) and his second wife Bibi Faiz Bakhsh ‘Faiz-un-Nisa’ Begum (died 1828) . Returning to India he acted, from 1840 to 1853 as a correspondent for &quot;The Times&quot; and wrote a &quot;Student&#x27;s Manual of the History of India&quot; (1870).

About 1850, Meadows Taylor was appointed by the Nizam&#x27;s government to administer, during a long minority, the principality of the young Raja Venkatappa Nayaka. He succeeded without European assistance in raising this small territory to a high degree of prosperity. Such was his influence with the natives that during the Indian Mutiny in 1857, he held his ground without military support.

Colonel Taylor, whose merits were recognized and acknowledged by then by the British government of India – although he had never been in the service of the Company – was subsequently appointed Deputy Commissioner of the western &quot;Ceded Districts&quot;. He succeeded in establishing a new assessment of revenues that was more equitable to cultivators and more productive to the government. By perseverance he had risen from the condition of a half-educated youth without patronage, and without even the support of the Company, to the successful government of some of the most important provinces of India, in extent with a population of over five million.

He received an Order of the Star of India on his retirement from service in 1860 and was given a pension. In 1875 his sight failed, and on medical advice, he decided to spend the winter in India but contracted jungle fever. He died in Menton, France, on his way home, on 13 May 1876.

==Contributions to Gulburga==

Taylor made several contributions to the Gulburga region in India by initiating a number of reforms. He encouraged the improvement of agriculture, opened up job opportunities, started schools and improved infrastructure. He was known to spend his own money on providing drought relief. The local people began calling him &quot;Mahadev Baba&quot;. Taylor undertook notable archaeological excavations in Gulburga, publishing his findings in the &quot;Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy&quot; and the &quot;Journal of The Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society&quot;.

==Tributes==
Richard Garnett commented, &quot;His &quot;Confessions of a Thug&quot; is a classic adventure novel, which inspired the young of several imperial generations and was much imitated by other colonial fiction writers for over a century.&quot;

Rich tributes were paid to Taylor, by the Archaeological Survey of India in its &quot;History of Indian Archaeology 1784–1947&quot; by Sourindranath Roy. Taylor&#x27;s archaeological work is acknowledged there as highly significant.

<doc id="502785" wikidata="Q1232814" url="?curid=502785" title="Phthia">
<text>In Greek mythology Phthia (; or Φθίη &quot;Phthía, Phthíē&quot;) was a city or district in ancient Thessaly. It is frequently mentioned in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; as the home of the Myrmidons, the contingent led by Achilles in the Trojan War. It was founded by Aeacus, grandfather of Achilles, and was the home of Achilles&#x27; father Peleus, mother Thetis (a sea nymph), and son Neoptolemus (who reigned as king after the Trojan War).

Phthia is referenced in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Crito&quot;, where Socrates, in jail and awaiting his execution, relates a dream he has had (43d–44b): &quot;I thought that a beautiful and comely woman dressed in white approached me. She called me and said: &#x27;Socrates, may you arrive at fertile Phthia on the third day. The reference is to Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; (ix.363), when Achilles, upset at having his war-prize, Briseis, taken by Agamemnon, rejects Agamemnon&#x27;s conciliatory presents and threatens to set sail in the morning; he says that with good weather he might arrive on the third day &quot;in fertile Phthia&quot;—his home. 

Phthia is the setting of Euripides&#x27; play &quot;Andromache&quot;, a play set after the Trojan War, when Achilles&#x27; son Neoptolemus (in some translations named Pyrrhus) has taken Andromache, the widow of the Trojan hero Hector as a slave.

Mackie (2002) notes the linguistic association of Phthia with the Greek word &quot;phthisis&quot; &quot;consumption, decline; wasting away&quot; (in English, &quot;phthisis&quot; has been used as a synonym for tuberculosis) and the connection of the place name with a withering death. This suggests the possibility of a wordplay in Homer, associating Achilles&#x27; home with such a withering death.

==Location of Phthia==
The Homeric Catalogue of Ships speaks of Achilles&#x27; kingdom as follows (Hom. Il. 2.680-5):

&lt;poem&gt;Now again all those who dwelt in Pelasgic Argos:
those who dwelt in Alos and Alope and Trachis
and those who held Phthia and Hellas with its fair women,
and who were called Myrmidons and Hellenes and Achaians;
of those fifty ships the leader was Achilles.&lt;/poem&gt;

These names are generally believed to have referred to places in the Spercheios valley in what is now Phthiotis in central Greece. The river Spercheios was associated with Achilles, and at &quot;Iliad&quot; 23.144 Achilles states that his father Peleus had vowed that Achilles would dedicate a lock of his hair to the river when he returned home safely.

However, a number of ancient sources, such as Euripides&#x27; &quot;Andromache&quot;, also located Phthia further north in the area of Pharsalus. Strabo also notes that near the cities of Palaepharsalus and Pharsalus there was a shrine dedicated to Achilles&#x27; mother Thetis, the Thetideion. Mycenean remains have been found in Pharsalus, and also in other sites nearby, but according to Denys Page, whether the Homeric Phthia is to be identified with Pharsalus &quot;remains as doubtful as ever&quot;.

It has been suggested that &quot;Pelasgic Argos&quot; is a general name for the whole of northern Greece, and that line 2.681 of the &quot;Iliad&quot; is meant to serve as a general introduction to the remaining nine contingents of the Catalogue.

<text>Joule is a capability-secure massively-concurrent dataflow programming language, designed for building distributed applications. It is so concurrent that the order of statements within a block is irrelevant to the operation of the block. Statements are executed whenever possible, based on their inputs. Everything in Joule happens by sending messages. There is no control flow. Instead, the programmer describes the flow of data, making it a dataflow programming language.

Joule development started in 1994 at &quot;Agorics&quot; in Palo Alto, California. It is considered the precursor to the E programming language.

== Language syntax ==

Numerals consist of ASCII digits 0–9; identifiers are Unicode sequences of digits, letters, and operator characters that begin with a letter. It is also possible to form identifiers by using Unicode sequences (including whitespace) enclosed by either straight (&#x27; &#x27;) or standard (‘ ’) single quotes, where the backslash is the escape character. Keywords have to start with a letter, except the &quot;•&quot; keyword to send information. Operators consist of Unicode sequences of digits, letters, and operator characters, beginning with an operator character. Labels are identifiers followed by a colon (&#x27;:&#x27;).

At the root, Joule is an imperative language and because of that a statement-based language. It has a rich expression syntax, which transforms easily to its relational syntax underneath. Complex expressions become separate statements, where the site of the original expression is replaced by a reference to the acceptor of the results channel. Therefore, nested expressions still compute completely concurrently with their embedding statement.

 If amount &lt;= balance
 • account withdraw: amount
 else
 • account report-bounce:
 end

An identifiers may name a channel to communicate with the server. If this is the case, it is said to be &quot;bound&quot; to that channel.

<doc id="502791" wikidata="Q757508" url="?curid=502791" title="Atmosphere (music group)">
<text>Atmosphere is an American hip-hop duo from Minneapolis, Minnesota, consisting of rapper Slug (Sean Daley) and DJ/producer Ant (Anthony Davis). Since its formation in 1996, the group has released thirteen studio albums and ten extended plays.

==Members==
The duo is composed of rapper Slug (Sean Daley) and DJ/producer Ant (Anthony Davis). With the exception of a few tracks on the album &quot;Lucy Ford&quot;, Ant has produced every Atmosphere record. A former member and co-founder Spawn (Derek Turner) left the group after the release of the group&#x27;s first album &quot;Overcast!&quot;. Mr. Dibbs, a DJ associated with the group, toured with Atmosphere before their &quot;You Can&#x27;t Imagine How Much Fun We&#x27;re Having&quot; tour, at which point Ant began touring.

==History==

===Before &quot;Overcast!&quot;===
Sean Daley and Derek Turner met while attending Washburn High School. The pair took the names Slug and D-Spawn, respectively, as rapper names. They initially performed under the name &quot;Mental Subjects&quot;, before changing the name to &quot;A Rhythmic Culture&quot;, and finally settling on &quot;Urban Atmosphere&quot;. Originally, Spawn performed as the rapper, with Slug acting as DJ. Eventually Spawn convinced Slug to start rapping as well. Through the rapper Musab (then known as Beyond), Slug was introduced to the producer Ant after they went to his house to record a track. Slug saw an opportunity to work with Ant and convinced Spawn to record further with him. They soon started recording songs with Ant, learning how to structure songs properly and practicing vocal delivery. Eventually the group dropped the &quot;Urban&quot; from their name.

Atmosphere, as a group, joined with other rappers Musab, Phull Surkle, Black Hole, and The Abstract Pack to form a collective known as Headshots. This group later evolved into the record label Rhymesayers. Over time, a series of cassettes was released under the Headshots name which earned some local acclaim. By 1996, Slug, Stress and Musab were making national appearances such as on NPR&#x27;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot;. The start of Rhymesayers as a record label came when Siddiq, got fed up with their treatment at a number of local studios, decided to buy his own.

===&quot;Overcast!&quot; (1997)===
Spawn left the group three years after their first album, &quot;Overcast!&quot;, was released. &quot;Overcast!&quot; introduced Atmosphere to a wider audience, largely thanks to the airplay that the single &quot;Scapegoat&quot; received on college radio stations. Meanwhile, Slug improved his live performance skills at Minneapolis clubs such as The Front (Freeloaded), First Avenue and 7th Street Entry. In 1998, two albums recorded by underground rap supergroups involved Atmosphere. &quot;The Dynospectrum&quot; involved Atmosphere as well as Beyond (Musab), Swift (of Phull Surkle) and I Self Divine. &quot;Deep Puddle Dynamics&quot; released by the Oakland, California, based underground rap label Anticon, included Slug, Sole, Alias and Doseone rapping over beats by Jel.

===&quot;Headshots Se7en&quot; (1999)===
In 1998, Slug and Ant began to record the group&#x27;s 2nd full-length album, &quot;Headshots Se7en.&quot; At the time it was only released on cassette, and didn&#x27;t see a full CD re-issue until 2005. However, it is still one of the group&#x27;s most critically acclaimed albums.

=== &quot;Ford and Lucy Ford&quot; (2000–2001) ===
Now touring nationally on a more regular basis (the twenty-one date Ford One Tour brought them to the East Coast for the first time), Slug was able to leave his job at a record store, as well as a second job working overnight shifts at a department store. In 1999, the Rhymesayers-owned record store, The Fifth Element, was opened in Minneapolis. In 2001, the two EPs, &quot;Ford&quot; and &quot;Lucy&quot;, were combined and released as an LP titled &quot;Lucy Ford: The Atmosphere EPs&quot;. Originally intended as a tour-only release, it sold so well that it was later released as an official LP, making it the only Atmosphere album with producers other than Ant. In 2001, Atmosphere made three separate tours across North America and Europe. With &quot;Lucy Ford&quot;, Atmosphere also finally achieved national distribution through the independent distributor Fat Beats.

===&quot;God Loves Ugly&quot; (2002)===
Atmosphere planned to release their second studio album &quot;God Loves Ugly&quot; on June 11, 2002, but experienced delays in editing. The record had more straightforward, almost battle-centric, lyrics from Slug. It was distributed nationally, again through Fat Beats, and sold over 130,000 copies. The album generated two singles: &quot;Modern Man&#x27;s Hustle&quot; and &quot;GodLovesUgly&quot;. Atmosphere toured extensively in support of this record, going as far as Europe and Japan, playing sixty shows in seventy-one days. After the tour, Daley spent his holidays in the Australian outback. The success of the album and subsequent tours came to the attention of the major labels Interscope, Sony and Warner Brothers. Despite these overtures, Atmosphere decided to stay independent.

===&quot;Seven&#x27;s Travels&quot; (2003)===

Atmosphere&#x27;s third full-length studio album, &quot;Seven&#x27;s Travels&quot;, was released on September 23, 2003, through Rhymesayers and the punk label Epitaph. It contained two singles, &quot;Trying To Find A Balance&quot; and &quot;National Disgrace&quot;, both of which had music videos that received airplay on MTV2 and other stations, attracting more attention and success for Atmosphere than previous releases. The album included a guest appearance from label mate Brother Ali and was entirely produced by Ant. Several songs on &quot;Seven&#x27;s Travels&quot; contain lyrics pertaining to relationship problems, alcohol and depression. The single, &quot;Trying To Find A Balance&quot;, was used on the video game &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground 2&quot;.

The album cover for &quot;Seven&#x27;s Travels&quot; was interpreted by some as an homage to &quot;The Beatles&quot; (1968). However, that was not the case; the original planned cover depicted a nude woman lying in a field.

===&quot;You Can&#x27;t Imagine How Much Fun We&#x27;re Having&quot; (2005)===
Released in 2005, Atmosphere&#x27;s fourth album &quot;You Can&#x27;t Imagine How Much Fun We&#x27;re Having&quot; was a departure from the sound of the previous two albums. Though production was once again entirely by Ant, the sound and lyrical content of the album had a more &quot;raw&quot; style than &quot;Godlovesugly&quot; and &quot;Seven&#x27;s Travels&quot;. Reviews were generally positive, with Stylust saying &quot;The result may be, in a manner of speaking, the most consistent Atmosphere album to date.&quot; The opening track &quot;The Arrival&quot; appeared on EA Sports&#x27; &quot;Fight Night Round 3&quot;.

=== The &quot;Seasons&quot; EPs and &quot;Strictly Leakage&quot; (2007–2008) ===
While completing the LP &quot;When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold&quot;, Atmosphere released four EPs as continuations of the &quot;Sad Clown Bad Dub&quot; series. These were &quot;Sad Clown Bad Summer 9&quot;, &quot;Sad Clown Bad Fall 10&quot;, &quot;Sad Clown Bad Winter 11&quot; and &quot;Sad Clown Bad Spring 12&quot;. The EPs were popular in the Minneapolis area due to many references to local places, such as songs named after streets in the area (&quot;66th street&quot;, &quot;Lyndale Avenue&quot;). The song &quot;Sunshine&quot;, from the &quot;Bad Summer&quot; EP, was released as a single. Despite not having a music video or any promotion, the song became popular among the band&#x27;s core fan base, eventually becoming a staple in live shows. Later, in 2015, the group released a music video through Rhymesayers Entertainment.

After the EPs, the group also released the free album &quot;Strictly Leakage&quot; in late 2007.

===&quot;When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold&quot; (2008)===
This album garnered much acclaim from local as well as international fans. Likely Atmosphere&#x27;s most commonly known album of the 21st century, it has gained wide attention from a vast audience, featuring Slug&#x27;s story-telling-rap style songs such as &quot;Yesterday&quot;, a song symbolizing Slug&#x27;s relationship with his father, and &quot;The Waitress&quot;, which is interpreted differently throughout his fan-base.
During the recording process of When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold, Slug was invited by Rick Rubin to Rubin&#x27;s house to work through early demos of the album&#x27;s tracks. No advance copies of the album were ever released online in attempts to build anticipation for the album&#x27;s release.

===&quot;Leak at Will&quot; (2009)===
Between the release of &quot;When Life Gives You Lemons&quot; and &quot;To All My Friends&quot;, Atmosphere released another free EP in 2009 called &quot;Leak at Will&quot;, with seven original tracks. Similar to &quot;Strictly Leakage&quot;, the EP was intended to tide over fans until the release of their next album.

===&quot;To All My Friends, Blood Makes The Blade Holy: The Atmosphere EPs&quot; (2010)===
A combination of EPs, the album &quot;To All My Friends, Blood Makes The Blade Holy: The Atmosphere EP&#x27;s&quot; was released in September 2010. The album reached #2 on iTunes top 10 album downloads during the week of September 11, 2010. The album was very favourably reviewed, with some reviews comparing it to the &quot;Lucy Ford&quot; LP. The seventh track of the album, &quot;The Loser Wins,&quot; is on the soundtrack for EA Sports&#x27; &quot;Fight Night Champion.&quot;

===&quot;The Family Sign&quot; (2011)===
After 2010&#x27;s double EP, Atmosphere returned with their first full-length album in three years. &quot;The Family Sign&quot; was released in 2011, and is Atmosphere&#x27;s sixth studio album. Continuing the trend of preceding albums, &quot;The Family Sign&quot; has more instrumentation and is the first album to have actual band musicians. Keyboard player Erick Anderson and guitarist Nate Collis, part of the touring band for Atmosphere (who perform live renditions of songs that are normally sampler/drum machine produced), were brought in to help record the album, leading to a much different sound than previous albums. One of the songs, &quot;Just For Show&quot;, was put on the sound track of &quot;MLB 2K12&quot;.

===&quot;Southsiders&quot; (2014)===
On July 2, 2013, Atmosphere released a new single titled &quot;Bob Seger&quot;. Earlier on in the year, Slug mentioned he was working on a new album. On March 10, 2014, Atmosphere released a video for a new single titled &quot;Bitter&quot;. They also announced that their new album will be called &quot;Southsiders&quot;, which was released on May 6, 2014.

The album track &quot;Kanye West&quot; was released on April 8, 2014, to the group&#x27;s YouTube channel followed by the official video on April 14.

=== &quot;Frida Kahlo vs Ezra Pound&quot;, &quot;Fishing Blues&quot; and &quot;Mi Vida Local&quot; (2016–2018) ===
During span of 2015–2016, Atmosphere released seven new songs including &quot;Finer Things&quot; (feat. deM atlaS), &quot;This Lonely Rose&quot; (feat. Blueprint and Aesop Rock), &quot;My Best Half&quot;, &quot;Salma Hayek&quot;, &quot;Trying to Fly&quot; (feat. Eric Mayson), &quot;Fireflies&quot; (feat. Grieves) and &quot;Windows &quot;(feat. Prof). These eventually were put together and called &quot;Frida Kahlo vs Ezra Pound&quot;. On June 22, 2016, the band announced the track list and release date for their upcoming album, &quot;Fishing Blues&quot;. The first single, titled &quot;Ringo,&quot; was posted on YouTube the same day. On July 29, 2016, they released a new single titled &quot;No Biggie&quot;. The album included guest appearances by rappers Kool Keith, MF Doom, The Grouch, Aesop Rock, and deM atlaS, as well as artists Kim Manning and I.B.E. The album was released on August 12, 2016.

In 2018, a promotional song named &quot;Make It All Better Again&quot; was released. Shortly after, a new album, &quot;Mi Vida Local&quot;, was announced to be released in October 2018.

===&quot;Mi Vida Local&quot; (2018), &quot;Whenever&quot; (2019) and &quot;The Day Before Halloween&quot; (2020)===
On October 5, 2018, Atmosphere released their ninth album, &quot;Mi Vida Local&quot;. The album features 12 tracks, including the pre-released single &quot;Virgo&quot; in September.

On November 8, 2019, Atmosphere released a new single &quot;Bde Maka Ska&quot;, along with tour dates for 2020.

On December 12, 2019, Atmosphere released their tenth album, &quot;Whenever&quot;. The album features 12 tracks, including the pre-released single &quot;Bde Maka Ska&quot;.

On September 23, 2020, Atmosphere released a new single &quot;Blotter Acid Reflux Syndrome&quot; and announced a new album titled &quot;The Day Before Halloween&quot; to be released on the date referenced in-title. &quot;The Day Before Halloween&quot; includes 10 tracks and was released October 30, 2020.

=== &quot;Word?&quot; and &quot;So Many Other Realities Exist Simultaneously&quot; (2021–2023) ===
On October 8, 2021, Atmosphere released their twelfth album, &quot;Word?&quot;

On May 5, 2023, Atmosphere released their thirteenth album, &quot;So Many Other Realities Exist Simultaneously.&quot;

==Touring==
Slug credits most of the group&#x27;s success to the large amount of touring they do. In the early days, they once drove from Minneapolis to Dallas to play a show for $250.

While touring around the years of the new millennium, Slug, Eyedea, and DJ Abilities would perform shows together as Atmosphere. Eyedea would support MC, perform his own songs, and freestyle with Slug and DJ Abilities would DJ. Soon after the release of God Loves Ugly, Mr. Dibbs would tour with Atmosphere instead of Eyedea &amp; Abilities.

During the &quot;@ It Again&quot; tour, Atmosphere was accompanied by a live band, with Nate Collis on guitar (2004-2012), Brett Johnson on bass guitar (2004-2008), Erick Anderson on keyboards (2004-2012) and Patrick Armitage on drums (2004-2005). Armitage was replaced in late 2005 by Brian McLeod (2005–2008) for the &quot;Pour Me Another&quot; tour. The live set-up brought a jazzy, more improvisational feel to Atmosphere&#x27;s sound. Slug has said he wanted to play with a live band to add more of a challenge to performing live. Atmosphere has been playing with a live band since at least 2001.

Since the Paint Your City Gold series of &quot;release parties&quot; in support of &quot;When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold&quot;, the live band has been re-rostered with Ant providing percussion as DJ, Nate Collis on guitar and back up vocals, Erick Anderson on keyboards and synthesizers and Mankwe Ndosi as the &quot;human samples&quot;.

In spring 2009, Atmosphere embarked on the &quot;When God Gives You Ugly&quot; tour to celebrate the re-release of the 2002 album &quot;God Loves Ugly&quot; (which had been out of print) as well as their studio LP &quot;When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold&quot;. Slug and Ant were accompanied by Attracted To Gods, P.O.S, Brother Ali, Eyedea and Abilities during the tour.

In late 2016, Atmosphere toured for their album &quot;Fishing Blues&quot;. They started their forty show tour in Chicago in July and wrapped it up in Cleveland in November. Atmosphere had special guests at some of their shows, music groups like Lifter Puller, Brother Ali, deM atlaS, and Dilated Peoples.

==Lyrical content==
A prominent theme in Slug&#x27;s lyrics is his allegorical usage of women, especially in his earlier work. A notable use of women by Slug is in the song &quot;Woman with the Tattooed Hands&quot;, which he has said is &quot;a metaphor for that same old shit that everybody has already made songs about. Just trying to find your place within a belief and faith as well as people that you want to have sex with.&quot; Further examples come in the song &quot;Abusing of the Rib&quot; from &quot;;&quot; it has been said that the &quot;lover&quot; Slug speaks of is actually an allegory for hip-hop itself. In the tour-only release &quot;Sad Clown Bad Dub II&quot;, Slug used both symbolism and metaphor with references to nature and relationships throughout each song, culminating in the album&#x27;s penultimate track &quot;The River.&quot;

The most notable example of such allegories is a character whom Slug refers to as &quot;Lucy,&quot; who has been purported to be a symbol of a range of different entities. In earlier Atmosphere songs, it is believed that Slug used Lucy as a means of writing about ex-girlfriends. Lucy became so prominent that Atmosphere&#x27;s 2001 album bore her name, &quot;Lucy Ford: The Atmosphere EPs&quot;, with the record itself concentrating fairly heavily on women and relationships in songs such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Ever Fucking Question That&quot; and &quot;Mama Had A Baby And His Head Popped Off.&quot; The song &quot;Fuck You Lucy&quot; from &quot;God Loves Ugly&quot; has been said to deal with Slug&#x27;s dependency on alcohol. Slug himself has since said of Lucy that he originally believed &quot;her&quot; to be a representation of the dichotomy between himself and women. He acknowledges now that Lucy became a demonization (&quot;Lucy Ford&quot; being a play on words for Lucifer) of himself and his dependency on alcohol, drugs, sex and validation.

Slug raps in a very introspective style, as seen on the song &quot;Little Man,&quot; in which he confronts the complaints that people have about him by looking at his relationship with his father and son. This introspective style became less prevalent with &quot;When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold&quot; (2008) in which Slug navigates through other peoples&#x27; lives. &quot;When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold&quot; has been noted as more of a dark album than previous works. Slug maintains the allegorical stance from previous records in songs such as &quot;Your Glass House&quot; which deals with his emotions towards the war in Iraq under the guise of a person waking up from a hangover.

Slug also dislikes some of the songs that he wrote before and does not perform them live, such as &quot;Vampires&quot; from 2002 album &quot;God Loves Ugly&quot;. Daley has stated, &quot;when I did get my phase of trying to figure myself out, there was a lot of tug-of-war inside of me between wanting to hate a particular woman and then feeling guilty about that. And there&#x27;s certain songs that I won&#x27;t perform anymore, because the game of tug-of-war is over and I know where I&#x27;m at&quot;. Furthermore, Slug has criticized Atmosphere&#x27;s first album &quot;Overcast!&quot;, saying: &quot;It&#x27;s obvious that I&#x27;m trying so fucking hard on &quot;Overcast&quot; and you can see through it and tell it&#x27;s not a person it&#x27;s more of an attempt at trying to fill the niche, it was like I was trying to prove to myself that I was a rapper.&quot;

==Collaborations==
Slug has also released three albums with Murs from the West Coast hip hop group Living Legends. The idea for &quot;&quot;, their first album as a duo, came about while on tour. The two decided to see if they could garner some extra media attention for Ricci by dedicating their album to her, although according to Slug, Ricci has never responded to this or contacted the band. This debut studio album was produced by The Grouch from Living Legends.

Their second collaboration, &quot;Felt, Vol. 2: A Tribute to Lisa Bonet&quot;, produced by Ant, was released in 2005. Their third Felt album was announced on the duo&#x27;s MySpace page, leaking the track &quot;Protagonists&quot; from the album and announcing the title (&quot;A Tribute to Rosie Perez&quot;), the release date (November 17, 2009) and the producer, Aesop Rock.

Slug was also part of Deep Puddle Dynamics, along with Anticon artists DoseOne, Alias and Sole. Their only full-length release together was &quot;The Taste of Rain... Why Kneel?&quot;. The album was produced by Jel, Ant, Alias and others.

Slug has also appeared on albums by Buckshot of Black Moon and KRS-ONE, Hangar 18, C-Rayz Walz, CunninLynguists, Brother Ali, Eyedea &amp; Abilities, Evidence, Berner, Aesop Rock, Unknown Prophets, KRS-One, Oddjobs, Vakill, DoseOne, Jel, P.O.S, X-Ecutioners, Kanser, Blueprint, Illogic, Heiruspecs, Kristoff Krane, Dem Atlas, Mac Lethal, Jean Grae, Parallel Thought, Static &amp; Nat Ill, Grieves, DJ Vadim, Booka B, El-P, MF Doom, Roosevelt Franklin, Grayskul, Minnesota indie rock band Lifter Puller, Cool-Aide (iCON the Mic King &amp; Chum), Anomaly (a.k.a. Jason Heinrichs), and several Living Legends albums as well as Living Legends solo projects such as The CMA. Slug also took time to congratulate DJ Free Leonard on his song &quot;Wise Words Spoken&quot; Featuring CMA (The Grouch and Lucky I AM of the Living Legends) in a now viral moment online.

==Honors and awards==
Atmosphere has been honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, recognizing performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star &quot;might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis,&quot; according to journalist Steve Marsh.
