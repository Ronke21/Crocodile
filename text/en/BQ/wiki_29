==Education background==
Jordanovski was born in Štip. He received his BEng in Electrical Engineering from the University of Zagreb. He received his PhD from the University of Southern California in 1985.
==Political activities==
He was a member of the Social Democratic Union of Macedonia party. He took office as Speaker of the Assembly on 18 November 2003. 
As Speaker of the Assembly, according to the Republic of Macedonia&#x27;s constitution he was the successor to the president in the event of the president&#x27;s inability to serve.

===Acting President of Macedonia===
Accordingly, when President Boris Trajkovski was killed in a plane crash on 26 February 2004, Jordanovski was sworn in as president.

He was the acting president of the Republic of Macedonia from 26 February 2004 to 12 May 2004. He left office after presidential elections in which he did not run. He continued in his role as Speaker after his time as acting president, until 2 August 2006.

===Ambassador to the United States===
On 6 July 2006 he was accredited as the Ambassador of the Republic of Macedonia to the United States of America, but at the end of December he was recalled by the Government of the Republic of Macedonia. He died unexpectedly in Skopje.

<text>Hans Vaihinger (; ; September 25, 1852 – December 18, 1933) was a German philosopher, best known as a Kant scholar and for his &quot;Die Philosophie des Als Ob&quot; (&quot;The Philosophy of &#x27;As if&#x27;&quot;), published in 1911 although its statement of basic principles had been written more than thirty years earlier.

==Early life and educationy==
Vaihinger was born in Nehren, Württemberg, Germany, near Tübingen, and raised in what he described as a &quot;very religious atmosphere&quot;. He was educated at the University of Tübingen (the Tübinger Stift), Leipzig University, and the University of Berlin. 

==Career==
Vaihinger became a tutor and later a philosophy professor at the University of Strasbourg. In 1884 he moved to the University of Halle, where from 1892 he was a full professor.
==Personal life and death==
By 1900 Vaihinger’s health had deteriorated. His health, especially his failing eyesight, forced Vaihinger to step down from his professorship. In 1926 Vaihinger suffered complete blindness. Vaihinger died on December 18 1933.

==Work==
In &quot;Die Philosophie des Als Ob&quot;, Vaihinger argued that human beings can never really know the underlying reality of the world, and that as a result people construct systems of thought and then assume that these match reality: they behave &quot;as if&quot; the world matches their models. In particular, he used examples from the physical sciences, such as protons, electrons, and electromagnetic waves. None of these phenomena have been observed directly, but science assumes and pretends that they exist, and uses observations made on these assumptions to create new and better constructs.

Vaihinger acknowledged several precursors, especially Kant, and Hermann Lotze and wrote that he felt vindicated by Friedrich Albert Lange, but had been unaware of Jeremy Bentham&#x27;s &quot;Theory of Fictions&quot; until, at the very end of his life, it was brought to his attention by his translator, C. K. Ogden. 

In the preface to the English edition of his work, Vaihinger expressed his &quot;principle of fictionalism&quot;: &quot;An idea whose theoretical untruth or incorrectness, and therewith its falsity, is admitted, is not for that reason practically valueless and useless; for such an idea, in spite of its theoretical nullity[,] may have great practical importance.&quot; Moreover, Vaihinger denied that his philosophy was a form of skepticism because skepticism implies a doubting, whereas in his &#x27;as if&#x27; philosophy the acceptance of patently false fictions is justified as a pragmatic non-rational solution to problems that have no rational answers.

Fictions in this sense, however, Vaihinger considers to be only &quot;half-fictions or semi-fictions&quot;. Rather, &quot;real fictions&quot; are those that &quot;are not only in contradiction with reality but self-contradictory in themselves; the concept of the atom, for example, or the &#x27;Ding an sich&#x27;.&quot; However, the two types &quot;are not sharply divided from one another but are connected by transitions. Thought begins with slight initial deviations from reality (half-fictions), and, becoming bolder and bolder, ends by operating with constructs that are not only opposed to the facts but are self-contradictory.&quot;

This philosophy, though, is wider than just science. One can never be sure that the world will still exist tomorrow, but one usually assumes that it will. Alfred Adler, the founder of Individual Psychology, was profoundly influenced by Vaihinger&#x27;s theory of useful fictions, incorporating the idea of psychological fictions into his personality construct of a fictional final goal.

Vaihinger’s philosophy of &#x27;as if&#x27; can be viewed as one of the central premises upon which George Kelly&#x27;s personal construct psychology is based. Kelly credited Vaihinger with influencing his theory, especially the idea that our constructions are better viewed as useful hypotheses rather than representations of objective reality. Kelly wrote: &quot;Vaihinger&#x27;s &#x27;as if&#x27; philosophy has value for psychology (...) Vaihinger began to develop a system of philosophy he called the &quot;philosophy of &#x27;as if&#x27; &quot;. In it he offered a system of thought in which God and reality might best be represented as paradigms. This was not to say that either God or reality was any less certain than anything else in the realm of man’s awareness, but only that all matters confronting man might best be regarded in hypothetical ways&quot;.

Frank Kermode&#x27;s &quot;The Sense of an Ending&quot; (1967) was an early mention of Vaihinger as a useful methodologist of narrativity. He says that &quot;literary fictions belong to Vaihinger’s category of &#x27;the consciously false.&#x27; They are not subject, like hypotheses, to proof or disconfirmation, only, if they come to lose their operational effectiveness, to neglect.&quot;

Later, James Hillman developed both Vaihinger and Adler&#x27;s work with psychological fictions into a core theme of his work &quot;Healing Fiction&quot; in which he makes one of his more accessible cases for identifying the tendency to literalize, rather than &quot;see through our meanings&quot;, with neurosis and madness.

==Critical reception and legacy==
During his own lifetime Vaihinger&#x27;s works were generally well received both in Germany and abroad, especially in America. When, in 1924, his &quot;Philosophy of As If&quot; was published in English, the original 1911 book was already in its sixth edition. However, the American journalist Mencken was scathing in his criticism of the book, which he dismissed as an unimportant &quot;foot-note to all existing systems&quot;. Vaihinger was also criticised by the Logical positivists who made &quot;curt and disparaging references&quot; to his work.

After his death, and the intellectual sea change that followed the Second World War, Vaihinger&#x27;s work received little attention from philosophers. It was left to psychologists such as Kelly and writers such as Kermode to draw upon his central ideas. However, the interest of literary scholars has continued modestly with the publication of some recent &quot;Vaihinger-inflected critical literature&quot;. A reappraisal of Vaihinger by the American philosopher Arthur Fine concluded that Vaihinger was actually the &quot;preeminent twentieth-century philosopher of modeling&quot;. Vaihinger&#x27;s influence has since markedly increased, and the currently booming fictionalism movement in the philosophy of science takes his contributions as its main historical lead and inspiration.

<doc id="492445" wikidata="Q103896" url="?curid=492445" title="Compass (drawing tool)">
<text>A compass, also commonly known as a pair of compasses, is a technical drawing instrument that can be used for inscribing circles or arcs. As dividers, it can also be used as a tool to mark out distances, in particular, on maps. Compasses can be used for mathematics, drafting, navigation and other purposes.

Prior to computerization, compasses and other tools for manual drafting were often packaged as a set with interchangeable parts. By the mid-twentieth century, circle templates supplemented the use of compasses. Today those facilities are more often provided by computer-aided design programs, so the physical tools serve mainly a didactic purpose in teaching geometry, technical drawing, etc.

==Construction and parts==
Compasses are usually made of metal or plastic, and consist of two &quot;legs&quot; connected by a hinge which can be adjusted to allow changing of the radius of the circle drawn. Typically one leg has a spike at its end for anchoring, and the other leg holds a drawing tool, such as a pencil, a short length of just pencil lead or sometimes a pen.

===Handle===
The handle, a small knurled rod above the hinge, is usually about half an inch long. Users can grip it between their pointer finger and thumb.

===Legs===
There are two types of leg in a pair of compasses: the straight or the steady leg and the adjustable one. Each has a separate purpose; the steady leg serves as the basis or support for the needle point, while the adjustable leg can be altered in order to draw different sizes of circles.

===Hinge===
The screw through the hinge holds the two legs in position. The hinge can be adjusted, depending on desired stiffness; the tighter the hinge-screw, the more accurate the compass&#x27;s performance. The better quality compass, made of plated metal, is able to be finely adjusted via a small, serrated wheel usually set between the legs (see the &quot;using a compass&quot; animation shown above) and it has a (dangerously powerful) spring encompassing the hinge. This sort of compass is often known as a &quot;pair of Spring-Bow Compasses&quot;.

===Needle point===
The needle point is located on the steady leg, and serves as the center point of the circle that is about to be drawn.

===Pencil lead===
The pencil lead draws the circle on a particular paper or material. Alternatively, an ink nib or attachment with a technical pen may be used. The better quality compass, made of metal, has its piece of pencil lead specially sharpened to a &quot;chisel edge&quot; shape, rather than to a point.

===Adjusting nut===
This holds the pencil lead or pen in place.

==Uses==

Circles can be made by pushing one leg of the compasses into the paper with the spike, putting the pencil on the paper, and moving the pencil around while keeping the legs at the same angle. Some people who find this action difficult often hold the compasses still and move the paper round instead. The radius of the intended circle can be changed by adjusting the initial angle between the two legs.

Distances can be measured on a map using compasses with two spikes, also called a dividing compass (or just &quot;dividers&quot;). The hinge is set in such a way that the distance between the spikes on the map represents a certain distance in reality, and by measuring how many times the compasses fit between two points on the map the distance between those points can be calculated.

==Compasses and straightedge==
Compasses-and-straightedge constructions are used to illustrate principles of plane geometry. Although a real pair of compasses is used to draft visible illustrations, the ideal compass used in proofs is an abstract creator of perfect circles. The most rigorous definition of this abstract tool is the &quot;collapsing compass&quot;; having drawn a circle from a given point with a given radius, it disappears; it cannot simply be moved to another point and used to draw another circle of equal radius (unlike a real pair of compasses). Euclid showed in his second proposition (Book I of the &quot;Elements&quot;) that such a collapsing compass could be used to transfer a distance, proving that a collapsing compass could do anything a real compass can do.

==Variants==
A beam compass is an instrument, with a wooden or brass beam and sliding sockets, cursors or trammels, for drawing and dividing circles larger than those made by a regular pair of compasses.

Scribe-compasses is an instrument used by carpenters and other tradesmen. Some compasses can be used to draw circles, bisect angles and, in this case, to trace a line. It is the compass in the most simple form. Both branches are crimped metal. One branch has a pencil sleeve while the other branch is crimped with a fine point protruding from the end. A wing nut on the hinge serves two purposes: first it tightens the pencil and secondly it locks in the desired distance when the wing nut is turned clockwise.

Loose leg wing dividers are made of all forged steel. The pencil holder, thumb screws, brass pivot and branches are all well built. They are used for scribing circles and stepping off repetitive measurements with some accuracy.

A reduction compass or proportional dividers is used to reduce or enlarge patterns while conserving angles.

Ellipse drawing compasses are used to draw ellipse.
== As a symbol ==
A pair of compasses is often used as a symbol of precision and discernment. As such it finds a place in logos and symbols such as the Freemasons&#x27; Square and Compasses and in various computer icons. English poet John Donne used the compass as a conceit in &quot;A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning&quot; (1611).

<doc id="492447" wikidata="Q9323179" url="?curid=492447" title="Ruff (cards)">
<text>In trick-taking games, to ruff means to play a trump card to a trick (other than when trumps were led). According to the rules of most games, a player must have no cards left in the suit led in order to ruff. Since the other players are constrained to follow suit if they can, even a low trump can win a trick. In some games, like Pinochle and Preferans, the player who cannot follow suit is required to ruff. In others, like Bridge and Whist, he may instead discard (play any card in any other suit). Normally, ruffing will win a trick. But it is also possible that a subsequent player will overruff (play a higher trump). Historically, ruff meant to &quot;rob&quot; i.e. exchange a card with the stock.

==Usage of the word &quot;ruff&quot; vs. &quot;trump&quot;==
&quot;Ruff&quot; is normally a verb, meaning &quot;to play a trump card when a non-trump suit was led&quot;. &quot;To trump&quot; can be used as a synonym of &quot;to ruff&quot;, but &quot;ruff&quot; is normally preferred, for clarity. As a noun, &quot;ruff&quot; and &quot;trump&quot; are completely different – &quot;a ruff&quot; means only &quot;an instance of ruffing&quot;, while &quot;(a) trump&quot; means only &quot;the suit that outranks all other suits&quot;, or &quot;a card in this suit&quot;. Hence:
* One can &quot;give a ruff&quot; to partner but not &quot;give a trump&quot;.
* &quot;Hearts are trumps&quot; but not &quot;Hearts are ruffs&quot;.
* &quot;Cross ruffing&quot; and &quot;cross trumping&quot; are both correct, but &quot;cross ruffing&quot; is preferred.
* &quot;Ruff and discard&quot; is common usage but &quot;trump and discard&quot; is not.

==Ruffing and cross-ruffing in partnership games==
*A player gives a ruff by leading a card of a suit in which partner is void, enabling the trick to be taken with a trump card. Partner will then attempt to get the lead back into the original hand, by leading a certain suit, so that the process can be repeated.
*A crossruff is a play where tricks are made by taking alternate ruffs in each hand. In order to use a crossruff, each player in the partnership must have shortness in a non-trump suit, accompanied with appropriate length in the opposite hand. Also, each partner must be short in the suit that his partner is long in. It is preferable that both players have an equal number of cards in the trump suit, otherwise a regular ruff is usually more effective, as it has the added benefit of establishing the trump suit.
**The mechanics of the crossruff are simple but the effect can be dramatic as this extreme example, from a bridge hand, demonstrates:
West plays the grand slam of 7♠ despite having only 7 high card points. The declarer can draw the outstanding trump king, ruff the diamonds in dummy, going back to the hand by club ruffs. Unless both minor suits are divided 6-0, one of the minor suits will ultimately become high and provide the missing two tricks. In summary, the declarer took one trick by leading a high card (the ace of trumps) and 10 tricks by cross-ruffing; the remaining two tricks came as result of long suit establishment.
**However, there are risks with crossruffing: when the opponents also run out of cards in the suit(s) being ruffed, they can overruff (play a higher trump card); also this play may leave the trump suit unestablished so that opponents may be able to steal back a trick or two using their trumps later. Crossruffing is therefore just one possible strategy for taking extra tricks, others are establishing the trump suit, traditional ruffing and finessing.
**Bridge considerations: the additional information given by the existence of the &quot;dummy&quot; in bridge produces many opportunities for ruffing and cross-ruffing
***It is often important to cash side-suit winners before commencing a cross-ruff, otherwise the opponents may discard in the side-suit, allowing them to trump the winner later.
***In some cases, it is effective to cross-ruff after drawing the opponents&#x27; trumps, when this can be done with trumps remaining in both hands.
***In other cases, it is effective to cross-ruff only until one opponent becomes likely to be void in a particular suit, and revert to drawing trumps thereafter.
**The basic defense against crossruff is simple: lead trumps whenever possible, removing trumps from both opponent&#x27;s hands. In bridge this may mean that, the defense must lead trumps from the opening lead in order to prevail. Thus, it is important to recognize the situations when a trump opening lead is called for – usually, they arise when both declarer and dummy have bid other suits but found the trump fit in the third one.

==Ruff and discard==
A ruff and discard (also known as &quot;ruff and slough&quot; or &quot;ruff and sluff&quot;) occurs when a player leads a suit that neither opponent has – typically in a suit contract, a defender leads a suit in which dummy and declarer are both void and dummy and declarer have at least one trump each. This gives declarer the option of discarding a losing card from one hand while playing a trump from the other, usually garnering an additional trick in the process. Thus, the ruff and discard is generally to be avoided by the defenders, except in rare cases where declarer has no side suit loser to discard. It is often inflicted upon the defence via an endplay.

In the position shown, West is on lead and spades are trumps:
When West leads a heart, declarer can ruff in one hand and throw a club loser from the other, making both the remaining tricks. With any other player on lead, declarer would only make one trick.

However, if one of N-S hands had a diamond instead of a club, then West&#x27;s lead would make no difference: the declarer can always take the remaining two tricks by crossruffing clubs and diamonds.

Similar events can occur in other trick taking games where partnerships exist (e.g. whist) and occasionally for the defending side in bridge.

==Uses of ruffing techniques in bridge and other whist type games==

===Dummy reversal===
Dummy reversal (also known as &quot;reverse dummy&quot;) is a technique in contract bridge whereby declarer uses trump cards to ruff from the hand with more (longer) trumps, and retains the trumps in the other (shorter) hand to draw the opponents&#x27; remaining trumps. Normally in play technique, ruffs are taken from the hand with shorter trumps, retaining trumps in the longer hand for control. Declarer, being the first to have bid the suit, usually has more trumps than his partner (the eventual dummy) and so the term &quot;dummy reversal&quot; is used to describe the case where during the play, dummy is made to have more.

The purpose of dummy reversal is to yield more tricks than the normal technique; the technique can be adapted for use in other trick-taking games.

====Indicators====

Some indicators that a hand may lend itself to dummy reversal are:
* shortness (singleton or void) in declarer&#x27;s hand with length in the same suit in dummy
* loser(s) in declarer&#x27;s hand that cannot be ruffed or discarded on a side suit
* adequate trump strength and length in dummy (typically a three or four card trump suit with at least two honors for drawing the final trumps)
* entries to dummy outside of the trump suit

====Example====
East is in 4♠ and receives a trump lead. There are five trump tricks, three aces and king of diamonds off the top, but there is no tempo to ruff a club in dummy, as the defenders will deprive it of the trumps after they regain the lead in clubs. The solution is to ruff hearts in hand instead – in trick two, East plays ♥A, ruffs a heart, enters the dummy with ♣A, ruffs a heart, enters the dummy with ♦A and ruffs a heart. In this way, the declarer took three ruffs in hand, and still has two trumps in dummy to take care of opponents&#x27; trumps (assuming that they are divided 3-2, which is the most common division of five cards).

===Ruffing finesse===

A finesse is an attempt to take a trick with a card, not the highest in the suit, by taking advantage of the lie of the cards. At its simplest a ruffing finesse involves a high sequence (e.g. KQJ) opposite a void in the same suit. The K is led and partner is prepared to ruff if the intervening player plays the ace, or discard if the ace is not played. Repetition of this will avoid the loss of a trick to the ace, but it only works when the ace is on the right side (i.e. 50%)

===Trump promotion===

A technique where one side creates an otherwise non-existing trump trick by ruffing high knowing it will be over-ruffed or, in other situations, by refusing to over-ruff.

===Uppercut===

A play that involves one player ruffing high in the hope that an overruff by an opponent will result in the promotion of a trump card in partner&#x27;s hand into a winner. This is a type of trump promotion.

===Trump coup===

A play that substitutes for a direct finesse in the trump suit because the hand required to lead has no trumps. At the point of execution it is important that the hand being finessed and the next hand have only trumps so that the hand being finessed is forced to trump, allowing the next hand to over-ruff. A trump reduction play is sometimes a necessary precursor to a trump coup.

===Coup en passant===

A play where a trump trick is &quot;stolen&quot; by taking the opportunity to ruff after the player who has the master trump. This is a type of indirect finesse.

===Trump squeeze===

A play involving a simple squeeze where a side suit presents a menace which can be established by ruffing.

===Bridge strategies===
Normal suit play in bridge (as opposed to the play at no trumps) revolves around the trump suit. Usually the declarer and dummy together will have the majority of trumps, as they chose the suit in which to play. Declarer will attempt to draw the opponents&#x27; trumps, leaving them with none. Declarer&#x27;s remaining trumps ensure that the opponents cannot establish long cards, as they will just be trumped.

Although drawing the opponent&#x27;s trumps is usually to be recommended, there are occasions when other strategies yield more tricks. One is crossruffing – drawing the opponents trumps in this case reduces the number of trumps (and hence tricks) for the crossruff. Another case is when after drawing one or two rounds of trumps the opponents are left with one master trump. In this case drawing it will use two of declarer&#x27;s trumps for one of the opponents&#x27;. Unless entry problems are feared, it is usually better to let the opponents take their trump when they will.

It is important to realize that trumping in the hand with more trumps does not add tricks, as these are long cards that will win anyway. In order to gain tricks by trumping, the ruff has to be taken in the short hand, or enough ruffs must be made in the hand that was originally longer in trumps to make it shorter than the other hand (dummy reversal, described above).

<doc id="492449" wikidata="Q4383971" url="?curid=492449" title="Qibla compass">
<text>A qibla (qiblah) compass (sometimes also called qibla/qiblah indicator or &quot;qiblanuma&quot;) is a modified compass used by Muslims to indicate the direction to face to perform prayers. In Islam, this direction is called qibla, and points towards the city of Mecca and specifically to the Kaaba. While the compass, like any other compass, points north, the direction of prayer is indicated by marks on the perimeter of the dial, corresponding to different cities, or by a second pointer set by the user according to their own location. To determine the proper direction, one has to know with some precision both the longitude and latitude of one&#x27;s own location and those of Mecca, the city toward which one must face. Once that is determined, the values are applied to a spherical triangle, and the angle from the local meridian to the required direction of Mecca can be determined.

The indicator usually consists of a round brass box with a hinged lid and an inset magnetic compass. A list of important Islamic places with their longitudes, latitudes, is inscribed in Arabic on all sides of the box. The compass has a blued steel needle with an open circle to indicate North. It is surmounted by a brass pyramidal pivot and a glass plate covers all. A brass ring over the rim of the compass carries a degree circle numbered in &#x27;abjad&#x27; numerals and the cardinal points are marked. The folding triangular gnomon is supported by a decorative open-work motif. The lid of the box is secured by a hook fastener. The instrument serves the user to determine the correct &#x27;qibla&#x27; - the direction to which Muslims turn in prayer to face the Ka&#x27;ba in Mecca.
Ornate qibla compasses date back at least to the 18th century. Some recent versions use digital readout instead of a magnetic pointer.

Some qibla compasses also include a tally counter, used to count the repetition of various du&#x27;a said after prayer.

== History ==
al-Ashraf Umar II (d. 1296), sultan of the Sunni Rasulid Yemeni Caliphate, described the use of the compass as a qibla indicator in the 13th century. In a treatise about astrolabes and sundials, al-Ashraf includes several paragraphs on the construction of a compass bowl (&quot;ṭāsa&quot;). He then uses the compass to determine the north point, the meridian (&quot;khaṭṭ niṣf al-nahār&quot;), and qibla. This is the first mention of a compass in a medieval Islamic scientific text and its earliest known use as a qibla indicator, although al-Ashraf did not claim to be the first to use it for this purpose.

<doc id="492450" wikidata="Q1780806" url="?curid=492450" title="Silphium laciniatum">
<text>Silphium laciniatum is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae known commonly as compassplant or compass plant. It is native to North America, where it occurs in Ontario in Canada and the eastern and central United States as far west as New Mexico. Other common names include prairie compass plant, pilotweed, polarplant, gum weed, cut-leaf silphium, and turpentine plant. It is a rosinweed of genus &quot;Silphium&quot;.

==Description==
This plant is a taprooted perennial herb producing rough-haired stems usually one to three meters tall. The leaves are variable in shape and size, being long and wide. They are hairy, smooth-edged or toothed, and borne on petioles or not. The back of the flower head has layers of rough, glandular phyllaries. The head contains 27 to 38 yellow ray florets and many yellow disc florets. The fruit is a cypsela which can be almost long and is tipped with a pappus of two short awns.

==Biology==
The common name compass plant was inspired by the &quot;compass orientation&quot; of its leaves. The large leaves are held vertically with the tips pointing north or south and the upper and lower surfaces of the blades facing east or west. A newly emerging leaf grows in a random direction, but within two or three weeks it twists on its petiole clockwise or counterclockwise into a vertical position. Studies indicate that the sun&#x27;s position in the early morning hours influences the twisting orientation. This orientation reduces the amount of solar radiation hitting the leaf surface. Vertical leaves facing east-west have higher water use efficiency than horizontal or north-south-facing blades.

Early settlers on the Great Plains could make their way in the dark by feeling of the leaves.

An early, (if not the earliest) descriptive naming of the compass plant is found in the 1843 hunting trip of William Clark Kennerly, who upon leaving Westport Kansas in May 1843, observed the plant and began its description in his trip: &quot;Westward we went, and still westward, through a flat, arid country with no verdure except the compass plant, which we named for the reason that its large, flat leaves always pointed north and south&quot;.

==Ecology==
Surveys of the insect fauna on typical compass plants have noted many different taxa, often present in large numbers. One plant can produce up to 12 stems. Surveys counted an average of nearly 80 insects on each stem or within its tissues. The vast majority of insects on the stems are the gall wasps &quot;Antistrophus rufus&quot; and &quot;A. minor&quot;, and the many types of parasitoids that attack them. The gall wasps, especially &quot;A. rufus&quot;, inject eggs into the stem, an action that induces the formation of a gall in the plant tissue. The larva of the wasp lives and feeds inside the gall, overwinters there, and emerges as an adult the following spring. Over 600 galls can be in a single stem. The galls are internal in this species, and generally not visible. The adult female &quot;A. rufus&quot; locates an appropriate site to oviposit by detecting plant volatiles emitted by the fresh growing stem of its host plant, a mix of monoterpenes. The male &quot;A. rufus&quot; also uses the volatiles in his search for mates. Females mate immediately upon emergence from the gall, and the male uses volatiles to find a gall containing a female, as evidenced by the movements of his antennae upon the plant&#x27;s surface. He then waits there for her to emerge.

Other insects found in the plant include several species of parasitoid wasps that attack &quot;A. rufus&quot; larvae in the galls, the two most common being &quot;Eurytoma luta&quot; and &quot;Ormyrus labotus&quot;. Others include &quot;Eupelmus vesicularis&quot; and species of the genera &quot;Brasema&quot; and &quot;Homoporus&quot;. The beetle &quot;Mordellistena aethiops&quot; lives on the plant, its larvae boring into the stems, and it is attacked by parasitoid wasps of the genera &quot;Schizopyramnus&quot;, &quot;Heterospilus&quot;, and &quot;Tetrastichus&quot;.

Many birds and mammals feed on the fruits of the plant. The eastern kingbird perches on the tall plant to watch for insect prey. Livestock find it palatable.

==Uses==
The plant had a variety of uses among Native American groups. The bitter, resinous sap could be made into a chewing gum. The Pawnee made a tisane with it. Many groups burned the dried root as a charm during lightning.

The plant is cultivated in gardens.

==Literature==
In 1882 Benjamin Alvord reviewed the literature on the plant and offered his observations.

In the environmental classic, &quot;A Sand County Almanac&quot;, Aldo Leopold devotes much of the July entry to &quot;Silphium&quot;—its hardiness, but its slow disappearance nevertheless, a harbinger of the fate of the prairie. &quot;It is easy now to predict the future. For a few years my Silphium will try in vain to rise above the mowing machine, and then it will die. With it will die the prairie epoch.&quot;

<text>COMPASS, &quot;COMP&quot;rehensive &quot;ASS&quot;embler, is any of a family of macro assembly languages for Control Data Corporation&#x27;s 3000 series, and for the 60-bit CDC 6000 series, 7600 and Cyber 70 and 170 series mainframe computers. While the architectures are very different, the macro and conditional assembly facilities are similar.

==COMPASS for 60-bit machines==
There are two &quot;flavors&quot; of COMPASS on the 60-bit machines:
* COMPASS CP is the assembly language for the CP (Central Processor), the processor running user programs. See CDC 6600 CP architecture.
* COMPASS PP is the assembly language for the PP (Peripheral Processor), only running operating system code. See CDC 6600 PP architecture.

COMPASS is a classical two-pass assembler with macro and conditional assembly features, and generates a full listing showing both the source assembly code and the generated machine code (in octal). CDC&#x27;s operating systems were written almost entirely in COMPASS assembly language.

Central processor (CP or CPU) hardware maintains 24 operational registers, named A0 to A7, X0 to X7 and B0 to B7. Registers X0 to X7 are 60 bits long and are used to hold data, while registers B0 to B7 are 18 bits long and their major purpose is to hold either addresses or be used as indexing registers, except that B0 is always zero. As a programming convention, B1 (or B7) often contains positive 1.

A or address registers are also 18 bits long. Each A register pairs with the corresponding X register. Whenever an address is set into any of A1 to A5 registers, the data at that memory location (address) is loaded into the corresponding X register. Likewise, setting an address into one of A6 or A7 registers stores the data held in the corresponding X6 or X7 register to that memory location. However, A0 can be used to hold any address without affecting the contents of register X0.

CP instructions are written in a particularly user-friendly form: &quot;SA1 A0+B1&quot; denotes &quot;set address register A1 to the sum of address register A0 and index register B1&quot;. The hardware then initiates a memory load from the computed address into register X1.

Peripheral processor (PP or PPU) instructions are completely different from CPU instructions. Peripheral processor hardware is simpler; it has an 18-bit A (accumulator register, a 12-bit Program Address register, a 12-bit Q register (not programmer-visible), and a 22-bit R register (used to accomplish address relocation during central memory read and write instructions on Cyber 180 systems). No special job validation was required to assemble peripheral processor programs, but to be executed, such programs were required to installed into the operating system via special system editing commands.

Her other films include &quot;The Wrecking Crew&quot;, &quot;The Happy Ending&quot;, &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot;, and &quot;Johnny Suede&quot;. She also had a recurring role on the primetime soap opera &quot;Dallas&quot;.

== Early life ==
Louise was born Tina Blacker on February 11, 1934, in New York City. An only child, she was raised by her mother, Sylvia (née Horn, later Myers), a fashion model. Her father, Joseph Blacker, was a candy store owner in Brooklyn, and later an accountant. Her parents divorced by the time she was four. Louise attended PS 6, Scarborough Day School and Miami University. She is Jewish.

The name &quot;Louise&quot; was added during her senior year in high school when she mentioned to her drama teacher that she was the only girl in the class without a middle name, and he suggested it.

==Career==
===Early work===
Louise got her first role at age two after being in an ad for her father&#x27;s candy store. She began studying acting, singing, and dancing at age 17 under Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in Manhattan. Her acting debut came in 1952 in the Bette Davis musical revue &quot;Two&#x27;s Company&quot;, followed by roles in such other Broadway productions as &quot;John Murray Anderson&#x27;s Almanac&quot;, &quot;Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?&quot;, and the hit musical &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;. She appeared in the live television dramas &quot;Studio One&quot; and &quot;Producers&#x27; Showcase&quot;.

She was offered modeling jobs, including the 1958 Frederick&#x27;s of Hollywood catalog, and she appeared on the cover of several pinup magazines such as &quot;Adam&quot;, &quot;Sir!&quot;, and &quot;Modern Man&quot;. Her pictorials for &quot;Playboy&quot; in May 1958 and April 1959 were arranged by Columbia Pictures studio in an effort to promote her.

=== Hollywood and &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; ===
Louise made her film debut in 1958 in &quot;God&#x27;s Little Acre&quot;. That same year, the National Art Council named her the &quot;World&#x27;s Most Beautiful Redhead.&quot; The next year, she starred in &quot;Day of the Outlaw&quot; with Robert Ryan. She became a leading lady for stars such as Robert Taylor and Richard Widmark, often playing sombre roles. She turned down roles in the films of &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; and &quot;Operation Petticoat&quot;, taking roles on Broadway and in Italian cinema. Among her Italian film credits were &quot;The Siege of Syracuse&quot; and &quot;Garibaldi&quot; (both in 1960).
Louise returned to the United States, began studying with Lee Strasberg, and became a member of the Actors Studio. In 1962, she guest-starred on the situation comedy &quot;The Real McCoys&quot;, portraying a country girl from West Virginia in the episode &quot;Grandpa Pygmalion&quot;. She appeared with Bob Denver two years later in the beach party film &quot;For Those Who Think Young&quot; (1964). In 1964, she left the Broadway musical &quot;Fade Out – Fade In&quot; to portray movie star Ginger Grant on the situation comedy &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;. Over time, she became unhappy with the role and was worried that it would typecast her. Although she continued to work in film and made guest appearances on television, she claimed repeatedly that playing Ginger had ruined her movie career. She did not appear in any of the subsequent &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; sequel movies: &quot;Rescue from Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; (1978), &quot;The Castaways on Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; (1979), or &quot;The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; (1981). Other actresses played the role of Ginger in the sequels. She maintained a steady acting career after the series ended, going on to appear in the Matt Helm spy spoof &quot;The Wrecking Crew&quot; (1969) with Dean Martin and in &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot; (1975). As of December 2020, she is the last surviving cast member of Gilligan’s Island. 

Louise attempted to shed her comedic image by playing darker roles, such as a heroin addict in a 1974 episode of &quot;Kojak&quot; and as a cruel corrections officer in the 1976 television movie &quot;Nightmare in Badham County&quot;. Other credits from this era include the made-for-TV films &quot;Look What&#x27;s Happened to Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; (1976) and &quot;&quot; (1977), and the soap opera &quot;Dallas&quot; during the 1978–1979 seasons. In the fall of 1984, she succeeded Jo Ann Pflug as Taylor Chapin on the syndicated soap opera &quot;Rituals&quot;.

===Later work===

Later film roles included a co-starring appearance in the Robert Altman comedy &quot;O.C. and Stiggs&quot; (1987) as well as the independently made satire &quot;Johnny Suede&quot; (1992) starring Brad Pitt. She appeared in the situation comedy &quot;Married... with Children&quot; as Miss Beck in episode &quot;Kelly Bounces Back&quot; (1990). In 2014, Louise starred in the spiritual drama &quot;Tapestry&quot; and the horror film &quot;Late Phases&quot;.

Although Louise declined to participate in any of three &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; reunion television films, she made brief walk-on appearances on a few talk shows and specials for &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; reunions, including &quot;Good Morning America&quot; (1982), &quot;The Late Show&quot; (1988) and the 2004 TV Land award show with the other surviving cast members. In the 1990s, she was reunited with costars Bob Denver, Dawn Wells, and Russell Johnson in an episode of &quot;Roseanne&quot;. She did not reunite with them for the television film &quot;Surviving Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; (2001), co-produced by Wells; Ginger was portrayed by Kristen Dalton in the television film. Her relations with series star Denver were rumored to be strained, but in 2005, she wrote a brief, affectionate memorial to him in the year-end &quot;farewell&quot; issue of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; after his death.

Following the news of Dawn Wells&#x27; passing in December 2020, Louise denied any longtime rumors that she resented the role of Ginger Grant: &quot;Never true – I loved doing my part, especially after they really started writing for my character, originally billed as a &#x27;Marilyn Monroe&#x27; type of character. A different director took over and really started to write for my character. I really loved my character.&quot; She also said that she was very grateful to the show&#x27;s fans for their continued support, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic: &quot;We were part of the wonderful show that everyone loves and has been a great source of comfort, especially during these times. We brought a lot of joy to people and still do. This show is an escape from so many things going on. Fathers share it with their children now. I get letters all the time about that.&quot;

==Music==
Louise made one record album, &quot;It&#x27;s Time for Tina&quot;, which was released originally on Concert Hall in 1957 (Concert Hall 1521), and later reissued on Urania Records (1958 and 1959 respectively). With arrangements by Jim Timmens and Buddy Weed&#x27;s Orchestra, 12 tracks include &quot;Tonight Is the Night&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m in the Mood for Love.&quot; Coleman Hawkins is featured on tenor sax. The album has been reissued on CD twice, most recently on the UK label Harkit Records. The album was released on iTunes in 2012. She also recorded for United Artists Records but recorded just one single for that label in 1958.

==Personal life==
A Democrat, Tina Louise campaigned for John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential race.

From 1966 to 1971, Louise was married to radio and TV announcer/interviewer Les Crane, with whom she had one daughter, Caprice (born 1970), who became an MTV producer and a novelist. Caprice Crane&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Stupid and Contagious&quot;, was published in 2006, and was dedicated to her mother.

From 1965 to 1968, Les Crane had simultaneous careers as an actor and an interviewer who covered a wide variety of controversial topics. In 1969, when he concentrated on acting, he and his wife Tina appeared together as a fictitious married couple in a segment of &quot;Love, American Style&quot; titled &quot;Love and the Advice-Givers.&quot;

Louise is a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and a lifetime member of the Actors Studio. Louise has been a vocal advocate for improving child literacy. She donated a portion of the proceeds of her 2007 book, &quot;When I Grow Up&quot;, to literacy programs and said in a 2013 interview that she had been volunteering at local public schools since 1996. She has written three books including &quot;Sunday: A Memoir&quot; (1997) and &quot;When I Grow Up&quot; (2007). &quot;When I Grow Up&quot; is a children&#x27;s book that inspires children to believe they can become whatever they choose through creative and humorous comparisons of animal kingdom achievements. She also published a second children&#x27;s book titled &quot;What Does a Bee Do?&quot; in 2009.

Louise is quoted as saying, &quot;The best movie you&#x27;ll ever be in is your own life because that&#x27;s what matters in the end.&quot;

Louise campaigned for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential race.

<doc id="492474" wikidata="Q2757591" url="?curid=492474" title="Javagal Srinath">
<text>Javagal Srinath (, born 31 August 1969) is a former Indian cricketer and currently an ICC match referee. He is considered among India&#x27;s finest fast bowlers and is the only Indian fast bowler till date to have taken more than 300 wickets in One Day Internationals. With India, Srinath was a member of the Indian team that was the joint-winners of the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy, a title they shared with Sri Lanka, and was a member of the team that were runners-up in the 2003 Cricket World Cup.

Srinath was a frontline fast bowler for the Indian cricket team until his retirement, and the second Indian pace bowler after Kapil Dev to take 200 Test match wickets. After Kapil Dev retired, Srinath led the Indian fast-bowling attack for over nine years. He remains India&#x27;s second-highest &quot;One Day International&quot; wicket-taker with 315, second to Anil Kumble. In the four World Cup&#x27;s he played in: 1992, 1996, 1999 and 2003, he took 44 wickets and was the joint highest wicket-taker for India in World Cups with Zaheer Khan. He is one of the fastest bowlers to have played for India.

Srinath retired from international cricket after the 2003 Cricket World Cup in South Africa.

==Personal life==
Srinath was born in August 1969 at Mysore in Karnataka. He played cricket from an early age. He attended Marimallappa High School and has a Bachelor of Engineering degree in instrumentation from Sri Jayachamarajendra College of Engineering (SJCE) in Mysore. He married his first wife, Jyothsna, in 1999. After their divorce, he married journalist Madhavi Patravali in 2008.

==Domestic career==
Srinath caught the eye of former Indian Test batsman Gundappa Viswanath, a selector for the state team, during a club match. He made his first-class debut for Karnataka against Hyderabad in 1989–90, taking a hat-trick in the first innings in which he bowled and taking wickets from successive balls in the second. He finished the season with 25 wickets in six matches, and took another 20 the following season. His second season involved a display of reverse swing against Maharashtra at Nehru Stadium in Pune, taking 7/93 to dismiss the home team for 311 in response to a Karnataka total of 638 on a good batting pitch.

Srinath took over 500 first-class wickets, including 96 at an average of 24.06 runs per wicket for Karnataka. He played in English county cricket for Gloucestershire in 1995 and took 87 wickets that season, including 9/76 against Glamorgan. Srinath also played county cricket for Leicestershire and Durham.

==International career==
Srinath made his One Day International debut at Sharjah in 1991. He played 11 ODIs and two Test matches in his debut year, taking 14 ODI wickets at an average of 30.00. He was selected for the Indian team for its 1991–92 tour of Australia, making his test debut against Australia at Brisbane. He took 3/59 as the third fast bowler during the match and finished the tour with ten wickets at 55.30. With an opportunity to take the new ball against South Africa in Cape Town, he took an economical 4/33 in 27 overs and ended the tour with 12 wickets at 26.08. Because the wickets in India were conducive to spin, however, Srinath spent seven consecutive home Test matches watching from the sidelines as India fielded only two fast bowlers.

Following the retirement of Kapil Dev in late 1994, Srinath played his first home Test match, playing against the West Indies. He took five wickets and scored 60 in the second innings to be named Player of the Match. His increased opportunities coincided with an improvement in his batting, and he scored two half-centuries during the series.

Srinath was considered a very fast bowler in his early years. In the 1997–98 Test series against Australia, one of Srinath&#x27;s deliveries was measured at and Zimbabwe captain Alistair Campbell considered him faster than Lance Klusener and Allan Donald at their peak. He and Grant Flower had also faced Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram. Srinath was India&#x27;s only regular fast bowler for many years, and his workload is believed to have caused his injuries; he underwent surgery on his right shoulder in 1997.

===Injuries===
Srinath&#x27;s rotator-cuff injury, diagnosed in March 1997, kept him away from cricket until November of that year and affected his speed. The injury was caused by overuse. At the time, he had 92 test wickets in 27 tests—46 in his first 18, and 46 in his last nine matches. There were some doubts about whether he would be able to play again and when he announced his retirement in November 2003, Srinath said that he thought his career was over when he was recovering from the rotator-cuff injury.

He returned from injury in 1998 and took 17 wickets in Test matches and 37 wickets in 19 ODIs at an average of 22.00—the best year of his career.

===Late career===
With a change of Indian captain in 2000, Srinath was given fewer overs than Anil Kumble in Test matches. He was primarily used in ODIs and Test matches played outside of India, taking 21 Test and 15 ODI wickets in 2000. He took nine wickets against Zimbabwe in Delhi, and received his last Test Player of the Match award that year.

Inactive for much of 2001 due to emerging bowlers such as Zaheer Khan and Ajit Agarkar, he played eight Test matches and 15 ODIs. His Test career ended in 2002. Although Srinath wanted to retire from ODI, at the request of Indian captain Sourav Ganguly he agreed to play until the World Cup. He participated in India&#x27;s tour of New Zealand in January a few weeks before the World Cup, taking 18 wickets in seven matches.

===Bowling===
Srinath was the second Indian bowler (after Kapil Dev) to take 200 wickets in Test cricket, with 236. Although some critics said that Srinath&#x27;s average and strike rate suffered as a result of bowling to India&#x27;s predominantly dry, spin-friendly wickets, his average at home was superior to his average abroad since he could reverse-swing the ball.

==Retirement==
Srinath toured England with the Lashings World XI team in summer 2005, and was a commentator for the India-England test series in 2006. In an interview, 1992 World Cup-winning Pakistan captain Imran Khan said that after watching Srinath bowl on Indian pitches he considered him the most underrated bowler in the world. Courtney Walsh recommended Srinath for county cricket when he was injured. Srinath is a familiar face to cricket viewers around the world as a commentator and ICC match referee. In 2010, he and former teammate Anil Kumble contested the Karnataka State Cricket Association elections. They won and Srinath, as secretary of the association, promotes young cricketers in Karnataka.

==Referee==
In April 2006, Srinath was selected as a match referee by the International Cricket Council and served during the 2007 World Cup. He has refereed in 35 test matches, 268 ODIs and 60 T20Is.

<doc id="492475" wikidata="Q528145" url="?curid=492475" title="Linebacker">
<text>Linebacker (LB) is a playing position in gridiron football. Linebackers are members of the defensive team, and typically line up three to five yards behind the line of scrimmage and the defensive linemen, playing closer to the line of scrimmage than the defensive backs (secondary).

As such, linebackers play a hybrid role and are often the most versatile players on the defensive side of the ball; they can be asked to play roles similar to either a defensive lineman (such as stopping the runner on a running play) or a defensive back (such as dropping back into pass coverage). How linebackers play their positions depends on the defensive alignment, the philosophy of the coaching staff, and the particular play the offense may call.

Linebackers are divided into middle linebackers, sometimes called inside linebackers, and outside linebackers. The middle linebacker, often called &quot;Mike&quot;, is frequently the &quot;quarterback of the defense&quot;. His central role on the field means he is in the best position to call defensive plays and direct shifts and changes based on what the offense is doing. Outside linebackers are often in a position to blitz, a defensive maneuver where the player rushes into the offensive backfield to disrupt a running play or sack the quarterback on passing plays. Besides &quot;Mike&quot;, other nicknames such as &quot;Sam&quot;, &quot;Will&quot;, or &quot;Jack&quot;, are commonly used to refer to various linebacking roles.

Historically, some of the most impactful defensive players, such as Pro Football Hall of Fame members Chuck Bednarik, Dick Butkus, Jack Lambert, Ray Lewis, Ray Nitschke, Mike Singletary, Brian Urlacher, and Lawrence Taylor, were linebackers.

==History==

Before the advent of the two-platoon system with separate units for offense and defense, the player who was the team&#x27;s center on offense was often, though not always, the team&#x27;s linebacker on defense. Hence, in contemporary football, one usually sees four defensive linemen to the offense&#x27;s five or more. Most sources claim coach Fielding H. Yost and center Germany Schulz of the Michigan invented the position. Schulz was Yost&#x27;s first linebacker in 1904 when he stood up from his usual position on the line. Yost was horrified at first, but came to see the wisdom in Schulz&#x27;s innovation. William Dunn of Penn State was another Western Conference linebacker soon after Schulz.

However, there are various historical claims tied to the linebacker position, including some before 1904. For example, Percy Given of Georgetown is another center with a claim to the title &quot;first linebacker,&quot; supposedly standing up behind the line well before Schulz in a game against Navy in 1902. Other sources have the first linebacker in the South as Frank Juhan, who played at Sewanee during 1908–1910.

In the East, Ernest Cozens of Penn was &quot;one of the first of the roving centers,&quot; another archaic term for the position, supposedly coined by Hank Ketcham of Yale. Walter E. Bachman of Lafayette was said to be &quot;the developer of the &#x27;roving center&#x27; concept&quot;. Edgar Garbisch of Army was credited with developing the &quot;roving center method&quot; of playing defensive football in 1921.

In professional football, Cal Hubbard is credited with pioneering the linebacker position. He starred as a tackle and end, playing off the line in a style similar to that of a modern linebacker.

==Types==
===Middle linebacker===

The middle or inside linebacker (MLB or ILB), sometimes called the &quot;Mike&quot; or &quot;Mac&quot;, is often referred to as the &quot;quarterback of the defense&quot;. Often it is the middle linebacker who receives the defensive play calls from the sideline and relays that play to the rest of the team, and in the NFL he is usually the defensive player with the electronic sideline communicator. A jack-of-all-trades, the middle linebacker can be asked to blitz (though they often blitz less than the outside linebacker), cover, spy the quarterback, or even have a deep middle-of-the-field responsibility in the Tampa 2 defense. In standard defenses, middle linebackers commonly lead the team in tackles. The terms &quot;middle&quot; and &quot;inside&quot; linebacker are often used interchangeably; they are also used to distinguish between a single middle linebacker playing in a 4–3 defense, and two inside linebackers playing in a 3–4 defense. In a 3–4 defense, the larger, more run-stopping-oriented linebacker is usually still called &quot;Mike&quot;, while the smaller, more pass protection/route coverage-oriented player is called &quot;Will&quot;. &quot;Mikes&quot; usually line up towards the strong side or on the side the offense is more likely to run on (based on personnel matchups) while &quot;Wills&quot; may line up on the other side or even a little further back between the defensive line and the secondary.

===Outside linebacker===
The outside linebacker (OLB), sometimes called the &quot;Buck, Sam, and Rebel&quot;, is usually responsible for outside containment. This includes the strongside and weakside designations below. They are also responsible for blitzing the quarterback. Not only is the OLB responsible for outside containment and blitzing the QB, but they also have to perform pass coverage in the flats – sometimes called a drop. Outside linebackers pass coverages covers quick slants outside, in curls in the flats. The &quot;flats&quot; are the edge of the field closest to the sideline, from the line of scrimmage down about ten yards. John Alexander is the first person to have played outside linebacker in the NFL.

====Strongside linebacker====
The strongside linebacker (SLB) is often nicknamed the &quot;Sam&quot; for purposes of calling a blitz. Since the strong side of the offensive team is the side on which the tight end lines up, or whichever side contains the most personnel, the strongside linebacker usually lines up across from the tight end. Often the strongside linebacker will be called upon to tackle the running back on a play because the back will be following the tight end&#x27;s block. He is most often the strongest linebacker; at the least he possesses the ability to withstand, shed, and fight off blocks from a tight end or fullback blocking the backside of a pass play. The linebacker should also have strong safety abilities in pass situation to cover the tight end in man on man situations. He should also have considerable quickness to read and get into coverage in zone situations.

====Weakside linebacker====
The weakside linebacker (WLB), or the &quot;Will&quot; in 4–3 defense, sometimes called the backside linebacker, or &quot;Buck&quot;, as well as other names like Jack or Bandit, must be the fastest of the three, because he is often the one called into pass coverage. He is also usually chasing the play from the backside, so the ability to maneuver through traffic is a necessity for the Will. The Will usually aligns off the line of scrimmage at the same depth as Mike. Because of his position on the weakside, the Will does not often have to face large interior linemen one on one unless one is pulling. In coverage, the Will often covers the back that attacks his side of the field first in man coverage, while covering the weak flat in Texas Loop or hooks/curl areas in zone coverage.

==Formations==

The number of linebackers is dependent upon the formation called for in the play; formations can call for as few as none, or as many as seven. Most defensive schemes call for three or four, which are generally named for the number of linemen, followed by the number of linebackers (with the 46 defense being an exception). For example, the 4–3 defense has four defensive linemen and three linebackers; conversely, the 3–4 defense has three linemen and four linebackers.

===4–3 defense===
In the 4–3 defense there are four down linemen and three linebackers. The middle linebacker is designated &quot;Mike&quot; (or &quot;Mac&quot;) and two outside linebackers are designated &quot;Sam&quot; and &quot;Will&quot; according to how they line up against the offensive formation. If there is a strong call, the linebacker on the strongside is called &quot;Sam&quot;, while the linebacker on the weakside is called &quot;Will&quot;. The outside linebacker&#x27;s job is to cover the end to make sure a run does not escape and to watch the pass and protect from it. The middle linebacker&#x27;s job is to stop runs between the tackles and watch the entire field to see the play develop. On pass plays, the linebackers&#x27; responsibilities vary based upon whether a man or zone coverage is called. In zone coverage, the linebackers will generally drop into across the middle of the field. However, some zones will send the outside linebackers into the flats (area directly to the left and right of the hash marks, extending 4–5 yards downfield). In a man-to-man call, the &quot;Sam&quot; will often cover the tight end with help from a safety over the top, while at other times, the &quot;Sam&quot; and &quot;Will&quot; will be responsible for the first man out of the backfield on their side of the center, with the &quot;Mike&quot; covering if a second man exits on that side of the field.

In the &quot;Tampa 2&quot; zone defense, the middle linebacker is required to drop quickly into a deep middle zone pass coverage thus requiring a quick player at this position.

===3–4 defense===

In the 3–4 defense three linemen play the line of scrimmage and four linebackers back them up, typically two outside linebackers and two inside linebackers. The weakside inside linebacker is typically called the &quot;Will&quot;, while the strong side or middle inside linebacker is called the &quot;Mike&quot;. &quot;Sam&quot; is a common designation for strong outside linebacker, while the other position is usually called &quot;Jack&quot; and is often a hybrid DE/LB. 

The idea behind the 3–4 defense is to disguise where the fourth rusher will come from. Instead of the standard four down-linemen in the 4–3, only three players are clearly attacking nearly every play. A key for running this defense successfully is having a defensive front of three large defensive linemen who command constant double teams. In particular, the nose tackle, who plays over the offensive center, must be able to hold ground and to occupy several offensive blockers to allow the linebackers to make plays. The focus of the 3–4 defensive line is to occupy offensive linemen thus freeing the linebackers to tackle the running back or to rush the passer or otherwise drop into pass coverage.

The primary responsibilities for both outside linebackers are typically to stop the run and rush the quarterback in passing situations, where they line in front of the tackles like true defensive ends. The outside linebackers in a 3–4 defense must be very skilled at rushing the quarterback, and would be playing defensive end in a 4–3 defense. Among inside linebackers, one is generally a run-stuffer who is better able to handle offensive linemen and stop running backs, while the other is often a smaller, faster player who excels in pass coverage. However, the smaller or cover LB should also be able to scrape and plug running lanes decently.

The design concept of the 3–4 defense is to confuse the offensive line in their blocking assignments, particularly in pass blocking, and to create a more complex read for the quarterback. Many 3–4 defenses have the ability to quickly morph into a 4–3 on the field.

===46 defense===
In the 46 defense, there are four linemen, three linebackers and a safety who is moved up behind the line of scrimmage. Thus, it appears as if there are four linebackers, but it is really three linebackers with one safety playing up with the other linebackers.

Three of the defensive linemen are over both of the offensive guards and the center, thereby making it difficult to double-team any one of the three interior defensive linemen. This can also take away the ability of the offense to pull the guards on a running play, because this would leave one of the defenders unblocked, or, at best, give another lineman a very difficult block to make on one of the defenders. The safety, like the linebacker, can blitz, play man-on-man, play zone, or drop back into deep coverage like a normal safety would do. The 46 is used in heavy run situations to stop the run, when a team wants to apply much pressure, or merely to confuse the quarterback and offensive line.

===4–4 defense===
This defense is effective at run-stopping but is weaker than a 4–3 defense at pass coverage because it uses only three defensive backs. This defensive scheme is often played with two inside line backers and two outside line backers. The names of the two inside line backers are often called Sam and Mike and these two are lined up about four yards from the line of scrimmage and are lined up with the offensive guard. The inside line backers are often more of a run player so they will defend the run before they will the pass. These line backers will be reading the offensive guard so they know what to do, so if the guard sets up to pass block the line backers know to get into their zone in order to cover the pass. If the guard come out for a run play they know that they need to fill the gap that they are supposed to so that they can make a play if it comes to them. Also, these inside line backers are often called on a blitz which is when no matter what the offense does, as soon as that ball is snapped they are shooting their gap and trying to get into the back field to make a play as fast as possible. Outside line backers sometimes are considered to be pass players before they are run players. But that depends on where they are lined up, if they are outside of the box of the defense then they will be pass first players, but if they play inside the box lined up behind the defensive end then they are typically a run player. One of the outside linebackers is usually called into either blitz or pass coverage to make up for the missing defensive back. In the NFL and college football, this alignment is used mainly in short yardage situations or near the goal line. It is commonly used in high school football.

<text>A wide receiver (WR), also referred to as a wideout, and historically known as a split end (SE) or flanker (FL), is an eligible receiver in gridiron football. A key skill position of the offense, WR gets its name from the player being split out &quot;wide&quot; (near the sidelines), farthest away from the rest of the offensive formation.

A forward pass-catching specialist, the wide receiver is one of the fastest players on the field alongside cornerbacks and running backs. One on either extreme of the offensive line is typical, but several may be employed on the same play.

Through 2022 only four wide receivers, Jerry Rice (in 1987 and 1993), Michael Thomas (in 2019), Cooper Kupp (in 2021), and Justin Jefferson (in 2022), have won Offensive Player of the Year. In every other year it was awarded to either a quarterback or running back. No wide receiver has ever won MVP. Jerry Rice is the leader in receptions, receiving yards, and touchdowns on the all-time list for receivers, along with being a 3-time SB champion and 10-time All-Pro selection.

== Role ==

The wide receiver&#x27;s principal role is to catch forward passes from the quarterback. On passing plays, the receiver attempts to avoid, outmaneuver, or simply outrun the cornerbacks or safeties typically defending them. If the receiver becomes open on their pass route, the quarterback may throw a pass to them. The receiver needs to successfully catch the ball without it touching the ground (known as a &quot;completion&quot;) and then run with the ball as far downfield as possible, hoping to reach the end zone to score a touchdown.

Especially fast receivers are typically perceived as &quot;deep threats&quot;, while those with good hands and perhaps shifty moves may be regarded as &quot;possession receivers&quot; prized for running crossing routes across the middle of the field, and converting third-down situations. Taller receivers with a height advantage over typically shorter defenders tend to play further to the outside and run deep more often, while shorter ones tend to play inside and run more routes underneath the top of the defense.

A wide receiver may block theirs or another&#x27;s defender, depending on the type of play being run. On standard running plays they will block their assigned defender for the running back. Particularly in the case of draws and other trick plays, they may run a pass route with the intent of drawing defenders away from the intended action. Well-rounded receivers are noted for skill in both roles; Hines Ward in particular received praise for his blocking abilities while also becoming the Pittsburgh Steelers&#x27; all-time leading receiver and one of 13 in NFL history through 2009 with at least 1,000 receptions.

Occasionally wide receivers are used to run the ball, usually in plays seeking to surprise the defense, as in an end-around or reverse. All-time NFL receiving yardage leader Jerry Rice also rushed the ball 87 times for 645 yards and 10 touchdowns in his 20 NFL seasons.

In even rarer cases, receivers may pass the ball as part of an outright trick play. Like a running back, a receiver may legally pass the ball so long as they receive it behind the line of scrimmage, in the form of a handoff or backward lateral. In Super Bowl XL, Antwaan Randle El, a four-year quarterback at Indiana University, threw a touchdown pass at the wide receiver position playing for the Pittsburgh Steelers against the Seattle Seahawks, the first wide receiver in Super Bowl history to do so, a feat later accomplished by Jauan Jennings in Super Bowl LVIII.

Wide receivers often also serve on special teams as kick or punt returners, as gunners on coverage teams, or as part of the hands team during onside kicks. Devin Hester, from the Chicago Bears, touted as one of the greatest kick and punt returners of all time, was listed as a wide receiver (after his first season, during which he was listed as a cornerback). Five-time All-Pro and ten-time Pro Bowl member Matthew Slater was a gunner for the New England Patriots who was likewise listed as a wide receiver, however he had only one reception in his career.

In the NFL, wide receivers use the numbers 0–49 and 80–89.

A &quot;route tree&quot; system typically used in high school and college employs numbers zero through nine, with zero being a &quot;go route&quot; and a nine being a &quot;hitch route&quot; or vice versa. In high school they are normally a part of the play call, but are usually disguised in higher levels of plays.

== History ==
The wide receiver grew out of a position known as the end. Originally, the ends played on the offensive line, immediately next to the tackles, in a position now referred to as the tight end. By the rules governing the forward pass, ends (positioned at the end of the line of scrimmage) and backs (positioned behind the line of scrimmage) are eligible receivers. Most early football teams used the ends sparingly as receivers, as their starting position next to the offensive tackles at the end of the offensive formation often left them in heavy traffic with many defenders around. By the 1930s, some teams were experimenting with spreading the field by moving one end far out near the sideline, drawing the defense away from running plays and leaving them more open on passing ones. These &quot;split ends&quot; became the prototype for what has evolved into being called today the wide receiver. Don Hutson, who played college football at Alabama and professionally with the Green Bay Packers, was the first player to exploit the potential of the split end position.

As the passing game evolved, a second de facto wide receiver was added by employing a running back in a pass-catching role rather than splitting out the &quot;blind-side&quot; end, who was typically retained as a blocker to protect the left side of right-handed quarterbacks. The end stayed at the end of the offensive line in what today is a tight end position, while the running back - who would line up a yard or so off the offensive line and some distance from the end in a &quot;flank&quot; position - became known as a &quot;flanker&quot;.

Lining up behind the line of scrimmage gave the flanker two principal advantages. First, a flanker has more &quot;space&quot; between themselves and their opposing defensive cornerback, who can not as easily &quot;jam&quot; them at the line of scrimmage; second, flankers are eligible for motion plays, which allow them to move laterally before and during the snap. Elroy &quot;Crazy Legs&quot; Hirsch is one of the earliest players to successfully exploit the potential of the flanker position as a member of the Los Angeles Rams during the 1950s.

While some teams did experiment with more than two wide receivers as a gimmick or trick play, most teams used the pro set (of a flanker, split end, half back, full back, tight end, and quarterback) as the standard group of ball-handling personnel. An early innovator, coach Sid Gillman used 3+ wide receiver sets as early as the 1960s. In sets that have three, four, or five wide receivers, extra receivers are typically called slot receivers, as they play in the &quot;slot&quot; (open space) between the furthest receiver and the offensive line, typically lining up off the line of scrimmage like a flanker.

The first use of a slot receiver is often credited to Al Davis, a Gillman assistant who took the concept with him as a coach of the 1960s Oakland Raiders. Other members of the Gillman coaching tree, including Don Coryell and John Madden, brought these progressive offensive ideas along with them into the 1970s and early 1980s, but it was not until the 1990s that teams began to reliably use three or more wide receivers, notably the &quot;run and shoot&quot; offense popularized by the Houston Cougars of the NCAA and the Houston Oilers of the NFL, and the &quot;K Gun&quot; offense used by the Buffalo Bills. Charlie Joiner, a member of the &quot;Air Coryell&quot; San Diego Chargers teams of the late 1970s and early 1980s, was the first &quot;slot receiver&quot; to be his team&#x27;s primary receiver.

Wide receivers generally hit their peak between the ages of 23 and 30, with about 80 percent of peak seasons falling within that range according to one study.

==Types==
The designation for a receiver separated from the main offensive formation varies depending on how far they are removed from it and whether they begin on or off the line of scrimmage. The three principal designations are &quot;wide receiver&quot;/&quot;split end&quot;, &quot;flanker&quot;, and &quot;slot back&quot;:

* &quot;Split end&quot; (X or SE): A receiver positioned farthest from center on their side of the field which takes their stance on the line of scrimmage, necessary to meet the rule requiring seven players to be lined up on it at the snap. In a punt formation, the split end is known as a gunner.
* &quot;Flanker/Flanker back&quot; (Z or FL or 6 back): Frequently the team&#x27;s featured receiver, the flanker lines up a yard or so behind the line of scrimmage, generally on the same side of the formation as a tight end. It is typically the farthest player from the center on its side of the field, and uses the initial buffer between their starting position off the line and a defender to avoid immediate &quot;jamming&quot; (legal defensive contact within five yards of the line of scrimmage). Being a member of the &quot;backfield&quot;, the flanker can go into lateral or backward motion before the snap to potentially position themselves for a changing role on the play or simply to confound a defense, and is usually the one to do so.
* &quot;Slotback&quot; or &quot;slot receiver&quot; (Y, SB or SR): A receiver lining up in the offensive back field, horizontally positioned between the offensive tackle and the split end or between the tight end and the flanker. Canadian and arena football allow a slotback to take a running start at the line; American football allows the slot receiver to move backward or laterally like a flanker, but not at the same time as any other member of the backfield. They are usually larger players as they need to make catches over the middle. In American football, slot receivers are typically used in flexbone or other triple option offenses, while Canadian football uses three of them in almost all formations (in addition to two split ends and a single running back).

=== Gameplay ===
Wide receivers line up on the offensive side of the ball, typically on the line of scrimmage, and are positioned on the periphery of the formation. They are often split out wide from the offensive line, hence the name &quot;wide&quot; receiver. The primary objective of a wide receiver is to catch passes from the quarterback and gain yardage.

Wide receivers must possess a combination of speed, agility, and hands to excel in their role. They must be able to quickly accelerate off the line of scrimmage, create separation from defenders, and make contested catches in traffic. Additionally, route-running is a critical skill for wide receivers, as they must effectively navigate the field and find open space to receive passes.

=== Player roles ===
Wide receivers are typically categorized into different roles based on their skill sets and playing styles. These roles include:

* &quot;Split end&quot;: Also known as &quot;X receiver,&quot; the split end lines up on the line of scrimmage on the opposite side of the tight end. They are often the primary deep threat in the offense, using their speed to stretch the field vertically.
* &quot;Flanker&quot;: The flanker, or &quot;Z receiver,&quot; lines up off the line of scrimmage, usually on the same side as the tight end. They are versatile players who can excel in various routes, including short and intermediate passes.
* &quot;Slot receiver&quot;: Slot receivers line up between the offensive line and the split end or flanker. They are often smaller and quicker than outside receivers, making them elusive targets in the passing game. Slot receivers are frequently targeted on short routes and are valuable in getting first downs.
* &quot;Blocking receiver&quot;: While catching passes is the primary responsibility of wide receivers, some are also proficient blockers. Blocking receivers excel at engaging defenders and creating running lanes for ball carriers. Their blocking prowess is especially valuable on running plays and screen passes.

=== Strategies ===
Wide receivers are involved in various offensive strategies designed to exploit mismatches and create scoring opportunities. Some common strategies include:

* &quot;Route combinations&quot;: Offensive coordinators design plays with multiple receivers running complementary routes to confuse defenses and create openings in coverage. These route combinations often involve receivers running short, intermediate, and deep routes to attack different areas of the field simultaneously.
* &quot;Screen passes&quot;: Screen passes involve the quarterback quickly delivering the ball to a receiver behind the line of scrimmage, with blockers in front of them. Wide receivers must use their agility and vision to navigate through traffic and pick up yardage after the catch.
* &quot;Play-action&quot;: Play-action plays involve the quarterback faking a handoff to a running back before throwing the ball downfield. Wide receivers play a crucial role in selling the play-fake by running convincing routes and drawing defenders away from the intended target.
* &quot;Red zone targets&quot;: In the red zone, the area inside the opponent&#x27;s 20-yard line, wide receivers become prime targets for scoring touchdowns. Their ability to win contested catches and find openings in the defense is invaluable in tight spaces near the end zone.

=== Notable players ===

<doc id="492477" wikidata="Q2259248" url="?curid=492477" title="Welcome to the Cruel World">
<text>Welcome to the Cruel World is the debut album by the American musician Ben Harper, released in 1994 through Virgin Records. The album established Harper as a popular folk musician in the California area. After the release, Harper went on to add a permanent backing band, the Innocent Criminals, although they remained unnamed until the &quot;Burn to Shine&quot; album. The song &quot;I&#x27;ll Rise&quot; is based on a 1978 Maya Angelou poem &quot;And Still I Rise&quot;.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Indianapolis Star&quot; wrote that &quot;Harper impresses with his play of guitar and dobro, but it&#x27;s his mastery of the Weissenborn ... and his vocal nuances that persuade the listener to heed these vignettes of cold truth, the essence of blues.&quot;

<doc id="492481" wikidata="Q1153176" url="?curid=492481" title="Tight end">
<text>The tight end (TE) is an offensive position in American football, arena football, and Canadian football. It is a hybrid that combines the characteristics and roles of both an offensive lineman and a receiver. As part of the receiver corps, they play inside the flanks (tight), contrasted with the split end who plays outside the flanks (wide). Like offensive linemen, they are usually lined up on the offensive line and are large enough to be effective blockers. On the other hand, unlike offensive linemen, they are eligible receivers and potent weapons in a team&#x27;s offensive schemes.

The tight end&#x27;s role in any given offense depends on the preferences and philosophy of the head coach, offensive coordinator, and overall team dynamic. In some systems, the tight end will merely act as a sixth offensive lineman, rarely going out for passes. Other systems use the tight end primarily as a receiver, frequently taking advantage of the tight end&#x27;s size to create mismatches in the defensive secondary. Many coaches will often have one tight end who specializes in blocking on running plays while using a tight end with better pass-catching skills in passing situations.

Offensive formations may have as few as zero or as many as three tight ends at one time.

NFL tight ends in 2024 make an average of $8 million per year; some of the top tight ends make around $17 million per year. This position is amongst the lowest paid in the NFL.

==History==
===Origins===

The advent of the tight end position is closely tied to the decline of the one-platoon system during the 1940s and &#x27;50s. Originally, substitutions were limited by rule, forcing players to be adept on both sides of the ball, with most offensive linemen doubling as defensive linemen or linebackers, and running backs and receivers doubling as defensive backs.

With the relaxation of substitution rules in professional football from the 1940s and after 1964 in the college game, a two-platoon system of offense and defense became the norm, with most players active on only one side of the ball. With the advent of the T-formation, double halfback sets quickly became a thing of the past, with a hybrid running back–receiver known as the &quot;flanker back&quot; positioned outside The halfback and fullback, &quot;flanking&quot; them. The receivers on each end of the line of scrimmage retained their historic name, &quot;ends&quot;.

By the start of the 1960s many pro clubs had begun to position the flanker back far to the outside, just behind the line of scrimmage, part of what Washington Redskins coach Bill McPeak characterized as a &quot;three ends&quot; system. The receiver spread out on numerically inferior &quot;weak&quot; side of the formation was commonly known as the &quot;split end&quot;; the end lining up to the same side as the flanker, positioned close to the blocking linemen, became known as the &quot;tight end&quot;. This tight end position, developed in the 1950s, embraced both blocking and receiving functions and flourished as part of the specialization of the two-platoon era.

Greater use of the tight end as a receiver in the cutting edge offenses of the 1960s led to the emergence of the first stars at the position, including Mike Ditka of the Chicago Bears, Jackie Smith of the St. Louis Cardinals, and John Mackey of the Baltimore Colts.

===The modern position===
Even with the emergence of star tight ends as receivers, the rush-heavy offenses of the 1960s through the early 1980s NFL saw tight ends continue to remain primarily blockers lined up next to an offensive tackle and given short to medium drag routes. Starting in 1980, the Air Coryell offense began using tight end Kellen Winslow in wide receiver-type routes. Winslow was lined up wide, in the slot against a smaller cornerback, or put in motion to avoid being jammed at the line. Defenses would cover him with either a strong safety or a linebacker, because zone defenses were less popular. Strong safeties in those times also were favored for their run defense over coverage speed. Providing them another defender to help cover Winslow opened up holes for other receivers. Winslow would line up unpredictably in any formation, variously in a three point blocking stance, two point receiver&#x27;s stance, or put in motion like a flanker or offensive back. 2000s Head coach Jon Gruden referred to such multi-dimensional tight ends as &quot;jokers&quot;, calling Winslow the first ever in the NFL. Patriots head coach Bill Belichick notes that the pass-catching tight ends that get paid the most are &quot;all direct descendants of Kellen Winslow&quot;, and there are fewer tight ends now that can block on the line.

In the 1990s, Shannon Sharpe&#x27;s athletic prowess as a route-runner helped change the way tight ends were used by teams. Consistently double-covered as a receiver, he became the first tight end in NFL history to rack up over 10,000 career receiving yards. Tony Gonzalez and Antonio Gates, who both played basketball in college, pushed the position toward wide receiver speed and power forward strength and wingspan. At 6&#x27;6&quot; Rob Gronkowski brought height, setting single-season tight end records in 2011 with 17 touchdowns—breaking Gates&#x27;s and Vernon Davis&#x27;s record of 13—and 1,327 receiving yards, surpassing Winslow&#x27;s record of 1,290. Jimmy Graham that season also passed Winslow with 1,310 yards. Six of the NFL&#x27;s 15 players with the most receptions that year were tight ends, the most in NFL history. Previous seasons usually had at most one or two ranked in the top.

Tight ends generally hit their peak between the ages of 25 and 30.

===Tight ends in other leagues===
In the Arena Football League the tight end serves as the 3rd offensive lineman (along with the center and guard). Although they are eligible receivers they rarely go out for passes and are usually only used for screen passes when they do.

However, in Canadian football, tight ends are, in general, no longer used professionally in the CFL, but are still used at the college level in U Sports. Tony Gabriel is a former tight end in Canadian football. There remain some tight ends in use at university level football; Antony Auclair, formerly a tight end for the Laval Rouge et Or, was a contender to be selected in the 2017 CFL Draft or possibly receive a tryout in the NFL. He was drafted by the CFL&#x27;s Saskatchewan Roughriders in 2017, but instead signed with the NFL&#x27;s Tampa Bay Buccaneers as an undrafted free agent that same year.

===National Tight Ends Day===
Since 2019, the NFL celebrates National Tight Ends Day on the fourth weekend of October to highlight tight ends in the league.

==Roles==
Tight ends have two primary roles: (1) act as a blocker and (2) act as a receiver. Very occasionally, a tight end is also given the opportunity to rush with the ball. This typically happens when they are put in motion before the ball is snapped.

===Blocking===
In the National Football League (NFL), the tight end is larger, stronger, and slower than a wide receiver, and therefore able to block more effectively. Among offensive ball-handlers, it is the job of the tight end, along with the fullback, to block for both running backs and receivers. Tight ends are used as blockers to protect the quarterback during passing plays, to open holes in the line, and downfield to tie up linebackers and defensive backs.

Historically, a single tight end was used, typically placed on the right side of the offensive line. In the early 2000s, two tight end formations began to be used with more frequency. Specialty plays may deploy 3- or 4-tight-end sets in &quot;heavy&quot; or &quot;jumbo&quot; packages, usually to block in short-yardage situations or to sow confusion in the defensive backfield with such an unusual formation. When a blocker larger than a tight end is desired without sacrificing the player&#x27;s ability to catch a pass the position is sometimes filled by an offensive lineman who reports to the referee that he is an eligible receiver, referred to colloquially as a &quot;tackle eligible&quot;.

===Receiving===
Historically, the primary role of a tight end was blocking, with strategic use as a receiver. Over time the emphasis of offense has shifted from running to passing, and with it the role of the tight end as a receiver expanded. The tight end is usually faster than the linebackers who cover him and often stronger than the cornerbacks and safeties who try to tackle him. In general, there is an inherent trade-off between a tight end&#x27;s speed and agility and their size, meaning more mobile tight ends tend not to be as effective as blockers. This results in great premiums being placed on tight ends who can fill both roles effectively. When a team cannot find both in a single player they often rotate between those who are stronger in one role better than the other depending on the type of skill required by given plays.

At the extreme end the receiving spectrum are &#x27;hybrid&#x27; tight ends that are drafted primarily for their pass-catching abilities. Often, these players have near-wide receiver speed, coupled with greater overall size and strength. Plays utilizing their assets are designed to capitalize on their combination of size, speed, and wingspan, at times spreading them out on the line like wide-receivers, off the line in the slot, or putting them in motion in the backfield.

===Rushing===
The decline of the fullback as a rushing position has seen the occasional deployment of tight ends as ball carriers, either aligned in the backfield or out of the slot in a reverse or sweep.

== Physical attributes==
Most tight ends are large in size, with an average height of and a weight exceeding . They are usually among the taller members of the team, comparable in height to many linemen. Tight ends need to have this combination of physical attributes because they can be called upon to block linebackers and defensive linemen, as well as run routes and catch passes from the quarterback while outrunning defensive backs. They are also among teams’ heavier players, with only linemen and some linebackers weighing more than averaged-sized tight ends. Because of their larger size, tight ends are almost universally slower than wide receivers and running backs, although occasionally one with exceptional speed appears; an example of a tight end with a speed advantage—at the expense of blocking ability—is Vernon Davis, who achieved a 4.38 forty yard dash time.

== Jersey numbers ==

In American football, specific skill positions typically are issued jersey numbers in a restricted range. High school rules nationally are determined by the National Federation of State High School Associations; tight ends are able to wear any number other than 50–79. The NCAA &quot;strongly recommends&quot; ends wear 80–99, but this is not required. In the NFL, numbering has changed in 2021, which allows them to wear numbers 0-49 and 80–89. The 0–49 number range is a relatively recent addition to the rules; as a result, most tight ends still bear numbers in the 80–89 range.

<doc id="492488" wikidata="Q83905" url="?curid=492488" title="Hicham El Guerrouj">
<text>Hicham El Guerrouj (; ; born 14 September 1974) is a retired Moroccan middle-distance runner. El Guerrouj is the current world record holder for the 1500 metres and mile, and the former world record holder in the 2000 metres. He is the only man since Paavo Nurmi to win a gold medal in both the 1500 m and 5000 metres at the same Olympic Games.

El Guerrouj is widely regarded as the greatest middle-distance runner in history and, as of October 2024, still holds six of the 10 fastest times ever run in the 1500 m as well as seven of the 15 fastest times in the mile. He and Jakob Ingebrigtsen are the only men in history to have broken both 3:27 in the 1500 m and 3:44 in the mile. El Guerrouj remains the only man in history to have broken 3:27 in the 1500 m more than once, having done so five times.

He won a gold medal in the 1500 m at the 1997, 1999, 2001, and 2003 World Athletics Championships. He won the World Athlete of the Year award three times, and in November 2014, was inducted into the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) Hall of Fame.

==Early life &amp; career==
Born in Berkane, Hicham El Guerrouj comes from a family of farmers. He initially pursued soccer and basketball in his sporting endeavors, but his spark in the sport of athletics came at the age of 13, when a local coach recognized his talent and encouraged him to pursue the sport. According to El Guerrouj, his urban upbringing and close proximity to a sports stadium allowed him to watch athletics competitions often, fueling his passion for running.

El Guerrouj&#x27;s first international triumph was at age 18, when he came third in the 5000 metres of the 1992 Junior World Championships in Seoul, behind Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia and Ismael Kirui of Kenya. A year later, he was the #2 man on the Moroccan team at the World Junior Cross Country Championships.

In 1994, he was a member of the Moroccan team in the 1994 IAAF World Road Relay Championships, which won the race in world record time.

El Guerrouj rose to international prominence in the mid-1990s with near-record times in the 1500 metres and mile. At the age of 20 he finished second in the 1500 metres to then world record holder Noureddine Morceli at the 1995 World Championships in Gothenburg. In 1996 after setting a new personal best in the 1500 metres of 3:29.59 in Stockholm, he was considered one of the favourites for the Olympic gold.

==1996 Atlanta Olympics – 1999 season==
El Guerrouj competed in his first Olympic Games in 1996 at Atlanta. Running the 1500 metres final, as he was moving into position to challenge for the lead, he fell with 400 m to go and finished last in 12th place. He had been expected to challenge the world record holder and three-time World champion, Noureddine Morceli.

One month later, at the Grand Prix final in Milan, El Guerrouj became the first runner to defeat Morceli over 1500 m in four years. In the following years, El Guerrouj became the only middle distance runner to win four consecutive world titles in 1997, 1999, 2001, and 2003.

El Guerrouj set two world indoor records at the start of the 1997 season, starting with a 1500 m record of 3:31.18 at the Sparkassen Cup, which was not beaten until 22 years later, in 2019 by Samuel Tefera. He also set a new indoor world record of 3:48.45 in the mile run at the Indoor Flanders meeting a few weeks later, which stood until Yomif Kejelcha bettered the mark in 2019.

In 1998 in Rome, El Guerrouj broke Morceli&#x27;s 1500 m world record (3:27.37) with a time of 3:26.00. With an average pace of 54.93 seconds per lap, this record still stands today, and is the first performance in the 1500 m where the pace averaged under 55 seconds per lap.

In 1999, also in Rome, El Guerrouj broke the world record in the mile set by Morceli in 1993, with a time of 3:43.13, completing the first 1500 metres in 3:28.21. Noah Ngeny of Kenya, who ran second, was also under the previous world record with a time of 3:43.40, which remains the second place world record to this day. This was the first time in over 40 years that two men had bettered the mile world record in the same race, neither of which have been broken in a quarter of a century.

Later that season he set a new world record over 2000 m in Berlin at 4:44.79, bettering the previous mark set by Morceli by more than three seconds, that has since been broken by Jakob Ingebrigtsen, who ran 4:43.13 in 2023. In 1999 El Guerrouj also ran what was then the second fastest 3000 m ever in Brussels, with a time of 7:23.09.

==2000 Sydney Olympics – 2003 season==
At the Sydney Olympics, El Guerrouj was favourite to take gold but finished second in the 1500 metres, behind Noah Ngeny, a talented Kenyan runner at the peak of his career who had run as El Guerrouj&#x27;s pacemaker when El Guerrouj ran his 1500m world record in Rome in 1998.

El Guerrouj successfully defended his 1500 m title in the 2001 and 2003 World Championships and came close to breaking his own 1500 m record in Brussels in 2001 with a time of 3:26.12. He also won 3 consecutive IAAF Golden League prizes in 2001, 2002 and 2003. He was the only middle distance athlete to produce the winning streak necessary to be entitled for a share of the jackpot of 50 kilograms (1,608 troy ounces) of gold (2000–2002) or US$1 million (1998–1999, 2003–present). As of 2011 he was the only athlete to have won it three times in a row.

In 2003, El Guerrouj set a personal best of 12:50.24 in the 5000 metres, which is the 26th fastest ever in the event. Later in the year, at the World Track &amp; Field Championships, he finished a close second to Kenyan Eliud Kipchoge in the 5000 metres, adding a silver to the gold he had previously won in the 1500 metres.

==2004 Athens Olympics and retirement==

After a relatively poor start to the 2004 season that included slow times and an 8th-place finish in a 1500-metre race in Rome, El Guerrouj entered both the 1500 metres and the 5000 metres at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece.

Only 20 days before the Olympic final, 2000 Olympic bronze medalist Bernard Lagat ran the fastest 1500 m in 2004 (3:27.40), narrowly defeating El Guerrouj (3:27.64) at the Weltklasse Zürich meet on August 6. On August 24, in the final straight of the Olympic 1500m final, El Guerrouj beat Lagat by 0.12 seconds, winning the gold medal. In the finale, entering the home straight El Guerrouj led, only to be overtaken by Lagat- and then El Guerrouj re-took the lead a few strides from the line.

Four days later, El Guerrouj won the 5,000 m final with a time of 13:14.39, preventing Kenenisa Bekele from achieving the 5000 m/10000 m distance double, last achieved by Ethiopian Miruts Yifter in 1980 Moscow Olympics.

El Guerrouj became the first man in 80 years to win both 1500m and 5000m titles in the same Olympics, previously achieved only by the &quot;Flying Finn&quot; Paavo Nurmi in 1924.

On 16 May 2005, El Guerrouj was nominated for the Laureus World Sports Award for Sportsman of the Year.

Having fulfilled his sporting ambitions &amp; due to injuries from his years of high intensity training, El Guerrouj never competed internationally again after the 2004 Olympics and announced his retirement on May 22, 2006.

==Awards and honors==
His sporting career is marked by numerous recognitions such as the award for humanitarian effort from the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), which he received in 1996. He is also a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. El Guerrouj was named IAAF World Athlete of the Year in 2001, 2002 and 2003 after remaining unbeaten in more than 20 races, becoming the first man to win the award in consecutive years. He was also named best athlete of the year by the athletics journal &quot;Track and Field News&quot; in 2002. In 2003, he was elected as a member of the IAAF Athletes Committee.

On September 7, 2004, El Guerrouj was decorated with the &quot;Cordon de Commandeur&quot; by King Mohammed VI of Morocco. In the same year, he was awarded the Prince of Asturias Awards.

He was a member of the International Olympic Committee Athletes&#x27; Commission from 2004 to 2012.

Hicham El Guerrouj is today an Ambassador for Peace and Sport, a Monaco-based international organization, as well as a member of its &quot;Champions for Peace&quot; club, a group of 54 famous elite athletes committed to serving peace in the world through sport.

== Personal life ==
During the 1996 Summer Olympics, after his devastating fall in the 1500 metres final, El Guerrouj received a call from King Hassan II, then the King of Morocco. Hassan II said to El Guerrouj:

In response to this call, El Guerrouj later reflected:

On 27 September 2003, El Guerrouj married Najoua Lahbil. They have a daughter named Hiba. 

El Guerrouj is an admirer of Roger Bannister, whom he considers to be his &quot;spiritual father&quot;. El Guerrouj met Bannister in 2000, and attended a 70 year anniversary event of Bannister&#x27;s first sub-four minute mile on 6 May 2024 in Oxford, England. In 2019, he also attended the World Athletics Heritage Mile Night in Monaco, which was organized by Sebastian Coe.

In 2024, reflecting on the differences between the mile and 1500 metres, El Guerrouj stated the following:

El Guerrouj attended the opening ceremony of the 2024 Summer Olympics, and was also a torchbearer. He also attended the 2024 Wanda Diamond League Final in Brussels on 13 September, where he greeted Jakob Ingebrigtsen at the finish line of the 1500 m.

<text>Natalie Schafer (November 5, 1900 – April 10, 1991) was an American actress, best known today for her role as Lovey Howell on the sitcom &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; (1964–1967).

== Early life and career ==

Natalie Schafer was born on November 5, 1900, in Red Bank, New Jersey. the eldest of the three children of Jennie (née Tim; family name originally &quot;Tein&quot;) and Charles Emanual Schafer, both of German-Jewish descent.

Schafer began her career as an actress on Broadway before moving to Los Angeles in 1941 to work in films. She appeared on Broadway in 17 plays between 1927 and 1959, often playing supporting roles. Most of those appearances were in short-run plays, with the exceptions of &quot;Lady in the Dark&quot; (1941–42), &quot;The Doughgirls&quot; (1942–44), and &quot;Romanoff and Juliet&quot; (1957–58). She was seen in a revival of &quot;Six Characters in Search of an Author&quot;, directed by Sir Tyrone Guthrie (1955–56). She also appeared in stock and regional productions, including the off-Broadway production &quot;The Killing of Sister George&quot; with Claire Trevor in the title role. She also guest-starred in TV productions beginning in the 1950s, such as an episode (“The Shy Ballerina”) of &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, and in &quot;The Charm School&quot; episode of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, both in 1954.

Schafer performed in many films, usually portraying sophisticates. On TV, her roles included &quot;Lovey Howell&quot; on &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; from 1964–67. She reprised her role in three made-for-television spin-off films after the show ended: &quot;Rescue from Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; (1978), &quot;The Castaways on Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; (1979), and &quot;The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; (1981). She also voiced Lovey Howell on the animated spinoffs, &quot;The New Adventures of Gilligan&quot; from 1974–77 and &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Planet&quot; from 1982–83.

In 1969, Schafer appeared in &quot;The Survivors&quot;—a high-profile prime time soap opera aired by the ABC television network. Despite the presence of movie stars like Lana Turner, Kevin McCarthy and George Hamilton, the show was a ratings failure and lasted only one season. For the 1971–1972 television season, Schafer joined the cast of the CBS daytime serial, &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot;, portraying Helen Collins, mother of Wade and Clay Collins. Immediately following that role, she played Augusta Roulland on another daytime soap, &quot;Love of Life&quot;. Her final performance was in the 1990 made-for-television horror film &quot;I&#x27;m Dangerous Tonight&quot;.

She guest-starred as well on many other television series, including &quot;Goodyear Playhouse&quot;/&quot;Philco Playhouse&quot; (&quot;The Sisters&quot;, with Grace Kelly, 1951), &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; (1954), &quot;Producers&#x27; Showcase&quot; (&quot;The Petrified Forest&quot;, 1955), &quot;Guestward, Ho!&quot; (1960), &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; (1964), &quot;Mayberry RFD&quot; (1970), &quot;Mannix&quot; (1972), &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; (1974), &quot;Phyllis&quot; (1976), &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; (1978), and &quot;The Love Boat&quot; (1979).

==Personal life==

Schafer was married to actor Louis Calhern from 1933 to 1942; they had no children. Schafer and Calhern appeared together in the 1956 film &quot;Forever, Darling&quot;.

Schafer was secretive about her age. She reportedly never revealed her true year of birth to her husband during their marriage. For many years, her birth year was generally given as 1912. Few people believed this; yet her actual year of birth of 1900 (which was not discovered until after her death) surprised even her intimate friends. She was reportedly also a breast cancer survivor, which she withheld from her fans and friends.

At the time of her death, a family spokesman stated that Schafer&#x27;s survivors included her longtime companion Maurice Hill.

==Death==
Schafer died of liver cancer in her Beverly Hills home at the age of 90. She was cremated; her ashes were scattered into the Pacific Ocean, off San Pedro&#x27;s Point Fermin Light. She bequeathed between $1.5 million and $2 million to the Lillian Booth Actors Home to renovate the hospital&#x27;s outpatient wing, which was renamed the Natalie Schafer Wing in 1993.

<text>Noureddine Morceli (, &quot;Nūr ud-Dīn Mursilī&quot;; born February 28, 1970) is a retired Algerian middle-distance runner. The winner of the 1500 metres at the 1996 Summer Olympics, Morceli won three straight gold medals at that distance at the World Championships in Athletics. He set world records in the 1500 m, mile, 2000m, and 3000 metres. One time during his career, he held 6 world records at the same time.

In international competition, Morceli was twice the gold medallist in the mile at the Goodwill Games (1994 and 1998), the Arab champion in the 1500 m in 1988, the Millrose Games champion in the mile in 1992 and 1993, the 1500 m winner at the 1994 IAAF World Cup, and the overall champion in the 1994 IAAF Grand Prix series. He was Algerian national champion in the 1500 m in 1989.

==Biography==
At age seven Morceli was inspired by his brother Abderrahmane, a world-class runner who finished fourth in the 1,500 metres in the 1977 World Cup; later his brother would become Morceli&#x27;s coach. In the early 1980s, Morceli came to idolize Saïd Aouita, a Moroccan who won the gold medal in the 5,000 metres in the 1984 Olympic Games. By age 17 Morceli had taken second place in the 1,500 metres in the world junior championships. A year later, he enrolled at Riverside Community College in California, which had been recommended for its coaching and track facilities. He spent two years there, at the end of which he had run the world&#x27;s fastest 1,500 metres for 1990. At age 20 he was ranked first in the world in the 1,500 metres. In 1992 he added to his accomplishments the outdoor world record for the 1,500 metres, in 1993 for the mile, and in 1994 for the 3,000 metres. By the end of 1994, the Algerian track star&#x27;s accomplishments had reached even greater proportions. In August, after breaking the outdoor world record for 3,000 metres (7 min 25.11 sec), he could claim five middle-distance world records, which also included (outdoor) the 1,500 metres (3 min 28.86 sec) and the mile (3 min 44.39 sec) and (indoor) the 1,000 metres (2 min 15.26 sec) and the 1,500 metres (3 min 34.16 sec).

Morceli was named Athlete of the Year by Track &amp; Field News in 1993 and 1994 and by the International Athletic Foundation in 1994. In that two-year period, he lost only once, at 800 metres. As he set his sights on more records, most notably the 800-metre, 2,000-metre, and 5,000-metre events, his driving force was a deeply rooted dedication to bring glory to his country. As Morceli looked forward to the 1995 season, sportswriters unabashedly proclaimed him the greatest runner in the world or even the greatest of all time. Perhaps his spirit was best exemplified by his winning performance in the 1994 Grand Prix. Racked with flu, weakened and hacking, he not only ran but left the field behind at the finish. Morceli was soon tested by a new challenger, Moroccan Hicham El Guerrouj. Morceli bested El Guerrouj in the 1,500 metres at the 1995 outdoor world championships; however, the 1,500-metre race at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta the following year was considered one of the most dramatic contests in athletics history. Morceli and El Guerrouj led the field with 400 metres to go when the young Moroccan tripped on his rival&#x27;s heel and fell to the ground, allowing Morceli to capture the gold medal in that event. At the Grand Prix final in Milan later that year, however, Morceli lost the 1,500-metre event for the first time in years—to El Guerrouj. Morceli competed in subsequent events, including the 2000 Games in Sydney, before his eventual retirement.

==Career==
===Early career===

Born in Ténès, Morceli rose to athletic prominence after winning the silver medal in the 1500 m at the World Junior Championships in 1988. Morceli attended Riverside Community College in Riverside, California, and throughout his career, in winter, he would return there to enjoy the mild climate and train.

Morceli was coached by his brother Abderrahmane who ran for Algeria in the Moscow Olympics of 1980 and in Los Angeles in 1984.

===1990–1992===
In 1990, he moved up to senior class and set the season&#x27;s best mark of 3:37.87 in 1500 m. He continued this dominance into 1991, when he broke the world indoor record for 1500 m at Seville on February 28, setting a new mark of 3:34.16. Only nine days later, on the same track, he won the 1500 m title at the World Indoor Championships. Throughout the outdoor season 1991 Morceli remained undefeated over 1500 m. At several Grand Prix meetings he ran times around 3:31 min. At the World Championships in Tokyo, Morceli was already a clear favourite for the 1500 m and he won easily. He set a new World Championships record (3:32.84) and finished with a remarkable two-second-lead between him and the silver medallist Wilfred Kirochi (Kenya).

In the beginning of 1992, Morceli ran a new 1000 m indoor world record of 2:15.26. There seemed to be no greater certainty for a gold medal at the Olympic Games in Barcelona later that year than Morceli. But prior to the Olympic Games Morceli lost unexpectedly to Gennaro di Napoli in Rome and David Kibet in Oslo. There were signs that he was not in the same shape as the year before. However, in the Olympic semi-final he looked strong. The Olympic final was run at a woefully slow pace, with the field passing through the 800 m mark in a slower time than in the women&#x27;s final. That was not the sort of pace to which Morceli had become accustomed, or that he was comfortable with, and when the frantic sprint for home began, he found himself unable to respond, eventually finishing a disappointing seventh. Only three days after the final Morceli set a world season&#x27;s best in Monaco and a week later he broke his personal best to win in Zurich in 3:30.76. In September 1992 Morceli set a new 1500 m world record of 3:28.86 in Rieti.

===1993–1995===

In 1993 Morceli narrowly missed his own world record when he won the Mediterranean Games in Narbonne in 3:29.20 min. By that time Morceli had set himself a new aim: to break Steve Cram&#x27;s eight-year-old record over the Mile (3:46.32). Throughout the season he was virtually without any serious competitors. In Monaco he narrowly missed the 3000 m world record. There was even talk that he might skip the World Championships in order to concentrate fully on the world-record hunt. However, in the end he decided to take part. At the World Championships in Stuttgart, the final of 1500 m started at a relatively slow pace, but Morceli was always in complete control, sprinting away in the last lap to win easily and retain his world title. In the following weeks he failed twice to set a new world record over the Mile in Berlin and Brussels. But just two days after the race in Brussels he astonished everyone by crushing the old record with a time of 3:44.39, the first mile ran at 16 mph.

In 1994, he set the new 3000 m world record, clocking 7:25.11. He also experimented successfully with the 5000 m. In Zurich he outsprinted the rest of the field to take the victory (51.93 seconds last lap) and also won the 5000 m race in Rieti. The only defeat of the season came when Morceli opted for an unusual 800 m appearance in Cologne. Morceli broke the 2000 m world record in the following season, setting a new mark of 4:47.88. Nine days later Morceli set the last world record of his magnificent career, when he lowered his own 1500 m record to 3:27.37 in Nice. Only a few days after this he almost broke the record again when he triumphed in 3:27.52 in Monaco. Later on that year he defended easily the 1500 m World Champion title in Gothenburg. Shortly after, Morceli tried to improve on his Mile record in Zurich but did not succeed.

===1996–2000===
At the start of the 1996 season, Morceli set a world season&#x27;s best of 3:29.50. However, a new and serious opponent suddenly appeared on the scene, when Hicham El Guerrouj won in Stockholm in a time of 3:29.59. At the 1996 Summer Olympics, Morceli was under enormous pressure. The final was run at an average pace when his main rival, Hicham El Guerrouj, fell down on the final lap. Morceli accelerated and crossed the line first ahead of the defending Olympic champion, Fermín Cacho. At the end of 1996 Morceli suffered his first 1500 m defeat in four years at the hands of El Guerrouj in Milan. In the 1997 World Championships at Athens, Morceli was fourth in 1500 m and in 1999, at Seville, he qualified for his fifth straight 1500 m final at a World Championships, where he dropped out at the bell while well out of medal contention. Morceli&#x27;s last appearance at a major international championships was at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney.

===Since retirement===

Currently, Morceli serves as an ambassador of the sport by assisting with the International Olympic Commission, the African Games, as well as assisting the development of young track and field athletes in Algeria.

In January 2020, he was appointed Secretary of State for Elite Sport (reporting to Minister of Youth and Sports) in the new government chosen by Algerian president Abdelmadjid Tebboune after the presidential election of December 2019. Morceli was replaced by Judo champion Salima Souakri in June 2020 following a government change. Morceli has no political affiliation to any party in Algeria and was chosen as an independent member in the first Djerad government.

<text>Burn to Shine is an album by Ben Harper and the Innocent Criminals, released in 1999 on Virgin Records America. Harper&#x27;s fourth album, it shows him working within many different genres, including blues, rock, soul, and folk. The songs &quot;Steal My Kisses&quot; and &quot;Suzie Blue&quot; became successful on college radio. Like most other Harper albums, different versions were released in different regions within varying bonus material.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that &quot;while the songs are seldom as interesting as the album&#x27;s textured instrumental weave, Harper deserves credit for trying to break free of the cliches that have a stranglehold on the blues.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; considered the album to be &quot;mostly made up of leaden rootsy excursions.&quot; The &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; wrote that the album tackled &quot;an overload of musical niches.&quot; &quot;Trouser Press&quot; called Harper &quot;a thinking man&#x27;s Lenny Kravitz&quot;.

<text>Passive matrix addressing is an addressing scheme used in early liquid crystal displays (LCDs). It is a matrix addressing scheme, meaning that only &quot;m&quot; + &quot;n&quot; control signals are required to address an &quot;m&quot; × &quot;n&quot; display. A pixel in a passive matrix must maintain its state without active driving circuitry until it can be refreshed again.

The is divided into a row or &quot;select signal&quot; and a column or &quot;video signal&quot;. The select voltage determines the row that is being addressed and all &quot;n&quot; pixels on a row are addressed simultaneously. When pixels on a row are being addressed, a &quot;Vsel&quot; potential is applied, and all other rows are unselected with a &quot;Vunsel&quot; potential. The video signal or column potential is then applied with a potential for each &quot;m&quot; columns individually. An on-switched (lit) pixel corresponds to a &quot;Von&quot;, an off-switched (unlit) corresponds to a &quot;Voff&quot; potential.

The potential across pixel at selected row &quot;i&quot; and column &quot;j&quot; is
:formula_1
and
:formula_2
for the unselected rows.

This scheme has been expanded to define the limits of this type of addressing typical LCDs.

Passive matrix addressed displays, such as ferroelectric liquid crystal displays, do not need the switch component of an active matrix display, because they have built-in bistability. Technology for electronic paper also has a form of bistability. Displays with bistable pixel elements are addressed with a passive matrix addressing scheme, whereas TFT LCD displays are addressed using active addressing.

<text>Diamonds On the Inside is the fifth album by American singer-songwriter Ben Harper, released in 2003. Although he did not explicitly credit the Innocent Criminals for the first time in 10 years, all the touring members continue to support him on the album. On this album, Harper brought on several new additions to his band, the first being guitarist Nicky Panicci (a.k.a. Nicky P) in 2002 who is the first guitar player to be credited on a Ben Harper record. Panicci toured with Harper on the Diamonds on the Inside Tour for almost a year. After leaving Harper&#x27;s band on his own accord, Marc Ford, formerly of The Black Crowes replaced Panicci and joined Harper&#x27;s band.

<doc id="492513" wikidata="Q5156381" url="?curid=492513" title="Comping (jazz)">
<text>In jazz, comping (an abbreviation of accompaniment; or possibly from the verb, to &quot;complement&quot;) is the chords, rhythms, and countermelodies that keyboard players (piano or organ), guitar players, or drummers use to support a musician&#x27;s improvised solo or melody lines. It is also the action of accompanying, and the left-hand part of a solo pianist.

==Types==
In a standard jazz combo, the pianist or guitarist typically comps during the horn and double bass solos by improvising chords and countermelodies.

The chordal accompaniment used in jazz is different from the chordal accompaniment style used in many types of popular music, such as rock and folk.
*In a rock or folk band, a guitarist or piano player will accompany by playing primarily root-position triads consisting of the root, 3rd, and 5th. In the key of C, the G chord would include the notes G, B, and D (the root, 3rd, and 5th of the chord). In a hard rock or heavy metal music band, a guitarist often comps by playing power chords (root, fifth and octave, or for fast chord changes, just root and fifth).
* In a jazz band a guitarist or pianist will comp by playing a variety of chords that include the 3rd, 7th, 9th, and 13th (jazz chord players often omit the root, because the bassist usually plays the root. The fifth of the chord is also omitted, except when the fifth is flattened or sharpened). In the key of C, the G7 chord in a jazz context might be performed by playing the notes B, E, F, and A (the 3rd, 13th, flat 7th, and 9th notes of the chord). As well, jazz compers may use altered chords that contain flattened or sharpened 5ths, sharp 11ths, flat or sharpened 9ths, and flat 13ths for some songs or soloists. For example, an altered G7 chord might be played with a basic voicing, often the 3rd (B) and 7th (F), along with some of the following notes A, A, C, and E (9, 9, 11, 13), subject to the taste and style of the performer and/or the bandleader.

In combos with a guitar player, the guitar player usually comps for soloists. If there are both a pianist and a guitarist, as sometimes occurs in organ trios or big bands, they may either alternate comping or comp at the same time. Having two chordal instruments comp at the same time is difficult to do well. The two compers may make different, clashing interpretations of the same chord (e.g., the pianist may add a flat 13th, while the guitarist plays a natural 13th), or the texture may become overly cluttered. One solution is for the two comping instrumentalists to play sparsely.

===Chords===
Comping is almost always improvised by the comping musicians based on a chord chart, lead sheet (which contains the chords written above the melody), sheet music, or, in country music, the Nashville Number System. The exception is well-known progressions (e.g., 12 bar blues) and jazz standards such as &quot;I Got Rhythm&quot;, known colloquially as &quot;rhythm changes&quot;. For well-known progressions, the bandleader may simply say &quot;solos on blues changes&quot; or &quot;solos on rhythm changes&quot;, and the comping musicians are expected to be familiar with these chord progressions. Top soloists playing with the most advanced comping musicians may simply call out the name of jazz standards, and the sidemen will be expected to know the chord progression. For example, the soloist may request &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; without providing the compers with a chord chart or sheet music. The compers at the highest professional level would be expected to know this tune.

Since there are many variant versions of these chord progressions, the comping musicians will have to come to an unspoken consensus on which chords to use. For example, there are many different turnarounds used for the last two bars of a 12 bar blues; however, if the bandleader, playing Hammond organ, plays I/VI7/ii7/V7 for the turnaround, most skilled compers will hear these chords by ear and then replicate them in subsequent choruses (each full playing of the 12-bar progression is colloquially called a &quot;chorus&quot;).

===Drums===
During swing-feel songs, drummers will usually comp with one hand on the snare drum while playing time on the cymbals, typically on the ride cymbal (see drum kit). More skilled drummers often comp with even all three limbs excluding their right-hand ride pattern (snare drum, bass drum, hi-hats). They will most likely develop the simple jazz drum pattern and add a few &quot;bomb&quot; bass drum notes for extra effect.

===Horns===
In small jazz ensembles (&quot;combos&quot;) with more unusual instrumentation, horn players (e.g., saxophone, trumpet, etc.) can comp by playing the melody line in the background, or by playing a sequence of notes called &quot;guide tones&quot; which outline the harmonic framework. Guide tones are usually the 3rd, 7th, or 9th notes of a given chord. Guide tone lines are constructed by descending (or ascending) through the guide tones of the chart, normally by semitone or tone. For instance, in a duo for saxophone and bass, the saxophonist might comp during the bass solo by playing guide tones.

For example, during the standard jazz chord progression ii7/V7/I/VI7 (in the key of C Major, this would be Dm7/G7/C/A7), a horn player might play the guide tones, in whole notes, C (minor 7th of d minor), B (third of G7), A (sixth of C; sixths are added to major chords in jazz even when not specified) and G (minor 7th of A7). This is only one possible guide tone sequence. A second guide tone sequence (in whole notes) might be F (minor third of d minor), E (sixth of G7), D (ninth of C Major; as with sixths, ninths are often added to chord voicings even when not indicated), C# (major third of A7).

===Drum solo===
During a drum solo, the entire band may tacet (be silent, called &quot;laying out&quot; in jazz slang). Alternatively, the pianist (and possibly the bassist and/or guitarist or organist) sometimes comps, often using a predictable pattern of rhythmically played chords called &quot;hits&quot;. A well-known example is the second half of &quot;Take Five&quot;, with Dave Brubeck&#x27;s piano vamp comping for Joe Morello&#x27;s drum solo. During piano solos, pianists often comp for themselves, playing melodic lines and solos with the right hand while comping with the left hand.

==Roles ==
While any jazz instrument can be used for comping, the chordal rhythm section instruments (piano, organ, and guitar) have developed the largest collection of pedagogical materials about comping. Since a jazz soloist has such wide-ranging harmonic, melodic, and rhythmic possibilities, chordal instrumentalists must have a similarly wide range of tools at their disposal to support the soloist properly.

Comping musicians must know many different types of chord voicings so that they can match the mood the soloist is trying to create. To support some soloists, a comper needs to use very simple voicings (such as the 3rd and 7th of a chord). However, for other soloists who play in a very dense, complicated style, compers may need to use chords with many additional extensions, such as 9ths, 13ths, and altered voicings; they may also re-harmonize chord progressions depending on the soloist, thus creating a feedback of idea exchange between the soloist and the comper. For the most sophisticated soloists, a comper may need to be able to respond in real time to newly improvised implied chord changes.

Compers must have an understanding of rhythm that allows them to respond to the rhythms and beat patterns the soloist plays, such as Latin or Afro-Cuban rhythms. As well, they must have a melodic sense based on a knowledge of a huge repertoire of different scales and scalar patterns, to be able to improvise countermelodies to supplement the soloist&#x27;s melodies and fill in empty spaces.

By comping, pianists, organists, and guitarists provide the &quot;glue&quot; that holds the rhythm section together. They take the soloist&#x27;s improvised solos and melodies and add harmonies (as a bass player does) and rhythms (as a drummer does). By doing this, the comper helps ensure that the band is always at the same energy level as the soloist. Wynton Kelly and Herbie Hancock are examples of pianists who are responsive when comping. Oscar Peterson usually comped busily, while Count Basie comped sparsely. There is no single appropriate way to comp for a soloist.

===Adapting to soloist===
A comper adapts his or her style to that of the soloist. In a jazz band with multiple soloists, this may require different styles for different soloists. For example, the saxophone player in a band may imply many extensions and altered chords in his soloing (e.g., b9, b13, etc.). For this soloist, a comper may decide to play altered dominants and dense harmonies. The next soloist, a jazz guitarist, may play sparse, delicate melody lines, with much space. For this soloist, the comper may use open voicings, omit passing chords, and try to play mainly in the space left by the soloist. If a soloist starts implying a certain style or feel in his solo, whether this is Afro-Cuban music or hard-driving swing, the entire rhythm section may shift to this style to support him.

In a tune, if a soloist starts playing in a jazz-rock fusion style, the comping musicians may adapt and shift into a rock-influenced groove. A guitarist who is comping may turn on an overdrive pedal to add rock music-style &quot;growl&quot; to his tone. A guitarist may also use other effects units, such as a chorus effect. A keyboardist playing Fender Rhodes electric piano or Hammond organ may turn up his preamplifier to produce a natural tube overdrive tone for his sound. A drummer may shift to a rock style of drumming.

===Soloing===
In all but the largest big bands, the comping sidemen in a jazz show are often called upon by the bandleader to improvise a solo. Here, the comper takes centre stage and performs an improvised melody line. For 1920s Dixieland and some Swing era jazz, the comper may embellish the melody line and improvise by ear during his solo. For Bebop-style groups, the comper playing a solo will often base his improvisations on the chord progression of the song. Bebop tunes often have one, two or even three chord changes per bar and some tunes change keys every few bars; as such, it is hard to solo &quot;by ear&quot; on a Bebop song.

<doc id="492516" wikidata="Q1663694" url="?curid=492516" title="Inclusion map">
<text>In mathematics, if formula_1 is a subset of formula_2 then the inclusion map is the function formula_3 that sends each element formula_4 of formula_1 to formula_6 treated as an element of formula_7
formula_8

An inclusion map may also be referred to as an inclusion function, an insertion, or a canonical injection.

A &quot;hooked arrow&quot; () is sometimes used in place of the function arrow above to denote an inclusion map; thus:
formula_9

(However, some authors use this hooked arrow for any embedding.)

This and other analogous injective functions from substructures are sometimes called natural injections.

Given any morphism formula_10 between objects formula_11 and formula_12, if there is an inclusion map formula_13 into the domain formula_11, then one can form the restriction formula_15 of formula_16 In many instances, one can also construct a canonical inclusion into the codomain formula_17 known as the range of formula_16

==Applications of inclusion maps==
Inclusion maps tend to be homomorphisms of algebraic structures; thus, such inclusion maps are embeddings. More precisely, given a substructure closed under some operations, the inclusion map will be an embedding for tautological reasons. For example, for some binary operation formula_19 to require that
formula_20
is simply to say that formula_21 is consistently computed in the sub-structure and the large structure. The case of a unary operation is similar; but one should also look at nullary operations, which pick out a &quot;constant&quot; element. Here the point is that closure means such constants must already be given in the substructure.

Inclusion maps are seen in algebraic topology where if formula_1 is a strong deformation retract of formula_23 the inclusion map yields an isomorphism between all homotopy groups (that is, it is a homotopy equivalence).

Inclusion maps in geometry come in different kinds: for example embeddings of submanifolds. Contravariant objects (which is to say, objects that have pullbacks; these are called covariant in an older and unrelated terminology) such as differential forms &quot;restrict&quot; to submanifolds, giving a mapping in the &quot;other direction&quot;. Another example, more sophisticated, is that of affine schemes, for which the inclusions
formula_24
and
formula_25
may be different morphisms, where formula_26 is a commutative ring and formula_27 is an ideal of formula_28

<text>In jazz, the term upper structure or &quot;upper structure triad&quot; refers to a voicing approach developed by jazz pianists and arrangers defined by the sounding of a major or minor triad in the uppermost pitches of a more complex harmony.

==Examples==

Example 1: Below, a common voicing used by jazz pianists is given for the chord C79 (C major chord with a minor 7th, and extended with an augmented 9th).

In the lower stave the notes E and B are given. These form a tritone which defines the dominant sound, and are the major 3rd and minor 7th of the C79 chord. 

In the upper stave the notes E, G, and B are given together: these form an E major triad.

This E major triad is what would be called the upper structure. Considered in relation to the root C, the notes of this E major triad function, respectively, as the sharpened ninth (the root of the E major chord), fifth, and seventh in relation to that root. 

(Note: the root C is omitted here, and is often done so by jazz pianists for ease of playing, or because a bass player is present.)

Example 2: The following example illustrates the notes of an F minor triad functioning as part of a C13911 chord (C major chord with a minor 7th, minor 9th, augmented 11th, and major 13th):

In relation to the root of C, the C (enharmonic with D) functions as the minor 9th, the F as the augmented 11th, and the A as the major 13th, respectively.

==Application==

Determining which additional pitches can be juxtaposed with the chord is achieved by considering the relationship between a particular chord and the scale it implies. An example follows:

#The chord C13911 contains the following notes, from the root upwards: C, E, G, B, D, F, A;
#The following octatonic scale contains all of these pitches, and fits/matches up with the C13911 chord: C–D–D–E–F–G–A–B–C; these scale elements form a pool from which melodic and harmonic devices might be devised.

==Shorthand notation==

Common jazz parlance refers to upper structures by way of the interval between the root of the bottom chord and the root of the triad juxtaposed above it. For instance, in example one above (C79) the triad of E major is a (compound) minor 3rd away from C (root of the bottom chord). Thus, this upper structure can be called &quot;upper structure flat three&quot;, or USIII for short. 

Other possible upper structures are: 

*USII – e.g. D major over C7, resulting in C1311
*USV – e.g. G major over C7, resulting in C7911
*USVI – e.g. A major over C7, resulting in C7913
*USVI – e.g. A major over C7, resulting in C139
*USi – e.g. C minor over C7, resulting in C79
*USii – e.g. D minor over C7, resulting in C7913
*USiii – e.g. E minor over C7, resulting in C7911

The second item in the list above (C7911) has a related version called &quot;upper structure sharp four minor&quot;--with the written shorthand USiv--created with an F minor triad. (See &quot;Example 2&quot; above.)

<text>Phillip Hagar Smith (April 29, 1905 – August 29, 1987) was an American electrical engineer, who became famous for his invention of the Smith chart.

Smith was born in Lexington, Massachusetts in 1905, and graduated from Tufts College in 1928 with a BS degree in electrical engineering. While working for Bell Telephone Laboratories, he invented his eponymous Smith chart (which was also invented independently in 1937 by Tōsaku Mizuhashi () and in 1939 by ()).

When asked why he invented the chart, Smith explained, &quot;From the time I could operate a slide rule, I&#x27;ve been interested in graphical representations of mathematical relationships.&quot; In 1969 he published the book &quot;Electronic Applications of the Smith Chart: In Waveguide, Circuit, and Component Analysis&quot;, a comprehensive work on the subject. He retired from Bell Labs in 1970. He was elected a fellow of the Institute of Radio Engineers in 1952.

Although best known for his Smith chart, he made important contributions in a variety of fields, including radar, FM, and antennas (including use of the Lüneburg lens).

The IEEE History Center conducted an interview with Smith in 1973, the edited transcript and audio clips from which are on the web.

Smith died in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey in 1987.

<doc id="492533" wikidata="Q2544408" url="?curid=492533" title="Truly Madly Deeply (song)">
<text>&quot;Truly Madly Deeply&quot; is a song by Australian pop duo Savage Garden, released in March 1997 as the third single from their self-titled debut album (1997) by Roadshow and Warner Music. It won the 1997 ARIA Music Award for both Single of the Year and Highest Selling Single and was nominated for Song of the Year. Written by bandmates Darren Hayes and Daniel Jones, the song is a reworking of a song called &quot;Magical Kisses&quot; that the pair wrote together during the recording of their debut album.

The song reached 1 in Australia, Canada, and the United States; in the latter country, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked it the most successful song of all time on their Adult Contemporary chart. Two music videos were filmed for the track: one for its original Australian release and another for the international market, shot in Paris, France. In November 2019, the song was added to the National Film and Sound Archive&#x27;s selection of recordings. The songs added to the list provide a snapshot of Australian life and have &quot;cultural, historical, and aesthetic significance and relevance&quot;.

==Background and composition==
Having got their breakthrough with the single &quot;I Want You&quot;, Darren Hayes and Daniel Jones were sent to Sydney for eight months to record material for a debut album. For Hayes, it was his first time in life being away from his family and his native Brisbane. The longing for his family and his then-wife pushed him towards writing a song that would express those feelings. The sheet music for &quot;Truly Madly Deeply&quot; indicates the key of C major with a tempo of 83 bpm.

==Versions==

There are two versions of the song. The first was made available on the Australian version of the group&#x27;s album, whereas the second version appears on the release of the album in Europe and America. This version was composed in 1997 and features a drum machine track instead of the more acoustic-sounding music featured on the Australian version. The European version also features on the group&#x27;s greatest hits compilation, &quot;Truly Madly Completely&quot; and &quot;The Singles&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Larry Flick from &quot;Billboard&quot; wrote that &quot;this is the single that should help affirm that Savage Garden is more than a one-hit wonder.&quot; He described the song as a &quot;percussive ballad&quot; and complimented it for revealing &quot;vocal skills and charisma not previously displayed&quot;. He noted further that &quot;with its romantic lyrics and plush, guitar-etched instrumentation, this song &#x27;truly madly deeply&#x27; deserves as much airplay as the top 40 programmers can heap upon it.&quot; Insider described it as &quot;a truly sweet song, written out of homesickness; this love ballad has total staying power and is still played over 20 years later.&quot; Pan-European magazine &quot;Music &amp; Media&quot; stated, &quot;This Australian duo possesses a fine knack for writing excellent mainstream pop with top flight radio appeal.&quot; They added, &quot;This track [...] is no exception—as proven by its recent two-week stay at the top of &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot 100 Singles chart.&quot; A reviewer from &quot;Music Week&quot; gave &quot;Truly Madly Deeply&quot; three out of five, remarking that the song had been successful in both Australia and the US, while the UK &quot;is a little less keen. But this luscious pop ballad should attract airplay and sales.&quot; In 2018, &quot;Stacker&quot; placed the song at No. 21 on their list of the &quot;Best pop songs of the last 25 years,&quot; noting it as &quot;a quintessential &#x27;90s pop song&quot;. In 2019, they ranked it No. 9 on their list of the &quot;Best 90s pop songs&quot;.

==Chart performance==
The song became the duo&#x27;s second number 1 in their native Australia.

The song entering the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart at No. 26 on 6 December 1997, It peaked at No. 1 for two weeks in January 1998 and lingered for a full year on the chart. It became the first song in the chart&#x27;s history to spend its first 52 weeks inside the top 30. The song spent half a year in the top 10. It hit No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Airplay chart and No. 2 on the Hot Adult Top 40 Tracks chart. It also entered the top 10 on the Rhythmic Top 40 chart. On the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 40 Mainstream chart, the song reached No. 1 for one week on 31 January before dropping to No. 2 as Celine Dion assumed the top spot with the theme to the hit film &quot;Titanic&quot;, &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;. Savage Garden&#x27;s single held at No. 2 for 10 weeks before returning to the No. 1 spot on the week of 18 April.

The song eventually set a record for the most weeks of any single in history on the US Hot Adult Contemporary chart. In 1998, the song logged 11 weeks at No. 1 on this chart, but its full chart span lasted 123 weeks. That record would stand for just under two years, when another of the group&#x27;s ballads spent its 124th week on the chart. The song was &quot;I Knew I Loved You&quot;, from the album &quot;Affirmation&quot;. After leaving the main Adult Contemporary chart, the song entered the Hot Adult Contemporary Recurrents chart where it charted for another 202 weeks. The song was so popular that it re-entered &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Hot Singles Sales chart in March 2002 and—four and a half years after its release—again became a U.S. Top 30 bestseller, remaining on that chart until late July 2002. The original version logged its final week on the Hot Adult Contemporary Recurrents chart on 17 June 2006. This combined with sales still makes it the #1 Billboard AC song of all time. In 2008, the song was listed at No. 30 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot 100 All-Time Top Songs. 

The song also reached No. 1 in Canada. It reached No. 2 in Norway, Sweden, Austria and Ireland, and went top ten in France, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium and the UK. In 1998, the song was certified a Gold single in France, for sales of 200,000 copies. In May 2001 the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), as part of its 75th Anniversary celebrations, named &quot;Truly Madly Deeply&quot; as one of the Top 30 Australian songs of all time.

==Music video==
Two music videos were made for the song. The original Australian video, which presents Hayes with long hair, features the band in a white room with several other people. Hayes is on a red sofa singing the song while Daniel performs on the piano. It was directed by Tony McGrath. The video used for the European market, which presents Hayes with short hair, was filmed in Paris, France. It was directed by Adolfo Doring. The video depicts the story of two lovers, a young man and a lady, who have been separated by circumstances. The woman arrives in Paris at Gare de l&#x27;Est station, in search of her lover, who is also waiting for her. He is wandering in various places within the Montmartre area, including the Soleil de la Butte restaurant. In between the scenes involving the two lovers, Hayes can be seen walking around Paris, in locations such as the Place de la Concorde and the Jardin des Tuileries. He is singing, thereby acting as a narrator to the story involving the two lovers. Towards the end of the video, Hayes enters a small concert hall where Daniel Jones is playing guitar. Shortly afterwards, the young lady manages to find her lover, right in the centre of Paris, at the feet of the Tour Saint-Jacques. They are both filled with emotion on seeing each other again. The video ends with Hayes and Jones coming out of the concert hall, and coming across the two lovers who are rejoicing in their reunion.

<text>Toys is a 1992 American surrealist comedy film directed by Barry Levinson, cowritten by Levinson and Valerie Curtin, and starring Robin Williams, Michael Gambon, Joan Cusack, Robin Wright, LL Cool J, Arthur Malet, Donald O&#x27;Connor, Jack Warden, and Jamie Foxx in his feature film debut. Released in December 1992, the film was produced by Levinson&#x27;s production company, Baltimore Pictures, and distributed by 20th Century Fox.

The film was a box-office failure at the time of its release. Critical reception was generally negative, with Levinson nominated for a Razzie Award for Worst Director. The film did, however, receive Oscar nominations for Art Direction (losing to &quot;Howards End&quot;) and Costume Design (losing to &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot;). It was also entered into the 43rd Berlin International Film Festival.

==Plot==
Kenneth Zevo, the eccentric owner of Zevo Toys in Moscow, Idaho, faces terminal illness. Defying expectations, he bypasses his son, Leslie—a whimsical toymaker apprenticed at the factory—and appoints his estranged brother, U.S. Army Lieutenant General Leland Zevo, as successor. Kenneth believes Leslie’s childlike nature would endanger the company, despite his talent. To aid Leslie’s maturity, Kenneth hires Gwen Tyler, hoping they’ll form a relationship.

After Kenneth’s death, Leland reluctantly assumes control but delegates factory operations to Leslie and his sister, Alsatia, due to their expertise. However, Leland’s militaristic instincts surface upon learning of potential corporate espionage. He enlists his son, Patrick, a covert operations specialist, to overhaul security. Inspired by war machinery, Leland proposes manufacturing military toys, clashing with Leslie, who cites Kenneth’s pacifist ethos as company policy. Meanwhile, Leslie and Gwen begin dating.

Secretly, Leland converts a factory section to develop miniature remote-controlled war machines, misleading Leslie by claiming it’s for experimental toys. After the military rejects his prototypes, Leland grows unhinged, expanding production, militarizing the facility, and displacing workers—including Alsatia. Suspicious, Leslie and Alsatia infiltrate the restricted area and discover children piloting war drones via arcade-style consoles. They narrowly escape an amphibious drone, the &quot;Sea Swine,&quot; and alert Gwen and Owen (Kenneth’s former assistant).

Patrick, learning Leland lied about his mother’s death, defects to Leslie’s side. The group infiltrates the factory, evading Leland’s deadly toys, including &quot;Tommy Tanks&quot; and &quot;Hurly-Burly Helicopters.&quot; Leslie rallies vintage Zevo toys from storage, unleashing them against Leland’s army in a chaotic showdown. During the clash, Leland’s helicopter misfires, destroying his control panel and deactivating his machines.

A critical revelation emerges: Alsatia is an advanced robot built by Kenneth to companion Leslie after their mother’s death. She is damaged defending against the Sea Swine but later repaired. Leland, attacked by his own drone, is hospitalized. Leslie assumes leadership, restoring the factory’s playful ethos with Gwen, while Patrick departs for new missions. The film concludes with the group honoring Kenneth’s legacy at a memorial.

==Cast==
==Production==
Barry Levinson wrote &quot;Toys&quot; with his then-wife, Valerie Curtin, in 1979, intending it to be his directorial debut. He came up with the story after reading a newspaper article about the Soviet Navy Intelligence Department finding information about United States Navy nuclear submarines from toy models. 20th Century Fox got the rights and originally planned to start principal photography in April 1980. However, the executives who had approved Levinson&#x27;s script were replaced by a new management team led by Shirley Lansing which, unsure about the project&#x27;s potential, put it in turnaround.

Levinson tried to revive the project at other studios in the 1980s. In 1982, CBS Theatrical Films agreed to make &quot;Toys&quot; as one of its first thirty-nine films, but the studio was closed. Columbia Pictures tried to make the film in 1987 during David Puttnam&#x27;s year as president, but Fox President Leonard Goldberg denied them the rights. In 1988, interest in the project increased after Robin Williams agreed to star in the film and Levinson&#x27;s film &quot;Rain Man&quot; became highly successful. In 1990, Fox president Joe Roth finally greenlit the film, assigning a $38 million budget. However, issues during pre-production and scheduling conflicts with Levinson&#x27;s next film &quot;Bugsy&quot; (1991) delayed the film for another several years. Producer Mark Johnson noted that the development hell was partly because their intentions were never understood, because &quot;we kept using the word &#x27;whimsy&#x27;&quot;, while the studios &quot;kept reading it as a black comedy&quot;.

Principal photography began on February 25, 1992, at the Fox lot in Los Angeles and concluded in June 1992. Location filming also took place at the Palouse River Valley in Washington. The film nearly went over budget, but Levinson, Williams, and producer Mark Johnson reduced costs to just $30 million after they agreed to defer their salaries.

Levinson, who said that the movie had an ironic title regarding how &quot;big toys, little toys–it&#x27;s all a game, watching that missile go down the chimney blowing up that factory in Iraq could have been in a video arcade&quot;, considered that &quot;Toys&quot; was produced at a favorable time, as post-Cold War military expenditures were cut, and &quot;investing in a force of tiny, remote-controlled $5,000 planes instead of a $450-million one is one way of beating the cutbacks&quot;.

Italian designer, Ferdinando Scarfiotti, spent more than a year designing the sets, which took over every sound stage at Fox Studios in Los Angeles. The influence of René Magritte&#x27;s art is obvious in the set design and in some of the costume design. The poster distributed to movie theaters featuring Williams in a red bowler hat against a blue, cloud-lined background evokes &quot;The Son of Man&quot;. &quot;Golconda&quot; is featured during a sequence in which Williams and Cusack perform in a music video sequence rife with surreal imagery, much of it Magritte-inspired. The film&#x27;s design was also influenced by Dadaism, Modernism and Italian Futurism — notably the work of Fortunato Depero.

The film has often been noted for many of its outdoor scenes, which feature the Palouse region. All of the outdoor scenes, including the trailer, were filmed on location in southeastern Washington near Rosalia and north-central Idaho.

==Release==
===Promotion===
The film was publicized with a trailer that features Williams walking through a large undulating field of green grass, breaking the fourth wall and talking to the audience. This trailer was parodied on the TV show, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, in the episode, &quot;Burns&#x27; Heir&quot;, substituting Mr. Burns for Williams.

===Box office===
&quot;Toys&quot; was released in 1,272 venues, earning $4,810,027 and ranking sixth in its opening weekend, second among new releases, behind &quot;Forever Young&quot;. The film would ultimately gross $23,278,931 in North America, making it a commercial failure based on a $50 million budget.

===Critical response===
The film has an approval rating of 29% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 28 reviews, and an average score of 4.5/10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Like a colorfully overengineered gewgaw on the shelf, &quot;Toys&quot; might look like fun, but its seemingly limitless possibilities lead mainly to confusion and disappointment.&quot; Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C+&quot; on a scale of A+ to F.

Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stated that what made the film &quot;that much sadder a failure is that everyone involved must have sincerely felt they were doing the Lord&#x27;s work, care and concern going hand in hand with an almost total miscalculation of mood. Even Robin Williams, so lively a voice in &quot;Aladdin&quot;, is on beatific automatic pilot here, preferring to be warm and cuddly when a little of his energy (paradoxically on splendid display in the film&#x27;s teaser trailer) is desperately called for. &quot;The Grinch Who Stole Christmas&quot; seems to have stripped the life from this film as well, leaving a pretty shell, expensive but hollow, in its place.&quot;

Peter Travers wrote in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;To cut &quot;Toys&quot; a minor break, it is ambitious. It is also a gimmicky, obvious and pious bore, not to mention overproduced and overlong.&quot;

==Home media==
The film was released on VHS and LaserDisc in 1993, and DVD on October 16, 2001.

==Video game==
A video game based on the film, &quot;Toys: Let the Toy Wars Begin!&quot;, was released in 1993 for the Super NES and Genesis platforms by Absolute Entertainment. The game is played from an isometric perspective, and involves the player, as Leslie, attempting to destroy the elephant-head security cameras in the factory, cafeteria and warehouse levels to shut down those defenses. When the player gets to the Manhattan model, the game switches to a side-scrolling stage in which the player must fly all the way to the General&#x27;s control center, shut down the production of the war toys, and save the good name of Zevo Toys.

<doc id="492599" wikidata="Q572981" url="?curid=492599" title="Automobiles René Bonnet">
<text>Automobiles René Bonnet was a French automobile maker.

The firm was the continuation of Deutsch et Bonnet (DB) by René Bonnet when Charles Deutsch, the &quot;D&quot; in DB, founded his own firm CD. The business was based at Champigny-sur-Marne to the south-east of central Paris.

==History==

A principal cause of the breach had involved the determination of Deutsch to stay loyal to Panhard engines while Bonnet was keen to switch to Renault power plants. The DB Le Mans, a 2+2 convertible, continued in production as the René Bonnet Le Mans, still on a front-wheel drive Panhard-based chassis albeit now equipped with Renault engines. Renault&#x27;s 1,108 cc inline-four engine was also used for the Missile, a strict two-seater convertible based on the Le Mans but with a re-worked front end, and for the mid-engined Djet.

The company produced light front-wheel drive and mid-engined sports cars with very aerodynamic fiberglass bodies mainly powered by enhanced Renault engines. Its cars participated in the Le Mans 24 Hours race in 1962, 1963, and 1964. Management concentration on racing activity may nevertheless have come at the expense of commercial focus, and relatively few cars were sold during this period: by 1964 the cash was running out.
In 1962 the René Bonnet company launched its Djet model, generally remembered in retrospect as a Matra, although 198 Bonnet Djets were sold between 1962 and 1964 (179 of these were to the lowest powered &quot;Djet I&quot; specifications with 65 PS). A further 1,491 would be sold as Matra Djets between 1965 and 1968. The cars usually featured Renault&#x27;s four-cylinder 1,108 cc engine, but some competition versions received a considerably more powerful smaller twin-cam, 996 cc unit. The earlier DB-based Missile and Le Mans were not brought back into production after the Matra takeover.

The firm worked increasingly closely with its principal investor Matra. Matra was at the time an armaments manufacturer concentrating on missiles, but they were also enthusiastic about the future of the fibreglass technology in which Bonnet was a pioneer. An important role in bringing Bonnet&#x27;s business and Matra together was also contributed by an energetic former fighter pilot and national politician called André Moynet whose involvement with the enterprise appears to have outlasted Bonnet&#x27;s own. Matra&#x27;s rapidly evolving partnership with René Bonnet&#x27;s auto-making business was the beginning of the subsequently better known Matra Automobile division, formally inaugurated in October 1964. After this Bonnet himself appears to have had little further significant involvement in the business that for two and a half years had carried his name.

== Cars ==
* René Bonnet Le Mans: 1962–1964
* René Bonnet Missile: 1962–1964
* René Bonnet Djet: 1962–1964 (and subsequently produced as Matra-Bonnet Djet/Matra Jet until 1967)
* René Bonnet Aérojet: 1964–1965 (competition car, only nine built)

<text>In abstract algebra, a bimodule is an abelian group that is both a left and a right module, such that the left and right multiplications are compatible. Besides appearing naturally in many parts of mathematics, bimodules play a clarifying role, in the sense that many of the relationships between left and right modules become simpler when they are expressed in terms of bimodules.

== Definition ==
If &quot;R&quot; and &quot;S&quot; are two rings, then an &quot;R&quot;-&quot;S&quot;-bimodule is an abelian group such that:
# &quot;M&quot; is a left &quot;R&quot;-module and a right &quot;S&quot;-module.
# For all &quot;r&quot; in &quot;R&quot;, &quot;s&quot; in &quot;S&quot; and &quot;m&quot; in &quot;M&quot;: formula_1

An &quot;R&quot;-&quot;R&quot;-bimodule is also known as an &quot;R&quot;-bimodule.

== Examples ==
* For positive integers &quot;n&quot; and &quot;m&quot;, the set &quot;M&quot;&quot;n&quot;,&quot;m&quot;(R) of matrices of real numbers is an , where &quot;R&quot; is the ring &quot;M&quot;&quot;n&quot;(R) of matrices, and &quot;S&quot; is the ring &quot;M&quot;&quot;m&quot;(R) of matrices. Addition and multiplication are carried out using the usual rules of matrix addition and matrix multiplication; the heights and widths of the matrices have been chosen so that multiplication is defined. Note that &quot;M&quot;&quot;n&quot;,&quot;m&quot;(R) itself is not a ring (unless ), because multiplying an matrix by another matrix is not defined. The crucial bimodule property, that , is the statement that multiplication of matrices is associative (which, in the case of a matrix ring, corresponds to associativity).
* Any algebra &quot;A&quot; over a ring &quot;R&quot; has the natural structure of an &quot;R&quot;-bimodule, with left and right multiplication defined by and respectively, where is the canonical embedding of &quot;R&quot; into &quot;A&quot;.
* If &quot;R&quot; is a ring, then &quot;R&quot; itself can be considered to be an by taking the left and right actions to be multiplication – the actions commute by associativity. This can be extended to &quot;R&quot;&quot;n&quot; (the &quot;n&quot;-fold direct product of &quot;R&quot;).
* Any two-sided ideal of a ring &quot;R&quot; is an , with the ring multiplication both as the left and as the right multiplication.
* Any module over a commutative ring &quot;R&quot; has the natural structure of a bimodule. For example, if &quot;M&quot; is a left module, we can define multiplication on the right to be the same as multiplication on the left. (However, not all &quot;R&quot;-bimodules arise this way: other compatible right multiplications may exist.)
* If &quot;M&quot; is a left &quot;R&quot;-module, then &quot;M&quot; is an , where Z is the ring of integers. Similarly, right &quot;R&quot;-modules may be interpreted as . Any abelian group may be treated as a .
* If &quot;M&quot; is a right &quot;R&quot;-module, then the set of &quot;R&quot;-module endomorphisms is a ring with the multiplication given by composition. The endomorphism ring acts on &quot;M&quot; by left multiplication defined by . The bimodule property, that , restates that &quot;f&quot; is a &quot;R&quot;-module homomorphism from &quot;M&quot; to itself. Therefore any right &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;M&quot; is an -bimodule. Similarly any left &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;N&quot; is an -bimodule.
* If &quot;R&quot; is a subring of &quot;S&quot;, then &quot;S&quot; is an . It is also an and an .
* If &quot;M&quot; is an &quot;S&quot;-&quot;R&quot;-bimodule and &quot;N&quot; is an , then is an &quot;S&quot;-&quot;T&quot;-bimodule.

== Further notions and facts ==
If &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; are &quot;R&quot;-&quot;S&quot;-bimodules, then a map is a &quot;bimodule homomorphism&quot; if it is both a homomorphism of left &quot;R&quot;-modules and of right &quot;S&quot;-modules.

An &quot;R&quot;-&quot;S&quot;-bimodule is actually the same thing as a left module over the ring , where &quot;S&quot;op is the opposite ring of &quot;S&quot; (where the multiplication is defined with the arguments exchanged). Bimodule homomorphisms are the same as homomorphisms of left modules. Using these facts, many definitions and statements about modules can be immediately translated into definitions and statements about bimodules. For example, the category of all is abelian, and the standard isomorphism theorems are valid for bimodules.
There are however some new effects in the world of bimodules, especially when it comes to the tensor product: if &quot;M&quot; is an and &quot;N&quot; is an , then the tensor product of &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; (taken over the ring &quot;S&quot;) is an in a natural fashion. This tensor product of bimodules is associative (up to a unique canonical isomorphism), and one can hence construct a category whose objects are the rings and whose morphisms are the bimodules. This is in fact a 2-category, in a canonical way – 2 morphisms between &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; are exactly bimodule homomorphisms, i.e. functions
: formula_2
that satisfy
# formula_3 
# formula_4,
for , , and . One immediately verifies the interchange law for bimodule homomorphisms, i.e.
: formula_5
holds whenever either (and hence the other) side of the equation is defined, and where ∘ is the usual composition of homomorphisms. In this interpretation, the category is exactly the monoidal category of with the usual tensor product over &quot;R&quot; the tensor product of the category. In particular, if &quot;R&quot; is a commutative ring, every left or right &quot;R&quot;-module is canonically an , which gives a monoidal embedding of the category into . The case that &quot;R&quot; is a field &quot;K&quot; is a motivating example of a symmetric monoidal category, in which case , the category of vector spaces over &quot;K&quot;, with the usual tensor product giving the monoidal structure, and with unit &quot;K&quot;. We also see that a monoid in is exactly an &quot;R&quot;-algebra.
Furthermore, if &quot;M&quot; is an and &quot;L&quot; is an , then the set of all &quot;S&quot;-module homomorphisms from &quot;M&quot; to &quot;L&quot; becomes a in a natural fashion. These statements extend to the derived functors Ext and Tor.

Profunctors can be seen as a categorical generalization of bimodules.

Note that bimodules are not at all related to bialgebras.

<text>In algebra, flat modules include free modules, projective modules, and, over a principal ideal domain, torsion-free modules. Formally, a module &quot;M&quot; over a ring &quot;R&quot; is &quot;flat&quot; if taking the tensor product over &quot;R&quot; with &quot;M&quot; preserves exact sequences. A module is faithfully flat if taking the tensor product with a sequence produces an exact sequence if and only if the original sequence is exact.

Flatness was introduced by in his paper &quot;Géometrie Algébrique et Géométrie Analytique&quot;.

== Definition ==
A left module over a ring is &quot;flat&quot; if the following condition is satisfied: for every injective linear map formula_1 of right -modules, the map
: formula_2
is also injective, where formula_3 is the map
induced by formula_4

For this definition, it is enough to restrict the injections formula_5 to the inclusions of finitely generated ideals into .

Equivalently, an -module is flat if the tensor product with is an exact functor; that is if, for every short exact sequence of -modules formula_6 the sequence formula_7 is also exact. (This is an equivalent definition since the tensor product is a right exact functor.)

These definitions apply also if is a non-commutative ring, and is a left -module; in this case, , and must be right -modules, and the tensor products are not -modules in general, but only abelian groups.

=== Characterizations ===

Flatness can also be characterized by the following equational condition, which means that -linear relations in stem from linear relations in . 

A left -module is flat if and only if, for every linear relation
: formula_8
with formula_9 and formula_10, there exist elements formula_11 and formula_12 such that
: formula_13 for formula_14 
and 
: formula_15 for formula_16

It is equivalent to define elements of a module, and a linear map from formula_17 to this module, which maps the standard basis of formula_17 to the elements. This allows rewriting the previous characterization in terms of homomorphisms, as follows.

An -module is flat if and only if the following condition holds: for every map formula_19 where formula_20 is a finitely generated free -module, and for every finitely generated -submodule formula_21 of formula_22 the map formula_23 factors through a map to a free -module formula_24 such that formula_25

== Relations to other module properties ==

Flatness is related to various other module properties, such as being free, projective, or torsion-free. In particular, every flat module is torsion-free, every projective module is flat, and every free module is projective. 

There are finitely generated modules that are flat and not projective. However, finitely generated flat modules are all projective over the rings that are most commonly considered. Moreover, a finitely generated module is flat if and only it is locally free, meaning all the localizations at prime ideals are free modules.

This is partly summarized in the following graphic.

=== Torsion-free modules ===

Every flat module is torsion-free. This results from the above characterization in terms of relations by taking .

The converse holds over the integers, and more generally over principal ideal domains and Dedekind rings.

An integral domain over which every torsion-free module is flat is called a Prüfer domain.

=== Free and projective modules ===

A module is projective if and only if there is a free module and two linear maps formula_26 and formula_27 such that formula_28 In particular, every free module is projective (take formula_29 and 

Every projective module is flat. This can be proven from the above characterizations of flatness and projectivity in terms of linear maps by taking formula_30 and formula_31

Conversely, finitely generated flat modules are projective under mild conditions that are generally satisfied in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. This makes the concept of flatness useful mainly for modules that are not finitely generated.

A finitely presented module (that is the quotient of a finitely generated free module by a finitely generated submodule) that is flat is always projective. This can be proven by taking surjective and formula_32 in the above characterization of flatness in terms of linear maps. The condition formula_33 implies the existence of a linear map formula_26 such that formula_35 and thus formula_36 As is surjective, one has thus formula_37 and is projective.

Over a Noetherian ring, every finitely generated flat module is projective, since every finitely generated module is finitely presented. The same result is true over an integral domain, even if it is not Noetherian.

On a local ring every finitely generated flat module is free.

A finitely generated flat module that is not projective can be built as follows. Let formula_38 be the set of the infinite sequences whose terms belong to a fixed field . It is a commutative ring with addition and multiplication defined componentwise. This ring is absolutely flat (that is, every module is flat). The module formula_39 where is the ideal of the sequences with a finite number of nonzero terms, is thus flat and finitely generated (only one generator), but it is not projective.

=== Non-examples ===
* If is an ideal in a Noetherian commutative ring , then formula_40 is not a flat module, except if is generated by an idempotent (that is an element equal to its square). In particular, if is an integral domain, formula_40 is flat only if formula_42 equals or is the zero ideal.
* Over an integral domain, a flat module is torsion free. Thus a module that contains nonzero torsion elements is not flat. In particular formula_43 and all fields of positive characteristics are non-flat formula_44-modules, where formula_44 is the ring of integers, and formula_46 is the field of the rational numbers.

=== Direct sums, limits and products ===
A direct sum formula_47 of modules is flat if and only if each formula_48 is flat.

A direct limit of flat is flat. In particular, a direct limit of free modules is flat. Conversely, every flat module can be written as a direct limit of finitely-generated free modules.

Direct products of flat modules need not in general be flat. In fact, given a ring , every direct product of flat -modules is flat if and only if is a coherent ring (that is, every finitely generated ideal is finitely presented).

== Flat ring extensions ==
A ring homomorphism formula_49 is &quot;flat&quot; if is a flat -module for the module structure induced by the homomorphism. For example, the polynomial ring is flat over , for any ring . 

For any multiplicative subset formula_50 of a commutative ring formula_51, the localization formula_52 is a flat -algebra (it is projective only in exceptional cases). For example, formula_46 is flat and not projective over formula_54

If formula_42 is an ideal of a Noetherian commutative ring formula_56 the completion formula_57 of formula_51 with respect to formula_42 is flat. It is faithfully flat if and only if formula_42 is contained in the Jacobson radical of formula_61 (See also Zariski ring.)

== Local property==
In this section, denotes a commutative ring. If formula_62 is a prime ideal of , the localization at formula_62 is, as usual, denoted with formula_62 as an index. That is, formula_65 and, if is an -module, formula_66

If is an -module the three following conditions are equivalent:
*formula_67 is a flat formula_51-module;
*formula_69 is a flat formula_70-module for every prime ideal formula_71
*formula_72 is a flat formula_73-module for every maximal ideal formula_74

This property is fundamental in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry, since it reduces the study of flatness to the case of local rings. They are often expressed by saying that flatness is a local property.

=== Flat morphisms of schemes ===
The definition of a flat morphism of schemes results immediately from the local property of flatness.

A morphism formula_75 of schemes is a flat morphism if the induced map on local rings
: formula_76
is a flat ring homomorphism for any point in . 

Thus, properties of flat (or faithfully flat) ring homomorphisms extends naturally to geometric properties of flat morphisms in algebraic geometry.
For example, consider the flat formula_77-algebra formula_78 (see below). The inclusion formula_79 induces the flat morphism
: formula_80
Each (geometric) fiber formula_81 is the curve of equation formula_82 (See also flat degeneration and deformation to normal cone.)

Let formula_83 be a polynomial ring over a commutative Noetherian ring formula_51 and formula_85 a nonzerodivisor. Then formula_86 is flat over formula_51 if and only if formula_23 is primitive (the coefficients generate the unit ideal). An example is formula_89 which is flat (and even free) over formula_77 (see also below for the geometric meaning). Such flat extensions can be used to yield examples of flat modules that are not free and do not result from a localization.

== Faithful flatness ==
A module is &quot;faithfully flat&quot; if taking the tensor product with a sequence produces an exact sequence if and only if the original sequence is exact. Although the concept is defined for modules over a non-necessary commutative ring, it is used mainly for commutative algebras. So, this is the only case that is considered here, even if some results can be generalized to the case of modules over a non-commutaive ring.

In this section, formula_91 is a ring homomorphism of commutative rings, which gives to formula_50 the structures of an formula_51-algebra and an formula_51-module. If formula_50 is a formula_51-module flat (or faithfully flat), one says commonly that formula_50 is flat (or faithfully flat) over formula_98 and that formula_23 is flat (or faithfully flat).

If formula_50 is flat over formula_56 the following conditions are equivalent.
* formula_50 is faithfully flat.
* For each maximal ideal formula_103 of formula_51, one has formula_105
* If formula_67 is a nonzero formula_51-module, then formula_108
* For every prime ideal formula_109 of formula_56 there is a prime ideal formula_111 of formula_50 such that formula_113 In other words, the map formula_114 induced by formula_23 on the spectra is surjective.
* formula_116 is injective, and formula_51 is a pure subring of formula_118 that is, formula_119 is injective for every formula_51-module formula_67.

The second condition implies that a flat local homomorphism of local rings is faithfully flat. It follows from the last condition that formula_122 for every ideal formula_42 of formula_51 (take formula_125). In particular, if formula_50 is a Noetherian ring, then formula_51 is also Noetherian.

The last but one condition can be stated in the following strengthened form: formula_128 is &quot;submersive&quot;, which means that the Zariski topology of formula_129 is the quotient topology of that of formula_130 (this is a special case of the fact that a faithfully flat quasi-compact morphism of schemes has this property.). See also &quot;&quot;.

=== Examples ===
* A ring homomorphism formula_131 such that formula_50 is a nonzero free -module is faithfully flat. For example:
** Every field extension is faithfully flat. This property is implicitly behind the use of complexification for proving results on real vector spaces.
** A polynomial ring is a faithfully flat extension of its ring of coefficients.
** If formula_133 is a monic polynomial, the inclusion formula_134 is faithfully flat.
* Let formula_135 The direct product formula_136 of the localizations at the formula_137 is faithfully flat over formula_51 if and only if formula_139 generate the unit ideal of formula_51 (that is, if formula_141 is a linear combination of the formula_137).
* The direct sum of the localizations formula_70 of formula_51 at all its prime ideals is a faithfully flat module that is not an algebra, except if there are finitely many prime ideals.

The two last examples are implicitly behind the wide use of localization in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.

* For a given ring homomorphism formula_145 there is an associated complex called the Amitsur complex:
formula_146
where the coboundary operators formula_147 are the alternating sums of the maps obtained by inserting 1 in each spot; e.g., formula_148. Then (Grothendieck) this complex is exact if formula_23 is faithfully flat.

=== Faithfully flat local homomorphisms ===
Here is one characterization of a faithfully flat homomorphism for a not-necessarily-flat homomorphism. Given an injective local homomorphism formula_150 such that formula_151 is an formula_152-primary ideal, the homomorphism formula_153 is faithfully flat if and only if the theorem of transition holds for it; that is, for each formula_154-primary ideal formula_155 of formula_51, formula_157

== Homological characterization using Tor functors ==
Flatness may also be expressed using the Tor functors, the left derived functors of the tensor product. A left formula_51-module formula_67 is flat if and only if
: formula_160 for all formula_161 and all right formula_51-modules formula_163).
In fact, it is enough to check that the first Tor term vanishes, i.e., &quot;M&quot; is flat if and only if
: formula_164
for any formula_51-module formula_166 or, even more restrictively, when formula_167 and formula_168 is any finitely generated ideal.

Using the Tor functor&#x27;s long exact sequences, one can then easily prove facts about a short exact sequence
: formula_169

If formula_170 and formula_171 are flat, then so is formula_172. Also, if formula_172 and formula_171 are flat, then so is formula_170. If formula_170 and formula_172 are flat, formula_171 need not be flat in general. However, if formula_170 is pure in formula_172 and formula_172 is flat, then formula_170 and formula_171 are flat.

== Flat resolutions ==
A flat resolution of a module formula_67 is a resolution of the form
: formula_185
where the formula_186 are all flat modules. Any free or projective resolution is necessarily a flat resolution. Flat resolutions can be used to compute the Tor functor.

The &quot;length&quot; of a finite flat resolution is the first subscript &quot;n&quot; such that formula_187 is nonzero and formula_188 for formula_189. If a module formula_67 admits a finite flat resolution, the minimal length among all finite flat resolutions of formula_67 is called its flat dimension and denoted formula_192. If formula_67 does not admit a finite flat resolution, then by convention the flat dimension is said to be infinite. As an example, consider a module formula_67 such that formula_195. In this situation, the exactness of the sequence formula_196 indicates that the arrow in the center is an isomorphism, and hence formula_67 itself is flat.

In some areas of module theory, a flat resolution must satisfy the additional requirement that each map is a flat pre-cover of the kernel of the map to the right. For projective resolutions, this condition is almost invisible: a projective pre-cover is simply an epimorphism from a projective module. These ideas are inspired from Auslander&#x27;s work in approximations. These ideas are also familiar from the more common notion of minimal projective resolutions, where each map is required to be a projective cover of the kernel of the map to the right. However, projective covers need not exist in general, so minimal projective resolutions are only of limited use over rings like the integers.

== Flat covers ==

While projective covers for modules do not always exist, it was speculated that for general rings, every module would have a flat cover, that is, every module &quot;M&quot; would be the epimorphic image of a flat module &quot;F&quot; such that every map from a flat module onto &quot;M&quot; factors through &quot;F&quot;, and any endomorphism of &quot;F&quot; over &quot;M&quot; is an automorphism. This flat cover conjecture was explicitly first stated in . The conjecture turned out to be true, resolved positively and proved simultaneously by L. Bican, R. El Bashir and E. Enochs. This was preceded by important contributions by P. Eklof, J. Trlifaj and J. Xu.

Since flat covers exist for all modules over all rings, minimal flat resolutions can take the place of minimal projective resolutions in many circumstances. The measurement of the departure of flat resolutions from projective resolutions is called &quot;relative homological algebra&quot;, and is covered in classics such as and in more recent works focussing on flat resolutions such as .

== In constructive mathematics ==
Flat modules have increased importance in constructive mathematics, where projective modules are less useful. For example, that all free modules are projective is equivalent to the full axiom of choice, so theorems about projective modules, even if proved constructively, do not necessarily apply to free modules. In contrast, no choice is needed to prove that free modules are flat, so theorems about flat modules can still apply.

<text>Parkes is a town in the Central West region of New South Wales, Australia. It is the main settlement in the local government area of Parkes Shire. Parkes had a population of 9,832 at the 2021 census.

Parkes is part of the traditional lands of the Wiradjuri people, the largest language group in NSW with a country of more than 120,000 square kilometres.

==History==
The Wiradjuri people have lived on the lands of the 3 rivers, including the Lachlan River, for more than 40,000 years.

The town of Parkes was part of the colonial expansion of the early 19th century, originally founded in 1853 as the settlement Currajong, named for the abundance of kurrajong trees in the local area by the settlers, but was then known as Bushman&#x27;s (from the local mine named Bushman&#x27;s Lead).

In August 1873, Henry Parkes (later Sir Henry) visited the area and in December 1873 the town was officially renamed Parkes in his honour. (Sir Henry Parkes is recognised as having played an instrumental role in the federation of Australia.)

&quot;Bushman&#x27;s Lead&quot; Post Office opened on 1 August 1872 and was renamed &quot;Parkes&quot; in 1873. In March 1883 the first local government, Parkes Municipal District (redesignated as Parkes Municipality March 1906), was proclaimed. In January 1981 it was amalgamated with Goobang Shire to create Parkes Shire.

The railway from Molong via Parkes to Forbes, was officially opened on 18 December 1893.

Parkes attracted significant attention during the gold rush of the 1870s onwards, and to this day modern mining companies have sites in the region.

In 1939, Parkes became a sister city with Coventry in the United Kingdom, Sir Henry Parkes birthplace.

===Newspapers===

Parkes&#x27; first newspaper was the &quot;Forbes and Parkes Gazette&quot;, founded and conducted for many years by H. H. Cooke. This was followed by the &quot;Parkes Independent&quot;. The &quot;Parkes Chronicle&quot; published by W. McNamara was amalgamated with the &quot;Parkes Independent&quot; which was subsequently purchased by Charles Reynolds; and later again, by George Washington Seaborn. In 1891 came the &quot;Parkes Examiner&quot;. The &quot;Examiner&quot; was still operating by 1901, edited by Alderman Harry Bowditch who acquired it in 1893. Commencing in 1894 was the &quot;Western Champion&quot; by M. J. Little and D. Cameron. At a later time, Cameron also acquired the &quot;Independent&quot;. In 1899 the &quot;Champion&quot; was purchased by 1899. Later journalistic ventures included the &quot;Western Reminder&quot; and the &quot;Western People&quot;. The &quot;Examiner&quot; was renamed the &quot;Parkes Post&quot; in 1923, before becoming part of the &quot;Champion&quot; company in 1926. By 1934, these were merged to become the &quot;Champion Post&quot;.

=== Military history ===

During World War II, Parkes was the location of RAAF Station Parkes, and RAAF No.18 Inland Aircraft Fuel Depot (IAFD), completed in 1942 and closed on 14 August 1944. Usually consisting of 4 tanks, 31 fuel depots were built across Australia for the storage and supply of aircraft fuel for the RAAF and the US Army Air Forces at a total cost of £900,000 ($1,800,000).

== Heritage listings ==
Parkes has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* 39 Currajong Street: Parkes Post Office
* May Street: Parkes railway station

==Parkes today==
With the presence of the nearby Parkes Observatory, Parkes has had an important role in the scientific community. In addition to local research conducted at the radio telescope, Parkes scientists have assisted NASA for several missions as a Southern Hemisphere relay and communications station. The movie &quot;The Dish&quot; was based somewhat loosely on the role the telescope played during the 1969 Apollo 11 Moon landing. &quot;The Dish&quot;, although set in Parkes, was largely filmed in Forbes&#x27; historic precinct. This is due to very few historic buildings remaining in Parkes. Parkes is also home to the Parkes Spacemen rugby league club.

Agriculture is one of the primary industries in the Parkes region, particularly cropping, sheep farming and cattle farming.

The area also features a copper and gold mine, Northparkes Mine, 27 km north-north-west of the town.

Parkes became a key country location after the completion of the railway to Broken Hill in 1927, serving as a hub for a great deal of passenger and freight transport until the 1980s. Unfortunately, as successive governments reduced the NSW country rail systems, this part of the economy was largely lost to the community.

Periodically governments and businesses have raised the topic of an &quot;inland port&quot; whereby Parkes Regional Airport would be expanded considerably to serve as a starting point for domestic and international freight destined for areas in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. Environmental studies are complete, development consents are in place, contracts have been exchanged, some properties have changed hands and studies are continuing.

Parkes Shire Council, with approval from the State Government, has rezoned 516 hectares of agricultural and industrial land on the western edge of the town for the development of the Parkes National Logistics Hub with an additional reserve of over 100 hectares. The site has been specifically designed for the 24-hour, 7-day-per-week operation of a multi-modal transport facility.

FCL runs a significant intermodal operation at Goobang Junction on Parkes&#x27; western outskirts. On 20 October 2006, Premier Morris Iemma opened Specialised Container Transport&#x27;s intermodal terminal nearby on a site. It has 5 km of rail sidings, a warehouse and about 40 staff. An even larger terminal to be sited nearby is also being promoted.

The Roads &amp; Maritime Services&#x27; Western Regional Office is located in Parkes. Essential Energy also is represented by a training and maintenance centre.

Main tourist attractions are the CSIRO Telescope 20 km north of town on the Newell Highway, Bushmans Hill, and the War Memorial Lookout. Nearby there is the Goobang National Park, and Peak Hill which features an Open Cut Mine that can be toured during holidays. There are also many great parks.

Parkes has a high percentage population of school age students and an associated number of schools. Parkes Public School was founded in 1876 under Archibald Booth as educator, Parkes East Public School and Middleton Public School are also in the area. Holy Family Catholic School and Parkes Christian School operate in the town, with Saint Patrick&#x27;s School Trundle and St Joseph&#x27;s School, Peak Hill also operating the shire.

Parkes High School is the main public high school for the town. Parkes Christian School offers education for students from Kindergarten to Year 10 in 2013, extending to Year 11 in 2014 and Year 12 in 2015. Many Parkes students also attend the nearby Red Bend Catholic College in Forbes, some 35 km south.

==Climate==
Parkes has a subtropical climate, with significant temperature variations between summer and winter. Under the Köppen climate classification, Parkes lies in the transitional zone between humid subtropical (&quot;Cfa&quot;) and cold semi-arid (&quot;Bsk&quot;) climates. Summer maximum temperatures average out at , however frequently reach each year. Winters are cool and partly cloudy, with cold fronts bringing periods of light, misty rain with low maximum temperatures, and rarely even snow. Rainfall in spring and summer usually falls as thunderstorms, with an annual average of of rainfall. Extreme temperatures have ranged from . Parkes is considerably sunny, having around 135.0 clear days annually.
==Transport==
Parkes has a local bus service provided by Western Road Liners, which acquired Harris Bus Lines in March 2006. The weekly &quot;Indian Pacific&quot; passes through but does not stop at Parkes. The &quot;Outback Xplorer&quot; service, run by NSW TrainLink, which heads to Broken Hill on Mondays and Sydney on Tuesdays does stop. Parkes railway station is situated on the Broken Hill railway line, and opened in 1893. A smaller station served Parkes Racecourse between 1923 and 1937. Parkes Airport is served regular air services to Sydney operated by Rex Airlines. The airport is located approximately five kilometres east of the central business district.

Parkes is located on the Australian transcontinental railway line, and the Newell Highway linking Victoria to Queensland.

<doc id="492721" wikidata="Q110283" url="?curid=492721" title="Fram (ship)">
<text>Fram (&quot;Forward&quot;) is a ship that was used in expeditions of the Arctic and Antarctic regions by the Norwegian explorers Fridtjof Nansen, Otto Sverdrup, Oscar Wisting, and Roald Amundsen between 1893 and 1912. It was designed and built by the Scottish-Norwegian shipwright Colin Archer for Fridtjof Nansen&#x27;s 1893 Arctic expedition in which the plan was to freeze &quot;Fram&quot; into the Arctic ice sheet and float with it over the North Pole.

&quot;Fram&quot; is preserved as a museum ship at the Fram Museum in Oslo, Norway.

==Construction==
Nansen&#x27;s ambition was to explore the Arctic farther north than anyone else—to the North Pole, if possible. To do that, he would have to deal with a problem that many sailing on the polar ocean had encountered before him: the freezing ice could crush a ship. Nansen&#x27;s idea was to build a ship that could survive the pressure, not by pure strength, but because it would be of a shape designed to let the ice push the ship up, so it would &quot;float&quot; on top of the ice.
&quot;Fram&quot; is a three-masted schooner with a total length of and width of . The ship is both unusually wide and unusually shallow in order to better withstand the forces of pressing ice. A disadvantage of this design is that it rolled more than most ships in heavy seas.

Nansen commissioned the shipwright Colin Archer from Larvik to construct a vessel with these characteristics. &quot;Fram&quot; was built with an outer layer of greenheart wood to withstand the ice and with almost no keel to handle the shallow waters Nansen expected to encounter. The rudder and propeller were designed to be retracted. The ship was also carefully insulated to allow the crew to live on board for up to five years. The ship also included a windmill, which ran a generator to provide electric power for lighting by electric arc lamps.

Initially, &quot;Fram&quot; was fitted with a steam engine. Prior to Amundsen&#x27;s expedition to the South Pole in 1910, the engine was replaced with a diesel engine, a first for polar exploration vessels. The new engine allowed for a longer voyage without refueling.
The ship was launched on 26 October 1892.

==Expeditions==
&quot;Fram&quot; was used in several expeditions:
===Nansen&#x27;s 1893–1896 Arctic expedition===

Wreckage found at Greenland from , which was lost off Siberia, and driftwood found in the regions of Svalbard and Greenland, suggested that an ocean current flowed beneath the Arctic ice sheet from east to west, bringing driftwood from the Siberian region to Svalbard and further west. Nansen had &quot;Fram&quot; built in order to explore this theory.
He undertook an expedition that came to last three years. When Nansen realised that &quot;Fram&quot; would not reach the North Pole directly by the force of the current, he and Hjalmar Johansen set out to reach it on skis. After reaching 86° 14&#x27; north, he had to turn back to spend the winter at Franz Josef Land. Nansen and Johansen survived on walrus and polar bear meat and blubber. Finally meeting British explorers, the Jackson–Harmsworth expedition, they arrived back in Norway only days before the &quot;Fram&quot; also returned there. The ship had spent nearly three years trapped in the ice, reaching 85° 57&#x27; N.

===Sverdrup&#x27;s 1898–1902 Canadian Arctic islands expedition===
In 1898, Otto Sverdrup, who had brought &quot;Fram&quot; back on the first Arctic voyage, led a scientific expedition to the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. &quot;Fram&quot; was slightly modified for this journey, its freeboard being increased. &quot;Fram&quot; left harbour on 24 June 1898, with 17 men on board. Their aim was to chart the lands of the Arctic Islands, and to sample the geology, flora and fauna. The expeditions lasted until 1902, leading to charts covering , more than any other Arctic expedition.

===Amundsen&#x27;s 1910–1912 South Pole expedition===

&quot;Fram&quot; was used by Roald Amundsen in his southern polar expedition from 1910 to 1912, the first to reach the South Pole, during which &quot;Fram&quot; reached 78° 41&#x27; S.

==Preservation of &quot;Fram&quot;==
The ship was left to decay in storage from 1912 until the late 1920s, when Lars Christensen, Otto Sverdrup and Oscar Wisting initiated efforts to preserve it via the Fram Committee. In 1935, the ship was installed in the Fram Museum, where it now stands.

<doc id="492759" wikidata="Q5655230" url="?curid=492759" title="Late termination of pregnancy">
<text>Late termination of pregnancy, also referred to politically as third trimester abortion, describes the termination of pregnancy by inducing labor during a late stage of gestation. In this context, &quot;late&quot; is not precisely defined, and different medical publications use varying gestational age thresholds. As of 2015, in the United States, more than 90% of abortions occur before the 13th week, 1.3% take place after the 21st week, and less than 1% occur after 24 weeks.
Reasons for late terminations of pregnancy include circumstances where a pregnant woman&#x27;s health is at risk or when birth defects, such as lethal fetal abnormalities, have been detected. 

In the United States, the mortality rate for legal abortions overall is less than 1 in 100,000 procedures performed. The rate of mortality and morbidity increases with the gestational age of the fetus, so patients who have decided to have an abortion are strongly encouraged to get it early. Still, later abortion is not associated with any greater net negative physical or mental health outcomes (including mortality) than full-term pregnancy and childbirth in the United States.
Late termination of pregnancy is more controversial than abortion in general. All countries in Europe only permit abortion later in pregnancy (after 10-14 weeks in most countries, 18 weeks in Sweden and Iceland, and 24 weeks in the Netherlands and Great Britain) if specific circumstances are present, generally when the pregnancy represents a serious danger to the life, or to the physical or mental health of the woman, or when a serious malformation or anomaly of the fetus is diagnosed.

==Definition==
A late termination of pregnancy often refers to an induced ending of pregnancy after the 20th week of gestation, i.e. after a fetal age (time since conception) of about 18 weeks. The exact point when an abortion is considered late-term, however, is not clearly defined. In three articles published in 1998 in the same issue of the &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot; (JAMA), two chose the 20th week of gestation and one chose the 28th week of gestation as the point where an abortion procedure would be considered late-term.

In the United States, the point at which an abortion becomes late-term is often related to fetal viability (ability of the fetus to survive outside the uterus). Thus, late-term abortions are sometimes referred to as post-viability abortions.

===Viability===
There is no sharp limit of development, age, or weight at which a fetus becomes viable. A 2015 study found that even with active treatment, no infants born at less than 22 weeks survived, but an infant born at 21 weeks and one day in April of 2021 did survive his premature birth. At 23 weeks survival without severe impairment is less than 2%, and at 25 weeks, up to 30% might survive without severe impairment. According to studies between 2003 and 2005, 20 to 35 percent of babies born at 24 weeks of gestation survived, while 50 to 70 percent of babies born at 25 weeks, and more than 90 percent born at 26 to 27 weeks, survived. Because the chance of survival is variable based on interventions available and the weight and sex of the fetus, there is no consensus on viability. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists reports that 23% of abortion providers offer abortions at 20 weeks of gestation and later, most often using a method called dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E).

==Incidence==

*Australia: , South Australia is the only Australian state or territory to keep reliable abortion statistics. During 2012, 92% of abortions were performed before 14 weeks&#x27; gestation, 6% between 14 and 20 weeks, and 2% (n=96) at a later stage. Of the 96 abortions carried out beyond 20 weeks, 53 were due to actual or probable fetal abnormality.
*Canada: During the year 2019, approximately 87% of abortions occurred by 12 weeks, with 1.17% occurring after 21 weeks.
*England and Wales: In 2015, 8% of abortions occurred after 12 weeks; 0.1% occurred at or over 24 weeks.
* New Zealand: In 2003, 2.03% of induced abortions were done between weeks 16 and 19, and 0.56% were done over 20 weeks.
*Norway: In 2005, 2.28% of induced abortions were performed between 13 and 16 weeks, 1.24% of abortions between 17 and 20 weeks, and 0.20% over 21 weeks. Between February 15, 2010, and December 1, 2011, a total number of ten abortions were performed between 22 and 24 weeks. These have been declared illegal by The Norwegian Directorate of Health. Women who seek an abortion after the 12-week time limit must apply to a special medical assessment board – called an &quot;abortion board&quot; (Norwegian: or ) – that will determine whether or not to grant them an abortion.
*Scotland: In 2005, 6.1% of abortions were done between 14 and 17 weeks, while 1.6% were performed over 18 weeks.
*Sweden: In 2005, 5.6% of abortions were carried out between 12 and 17 weeks, and 0.8% at or greater than 18 weeks.
*Switzerland: In 2016, 10% of abortions performed after the legal term were carried out after week 21 (a total of 36 cases). Of these cases 86% were carried out due to physical problems with the child or mother.
*United States: In 2003, from data collected in those areas that sufficiently reported gestational age, it was found that 6.2% of abortions were conducted between 13 and 15 weeks, 4.2% between 16 and 20 weeks, and 1.4% at or after 21 weeks. In 2014, the CDC reported that 1.3% of reported abortions (5,578) were performed at 21 weeks of gestation or later.

== Reasons==

===United States===
Reasons for late terminations of pregnancy include when a pregnant woman&#x27;s health is at risk or when lethal fetal abnormalities have been detected.

A 2013 study found, after excluding abortion &quot;on grounds of fetal anomaly or life endangerment&quot;, that women seeking late abortions &quot;fit at least one of five profiles: They were raising children alone, were depressed or using illicit substances, were in conflict with a male partner or experiencing domestic violence, had trouble deciding and then had access problems, or were young and nulliparous&quot;. The study concluded that &quot;bans on abortion after 20 weeks will disproportionately affect young women and women with limited financial resources&quot;.

=== England and Wales ===
The NHS records the reasons given for abortions at all stages of development. In 2015, 2,877 abortions were performed at 20 weeks or above, and only 230 of these at or beyond 24 weeks gestation. Of all abortions at 20 weeks or above, 23 (0.8%) were performed to save the life of the pregnant woman, 1,801 (63%) were performed for mental or physical health reasons, and 1046 (36%) were performed because of fetal abnormalities.

==Legal restrictions==
As of 1998, among the 152 most populous countries, 54 either banned abortion entirely or permitted it only to save the life of the pregnant woman.

On the other hand, as of 1998, 49 of the 152 most populous countries allowed abortion without restriction as to reason, but 44 of these required specific justification after a particular gestational age:

* 12 weeks (Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cuba, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Georgia, Greece, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Mongolia, Norway, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Tunisia, Turkey, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan)
* 13 weeks (Italy)
* 14 weeks (Argentina, Austria, Cambodia, France, Germany, Hungary, Romania and Spain)
* 18 weeks (Sweden)
* 22 weeks (North Macedonia)
* 24 weeks (Singapore, Netherlands)
* viability (to some extent the United States)
* no limit unless the child is born during said attempted abortion (Canada, some states in the United States, China, and South Korea)

Dutch Criminal Code defines the &quot;viability&quot; of a fetus to 24 weeks, but doctors &quot;de facto&quot; limit on-request abortions to 22 weeks as a margin of error.

As of 2011 among those countries that allowed abortion without restriction as to reason, the gestational limits for such abortions on request were: 37 countries set a gestational limit of 12 weeks, 7 countries of 14 weeks, 4 did not set limits, 3 at viability, 3 at 10 weeks, one at 90 days, one at 8 weeks, one at 18 weeks, and one at 24 weeks. In addition, abortion in Australia, and, to a certain extent, abortion in the United States, is regulated at state/territory level, and laws vary by region.

In these countries, abortions after the general gestational age limit are allowed only under restricted circumstances, which include, depending on country, risk to the woman&#x27;s life, physical or mental health, fetal malformation, cases where the pregnancy was the result of rape, or poor socio-economic conditions. For instance, in Italy, abortion is allowed on request up until 90 days, after which it is allowed only if the pregnancy or childbirth pose a threat to the woman&#x27;s life, a risk to physical health of the woman, a risk to mental health of the woman; if there is a risk of fetal malformation; or if the pregnancy is the result of rape or other sexual crime. Denmark provides a wider range of reasons, including social and economic ones, which can be invoked by a woman who seeks an abortion after 12 weeks.

Abortions at such stages must in general be approved by a doctor or a special committee, unlike early abortions which are performed on demand. The ease with which the doctor or the committee allows a late term abortion varies significantly by country, and is often influenced by the social and religious views prevalent in that region.

Some countries, like Canada, China (mainland only) and Vietnam have no legal limit on when an abortion can be performed.

===United States===

The United States Supreme Court decisions on abortion, including &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, allow states to impose more restrictions on post-viability abortions than during the earlier stages of pregnancy.

As of December 2014, forty-three states had bans on late-term abortions that were not facially unconstitutional under &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; or enjoined by court order. In addition, the Supreme Court in the case of &quot;Gonzales v. Carhart&quot; ruled that Congress may ban certain late-term abortion techniques, &quot;both previability and postviability&quot;, as it had done in banning intact dilation and extraction with the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003.

The Supreme Court has held that bans must include exceptions for threats to the woman&#x27;s life, physical health, and mental health, but four states allow late-term abortions only when the woman&#x27;s life is at risk; four allow them when the woman&#x27;s life or physical health is at risk, but use a definition of health that abortion-rights organizations believe is impermissibly narrow. Note that just because a portion of a state&#x27;s law is found to be unconstitutional does not mean that the entire law will be deemed unconstitutional: &quot;[I]nvalidating the statute entirely is not always necessary or justified, for lower courts may be able to render narrower declaratory and injunctive relief,&quot; meaning the court could declare that only those parts of the law that are violative of the Constitution are invalid (declaratory relief), or that the court can prohibit the state from enforcing those portions of the law (injunctive relief).

Eighteen states prohibit abortion after a certain number of weeks&#x27; gestation (usually 22 weeks from the last menstrual period). The U.S. Supreme Court held in &quot;Webster v. Reproductive Health Services&quot; that a statute may create &quot;a presumption of viability&quot; after a certain number of weeks, in which case the physician must be given an opportunity to rebut the presumption by performing tests. Because this provision is not explicitly written into these state laws, as it was in the Missouri law examined in &quot;Webster&quot;, abortion-rights organizations believe that such a state law is unconstitutional, but only &quot;to the extent that it prohibits pre-viability abortions&quot;.

Ten states (although Florida&#x27;s enforcement of such laws are under permanent injunction) require a second physician&#x27;s approval before a late-term abortion can be performed. The U.S. Supreme Court struck down a requirement of &quot;confirmation by two other physicians&quot; (rather than one other physician) because &quot;acquiescence by co-practitioners has no rational connection with a patient&#x27;s needs and unduly infringes on the physician&#x27;s right to practice&quot;. Abortion-rights organizations, such as the Guttmacher Institute, posit that some of these state laws are unconstitutional, based on these and other Supreme Court rulings, at least to the extent that these state laws require approval of a second or third physician.

Thirteen states have laws that require a second physician to be present during late-term abortion procedures in order to treat a fetus if born alive. The Court has held that a doctor&#x27;s right to practice is not infringed by requiring a second physician to be present at abortions performed after viability in order to assist in the case of a living fetus. It is not common for live infants to be born after an abortion at any stage in pregnancy.

===Live birth===

In 2019, a US Senate Bill entitled the &quot;Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act&quot; raised the issue of live birth after abortion. The bill would mandate that medical providers resuscitate neonates delivered showing signs of life during an abortion process. During the debate around this issue, US Republicans alleged that medical providers &quot;execute&quot; live-born babies. Existing US laws would punish execution as homicide. Furthermore, US abortion experts refute the claim that a &quot;born-alive&quot; fetus is a common event and oppose enactment of laws that would mandate resuscitation against the wishes of the parents.

1.3% of abortions occur after 21 weeks of pregnancy in the US. Although it is very uncommon, women undergoing surgical abortion after this gestational age sometimes give birth to a fetus that may survive briefly. The periviable period is considered to be between 20 and 25 weeks gestation. Long-term survival is possible after 22 weeks. However, odds of long-term survival between 22 and 23 weeks are 2–3 percent and odds of survival between 23 and 24 weeks are 20 percent. &quot;Intact survival&quot;, which means survival of a neonate without subsequent damage to organs such as the brain or bowel is 1% at 22 weeks and 13% at 23 weeks. Survival odds increase with increasing gestational age.

If medical staff observe signs of life, they may be required to provide care: emergency medical care if the child has a good chance of survival and palliative care if not. Induced fetal demise before termination of pregnancy after 20–21 weeks gestation is recommended by some sources to avoid this and to comply with the US Partial Birth Abortion Ban. Induced fetal demise does not improve the safety of an abortion procedure and may incur risks to the health of the woman having the abortion.

== Methods ==
There are at least four medical procedures associated with late-term abortions:
* Dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E)
* Early labor induction (sometimes called &quot;induction abortion&quot;)
* Intact dilation and extraction (IDX or D&amp;X), sometimes referred to as &quot;&quot;partial-birth abortion&quot;&quot;
* Hysterotomy abortion

<text>Wheels (1971) is a novel by Arthur Hailey, concerning the automobile industry and the day-to-day pressures involved in its operation.

==Novel==
The book&#x27;s plot lines follow many of the topical issues of the 1970s, including race relations, corporate politics, and business ethics. The auto company of the novel, National Motors Corporation, is the little-disguised American Motors Corporation (AMC) that is the smallest domestic automaker. Adam Trenton is the ambitious executive in charge of project development with the goal of moving the company into making &quot;cutting-edge&quot; cars of the future. The characters are company insiders with &quot;passions&quot; of those &quot;caught up in the world&#x27;s fiercest power game.&quot;

==Television miniseries==
The novel was made into a TV miniseries in 1978 directed by Jerry London and starring Rock Hudson (as Adam Trenton), Lee Remick (as Erica Trenton), Blair Brown (as Barbara Lipton), Ralph Bellamy (as Lowell Baxter), Anthony Franciosa (as Smokey Stevenson), John Beck (as Peter Flodenhale), Scott Brady (as Matt Zaleski), Tim O&#x27;Connor (as Hub Hewitson), Gerald S. O&#x27;Loughlin (as Rusty Horton), Jessica Walter (as Ursula), Lisa Eilbacher (as Jody Horton), James Carroll Jordan (as Kirk Trenton), Howard McGillin (as Greg Trenton), Marj Dusay (as Caroline Horton), Fred Williamson (as Leonard Wingate), and Harold Sylvester (as Rollie Knight). 

The car presented in Hailey&#x27;s novel, the Orion, was called the &quot;Hawk&quot; in the miniseries. The 1978 mini-series used a 1968 AMC Javelin as the basis for the fictional car. The rear end of the Javelin was shortened and filled with foam to a new design while the doors were changed to gull-wing types.

<text>The commune () is the third-level divisions of Haiti. The 10 departments have 42 arrondissements, which are divided into 147 communes and then into 571 communal sections.

Communes are roughly equivalent to civil townships and incorporated municipalities.

==Administration==
Each commune has a municipal council (&quot;conseil municipal&quot;) compound of three members elected by the inhabitants of the commune for a 4-year term. The municipal council is led by a president often called &quot;mayor&quot;.Each commune has a municipal assembly (&quot;assemblée municipale&quot;) who assists the council in its work.
The members of the assembly are also elected for 4 years.

Each commune is ruled by a municipality.

<text>Kohtalon kirja (&quot;The Book of Fate&quot;, though the website also uses &quot;The Booke of Fate&quot;) is a Finnish film released in 2003. The movie was a DVD release, though it premiered in a theater.

The film is a multi-genre episode movie. It&#x27;s frequently described as a &quot;Horror/Western/War/Action/Sci-fi&quot; movie, as it covers all of those genres in different episodes. The frequent themes are horror and fantasy, too.

The movie was conceived and directed by Tommi Lepola and Tero Molin. Many of the makers, including Lepola and the producer Ilkka Niemi, jointly made the movie as their graduation work from Tampereen ammattikorkeakoulu. The lead roles were given to freshly graduated acting students. As a graduation work, it is vastly larger than most such projects.

In addition to these, many well-known Finnish actors, such as Vesa Vierikko, Santeri Kinnunen and Åke Lindman came to make an appearance in the movie. Many of them found it interesting to work on a movie like this, because such movies are not typically made in Finland.

== Plot ==

The movie is divided into five distinct episodes, each representing a different genre and having their own subplot.

Opening narration explains how the Book of Fate came to be. It is a book that is somehow able to change reality. Another civilization beyond the stars got it, and made a pen to control the future - by writing to the book, things could change. This led to a war, but the book vanished. It later reappeared on Earth in order to give another chance to a chosen soul.

The movie starts with a horror episode in Transylvania, where brothers, one of whom is a priest, are looking for a cross that can cure their sister who has been bitten by a vampire. As they find the cross, the priest also finds an ancient, strange book. Then they are suddenly assaulted by vampires. Just as everything seems to be lost and the vampire is about to defeat him, the book gives the priest another chance, and the scene changes.

The next scene starts with a gunfight duel in a typical Western setting. A lonesome bounty hunter - who quite resembles in appearance the priest - defeats a crook and finds the book again. He goes to a town to collect the money, and ends up in a gunfight where he&#x27;s unable to save an innocent bystander who gets caught in crossfire. Three more crooks arrive to the town to pressure the sheriff to release their friend from the prison. The bounty hunter ends up in a massive gunfight, and it appears that he&#x27;s getting killed, but once again, the book intervenes.

The next appearance of the book - and a soldier who again resembles the priest - is in the Winter War - Battle of Kollaa, Christmas Day 1939, to be specific. The soldier tries to sneak past a Soviet post, but gets pinned down in an enemy fire. The book intervenes just as a hand grenade is thrown at him.

The next scene opens in modern-day Tampere, in a typical action movie setting. A mad professor has developed a virus that kills everyone once released. The special agents, led by another familiar figure, steal it and its vaccine, but end up roughed up and detained in a distant manor where one of the mad professor&#x27;s underlings is studying the Book of Fate. After a heroic escape attempt, and accidentally shooting his friend who was on the line of fire with an enemy, he gets stuck in Särkänniemi where the mad professor is about to release the virus.

The next scene, set on a space freighter, starts in virtual reality; a cyborg, again resembling the priest of the past, is playing a video game. This time, however, the priest&#x27;s spirit is able to appear in the VR projection, and tries to warn the cyborg that the book can be used to prevent the deaths of innocent people - as has happened before. The cyborg&#x27;s job is to take the book to a group of aliens and he spends good time studying it as he prepares for the journey. As he goes in cryosleep, an alien lady appears in the ship, and the priest&#x27;s spirit awakens the cyborg, and he is able to stop the alien lady from defacing the book. A representative of the aliens whom the book is being delivered to calls, and tells how dangerous this lady is, and the cyborg is to kill her by depressurizing the ship - sacrificing himself in the process to save millions of lives. The priest&#x27;s spirit notes too late that, as the cyborg is about to die, he has made the wrong choice again. The alien representative who contacted them earlier were the true antagonists, and the book, and the pen, are about to fall in his hands. The cyborg is, however, able to write a change of reality to the book at the very last moment.

The story then unravels itself: The cyborg reunites with his long-dead wife who lives again, the special agent stops the mad professor, the soldier saves the day, the gunfight is won, and the priest is able to destroy the vampire and save his sister.

==Awards==
The movie won the Best International Feature Film award in the New York International Independent Film and Video Festival in September 2003.

<text>Kingston is a town in the Shire of Hepburn, Victoria, Australia. At the , Kingston had a population of 190.

== Geology ==
The geology of the Kingston area comprises an uplifted and fractured Palaeozoic bedrock landscape carved by natural forces. The resultant ancient valleys were in-filled with sediments during the Tertiary Age. These are overlain or interrupted by layers of basalt flows from volcanoes during the Neogene period.

Shale and sandstone layers were formed millions of years ago, around 435 to 500 million years ago. During a period about 345 to 395 million years ago, there was a major mountain-forming event that created gold-bearing quartz veins known as &quot;reefs.&quot;

Erosion during the Oligocene–Pliocene period, which occurred about 26 to 2 million years ago, led to the formation of gold deposits in the ancient valleys of the upper Loddon River.

Around 2 million years ago to less than 30,000 years ago, there was a period of volcanic activity that filled these valleys and covered the gold deposits with layers of gravel, sand, silt, clay, and some lignite. These deposits were mined extensively for gold during the mid to late 1800s in the Creswick area. Miners followed these deposits under the basalt layers, which they called &#x27;deep leads.&#x27;

Within and around the area, at least 15 volcanic eruption points formed small cones. The eruptions produced deposits of scoria, ash, and tuff near these cones. In between eruptions, clay layers formed between the basalt flows. Mount Kooroocheang, known locally as Mount Smeaton, just north of Kingston, is the largest volcano in the Uplands, rising 200 m above the plain to an elevation of 676 m. Young cones near Ballarat, Mount Warrenheip and Mount Buninyong, are visible from Spring Hill.

The basalt layer, which is up to 100 metres thick over the ancient valleys, acts as a significant underground water source in the Kingston area. The fertile soil covering the basalts, particularly around the volcanic cones such as Kingston&#x27;s Spring Hill, is excellent for agriculture, and potatoes are the dominant crop in those areas.

Goulburn-Murray Water administers the Loddon Highlands WSPA Groundwater Management Plan under section 32A(5) of the &quot;Water Act 1989&quot; of the Victorian Government.

== Climate ==
The Australian Bureau of Meteorology provides climate data for Creswick, 10km SW of Kingston.
== History ==

=== First inhabitants ===
The Dja Dja Wurrung People are the Traditional Owners of the district of Kingston. Their country extended over lands from close to Bendigo to Avoca, from the Great Dividing Range to near Pyramid Hill and they were displaced by white settlement, with some retreating to Parker&#x27;s Protectorate at Franklinford. 

=== European settlement ===
Kingston Post Office opened on 11 October 1858. A polling place for the Creswick electoral district was first opened in the town in October 1860. It became the administrative centre of the Creswick Shire until the merging of the Shire and Borough of Creswick on 29 May 1934.

=== Gold ===
Kingston was once a thriving gold mining town during the Victorian Gold Rush. 

An 1876 report in &quot;The Argus&quot; details the gold rush at Kingston when valuable gold deposits were discovered beneath the basalt in the area, at a reachable depth. It records how by the mid-1870s, many working in the Kingston mines had even transported their entire houses to new locations; McLellan, a Scot, ingeniously moved houses using a large triangular frame with three low wheels. They lifted the house onto this frame with screw-jacks, and reinforced it to prevent damage during haulage by a team of eight to ten horses traveling at about 13km per day. The house would be made habitable again at its new destination. 

Those who didn&#x27;t move their houses flocked to Creswick on Saturday evenings to catch a train to Ballarat and returned early on Monday morning. Long-time resident miners generally owned their houses, and with plenty of job opportunities and improved living conditions compared to the earlier rough times; carpenters and masons were earning 10 shillings per day, as demand for their services increased. Bricklayers were paid 11s. per day, mostly occupied with constructing the state school, which would soon be completed. The council was taking steps to enhance the water supply in the borough, drawn from Bullarook Forest, and planning to build a new town-hall with funds borrowed from £5,000 bringing sustained employment opportunities for these laborers for some time to come.

Between Creswick and Kingston, in Broomfield Gully, alluvial mining was being conducted from the 1860s, before a company called the Nelson sunk a shaft to a depth of 27.5m until the mine flooded in 1875. Slaty Creek&#x27;s Working Miners&#x27; Quartz-mining Company mine on the other hand, was abandoned when the operation did not yield profits, but with discoveries in Kingston, the mine was revived, and a 10-head stamping battery was installed by Charles Mathews, formerly associated with the Cornish Company in Daylesford.

Kingston is at the foot of the round-topped Spring Hill which rises 518m above sea level, and was cleared of dense bush to its summit for cultivation before it became the site of intensive gold-mining. The basalt plains extending northwards from Spring Hill towards Smeaton Plains and Charlotte Plains, between Maryborough and Carisbrook, had been taken up by squatters and farmers. Carter, Brawn, and Graham discovered gold deposits beneath in around 1874. Two of them had previously farmed land they purchased with proceeds of their mining in Daylesford, while Graham, known for the tragic story of his children lost in the bush, was also involved. Due to rust affecting his wheat crops, Carter found himself unable to sustain his farming after the harvest of 1873. As a result, he returned to mining. Testing the ground beneath the basalt on his farm, he sunk a shaft in Broomfield Gully, going through more than 33 metres of rock to reach the gold-bearing layer at 46 metres. The discovery yielded an extraordinarily rich find of 300 ounces of gold from just one horse-operated mining machine, seemingly originating from the Armagh Reef between the claim and Spring Hill. Subsequently, that claim was depleted, as it appeared that the gold lead extended into what is now was then called the western gutter, leading to its discovery.

The individual credited as the father of Kingston is William Bell, a farmer from Bullarook, close to Hexham. He had been exploring the region for years, alternating between farming and mining, and convinced that gold lay beneath the basalt on the Spring Hill Plains. Carter&#x27;s discovery triggered significant speculation. Bell purchased an 80-acre paddock where he had found gold around 11 years earlier, paying £150 for it. He promptly sold the lease for mining purposes for £500 and a royalty. This paddock is where the Baron Rothschild mine was established, with a shaft passing through 52m of rock into auriferous reef to 60m in May 1874. Managed by Robert Veitch, previously of Daylesford, the mine employed over 80 workers and had yielded 7,886 ounces of high-quality gold by 5 November 1875. The fortunate Bell reportedly received £3,000 in dividends and half-royalties from this mine, with Russell, also of Kingston, receiving the other half. Bell believed he would gain at least £4,000 more before the claim was exhausted. In Carter&#x27;s claim, closer to Spring Hill, gold was found at 150 feet, having passed through 110 feet of rock.

Most of the mines in this area were owned by local farmers and residents of Kingston or Creswick, who kept the yields of their claims confidential; however the &quot;Argus&quot; reporter, investigating actual sales of gold to the banks in Creswick from leading claims, found that;Richardson&#x27;s Western commenced to get gold on the 2nd January 1875, and up to the 6th of November had obtained 7,961oz., employing 80 men. I see that in the week ending November 1 [1875] it gave 193oz, and in the following week 381½oz. In the same weeks the Baron yielded 298¾oz. and 381½oz. respectively. Robinson&#x27;s Free-hold began to raise gold in August, 1874, and up to the 6th of November last had raised 7,096oz, its weekly yield averaging about 120oz. This company has paid dividends to the amount of £2 12s. upon 6,000 shares, while Richardson&#x27;s Western has paid £3 4s. per share on the same number of shares. In the month (November) previous to that in which I visited the district the 10 mines which are in gold were distributing in dividends from £1,500 to £2,000 per week. As much as 1,100oz. has been obtained in a week from Richardson&#x27;s Western, and 1,000oz. from the Baron Rothschild.

Nuggets have been found in these claims varying in size from a few ounces up to 120oz.-one which turned the scale at that figure having been obtained only a few weeks ago in the last-mentioned mine. Among the mines obtaining gold and not already referred to are Bunyan&#x27;s Freehold, which in the first week in November gave 121oz., and in that which followed 192oz; First Chance, 31½oz. ; Kingston-park 26½oz.; Lewers&#x27;s Western, 21½oz ; Southern 13oz.; Dan Ryan&#x27;s, and Kingston-park. Lewers&#x27;s Freehold, on Lewers&#x27;s Lead, has been worked out, gold to the value of £36,000 having been taken out of it. A company known as the De Murska - and therefore of very late formation - are sinking at a considerable distance north from Spring, hill, and expect to find in their ground not one, but the junction of several leads. The Ristori and the O&#x27;Loghlen comprise three blocks of large extent, a portion of the Seven-hills estate, bought by Mr. Rossell, of Kingston, Mr. Parkins, and some Ballarat men, from Mr. Alexander Wilson, of the Wimmera, and both expect to leach gold before long. So much confidence is felt in the district in the value of the known leads that a few weeks ago £1,000 was given for 114 acres of a freehold known as Dyke&#x27;s, With a royalty of 7½%, and an under taking that work would be begun in December last. The leads, so far as known, are three in number, all apparently having their rise in Spring-hill, and growing deeper as they travel towards the plains.Kingston once had a large coach and vehicle building manufacturer, Barker Brothers, up to 10 ten hotels, a flour mill and numerous chaff mills. After the miners left so did the industry and in 1976 the railway station and the Creswick–Daylesford train line closed.

== Population ==
Though small, the population of Kingston grew by nearly 7% in the 5 years since the 2016 census when it had 177 people; at the , Kingston had a population of 190, or 1.14% of the 16,609 population total for the shire, and older than most in the region; the median age being 56.

== Economy ==
The area&#x27;s rich red volcanic soil and good rainfall support agricultural industries including potatoes (typically grown for food processor McCains), sheep and wheat. An illustrated article in the &quot;Australasian&quot; in 1904 noted that; The districts of Newlyn, Dean, Kingston, and Smeaton are among the most noted farming districts in Victoria. The soil is volcanic, and of great richness. The country is charmingly picturesque. Hay and potatoes are the chief crops cultivated, and the fattening of sheep and cattle is largely carried on. Red clover is a pasture crop widely grown, and it thrives wonderfully well throughout these districts. [Hay]stack building has been carried to great perfection. Haystacks meet the eye everywhere, and such stacks are worth travelling miles to see. They are trim, well built, and beautifully thatched. The Smeaton Agricultural Society recently offered a series of prizes for the best built stacks. Ballarat to Daylesford railway line which opened in 1887 is now the Heritage-listed Daylesford-Creswick Railway Reserve and walking path It ran from Daylesford, through Musk Vale, Sailors Falls, Leonards Hill, Korweinguboora, Rocklyn, Newlyn, Kingston, Allendale, Broomfield to Creswick. The Allendale to Newlyn section of the railway was closed in 1976.

In 1921, after the district agricultural show was held at Allendale, some members proposed relocating future shows to Kingston, and subsequently a plot of land was acquired near its railway station with Mr. W. H. Gore, the shire engineer, overseeing the layout. In 1922, all the structures and equipment, including the grandstand, were relocated to this new location using a Handley-Page steam engine. Intense debate during the annual meeting in 1923 resolved to change the name to the &#x27;Kingston, Smeaton, Newlyn, and Dean Agricultural Society.&#x27;

=== Decline ===
Businesses, shops, and the primary school in 2004, closed after trade dwindled, initiating that vicious circle of decline faced by many country towns that is exacerbated by the consequent need to travel greater distances for basic services.

=== Revival ===
Holiday and business accommodation in Kingston is increasingly provided by bed and breakfast establishments as well as by the Commercial Hotel, reopened after a 12-year closure. The location of Kingston between Daylesford and Ballarat, and its undulating rural outlook, has made it attractive to retirees, and also for city folk looking to buy weekenders or holiday houses, bringing new investment and stimulating the local economy.

== Heritage ==
=== Gold rush relics ===
Structures from the gold rush era remain. The Berry Consols Company ran one of the most prosperous mines in the Berry Lead system, ranking second only to Madam Berry in gold production. The remains at No. 1 shaft were classified by Victorian Heritage in 1988 as significant at a state level, and along with extant engineering drawings of the installation, reveal the layout of the pumping and winding machinery, which were powered by basic horizontal steam engines. This plant was among the final installations of its kind on the lead system, as later needs demanded the use of more efficient and powerful compound engines. 

The Madam Berry West Gold Mining Co. Mine &amp; Machinery Site No.1 was located to the west of the Madam Berry leasehold and to the east of the Creswick-Lawrence road. It operated on a lucrative section of the Australasian lead, which was one of the two primary branches of the Berry Lead system. Among all the mines on the lead system, this mine ranked as the third most productive (following the Madam Berry and Berry Consols mines) and proved to be one of the most profitable during the 1890s. It employed a workforce ranging from 180 to 350 individuals. The No. 1 shaft has an extensive mullock dump and engine foundations indicate machinery typical of that period. It was classified in August 1988.

The Lord Harry Gold Mining Co Mine &amp; Machinery on the northern slope of Birch Hill was one of the minor gold producers within the leads system. It faced significant challenges with water and, like several other small mines locally, it earned the nickname &quot;the water tank.&quot; Pumping operations were executed using a non-condensing horizontal steam engine with a 66cm cylinder, one of the largest of its kind ever installed in a Victorian mine. This engine powered 46cm pumps. The mullock dump at this mine is exceptionally well-preserved, and the shaft remains open, with one of the original boilers still present on the site. This mine serves as a representative example of smaller mining operations in the area that failed to attain profitability; the main hindrance being the shareholders&#x27; inability to provide sufficient capital to overcome its considerable challenges.

Other ruins include Bunyan FHD Mine at 101 Stag Road Kingston, and Colthards Fhd Mine at 171 Stag Road Kingston, which are on the Victorian Heritage Inventory.

=== Buildings ===
Kingston still retains some of its old buildings including the restored Commercial Hotel with others now owned privately, including the Former Creswick Shire Hall, the old Mechanics&#x27; Hall in Main Street, and the Primary School.

The small former Holy Trinity Church of England at the north end of the town is notable as a bluestone church with three bays. Designed by Leonard Terry and constructed between 1862 and 1864, it was classified in 1977 for its unique truncated proportions, sturdy masonry bellcote, plate traceried west window, and cusp-headed side windows.

The former Methodist Church (latterly Uniting) in Main Street is a Wesleyan chapel classified in 1987. The Ballarat architect Joseph Attwood Doane designed it in 1868 in a simplified Lombardy Romanesque style with bichrome brickwork.

In the Showgrounds off Church Parade (Kingston-Allendale Road), the Grandstand, constructed at Smeaton in 1902 and moved to its present location in 1922 for better railway access, is a well-preserved timber building with barrel vault and skillion corrugated iron roofs. On 27 March, 1997 it was added to the Victorian Heritage Register (VHR) Number H1300.

A Heritage-listed Avenue of Honour of 285 elm trees is dedicated to those who served in World War I, and roadside memorials commemorate service personnel of both Worlds Wars, and the Borneo, Korea, and Vietnam conflicts.

== Education ==

In 1865, in a brick school building and teacher&#x27;s house finished in the previous year at 360 Kingston Road, the town opened a &#x27;common school&#x27; under its first head teacher Joshua Thomas. During the twentieth century enrolments fluctuated between 100 and 160 and in periods when the school became overcrowded classes were relocated to the Church of England. In 1970 its name was changed to Kingston Primary School, number 759.

In December 2004, Kingston Primary School, following years of lack of support by local parents, closed its doors due to declining enrolments after 142 years. The school&#x27;s original solid brick school building, extra classrooms, a toilet block and shedding were auctioned for A$331,000 in October 2006 and became a private residence and is protected under a Hepburn Shire Council heritage overlay. Subsequently, with the 2013 closure of nearby Smeaton Primary School, children travel even greater distances to the larger schools in Creswick or Daylesford.

The 2021 Census counted 7 primary students, 5 at secondary, and 7 university or other tertiary students. There were 22 families with children, an average of 1.6 per family, with 8 pre-school children aged 0-4 years.

== Notable residents ==
* Arthur Harold Brownbill (1898–1917) killed in action at Gallipoli in WWI
* William Roy Hodgson (1892-1958), soldier and public servant, ambassador

Located in the River Ward of the City of Maribyrnong, Maribyrnong takes its name from the Maribyrnong River which bounds the suburb to the north and east. Its other borders are Williamson Road, Rosamond Road, Mephan Street and Owen Street to the south.

Maribyrnong contains Highpoint Shopping Centre, one of Australia&#x27;s largest shopping centres.

==History==

Maribyrnong lies on the traditional land of the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung and Bunurong peoples of the Kulin Nation. Aboriginal people have lived in the Maribyrnong River valley for at least 40,000 years, and the name Maribyrnong derives from the phrase &#x27;Mirring-gnay-bir-nong&#x27;, meaning &#x27;I can hear a ringtail possum&#x27;.

A Maribyrnong Post Office opened on 19 March 1881 and closed in 1887. It reopened in 1912 and closed again in 1975. There is currently an Australia Post shop at Highpoint Shopping Centre.

Maribyrnong is home to the Department of Defence ammunitions factory and storage facility. Although many of the buildings are now disused, the site has now been earmarked for development by the State Government for housing and low density commercial infrastructure.

==Education==
Maribyrnong contains several schools, both Catholic and State Government run. Maribyrnong College (est 1958) is the sole high school in the suburb, which recently underwent significant renovations by the State Government. St Margarets Catholic Primary School and nearby Footscray North Primary School both cater for primary school aged children in the area.

There are also kindergarten and child care centres within Maribyrnong.

* Rainbow lorikeet
* Common brushtail possum
* Flying foxes or fruit bat Pteropus
* Cockatoo

Maribyrnong has a number of parks mostly near the Maribyrnong River. These reserves are typically unsuitable for development due to the risk of flooding and have been established as gardens and reserves for locals to enjoy.

==Places of worship==

There is only one place of worship throughout the entire suburb of Maribyrnong – a church in the Roman Catholic tradition. St Margaret&#x27;s, which is the namesake of the Catholic primary school, is part of the Parish of Ascot Vale and shares the same priest which conducts services at St Mary&#x27;s in Ascot Vale.

==Sport==
===Maribyrnong Aquatic Centre===
The Maribyrnong Aquatic Centre was established in 2006.

Tracey&#x27;s Speedway (formerly Kirjon Speedway) on the Maribyrnong Reserve on Horetense Street was utilised as a racetrack for various motor sport events. It opened in 1946 and closed in 1964. There was a motorcycle speedway track located at Tracey&#x27;s Speedway and it hosted significant events, including the Australian Solo Championship in 1947 and 1950.

Still located at the ground are two free standing grandstands which have been refurbished at various times. In most cases the stands are rarely used for spectator events, and instead act as changing rooms for local sports clubs which use the indoor facilities. Today the ground acts as a soccer pitch during winter months, and is also utilised by St Margaret&#x27;s Primary School for Australian rules football matches.

==Recent developments==

Despite being an inner city suburb, like many western suburbs, there are significant areas of land within Maribyrnong that have not yet been developed. Mostly owned by the Federal Government for the Department of Defence, the land is now seen as a prime opportunity for housing developments. The most notable development recently under construction is the Delfin Lend Lease Edgewater Estate, located near Highpoint on Gordon Street, which takes in city views and is adjacent to the historic Jack&#x27;s Magazine.

The largest development to be announced by the State Government is the 128 hectare Maribyrnong Explosives Factory site, bounded by the Maribyrnong River. 3,000 new homes are expected to be built, along with open parkland, shops and the inclusion of many decades old defence buildings in keeping with heritage. Construction was expected to commence in 2012 but has not yet started, the project should take 10 – 15 years to be fully completed.

<text>Clarence Lester Hogan (February 8, 1920 – August 12, 2008) was an American physicist and a pioneer in microwave and semiconductor technology.

He grew up as a brother to three sisters in Great Falls, Montana, where his father worked for the Great Northern Railway. After graduating from Montana State University with a degree in chemical engineering he joined the United States Navy in 1942. He did some work on acoustic torpedoes in Chesapeake Bay, and when being approached by Bell Laboratories, subsequently went to the Pacific theatre to train submarine crews in the use of that technology.

After the war he did post-graduate studies at Lehigh University and obtained a Ph.D. in physics. He then joined Bell Labs in 1950. A couple of months later he invented the Microwave Gyrator (a device which can simulate inductance by substituting an &quot;RC&quot; circuit, thus getting rid of awkward coil assemblies). He worked under Bill Shockley, inventor of the transistor and Nobel Prize laureate. From 1953 through 1958 he was a professor at Harvard University, when he was asked by Dan Noble to join Motorola Semiconductor in Phoenix, Arizona, as vice president and general manager of the semiconductor operation.

In 1968 he moved to Fairchild Camera &amp; Instrument as Chairman and CEO, taking eight senior executives (nicknamed &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;) with him. This move caused Motorola to sue Fairchild (unsuccessfully) for theft of trade secrets.

In 1975 he received IEEE&#x27;s &quot;Frederik Philips Award&quot;. In 1978 he was honoured with the &quot;AeA Medal of Achievement&quot;. In 1993 he received the &quot;MTT-S Microwave Pioneer Award&quot;. In 1996, a chair at the department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley was named in his honor, currently held by Shafi Goldwasser. On October 20, 1999, he was inducted as &quot;Eminent Member&quot; of Eta Kappa Nu, &quot;the society’s highest membership classification, to be conferred upon those select few whose technical attainments and contributions to society through leadership in the field of electrical and computer engineering have resulted in significant benefits to humankind&quot;.

C. Lester Hogan died at the age of 88 due to complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease at his home in Atherton, California.

<doc id="492787" wikidata="Q1413210" url="?curid=492787" title="Mornington Peninsula">
<text>The Mornington Peninsula is a peninsula located south of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It is surrounded by Port Phillip to the west, Western Port to the east and Bass Strait to the south, and is connected to the mainland in the north. Geographically, the peninsula begins its protrusion from the mainland in the area between Pearcedale and an area north of Frankston. The area was originally home to the &quot;Mayone-bulluk&quot; and &quot;Boonwurrung-Balluk&quot; clans, and formed part of the Boonwurrung nation&#x27;s territory prior to European settlement.

Much of the peninsula has been cleared for agriculture and settlements. However, small areas of the native ecology remain in the peninsula&#x27;s south and west, some of which is protected by the Mornington Peninsula National Park. In 2002, around 180,000 people lived on the peninsula and in nearby areas, most in the built-up towns on its western shorelines which are sometimes regarded as outlying suburbs of greater Melbourne; there is a seasonal population of around 270,000. On 30 June 2017, the Mornington Peninsula population was recorded at 163,847 people. However, in the peak of summer the population increases to 225,000–250,000 people each year, so that it becomes the most populous coastal holiday area in Victoria, with a larger population than Hobart.

The peninsula is primarily a local tourist region, with popular natural attractions such as the variety of beaches, both sheltered and open-sea and many scenic sights and views. Other popular attractions include the various wineries, mazes and the diverse array of water sports made available by the diversity of beaches and calm waters of Port Phillip and Western Port. Most visitors to the peninsula are residents of Melbourne who camp, rent villas and share houses or stay in private beach houses.

== History ==
The peninsula was formed by the flooding of Port Phillip Bay after the end of the glacial period about 10000 BC. It may have extended into Port Phillip at various times, most recently between 800 BC and 1000 AD when Port Phillip Bay may have dried out.

Indigenous Australians of the &quot;Mayone-bulluk&quot; and &quot;Boonwurrung-Balluk&quot; clans lived on the peninsula as part of the Boonwurrung People&#x27;s territory prior to European settlement. The territory hosted six clans who lived along the Victorian coast from the Werribee River across to Western Port Bay and Wilsons Promontory. The peninsula may have been home to between 100 and 500 people prior to European settlement.

The first European settlement on the Mornington Peninsula was also the first settlement in Victoria, situated in what is now Sorrento. The Sullivan&#x27;s Bay settlement was a short-lived penal colony established in 1803, 30 years before the establishment of Melbourne, by Lieutenant-Colonel David Collins (1753–1810).

At the time of European settlement in 1803 much of the Mornington Peninsula was covered with she-oak forests. These were quickly cleared to provide firewood for the growing city of Melbourne, and much of the peninsula was then covered with fruit orchards. Nevertheless, much natural vegetation still exists, especially in an area of bushland in the south known as Greens Bush, and the coastal fringe bordering Bass Strait and Western Port Bay. Most large areas of bushland are now included within the Mornington Peninsula National Park.

As professional farming has declined, hobby farmers with an interest in the aesthetic and the natural environment have taken over much of the peninsula. This has led to an expansion of natural bushland on private property, and many native species, such as koalas, are becoming increasingly common. The local council also has a slight lean towards sustainable practices.

=== Harold Holt disappearance ===

On 17 December 1967, Prime Minister Harold Holt went swimming at Cheviot Beach on what is now Point Nepean National Park. At the time, however, it was still a restricted area. Holt, who was 59 and had had a recent shoulder injury, plunged readily into the surf. He disappeared from view and was never seen again. Despite an extensive search his body was never found. He was officially presumed dead on 19 December 1967.

== Demographics ==
In 2016, 17.8% of people in Mornington Peninsula Shire were born overseas. 8.9% of the total population were born in the United Kingdom being the largest migrant group in the region. 1.4% were born in New Zealand, 0.7% were born in Italy, 0.6% were born in Germany and 0.6% were born in the Netherlands. This was followed by smaller migrant groups from Ireland, United States of America, South Africa and Greece.

While 88.9% of the population speak English exclusively, the Mornington Peninsula population can speak other popular languages. 1.0% speak Italian, 0.7% speak Greek, 0.4% speak German, 0.3% speak Mandarin and 0.2% speak French.

==Geography==

The peninsula extends from the mainland between Pearcedale and Frankston in a south-westerly direction for about at a width of about . It then begins to extend roughly in a west/north-westerly direction and tapers down to a width of about before terminating at Point Nepean. Much of the topography is flat in the north where it connects to the mainland, however moving south-west, it soon becomes hilly, culminating in the central hilly landscapes of Boneo, Main Ridge, Red Hill, Tuerong and Moorooduc. The highest point, Arthurs Seat, located unusually close to the shoreline, stands at above sea level. The peninsula hosts around of coastline.

Its eastern shorelines meet many mangroves and mudflats in the waters of Western Port before it tapers down to form Crib Point, Stony Point and Sandy Point at the peninsula&#x27;s most south-easterly point. In the south-east between Sandy Point and West Head, the mudflats give way to sandy beaches which in turn become more and more rocky further south. In the south the peninsula meets Bass Strait and the coastline becomes very rocky between West Head and Cape Schanck. The coast between Cape Schanck and Point Nepean consists of a long slow curvature of open-sea surf beaches, many too dangerous to swim in. Its western shorelines form various headlands and bays in the sheltered waters of Port Phillip, hosting many shallow safe beaches.

The western coastline facing Port Phillip starts at the narrow bay entrance, The Heads or The Rip, and proceeds as a series of gently curved bays defined by small rocky outcrops.

From an oceanic perspective, the Mornington Peninsula, together with the Bellarine Peninsula, separate the waters of Port Phillip from Bass Strait, except for a small gap known as The Rip, which also separates both peninsulas. The peninsula also separates the waters of Port Phillip and Western Port.

The Mornington Peninsula is crossed by many seismically active fault lines, monoclines, synclines and anticlines; the largest of which is the 100 km long Selwyn Fault which is capable of producing earthquakes of around 7.5 magnitude. The Peninsula experiences many minor earthquakes every year, but most are too small to be felt. The last strong earthquake to rock the Peninsula had a magnitude of 5.0 and occurred on 7 July 1971 at 7:55am AEST with its epicentre off Flinders, along the southern end of the Tyabb Fault.

===Political geography===

The Mornington Peninsula is located over 40 km south-east of Melbourne. As of 2016 it has a population of 154,999 which can swell up to 250,000 during the summer months. The majority of the Mornington Peninsula is administered by the local government area of the Shire of Mornington Peninsula, with southern areas of the adjoining City of Frankston and City of Casey forming part of the northern boundary of the region.

=== Environmental Issues ===

==== Gunnamatta Sewage Outlet ====
A sewage outlet near Boag Rock, a couple of kilometres up the coast from Gunnamatta Surf Beach, pumps treated sewage into the ocean which finds its way to swimmers and surfers at Gunnamatta during particular tidal conditions.

==== Crib Point Project ====
In March 2021, the Victorian State Government blocked a controversial project by energy company AGL to build a floating gas import terminal at Crib Point. 


== Agriculture ==
The Mornington Peninsula is a notable wine region, producing small quantities of high quality wine from around 60 wineries. While most varieties are grown, the cool, maritime climate of the Peninsula is particularly noted for pinot noir. Many wineries are open for public tastings and several have quality restaurants.

Apples were the staple product of the Peninsula for several generations, with whole trainloads being dispatched to the city and ports. The number of orchards has been dramatically reduced, however there are many other producers on the Peninsula, specialising in berries, cherries, and other fruits, as well as market gardens. There is increased interest in organic production, and there are even organic beef producers.

The Peninsula not only produces fresh products, with small-scale manufacturers of niche products as diverse as cheese, chocolate, chutney, jam, and olive oil. Local produce is also to be found at markets held around the Peninsula, such as the monthly market at Red Hill. A local organisation, Mornington Peninsula Gourmet, has been set up to support the many small producers on the Peninsula.

==Transport==
The peninsula is serviced predominantly by a network of roads. Public transport is limited to a bus service which services urban areas on the western shorelines and a train service for the eastern areas of the peninsula. The following methods of transport are available to access various regions of the peninsula:

*Road: The Peninsula is easily reached from Melbourne via a number of roads. The Mornington Peninsula Freeway, which begins in Dingley Village and connects to the EastLink tollway in Carrum Downs is the primary road to the Mornington Peninsula from Melbourne and experiences the most traffic in holiday months. The Nepean Highway, which extends from Central Melbourne and roughly follows the coast of Port Phillip Bay is another alternative non-freeway route. From Safety Beach onwards, Nepean Highway is known as Point Nepean Road and serves as the main arterial along the northern coast of the Peninsula, collector roads connect this road to the southern sections of the Mornington Peninsula Freeway. The Frankston Freeway and the Moorooduc Highway were previously the primary road route to the Peninsula prior to the completion of the missing sections of the Mornington Peninsula Freeway, today these roads act as another alternative route to the Peninsula travelling via Frankston. The Western Port Highway, which connects to Melbourne via the Monash Freeway and South Gippsland Freeway is another route, primarily serving the eastern side of the Peninsula.

==Tourism==

The Mornington Peninsula has a long history of being a favourite holiday destination for residents of Melbourne with 24,000 holiday homes in the area. Mornington Peninsula tourism generates 10 per cent of local employment opportunities and is an important component of the economy. Popular tourism times are long weekends such as Cup Weekend and Queens Birthday, the week involving Christmas, Boxing Day and New Years, with the months of December and January being the peak tourist period. Most visitors to the peninsula are local to central Victoria. However, international visitors from Asian markets such as China have become increasingly attracted to the area with international visitors increasing by 3–4% in 2018. Overall tourism on the Mornington Peninsula has also grown with a 20% increase in overnight trips in 2017, with newly established luxury hotels such as Jackalope Hotel increasing the popularity of the region. 100,000 campers also enjoy the municipality&#x27;s foreshore camping sites in the summer months for cheaper overnight trips. Short-stay rental services such as Airbnb have also become popular among tourists with 3.7% of the region&#x27;s housing stock listed on the website.

The Mornington Peninsula is also the third most popular tourist destination in Victoria for day-trip visitors. The suburb of Mornington has become a tourist hotspot with 1500 visitors traveling to the town&#x27;s Main Street via ocean liners in recent years.

===Accommodation===

Wealthier visitors to the peninsula usually own beach houses on large properties or with extensive views or beach access and as a result, there are very few established commercial hotels. There are however, many smaller motels priced to suit families and middle income earners. Large shared beach houses are also popular, although perhaps the most popular form of accommodation lie in the many caravan parks and camping grounds where many visitors own or rent on-site caravans and annexes or camp in tents. Camping is particularly popular on foreshore reserves where camping is permitted. Some visitors continuously book particular sites and many camping grounds have been camped on by the same family for 2 or 3 generations. For the unestablished tourist, these camping grounds must be booked anywhere from 1 to 5 years in advance for foreshore sites, while further inland sites are more easily available with at most a 3 to 6-month wait. It is estimated that around 30–40% of the houses on the peninsula are not owned by permanent residents reflecting the popularity of owned beach houses. Most of these &#x27;beach houses&#x27; are owned by residents of Melbourne.

<doc id="492791" wikidata="Q1434621" url="?curid=492791" title="Ouest (department)">
<text>Ouest (French, ) or Lwès (Haitian Creole; both meaning &quot;West&quot;) is one of the ten departments of Haiti. It is located in south-central Haiti, linking the Great-North and the Tiburon Peninsula.

It is the jurisdictional seat of the national capital, the city of Port-au-Prince.

It has an area of and a population of 4,029,705 (2015 estimate), making it both the largest department by area and the most populated department in Haiti.

==History==
===Taino period===
The department was part of the Xaragua kasika under the leadership of Anacaona.

There are many native settlements in the department notably around Akaya, Azuei Lake, Yaguana, the island of Guanabo and Goava. It is understood that the Azuei Plaine region was used as a hunting ground for the natives.

The island of Gonave is the last point of refuge for the Taino natives.

===Spanish period===
One of the only Spanish settlements in the area was a destroyed Spanish town called Santa-Maria-de-la-Paz-Verdadera, the actual city of Tabarre.

===French period===
The earliest French settlement in the area was a hospital named Morne L&#x27;Hopital. In the second half of the 18th century, the French wanted to build a new colonial capital outside the troubled North. One of the suggestions was Petit-Goâve but later they chose the region of l&#x27;Hopital building which would become the City of Port-au-Prince.

===English period===
In 1793 the city fell to the British troops where they built the Fort-National until Toussaint gained it back for the French government.

===Haitian period===
====Haitian Revolution====
Many maroon troops controlled the mountain around Port-au-Prince mainly Romaine-la-Prophetesse and Lamour Dérance and Cangé.

Around 1772, Romaine-la-Prophétesse acquired a plantation named Trou Coffy in the department (likely in what is now Fondwa), becoming a prominent coffee grower and trader. In 1791 and 1792, during the early Haitian Revolution, Romaine led some thirteen thousand slaves and rebels in freeing slaves from and burning the provinces plantations and briefly controlling two major cities, Léogâne and Jacmel.
Ogé and Chavannes organized more than 300 blacks the Suisses to rebel against their so-called master. Caradeux the rough slave master in the region orderer their execution in Omòl.In 1791, Pétion, Pinchinnat, Beauvais, and more rebelled against the French authority and reclaimed their civil rights. After the Battles of Pernier, Croix-des-Bouquets, and Mirebalais they gained a Concordat, although the slaves did not gain anything.

In Arcahaie, on May 18, 1803, the generals of the North and West and Maroons met for a Congress and chose Jean-Jacques Dessalines as commander of the Armée Indigènes and chose the Haiti Flag designed by Catherine Flon.

====Independence====
According to Thomas Madiou&#x27;s recount of the Haitian Revolution, the fight for Port-au-Prince is one of the most important fights. After Gabart gained control of St-Marc, the entire Artibonite region was under the control of Dessalines and the Armée Indigène. In the south, only the major port town of Les Cayes was still under French control. In the north, Cap-Haitian and Mole-St-Nicolas are still under French control. Rochambeau anticipated that the next step for Dessalines would be the conquer of Port-au-Prince, so he moved the capital of the colony back to Cap-Francois which would be harder for the British Navy to put under blockade versus Port-au-Prince located in the Gulf of Gonave. Leaving Petite-Rivière-de-l&#x27;Artibonite on September 15, the general stopped in St-Marc by Gabart and was in Arcahaie by Pétion on September 17. The same night for Croix-des-Bouquets where he camped by Frère. Pétion continued to march toward P-au-P and was by habitation Drouillard the next day. The French general of Croix-des-Bouquets Lux left the arrondissement to go help the French troops in P-au-P, he passed by Damien, Sarthe and the convoy was attacked by the Indigènes. By September 23, Cangé left Léogane, marched toward Port-au-Prince, and attacked the Fort-Bizoton in Carrefour, Gabart was at the St-Joseph gate and Dessalines camped in Turgeau a neighborhood located east of the city. The city of Port-au-Prince is officially sieged by the Armée Indigénes. The very next day Pétion was located in the habitation Philippeaux and started bombarding the French troops. By October 5, an aide-de-camp of Lavalette brought a letter to Dessalines with the terms of their capitulation. Dessalines accepted with an exchange of prisoners and adjuvant-general Bonnet came back to the Haitians and gave the French 4 days to leave the city. Thus on September 9 Port-au-Prince was freed from the French troops and Dessalines enter the city proudly with Pétion on his right and Gabart on his left. 
Pétion, Germain Frère and Yayou are signatories of the Haitian Declaration of Independence.
Ouest was part of the Second Military Division of the West with Pétion as commander.

Pétion build the twin forts Jacques and Alexandre on the order of Dessalines.

On October 17, 1806, coming from Dessalinesville, Emperor Jacques 1st was ambushed and assassinated plunging the country into a civil war. His body was buried in St-Anne Cemetery. On January 2, 1904, he received state funerals and later on his body was moved to the Autel de la Patrie in Champs-de-Mars along with Pétion&#x27;s body.

On January 1, 1807, only three years after the Haitian Declaration of Independence, the northern troops fought the western troops in the Sibert Battle, where Pétion almost died. Cabaret was the de facto border between the two states.

Under Jean-Pierre Boyer, fearing the return of the French boat, he ordered the construction of a city in the heights like Toussaint with Ennery, Dessalines with Dessalines and Christophe with Milot and naming it after his mentor Pétionville.

Being the political center of the country, most of Haiti&#x27;s political instability and economical fight happen in the Port-au-Prince area since 1749 until today.

==Geography==
The department is bordered to the north by Artibonite and Centre and the Mattheux mountain chain, the west by the Gulf of Gonave, the south by the Sud-Est department and the La Selle Mountain Chain, and the Dominican Republic to the east through the province of Independencia.

It is the second largest department in Haiti after Artibonite. Gonâve Island is also part of the Ouest department. The department&#x27;s stretch of coastline lies entirely in the Gulf of Gonâve.

A part majority of the department lies in the Plaine-de-Cul-de-Sac which continues to the Dominican Rep. as the Hayo de Enriquillo. Two other plains that lie in the region are the Plain of Arcahaie-Cabaret and the Plain of Léoganes.

===Gulf and coast===
The Golfe is more than 500 km in length from Mole-Saint-Nicolas to Abricots and it consists of more than a dozen bays and harbors. 
The Bay of Port-au-Prince is the largest in the country and one of the biggest in the Caribbean harboring many islands, cays, and reefs. The island of Gonave is the largest
satellite island on Hispaniola being the size of Singapore.

===Environment===
The largest lake in the country is a salty lake in a depression in the plain of the same name, Azuei Lake. A smaller lake lies next to it Caiman Lake. Both lakes form a national park harboring flamingos and caimans.

The hills of Port-au-Prince consist of a mountain from the Massif de la Selle-Cordillera Meridional, where one can find multiple forests such as Foret-des-Pins and Parc-la-Visite.

The most important rivers in the department are Blanche River, Froide River, Monance River, and Bois-de-Chène Ravine.

===Geology===
The earthquake activities in the area are a result of the Enriquillo-Plantain-Garden fault going from Jamaica to the Dominican Rep passing through the Xaragua Peninsula and the Gonave Microplate. Two well-documented earthquakes happen in the area.
* 1751 earthquake
* 2010 earthquake or &quot;Goudougoudou&quot;. The epicenter was in Léoganes affecting Jacmel, Léoganes, and Port-au-Prince and causing millions in damages and counting hundreds-thousand of casualties.


On 12 January 2010, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck in the department, the largest in Haiti in two centuries. In the Port-au-Prince Arrondissement, many areas suffered damage. In the Léogâne Arrondissement, the city of Léogâne suffered 80-90% destruction. Other places in Léogâne were also affected.

==Economy==
Ouest is the wealthiest department in Haiti, with economic poles in different sectors.

===Tourism===
Ouest&#x27;s tourism sector touches on different branches such as leisure tourism in the Cotes-des-Arcadins, eco-tourism with Park Azuei-Caiman and Park La Selle, historical tourism with the countless historical monuments especially the National Museum, and cultural tourism.

===Agriculture===
For many years, agriculture was a part of the economy of the department, with the Arcahaie plain being a center for plantain, the Cul-de-Sac and Léogane being known for large sugar-cane plantations mostly for the production of rum, and the hills of Kenscoff cultivating different vegetables. Unfortunately, over-construction and the ever-expansion of the city, those areas see their fertile land now covered with asphalt and concrete.
===Transport===
Much of Haiti&#x27;s road network extends out of Ouest.
*The RN1 connects the West to the North by the coast
*The RN2 connects the West to the South
*The RN3 connects the West to the North through the mountains
*The RN4 connects the West to the South-East
*The RN8 connects the West to the Jimani, in the Dominican Rep.

The bay harbors many ports of sizable capacity owned or operated by the state or private parties.

Haiti&#x27;s largest airport, the Toussaint Louverture Airport, is located in Delmas.

<text>Centre (French, ) or Sant (Haitian Creole; both meaning &quot;Center&quot;) is a central department (; ) of Haiti, located in the center of the country along the border with the Dominican Republic. As of 2015, its estimated population was 746,236. Its capital is Hinche.

== History ==
=== Taino Period ===
The department was part of the Marien kasika and Maguana alongside San Juan de la Maguana under the leadership of Caonabo.

=== Spanish Period ===
Much of the Centre Departement was Spanish territorial even after the Treaty of Ryswick.
Many towns were built and settled by the Spanish like Hincha, Las Caobas, San Rafael and many more.
=== French Period ===
The southern part of the department was French territory with towns like Mirebalais.
=== Haitian Period ===
==== Haitian Revolution ====
The department played a big part in the Revolution serving as maroon territory extending to the Baoruco.
Toussaint Louverture capture the town of Hinche from the Spanish for the French making it an early Haitian territory.
==== Independence ====
David Troy commander of Mirebalais is a signatory of the Haitian Declaration of Independence.

In contemporary times the department played a big role in the fight against the American Marines, being a Caco a refuge for men like Charlemagne Péralte and Benoit Batraville.

== Geography ==

<text>Makó (, , Makowe, or , ) is a town in Csongrád County, in southeastern Hungary, from the Romanian border. It lies on the Maros River. Makó is home to 21,913 people and it has an area of , of which is arable land. Makó is the fourth-largest town in Csongrád County after Szeged, Hódmezővásárhely and Szentes. The town is from Hódmezővásárhely, from Szeged, from Arad, from Gyula, from Timișoara (Temesvár), and from Budapest.

The climate is warmer than anywhere else in Hungary, with hot, dry summers. The town is noted for its onion which is a hungarikum, the spa and the thermal bath. The Makó International Onion Festival, the largest of its kind, is held annually. Makó is a popular tourist destination in Hungary.

The Makó gas field, located near the town, is the largest natural gas field in Central Europe. The gas volume is more than 600 billion cubic metres (21 trillion cubic feet), according to a report by the Scotia Group.

The town&#x27;s floodplain forests are protected as part of Körös-Maros National Park.

== Economy ==
The economy is based on agriculture. The town is noted for its production of onions and garlic. Both the climate and the soil structure make the town and its surroundings an ideal place for onion farming. Onions have been cultivated in the region since the 16th century. The first records of significant garlic production date to the late 18th century. International recognition of the garlic grown in Makó has been widespread since the Vienna Expo in 1873 and the Brussels Expo in 1888.

The mud of the Maros River has similar properties to some of the best in Hungary and the world; at times it is likened to that of the Dead Sea. The local spa has been one of the main tourist attractions since 1961.

With the political changes in 1989, after the break-up of the Soviet Union, Makó lost jobs in industry. Unemployment has risen in the area, to an estimated 8% in the early 21st century, and is considered a serious issue. Farmers have also suffered more economic difficulties. The town has established an industrial park to encourage that development, and the town hopes to build on its site as &quot;The South-Eastern Gate of the European Union&quot;.

Makó has become known in the early 21st century for the nearby Makó Trough, a basin-centered gas accumulation that could be one of the largest natural gas fields in continental Europe. As of March 2007, it was not clear whether the gas can be recovered economically from this area. At the 90% probability rate, Makó had certified recoverable resources of over 600 billion cubic meters of natural gas, according to a report by the Scotia Group. This was prepared for the field&#x27;s exploration concession holder, the Canada-based Falcon Oil and Gas.

== History ==
Makó used to be the capital of Csanád, a historic administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary.

Many notable Hungarian people were born or have lived in Makó. Perhaps the most prominent is the American publisher and journalist, Joseph Pulitzer, who was born to a Jewish family here on April 18, 1847. Emigrating to the United States when young, he developed as a publisher, owning and operating two newspapers in the United States: in Saint Louis, Missouri and New York City; bequeathed funds to Columbia University to establish its school of journalism, and endowed the Pulitzer Prizes in journalism and photography, as well as literature, art and music.

=== Jewish history ===
Makó developed a Jewish community beginning in the 18th century. The Orthodox synagogue was reconstructed during the years 1999-2002 and reopened on 10 March 2002.

Jews began to settle in Makó about the middle of the 18th century, under the protection of Stanislavich, the Bishop of Csanád. In 1740, he assigned a special quarter where they soon formed a community, and by 1747 had established a Chevra kadisha.

The first rabbi of Makó was Judah ben Abraham ha-Levi (who occupied the rabbinate from 1778 to 1824). He was succeeded by Salomon Ullman (1826–63). Ullman wrote a commentary on certain sections of &quot;Yoreh De&#x27;ah&quot;, under the title &quot;Yeri&#x27;ot Shelomoh&quot; (Vienna, 1854). He was followed by Anton Enoch Fischer (1864–96), former rabbi of Dunaföldvár. Fischer introduced German and (later) Hungarian in his sermons, when the community still spoke mostly Yiddish.&lt;br&gt; In 1904 the rabbi was Dr. A. Kecskemeti&quot;.

The community established a Jewish school in Makó in 1851, of which Marcus Steinhardt was a teacher for forty years. The community also set up a Jewish Women&#x27;s Association, a Jewish students&#x27; aid society, and a Jewish women&#x27;s lying-in hospital.

In 1900, Makó had 1,642 Jews, less than 5% of the total city population of 33,722. The community was destroyed during the Holocaust. The Jewish population was deported to extermination camps, where most were killed in the last year of the war.

== Geography ==
The former community pasture of the town near the Maros River has been preserved as part of the Körös-Maros National Park. The traditional name of the area, &quot;Csordajárás,&quot; expresses its historic use as grazing ground for cattle.

===Climate===
Makó and the surrounding region get the most sunshine in Hungary, about 85-90 sunny days a year. The sun shines more than 2,100 hours a year in Makó. The climate is relatively dry, especially in the summer, with the 100-year average of precipitation recorded at per year. The average medium temperature is .

<text>Nord (French, ) or Nò (Haitian Creole; both meaning &quot;North&quot;) is one of the ten departments of Haiti and located in northern Haiti. It has an area of and a population of 1,067,177 (2015). Its capital is Cap-Haïtien.
==History==
===Taino Period===
The department was part of the Chiefdom of Marien with settlements such as Guarico in Limonade and Guanawari in Grande-Rivière-du-Nord.

===Spanish Period===
After the arrival of Columbus, the Taino granted the Spanish land to build the fort Navidad with their shipwreck, the first Colombian-era shelter built by Europeans in America. The fort was destroyed by Caonabo, leader of the Maguana, in response to the Europeans abusing their stay and locals. The Europeans moved eastward to actual la Isabella in the Dominican Republic.

===French Period===
After the treaty of Ryswick, the French administer the west side of the island. The capital of the colony from 1697 to 1751 has been Cap-François, the actual Cap-Haitian.
The department was the most densely populated with enslaved Africain, making it the beginning with the Bwa-Kayiman and the end with the Battle of Vertières of the Haitian Revolution.
In 1789 the Nord Department on the northern shore was the most fertile area with the largest sugar plantations. It was an area of vast economic importance. Here most of the slaves lived in relative isolation, separated from the rest of the colony by a high mountain range known as the &quot;Massif&quot;. This area was a stronghold of the wealthy planters who wanted greater autonomy for the colony, especially economically, so they could do as they pleased.

===Haitian Revolution===
Many rebellions have taken place in Haiti notably in the North even before 1791 such as the Makandal Rebellion or the Ogé and Chavannes Insurrection. August 1791 becomes important as a Jamaican maroon Duty Boukmann and manbo or Vodoun priestess Cecile Fatiman organized the enslaved from different African nations. One week after that Congress and essentially what some scholars call the first Haitian Vodoun ceremony the general rebellion has started being led by Toussaint, Dessalines, Papillon, Biassou and many more.
Within the next ten days slaves had taken control of the entire northern province in an unprecedented slave revolt that left the whites controlling only a few isolated fortified camps. Within the next two months as the violence escalated, the rebelling slaves killed 2,000 whites and burned or destroyed 280 sugar plantations. Within a year the island was in revolutionary chaos. Slaves burned the plantations where they had been forced to work, and killed masters, overseers, and other whites. This was the beginning of the Haitian Revolution.
The Haitians manage to get the complete abolition of slavery with Toussaint&#x27;s fight, Polverel, and Sonthonax, although many whites and some mulattoes were not satisfied with the outcome. Some blacks were also not satisfied since Toussaint establish strict discipline to cultivate the land and he also reinvite some whites to come back to St-Domingue.

When the expedition arrived in Haiti and Leclerc asked Christophe for a safe harbor for his military vessels and control over Cap-Haitien. After he refuses, in response he burns his own house, then burns the city and runs to the Cap mountains.

After Toussaint&#x27;s capture, Dessalines and Pétion had a meeting in Plaisance to form the Indigènes Army and the collective focus shifted from liberty and abolition of slavery to Independence.

On November 18, 1803, the Battle of Vertières outside of the city of Le Cap was the last battle in the war for Independence. The glorious and courageous capacity of Dessalines, Cappoix, Christophe, Gabart, and more led to January 1, 1804.

===Haitian Period===
Henry Christophe the commander of Dondon and Clerveaux commander of Marmelade are signatories of the Haitian Declaration of Independence. The Bataille of Vertières is the last major fight opposing the Armée Indigènes and the French troops and the city was freed on November 19, 1803.

During the First Empire, the North was part of the Great Division of the North under the control of Henry, Clerveaux, and Cappoix.

====Kingdom of Hayti====
In 1807, after the battle of Sibert, The North declared itself a free state, and later a monarchy and civil war broke out in the north under the leadership of Henri Christophe. Christophe declared the northern dominion a kingdom in 1811 and crowned himself King Henry I of Haiti.

Under the reign of His Majesty Henry 1st of Hayti, the North knew great development in architecture, culture, music, theater legislature, and science.
The Kingsmen, Royal Dahomey saw to the application of Code Henry.
In 1820, King Henry committed suicide after suffering a stroke that resulted in the loss of control of his army and power. The area was re-claimed by Jean-Pierre Boyer, then the appointed president of Haiti, on October 26, 1820, after Haitian forces captured Cap-Haïtien, re-uniting Haiti.

<text>Lostprophets (stylised as lostprophets or LOSTPROPHETS) were a Welsh rock band from Pontypridd, formed in 1997 by singer Ian Watkins and guitarist Lee Gaze. The group was founded after their former band Fleshbind broke up. They later recruited Mike Lewis on guitars, Stuart Richardson on bass and Mike Chiplin on drums.

Lostprophets released five studio albums: &quot;The Fake Sound of Progress&quot; (2000), &quot;Start Something&quot; (2004), &quot;Liberation Transmission&quot; (2006), &quot;The Betrayed&quot; (2010), and &quot;Weapons&quot; (2012). They sold 3.5 million albums worldwide, achieving two top-ten singles on the UK Singles Chart (&quot;Last Train Home&quot; and &quot;Rooftops&quot;), a No. 1 single on the US Alternative Songs chart (&quot;Last Train Home&quot;), and several &quot;Kerrang!&quot; Awards and nominations.

In December 2012, Watkins was charged with multiple sexual offences against minors, infants and animals. Lostprophets cancelled all tour dates and disbanded in October 2013, before the end of Watkins&#x27; trial. Watkins pleaded guilty to several charges. In December 2013, he was sentenced to 29 years of imprisonment plus six years of extended supervision on licence. In June 2014, the remaining members joined American singer Geoff Rickly to form a new band, No Devotion.

==History==
===Early years (1997–2000)===
Lostprophets was formed by Ian Watkins and Lee Gaze in 1997 in Pontypridd, Wales, after their previous band Fleshbind disbanded. They could not find a singer, so Watkins decided he would switch from drums to be the frontman and they recruited Mike Chiplin on drums. Mike Lewis joined a few months later as bassist. Both Lewis and Watkins were also in the metalcore band Public Disturbance, until 1998 and 2000 respectively.

Lostprophets started out as part of the fledgling South Wales scene—playing gigs at venues across Wales including T.J.&#x27;s in Newport. From there, they went on to tour the UK circuit. The band recorded three demos during this time: &quot;Here comes the Party&quot;, &quot;Para Todas las Putas Celosas&quot;, which translates from Spanish as &quot;For all the jealous whores&quot;, and &quot;The Fake Sound of Progress&quot;. These were produced by Stuart Richardson, who joined the band as bassist for the latter recording. Mike Lewis at this point switched to rhythm guitar. &quot;The Fake Sound of Progress&quot; also included the addition of DJ Stepzak, who would remain with the band for around a year. The first three tracks from their third demo were refined and re-recorded for the release of their debut album of the same name: the title track, &quot;MOAC Supreme&quot; and &quot;Stopquote&quot;—the latter two were renamed &quot;A Thousand Apologies&quot; and &quot;Awkward&quot;, respectively. All of the EPs are out of print, and are very rare.

The band caught the attention of the two music publishers &quot;Kerrang!&quot; and &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; magazines, receiving glancing reviews from both. In 1999 they signed in with Independent label Visible Noise.

===&quot;The Fake Sound of Progress&quot; (2000–2002)===

The band&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Fake Sound of Progress&quot; was released through Visible Noise in November. Recorded in less than two weeks for £4,000 the record drew on a wide range of influences. It would be re-released the following year through Columbia Records. Shortly after the completion of the album, DJ Stepzak decided he would not commit to the band and was replaced with musician Jamie Oliver, who was originally the band&#x27;s photographer, but was told by the bands management that someone who was not part of the band or crew members could not join them on tour, so Oliver bought a set of turntables and quickly became the band&#x27;s DJ.

&quot;The Fake Sound of Progress&quot; featured many references to 1980s pop-culture. In addition to the Duran Duran reference in the band&#x27;s name, there was an image of Venger from the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; TV series on the album sleeve notes, as well as song titles like &quot;Shinobi vs. Dragon Ninja&quot; and &quot;Kobrakai&quot;. The first song&#x27;s title was a reference to the video games &quot;Shinobi&quot; and &quot;Bad Dudes vs. Dragon Ninja&quot;, while the second was an alternative spelling of Cobra Kai, the name of the karate dojo in the &quot;Karate Kid&quot; movies. Another reference is the use of the VF-1 Valkyrie in Battroid mode from the 1982 anime &quot;The Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot; as part of the album illustration.

The band worked with producer Michael Barbiero to remaster the album, and this new remastered version of the album was released in November 2001. The album appears to have divided the band&#x27;s existing fan base where the first accusations of selling out were levelled at the band from the underground music scene within which they achieved their first success.

During this period, Lostprophets built up a strong live following with support slots to popular acts such as Pitchshifter, Linkin Park and Deftones, as well as several headlining stints of their own. They also took part in the successful Nu-Titans tour with Defenestration among other new UK metal acts of the time. Co-headlining the 2002 Deconstruction Tour in London, supporting acts included Mighty Mighty Bosstones and the Mad Caddies. Lostprophets featured on a bill consisting of more traditionally punk oriented acts. This provoked hostility from certain members of the audience, who were upset at Lostprophets inclusion on such a bill. The band subsequently toured with Ozzfest, played at Glastonbury and the Reading and Leeds Festival. They also appeared on a number of TV shows, including &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;. They also performed as part of the 2002 NME Carling Awards tour.

===&quot;Start Something&quot; (2003–2004)===
After the extensive touring cycle for &quot;The Fake Sound of Progress&quot; finally ended, the band took a brief break before beginning the process of writing new material for &quot;Start Something&quot; at Frontline Studios in Caerphilly, Wales. They then entered Los Angeles&#x27;s Barefoot Studio for a recording process that lasted from March until September 2003, with producer Eric Valentine. Valentine had previously produced albums for Queens of the Stone Age and Good Charlotte.

The first single released from the album was the song &quot;Burn Burn&quot;, the music video for which began receiving heavy rotation on satellite and cable channels like MTV2, Kerrang! TV and Scuzz in the UK. The song attracted some criticism, however, as the opening bore a striking resemblance to &quot;Mother Mary&quot;, a song from the band Far&#x27;s &quot;Water and Solutions&quot; album. The band themselves even conceded in interviews that the singing pattern bore an undeniable similarity to the Adamski song &quot;Killer&quot;.

&quot;Burn Burn&quot; was released on 3 November 2003, and was originally scheduled to be closely followed by the release of the album. The release of the album was delayed several times and a headlining tour of the UK, was also postponed during this time. The band rescheduled the cancelled UK shows, with the exception of their scheduled appearance at the Reading and Leeds Festivals, stating in magazine interviews that honouring those commitments would have meant leaving the recording studio while the album was only half completed.

The album&#x27;s second single &quot;Last Train Home&quot; was released on 27 December 2003, and quickly became a smash hit worldwide. The single became the band&#x27;s second single to chart in the United States, beating out other UK rock band The Darkness&#x27; single &quot;I Believe in a Thing Called Love&quot; (released in November 2003), charting twelve spots higher on Billboard&#x27;s Mainstream Rock charts upon release in December 2003. &quot;Last Train Home&quot; became the highest-charting single in the United States from any UK artist released in 2003. The song further gained much popularity in the United States through radio airplay and the music video saw regular rotation on MTV, generating much anticipation for the album in America. The song would later be ranked #10 on Billboard&#x27;s year-end rock charts in the United States.

The album was released in the UK on 2 February 2004, and was commercially successful, achieving number four in the UK Albums Chart and selling over 415,000 copies. The album has sold over 687,000 copies in the US alone according to Nielsen Soundscan although in a 2012 interview with Gigwise Lee Gaze stated it had sold 890,000 copies in the US. Worldwide the album has sold 2.5 million copies according to BBC Wales. The critical response from mainstream magazines was mostly positive, though the response from rock publications such as &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; and &quot;Rock Sound&quot; was sometimes tepid. To promote the album, they toured North America, Europe and as part of the Big Day Out festival in Australia and New Zealand. The tour for this record culminated on 21 November 2004, at a sold-out show in Cardiff International Arena.

===&quot;Liberation Transmission&quot; (2005–2007)===
On 19 June 2005, founding member Mike Chiplin left the group to pursue other musical opportunities. Since then, he joined another band called The Unsung, and played with Accident Music until their split in 2011, which also featured Chris Morgan of Midasuno and former Funeral for a Friend guitarist Darran Smith. He has also opened up his own practice-studio for young people to start bands.

The remaining members began working on material for the next album. Due to the lengthy gap between &quot;The Fake Sound of Progress&quot; and &quot;Start Something&quot;, and the backlash that grew against the band because of it, the remaining band members stated in various interviews that they wanted to release their third album in early 2006. As with &quot;Start Something&quot;, the band wrote and recorded demo tracks for the album (with Ian Watkins playing the drums) in a UK recording studio before completing the album in America. &quot;Liberation Transmission&quot; was recorded in Hawaii, and saw the band work with Bob Rock. Drummer Josh Freese (of the Vandals and A Perfect Circle) recorded ten out of the twelve drum tracks for this album (Ilan Rubin recorded &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Screaming!!!&quot; and &quot;For All These Times Son, for All These Times&quot;).

The band returned to their roots, playing a series of small venues across South Wales. They also headlined Give It a Name, a two-day event with My Chemical Romance. These shows featured the first live appearance of then-17-year-old Ilan Rubin on drums and the live premiere of songs &quot;Rooftops (A Liberation Broadcast)&quot;, &quot;A Town Called Hypocrisy&quot; and &quot;The New Transmission&quot;. The album itself was released on 26 June 2006 (27 June in the US), and became the first Lostprophets album to reach number one on the UK Albums Chart. The album saw the band adopt a more contemporary sound with far less emphasis on screaming than previous releases (exceptions being songs &quot;Everyday Combat&quot; and &quot;For All These Times Son, for All These Times&quot;).

Lostprophets began a full-fledged UK tour on 3 July 2006. As with their warm-up gigs prior to the album&#x27;s release, the band selected South Wales-based support bands for this tour. The band followed this with another UK tour in November, and then followed their UK dates with a European tour in France, Germany, and several other countries. The main support for this was the Blackout. They returned to the UK for an Arena tour in April 2007, from 18 April to 22nd. The scheduled venues were: Glasgow (SECC); Manchester (MEN Arena); Birmingham (NIA) &amp; London (Wembley Arena). Lostprophets also played at the Full Ponty festival in Wales on 26 May 2007. The support acts included Paramore and the Blackout. The album has sold over 625,000 copies worldwide.

===&quot;The Betrayed&quot; (2007–2010)===

Writing and recording the band&#x27;s fourth studio album began in early 2007. Originally the band stated that they wanted the album released in 2007; however, due to both touring and being unhappy with the results of their work in the studio, the band did not keep to their original release plan. Despite recording an entire album&#x27;s worth of material with producer John Feldmann, this work was shelved in favour of material they later recorded and produced themselves, with recording sessions for what would later be known as &quot;The Betrayed&quot; beginning in November 2008. Consequently, the album was not released until 13 January 2010, where it reached a peak of 3 on the UK Albums Chart.

Throughout the earlier part of 2008, the band performed several dates, including Download Festival which they headlined on the Sunday night, V Festival and Rock am Ring and Rock im Park, as well as a small number of performances around the UK. They also headlined the NME/Radio 1 tent at 2009&#x27;s Reading and Leeds Festival.

The band claimed that &quot;The Betrayed&quot; is &quot;by far the finest, darkest and most real album&quot; of their career. Originally, Ian Watkins stated he wanted the new album to be &quot;nastier&quot; and &quot;darker&quot; than previous efforts, with more energy and vibe than before. In a blog post, guitarist Mike Lewis suggested that Ilan Rubin (who subsequently left the band to join Nine Inch Nails) was very much a large part of the writing/recording process. Following Rubin&#x27;s departure, Luke Johnson of Beat Union was officially announced as the band&#x27;s new drummer in August 2009. During this time, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; published a &quot;world exclusive&quot; article on Lostprophets, revealing the album&#x27;s title, and its release date of January 2010. In a later interview with Kerrang in early 2009, Watkins stated that the record was &quot;the most honest album&quot; the band has ever done, and that overall the record was &quot;a lot grittier and sleazier&quot;, while also stating that did not mean &quot;it won&#x27;t be catchy&quot;, but that it would not be done &quot;in such a twee way&quot;. When speaking about what the record would sound like, Jamie Oliver stated that he felt it had &quot;the bite that &quot;Start Something&quot; had, with the song-ability of &quot;Liberation Transmission&quot; but personality of &quot;The Fake Sound of Progress&quot;&quot;.
The first single from the new album, &quot;It&#x27;s Not the End of the World, But I Can See It from Here&quot;, was aired for the first time on BBC Radio 1 on 19 August. It was subsequently released on 12 October 2009 and reached No. 16 on the Official UK chart. This was followed by &quot;Where We Belong&quot;, which was released on 4 January 2010.

The band commenced their UK tour with support from Kids in Glass Houses, Hexes, We are the Ocean, and Sharks, in February 2010. The Doncaster date to the UK tour was cancelled and refunded, but no reason was given for the cancellation. The Port Talbot date of the tour was postponed and moved to a different venue due to a fire at the Afan Lido leisure centre. The show took place on 1 May at the Cardiff International Arena. Lostprophets confirmed that they would tour Australia. The tour took place on 27 March 2010 at The Roundhouse, NSW, Sydney. The band also played at the 2010 Reading and Leeds Festival.

Stuart Richardson commented in 2019 that &quot;towards the end of 2009–2011 we realised Ian had a depressingly sad drug addiction. It just snuck up on us&quot;.

===&quot;Weapons&quot; (2011–2012)===

In early 2011, the band rented a house in Norfolk that served as their studio while composing a demo and pre-producing for a new album. The band was also featured on British rapper/producer Labrinth&#x27;s album in late 2011.

In August 2011, the band went on a short UK tour, with dates in Cardiff, Bournemouth, Oxford and Norwich, as well as the two V Festival dates, and an additional appearance at the Sziget Festival in Budapest, Hungary. During this short tour, the band debuted live a new song from the upcoming album, tentatively titled &quot;Bring &#x27;Em Down&quot;.

The band&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Weapons&quot;, was released through Epic Records on 2 April 2012, leaving their long-time served record Visible Noise. Supported by a subsequent tour in the UK. &quot;Weapons&quot; was produced by Ken Andrews at NRG Recording Studios in Hollywood, California. The band released a teaser track in anticipation of their new album entitled &quot;Better Off Dead&quot; in January 2012, though it was confirmed the song is not an official single. The band played at Australia&#x27;s Soundwave festival in February 2012 before heading back to the UK for an extensive tour in support of the new album in April and May supported by Modestep. The band&#x27;s first official single of the album, &quot;Bring &#x27;em Down&quot;, was released on 6 February 2012, after debuting on Zane Lowe&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 show.

On 9 April, Lostprophets announced that they had signed to Fearless Records and would release &quot;Weapons&quot; in the United States on 19 June 2012. Lostprophets played in the Cardiff Motorpoint Arena on 28 April to promote their new album &quot;Weapons&quot;, and played their second studio album &quot;Start Something&quot; in its entirety. This show turned out to be a complete disaster for the band; Stuart Richardson commented in 2019 that Watkins &quot;didn&#x27;t move for the whole set&quot; and that he &quot;sung the wrong words&quot;. This led to the band staging an intervention with Watkins, telling him that if he did not clean up his act he would be fired. They were extremely frustrated with him following this performance and even considered disbanding entirely as a result of it. Watkins checked into rehab during a two-month break in the band&#x27;s touring.

Lostprophets played select shows in Vans Warped Tour 2012, playing from 12 July through 5 August. Watkins relapsed into drug use during this tour and missed a show, leading to the band having to perform a set with Jamie Oliver on lead vocals. Watkins&#x27;s temporary absence from the tour led to Stuart Richardson having a violent altercation with him.

The band toured the UK extensively again in November 2012 to coincide with a headline performance at the Vans Warped Tour 2012 UK. They performed what would eventually become their final show at the Newport Centre, Newport, Wales on 14 November 2012.

Three videos were released from &quot;Weapons&quot;. On 3 December 2012, Watkins tweeted, &quot;En route to the big smoke to shoot our new musical video&quot;. When the band had previously debuted &quot;Bring &#x27;em down&quot; on Zane Lowe&#x27;s show in February, Watkins stated that the fourth single was to be a &quot;power ballad&quot;. However, a finished video was never released.

===Watkins&#x27;s arrest and band&#x27;s break-up (2012–2013)===
On 19 December 2012, Watkins was charged with thirteen sexual offences against children, including the attempted rape of a one-year-old girl. Watkins originally denied the charges. The other band members posted a message on their website stating that they were &quot;learning about the details of the investigation along with you&quot; and concluding: &quot;It is a difficult time for us and our families, and we want to thank our fans for their support as we seek answers.&quot; They subsequently cancelled all tour dates.

On 1 October 2013, Lostprophets announced that they were disbanding &quot;after nearly a year of coming to terms with our heartache&quot;. The post was signed by all members of the band except Watkins. On 30 November, the members released a lengthy statement in response to Watkins pleading guilty to attempted rape and sexual assault of a child under 13, stating that they were &quot;heartbroken, angry, and disgusted&quot;. They stated that they had been unaware of his crimes, and that though working with him had become &quot;a constant, miserable challenge&quot;, they had &quot;never imagined him capable of behaviour of the type he has now admitted&quot;. They urged any other victims to contact the authorities. On 18 December 2013, Watkins was sentenced to 29 years in prison, plus six years on extended licence, with a possibility of parole after serving two-thirds of his sentence.

Immediately after Watkins was sentenced, the BBC banned the entire Lostprophets back catalogue from being played on their stations.

===Aftermath (2014–present)===

On 25 April 2014, it was confirmed by ex-Thursday frontman Geoff Rickly that he would be working with the remaining band-members on their new project, from a record label perspective through his own label, Collect Records, as a producer and also joining them as a vocalist. Rickly regarded their new material as having influences from Joy Division, New Order and The Cure. It was announced the new band would be called No Devotion and they released their first and second singles, &quot;Stay&quot;, and &quot;Eyeshadow&quot;, on 1 July 2014.

In November 2016, it was reported that Watkins&#x27;s Twitter account had become active again, new clips of music had surfaced via two SoundCloud accounts (&quot;L&#x27;Amour La Morgue&quot; and &quot;Megalelz&quot;), which were reportedly attributed to him, and that Lostprophets&#x27; website had been changed to a single page that described them as &quot;The Straight Edge British Metal Band&quot;. The site domain has since become inactive, as of 2023 redirecting to an unrelated dead URL. No further activity has since been spotted from Watkins&#x27;s accounts.

==Musical style and lyrical themes==
Lostprophets have been categorised as nu metal, alternative rock, post-grunge, hard rock, rap rock, alternative metal, heavy metal, post-hardcore, pop-punk, and pop metal. Their music is termed an aggressive style of rock, blending strong driving guitars, groove and bounce, and pop elements and accessibility.

The punk side to the band&#x27;s music has been noted, again specifically of the pop variety. The influence of heavy metal on their music is also noted, although this varies from song to song. Their music has been praised as powerful, combining softer melodies with an aggressive edge, with screamed vocals and catchy riffs, while some have also stated it has a derivative, formulaic or forgettable nature.

Watkins&#x27;s lyrics range from sombre to aggressive, and have been described as often conveying a feeling of disillusionment with topics such as relationships or social groups, albeit frequently delivered in a rousing manner even when this is the case. Critics have compared his singing style to Faith No More vocalist Mike Patton, with Watkins citing this band as his biggest influence in 2004. He said, &quot;it&#x27;s not a conscious thing. But the notes I choose to sing, and the melodies (we write) come from them because I spent so much time listening growing up.&quot; Lostprophets also garnered many other comparisons with more contemporary American bands of the early 2000s. Regarding the perception of them as an American influenced band, Watkins commented in 2004 &quot;we don&#x27;t care if you think we&#x27;re from Guam. Just as long as you listen.&quot;

<doc id="492822" wikidata="Q608361" url="?curid=492822" title="Nord-Ouest (department)">
<text>Nord-Ouest (French) or Nòdwès (Haitian Creole; both meaning &quot;North West&quot;) is one of the ten departments of Haiti as well as the northernmost one. It has an area of and a population of 728,807 (2015 Census). Its capital is Port-de-Paix.

==Department==
There is a proposal for the department to become 2 departments, Nord-Ouest and Bas-Nordouest (Mole-St-Nicolas) with the Horn-of-Artibonite.

==History==
===Taino Period===
The region of the Great North of Haiti was under the administration of the Marien casicazgo, the Taino-chief Guacanaric was the one to have received Christopher Columbus on his first voyage to Ayiti. Columbus explained how the Taino chief offers him safe harbor after one of his boats sunk. Columbus described the place has Paradise Valley or Valparaiso and named the island La Isla Espanola. This department specifically the town of Mole-Saint-Nicolas is believed to be the first place on the island to have received a Christian cross.

The Island of Tortuga was part of the Taino dominion under the name of Cahini.

===French Period===
The Spaniards lost interest in the western part of the island leaving it vacant for French, Dutch and British pirates, and buccaneers, making Tortuga one of the biggest pirates hubs in the Caribbean. Under the French administration, the Nord-Ouest was part of the Ouest department and many French Governors governed the island from Le Môle.

===Haitian Revolution===
Early on the N-O departement was a strategic point for Toussaint Louverture, one of the first diplomatic and pre-independence treaty signed between the Indigènes and the British was signed by Toussaint and British Officer Maitland and thus the Indigènes took controlled of the part of Saint-Domingue that was under British rules.
After Napoléon sent his troop to capture the Toussaint and put them under French slavery, the Haitian Officer Maurepas under the order of Toussaint burned down the city of Port-de-Paix and went uphill to Les Trois Pavillons fort. Maurepas was later on captured by the French and they drowned him in the Bay of Cap-Haitian.

Francois Lamort Cappois and the 9th demi-brigade freed the city of Port-de-Paix and later on the island of Tortuga on April 12, 1803.
Le Mole officially became under Haitian control 10 days after the Battle of Vertières with the help of Vincent Pourcely colonel in the 9th demi-brigade.

===Haitian Period===
Cappoix-Lamort commander of Port-de-Paix is a signatory of the Haitian Declaration of Independence.
Francois Cappoix the brilliant and vaillaint Haitian officers was trapped by Henry 1st men and assassinated in Limonade. The department was in open rebellion with the Crown. Pétion in the West who needed ally after the rebellion of Rigaud in the South and Goman in the Grand&#x27;Anse, sent troops to support the N-O.
Henry 1st crushed the rebellion and granted amnitice to the rebelled troops.

The town of Môle Saint-Nicolas is located in the Nord-Ouest. Ever since Columbus landed here in 1492 and named the island Hispaniola, Môle St-Nicolas has been of interest to the colonials, including the British, Spanish, French, and the Americans due to its strategic location on the Windward Passage, just miles from Cuba.

The Mole-St-Nicolas affair was a diplomatic incident between the Haitians and the Americans because the Americans wanted a safe harbor to control the Winward Passage after the construction of the Panama Canal. The Haitian intellectual Anténor Firmin was remarkable in that affair. 

Sometime during the 19th century, it was created out of the Nord and Ouest departments.

==Geography==
The department is bordered to the north by Cuba, Bahamas, and Florida, and has direct access to the Atlantic through the Tortuga Canal, on the west the Windward Passage, the south Gulf of Gonave and Artibonite Department and the east and North Department.

At the western tip of the department, the Mole Peninsula protects the city of the same name.

With the exception of Tortuga Island (La Tortue) and the coastal area near Port-de-Paix, the northwest is mostly arid and barren. In fact, the department has Haiti&#x27;s second biggest satellite island under its administrative control, located less than 10 km offshore.

At Les Palmiste on the eastern coast visit a pre-Columbian rock carving presumed to be of native Taino origin of a goddess at La Grotte au Bassin exists.

Due to a lack of water management, the Trois-Rivières often flood the city of Port-de-Paix during the rainy season located on its east shore. On the west shore of the river, there is a lagoon.

==Economy==
===Agriculture===
Port-de-Paix, which was once a large exporter of coffee and bananas, now imports goods and produce from Miami.
The Bombardopolis Plateau is another area of sustainable potential for industry, tourism, ecological reserve, and agriculture. 
Salt production is a major industry in the area.

===Tourism===
Tortuga island, once the biggest pirate base in the Caribbean is a popular tourist site and is represented frequently in films and movies based on piracy. Named for the smooth shape that reminded travelers of a turtle&#x27;s shell, Tortuga&#x27;s best beach is Pointe Saline at the western tip of the small island.

There are several ruined forts along the coast. On clear nights the Guantánamo Province of Cuba can be seen.
This area is dry and offers little shade but has a beautiful shoreline.

Port-à-L&#x27;Écu is the point of interest in leisure tourism.

==Environment==
It is one of Haiti&#x27;s dryest areas, the N-O still offers a unique scenery in Haitian tourist and ecological package. The Canal and the Tortuga island are more or less well preserved although they need to be reinforced. 
Although not having a major plain the Trois-Rivières (Three Rivers), the second longest river after Artibonite offers a productive watershed and valley.

==Transport==
The department has long been isolated from Port-au-Prince, gaining it the nickname of Far-West. 
The RN5 now connects Gonayiv to Gros-Morne and Port-de-Paix. the RN6 from Ouanaminthes to Cap-Haitian is to be continued until Port-de-Paix.

Port-de-Paix is the second biggest port on the Haitian Atlantic coast.

Port-de-Paix has its own airport.

The mountains overlooking the city of Port-de-Paix have great potential for wind energy.

==Culture==
The N-O has two of Haiti&#x27;s major lakoun-Vodoun or Vodoun Yard such as lakoun Vilokan, probably the first lakoun in Ayiti since early Spanish colonial time, and lakoun-Grann-Sent-Àn in Anse-à-Foleur.

==Administrative divisions==
The Department of Nord-Ouest is subdivided into three arrondissements, which are further subdivided into ten communes.

<text>Sud (French, ) or Sid (Haitian Creole; both meaning &quot;South&quot;) is one of the ten departments of Haiti and located in southern Haiti. It has an area of and a population of 774,976. Its capital is Les Cayes.

==History==
===Taino Period===
The department was part of the Xaragua kingdom. The area of Aquin was known as Yakimo a Taino settlement. The island of Vache was named Anigua.

===Spanish Period===
The area of Les Cayes was a Spanish settlement known as Salvatierra de la Sabana or Land Saved from the Water or Sea.

===French Period===
Much like the N-O, the South Department was a pirate hub with famous pirates such as Henri Morgan and many more hiding their loot on the multitude of islands from Grosse Cayes to Isle-à-Vache.

===Haitian Revolution===
The South, in general, was Rigaudin since was under the control of André Rigaud until it definitely switches the hand of Toussaint and the Louverturien. This conflict is known as the Haitian War of Knives opposing two political and economical groups in Haiti even before independence: the Nouveaux-Libres and the Anciens-Libres.

In 1793 after The Great North rebelled after the Bwa-Kayiman Congress, the South was the scene of a group of maroons taking control of a French post at the heights of Les Cayes in Platons and establish their camp. Those maroons were never captured and went higher to Macaya at the attack of the Expedition Troops.

The alliance between the Rigaudin and Louverturien was consolidated at the Congress of Camp-Gerrard, on July 5, 1803, where Dessalines became the leader of the Indigènes Army. Boisrond Tonnerre became a member of Dessalines état-major and Nicolas Geffrard general of the South.

===Haitian Period===
On October 16, 1803, Nicolas Geffrard Sr. and Coco Herne freed the city of Les Cayes from the French expedition troops under the leadership of Brunet.

Nicolas Geffrard commander of the south and Coco Herne commander of Les Cayes are signatories of the Haitian Declaration of Independence.
After the assassination of the Emperor, Haiti was divided into two de jure states, a monarchy and a republic. With the return of André Rigaud, the South became a distinct state separating from Port-au-Prince.
With Michel Domingue, the south claimed separation again.

In 1843, the Manifest of Praslin with Charles Rivière Hérard overthrow the president Jean-Pierre Boyer.

==Demography==
A significant part of the population in this department is of mixed race, people of Arab descent and from the Indian subcontinent. These southern parts of Haiti are where many residents Europeans descended to during tense political turmoil and, in more recent years, have returned and settled alongside black Haitians. Nowadays, this area of the country has become one of the most racially diverse (excluding Port-au-Prince).

==Geography==
The department is bordered to the north by the Grand&#x27;Anse and Nippes, to the west the Winward Passage connecting to Jamaica, south by the Caribbean Sea and to the east by the South-East Department.
The Pic Macaya is an ecological reserve on the north side. The Port-Salut Peninsula extends into the Caribbean Sea. From Flamand to Aquin there is a multitude of minor bays. The south is the province with the most islands, cays, and reefs giving it a particular charm and unique scenery. Some of the notable islands are:
* Isle-à-Vache
* Boyer
* Moustique
* Ramier
* Grosse-Caye
Locals call them &quot;zilè&quot; (islands) versus &quot;granntè&quot; (mainland)

Many rivers cross through the South notably
* La Ravine du Sud
* Cavaillon

Grotte Marijàn&#x27;s Cave is the biggest in Haiti and one of the biggest in the Caribbean.

==Economy==
===Agriculture===
The heart of the department is la Plaine des Cayes one of Haiti&#x27;s biggest plains, where farmers grow notably rice
Many families leave with fishing activities transforming multiple cays into seasonal fishermen settlements.

===Tourism===
The South is reputed of having some of Haiti&#x27;s most pristine beaches such as:
* Port-Salut
* Gelée

==Transport==
The main road through the department is the RN2 connecting Okay to Miragwàn and Pòtoprens
The RD203 connects to Jacmel.
The RD205 connects to Tiburon.

Les Cayes is a major port town.

Due to political troubles in Port-au-Prince, many locals are considering a port and oil terminal in St-Louis du Sud, making the South completely autonomous.

Les Cayes has a national airport Antoine-Simon, which has the potential for International flights connecting Haiti to Jamaica and Venezuela.

Isle-à-Vache has an airport strip and heliport.

<text>Sud-Est (French, ) or Sidès (Haitian Creole; both meaning &quot;South East&quot;) is one of the ten departments of Haiti located in southern Haiti. It has an area of 2,034.10 km2 and a population of 632,601 (2015). Its capital is Jacmel.

==History==
===Taino Period===
The department is part of the &quot;Xaragua kasika&quot; under the leadership of Bohecio and Anacaona. The settlement of Yakimèl was in the area of actual Jacmel City.

===Spanish Period===
Jacmel is one of the earliest Spanish towns in the Caribbean when it was settled by Nicolas Ovando in 1504.

===French Period===
One year after the Treaty of Ryswick, the French formally settle the city through La Compagnie de St-Domingue.

===Haitian Period===
====Haitian Revolution====
Like many of the actual departments in Haiti, by 1791, the different social classes of St-Domingue started rebelling against the status quo. The enslaved under the leadership of Romaine-La-Prophétesse, a mulatto coffee plantation owner, asked for the abolition of slavery and liberty for all. The mixed race under the leadership of André Rigaud asked for equal rights with the whites. These revendications reach their heights in the Pre-Independence Civil War opposing Toussaint&#x27;s northern troops with lieutenants like Dessalines and Rigaud&#x27;s southern troops with lieutenants like Pétion.

====Independence====
On September, 17th 1803, Magloire Ambroise, helped by Cangé and Yayou&#x27;s troops freed Jacmel from the French troops under the leadership of Pageot.

Magloire Ambroise, commander of Jacmel is a signatory of the Act of Independence on January 1.
During the Haitian-Civil war opposing King Henry 1st and President Pétion, the South-East was part of the republic. During that period the Jacmel received the South American Liberator Simon Bolivar, providing him shelter, merchandise, guns, and soldiers. The Grand-Colombia flag was designed in Jacmel based on the Haitian republican flag.

===Modern Period===
The department knew a great financial time at the beginning of the 20th century with the exportation of coffee, resulting in Jacmel&#x27;s unique architecture and culture. The capital city was the first to have electricity and a telephone line in the Caribbean.

==Geography==
The South-East is bordered in the north by the West Department, on the west, by the South Department, the south by the Caribbean Sea and on the east by the province of Pedernales province.
The Bay of Jacmel is the biggest bay of the department, followed by the Bay of Bainet (meaning clear bay). The most important rivers are the Jacmel river and the Bainet river.
The coastal plain of the department allows a possible expansion of the capital. The department has one of the longest coastal lines in the country.

===2010 earthquake===

Like the whole Xaragua Peninsula the department is on the fault line of Plantain-Garden-Enriquillo resulting in many earthquakes in the department&#x27;s history.
Jacmel in Jacmel Arrondissement, a city with many Haitian colonial heritage buildings, was devastated by a 7.0 magnitude tremblor on 12 January 2010, collapsing much of that heritage architecture.
Since then many of the buildings have been rebuilt.

==Environment==
The S-E shares the La Visite National Park with the West. Around Belle-Anse the S-E harbors the Three Lagoons National Park.

==Economy==
With a sizable port like Jacmel and direct access to the Dominican Republic, the S_E has great potential for economic development, especially in tourism and arts.

===Tourism and Arts===
Jacmel, Marigot, and Belle-Anse have the capacity to receive tourists.
Raymond-des-Bains is a famous beach in the department.

Jacmel has a notable carnival activity in the Caribbean region10, and one of its characters (the robalagallina, imitation or caricature of the planter&#x27;s wife) has been adopted by the carnival of the Dominican Republic11. The festive behavior of the Jacmelians earned them international fame.

During the Easter celebrations, a great parade of rara bands under the rhythms of petro and congo, is organized there. The civil authorities organize it in order to promote Haitian culture which is closely linked to that of southern Africa.

Jacmel is also known for its manifestations of the patronal feast on the first of May each year. It is the feast of the patron saint of the city, Saint Jacques and Saint Philippe. During this festival, the musical groups of Haiti meet in Jacmel and its surroundings for concerts which are called in Haitian Creole &quot;ball&quot;. On May 18, the Jacmeliens celebrate their flag with large parades of brass bands throughout the city. In November Jacmel perpetuates the traditional &quot;Feast of the Dead&quot; (November 1 and 2).

Jacmel also hosts a Francophone film festival in 201912,13, and a festival dedicated to jazz.

===Agriculture and Fishing===
===Mining===
The S-E has great potential for mining notably for iridium in the area of Belot.

==Transport==
The RN4 connects the department to the West and Léogane.
RD402 connects to Anse-à-Pitres
RD401 connects to Cote-de-Fer.

==Administrative divisions==
The Department of Sud-Est is subdivided into three arrondissements, which are further subdivided into ten communes.

<doc id="492836" wikidata="Q1687904" url="?curid=492836" title="Jersey (knitted clothing)">
<text>Traditionally, a jersey is an item of knitted clothing, generally made of wool or cotton, with sleeves, worn as a pullover, as it does not open at the front, unlike a cardigan. It is usually close-fitting and machine knitted in contrast to a guernsey that is more often hand knit with a thicker yarn. The word is usually used interchangeably with sweater.

==Etymology==
The garment&#x27;s name originates from the British Crown Dependency of Jersey in the English Channel. The island became a large exporter of knitted goods in the Elizabethan era.

The name is also used more generally to refer to the knit fabric particular to the sweater.

<text>Grand&#x27;Anse (, ), Grandans or Grantans (; both meaning &quot;Big Cove&quot;) is one of the ten departments of Haiti. Its capital is Jérémie.

==History==
===Taino Period===
Grand&#x27;Anse was part of the Xaragua kasika with settlements including Mamey, the modern-day town of Abricot. Abricot is still known today as &quot;the Indian&#x27;s Paradise.&quot;

===French Period===
It is said by the locals that the capital city of Jérémie is named after a French fisherman who established himself in the area because of its isolation from the rest of the country. Due to its rather mountainous geography, Grand&#x27;Anse did not support many plantations, and was therefore populated largely by white and mixed-race communities with some of the best schools in the colony. Some slaveowners sent their children to schools in Grand&#x27;Anse instead of sending them back to France for education.

===British Period===
The department was briefly under British control in 1793.

===Haitian Period===
====Haitian Revolution====
While under the control of André Rigaud, more than 20 slaves died in prison in Jérémie. While their cause of death was not clear, Toussaint Louverture used their deaths as an excuse to portray Rigaud as anti-black and ordered his then-lieutenant Jean-Jacques Dessalines to attack the town. The battle was one of the most important scenes of the Haitian Revolution, with , an officer, becoming known as the &quot;Liberator of the Grand&#x27;Anse.&quot; Grand&#x27;Anse was the first department to come under the control of the Armée Indigène, and was captured from French troops on 4 August 1803.

====Independence====
Férou is a signatory of the Act of Independence of 1 January. The first Haitian Civil War split the country between a monarchy in the north and a republic in the south. Grand&#x27;Anse &quot;de facto&quot; sided with the monarchy under the leadership of Jean-Baptiste Perrier (under the alias Goman) who established a government in the Macaya mountain chain known as the Kongo Kingdom.

Fort Marfranc was constructed under order of Dessalines in order to protect Jérémie. It is the burial place of Férou.

For 20 years the Kongo Kingdom based in Grand-Doco was financed by the self-declared king of the northern monarchy Henri Christophe; Goman was titled duke. The department later fell under the control of the republic under the leadership of Jean-Pierre Boyer.

There were many battles between the national and liberal political parties in Grand&#x27;Anse in the 1800s.

====Modern Period====
The Grand&#x27;Anse department used to be part of the Sud department until 1962 when it was created. The department was reduced further in 2003, with the creation of a new department of Nippes from the Miragoâne and Anse-à-Veau arrondissements.

Before the 2003 split, it had a population of around 600,000 (2002). Afterward, the population at the 2003 Census was 337,516. The area of the department (after the split) is .
==Geography and environment==
The department is bordered in the north by the Gulf of Gonave, west by the Winward Passage connecting to Jamaica, south by the South Department, and east by the Nippes Department. It is one of the smallest departments but it is one of the most pollutant-free due to its isolation. The westernmost point in Haiti at Cap les Irois is located in Grand&#x27;Anse. The Macaya mountain chain in the Massif de la Hotte holds the second-highest mountain in Haiti and is one of the most important environmental reserves with multiple endemic animals and plants; the Plaintain Garden-Enriquillo faultline passes through it as well. Because of the mountains, it does not have a major plain or plateau for agriculture; however, the Jeremi Valley is still a major agricultural hub. Rivers in the department include the Grand&#x27;Anse and Voldrogue rivers. Grand&#x27;Anse features many islands, such as Grande Cayemite, Petite Cayemite, the Cayemite reefs and cayes, and Navaasa Island. Navassa is currently the subject of a territorial dispute between Haiti and the United States, which administers it through the US Fish and Wildlife Service.

==Transportation==
Grand&#x27;Anse is one of the most isolated departments in Haiti. Jérémie is the largest port though it is mostly used for cabotage. The Jérémie airport can accommodate national flights from Port-au-Prince.

The RN7 of the Haitian national road system connects Jérémie to Les Cayes. A road connecting it to Nippes has been proposed as well.

==Economy==
Grand&#x27;Anse has large potential in the agro-industry domain and the tourism sector like leisure tourism, eco-tourism, and historical and cultural tourism.

The most famous beaches in the departement are Anse d&#x27;Azur and Anse du Clerc.

==Culture==
The people of Grand&#x27;Anse are known for their hospitality and culinary skills, with their most known dish being Tonmtonm-Kalalou. It is a Haitian dish similar to West African Fufu. Many farmers use a &quot;pipirit&quot; (Haitian bamboo raft) to transport their crops to the market towns.

==Administrative divisions==
The Department of Grand&#x27;Anse is subdivided into three arrondissements, which are further subdivided into thirteen communes.

*Arrondissement of Anse d&#x27;Hainault
**Anse-d&#x27;Hainault 
**Dame-Marie

<text>A sweatshirt is a long-sleeved pullover shirt or jacket fashioned out of thick, usually cotton, cloth material. Sweatshirts are almost exclusively casual attire and hence not as formal as some sweaters. Sweatshirts may or may not have a hood. A sweatshirt with a hood is now usually referred to as a hoodie, although more formal media may still use the term &quot;hooded sweatshirt&quot;.

==History==
In 1920, Benjamin Russell Jr., a quarterback for the Alabama Crimson Tide Football team, was tired of the constant chafing and itching caused by their wool football uniforms. He worked with his father, whose company Russell Manufacturing Company made women&#x27;s and children&#x27;s knit garments, to come up with a better option. They created a thick cotton practice jersey that was a modification of a ladies&#x27; union suit top. These loose, collarless pullovers were the first sweatshirts. A new division of the company, focusing solely on the production of sweatshirts, became the Russell Athletic Company.

The sweatshirt&#x27;s potential as a portable advertising tool was discovered in the 1960s when U.S. universities began printing their names on them to exhibit school pride. The sweatshirt, along with the T-shirt, provided a cheap and effective way of disseminating information on a mass scale. The T-shirt slogan fad of the 1970s inevitably translated to sweatshirts. Due to the relative simplicity of customization and the power of clever graphics combined with catchphrases, sweatshirts became a vehicle for personal expression for both the designer and the wearer.

In Australia, the sweatshirt is referred to as a &#x27;Sloppy Joe&#x27;.

<doc id="492891" wikidata="Q11238527" url="?curid=492891" title="Pe'z">
<text>was a Japanese jazz instrumental band consisting of five men, dubbed &quot;The Samurai Jazz Band.&quot; They were signed onto Sony Music Japan from 2008 until their split in 2015.

==History==
PE&#x27;Z began their music careers playing live on the streets of Shibuya in the center of Tokyo during the summer of 2000. Word of mouth spread quickly and they began pulling in large crowds which sometimes totaled up to 600.

In just three years, the band played in ten outdoor music festivals throughout Japan, including Newport Jazz Festival &#x27;02 in Madaro, Mt. Fuji Jazz Festival 2002 in Shizuoka, and Rising Sun Rock Festival in Hokkaido. In September 2002 their first full album, &quot;Kugatsu no Sola&quot; (&quot;September Sky&quot;) was released, reaching No.10 on the billboard. In March 2003 they received an award for &quot;New Artist Of The Year&quot; at the 17th annual Japan Gold Disc Awards.

In August 2003 they participated in the re-mix of Japanese duo called Chemistry&#x27;s 8th single &quot;Ashita E Kaeru/Us&quot; (&quot;Return to Tomorrow&quot;).

That same year, Masayuki Hiizumi joined Shiina Ringo&#x27;s backing band as a keyboard player for her nationwide tour. In 2004, he joined Shiina&#x27;s new band Tokyo Jihen, but eventually left the group to focus his attention back to PE&#x27;Z in the next year. He later released a solo album entitled &quot;5+2=11&quot; under the moniker H Zett M.

In October 2005 PE&#x27;Z performed at UK&#x27;s In the City along with fellow Japanese artists DMBQ and The Rodeo Carburettor. The quintet followed that with numerous performances in Europe (including a live show on the street in Amsterdam). The following year, 2006, they participated in both Canadian Music Week (CMW) and South by Southwest (SXSW), as well as giving a live performance in South Korea in between. Their gig at SXSW was subsequently followed with their first-ever US tour as part of Japan Nite, performing in New York City, Cambridge, Philadelphia, Chicago, Denver, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, and Los Angeles.

In September 2006, PE&#x27;Z released a three-track EP with the British soul singer Nate James, featuring an original track, &quot;Live for the Groove,&quot; a reworked Nate James track, &quot;Universal,&quot; and a cover of &quot;Hard to Handle&quot; by Otis Redding. They subsequently released a 32-track double album entitled &quot;Funny Day &amp; Hard Night&quot; on March 25, 2007. This was followed by a second &quot;Realive&quot; DVD, which featured the band playing an outdoor Venue, with two sets which followed the Day/Night themes of the double CD, with the first played roughly at sundown and the second at night, with house and LED lighting.

In 2014 they released a new original album called &quot;Chisou&quot;, but in December 2014, drummer Kou posted to the band&#x27;s official webpage that the group would dissolve in the following year. The band went on a final tour of Japan from January to April 2015 as well as appearing in several Japanese music festivals.

== pe&#x27;zmoku ==
In 2007, the band collaborated with the alternative folk singer suzumoku, with whom they co-founded pe&#x27;zmoku. pe&#x27;zmoku performed for the first time during the encore of PE&#x27;Z&#x27;s annual special live &quot;EN-MUSUBI&quot; at the end of the same year.

In 2008, they started in earnest. They recorded the ending theme &quot;Gallop&quot; for the anime series &quot;Bleach&quot;, and the ending theme &quot;Ano Kaze ni Notte&quot; for &quot;Valkyria Chronicles&quot;.

Following a brief disappearance by suzumoku, impromptu cancellations of several concerts were forced on the band in March 2009. As of October 2009 the band is on an indefinite hiatus.

<text>The Battle of Rain took place on 15 April 1632 near Rain in Bavaria during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. It was fought by a Swedish army under Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, and a Catholic League force led by Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly. The battle resulted in a Swedish victory, while Tilly was severely wounded and later died of his injuries.

Outnumbered and with many inexperienced troops, Tilly built defensive works along the River Lech, centred on the town of Rain, hoping to delay Gustavus long enough for Imperial reinforcements under Albrecht von Wallenstein to reach him. On 14 April, the Swedes bombarded the defences with artillery, then crossed the river the next day, inflicting nearly 3,000 casualties, including Tilly. On 16th, Maximilian of Bavaria ordered a retreat, abandoning his supplies and guns.

Despite this victory, the Swedes had been drawn away from their bases in Northern Germany and when Maximilian linked up with Wallenstein found themselves besieged in Nuremberg. This led to the largest battle of the war on 3 September, when an assault on the Imperial camp outside the town was bloodily repulsed.

==Background==

Swedish intervention in the Thirty Years&#x27; War began in June 1630 when nearly 18,000 troops under Gustavus Adolphus landed in Pomerania, financed by French subsidies. Supported by Saxony and Brandenburg-Prussia, victory at Breitenfeld in September 1631 gave Gustavus control over much of north and central Germany. While Elector John George invaded Habsburg lands in Bohemia, Gustavus prepared to attack Austria, while his subordinate Gustav Horn advanced into Franconia.

When Horn occupied the Bavarian town of Bamberg in February 1632, Tilly marched north from Nördlingen with 22,000 men, and briefly recaptured it on 9 March. He was too weak to follow up this success and withdrew to Ingolstadt, which controlled a major bridge over the Danube. However, fearing the impact of Tilly&#x27;s advance on the morale of his German allies, Gustavus abandoned plans to invade Austria. Instead, he moved into Bavaria from his winter quarters in Mainz, where by combining his own forces with those led by Horn, Johan Banér, and William, Duke of Saxe-Weimar, he assembled around 37,500 men and 72 guns.

The Swedes entered Nuremberg on 31 March, then captured Donauwörth on 6 April, near where Tilly had established a defensive line along the River Lech. His main force of 22,000 was entrenched around Rain, with a detachment of 5,000 covering another crossing at Augsburg (see Map). Although this meant Gustavus could outflank these positions by passing south of Augsburg, Tilly hoped this would provide time for the main Imperial army under Albrecht von Wallenstein to reach him.

At this point, the Lech river divided into a number of parallel, fast flowing streams, each about 60 to 80 metres wide; the bridge at Rain had been destroyed by Tilly, who placed his inexperienced troops in a strong redoubt with 20 guns, making it a formidable challenge for an attacker. The only other practical route was about five kilometres south of Rain, where there was an island in the middle of the Lech. Bridging this obstacle is considered to be one of Gustavus&#x27; greatest military achievements.

==Battle==
During 13 April, Lennart Torstensson supervised the construction of Swedish artillery positions opposite Rain, creating three batteries of 24 guns each. The next day, he opened fire on Tilly&#x27;s redoubt while Gustavus deployed his troops near the river bank, making it seem he intended an assault. However, this was only a feint, intended to distract their opponents while they gathered boats and materials to build a pontoon bridge over to the island. 

On the morning of 15th, three hundred Finnish &quot;Hakkapeliitta&quot; troops crossed over to the Bavarian side of the river. Having done so, they then dug earthworks for batteries which protected the rest of Gustavus&#x27; army as they followed. Tilly immediately despatched troops to engage the Swedes and a fierce firefight developed as they tried to push them back. However, Gustavus had sent an additional 2,000 cavalry to ford the river two kilometres further north of Rain. These now circled round the redoubt and took the troops defending it in the flank. Tilly&#x27;s right thigh was shattered early in the battle; he was taken unconscious to the rear and died two weeks later, while his second in command, Johann von Aldringen, was temporarily blinded minutes later. 

Maximilian of Bavaria now assumed command and ordered an immediate retreat, covered by his cavalry under Scharffenstein. Both sides suffered around 2,000 casualties each, with the Swedes capturing another 1,000. Although Maximilian was forced to abandon his baggage and artillery, most of his army escaped, helped by a storm and high winds which blocked roads and delayed pursuit.

==Aftermath==
Maximilian reinforced his garrison at Ingolstadt, which repulsed a Swedish attack on 3 May, then withdrew north of the Danube, leaving Bavaria open to the Swedish army. The country was extensively pillaged, while Gustavus made a triumphal entry into Munich on 17 May, confiscating the ducal art collection and capturing over 100 pieces of artillery; it was another three years before Maximilian re-entered his capital. On the other hand, the Swedes were now at the end of long and extremely vulnerable supply lines, while Bavarian peasants waged a bitter guerrilla war in the countryside against the invaders plundering their lands.

Meanwhile Wallenstein raised an Imperial army of 65,000, which he used to expel the Saxons from Bohemia; concerned Saxony might make a separate peace and leave him isolated, Gustavus now summoned his German allies to Nuremberg. As he did so, Wallenstein took 30,000 troops and marched into Bavaria to link up with Maximilian advancing north from Ingoldstadt and on 11 July the two forces met up at Schwabach (see Map above). Gustavus retreated to Fürth just outside Nuremberg where he was besieged by the combined Imperial-Bavarian army, leading to the Battle of the Alte Veste in early September.

<text>The Shire of Cardinia is a local government area in Victoria, Australia, in the south-east of Melbourne between Western Port and the Yarra Ranges on the outskirts of Melbourne. It has an area of 1,283 square kilometres, and had a population of 107,120 in June 2018.

Cardinia Shire Council Offices are located in Officer. Prior to 17 November 2014, they were located in Pakenham.

==History==
The areas within the present-day boundaries of Cardinia Shire were originally parts of the Cranbourne and Berwick districts, which were incorporated in 1860 and 1862 respectively. The Shire of Fern Tree Gully, later Shire of Sherbrooke, split away in 1889 and included areas to the east of Melbourne. In 1973, the City of Berwick, including Berwick and areas closer to Dandenong, split away from the Shire of Berwick, with the remainder being renamed Shire of Pakenham.

The Shire came into being on 15 December 1994 as the result of statewide local government reform, by merging the Shire of Pakenham with rural sections of the Shire of Sherbrooke and City of Cranbourne.

The Shire of Cardinia contains the only area of Melbourne to use telephone numbers beginning with the exchange prefix 5 - this is a leftover from when it used the area code 059-xx xxxx.

==Council==
Cardinia Shire Council is divided into nine wards: Beacon Hills, Bunyip, Central, Henty, Officer, Pakenham Hills, Ranges, Toomuc and Westernport. Elections are held every four years, each ward has one councillor. Before October 2020 the shire had three wards: Central, Ranges and Port.

The Council Offices were originally located in Henty Way, Pakenham. On 17 November 2014, the Council moved to a new office on Siding Avenue, Officer, which it uses presently. The Council holds its meetings and all of the administration staff work there.

Cardinia Shire is part of the Casey Cardinia Library Corporation and there are two full-time libraries in Cardinia, in Emerald and Pakenham. In addition, the Mobile Library visits the suburbs of Bunyip, Garfield, Tynong, Beaconsfield, Upper Beaconsfield, Gembrook, Maryknoll, Cockatoo, Lang Lang and Koo Wee Rup.

<doc id="492951" wikidata="Q623389" url="?curid=492951" title="Klipspringer">
<text>The klipspringer (; Oreotragus oreotragus) is a small antelope found in eastern and southern Africa. The sole member of its genus and subfamily/tribe, the klipspringer was first described by German zoologist Eberhard August Wilhelm von Zimmermann in 1783. The klipspringer is a small, sturdy antelope; it reaches at the shoulder and weighs from . The coat of the klipspringer, yellowish gray to reddish brown, acts as an efficient camouflage in its rocky habitat. Unlike most other antelopes, the klipspringer has a thick and coarse coat with hollow, brittle hairs. The horns, short and spiky, typically measure .

Typically nocturnal, the klipspringer rests during the middle of the day and late at night. A gregarious animal, the klipspringer is monogamous to a much greater extent than other antelopes; individuals of opposite sexes exhibit long-term to lifelong pair bonding. The mates tend to stay as close as within of each other at most times. Males form territories, , in which they stay with their partners and offspring. Primarily a browser, the klipspringer prefers young plants, fruits and flowers. Gestation lasts around six months, following which a single calf is born; births peak from spring to early summer. The calf leaves its mother when it turns a year old.

The klipspringer inhabits places characterised by rocky terrain and sparse vegetation. Its range extends from northeastern Sudan, Eritrea, Somaliland and Ethiopia in the east to South Africa in the south, and along coastal Angola and Namibia. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) classifies the klipspringer as Least Concern. There are no major threats to the survival of the klipspringer, as its habitat is inaccessible and unfavourable for hunting. Significant numbers occur on private farmlands. As of 2008, nearly 25% of the populations occur in protected areas throughout its range.

==Taxonomy and etymology==

The scientific name of the klipspringer is &quot;Oreotragus oreotragus&quot; , from Greek ὄρος (&quot;óros&quot;), &quot;mountain&quot;, and τράγος (&quot;trágos&quot;), &quot;he-goat&quot;. It is the sole member of the genus Oreotragus and subfamily Oreotraginae or tribe Oreotragini, and is classified under the family Bovidae. The species was first described by German zoologist Eberhard August Wilhelm von Zimmermann in 1783. The vernacular name &quot;klipspringer&quot; is a compound of the Afrikaans words &quot;klip&quot; (&quot;rock&quot;) and &quot;springer&quot; (&quot;leaper&quot;). Another name for this antelope is &quot;klipbok&quot;.

A 2012 phylogenetic study showed that the klipspringer is closely related to Kirk&#x27;s dik-dik (&quot;Madoqua kirkii&quot;) and the suni (&quot;Neotragus moschatus&quot;). The klipspringer evolved nearly 14 million years ago. The cladogram below is based on this study.

As many as 11 subspecies have been identified, though zoologists Colin Groves and Peter Grubb treat a few of them as independent species in a 2011 publication:

*&quot;O. o. aceratos&quot; : Noack&#x27;s or southern Tanzanian klipspringer. Occurs in eastern and southern Africa, between rivers Rufiji and Zambezi.
*&quot;O. o. aureus&quot; : Golden klipspringer. Occurs in Kenya.
*&quot;O. o. centralis&quot; : Zambian klipspringer. Occurs in central and southern Africa.
*&quot;O. o. oreotragus&quot; : Cape klipspringer. Occurs in the Cape of Good Hope, South Africa.
*&quot;O. o. porteousi&quot; : Occurs in central Africa.
*&quot;O. o. saltatrixoides&quot; : Ethiopian klipspringer. Occurs in the highlands of Ethiopia.
*&quot;O. o. schillingsi&quot; : Maasai klipspringer. Occurs in eastern Africa.
*&quot;O. o. somalicus&quot; : Somali klipspringer. Occurs in northern Somalia.
*&quot;O. o. stevensoni&quot; : Stevenson&#x27;s klipspringer. Occurs in western Zimbabwe.
*&quot;O. o. transvaalensis&quot; : Transvaal klipspringer. Occurs in South African highlands and Drakensberg.
*&quot;O. o. tyleri&quot; : Angolan klipspringer. Occurs in Namibia.
==Description==
The klipspringer is a small, sturdy antelope reaching at the shoulder. The head-and-body length is typically between . It weighs from . The klipspringer is sexually dimorphic; females are slightly larger and heavier than the males. The tail measures . Prominent facial features include the brown forehead, short ears marked with black, prominent preorbital glands near the eyes, and white lips and chin. The horns, short and spiky, present only on males, typically measure ; the maximum recorded horn length is .

The coat of the klipspringer, yellowish gray to reddish brown, acts as an efficient camouflage in its rocky habitat; the underbelly is white. Unlike most other antelopes, the klipspringer has a thick and coarse coat with hollow, brittle hairs. The incisors might even get damaged by the hairs while grooming. However, the coat is a significant adaptation that saves the animal during steep falls and provides effective insulation in the extreme climates characteristic of its mountain habitat. A study showed that ticks occur in larger numbers on the underbelly, where the hair is less coarse. The hair often turns erect, especially if the animal is ill or if its temperature increases. Another feature unique to the klipspringer is its gait; it walks on the tips of its cylindrical, blunt hooves. This enhances the grip on the ground, enabling the animal to deftly climb and jump over rocky surfaces.

The subspecies vary in coat colour – from golden yellow in the Cape klipspringer, Ethiopian klipspringer, golden klipspringer and Transvaal klipspringer to ochre or rufous in the Maasai klipspringer, Stevenson&#x27;s klipspringer and Zambian klipspringer. Cape klipspringer populations tend to have the largest males, while Maasai klipspringer exhibit the largest females.

==Ecology and behaviour==
Typically nocturnal (active mainly at night), the klipspringer rests during the midday and at late night; the animal tends to be more active on moonlit nights. It basks in the morning sunlight to warm itself. A gregarious animal, the klipspringer, like the dik-diks and the oribi, exhibits monogamy to a much greater extent than other antelopes; individuals of opposite sexes form pairs that might last until one dies. The mates tend to stay as close as within of each other at most times; for instance, they take turns at keeping a lookout for predators while the other feeds, and face any danger together. The klipspringer will hop a few metres away from the danger. Other social groups include small family herds of eight or more members or solitary individuals. Klipspringer greet one another by rubbing cheeks at social meetings.

Males form territories, large (the size depends on rainfall patterns), in which they stay with their partners and offspring. Males are generally more vigilant than females. Klipspringer form large dung heaps, nearly across and deep, at the borders of territories; another form of marking is the secretion of a thick, black substance, measuring across, from the preorbital glands onto vegetation and rocks in the territories. A study revealed that the tick &quot;Ixodes neitzi&quot; detects and aggregates on twigs marked by the klipspringer. Another study showed that plants near the borders with neighbouring territories are particularly preferred for marking. The main vocalisation is a shrill whistle, given out by the klipspringer pair in a duet, as a means of communication or anti-predator response. Predators include the baboon, black-backed jackal, caracal, crowned eagle, leopard, martial eagle, serval, spotted hyena and Verreaux&#x27;s eagle. Birds such as familiar chats, pale-winged starlings, red-winged starlings and yellow-bellied bulbuls have been observed feeding on ectoparasites of klipspringer.

===Diet===
Primarily a browser, the klipspringer prefers young plants, fruits and flowers. Grasses, eaten mainly in the wet season, form a minor portion of the diet. Some plants, such as &quot;Vellozia&quot;, may be preferred seasonally. Klipspringer depend mainly on succulent plants, and not on water bodies, to meet their water requirement. They can stand on their hindlegs to reach tall branches up to above the ground; some individuals in Namibia were observed climbing &quot;Faidherbia albida&quot; trees up to a height of .

===Reproduction===
The klipspringer is a seasonal breeder; the time when mating occurs varies geographically. Females become sexually mature by the time they are a year old; males take slightly longer to mature. Mating behaviour has not been extensively observed. Gestation lasts around six months, following which a single calf, weighing slightly more than , is born; births peak from spring to early summer. Births take place in dense vegetation. The newborn is carefully hidden for up to three months to protect it from the view of predators; the mother suckles it three to four times a day, the visits gradually lengthen as the offspring grows. Males are protective of their offspring, keeping a watch for other males and predators. The calf is weaned at four to five months, and leaves its mother when it turns a year old. The klipspringer lives for around 15 years.

==Habitat and distribution==

The klipspringer inhabits places characterised by rocky terrain and sparse vegetation. It migrates to lowlands at times of food scarcity. The klipspringer occurs at altitudes as high as on Mount Kilimanjaro. The klipspringer can occur at high population densities in favourable habitats extending over a large area; 10 to 14 individuals occur per square kilometre in the Simien Mountains National Park, Ethiopia. However, the habitat is typically rocky over long stretches and grassy terrain is discontinuous; consequently the population density is typically between 0.01 and 0.1 individual per square kilometre.

The antelope occurs in significant numbers across eastern and southern Africa; its range extends from northeastern Sudan, Eritrea, northern Somalia and Ethiopia in the east to South Africa in the south, and along coastal Angola and Namibia. Smaller populations occur in the northern and western highlands of Central African Republic, southeastern Democratic Republic of Congo, Jos Plateau and east of Gashaka Gumti National Park in Nigeria. It is feared to be extinct in Burundi.

==Threats and conservation==

The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) classifies the klipspringer as Least Concern. The klipspringer is hunted for its meat, leather and hair. However, there are no major threats to the survival of the klipspringer, as its habitat is inaccessible and unfavourable for hunting. Moreover, the antelope does not have to compete with livestock, that do not frequent montane areas. However, populations at lower altitudes are more vulnerable to elimination.

In 1999, Rod East of the IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group estimated the total population of klipspringer at 42,000. Significant numbers occur on private farmlands. As of 2008, nearly 25% of the populations occur in protected areas such as the Simien and Bale Mountains National Parks (Ethiopia); Tsavo East and West National Parks (Kenya); North and South Luangwa National Parks (Zambia); Nyika National Park (Malawi); Namib-Naukluft National Park (Namibia); and Matobo National Park (Zimbabwe).

<text>The City of Melbourne is a local government area in Victoria, Australia, located in the central city area of Melbourne. In 2021, the city has an area of and had a population of 149,615. The city&#x27;s motto is &quot;vires acquirit eundo&quot; which means &quot;we gather strength as we go&quot;.

The current Lord Mayor is Nicholas Reece, who replaced Sally Capp on 2 July 2024. The Melbourne City Council (MCC) holds office in Melbourne Town Hall.

== History ==

=== 19th century ===
Melbourne was founded in 1835, during the reign of King William IV, following the arrival of the schooner &quot;Enterprize&quot; near the present site of the Queen&#x27;s Wharf. Unlike other Australian capital cities, Melbourne did not originate under official auspices, instead owing its origins to non-indigenous settlers from Tasmania.

Having been a province of New South Wales from its establishment in 1835, affairs of the settlement had been administered by the Parliament of New South Wales. With the growth of the settlement there had been an increasing demand by the inhabitants for greater autonomy over their own affairs. On 12 August 1842, Melbourne was incorporated as a town by Act 6 Victoria No. 7 of the Governor and Legislative Council of New South Wales.

The town of Melbourne was raised to the status of a city by Letters Patent of Queen Victoria dated 25 June 1847, five years after its incorporation as a town. The Letters Patent also constituted the Anglican Diocese of Melbourne and declared Melbourne a cathedral city. A motion was tabled at a meeting of the Town Council to alter the style and title of Melbourne from a town to a city, a draft Bill was approved and transmitted to the Government for introduction to the Legislature. On 3 August 1849, Act 13 Victoria No. 14 was finally assented to as &quot;An Act to effect a change in the Style and Title of the Corporation of Melbourne rendered necessary by the erection of the Town of Melbourne to a City&quot;.

The city&#x27;s initial boundaries, as set down in Act 8 Victoria No. 12 (19 December 1844) extended from Point Ormond in Elwood up Barkly Street and Punt Road to the Yarra River, along the river to Merri Creek at Abbotsford, then west along Brunswick Road to Moonee Ponds Creek, then south past Flemington Bridge to Princes Pier in Port Melbourne. The Act imposed on the Mayor a duty to set up &quot;permanent and conspicuous boundary marks of iron, wood, stone or other durable material&quot; along or near the line of the Town&#x27;s boundaries—this was undertaken by Mayor James Frederick Palmer and Town Clerk John Charles King on 4 February 1846.

During the 1850s, Collingwood, Fitzroy and Richmond seceded from Melbourne (all are, since 1994, part of the City of Yarra), as did South Melbourne, whilst other parts became parts of the neighbouring districts of St Kilda and Port Melbourne, and the border between Brunswick and Melbourne moved south one block to Park Street.

=== 20th century ===
On 18 December 1902, King Edward VII conferred the title &quot;Lord Mayor&quot; on the mayor of the City of Melbourne.

On 30 October 1905, Melbourne absorbed two neighbouring council areas. Now included in the City was the Borough of Flemington and Kensington, which had been formed in 1882 when it broke away from the City of Essendon. The second, the Town of North Melbourne, formerly known as Hotham, had been established on 30 September 1859 and been granted town status on 18 December 1874. Both town halls are still in use today as public buildings—the former in Kensington near the present-day Newmarket railway station; the latter in Errol Street, North Melbourne.

The Melbourne and Geelong Corporations Act 1938 allowed for three councillors for each of the eleven wards, with a general election held on 24 August 1939. 

The first woman in 125 years to be elected to the council was local businessperson Clare J. Cascarret in 1967. The election was said to have cost her over half a million pounds.

Following a recommendation by the Local Government Advisory Board in 1978, an Order in Council (27 February 1979, effective from 19 May 1979) reduced the wards from eleven to eight. In December 1980, the Hamer Government dismissed the council, and appointed three Commissioners to determine how the boundaries could best be altered to produce more effective local government, with special regard to Melbourne&#x27;s central business district and its importance to the state, as well as to advise changes needed to the constitution, structure, functions and administration. However, in 1982, with the election of a new Labor government under John Cain, the Act establishing the commission was repealed, and the Melbourne Corporation (Election of Council) Act 1982 established six wards, for which an election was held on 4 December 1982. Three years later, an additional ward was added.

Between 1993 and 1996 the City was again led by Commissioners, along with every local Council in Victoria, while all boundaries were comprehensively reviewed, more than halving the number of Councils. 

In 1993, the City of Melbourne Act specified changes to the boundaries which saw Melbourne gain Southbank and the Victorian Arts Centre on 18 November 1993, and the city was resubdivided into four wards – Flagstaff, University, Hoddle and Domain. The wards were abolished in 2001, with the council having a directly elected Lord Mayor and Deputy Lord Mayor, and seven other councillors. In 2012, the number of Councillors was increased to nine, in addition to the Lord Mayor and Deputy Lord Mayor.

Also in the 1990s, local government control of the docks area on the west side of the city was given to Victorian Government&#x27;s Docklands Authority.

=== 21st century ===
In 2005, the council announced the construction of a new 6-star environmental office building, Council House 2, in Little Collins Street.

On 2 July 2007, the City of Melbourne almost doubled in size when the suburb of Docklands was re-added to its jurisdiction.

On 1 July 2008, a section of Kensington and North Melbourne was transferred to the City of Melbourne from the City of Moonee Valley.

In July 2009, Lord Mayor Robert Doyle unveiled a new corporate identity for the City of Melbourne, costing $239,558.

Building on the council&#x27;s longstanding interest in environmental issues, on 16 July 2019, the council voted to declare a climate and biodiversity emergency in line with similar declarations made elsewhere.

Following the death of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, the City of Melbourne caused controversy and breached protocol, by failing to lower the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags to half mast, whilst the Australian flag was lowered in mourning.

The City of Melbourne is an unsubdivided municipality, consisting of a directly elected Lord Mayor and Deputy Lord Mayor, and nine Councillors. Since 2008, all Victorian councillors serve a four-year term. The most recent general election was held on Saturday 24 October 2020. The next general election will be held in October 2024.

During a general election, the City of Melbourne holds two simultaneous elections – one to elect the Lord Mayor and Deputy Lord Mayor (leadership team) and the other to elect the nine councillors. All residents are entitled to vote in the election, as well as up to two of each of the following: non-residential owners and occupiers of rateable property. If a corporation solely owns or occupies rateable property in the municipality, then the corporation must appoint two company officers (director and/or company secretary, or equivalent) to represent it and vote on its behalf.

Melton was first incorporated as a district on 16 September 1862, and became a shire on 24 May 1871. Parts of the north and south ridings of the Shire of Braybrook (later City of Sunshine) were annexed to Melton as the Rockbank Riding on 24 May 1916, and this was added to in 1951. Other minor boundary adjustments with Bulla and Keilor occurred in May 1959. The Shire had a total area of .

In 1994, following large-scale statewide local government reform, Melton acquired the Exford district from the City of Werribee, growing to its present size.

After several years of community consultation to defer applying for city status until it had reached 150,000, the council nevertheless reversed the decision and city status was granted in September, 2012. The first elected Mayor under the &#x27;City&quot; status was Kathy Majdlik.

In the 2020 Local Government elections, Melton had its first Aboriginal Councillor elected, Cr Ashleigh Vandenberg. A proud Wiradjuri woman making history and becoming the first Aboriginal Councillor in Melbourne&#x27;s Western Suburbs.

<text>The cultural turn is a movement beginning in the early 1970s among scholars in the humanities and social sciences to make culture the focus of contemporary debates; it also describes a shift in emphasis toward &quot;meaning&quot; and away from a positivist epistemology. The cultural turn is described in 2005 by Lynette Spillman and Mark D. Jacobs as &quot;one of the most influential trends in the humanities and social sciences in the last generation.&quot; A prominent historiographer argues that the cultural turn involved a &quot;wide array of new theoretical impulses coming from fields formerly peripheral to the social sciences,&quot; especially post-structuralism, cultural studies, literary criticism, and various forms of linguistic analysis, which emphasized &quot;the causal and socially constitutive role of cultural processes and systems of signification.&quot;

==Background==
The cultural turn in the late 20th century is interpreted as referring to either a substantive shift in society or an analytical shift in academia. The former argues that culture plays a more significant role in advanced societies, which fits with the notion of post-modernity as a historical era in which people &quot;emphasizes the importance of art and culture for education, moral growth, and social criticism and change&quot;. The latter is movement within academia to place the concept of culture, and the related notions of &quot;meaning&quot;, &quot;cognition&quot;, &quot;affect&quot;, and &quot;symbols&quot; at the center of methodological and theoretical focus. Some argue that the analytical shift is endogenous to the substantive shift.

Culture can be defined as &quot;the social process whereby people communicate meanings, make sense of their world, construct their identities, and define their beliefs and values&quot;. Or, for Georg Simmel, culture refers to &quot;the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history&quot;. Thus culture can be interpreted on a spectrum from purely individualistic solipsism to objective forms of social organization and interaction.

==History==

===Analytical shift===
One of the earliest works in which the term &quot;cultural turn&quot; showed up was Jeffrey C. Alexander&#x27;s chapter &quot;The New Theoretical Movement&quot; in Neil Smelser&#x27;s &quot;Handbook of Sociology&quot; (1988). According to Alexander, the origins of the cultural turn should be traced to the nineteenth-century debate between idealism and materialism, i.e. Hegel and Marx, respectively. Prior to the labeling of the movement, in the 1970s, &quot;foundational works underlying and facilitating the turn to cultural forms of analysis&quot; emerged: Hayden White&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1973), Clifford Geertz&#x27;s &quot;The Interpretation of Cultures: Selected Essays&quot; (1973), Michel Foucault&#x27;s &quot;Discipline and Punish&quot; (1977), and Pierre Bourdieu&#x27;s &quot;Outline of a Theory of Practice&quot; (1977).

While the earlier twentieth century experienced a linguistic turn, mostly brought about by the thought of Ludwig Wittgenstein and Ferdinand de Saussure, the cultural turn of the late twentieth century absorbed those criticisms and built on them.

The cultural turn has helped cultural studies to gain more respect as an academic discipline. With the shift away from high arts the discipline has increased its perceived importance and influence on other disciplines.

British historian Heather Jones argues that the historiography of the First World War has been reinvigorated by the cultural turn in recent years. Scholars have raised entirely new questions regarding military occupation, radicalisation of politics, race, and the male body.

===Substantive shift===
The cultural turn as an historical era that breaks substantively with the past is only tangentially related to cultural turn as analytical shift. Proponents of the former argue that:

Advertising, amateur photography, yellow journalism and an assortment of other forms of media arose after the politically charged 1960s. Moreover, this media was multicultural, and attempted to target all races, ethnicities and age groups, as opposed to more exclusive media prior to the 1960s. This &quot;new media&quot; of a postmodern America brought about an expansion and differentiation of culture, which has only been rapidly expanded by the Internet and social media.

==In rural studies==
In recent years, there has been something of a resurgence in rural studies, which has become somewhat more mainstream than previously in the academic space of social science. Increasing numbers of people have taken on important dualistic questions of society/space, nature/culture structure/agency and self/other from the perspective of rural studies. However, it is the &#x27;cultural turn&#x27; in wider social science which has lent both respectability and excitement to the nexus with rurality, particularly with new foci on landscape, otherness and the spatiality of nature. With a conceptual fascination with difference, and a methodological fascination with ethnography, cultural studies have provided a significant palimpsestuous overlay onto existing landscapes of knowledge.

<text>A bucket hat (variations of which include the fisherman&#x27;s hat, Irish country hat and session hat) is a hat with a narrow, downward-sloping brim. Typically, the hat is made from heavy-duty cotton fabric such as denim or canvas, or heavy wool such as tweed, sometimes with metal eyelets placed on the crown of the hat for ventilation.

It was first adopted as a high fashion item in the 1960s, and with subsequent revivals in both street fashion and on the catwalk. It is popular festival gear in the present day, also known as a &quot;session hat&quot;.

==Origins==
The bucket hat is said to have been introduced around 1900. Originally made from wool felt or tweed cloth, these hats were traditionally worn by Irish farmers and fishermen as protection from the rain, because the lanolin from the unwashed (raw) wool made these hats naturally waterproof. From the interwar years onwards, these &quot;Irish walking hats&quot; were quickly adopted internationally for country pursuits because, when folded, they could fit inside a coat pocket. If the hat fell in the mud, it could be easily cleaned with a damp sponge, and it could be reshaped using steam from a kettle. In the 1960s, it was often worn by members of the Mod subculture.

The modern bucket hat is derived from a tropical hat made from olive drab cotton that was issued to the US Army during the Vietnam War. These lightweight hats became popular among civilians for use in sports such as fishing, and as sun protection.

===Fashion accessory===
In the 1960s, the bucket hat was adapted as a ladies&#x27; fashion item, in common with the pillbox, bakerboy, and cloche styles, suiting the fashion for more bouffant hair. Milliners such as Lilly Daché created designs in felt or other stiffer fabrics to capture the &quot;mod&quot; look. The older tweed Irish walking hat remained popular among professional men until the 1970s, and was notably worn by Sean Connery&#x27;s character in &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;.

The hat became popular with rappers in the 1980s and remained part of street fashion into the 1990s. In the 2010&#x27;s, it has re-emerged as a fashion catwalk item after being sported by celebrities such as Rihanna. Since then, luxury bucket hats have been produced by brands such as Gucci, Loewe, and Prada. The bucket-hat has also been associated with the hip-hop scene. The trend was set-off by LL Cool J and Run-DMC, and since then many musical sensations have used it.

<text>This is a list of notable events in the history of LGBT rights that took place in the year 1987.

==Events==
*Radical AIDS activist group, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP), organizes in New York City.
*Cathedral City, California, prohibits employment discrimination based on sexual orientation in the private sector.

===May===
* 29 — Barney Frank, United States Congressman for Massachusetts&#x27;s 4th congressional district since 1981, comes out as gay in an interview with &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;.

===June===
* 25 — In &quot;San Francisco Arts &amp; Athletics, Inc. v. United States Olympic Committee&quot; the United States Supreme Court rules that the Gay Games may not use the word &quot;Olympic&quot; in its name because of the trademark held by the USOC.

===September===
* 5 — The Homomonument, a memorial to LGBT victims of the Nazis, is dedicated at Amsterdam, Netherlands.

===October===
* Governor Neil Goldschmidt(D) of Oregon issues an executive order banning sexual orientation discrimination in state employment.
* 1 — The Minnesota Supreme Court refuses to rule on the constitutionality of the state&#x27;s anti-sodomy law, allowing the law to remain on the books.
* 11 — The Second National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights takes place with an estimated 200,000 participants. The march, demonstration, and rally also included the first public display of Cleve Jones&#x27;s NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt and the first community wedding. The 200,000 person estimate, widely quoted from the &quot;New York Times&quot;, was made several hours before the march actually began; similarly, most of the pictures used by mainstream media were taken early in the morning, or of the AIDS Quilt viewing area rather than the march itself. Police on the scene estimated numbers during the actual march to be closer to half a million. This event and date would also be the starting point for what would become National Coming Out Day.

=== November ===
* 3 — Boulder, Colorado, citizens pass the first referendum to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation.

=== December ===
* 8 — David Wilshire, British Member of Parliament, introduces Section 28 as an amendment to the Local Government Bill.
