<text>Charles Michels () is a station on Line 10 of the Paris Métro. It is located in the 15th arrondissement.

==History==
The station opened as &quot;Beaugrenelle&quot; on 13 July 1913 as part of the initial section of line 8 as its temporary southern terminus, and with Opéra as its northern terminus. The line was then extended to Porte d&#x27;Auteuil on 30 September that same year, becoming its new southern terminus. It was then named after Place Beaugrenelle (now known as Place Charles Michels). Beaugrenelle (&quot;beautiful Grenelle&quot;) was a name given by property developers in the Grenelle district during its urbanisation. 

On 27 July 1937, the section of line 8 between La Motte-Picquet–Grenelle and Porte d&#x27;Auteuil, including &quot;Beaugrenelle&quot;, was transferred to line 10 during the reconfiguration of lines 8, 10, and the old line 14. On 29 July 1937, line 10 was extended from Duroc to La Motte-Picquet–Grenelle. 

On 14 July 1945, both the station as well as the nearby Place Beaugrenelle were renamed &quot;Charles Michels&quot; and Place Charles Michels respectively, in honour of Charles Michels (1903–1941), a trade unionist, communist militant, and deputy of the 15th arrondissement in Paris. He was held hostage and shot during the Occupation by the Nazis in retaliation for the assassination of Karl Hotz, amongst 44 other people. Hence, the station, along with 7 other stations, were renamed after the Second World War to honour the resistance fighters who had died for France. The other stations were: Colonel Fabien, Corentin Cariou, Corentin Celton, Guy Môquet, Jacques Bonsergent, Marx Dormoy, and Trinité - d&#x27;Estienne d&#x27;Orves.

As part of the &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; programme by the RATP, the station&#x27;s platforms were renovated and modernised in 2009.

In 2019, the station was used by 4,601,730 passengers, making it the 93rd busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 2,198,392 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 194th busiest of the Métro network out of 108 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 3,079,569 passengers, making it the 102nd busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.

<text>Avenue Émile Zola () is a station on line 10 of the Paris Métro. Located in the 15th arrondissement, it is situated at the eastern end of avenue Émile Zola, at the intersection of the rue du Commerce and rue Fondary. The station is named after the nearby avenue Émile Zola, which in turn is named after Émile Zola (1840-1902), a prolific French writer during the 19th century.

==History==
The station opened on 13 July 1913 with the name &quot;Commerce&quot; as part of the initial section of line 8 from &quot;Beaugrenelle&quot; (now Charles Michels) and Opéra. It was initially named after the nearby rue du Commerce which was the main shopping street of the former commune of Grenelle which was merged into the city of Paris in 1859. 

On 27 July 1937, the section of line 8 between La Motte-Picquet–Grenelle and Porte d&#x27;Auteuil, including &quot;Avenue Émile Zola&quot;, was transferred to line 10 during the reconfiguration of lines 8, 10, and the old line 14. On the same day, the station was renamed &quot;Avenue Émile Zola&quot; to distinguish it from a new station also named Commerce that had opened on line 8, 300 metres south of the station. It is the last of three stations on the network that had its name changed as its original name hd been used for a newer station, after Saint-Placide (line 4) and Picpus (line 6). Initially, service between Porte d&#x27;Auteuil and Jussieu was not provided, with it being limited to La Motte-Picquet–Grenelle until the underground connection for line 10 was opened two days later, linking &quot;La Motte-Picquet–Grenelle&quot; and Duroc.

As part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; programme by the RATP, the station&#x27;s corridors and platform lighting were renovated and modernised on 13 November 2003.

In 2019, the station was used by 1,479,759 passengers, making it the 280th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 823,178 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 263rd busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 1,041,233 passengers, making it the 280th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

<text>Duroc () is a station on lines 10 and 13 of the Paris Métro. It is located at the point for which the 6th, 7th and 15th arrondissements share a common border, close to the location of an old toll gate on the road to Sèvres, part of the Wall of the &quot;Ferme générale&quot;, which was built around Paris between 1784 and 1791 by the &quot;ferme générale&quot; company of tax farmers. The station is named after the nearby &quot;rue Duroc&quot;, which in turn is named after Géraud Duroc, Duke of Frioul (1772–1813), who was one of Napoleon&#x27;s generals, noted for his friendship with Napoleon Bonaparte, he is sometimes referred to as ‘Napoleon&#x27;s shadow’ (l&#x27;ombre de Napoléon in French).

==History==

Line 10&#x27;s station was opened by the Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain de Paris (CMP) on 30 December 1923 as part of the first section of the &quot;Ligne circulaire intérieure&quot; (inner circular line) from Invalides (now on line 13) to Croix-Rouge (a station east of Sèvres – Babylone, which was closed during World War II). The line was planned by Fulgence Bienvenüe to connect the city&#x27;s six main railway stations, with &quot;Duroc&quot; presumably intended to serve the Gare Montparnasse, although it being located 500 metres away.

The project was eventually abandoned and on 27 July 1937, the section from &quot;Duroc&quot; to &quot;Invalides&quot; was transferred to become the first section of the old line 14. The section between &quot;Duroc&quot; and &quot;Croix-Rouge&quot;, by that time extended east to Jussieu remained as line 10. It extended west from &quot;Duroc&quot; to La Motte-Picquet–Grenelle on the same day.

On 9 November 1976, the old line 14 was incorporated into line 13 following the latter&#x27;s extension in successive phases from Saint-Lazare.

Since 2004, the station has been temporarily renamed &quot;Durock&quot; on the occasion of the Rock en Seine festival almost every year for a week in June. Several rock-related posters are also placed on the walls of the platforms.

As part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; programme by the RATP, the station&#x27;s corridors were renovated and modernised on 21 October 2006.

In 2012, platform screen doors were installed on line 13&#x27;s platforms, together with eleven other stations on the line in an attempt to increase the average speed of trains and reduce track-related incidents due to the line&#x27;s heavy traffic.

On 6 December 2017, in a tribute to Johnny Hallyday (1963-2017), a French musician and actor who had died the night before, the station was temporarily renamed &quot;Durock Johnny&quot; for a day, with excerpts from his greatest hits played on the platforms.

In 2019, the station was used by 3,596,220 passengers, making it the 134th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 1,972,711 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 124th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 2,645,064 passengers, making it the 130th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

<text>The Gorda plate, located beneath the Pacific Ocean off the coast of northern California, is one of the northern remnants of the Farallon plate. It is sometimes referred to (by, for example, publications from the USGS Earthquake Hazards Program) as simply the southernmost portion of the neighboring Juan de Fuca plate, another Farallon remnant.

Unlike most tectonic plates, the Gorda plate experiences significant intraplate deformation inside its boundaries. Numerous faults have been mapped in both the sediments and basement of the Gorda Basin, which is in the interior of the plate south of 41.6°N. Stresses from the neighboring North American plate and Pacific plate cause frequent earthquakes in the interior of the plate, including the 1980 Eureka earthquake (also known as the Gorda Basin event).

The easterly side is the Cascadia subduction zone where the plate subducts under the North American plate in northern California. The southerly side is a transform boundary with the Pacific plate along the Mendocino Fault. The westerly side is a divergent boundary with the Pacific plate forming the Gorda Ridge. This ridge provides morphological evidence of differing spreading rates, with the northern portion of the ridge being narrow, and the southern portion being wide. The northerly side is a transform boundary with the Juan de Fuca plate, the Blanco fracture zone.

The subducting Gorda plate is connected with the volcanoes in northern California, namely, Mount Shasta and Lassen Peak. Lassen Peak last erupted in 1914–1917.

<text>Vaneau () is a station on line 10 of the Paris Metro, located on the border of the 6th and 7th arrondissements. It is named after the nearby rue Vaneau, which was in turn named after Louis Vaneau (1811-1830), a student who was killed during the July Revolution in 1830.

==History==
The station was opened by the Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain de Paris (CMP) on 30 December 1923 as part of the first section of the &quot;Ligne circulaire intérieure&quot; (inner circular line) from Invalides (now on line 13) to Croix-Rouge (a station east of Sèvres – Babylone, which was closed during World War II) via Duroc. The project was eventually abandoned and on 27 July 1937, the section from Duroc to Invalides was transferred to become the first section of the old line 14, which was connected under the Seine and incorporated into line 13 on 9 November 1976. 

In 2019, the station was used by 1,028,480 passengers, making it the 291st busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 524,526 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 287th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 725,826 passengers, making it the 291st busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

== Passenger services ==

=== Access ===
The station has a single access along rue de Sèvres.

=== Station layout ===
=== Platforms ===
The station has a standard configuration with 2 tracks surrounded by 2 side platforms. The lower portion of the side walls are vertical instead of elliptical unlike other stations on the line, similar to the stations on the lines constructed by the Nord-Sud company (today lines 12 and 13)

=== Other connections ===
The station is also served by lines 70 and 86 of the RATP bus network.

<doc id="504645" wikidata="Q1578089" url="?curid=504645" title="Sèvres–Babylone station">
<text>Sèvres–Babylone () is a station on Lines 10 and 12 of the Paris Métro. It is located at the intersection of Boulevard Raspail and rue de Sèvres, on the border of the 6th and 7th arrondissements. Rue de Sèvres boasts two flagship Paris fashion stores: Le Bon Marché at number 22 and Hermès at number 17.

==History==
On 5 November 1910, line 10&#x27;s station opened by the Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain de Paris (CMP) as part of the first section of the &quot;Ligne circulaire intérieure&quot; (inner circular line) from Invalides (now on line 13) to Croix-Rouge (a ghost station east of &quot;Sèvres–Babylone&quot;, closed since World War II). 

Line 12&#x27;s station opened on 30 November 1923 as part of the original section of the Nord-Sud Company&#x27;s line A between Porte de Versailles and Notre-Dame-de-Lorette. It was then named &quot;Sèvres–Croix-Rouge&quot;, after the nearby rue de Sèvres, a road in which in medieval times ran from Paris to Sèvres, as well as the nearby &quot;carrefour de la Croix-Rouge&quot; (today known as place Michel-Debré).

Initially, line 10&#x27;s station was supposed to be named &quot;Babylone&quot; (after the nearby rue de Babylone, named in 1673 after the Catholic Bishop of Babylon) while line A&#x27;s station was still named &quot;Sèvres–Croix-Rouge&quot;. However, shortly before the opening of line 10, the city forced the two companies to consolidate it into a single station with it adopting a common name, &quot;Sèvres–Babylone&quot;, as it is still known as today. These circumstances resulted in the peculiar signages at the station; the signages of line 10 read &quot;-Babylone&quot; (emphasising &quot;Babylone&quot;) whereas that of line A read &quot;Sèvres-&quot; (emphasising &quot;Sèvres&quot;).

On 27 March 1931, line A became line 12 when It was taken over by the Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain de Paris (CMP), incorporating it into the Paris Métro.

As part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; programme by the RATP, the station&#x27;s corridors were renovated and modernised on 21 October 2005.

Until 2008, line 10&#x27;s platforms featured an exhibition on ecology, with showcases on waste recycling, renewable energy, and the consumption of water and electricity around the world. It was then replaced with panels that related specifically to the commitments of the Grenelle de l&#x27;environnement, with key points of public policy on environmentalism and sustainable development. It was however, removed at the end of 2015, with the green and yellow tiles above the display cases replaced with white tiles, putting an end to the original decoration of the platforms.

In 2019, the station was used by 5,037,509 passengers, making it the 80th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 2,441,636 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 90th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 3,392,504 passengers, making it the 88th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

== Passenger services ==

=== Access ===
The station has three accesses:

* Access 1: rue de Sèvres
* Access 2: rue Velpeau &quot;Le Bon Marché&quot;
* Access 3: Boulevard Raspail (with an ascending escalator)

=== Station layout ===
=== Platforms ===
Both lines have a standard configuration with 2 tracks surrounded by 2 side platforms although the lower portion of the side walls on line 12&#x27;s platforms are vertical instead of elliptical, as with the other stations constructed by the Nord-Sud company (today on lines 12 and 13).

=== Other connections ===
The station is also served by lines 63, 68, 70, 83, 84, 86, and 94 of the RATP bus network.

<doc id="504646" wikidata="Q8762" url="?curid=504646" title="Radebeul">
<text>Radebeul () is a town (&quot;große Kreisstadt&quot;) in the Elbe valley in the district of Meißen in Saxony, Germany, a suburb of Dresden. It is well known for its viticulture, a museum dedicated to writer Karl May, and a narrow-gauge railway connecting Radebeul with the castle of Moritzburg and the town of Radeburg. The Meißen area, where Radebeul is located, is one of the northeasternmost areas where wine is grown in the 21st century.

It is sometimes called the &quot;Nice of Saxony&quot; for its pleasant landscape and mild climate.

== History ==
A village Radebeul was first mentioned in 1349. In 1905 it absorbed the neighboring village of Serkowitz. On April 1, 1924 Radebeul became a town.

Meanwhile, the neighboring village of Kötzschenbroda had taken over Lindenau in 1920, and Naundorf, Zitzschewig und Niederlößnitz by 1924, when it was made a town as well.

In 1934 Wahnsdorf and Oberlößnitz joined Radebeul, and on January 1, 1935 the towns of Kötzschenbroda and Radebeul were united under the name of Radebeul (As &quot;Kötzschenbroda&quot; had a Slavic root, this name was considered too &quot;ungermanic&quot; at the time). In 1947 Radebeul was made part of the district of Dresden.

In 1995 Radebeul was named a major town inside the rural district (&quot;große Kreisstadt&quot;). When the rural district of Dresden (Dresden-Land) was dissolved, Radebeul became part of the district of Meißen.

==Transport==
The town can be reached by Dresdner Verkehrsbetriebe tram route 4 or by Dresden S-Bahn line S1, which serves four stations in Radebeul (Radebeul Ost, Radebeul-Weintraube, Radebeul Kötzschenbroda and Radebeul-Zitzschewig) on the Pirna–Coswig railway. Deutsche Bahn&#x27;s Regional-Express 50 service also stops at Radebeul Ost. It is also the terminus of the historic Radebeul–Radeburg narrow-gauge steam railway and the station closest to the Karl May Museum.

==Public services==
The volunteer fire department of Radebeul was founded in 1897. While volunteer, it is considered the oldest department of the city government. Today the volunteer fire department of Radebeul consists of four separate quarter departments: Radebeul-Ost, Kötzschenbroda (Naundorf), Lindenau and Wahnsdord. Each of the departments has his own junior firefighter section. The quarter department of Radebeul-Kötzschenbroda was founded 2008 in the course of the construction of a rescue central station in Radebeul West. In the process the volunteer fire departments of Radebeul-West and Naundorf were consolidated. The rescue central station also houses the &quot;Technisches Hilfswerk Radebeul&quot;.

In 2011 the departments counted 136 members in total, 99 on active duty and 37 members in the elderly and honor department. The junior firefighter section had overall a number of 64 young members.

In 2012 the department raised money to create a flag of honor. The assets cost (including gear) totaled a sum of around 12000 Euro, which were gathered through donations (citizen and companies alike). Every donator was allowed to sign one of the flag nails with his name. Fundraising took place from March to the end of July 2012, and the flag was made in September.
The flag consecration took place at the 08.11.2012. The departments of Meißen, Moritzburg and Coswig were invited to this ceremony. The flag consecration sponsorship was picked up by the county fire fighter organization of Meißen. The president of the parliament of Saxony, Dr. Rößler, was patron. The flag is stored at the city hall in Radebeul.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Radebeul is twinned with:
* Cananea, Mexico
* Obukhiv, Ukraine
* Sankt Ingbert, Germany
* Sierra Vista, United States

==Notable people==
*Karl May (1842–1912), author, lived and died in Radebeul

<text>Mabillon () is a station on line 10 of the Paris Metro, located at the heart of the Rive Gauche and the 6th arrondissement. It was named after the nearby street, rue Mabillon, which in turn was named after Jean Mabillon (1632–1707), a Benedictine monk and scholar, considered the founder of palaeography and diplomatics, who died nearby.

Although the station is in close proximity to Saint-Germain-des-Prés on line 4 (less than 100 metres away), there is no free transfer between the two stations.

== History ==
The station opened on 10 March 1925 as part of the line&#x27;s extension from Croix-Rouge (a ghost station between Sèvres – Babylone and &quot;Mabillon&quot;, closed since World War II). It was the eastern terminus of the line until its extension to Odéon on 14 April 1926. 

As part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; programme by the RATP, the station&#x27;s corridors and platform lighting were renovated and modernised on 21 July 2006.

Since 14 October 2021, it is no longer possible to purchase carnets, a book of 10 paper tickets, at the station. This was part of the first phase of the RATP&#x27;s plan to phase out physical tickets in favour of contactless payment such as the Navigo cards.

In 2019, the station was used by 1,859,872 passengers, making it the 256th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 839,743 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 262nd busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 1,195,051 passengers, making it the 262nd busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

<doc id="504649" wikidata="Q1789145" url="?curid=504649" title="Maubert–Mutualité station">
<text>Maubert–Mutualité () is a station on Line 10 of the Paris Métro. Located in the 5th arrondissement, it is situated at the heart of the Latin Quarter on the Rive Gauche.

==History==
The station is covered in white tiles like most other stations of the Métro, and uses a barrel vault that runs lengthwise over the tracks and platform. However, it is unique in that near the center of the platform two parallel tubes of moving orange lights trace the curve of the vaulted ceiling over the tracks from one side to the other.

The station was opened on 15 February 1930 with the extension of Line 10 from Odéon to Place d&#x27;Italie (now on Line 7). It is named after Place Maubert (Maubert Square) and the nearby Maison de la Mutualité.

As part of the RATP&#x27;s &quot;Metro Renewal&quot; programme, its corridors and platform lighting were renovated and inaugurated on 21 October 2003, while a small, specific lighting installation had been inaugurated on the platforms.

In 2021, ridership is gradually recovering, with 1,280,387 passengers entering this station, which places it in 253rd position among metro stations for ridership out of 304.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has three entrances divided into four metro entrances, each adorned with a Dervaux-type balustrade: 
* Access 1 - &quot;Rue Lagrange&quot;, consisting of two fixed staircases, each adorned with a Dervaux candelabra, leading on either side of Boulevard Saint-Germain to the west of Place Maubert, one to the right of no. 49, the other facing no. 62;
* Access 2 - &quot;Place Maubert - Palais de la Mutualité&quot;, also consisting of a fixed staircase with a Dervaux mast, located to the west of the square along the odd-numbered pavement of Boulevard Saint-Germain;
* Access 3 - &quot;Rue des Carmes&quot;, consisting of an escalator going up allowing only the exit from the platform in the direction of Gare d&#x27;Austerlitz, located on the same square to the right of no. 47 ter of Boulevard Saint-Germain.
===Station layout===

===Platforms===
Maubert - Mutualité is a station with a standard configuration. It has two platforms separated by the metro tracks and the vault is elliptical. The decoration is in the style used for most metro stations. The lighting canopies are white and rounded in the &quot;Gaudin&quot; style of the metro revival of the 2000s, and the bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the walls, the vault and the tunnel exits. The advertising frames are made of honey-coloured earthenware and the name of the station is also made of earthenware in the style of the original CMP. The seats are in the orange &quot;Akiko&quot; style.

The station is distinguished, by the presence of two parallel tubes of flashing orange-yellow lights in its centre, which follow the curvature of the vault along the corridor passing over the tracks. The scenography was entrusted to Bernard Baissait and his graphic design agency.
===Bus connections===
The station is served by lines 47, 63, 86 and 87 of the RATP Bus Network.

== History ==
The station opened as part of the extension of the line from on 17 February 1937. As part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; programme by the RATP, the station&#x27;s platform lighting was modernised during the course of the 2000s while the corridors were renovated 28 June 2018.

As part of modernization works for the extension of the line to in 2023 for the Grand Paris Express, the station was closed from 26 June 2021 to 29 August 2021 to raise its platform levels, its surface tiled, and to widen and lengthen the tunnels at the end of the station. This is to accommodate the new rolling stock that will be used (MP 14) to accommodate the expected increase in passengers and to make it accessible to people with reduced mobility. Two new entrances will also be added with the one at Place du Colonel-Fabien having 2 lifts.

In 2019, the station was used by 4,436,148 passengers, making it the 101st busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

It is named after the nearby rue de Télégraphe, which was once a &quot;chemin de ronde&quot; (a raised protected walkway behind a battlement) of the park of the &quot;Château de Ménilmontant&quot;. Its name comes from the optical telegraph invented by Claude Chappe (1763–1805) in 1792. This was the first practical telecommunications system, but was eventually replaced by the electric telegraph. Chappe installed the relay station, containing the telegraph&#x27;s apparatus which he called a &quot;tachygraphe&quot;, on this peak of 128 meters altitude.

== History ==
The station opened as part of the original section of the line from Châtelet to Porte des Lilas on 28 April 1935.

On 1 April 2016, half of the nameplates on the station&#x27;s platforms were temporarily replaced by the RATP as part of April Fool&#x27;s Day, along with 12 other stations. It was humorously renamed &quot;#TWEET&quot;, a reference to the evolution of text messaging in the 21st century and as a tribute to Twitter.

As part of modernization works for the extension of the Line to in 2023 for the Grand Paris Express, the station was closed from 8 June 2019 to 15 July 2019 to raise its platform levels and its surface tiled to accommodate the new rolling stock that will be used (MP 14) to accommodate the expected increase passengers and to improve the station&#x27;s accessibility. An additional entrance will also added at the corner of rue de Belleville and rue du Docteur Potain and will be equipped with a lift.

In 2019, the station was used by 1,823,734 passengers, making it the 257th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 1,194,040 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 220th busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.

The station has a standard configuration with 2 tracks surrounded by 2 side platforms. The station&#x27;s tracks are separated by a supporting wall to strengthen the station box as it is built in soft ground. Due to the significant depth of the platforms, certain landings between flights of stairs that led to the mezzanine level were equipped with seats for travellers to rest. This was removed during the station&#x27;s renovation and modernisation as part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; programme by the RATP on 28 June 2016. This feature still exists at Buttes Chaumont.

<text>Porte de la Chapelle () is a station on line 12 of the Paris Métro in the districts of La Chapelle and Goutte d&#x27;Or and the 18th arrondissement.

The station opened on 23 August 1916 as part of the extension of the Nord-Sud company&#x27;s line A from Jules Joffrin. On 27 March 1931 line A became line 12 of the &quot;Métro&quot;. Porte de la Chapelle was the terminus of line 12 until 18 December 2012, when an extension opened to Front Populaire.

The station is named after the &quot;Porte de la Chapelle&quot;, a gate in the nineteenth century Thiers wall of Paris, on the &quot;Rue de la Chapelle&quot;, the old Roman road to Calais via Saint-Denis, now Route nationale 1. It was named after a village that was annexed by Paris in 1860 and was named after a chapel to Saint Genevieve built in the 6th century.

The station is featured in &quot;Crossroads&quot;, an episode of the American HBO series &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;.

Work is under way to extend the line into the commune of Aubervilliers, initially to , which opened in 2012. It is proposed to extend it further north through several stations to RER B station or &quot;La Courneuve 6 Routes&quot; Tramway line 1 station.

A street-level interchange with Paris tramway Line 3b opened on 15 December 2012.

<text>Abbesses (, literally &quot;Abbesses&quot;) is a station on Paris Métro Line 12, in the Montmartre district and the 18th arrondissement. Abbesses is the deepest station in the Paris Métro, at 36 metres (118 feet) below ground, and is located on the western side of the &quot;butte&quot; (hill) of Montmartre. Access to the platforms is by elevator or the decorated stairs.

==Location==

Nearby are the &quot;Montmartre&quot; district, the Basilique du Sacré-Cœur de Montmartre (church), the Place du Tertre and the Église Saint-Jean-de-Montmartre (Art Nouveau church). The station is named after the &quot;Place des Abbesses&quot;, referring to the abbesses of the nearby abbey of the &quot;Dames-de-Montmartre&quot;.

==History==
The station opened on 30 January 1913, three months after the extension of the Nord-Sud company&#x27;s line A from Pigalle to Jules Joffrin. On 27 March 1931, line A became line 12 of the &quot;Métro&quot;.

== Station layout ==


==Architecture==

The station&#x27;s entrance, designed by Hector Guimard (1867–1942), is one of only two remaining glass-covered &quot;dragonfly&quot; entrances, known as &quot;&quot; (the other is located at Porte Dauphine, while a replica exists at Châtelet). Though a Guimard original, the &quot;édicule&quot; at Abbesses was originally located at and was transferred to its current location in 1974. The entrance is technically anachronistic, since line 12 of the Paris metro was built by a competing firm, the Nord-Sud Company, which did not hire Guimard but engaged other architects to design its stations and station entrances.

==Abbesses in popular culture==
* Abbesses is featured in &quot;Le Fabuleux destin d&#x27;Amélie Poulain&quot;; a working title for the film was &quot;Amélie des Abbesses&quot; (&quot;Amélie of the Abbesses&quot;). Though set at Abbesses station, the film was actually shot at Porte des Lilas station, which has a disused platform that has been specially set up for filming.
* The entrance to Abbesses metro station is featured near the beginning of music video for Howard Jones&#x27; &quot;What Is Love&quot; as well as several other locations around Paris
* Louis Vuitton has a messenger style bag in the Monogram Canvas line named after the station.
* A cartoon version of the station appears in the official music video for &quot;Flowers&quot;, the ninth track on &quot;Émilie Simon&quot;.
* &quot;Abbesses&quot; is also where Minette&#x27;s fashion studio is located in a Nancy Drew PC game &quot;Danger By Design&quot;.
* The French DJ crew Birdy Nam Nam has composed a musical piece called Abbesses.
* Featured in multiple scenes of the final episode of Netflix original series &quot;Sense8&quot;.

<text>Saint-Georges () is a station on Line 12 of the Paris Métro in the 9th arrondissement.

The station opened on 8 April 1911 as part of the extension of the Nord-Sud company&#x27;s line A from Notre-Dame-de-Lorette to Pigalle. On 27 March 1931 line A became line 12 of the &quot;Métro&quot;. The station is named after the &quot;Rue Saint-Georges&quot;, which became a street in 1734 and leads to the &quot;Place Saint-Georges&quot;, created in 1824. It was the centre of an estate created by the speculator Dosne, father-in-law of the politician Adolphe Thiers.

It was renovated during the early 2000s in imitation of the style adopted by the &quot;Nord-Sud Company&quot;, the original architects of the station. In fact, the current decorative style only vaguely resembles the original: the station name is no longer shown on large ceramic tablets (as at Solférino and Abbesses) and does not follow the original colour-coding: the edge of the ceramic name tablets should be brown to designate a non-interchange station, rather than green.

<doc id="504672" wikidata="Q2212863" url="?curid=504672" title="Brixton railway station">
<text>Brixton railway station is a commuter railway station in Brixton, South London, UK. It is on the Chatham Main Line, down the line from . Trains are operated by Southeastern. The typical service is one train every 15 minutes in both directions, from Victoria to Orpington via Bromley South.

It is about north of Brixton Underground station, high above ground level on a railway bridge that can be seen from the tube station. Access is from Atlantic Road via staircases. It is also a busy junction, with the Catford Loop via and leaving the Chatham Main Line immediately west of the station, though there are currently only platforms on the Chatham Main Line. The South London line crosses above the east end of the platforms, without stopping nearby.

==History==

Brixton was opened as Brixton and South Stockwell on 25 August 1862 by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR) to serve the affluent Victorian suburbs of South London. The initial service ran between Victoria and Herne Hill. Service was extended to a temporary terminus at Elephant and Castle on 6 October 1862 via a reversing move at Herne Hill. From 1 May 1863 services ran directly from Brixton to Camberwell via a curve at Loughborough Junction. Services were extended from Elephant and Castle to Blackfriars on 1 June 1894.

Services ran from Moorgate to London Victoria via Snow Hill (Holborn Viaduct), Camberwell New Road and Brixton and South Stockwell to Grosvenor Road, following the opening of the link northeastwards to via in 1864. The station was also connected to the LC&amp;DR&#x27;s branch to via soon afterwards, with this section (via ) becoming part of the modern-day Catford Loop Line.

The station is currently served only by trains on the main line towards Herne Hill. The Denmark Hill line platforms were closed in April 1916 as a wartime economy measure and have been demolished except for a short section of the up platform. However, the line itself remains in regular and frequent use by both freight and passenger services.

== Services ==
All services at Brixton are operated by Southeastern using and EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 4 tph to 
* 4 tph to via 

On weekends, the service is reduced to two trains per hour in each direction.



==Future Proposals==

The London Overground network passes above the station without stopping. This segment of the South London Line became part of the network as the second phase of the East London line extension project. Completed in December 2012, the extension connected the South London Line to the East and West London Lines, from Surrey Quays to Clapham Junction.

The line also passes through Loughborough Junction. Adding both stations to the route was excluded from the plan due to the prohibitive cost of building on the high viaducts at each location. The proposals drew criticism for not including new interchange stations at these locations. Until 1976 trains stopped at nearby . It has been proposed that this disused station could be reopened instead as the site is close to both Brixton and Loughborough Junction.

== Artworks ==
A number of colourful murals have been painted on the outside of the station. Inside the station, three bronze sculptures stand on the platforms. This work, Platforms Piece by Kevin Atherton, was erected in 1986 and the statues are life casts of three people - two black, one white - who regularly travelled from Brixton. The statues, believed to be the first sculptures of black British people in a public place in the UK, were given Grade II listed status in November 2016.

<text> () is a station on line 12 of the Paris Métro in the 7th arrondissement. It is named after the nearby National Assembly.

== History ==
The station opened as &quot;Chambre des députés&quot; on 5 November 1910 as part of the original section of the Nord-Sud Company&#x27;s line A between Porte de Versailles and Notre-Dame-de-Lorette. On 27 March 1931, line A became line 12 when It was taken over by its competitor, the Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain de Paris (CMP), incorporating it into the Paris Métro. On 1 July 1989, the station was renamed &quot;Assemblée nationale&quot;, as it is still known today, to be more consistent with the official name of the lower house of the bicameral French Parliament under the Fifth Republic.
In 1990, the French artist Jean-Charles Blais decorated the platform with posters, made up of a series of large black silhouette heads on a colourful background. They were periodically updated. From 2004-14, the artist was asked to imagine a new series of images for the station&#x27;s platforms, titled &quot;La Chambre double&quot;. It was updated every three months as part of the contract with the RATP. This arrangement ended in 2014 when the artist had discovered that the installation had been dismantled back in the autumn of 2013 to make way for a new exhibition that consisted of reproductions of photographs from the Photoquai exhibition. In 2015, the Tribunal de Grande Instance de Paris demanded the RATP to pay the artist 14,000 euros in compensation for putting an end to the display without his authorisation, breaching the contract. In 2008, a temporary exhibition, &quot;Des Paroles et des Actes&quot;, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Fifth Republic, with the permission of Jean-Charles Blais, was displayed on the platforms for three months. It displayed portraits of the Presidents of the French Republic and main events concerning France and transport.

On 28 September 2016, Claude Bartolone, then the President of the National Assembly, accompanied by Élisabeth Borne, then the President of the RATP, inaugurated the station&#x27;s new decor. It was designed and produced by a collaboration between Philippe Daney, the architectural firm MiRo, and lighting designer Timothé Toury. 

Metal plates on the platform walls illustrates the stone walls of the Palais Bourbon, where the National Assembly meets, with large visuals on it that display images of the meeting chamber, articles of the French constitution, as well as extracts from the Tennis Court Oath. A set of mirrors serves to remind travellers that the Assembly must reflect the will of the people.

It features several themes that provide a contemporary vision of the National Assembly, depicting them through insets into the bodywork on the walls of the platforms such as visuals and videos for travellers to learn more about democracy and to participate more in public debate. When the assembly is in session, a screen broadcasts debates in the meeting chamber or in the committees. A screen on each platform also broadcasts La Chaîne parlementaire (The Parliamentary Channel). 

The platform vault features a lighting scheme that changes depending on the time of the day: bluish before dawn, orange in the morning, and calmer during the day, changing continuously mimicking passing clouds in the sky.

In 2019, the station was used by 1,063,551 passengers, making it the 290th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 395,997 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 293rd busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 611,512 passengers, making it the 295th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

== Passenger services ==

=== Access ===
The station has three accesses:

* Access 1: Boulevard Saint-Germain &quot;Assemblée Nationale&quot;
* Access 2: rue de Lille
* Access 3: rue de l&#x27;Université

=== Station layout ===
=== Platforms ===
The station has a standard configuration with 2 tracks surrounded by 2 side platforms. The lower portion of the side walls are vertical instead of elliptical, as are the other stations constructed by the Nord-Sud company (today on lines 12 and 13).

=== Other connections ===
The station is also served by lines 63, 73, 83, 84, 87, and 94 of the RATP bus network, and at might, by lines N01 and N02 of the Noctilien bus network.

<doc id="504676" wikidata="Q36648" url="?curid=504676" title="Torres Strait Creole">
<text>Torres Strait Creole (), also known as Torres Strait Pidgin, Brokan/Broken, Cape York Creole, Lockhart Creole, Kriol, Papuan, Broken English, Blaikman, Big Thap, Pizin, and Ailan Tok, is an English-based creole language (a variety of Pidgin English) spoken on several Torres Strait Islands of Queensland, Australia; Northern Cape York; and south-western coastal Papua New Guinea (PNG).

It has an estimated 20,000–30,000 mother-tongue and bi/tri-lingual speakers. It is widely used as a language of trade and commerce.

==History==
Records of pidgin English being used in Torres Strait exist from as early as the 1840s (e.g. Moore 1979), and therefore Torres Strait Creole may very well be as old as, if not older, than its sister languages, and not a descendant of any of these. It was spread throughout the islands because many considered it to be English. The main importers of the pidgin were British and other sailors, many of whom were South Sea Islanders, both Melanesian and Polynesian, as well as Island South-East Asians, Jamaicans, Cantonese Chinese, Japanese, and others. Therefore, Torres Strait Creole has various characteristics of these different types of Pidgin, the main ones being mid- to late 1800s Malay-area Pidgin English (but not Singlish, one of its modern representatives), Pacific Pidgin and Jamaican Patois. It may have creolised quite early (pre-1900) on Darnley Island, and somewhat later (post-1910) at St Pauls on Moa and on Yorke Island in the Central Islands. Creolisation is post-1960s elsewhere.

The Papuan dialect was replaced by Hiri Motu in many parts of its former territory, which in turn is being replaced by Tok Pisin.

==Dialects==
Torres Strait Creole has six main dialects: Papuan, Western-Central, TI, Malay, Eastern, and Cape York. Its main characteristics show that it is a Pacific Pidgin, but the future in &quot;X [i] go VERB&quot; aligns it with Atlantic Creoles. Related languages are Pijin of the Solomon Islands, Tok Pisin of Papua New Guinea, and Bislama of Vanuatu. The other creoles of Australia (such as Roper River Kriol and Australian Kriol language) are more distantly related, being descendants of the Pidgin English that developed in and around Sydney after the colonisation of Australia.

Dialects differ mainly from the influences in the various areas the language is spoken or by the language of the ethnic groups that use the language as well as a certain amount of superstrata influence from English. Apart from accent and intonation, differences are mainly vocabulary used for local fauna, flora and so on, retentions from local indigenous languages or other substrata languages (such as Malay) and minor differences in pronunciation because of substrata influences.

The dialects group generally into the Western-Central-Cape York dialects where the western and central language of Torres Strait (Kala Lagaw Ya) has a strong influence (an influence which is also &#x27;over-powering&#x27; other sub-strata influences), &#x27;TI&#x27; Brokan with a strong Malay/Indonesian-Filipino-European influence, Eastern Brokan with a South Seas and Meriam Mìr influence, and Papuan, with influences from languages such as Agöb, Bine, Gizrra, Wipi, Kiwai, Motu and (now) Tok Pisin. Influences from other languages such as Japanese are to do with vocabulary specific to Japanese (or the like) items.

==Continuum==
Torres Strait Creole exists as part of a lect continuum: a local language (Kalaw Kawaw Ya), a local language mix called Ap-ne-Ap, a pidgin basilect creole, a mesolect English influenced creole, local Torres Strait (Thursday Island) English, and General Australian English, as this example shows:
* English: &quot;I&#x27;m really tired&quot;
* Thursday Island English: &quot;I&#x27;m proper tired&quot;
* Mesolect Brokan: &quot;Ai prapa taiad&quot;
* Basilect Brokan: &quot;Ai mina taiad&quot;
* Ap-ne-Ap: &quot;Ngai mina taiad mepa&quot;
* Kalau Kawau Ya: &quot;Ngai mina gamukœubaasipa&quot;

==Speakers==
The 2016 Australian census recorded 6,171 people who spoke Yumplatok at home, but linguists working on the language have estimated that from 20,000 to 30,000 Indigenous Australians spoke it as their first language in 2010. In 2007 a translation of the Bible was published, called the &quot;Holi Baibul&quot;, which was the first complete translation of the Bible into any Indigenous language within Australia.

Most Torres Strait Islander people speak Yumplatok in addition to their local languages, and a 2014 study suggests that the numbers of people speaking Kriol are growing. It is widely used as a language of trade and commerce.

==Phonology==

=== Vowels ===
The language has the following vowels (with some dialect variation):
Vowel length for the language as a whole is non-contrastive, though in some subdialects/dialects it appears to be contrastive.

=== Consonants ===
The dental-alveolar contrast exists in the Western, Central and Cape York dialects, however only exists in other dialects in so far as either English or Western-Central influences force a contrast, or where the voiced alveolar stop realises as the rhotic tap (e.g. Western-Central &quot;wasamada&quot; &#x27;what&#x27;s the matter/what&#x27;s wrong&#x27;, Eastern/Papuan &quot;wasamara&quot;). In the Papuan dialects, the only alveolar consonant is , while and can be either dental (i.e. fall together with and ) or alveolar, according to local language. In Meriam influenced Broken, is dental, while is alveolar.

The stops , , , , and are aspirated and also have fricative allophones, particularly (thus , , , , , ) while and vary in pronunciation when word initial and medial between and , with only appearing at the ends of words in Torres Strait and Papuan dialects. These reflect indigenous language allophony as well as a rationalisation of the larger English (and Malay, etc.) consonant phoneme inventory. The consonants , , , , , , and do not have any major allophonic variation, while varies between .

==Grammar==

===Pronouns===
The following are the forms of the personal pronouns in the Western-Central-Cape York dialects. Where the Eastern dialect is concerned, the dental-alveolar contrast is on the whole non-operative, and the dual forms are less commonly used than elsewhere. Furthermore, the 1–2 form &quot;yumi&quot; is often used as the general non-singular 1–2 form; and is sometimes used as such in other dialects in rhetorical discourse. The Central Islands dialect (and sometimes others) tends to also use &quot;wi&quot; for the 1st person plural.

The non-identifying 3rd plural &quot;òl&quot; is also found as a nominal plural marker:
* &quot;I gad òl bùk ianau&quot; &#x27;There are books here&#x27;

==== Interrogatives and Demonstratives ====
* this, these: full form &quot;dhiswan&quot;, colloquial form &quot;dhisan&quot;, reduced, clause initial form &quot;san&quot;, &quot;sa&quot;
* that, those: full form &quot;dhaswan&quot;, colloquial form &quot;dhasan&quot;, reduced, clause initial form &quot;san&quot;, &quot;sa&quot;
There is a strong tendency for &quot;dhiswan&quot; and its forms to be used to the exclusion of &quot;dhaswan&quot;.
* Who is that? &quot;Dhaswan i udhat?&quot;, &quot;Dhiswan dhe i udhat?&quot;, &quot;Dhasan i udhat?&quot;, &quot;Dhisan dhe i udhat?&quot;, &quot;Dhisan i udhat?&quot;, &quot;San i udhat?&quot;, &quot;San dhe i udhat?&quot;

Three interrogatives and the two deictics have two forms, this being (interrogatives) a reduced clause initial form and a fuller clause final form, and in the case of the deictics, a pre-clitic and independent form, as in the following examples:

* &quot;Wane yu luk?&quot; [alt. &quot;Wane yu lukem?&quot;] / &quot;Yu luk wanem?&quot; &#x27;What do you see?&#x27;
* &quot;Kenu i ya kam.&quot; / &quot;Kenu i kam iya.&quot; &#x27;A canoe is coming this way.&#x27;

Clause position variation (initial, final)
* what: &quot;wane&quot;, &quot;wanem&quot;
* where: &quot;we&quot;, &quot;wea&quot;
* who: &quot;udha&quot;, &quot;udhat&quot;
Pre-clitic vs independent form:
* there: &quot;dhe&quot;, &quot;dhea&quot;
* here: &quot;ya&quot;, &quot;iya&quot;

Two interrogatives have variant words/forms, used interchangeably:
* when: &quot;wataim&quot;, &quot;wen&quot;
* why: &quot;aukam&quot;, &quot;wanempò&quot;

Dialectal variation is only found in two forms:
* how: &quot;wiswei&quot;; Central Islands: &quot;waswei&quot;
* why, what&#x27;s the matter: &quot;wasamada&quot;; Eastern-Papuan &quot;wasamara&quot;

===Articles===
The language has no indefinite article, and uses the definite article much less than it is in English, it having a more demonstrative feel than the English equivalent. There are singular, dual and plural forms:
* singular: &quot;dha&quot; — &quot;dha kenu&quot; &#x27;the canoe&#x27;
* dual: &quot;dhemtu&quot;, &quot;dhostu&quot; — &quot;dhemtu kenu&quot;, &quot;dhostu kenu&quot; &#x27;the two canoes&#x27;
* plural: &quot;dhem&quot; — &quot;dhem kenu&quot; &#x27;the canoes&#x27;
The demonstrative articles have a general form, and a specific dual form, as well as variation, with a strong tendency to use the clitics &quot;iya&quot; and &quot;dhea&quot; to specify position; the definitie articles are often used with the demonstrative clitics to express the demonstrative articles:
* this man: &quot;dhis man&quot;, &quot;dhis man ia&quot;
* these men (dual): &quot;dhistu man&quot;, &quot;dhistu man ia&quot;, &quot;dhemtu man ia&quot;
* these men (plural): &quot;òl dhis man&quot;, &quot;òl dhis man ia&quot;, &quot;dhem man ia&quot;
* all these men: &quot;òlgedha man ia&quot;
* that man: &quot;dhas/dhat man&quot;, &quot;dhis man dhea&quot;
* those men (dual): &quot;dhostu man&quot;, &quot;dhistu man dhea&quot;, &quot;dhemtu man dhea&quot;
* those men (plural): &quot;òl dhas/dhat man&quot;, &quot;òl dhis man dhea&quot;, &quot;dhem man dhea&quot;
* all those men: &quot;òlgedha man dhea&quot;

===Syntax===
Torres Strait Creole is a somewhat atypical of Pidgin-Creole languages in its word order and various other syntactic (and grammatical) properties. Though the normal sentence word order is the expected transitive S-V-O-X(-) and intransitive S-V-X(-), there is variation in the form of S-X-V(-O), such as where the directional adverbs &quot;dhe&quot; &#x27;there&#x27; and &quot;ia/ya&quot; &#x27;here&#x27; come before the verb, as happens in all local languages (this is in common with virtually all verb tense/aspect/mood markers in the language).

Verb clause strings are normal in the language:
* &quot;Bala blo mi bi teke kenu kam baik.&quot; &#x27;My brother brought the canoe back&#x27;
* &quot;Plein i dhe plai go&quot; / &quot;Plein i dhe go plai&quot; / &quot;Plein i plai dhe go&quot; / &quot;Plein i plai go dhea&quot; &#x27;The plane is flying away (over) there&#x27;

The four sentences in Torres Strait Creole carry a semantic difference difficult to show in the English translation. &quot;Plein i dhe go plai&quot; is the basic sentence — &#x27;the plane is flying [away] over there&#x27;. &quot;Plein i plai dhe go&quot; is more along the lines of &#x27;the plane is flying away that way&#x27;; &quot;plein i plai go dhea&quot; is &#x27;the plane is flying away heading that way&#x27;, and finally &quot;plein i dhe plai go&quot; is &#x27;the plane is there flying away&#x27;.

Unlike many pidgin-creoles, the adjective categorically comes before the noun. Similarly, adverbs that mark adjectives come before the adjective:
* &quot;Big sisi bl&#x27;em bi kese tu prapa big redkala pis lo ausaid sanbaing.&quot; &#x27;His/her big sister caught two really big red fish at/on the outer sandbank&#x27;

Unlike Tok Pisin, Bislama and the Australian creoles, &quot;-pla&quot; is not used as an adjective formant.

When not before the referent, adjectives are often suffixed by &quot;-wan&quot;, the adjective nominaliser, or by an appropriate nominal, such as &quot;man&quot; &#x27;man, person&#x27;
* &quot;Bala blo mi i bigwan / bigman.&quot; &#x27;My brother is big&#x27;
* &quot;Dhis dhamba ya i prapa naiswan.&quot; &#x27;This bread is really nice&#x27;

All verb tense and aspect markers come before the verb (see Verbs below), apart from the clitic &quot;nau&quot;.

A fully operational relative clause structure exists, marked by the relative clause marker &quot;we&quot;:
* &quot;Dha totol we ai bi kese em i stap ananith lo aus.&quot; &#x27;The turtle I caught is under the house&#x27;
* &quot;Ama bin luk smol gel we i dhe sidaun krai krai krai lo skul blo dhem piknini.&quot; &#x27;Mum saw a little girl (who was) sitting and crying at the kids&#x27; school&#x27;

Questions vary between using English/Meriam Mìr-like word order, i.e. question word initially, or Kala Lagaw Ya/Malay-like word order, i.e. question word order is the same as that of statements. As stated above, the question word has its full form when used clause finally, and a reduced form otherwise. In yes–no questions, statement word order is normal, with the use of a question tag sentence clitic:
* &quot;We yu go?&quot; / &quot;Yu go wea?&quot; &#x27;Where are you going?&#x27;
* &quot;Udha nem blo yu?&quot; / &quot;Nem blo yu udhat?&quot; &#x27;What is your name?&#x27;
* &quot;Wataim em i go kam bai&#x27;gen?&quot; / &quot;Em i go kam bai&#x27;gen wataim?&quot; &#x27;When is he going to come back?&#x27;
* &quot;Aukam yu sabe blaikman tok?&quot; &#x27;How come you can speak the black people&#x27;s language?&#x27;
* &quot;Bambai athe blo dhemtu i go stap ospetal au?&quot; &#x27;Is their grandfather going to stay in hospital?&#x27;
* &quot;Yu pinis luk piksa a?&quot; &#x27;Have you finished watching the film?&#x27;

===Verbs===
====Transitivity and Voice====

Verbs can be marked for transitivity and voice (transitive-passive or intransitive-antipassive), but not person, tense, aspect or mood. Voice marking is for the transitive-passive, and made by suffixing &quot;-e&quot; to the verb stem when the object follows the verb, and &quot;-em&quot; when the object is elsewhere in the clause. Note that the suffix &quot;-em&quot; is of fairly recent development, and is in origin an abbreviation of the verb phrase form &quot;VERB-e em&quot;, where the cross referencing pronoun em and the suffix have coalesced (via &quot;-i em&quot; → &quot;-yem&quot; → &quot;-em&quot;). All these versions exist in everyday speech, as illustrated by &quot;tek&quot; &#x27;take&#x27;: intransitive-antipassive &quot;tek&quot;, transitive-passive &quot;teke&quot;, &quot;teki em&quot;, &quot;tekyem&quot;, &quot;tekem&quot;:
* &quot;Em yustu tek òl buk.&quot; &#x27;He used to/would take took all books&#x27; (antipassive)
* &quot;Em yustu teke dhem buk.&quot; &#x27;He used to take the books&#x27; (transitive)
* &quot;Em yustu teke buk.&quot; &#x27;He used to take a/the book&#x27; (transitive)
* &quot;Dha buk we em i yustu bi tekem i brok.&quot; &#x27;The book he used to take is broken&#x27; (fronted object transitive)
** Variants: &quot;Dha buk we em i yustu bi teke em&quot; / &quot;teki em&quot; / &quot;tekyem i brok.&quot;
The development of a full passive using this form also exists:
* &quot;Buk i yustu bi tekem lo em/prom em.&quot; &#x27;A/The book used to be taken by him.&#x27; the &quot;lo&quot;–&quot;prom&quot; variation is dialectal)

===== Phonological variation of the transitive suffix =====
If the verb stem has &quot;e&quot; or a diphthong, then the transitive suffix is -e; if &quot;i&quot; or &quot;u&quot;, then it can become -i, while of the stem contains &quot;a&quot; or &quot;o&quot;, the suffix can become -a. One or two others verbs have stem extensions to form the verb from a noun:
* &quot;teke&quot; → &quot;teke&quot; &#x27;take, bring&#x27;
* &quot;laite&quot; → &quot;laite&quot; &#x27;light&#x27;
* &quot;pute&quot; → &quot;puti&quot; &#x27;put&#x27;
* &quot;pile&quot; → &quot;pili&quot; &#x27;feel something&#x27;
* &quot;broke&quot; → &quot;broka&quot; &#x27;break&#x27;
* &quot;ama&quot; &#x27;hammer&#x27; → verb &quot;amare&quot;
* &quot;pain&quot; &#x27;point&#x27; → verb &quot;painte&quot;

Verb stems that end in vowels do not take the suffix, while a few verbs are irregular in not taking the suffix:
# Vowel-final stem: &quot;lego&quot; &#x27;to leave, depart, go off/away, throw, throw at&#x27;
#* &quot;Aka bi lego lo kenu.&quot; &#x27;Grandma went off in the canoe&#x27;
#* &quot;Dhem nugud boi bin lego ston pò dhempla.&quot; &#x27;The bad boys threw stones at them&#x27;
# No suffix: &quot;luk&quot;
#* &quot;Ai bi luk pisin plai kam.&quot; &#x27;I saw a bird flying towards me&#x27; (the suffixed form is sometimes used: &quot;Ai bi luki pisin plai kam&quot;).

====Verbs of position and movement====

Certain verbs of position and movement are not followed by a preposition in their most normal clause types. These are not to be confused with transitive clauses:
* &quot;Awa bi stap aus bikòs em i sikwan.&quot; &#x27;Uncle stayed (at) home because he is sick&#x27;
* &quot;Dhem piknini stap dhe Bamaga we Kolez.&quot; &#x27;The children stay at Bamaga at the College&#x27;
* &quot;Dha dog dhe ran go dingi.&quot; &#x27;The/That dog is running to the dinghy&#x27;
* &quot;Pusi i sidaun seya.&quot; &#x27;The cat is sitting in/on the chair&#x27;

====Verb suffixes====

Four derivational suffixes exist which add aspectual meaning to verb stems. Though their origin are English intransitive prepositions, in Torres Strait Creole their status is completely aspectual; they can only be used as suffixes. They are suffixes to the stem of intransitive verbs, and to the full transitive-passive form of transitive verbs. When used as transitive-passive verbs, they also suffix the transitive ending after the suffix. They also derive verbs from other words.
* &quot;-ap&quot; — completive, perfective: &quot;piksimap(e)&quot; &#x27;fix, repair, mend&#x27;; &quot;rol&quot; &#x27;roll&#x27; → &quot;rolemap(e)&quot; &#x27;roll up&#x27;; &quot;bagarap(e)&quot; &#x27;ruin, break, destroy&#x27;
* &quot;-aut&quot; — movement outwards: &quot;kamaut&quot; &#x27;come out&#x27;; &quot;goaut&quot; &#x27;go out&#x27;; &quot;lugaut(e)&quot; &#x27;be careful, beware, take care of, look after&#x27;
* &quot;-baut&quot; — dispersive (this suffix causes the final voiceless consonant of the stem to become voiced): &quot;wagbaut&quot; &#x27;walk, walk about, walk around, stroll&#x27;; &quot;togbaut(e)&quot; &#x27;talk about/over, discuss&#x27;
* &quot;-daun&quot; — downwards movement; only found in &quot;godaun&quot; &#x27;movement downwards from a starting point&#x27;; &quot;kamdaun&quot; &#x27;movement downwards from above&#x27;, &quot;sidaun&quot; &#x27;sit down&#x27;, &quot;pòldaun&quot; &#x27;fall, fall over, fall down&#x27;.

===Prepositions===
Torres Strait Creole shows strong substrata influence in its use of its prepositions. All local languages are either prepositionless case-marking agglutinative languages, or case-marking agglutinative languages where the case endings have evolved to postposition status, which contrast the following cases to varying extents, but which have little or no number marking on nouns:
* nominative
* accusative
* ergative
* genitive
* dative
* ablative
* locative
* perlative
* instrumental
They also contrast the following derived forms (among others according to language), which are not case forms in the local languages, but rather nominals:

* similative
* privative
* proprietive
* resultative

The use of the prepositions in Torres Strait Creole reflect these cases and nominalisations to a certain (= simplified) extent:

blo — genitive: &lt;br&gt; We aus blo misnari? &quot;Where is the priest&#x27;s house?&quot;

pò, lo — dative (in part dialect variation): &lt;br&gt; Em i bin spik pò em se wesis bl’em pinis kam. &quot;She told her her wages had already arrived.&quot;&lt;br&gt; Bos i bi gibi wesis pò/lo mi. &quot;The boss gave the wages to me.&quot;

prom – ablative: &lt;br&gt; ’San i dhe kam prom Dhaudhai. &quot;This one is coming over from Papua.&quot;

lo, we, ene — locative, perlative (lo and we are synonyms, while ene is an archaic word now normally found only in old songs): &lt;br&gt; Aus blo Ama blo mi i stanap dhe antap lo / we il ananith lo / we big mango dhe antap. &quot;My Aunty&#x27;s house is up there on the hill underneath the big mango up there.&quot; &lt;br&gt; Yu mas kam wantaim lo mi. &quot;You must/have to come with me.&quot; &lt;br&gt; Dhemtu baradha i sidaun ene [lo/we] kenu &quot;The two brothers were sitting in the canoe.&quot;

lo — instrumental: &lt;br&gt; Òl man i kate tœtœl lo naip lo bele / lo ath &quot;The men cut (butcher) the turtle with a knife on the bottom shell&quot;.

òlsem, waze (waze is the somewhat more common reduced form of òlsem) – similative (like): &lt;br&gt; Dhempla lo Mari Ailan i no tòk waze yumpla. &quot;The people on Murray Island don&#x27;t talk like us.&quot; &lt;br&gt; Em i dhe swim go waze aligeta. &quot;He&#x27;s swimming away over there like a crocodile.&quot;

==== Syntactic use of the prepositions ====
The prepositions also have syntactic uses, including the following, where they govern verbs or adjectives:

Blo: obligation &lt;br&gt; Ai blo go nau &quot;I have to go now / I&#x27;m supposed to go now&quot;.

Pò: a) focus on a goal &lt;br&gt; Bos i kam pò luk wòk blo yumi. &quot;The boss has come to see / look at our work.&quot; &lt;br&gt; b) extra intensity &lt;br&gt; Dhem pipol blo Saibai i pò dans! &quot;The Saibai people can really dance!&quot; &lt;br&gt; Ai pò taiad nau! &quot;I&#x27;m getting really tired!&quot;

Prom: avoidance &lt;br&gt; Smòl gel i prait prom dog i baite em. &quot;The little girl is afraid that the dog will bite her&quot;

lo, prom — comparative (dialect variation): &lt;br&gt; Dhis dhangal ia i mò big prom/lo nadhawan dhea &quot;This dugong is bigger than that one&quot;.

We: relative clause &lt;br&gt; Aus we Ama i stap i antap lo il we i gad wan big mango. &quot;The house where Aunty lives is on the hill where there is a big mango.&quot; &lt;br&gt; Boi we yumi bin paitem i krai go Ama bl&#x27;em. &quot;The boy that/who we fought went off crying to his Mum.&quot; &lt;br&gt; Òl pipol we i wande gud wòk i mas lane ingglis &quot;Everyone who wants a good job has to learn English.&quot;

Waze (òlsem): in order, so that &lt;br&gt; &quot;ze em i ken luk òl wòk blo yumi.&quot; &quot;The Boss is coming so that he can see our work.&quot;

==Vocabulary==
The language has vocabulary from various sources, though the dominant source is English. Here are lists of Non-English words found in Torres Strait Creole:

Kalaw Kawaw Ya: &quot;yawo&quot; &#x27;goodbye&#x27;, &quot;matha&quot; &#x27;only, very&#x27;, &quot;mina&quot; &#x27;really, truly&#x27;, &quot;babuk&quot; &#x27;crosslegged&#x27;, &quot;aka&quot; &#x27;granny&#x27;, &quot;puripuri&quot; &#x27;magic action, spells, products, medicines etc.&#x27; (from the early Kauraraigau Ya [Kowrareg — the Southern dialect of Kalaw Lagaw Ya] word &quot;puri&quot;; in modern Kala Lagaw Ya the word is &quot;puyi&quot;).

Meriam Mir: &quot;baker&quot; (&quot;bakìr&quot;) &#x27;money&#x27; (beside the more general &quot;baks&quot;), &quot;watai&quot; (&quot;wathai&quot;) &#x27;bamboo break-wind fence&#x27;.

<doc id="504677" wikidata="Q1080071" url="?curid=504677" title="Submarine simulator">
<text>A submarine simulator is a video game in which the player commands a submarine. The usual form of the game is to go on a series of missions, each of which features a number of encounters where the goal is to sink surface ships and to survive counterattacks by destroyers. Submarine simulators are notable for the highly-variable pace of the game; it may take hours of simulated time to get into position to attack a well-defended convoy, and sub simulators typically include an option for players to adjust the ratio of real time to simulated time up and down as desired.

Most submarine simulators use World War II as the setting; its submarine warfare was lengthy and intense, the historical material is extensive, and the limited capabilities of the period&#x27;s submarines place a high premium on game playing skill. Games usually feature either US submarines in the Pacific Ocean, or German U-boats in the Atlantic Ocean. Another popular category is modern attack submarines, especially those of the also known as &quot;688s&quot; after the hull identification number of the first vessel of the class.

Game displays generally include an overhead map or &quot;radar&quot; view, showing the submarine and any ships whose position can be detected, the periscope view if the sub is close enough to the surface, a set of gauges showing depth and course, and a boat plan showing torpedo availability, damage to various subsystems and other in-game issues that may arise.

The first submarine simulator available to the civilian public was Thorn EMI&#x27;s &quot;Submarine Commander&quot; of 1982.

==Titles==
The adventure game &quot;&quot; (1989) by Sierra On-line contained a submarine simulator portion.

The vehicle simulator game &quot;Naval Ops: Warship Gunner 2&quot; (2006) by Koei features submarine hulls &amp; puts the player through several submarine piloting missions, though several other missions are also restricted against submarine use.

==AUV simulators==
There are also a number of simulators available for underwater robots such as AUVs. These simulators are commonly used by research institutes for testing robot control and coordination algorithms before or during the development of a submarine. One of them is UWSim, the Underwater Simulator, which was developed in the IRSLab for marine robotics research and development. UWSim started with the RAUVI and TRIDENT research projects as a tool for testing and integrating perception and control algorithms before running them on the real robots and has continued its development until today.

<doc id="504680" wikidata="Q1368640" url="?curid=504680" title="Solférino station">
<text>Solférino () is a station on line 12 of the Paris Métro in the 7th arrondissement. It is named after the nearby rue de Solférino, which in turn was named after the Battle of Solferino, a battle fought in 1859 during the Second Italian War of Independence, where the Franco-Piedmontese troops commanded by Napoleon III defeated the Austrians. It was also named after then &quot;passerelle Solférino&quot;, a footbridge over the Seine, now known as the Passerelle Léopold-Sédar-Senghor.

== History ==
The station opened on 5 November 1910 as part of the original section of the Nord-Sud Company&#x27;s line A between Porte de Versailles and Notre-Dame-de-Lorette. On 27 March 1931, line A became line 12 when the Nord-Sud was taken over by the Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain de Paris (CMP), incorporating it into the Paris Métro.

From the late 1930s to the early 1970s the station was subtitled &quot;Gare d&#x27;Orsay&quot; after the SNCF station 350 meters to the north. The subtitle never appeared on the station platforms, because the Nord-Sud designers used porcelain tiles for the station names. 

The station was featured in a brief scene in an advertisement by Givenchy starring Rooney Mara for its perfume &quot;L&#x27;Interdit&quot; in 2018 at the staircase at access 1, although it was mainly shot at the Porte des Lilas - Cinéma ghost station.

In 2019, the station was used by 2,073,832 passengers, making it the 240th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 923,536 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 250th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 1,269,143 passengers, making it the 254th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

== Passenger services ==

=== Access ===
The statio has three accesses:

* Access 1: place Jacques Bainville
* Access 2: rue de Bellechasse &quot;Musée d&#x27;Orsay&quot; (an ascending escalator)
* Access 2: rue Saint-Dominique

=== Station layout ===
=== Platforms ===

The station has a standard configuration with 2 tracks surrounded by 2 side platforms. The lower portion of the side walls are vertical instead of elliptical, as with the other stations constructed by the Nord-Sud company (today on lines 12 and 13). It is one of the two stations on the line where the original Nord-Sud company style of décor have been maintained with its characteristic large ceramic tablets indicating the name of the station with the other station being Porte de la Chapelle.

=== Other connections ===
It is an out-of-station interchange with the Musée d&#x27;Orsay station on line C of the RER located around 250 metres away from the station. It is accessible by walking along rue de Bellechasse towards the north.

The station is also served by line 63, 68, 69, 73, 83, 84, 87, and 94 of the RATP bus network, and at night, by line N02 of the Noctilien bus network.

<text>SUBSIM is an online publication founded by Neal Stevens in Jan. 1997 that focuses on naval and submarine computer game reviews, articles, and news. Subsim is short for Submarine simulator. Subsim&#x27;s forums have been online since 1999, with archives back to 2001. Membership totals were 117,023 at August 2016, with approximately 7,700 active members daily. International meets have been held in London, Houston, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Groton, Germany, and Tokyo.

Subsim is the media outlet for game publishers that feature naval content, a resource for military strategists, as well as a source of editorial comment on the state of PC computer simulations and games. Subsim members have been consultants and testers for game such as , Silent Hunter II, Silent Hunter III, Dangerous Waters, Sub Command, Fleet Command, Destroyer Command, among others. Shortly after the release of the ill-fated Silent Hunter II, Ubisoft agreed to provide Subsim with the game source code to replace the rTime multiplayer engine with DirectPlay. Subsim members raised $10,000 to pay a programmer to make the improvements.

==Significant events==
1998 - Subsim gets their first industry interview: Mike Jones of Aces of the Deep answers a series of questions about his groundbreaking U-boat sim. Also, the Subsim &quot;Fix My 688(I) Campaign&quot; begins, designed to urge EA/Sonalysts into producing a no-cheat patch for Jane&#x27;s 688(I).

2002 - Subsim works with Ubisoft producer Carl Norman to initiate a broad reaching mod that will convert Silent Hunter II and Destroyer Command from the original MP engine (rTime) to Microsoft DirectPlay. The mod is deemed Projekt Messerwetzer (messerwetzer (ms-r-vt-zr-) n. [German] - A craftsman who sharpens old knives.) To avoid legal constraints, &quot;Projekt Messerwetzer&quot; is funded purely by donations and will be free to all. Subsim donates $1000 and Subsim players eventually raise $10,000 for the project. Multiplayer was significantly improved with this unofficial patch.

2003 - Subsim and Sub Club members meeting in London for the first Intercontinental Meeting.

2004 - Subsim Editor Neal Stevens attends the 2004 E3 convention in Los Angeles. First looks at Sid Meier&#x27;s Pirates, Akella&#x27;s PT Boats, and Ubisoft&#x27;s Silent Hunter III reveal that 2005 will be a very good year for subsim players.

2006 - Neal Stevens of Subsim is invited aboard the new nuclear submarine USS Texas for a media tour. The Sept. 9 commissioning ceremony drew more than 10,000 guests and visitors to Galveston, including ship sponsor First Lady Laura Bush, Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn.

2007 - Subsim publishes the 2007 Submarine Almanac, celebrating 10 years on the web with a flotilla of stories, articles, and art from naval historians, subsim players, game developers, and Navy men. Foreword by Bestselling Author Joe Buff.

Abraham Zeegers of Netherlands, moderator and host of the 2005 Subsim meet, is found dead in his Amsterdam apartment, less than one week after he had testified at the Willem Holleeder trial. Dutch media discovered that although Abraham was a state witness in protective custody, he had a secret identity and was prominent in the Subsim forums.

2008 - Subsim&#x27;s server is knocked offline by a transformer explosion and fire at The Planet Internet Services (ex. EV1 &amp; Rackshack) Houston datacenter. At first, the Planet was able to restore power after two days but the datacenter&#x27;s backup generator failed, and the website was down two more days.

2009 - Subsim hosts their fifth international meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark. Members shuttle to Kiel, Germany to tour , the only remaining Type VII U-boat and conduct dives onboard Peter Madsen&#x27;s 18.2m (approx.) homebuilt submarine, UC3 Nautilus.

2010 - Subsim breaks the 50,000 member mark. The annual April Fools&#x27; Day prank causes a furor.

2016 - Swedish submarine game HMS Marulken is picked up as Subsim&#x27;s first game production: Wolfpack.

2019 - Subsim and Usurpator release Wolfpack on Steam.

2022 - Subsim celebrates 25 years on the web.

<text>Rennes () is a station on line 12 of the Paris Métro in the 6th arrondissement.

Located in the 6th arrondissement, part of the Left Bank of the city, &quot;Rennes&quot; is one stations on line 12 that lie beneath Boulevard Raspail, in this case, at its intersection with &quot;rue de Rennes&quot;. It is from this street that it takes its name, which in turn is named after the city of Rennes.

== History ==
The station opened on 5 November 1910 as part of the original section of the Nord-Sud Company&#x27;s line A between Porte de Versailles and Notre-Dame-de-Lorette. On 27 March 1931, line A became line 12 when It was taken over by its competitor, the Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain de Paris (CMP), incorporating it into the Paris Métro.

On 2 September 1939, the station was closed as part of the government&#x27;s plan that reduced service on the métro network as a cost-saving measure in light of the onset of World War II, with all but 85 stations closed. Most reopened after the war, although some of them, including &quot;Rennes&quot;, remained closed due to their light traffic, hence, becoming a ghost station. For a period of time while it was closed, it was used to experiment with advertising schemes which could be viewed from passing trains.

On 20 May 1968, after 29 years of closure, the station was finally reopened, albeit with limited operating hours as a cost saving measure. It was closed after 8pm from Monday to Saturday, and was closed all day on Sundays and public holidays. The walls of the station were coated with a white layer of paint due to the lack of maintenance causing the tiles on the walls to deteriorate.

In 2002, it was reported that the station had 4400 &quot;incoming&quot; commuters per day.

This arrangement lasted until 7 September 2004, when it was adjusted to the standard operating hours of most other stations at the local residents&#x27; request. This was due to changes in commuting patterns, where more commuters returned home later in the evening in addition to high traffic to &quot;Marché Raspail&quot;, a traditional market nearby, on Sundays. Only Liège on line 13 retained limited operating hours, until 4 December 2006.

As part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; programme by the RATP, the station was renovated and modernised on 7 October 2008.

In 2019, the station was used by 1,181,641 passengers, making it the 287th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 506,779 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 291st busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 861,334 passengers, making it the 287th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

== Passenger services ==

=== Access ===
The station has two accesses:

* Access 1: rue de Renne

<doc id="504688" wikidata="Q8030649" url="?curid=504688" title="Woman's Hour">
<text>Woman&#x27;s Hour is a radio magazine programme broadcast in the United Kingdom on the BBC Light Programme, BBC Radio 2, and later BBC Radio 4. It has been on the air since 1946.

==History==
The first BBC programme for women was the programme called &quot;Women&#x27;s Hour&quot;, which was first broadcast on 2 May 1923. The BBC was then a brand new organisation, just a few months old, grappling with the sorts of programmes that might appeal to its small but growing audience. With married women firmly based in the home, either through convention or because of marriage bars, the BBC would have been aware of this captive daytime audience. The person brought in to oversee &quot;Women&#x27;s Hour&quot; was Mrs Ella Fitzgerald, a former Fleet Street journalist, and the inaugural programme included two talks, one on &quot;The Adoption of Babies&quot; given by Princess Alice, the Duchess of Athlone, the other on &quot;Fashions&quot; by the couturier, Lady Duff Gordon.

Broadcast six days a week, initially at 5pm, &quot;Women&#x27;s Hour&quot; encompassed topics such as cookery, infant welfare, poultry keeping, tennis, beauty culture, electricity in the home, society gossip and gardening. In many ways, it replicated the sorts of items that were then found in the women&#x27;s pages of newspapers and Ella Fitzgerald often drew on her journalist friends to write and present talks. So, for example, regular &quot;Kitchen Conversations&quot; were given by the famous cookery writer Mrs CS Peel while Edith Shackleton spoke about journalism as a potential career for women. There was also space for political talks. The former suffragist, Lady Emmott, who sat on a number of local government committees, spoke on &quot;How Local Government affects the Home&quot;; Alderman Miss Smee, who chaired Acton Council&#x27;s Public Health Committee gave a talk on &quot;Women and Public Health&quot; and Lettice Fisher, the founder of the National Council for the Unmarried Mother and her Child, talked about &quot;Education&quot;.

The talks were broadcast from the BBC&#x27;s first purpose-built studio at Savoy Hill, just off The Strand in London, where the organisation was based for its first ten years. It would have been quite a daunting process. Speakers would have waited outside the large curtain-draped space, clutching their scripts. When the time came to deliver their talk, they would then have stood before a large box-like structure – the microphone – where they would have been given a cue to start. It was then just a matter of continuing on until finished, hopeful that they hadn&#x27;t spoken too slowly or too fast or made too many mistakes. In the absence of any recordings, it&#x27;s not possible to know what these talks would have sounded like, but reception on rudimentary wireless sets would have been very poor. It&#x27;s also impossible to know who would have been tuning-in to the programme in these very early days, but most probably they were the wives and mothers of radio enthusiasts who, evidence suggests, were overwhelmingly male.

Things would change for &quot;Women&#x27;s Hour&quot; in December 1923, with the establishment of a Women&#x27;s Advisory Committee to oversee the running of the programme. Amongst the prestigious membership were the Chairman of the National Federation of Women&#x27;s Institutes, Lady Denman; the actress Dorothea Baird; the physician Dr Elizabeth Sloan Chesser and the Secretary of the Women&#x27;s Amateur Athletics Association, Mrs Violet Cambridge. The first full meeting, in January 1924, raised questions about the sorts of talks that should be included in &quot;Women&#x27;s Hour&quot; and also the time of day that it was broadcast. It was decided that two members of the Committee, Mrs Hardman Earle (who had worked for the Ministry of Food and Public Kitchens during the First World War) and Evelyn Gates (who was Editor-in-Chief of The Women&#x27;s Yearbook) should appear on the following Saturday&#x27;s programme to canvas listener views. The case for practical domestic talks was put forward by Mrs Hardman Earle while Evelyn Gates championed the case for lighter, escapist talks and listeners were also asked about when they could best tune-in.

The results of the &#x27;plebiscite&#x27;, as it was termed, were discussed at the February meeting of the Women&#x27;s Advisory Committee. With the majority of the letters received (326 in all) voting for leisure rather than domestic talks, it was agreed that these should feature more prominently in the programme, which would be moved to a new time of 4pm. Writing about the change in the BBC listings periodical &quot;Radio Times&quot;, Ella Fitzgerald explained how &quot;a tour of Constantinople&quot; was substituted for &quot;the cure of constipation&quot; while &quot;talks on the English country-side&quot; replaced those about &quot;stocking the kitchen cupboard&quot;. The decision was also taken at the meeting to abolish the name &quot;Women&#x27;s Hour&quot;; in future &quot;Radio Times&quot; would simply state that &quot;talks of general interest but with particular appeal to women&quot; would be placed either side of the afternoon concert.

Created by Norman Collins and originally presented by Alan Ivimey, &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; was first broadcast on 7 October 1946 on the BBC Light Programme. Janet Quigley, who was also involved with the birth of the UK radio programme &quot;Today&quot;, has been credited with &quot;virtually creating&quot; the programme.

The programme was transferred to its current home in 1973. Over the years it has been presented by Mary Hill (19461963), Joan Griffiths (19471949), Olive Shapley (19491953), Jean Metcalfe (19501968), Violet Carson (19521956), Marjorie Anderson (19581972), Teresa McGonagle (19581976), Judith Chalmers (19661970), Sue MacGregor (19721987), Jenni Murray (1987–2020), Martha Kearney (1998 to March 2007), and Jane Garvey (8 October 2007 to December 2020). Fill-in presenters have included Andrea Catherwood, Sangita Myska, Sheila McClennon, Carolyn Quinn, Jane Little, Ritula Shah, Oona King, and Amanda Platell. In September 2020 it was announced that Emma Barnett would become the lead presenter of &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; after the retirement of Jenni Murray, who presented her final edition on 1 October 2020. Barnett, who had been a fill-in presenter a number of times previously, became the youngest woman to regularly present the programme in January 2021. Anita Rani became the successor to Garvey as the second presenter in the same month.

In the early years the topics for the programme were arranged well in advance and printed in the &quot;Radio Times&quot; but by the 1980s there was a change to greater topicality. Clare Selerie-Gray became the producer in 1987 and steered the programme away from its tendency to include merely whimsical topics and ensured that the books read in the last section were more relevant to women&#x27;s lives rather than ordinary novels. She responded to criticism that the programme was too feminist by asserting that it avoided &quot;&quot;Spare Rib&quot; didactics&quot; but that a feminist influence on the people who made it had occurred.

On 31 December 2004, the show became &quot;Man&#x27;s Hour&quot; for one day only, on which it was presented by Channel 4 News anchor Jon Snow. On 18 July 2010, after 64 years of &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot;, the BBC began broadcasting a full series called &quot;Men&#x27;s Hour&quot; on BBC Radio 5 Live, presented by Tim Samuels.

In 2006, Woman&#x27;s Hour had 2.7 million listeners.

For one week in April 2014, the programme was guest edited by J. K. Rowling, Kelly Holmes, Naomi Alderman, Doreen Lawrence and Lauren Laverne. It was the first time the programme had a guest editor since its initial decade of broadcast. In September 2015, the programme hosted &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour Takeover&quot; with a week of guest editors, including Kim Cattrall, Nimko Ali, Rachel Treweek, Michelle Mone and Jacqueline Wilson.

&quot;Late Night Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot;, a spinoff series, was launched in 2015, presented by Lauren Laverne. The series is broadcast in an 11pm timeslot and each episode takes a single topic for discussion.
The lateness of the broadcast allows for more freedom to handle topics considered unsuitable for the morning broadcast.

The programme has an annual &quot;power list&quot; of highly achieving women. The annual power list is determined by a panel of judges.

On 18 March 2011, &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; was the first live broadcast from the new dock10 studios at Media City in Salford.

In 2013, the programme had 3.9 million listeners, 14% of whom were men. In October 2016, it was recorded that the programme had 3.7 million listeners weekly and was the second most popular daily podcast across BBC Radio. A quarter of its audience were reported to be under 35 and 40% male.

==Format==
The bulk of the programme has always consisted of reports, interviews and debates on health, education, cultural and political topics aimed at women and mothers. However, until 2021 these occupied only the first 45 minutes of the hour. The final 15 minutes consisted of more lightweight entertainment, usually fiction, still broadly directed at women. Prior to 1998, this slot featured readings. From 1998 to 2021 it featured short-run drama serials, known initially as &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour Drama&quot; and later as &quot;15 Minute Drama&quot;. One of the most popular of these was the recurring &quot;Ladies of Letters&quot; serial, starring Prunella Scales and Patricia Routledge. The drama slot was dropped in 2021, since when the full hour of &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; has been given over to reports and interviews etc.

==Schedule==
&quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; has been broadcast at 10am Monday to Friday since James Boyle&#x27;s revision of the Radio 4 schedules in April 1998. Between September 1991 and April 1998 it was broadcast at 10:30am, having previously gone out for many years in an early afternoon slot (2pm). The programme&#x27;s move to a morning slot was unpopular among some listeners who, for family or other reasons, work only in the morning. Michael Green, the then controller of Radio 4, made his decision the previous year and considered the elimination of the programme title. &quot;Weekend Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; is broadcast on Saturday afternoons at 4pm, features highlights of the previous week introduced by one of the presenters and lasts almost an hour. Additionally, episodes are made available as a podcast following the broadcast of each programme.

==Music==
In its earlier years, it used a variety of popular light classics as signature tunes, including such pieces as H. Elliott-Smith&#x27;s &quot;Wanderlust (Waltz)&quot;, Anthony Collins&#x27; &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, and the lively Overture from Gabriel Fauré&#x27;s &quot;Masques et Bergamasques.&quot; From the early 1970s, specially composed pieces were used, several of which were provided by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop.

There is also a band called Woman&#x27;s Hour, based in the UK and signed to the record label Secretly Canadian, who took their name from the radio show.

==Controversies==
===Breach of BBC impartiality rules===
A listener complained about the 1 October 2018, edition of &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot;, which featured an item discussing the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the US Supreme Court. The feature included an interview with a law professor who had worked with Anita Hill, in her pursuit of a sexual harassment complaint against an earlier nominee, Judge Clarence Thomas. The listener believed that allusions to the earlier case were immaterial and prejudicial, that the selection of interviewee was biased, and that presenter Jane Garvey had expressed her personal view on a controversial topic.

The BBC Executive Complaints Unit partially upheld the listener&#x27;s complaint, stating that Garvey gave the impression of sympathising with the interviewee&#x27;s viewpoint, and &quot;did not challenge the interviewee in a manner which would have ensured due impartiality&quot;. As a result, the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; team and production staff attended a briefing on impartiality.

===Sinead O&#x27;Connor===
In 2021 Emma Barnett interviewed Sinéad O&#x27;Connor on &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot;, during which Barnett mentioned a recent comment by a music critic referring to O&#x27;Connor as &quot;the crazy woman in pop&#x27;s attic&quot;. O&#x27;Connor felt that bringing this up was &quot;unnecessary and hurtful&quot;. The interview prompted O&#x27;Connor to announce she was quitting music, though she later retracted this, stating that Barnett had been to blame:

==Feminism==
Former &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; presenter Jenni Murray is president of the Fawcett Society and a former patron of the charity Women&#x27;s Aid.

In April 2014, Radio 4&#x27;s Roger Bolton noted on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Feedback&quot; Blog: &quot;As you well know BBC programmes are supposed to be impartial but I&#x27;m not sure if that can be said of &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot;, at least when it comes to feminism. &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; is in fact a powerful advocate for women&#x27;s empowerment and this week as part of that campaign it produced its second power list.&quot;

<doc id="504689" wikidata="Q238902" url="?curid=504689" title="Volontaires station">
<text>Volontaires () is a station on line 12 of the Paris Métro located in the 15th arrondissement. The station is named after the nearby &quot;rue des Volontaires&quot;. In 1822, locals transformed an existing dead end into an alley that led to rue de Vaugirard, hence, its initial name of &quot;Ruelle Volontaire&quot;, with the &quot;s&quot; added later to pay homage to the soldiers of the French Revolution.

== History ==

The station opened on 5 November 1910 as part of the original section of the Nord-Sud Company&#x27;s line A between Porte de Versailles and Notre-Dame-de-Lorette. On 27 March 1931, line A became line 12 when It was taken over by the Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain de Paris (CMP), incorporating it into the Paris Métro.

From the 1950s, like most stations along the line, the platforms were modernised with the installation of red metal casings and golden advertising frames on the walls until 2015, when it was removed as part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; programme by the RATP. It consisted of modernising the platforms by improving lighting, signages, as well as returning the characteristic beveled white tiles of the Paris métro to the station, thereby restoring the platforms to its original &quot;Nord-Sud&quot; decoration, while the station remained open. The new tiles were installed by May 2018, with all work completed by March 2019 after several delays and technical difficulties.

In 2019, the station was used by 2,362,771 passengers, making it the 219th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 1,111,705 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 232nd busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 1,734,848 passengers, making it the 203rd busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

On 7 April 2022, the RATP and in partnership with the Blomet Paradiso association, unveiled a new cultural panel along the corridors of the station. It details the rich artistic history of the district, often attributable to the Bal Blomet, a historic cabaret of the Roaring Twenties in Montparnasse that Joséphine Baker, Simone de Beauvoir, and Ernest Hemingway frequented.

== Passenger services ==

=== Access ===
The station has a single access at rue de Vaugirard. Unusually, it consists of an entrance and an exit both located within the same building at the corner of &quot;rue de Vaugirard&quot; and &quot;rue des Volontaires&quot;, a rare occurrence on the network. The entrance is along &quot;rue de Vaugirard&quot; whereas the exit is along &quot;rue des Volontaires&quot;.

=== Station layout ===
=== Platforms ===
The station has a standard configuration with 2 tracks surrounded by 2 side platforms. The lower portion of the side walls are vertical instead of elliptical, as are the other stations constructed by the Nord-Sud company (today on lines 12 and 13). It is distinguished by the presence of niches along the entire length of the side walls, hence, are devoid of advertisements.

=== Other connections ===
The station is also served by lines 39, 70, and 89 of the RATP bus network, and at night, by lines N13 and N62 of the Noctilien bus network.

<doc id="504690" wikidata="Q479003" url="?curid=504690" title="Oranjeboom Brewery">
<text>The Oranjeboom Brewery () was founded in Rotterdam in 1671. The brewery there closed in 1990, with production shifted to Breda. That brewery was sold to Interbrew in 1995 and was closed in 2004 by InBev, Interbrew&#x27;s successor. Production of the brand Oranjeboom was moved to the Dommelsch brewery. In October 2013, Oranjeboom was relaunched as a &quot;quirky&quot; new European style lager.

==History==
The brewery dates from 1671, and started with the merger of two Rotterdam breweries, De Dissel and van den Oranjeboom; it was originally housed on the Coolvest, in the center of town.

Late 19th-century developments in the Dutch brewing industry all involved the then-new process of brewing lager, which used a yeast with the capability of cool fermenting; this allowed for production year-round, but required significant investments in modern technology and cold storage. In 1872, the brewery was owned by Willem Baartz, who was looking to get into the lager market. Baartz approached Gerard Adriaan Heineken but instead got involved in a new venture that led to the founding of Heineken&#x27;s Bierbrouwerij Maatschappij. By 1882, Oranjeboom had been sold on to the (Protestant) brewing company &quot;De Gekroonde Valk&quot;, one of the first breweries in the Netherlands to brew lager. In 1885, a brand-new brewery was opened on Oranjeboomstraat in the Feijenoord district, then a new development south of the city. The city named the street after the brewery, which, around the turn of the century, was an important employer providing over 200 jobs, and one of the largest breweries in the country. After World War II, several other breweries were bought to meet demand and stay competitive: De Wereld (Raamsdonk, 1948), Wertha (Weert, 1960), Zuidhollandse Bierbrouwerij (The Hague, 1960), Phoenix (Amersfoort, 1961), and Barbarossa (Groningen, 1964). None of these breweries remain.

In 1967, Oranjeboom was taken over by UK company Allied Breweries, which made an important acquisition in 1968 when it bought the brewery De Drie Hoefijzers in Breda, a town with a long history of beer brewing. The Breda brewery took on the name Oranjeboom. In 1973, the brand Oranjeboom was replaced by Skol, which was deemed to be a more attractive name for the European market, but it was a failure, and the brand name Oranjeboom was reintroduced in 1982. The plant in Rotterdam was closed in 1990, and in 1995, the Breda brewery was sold to Belgian beer giant Interbrew, which modernized the plant, but poor results in 2001 led to the plant&#x27;s closure in 2004, (with a loss of 335 jobs), with production moved to Belgium and to the (Dutch) Dommelsch Brewery.

==Ownership==

With the exception of the Benelux area, the tradename Oranjeboom is owned by United Dutch Breweries. It was previously owned by Allied Breweries of the UK.

==Beers==

The Oranjeboom brewery mainly produced Oranjeboom pils and other lagers, and also Trio Stout. Oranjeboom Breweries were also the manufacturers of the popular Dutch Gold beer, which is one of the best-selling lager beers in retail around the Republic of Ireland.

The main beer produced under the brand name is Oranjeboom Premium Pilsner - a 5% ABV lager. There is also an Extra Strong 8.5% ABV version, a Super Strong 12.0% ABV version as well as lower strength and alcohol-free versions and a bokbier sold under the brand name.

===International versions===

* The lager was brewed in Faversham, UK under license by Shepherd Neame at a strength of 3.9%.
* Oranjeboom pilsener brewed in Germany is labeled for US sales and exported to the US.
* A high percentage Oranjeboom has been imported to the UK, in 500 ml cans at 8.5% ABV
* In New Zealand, Oranjeboom has been brewed under license by Lion Nathan since 2005.
* A variant known as &quot;Premium Strong Beer&quot; is brewed in France for export. It has a high alcohol content of 16% ABV and is labelled &quot;imported mega strong&quot;.

<text>Vaugirard () is a station on line 12 of the Paris Métro in the 15th arrondissement.

It is named after the nearby rue de Vaugirard, which in turn was named after the former &quot;Place de Vaugirard&quot;, renamed to &quot;Place Adolphe Chérioux&quot; in 1935. The station&#x27;s name is subtitled &quot;Adolphe Chérioux&quot; (1857-1934), a former mayor of the district. This street also lent its name to &quot;Vaugirard&quot; on line 4, which was renamed Saint-Placide on 15 November 1913 to prevent confusion.

The station is unusual in that it contains two shops (a newsagent and clothes store) even though it is not an interchange station.

== History ==
The station opened on 5 November 1910 as part of the original section of the Nord-Sud Company&#x27;s line A between Porte de Versailles and Notre-Dame-de-Lorette. On 27 March 1931, line A became line 12 when It was taken over by the Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain de Paris (CMP), incorporating it into the Paris Métro.

Like most stations along the line, the platforms were modernised with the installation of green metal casings on the walls from the 1950s, subsequently repainted in red.

In 2019, the station was used by 3,445,009 passengers, making it the 141st busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 1,709,593 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 145th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 2,482,886 passengers, making it the 136th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

== Passenger services ==

=== Access ===
The station has 3 accesses:

* Access 1: Place Adolphe Chérioux (with an ascending escalator)
* Access 2: rue d&#x27;Alleray
* Access 3: rue des Favorites

=== Station layout ===
=== Platforms ===
The station has a standard configuration with 2 tracks surrounded by 2 side platforms. The lower portion of the side walls are vertical instead of elliptical, as are the other stations constructed by the Nord-Sud company (today on lines 12 and 13).

Unlike many other stations on the line, its characteristic Nord-Sud tiling has disappeared: its vault simply painted white and the side walls covered with a metal casing.

=== Other connections ===
The station is also served by lines 39, 70, 80, and 88 of the RATP bus network, as well as the &quot;Traverse Brancion-Commerce&quot;, an electric bus operated by BE Green from parc Georges Brassens to the Pasteur Institute. At night, it is served by lines N13 and N62 of the Noctilien bus network.

<text>Porte de Versailles () is a station on line 12 of the Paris Métro, a stop on tramway T3a as well as the southern terminus of tramway T2 in the 15th arrondissement. It is named after the &quot;Porte de Versailles&quot;, a gate in the 19th century Thiers wall of Paris, which led to the city of Versailles.

==History==
The station opened on 5 November 1910 as part of the original section of the Nord-Sud Company&#x27;s line A between Porte de Versailles and Notre-Dame-de-Lorette.

On 23 April 1930, a collision between two trains near the station resulted in the deaths of two people and 37 injured. A northbound train parked in front of a red signal between &quot;Porte de Versailles&quot; and Convention was hit in the rear by another train that had passed two stop signals at full speed.

In anticipation of its extension south to Mairie d&#x27;Issy, the station was relocated south of its original location on 31 December 1929. The old platforms were removed and additional sidings to store trains were installed in its place. The tiling on the vault are the only remaining remnants of the original station; it can still be seen on passing trains. The new station was operated by the Nord-Sud Company for a single day as it was absorbed by its competitor, the Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain de Paris (CMP) the next day. Hence, the station was decorated in the traditional Nord-Sud style. On 27 March 1931, line A was renamed line 12. On 24 March 1934, the line&#x27;s extension to &quot;Mairie d&#x27;Issy&quot; opened, ending the station&#x27;s role as the southern terminus of the line.

On 10 January 1963, a second collision occurred near the station, injuring around 40 people.

As part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; programme by the RATP, the station&#x27;s corridors were renovated and modernised on 18 December 2009.

Since 2016, the Vaugirard Workshops, used for the maintenance of trains on line 12 just north of the station, has been under renovation as part of memorandum of understanding between the RATP and the city of Paris. It includes the construction of a new equipment maintenance workshop (EMW), the restructuring of its train maintenance workshop (TMW), as well as the creation of new social and private housing in two phases on a 2.3-hectare site. The new mixed-used development due for completion by 2029.

In 2019, the station was used by 5,923,995 passengers, making it the 65th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 2,449,859 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 89th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 3,268,157 passengers, making it the 93rd busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

== Passenger services ==

=== Access ===
The station has 5 accesses:

* Access 1: avenue Ernest Renan &quot;Parc des Expositions Halls 2 à 8&quot;
* Access 2: Palais des Sports &quot;Parc des Expositions Halls 1&quot;
* Access 3: rue de Vaugirard
* Access 4: Boulevard Victor
* Access 5: Boulevard Lefebvre

===Station layout===
=== Platforms ===
The station has a particular arrangement specific to the stations serving or had served as a terminus. It has 3 tracks divided amongst 1 island platform and 1 side platform. The two platforms are offset from each other by about 40 metres and are separated by a wall. Trains towards &quot;Mairie d&#x27;Aubervilliers&quot; utilise the southern track (on the side platform) whereas trains towards &quot;Mairie d&#x27;Issy&quot; utilise the central track (on the island platform). The yard track is not used in regular service and is normally used as a siding to store trains. However, it is occasionally used to terminate trains from Mairie d&#x27;Aubervilliers on weekend evenings; passengers who are heading towards &quot;Mairie d&#x27;Issy&quot; will have to wait for the next train.

=== Other connections ===

==== Tramway ====
The station has been served by tramway T3a since 16 December 2006 (as part of its initial section between Pont du Garigliano and Porte d&#x27;Ivry) and by tramway T2 since 21 November 2009 (when it was extended from Issy – Val de Seine), serving as its southern terminus. The tram station&#x27;s name subtitle is shortened to &quot;Parc des Expositions&quot;. It is one of four métro stations on the network that are located at one of the former gates of Paris and are served by two tram lines; the other three are Balard (line 8), Porte de Choisy (line 7), and Porte de Vincennes (line 1). Basilique de Saint-Denis (line 13) is the only station served by two tram lines not located at one of the gates of Paris.

<text>Corentin Celton () is a station on line 12 of the Paris Métro in the commune of Issy-les-Moulineaux.

== History ==
The station opened as &quot;Petits Ménages&quot; on 24 March 1934 as part of the extension of the line from Porte de Versailles. It was then named after the nearby &quot;hospice des Petits-ménage&quot;, a retirement home for elderly couples, as well as widowers and widowers capable of paying a modest fee. The hospice was relocated from the 7th arrondissement of Paris to Issy-les-Moulineaux in 1863, leaving a large area for the expansion of Le Bon Marché department store.

On 15 October 1945, the station was renamed &quot;Corentin Celton&quot;, after the hospice was renamed &quot;Hôpital Corentin-Celton&quot; in February that year. Its namesake, &quot;Corentin Celton&quot; (1901–1943), was an employee there and was a member of the French Resistance; he was shot by the Nazis at Fort Mont-Valérien. Hence, the station, along with 7 other stations, were renamed after the Second World War to honour the resistance fighters who had died for France. The other stations were: Charles Michels, Colonel Fabien, Corentin Cariou, Guy Môquet, Jacques Bonsergent, Marx Dormoy, and Trinité - d&#x27;Estienne d&#x27;Orves.

As part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; programme by the RATP, the station&#x27;s corridors and platform lighting were renovated and modernised during the 2000s.

In 2019, the station was used by 3,438,335 passengers, making it the 144th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 1,774,654 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 138th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 2,504,682 passengers, making it the 134th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

<doc id="504697" wikidata="Q4724022" url="?curid=504697" title="Algebraic torus">
<text>In mathematics, an algebraic torus, where a one dimensional torus is typically denoted by formula_1, formula_2, or formula_3, is a type of commutative affine algebraic group commonly found in projective algebraic geometry and toric geometry. Higher dimensional algebraic tori can be modelled as a product of algebraic groups formula_1. These groups were named by analogy with the theory of &quot;tori&quot; in Lie group theory (see Cartan subgroup). For example, over the complex numbers formula_5 the algebraic torus formula_1 is isomorphic to the group scheme formula_7, which is the scheme theoretic analogue of the Lie group formula_8. In fact, any formula_1-action on a complex vector space can be pulled back to a formula_10-action from the inclusion formula_11 as real manifolds.

Tori are of fundamental importance in the theory of algebraic groups and Lie groups and in the study of the geometric objects associated to them such as symmetric spaces and buildings.

== Algebraic tori over fields ==

In most places we suppose that the base field is perfect (for example finite or characteristic zero). This hypothesis is required to have a smooth group schemepg 64, since for an algebraic group formula_12 to be smooth over characteristic formula_13, the mapsformula_14 must be geometrically reduced for large enough formula_15, meaning the image of the corresponding map on formula_12 is smooth for large enough formula_15. 

In general one has to use separable closures instead of algebraic closures.

=== Multiplicative group of a field ===
If formula_18 is a field then the &quot;multiplicative group&quot; over formula_18 is the algebraic group formula_1 such that for any field extension formula_21 the formula_22-points are isomorphic to the group formula_23. To define it properly as an algebraic group one can take the affine variety defined by the equation formula_24 in the affine plane over formula_18 with coordinates formula_26. The multiplication is then given by restricting the regular rational map formula_27 defined by formula_28 and the inverse is the restriction of the regular rational map formula_29.

=== Definition ===

Let formula_18 be a field with algebraic closure formula_31. Then a &quot;formula_18-torus&quot; is an algebraic group defined over formula_18 which is isomorphic over formula_31 to a finite product of copies of the multiplicative group.

In other words, if formula_35 is an formula_18-group it is a torus if and only if formula_37 for some formula_38. The basic terminology associated to tori is as follows.

*The integer formula_15 is called the &quot;rank&quot; or &quot;absolute rank&quot; of the torus formula_40.
*The torus is said to be &quot;split&quot; over a field extension formula_21 if formula_42. There is a unique minimal finite extension of formula_43 over which formula_35 is split, which is called the &quot;splitting field&quot; of formula_35.
*The &quot;formula_18-rank&quot; of formula_35 is the maximal rank of a split sub-torus of formula_35. A torus is split if and only if its formula_18-rank equals its absolute rank.
*A torus is said to be &quot;anisotropic&quot; if its formula_43-rank is zero.

=== Isogenies ===

An isogeny between algebraic groups is a surjective morphism with finite kernel; two tori are said to be &quot;isogenous&quot; if there exists an isogeny from the first to the second. Isogenies between tori are particularly well-behaved: for any isogeny formula_51 there exists a &quot;dual&quot; isogeny formula_52 such that formula_53 is a power map. In particular being isogenous is an equivalence relation between tori.

=== Examples ===

==== Over an algebraically closed field ====
Over any algebraically closed field formula_54 there is up to isomorphism a unique torus of any given rank. For a rank formula_55 algebraic torus over formula_56 this is given by the group scheme formula_57pg 230.

==== Over the real numbers ====
Over the field of real numbers formula_58 there are exactly (up to isomorphism) two tori of rank 1:
*the split torus formula_59
*the compact form, which can be realised as the unitary group formula_60 or as the special orthogonal group formula_61. It is an anisotropic torus. As a Lie group, it is also isomorphic to the 1-torus formula_62, which explains the picture of diagonalisable algebraic groups as tori.
Any real torus is isogenous to a finite sum of those two; for example the real torus formula_63 is doubly covered by (but not isomorphic to) formula_64. This gives an example of isogenous, non-isomorphic tori.

==== Over a finite field ====
Over the finite field formula_65 there are two rank-1 tori: the split one, of cardinality formula_66, and the anisotropic one of cardinality formula_67. The latter can be realised as the matrix group
formula_68

More generally, if formula_21 is a finite field extension of degree formula_70 then the Weil restriction from formula_22 to formula_18 of the multiplicative group of formula_22 is an formula_18-torus of rank formula_70 and formula_18-rank 1 (note that restriction of scalars over an inseparable field extension will yield a commutative algebraic group that is not a torus). The kernel formula_77 of its field norm is also a torus, which is anisotropic and of rank formula_78. Any formula_18-torus of rank one is either split or isomorphic to the kernel of the norm of a quadratic extension. The two examples above are special cases of this: the compact real torus is the kernel of the field norm of formula_80 and the anisotropic torus over formula_65 is the kernel of the field norm of formula_82.

== Weights and coweights ==

Over a separably closed field, a torus &quot;T&quot; admits two primary invariants. The weight lattice formula_83 is the group of algebraic homomorphisms &quot;T&quot; → Gm, and the coweight lattice formula_84 is the group of algebraic homomorphisms Gm → &quot;T&quot;. These are both free abelian groups whose rank is that of the torus, and they have a canonical nondegenerate pairing formula_85 given by formula_86, where degree is the number &quot;n&quot; such that the composition is equal to the &quot;n&quot;th power map on the multiplicative group. The functor given by taking weights is an antiequivalence of categories between tori and free abelian groups, and the coweight functor is an equivalence. In particular, maps of tori are characterized by linear transformations on weights or coweights, and the automorphism group of a torus is a general linear group over Z. The quasi-inverse of the weights functor is given by a dualization functor from free abelian groups to tori, defined by its functor of points as:

:formula_87

This equivalence can be generalized to pass between groups of multiplicative type (a distinguished class of formal groups) and arbitrary abelian groups, and such a generalization can be convenient if one wants to work in a well-behaved category, since the category of tori doesn&#x27;t have kernels or filtered colimits.

When a field &quot;K&quot; is not separably closed, the weight and coweight lattices of a torus over &quot;K&quot; are defined as the respective lattices over the separable closure. This induces canonical continuous actions of the absolute Galois group of &quot;K&quot; on the lattices. The weights and coweights that are fixed by this action are precisely the maps that are defined over &quot;K&quot;. The functor of taking weights is an antiequivalence between the category of tori over &quot;K&quot; with algebraic homomorphisms and the category of finitely generated torsion free abelian groups with an action of the absolute Galois group of &quot;K&quot;.

Given a finite separable field extension &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; and a torus &quot;T&quot; over &quot;L&quot;, we have a Galois module isomorphism

:formula_88

If &quot;T&quot; is the multiplicative group, then this gives the restriction of scalars a permutation module structure. Tori whose weight lattices are permutation modules for the Galois group are called quasi-split, and all quasi-split tori are finite products of restrictions of scalars.

== Tori in semisimple groups ==

=== Linear representations of tori ===

As seen in the examples above tori can be represented as linear groups. An alternative definition for tori is:

:&quot;A linear algebraic group is a torus if and only if it is diagonalisable over an algebraic closure. &quot;

The torus is split over a field if and only if it is diagonalisable over this field.

=== Split rank of a semisimple group ===

If formula_89 is a semisimple algebraic group over a field formula_18 then:
*its &quot;rank&quot; (or &quot;absolute rank&quot;) is the rank of a maximal torus subgroup in formula_89 (note that all maximal tori are conjugated over formula_18 so the rank is well-defined); 
*its &quot;formula_18-rank&quot; (sometimes called &quot;formula_18-split rank&quot;) is the maximal rank of a torus subgroup in formula_12 which is split over formula_18. 
Obviously the rank is greater than or equal the formula_18-rank; the group is called &quot;split&quot; if and only if equality holds (that is, there is a maximal torus in formula_89 which is split over formula_18). The group is called &quot;anisotropic&quot; if it contains no split tori (i.e. its formula_18-rank is zero).

=== Classification of semisimple groups ===
In the classical theory of semisimple Lie algebras over the complex field the Cartan subalgebras play a fundamental rôle in the classification via root systems and Dynkin diagrams. This classification is equivalent to that of connected algebraic groups over the complex field, and Cartan subalgebras correspond to maximal tori in these. In fact the classification carries over to the case of an arbitrary base field under the assumption that there exists a split maximal torus (which is automatically satisfied over an algebraically closed field). Without the splitness assumption things become much more complicated and a more detailed theory has to be developed, which is still based in part on the study of adjoint actions of tori.

If formula_35 is a maximal torus in a semisimple algebraic group formula_89 then over the algebraic closure it gives rise to a root system formula_103 in the vector space formula_104. On the other hand, if formula_105 is a maximal formula_18-split torus its action on the formula_18-Lie algebra of formula_89 gives rise to another root system formula_109. The restriction map formula_110 induces a map formula_111 and the Tits index is a way to encode the properties of this map and of the action of the Galois group of formula_112 on formula_103. The Tits index is a &quot;relative&quot; version of the &quot;absolute&quot; Dynkin diagram associated to formula_103; obviously, only finitely many Tits indices can correspond to a given Dynkin diagram.

Another invariant associated to the split torus formula_115 is the &quot;anisotropic kernel&quot;: this is the semisimple algebraic group obtained as the derived subgroup of the centraliser of formula_115 in formula_89 (the latter is only a reductive group). As its name indicates it is an anisotropic group, and its absolute type is uniquely determined by formula_109.

The first step towards a classification is then the following theorem

:&quot;Two semisimple formula_18-algebraic groups are isomorphic if and only if they have the same Tits indices and isomorphic anisotropic kernels. &quot;

This reduces the classification problem to anisotropic groups, and to determining which Tits indices can occur for a given Dynkin diagram. The latter problem has been solved in . The former is related to the Galois cohomology groups of formula_18. More precisely to each Tits index there is associated a unique quasi-split group over formula_18; then every formula_18-group with the same index is an inner form of this quasi-split group, and those are classified by the Galois cohomology of formula_18 with coefficients in the adjoint group.

== Tori and geometry ==

=== Flat subspaces and rank of symmetric spaces ===

If formula_12 is a semisimple Lie group then its real rank is the formula_58-rank as defined above (for any formula_58-algebraic group whose group of real points is isomorphic to formula_12), in other words the maximal formula_15 such that there exists an embedding formula_129. For example, the real rank of formula_130 is equal to formula_131, and the real rank of formula_132 is equal to formula_133.

If formula_134 is the symmetric space associated to formula_12 and formula_136 is a maximal split torus then there exists a unique orbit of formula_137 in formula_134 which is a totally geodesic flat subspace in formula_134. It is in fact a maximal flat subspace and all maximal such are obtained as orbits of split tori in this way. Thus there is a geometric definition of the real rank, as the maximal dimension of a flat subspace in formula_134.

=== Q-rank of lattices ===

If the Lie group formula_12 is obtained as the real points of an algebraic group formula_89 over the rational field formula_143 then the formula_143-rank of formula_89 has also a geometric significance. To get to it one has to introduce an arithmetic group formula_146 associated to formula_147, which roughly is the group of integer points of formula_89, and the quotient space formula_149, which is a Riemannian orbifold and hence a metric space. Then any asymptotic cone of formula_150 is homeomorphic to a finite simplicial complex with top-dimensional simplices of dimension equal to the formula_143-rank of formula_89. In particular, formula_150 is compact if and only if formula_89 is anisotropic.

Note that this allows to define the formula_155-rank of any lattice in a semisimple Lie group, as the dimension of its asymptotic cone.

=== Buildings ===
If formula_89 is a semisimple group over formula_157 the maximal split tori in formula_89 correspond to the apartments of the Bruhat-Tits building formula_134 associated to formula_89. In particular the dimension of formula_134 is equal to the formula_162-rank of formula_89.

== Algebraic tori over an arbitrary base scheme ==

=== Definition ===

Given a base scheme &quot;S&quot;, an algebraic torus over &quot;S&quot; is defined to be a group scheme over &quot;S&quot; that is fpqc locally isomorphic to a finite product of copies of the multiplicative group scheme G&quot;m&quot;/&quot;S&quot; over &quot;S&quot;. In other words, there exists a faithfully flat map &quot;X&quot; → &quot;S&quot; such that any point in &quot;X&quot; has a quasi-compact open neighborhood &quot;U&quot; whose image is an open affine subscheme of &quot;S&quot;, such that base change to &quot;U&quot; yields a finite product of copies of &quot;GL&quot;1,&quot;U&quot; = G&quot;m&quot;/&quot;U&quot;. One particularly important case is when &quot;S&quot; is the spectrum of a field &quot;K&quot;, making a torus over &quot;S&quot; an algebraic group whose extension to some finite separable extension &quot;L&quot; is a finite product of copies of G&quot;m&quot;/&quot;L&quot;. In general, the multiplicity of this product (i.e., the dimension of the scheme) is called the rank of the torus, and it is a locally constant function on &quot;S&quot;.

Most notions defined for tori over fields carry to this more general setting.

==== Examples ====
One common example of an algebraic torus is to consider the affine cone formula_164 of a projective scheme formula_165. Then, with the origin removed, the induced projection map formula_166 gives the structure of an algebraic torus over formula_134.

=== Weights ===

For a general base scheme &quot;S&quot;, weights and coweights are defined as fpqc sheaves of free abelian groups on &quot;S&quot;. These provide representations of fundamental groupoids of the base with respect the fpqc topology. If the torus is locally trivializable with respect to a weaker topology such as the etale topology, then the sheaves of groups descend to the same topologies and these representations factor through the respective quotient groupoids. In particular, an etale sheaf gives rise to a quasi-isotrivial torus, and if &quot;S&quot; is locally noetherian and normal (more generally, geometrically unibranched), the torus is isotrivial. As a partial converse, a theorem of Grothendieck asserts that any torus of finite type is quasi-isotrivial, i.e., split by an etale surjection.

Given a rank &quot;n&quot; torus &quot;T&quot; over &quot;S&quot;, a twisted form is a torus over &quot;S&quot; for which there exists a fpqc covering of &quot;S&quot; for which their base extensions are isomorphic, i.e., it is a torus of the same rank. Isomorphism classes of twisted forms of a split torus are parametrized by nonabelian flat cohomology formula_168, where the coefficient group forms a constant sheaf. In particular, twisted forms of a split torus &quot;T&quot; over a field &quot;K&quot; are parametrized by elements of the Galois cohomology pointed set formula_169 with trivial Galois action on the coefficients. In the one-dimensional case, the coefficients form a group of order two, and isomorphism classes of twisted forms of Gm are in natural bijection with separable quadratic extensions of &quot;K&quot;.

Since taking a weight lattice is an equivalence of categories, short exact sequences of tori correspond to short exact sequences of the corresponding weight lattices. In particular, extensions of tori are classified by Ext1 sheaves. These are naturally isomorphic to the flat cohomology groups formula_170. Over a field, the extensions are parametrized by elements of the corresponding Galois cohomology group.

==Arithmetic invariants==

In his work on Tamagawa numbers, T. Ono introduced a type of functorial invariants of tori over finite separable extensions of a chosen field &quot;k&quot;. Such an invariant is a collection of positive real-valued functions &quot;f&quot;K on isomorphism classes of tori over &quot;K&quot;, as &quot;K&quot; runs over finite separable extensions of &quot;k&quot;, satisfying three properties:
# Multiplicativity: Given two tori &quot;T&quot;1 and &quot;T&quot;2 over &quot;K&quot;, &quot;f&quot;K(&quot;T&quot;1 × &quot;T&quot;2) = &quot;f&quot;K(&quot;T&quot;1) &quot;f&quot;K(&quot;T&quot;2)
# Restriction: For a finite separable extension &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot;, &quot;f&quot;L evaluated on an &quot;L&quot; torus is equal to &quot;f&quot;K evaluated on its restriction of scalars to &quot;K&quot;.
# Projective triviality: If &quot;T&quot; is a torus over &quot;K&quot; whose weight lattice is a projective Galois module, then &quot;f&quot;K(&quot;T&quot;) = 1.

T. Ono showed that the Tamagawa number of a torus over a number field is such an invariant. Furthermore, he showed that it is a quotient of two cohomological invariants, namely the order of the group formula_171 (sometimes mistakenly called the Picard group of &quot;T&quot;, although it doesn&#x27;t classify Gm torsors over &quot;T&quot;), and the order of the Tate–Shafarevich group.

The notion of invariant given above generalizes naturally to tori over arbitrary base schemes, with functions taking values in more general rings. While the order of the extension group is a general invariant, the other two invariants above do not seem to have interesting analogues outside the realm of fraction fields of one-dimensional domains and their completions.

<doc id="504698" wikidata="Q1783803" url="?curid=504698" title="Saint-Denis-Université station">
<text>Saint-Denis–Université () is the terminus of the northeastern branch of Line 13 of the Paris Métro, located in the suburban town of Saint-Denis. It is the most northerly station on the Paris Métro system. It serves the University of Paris 8 Vincennes-Saint-Denis, as well as the new facility of the National Archives, which is located in Pierrefitte-sur-Seine, next to the metro station and bus station.

==History==
The station and a bus station was opened on 25 May 1998 in the presence of the Minister of Transport Jean-Claude Gayssot after an investment of €525 million (70% financed by the Region) with the extension of the line from Basilique de Saint-Denis.

Initially planned for 1999, a carpark with 300 spaces was inaugurated in September 2001 in the presence of elected officials and the regional prefect, because it was meant to foreshadow Île-de-France&#x27;s future intermodal transport facilities for its urban transport plan.

The name of the station comes from its immediate proximity to the University of Paris-VIII in Saint-Denis. In 2004, the government chose the site for the new headquarters of the National Archives. Scheduled for 2009, the opening took place in 2013.

In 2020, with the Covid-19 crisis, 2,626,602 travellers entered this station, which places it in the 72nd position of metro stations for its use.

==Passenger services==
As with all new metro stations since 1992, the station is fully accessible.

===Access===
One exit from the station faces the University of Paris VIII and the other overlooks the bus station.

===Station layout===
===Platforms===
The two platforms, flanking the two tracks, are covered by a slab below a large reception hall. There is therefore no intermediate level between the surface and the platforms, a very unusual situation for the Paris metro.

The platforms are in the shape of an &quot;I&quot;, as at the Basilique de Saint-Denis station, wide at both ends, business premises reduce their width in the centre. The tracks extends beyond the line open to the public, towards a turning point and sidings.

===Other connections===
The bus station is served by lines 168, 253, 255, 256, 268, 353 and 356 of the RATP Bus Network and by line 11 of the CIF bus network. Since 29 July 2013, it is possible to reach the T5 at the Guynemer station, located a short distance away.

At night, a connection with the N44 line of the Noctilien is possible a short distance away.

On 5 November 2015, the station benefited from the first secure lockers for bicycles (52 places) (Véligo) on line 13 at 30 € per year.

==Nearby==
* Université Paris-VIII
* Archives Nationales
* Église Sainte-Jeanne d&#x27;Arc de la Mutualité

==Line 13 extension project==
A subsequent extension of line 13 to the &quot;Stains-La Cerisaie&quot; station, included in the master plan for the Île-de-France region (SDRIF), adopted in 2008 by its Regional Council, is no longer envisaged. The project no longer appears in the new version of the SDRIF plan adopted on 18 October 2013 and approved by decree of 27 December 2013.

<text>Basilique de Saint-Denis () is a Paris Métro station on line 13 in the town centre of Saint-Denis, north of Paris. It connects with tram line 1 at two nearby stops at &quot;Basilique de Saint-Denis&quot; and &quot;Marché de Saint-Denis&quot;.

==History==
The station opened on 26 May 1976 when the line was extended from Carrefour Pleyel. It was the northern terminus of the northern branch of the line until 25 May 1998 when it was extended to Saint-Denis - Université. It is named after the nearby basilica. However, the display of the new name in the station itself was not changed until later. It bears the subtitle Hôtel de Ville because it is located near the town hall of Saint-Denis. On 21 December 1992 tram line T1 opened. Since 2012, its platforms have been fitted with landing doors.

In 2015-2016, the station was the subject of major modernization works with the holding of the 2016 European Football Championship. The escalators, the ticket office and the automatic ticketing machines were renewed, the lighting of the facades on the platforms, old tiling removed and waterproofing of the station redone.

In 2020, with the Covid-19 crisis, 2,616,421 travellers entered this station, which places it at the 76th position of metro stations for its use.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station offers two entrances.
* exit 1 - &quot;Passage de l&#x27;Aqueduc&quot; (gives access to the town hall of Saint-Denis), opens at the foot of the L&#x27;Écran cinema and leads to a connection with the tram T5 (stop &quot;Marché de Saint-Denis&quot;);
* exit 2 - &quot;Place du Caquet&quot;, which opens at the foot of the Basilica shopping centre and leads to a connection with the tram T1.

The 2018 renovation kept the escalator, which accessed the ticket room on the platform towards &quot;Saint-Denis-University&quot; but did not add a descending escalator on the other platform.

===Station layout===
===Platforms===
Basilique de Saint-Denis is a standard configuration station with two platforms separated by metro tracks. They have a cultural decoration, in order to reflect the prestigious neighbourhood of the basilica and the historical character of Saint-Denis.

From 2015 to 2018, the station was renovated and its decoration modernised. The walls of the platforms were renewed using large-format bevelled earthenware tiles. The old marble-looking columns were revised with religious scenography and stained-glass windows imitating windows of the basilica-cathedral and highlighted by paving stones, fitted with light-emitting diodes (LEDs).

===Other connections===
Since 1992, a connection with the T1 tram has made it possible to reach, among other things, Saint-Denis station and the eastern part of downtown Saint-Denis.

The station is also served by lines 153, 239 (nearby) and 253 of the RATP Bus Network.

At a short distance (&quot;Cité Langevin&quot; stop), a connection is possible with line 255 of the RATP Bus Network, with line 11 of the CIF bus network (&quot;Marché de Saint-Denis&quot; stop) and, at night, with line N44 of the Noctilien bus network. Likewise, since 29 July 2013, travellers can join the T5 tram at the aforementioned stop.

==Nearby==
* Saint-Denis city hall.
* Saint-Denis basilica, a cathedral built during the 12th century, one of the first in the Gothic cathedrals, containing the necropolis of the Kings of France.
* The house of honour of the Légion d&#x27;honneur and its park.
* Near one of the tram stops are two university schools, for technology and teacher training.
* This part of the town is a dense group of residential buildings, including shops and a commercial centre.

<text>Garibaldi () is a station on line 13 of the Paris Métro in the commune of Saint-Ouen.

==Location==
The station is located under Avenue Gabriel-Péri, south of the beginning of Rue Charles-Schmidt. Oriented approximately along a north–south axis and located on the branch towards &quot;Saint-Denis - Université&quot;, it is positioned between the &quot;Mairie de Saint-Ouen&quot; and &quot;Porte de Saint-Ouen&quot; metro stations.

==History==
The station opened on 30 June 1952 when the line was extended from Porte de Saint-Ouen to Carrefour Pleyel.

It owes its name to its proximity to rue Garibaldi, which pays homage to Giuseppe Garibaldi (1807-1882) who was one of the architects of Italian unification. A staunch republican, desiring Rome as the capital of Italy, he fought against Austria in 1859, the Kingdom of Naples in 1860 and the papacy in 1867. He also served France during the conflict of 1870–1871.

The station is, with &quot;Mairie de Saint-Ouen&quot; and &quot;Carrefour Pleyel&quot; on the same section of the line, one of the last three built in the historic style of the network, characterized by the use of bevelled white tiles and an ovoid-shaped vault, before the appearance of the first &quot;box stations&quot; in the 1970s.

As part of RATP&#x27;s &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; program, the station corridors and platform lighting were renovated on 25 August 2004.

In 2020, with the Covid-19 crisis, 1,697,555 travellers entered this station, which places it in 148th position among metro stations for its use.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has three accesses divided into four metro entrances, opening on either side of Avenue Gabriel-Péri and decorated with balustrades as well as three Dervaux-type candelabra:
* Access 1 &quot;Rue Garibaldi&quot;, consisting of a fixed staircase, located to the right of no. 80 of the avenue;
* Access 2 &quot;Rue Farcot&quot;, also made up of a fixed staircase, located opposite no. 78 of the avenue;
* Access 3 &quot;Rue Charles-Schmidt&quot;, comprising two exits, one in front of the other, to the right of no. 65 bis of the avenue; one consists of a fixed staircase and the other of an escalator ascending from the exit corridor of the platform in the direction of &quot;Saint-Denis - Université&quot;.

===Station layout===
===Platforms===
Garibaldi is a standard configuration station. It has two platforms separated by the metro tracks and the vault is elliptical. The decoration is of the style used for the majority of metro stations. The lighting canopies are white and rounded in the &quot;Gaudin&quot; style of the metro revival of the 2000s, and the bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the walls, the vault, the tunnel exits and the outlets of the corridors. The advertising frames, in copper-coloured earthenware, are topped with the letter &quot;M&quot; (a variant found only in 7 other stations in the network) and the name of the station is also in earthenware in the style of the original CMP. The &quot;Motte&quot; style seats are yellow in colour.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by lines 85, 137, 237 and the urban service L&#x27;Audonienne of the RATP Bus Network and, at night, by lines N14 and N44 of the Noctilien network.

The station had a connection with the Saint-Ouen-les-Docks line, at the Gare de Saint-Ouen-Garibaldi, until the latter closed in 1988.

<text>Porte de Saint-Ouen () is a station on line 13 of the Paris Métro on the border of the 17th and 18th arrondissements. Unusually it has an escalator directly linking the platform to the street at the exit to the Rue Leibniz.

==Location==
The station is located under the northern end of the Avenue de Saint-Ouen, between the Porte and the cutting of the Chemin de fer de Petite Ceinture line. Oriented roughly along a north-south axis and located on the branch towards &quot;Saint-Denis–Université&quot;, it is positioned between the &quot;Garibaldi&quot; and &quot;Guy Môquet&quot; metro stations.

==History==
The station opened on 26 February 1911 as part of the Nord-Sud Company&#x27;s line B from Saint-Lazare to &quot;Porte de Saint-Ouen&quot;. On 27 March 1931, line B became line 13 following the absorption of the Nord-Sud company on 1 January 1930 by its competitor, the Nord-Sud Company (known as CMP). It was the terminus of the northern branch of the line until 30 June 1952 when the line was extended to Carrefour Pleyel. The station is named after the &quot;Porte de Saint-Ouen&quot;, a gate in the nineteenth century Thiers wall of Paris, which led to Saint-Ouen

From the 1950s until 2008, the side walls were clad in metal casing with red horizontal uprights and golden advertising frames. This layout was later supplemented with “shell” seats characteristic of the “Motte” style, in red.

As part of the RATP&#x27;s &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; programme, the station corridors were renovated on 3 June 2005, and then it was the turn of the platforms in 2009, leading to the removal of the bodywork in favour of a restitution of the original &quot;North-South&quot; decoration.

In 2020, with the Covid-19 crisis, 2,060,676 passengers entered this station, which places it in 119th position among metro stations for its attendance.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has three accesses divided into five metro entrances, located on either side of Avenue de Saint-Ouen:
* Access 1 - &quot;Boulevard Bessières&quot; comprising two fixed staircases leading to the right of no. 153 of the avenue, the one furthest at the corner with Boulevard Bessières, decorated with a mast with a yellow &quot;M&quot; inscribed in a circle;
* Access 2 - &quot;Avenue de Saint-Ouen - Hopital Bichat&quot; also comprising two fixed staircases established back-to-back, located opposite no. 154 and 156 of the avenue, the closest to Boulevard Ney is equipped with a yellow “M” mast.
* Access 3 - &quot;Rue Leibniz&quot;, consisting of an ascending escalator allowing only an exit from the platform in the direction of Saint-Denis - University, located to the right of no. 136 of the avenue.

===Station layout===
===Platforms===
Porte de Saint-Ouen is a station with a standard configuration. It has two platforms separated by the metro tracks and the vault is semi-elliptical, a shape specific to the old Nord-Sud Company stations. The tiling and ceramics take up the original decorative style with advertising frames and the surrounds of station name in a green colour (a tint used for terminuses and transfer stations). Green geometric designs are found on the side walls and the vault, while station name inscribed in white earthenware on a small blue background with a green border. Green tile borders surrounds the very large advertising frames. The direction incorporated in the ceramic on the south tunnel exit indicating &quot;Saint-Lazare&quot; was not changed and is kept as it is. Bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the side walls, the vault and the tunnel exits. Lighting is provided by two tube strips and the &quot;Akiko&quot; style seats are cyan in colour.

<text>Guy Môquet () is a station on Line 13 of the Paris Métro. It is located on the border between the 17th arrondissement and 18th arrondissement, on the line&#x27;s northeastern branch.

==Location==
The station is located under Avenue de Saint-Ouen, to the south of the intersection of Rue Guy-Môquet, Rue Championnet, Marcadet, Legendre and Rue de la Jonquière. Oriented approximately along a north-south axis and located on the branch towards Saint-Denis–Université, it is located between the Porte de Saint-Ouen and La Fourche metro stations, the latter marking the beginning of the common branch line of line 13 towards Châtillon - Montrouge metro station.

==History==

The station opened on 26 February 1911 as part of Line B of the Nord-Sud Company, from Saint-Lazare to Porte de Saint-Ouen. Its original name, Carrefour Marcadet (in reference to Rue Marcadet), was changed the year after the opening to Marcadet – Balagny, after Rue Balagny, itself named after Auguste Balagny, who served as the first mayor of the 17th arrondissement of Paris from 1860 until 1870.

On 27 March 1931, line B became line 13 following the absorption of the &quot;Société du Nord-Sud&quot; on 1 January 1930 by its competitor, the Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain de Paris (known as the CMP).

On 27 January 1946, the station was renamed a second time to become Guy Môquet, and at the same time as Rue Balagny, renamed Rue Guy-Môquet in homage to a young French communist activist, shot by the Nazis at the age of seventeen. The station is thus one of the eight in the network to have seen its surname evolve at the end of the World War Two in order to honor the memory of resistance fighters who died for France, with Trinité - d&#x27;Estienne d&#x27;Orves (line 12), Charles Michels (line 10), Colonel Fabien (line 2), Corentin Celton (line 12), Jacques Bonsergent (line 5), Corentin Cariou (line 7) and Marx Dormoy (line 12).

From the 1950s until 2008, the wall were covered with a metallic panels with blue horizontal uprights and illuminated golden advertising frames. This arrangement was supplemented by benches, which were subsequently removed in favor of &quot;shell&quot; seats characteristic of the &quot;Motte&quot; style, in white.

As part of the RATP &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; program, the station corridors were renovated on 16 May 2003, then it was the turn of the platforms in 2009, resulting in the removal of their metal panels in favor of a return of the original &quot;Nord-Sud&quot; decoration.

In 2019, 4,004,960 travelers entered this station, which placed it in the 118th position of metro stations for its use.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has four entrances, all made up of fixed stairs, the first three are decorated with a balustrade and an Adolphe Dervaux candelabra:
* Entrance 1 &quot;Rue Legendre&quot; - opening in front of 79 Avenue de Saint-Ouen and 193 of Rue Legendre;
* Entrance 2 &quot;Rue de la Jonquiere&quot; - located to the right of 73 Rue Guy-Môquet and 1 Rue de la Jonquiere;
* Entrance 3 &quot;Avenue de Saint-Ouen&quot; - located opposite 86 Avenue de Saint-Ouen and 253 Rue Marcadet;
* Entrance 4 &quot;Rue Lamarck&quot; - adorned with an entourage in the characteristic Nord-Sud style, leads to the right of 68 &amp; 70 Avenue de Saint-Ouen.

===Station layout===
===Platform===
 Guy Môquet is a standard configuration station. It has two platforms separated by the metro tracks and the vault is semi-elliptical, a shape specific to the old Nord-South stations. The tiles and ceramics take up the original decoration with advertising frames and the surrounds of the name of the station in brown color with brown geometric designs on the walls and the vault. The station name is inscribed in white earthenware on a blue background in small font above the advertising frames and very large fonts between these frames, as well as the station directions incorporated into the ceramic on the tunnel exits. The bevelled white earthenware tiles cover the walls, the vault and the tunnel exits. The lighting is provided by two canopy strips and the seats are &quot;Akiko&quot; style, in a burgundy colour.

In the middle of one of the platforms, a display case displays reproductions of photographs of Guy Môquet, his mother, and his father Prosper Môquet, his last letter and various documents. On the occasion of 22 October 2007 commemoration, the shelves were repainted and the lighting equipment was renewed.

During the renovation of the station in 2010, as part of the &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; program, on 28 May 2010, the RATP unveiled the new thematic layout replacing this showcase with a 4 m by 1.70 m fresco in memory of Guy Môquet, designed in collaboration with the l’Amicale Châteaubriant-Voves-Rouillé and created by the design agency Curius.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by lines 21, 31 and the urban service &quot;Traverse Batignolles-Bichat&quot; of the RATP Bus Network.

<text>Saturday Night and Sunday Morning is the first novel by British author Alan Sillitoe and won the Authors&#x27; Club Best First Novel Award.

It was adapted by Sillitoe into the 1960 film of the same name starring Albert Finney, directed by Karel Reisz, and in 1964 was adapted by David Brett as a play for the Nottingham Playhouse, with Ian McKellen playing one of his first leading roles.

Sillitoe later wrote three further parts to the Seatons&#x27; story, &quot;Key to the Door&quot; (1961), &quot;The Open Door&quot; (1989) and &quot;Birthday&quot; (2001).

==Plot==

The novel &quot;Saturday Night and Sunday Morning&quot; is split into two unequal parts: the bulk of the book, Saturday Night, and the much smaller second part, Sunday Morning.

Saturday Night

Saturday Night begins in a working man&#x27;s club in Nottingham. Arthur Seaton is 22 years old, and enjoying a night out with Brenda, the wife of a colleague at work. Challenged to a drinking contest, Arthur defeats &quot;Loudmouth&quot; before falling down the stairs drunk. Brenda takes him home with her and they spend the night together. Arthur enjoys breakfast with Brenda before her husband Jack gets home from a weekend at the races.

Arthur works at a lathe at a bicycle factory with his friend Jack. Arthur keeps his mind occupied during the mundane and repetitive work through a mental collage of imagined fantasies, and memories of the past. He earns a good wage of 14 pounds a week, and Robboe, his superior, fears he may get in trouble for letting Arthur earn so much. Soon Arthur hears the news that Jack has been switched to nights, which pleases Arthur as he can now spend more time with Jack&#x27;s wife. At the same time, Arthur carries on with Brenda&#x27;s sister Winnie.

During another night out at the pub, Arthur meets Doreen, a young unmarried girl with whom he begins a relatively innocent courtship — all the while keeping Brenda and Winnie a secret. However, although Jack is oblivious to his wife&#x27;s infidelity, Winnie&#x27;s husband Bill catches on — and Arthur&#x27;s actions catch up with him when Bill and an accomplice jump Arthur one night, leaving him beaten and bed-ridden for days.

Sunday Morning

Sunday Morning follows the course of events after Arthur&#x27;s assault. When Doreen comes to check up on him, Arthur finally comes clean about his affairs with Brenda and Winnie. Doreen stays in a relationship with Arthur despite his dishonesty; Brenda and Winnie disappear from the story. By the end of the novel, Arthur and Doreen have made plans to marry.

==Cultural references==
* Miranda Grey in John Fowles&#x27;s &quot;The Collector&quot; (1963) found the book and its protagonist Arthur Seaton &quot;disgusting&quot;.
* English singer Morrissey was heavily influenced by the book and its 1960 film adaptation. The runout groove on the B-side of vinyl copies of The Smiths&#x27; 1986 album &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot; feature the line &quot;Them was rotten days&quot; said by Aunt Ada (Hylda Baker) in the film. Also the line said by Doreen before Arthur takes her to the fair &quot;I want to go where there&#x27;s life and there&#x27;s people&quot; inspired the song &quot;There Is a Light That Never Goes Out&quot; on the same album (&quot;I want to see people and I want to see life&quot;).
* The title of Arctic Monkeys&#x27; debut album &quot;Whatever People Say I Am, That&#x27;s What I&#x27;m Not&quot; is a direct quote from the book, and many of its songs were inspired by the protagonist Arthur. The art design of the album was influenced by the realist images of British working-class neighbourhoods and night life in &quot;Saturday Night and Sunday Morning&quot;.
* During a 2011 BBC interview on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, the comedian Frank Skinner stated that &quot;Saturday Night and Sunday Morning&quot; was the first book he read at the age of 21.
* In 2013, BBC Radio 4 presented a two-part dramatic adaptation (by Robert Rigby) of the novel.

==Critical reception==

On 5 November 2019, &quot;BBC News&quot; included &quot;Saturday Night and Sunday Morning&quot; on its list of the 100 most influential novels.

<text>Mairie de Clichy () is a station on Line 13 of the Paris Métro. Located on the line&#x27;s northwestern branch, it is situated under Rue Matre in the commune of Clichy, Hauts-de-Seine.

==History==
The station opened on 3 May 1980 upon completion of the extension of Line 13 from Porte de Clichy to Gabriel Péri. Its name refers to the town hall of Clichy. In 2017, it was used by 7,107,063 passengers, making it the network&#x27;s 42nd busiest station out of 302.

It has the particularity of being very far from the surrounding stations, approximately 1,250 meters separate it from the previous station, Porte de Clichy, and 1,600 meters from the next metro station, Gabriel Péri. This choice was made because, during the studies, nearly 90% of the city&#x27;s population lived less than 800 meters from the station, and because it was particularly difficult to create a station at the outlet of the Pont de Clichy, in a complex interchange and at the point where the line passes by viaduct.

In 2019, according to RATP estimates, 6,342,058 travelers entered this station, which places it in 51st position among metro stations for its use out of 302.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has two entrances to Rue Martre, one in front of the administrative center, the other inserted in a lower building on the other side of the street.

===Station layout===


===Platforms===
Mairie de Clichy is a standard configuration station with two platforms separated by metro tracks.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by lines 54, 174, 274, 341 and the TUC urban service of the RATP Bus Network and, at night, by lines N15 and N51 of the Noctilien network.

<text>La Fourche () is a station of the Paris Métro, serving Line 13.

==Location==
The station is at the heart of a junction in two branches of line 13: the Asnières - Gennevilliers branch and the Saint-Denis branch. The first remains in a two-lane tunnel from the common trunk. On the other hand, the second is doubled: towards Saint-Denis, it leaves the double track just after the La Fourche station and finds the opposite way coming from Saint-Denis before the Guy Môquet station; in the other direction, towards Châtillon, the track coming from Saint-Denis separates before La Fourche and passes under the double-track tunnel of the Asnières branch to serve a platform in a station located below and consisting of a single platform of this unique path; then it joins the double-track tunnel just before Place de Clichy station.

==History==
The station opened on 26 February 1911 as part of the Nord-Sud Company&#x27;s line B from Saint-Lazare to Porte de Saint-Ouen. On 20 January 1912 it became a junction with the opening of the northwesterly branch to Porte de Clichy. On 27 March 1931 line B became line 13 of the &quot;Métro&quot;.

Its name refers to the place called &quot;La Fourche&quot; which, on the surface, designates the Y-shaped crossroads of Avenue de Saint-Ouen and Avenue de Clichy. At this point, the two branches of line 13 separate.

From its conception, the station was decorated in the very elaborate style of the Nord-Sud Company. From the 1950s until 2010, the upper station had a metallic bodywork with blue horizontal pillars, illuminated gold advertising frames complemented by blue colored &quot;Motte&quot; seats. The lower and upper stations were renovated in 2010, restoring, for the latter, the original North-South style.

In 2019, 2,563,103 passengers entered this station which places it in 204th position among metro stations for its attendance out of 302.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has only one entrance located on the sidewalk at the corner of Avenue de Clichy and Avenue de Saint-Ouen. A SIEL sign located at the ticket hall indicates to travelers the waiting times allowing them to choose between the two platforms in the direction of Châtillon.

===Station layout===
===Platforms===
La Fourche has the particularity of having two stations located one above the other: the first is called the &quot;upper station&quot;; the second is called the &quot;lower station&quot;.

The upper station has a platform in the direction of Asnières and Saint-Denis and a platform in the direction of Châtillon-Montrouge served only by trains from Asnières. It is of standard configuration with two platforms separated by the metro tracks. The walls are vertical, and the vault is semi-elliptical, characteristic of North-South stations. The tiles and ceramics, completely redone in 2010, takes up the original decoration with advertising frames and the surrounds of the name of the station in brown color, brown geometric designs on the walls and the vault, the name inscribed in white earthenware on a blue background of a small size above the advertising frames and of a very large size between these frames, as well as the directions incorporated in the ceramic on the tunnel exits. The bevelled white earthenware tiles cover the walls, the vault and the tunnel exits. The lighting is provided by two canopies and the seats, &quot;Akiko&quot; style, are yellow.

The lower station has a single platform towards &quot;Châtillon-Montrouge&quot; served only by trains from Saint-Denis. Renovated 2010 at the same time as the upper station, although never having been fitted with a bodywork, it uses the same advertising frames, the same surrounds for the name of the station, the same lighting and the same seats. Being located under the upper station, it has a concrete ceiling, undecorated, supported by vertical walls, unique for a North-South station. It also has on the wall, in front of the platform, several paintings referring to North-South society.

North of La Fourche station and heading south from Guy Môquet, the tracks on the Saint-Denis branch diverge, the northbound track ascending and joining with the tracks from Asnières - Gennevilliers just before reaching the station. The southbound track remains at the same level and enters the station underneath the rest of the tracks. Heading south from the station, the tracks from the upper-level platforms descend and the southbound track from the lower-level platform joins them just north of the Place de Clichy.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by lines 21, 54 and 74 and, at night, by lines N15 and N51 of the Noctilien network.

<text>Liège () is a station on Line 13 of the Paris Métro. Opened in 1911, it is located the border of the 8th and 9th arrondissements.

==History==
It was built as part of the Nord-Sud Company&#x27;s Line B from Saint-Lazare to Porte de Saint-Ouen and opened on 26 February 1911 as &quot;Berlin&quot;, named after the nearby &quot;Rue Berlin&quot;. As the Rue d&#x27;Amsterdam, which the line runs under at this point, is too narrow to accommodate platforms across from each other, the station was built with offset platforms. It was closed on 1 August 1914 at the beginning of World War I. It reopened on 1 December 1914, when it and the street it was named after had been renamed after the Belgian city of Liège, paying homage to the heroic Belgian resistance during the Battle of Liège who surely saved French and British armies. On 27 March 1931 the Nord-Sud Company was taken over by the Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain de Paris and line B became line 13 of the Métro.

The station was closed at the beginning of World War II, when many stations were closed for economic reasons. Unlike all but eight of the closed stations, its reopening was significantly delayed, in this case until 1968. Even then its opening hours were limited, being closed on Sunday and closing at 8pm on the other days, with all trains running through without stopping. Although Rennes station, which also reopened in 1968 began to operate normal opening hours in 2004, the authorities refused to agree to Liège working normal hours. Changing lifestyles and increasing redevelopment of the area, with residences replacing offices, inspired a sustained political campaign. Eventually it was agreed to operate normal hours from 4 December 2006.

In 1982, Liège was refurbished with new ceramic decorations made in Welkenraedt, Belgium, which evoke the landscapes and monuments of the Province of Liège. It had further renovation work in December 2006.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has only one entrance, a staircase on the median strip opposite no. 21, Rue de Liège.

===Station layout===

*Note: The side platforms are offset.

===Platforms===
Its geographical location explains one of its peculiarities. It has two platforms that do not face each other. The Rue d&#x27;Amsterdam, being too narrow to accommodate the traditional station on network, the trains stop at the first half-station encountered. The Commerce metro station, on line 8, is the only other station in the capital built as this model for the same reasons, the trains stopping there on in the second half-station encountered.

The station was originally decorated, like all the non-connecting stations of the &quot;Société du Chemin de Fer Électrique Nord-Sud de Paris&quot;, simply known as the &#x27;North-South&#x27;, with its name advertised on vast mosaics and friezes of brown ceramic bearing the initials &#x27;NS&#x27;. This decoration was supplemented with a new one based on the framework of cultural exchanges between France and Belgium in 1982. This is based on ceramics made from photos of Welkenraedt and installed in the advertising frames of the right wall facing the single platforms of each half-station. It evokes landscapes and monuments of the province of Liège. This modification also saw the installation of new tiles on the entrance tunnels of each platform, with the coat of arms of the city of Liège on one of the two entrances. The ceramics on the two platforms are the work of two scenographers from Liège, Marie-Claire Van Vuchelen for the southern direction and Daniel Hicter for the northern direction. The eighteen frescoes, nine in each direction, are painted in color in northern direction and blue duotone in the southern direction.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by lines 21 and 95 of the RATP Bus Network.

<text>Varenne () is a station on Line 13 of the Paris Métro. Located in the 7th arrondissement, it is named after the Rue de Varenne.

==History==
The station opened on 20 December 1923 as part of the original section of Line 10 between Invalides and Croix-Rouge (a station east of Sèvres-Babylone, which was closed during World War II). On 27 July 1937 the section of Line 10 between Invalides and Duroc was transferred to become the first section of the old Line 14, which was connected under the Seine and incorporated into Line 13 on 9 November 1976.

The Rue de Varenne runs east from the station. It has been closely associated with the Government of France, since the President of the Council of Ministers (equivalent to Prime Minister under the Third and Fourth Republics) settled in the nearby Hôtel Matignon in January 1935. Other ministries are also located in the private mansions of the district. During World War II, the station was closed because the government was in Vichy and the private mansions, which had housed ministries, were deserted. Since the establishment of the Fifth Republic in 1958, the Hôtel Matignon has been the official residence of the Prime Minister of France.

Nearby are the Musée Rodin (Rodin Museum) and Les Invalides.

<text>Pinar del Río is the capital city of Pinar del Río Province, Cuba. With a population of 191,081 (2022), it is the 10th-largest city in Cuba. Inhabitants of the area are called &quot;Pinareños&quot;.

==History==
Pinar del Río was one of the last major cities in Cuba founded by the Spanish, on 10 September 1867. The city and province was founded as &quot;Nueva Filipinas&quot; (New Philippines) in response to an influx of Asian laborers coming from the Philippine Islands to work on tobacco plantations.

Pinar del Río&#x27;s history begins with two tribes, the Guanahatabey, a group of nomadic people who lived in caves and procured most of their livelihood from the sea. Less advanced than the other indigenous natives who lived on the island, the Guanahatabey were a peaceful and passive race whose culture came about largely independently of the Taíno. Another culture that inhabited this area was the Ciboney People, a subgroup of the Taino people who inhabited mostly all of the land of Cuba.The Guanahatabey were extinct by the time of the Spanish arrival in 1492; little firsthand documentation remains of how the archaic Guanahatabey society was structured and organized, although some archeological sites have been found on the Guanahacabibes Peninsula.

Post-Columbus, the conquistadors left rugged Pinar del Río largely to its own devices, and the area developed lackadaisically only after Canary Islanders started arriving in the late 1500s. These Canarians became the tobacco farmers of the region. It was originally called Nueva Filipina (New Philippines), but the region was renamed Pinar del Río in 1778, supposedly for the pine forests crowded along the Río Guama. Tobacco plantations and cattle ranches quickly sprang up in the rich soil, along with open grazing land that typifies Pinar. Farmers who made a living from the delicate and well-tended crops were colloquially christened &quot;Guajiros&quot;, a native word that literally means &#x27;one of us&#x27;. By the mid-1800s Europeans were hooked on the fragrant weed, and the region flourished. Sea routes opened up and in 1893 the railways was extended to facilitate the shipping of the perishable product. Pinar del Río is known as &quot;the Mecca of tobacco&quot;.

==Geography==
The municipality borders San Luis, San Juan y Martínez, Viñales and Consolación del Sur. The villages included in the municipality are Briones Montoto, Cayo Conuco, La Coloma, La Conchita and Las Ovas.

<text>Gaîté () is a station on Line 13 of the Paris Métro in the 14th arrondissement.

The station is named after the nearby &quot;rue de la Gaîté&quot;, which was a country road connecting Clamart with the &quot;Barrière du Montparnasse&quot;, a gate in the Wall of the Farmers-General at the intersection of the Boulevard Edgar-Quinet and the &quot;rue du Montparnasse&quot; (the location of Edgar Quinet métro station). It was built between 1784 and 1791 by the Ferme générale, the corporation of tax farmers, to enforce the collection of taxes of goods, including wine, that were imported into Paris. Guinguettes, restaurants, and theatres were built outside the wall to avoid these taxes. &quot;Gaîté&quot; is an old French spelling of &quot;gaiety&quot;, reflecting this trade.

== History ==
The station opened on 21 January 1937 as part of the initial section of the old line 14 between Porte de Vanves and Bienvenüe (today known as Montparnasse–Bienvenue). On 9 November 1976, the old line 14 was incorporated into line 13 following the latter&#x27;s extension in successive phases from Saint-Lazare.

As part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; programme by the RATP, the station&#x27;s corridors and platform lighting were renovated and modernised on 15 July 2001.

In 2019, the station was used by 2,713,799 passengers, making it the 193rd busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 1,205,958 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 214th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 1,644,148 passengers, making it the 216th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

On 30 November 2021, the station was renamed &quot;Gaîté - Joséphine Baker&quot;, after Joséphine Baker (1906-1975), an American-born French entertainer and spy during World War II as part of the French resistance, the day she was inducted into the Pantheon. She is the first Black woman to be honoured there, with her body remaining in Monaco. This follows the wish of the President for a métro station to be named after her. The station is located next to Bobino, a famous theatre where she held her last performance on 9 April 1975, a few days before her death. Place Joséphine-Baker, located at the end of rue de la Gaîté, was also named after her back in 25 September 2000. It is one of the few métro stations to have been named after a woman, after Bagneux–Lucie Aubrac, Barbara, Barbès–Rochechouart, Boucicaut, Chardon Lagache, Europe, Louise Michel, Madeleine, and Pierre et Marie Curie.

On 27 April 2023, two people died at the station after voluntarily going down to the tracks at around 12:45 am. They were hit by an incoming train while attempting to get back onto the platforms. This came five days after another accident on the métro at Bel-Air (on line 6) that resulted in the death of a woman when the train departed the platform with her jacket caught between the doors as she was alighting.

<text>Pernety () is a station on line Line 13 of the Paris Métro in the 14th arrondissement.

It is named after the nearby &quot;rue Pernety&quot;, named after Viscount Joseph Marie de Pernety (1766–1856), one of Napoleon&#x27;s generals and owned the land where the street was built.

== History ==
The station opened on 21 January 1937 as part of the initial section of the old line 14 between Porte de Vanves and Bienvenüe (today known as Montparnasse–Bienvenue). On 9 November 1976, the old line 14 was incorporated into line 13 following the latter&#x27;s extension in successive phases from Saint-Lazare.

The station has a standard configuration with 2 tracks surrounded by 2 side platforms. The lower portion of the side walls are vertical instead of elliptical due to the narrower width of the road it lies beneath.

On the platform towards &quot;Les Courtilles&quot; or &quot;Saint-Denis - Université&quot;, the former station manager&#x27;s office has been turned into a small exhibition, &quot;Vitrine Ecolière&quot;, by students from EREA Croce Spinelli, a local vocational school. It serves as an opportunity to introduce students to merchandising through applied arts and sales, putting into use their training to develop various showcases in a simultated shop window. The showcase changes depending on the holidays throughout the year, such as Halloween, Christmas, Easter, Valentine&#x27;s Day, Mother&#x27;s Day, amongst others.

<text>Plaisance () is a station on line Line 13 of the Paris Métro in the 14th arrondissement.

It is named after the Château du Maine which was built in the 17th century and possessed a large park. The word &quot;plaisance&quot; is equivalent to the English word &quot;pleasance&quot;, that is a pleasure garden. It was purchased in 1842 by a surveyor called Couesnon whose son subdivided it, creating the district of &quot;Plaisance&quot; between 1858 and 1860, which became one of the largest slums in Paris. The &quot;Compagnie générale des omnibus&quot; (a major 19th century operator of horse buses and later trams and motor buses) razed the castle to build garages.

== History ==
The station opened on 21 January 1937 as part of the initial section of the old line 14 between Porte de Vanves and Bienvenüe (today known as Montparnasse–Bienvenue). On 9 November 1976, the old line 14 was incorporated into line 13 following the latter&#x27;s extension in successive phases from Saint-Lazare.

As part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; programme by the RATP, the station&#x27;s corridors and platform lighting were renovated and modernised on 8 November 2002.

On 24 December 2018, a woman committed suicide at the station, interrupting traffic on the line between Montparnasse-Bienvenüe and Châtillon–Montrouge for over two hours in the evening.

In 2019, the station was used by 4,784,211 passengers, making it the 87th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 2,590,236 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 79th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

<doc id="504733" wikidata="Q3030757" url="?curid=504733" title="Rogers Park, Chicago">
<text>Rogers Park is a neighborhood on the North Side of Chicago, Illinois, and one of the city&#x27;s 77 municipally recognized community areas. Located north of the Loop along the shore of Lake Michigan, it features green spaces, early 20th-century architecture, live theater, bars, restaurants, and beaches. Rogers Park is known for its racial and cultural diversity: according to the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, it is the community that most closely matches the city&#x27;s ethnic makeup as a whole.

The community is bounded by the city of Evanston along Juneway Terrace and Howard Street to the north, Ridge Boulevard to the west, Devon Avenue and the Edgewater neighborhood to the south, and Lake Michigan to the east. West Ridge, just to the west, was part of Rogers Park until the 1890s and is still sometimes referred to as &quot;West Rogers Park.&quot; In the early 1900s, what is today the main campus of Loyola University Chicago was established at the neighborhood&#x27;s southeastern end, along the lake.

==History==
===19th century===
The Rogers Park area was colonized at the convergence of two Native American trails predating modern metropolitan Chicago, that evolved into Rogers Avenue and Ridge Boulevard. The Pottawatomi and other regional tribes settled in Rogers Park from season to season. The name of Indian Boundary Park west of Rogers Park reflects this history as does Pottawattomie Park near Clark Street and Rogers Avenue.

In 1809, the Karthauser Inn was established as stagecoach stop and tavern. Phillip Rogers of Ireland purchased of land in the area from the 1830s to 1856. He operated a toll gate beside his home at what became Ridge and Lunt Avenues and often traded and worked with the local tribes.

During the period 1844 to 1850 arriving colonizers started farms along a ridge in the western portion of Rogers Park, avoiding the often flooded lowlands to the east. In 1870 Rogers&#x27; son-in-law, Patrick I. Touhy, sold to land speculators, including John Farwell, Luther Greenleaf, Stephen Lunt, Charles Morse, and George Estes; all of whom contributed names to streets in the area. With an additional purchase of 125 acres in 1873 these speculators together with Touhy formed the Rogers Park Building and Land Company. Also in 1873, the Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railway completed a line through the area and constructed a station at Greenleaf Ave. The population was 200 and a post office was opened in July 1873.

On April 29, 1878, voters incorporated Rogers Park as a village of Illinois governed by six trustees. In 1885, the Chicago, Evanston &amp; Lake Superior Railroad, a predecessor of the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railroad, built a combination freight and commuter line through eastern Rogers Park on the present &quot;L&quot; right-of-way with a stop at Morse Avenue. By 1893, the population was 3500, the North Shore Electric Railroad expanded its service into the area, and the village of Rogers Park was annexed to Chicago.

The Rogers Park Women&#x27;s Club opened the first library in 1894. In that year, the Great Fire of Rogers Park destroyed the business district.

===20th century===
By 1904 the population had grown to 7,500. The Northwestern elevated line was extended from Wilson (4600N) to Howard Street (7600N). St. Ignatius College moved to the lakefront in 1912 and changed its name to Loyola University in 1915. Successive generations brought about vast cultural changes to the former village. By 1930 the population was 57,094 making Rogers Park one of Chicago&#x27;s most densely populated areas. Chicagoans began to move to new planned communities in the north suburbs by the 1930s, which ushered in the migration of German, English, Irish, and Jewish families to Rogers Park. With the devastation in Europe following World War II, many additional immigrants found their way to Chicago and the Rogers Park neighborhood. A growing and vibrant Hispanic community has grown along Clark Street since 2000.

For decades, most of the community has been within the 49th Ward of the City of Chicago. The ward covered much of Edgewater and went as far south as Hollywood in the 1960s, while the 50th ward extended east to Ashland Avenue (in some areas as late as 1990). But, through redistricting, a part of Rogers Park came within the 40th ward, and the 49th Ward encompasses part of West Rogers Park.

==Geography==
Rogers Park is Community Area #1. It is on the far north side of the city, being from the Loop.

==Demographics==

Rogers Park has a higher rate of residents with Masters, professional, and doctoral degrees than the state average. In addition, the rate of residents that work for nonprofit institutions is almost twice as high as the state average.

Per 2020 U.S. census data, Rogers Park residents are 45.1% white, 24.3% Black, 19.5% Hispanic, and 5.1% Asian, with a further 5.8% belonging to two or more races. This makes it the community of Chicago most representative of the city&#x27;s racial demographics as a whole. 34% of Rogers Park residents are foreign-born.

==Economy and culture==
The dominant educational institution in Rogers Park is Loyola University Chicago, located in the southeast corner of the community. Historic places of interest include Madonna Della Strada Chapel, the mother church of the Jesuit Province of Chicago (one of the largest Jesuit provinces) and Mundelein Center for the Fine and Performing Arts, one of the tallest Art Deco buildings in Chicago outside of the downtown area. The community continues to be home to many Jesuit religious-order institutions. However, modern Rogers Park contains many different religious institutions.

The presence of its diverse array of students and academics from Loyola University Chicago and Northwestern University, just a few miles to the north, has historically lent Rogers Park a high degree of liberalism and tolerance. The community also has a high Internet presence. In 2007, the Web site &quot;outside.in&quot; named Rogers Park one of the country&#x27;s &quot;bloggiest neighborhoods.&quot;

Rogers Park has over 130 restaurants plus coffee shops and cafes and has been ranked &quot;very walkable&quot; by Walk Score.
Rogers Park is also home to the Glenwood Sunday Market, a farmers market, a program of the Rogers Park Business Alliance, devoted to providing local, sustainable foods that are also organic whenever possible. The Chicago Comedy Film Festival calls Rogers Park home and is held annually at The New 400 Theaters (now closed). The international film festival brings over 500 filmmakers, actors and agents to the neighborhood from around the world.

A plethora of beaches line the shores of Lake Michigan through much of the neighborhood. The Artists of the Wall festival at the Lake Michigan beachfront at Farwell Avenue pier (Hartigan Park on Albion Avenue on the streetmap above), in which community members paint murals on concrete benches, has been held for over twenty years, the longest event of its kind in Chicago&#x27;s history.
The Luxembourg Brotherhood of America has held an annual event called Schobermesse in Rogers Park in June. The event was discontinued between 1967-2001, but continues to this day.

==Crime and policing==
In 1993, Chicago&#x27;s 24th Police District, which includes Rogers Park and the adjacent Chicago community of West Ridge, was selected as one of five police districts to pilot a new concept for Chicago law enforcement called Chicago Alternative Policing Strategy (&quot;CAPS&quot;). A merger of police and community efforts was implemented, which resulted in a noticeable effect on crime statistics. Weekly beat meetings (planning and strategy sessions) were held across the 24th Police District. All of Chicago&#x27;s police districts put the strategy into practice by 1996. Index crimes in the 24th police district fell by about half between 1996 and 2009. According to an e-mail from 49th Ward Alderman Joe Moore, between January 1, 2013, and February 26, 2013, the 24th Police District was the only police district in Chicago in which no one was shot. In that same eight week period, the 24th District reported fewer crimes than all but one of Chicago&#x27;s 22 police districts.

==Transportation==

Public transportation in Rogers Park is provided by the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) in the form of the Chicago &#x27;L&#x27;. The CTA also operates bus routes in the area. A commuter rail service is provided by Metra. 
Rogers Park is served by three &#x27;L&#x27; lines - the Red, Yellow and Purple lines. There are four Red Line stations: Howard, Jarvis, Morse, and Loyola. The Yellow Line and the Purple Line connect at Howard Station, offering service westward to Skokie and north to Evanston and Wilmette, respectively. The Howard Street &#x27;L&#x27; station, the northernmost Chicago Transit Authority rail stop in the city, experienced major renovation from 2006 to 2009 and is now a major transportation terminal for the northern Chicago region. Several bus routes allow travel to Chicago&#x27;s Downtown, called the Loop, as well as the city&#x27;s suburban areas. They consist of the codice_1, codice_2, codice_3, codice_4, codice_5, codice_6, and codice_7. The Metra commuter Rogers Park station, at the intersection of Lunt and Ravenswood Avenues, is centrally located in the Rogers Park neighborhood. Rogers Park is one of the Metra system&#x27;s most heavily used stops.

The community has taken measures to improve bicycle and pedestrian travel. Participatory budgeting, community meetings, and task force efforts led to an extensive neighborhood greenway project to improve bicycle infrastructure. A combination of buffered bike lanes, raised crosswalks, traffic circles, curb extensions, and more have helped connect residents to the neighborhood&#x27;s most popular destinations (Loyola University, CTA Red Line stations, schools) via bike.

<text>Porte de Vanves () is a station on Line 13 of the Paris Métro and a stop on tramway Line 3a in the 14th arrondissement.

It is named after the P&quot;orte de Vanves&quot;, a gate in the 19th century Thiers wall of Paris. Contrary to what its name suggests, it gave access to the commune of Malakoff – the commune of Vanves is instead accessible by &quot;Porte Brancion&quot; located 250 metres west.

== History ==
The station opened on 21 January 1937 as part of the initial section of the old line 14 between Porte de Vanves and Bienvenüe (today known as Montparnasse–Bienvenue). It served as its southern terminus until 9 November 1976 when it was extended to Châtillon–Montrouge. The old line 14 was incorporated into line 13 on the same day following the latter&#x27;s extension in successive phases from Saint-Lazare.

In 2019, the station was used by 4,660,158 passengers, making it the 92nd busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 2,460,078 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 87th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 3,395,358 passengers, making it the 87th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

<text>Châtillon–Montrouge station () is the southern terminus of Line 13 of the Paris Métro and the eastern terminus of tramway Line 6. It is an elevated station located on the border between the communes of Châtillon and Montrouge in Hauts-de-Seine.

== History ==

The station opened on 9 November 1976 as part of the extension of line 13 from Porte de Vanves to Châtillon–Montrouge, on the same day the old line 14 was incorporated into line 13 following the latter&#x27;s extension in successive phases from Saint-Lazare.

Since June 2008, to enable automatic train reversal at the station, platform screen doors have been installed on the platforms to prevent passengers from falling onto the tracks when no drivers are present in the trains during this operation. It was the first station on the line to receive them.

In 2019, the station was used by 7,196,503 passengers, making it the 39th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 3,738,453 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 33rd busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 5,034,012 passengers, making it the 35th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

As part of the Grand Paris Express, the station will become an interchange with line 15, with preparatory work having begun in 2015 to free up space for the station, and construction since 2018. It is slated to open in late 2026.

The station will consist of five intermediate levels, including a mezzanine, with an artistic ceiling in the atrium designed by Laurent Grasso and David Trottin. The work will consist of 2750 printed aluminum blades that form a trompe-l&#x27;oeil sky inspired by Renaissance paintings and will vibrate with the circulation of air. As part of the &quot;Illustrer le Grand Paris&quot; programme by the &quot;Société du Grand Paris&quot;, which aimed to illustrate Ile-de-France territories served by the new métro lines, the station&#x27;s platforms will feature a fresco designed by Roxane Lumeret.

In November 2019, the tunnel boring machine, Ellen, reached the station, completing the tunneling at the station. Civil works, including the excavation of the station box, were completed in end-May 2022. The installation of infrastructure such as escalators and lifts, networks (electrical, telephony, plumbing), painting, and construction of the surface building will take place over the next two years.

The existing line 13&#x27;s station was upgraded in early 2023 as part of the project. Its existing platforms were renovated and a sheltered footbridge was added above the platforms to connect to line 15. A new side platform was constructed to serve as an additional departure platform to accommodate the increased traffic expected when line 15 opens. It is located next to the surface building for line 15 and is equipped with an emergency exit.

== Passenger services ==

=== Access ===
The station has two accesses:

* Access 1: avenue Marx Dormoy &quot;(Montrouge)&quot;
* Access 2: rue de l&#x27;Avenir &quot;(Châtillon)&quot;

<text>STS-85 was the 23rd flight of Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; that performed multiple space science packages. It was launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on 7 August 1997.
A major experiment was the CRISTA-SPAS free-flyer which had various telescopes on board.

==Crew==
Jeffrey Ashby was originally assigned to be pilot on this mission, but asked to be relieved in order to take care of his wife, who was dying from cancer. He was replaced by Kent Rominger and was assigned to pilot STS-93 instead. The launch occurred on Rominger&#x27;s 41st birthday.

=== Crew seat assignments ===

==Mission highlights==
The deployment and retrieval of a satellite designed to study Earth&#x27;s middle atmosphere along with a test of potential International Space Station hardware highlighted NASA&#x27;s sixth Shuttle mission of 1997. The prime payload for the flight, the Cryogenic Infrared Spectrometers and Telescopes for the Atmosphere-Shuttle Pallet Satellite-2 (CRISTA-SPAS-2) made its second flight on the Space Shuttle (previous flight STS-66 in 1994) and was the fourth mission in a cooperative venture between the German Space Agency (DARA) and NASA.

During the flight, Davis used &quot;Discovery&quot;&#x27;s robot arm to deploy the CRISTA-SPAS payload for about 9 days of free-flight. CRISTA-SPAS consists of three telescopes and four spectrometers that measured trace gases and dynamics of the Earth&#x27;s middle atmosphere. Davis also operated the robot arm for CRISTA-SPAS retrieval. The Shuttle Pallet Satellite (SPAS) on which the scientific instruments were mounted is a self-contained platform that provides power, command, control and communication with &quot;Discovery&quot; during free-flight.

Two other instruments mounted on the SPAS also studied the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. The Middle Atmosphere High Resolution Spectrograph Instrument (MAHRSI) measured hydroxyl and nitric oxide by sensing UV radiation emitted and scattered by the atmosphere, while the Surface Effects Sample Monitor (SESAM) was a passive carrier for state-of-the-art optical surfaces to study the impact of the atomic oxygen and the space environment on materials and services.

The crew also supported the Manipulator Flight Demonstration (MFD) experiment being sponsored by NASDA, the Japanese Space Agency. MFD consists of three separate experiments located on a support truss in the payload bay. The primary objective was to demonstrate the newly designed dexterous robot arm in the space environment, before installing on the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) of the International Space Station.

Several Hitchhiker payloads, including the Technology Applications and Science Payload (TAS-01), the International Extreme Ultraviolet Hitchhiker (IEH-02), and the Ultraviolet Spectrograph Telescope for Astronomical Research (UVSTAR) were housed in Discovery&#x27;s payload bay, operating independently of crew support during the flight.

The Microgravity Vibration Isolation Mount (MIM) experiment was operated by Canadian Space Agency astronaut Bjarni Tryggvason. The MIM experiment is a small double-locker size device designed to isolate International Space Station payloads and experiments from disturbances created by thruster firings or crew activity. MIM was operated for 30 hours with real-time data transmission to investigators on the ground. (Reference NASA Press Release 96–224)

Another experiment onboard STS-85 was the Southwest Ultraviolet Imaging System (SWUIS-01) from the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) along with scientific collaborators from JPL, APL, and the University of Maryland. SWUIS (pronounced, &quot;Swiss&quot;) is a wide-field UV imager to which was used to observe comet Hale-Bopp. It is based around an 18-cm Maksutov UV telescope and a UV-sensitive, Xybion image-intensified CCD camera that frames at video rates (30 Hz). Each SWUIS observation period lasted approximately 3 hours, and garnered approximately 10^5 images in up to 7 filter bandpasses. SWUIS was operated from a 2-axis mount inside the Shuttle mid-deck cockpit, and looked out of the Shuttle through a quartz window. SWUIS can be pointed anywhere in a 4.5 deg cone around the centerline of the comet. Mission specialists set up and operated the instrument.

On Day 8, the crew was awakened by the song &quot;You Will Go to the Moon&quot; by Canadian artists Moxy Früvous, selected by astronaut Marc Garneau, the first Canadian in space.

The mission lasted a day longer than originally planned due to a threat of ground fog at Kennedy Space Center.

<text>Ja&#x27;far ibn [[al-Mu&#x27;tasim|Muḥammad]] ibn [[Harun al-Rashid|Hārūn]] al-Mutawakkil ʿalā Allāh (); March 82211 December 861, commonly known by his regnal name al-Mutawwakil ala Allah (), was the tenth Abbasid caliph, ruling from 847 until his assassination in 861. He succeeded his brother, al-Wathiq (), and is known for expanding the empire to its maximum extent. He was deeply religious, and is remembered for discarding the Muʿtazila, ending the Mihna (a period of persecution of Islamic scholars), and releasing Ahmad ibn Hanbal. He is also known for his tough rule, especially with respect to non-Muslim subjects.

He was assassinated on 11 December 861 by the Turkic guard with the support of his son, al-Muntasir, marking the beginning of the period of civil strife known as the &quot;Anarchy at Samarra&quot;.

==Early life==
Al-Mutawakkil was born on 31 March 822 to the Abbasid prince Abu Ishaq Muhammad (the future al-Mu&#x27;tasim) and a slave concubine from Khwarazm named Shuja. His early life is obscure, as he played no role in political affairs until the death of his older half-brother, al-Wathiq, in August 847.

Al-Mutawakkil was born during his uncle al-Ma&#x27;mun&#x27;s reign. His full name was Jaʽfar ibn Muhammad and his Kunya was Abu al-Fadl. The young prince&#x27;s early life coincided with what is called the golden age of the Abbasid Caliphate. During his youth his father was an important official of his uncle, caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun, who ruled until his death in 833. According to the account of al-Tabari, on his deathbed al-Ma&#x27;mun dictated a letter nominating his brother, rather than al-Abbas, as his successor, and Abu Ishaq was acclaimed as caliph on 9August, with the laqab of al-Mu&#x27;tasim (in full &quot;al-Muʿtaṣim bi’llāh&quot;, &quot;he who seeks refuge in God&quot;). His father became the eighth Abbasid caliph of the Caliphate in 833. His father ruled the caliphate for eight years and he was succeeded by his elder son al-Wathiq.

As a young prince, Jaʿfar&#x27;s first and elder son &quot;Muhammad&quot; (the future al-Muntasir) was born in 837. Al-Muntasir&#x27;s mother was Hubshiya, a Greek Umm walad. At the time of his birth Jaʿfar was 14 years old. His other sons Ahmad (the future al-Mu&#x27;tamid) and Talha (the future al-Muwaffaq) were born in 842 and 843, respectively. The future al-Mu&#x27;tamid&#x27;s mother was Kufan Umm walad called Fityan.

As a prince, Jaʿfar lead the pilgrims in 842 (the year of al-Wathiq&#x27;s accession). Al-Wathiq&#x27;s mother Qaratis accompanied him, intending to make the pilgrimage, but she died in al-Hirah on 4th Dhu al-Qadah (14 August 842) and was buried in Kufah in the Abbasid palace of Dawud ibn Isa. Jaʿfar remained a courtier during his brother&#x27;s reign.

==Caliphate==

Al-Wathiq&#x27;s death was unexpected, and although he had a young son, he had not designated a successor. Consequently, the leading officials, the vizier Muhammad ibn al-Zayyat, the chief &quot;qādī&quot;, Ahmad ibn Abi Duwad, the Turkish generals Itakh and Wasif al-Turki, and a few others, assembled to determine his successor. Ibn al-Zayyat initially proposed al-Wathiq&#x27;s son Muhammad (the future al-Muhtadi), but due to his youth he was passed over, and instead, the council chose the 26-year-old Ja&#x27;far, who became the caliph al-Mutawakkil. The officials hoped that the new Caliph would prove a pliable puppet, like al-Wathiq. However, al-Mutawakkil was resolved to restore the authority of the caliphal office and restore its independence by destroying the coterie of civil and military officials, raised by his father, that effectively controlled the state.
Al-Mutawakkil&#x27;s first target was the Vizier ibn al-Zayyat, against whom he harboured a deep grudge over the way he had disrespected him in the past. According to al-Tabari, when al-Wathiq had grown angry and suspicious at his brother, al-Mutawakkil had visited the vizier in hopes of persuading him to intercede with the Caliph. Not only had ibn al-Zayyat kept the Abbasid prince waiting until he finished going through his correspondence, but even mocked him, in the presence of others, for coming to him seeking assistance. Not only that, but when the dejected prince left, ibn al-Zayyat wrote to the Caliph to complain about his appearance, noting that he was dressed in an effeminate fashion and that his hair was too long. As a result, al-Wathiq had his brother summoned to court. Al-Mutawakkil came in a brand-new court dress, hoping to mollify the Caliph, but instead, al-Wathiq ordered that his hair be shorn off, and al-Mutawakkil was struck in the face with it. In later times, al-Mutawakkil confessed that he had never been so distressed by anything in his life than by this public humiliation. Thus, on 22 September 847, he sent Itakh to summon ibn al-Zayyat as if for an audience. Instead, the vizier was brought to Itakh&#x27;s residence, where he was placed under house arrest. His possessions were confiscated, and he was tortured to death.

This was the apogee of Itakh&#x27;s career: he combined the positions of chamberlain (&quot;ḥājib&quot;), head of the Caliph&#x27;s personal guard, intendant of the palace, and head of the &quot;barīd&quot;, the public post, which doubled as the government&#x27;s intelligence network. In 848, however, he was persuaded to go to the hajj, and laid down his powers, only to be arrested on his return. His possessions were confiscated—reportedly, in his house alone the Caliph&#x27;s agents found one million gold dinars. He died of thirst in prison on 21 December 849.

He released from prison the famous jurist Ahmad ibn Hanbal ibn Hilal ibn Asad al-Shaybani, who opposed the Mutazilites in their opinion that the Quran was created. Ahmad ibn Hanbal, the founder of the Hanbali madhhab, was arrested and tortured throughout the reigns of, respectively, al-Ma&#x27;mun (813–833), his brother and al-Mutawakkil&#x27;s father, al-Mutassim, and his son al-Wathiq.

One Mahmud ibn al-Faraj al-Nayshapuri arose claiming to be a prophet. He and some followers were arrested in Baghdad. He was imprisoned, and beaten to death on 18 June 850.

In A.H. 236 (850), al-Mutawakkil issued a decree requiring all Christians and Jews in his realm, including Jerusalem and Caesarea, to wear a yellow (honey-colored) hood and belt to distinguish them from Muslims.

In A.H. 237 (851–852), Armenians rebelled and defeated and killed the Abbasid governor. Al-Mutawakkil sent his general Bugha al-Kabir to handle this. Bugha scored successes during this year; the following year, he attacked and burned Tiflis, capturing Ishaq ibn Isma&#x27;il. The rebel leader was later executed. That year (A.H. 238) the Byzantines attacked Damietta.

In A.H. 240 (854–855), the police chief in Homs killed a prominent person stirring an uprising. He was driven out. Al-Mutawakkil offered another police chief. When the next year saw a revolt against this new police chief, al-Mutawakkil had this firmly suppressed. As Christians had joined in the second round of disturbances, the caliph had Christians expelled from Homs.

Also in 241 occurred the firm response to the revolt by the Beja people, who lived beyond Upper Egypt. They had been paying a tax on their gold mines. They ceased paying this, drove out Muslims working in the mines and terrified people in Upper Egypt. Al-Mutawakkil sent al-Qummi to restore order. Al-Qummi sent seven ships with supplies that enabled him to persevere despite the very harsh terrain of this distant territory. He retook the mines, pressed on to the Beja royal stronghold and defeated the king in battle. The Beja resumed payment of the tax.

On 23 February 856, captives were exchanged with the Byzantine Empire. A second such exchange took place some four years later.

Al-Mutawakkil&#x27;s reign is remembered for its many reforms and is viewed as a golden age of the Abbasids. He would be the last great Abbasid caliph; after his death, the dynasty would fall into decline.

==Religious policy==

Al-Mutawakkil decided to diverge away from the religious policies of the previous caliphs, opting instead to put a stop to the controversy over whether the Qur&#x27;an was created or uncreated, ultimately bringing an end to the doctrinal regime that had been in place since 833. 
Al-Mutawakkil spent the next several years taking hostile steps against the Mu&#x27;tazilites, dismissing a number of Ibn Abi Du&#x27;ad&#x27;s &quot;qadi&quot;s from office and ordering an end to debate over the nature of the Qur&#x27;an.

The caliph also attempted to reconcile with Ahmad ibn Hanbal (died 855) and removed Ahmad ibn Nasr&#x27;s body from public display, and finally, in March 852, he ordered that all prisoners held on account of the Inquisition be released, thereby largely bringing a close to the &quot;mihna&quot; period.

Al-Mutawakkil appointed the famous Arab Islamic scholar Yahya ibn Aktham as Chief judge (Qadi al-qudat) in 851, and he remained in office until al-Mutawakkil deposed him in 854. 
Ja&#x27;far ibn Abd al-Wahid al-Hashimi was appointed as chief judge (&quot;qadi al-qudat&quot;) by al-Mutawakkil in July 854 as a replacement for Yahya ibn Aktham.

In 850 al-Mutawakkil made a decree ordering Dhimmi (Christians and Jews) to wear the &quot;zunnar&quot;, honey-coloured outer garments and badge-like patches on their on their servants&#x27; clothing to distinguish them from Muslims. Further, he decrees that their places of worship be destroyed and demonic effigies nailed to the doors, and that they are allowed little involvement in government or official matters. Further, al-Mutawakkil destroyed the shrine at Kerbala which was the center of Shi&#x27;ite pilgrimage.

Mutawakkil ordered the ancient sacred Cypress of the Zoroastrians, the Cypress of Kashmar, to be cut down in order to use it in constructing his new palace despite the enormous protests from the Zoroastrian community. The cypress, more than 1400 years old at the time, was of legendary value to the Zoroastrians, believed to have been brought from Paradise to the earth by Zoroaster. Al-Mutawakkil was killed before the cypress wood arrived for his new palace. 

==Accomplishments==

Al-Mutawakkil was unlike his brother and father in that he was not known for having a thirst for knowledge, but he had an eye for magnificence and a hunger to build. The Great Mosque of Samarra was, at its time, the largest mosque in the world; its minaret is a vast spiraling cone 55 m high with a spiral ramp. The mosque had 17 aisles and its walls were panelled with mosaics of dark blue glass.

The Great Mosque was just part of an extension of Samarra eastwards that was built upon part of the walled royal hunting park. Al-Mutawakkil built as many as 20 palaces (the numbers vary in documents). Samarra became one of the largest cities of the ancient world; even the archaeological site of its ruins is one of the world&#x27;s most extensive.
The Caliph&#x27;s building schemes extended in A.H. 245 (859–860) to a new city, &quot;al-Jaʻfariyya&quot;, which al-Mutawakkil built on the Tigris some eighteen kilometers from Samarra. Al-Mutawakkil ordered a canal to be built to divert water from the Tigris, entrusting the project to two courtiers, who ignored the talents of a local engineer of repute and entrusted the work to al-Farghanī, the great astronomer and writer. Al-Farghanī, who was not a specialist in public works, made a miscalculation and it appeared that the opening of the canal was too deep so that water from the river would only flow at near full flood.

News leaked to the infuriated caliph might have meant the heads of all concerned save for the gracious actions of the engineer, Sind ibn ʻAlī, who vouched for the eventual success of the project, thus risking his own life. Al-Mutawakkil was assassinated shortly before the error became public.

Al-Mutawakkil was keen to involve himself in many religious debates, something that would show in his actions against different minorities. His father had tolerated the Shīʻa Imām who taught and preached at Medina, and for the first years of his reign, al-Mutawakkil continued the policy. Imām ʻAlī al-Hadī&#x27;s growing reputation inspired a letter from the Governor of Medina, ʻAbdu l-Lāh ibn Muħammad, suggesting that a coup was being plotted, and al-Mutawakkil extended an invitation to Samarra to the Imām, an offer he could not refuse. In Samarra, the Imām was kept under virtual house arrest and spied upon. However, no excuse to take action against him ever appeared. After al-Mutawakkil&#x27;s death, his successor had the Imām poisoned: al-Hadī is buried at Samarra. The general Shīʻa population faced repression. and this was embodied in the destruction of the shrine of Hussayn ibn ʻAlī, an action that was carried out ostensibly in order to stop pilgrimages to that site, and the flogging and incarceration of the Alid Yahya ibn Umar.

The caliph al-Mutawakkil had created a plan of succession that would allow his sons to inherit the caliphate after his death; he would be succeeded first by his eldest son, al-Muntasir, then by al-Mu&#x27;tazz and third by al-Mu&#x27;ayyad.

Also during his reign, al-Mutawakkil met the famous Byzantine theologian Cyril the Philosopher, who was sent to tighten the diplomatic relations between the Empire and the Caliphate in a state mission by the Emperor Michael III.
Of his sons, al-Muntasir succeeded him and ruled until his death in 862, al-Mu&#x27;tazz reigned as Caliph from 866 to his overthrow in 869, and al-Mu&#x27;tamid reigned as Caliph in 870–892 with his brother al-Muwaffaq serving as an effective regent of the realm until his death in 891.

==Family==
One of al-Mutawakkil&#x27;s wives was Farida. She belonged to the household of his brother caliph al-Wathiq, who kept her as a concubine and favorite although she belonged to the singer Amr ibn Banah. When al-Wathiq died, Amr presented her to al-Mutawakkil. He married her, and she became one of his favourites. Another wife was Sa&#x27;anin or Sha&#x27;anin. According to an anecdote from &quot;Adab al-ghuraba&quot;, a book usually attributed to Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani, she was a Christian and the daughter of a monk at a Syrian monastery in Homs. Al-Mutawakkil encountered her at the monastery. Enchanted by her beauty and grace, he was infatuated with her. This led to poignant moments with her where he sought her companionship and it turned out that she could sing and recite poetry. Al-Mutawakkil then married her, following her conversion to Islam, and she remained his favourite until his death.

Al-Mutawakkil is reputed to have four thousand concubines, all of whom shared his bed. One of his concubines (&quot;ummahat al-walad&quot;) was Hubshiya. She was a Greek, and was the mother of his eldest son, the caliph al-Muntasir. After her son&#x27;s death in 862, she commissioned a tomb for him in public view in Samarra, which made him the first Abbasid caliph whose burial place was not a secret. She died in 877. Another of his concubines was Ashar, also known by her teknonym, Umm Ishaq. She was an Andulasian and was one of his favourites. She was the mother of his sons Ibrahim al-Mu&#x27;ayyad and Abu Ahmad al-Muwaffaq. She died on 23 December 883 and was buried in al-Rusafa. Another concubine was Fityan. She was from Kufa and was the mother of caliph al-Mu&#x27;tamid. Another concubine was Qabiha. She was a Greek, and was the mother of caliph al-Mu&#x27;tazz, Isma&#x27;il and Qurb, known as Umm Abdullah. She was renowned for her poetry and her beauty, and was one of his favourites. She died in November–December 877. Another concubine was Lujayn. She commissioned a mosque in Samarra. Another concubine (&quot;hazaya&quot;) was Shajar. Al-Mutawakkil was devoted to her, preferring her over all his concubines. On one Mehregan Day, Shajar&#x27;s gift of twenty gazelles with Chinese saddles, each carrying gold-latticed bags of precious scents, impressed him. Envious, his concubines plotted to kill her with a poisoned drink, leading to her demise. Another concubine (&quot;jariya&quot;) was Sahib. She possessed both beauty and impeccable manners. However, a mishap involving a servant resulted in one of her front teeth being broken, which subsequently turned black, diminishing her appeal in al-Mutawakkil&#x27;s estimation. Consequently, he bestowed her to his close companion Abu Abdullah ibn Hamdun, providing her with all her belongings. Following Abu Abdullah&#x27;s passing, she married an Alid, Ali ibn Yahya al-Munajjim.

Al-Mutwakkil had taken several courtesans (&quot;qiyan&quot;) as concubines. One of them was Fadl. She was a poet. She was from Basrah and was born in al-Yamama. She was from the Abd al-Qays tribe. She was purchased by Muhammad ibn al-Faraj al-Rukhkhaji, who gave her to al-Mutawakkil. She had a dark complexion, was cultured, articulate, and quick-witted. She died in 870–71. Another concubine was Mahbuba. She was born in Basrah. She was a poet and a singer. She had been given to al-Mutawakkil by Ubaydullah ibn Tahir, when he became caliph, as one of a group of four hundred slaves. She was one of his favourites. After al-Mutawakkil&#x27;s death she became the property of Wasif, 
whom she angered, whereupon Bugha asked for her and freed her. She then went to Baghdad, where she lived in anonymity and eventually passed away due to sorrow. Another concubine was Mulah. She was a poet and was related to the poet Shāriyah. She was known by her epithet &quot;al-Attarah&quot; because she made a great use of perfume (&quot;attar&quot;). Another concubine was Najla. She was known for her beauty and singing. After al-Mutawakkil&#x27;s death, caliph al-Musta&#x27;in married her to Utamish. Another concubine was Rayya al-Madaniyya. She was a poet. She and another concubine, Zamya al-Hamadaniyya, who was also a poet, were brought from al-Yamama and sold to al-Mutawakkil. Upon seeing them, he requested they recite a poem mentioning him and his conquests. Both Rayya and Zamya complied, and Rayya&#x27;s performance pleased him, leading him to keep her. When Zamya asked why he didn&#x27;t choose her, he mentioned her freckles, which he saw as a flaw, but her cleverly crafted poetry changed his perception, leading him to ultimately choose her too. Another concubine was Nashib. She was famous for her exceptional singing skills and imaginative talent. Some other concubines were Bunan, a poet, and Zajir.

Al-Mutawakkil had three more sons, Abu&#x27;l-Hassan, who died in 885, Abu Isa Abdullah, who was a musician and a composer, and who was killed in 892, and Ishaq.

==Death==

Al-Mutawakkil continued to rely on Turkic statesmen and slave soldiers to put down rebellions and lead battles against foreign empires, notably the Byzantines. His secretary, al-Fath ibn Khaqan, who was Turkic, was a famous figure of al-Mutawakkil&#x27;s era. His reliance on Turkic soldiers would come back to haunt him. Al-Mutawakkil would have his Turkic commander-in-chief killed. This, coupled with his extreme attitudes towards the Shia, made his popularity decline rapidly.

Al-Mutawakkil had appointed his oldest son, al-Muntasir, as his heir in 849/50, but slowly had shifted his favor to his second son, al-Mu&#x27;tazz, encouraged by al-Fath ibn Khaqan and the vizier Ubayd Allah ibn Yahya ibn Khaqan. This rivalry extended into the political sphere, as al-Mu&#x27;tazz&#x27;s succession appears to have been backed by the traditional Abbasid elites as well, while al-Muntasir was backed by the Turkic and &quot;Maghariba&quot; guard troops. In late autumn 861, matters came to a head: in October, al-Mutawakkil ordered the estates of the Turkic general Wasif to be confiscated and handed over to al-Fath. Feeling backed into a corner, the Turkic leadership began a plot to assassinate the Caliph. They were soon joined, or at least had the tacit approval, of al-Muntasir, who smarted from a succession of humiliations: on 5 December, on the recommendation of al-Fath and Ubayd Allah, he was bypassed in favor of al-Mu&#x27;tazz for leading the Friday prayer at the end of Ramadan, while three days later, when al-Mutawakkil was feeling ill and chose al-Muntasir to represent him on the prayer, once again Ubayd Allah intervened and persuaded the Caliph to go in person. Even worse, according to al-Tabari, on the next day, al-Mutawakkil alternately vilified and threatened to kill his eldest son, and even had al-Fath slap him on the face. With rumors circulating that Wasif and the other Turkish leaders would be rounded up and executed on 12 December, the conspirators decided to act.

According to al-Tabari, a story later circulated that al-Fath and Ubayd Allah were forewarned of the plot by a Turkic woman, but had disregarded it, confident that no one would dare carry it out. On the night of 10/11 December, about one hour after midnight, the Turks burst in the chamber where the Caliph and al-Fath were having supper. Al-Fath was killed trying to protect the Caliph, who was killed next. Al-Muntasir, who now assumed the caliphate, initially claimed that al-Fath had murdered his father and that he had been killed after; within a short time, however, the official story changed to al-Mutawakkil choking on his drink. The murder of al-Mutawakkil began the tumultuous period known as &quot;Anarchy at Samarra&quot;, which lasted until 870 and brought the Abbasid Caliphate to the brink of collapse.

==Legacy==

The Caliphate of al-Mutawakkil is remembered for its many reforms and is viewed as a golden age of the Abbasids. He would be the last great Abbasid caliph; after his death the dynasty would fall into a decline. After his death, the Caliphate built by Rashidun, Umayyad and Early Abbasids also declined as a world power.

Al-Mutawakkil was praised by many contemporary scholars.
The famous scholar al-Taymi said:

Ali ibn al-Jahm said:
Ali ibn Ismail said:
Al-Mutawakkil nominated his three sons as heir. Al-Muntasir was nominated first, al-Mu&#x27;tazz was nominated second heir and third was al-Mu&#x27;ayyad.
Al-Muntasir became caliph on 11 December 861, after his father al-Mutawakkil was assassinated by members of his Turkic guard. Although he was suspected of being involved in the plot to kill al-Mutawakkil, he was able to quickly take control of affairs in the capital city of Samarra and receive the oath of allegiance from the leading men of the state. Al-Muntasir&#x27;s sudden elevation to the Caliphate served to benefit several of his close associates, who gained senior positions in the government after his ascension. Included among these were his secretary, Ahmad ibn al-Khasib, who became vizier, and Wasif, a senior Turkic general who had likely been heavily involved in al-Mutawakkil&#x27;s murder. His reign lasted less than half a year; it ended with his death from unknown causes on Sunday, 7 June 862, at the age of 24 years. During al-Muntasir&#x27;s short reign (r. 861–862), the Turks pressured him into removing al-Mu&#x27;tazz and al-Mu&#x27;ayyad from the succession. When al-Muntasir died, the Turkic officers gathered together and decided to install the dead caliph&#x27;s cousin al-Musta&#x27;in (Son of his brother Muhammad) on the throne. The new caliph was almost immediately faced with a large riot in Samarra in support of the disenfranchised al-Mu&#x27;tazz; the rioters were put down by the military but casualties on both sides were heavy. Al-Musta&#x27;in, worried that al-Mu&#x27;tazz or al-Mu&#x27;ayyad could press their claims to the caliphate, first attempted to buy them off and then threw them in prison. In 866 his nephew al-Musta&#x27;in was killed by his son al-Mu&#x27;tazz after Fifth Fitna. Al-Mu&#x27;tazz&#x27;s reign marks the apogee of the decline of the Caliphate&#x27;s central authority, and the climax of centrifugal tendencies, expressed through the emergence of the autonomous dynasties in the Abbasid Caliphate. Finally, unable to meet the financial demands of the Turkic troops, in mid-July a palace coup deposed al-Mu&#x27;tazz. He was imprisoned and maltreated to such an extent that he died after three days, on 16 July 869. He was succeeded by his cousin al-Muhtadi. He ruled until 870 until he was murdered on 21 June 870, and replaced by his cousin, al-Mu&#x27;tamid ().

=== In popular culture ===
Al-Mutawakkil is featured in the prologue of the video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Mirage&quot;, in which the caliph is serving as a puppet for the Order of the Ancients, a secret society devoted to restoring humanity to servitude. He initially protects a Precursor relic on their behalf, but when the game&#x27;s protagonist Basim attempts to steal it, he fights the young thief and his friend Nehal, who stabs the caliph with his own dagger. His death allows the Order to gain more control in Baghdad, prompting the game&#x27;s plot, which follows along with the Anarchy at Samarra.

<text>Samosir, or Samosir Island, is a large volcanic island in Lake Toba, located in North Sumatra Province on the island of Sumatra in Indonesia. Administratively, Samosir Island is governed as six of the nine districts within Samosir Regency. The lake and island were formed after the eruption of the Toba supervolcano some 75,000 years ago. 

At , Samosir is the largest island within an island and the fourth largest lake island in the world. It also contains two smaller lakes, Lake Sidihoni and . Across the lake on the east of the island lies the Uluan Peninsula. The island was historically linked to the mainland of Sumatra on its western part by a narrow isthmus connecting the town of Pangururan on Samosir and Tele on mainland Sumatra, but it was split by the Tano Ponggol Canal and bridge in 1906, which was widened in 2019. Tele consequently offers one of the best views of Lake Toba and Samosir Island. One of the most important objects on the island is a Lutheran church, and opposite it is a huge hill.

==Tourism==
Samosir is a popular tourist destination due to its exotic history and the vistas it offers. The tourist resorts are concentrated in the area. The island is the centre of the Batak culture and many of the Toba Batak traditional houses (rumah adat) remain on the island. Most of the tourist accommodations are concentrated in the small town of Tuktuk, which is located a one-hour ferry ride across the lake from the town of Parapat. The passenger ferry leaves from Tiga Raja harbor every hour between 8.30 and 19.00. For those running late, there is an option to take the passenger boat from Ajibata to Tomok until 8.30 pm. A car ferry leaves the mainland from Ajibata and lands in the small town of Tomok, about a 10-minute drive from Tuktuk until 9 pm. There are also other passenger ferries and individual hotels may also have ferries available.

<text>Johnny Leonard Roosevelt &quot;Pepper&quot; Martin (February 29, 1904 – March 5, 1965) was an American professional baseball player and minor league manager. He was known as the &quot;Wild Horse of the Osage&quot; because of his daring, aggressive baserunning abilities. Martin played in Major League Baseball as a third baseman and an outfielder for the St. Louis Cardinals during the 1930s and early 1940s. He was best known for his heroics during the 1931 World Series, in which he was the catalyst in a Cardinals&#x27; upset victory over the Philadelphia Athletics.

Martin was an integral member of the Cardinals&#x27; teams of the 1930s that became known as the Gashouse Gang for their roguish behavior and practical jokes. Early in his career, he was labeled by some contemporary press reports as the next Ty Cobb because of his spirited, hustling style of play. However, because his headlong attitude on the playing field took a physical toll on his body, he never lived up to those initial expectations. After the end of his playing career, he continued his career in baseball as a successful minor league baseball manager. In 2017, Martin was inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame.

==Baseball career==

===Early career===
Born in Temple, Oklahoma, Martin moved to Oklahoma City with his parents at the age of six where he grew up playing baseball. He began his professional baseball career at the age of 19 when he signed to play as a shortstop in the Oklahoma State League for a team in Guthrie, Oklahoma. When the league folded in 1924, his contract was sold to the Greenville Hunters of the East Texas League. In 1925, he posted a .340 batting average in 98 games for the Hunters and his contract was acquired by the St. Louis Cardinals to play for their Western Association affiliate, the Fort Smith Twins. He continued to post batting averages above the .300 mark. In 1927, Martin hit for a .306 average in 147 games with the Houston Buffaloes, earning him a promotion to the major leagues.

After spending five years in the minor leagues, Martin made his major league debut with the Cardinals on April 16, 1928 at the age of 24. He posted a .308 batting average in 39 games as a utility player, helping the Cardinals win the National League pennant. Martin made one appearance as a pinch runner in the 1928 World Series, when the Cardinals lost in four straight games to the New York Yankees. Despite his respectable batting average, Martin was sent back to the Houston Buffaloes in January 1929 where he hit for a .298 batting average. The following season, he was promoted to the Rochester Red Wings where his offensive statistics improved with 20 home runs, a .363 batting average and a .631 slugging percentage, helping the Red Wings win the 1930 International League title. The Red Wings then defeated the Louisville Colonels of the American Association to win the Junior World Series.

Martin&#x27;s performance earned him a return to the major leagues with the Cardinals in 1931. When veteran center fielder Taylor Douthit went into a hitting slump, Martin replaced him and played well enough that Cardinals&#x27; president, Branch Rickey, traded Douthit to the Cincinnati Reds in June. Martin impressed observers with his hustle in the outfield as well as on the base paths where he often slid into bases head-first. He ended the year with a .300 batting average along with seven home runs and 75 runs batted in to help the Cardinals clinch the 1931 National League pennant by 13 games over the New York Giants.

===World Series star===
The 1931 World Series was a rematch of the previous year&#x27;s participants, pitting the Cardinals against the Philadelphia Athletics. Led by Connie Mack, the Athletics had won the previous two World Series and were heavily favored to win for a third consecutive year. They featured a lineup that included five future National Baseball Hall of Fame members in Mickey Cochrane, Jimmie Foxx, Lefty Grove, Waite Hoyt and Al Simmons.

In Game 1 held at Sportsman&#x27;s Park in St. Louis, Martin had three hits, including a double, a stolen base and drove in one run in a 6–2 loss to the ace of the Athletics staff, 31-game winning pitcher Lefty Grove. Martin proved to be the difference in Game 2 in what was otherwise a tight pitching duel between Bill Hallahan of the Cardinals and George Earnshaw for the Athletics. He scored the first run of the game in the second inning by stretching a single into a double when the ball was mishandled in the outfield, stealing third base, and then scoring on a sacrifice fly. Martin added another run in the seventh inning when he hit a single, stole second base, took third base on a fielder&#x27;s choice, and then scored on a squeeze bunt. Those would be the only runs of the game as Hallahan pitched a three-hit shutout to even the series at one win apiece.

The series then moved to Shibe Park in Philadelphia for Game 3, where Martin had two hits, including a double and scored twice in a 5–2 Cardinals&#x27; victory over Grove. In Game 4, he produced the only two hits by the Cardinals as they lost to Earnshaw, 3–0. Martin almost single-handedly provided the offense for the Cardinals in Game 5, driving home four runs with two singles, a home run and a sacrifice fly, as the Cardinals triumphed 5–1. Although he was held hitless in the final two games of the series, he made an impressive catch to extinguish an Athletics two-run rally in the ninth inning of Game 7 to end the game and clinch the world championship for the Cardinals.

He set a then record 12 hits in the series, including four doubles, a home run, five stolen bases and five runs batted in. Martin&#x27;s .500 series batting average may have made the difference in the series outcome, as without him the Cardinals batted just .205 as a team. During the series, Martin was asked how he had learned to run so fast; he replied, &quot;I grew up in Oklahoma, and once you start runnin&#x27; out there there ain&#x27;t nothin&#x27; to stop you&quot;. Longtime major league manager, John McGraw, described Martin&#x27;s performance as &quot;the greatest individual performance in the history of the World Series&quot;. In December, he was selected as male athlete of the year by the Associated Press.

===Later career===
Martin experienced an injury-plagued season in 1932, missing several weeks when he dislocated his shoulder in April and missed a month and a half when he broke a finger in July while sliding into home plate. In August, Cardinals manager Gabby Street converted Martin into a third baseman in an attempt to fill the gap left by the injured Sparky Adams. Martin was not a naturally gifted third baseman, often fielding balls after having stopped them with his chest. He ended the season with a .238 batting average with four home runs and 34 runs batted in as the Cardinals fell to seventh place in the National League.
Having rebounded from his injuries, in 1933 Martin was leading the league in hitting with a .363 batting average in the middle of June, earning him a starting role as the third baseman for the National League team in the inaugural Major League Baseball All-Star Game held on July 6, 1933. Now hitting as the Cardinals&#x27; leadoff hitter, he finished the season ranked sixth in the league with a career-high .316 average and led the league with 122 runs scored and 26 stolen bases. Martin ranked tenth in the league with a .456 slugging percentage, and he had a career-high .387 on-base percentage along with 36 doubles, 12 triples and eight home runs as the Cardinals improved to a fifth-place finish. He came in fifth place in the voting results for the 1933 National League Most Valuable Player Award.

Martin&#x27;s batting average dropped to .289 in 1934, but he once again led the league in stolen bases as the Cardinals rallied from seven games behind the New York Giants in early September to win the National League pennant on the last day of the season. He made an appearance as a relief pitcher on August 19, allowing one hit in two innings pitched. In a memorable 1934 World Series against the Detroit Tigers, the Cardinals were down 3 games to 2, before rebounding to win the final two games. The series was highlighted by several rough plays on the base paths that culminated in Game 7, when Joe Medwick made a rough slide into Tigers&#x27; third baseman Marv Owen. The following inning, outraged Detroit fans pelted Medwick with debris when he assumed his defensive position in the outfield. The disturbance wasn&#x27;t quelled until the umpires appealed to Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis, who had Medwick removed from the game. Martin ended the series with 11 hits for a .355 average, stole two bases and scored eight runs in the series. He experienced difficulties in the field, committing 3 errors in Game 4 and setting a World Series record with four errors overall. While in a St. Louis hospital in December 1934, for a minor operation on his left arm, Martin insisted that he be entertained by a cowboy musical group that he had hired. He created such a disturbance among the other patients that the hospital staff moved him to an isolated wing. Martin, along with Cardinals teammates such as Leo Durocher, Dizzy Dean and Joe Medwick among others, became known as the 1934 Gashouse Gang due to their boisterous activities on and off the field. He played the guitar in a hillbilly band composed of Cardinals players named The Mudcat Band.

Although Martin had a good year offensively in 1935, he continued to struggle defensively at third base. In the midst of a tight pennant race in July, he committed three costly errors in a loss to the New York Giants, and ended the year with 30 errors. He was hitting for a .333 average by mid-season to earn the starting third baseman&#x27;s position in the 1935 All-Star Game. For the season, he hit for a .299 average with nine home runs and 54 runs batted in. In October, Martin underwent surgery again, this time on his right arm. In January 1936, Branch Rickey asked Martin to curtail his extra-curricular activities. Already well known as a hunting and fishing enthusiast, Martin had taken up the hobby of midget car racing and was also playing in football and basketball games during the winter months. He also became the vice-president and general manager of an Oklahoma City ice hockey team.

Martin moved back to the outfield, playing as the Cardinals&#x27; right fielder in 1936 as the Cardinals battled the New York Giants for the National League title before settling for second place. He responded with a good year offensively, hitting for a .309 average with career-highs in home runs (11) and in runs batted in (76). Martin also led the National League in stolen bases with 23. He continued to hit well by 1937, although he was relegated to a part-time role, as his spirited, headlong style of play took its toll on his body. At the beginning of the 1939 season, he was named as the Cardinals&#x27; team captain, taking the job from Leo Durocher, who had been traded to the Brooklyn Dodgers. He experienced a resurgence, leading the team with a .340 batting average in June before a sprained wrist put him out of action for two weeks. He ended the season with a .306 batting average in 88 games, helping the Cardinals to finish second in the National League. Martin hit for a respectable .316 average in 1940 before the Cardinals named him as the player-manager of the Sacramento Solons of the Pacific Coast League in October.

Martin led Sacramento to a second-place finish in 1941 before leading them to their first Pacific Coast League championship in 38 years in 1942. He then became a player-manager for the Rochester Red Wings in 1943. When professional baseball experienced a shortage of players during World War II, Martin returned to the major leagues in 1944 with the Cardinals at the age of 40. In 40 games with the Cardinals, he posted a .279 batting average and an impressive .386 on-base percentage to help the Cardinals clinch the 1944 National League pennant. Martin did not appear in the 1944 World Series, playing his final major league game on October 1, 1944.

==Career statistics==
In a 13-year major league career, Martin played in 1,189 games, accumulating 1,227 hits in 4,117 at bats for a .298 career batting average along with 756 runs, 270 doubles, 75 triples, .443 slugging percentage, 59 home runs, 501 runs batted in, 146 stolen bases, 369 bases on balls and an on-base percentage of .358. He retired with a .973 career fielding percentage in 613 games as an outfielder and a .927 fielding percentage in 429 games as a third baseman. A four-time All-Star, Martin&#x27;s World Series career batting average of .418 (23-for-55) is still a series record, and he is tied for 10th with seven World Series stolen bases. He led the National League three times in stolen bases and once in runs scored. On May 5, 1933, Martin hit for the cycle in a game against the Philadelphia Phillies at the Baker Bowl.

==Managerial career==

After the end of his major league career, Martin returned to the minor leagues, serving as a player-manager with the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League in 1945 and 1946 before becoming the player-manager for the Greenville Spinners of the South Atlantic League in 1947. His fiery, competitive nature was still evident in July 1945 when it was reported that he had punched one of his players for not performing to his standards. While managing the Miami Sun Sox of the Florida International League in 1949, he was fined and suspended for the remainder of the season for choking an umpire. In August 1951, he made news again when he was arrested after a Sun Sox game when he went into the stands to punch a spectator in Lakeland, Florida.

When the Sun Sox released him, Martin was hired to manage the Miami Beach Flamingos of the Florida International League in 1952. Despite leading them to a 103-49 record, the Flamingos finished the season one game behind his former team, the Sun Sox. In 1953, he became the manager of the Fort Lauderdale Lions and led them to the Florida International League title. After spending the 1954 season as the manager for the Portsmouth Merrimacs, Martin was named as a coach for the Chicago Cubs in September 1955. Stan Hack was fired as the Cubs manager when they finished in last place in the 1956 season, and the new Cubs manager, Bob Scheffing, asked for Martin&#x27;s resignation along with the rest of the coaching staff. Martin returned to the minor leagues once again where he became a player-coach for the Tulsa Oilers, playing his final game at the age of 54. He took his final field assignment as the manager of the Miami Marlins in 1959.

==Later life==
Before his death, Martin served briefly as the athletic director of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary at McAlester, Oklahoma. He died on March 5, 1965, after suffering a heart attack. His wife, Ruby, survived him by over four decades, dying just after her 99th birthday in 2009.

Martin was inducted into the Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame in 1992 and was enshrined into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame in 2017.

<text>Hiester Richard Hornberger Jr. (February 1, 1924 – November 4, 1997) was an American writer and surgeon who wrote under the pseudonym Richard Hooker. Hornberger&#x27;s best-known work is his novel &quot;&quot; (1968), based on his experiences as a wartime United States Army surgeon during the Korean War (1950–1953) and written in collaboration with W.C. Heinz. It was used as the basis for an award-winning, critically and commercially successful movie – &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; (1970) — and two years later in an acclaimed long running television series (1972–1983) of the same title.

== Early life and education ==
Born in Trenton, New Jersey, Hornberger attended the Peddie School in Hightstown. He graduated from Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, where he was an active member of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. He went to Cornell Medical School in New York City.

== Military experience ==
After graduating from medical school, he was drafted into the Korean War and assigned to the 8055 Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (M.A.S.H.). M.A.S.H. units, according to one doctor assigned to the unit, &quot;weren&#x27;t on the front lines, but they were close. They lived and worked in tents. It was hot in the summer and colder than cold in the winter.&quot; The operating room consisted of stretchers balanced on carpenter&#x27;s sawhorses.

Many of the M.A.S.H. doctors were in their twenties, with few having advanced surgical training. During battle campaigns, units could see &quot;as many as 1,000 casualties a day&quot;. &quot;What characterized the fighting in Korea&quot;, one of Hornberger&#x27;s fellow officers recalled, &quot;was that you would have a period of a week or ten days when nothing much was happening, then there would be a push. When you had a push, there would suddenly be a mass of casualties that would just overwhelm us.&quot; There were, another surgeon recalled, &quot;&#x27;long periods when not much of anything happened&#x27; in an atmosphere of apparent safety—plenty of time to play ... When things were quiet we would sit around and read. Sometimes the nurses would have a little dance.&quot; Hornberger&#x27;s later assessment of his unit&#x27;s behavior was: &quot;A few flipped their lids, but most just raised hell in a variety of ways and degrees.&quot;

A colleague described Hornberger as &quot;a very good surgeon with a tremendous sense of humor.&quot; Hornberger did label his tent &quot;The Swamp&quot; as do the characters in the novel.

== Private practice and writing career ==
After the war, Hornberger worked for the U.S. Veterans Administration, qualified for his surgical boards, and went into private practice in Waterville, Maine. Eventually, he settled into practice at Broad Cove in Bremen, Maine.

His experiences at the 8055th M.A.S.H. were the background for his novel &quot;&quot; (1968), which he worked on for eleven years. In 1956, he began attempting to put his memories into a book. In the 1960s, a visit with a former M.A.S.H. colleague and his wife — a nurse at the unit — led to a session of drinking and storytelling. Hornberger later claimed the evening gave him new motivation to finish his manuscript.

&quot;MASH&quot; was rejected by many publishers. He worked with the famed sportswriter W.C. Heinz to revise it. A year later, the book was acquired by William Morrow and Company. Published under Hornberger&#x27;s pseudonym, Richard Hooker, the novel was highly successful.

===&quot;MASH&quot; adaptations===
&quot;MASH&quot; was adapted as a film by the same name, directed by Robert Altman and released in 1970. It was nominated for five Academy Awards and won for Best Adapted Screenplay. According to writer John Baxter, Hornberger &quot;was so furious at having sold the film rights for only a few hundred dollars that he never again signed a copy of the book.&quot;

A TV series was developed, that debuted in 1972 and ran for eleven seasons with great popularity. Hornberger reportedly did not like Alan Alda&#x27;s portrayal of Hawkeye in the TV series, favoring the Robert Altman film, in which Pierce was played by Donald Sutherland.

===&quot;MASH&quot; sequels===
Hornberger wrote the sequels to &quot;MASH&quot; — &quot;M*A*S*H Goes to Maine&quot; (1972) and &quot;M*A*S*H Mania&quot; (1977) — neither of which enjoyed the commercial success of the original. While &quot;MASH&quot; was a fairly faithful reflection of Hornberger&#x27;s service in Korea, his sequels were diverse representations of the &quot;Swamp Gang&#x27;s&quot; post-Korea activities in the fictional town of Spruce Harbor, Maine, from 1953 to the 1970s. Attempts to adapt &quot;M*A*S*H Goes to Maine&quot; into a film met with failure.

The sequels are characterized by gentle humour, stereotypical local characters, and a nostalgic look at Maine and its people through Hornberger&#x27;s eyes. Throughout, the &quot;Swamp Gang&quot; prospers, gets its own way most of the time, and generally becomes more conservative as the years pass. The men play golf and are sometimes thorns in the side of &quot;the summer complaints&quot; (tourists) and local bigwigs.

A series of novels based on the franchise was published in between &quot;M*A*S*H Goes to Maine&quot; and &quot;M*A*S*H Mania&quot; in which the characters travel to various locations, including Moscow, New Orleans, San Francisco, and Paris. The books were credited to &quot;Richard Hooker and William E. Butterworth&quot;, although they were written entirely by Butterworth. They were hastily written to capitalize on the TV show&#x27;s popularity and were of dubious literary merit. The action was transposed to the 1970s so that people such as Henry Kissinger could be lampooned, but this would have made some of the characters quite old, if the descriptions in the first book were to be believed. For instance, Hot Lips would have been in her 60s, having been described as &quot;fortyish&quot; in the first novel.

== Later life and death ==
After the success of his book and its screen adaptations, Hornberger continued to practice as a surgeon in Waterville until his retirement in 1988. During the later years of his practice, Hornberger did medical research and published his research in peer-reviewed medical journals. He died at the age of 73 on November 4, 1997, of leukemia.

<text>American Zoetrope (also known as Omni Zoetrope from 1977 to 1980 and Zoetrope Studios from 1980 until 1990) is a privately run American film production company, centered in San Francisco, California and founded by Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas.

Opened on December 12, 1969, the studio has produced not only the films of Coppola (including &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; and &quot;Tetro&quot;), but also George Lucas&#x27;s pre-&quot;Star Wars&quot; film &quot;THX 1138&quot;, as well as many others by avant-garde directors such as Jean-Luc Godard, Akira Kurosawa, Wim Wenders and Godfrey Reggio. American Zoetrope was an early adopter of digital filmmaking, including some of the earliest uses of HDTV.

Four films produced by American Zoetrope are included in the American Film Institute&#x27;s Top 100 Films. American Zoetrope-produced films have received 15 Academy Awards and 68 nominations.
==History==
Initially located in a warehouse at 827 Folsom Street on the second floor of The Automatt building, the company&#x27;s headquarters have, since 1972, been in the historic Sentinel Building, at 916 Kearny Street in San Francisco&#x27;s North Beach neighborhood.

Coppola named the studio after a zoetrope he was given in the late 1960s by the filmmaker and collector of early film devices, Mogens Skot-Hansen. &quot;Zoetrope&quot; is also the name by which Coppola&#x27;s quarterly fiction magazine, &quot;&quot;, is often known.

In 1980, the company bought General Service Studios in Hollywood, California, and became Zoetrope Studios, to produce and distribute films, as did later DreamWorks studio.

In 1999, it signed a deal with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for a first-look financing and production agreement. In 2000, it signed a ten-year financing pact with VCL Film + Medien to handle foreign sales of their own titles.

By 2007, ownership of American Zoetrope had been passed to Coppola&#x27;s son and daughter, directors Roman Coppola and Sofia Coppola.

In 2010, Lionsgate announced a deal to distribute American Zoetrope films, including classics like &quot;The Conversation&quot; and &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, in North America on DVD, Blu-ray, electronic-sell-through, VOD as well as broadcast distribution rights. The only movies from the Coppola canon that won&#x27;t be released as part of the pact are &quot;The Godfather&quot; trilogy, which is owned by Paramount.

Zoetrope.com, the Coppola family&#x27;s website, was created around 1996 and became an online community for writers. In 2016, Francis Ford Coppola announced its relaunch as a &quot;virtual studio&quot;.

In 2024, American Zoetrope earned its first Tony Award for Best Musical as one of the producers of the 2023 stage musical adaptation of &quot;The Outsiders&quot;.

===Television series===

==Cafe Zoetrope==
In the building lobby, Coppola operates a small Italian café, Cafe Zoetrope, featuring Inglenook Estate wine and memorabilia from his films. Earlier, the building had been the location of Enrico Banducci&#x27;s &quot;hungry i&quot; nightclub.

The neighborhood is well known for its cafes and its writers. Coppola wrote much of the screenplay for &quot;The Godfather&quot; in the nearby Caffe Trieste and Lawrence Ferlinghetti&#x27;s City Lights Books is located up Columbus Avenue from the Sentinel Building.

<text>A pentagonal number is a figurate number that extends the concept of triangular and square numbers to the pentagon, but, unlike the first two, the patterns involved in the construction of pentagonal numbers are not rotationally symmetrical. The &quot;n&quot;th pentagonal number &quot;pn&quot; is the number of &quot;distinct&quot; dots in a pattern of dots consisting of the &quot;outlines&quot; of regular pentagons with sides up to n dots, when the pentagons are overlaid so that they share one vertex. For instance, the third one is formed from outlines comprising 1, 5 and 10 dots, but the 1, and 3 of the 5, coincide with 3 of the 10 – leaving 12 distinct dots, 10 in the form of a pentagon, and 2 inside.

&quot;p&quot;n is given by the formula:

:formula_1

for &quot;n&quot; ≥ 1. The first few pentagonal numbers are:

1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, 176, 210, 247, 287, 330, 376, 425, 477, 532, 590, 651, 715, 782, 852, 925, 1001, 1080, 1162, 1247, 1335, 1426, 1520, 1617, 1717, 1820, 1926, 2035, 2147, 2262, 2380, 2501, 2625, 2752, 2882, 3015, 3151, 3290, 3432, 3577, 3725, 3876, 4030, 4187... .

The &quot;n&quot;th pentagonal number is the sum of n integers starting from n (i.e. from n to 2n-1). The following relationships also hold:

:formula_2

Pentagonal numbers are closely related to triangular numbers. The &quot;n&quot;th pentagonal number is one third of the th triangular number. In addition, where Tn is the &quot;n&quot;th triangular number:

:formula_3
Generalized pentagonal numbers are obtained from the formula given above, but with &quot;n&quot; taking values in the sequence 0, 1, −1, 2, −2, 3, −3, 4..., producing the sequence:

0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 12, 15, 22, 26, 35, 40, 51, 57, 70, 77, 92, 100, 117, 126, 145, 155, 176, 187, 210, 222, 247, 260, 287, 301, 330, 345, 376, 392, 425, 442, 477, 495, 532, 551, 590, 610, 651, 672, 715, 737, 782, 805, 852, 876, 925, 950, 1001, 1027, 1080, 1107, 1162, 1190, 1247, 1276, 1335... .

Generalized pentagonal numbers are important to Euler&#x27;s theory of integer partitions, as expressed in his pentagonal number theorem.

The number of dots inside the outermost pentagon of a pattern forming a pentagonal number is itself a generalized pentagonal number.

==Other properties==
*formula_4 for n&gt;0 is the number of different compositions of formula_5 into n parts that don&#x27;t include 2 or 3.
*formula_4 is the sum of the first n natural numbers congruent to 1 mod 3.
*formula_7

==Generalized pentagonal numbers and centered hexagonal numbers==

Generalized pentagonal numbers are closely related to centered hexagonal numbers. When the array corresponding to a centered hexagonal number is divided between its middle row and an adjacent row, it appears as the sum of two generalized pentagonal numbers, with the larger piece being a pentagonal number proper:

In general:

:formula_8

where both terms on the right are generalized pentagonal numbers and the first term is a pentagonal number proper (&quot;n&quot; ≥ 1). This division of centered hexagonal arrays gives generalized pentagonal numbers as trapezoidal arrays, which may be interpreted as Ferrers diagrams for their partition. In this way they can be used to prove the pentagonal number theorem referenced above.
==Tests for pentagonal numbers==
Given a positive integer &quot;x&quot;, to test whether it is a (non-generalized) pentagonal number we can compute

:formula_9

The number &quot;x&quot; is pentagonal if and only if &quot;n&quot; is a natural number. In that case &quot;x&quot; is the &quot;n&quot;th pentagonal number.

For generalized pentagonal numbers, it is sufficient to just check if is a perfect square.

For non-generalized pentagonal numbers, in addition to the perfect square test, it is also required to check if

:formula_10

The mathematical properties of pentagonal numbers ensure that these tests are sufficient for proving or disproving the pentagonality of a number.

==Gnomon==
The Gnomon of the &quot;n&quot;th pentagonal number is:
:formula_11

== Square pentagonal numbers ==
A square pentagonal number is a pentagonal number that is also a perfect square.

The first few are:

0, 1, 9801, 94109401, 903638458801, 8676736387298001, 83314021887196947001, 799981229484128697805801, 7681419682192581869134354401, 73756990988431941623299373152801... (OEIS entry )

<text>The Daily News is an American newspaper based in Jersey City, New Jersey. It was founded in 1919 by Joseph Medill Patterson in New York City as the Illustrated Daily News.

It was the first U.S. daily printed in tabloid format. It reached its peak circulation in 1947, at 2.4 million copies a day. it was the eleventh-highest circulated newspaper in the United States. (Today&#x27;s &quot;Daily News&quot; is not connected to the earlier &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, which shut down in 1906.) For much of the 20th century, the paper operated out of the historic art deco Daily News Building with its large globe in the lobby.

The &quot;Daily News&quot; is owned by parent company Daily News Enterprises. This company is owned by Alden Global Capital and was formed when Alden, which also owns news media publisher Digital First Media, purchased then-owner Tribune Publishing in May 2021 and then separated the &quot;Daily News&quot; from Tribune to form Daily News Enterprises upon the closing of the Tribune acquisition.

==History==
===&quot;Illustrated Daily News&quot;===

The &quot;Illustrated Daily News&quot; was founded by Patterson and his cousin, Robert R. McCormick. The two were co-publishers of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and grandsons of Tribune Company founder Joseph Medill. as an imitation of the successful British newspaper &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;. When Patterson and McCormick could not agree on the editorial content of the Chicago paper, the two cousins decided at a meeting in Paris that Patterson would work on the project of launching a Tribune-owned newspaper in New York. On his return, Patterson met with Alfred Harmsworth, who was the Viscount Northcliffe and publisher of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, London&#x27;s tabloid newspaper. Impressed with the advantages of a tabloid, Patterson launched the &quot;Daily News&quot; on June 24, 1919 as &quot;Illustrated Daily News&quot;. The &quot;Daily News&quot; was owned by the Tribune Company until 1993.

===&quot;Daily News&quot;===
The &quot;Daily News&quot; was not an immediate success, and by August 1919, the paper&#x27;s circulation had dropped to 26,625. Still, many of New York&#x27;s subway commuters found the tabloid format easier to handle, and readership steadily grew. By the time of the paper&#x27;s first anniversary in June 1920, circulation had climbed over 100,000 and by 1925 over a million. Circulation reached its peak in 1947, at 2.4 million daily and 4.7 million on Sunday.

The &quot;Daily News&quot; carried the slogan &quot;New York&#x27;s Picture Newspaper&quot; from 1920 to 1991 for its emphasis on photographs. A camera has been part of the newspaper&#x27;s logo from day one. It became one of the first newspapers in New York City to employ a woman as a staff photographer in 1942 when Evelyn Straus was hired. The paper&#x27;s later slogan, developed from a 1985 ad campaign, is &quot;New York&#x27;s Hometown Newspaper&quot;, while another was &quot;The Eyes, the Ears, the Honest Voice of New York&quot;. The &quot;Daily News&quot; continues to include large and prominent photographs, for news, entertainment, and sports, as well as intense city news coverage, celebrity gossip, classified ads, comics, a sports section, and an opinion section.

News-gathering operations were, for a time, organized by staff using two-way radios operating on 173.3250 MHz (radio station KEA 871), allowing the assignment desk to communicate with its reporters who used a fleet of &quot;radio cars&quot;. Excelling in sports coverage, prominent sports cartoonists have included Bill Gallo, Bruce Stark, and Ed Murawinski. Columnists have included Walter Kaner. Editorial cartoonists have included C. D. Batchelor.

In 1948, the &quot;News&quot; established WPIX (Channel 11 in New York City), whose call letters were based on the &quot;News&quot;″s nickname of &quot;New York&#x27;s Picture Newspaper&quot;; and later bought what became WPIX-FM, which is now known as WFAN-FM. The television station became a Tribune property outright in 1991, and remains in the former Daily News Building. The radio station was purchased by Emmis Communications, and since 2014 has been owned by CBS Radio as an FM simulcast of its AM namesake.

The paper briefly published a Monday-Friday afternoon counterpart, &quot;Daily News Tonight&quot;, between August 19, 1980, and August 28, 1981; this competed with the &quot;New York Post&quot;, which had launched a morning edition to complement its evening newspaper in 1978. Occasional &quot;P.M. Editions&quot; were published as extras in 1991, during the brief tenure of Robert Maxwell as publisher.

From August 10, 1978, to November 5, 1978, the multi-union 1978 New York City newspaper strike shut down the three major New York City newspapers. No editions of the &quot;News&quot; were printed during this time.

In 1982 and again in the early 1990s during a newspaper strike, the &quot;Daily News&quot; almost went out of business. In the 1982 instance, the parent Tribune Company offered the tabloid up for sale. In 1991, millionaire Robert Maxwell offered financial assistance to the &quot;News&quot; to help it stay in business. Upon his death later that year, the &quot;News&quot; seceded from his publishing empire which soon splintered under questions about whether Maxwell had the financial backing to sustain it. Existing management, led by editor James Willse, held the &quot;News&quot; together in bankruptcy; Willse became interim publisher after buying the paper from the Tribune Company. Mort Zuckerman bought the paper in 1993.

The &quot;News&quot; at one time maintained local bureaus in the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens. The newspaper still shares offices at City Hall, and within One Police Plaza with other news agencies.

In January 2012, former &quot;News of the World&quot; and &quot;New York Post&quot; editor Colin Myler was appointed editor-in-chief of the &quot;Daily News&quot;. Myler was replaced by his deputy Jim Rich in September 2015.

, it was the ninth-most widely circulated daily newspaper in the United States. In 2019, it was ranked eleventh.

On September 4, 2017, Tronc (now Tribune Publishing), the publishing operations of the former Tribune Company (which had spun out its publishing assets to separate them from its broadcast assets), announced that it had acquired the &quot;Daily News&quot;. Tronc had bought the &quot;Daily News&quot; for $1, assuming &quot;operational and pension liabilities&quot;. By the time of purchase, circulation had dropped to 200,000 on weekdays and 260,000 on Sundays. In July 2018, Tronc fired half of the paper&#x27;s editorial staff, including the editor-in-chief, Jim Rich. Rich was replaced by Robert York, Publisher and Editor-in-Chief of Tronc-owned &quot;The Morning Call&quot; in Allentown, Pennsylvania. The paper&#x27;s social media staff were included in the cut; images and memes that were later deleted were posted on its Twitter feed.

Tribune Publishing was acquired by Alden Global Capital in May 2021. Upon the close of the deal, the &quot;Daily News&quot; was transferred to a separate company owned by Alden, Daily News Enterprises. In September 2021, editor Robert York left and was replaced on an interim basis by Andrew Julien, who also serves as the editor and publisher of &quot;The Hartford Courant&quot;.

The paper was also printed in a Sunday edition called &quot;Sunday News&quot;.

==Editorial stance and style==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; journalist Alan Feuer said the &quot;Daily News&quot; focuses heavily on &quot;deep sourcing and doorstep reporting&quot;, providing city-centered &quot;crime reportage and hard-hitting coverage of public issues [...] rather than portraying New York through the partisan divide between liberals and conservatives&quot;. According to Feuer, the paper is known for &quot;speaking to and for the city&#x27;s working class&quot; and for &quot;its crusades against municipal misconduct&quot;.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; has described the &quot;Daily News&quot;″s editorial stance as &quot;flexibly centrist&quot; with a &quot;high-minded, if populist, legacy&quot;. In contrast to its sister publication, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, the &quot;Daily News&quot; was pro-Roosevelt, endorsing him in 1932, 1936, and 1940. It broke from the president, however, in 1941 over foreign policy. From the 1940s through the 1960s, the &quot;Daily News&quot; espoused conservative populism. By the mid-1970s however, it began shifting its stance, and during the 1990s, it gained a reputation as a moderately liberal alternative to the conservative &quot;Post&quot; (which until 1980 had been a Democratic bastion).

The newspaper endorsed Republican George W. Bush in the 2004 presidential election, Democrat Barack Obama in 2008, Republican Mitt Romney in 2012, Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016, and Democrat Joe Biden in 2020.

==Headquarters==
From its founding, it was based at 25 City Hall Place, just north of City Hall, and close to Park Row, the traditional home of the city&#x27;s newspaper trade. In 1921 it moved to 23 Park Place, which was in the same neighborhood. The cramped conditions demanded a much larger space for the growing newspaper.

From 1929 to 1995, the &quot;Daily News&quot; was based in 220 East 42nd Street near Second Avenue, an official city and national landmark designed by John Mead Howells and Raymond Hood. The paper moved to 450 West 33rd Street (also known as 5 Manhattan West) in 1995, but the 42nd Street location is still known as The News Building and still features a giant globe and weather instruments in its lobby. (It was the model for the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; building of the first two &quot;Superman&quot; films). The former &quot;News&quot; subsidiary WPIX-TV remains in the building.

The subsequent headquarters of the &quot;Daily News&quot; at 450 West 33rd Street straddled the railroad tracks going into Pennsylvania Station. The building is now the world headquarters of the Associated Press and is part of Manhattan West.

In June 2011, the paper moved its operations to two floors at 4 New York Plaza in lower Manhattan. Sixteen months later, the structure was severely damaged and rendered uninhabitable by flooding from Hurricane Sandy. In the immediate aftermath, news operations were conducted remotely from several temporary locations, eventually moving to office space at the Jersey City printing plant. In early 2013, operations moved to rented space at 1290 Avenue of the Americas near Rockefeller Center—just four blocks north of its rival &quot;New York Post.&quot; The staff returned to the permanent 4 New York Plaza location in early November 2013. In August 2020, the &quot;Daily News&quot; closed its Manhattan headquarters.

==Printing facilities==
In 1993, the &quot;Daily News&quot; consolidated its printing facilities near Liberty State Park in Jersey City, New Jersey.

In 2009, the paper spent $150 million on printing presses as part of its change to full-color photographs.

In 2011, the company spent $100 million to buy three new presses, using a $41.7 million Urban Transit Hub Tax Credit from the State of New Jersey.

In 2022, the company plans to close its Jersey City printing plant and outsource its printing operations to North Jersey Media Group.

==Pulitzer Prizes==
The &quot;Daily News&quot; has won eleven Pulitzer Prizes.

In 1998, &quot;Daily News&quot; columnist Mike McAlary won the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary for his multi-part series of columns (published in 1997) on Abner Louima, who was sodomized and tortured by New York City police officers.

In 2007, the &quot;News&quot;&#x27; editorial board, which comprised Arthur Browne, Beverly Weintraub, and Heidi Evans, won the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing for a series of thirteen editorials, published over five months, that detailed how more than 12,000 rescue workers who responded after the September 11 attacks had become ill from toxins in the air. The Pulitzer citation said that the award was given to the paper &quot;for its compassionate and compelling editorials on behalf of Ground Zero workers, whose health problems were neglected by the city and the nation.&quot;

In 2017, the &quot;Daily News&quot; was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service in collaboration with non-profit ProPublica &quot;for uncovering, primarily through the work of reporter Sarah Ryley, widespread abuse of eviction rules by the police to oust hundreds of people, most of them poor minorities.&quot;

==Noteworthy front pages==
In 1928, a &quot;News&quot; reporter strapped a small camera to his leg, and shot a photo of Ruth Snyder being executed in the electric chair. The next day&#x27;s newspaper carried the headline &quot;DEAD!&quot;.

On October 29, 1975, President Gerald Ford gave a speech denying federal assistance to spare New York City from bankruptcy. The front page of the October 30, 1975 &quot;Daily News&quot; read: &quot;FORD TO CITY: DROP DEAD&quot;. Ford later said the headline had played a role in his losing the 1976 presidential election.

On November 16, 1995, the &quot;Daily News&quot; front page displayed an illustration of Newt Gingrich as a baby in a diaper with the headline &quot;Crybaby&quot; following revelations that Gingrich had shut down the government in retaliation for a perceived snub from Bill Clinton aboard Air Force One.

On May 12, 2003, the &quot;Daily News&quot; front page read &quot;JFK Had a Monica&quot;, reporting historian Robert Dallek&#x27;s book on JFK&#x27;s affair with a White House intern—long before the infamous Clinton-Lewinsky scandal just five years prior to the publication, and in turn, compelled the former intern, Mimi Alford, to come forward, and then &quot;Daily News&quot; ran another front page title on May 16, 2003, read &quot;Mimi Breaks Her Silence&quot;, and then another article the next day titled &quot;JFK &amp; MIMI: Why It Matters.&quot;

In the year leading up to the 2016 presidential election, the paper&#x27;s headlines became more provocative, helping to rejuvenate it, and with more opinionated editorials with the aforementioned headlines, once again in an effort to demonstrate its place in the city&#x27;s media.

Following the 2015 San Bernardino shooting, in which 14 people were killed, the paper&#x27;s front page displayed &quot;GOD ISN&#x27;T FIXING THIS&quot; along with tweets from Republican politicians offering thoughts and prayers. The paper advocated for tighter gun laws, condemning what it described as &quot;empty platitudes and angry rhetoric&quot; rather than action &quot;in response to the ongoing plague of gun violence in our country.&quot; The provocative headline received both praise and criticism.

In January 2016, after Republican senator and presidential candidate Ted Cruz of Texas disparaged &quot;New York values&quot; in a Republican primary debate, the &quot;News&quot; responded with a cover page headline reading &quot;DROP DEAD, TED&quot; and showing the Statue of Liberty giving the middle finger.

==Controversies==
The &quot;Daily News&quot; supported the Iraq War. On March 14, 2003, six days before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the &quot;Daily News&quot; reported &quot;President Bush is targeting an aggressive, dangerous, psychotic dictator who has stockpiled weapons of mass destruction and would use them without compunction. ... With Saddam in power, there can be no peace. One argument you hear raised against war is fear of retaliation: America mustn&#x27;t upset the terrorists. After 9/11, does this even need to be rebutted? Terrorists have killed thousands of Americans already and thirst for more. Fighting back is a necessity, unless people want the peace of the grave.&quot;

On December 20, 2016, &quot;Daily News&quot; columnist Gersh Kuntzman compared the assassination of the Russian Ambassador to Turkey, Andrei Karlov, to the assassination of Nazi German diplomat Ernst vom Rath by Jewish student Herschel Grynszpan, saying &quot;justice has been served.&quot; Russia has demanded an official apology from &quot;Daily News&quot;.

Since 2018, the &quot;Daily News&quot; has prevented internet users in the European Union from accessing its website, on grounds of missing data protection compliance.

==History==

The Roman fairs were holidays on which work and business such as law courts were suspended. In the Roman provinces of Judea and Syria Palaestina, Jewish rabbis prohibited Jews from participating in fairs in certain towns because the religious nature of the fairs contravened the prescribed practice of Judaism.

In the Middle Ages, many fairs developed as temporary markets and were especially important for long-distance and international trade, as wholesale traders travelled, sometimes for many days, to fairs where they could be sure to meet those they needed to buy from or sell to. The most famous were the Champagne fairs in northern France, which were spread over six towns for a total period of about six weeks, drawing goods and customers from much of Europe. The Frankfurt Book Fair in Germany, still the largest trade fair for the publishing industry, began in the 12th century as a fair for manuscript books. 

Fairs were usually tied to special Christian feast days, such as the day of the saint of the local church. Stagshaw in England, is documented to have held annual fairs as early as 1293 consisting of the sales of animals. Along with the main fair held on 4 July, the city also hosted smaller fairs throughout the year where specific types of animals were sold, such as one for horses, one for lambs, and one for ewes.

The Kumbh Mela, held every twelve years, at Allahabad, Haridwar, Nashik, and Ujjain is one of the largest fairs in India, where more than 60 million people gathered in January 2001, making it the largest gathering anywhere in the world. &quot;Kumbha&quot; means a pitcher and &quot;Mela&quot; means &quot;fair&quot; in Sanskrit.

In the United States, fairs draw in as many as 150 million people each summer. Children&#x27;s competitions at an American fair range from breeding small animals to robotics, whilst the organizations National FFA Organization &amp; 4-H have become the traditional associations.

==Sirsi Fair==

The Sirsi Marikamba Devi Fair of the deity is held every alternate year in the month of March and taken through the city Sirsi, Karnataka. It is attended by a very large number of devotees. It is also most famous and biggest fair (Jaatre) of the India. Devotees from all around the state participate in this enormous event indulging themselves in the procession. Amusements for children, circuses, variety of shops, dramas and plays and many such things are set up for the people. It depicts the story of the goddess killing Mahishasura.

==Legacy==

===Legal implications===

Fairs attracted great numbers of people and they often resulted in public order issues and sometimes riots. The holding of fairs was, therefore, granted by royal charter. Initially they were only allowed in towns and places where order could be maintained due to the presence of a bishop, sheriff or governor. Later various benefits were granted to specific fairs, such as the granting of a holiday status to a fair or protections against arrest for specific laws for the duration of the fair. Officials were authorised to mete out justice to those who attended their fair; this led to even the smallest fair having a court to adjudicate on offences and disputes arising within the fairground. These courts were called a &quot;pye powder&quot; court (from Old French &quot;pieds pouldres&quot;, literally &quot;dusty feet&quot;, meaning an itinerant trader, from Medieval Latin &quot;pedes pulverosi&quot;).

===In art and language===
The chaotic nature of the Stagshaw Bank Fair with masses of people and animals and stalls inspired the Newcastle colloquialism &quot;like a Stagey Bank Fair&quot; to describe a general mess.

The American county fair is featured in E. B. White&#x27;s &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot;.

<text>A public address system (or PA system) is an electronic system comprising microphones, amplifiers, loudspeakers, and related equipment. It increases the apparent volume (loudness) of a human voice, musical instrument, or other acoustic sound source or recorded sound or music. PA systems are used in any public venue that requires that an announcer, performer, etc. be sufficiently audible at a distance or over a large area. Typical applications include sports stadiums, public transportation vehicles and facilities, and live or recorded music venues and events. A PA system may include multiple microphones or other sound sources, a mixing console to combine and modify multiple sources, and multiple amplifiers and loudspeakers for louder volume or wider distribution.

Simple PA systems are often used in small venues such as school auditoriums, churches, and small bars. PA systems with many speakers are widely used to make announcements in public, institutional and commercial buildings and locations—such as schools, stadiums, and passenger vessels and aircraft. Intercom systems, installed in many buildings, have both speakers throughout a building, and microphones in many rooms so occupants can respond to announcements. PA and Intercom systems are commonly used as part of an emergency communication system.

The term &quot;sound reinforcement system&quot; generally means a PA system used specifically for live music or other performances. In Britain, PA systems are often known as tannoys after a company of that name that supplied many of the systems used there.

==Early systems==
===Megaphone===


From the Ancient Greek era to the nineteenth century, before the invention of electric loudspeakers and amplifiers, megaphone cones were used by people speaking to a large audience, to make their voice project more to a large space or group. Megaphones are typically portable, usually hand-held, cone-shaped acoustic horns used to amplify a person&#x27;s voice or other sounds and direct it towards a given direction. The sound is introduced into the narrow end of the megaphone, by holding it up to the face and speaking into it. The sound projects out the wide end of the cone. The user can direct the sound by pointing the wide end of the cone in a specific direction. In the 2020s, cheerleading is one of the few fields where a nineteenth century-style cone is still used to project the voice. The device is also called &quot;speaking-trumpet&quot;, &quot;bullhorn&quot; or &quot;loud hailer&quot;.

===Automatic Enunciator===

In 1910, the Automatic Electric Company of Chicago, Illinois, already a major supplier of automatic telephone switchboards, announced it had developed a loudspeaker, which it marketed under the name of the &quot;Automatic Enunciator&quot;. Company president Joseph Harris foresaw multiple potential uses, and the original publicity stressed the value of the invention as a hotel public address system, allowing people in all public rooms to hear announcements. In June 1910, an initial &quot;semi-public&quot; demonstration was given to newspaper reporters at the Automatic Electric Company building, where a speaker&#x27;s voice was transmitted to loudspeakers placed in a dozen locations &quot;all over the building&quot;.

A short time later, the Automatic Enunciator Company formed in Chicago order to market the new device, and a series of promotional installations followed. In August 1912 a large outdoor installation was made at a water carnival held in Chicago by the Associated Yacht and Power Boat Clubs of America. Seventy-two loudspeakers were strung in pairs at forty-foot (12 meter) intervals along the docks, spanning a total of one-half mile (800 meters) of grandstands. The system was used to announce race reports and descriptions, carry a series of speeches about &quot;The Chicago Plan&quot;, and provide music between races.

In 1913, multiple units were installed throughout the Comiskey Park baseball stadium in Chicago, both to make announcements and to provide musical interludes, with Charles A. Comiskey quoted as saying: &quot;The day of the megaphone man has passed at our park.&quot; The company also set up an experimental service, called the Musolaphone, that was used to transmitted news and entertainment programming to home and business subscribers in south-side Chicago, but this effort was short-lived. The company continued to market the enunciators for making announcements in establishments such as hospitals, department stores, factories, and railroad stations, although the Automatic Enunciator Company was dissolved in 1926.

===Magnavox===

Peter Jensen and Edwin Pridham of Magnavox began experimenting with sound reproduction in the 1910s. Working from a laboratory in Napa, California, they filed the first patent for a moving coil loudspeaker in 1911. Four years later, in 1915, they built a dynamic loudspeaker with a voice coil, a corrugated diaphragm and a horn measuring with a aperture. The electromagnet created a flux field of approximately 11,000 Gauss.

Their first experiment used a carbon microphone. When the 12 V battery was connected to the system, they experienced one of the first examples of acoustic feedback, a typically unwanted effect often characterized by high-pitched sounds. They then placed the loudspeaker on the laboratory&#x27;s roof, and claims say that the amplified human voice could be heard away. Jensen and Pridham refined the system and connected a phonograph to the loudspeaker so it could broadcast recorded music. They did this on a number of occasions, including once at the Napa laboratory, at the Panama–Pacific International Exposition, and on December 24, 1915, at San Francisco City Hall alongside Mayor James Rolph. This demonstration was official presentation of the working system, and approximately 100,000 people gathered to hear Christmas music and speeches &quot;with absolute distinctness&quot;.

The first outside broadcast was made one week later, again supervised by Jensen and Pridham. On December 30, when Governor of California Hiram Johnson was too ill to give a speech in person, loudspeakers were installed at the Civic Auditorium in San Francisco, connected to Johnson&#x27;s house some miles away by cable and a microphone, from where he delivered his speech. Jensen oversaw the governor using the microphone while Pridham operated the loudspeaker.

The following year, Jensen and Pridham applied for a patent for what they called their &quot;Sound Magnifying Phonograph&quot;. Over the next two years they developed their first valve amplifier. In 1919 this was standardized as a 3-stage 25 watt amplifier.

This system was used by former US president William Howard Taft at a speech in Grant Park, Chicago, and first used by a current president when Woodrow Wilson addressed 50,000 people in San Diego, California. Wilson&#x27;s speech was part of his nationwide tour to promote the establishment of the League of Nations. It was held on September 9, 1919, at City Stadium. As with the San Francisco installation, Jensen supervised the microphone and Pridham the loudspeakers. Wilson spoke into two large horns mounted on his platform, which channelled his voice into the microphone. Similar systems were used in the following years by Warren G. Harding and Franklin D. Roosevelt.

===Marconi===

By the early 1920s, Marconi had established a department dedicated to public address and began producing loudspeakers and amplifiers to match a growing demand. In 1925, George V used such a system at the British Empire Exhibition, addressing 90,000 via six long-range loudspeakers. This public use of loudspeakers brought attention to the possibilities of such technology. The 1925 Royal Air Force Pageant at Hendon Aerodrome used a Marconi system to allow the announcer to address the crowds, as well as amplify the band. In 1929, the Schneider Trophy race at Calshot Spit used a public address system that had 200 horns, weighing a total of 20 tons.

===Late 1920s–1930s===
Engineers invented the first loud, powerful amplifier and speaker systems for public address systems and movie theaters. These large PA systems and movie theatre sound systems were very large and very expensive, and so they could not be used by most touring musicians. After 1927, smaller, portable AC mains-powered PA systems that could be plugged into a regular wall socket &quot;quickly became popular with musicians&quot;; indeed, &quot;... Leon McAuliffe (with Bob Wills) still used a carbon mic and a portable PA as late as 1935.&quot; During the late 1920s to mid-1930s, small portable PA systems and guitar combo amplifiers were fairly similar. These early amps had a &quot;single volume control and one or two input jacks, field coil speakers&quot; and thin wooden cabinets; remarkably, these early amps did not have tone controls or even an on-off switch. Portable PA systems that could be plugged into wall sockets appeared in the early 1930s, when the introduction of electrolytic capacitors and rectifier tubes enabled economical built-in power supplies that could plug into wall outlets. Previously, amplifiers required heavy multiple battery packs.

===Electric megaphone===

In the 1960s, an electric-amplified version of the megaphone, which used a loudspeaker, amplifier and a folded horn, largely replaced the basic cone-style megaphone. Small handheld, battery-powered electric megaphones are used by fire and rescue personnel, police, protesters, and people addressing outdoor audiences. With many small handheld models, the microphone is mounted at the back end of the device, and the user holds the megaphone in front of her/his mouth to use it, and presses a trigger to turn on the amplifier and loudspeaker. Larger electric megaphones may have a microphone attached by a cable, which enables a person to speak without having their face obscured by the flared horn.

==Small systems==

The simplest, smallest PA systems consist of a microphone, an amplifier, and one or more loudspeakers. PA systems of this type, often providing 50 to 200 watts of power, are often used in small venues such as school auditoriums, churches, and coffeehouse stages. Small PA systems may extend to an entire building, such as a restaurant, store, elementary school or office building. A sound source such as a compact disc player or radio may be connected to a PA system so that music can be played through the system. Smaller, battery-powered 12 volt systems may be installed in vehicles such as tour buses or school buses, so that the tour guide and/or driver can speak to all the passengers. Portable systems may be battery powered and/or powered by plugging the system into an electric wall socket. These may also be used for by people addressing smaller groups such as information sessions or team meetings. Battery-powered systems can be used by guides who are speaking to clients on walking tours.

Public address systems consist of input sources (microphones, sound playback devices, etc.), amplifiers, control and monitoring equipment (e.g., LED indicator lights, VU meters, headphones), and loudspeakers. Usual input include microphones for speech or singing, direct inputs from musical instruments, and a recorded sound playback device. In non-performance applications, there may be a system that operators or automated equipment uses to select from a number of standard prerecorded messages. These input sources feed into preamplifiers and signal routers that direct the audio signal to selected zones of a facility (e.g., only to one section of a school). The preamplified signals then pass into the amplifiers. Depending on local practices, these amplifiers usually amplify the audio signals to 50 V, 70 V, or 100 V speaker line level. Control equipment monitors the amplifiers and speaker lines for faults before it reaches the loudspeakers. This control equipment is also used to separate zones in a PA system. The loudspeaker converts electrical signals into sound.

==Large systems==

Some PA systems have speakers that cover more than one building, extending to an entire campus of a college, office or industrial site, or an entire outdoor complex (e.g., an athletic stadium). A large PA system may also be used as an alert system during an emergency.

PA systems by size and subwoofer approach

==Telephone paging systems==
Some private branch exchange (PBX) telephone systems use a paging facility that acts as a liaison between the telephone and a PA amplifier. In other systems, paging equipment is not built into the telephone system. Instead the system includes a separate paging controller connected to a trunk port of the telephone system. The paging controller is accessed as either a designated directory number or central office line. In many modern systems, the paging function is integrated into the telephone system, so the system can send announcements to the phone speakers.

Many retailers and offices choose to use the telephone system as the sole access point for the paging system, because the features are integrated. Many schools and other larger institutions are no longer using the large, bulky microphone PA systems and have switched to telephone system paging, as it can be accessed from many different points in the school.

==PA over IP==
PA over IP are PA paging and intercom systems that use an Internet Protocol (IP) network, instead of a central amplifier, to distribute the audio signal to paging locations across a building or campus, or anywhere else in the reach of the IP network, including the Internet. Network-attached amplifiers and intercom units are used to provide the communication function. At the transmission end, a computer application transmits a digital audio stream via the local area network, using audio from the computer&#x27;s sound card inputs or from stored audio recordings. At the receiving end, either specialized intercom modules (sometimes known as IP speakers) receive these network transmissions and reproduce the analog audio signal. These are small, specialized network appliances addressable by an IP address, just like any other computer on the network.

==2-way radio wireless PA==
A 2-way radio wireless PA receiver and horn speaker is designed to facilitate the direct delivery of voice messages from a base station or mobile 2-way radio to a PA speaker located at distances that can measure in miles. The receiver and PA speaker combination is ideal in situations where traditional hard-wired PA installations are impractical, prohibitively expensive, or temporary. These receivers operate in business-band UHF and VHF 2-way licensed frequency bands, or in the MURS unlicensed frequencies. Installation requires setting the frequency you want to use on both the radio and the PA system, plus powering the wireless PA receivers. 

==WMT PA systems==
Wireless mobile telephony (WMT) PA systems are PA paging and intercom systems that use any form of wireless mobile telephony system such as GSM networks instead of a centralized amplifier to distribute the audio signal to paging locations across a building or campus, or other location. The GSM mobile networks are used to provide the communication function. At the transmission end, a PSTN Telephone, mobile phone, VOIP phone or any other communication device that can access and make audio calls to a GSM-based mobile SIM card can communicate with it. At the receiving end, a GSM transceiver receives these network transmissions and reproduces the analogue audio signal via a Power Amplifier and speaker. This was pioneered by Stephen Robert Pearson of Lancashire, England who was granted patents for the systems, which also incorporate control functionality. Using a WMT (GSM) network means that live announcements can be made to anywhere in the world where there is WMT connectivity. The patents cover all forms of WMT i.e., 2G, 3G, 4G ... ××G. A UK company called Remvox Ltd (Remote Voice experience) has been appointed under license to develop and manufacture products based on the technology.

==Long line PA==

A Long-Line Public Address (LLPA) system is any public address system with a distributed architecture, normally across a wide geographic area. Systems of this type are commonly found in the rail, light rail, and metro industries, and let announcements be triggered from one or several locations to the rest of the network over low bandwidth legacy copper, normally PSTN lines using DSL modems, or media such as optical fiber, or GSM-R, or IP-based networks.

Rail systems typically have an interface with a passenger information system (PIS) server, at each station. These are linked to train describers, which state the location of rolling stock on the network from sensors on trackside signaling equipment. The PIS invokes a stored message to play from a local or remote digital voice announcement system, or a series of message fragments to assemble in the correct order, for example: &quot; / the / 23.30 / Great_Western_Railway / Night_Riviera_sleeper_service / from / London_Paddington / to / Penzance / ... / will depart from platform / one / this train is formed of / 12_carriages /.&quot; Messages are routed via an IP network and are played on local amplification equipment. Taken together, the PA, routing, DVA, passenger displays and PIS interface are referred to as the &quot;customer information system (CIS)&quot;, a term often used interchangeably with &quot;passenger information system&quot;.

==Small venue systems==

Small clubs, bars and coffeehouses use a fairly simple set-up, with front of house speaker cabinets (and subwoofers, in some cases) aimed at the audience, and monitor speaker cabinets aimed back at the performers so they can hear their vocals and instruments. In many cases, front of house speakers are elevated, either by mounting them on poles or by &quot;flying&quot; them from anchors in the ceiling. The Front of House speakers are elevated to prevent the sound from being absorbed by the first few rows of audience members. The subwoofers do not need to be elevated, because deep bass is omnidirectional. In the smallest coffeehouses and bars, the audio mixer may be onstage so that the performers can mix their own sound levels. In larger bars, the audio mixer may be located in or behind the audience seating area, so that an audio engineer can listen to the mix and adjust the sound levels. The adjustments to the monitor speaker mix may be made by a single audio engineer using the main mixing board, or they may be made by a second audio engineer who uses a separate mixing board.

==Large venue systems==
For popular music concerts, a more powerful and more complicated PA System is used to provide live sound reproduction. In a concert setting, there are typically two complete PA systems: the &quot;main&quot; system and the &quot;monitor&quot; system. Each system consists of a mixing board, sound processing equipment, amplifiers, and speakers. The microphones that are used to pick up vocals and amplifier sounds are routed through both the main and monitor systems. Audio engineers can set different sound levels for each microphone on the main and monitor systems. For example, a backup vocalist whose voice has a low sound level in the main mix may ask for a much louder sound level through their monitor speaker, so they can hear their singing. 
* The &quot;main&quot; system (also known as &quot;Front of House&quot;, commonly abbreviated FOH), which provides the amplified sound for the audience, typically uses a number of powerful amplifiers that drive a range of large, heavy-duty loudspeakers—including low-frequency speaker cabinets called subwoofers, full-range speaker cabinets, and high-range horns. A large club may use amplifiers to provide 3000 to 5000 watts of power to the &quot;main&quot; speakers. An outdoor concert may use 10,000 or more watts.
* The &quot;monitor&quot; system reproduces the sounds of the performance and directs them towards the onstage performers (typically using wedge-shaped monitor speaker cabinets), to help them to hear the instruments and vocals. In British English, the monitor system is referred to as the &quot;foldback&quot;. The monitor system in a large club may provide 500 to 1000 watts of power to several foldback speakers; at an outdoor concert, there may be several thousand watts of power going to the monitor system.

At a concert using live sound reproduction, sound engineers and technicians control the mixing boards for the &quot;main&quot; and &quot;monitor&quot; systems, adjusting tone, levels, and overall volume.
Touring productions travel with relocatable large line-array PA systems, sometimes rented from an audio equipment hire company. The sound equipment moves from venue to venue along with various other equipment such as lighting and projection.

==Acoustic feedback==
All PA systems have the potential for audio feedback, which occurs when a microphone picks up sound from the speakers, which is re-amplified and sent through the speakers again. It often sounds like a loud high-pitched squeal or screech, and can occur when the volume of the system is turned up too high. Feedback only occurs when the loop gain of the feedback loop is greater than one, so it can always be stopped by reducing the volume sufficiently.

Sound engineers take several steps to maximize gain before feedback, including keeping microphones at a distance from speakers, ensuring that directional microphones are not pointed towards speakers, keeping the onstage volume levels down, and lowering gain levels at frequencies where the feedback is occurring, using a graphic equalizer, a parametric equalizer, or a notch filter. Some 2010s-era mixing consoles and effects units have automatic feedback preventing circuits.

Feedback prevention devices detect the start of unwanted feedback and use a precise notch filter to lower the gain of the frequencies that are feeding back. Some automated feedback detectors require the user to &quot;set&quot; the feedback-prone frequencies by purposely increasing gain (during a sound check) until some feedback starts to occur. This process is often referred to as &quot;a ring out&quot; or &quot;an EQ&quot; of a room/venue. The device then retains these frequencies in its memory and it stands by ready to cut them. Some automated feedback prevention devices can detect and reduce new frequencies other than those found in the sound check.

<doc id="504808" wikidata="Q1151528" url="?curid=504808" title="A Case of Identity">
<text>&quot;A Case of Identity&quot; is one of the 56 short Sherlock Holmes stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and is the third story in &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. It first appeared in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in September 1891.

==Plot==
Mary Sutherland, a working-class girl who possesses a generous income as a result of a bequest from a relative, comes to Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson for help after her fiancé, Hosmer Angel, disappears on their wedding day. Angel, Holmes learns, was a quiet and secretive man who always wore a pair of tinted glasses and would not give Sutherland his address, insisting that she leave letters at the local post office instead. He would only meet her when her disapproving stepfather, James Windibank, was out of the country on business. 

Holmes easily deduces that Windibank and Angel are the same person. Windibank knew that he could only benefit from his stepdaughter&#x27;s income while she remained unmarried, and so he hatched a plan to keep her single indefinitely. As &quot;Hosmer Angel&quot;, he successfully sought her hand; he then engineered Angel&#x27;s disappearance before the marriage could take place. As he had hoped, Sutherland remained loyal to Angel, saying she could never love another.

Holmes chooses not to divulge his findings to Sutherland, knowing she will not believe him anyway. He advises her to forget about Angel, though his words have little effect on her. As for Windibank, Holmes predicts that his wicked ways will eventually lead him to the gallows.

==Publication history==
&quot;A Case of Identity&quot; was first published in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in September 1891, and in the United States in the US edition of the &quot;Strand&quot; in October 1891. The story was published with seven illustrations by Sidney Paget in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;. It was included in the short story collection &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in October 1892.

==Adaptations==
===Film and television===
This story was the basis for the third Holmes adventure (released in 1921) in the silent Stoll film series starring Eille Norwood.

In 2001, this was the basis for the last episode of the animated television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century&quot;.

In 2014, it is seen in &quot;The Empty Hearse&quot;, from the BBC television series &quot;Sherlock&quot;, as one of the cases Sherlock works on with Molly Hooper assisting him. Mary Sutherland was portrayed by Elizabeth Coyle. Molly Hooper was portrayed by Louise Brealey.

In the fourth episode of the 2014 Japanese puppetry television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, Mary Sutherland is a pupil of Beeton School. She is in love with the senior Hosmer Angel who suddenly disappears in a cave at the back of the school. Holmes, a pupil who lives in room 221B of Baker Dormitory, suspects that Angel and Windibank, one of the childhood friends of Sutherland, are the same person and he and Watson find out that there is no pupil called Hosmer Angel in the school. Holmes appreciates Watson for consoling the broken-hearted Sutherland. Watson tells Holmes, who criticises novels as in the original story, that he is wrong to do so because various things can be learned from novels including how to understand the female mind.

===Radio and audio dramas===
Edith Meiser adapted the story as an episode of the radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which aired on 5 May 1932, starring Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. Another episode adapted from the story aired on 21 April 1935 (with Louis Hector as Holmes and Lovell as Watson).

Edith Meiser also adapted the story for the radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson. The episode aired on 30 November 1941. Another adaptation of the story aired in the same series on 30 May 1948 (with John Stanley as Holmes and Alfred Shirley as Watson).

John Gielgud played Sherlock Holmes and Ralph Richardson played Dr. Watson in a radio adaptation that aired on the BBC Light Programme on 2 November 1954. It was broadcast on NBC radio on 23 January 1955.

A radio adaptation aired in 1969, as part of the 1952–1969 BBC radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. It was adapted by Michael Hardwick.

The story was adapted in 1990 by Peter Mackie as an episode of the 1989–1998 BBC radio series, starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson, and featuring Susannah Corbett as Mary Sutherland.

A 2014 episode of the radio series &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; was adapted from the story, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

In 2024, the podcast Sherlock&amp;Co adapted the story in a two-episodes adventure called &quot;A Case of Identity&quot;, starring Paul Waggot as Watson and Harry Attwell as Sherlock.

===Other media===
Colin Dexter, known for writing the Inspector Morse novels, wrote a short story based on this called &quot;A Case of Mis-Identity&quot;, in which Holmes&#x27;s brother Mycroft is involved in the case&#x27;s deduction; in this story, Holmes&#x27;s theory about the &#x27;Hosmer Angel&#x27; character is the same, while Mycroft deduces that &#x27;Hosmer Angel&#x27; is a fiction created by the mother and daughter to eliminate the step-father, only for Watson to reveal that &#x27;Hosmer Angel&#x27; is actually a real person who was attacked and robbed on the way to his wedding, hospitalized, and eventually treated by Watson, who used his own detective skills to verify the man&#x27;s identity.

The story was adapted as the beginning of the third case in the 2016 Frogwares video game &quot;Sherlock Holmes: The Devil&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. Watson is not present when Mary Sutherland arrives and Sherlock is accompanied by Orson Wilde, an American actor training to play him. The player can come up with different conclusions to the case and also make a choice concerning telling her the results of his deduction.

Keith R. A. Decandido&#x27;s short story, &quot;Identity: An Adventure of Shirley Holmes and Jack Watson&quot; updates the story to modern-day Manhattan. Here, the explanation is changed from nearsightedness to prosopagnosia, or face blindness.

<text>An ocular micrometer or eyepiece micrometer is a glass disk, engraved with a ruled scale, that fits in an eyepiece of a microscope, which is used to measure the size of microscopic objects through magnification under a microscope. When the eyepiece micrometer is calibrated using a stage micrometer, the length of the divisions on the scale depends on the degree of magnification.

<text>Carnforth is a market town and civil parish in the City of Lancaster in Lancashire, England, situated at the north-east end of Morecambe Bay. The parish of Carnforth had a population of 5,560 in the 2011 census, an increase from the 5,350 recorded in the 2001 census. The town is situated around 7 miles north of Lancaster, 17 miles south of Kendal, 40 miles east (bisected by Morecambe Bay) of Barrow-in-Furness and 28 miles north-west of Settle. The town is also close to the Cumbria/Lancashire border.

Carnforth grew in the 19th century through the presence of the railway and ironworks. Due to the closeness of the coast and the hills, Carnforth is a popular base for walkers and cyclists exploring the area. The River Keer, the West Coast Main Line (WCML), the A6 and the Lancaster Canal pass through the town. The M6 motorway passes just to the east, linked to Carnforth by the A6070 (formerly the A601(M)) which was originally part of the Lancaster bypass before the M6 was extended north.

== History ==
The name &quot;Carnforth&quot; is thought to derive from its old function as a ford of the River Keer on which it is situated. Over time, the descriptive name &quot;Keer-ford&quot; may have morphed into the modern &quot;Carnforth&quot;. An alternative explanation is that the name derives from &#x27;Chreneforde&#x27; and is Anglo-Saxon in origin, as cited in the Victoria County History of Lancashire.

Much of the history of Carnforth revolves around the railway and ironworks. Vast deposits of limestone located locally made Carnforth an ideal place for an ironworks, as limestone is a key component of the smelting process. In 1846, the Carnforth Ironworks Company established a works near to the railway station. In the same year, a recession occurred in the Earl of Dudley ironworks in Worcestershire, which meant there was a surplus of workers. A number of workers moved to the ironworks and lived in the nearby company village of Dudley (now called &quot;Millhead&quot;). In 1864, the Carnforth Haematite Company took over the works and production was vastly increased due to iron ore that was brought in by rail from the Furness Peninsula. By 1872, steel production became the main focus for the works using the new Bessemer process; this process had failed by 1879. 

Iron production continued at the works until 1929, when it eventually closed down. The site was taken over by the War Department, as an ordnance depot and remained as such until the 1960s. From then to the present, the site is now an industrial estate housing several businesses.

In the 19th century, Carnforth grew from a small village into a railway town when it became the junction of three major railways. Carnforth Motive Power Depot was located to the west of the West Coast Main Line and, until mid-1968, was one of the last to retain an allocation of steam locomotives. The buildings are now occupied by West Coast Railways who still maintain and overhaul steam locos in their premises. The concrete locomotive coaling tower is a rare survivor.

With the closure of Carnforth MPD in 1968, the station&#x27;s facilities were reduced. The main line platforms were closed in May 1970 and subsequently removed when the line was electrified two years later, although services still run on the Furness line and the Bentham Line.

From the 1920s to the 1980s, Morphy&#x27;s Mill, in Oxford Street, was a major employer of women in Carnforth. Contrary to its name, it was not a mill but a factory making blouses and other garments.

==&quot;Brief Encounter&quot;==
In 1945, Carnforth railway station was used as a location for the David Lean film &quot;Brief Encounter&quot;, starring Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard. Fans of this film were one of the major factors in the recent refurbishment of the railway station, including construction of a refreshment room to match the studio set used in the film. This reopened in 2021 as the &quot;Brief Encounter Refreshment Room Bistro and Bar&quot;. There are also exhibitions and a heritage centre, which is now run by the Carnforth Station Trust. The 2018 novel &quot;Past Encounters&quot; by local writer Deborah Swift is set, in part, in Carnforth during the filming of &quot;Brief Encounter&quot;.

==Governance==
An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward is smaller than the parish with a total population of 4,439.

Carnforth is in the parliamentary constituency of Morecambe and Lunesdale, represented since 2024 by Lizzi Collinge of the Labour Party.

== Geography ==
The River Keer runs through the north-north-west of the town with the mouth of the river flowing into Morecambe Bay. It forms the parish boundary between Carnforth and Warton. A bridge between Carnforth and Millhead is the lowest road crossing of the river, although there is a footbridge a little further downstream. 
==Demography==
The Office for National Statistics recognises an area described as Carnforth Built-up area, defined algorithmically, which includes Carnforth and Warton. It is divided into two parts: Carnforth subdivision, which includes the Millhead area within Warton parish, and Warton subdivision. The ONS definition of a built-up area includes built-up land separated by 200m from another settlement.

==Health service==
There is a general practice surgery in the town, with eleven partners and four associate GPs. It has smaller surgeries in Arnside, Bolton-le-Sands, Halton, and Silverdale, to serve patients in outlying villages. It is within the North Lancashire clinical commissioning group and patients are served by the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust.

There is also an NHS clinic, adjacent to the GP practice, used for a variety of services.

==Transport==
Carnforth railway station is served by Northern Trains on three lines:
* Bentham Line: Services operate between and , via 
* Furness line: Trains link with , via . Some trains continue to , via

<doc id="504825" wikidata="Q408014" url="?curid=504825" title="Chondroitin sulfate">
<text>Chondroitin sulfate is a sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) composed of a chain of alternating sugars (N-acetylgalactosamine and glucuronic acid). It is usually found attached to proteins as part of a proteoglycan. A chondroitin chain can have over 100 individual sugars, each of which can be sulfated in variable positions and quantities. Chondroitin sulfate is an important structural component of cartilage, and provides much of its resistance to compression. Along with glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate has become a widely used dietary supplement for treatment of osteoarthritis, although large clinical trials failed to demonstrate any symptomatic benefit of chondroitin.

==Medical use==

Chondroitin is used in dietary supplements as an alternative medicine to treat osteoarthritis. It is also approved and regulated as a symptomatic slow-acting drug for this disease (SYSADOA) in Europe and some other countries. It is commonly sold together with glucosamine. A 2015 Cochrane review of clinical trials found that most were of low quality, but that there was some evidence of short-term improvement in pain and few side effects; it does not appear to improve or maintain the health of affected joints.

Chondroitin, along with commonly used glucosamine, should not be used to treat people who have symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee as evidence shows that these treatments fail to provide relief for that condition.

Chondroitin has shown to be promising in the treatment of coronary artery disease. In a 6-year double-blind placebo-controlled study involving 60 test subjects published in 1973, the chondroitin sulfate group showed a 350% reduction in fatal heart attacks compared to the control group. When analyzing the data for non-fatal cardiovascular events, the control group experienced non-fatal heart attacks at a rate of 16%, while those in the chondroitin sulfate-treated group came in at 0%.

Chondroitin sulfate is used as a dietary supplement for diabetes management. It exhibits anti-inflammatory properties, making it a potential alternative to cortisol for treating enteritis.

==Adverse effects==
Clinical studies have not identified any significant side effects or overdoses of chondroitin sulfate, which suggest its long-term safety. In 2003 the Task Force of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) committee ranked the level of toxicity of chondroitin sulfate 6 in a 0–100 scale.

Chondroitin sulfate is not metabolized by cytochrome P450.

==Pharmacology==
===Mechanisms of action===

The effect of chondroitin sulfate in people with osteoarthritis is likely the result of a number of reactions including its anti-inflammatory activity, the stimulation of the synthesis of proteoglycans and hyaluronic acid, and the decrease in catabolic activity of chondrocytes, inhibiting the synthesis of proteolytic enzymes, nitric oxide, and other substances that contribute to damage the cartilage matrix and cause death of articular chondrocytes. A recent review summarizes data from relevant reports describing the biochemical basis of the effect of chondroitin sulfate on osteoarthritis articular tissues.

===Bioavailability and pharmacokinetics===
Pharmacokinetic studies performed on humans and experimental animals after oral administration of chondroitin sulfate revealed that it can be absorbed orally. Chondroitin sulfate shows first-order kinetics up to single doses of 3,000 mg. Multiple doses of 800 mg in people with osteoarthritis do not alter the kinetics of chondroitin sulfate. The bioavailability of chondroitin sulfate ranges from 15% to 24% of the orally administered dose. More particularly, on the articular tissue, Ronca et al. reported that chondroitin sulfate is not rapidly absorbed in the gastro-intestinal tract and a high content of labeled chondroitin sulfate is found in the synovial fluid and cartilage.

==Physical and chemical properties==
Chondroitin sulfate chains are unbranched polysaccharides of variable length containing two alternating monosaccharides: -glucuronic acid (GlcA) and &quot;N&quot;-acetyl--galactosamine (GalNAc). Some of these GlcA residues may be epimerized into -iduronic acid (IdoA) at which point the resulting glycosaminoglycan is then referred to as dermatan sulfate, previously referred to as chondroitin sulfate B.

Chondroitin sulfate is sourced from natural products, with high variability in terms of chain length and sulfation pattern. The variability in chondroitin sulfate composition extends to its origin, making it possible to differentiate between chondroitin sulfate from terrestrial and marine sources. One way to look at this difference is in terms of the proportion of disaccharide units: chondroitin sulfate from terrestrial animals is almost exclusively composed of non-sulfated (O) and monosulfated (A and C) units, while in marine species the proportion of disulfated (D, E and B) units is higher. Furthermore, marine chondroitin sulfate chains tend to be longer, with molecular weight of up to 70 kDa in chondroitin sulfate from shark, while in terrestrial animals molecular weight is typically below 45 kDa.

Chondroitin sulfate chains are linked to hydroxyl groups on serine residues of certain proteins. Exactly how proteins are selected for attachment of glycosaminoglycans is not understood. Glycosylated serines are often followed by a glycine and have neighboring acidic residues, but this motif does not always predict glycosylation.

Attachment of the GAG chain begins with four monosaccharides in a fixed pattern: Xyl – Gal – Gal – GlcA. Each sugar is attached by a specific enzyme, allowing for multiple levels of control over GAG synthesis. Xylose begins to be attached to proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, while the rest of the sugars are attached in the Golgi apparatus.

Chondroitin sulfate is highly soluble in water.

==History==
Chondroitin sulfate was originally isolated well before the structure was characterised, leading to changes in terminology with time. Early researchers identified different fractions of the substance with letters.

&quot;Chondroitin sulfate B&quot; is an old name for dermatan sulfate, and it is no longer classified as a form of chondroitin sulfate.

&quot;Chondroitin&quot;, without the &quot;sulfate&quot;, has been used to describe a fraction with little or no sulfation. However, this distinction is not used by all.

Although the name &quot;chondroitin sulfate&quot; suggests a salt with a sulfate counter-anion, this is not the case, as sulfate is covalently bonded to the sugar. Rather, since the molecule has multiple negative charges at physiological pH, a cation is present in salts of chondroitin sulfate. Commercial preparations of chondroitin sulfate typically are the sodium salt. Barnhill et al. have suggested that all such preparations of chondroitin sulfate be referred to as &quot;sodium chondroitin&quot; regardless of their sulfation status.

In 2008 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) identified &quot;oversulfated chondroitin sulfate&quot; as a contaminant in heparin originating from China.

===Clinical trials for osteoarthritis===
In 2004, a petition was submitted to the FDA that a dietary supplement of chondroitin sulfate be labeled as reducing the risk of osteoarthritis, cartilage deterioration, and osteoarthritis-related joint pain, tenderness, and swelling. The FDA denied the request, stating that experiments conducted by the company did not sufficiently demonstrate the effectiveness of the claim. Among other comments, the FDA noted the poor experimental design of some trials.

In 2007, Reichenbach et al. used explicit methods to conduct and report a systematic review of 20 trials and concluded &quot;large-scale, methodologically sound trials indicate that the symptomatic benefit of chondroitin is minimal or nonexistent. Use of chondroitin in routine clinical practice should therefore be discouraged.&quot;
In contrast, and also in 2007, Bruyere et al. concluded that &quot;there is compelling evidence that glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate may interfere with progression of OA.&quot;

As of 2015 the largest trial conducted with the product was the Glucosamine and Chondroitin Arthritis Intervention Trial (GAIT), a double-blind, randomized, multicenter clinical trial sponsored by the US National Institutes of Health in 1583 people with knee osteoarthritis, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2006. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of five orally administered treatments: two 250 mg capsules of glucosamine hydrochloride three times daily, two 200 mg capsules of chondroitin sulfate three times daily, two capsules of 250 mg of glucosamine hydrochloride plus 200 mg of chondroitin sulfate three times daily, 200 mg of celecoxib daily, or placebo. Treatment was administered for 24 weeks. It showed no difference from placebo.

Sawitzke A, et al. 2010 evaluated the efficacy and safety of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, alone or in combination, as well as celecoxib and placebo on painful knee osteoarthritis over 2 years as a continuation of the GAIT trial. This was a 24-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, enrolling 662 people with knee osteoarthritis who satisfied radiographic criteria (Kellgren/Lawrence grade 2 or 3 changes and baseline joint space width of at least 2 mm). This subset continued to receive their randomized treatment (glucosamine 500 mg three times daily, chondroitin sulfate 400 mg three times daily, the combination of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, celecoxib 200 mg daily, or placebo) over 24 months. The primary outcome was a 20% reduction in pain over 24 months as measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). Secondary outcomes included an Outcome Measures in Rheumatology/Osteoarthritis Research Society International response and change from baseline in WOMAC pain and function. Over 2 years, none of the treatments (not even the positive control celecoxib) achieved a clinically important difference in WOMAC pain or function as compared with placebo. Adverse reactions were similar among treatment groups and serious adverse events were rare for all treatments.

===Research===
A 2021 study showed a remarkable (about 40%) reduction of the acute myocardial infarction risk in current chondroitin sulfate users in the high risk cardiovascular subgroups.
==Society and culture==

===Manufacture===
Most chondroitin appears to be made from extracts of cartilaginous cow and pig tissues (cow trachea and pig ear and nose), but other sources such as shark, fish, and bird cartilage are also used. Since chondroitin is not a uniform substance, and is naturally present in a wide variety of forms, the precise composition of each supplement will vary. In fact, although many food supplement companies produce their products in compliance with human food processing Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), most of them do not produce their products in compliance with the GMP regulations for pharmaceuticals, resulting in products not meeting pharmaceutical requirements.

===Legal status===
While it is a prescription or over-the-counter drug in 22 countries, chondroitin is regulated in the U.S. as a dietary supplement by the Food and Drug Administration. In Europe, chondroitin sulfate formulations are approved as drugs with evidenced efficacy and safety demonstrated by clinical trials in people with osteoarthritis. Adebowale et al. reported in 2000 that of 32 chondroitin supplements they analysed, only 5 were labeled correctly, and more than half contained less than 40% of the labeled amount. With the introduction of GMP regulations for dietary supplements in 2008, chondroitin sulfate preparations are subject in the US to mandatory labeling standards as well as testing requirements for identity, purity, strength, and composition. United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) testing standards for the identification and quantification of chondroitin are well-established.

There are no FDA regulations on chondroitin sulfate as a food additive, as it is recognized by the FDA as a component of food and is &quot;generally recognized as safe&quot;. However, a proposed application of chondroitin sulfate dietary supplement as a means of preventing joint degeneration was highly scrutinized by the FDA, who stated:

In the same letter, the FDA found that studies performed on the dietary supplement form of chondroitin sulfate were insufficient to substantiate claims that it is efficacious in the prevention of joint deterioration, and denied the request to be allowed to label the supplement as such. They further denied the request to market it as safe, given that no human clinical trials were done, citing that animal studies are not sufficient for the approval of a dietary supplement.

==Veterinary use==
Chondroitin and glucosamine are also used in veterinary medicine for osteoarthritis.

<doc id="504827" wikidata="Q533981" url="?curid=504827" title="Katharine O'Shea">
<text>Katharine Parnell (née Wood; 30 January 1846 – 5 February 1921), known before her second marriage as Katharine O&#x27;Shea and popularly as Kitty O&#x27;Shea, was an English woman of aristocratic background whose adulterous relationship with Irish nationalist Charles Stewart Parnell led to a widely publicised divorce in 1890 and his political downfall.

==Background==
Katharine was born in Braintree, Essex, on 30 January 1846, the daughter of Emma Caroline Wood and Sir John Page Wood, 2nd Baronet (1796–1866), and granddaughter of Sir Matthew Wood, a former Lord Mayor of London. She had an elder brother who became Field Marshal Sir Evelyn Wood and was also the niece of both Western Wood MP (1804–1863) and Lord Hatherley, Gladstone&#x27;s first Liberal Lord Chancellor.

==Relationship with Parnell==
In 1867, Katharine married Captain William O&#x27;Shea, a Catholic Nationalist MP for County Clare from whom she separated around 1875. Katharine first met Parnell in 1880 and began an affair with him. Three of Katharine&#x27;s children were fathered by Parnell; the first, Claude Sophie, died early in 1882. The others were Claire (born 1883) and Katharine (born 1884). Captain O&#x27;Shea knew about the relationship. He challenged Parnell to a duel in 1881 and initially forbade his estranged wife to see him, although she said that he encouraged her in the relationship. However, he kept publicly quiet for several years. Although their relationship was a subject of gossip in London political circles from 1881, later public knowledge of the affair in an England governed by &quot;Victorian morality&quot; with a &quot;nonconformist conscience&quot; created a huge scandal, as adultery was prohibited by the Ten Commandments.

Out of her family connection to the Liberal Party, Katharine acted as liaison between Parnell and Gladstone during negotiations prior to the introduction of the First Irish Home Rule Bill in April 1886. Parnell moved to her home in Eltham, close to the London-Kent border, that summer.

Captain O&#x27;Shea filed for divorce in 1889; his reasons are a matter for speculation. He may have had political motives. Alternatively, it was claimed that he had been hoping for an inheritance from Katharine&#x27;s rich aunt whom he had expected to die earlier, but when she died in 1889, aged 97, her money was left in trust to cousins. After the divorce the court awarded custody of Katharine O&#x27;Shea and Parnell&#x27;s two surviving daughters to her ex-husband.

Katharine&#x27;s November divorce proceedings from Captain O&#x27;Shea, in which Parnell was named as co-respondent, led to Parnell being deserted by a majority of his Irish Parliamentary Party and to his downfall as its leader in December 1890. Catholic Ireland felt a sense of shock when Katharine broke the vows of her previous marriage by marrying Parnell on 25 June 1891. With both his political life and his health essentially ruined, Parnell died in her arms of pneumonia at the age of 45 on 6 October 1891 in Hove, less than four months after their marriage.
Katharine published a biography of Parnell in 1914 as &quot;Katharine O&#x27;Shea (Mrs. Charles Stewart Parnell)&quot;.

Though to her friends she was known as &#x27;Katie&#x27;, Parnell&#x27;s enemies and the press called her &quot;Kitty O&#x27;Shea&quot;. At that time &#x27;kitty&#x27;, as well as being a common short form of Catherine/Katherine/Katharine, was also a slang term for a prostitute. She lived the rest of her life in relative obscurity and is buried in Littlehampton, West Sussex, England.

Her daughter by Parnell, Claire O&#x27;Shea (1883–1909), married Bertram Sydney Osmund Maunsell, and their only son, Assheton Clare Bowyer-Lane Maunsell (1909–34), died of enteric fever while serving with the British Army in India. Katharine’s other daughter by Parnell, Katharine O&#x27;Shea (1884–1947), married Arthur Moule of the East Lancashire Regiment; she died in an asylum.

Henry Harrison, who had acted as Parnell&#x27;s bodyguard and aide-de-camp, devoted himself after Parnell&#x27;s death to the service of his widow, Katharine. From her he heard a different version of the events surrounding the divorce from that which had appeared in the press, and this was to form the basis of his two books defending Parnell published in 1931 and 1938. They had a major impact on Irish historiography, leading to a more favourable view of Parnell&#x27;s role in the O’Shea affair.

==Depictions==
In the film &quot;Parnell&quot; (1937), O&#x27;Shea was played by Myrna Loy. Phyllis Calvert played her in &quot;Parnell&quot; for &quot;Play of the Week&quot; (1959). In the television miniseries &quot;Parnell and the Englishwoman&quot; (1991), she was played by Francesca Annis.

<doc id="504832" wikidata="Q1945499" url="?curid=504832" title="Chun-Li">
<text>Chun-Li (; Japanese: , Hepburn: ) is a character in Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Street Fighter&quot; video game series. She first appeared in &quot;Street Fighter II: The World Warrior&quot; in 1991 and is the first female playable character to appear in a fighting game to gain mainstream recognition. She is a martial artist and Interpol officer who seeks revenge for the death of her father by the series&#x27; antagonist M. Bison.

Since her debut, Chun-Li has become a pop culture icon and one of the series&#x27; most iconic characters. She has appeared in nearly all subsequent installments of the series and several other Capcom games, in addition to third-party games. She is also featured in &quot;Street Fighter&quot;-related media, including two feature films, multiple anime and comic book productions, and other official series merchandise. She has earned much positive fan and critical reception for factors such as her backstory, athleticism and in-game playability, and she is considered a trailblazer for female characters in fighting titles and general video gaming.

==Development history==
===Design===
Chun-Li&#x27;s design was primarily inspired by Tong Pooh, a female villain from &quot;Strider&quot;, an earlier Capcom game. Capcom designer Akira Nishitani, recounting the creation of the character, said: &quot;Previously there were no women in fighting games. In Chun-Li&#x27;s case, I wanted a woman in the game. I determined what her fighting abilities would be. Then China just came up as a possible homeland.&quot; Capcom artist and designer Akira &quot;Akiman&quot; Yasuda said the initial inspiration for Chun-Li came from the 1983 anime film &quot;Harmagedon: Genma Wars&quot; (featuring early character design work by &quot;Akira&quot; creator Katsuhiro Otomo), which had a Chinese female character called Tao. Chun-Li was originally known as just &#x27;Chinese Girl&#x27; among the development team. She had a backflip attack that was popular among testers but deemed too strong, and unfortunately had to be cut from the game after they ran out of time. Her name means &#x27;beautiful spring&#x27; in Chinese as Chūn (春) means &#x27;the season of spring&#x27;, and lì (麗) means &#x27;beautiful&#x27; in Mandarin dialects.

Yasuda recalled they only had five weeks to make Chun-Li in the game and he was deeply worried about the quality of her design and how she would be received. Chun-Li &quot;was wearing pants right up until the very end [of the development]. When we made the sprites I thought she didn&#x27;t look right, so I had them changed to tights instead.&quot; Akiman added that they &quot;wanted &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; to be more entertaining than its predecessor. That also helps explain how Chun-Li came to be. Having a female character in the game completely changes the game&#x27;s dynamic, she brightens up the entire palette. We needed a reason for her to fight, and so an evil empire [of M. Bison] came to mind.&quot; He also said: &quot;To be honest, I spent some time worrying about putting Chun-Li, the heroine, into such a plain setting. Ordinarily, you don&#x27;t see women participating in global martial arts tournaments. Just by adding her we were starting to push things to the &#x27;fun&#x27; side. I didn&#x27;t think about it at the time, but thinking about it now, from the moment we put Chun-Li into the game we were already pushing things towards the full-on entertainment side.&quot;

Chun-Li was designed with an exceptionally strong physique because she was the sole woman among a roster of powerful male characters in &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;. To overcome this perceived imbalance, she was devised as a character who had mastered Chinese kenpo and really pushed her body to the limit so that she could compete with such a cast of large and imposing men. She was nevertheless the fastest but physically weakest character in her first game. Capcom producer Yoshiki Okamoto said he wanted to also make the life bar for Chun-Li &quot;shorter than for the other characters because women are not as strong. But Nishitani didn&#x27;t want to do that. We both had legitimate reasons, but then we came to an agreement to not make it shorter.&quot;

Chun-Li is particularly well known for her very muscular legs, while depictions of the rest of her body are more variable. According to Capcom composer Yoko Shimomura, Chun-Li&#x27;s big thighs originated from Akiman&#x27;s personal fetish. The size of Chun-Li&#x27;s thighs massively increased in &quot;Street Fighter III&quot;. Capcom producer Yoshinori Ono commented on the issue. &quot;I witnessed as her thighs made a sudden jump into gigantism in &quot;SFIII&quot;. When we first put her in the game, her sprite was just an outline and her thighs weren&#x27;t that big...but as the artists starting coloring her in, her legs got thicker and thicker.&quot; However, they all felt the larger legs increased the expressiveness of her animations. Regarding then-upcoming &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot;, Ono said the &quot;character designer, [Daigo] Ikeno, is kind of into thick girls, so as an artist he feels that the most beautiful thighs he can give Chun-Li would be of the wide variety.&quot;

Chun-Li sprite&#x27;s panty-flashing animation frames have been censored for the home console releases by Nintendo. In response to fans that were disappointed with Chun-Li&#x27;s absence from &quot;Street Fighter III&quot;, Capcom added her to the &quot;3rd Strike&quot; version of the game. Since her main designer, Akiman, was busy with other assignments, she was redesigned by other members from the staff; Chun Li the most time and effort out of all characters. Her inclusion into &quot;Street Fighter EX&quot; was deemed natural by the studio Arika, with producer Ichiro Mihara describing her as one of the three essential &quot;Street Fighter&quot; characters along with Ryu and Ken.

In the &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; games, where she was redesigned by Eri &quot;Erichan&quot; Nakamura, Chun-Li wears a sleeveless tight outfit, her arms and upper body were visibly much stronger than those of any other female character in the franchise, however many artists choose to depict her as petite and slim, in official and unofficial artworks alike, drawing only her legs strong due to her emphasis on kicking moves. An early version of Chun-Li in &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot; was reworked following complaints from location tests that she was not &quot;cute&quot;. Ono later announced Chun-Li&#x27;s controversial face in &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite&quot; would be also corrected based on a negative feedback from the fans.

===Costumes===
In the &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; sub-series and most of her later appearances, Chun-Li wears a usually blue qipao, an early-20th-century Chinese dress, with golden accents, puffy sleeves, and a white waistband. The dress is modified to allow a far wider range of movement than a generic qipao. In &quot;Street Fighter II: The World Warrior&quot;, Chun-Li was originally depicted wearing a red qipao instead of blue. It can be also either red or white within some games since &quot;Street Fighter II: Champion Edition&quot; and &quot;Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting&quot;, respectively. In &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite&quot;, the qipao has a very noticeable silky sheen. Her other ensemble includes a pair of white combat boots and brown tights. She usually wears her hair in &quot;ox horns&quot;, with silk brocades and ribbons in her hair. Another iconic part of her design are the large spiked bracelets she wears on her wrists.

In the &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; games (set during the time period before &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;), Chun-Li wears a Chinese acrobatic outfit consisting of an embroidered vest, a unitard, and sneakers; she is wearing her ox horns unadorned, but kept in place with yellow ribbons. In &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot;, Chun-Li&#x27;s alternate outfit consists of black tabard with gold accents at the bottom, while her ox horns are unadorned, just like in her &quot;Alpha&quot; appearance, only this time it is held by red ropes with golden balls at the tip. This outfit is completed with red shoes, gold earrings and black and gold bracelets. Her alternative wardrobe in &quot;Super Street Fighter IV&quot; includes a costume inspired by Mai Shiranui and in &quot;Street Fighter V&quot; she has a Halloween downloadable content (DLC) appearing as Morrigan Aensland. She has by far most costumes out of all characters in &quot;Street Fighter V&quot; (a total of 17 by 2018), including some with different hairstyles.

===Gameplay===
Chun-Li&#x27;s gameplay style changes notably from game to game, with for example &quot;Champion Edition&quot; restoring her flipping attacks that have been removed from the original version of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;. &quot;Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike&quot; marked a strong departure from previous incarnations as it featured a large number of revamped moves. Later games have looked to balance between her &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; and &quot;3rd Strike&quot; styles.

Chun-Li started as a weak and fast close-range fighter compared to the bigger male characters from &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; with the best aerial ability in the game, but she steadily gained an array of different moves through the games, such as a projectile attack or an anti-air defensive move, which steered her towards a more balanced type with an emphasis on poking and control of neutral game thanks to a rich set of non-special moves of relatively long range. She has been noted to be one of the most powerful characters in the game, alongside Ken and Yun.

&quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot; and &quot;Alpha 3&quot; feature Chun-Li&#x27;s original outfit from &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; as an alternate version of the character with alternate special abilities and Super Combos. &quot;CVG&quot; opined she was &quot;the most-improved character in &quot;Alpha 2&quot;, and possibly the #1 character in the whole game.&quot;

She was considerably weakened in &quot;Street Fighter EX&quot;, but has remained one of the fastest characters. The development team for &quot;Street Fighter EX&quot; attempted to bring Chun-Li back to her roots as an agility-oriented character by, among other things, restoring her Spinning Bird Kick and removing the fireball attack she acquired in &quot;Street Fighter II Turbo&quot; as they felt the projectile attack had too radically altered her originally agile fighting style.

Her appearances in the &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; series are reminiscent of her early gameplay, featuring her as one of the fastest characters in the games, taking advantage of the faster gameplay of the games as well as game mechanics such as multiple jumps and air dashes; her X-Factor power-up in &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 3&quot; features an increment in speed. Chun-Li&#x27;s normal moves are balanced among punches and kicks, but most of her special moves are kicks. Her most recognizable special moves remain the Hyakuretsu Kyaku, a series of quick kicks from a one-legged stance (usually referred to as Lightning Legs/Kicks in English), and the Spinning Bird Kick, where she spins while upside down in a front split kicking all around her. Chun-Li can also use the Kiko-Ken, a ranged energy projectile similar to Ryu&#x27;s Hadouken, and a concentrated static energy burst known as the Kiko-Sho.

====&quot;Street Fighter&quot;====

Chun-Li, canonically born on March 1, 1968, is an expert Chinese martial arts practitioner. Her profile indicates her training in several styles of Chinese kempo (&quot;Chinese martial arts&quot;) at the age of five, especially tai chi, which she would later complement with &quot;sanda&quot; (combat wushu) and fighting styles from all around the world, such as taekwondo, full contact karate, judo and capoeira. She has been noted in-universe for her fluent English, investigating skills, penetrating eyes, beauty and acting talent for deception. Chun-Li is presented as a woman with a strong sense of justice, and her motives for fighting crime range from avenging the death of her father to protecting innocents. She especially cares for kids, showing repulse for the use of brainwashed young girls in &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 3&quot; and the kidnap of a girl in &quot;Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike&quot;. In the latter game, she decides she will teach her fighting style and philosophy to children.

Chun-Li was introduced in 1991 in the original version of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; (&quot;Street Fighter II: The World Warrior&quot;) as the franchise&#x27;s first playable female character, an undercover Interpol agent seeking to avenge the death of her father at the hands of M. Bison and his criminal organization. Upon Bison&#x27;s defeat, she fulfills her revenge and decides to return to her life as an ordinary girl; &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot; allows players to choose this ending or another in which she remains a police officer. The &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; prequel series built upon her backstory, while &quot;Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike&quot; shows her retired and teaching martial arts to young children, only to be forced to return to law enforcement after her student Li-Fen is abducted by Urien. Chun-Li returns in &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot;, where her in-game narrative shows her at crossroads in her life, eventually returning to both street fighting and law enforcement. She returns in &quot;Street Fighter V&quot;, where she assists in stopping Shadaloo&#x27;s Black Moons and first meets Li-Fen when she rescues her from the organization; in her prologue story, Chun-Li recalls how she learned of her father&#x27;s death.

In &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot;, Chun-Li continues to raise Li-Fen and train students in Metro City&#x27;s Chinatown district, while also being promoted to become a director of Interpol. Li-Fen also acts as her eyes and ears during her Interpol work. Upon learning a terrorist group known as Amnesia attempts to assassinate Ken at Nayshall, Chun-Li tries to stop them from framing him for the crime he did not commit, but fails. Chun-Li then works hard on finding further evidences to clear her friend&#x27;s name while hunting the terrorist group.

In non-canonical spin-off series &quot;Street Fighter EX&quot;, Chun-Li is a police officer investigating Shadaloo in search of her missing father.

====Other games====
Besides the core &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series, Chun-Li has also made appearances in many other Capcom-produced fighting games, including all titles of the long-running series &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; (ever since &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot;, including Shadow Lady, a dark version of Chun-Li that underwent harsh experiments on Bison&#x27;s orders and was transformed into a brainwashed cyborg) and &quot;Capcom vs. SNK&quot; (as a rival to SNK character Mai Shiranui), and in &quot;Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars&quot; and &quot;Street Fighter X Tekken&quot;. She and Ryu are the only &quot;Street Fighter&quot; characters to appear in every Capcom crossover title, including the &quot;SNK vs. Capcom&quot; fighting game series by SNK and the tactical role-playing games &quot;Namco × Capcom&quot;, &quot;Project X Zone&quot; and &quot;Project X Zone 2&quot; by Namco (where Chun-Li is paired into a single unit with Morrigan Aensland from &quot;Darkstalkers&quot;), as well as appearing as a boss in the platform game &quot;Street Fighter X Mega Man&quot;. She was also planned to appear as a giant robot in . Often, Chun-Li either continues her existing story from &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; or seeks to arrest the other characters in the game that she sees as suspicious.

Chun-Li is additionally playable in other Capcom games such as versus puzzle games &quot;Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo&quot;, &quot;Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix&quot; (where she can turn into Jill Valentine) and &quot;Street Fighter: Puzzle Spirits&quot;, and social games &quot;Capcom All-Stars&quot; and &quot;Street Fighter Battle Combination.&quot; She has made guest appearances in a number of mobile games, including &quot;#Compass&quot;, &quot;Destiny Child&quot;, &quot;Granblue Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Power Rangers: Legacy Wars&quot;, and &quot;Valkyrie Connect&quot;. She makes cameo appearances in various Capcom games including &quot;Asura&#x27;s Wrath&quot;, &quot;Breath of Fire&quot;, &quot;Final Fight 2&quot;, &quot;Mega Man 9&quot;, and &quot;We Love Golf!.&quot; Furthermore, her costumes can be worn by player characters in Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Breath of Fire 6&quot;, &quot;Dead Rising 3&quot; (a DLC costume for Frank West), &quot;Monster Hunter: World&quot;, &quot;Monster Hunter Explore&quot;, and &quot;&quot; (as an alternate costume for Ohatsu), as well as in Square Enix&#x27;s &quot;Gunslinger Stratos 2&quot; (a costume for Mika Katagiri) and Sony&#x27;s &quot;LittleBigPlanet&quot; (a DLC for Sackgirl). A playable Chun-Li character skin has also been added to &quot;Fortnite&quot;. Chun-Li, under the name &quot;Blue Phoenix Ranger&quot;, appears as a playable character in &quot;Power Rangers: Battle for the Grid&quot; via downloadable content. Chun-Li is set to appear in &quot;Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves&quot; as part of the first season of downloadable content.

===Other appearances===
====Live-action====
Chun-Li was a central character in the 1994 &quot;Street Fighter&quot; film, played by Ming-Na Wen. Chun-Li was given a surname (&quot;Zang Chun-Li&quot;) and posed as a television reporter working in Shadaloo in her personal quest to track down and kill Bison, who had murdered her father during a peasant uprising. Her relationship with Guile is acrimonious from the start, as he bluntly rejects her interview request and chides Chun-Li for his own inability to trace a signal broadcast by Bison. Chun-Li allies herself with E. Honda and Balrog, who work as her news crew and whose reputations were ruined by Bison&#x27;s mafia connections, and later forms an initially uneasy alliance with Ryu and Ken working with Guile in attempting to locate Bison&#x27;s secret fortress. After Guile&#x27;s fake death during a staged prison break, Chun-Li uses a homing device to trace him to, and then infiltrate, the Allied Nations&#x27; headquarters, where she is shocked to discover that he is still alive. However, Guile does not want her vendetta against Bison interfering with his own. He orders Cammy and T. Hawk to take Chun-Li into custody, but she manages to escape. With Balrog and Honda, all posing as traveling carnival performers, she works with Ken and Ryu on a failed assassination attempt against Bison and Sagat before they are all captured and taken to Bison&#x27;s fortress. Chun-Li is held prisoner in Bison&#x27;s private chambers (in an approximation to her traditional game costume), and after she relays the story of her father&#x27;s murder, Bison mocks her and her fighting skills in response, which provokes Chun-Li into attacking him, having planned all along for an opportunity to personally attack Bison. She actually gains the upper hand before becoming distracted by her comrades coming to her rescue, allowing Bison to escape before subduing them with knock-out gas and taking them hostage. When Guile and the Allied Nations launch an invasion on Bison&#x27;s fortress during the film&#x27;s climax, she and the rest of Bison&#x27;s hostages are freed, and after Bison&#x27;s forces are defeated, Guile promises her an exclusive interview, but only, he adds in jest, if she shows up in her costume.

As the titular character in the 2009 film &quot;Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li&quot;, she was played by Kristin Kreuk, her last name was changed to &quot;Xiang&quot; as well as being a pianist turned fighter. Her father was named Huang Xiang and was a businessman Bison abducts and forces to work for him. While she was depicted as Chinese-American, her goal of avenging her father remained unchanged and she succeeds killing Bison with help from her mentor Gen and Charlie Nash. The film was released in Japanese theaters as a double bill with a Studio 4°C-produced anime short that starred fellow &quot;Street Fighter&quot; character Sakura Kasugano and played after the movie.

Chun-Li was played by a cross-dressing Jackie Chan in the 1993 live-action adaptation of &quot;City Hunter&quot; during the &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; spoof scene that positively surprised the original manga&#x27;s author Tsukasa Hojo. Chun-Li appears in the second season of &quot;Street Fighter: Assassin&#x27;s Fist&quot; titled &quot;Street Fighter: World Warrior&quot; in a significant role. In addition, she also makes cameo appearances in the 2008 Korean film &quot;My Mighty Princess&quot; (on a poster) and in the 2018 film &quot;Ready Player One.&quot;

Gemma Nguyen portrays Chun-Li in the official crossover between the Power Rangers and Street Fighter titled &quot;Power Rangers: Legacy Wars—Street Fighter Showdown&quot;. In the short, Ryu morphs into the RyuRanger and Chun-Li teams with Tommy Oliver, Ninjor and Gia Moran to battle M. Bison and evil Power Rangers.

Nguyen reprised her role in the fan film &quot;Street Fighter: Enter the Dragon&quot;, intervening in the fight between Fei Long and Balrog near the end.

====Animation====
Chun-Li is a central character in the 1994 anime film &quot;Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie&quot;, voiced by Miki Fujitani in the original Japanese version and by Lia Sargent (credited as Mary Briscoe) in the English dub. She is investigating M. Bison&#x27;s Shadowlaw organization suspected of murdering several diplomats and requests to work with Guile; he initially balks at this as he wants to pursue Bison himself, but later they become inseparable. In a famous instance of fan service, an explicit scene showed Chun-Li showering in her apartment as a Shadowlaw assassin, Vega, arrives to kill her. The shower scene has been censored to varying degrees in versions of the English dub. After a brutal fight, Vega is kicked through a wall and sent plummeting several stories to the ground, but Chun-Li succumbs to her injuries and slips into a coma. She remains hospitalized for the rest of the movie, as a distraught Guile promises her that he will make Bison pay. After Bison is defeated by Ryu and Ken, Chun-Li pulls a prank on Guile by making it appear as if she has died while he was away.

Chun-Li is a regular character in the 1996 American animated series &quot;Street Fighter&quot;, voiced by Donna Yamamoto. The character reprises her film role as a reporter while she again seeks to avenge her father&#x27;s death at the hands of Bison, which is shown in flashback in the second episode, &quot;The Strongest Woman in the World&quot;.

In the 1997–1998 anime series &quot;Street Fighter II V&quot;, Chun-Li is voiced by Chisa Yokoyama in the original Japanese version, while Lia Sargent reprises her role in the English dub. Chun-Li is introduced as the 15-year-old daughter of Inspector Do-Rai, a Hong Kong police chief who has schooled her in the martial arts. While attempting to bring down a drug smuggling operation in the country, she works with Interpol to investigate a mysterious organization known as Shadowlaw. Chun-Li serves as the tour guide for Ryu and Ken when they pay a visit to work on their training; Ken is smitten with her and later buys her lavish gifts, including an engagement ring. Despite being underage, they enter a club in a dangerous part of town that hosts an underground fighting ring so Ryu and Ken can prove themselves as street fighters. After Ryu soundly defeats several opponents, the trio are marked for death by the ringleader as a result, and while on the run they encounter and battle various street gangs before being rescued by Chun-Li&#x27;s father. Traveling with Ryu and Ken to Spain, Chun-Li is stalked by an obsessive Vega, who presents her with a severed bull&#x27;s ear, intercepts her outside her hotel, sneaks into her room to kiss her while sleeping, then invites her to a masquerade ball that is actually a setup to get Ken to fight him in a cage match. The whole time, Chun-Li is under the influence of Vega&#x27;s love potion, but it wears off when Vega is defeated. Bison then accosts Chun-Li and she realizes that he is the leader of Shadowlaw, who, unbeknownst to her, had also hired Cammy to garrote Chun-Li&#x27;s father, an attack he barely survives. Chun-Li plays her largest role in the five-part finale, when she and Ryu are kidnapped and brainwashed by Bison via cyberchip embedded in their foreheads and like in the 1994 American film, she acquires her signature outfit while under Bison&#x27;s captivity. The chip puts her into an overly aggressive state, which she displays by snapping an opponent&#x27;s neck in combat, and she later manages to overpower Guile in battle before Ryu and Ken, during their victorious final fight against Bison, succeed in destroying the equipment triggering the chips (in addition to reducing the Shadowlaw base to ruins), returning Chun-Li to normal.

Chun-Li appears in the 1999 anime OVA &quot;Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation&quot;, voiced by Yumi Tōma in the original Japanese version and again by Lia Sargent in the English dub. There, she is as an Interpol agent who investigates a mad scientist called Sadler who works for Shadaloo. She believes the trail can lead her to her father, who at the time, was missing and presumed alive. She assists Ryu and Ken in finding a kidnapped boy named Shun who claims to be Ryu&#x27;s younger brother. While tracking Sadler, she accompanies Ryu to where Akuma lives and witnesses as Ryu is almost overcome by the Dark Hadou. She accompanies Ryu, Ken, Birdie, Dan, Guy, Dhalsim, Sodom and Rolento to Sadler&#x27;s hideout, where she sneaks into the facility with Ryu and Ken. She and Ken rescue the other fighters and end up in a tussle with Sadler&#x27;s android enforcer, Rosanov, who beats them severely. Ryu ultimately manages to destroy both Rosanov and Sadler, though Shun dies in the process after making peace with Ryu. In the aftermath, Chun-Li returns to Interpol

In the season 6 (2010) Halloween special of the cartoon series &quot;American Dad!&quot;, Toshi&#x27;s little sister Akiko goes trick-or-treating as Chun-Li. Chun-Li made cameo appearances in the animated films &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot; and &quot;Ralph Breaks the Internet&quot; alongside several fellow &quot;Street Fighter&quot; characters.

====Comics====

In the 1990s &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; manga by Masaomi Kanzaki, Chun-Li remains in her established role of an Interpol agent investigating Bison. As the story progresses, Chun-Li participates in a tournament arranged by Shadaloo, eventually coming up against Vega, portrayed here as her father&#x27;s killer. She defeats him but is so exhausted that she pulls out from the tournament and her injuries prevent her from doing much when Ryu and Bison confront one another

Chun-Li also appears in Masahiko Nakahira&#x27;s 1996–1997 manga &quot;Street Fighter: Sakura Ganbaru!&quot;, in which she participates in a police raid to an illegal underground fighting circle, saving Sakura from human traffickers who operated in the place. Later on, she follows the trails that lead her to an assassin which turns out to be Gen, from whom she suffers an utter defeat. She is last seen in Russia, parting ways with Sakura and Dan, with Cammy under her care. In the manga adaptations of &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot;, Chun-Li is again an agent of the Interpol. She encounters Ryu, who has fallen from grace and had hired himself out as a bodyguard to drug smugglers, and winds up befriending him and Birdie as well as Ken, also rescuing Cammy from being captured by Sodom. Shadaloo is once again responsible for the death of her father, though the exact identity of the killer is not revealed.

In Malibu Comics&#x27; short-lived &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series, Chun-Li is depicted as having known Ryu and Ken since her late teens, as well as having a romantic interest in Ryu, though both make their first appearances therein fighting each other after he sneaks up on her from behind. Chun-Li is also one of several &quot;Street Fighter&quot; characters featured in Archie Comics&#x27; &quot;Worlds Unite&quot; event, which saw several Capcom and Sega franchises crossover in the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic Universe, Mega Man,&quot; and &quot;Sonic Boom&quot; comic lines.

In UDON&#x27;s &quot;Street Fighter&quot; comics, Chun-Li again became a central character, involved in the hunt for Bison and Shadaloo. However, in the comic, the killer of Chun-Li&#x27;s father is Cammy, prior to her being freed from Bison&#x27;s control. Chun-Li battles Cammy when they meet face to face for the first time and ultimately forgives Cammy and turns her sights on Bison himself. Eventually, she receives an invitation from Shadaloo to enter a tournament being held by Bison. In 2008, UDON also released a four-issue special miniseries &quot;Street Fighter Legends: Chun-Li&quot;, which focuses on a younger Chun-Li and one of her first assignments for the Hong Kong police. She is working with her partner Po-Lin, a young policewoman who has a very personal score to settle with Shadaloo. Notably, one of the cases in which Chun-Li gets involved in the miniseries is the murder of Go Hibiki, Dan&#x27;s father, by Sagat&#x27;s hands. In the &quot;Street Fighter vs. Darkstalkers&quot; crossover series, she is a rival turned and uneasy ally of Morrigan.

==Promotion and merchandise==
There have been multiple Chun-Li lookalike contests in Japan, United States and elsewhere during the early 1990s, with valuable main prizes such as the Nissan 300ZX or the Honda CR-X. Later such contests have been performed on a much smaller scale. Chun-Li&#x27;s character was used to promote the film &quot;Ready Player One&quot; in Japan. In 2018, Japanese company Onitsuka Tiger collaborated with Capcom for Chun-Li to wear their new Mexico 66 SD line of sports shoes, and the 30th anniversary of &quot;Street Fighter&quot; collaboration between Capcom and Japan&#x27;s Saga Prefecture featured singer and actress Kayo Noro dressed as Chun-Li. Previously, actress Miki Mizuno also dressed as Chun-Li in another promotional event as did pop singer Maki Miyamae to perform Chun-Li&#x27;s official song on the television. In 1997, actress and pop star Rie Tomosaka played Chun-Li on television as well.

A wide variety of Chun-Li figures have been produced by various manufacturers, including by Capcom itself, Ace Novelty, BigBoysToys, Funko, Kotobukiya, Pop Culture Shock Collectibles, S.H. Figuart, SOTA Toys, Storm Collectibles, Takara Tomy, and Tsume-Art, among many others. Artworks of her were also featured on an officially licensed animated NubyTech/UDON joypad for the PlayStation 2, and a Mad Catz wireless joypad for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Other assorted merchandise included Diesel sneakers, women&#x27;s lingerie, a figure-style flash drive USB stick, a postage stamp from Japanese Philatelic Association came with its own collectible figure, and a figurine that came with a DyDo drink. There are also Chun-Li themed pachinko slot games, including &quot;Chun-Li Ni Makase China!&quot;, the first game of any kind that featured her in a starring role.

==Critical reception==
Chun-Li is widely regarded as one of the most popular characters in the series. As she is the first playable female fighting game character she has been dubbed as the &quot;first lady of Fighting games&quot;, the &quot;original videogame super-babe&quot;, and such. During the 1990s, &quot;GamePro&quot; chose her as the most iconic character of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; and years later called her &quot;everyone&#x27;s favorite feminine fighter&quot;. &quot;Mean Machines Sega&quot; noted her being &quot;a firm favourite among Street Fighter II fans”&quot;. Saturn Power&quot; described her as &quot;subject of childish giggles as computer journalists everywhere try as they might to grab a screenshot of her showing her knickers&quot;. Her return in &quot;Street Fighter III: Third Strike&quot; has been called as the main and best addition to the game by IGN and &quot;GamePro&quot;; Virgin&#x27;s head of distribution Peter Jones chose the &quot;saucy, sexy, dangerous and fast&quot; as definitely the best character of the game. Retrospectively, &quot;Xbox 360 Official Magazine – Australia&quot; used her and Samus Aran as examples of gaming&#x27;s original sex symbols prior to the advent of Lara Croft and &quot;Chilango&quot; wrote of her, Lara and Mai Shiranui as the video game women &quot;about whom we fantasied in the 90s&quot; and described Mai as &quot;SNK&#x27;s response to the overwhelming success of Chun-Li.&quot;

Nicholas Ware in a dissertation titled &quot;You Must Defeat Sheng Long to Stand a Chance&quot; noted that Chun-Li&#x27;s journey across the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; game is consistent due to her desire to defeat Bison, she and other character wanting to take down the villain are overshadowed by Akuma. The characters remain popular as noted with Jackie Chan parodying her a in a movie as not only due to comic relief but also due to his connection with both China and Japan.

For the &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; trilogy, Chun-Li was given a storyline that parallels the younger Ryu as both appear to be focused on revenge according to &quot;GamesRadar&quot;. Chun-Li was redesigned with an entire new outfit that GamesRadar found it fitting for an anime series but was disapproved by the fandom. This led to the optional &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; outfit in &quot;Alpha 2&quot;. The site praised her return in the &quot;Street Fighter III&quot; trilogy due to her more detailed sprites but found her new story about children she trains to be ridiculous. In a bigger overview of the series, Kotaku claims that &quot;Street Fighter 6&quot; provided the best incarnation of Chun-Li over 24 years ago as she is not longer obsessed with revenge against M. Bison and is instead portrayed in a more calm lifestyle while continuing to teach young children martial arts similar to the original ending from &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; where the fighter is now looking for a more peaceful lifestyle.

Chun-Li&#x27;s fans have included the rapper Kid Ink, and female gamers such as Codemasters manager Laura Peterson and media personality Violet Berlin. The creation of &quot;Street Fighter II: Champion Edition&quot; was in fact inspired by an argument between two girls over which one of them would play as Chun-Li, which was witnessed by Capcom USA&#x27;s Jeff Walker who then asked Capcom&#x27;s founder Kenzo Tsujimoto to make a version allowing both players to play the same character. According to the Smithsonian Museum&#x27;s Chris Mellisinos, Chun-Li &quot;was such an anomaly. How many times did you have the chance to play as a strong female character in arcades? She was drawn attractively, just like Ken and Ryu, but in no way was she a diminished character because she was female.&quot; Video game scholar Jennifer deWinter felt it was furthermore very &quot;interesting and surprising to have such a strong Chinese character in Chun-Li coming out of a Japanese game.&quot; Nevertheless, &quot;PSM&quot; noted by 1997 how &quot;a vocal minority believes that [gaming&#x27;s] female characters do very little to attract women. These people argue that Chun Li, Lara Croft, and most other female game characters are designed primarily for a male gamer&#x27;s satisfaction, and not geared towards the needs of women garners at all.&quot; In contrast to her good appearance, Chun-Li&#x27;s design in &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite&quot; was the subject of negative responses by fans resulting into Capcom revising it in a patch.

===Cultural impact===
Many fighting game characters from the 1990s that have been directly inspired by Chun-Li in terms of both graphics and gameplay include Li Xiang Fei in &quot;Real Bout Fatal Fury 2: The Newcomers&quot;, Liu Feilin in &quot;Fighter&#x27;s History&quot;, and Sekka in &quot;Double Dragon V: The Shadow Falls&quot;. Similarities with Chun-Li were further observed in various other characters, such as the move sets of Jamm in &quot;Golden Axe: The Duel&quot; and Miyabi in &quot;Raging Fighter&quot;, or the looks of Mei Mei in unreleased &quot;Mission: Deadly Skies.&quot; Her success furthermore directly contributed to the creation of such characters (besides &quot;Street Fighter&quot;&#x27;s own Cammy) as &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;&#x27;s Sonya Blade, followed by Kitana and Mileena; popular fighting characters that resemble Chun-Li include Lei Fang (&quot;Dead or Alive&quot;), Ling Xiaoyu (&quot;Tekken&quot;), and Pai Chan (&quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;). In the 1992 Hong-Kong film &quot;Super Lady Cop&quot;, Cynthia Khan&#x27;s character Ling is nicknamed &quot;Chun Li&quot; in an inspired role, including using some of Chun-Li&#x27;s moves.

Others who have dressed as Chun-Li have included Japanese gravure idols Akina Minami, Erina Kamiya, Yuka Kuramochi and Yuri Morishita, former Italian model Francesca Dani, Japanese model Haruna Anno, Korean MMA fighter Jenny Huang, Russian bodybuilder Julia Vins, Japanese model and media personality Kayo Satoh, Japanese singer and model Kyary Pamyu Pamyu, American actress Ming-Na Wen (aside from having portrayed the character in the 1994 film), former Japanese muscle idol Reika Saiki, Chinese doctor and bodybuilder Yuan Herong, Chengxiao from the Korean-Chinese idol group Cosmic Girls, and Turkish media personality Aşkım İrem Aktulga who was transformed into Chun-Li in the show &quot;Red Bull Shape Shifters&quot;. Some of them have been also male, such as Japanese wrestler Hiroshi Tanahashi or Australian stunt actor and wrestler Ladybeard.

&quot;Street Fighter&quot; player Ricki Ortiz built the majority of her 20-year career around the character of Chun-Li. She picked the character as a child because Chun-Li was the only female character in &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, and she built up an extreme loyalty around the character. Chun-Li was significantly nerfed in 2008 and 2017, rendering the character nonviable for competitive play.

<text>Laser propulsion is a form of beam-powered propulsion where the energy source is a remote (usually ground-based) laser system and separate from the reaction mass. This form of propulsion differs from a conventional chemical rocket where both energy and reaction mass come from the solid or liquid propellants carried on board the vehicle.

There are two main approaches: off-board, where the laser source is external to the spacecraft, and onboard, where the laser is part of the spacecraft&#x27;s propulsion system. Off-board laser propulsion, which includes laser-powered launches and laser light sails, eliminates the need for the spacecraft to carry its own energy source. Onboard laser propulsion involves using lasers in nuclear fusion or ionizing interstellar gas for propulsion.
==History==
The basic concepts underlying a photon-propelled &quot;sail&quot; propulsion system were developed by Eugene Sanger and the Hungarian physicist György Marx. Propulsion concepts using laser-energized rockets were developed in the 1970s by Arthur Kantrowitz and Wolfgang Moekel, with a variant using laser ablation pioneered by Leik Myrabo. An exposition of Kantrowitz&#x27;s laser propulsion ideas was published in 1988.

Laser propulsion systems may transfer momentum to a spacecraft in two different ways. The first way uses photon radiation pressure to drive momentum transfer and is the principle behind solar sails and laser sails. The second method uses the laser to help expel mass from the spacecraft as in a conventional rocket. Thus, the first uses the laser for both energy and reaction mass, while the second uses the laser for energy, but carries reaction mass. Thus, the second is fundamentally limited in final spacecraft velocities by the rocket equation.

==Laser-pushed lightsail==
A laser-pushed lightsail is a thin reflective sail similar to a solar sail, in which the sail is being pushed by a laser, rather than the sun. The advantage of lightsail propulsion is that the vehicle does not carry either the energy source or the reaction mass for propulsion, and hence the limitations of the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation to achieving high velocities are avoided. Use of a laser-pushed lightsail was proposed initially by Marx in 1966, as a method of interstellar travel that would avoid extremely high mass ratios by not carrying fuel, and analyzed in detail by physicist Robert L. Forward in 1989. Further analysis of the concept was done by Landis, Mallove and Matloff, Andrews and others.

A large diameter beam is required so that only a small portion misses the sail due to diffraction, and the spacecraft must have strong pointing stability capabilities so it can tilt its sails fast enough to follow the center of the beam. These requirements increase in importance as mission complexity increases, such as when moving from interplanetary to interstellar missions, and when moving from flyby missions to one-way landing missions and then to return missions. 

The laser may alternatively consist of a large phased array of small devices that receive their energy directly from solar radiation.

The laser-pushed sail is proposed as a method of propelling a small interstellar probe by the Breakthrough Starshot project.

Another method of moving a much larger spacecraft to high velocities is by using a laser system to propel a stream of much smaller sails. Each alternative mini sail is slowed down by a laser from the home system so that they collide at ionising velocities. The ionising collisions could then be used to interact with a powerful magnetic field on the spacecraft to provide a force to power and move it. 

An extension of the idea is to utilize nuclear materials on the mini sails. These materials would undergo fission or fusion, greatly increasing the magnitude of the imparted force. However, this approach would require much higher collision velocities compared to non-nuclear implementations.

===Photon recycling===
Metzgar and Landis proposed a variant on the laser-pushed sail, in which the photons reflected from the sail are re-used by re-reflecting them back to the sail by a stationary mirror; a &quot;multi-bounce laser-based sail.&quot; This amplifies the force produced by recycling the photons, resulting in considerably higher force produced from the same laser power. There is also a multi-bounce photonic sail configuration which uses a large Fresnel lens around a laser generating system. In this configuration the laser shines light on a probe sail accelerating it outwards which is then reflected back through the Fresnel lens to be reflected off a larger more massive reflector probe going in the other direction. The laser light is reflected back and forth many times improving the force transmitted but importantly allows the large lens to remain in a more stable position as it is not greatly influenced by the laser lights momentum.

An optical cavity allows greater re-use of photons, but keeping the beam in the cavity becomes much more challenging. An optical cavity can be made with two high-reflectance mirrors, forming a Fabry–Pérot optical resonance cavity in which any small movement of mirrors would destroy the resonance condition and null photonic thrust. Such optical cavities are used for gravitational wave detection as in LIGO, for their extreme sensitivity to the movement of mirror. Bae originally proposed to use photon recycling for use in a nanometer accuracy formation flight of satellites for this reason. Bae, however, discovered that in an active optical cavity formed by two high-reflectance mirrors and a laser gain medium in between, similar to the typical laser cavity, photon recycling becomes less sensitive to the movement of mirrors. Bae named the laser thruster based on the photon recycling in an active optical cavity Photonic Laser Thruster (PLT). In 2015 his team demonstrated the number of photon recycling up to 1,540 over a distance of a few meters and photonic thrusts up to 3.5 mN with the use of a 500 W laser system. In a laboratory demonstration, a Cubesat (0.75 kg in weight) was propelled with PLT.

==Laser energized rocket==
There are several forms of laser propulsion in which the laser is used as an energy source to provide momentum to propellant that is carried on board the rocket. The use of a laser as the energy source means that the energy provided to the propellant is not limited by the chemical energy of the propellant.

===Laser thermal rocket ===
The laser thermal rocket (heat exchanger (HX) thruster) is a thermal rocket in which the propellant is heated by energy provided by an external laser beam. The beam heats a solid heat exchanger, which in turn heats an inert liquid propellant, converting it to hot gas which is exhausted through a conventional nozzle. This is similar in principle to nuclear thermal and solar thermal propulsion. Using a large flat heat exchanger allows the laser beam to shine directly on the heat exchanger without focusing optics on the vehicle. The HX thruster has the advantage of working equally well with any laser wavelength and both CW and pulsed lasers, and of having an efficiency approaching 100%. The HX thruster is limited by the heat exchanger material and by radiative losses to relatively low gas temperatures, typically 1000–2000 °C. For a given temperature, the specific impulse is maximized with the minimum molecular weight reaction mass, and with hydrogen propellant, that provides sufficient specific impulse as high as 600–800 seconds, high enough in principle to allow single stage vehicles to reach low Earth orbit. The HX laser thruster concept was developed by Jordin Kare in 1991; a similar microwave thermal propulsion concept was developed independently by Kevin L. Parkin at Caltech in 2001.

A variation on this concept was proposed by Prof. John Sinko and Dr. Clifford Schlecht as a redundant safety concept for assets on orbit. Packets of enclosed propellants are attached to the outside of a space suit, and exhaust channels run from each packet to the far side of the astronaut or tool. A laser beam from a space station or shuttle vaporizes the propellant inside the packs. Exhaust is directed behind the astronaut or tool, pulling the target towards the laser source. To brake the approach, a second wavelength is used to ablate the exterior of the propellant packets on the near side.

In 2022 a paper was published by researchers from McGill University proposing a laser thermal propulsion system to be used to send a spacecraft to Mars in 45 days. One of the main advantages of using the proposed laser thermal propulsion system for sending spacecraft to Mars is reducing astronaut exposure to cosmic rays by reducing the transit time outside of Earth&#x27;s Magnetosphere.

===Laser mirror rocket ===

In this design a lens and/or parabolic mirror focuses laser light into a small hole in a mirror that leads into a tube which is highly reflective inside and completely open at the other end. A phased-array laser is pulsed from Earth at the spacecraft where the laser light is focused into the tube to a waiting mobile mirror disc which will be the reaction mass. The pulse of laser light becomes trapped in the tube, bouncing back and forth and accelerating the mirror disc out at very high velocity. The mirrors are moved into position inside the tube from magazines on the side of the craft after the laser pulse has switched off. Accelerations of millions of g&#x27;s are possible for these small highly reflective mirrors, and velocities over short distances can reach into the tens of kilometers per second, allowing specific impulses in the thousands. For example if a mirror disc is accelerated over 10 m at 2 million g it will reach a velocity of 20 km/s at the exit, this is over four times higher than the exhaust velocity of a hydrogen/oxygen rocket motor which is around 4.5 km/s. A comparison of specific impulses between the space shuttle&#x27;s hydrogen/oxygen engines which has a specific impulse of 453 and the above cited example yields a specific impulse of 2034 for the mirror rocket which is a significant improvement. Clever control of the discs would allow much longer acceleration periods as well and therefore higher exit velocities. Jordin Kare calculated that these mirrored discs could theoretically be pushed to around 32 million g but would be at the limit of any material&#x27;s strength and subject to total failure. The propulsion design can be used on spacecraft going out directly from Earth&#x27;s orbit or coming towards the Earth as in a returning elliptical orbit.

===Ablative laser propulsion===
Ablative laser propulsion (ALP) is a form of beam-powered propulsion in which an external pulsed laser is used to burn off a plasma plume from a solid metal propellant, thus producing thrust. The measured specific impulse of small ALP setups is very high at about 5000 s (49 kN·s/kg), and unlike the lightcraft developed by Leik Myrabo which uses air as the propellant, ALP can be used in space.

Material is directly removed from a solid or liquid surface at high velocities by laser ablation by a pulsed laser. Depending on the laser flux and pulse duration, the material can be simply heated and evaporated, or converted to plasma. Ablative propulsion will work in air or vacuum. Specific impulse values from 200 seconds to several thousand seconds are possible by choosing the propellant and laser pulse characteristics. Variations of ablative propulsion include double-pulse propulsion in which one laser pulse ablates material and a second laser pulse further heats the ablated gas, laser micropropulsion in which a small laser on board a spacecraft ablates very small amounts of propellant for attitude control or maneuvering, and space debris removal, in which the laser ablates material from debris particles in low Earth orbit, changing their orbits and causing them to reenter.

University of Alabama Huntsville Propulsion Research Center has researched ALP.

===Pulsed plasma propulsion===
A high energy pulse focused in a gas or on a solid surface surrounded by gas produces breakdown of the gas (usually air). This causes an expanding shock wave which absorbs laser energy at the shock front (a laser sustained detonation wave or LSD wave); expansion of the hot plasma behind the shock front during and after the pulse transmits momentum to the craft. Pulsed plasma propulsion using air as the working fluid is the simplest form of air-breathing laser propulsion. The record-breaking lightcraft, developed by Leik Myrabo of RPI (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute) and Frank Mead, works on this principle.

Another concept of pulsed plasma propulsion is being investigated by Prof. Hideyuki Horisawa.

===CW plasma propulsion===
A continuous laser beam focused in a flowing stream of gas creates a stable laser sustained plasma which heats the gas; the hot gas is then expanded through a conventional nozzle to produce thrust. Because the plasma does not touch the walls of the engine, very high gas temperatures are possible, as in gas core nuclear thermal propulsion. However, to achieve high specific impulse, the propellant must have low molecular weight; hydrogen is usually assumed for actual use, at specific impulses around 1,000 seconds. CW plasma propulsion has the disadvantage that the laser beam must be precisely focused into the absorption chamber, either through a window or by using a specially-shaped nozzle. CW plasma thruster experiments were performed in the 1970s and 1980s, primarily by Dr. Dennis Keefer of UTSI and Prof. Herman Krier of the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign.

=== Pellet-beam propulsion ===
This proposal would require two spacecraft: one that travels and another in Earth orbit to propel the former. The second spacecraft would fire thousands of metal pellets at the first. It would either shoot a laser at the first spacecraft or align a laser from the Earth at the first spacecraft. The laser would ablate some material from each pellet, propelling them at high speeds (&gt;120 km/s) to provide thrust to the spacecraft. This method could allow a spacecraft to reach the outer planets in less than a year, 100 AU from the Sun in 3 years and the solar gravitational lens in 15 years. It would also be able to propel heavier spacecraft than other propulsion concepts (~1 ton in mass).

===Laser electric propulsion===
A general class of propulsion techniques in which the laser beam power is converted to electricity, which then powers some type of electric propulsion thruster.

A small quadcopter has flown for 12 hours and 26 minutes charged by a 2.25 kW laser (powered at less than half of its normal operating current), using 170 watt photovoltaic arrays as the power receiver, and a laser has been demonstrated to charge the batteries of an unmanned aerial vehicle in flight for 48 hours.

For spacecraft, laser electric propulsion is considered as a competitor to solar electric or nuclear electric propulsion for low-thrust propulsion in space. However, Leik Myrabo has proposed high-thrust laser electric propulsion, using magnetohydrodynamics to convert laser energy to electricity and to electrically accelerate air around a vehicle for thrust.

<text>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a type of degenerative joint disease that results from breakdown of joint cartilage and underlying bone. It is believed to be the fourth leading cause of disability in the world, affecting 1 in 7 adults in the United States alone. The most common symptoms are joint pain and stiffness. Usually the symptoms progress slowly over years. Other symptoms may include joint swelling, decreased range of motion, and, when the back is affected, weakness or numbness of the arms and legs. The most commonly involved joints are the two near the ends of the fingers and the joint at the base of the thumbs, the knee and hip joints, and the joints of the neck and lower back. The symptoms can interfere with work and normal daily activities. Unlike some other types of arthritis, only the joints, not internal organs, are affected.

Causes include previous joint injury, abnormal joint or limb development, and inherited factors. Risk is greater in those who are overweight, have legs of different lengths, or have jobs that result in high levels of joint stress. Osteoarthritis is believed to be caused by mechanical stress on the joint and low grade inflammatory processes. It develops as cartilage is lost and the underlying bone becomes affected. As pain may make it difficult to exercise, muscle loss may occur. Diagnosis is typically based on signs and symptoms, with medical imaging and other tests used to support or rule out other problems. In contrast to rheumatoid arthritis, in osteoarthritis the joints do not become hot or red.

Treatment includes exercise, decreasing joint stress such as by rest or use of a cane, support groups, and pain medications. Weight loss may help in those who are overweight. Pain medications may include paracetamol (acetaminophen) as well as NSAIDs such as naproxen or ibuprofen. Long-term opioid use is not recommended due to lack of information on benefits as well as risks of addiction and other side effects. Joint replacement surgery may be an option if there is ongoing disability despite other treatments. An artificial joint typically lasts 10 to 15 years.

Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, affecting about 237million people or 3.3% of the world&#x27;s population as of 2015. It becomes more common as people age. Among those over 60 years old, about 10% of males and 18% of females are affected. Osteoarthritis is the cause of about 2% of years lived with disability.
==Signs and symptoms==

The main symptom is pain, causing loss of ability and often stiffness. The pain is typically made worse by prolonged activity and relieved by rest. Stiffness is most common in the morning, and typically lasts less than thirty minutes after beginning daily activities, but may return after periods of inactivity. Osteoarthritis can cause a crackling noise (called &quot;crepitus&quot;) when the affected joint is moved, especially shoulder and knee joint. A person may also complain of joint locking and joint instability. These symptoms would affect their daily activities due to pain and stiffness. Some people report increased pain associated with cold temperature, high humidity, or a drop in barometric pressure, but studies have had mixed results.

Osteoarthritis commonly affects the hands, feet, spine, and the large weight-bearing joints, such as the hips and knees, although in theory, any joint in the body can be affected. As osteoarthritis progresses, movement patterns (such as gait), are typically affected. Osteoarthritis is the most common cause of a joint effusion of the knee.

In smaller joints, such as at the fingers, hard bony enlargements, called Heberden&#x27;s nodes (on the distal interphalangeal joints) or Bouchard&#x27;s nodes (on the proximal interphalangeal joints), may form, and though they are not necessarily painful, they do limit the movement of the fingers significantly. Osteoarthritis of the toes may be a factor causing formation of bunions, rendering them red or swollen.

==Causes==
Damage from mechanical stress with insufficient self repair by joints is believed to be the primary cause of osteoarthritis. Sources of this stress may include misalignments of bones caused by congenital or pathogenic causes; mechanical injury; excess body weight; loss of strength in the muscles supporting a joint; and impairment of peripheral nerves, leading to sudden or uncoordinated movements. The risk of osteoarthritis increases with aging, history of joint injury, or family history of osteoarthritis. However exercise, including running in the absence of injury, has not been found to increase the risk of knee osteoarthritis. Nor has cracking one&#x27;s knuckles been found to play a role. 

===Primary===

The development of osteoarthritis is correlated with a history of previous joint injury and with obesity, especially with respect to knees. Changes in sex hormone levels may play a role in the development of osteoarthritis, as it is more prevalent among post-menopausal women than among men of the same age. Conflicting evidence exists for the differences in hip and knee osteoarthritis in African Americans and Caucasians.

====Occupational====

Increased risk of developing knee and hip osteoarthritis was found among those who work with manual handling (e.g. lifting), have physically demanding work, walk at work, and have climbing tasks at work (e.g. climb stairs or ladders). With hip osteoarthritis, in particular, increased risk of development over time was found among those who work in bent or twisted positions. For knee osteoarthritis, in particular, increased risk was found among those who work in a kneeling or squatting position, experience heavy lifting in combination with a kneeling or squatting posture, and work standing up. Women and men have similar occupational risks for the development of osteoarthritis.

===Secondary===

This type of osteoarthritis is caused by other factors but the resulting pathology is the same as for primary osteoarthritis:
* Alkaptonuria
* Congenital disorders of joints
* Diabetes doubles the risk of having a joint replacement due to osteoarthritis and people with diabetes have joint replacements at a younger age than those without diabetes.
* Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
* Hemochromatosis and Wilson&#x27;s disease
* Inflammatory diseases (such as Perthes&#x27; disease), (Lyme disease), and all chronic forms of arthritis (e.g., costochondritis, gout, and rheumatoid arthritis). In gout, uric acid crystals cause the cartilage to degenerate at a faster pace.
* Injury to joints or ligaments (such as the ACL) as a result of an accident or orthopedic operations.
* Ligamentous deterioration or instability may be a factor.
* Marfan syndrome
* Obesity
* Joint infection

==Pathophysiology==

While osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that may cause gross cartilage loss and morphological damage to other joint tissues, more subtle biochemical changes occur in the earliest stages of osteoarthritis progression. The water content of healthy cartilage is finely balanced by compressive force driving water out and hydrostatic and osmotic pressure drawing water in. Collagen fibres exert the compressive force, whereas the Gibbs–Donnan effect and cartilage proteoglycans create osmotic pressure which tends to draw water in.

However, during onset of osteoarthritis, the collagen matrix becomes more disorganized and there is a decrease in proteoglycan content within cartilage. The breakdown of collagen fibers results in a net increase in water content. This increase occurs because whilst there is an overall loss of proteoglycans (and thus a decreased osmotic pull), it is outweighed by a loss of collagen.

Other structures within the joint can also be affected. The ligaments within the joint become thickened and fibrotic, and the menisci can become damaged and wear away. Menisci can be completely absent by the time a person undergoes a joint replacement. New bone outgrowths, called &quot;spurs&quot; or osteophytes, can form on the margins of the joints, possibly in an attempt to improve the congruence of the articular cartilage surfaces in the absence of the menisci. The subchondral bone volume increases and becomes less mineralized (hypo mineralization). All these changes can cause problems functioning. The pain in an osteoarthritic joint has been related to thickened synovium and to subchondral bone lesions.

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis is made with reasonable certainty based on history and clinical examination. X-rays may confirm the diagnosis. The typical changes seen on X-ray include: joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis (increased bone formation around the joint), subchondral cyst formation, and osteophytes. Plain films may not correlate with the findings on physical examination or with the degree of pain.

In 1990, the American College of Rheumatology, using data from a multi-center study, developed a set of criteria for the diagnosis of hand osteoarthritis based on hard tissue enlargement and swelling of certain joints. These criteria were found to be 92% sensitive and 98% specific for hand osteoarthritis versus other entities such as rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthropathies.

===Classification===

A number of classification systems are used for gradation of osteoarthritis:
* WOMAC scale, taking into account pain, stiffness and functional limitation.
* Kellgren-Lawrence grading scale for osteoarthritis of the knee. It uses only projectional radiography features.
* Tönnis classification for osteoarthritis of the hip joint, also using only projectional radiography features.
Both primary generalized nodal osteoarthritis and erosive osteoarthritis (EOA, also called inflammatory osteoarthritis) are sub-sets of primary osteoarthritis. EOA is a much less common, and more aggressive inflammatory form of osteoarthritis which often affects the distal interphalangeal joints of the hand and has characteristic articular erosive changes on X-ray.

==Management==

Lifestyle modification (such as weight loss and exercise) and pain medications are the mainstays of treatment. Acetaminophen (also known as paracetamol) is recommended first line, with NSAIDs being used as add-on therapy only if pain relief is not sufficient. Medications that alter the course of the disease have not been found as of 2018. For overweight people, weight loss may help relieve pain due to hip arthritis. Recommendations include modification of risk factors through targeted interventions including 1) obesity and overweight, 2) physical activity, 3) dietary exposures, 4) comorbidities, 5) biomechanical factors, 6) occupational factors.

Successful management of the condition is often made more difficult by differing priorities and poor communication between clinicians and people with osteoarthritis. Realistic treatment goals can be achieved by developing a shared understanding of the condition, actively listening to patient concerns, avoiding medical jargon and tailoring treatment plans to the patient&#x27;s needs.

===Exercise ===
Weight loss and exercise provide long-term treatment and are advocated in people with osteoarthritis. Weight loss and exercise are the most safe and effective long-term treatments, in contrast to short-term treatments which usually have risk of long-term harm. 

High impact exercise can increase the risk of joint injury, whereas low or moderate impact exercise, such as walking or swimming, is safer for people with osteoarthritis. A study has suggested that an increase in blood calcium levels had a positive impact on osteoarthritis. An adequate dietary calcium intake and regular weight-bearing exercise can increase calcium levels and is helpful in preventing osteoarthritis in the general population. There is also a weak protective effect factor of LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol. However, this is not recommended since an increase in LDL has an increased chance of cardiovascular comorbidities.

Moderate exercise may be beneficial with respect to pain and function in those with osteoarthritis of the knee and hip. These exercises should occur at least three times per week, under supervision, and focused on specific forms of exercise found to be most beneficial for this form of osteoarthritis. 

While some evidence supports certain physical therapies, evidence for a combined program is limited. Providing clear advice, making exercises enjoyable, and reassuring people about the importance of doing exercises may lead to greater benefit and more participation. Some evidence suggests that supervised exercise therapy may improve exercise adherence, although for knee osteoarthritis supervised exercise has shown the best results.

===Physical measures===
There is not enough evidence to determine the effectiveness of massage therapy. The evidence for manual therapy is inconclusive. A 2015 review indicated that aquatic therapy is safe, effective, and can be an adjunct therapy for knee osteoarthritis.

Functional, gait, and balance training have been recommended to address impairments of position sense, balance, and strength in individuals with lower extremity arthritis, as these can contribute to a higher rate of falls in older individuals. For people with hand osteoarthritis, exercises may provide small benefits for improving hand function, reducing pain, and relieving finger joint stiffness.

A study showed that there is low quality evidence that weak knee extensor muscle increased the chances of knee osteoarthritis. Strengthening of the knee extensors could possibly prevent knee osteoarthritis.

Lateral wedge insoles and neutral insoles do not appear to be useful in osteoarthritis of the knee. Knee braces may help, but their usefulness has also been disputed. For pain management, heat can be used to relieve stiffness, and cold can relieve muscle spasms and pain. Among people with hip and knee osteoarthritis, exercise in water may reduce pain and disability, and increase quality of life in the short term. Therapeutic exercise programs, such as aerobics and walking, may reduce pain and improve physical functioning for up to 6 months after the end of the program for people with knee osteoarthritis. Hydrotherapy might also be an advantage on the management of pain, disability and quality of life reported by people with osteoarthritis.

===Thermotherapy===
A 2003 Cochrane review of 7 studies between 1969 and 1999 found ice massage to be of significant benefit in improving range of motion and function, though not necessarily relief of pain. Cold packs could decrease swelling, but hot packs had no effect on swelling. Heat therapy could increase circulation, thereby reducing pain and stiffness, but with risk of inflammation and edema.

===Medication===
====By mouth====
The pain medication paracetamol (acetaminophen) is the first line treatment for osteoarthritis. Pain relief does not differ according to dosage. However, a 2015 review found acetaminophen to have only a small short-term benefit with some concerns on abnormal results for liver function test. For mild to moderate symptoms effectiveness of acetaminophen is similar to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as naproxen, though for more severe symptoms NSAIDs may be more effective. NSAIDs are associated with greater side effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding.

Another class of NSAIDs, COX-2 selective inhibitors (such as celecoxib) are equally effective when compared to nonselective NSAIDs, and have lower rates of adverse gastrointestinal effects, but higher rates of cardiovascular disease such as myocardial infarction. They are also more expensive than non-specific NSAIDs. Benefits and risks vary in individuals and need consideration when making treatment decisions, and further unbiased research comparing NSAIDS and COX-2 selective inhibitors is needed. NSAIDS applied topically are effective for a small number of people. The COX-2 selective inhibitor rofecoxib was removed from the market in 2004, as cardiovascular events were associated with long term use.

Education is helpful in self-management of arthritis, and can provide coping methods leading to about 20% more pain relief when compared to NSAIDs alone.

Failure to achieve desired pain relief in osteoarthritis after two weeks should trigger reassessment of dosage and pain medication. Opioids by mouth, including both weak opioids such as tramadol and stronger opioids, are also often prescribed. Their appropriateness is uncertain, and opioids are often recommended only when first line therapies have failed or are contraindicated. This is due to their small benefit and relatively large risk of side effects. The use of tramadol likely does not improve pain or physical function and likely increases the incidence of adverse side effects. Oral steroids are not recommended in the treatment of osteoarthritis.

Use of the antibiotic doxycycline orally for treating osteoarthritis is not associated with clinical improvements in function or joint pain. Any small benefit related to the potential for doxycycline therapy to address the narrowing of the joint space is not clear, and any benefit is outweighed by the potential harm from side effects.

A 2018 meta-analysis found that oral collagen supplementation for the treatment of osteoarthritis reduces stiffness but does not improve pain and functional limitation.

====Topical====
There are several NSAIDs available for topical use, including diclofenac. A Cochrane review from 2016 concluded that reasonably reliable evidence is available only for use of topical diclofenac and ketoprofen in people aged over 40 years with painful knee arthritis. Transdermal opioid pain medications are not typically recommended in the treatment of osteoarthritis. The use of topical capsaicin to treat osteoarthritis is controversial, as some reviews found benefit while others did not.

====Joint injections====
 Use of analgesia, intra-articular cortisone injection and consideration of hyaluronic acids and platelet-rich plasma are recommended for pain relief in people with knee osteoarthritis.

Local drug delivery by intra-articular injection may be more effective and safer in terms of increased bioavailability, less systemic exposure and reduced adverse events. Several intra-articular medications for symptomatic treatment are available on the market as follows.

===== Steroids =====
Joint injection of glucocorticoids (such as hydrocortisone) leads to short-term pain relief that may last between a few weeks and a few months.

A 2015 Cochrane review found that intra-articular corticosteroid injections of the knee did not benefit quality of life and had no effect on knee joint space; clinical effects one to six weeks after injection could not be determined clearly due to poor study quality. Another 2015 study reported negative effects of intra-articular corticosteroid injections at higher doses, and a 2017 trial showed reduction in cartilage thickness with intra-articular triamcinolone every 12 weeks for 2 years compared to placebo. A 2018 study found that intra-articular triamcinolone is associated with an increase in intraocular pressure.

===== Hyaluronic acid =====
Injections of hyaluronic acid have not produced improvement compared to placebo for knee arthritis, but did increase risk of further pain. In ankle osteoarthritis, evidence is unclear.

===== Platelet-rich plasma =====
The effectiveness of injections of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is unclear; there are suggestions that such injections improve function but not pain, and are associated with increased risk. A 2014 Cochrane review of studies involving PRP found the evidence to be insufficient.

===== Radiosynoviorthesis =====

Injection of beta particle-emitting radioisotopes (called &quot;radiosynoviorthesis&quot;) is used for the local treatment of inflammatory joint conditions.

===Radiotherapy===
Low-dose radiotherapy has been shown to improve pain and mobility of affected joints, primarily in extremities. It is approximately 70-90% effective, with minimal side effects.

===Ablation of knee sensory nerves===
Radiofrequency ablation of sensory knee nerves, also called &quot;genicular neurotomy&quot; or &quot;genicular RFA&quot;, is an outpatient procedure used to reduce pain from knee osteoarthritis.

In the procedure for genicular RFA, a guide cannula is first directed under local anesthesia and imaging (ultrasound or fluoroscopy) to each target genicular nerve, then the radiofrequency electrode is passed through the cannula, and the electrode tip is heated to about for one minute to cauterize a small segment of the nerve. The heat destroys that segment of the nerve, which is prevented from sending pain signals to the brain.

As of 2023, reviews of clinical outcomes indicated that efficacy for reducing knee pain was achieved by ablating three or more branches of the genicular nerve (one of the articular branches of the tibial nerve). Other sources indicate 4-5 genicular nerve targets may be justified for ablation to optimize pain relief, while a 2022 analysis indicated that as many as 10 genicular nerve targets for RFA would produce better long-term relief of knee pain.

Knee pain relief of 50% or more following genicular RFA may last from several months to two years, and can be repeated by the same outpatient procedure when pain recurs.

Injection of phenol may be used as a neurolytic treatment of sensory knee nerves to relieve chronic pain from knee osteoarthritis.

===Surgery===

==== Bone fusion ====
Arthrodesis (fusion) of the bones may be an option in some types of osteoarthritis. An example is ankle osteoarthritis, in which ankle fusion is considered to be the gold standard treatment in end-stage cases.

==== Joint replacement ====
If the impact of symptoms of osteoarthritis on quality of life is significant and more conservative management is ineffective, joint replacement surgery or resurfacing may be recommended. Evidence supports joint replacement for both knees and hips as it is both clinically effective and cost-effective. People who underwent total knee replacement had improved SF-12 quality of life scores, were feeling better compared to those who did not have surgery, and may have short- and long-term benefits for quality of life in terms of pain and function. The beneficial effects of these surgeries may be time-limited due to various environmental factors, comorbidities, and pain in other regions of the body.

For people who have shoulder osteoarthritis and do not respond to medications, surgical options include a shoulder hemiarthroplasty (replacing a part of the joint), and total shoulder arthroplasty (replacing the joint).

Biological joint replacement involves replacing the diseased tissues with new ones. This can either be from the person (autograft) or from a donor (allograft). People undergoing a joint transplant (osteochondral allograft) do not need to take immunosuppressants as bone and cartilage tissues have limited immune responses. Autologous articular cartilage transfer from a non-weight-bearing area to the damaged area, called osteochondral autograft transfer system, is one possible procedure that is being studied. When the missing cartilage is a focal defect, autologous chondrocyte implantation is also an option.

==== Shoulder replacement ====
For those with osteoarthritis in the shoulder, a complete shoulder replacement is sometimes suggested to improve pain and function. Demand for this treatment is expected to increase by 750% by the year 2030. There are different options for shoulder replacement surgeries, however, there is a lack of evidence in the form of high-quality randomized controlled trials, to determine which type of shoulder replacement surgery is most effective in different situations, what are the risks involved with different approaches, or how the procedure compares to other treatment options. There is some low-quality evidence that indicates that when comparing total shoulder arthroplasty over hemiarthroplasty, no large clinical benefit was detected in the short term. It is not clear if the risk of harm differs between total shoulder arthroplasty or a hemiarthroplasty approach.

==== Other surgical options ====
Osteotomy may be useful in people with knee osteoarthritis, but has not been well studied and it is unclear whether it is more effective than non-surgical treatments or other types of surgery. Arthroscopic surgery is largely not recommended, as it does not improve outcomes in knee osteoarthritis, and may result in harm. It is unclear whether surgery is beneficial in people with mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis.

===Unverified treatments===

====Glucosamine and chondroitin====
The effectiveness of glucosamine is controversial. Reviews have found it to be equal to or slightly better than placebo. A difference may exist between glucosamine sulfate and glucosamine hydrochloride, with glucosamine sulfate showing a benefit and glucosamine hydrochloride not. The evidence for glucosamine sulfate having an effect on osteoarthritis progression is somewhat unclear and if present likely modest. The Osteoarthritis Research Society International recommends that glucosamine be discontinued if no effect is observed after six months and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence no longer recommends its use. Despite the difficulty in determining the efficacy of glucosamine, it remains a treatment option. The European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis (ESCEO) recommends glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate for knee osteoarthritis. Its use as a therapy for osteoarthritis is usually safe.

A 2015 Cochrane review of clinical trials of chondroitin found that most were of low quality, but that there was some evidence of short-term improvement in pain and few side effects; it does not appear to improve or maintain the health of affected joints.

====Supplements====
Avocado–soybean unsaponifiables (ASU) is an extract made from avocado oil and soybean oil sold under many brand names worldwide as a dietary supplement and as a prescription drug in France. A 2014 Cochrane review found that while ASU might help relieve pain in the short term for some people with osteoarthritis, it does not appear to improve or maintain the health of affected joints. The review noted a high-quality, two-year clinical trial comparing ASU to chondroitin which has uncertain efficacy in osteoarthritis with no difference between the two agents. The review also found there is insufficient evidence of ASU safety.

A few high-quality studies of &quot;Boswellia serrata&quot; show consistent, but small, improvements in pain and function. Curcumin, phytodolor, and s-adenosyl methionine (SAMe) may be effective in improving pain. A 2009 Cochrane review recommended against the routine use of SAMe, as there has not been sufficient high-quality clinical research to prove its effect. A 2021 review found that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) had no benefit in reducing pain and improving physical function in hand or knee osteoarthritis, and the off-label use of HCQ for people with osteoarthritis should be discouraged. There is no evidence for the use of colchicine for treating the pain of hand or knee arthritis.

There is limited evidence to support the use of hyaluronan, methylsulfonylmethane, rose hip, capsaicin, or vitamin D.

====Acupuncture and other interventions====
While acupuncture leads to improvements in pain relief, this improvement is small and may be of questionable importance. Waiting list–controlled trials for peripheral joint osteoarthritis do show clinically relevant benefits, but these may be due to placebo effects. Acupuncture does not seem to produce long-term benefits.

Electrostimulation techniques such as TENS have been used for twenty years to treat osteoarthritis in the knee. However, there is no conclusive evidence to show that it reduces pain or disability. A Cochrane review of low-level laser therapy found unclear evidence of benefit, whereas another review found short-term pain relief for osteoarthritic knees.

Further research is needed to determine if balnotherapy for osteoarthritis (mineral baths or spa treatments) improves a person&#x27;s quality of life or ability to function. The use of ice or cold packs may be beneficial; however, further research is needed. There is no evidence of benefit from placing hot packs on joints.

There is low quality evidence that therapeutic ultrasound may be beneficial for people with osteoarthritis of the knee; however, further research is needed to confirm and determine the degree and significance of this potential benefit.

Therapeutic ultrasound is safe and helps reducing pain and improving physical function for knee osteoarthritis.
While phonophoresis does not improve functions, it may offer greater pain relief than standard non-drug ultrasound.

Continuous and pulsed ultrasound modes (especially 1 MHz, 2.5 W/cm2, 15min/ session, 3 session/ week, during 8 weeks protocol) may be effective in improving patients physical function and pain.

There is weak evidence suggesting that electromagnetic field treatment may result in moderate pain relief; however, further research is necessary and it is not known if electromagnetic field treatment can improve quality of life or function.

Viscosupplementation for osteoarthritis of the knee may have positive effects on pain and function at 5 to 13 weeks post-injection.

==Epidemiology==

Globally, , approximately 250million people had osteoarthritis of the knee (3.6% of the population). Hip osteoarthritis affects about 0.85% of the population.

, osteoarthritis globally causes moderate to severe disability in 43.4 million people. Together, knee and hip osteoarthritis had a ranking for disability globally of 11th among 291 disease conditions assessed.

=== Middle East and North Africa (MENA) ===
In the Middle East and North Africa from 1990 to 2019, the prevalence of people with hip osteoarthritis increased threefold over the three decades, a total of 1.28 million cases. It increased 2.88-fold, from 6.16 million cases to 17.75 million, between 1990 and 2019 for knee osteoarthritis. Hand osteoarthritis in MENA also increased 2.7-fold, from 1.6 million cases to 4.3 million from 1990 to 2019.

=== United States ===
, osteoarthritis affected 52.5 million people in the United States, approximately 50% of whom were 65 years or older. It is estimated that 80% of the population have radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis by age 65, although only 60% of those will have symptoms. The rate of osteoarthritis in the United States is forecast to be 78 million (26%) adults by 2040.

In the United States, there were approximately 964,000 hospitalizations for osteoarthritis in 2011, a rate of 31 stays per 10,000 population. With an aggregate cost of $14.8 billion ($15,400 per stay), it was the second-most expensive condition seen in US hospital stays in 2011. By payer, it was the second-most costly condition billed to Medicare and private insurance.

=== Europe ===
In Europe, the number of individuals affected by osteoarthritis has increased from 27.9 million in 1990 to 50.8 million in 2019. Hand osteoarthritis was the second most prevalent type, affecting an estimated 12.5 million people. In 2019, Knee osteoarthritis was the 18th most common cause of years lived with disability (YLDs) in Europe, accounting for 1.28% of all YLDs. This has increased from 1.12% in 1990.

=== India ===
In India, the number of individuals affected by osteoarthritis has increased from 23.46 million in 1990 to 62.35 million in 2019. Knee osteoarthritis was the most prevalent type of osteoarthritis, followed by hand osteoarthritis. In 2019, osteoarthritis was the 20th most common cause of years lived with disability (YLDs) in India, accounting for 1.48% of all YLDs, which increased from 1.25% and 23rd most common cause in 1990.

==History==

===Etymology===
Osteoarthritis is derived from the prefix &quot;&quot; (from ) combined with &quot;arthritis&quot; (from , , ), which is itself derived from &quot;&quot; (from , , ) and &quot;&quot; (from , , ), the latter suffix having come to be associated with inflammation. The &quot;-itis&quot; of osteoarthritis could be considered misleading as inflammation is not a conspicuous feature. Some clinicians refer to this condition as &quot;osteoarthrosis&quot; to signify the lack of inflammatory response, the suffix &quot;&quot; (from , , ) simply referring to the pathosis itself.

==Other animals==

Osteoarthritis has been reported in several species of animals all over the world, including marine animals and even some fossils; including but not limited to: cats, many rodents, cattle, deer, rabbits, sheep, camels, elephants, buffalo, hyena, lions, mules, pigs, tigers, kangaroos, dolphins, dugong, and horses.

Osteoarthritis has been reported in fossils of the large carnivorous dinosaur &quot;Allosaurus fragilis&quot;.

==Research==
===Therapies===
Pharmaceutical agents that will alter the natural history of disease progression by arresting joint structural change and ameliorating symptoms are termed as disease modifying therapy. Therapies under investigation include the following:
* Strontium ranelate – may decrease degeneration in osteoarthritis and improve outcomes
* Gene therapy – Gene transfer strategies aim to target the disease process rather than the symptoms. Cell-mediated gene therapy is also being studied. One version was approved in South Korea for the treatment of moderate knee osteoarthritis, but later revoked for the mislabeling and the false reporting of an ingredient used. The drug was administered intra-articularly.

===Cause===
As well as attempting to find disease-modifying agents for osteoarthritis, there is emerging evidence that a system-based approach is necessary to find the causes of osteoarthritis. A study conducted by scientists at the University of Twente found that osmolarity induced intracellular molecular crowding might drive the disease pathology.

===Diagnostic biomarkers===
Guidelines outlining requirements for inclusion of soluble biomarkers in osteoarthritis clinical trials were published in 2015, but there are no validated biomarkers used clinically to detect osteoarthritis, as of 2021.

A 2015 systematic review of biomarkers for osteoarthritis looking for molecules that could be used for risk assessments found 37 different biochemical markers of bone and cartilage turnover in 25 publications. The strongest evidence was for urinary C-terminal telopeptide of type II collagen (uCTX-II) as a prognostic marker for knee osteoarthritis progression, and serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) levels as a prognostic marker for incidence of both knee and hip osteoarthritis. A review of biomarkers in hip osteoarthritis also found associations with uCTX-II. Procollagen type II C-terminal propeptide (PIICP) levels reflect type II collagen synthesis in body and within joint fluid PIICP levels can be used as a prognostic marker for early osteoarthritis.

<text>Monkey kung fu or Hóu Quán (猴拳, &quot;monkey fist&quot;) is a Chinese martial art which utilizes ape or monkey-like movements as part of its technique.

Northern Chinese martial arts such as Northern Praying Mantis and Wuzuquan incorporate some of the techniques from monkey kung fu.

==Origins==

It first originated from the Southern Shaolin Temple as Hou Quan (猴拳), monkey kung fu, or way of the mythical Sasquatch, as well as the better-known Dà Shèng Pī Guà Mén (大聖劈掛門) style. There are a number of independently developed systems of monkey kung fu. Some are integrated in Five Animal Kung Fu, Ng Ying Kung Fu systems. On its own standing examples include Xíng-Zhě-Mén (行者門) named after the protagonist Sun Wukong of the popular Ming dynasty novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, and Nán-Hóu-Quán (南猴拳) or Southern Monkey Fist.

===Hou Quan===
The Hou Quan style from the Emei region, taught by the famous &quot;Monkey King&quot; Xiao Yingpeng and others, was also used as the basis for the modern wushu variant of monkey style (and monkey staff) that is often seen in demonstrations and competitions today. Each independent style has its own unique approach to the expression of how to incorporate a monkey&#x27;s movements into fighting.

===Da Sheng Men===
Da Sheng Men, or &quot;Great Sage&quot; Kung Fu, was developed near the end of the Qing dynasty (1911) by a fighter named Kou Si (Kau Sei) from a small village in Northern China. Legend states that while serving a sentence in prison, he observed a group of monkeys from his cell. As he studied their movements and mannerisms, he found that they combined well with his own Di Tang style. While exact circumstances of Kou Si&#x27;s inspiration remain legend, upon his release he developed his new style of fighting and dubbed it &#x27;Da Sheng Men&#x27; (Great Sage Style) in honor of the Monkey King Sun Wukong in the Buddhist tale &quot;Journey to the West&quot;.

===Da Sheng Pi Gua===
Da Sheng Pi Gua Kung Fu 大聖劈掛門 (also known as Tai Sing Pek Kwar) was developed by Kou Si&#x27;s(寇四) student Geng De Hai (耿德海) who started learning Pi Gua kung fu from his father Kan Wing Kwai(耿榮貴) from as early as 8 years of age. Gan Wing Gwai was a master of Pi Gua kung fu and after his death, Kou Si decided to train Geng De Hai in Da Sheng Kung Fu. After mastering Da Sheng Kung Fu and combining it with Pi Gua Kung Fu, out of respect for Kou Si&#x27;s friendship, i.e. attacks are aimed at the knees, groin area, throat or eyes of the opponent and hand strikes are normally either open handed slaps or clawing with a semi-closed fist called the monkey claw. A wide array of facial monkey expressions are also practiced, inclusive of happiness, anger, fear, fright, confusion and bewilderment etc. Except for very brief periods, most movements inclusive of running are executed from either a squatting or semi-squatting position and are normally accompanied by very swift and &#x27;jerky&#x27; head movements as the practitioner nervously looks around. The monkey staff, or hou gun (猴棍), is one of this style&#x27;s specialty weapons. Monkey boxing is an imitative technique and so execution of the movements and facial expressions must be so convincing that it looks exactly like a monkey and not simply like a human imitating a monkey hence the very high degree of difficulty associated with this technique.

===Tai Shing===
There are five variations of monkey kung fu developed an naming the new technique Geng De Hai placed Da Sheng at the beginning followed by Pi Gua hence the name Da Sheng Pi Gua Kung Fu.

==Techniques==

===Hou Quan===
Traditional hou quan as taught in Mainland China includes running on all fours (i.e. the hands and feet), various difficult acrobatic movements such as flipping sideways in the air, front flips, back flips, back handsprings, hand stands, walking on the hands, forward lunges/dives, backward lunges, spinning on the butt, spinning on the back and many kicks and strikes. Most of this part of the Tai Shing system:

# Drunken Monkey focuses on throat, eye, and groin strikes, as well as tumbling and falling techniques. It incorporates false steps to affect defenselessness and off-balance strikes. The practitioner waddles, takes very faltering steps, and sometimes falls to the ground and lies prone while waiting for the opponent to approach, at which time a devastating attack is launched at the knees or groin. Drunken monkey uses more internal energy than any other variations, and is one of the more difficult monkey styles to master, but also extremely effective against a standard, attack-oriented enemy. Countering this style involves shifting body position often to ensure that the Drunken Monkey user&#x27;s techniques strike more solid, tougher areas of the body.
# Stone Monkey is a more physically focused style. The practitioner trains up his body to exchange blows with the opponent - a kind of iron body method. A practitioner often leaves an area exposed, inviting an opponent to attack, then attacks a more vital spot on their body. It is important not to attack reflexively at open spots, and try to hammer away 
# Standing Monkey or Tall Monkey is a relatively conventional monkey variation that maintains an upright position. This style is better suited for tall people. Tall monkey likes to climb body limbs to make attacks at pressure points. It is a long range style.
# Wooden Monkey mimics a serious, angry monkey that attacks and defends with ferocity. This variation is more serious, and its movements are noticeably less light than the other monkeys. Wood monkey involves grappling opponents to the ground at their weak spots until they give in.
# Lost Monkey heavily incorporates feints. Practitioners of Lost Monkey give the appearance of being lost and confused to deceive their opponents into underestimating their abilities, then retaliate when it is least expected. The hands and footwork change and flow from each other at will. Monkeys are sociable animals that live in troupes or family groups, but are also very territorial by nature. So when they wander into the territory of another troupe, there is normally a fight, which could possibly result in the death of the trespassers. This technique incorporates the fear, nervousness and mischief of a monkey who has wandered into a neighboring territory, in that it attempts to pick and eat as many fruits and insects as quickly as possible, while nervously looking around before scurrying back to its own home range.

==Movies and television programs==
The following films and television programs showcase Monkey Kung Fu either throughout the movie or in major scenes:
*&quot;Hou quan kou si&quot;, English title &quot;Monkey&#x27;s Fist&quot; (1974), features real-life Monkey Kung Fu specialist Chan Sau Chung.
*&quot;Tie ma liu&quot;, English title &quot;Iron Monkey&quot; (1977), starring Chen Kuan Tai.
* In the movie Knockabout, (1979) the lead protagonist Yipao used monkey fist technique (which he learned from a cop pretending to be a beggar) against The Fox, which happens to be his former master and the one who killed his friend Taipao.
* &quot;Feng hou&quot;, English title &quot;Mad Monkey Kung-Fu&quot; (1979), although the technique displayed in this movie is really the &#x27;monkey&#x27; variation of the Lau Family Hung Gar system and not genuine Da Sheng Pi Gua Kung Fu.
*&quot;Chu long ma liu&quot;, English title &quot;Monkey Fist Floating Snake&quot; (1979), starring Simon Chan.
*&quot;Zui hou nu&quot;, English title &quot;Lady Iron Monkey&quot; (1979), starring Fung Ling Kam.
* &quot;Liu he qian shou&quot;, English title &quot;Return of the Scorpion&quot;, (1979) features 7 Kung Fu masters, one (i.e. Chan Sau Chung) is a practitioner of Monkey Kung Fu. In the first fight scene, Chan Sau Chung does a few movements of the Drunken Monkey technique in that he take a few faltering steps (i.e. Monkey Staggering Steps) then he lies prone and waits for his opponent to approach at which time he does a massive wheel kick and immediately launches an attack at his opponents groin (i.e. angry monkey steals the peaches).
*The English dub of Jackie Chan&#x27;s &quot;Drunken Master II&quot; (1994) (AKA &quot;The Legend of Drunken Master&quot; (2000) (U.S.)) incorrectly references the Drunken Monkey style whenever Wong Fei-hung is about to perform some acrobatic kicks. The original dialogue actually references the immortals Li Tieguai and Zhang Gualao of the Daoist style of Drunken Fist. The former is a cripple with a powerful right leg and the latter is known for his swift double-kicks. All eight immortals are also referenced in the original &quot;Drunken Master&quot; (1978).
* &quot;Chui ma lau&quot;, English title &quot;Drunken Monkey&quot; (2002), uses the Monkey fist variant Drunken Monkey, although the technique displayed in this movie is really the &#x27;monkey&#x27; variation of the Lau Family Hung Gar system and not genuine Tai Shing Pak Kwar Kung Fu.
* In the Disney cartoon &quot;Kim Possible&quot;, Kim&#x27;s sidekick, Ron Stoppable, is imbued with the abilities of a Monkey Kung Fu master by four ancient statues. Also in the show, the character Lord Monty Fiske is a known practitioner of Da Sheng Pi Gua. He was so obsessed with the martial arts style that he mutated his hands and feet to resemble those of monkeys and then adopted the name &quot;Monkey Fist&quot;.
* In the film &quot;Extreme Fighter,&quot; Monkey Kung Fu master Michael Matsuda co-stars in the role of the &quot;monkey man.&quot;
* In the film &quot;Bloodsport&quot; a Monkey Kung Fu user participates in an underground fighting tournament.
* In &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;, Ray Park can be seen using an adapted form of Monkey Kung Fu as Sith Lord Darth Maul.
* Eileen from the video game &quot;Virtua Fighter series&quot; uses &quot;Kou-Ken&quot; known as Monkey Kung Fu.
* In the Mortal Kombat series, the ninja wraith character Noob Saibot fights with Monkey Kung Fu.
* In &quot;Kung Fu Panda&quot; there was a monkey master, also named Monkey, that attacked obviously with the monkey style of kung fu. He was voiced by Jackie Chan in the film, and James Sie in the accompanying television series, &quot;Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness&quot;.
* In the movie &quot;The Quest&quot;, the representative from China uses an obvious monkey style for his second match.
* In the movie &quot;Ip Man 2&quot;, Master Law (&quot;Lo Mang&quot;) is the first master that Ip Man fights on the tabletop, and is a master of Monkey-Style Kung Fu.

<doc id="504843" wikidata="Q3175659" url="?curid=504843" title="Sanda Island">
<text>Sanda Island () is a small island in the Firth of Clyde, off of Argyll and Bute, Scotland, near the southern tip of the Kintyre peninsula, near Southend and Dunaverty Castle.

On clear days Sanda can be seen from the southern tip of the Kintyre peninsula, from the Isle of Arran and from northeast County Antrim. It is known locally on Arran and on the Antrim coast as &quot;Spoon Island&quot; because of its resemblance to an upturned spoon.

==Population==
In the 2001 census Sanda was one of four Scottish islands with a population of just one person. However, since then there has been some development, and in 2008 the island had a population of 3. In August 2008, as a result of their separation, the husband and wife owners put the island up for sale at a price of £3.2 million, and in January 2009 they announced that a sole caretaker would be resident until spring viewings re-commenced. The island was eventually sold to Swiss businessman Michi Meier for the reduced price of £2.5 million. The island&#x27;s growth as a tourist destination may come to an end under the new owner, who has stated that he wants the island for personal use. By the time of the 2011 census, it had no usual residents.

==Wildlife==

The island is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest for its importance for both migrating and breeding birds.
Sanda Bird Observatory was the first bird observatory to be set up on the west coast of Scotland.

==Geography and geology==
According to Haswell-Smith, the island&#x27;s geology is &quot;lower old red sandstone in red and yellow varieties, and undifferentiated schists.&quot;

Sanda lies in the Straits of Moyle () between Scotland and Ireland. It is part of a mini-archipelago to the southeast of the Mull of Kintyre, at the far end of the Firth of Clyde. The other islands are Glunimore and Sheep Island, to the north east. Located on the north shore of Sanda is the &quot;Oitir Buidhe&quot; (yellow sand spit), a pronounced area of sand exposed at low tide, that has two slipways. To the east there is also the notorious &quot;ship catcher&quot;, Paterson&#x27;s Reef.

The island has cliffs on most sides. There are caves on the west coast, and also a couple of natural arches, particularly near &quot;the Ship&quot; as the lighthouse is nicknamed. There are two main hills, in the north west and south east. In between them is a valley which has the double advantage of being sheltered from the prevailing winds and catching the heat of the sun.

==History==

The island has connections with several well-known historical personages, including the Bruce family, Wallace and Saint Ninian, the first evangeliser north of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall.

The island is known for the ruins of a chapel built by Saint Ninian, for its Celtic crosses and its reputed holy well. It is said that Ninian was buried here, and indeed, the island was in possession of the Priory of Whithorn in Galloway until the Reformation. It is said that Ninian&#x27;s grave was marked by an alder tree, and that whoever stepped on it would die.

It was known as &quot;Sandey&quot; (sandy island) by the Norse. This probably refers to the &quot;Oitir Buidhe&quot; which lies on the north shore of Sanda facing Sheep Island. Another name that appears to have attached itself to the island is &quot;Havoin&quot; (and numerous variants such as &quot;Aven&quot;, &quot;Avona&quot;), which was recorded amongst the &quot;Danish&quot; by Dean Monro in his 16th century &quot;Description of the Western Isles of Scotland&quot;. This is cognate with the English &quot;haven&quot;, and probably refers to the anchorage on the north coast, alternatively, but much less likely, as Haswell-Smith suggests, this could also be a reference to the Scottish Gaelic &quot;abhainn&quot; which means a river.

In the Middle Ages, there was some association with the Bruce family, notably, Robert the Bruce and his brother Edward. Edward lends his name to &quot;Prince Edward&#x27;s Rock&quot;, which is just south of Sanda Lighthouse, and which is nothing to do with Bonnie Prince Charlie, as sometimes thought. Robert was once forced to flee there, &quot;en route&quot; to Ireland after being pursued by the English navy. He has been sheltering with sympathisers at nearby Dunaverty Castle, on Kintyre in 1306, but was forced to leave. He later sheltered at Rathlin Island, which is less than away, and which is where he was said to have seen the legendary spider in the cave. In the south are &quot;Wallace&#x27;s Rocks&quot; which may be linked in legend to William Wallace.

In the later 16th and 17th centuries, the island was connected with the MacDonalds of Kintyre, who sided with Montrose Colkitto married a MacDonald of Sanda; those MacDonalds were also caught up in related fighting from the 1630s onwards, and lost their position as a result of the Dunaverty Massacre.

The island has had a number of different owners in its history, including, in 1969, Jack Bruce of the rock group Cream.

==Lighthouse==

At the southern tip of the island there is a lighthouse built in 1850 by Alan Stevenson. When seen from the sea to the south, the natural arch, and the lighthouse on the rock can look like a ship, hence its name &quot;The Ship&quot; on marine charts.

===Byron Darnton===
A pub was opened in 2003, named Byron Darnton after the vessel which wrecked on the island in 1946. The &quot;Byron Darnton&quot; was named after an American war correspondent whose son, John Darnton, also became a journalist and wrote of his visit to the island in 2005.

==Stamps==
Local stamps have been issued for Sanda since 1962. The stamps served the resident staff employed by the Northern Lighthouse Board, the owners and the many visitors to the island who wished to have their mail posted there, and carried to the nearest GPO post box on the mainland.

<text>Robert Erskine Childers (25 June 1870 – 24 November 1922), usually known as Erskine Childers (), was an English-born Irish nationalist who established himself as a writer with accounts of the Second Boer War, the novel &quot;The Riddle of the Sands&quot; about German preparations for a sea-borne invasion of England, and proposals for achieving Irish independence.

As a firm believer in the British Empire, Childers served as a volunteer in the army expeditionary force in the Second Boer War in South Africa, but his experiences there began a gradual process of disillusionment with British imperialism. He was adopted as a candidate in British parliamentary elections, standing for the Liberal Party at a time when the party supported a treaty to establish Irish home rule, but he later became an advocate of Irish republicanism and the severance of all ties with Britain. On behalf of the Irish Volunteers, he smuggled guns into Ireland later used against British soldiers in the Easter Rebellion. He had a significant role in the negotiations between Ireland and Britain that culminated in the Anglo-Irish Treaty, but was elected as an anti-Treaty member of the first Irish parliament. He sought an active role in the Irish Civil War (over the acceptance of the terms of the treaty) that followed and was executed by the Irish Free State.

As an author, his most significant work was the novel &quot;The Riddle of the Sands&quot;, published eleven years before the start of the First World War. Its depiction of a secret German invasion fleet directed against England influenced Winston Churchill, the First Lord of the Admiralty, into strengthening the Home Fleet of the Royal Navy. On the outbreak of the First World War Churchill was instrumental in calling Childers for service in the Royal Navy, for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.

Childers was the son of British Orientalist scholar Robert Caesar Childers, the father of the fourth president of Ireland Erskine Hamilton Childers, the cousin of British politician Hugh Childers and of Irish nationalist Robert Barton, and the grandfather of the writer and diplomat Erskine Barton Childers and of the former MEP Nessa Childers.

==Early life==
Childers was born in Mayfair, London, in 1870. He was the second son of Robert Caesar Childers, a translator and oriental scholar from an ecclesiastical family, and Anna Mary Henrietta Barton, from an Anglo-Irish landowning family of Glendalough House, Annamoe, County Wicklow, with interests in France such as the winery that bears their name. When Erskine was six, his father died from tuberculosis and his mother, although at that stage showing no signs of the disease, was confined to an isolation hospital to safeguard her children. She corresponded regularly with Childers until she died from tuberculosis, without having seen her children again, six years later. The five children were sent to the Bartons, the family of their mother&#x27;s uncle, at Glendalough. Well-treated by his new family, Childers grew up with a strong affection for, and knowledge of, Ireland, albeit, at that point in time, from the comfortable viewpoint of the &quot;Protestant Ascendancy&quot;. According to his biographer Michael Hopkinson, it was the personal tension caused by his innate belief in English superiority, in conflict with this new respect for Ireland, which later caused his remarkable conversion to &quot;hard-line Irish republicanism&quot;.

He was educated at home by tutors (with his brother Henry and cousin Robert Barton) until the age of ten, when he became a boarder at a preparatory school in England, returning to Glendalough for the holidays. At the recommendation of his grandfather, Canon Charles Childers, in 1883 he was sent to the Haileybury and Imperial Service College. His performance there was initially described as &quot;middling&quot; but he later won school prizes in Latin and in his final year he was made &quot;head of house&quot;. There he won an exhibition to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied the classical tripos and then law. He distinguished himself as the editor of &quot;Cambridge Review&quot;, the university magazine. Notwithstanding his unattractive voice and poor debating skills, he became president of the Trinity College Debating Society (known as the &quot;Magpie and Stump&quot;). Although Childers was an admirer of his cousin Hugh Childers, a member of the British Cabinet who had supported the first Irish home rule bill, he spoke vehemently against the policy in college debates, warning that &quot;[Irish] national aspirations were incompatible with our own safety.&quot;. A sciatic injury sustained while hillwalking in the summer before he went up, which persisted for the rest of his life, left him slightly lame and he was unable to pursue his intention of earning a rugby blue, but he became a proficient rower.

Having stayed an extra year at Cambridge to gain a further degree (in law) Childers briefly entered legal chambers in London as a pupil, the first stage in becoming a barrister. After four months, influenced by his cousin Hugh Childers, he resigned his pupillage and enrolled at a crammer to prepare for the competitive entry examination to become a parliamentary official. He was successful and, early in 1895, he became a junior committee clerk in the House of Commons, with responsibility for preparing formal and legally sound bills from the proposals of the government of the day.

==Sailing==
Childers and his brother Henry had kept a small sailboat on Lough Dan, near to Glendalough. From time to time while at Cambridge he had sailed on the Norfolk Broads. With many sporting ventures now closed to him because of his sciatic injury, Childers was encouraged by Walter Runciman, a friend from Trinity College, to take up sailing. After picking up the fundamentals of seamanship as a deckhand on Runciman&#x27;s yacht, in 1893 with his brother Henry he bought his own boat, the former racing yacht &quot;Shulah&quot;. This vessel required an experienced crew and was totally unsuitable for novices: they sold it in 1895. His next vessel was the &quot;scrubby little yacht&quot; &quot;Marguerite&quot;, an half-deck, which he kept at Greenhithe, close to London. After teaching himself navigation and taking lessons in sailboat handling, he undertook trips around the English coast and across the English Channel with his brother Henry. In April 1897 he replaced &quot;Marguerite&quot; with the larger and more comfortable cutter &quot;Vixen&quot;; in August that year there was a long cruise in &quot;Vixen&quot; to the Frisian Islands, Norderney and the Baltic with Henry and Ivor Lloyd Jones, a friend from Cambridge, as crew. These were the adventures he was to fictionalise in 1903 as &quot;The Riddle of the Sands&quot;, his most famous book and a huge bestseller.

In 1903 Childers was again cruising in the Frisian Islands, in &quot;Sunbeam&quot;, a boat he bought in syndicate with William le Fanu and other friends from his university days. He was now accompanied by his new wife Molly Osgood. Molly&#x27;s father, Dr. Hamilton Osgood, arranged for a fine 28-ton yacht, &quot;Asgard&quot;, to be built for the couple as a wedding gift and &quot;Sunbeam&quot; was only a temporary measure while &quot;Asgard&quot; was being fitted out.

&quot;Asgard&quot; was Childers&#x27;s last and most famous yacht: in July 1914, he used it to smuggle a cargo of 900 Mauser Model 1871 rifles and 29,000 black powder cartridges to the Irish Volunteers movement at the fishing village of Howth, County Dublin. The &quot;Asgard&quot; was acquired by the Irish government as a sail training vessel in 1961, stored on dry land in the yard of Kilmainham Gaol in 1979, and is now exhibited at The National Museum of Ireland.

==War service==

===Boer War===
As with most men of his social background and education, Childers was originally a steadfast believer in the British Empire. Indeed, for an old boy of Haileybury College, a school founded to train young men for colonial service in India, such an outlook on Childers&#x27;s part was almost inevitable, although, privately, he did not accept completely the &quot;conformist&quot; values of the school.

In 1898, as negotiations over the voting rights of British settlers in the Boer territories of Transvaal and Orange Free State failed and the Boer War broke out, Childers needed little encouragement when in December Basil Williams, a colleague at Westminster, suggested that he too should enlist. Williams was already a member of the Honourable Artillery Company (HAC), a volunteer regiment, so at the end of December 1898 Childers joined the HAC.

A battery from the HAC formed part of the hastily constituted City Imperial Volunteers, something of an &quot;ad hoc&quot; force set up from soldiers from different volunteer regiments, funded by City institutions and provided with the most modern equipment. Childers became a member of the artillery division of this new force, classed as a &quot;spare driver&quot; to care for horses and ride in the ammunition supply train. On 2 February 1900, after three weeks&#x27; training, the unit set off for South Africa. Most of the new volunteers and their officers were seasick and it largely fell to Childers to care for the troop&#x27;s 30 horses. After a three-week voyage, the company was disappointed not to see immediate action but on 26 June, while escorting a supply train of slow ox-wagons, Childers first came under fire during a three-day skirmish in defence of the column. It was a smartly executed defence of a beleaguered infantry regiment on 3 July that established the worth of his unit and more significant engagements followed.

On 24 August, Childers was evacuated from the front line to hospital in Pretoria, suffering from trench foot. The seven-day journey happened to be in the company of wounded infantrymen from Cork, Ireland, and Childers noted approvingly how cheerfully loyal to Britain the men were, how resistant they were to any incitement in support of Home Rule, and how they had been let down only by the incompetence of their officers. This is a striking contrast to his attitude by the end of the First World War when conscription in Ireland was under consideration and he wrote of &quot;young men hopelessly estranged from Britain and [...] anxious to die in Ireland for Irish liberty.&quot;. After a chance meeting with his brother Henry, also suffering from a foot injury, he rejoined his unit, only for it to be dispatched to England on 7 October 1900.

===First World War===
====Gun running to Ireland====
Childers&#x27;s attitude to Britain&#x27;s establishment and politics had become somewhat equivocal by the start of the First World War. He had resigned his membership of the Liberal Party, and with it his hopes of a parliamentary seat, over Britain&#x27;s concessions to Unionists and a further postponement of Irish self-rule; he had written works critical of British policy in Ireland and in its South African possessions; above all in the Summer of 1914 he had been a member of Mary Spring Rice committee planning to smuggle guns bought in Germany to supply the Irish Volunteers in the south of Ireland, a &quot;largely symbolic&quot; response to the April 1914 Ulster Volunteers&#x27; importation of rifles and ammunition in the Larne gun-running. Although in 1914 John Redmond, the leader of the Irish Volunteers, argued that in the case of war his movement would cooperate with the Ulster Volunteers in the defence of Ireland, thus allowing Britain to release troops from the country for the war in Europe, the committee&#x27;s weapons were used against British soldiers in the Easter Rising of 1916.
The members of the committee of eleven included, in addition to Spring Rice: Alice Stopford Green, Roger Casement, Darrell Figgis and Conor O&#x27;Brien. Monetary subscriptions were received from other influential figures. O&#x27;Brien owned a small yacht &quot;Kelpie&quot; but Childers considered that his own seagoing experience made him the natural choice to lead the operation. Mindful of the risk that the vessel used to carry the shipment could be confiscated, only when Spring Rice&#x27;s own boat proved unseaworthy did Childers offer &quot;Asgard&quot;. With no regard for security, Childers canvassed some acquaintances among British army officers to crew &quot;Asgard&quot; for the exploit, but only Gordon Shephard of the Royal Fusiliers accepted. Childers and Figgis arranged the weapons&#x27; purchase from Hamburg. The landing, with Molly Childers at the helm of &quot;Asgard&quot;, was on 26 July 1914 at Howth, openly conducted in broad daylight to offer the maximum publicity for the cause. The police and British Army&#x27;s attempt to intercept the cargo as it was transferred inland led to the Bachelor&#x27;s Walk massacre of 26 July 1914, when soldiers from the Kings Own Scottish Borderers fired upon uninvolved onlookers.

A week later, when war with Germany was declared, Childers was in Dublin, writing articles for American newspapers to exploit the success of the operation. The knowledge that Childers had made a delivery of rifles and ammunition to Irish nationalists was not in wide circulation, but neither was it a great secret, and the official telegram from the British Admiralty calling Childers to naval service was sent to the Dublin headquarters of the group to which he had made the delivery.

At that stage, Childers still believed that a self-governing Ireland would take its place as a dominion within the Empire and so he was easily able to reconcile himself to the belief that fighting for Britain in defence of nations under threat from Germany was the right thing to do. In mid-August 1914 he responded to the Admiralty telegram and volunteered for service. He received a temporary commission as lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. Winston Churchill, the First Lord of the Admiralty, although hostile to spending money on armaments at the time &quot;The Riddle of the Sands&quot; was published, later gave the book the credit for persuading public opinion to fund vital measures against the German naval threat, and he was instrumental in securing Childers&#x27;s recall.

====Naval service====
Childers&#x27;s first task was, in reversal of the plot of &quot;The Riddle of the Sands&quot;, to draw up a plan for the invasion of Germany by way of the Frisian Islands. He was then allocated to , a seaplane tender of the Harwich Force, as an instructor in coastal navigation to newly trained pilots. His duties included flying as a navigator and observer. A sortie navigating over a familiar coastline in the Cuxhaven Raid (an inconclusive bombing attack on the Cuxhaven airship base on Christmas Day 1914) earned him a mention in despatches. In 1915, he was transferred in a similar role to , in which he served in the Gallipoli Campaign and the eastern Mediterranean, earning himself a Distinguished Service Cross.

He was sent back to London in April 1916 to serve in the Admiralty where, because he understood the requirements of airmen, his work included the mundane task of allocating seaplanes to their intended ships. It took Childers until autumn of that year to extricate himself and train for service with a new coastal motor-boat squadron operating in the English Channel.

====Irish Convention====
In July 1917, the year following the Easter Rising, Horace Plunkett asked for Childers (then a lieutenant-commander in the RNAS serving at a seaplane station at Dunkirk), to be relieved of his operational duties and assigned as secretary to prime minister David Lloyd George&#x27;s Home Rule Convention. This was an initiative, suggested by Jan Smuts who had used the tactic successfully at the culmination of the Boer War, to convene within Ireland all shades of Irish political opinion to agree a method of government. Plunkett did not have his way, however, as Childers&#x27;s writings had identified him as a partisan for Home Rule; instead he was appointed as an assistant secretary, with the role of advising the nationalist factions on procedure and presenting their case in formal terms. Talks lasted nine months and at the end Plunkett was obliged to pass on his conclusions that no agreement could be reached: the issues of devolved fiscal powers for the new government, and guarantees to Unionists of the right to nominate a percentage of members of parliament, forcing deadlock. Lloyd George, who was facing the consequences of a German breakout from the trenches in France (&quot;the gravest military crisis of the war&quot;), took no action.

====Royal Air Force====
On his return to London in April 1918, Childers found himself transferred into the newly created Royal Air Force, with the rank of major. He was attached to the new Independent Bomber Command as a group intelligence officer, having the responsibility of preparing the navigational briefings for attacks on Berlin. The raids were forestalled by the Armistice and Childers&#x27;s last assignment was to provide an intelligence assessment of the effects of bombing raids in Belgium. He departed Royal Air Force service on 10 March 1919.

==Marriage==

In autumn 1903, Childers travelled to the United States as part of a reciprocal visit between the Honourable Artillery Company of London and the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts of Boston. Childers had with him a letter of introduction to Dr. Hamilton Osgood, an eminent and wealthy physician in the city, that had been provided by Boston banker Sumner Permain, a friend of Childers&#x27;s father. Childers was invited to dinner at Osgood&#x27;s house and there he met Mary Alden Osgood (known as &quot;Molly&quot;), the host&#x27;s daughter. The well-read republican-minded heiress and Childers found each other congenial company and Childers elected to extend his stay, with much time shared with Molly. The pair were married at Boston&#x27;s Trinity Church on 6 January 1904. Cousin Robert Barton travelled to Boston to be best man.

Childers returned to London with his wife and resumed his position in the House of Commons. His reputation as an influential author gave the couple access to the political establishment, which Molly relished, but at the same time she set to work to rid Childers of his already faltering imperialism. In her turn Molly developed a strong admiration for Britain, its institutions and, as she then saw it, its willingness to go to war in the interests of smaller nations against the great. Over the next seven years they lived comfortably in their rented flat in Chelsea, supported by Childers&#x27;s salary—he had received promotion to the position of parliamentary Clerk of Petitions in 1903—his continuing writings and, not least, generous benefactions from Dr. Osgood.

Molly, despite a severe weakness in the legs following a childhood skating injury, took enthusiastically to sailing, first in &quot;Sunbeam&quot; and later on many voyages in her father&#x27;s gift, &quot;Asgard&quot;. Childers&#x27;s letters to his wife show the couple&#x27;s contentment during this time. Three sons were born: Erskine in December 1905, Henry, who died before his first birthday, in February 1907, and Robert Alden in December 1910.

==Writing==
Childers&#x27;s first published work was some light detective stories he contributed to &quot;The Cambridge Review&quot; while he was editor.

===&quot;In the Ranks of the C.I.V.&quot;===
His first book was &quot;In the Ranks of the C.I.V.&quot;, an account of his experiences in the Boer War, but he wrote it without any thought of publication: while serving with the Honourable Artillery Company in South Africa he composed many long, descriptive letters about his experiences to his two sisters, Dulcibella and Constance. They and a family friend, Elizabeth Thompson, daughter of George Smith of the publishing house Smith, Elder, edited the letters into book form. The print proofs were waiting for Childers to approve on his return from the war in October 1900 and Smith, Elder published the work in November. It was well-timed to catch the public&#x27;s interest in the war, which continued until May 1902, and it sold in substantial numbers.

Childers edited his colleague Basil Williams&#x27;s more formal book, &quot;The HAC in South Africa&quot;, the official history of the regiment&#x27;s part in the campaign, for publication in 1903.

Childers&#x27;s neighbour, Leo Amery, was editor of &quot;The Times&quot; &quot;History of the War in South Africa&quot;, and having already persuaded Basil Williams to write volume four of the work, he used this to persuade Childers to prepare volume five. This profitable commission took up much of Childers&#x27;s free time until publication in 1907. It drew attention to British political and military errors and made unfavourable contrast with the tactics of the Boer guerrillas.

===&quot;The Riddle of the Sands&quot;===
In January 1901, Childers started work on his novel, &quot;The Riddle of the Sands&quot;, but initially progress was slow; it was not until winter of that year that he was able to tell Williams, in one of his regular letters, of the outline of the plot. At the end of the following year, after a hard summer of writing, the manuscript went to Reginald Smith at Smith Elder. But in February 1903, just as Childers was hoping to return to editing &quot;The HAC in South Africa&quot;, Smith sent back the novel, with instructions for extensive changes. With the help of his sisters, who cross-checked the new manuscript pages against the existing material, Childers produced the final version in time for publication in May 1903. Based on his own sailing trips with his brother Henry along the German coast, it predicted war with Germany and called for British preparedness. There has been much speculation about which of Childers&#x27;s friends was the model for &quot;Carruthers&quot; in the novel: he is based not on Henry Childers but on the author&#x27;s long-term friend the yachting enthusiast Walter Runciman. &quot;Davies&quot;, of course, is Childers himself. Widely popular, the book has never gone out of print. &quot;The Observer&quot; included the book on its list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Novels of All Time&quot;. The &quot;Telegraph&quot; listed it as the third best spy novel of all time. It has been called the first spy novel (a claim challenged by advocates of Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Kim&quot;, published two years earlier), and enjoyed immense popularity in the years before World War I. It was an extremely influential book: Winston Churchill later credited it as a major reason that the Admiralty decided to establish naval bases at Invergordon, Rosyth on the Firth of Forth and Scapa Flow in Orkney. It was also a notable influence on authors such as John Buchan and Eric Ambler.

===&quot;Cavalry controversy&quot;===
Motivated by his expectation of war with Germany, Childers wrote two books on cavalry warfare, both strongly critical of what he saw as outmoded British tactics. Everyone agreed that cavalry should be trained to fight dismounted with firearms, but military traditionalists wanted cavalry still to be trained as the arme blanche, bringing shock tactics to bear by charging the enemy with lance and sabre. Training in the traditional, mounted tactics had been reestablished after the modernising reformer Field Marshal Roberts retired in 1904, when General Sir John French, who had commanded successful cavalry charges at the Battle of Elandslaagte and the relief of Kimberley, was promoted to the senior levels of the army. Childers&#x27;s &quot;War and the Arme Blanche&quot; (1910) carried a foreword from Roberts, and recommended that cavalry, instead of charging the enemy positions, should &quot;make genuinely destructive assaults upon riflemen and guns&quot; by firing from the saddle. French, among the traditionalists, responded in defence of the old tactics in his preface (in an unlikely alliance) to Prussian general Friedrich von Bernhardi&#x27;s &quot;Cavalry in War and Peace&quot; (1910). This allowed Childers to counter with &quot;German Influence on British Cavalry&quot; (1911), an &quot;intolerant&quot; rejoinder to the criticisms of his book made by French and Bernhardi.

===&quot;The Framework of Home Rule&quot;===
It was as a prospective Liberal Party candidate for Parliament that Childers wrote his last major book: &quot;The Framework of Home Rule&quot; (1911). Childers&#x27;s principal argument was an economic one: that an Irish parliament (there would be no Westminster MPs) would be responsible for making fiscal policy for the benefit of the country, and would hold &quot;dominion&quot; status, in the same detached way in which Canada managed its affairs. His arguments were based in part on the findings of the Childers Commission of the 1890s, which was chaired by his cousin, Hugh Childers. Erskine Childers consulted Ulster Unionists in preparing &quot;Framework&quot; and wrote that their reluctance to accept the policy would easily be overcome. Although it represented a major change from the opinions Childers had previously held, enacting Irish Home Rule was the Liberal government&#x27;s policy at the time.

An emerging problem was that the book assumed fiscal independence and self-government for the whole island of Ireland, including the wealthier and more industrialised counties around Belfast. During his research Childers naïvely came to believe that the opposition of the unionists in the region was mainly bluff, or that the industrialists&#x27; entrepreneurial spirit would easily overcome any monetary disadvantages they might initially suffer. In this he was wrong: this disparity (together with the largely Protestant unionists&#x27; fear of Catholic &quot;rule from Rome&quot;) was a significant contributor to the failure of the 1917 Home Rule Convention and, ultimately, to the Partition of Ireland of 1921.

Reception for the work, in both England and Ireland, was positive, although the &quot;Belfast Newsletter&quot; warned that the pretensions and influence of the Catholic church would endanger acceptance of any such proposals. The &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; took issue with Childers&#x27;s optimistic comparisons with other British overseas territories, warning that the manner of colonial rule over indigenous populations, effective in distant parts of the empire, would be impossible to implement in Ireland. This point was taken up by several other reviewers as an indication of a tendency in Childers towards white supremacy. For example: Robert Lynd of the &quot;Daily News&quot; wrote that Childers was drawing on the argument that &quot;the essential Irish character[…]is the same as the character of other white races,&quot; and the &quot;Glasgow Herald&quot; wondered why Childers would confine the benefits of freedom only to the &quot;white races&quot;.

==Conversion==
There was no single incident which was responsible for Childers&#x27;s conversion from supporter of the British Empire to his leading role in the Irish revolution. In his own words, delivered on 8 June 1922 while a Teachta Dála (Deputy) at the Dáil Éireann, replying to a motion of censure: &quot;[...] by a process of moral and intellectual conviction I came away from Unionism into Nationalism and finally into Republicanism. That is a simple story.&quot; There was a growing conviction, later turning to &quot;fanatical obsession&quot; (as his critics and friends both would suggest) that the island of Ireland should have its own government.

An early source of disillusionment with Britain&#x27;s imperial policy was his view that, given more patient and skilful negotiation, the Boer War could have been avoided. His friend and biographer Basil Williams noticed his growing doubts about Britain&#x27;s actions in South Africa while they were on campaign together: &quot;Both of us, who came out as hide-bound Tories, began to tend towards more liberal ideas, partly from the [...] democratic company we were keeping, but chiefly, I think, from our discussions on politics and life generally.&quot; Molly Childers, brought up in a family that traced its roots to the &quot;Mayflower&quot;, also influenced her husband&#x27;s outlook on the right of Britain to rule other countries.

The ground was well prepared, then, when in the summer of 1908 he and his cousin Robert Barton took a holiday motor tour inspecting Horace Plunkett&#x27;s agricultural co-operatives in the south and west of Ireland—areas ravaged with poverty. &quot;I have come back&quot;, he wrote to Basil Williams, &quot;finally and immutably a convert to Home Rule ... though we both grew up steeped in the most irreconcilable sort of Unionism.&quot;

In the autumn of 1910 Childers resigned his post as Clerk of Petitions to leave himself free to join the Liberal Party, with its declared commitment to Home Rule: the Liberal Party relied on Irish Home Rule MPs for its Commons majority. In a lecture delivered in Dublin in March 1912, Childers described the benefits to Ireland, and opportunities for nationalists, from the Liberal party&#x27;s proposed new home rule bill (placed before the UK parliament on 11 April 1912). Childers&#x27;s narrative explaining the Liberal&#x27;s proposals was well received, but he noted that his audience reacted &quot;coldly&quot; to any suggestion that, post-independence, Ireland could participate in the future of the Empire.

Childers secured for himself the candidature in one of the parliamentary seats in the naval town of Devonport. As the well-known writer of &quot;The Riddle of the Sands&quot;, with its implied support for an expanded Royal Navy, Childers could hardly fail to win the vote whenever the next election was called. But in response to threats of civil war from the Ulster Unionists, the party began to entertain the idea of removing some or all of Ulster from a self-governed Ireland. Childers abandoned his candidacy and left the party.

The Liberals&#x27; Home Rule Bill, introduced in 1912, would eventually pass into law in 1914, but was immediately—by a separate Act of Parliament—shelved for the duration of the Great War, which had just begun. The Amending Bill to exclude six of the nine counties of Ulster for an indeterminate period was eliminated altogether. On Easter Monday of 1916 the Irish Volunteers (who had taken possession of the rifles Childers had delivered at Howth in 1914) mounted a violent uprising (the &quot;Easter Rising&quot;) in protest at the delay. Its harsh suppression using artillery, and the ruthless prosecution of the captured ringleaders, dismayed Childers and he did not regret that the rifles from the Howth landing had been used against British soldiers.

==Home Rule==
In the United Kingdom General Election of November 1918 Sinn Féin secured 73 of the 105 Irish seats. The party&#x27;s policy was to refuse to take up their places in the Westminster parliament and in January 1919 they set up their own assembly, the Dáil Éireann, in Dublin. In March 1919 Childers presented himself at the Dublin office of Sinn Féin and offered his services. Robert Brennan introduced Childers to Arthur Griffith, the founder of Sinn Féin who said of Childers at that time: &quot;He&#x27;s a good man to have. He has the ear of a big section of the English people&quot;. Desmond FitzGerald, responsible for Sinn Féin publicity, recognised that an English author with a wide following would be useful and he suggested that Childers should assist him. FitzGerald and Robert Barton arranged for Childers to be introduced to the Irish military leader Michael Collins, who in turn introduced him to Éamon de Valera, the President of Sinn Féin. After recuperating from a severe attack of influenza at Glendalough, Childers returned to London, where he could more effectively lobby on behalf of Sinn Féin. He rejoined Molly at their Chelsea flat, while also renting a house in Dublin. Molly was reluctant to remove to Dublin: she was mindful of her sons&#x27; education at English schools and she believed that she and her husband could best serve the Nationalist cause by influencing opinion in London. She eventually gave up their London home of fifteen years to settle in Dublin at the end of 1919.

A month after returning to London, Childers received an invitation to meet the Sinn Féin leaders in Dublin. Anticipating an offer of a major role, Childers hurried to return but, apart from Collins, he found the leadership wary, or even hostile. Arthur Griffith, in particular, considered him as at best a renegade and traitor to Britain, or at worst as a British spy. He was appointed to join the Irish delegation from the as-yet-unrecognised Irish state to the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. His unpromising role, as Childers saw it, was to advance the cause of Irish self-determination by reminding delegates of the ideals of freedom over which Britain had gone to war. The initiative proved unavailing, and he returned once again to London.

In 1920 he published &quot;Military Rule in Ireland&quot;, a pamphlet made up of eight articles from the left-wing London &quot;Daily News&quot; appearing between March and May 1920, each a strong attack on British army operations in Ireland. At the 1921 elections, he was elected (unopposed) to the Second Dáil as Sinn Féin member for the Kildare–Wicklow constituency, and published the pamphlet &quot;Is Ireland a Danger to England? The strategic question examined&quot;, rebutting British prime minister Lloyd George&#x27;s claim that an independent Ireland risked Britain&#x27;s security.

In February 1921 Childers became editor of the &quot;Irish Bulletin&quot; and Director of Publicity for the Dáil after the arrest of Desmond FitzGerald. He stood as a Sinn Féin (anti-treaty) candidate at the 1922 general election but lost his seat.

==Irish War of Independence==
From 1919 the Irish Republican Army (IRA), notionally under the command of Irish defence minister Cathal Brugha, regarded itself as a legitimate force answerable to the Dáil Éireann. It began a series of attacks on British institutions in Ireland. The &quot;Irish War of Independence&quot;, as the series of IRA strikes (and British reprisals, such as those by the &quot;Black and Tans&quot;) became known, lasted until July 1921, when Éamon de Valera and British prime minister David Lloyd George agreed a truce. Childers had exercised more influence on the British change of heart than he knew: his reporting in the United States had strengthened sympathy for the Nationalist cause and in turn the US government applied pressure on the British administration.

==Treaty negotiations==

On 12 July 1921 de Valera and a small group, including Childers as secretary, travelled to London for discussions with Lloyd George. De Valera submitted Lloyd George&#x27;s proposals to the Dáil and the outcome was an Irish delegation sent to London on 7 October 1921 for formal talks to negotiate the terms of a treaty. De Valera did not go but he insisted against strong opposition that Childers, in whom he had particular faith, should remain secretary. Protracted negotiations continued until agreement was reached on 5 December 1921.

Childers was vehemently opposed to the final draft of the agreement, even when the clauses that required Irish leaders to take the Oath of Allegiance to the British monarch had been redefined to remove any real authority of the Crown in Ireland. As secretary to the delegation (rather than a full delegate) his determined resistance to the terms offered by the British was overruled, notwithstanding his attempts &quot;forever trying to manipulate the Irish delegates into uncompromising positions&quot;. At the termination of the talks, Lloyd George noted a &quot;sullen&quot; Childers, disappointed that his &quot;tenacious [and] sinister&quot; attempts to wreck the negotiations had failed. Historian Frank Pakenham was less critical: many of the British concessions that had permitted the Irish delegation eventually to sign the document had been introduced at Childers&#x27;s instigation.

The Anglo-Irish treaty agreement was presented to the Dáil and debated between December 1921 and January 1922. Childers denounced it, declaring that by accepting compromise Ireland had of its own volition relinquished its independence. Arthur Griffith, a member of the delegation who had pragmatically conceded to Britain over the Oath of Allegiance, alleged that Childers was a secret agent of Britain now working to wreck the agreement and destabilise the new state. The Dáil voted to adopt the terms by the narrow majority of 64 to 57.

==Onset of civil war==
The treaty with Britain broadened the division between Sinn Féin and the &quot;Irregulars&quot; a breakaway anti-treaty faction of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) led by Cathal Brugha. Ireland descended into civil war on 28 June 1922, when government forces, using borrowed British artillery, bombarded the Four Courts, once Ireland&#x27;s judicial centre but now used as the military headquarters of the IRA.

==Fugitive==

During the civil war Childers was on the run with the anti-treaty forces in County Cork and County Kerry. The author Frank O&#x27;Connor was involved with Childers during the later part of the Civil War and gave a colourful picture of Childers&#x27;s activities. According to O&#x27;Connor, Childers was ostracised from the anti-treaty forces and referred to as &quot;that bloody Englishman&quot;, with untrained military officers, newly created from &quot;country boys&quot;, ignoring Childers&#x27;s considerable experience as a professional soldier. The high command of the anti-treaty forces, too, distanced themselves from Childers. His lowly rank was &quot;Staff Captain, Southern Command, IRA&quot;.
Although the headquarters of the rebel army was at Macroom, County Cork only for a short time, while there Childers was able to produce southern editions of &quot;An Phoblacht&quot; which, as it was produced in the &quot;war zone&quot;, he called &quot;Republican War News&quot;. His clandestine printing press was moved between safe houses by pony and trap.

Childers&#x27;s reporting of the skirmishes allowed Kevin O&#x27;Higgins, the provisional government&#x27;s justice minister, to declare that Childers was in fact the leader of the rebels, and indeed nothing less than the instigator of the civil war itself, through his resistance to compromise with England. Frank O&#x27;Connor saw that the government&#x27;s intention was to &quot;prepare the way for [Childers&#x27;s] execution&quot;. The death in an ambush of Michael Collins intensified the desire of Free State authorities for retribution, and on 28 September 1922, the Dáil introduced the Army Emergency Powers Resolution, establishing martial law powers and listing carrying firearms without a licence a capital offence.

Early in November 1922, after his printing press had fallen down a hillside and become lost in a bog, Childers decided that the cause would be better served if he were at de Valera&#x27;s side as he attempted to rally the anti-treaty forces. Accordingly he set off by bicycle (in company with David Robinson, also on the run) on the journey from Cork to his old home at Glendalough, as a staging post before meeting De Valera in Dublin. On 10 November Free State forces, possibly informed by an estate worker, burst into the house and arrested him. Robinson had hidden himself in a cellar and was not captured. Upon hearing of Childers&#x27;s capture Winston Churchill expressed his satisfaction, referring to Childers as &quot;the mischief-making, murderous renegade&quot;. Years later, Churchill&#x27;s opinion of Childers seems to have softened referring to him as a &quot;man of distinction, ability and courage[...]who had shown daring and ardour against the Germans in the Cuxhaven raid on New Year&#x27;s Day 1915[...].&quot;

==Trial and appeal==

Childers was put on trial by a military court on the charge of possessing a small Spanish-made &quot;Destroyer&quot; .32 calibre semi-automatic pistol on his person in violation of the Emergency Powers Resolution. The gun had been a gift from Michael Collins before Collins became head of the pro-treaty Provisional Government. Childers was convicted by the military court and sentenced to death on 20 November 1922.

Childers appealed against the sentence, and this was heard the next day by Judge Charles O&#x27;Connor, who said he lacked jurisdiction because of the civil war:
Childers&#x27;s lawyer appealed to the Supreme Court, but before it was even accepted by the court and listed as an appealable case, he was put to death.

==Execution==

Childers was executed on 24 November 1922 by firing squad at the Beggars Bush Barracks in Dublin. Before his execution he shook hands with the firing squad. He obtained a promise from his then 16-year-old son, the future President of Ireland, Erskine Hamilton Childers, to seek out and shake the hand of every man who had signed his death sentence. His final words, spoken to the firing squad, were: &quot;Take a step or two forward, lads, it will be easier that way.&quot;

Childers&#x27;s body was buried at Beggars Bush Barracks until 1923, when it was exhumed and reburied in the republican plot at Glasnevin Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Winston Churchill, who had exerted pressure on Michael Collins and the Free State government to make the treaty work by crushing the rebellion, expressed the view that, &quot;No man has done more harm or shown more genuine malice or endeavoured to bring a greater curse upon the common people of Ireland than this strange being, actuated by a deadly and malignant hatred for the land of his birth.&quot; By contrast, Éamon de Valera said of him, &quot;He died the Prince he was. Of all the men I ever met, I would say he was the noblest.&quot;

On 23 November 2022 the Irish national broadcaster RTÉ transmitted a television programme to mark the centenary of Childers&#x27;s execution. While acknowledging the importance within Ireland of his political and revolutionary achievements, and his role as &quot;an active propagandist&quot; for the revolution, it contended that his fame beyond Ireland now rests only on his novel &quot;The Riddle of the Sands&quot;.

It was the express wish of Molly Childers, upon her death in 1964, that the extensive and meticulous collection of papers and documents from her husband&#x27;s in-depth involvement with the Irish struggles of the 1920s should be locked away until 50 years after his death. In 1972, Erskine Hamilton Childers started the process of finding an official biographer for his father. In 1974, Andrew Boyle (previous biographer of Brendan Bracken and Lord Reith amongst others) was given the task of exploring the vast Childers archive, and his biography of Robert Erskine Childers was finally published in 1977.

In December 2021 &quot;An Post&quot;, the Irish national post office, issued a postage stamp to mark the centenary of Childers&#x27;s execution. Also available was a &quot;first day cover&quot;, with an image of the &quot;Asgard&quot;.

<text>Brendan Comiskey (born August 13, 1935), is the Roman Catholic Bishop Emeritus of the Diocese of Ferns. He was born in Clontibret, County Monaghan, Ireland.

He was ordained a priest of the little known Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary on 25 June 1961, and appointed Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Dublin in 1979.

He was appointed Bishop of Ferns on 4 April 1984.

He resigned on 1 April 2002, over charges that he had failed to deal adequately with allegations that Fr. Seán Fortune and others who were sexually abusing children.

==Early career==
Comiskey&#x27;s early clerical career was extremely promising. He was head of his order in Ireland and the UK by the age of 34, became an auxiliary bishop in the Archdiocese of Dublin at age 45 and soon thereafter was appointed to the Diocese of Ferns at the age of 47. 
In 2016, his name still appeared on the website of his congregation where he said to be a retreat giver whose conferences are &quot;filled with profound content mixed with wit and humour.&quot;

==Diocese mired in clerical sexual abuse==
Brendan Comiskey succeeded the ebullient but utterly ineffective Donal Herlihy as Bishop of Ferns in 1984. Herlihy, a former staff member at the Pontifical Irish College in Rome, is reported to have had alcohol-related issues in his last years as bishop and his governance of the diocese was slack.

As a result of &quot;The Ferns Report&quot;, published by the Irish Government on 25 October 2005 into child sex abuse in this diocese (between 1962 and 2002), the wider Irish public became aware of a catalogue of abuse going back to Herlihy&#x27;s tenure on office involving 100 individual cases involving 21 priests.

It is alleged that Tomás Ó Fiaich, Cardinal Archbishop of Armagh, had been told about the allegations, as had the Holy See.

==Resignation==
Comiskey resigned in 2002 after the transmission of the BBC documentary &quot;Suing the Pope&quot; amid allegations that he did not report allegations that Fr Sean Fortune had abused a number of children while Comiskey was in control of the diocese. Fortune was a serial paedophile with a manipulative personality and Comiskey admits he found him difficult to deal with. Fortune committed suicide while on bail.

According to the founder of the abuse victims&#x27; charity One in Four, Colm O&#x27;Gorman, Comiskey was not alone in his responsibility to report the allegations to civil authorities. O&#x27;Gorman is quoted as saying, &quot;It would be sad if he (Comiskey) was ultimately scapegoated in all this and the church failed to accept full responsibility&quot;.

Bishop Éamonn Walsh was installed in March 2002 as Apostolic Administrator in Ferns and implemented a new child protection policy which resulted in many more historic allegations of child-sexual abuse emerging.

In 2014 Brendan Comiskey &quot;broke his silence&quot; on the child abuse scandal in Ireland claiming that he had done his best and &quot;that he was deeply sorry for all that had happened,&quot;

<text>Quantum Corporation is a data storage, management, and protection company that provides technology to store, manage, archive, and protect video and unstructured data throughout the data life cycle. Their products are used by enterprises, media and entertainment companies, government agencies, big data companies, and life science organizations. Quantum is headquartered in San Jose, California and has offices around the world, supporting customers globally in addition to working with a network of distributors, VARs, DMRs, OEMs and other suppliers.

The company is dual-listed on the NASDAQ Global Market under the ticker symbol &quot;QMCO&quot;, and on the Börse Frankfurt under the ticker symbol &quot;QNT2&quot;.

==History==
Quantum was founded in 1980 as Quantum Corp. By 1984, it led the market for mid-capacity 5.25-inch drives. That year, a subsidiary was launched called Plus Development to focus on the development of hardcards. Plus Development became a successful designer of 3.5-inch drives with Matsushita Kotobuki Electronics (now Panasonic) as the contract manufacturer. By 1989, Quantum led the compact drive market.

The company had 11 new models of 3.5-inch and 2.5-inch drives. It signed distribution agreements with Rein Elektronik in Germany and Inelco Peripheriques in France. It also merged its subsidiary Plus Development Corporation into its Commercial Products Division.

Quantum was the largest drive producer worldwide in 1994.

In 2000, Maxtor agreed to acquire Quantum&#x27;s hard disk drive group. In 2004, Quantum became a member of the LTO Consortium after acquiring Certance.

In 2012, Quantum announced Q-Cloud, which combines on-premise storage with cloud storage. In 2015, the company released a multi-tier storage product, StorNext 5.3, which supports Q-Cloud and powers the company&#x27;s Xcellis workflow storage technology.

In 2018, Jamie Lerner became CEO, and Quantum shifted focus from hard drives/tape to providing data storage, management, and protection for video and other unstructured data.

In 2019, the company added a subscription for cloud-based device management and product, called Distributed Cloud Services.

In 2020-2021 Quantum acquired technology to support the shift in focus including ActiveScale and CatDV. They also acquired video surveillance software from Pivot3.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Quantum was a recipient of a government loan of US$10 million as part of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).

In October 2021, Quantum and IBM announced they would work together to develop LTO-10, the next generation of Linear Tape-Open (LTO) technology.

In April 2023, Quantum announced a new scale-out unstructured data storage platform called Myriad. The solution is software-defined, initially running on Quantum-supplied hardware but capable of running on public cloud infrastructure.

=== Acquisitions ===
Prior to the 2000 merger of the hard drive division, Quantum began a series of tape technology acquisitions:

==Products==
Quantum provides data storage, management, and protection for video and other unstructured data. The company&#x27;s products, solutions and services include:

=== High-performance file system software ===

==== StorNext ====
At the core of Quantum&#x27;s high-performance shared storage product line is Quantum StorNext software which enables video editing and management of large video and image datasets. StorNext software is a parallel file processing system that provides fast streaming performance and data access, a shared file storage environment for Apple Macintosh, Microsoft Windows, and Linux workstations, and intelligent data management to protect data across its lifecycle. StorNext runs on standard servers and is sold with storage arrays that are used within the StorNext environment. These storage arrays include Quantum QXS-Series, a line of high-performance, reliable hybrid storage arrays, offered with either HDDs, SSDs, or some combination of the two. 
StorNext software can also manage data across different types, or pools, of storage, such as public cloud object stores and disk-based object storage systems. StorNext supports a broad range of both private and public object stores. For customers that have been archiving video and image data for years, StorNext is also integrated with tape storage and can assign infrequently used but important data to tape to create a large-scale active archive.

In 2011, the company added the StorNext appliance offerings to its product family. In addition to the StorNext Archive Enabled Library (AEL), the company added a metadata controller (StorNext M330), a scale-out gateway appliance (G300), and several scalable storage systems (QM1200, QS1200 and QD6000). In February 2012, the company bolstered the StorNext appliance family with the addition of the QS2400 Storage System, followed in May by the M660 metadata appliance.

The HSeries is a line of high-performance storage arrays. In January 2021, Quantum introduced its H2000 series of hybrid arrays that provide on-premise storage for media production workflows and block storage arrays that provide an alternative to QXS. It includes the 2U H2012 and the H2024, which provides 307 TB after data reduction. The H4000 appliance series was released in late 2021. The series uses a converged infrastructure that runs file, block, and client services virtually on a single box.

In April 2022, Quantum released the H4000 Essential. It is for small, independent creative teams and provides shared storage and automatic content indexing, discovery, and workflow collaboration by combining Quantum&#x27;s CatDV asset management and the company&#x27;s StorNext 7 shared storage software.

==== F-Series NVMe ====
In April 2019, Quantum introduced F-Series, a new line of NVMe storage arrays “designed for performance, availability, and reliability.” Non-volatile memory express (NVMe) flash drives allow for massive parallel processing, while the latest Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) networking technology provides direct access between workstations and the NVMe storage devices. These hardware features are combined with the Quantum Cloud Storage Platform and the StorNext file system to provide storage capabilities for post-production houses, broadcasters and other rich media environments.

In April 2022, the company&#x27;s F2100 NVMe storage appliance was released as the latest in the F-Series line It provides 50 GB/s for multi-client reads and up to 737 TB of raw NVMe storage, which was an increase from previous F-Series products. To provide proactive system monitoring, it was integrated with Quantum Cloud-Based Analytics software.

==== Xcellis ====
The Quantum Xcellis product line was released in 2015. The first products were designed for disk and SSDs. In 2018, the company added nonvolatile memory express to its Xcellis NAS appliances. The NVMe Xcellis option was designed for flash storage.

=== Tape storage ===
Since 1994, when it acquired the Digital Linear Tape product line from Digital, Quantum has sold tape storage products, including tape drives, media and automation.

==== LTO tape drives and media ====
In 2007, Quantum discontinued development of the DLT line in favor of Linear Tape-Open (LTO), which it began selling in 2005 following its acquisition of Certance. LTO is an open tape format designed for high-capacity long-term storage. It is often used for large-scale cold storage.

In September 2020, Quantum, IBM, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise released the specifications for LTO-9 storage tape technology. Products using this technology were available a year later. In 2021, Quantum partnered with IBM on its development of LTO-10 tape drives and media.

==== Scalar tape libraries ====
In 2012, Quantum introduced its Scalar LTFS (Linear Tape File System) appliance, which offers new modes of portability and user accessibility for archived content on LTO tape.

In 2016, Quantum refreshed its Scalar LTO tape library family and added an appliance for rich media archiving. The three new systems are part of the Quantum Scalar Storage Platform aimed at handling large-scale unstructured data. The Scalar i3 and i6 was introduced with support for LTO-6 and LTO-7 tapes, supporting LTO-9 today. The Quantum Scalar i3 is designed for small to medium-sized businesses and departmental configurations. It scales up to 3 PB in a 12U rack space. The Quantum Scalar i6 is a midrange library for small enterprises. It scales up to 12 PB within a single 48U rack.

The StorNext AEL6 archiving appliance combines the Quantum Scalar i6 library with Quantum&#x27;s StorNext data management software for archive storage. It has self-healing auto-migration and targets rich media use cases. In 2021, Quantum introduced Scalar Ransom Block to prevent ransomware attacks on its Scalar tape libraries.

=== Backup appliances ===

==== DXi-Series ====
Quantum introduced its first disk-based backup and recovery product, the DX30, in 2002 and has continued to build out this product line.

At the end of 2006, shortly after its acquisition of Advanced Digital Information Corporation (ADIC), Quantum announced the first of its DXi-Series products incorporating data deduplication technology which ADIC had acquired from a small Australian company called Rocksoft earlier that year. 
Quantum expanded and enhanced this product line.

DXi-Series products incorporate Quantum&#x27;s data deduplication technology, providing typical data reduction ratios of 15:1 or 93%. The company offers both target and source-based deduplication as well as integrated path-to-tape capability. DXi works with all major backup applications, including Symantec&#x27;s OpenStorage (OST) API, Oracle SBT API, Veeam DMS, and supports everything from remote offices to corporate data centers. Quantum includes almost all software licenses for each model in the base price.

In 2011, in addition to its DXi-Series of disk backup products, Quantum offered its RDX removable disk libraries and NDX-8 NAS appliances for data protection in small business environments. In 2012, Quantum announced a virtual deduplication appliance, the DXi V1000.

In January, 2019, Quantum refreshed its DXi series, with the addition of the DXi9000 and DXi4800. The DXi9000 targets the enterprise market, scaling from 51 TB to 1 petabyte of usable capacity. The 12 TB hard drives allow for more storage using less physical space. The DXi4800 is a smaller-scale appliance targeting midmarket organizations and remote sites.

In 2021, Quantum replaced the V2000 and V4000 with the DXi V5000. The DXi is offered in both virtual and physical appliances, used by remote and branch offices that need a backup target system.

=== Virtual machine data protection ===
Quantum&#x27;s vmPRO software and appliances were used for protecting virtual machine (VM) data. vmPRO software worked with DXi appliances and users&#x27; existing backup applications to integrate VM backup and recovery into their existing data protection processes.

In March 2012, Quantum announced that its vmPRO technology and DXi V1000 virtual appliance had been selected by Xerox as a key component of the company&#x27;s cloud backup and disaster recovery (DR) services.

In August 2012, Quantum announced Q-Cloud, its own branded cloud-based data protection service, which is also based on vmPRO and DXi technology.

=== Media asset management software ===
CatDV is a media management and workflow automation platform that helps organizations manage large volumes of unstructured data such as video, images, audio files, and PDF digital assets. The software catalogs and analyzes these files and can be used with Quantum&#x27;s StorNext file storage.

In April 2022, the company released the NVIDIA AI platform to provide AI and machine learning (ML) to video production and data management workflows via CatDV software. The new platform combines the CatDV asset management and automation platform, NVIDIA A2 Tensor Core GPU infrastructure, and the NVIDIA Deepstream, Riva, and Maxine software development kits.

=== Object storage ===

==== Lattus ====
In late 2012, Quantum introduced the Lattus product family OEMed from Amplidata, an object storage system composed of storage nodes, access nodes and controller nodes for large data stores.
Lattus-X was the first disk-based archive in the Lattus family that includes a native HTTP REST interface, and CIFS and NFS access to applications.

==== ActiveScale software and systems ====
In 2020, Quantum entered into an agreement with Western Digital Technologies, Inc. to acquire its ActiveScale object storage business. ActiveScale allows companies to manage, protect, and preserve unstructured data, from a few hundred terabytes to tens of petabytes. It is used in industries such as media and entertainment, surveillance, big data, genomics, HPC, telecom, and medical imaging.

In 2021, Quantum released subscription-based ActiveScale 6.0.

==== Cold storage archives ====
In October 2021, Quantum introduced ActiveScale Cold Storage as a storage-as-a-service (STaaS) offering. It combines the company&#x27;s tape technology with the ActiveScale object storage platform. It is also used to store, migrate, and restore objects to and from the cold archives.

=== Video surveillance storage ===
Quantum has a number of products that capture and store video data, including video recording servers and hyperconverged storage systems. The VS-HCI series provides hyperconverged infrastructure for surveillance recording and video management.

In July 2021, Quantum acquired assets and intellectual property from Pivot3, a hyperconverged infrastructure technology company. Pivot3&#x27;s video surveillance appliances, NVRs, management applications, and scale-out hyperconverged software are sold under Quantum&#x27;s VS-Series product portfolio. In August 2021, Quantum acquired EnCloudEn, a hyperconverged infrastructure software company.

In March 2022, the company released the Unified Surveillance Platform (USP). The software platform could be used to record and store video surveillance data and runs on standard servers.

=== Autonomous vehicle edge storage ===
Quantum&#x27;s R-Series Edge Storage is a ruggedized storage system that captures large amounts of data generated by vehicles. The removable storage allows the data to be quickly transferred to a centralized data center.

=== Fireball ===
The Fireball brand of hard drives were manufactured between 1995 and 2001. In 1995, 540 MB Fireball hard drives using ATA and SCSI were available. In 1997, the Fireball ST, available in 1.6 GB to 6.4 GB capacities, was considered a top performer, while the Fireball TM was significantly slower.

<text>Warren Bruce Rudman (May 18, 1930November 19, 2012) was an American attorney and politician who served as a United States Senator from New Hampshire from 1980 to 1993. A member of the Republican Party, he was known as a moderate centrist, to such an extent that President Clinton approached him in 1994 about replacing departing Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen in Clinton&#x27;s cabinet, an offer that Rudman declined.

After two terms in office, Rudman chose not to run for re-election in 1992. At the time of his death, he was a co-chair of Albright Stonebridge Group, a retired partner in the international law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison, as well as an advisory board member of Promontory Financial Group. He previously sat on the board of directors of Raytheon, Collins &amp; Aikman, Allied Waste, Boston Scientific and a number of funds in the Dreyfus Family of Funds.

==Early life and education==
Rudman was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the son of Theresa (née Levenson) and Edward
G. Rudman. His family were Jewish immigrants from Germany, Poland, and Russia. Rudman lived his entire life in New Hampshire, with few exceptions. He attended the Valley Forge Military Academy boarding school in Wayne, Pennsylvania. He received his undergraduate degree from Syracuse University, and served in the United States Army during the Korean War. He received his J.D. degree from Boston College Law School in 1960, and was appointed Attorney General of New Hampshire in 1970; serving in that capacity until 1976.

==Career==
From 2004 to 2006, Rudman led a team of attorneys that investigated accounting practices at Fannie Mae.

Prior to the September 11 attacks, Rudman had served on a now oft-cited national panel investigating the threat of international terrorism. He, along with fellow former Senator Gary Hart (D-CO), chaired the panel, and both Rudman and Hart have been lauded since September 11 for their prescient conclusions.

Rudman was an Advisory Board member and Co-Chair of the Partnership for a Secure America, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to recreating the bipartisan center in American national security and foreign policy.

Rudman was one of the few Jewish politicians elected in New Hampshire. He spent his final years as a resident of Hollis, New Hampshire, a suburb of Nashua.

He was the author of a memoir called &quot;Combat&quot;.

===Senate career===

Rudman defeated incumbent John Durkin in the 1980 election, riding the wave of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s landslide victory. Durkin resigned and Governor Hugh Gallen appointed Rudman to fill the vacancy in late December 1980. Rudman served on the Senate Appropriations Committee and the Ethics Committee. His best-known legislative effort was the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act.

A moderate Republican, Rudman was conservative on matters of fiscal and defense policy—favoring tax cuts, reduced domestic spending, and higher military spending, but liberal on social issues—supporting a woman&#x27;s right to choose to have an abortion, gay rights, and opposing a constitutional amendment mandating voluntary school prayer. Rudman, along with John H. Sununu, was a key player in the appointment of Rudman&#x27;s personal friend, Supreme Court Justice David Souter, to both the First Circuit Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; later editorialized about the appointment, saying: &quot;Rudman, the man who helped put liberal jurist David Souter on the high court&quot; and who in his &quot;Yankee Republican liberalism&quot; took &quot;pride in recounting how he sold Mr. Souter to gullible White House chief of staff John Sununu as a confirmable conservative. Then they both sold the judge to President Bush, who wanted above all else to avoid a confirmation battle.&quot; Rudman wrote in his memoir that he had &quot;suspected all along&quot; that Souter would not &quot;overturn activist liberal precedents.&quot; Sununu later said of Rudman, &quot;In spite of it all, he&#x27;s a good friend. But I&#x27;ve always known that he was more liberal than he liked the world to think he was.&quot;

===Post-Senate years===
After leaving the Senate, Rudman continued to practice law and be an active member in national politics. Senator John McCain asked Rudman to serve as his campaign chair during McCain&#x27;s 2000 presidential campaign. On January 8, 2001, he was presented with the Presidential Citizens Medal by President Clinton.

He was twice considered as a possible vice presidential candidate on the ticket of two parties other than the GOP. In 1996, Ross Perot offered Rudman the slot to be his vice presidential running mate on the Reform Party ticket, but Rudman refused (as did former Democratic Senator David Boren of Oklahoma). Perot eventually selected Pat Choate. In 2004, Rudman was mentioned as possible running mate for Democratic nominee John Kerry. Kerry eventually selected John Edwards.

In 1999, a leaked report by the U.S. National Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC) stated that Carlos Hank González, a Mexican criminal, politician and influential businessman, and his two sons are so involved in drug trafficking and money laundering that they &quot;pose a significant criminal threat to the United States.&quot; After the report was disclosed, the Hank family mobilized to rebut the allegations, hiring high-profile lawyers including Rudman. Rudman was an attorney with the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison, and represented Hank Gonzalez&#x27;s oldest son, Carlos Hank Rhon.

Rudman lobbied the government to disavow the report and in March 2000 Attorney General Janet Reno wrote a letter that said the report &quot;was beyond the substantive expertise and area of responsibility of the NDIC.″ At Rudman&#x27;s request, a copy of Reno&#x27;s letter was sent to Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan because of the Hank family&#x27;s banking interests in the United States. Carlos Hank Rhon was later fined $40 million to settle charges that he violated banking laws when he bought Laredo National Bancshares in Texas and failed to disclose the sale of a $20 million share in Laredo National to his father.

He was a co-chair, along with former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and former National Security Advisor Sandy Berger, of Albright Stonebridge Group, a global business consulting and strategy firm based in Washington, D.C.

He died of lymphoma in Washington on November 19, 2012, only a month after Durkin.

After his death, President Obama praised Rudman as an early advocate for fiscal responsibility.

<text>Elastoplast is a brand of adhesive bandages (also called &quot;sticking plasters&quot;) and medical dressing made by Beiersdorf. 

==Background==
In 1928 Smith &amp; Nephew of the UK acquired the licence to market and produce the Elastoplast range of bandages. Beiersdorf bought the brand in 2000.

In some countries in Europe &quot;Hansaplast&quot;, a brand name started by Beiersdorf in 1922, is used instead. A third trademark, named &quot;Curitas&quot;, is used in parts of Latin America.

Nick Kochan wrote about Elastoplast in his book &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Brands&quot; (1996); noting that &quot;the early success of the brand was due to its high-stretch fabric material coupled with an effective adhesive&quot;; and that it has as strong position in worldwide markets, particularly in the UK.

In the 1970s Elastoplast marketed its Airstrip product as &quot;the fresh air plaster&quot;. The plasters were sold in small flat tin.

On 4 July 2005 Elastoplast launched a £1.1 million advertising campaign which introduced brand heroes called &quot;the Plastermen&quot;, which had helped advertise the newly launched SilverHealing plasters.

<doc id="504866" wikidata="Q194896" url="?curid=504866" title="William Rees-Mogg">
<text>William Rees-Mogg, Baron Rees-Mogg (14 July 192829 December 2012) was a British newspaper journalist who was Editor of &quot;The Times&quot; from 1967 to 1981. In the late 1970s he served as High Sheriff of Somerset, and in the 1980s was Chairman of the Arts Council of Great Britain and Vice-Chairman of the BBC&#x27;s Board of Governors. He was the father of the politicians Sir Jacob and Annunziata Rees-Mogg.

== Early life ==
William Rees-Mogg was born in 1928 in Bristol, England. He was the son of Edmund Fletcher Rees-Mogg (1889–1962) of Cholwell House in the parish of Cameley in Somerset, an Anglican, and his Irish American Catholic wife, Beatrice Warren, a daughter of Daniel Warren of New York. William Rees-Mogg was raised in the Roman Catholic faith.

He was educated at Clifton College Preparatory School in Bristol and Charterhouse in Godalming, where he was Head of School.

Not yet eighteen, Rees-Mogg went up to Balliol College, Oxford, as a Brackenbury Scholar to read history in January 1946 as a place had fallen temporarily vacant. By the end of the Trinity (summer) term, he had been elected to the library committee (the junior committee) of the Oxford Union Society and was due to be an officer of the Oxford University Conservative Association under Margaret Roberts (the future Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher), President for Michaelmas (autumn) Term 1946.

However, having spent two terms at Oxford he did not return in October. He later wrote that he had been forced to give up his place to a disabled ex-serviceman. From 1946 to 1948, beginning with an exceptionally bitter winter, he did his National Service in the Royal Air Force education department rising to the rank of sergeant. His duties included teaching illiterate recruits to read and write, and his reference from his commanding officer stated that he was competent to perform simple tasks under supervision.

He returned to Oxford to complete his degree, and became President of Oxford University Conservative Association in Michaelmas Term 1950 and President of the Oxford Union in Trinity term, 1951. He graduated that term with a second-class degree.

== Career ==
Rees-Mogg began his career in journalism in London at the &quot;Financial Times&quot; in 1952, becoming chief leader writer in 1955 and, in addition, assistant editor in 1957. During this period he was Conservative candidate for the safe Labour seat of Chester-le-Street in a by-election on 27 September 1956, losing to the Labour candidate Norman Pentland by 21,287 votes, as he did in the subsequent general election by a similar margin.

He moved to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in 1960, later becoming its Deputy Editor from 1964 where he wrote &quot;A Captain&#x27;s Innings&quot;, which many believe convinced Alec Douglas-Home to resign as Tory leader, making way for Edward Heath, in July 1965.

Rees-Mogg was editor of &quot;The Times&quot; from 1967 to 1981. In a 1967 editorial entitled &quot;Who breaks a butterfly on a wheel?&quot;, he criticised the severity of the custodial sentence for Mick Jagger on a drugs offence. With colleagues, he attempted a buyout of Times Group Newspapers in 1981 to stop its sale by the Thomson Organisation to Rupert Murdoch, but was unsuccessful. Murdoch replaced him as editor with Harold Evans. Rees-Mogg wrote a comment column for &quot;The Independent&quot; from its foundation in the autumn of 1986 until near the end of 1992, when he rejoined &quot;The Times&quot;, where he remained a columnist until shortly before his death. In his &quot;Memoirs&quot;, published in 2011, he wrote of Murdoch: &quot;Looking back, he has been an excellent proprietor for the Times, but also for Fleet Street.&quot;

Rees-Mogg was a member of the BBC&#x27;s Board of Governors and chairman of the Arts Council, overseeing a major reform of the latter body which halved the number of arts organisations receiving regular funding and reduced the Council&#x27;s direct activities. Having been High Sheriff of Somerset from 1978 to 1979, he was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 1981 Birthday Honours and knighted by Elizabeth II in an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 3 November 1981. In the 1988 Birthday Honours, Rees-Mogg was made a life peer on 8 August that year as Baron Rees-Mogg, of Hinton Blewitt in the County of Avon, and sat in the House of Lords as a cross-bencher, having twice attempted to become a Conservative MP in the 1950s. He was a member of the European Reform Forum. The University of Bath awarded him an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Laws) in 1977.

He co-authored, with James Dale Davidson, three books on the general topic of financial investment and the future of capitalism: &quot;Blood in the Streets&quot;, &quot;The Great Reckoning&quot;, and &quot;The Sovereign Individual&quot;. Published in 1997, &quot;The Sovereign Individual&quot; argues that in an internet age the nation state will become outmoded, and an era of the individual will develop. Peter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal, stated in 2014 that &quot;The Sovereign Individual&quot; was the most influential book he had read. &quot;The Sovereign Individual&quot; has had a strong influence on neoreactionary (NRx) politics.

Writing in &quot;The Times&quot; in 2001, Lord Rees-Mogg, who had a house in Somerset, described himself as &quot;a country person who spends most of his time in London&quot;, and attempted to define the characteristics of a &quot;country person&quot;. He also wrote that Tony Blair was as unpopular in rural England as Mrs Thatcher had been in Scotland. By now his liberal attitude to drugs policy had led to his being mocked as &quot;Mogadon Man&quot; by &quot;Private Eye&quot;. The magazine later referred to him as &quot;Mystic Mogg&quot; (a pun on &quot;Mystic Meg&quot;, a tabloid astrologer) because of the perception that his economic and political predictions were ultimately found to be inaccurate.

Rees-Mogg served as the chairman of the London publishing firm Pickering &amp; Chatto Publishers and of NewsMax Media and wrote a weekly column for &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot;. He also collected 18th-century literature.

== Personal life ==
Rees-Mogg and his wife Gillian Shakespeare Morris (b.1939) married in 1962. She is the daughter of Thomas Richard Morris, who was a lorry driver and later a car salesman. Rees-Mogg became a Conservative councillor and Mayor in the Borough of St Pancras, and later councillor for the Kings Cross ward of the London Borough of Camden. He was also a JP.

They had five children. They are:

* The Honorable Emma Beatrice Rees-Mogg (born 1962), who married David William Hilton Craigie in 1990. The couple have four children. She is a novelist under the name Emma Craigie.
* The Honorable Charlotte Louise Rees-Mogg (born 1964)
* The Honorable Thomas Fletcher Rees-Mogg (born 1966), who married Modwenna Northcote in 1996. The couple have four children.
* The Right Honorable Sir Jacob William Rees-Mogg (born 24 May 1969), who was elected Conservative MP for the new constituency of North East Somerset in 2010, serving until 2024, after having stood unsuccessfully as a candidate for the Conservative Party in the 1997 and 2001 general elections (in Central Fife and The Wrekin respectively). He married Helena de Chair in 2007. The couple have six children. In July 2019, he was appointed Leader of the House of Commons and Lord President of the Council in the Johnson ministry.
* The Honorable Annunziata Mary Rees-Mogg (born 25 March 1979), who stood unsuccessfully as a candidate for the Conservative Party in the 2005 general election in Aberavon, and in Somerton and Frome at the 2010 election. She was elected as a Member of the European Parliament for the Brexit Party in 2019.

Rees-Mogg, a Roman Catholic, argued that the image of an ultra-conservative papacy is false and that the Vatican must overhaul its PR machine (as of 2009).

In 1964, Rees-Mogg purchased Ston Easton Park near Bath, Somerset, the former home of the Hippisley family. The house had been threatened with demolition, and Rees-Mogg partially restored it. He sold the house to the Smedley family in 1978.

Afflicted by oesophageal cancer, he became seriously ill just before Christmas 2012, and died in London on 29 December at the age of 84. Rees-Mogg&#x27;s funeral was held at Westminster Cathedral on 9 January 2013, with his body being buried in the graveyard of the Church of St James at Cameley in the county of Somerset.

<doc id="504867" wikidata="Q2372837" url="?curid=504867" title="Air Florida Flight 90">
<text>Air Florida Flight 90 was a scheduled domestic passenger flight operated from Washington National Airport (now Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport) to Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport, with an intermediate stopover at Tampa International Airport. On January 13, 1982, the Boeing 737-200 that executed the flight, registered as N62AF, crashed into the 14th Street Bridge over the Potomac River just after takeoff from Washington National Airport.

Striking the bridge, which carries Interstate 395 between Washington, D.C., and Arlington County, Virginia, it hit seven occupied vehicles and destroyed of guard rail before plunging through the ice into the Potomac River. The aircraft was carrying 74 passengers and five crew members. Only four passengers and one crew member (flight attendant Kelly Duncan) were rescued from the crash and survived. Another passenger, Arland D. Williams Jr., assisted in the rescue of the survivors, but drowned before he could be rescued. Four motorists on the bridge were killed. The survivors were rescued from the icy river by civilians and professionals. President Ronald Reagan commended these acts during his State of the Union speech 13 days later.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the cause of the accident was pilot error. The pilots failed to switch on the engines&#x27; internal ice protection systems, used reverse thrust in a snowstorm prior to takeoff, tried to use the jet exhaust of a plane in front of them to melt their ice, and failed to abandon the takeoff even after detecting a power problem while taxiing and ice and snow buildup on the wings.

==Background==

=== Aircraft ===

The aircraft involved, a 13-year-old Boeing 737-222, registered as N62AF, was manufactured in 1969 and previously flown by United Airlines under the registration N9050U. It was sold to Air Florida in 1980. The aircraft was powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D-9A turbofan engines, and had flown over 27,000 hours before the accident.

=== Cockpit crew ===
The Captain, Larry M. Wheaton, aged 34, was hired by Air Florida in October 1978 as a first officer. He was promoted to captain in August 1980. At the time of the accident, he had about 8,300 total flight hours, with 2,322 hours of commercial jet experience, all logged at Air Florida. He had logged 1,752 hours on the Boeing 737, the accident aircraft type, 1,100 of those hours as captain.

Wheaton was described by fellow pilots as a quiet person, with good operational skills and knowledge, who had operated well in high-workload flying situations. His leadership style was described as similar to those of other pilots. On May 8, 1980, though, he was suspended after failing a Boeing 737 company line check and was found to be unsatisfactory in these areas: adherence to regulations, checklist usage, flight procedures such as departures and autopilot usage, and approaches and landings. He resumed his duties after passing a retest on August 27, 1980. On April 24, 1981, he received an unsatisfactory grade on a company recurrent proficiency check when he showed deficiencies in memory items, knowledge of aircraft systems, and aircraft limitations. Three days later, he satisfactorily passed a proficiency recheck.

The first officer, Roger A. Pettit, aged 31, was hired by Air Florida on October 3, 1980, as a first officer on the Boeing 737. At the time of the accident, he had around 3,353 flight hours, 992 with Air Florida, all on the 737. From October 1977 to October 1980, he had been a fighter pilot in the US Air Force, accumulating 669 hours as a flight examiner, instructor pilot, and ground instructor in an F-15 fighter unit.

The first officer was described by personal friends and pilots as a witty, bright, outgoing individual with an excellent command of physical and mental skills in aircraft piloting. Those who had flown with him during stressful flight operations said that during those times, he remained the same witty, sharp individual, &quot;who knew his limitations.&quot; Several persons said that he was the type of pilot who would not hesitate to speak up if he knew something specific was wrong with flight operations.

Alternating the role of &quot;primary pilot&quot; between the pilot in command (PIC), the captain, and second in command (SIC), the first officer, is customary in commercial airline operations, with pilots swapping roles after each leg. One pilot is designated the pilot flying (PF) and the other as pilot monitoring (PM); however, the PIC retains the ultimate authority for all aircraft operations and safety. The first officer was on the controls as the PF during the Air Florida Flight 90 accident.

===Weather conditions===
On Wednesday, January 13, 1982, Washington National Airport (DCA) was closed following a heavy snowstorm, which produced of snow. It reopened at noon under marginal conditions as the snowfall began to slacken.

That afternoon, the plane was to return to Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport, with an intermediate stop at Tampa International Airport. The scheduled departure time was delayed about 1 hour and 45 minutes because of a backlog of arrivals and departures caused by the temporary closing of Washington National Airport. As the plane was readied for departure from DCA, a moderate snowfall continued and the air temperature was .

===Improper de-icing procedures===
The Boeing 737 was de-iced with a mixture of heated water and monopropylene glycol by American Airlines, under a ground-service agreement with Air Florida. That agreement specified that covers for the pitot tubes, static ports, and engine inlets had to be used, but the American Airlines employees failed to comply with those rules. One deicing vehicle was used by two different operators, who chose widely different mixture percentages to de-ice the left and right sides of the aircraft. Subsequent testing of the deicing truck showed, &quot;the mixture dispensed differed substantially from the mixture selected&quot; (18% actual vs. 30% selected). The inaccurate mixture was the result of the replacement of the standard nozzle, &quot;...which is specially modified and calibrated, with a non-modified, commercially available nozzle.&quot; The operator had no means to determine if the proportioning valves were operating properly because no &quot;mix monitor&quot; was installed on the nozzle.

==Events of crash==

===Flight===
The plane had trouble leaving the gate when the ground-services tug could not get traction on the icy ramp. For roughly 30 to 90 seconds, the crew attempted to back away from the gate using the reverse thrust of the engines (a powerback), which proved futile. Boeing operations bulletins had warned against using reverse thrust in those kinds of conditions.

Eventually, a ground tug unit properly equipped with snow chains was used to push the aircraft back from the gate. After leaving the gate, the aircraft waited in a taxi line with many other aircraft for 49 minutes before reaching the takeoff runway. The pilot apparently decided not to return to the gate for reapplication of deicing, fearing that the flight&#x27;s departure would be even further delayed. More snow and ice accumulated on the wings during that period, and the crew was aware of that fact when they decided to take off. Heavy snow was falling during their takeoff roll at 3:59 pm EST.

Though the outside temperature was well below freezing and snow was falling, the crew did not activate the engine anti-ice systems. This system uses heat from the engines to prevent sensors and the engine intake cowl from accumulating ice or snow, ensuring accurate readings.

While running through the takeoff checklist, the following conversation snippet took place (CAM-1 is the captain, CAM-2 is the first officer):

As a result, this caused the engine pressure ratio (EPR) thrust indicators to provide false readings. The correct engine power setting for the temperature and airport altitude of Washington National at the time was 2.04 EPR, but analysis of the engine noise recorded on the cockpit voice recorder indicated that the actual power output corresponded with an engine pressure ratio of only 1.70.

Neither pilot had much experience flying in snowy, cold weather. The captain had made only eight takeoffs or landings in snowy conditions on the 737, and the first officer had flown in snow only twice.

Adding to the plane&#x27;s troubles was the pilots&#x27; decision to maneuver closely behind a DC-9 that was taxiing just ahead of them prior to takeoff, due to their mistaken belief that the warmth from the DC-9&#x27;s engines would melt the snow and ice that had accumulated on Flight 90&#x27;s wings. This action, which went specifically against flight-manual recommendations for an icing situation, actually contributed to icing on the 737. The exhaust gases from the other aircraft melted the snow on the wings, but instead of falling off the plane during takeoff, this slush mixture froze on the wings&#x27; leading edges and the engine inlet nose cone.

As the takeoff roll began, the first officer noted several times to the captain that the instrument panel readings he was seeing did not seem to reflect reality (he was referring to the fact that the plane did not appear to have developed as much power as it needed for takeoff, despite the instruments indicating otherwise). The captain dismissed these concerns and let the takeoff proceed. Investigators determined that plenty of time and space on the runway remained for the captain to have abandoned the takeoff, and criticized his refusal to listen to his first officer, who was correct that the instrument panel readings were wrong. The pilot was told not to delay because another aircraft was out on final approach to the same runway. The following is a transcript of Flight 90&#x27;s cockpit voice recorder during the plane&#x27;s acceleration down the runway.

As the plane became briefly airborne, the voice recorder picked up the following from the cockpit, with the sound of the stick-shaker (a device that warns that the plane is in danger of stalling) in the background:

The aircraft traveled almost half a mile (800 m) farther down the runway than is customary before liftoff was accomplished. Survivors of the crash indicated the trip over the runway was extremely rough, with survivor Joe Stiley—a businessman and private pilot—saying that he believed that they would not get airborne and would &quot;fall off the end of the runway&quot;. When the plane became airborne, Stiley told his co-worker (and survivor) Nikki Felch to assume the crash position, with some nearby passengers following their example.

Although the 737 did manage to become airborne, it attained a maximum altitude of just before it began losing altitude. Recorders later indicated that the aircraft was airborne for just 30 seconds. At 4:01 pm EST, it crashed into the 14th Street Bridge across the Potomac River, from the end of the runway. The plane hit six cars and a truck on the bridge, and tore away of the bridge&#x27;s rail and of the bridge&#x27;s wall. The aircraft then plunged into the freezing Potomac River. It fell between two of the three spans of the bridge, between the I-395 northbound span (the Rochambeau Bridge) and the high-occupancy vehicle lane north- and southbound spans, about offshore. All but the tail section quickly became submerged.

Of the people on board the aircraft:

* Four of the crew members (including both pilots) died.
* One crew member was seriously injured.
* Seventy of the 74 passengers died.
* Nineteen occupants were believed to have survived the impact, but their injuries prevented them from escaping.

Of the motorists on the bridge involved:

* Four sustained fatal injuries
* One sustained serious injuries
* Three sustained minor injuries

Clinging to the tail section of the broken airliner in the ice-choked Potomac River were flight attendant Kelly Duncan and four passengers: Patricia &quot;Nikki&quot; Felch, Joe Stiley, Arland D. Williams Jr. (strapped and tangled in his seat), and Priscilla Tirado. Duncan inflated the only flotation device they could find, and passed it to the severely injured Felch. Passenger Bert Hamilton, who was floating in the water nearby, was the first to be pulled from the water.

===Crash response===

Many federal offices in downtown Washington had closed early that day in response to quickly developing blizzard conditions. Thus, significant backups of traffic existed on almost all of the city&#x27;s roads, which made it unusually difficult for ambulances to reach the crash site. The Coast Guard&#x27;s harbor tugboat &quot;Capstan&quot; (WYTL 65601) and its crew were based nearby; their duties include icebreaking and responding to water rescues. The &quot;Capstan&quot; was considerably farther downriver on another search-and-rescue mission. Emergency ground response was hampered by ice-covered roads and gridlocked traffic; ambulances dispatched at 4:07 pm took 20 minutes to reach the crash scene. Ambulances attempting to reach the crash site were even driven down the sidewalk in front of the White House. Rescuers who reached the site were unable to assist survivors in the water because they did not have adequate equipment to reach them. Water temperature, about , and heavy ice made swimming out to the victims impossible. Multiple attempts to throw a makeshift lifeline (made of belts and other items which could be tied together) out to the survivors proved ineffective. The rescue attempts by emergency officials and witnesses were recorded and broadcast live by area news reporters, and because the accident occurred in the nation&#x27;s capital, large numbers of media personnel were on hand to provide quick and extensive coverage.

Roger Olian, a sheet-metal foreman at St. Elizabeths Hospital, a Washington psychiatric hospital, was on his way home across the 14th Street Bridge when he heard a man yelling that an aircraft was in the water. He was the first to jump into the water to attempt to reach the survivors. At the same time, several military personnel from the Pentagon—Steve Raynes, Aldo De La Cruz, and Steve Bell—ran to the water&#x27;s edge to help Olian.

At this point, air traffic controllers and flight controllers were aware only that the plane had disappeared from radar and was not responding to radio calls, and had no idea what had happened or where the plane was located.

Around 4:20 pm EST, &quot;Eagle 1&quot;, a United States Park Police Bell 206L-1 Long Ranger helicopter, based at the &quot;Eagles Nest&quot; at Anacostia Park in Washington, arrived and began attempting to airlift the survivors to shore. At great risk to themselves, the crew worked close to the water&#x27;s surface, at one time coming so close to the ice-clogged river that the helicopter&#x27;s skids dipped beneath the surface. At this point, survivors had been in the 34-degree water for over 20 minutes.

The helicopter crew lowered a line to survivors to tow them to shore. First to receive the line was Bert Hamilton, who was treading water about from the plane&#x27;s floating tail and closest to the helicopter. The pilot pulled him across the ice to shore, while avoiding the sides of the bridge. By then, some fire and rescue personnel had arrived to join the military personnel and civilians who pulled Hamilton (and the next, last three survivors) from the water&#x27;s edge up to waiting ambulances; rescuers and civilians on the banks had to duck to avoid the helicopter&#x27;s rotors. The helicopter returned to the aircraft&#x27;s tail, and this time Arland D. Williams Jr. (sometimes referred to as &quot;the sixth passenger&quot;) caught the line. Williams, not able to unstrap himself from the wreckage, passed the line to flight attendant Kelly Duncan, who was airlifted to shore. On its third trip back to the wreckage, the helicopter lowered two lifelines, fearing that the remaining survivors had only a few minutes before succumbing to hypothermia. Williams, still strapped into the wreckage, passed one line to Joe Stiley, who was holding on to panic-stricken Priscilla Tirado, who had lost her husband and baby. Stiley&#x27;s co-worker, Nikki Felch, took the second line. As the helicopter pulled the three through the water and blocks of ice toward shore, both Tirado and Felch lost their grip and fell back into the water. While being dragged through the ice to the riverbank by the helicopter, Stiley broke multiple ribs.

Tirado, seriously injured and blinded by jet fuel, was too weak to grab the line when the helicopter returned to her. A watching bystander, Congressional Budget Office assistant Lenny Skutnik, stripped off his coat and boots, and in short sleeves, dove into the icy water and swam out to successfully pull her to shore. The helicopter then proceeded to where Felch had fallen, and paramedic Gene Windsor stepped onto the helicopter skid and grabbed Felch&#x27;s clothing to lift her onto the skid and bring her to shore. Ten minutes passed from the time the helicopter arrived on scene until Felch&#x27;s rescue.

When the helicopter crew returned for Williams, the wreckage he was strapped into had rolled slightly, submerging him; according to the coroner, Williams was the only passenger to die by drowning. His body and those of the other occupants were recovered later.

The inclement weather had caused an early start to Washington&#x27;s rush-hour traffic, frustrating the response time of emergency crews. The early rush hour also meant that trains on the Washington Metro were full when, just 30 minutes after Flight 90 crashed, the Metro suffered its first fatal crash, at Federal Triangle station. This meant that Washington&#x27;s nearest airport, one of its main bridges in or out of the city, and one of its busiest subway lines were all closed simultaneously, paralyzing much of the metropolitan area.

== Media responses ==
The first member of the news media to arrive was Chester Panzer of WRC-TV. Panzer and a crew member were stuck in traffic in their news vehicle on the George Washington Parkway when the plane crashed a few hundred yards from them. Minutes later, they were shooting video footage of the crash scene, depicting wreckage and survivors in the water, along with the arrival of first responders. Panzer captured Skutnik&#x27;s dive to pull Tirado from the water. Panzer was a 1983 Pulitzer Prize finalist for this spot news photography.

Charles &quot;Charlie&quot; Pereira, a photographer with the United States Park Police, immediately ran to the 14th Street Bridge upon learning of the crash and captured the only still images from the rescue. He was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for his photography.

John Goldsmith, an off-beat reporter for WDVM-TV (now WUSA), was coincidentally at National Airport prior to the incident reporting on the snowstorm, and even caught footage of Flight 90 prior to takeoff. He was first on the air with the story.

Among the plethora of news coverage of the incident, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; published a story about the then-unidentified survivor of the crash, Arland D. Williams Jr., who had handed the lifeline to others and drowned before he could be rescued:

The day after the crash, WWDC &quot;shock jock&quot; Howard Stern pretended to call the Air Florida ticket counter to ask about buying tickets to the 14th Street Bridge.

==NTSB investigation and conclusion==
The 737 had broken into several large pieces upon impact—the nose and cockpit section, the cabin up to the wing attachment point, the cabin from behind the wings to the rear airstairs, and the empennage. Although actual impact speeds were low and well within survivability limits, the structural breakup of the fuselage and exposure to freezing water nonetheless proved fatal for all persons aboard the plane except those seated in the tail section. The NTSB concluded that the accident was not survivable. Determining the position of the rudder, slats, elevators, and ailerons was not possible due to impact damage and destruction of the majority of flight control systems.

The NTSB determined that the probable cause of the crash included the flight crew&#x27;s failure to enforce a sterile cockpit during the final preflight checklist procedure. The engines&#x27; anti-ice heaters were not engaged during ground operation and takeoff. The decision to take off with snow/ice on the airfoil surfaces of the aircraft, and the captain&#x27;s failure to reject the takeoff during the early stage, when his attention was called to anomalous engine instrument readings, were also erroneous.

The NTSB further stated:

==Long-term aftermath==

===Honors===
The &quot;sixth passenger&quot;, who had survived the crash and had repeatedly given up the rescue lines to other survivors before drowning, was later identified as 46-year-old bank examiner Arland D. Williams Jr. The repaired span of the 14th Street Bridge complex over the Potomac River at the crash site, then named the Rochambeau Bridge, was renamed the Arland D. Williams Jr. Memorial Bridge in his honor. The Citadel in South Carolina, from which he graduated in 1957, has several memorials to him. In 2003, the new Arland D. Williams Jr. Elementary School was dedicated in his hometown of Mattoon in Coles County, Illinois.

Civilians Roger Olian and Lenny Skutnik received the Coast Guard&#x27;s Gold Lifesaving Medal. Arland D. Williams, Jr. also received the award posthumously. Skutnik was introduced to the joint session of the U.S. Congress during President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s State of the Union speech later that month.

The Coast Guard awarded a Silver Lifesaving Medal to two crewmen of the U.S. Park Police helicopter &quot;Eagle 1&quot;. As the U.S. Park Police are part of the United States Department of the Interior, pilot Donald W. Usher and paramedic Melvin E. Windsor also received the Interior Department&#x27;s Valor Award, presented in a special ceremony soon after the accident by Secretary of the Interior James G. Watt. Usher later became superintendent of the National Park Service Law Enforcement Training Center located at FLETC in Brunswick, Georgia, before retiring in December 2012.

Roger Olian, Lenny Skutnik, Donald Usher, and Melvin Windsor each received the Carnegie Hero Fund Medal. Kelly Duncan, the only surviving flight attendant, was recognized in the NTSB accident report for her &quot;unselfish act&quot; of giving the only life vest she could find to a passenger.

=== Regulatory and procedure changes ===
The investigation following the crash, especially regarding the failure of the captain to respond to crew concerns about the deicing procedure, led to a number of reforms in pilot-training regulations. Partial blame was placed on the young, inexperienced flight crew, who had a combined age of only 65 and had begun their careers as commercial pilots less than five years earlier. Typical of upstart, low-cost carriers, Air Florida frequently hired youthful pilots who worked for less money than veterans, and were for the most part seeking to gain flight experience prior to joining a major airline. It became a widely used case study for both air crews and rescue workers.

==In popular culture==

The Discovery Channel Canada/National Geographic TV series &quot;Mayday&quot; (also called &quot;Air Crash Investigation&quot; or &quot;Air Emergency&quot;) dramatized the accident in an episode titled &quot;Disaster on the Potomac&quot; (aired in some countries as &quot;Tragedy on the Potomac&quot;).

The PBS series &quot;Nova&quot; featured the crash in season 2, episode 2, of the TV show &quot;Why Planes Crash&quot;, in an episode called &quot;Brush With Death&quot;.

The National Geographic Channel series &quot;Seconds From Disaster&quot; also dramatized the accident entitled &quot;Plane Crash in the Potomac&quot;.

&quot;Aircrash Confidential &quot;also covered the accident in one of their episodes.

The crash was also dramatized in the 1984 made-for-TV movie &quot;Flight 90: Disaster on the Potomac&quot;.

&quot;Critical Rescue&quot; has also dedicated an entire episode to the heroes of the disaster.

The flight has also been shown on the show &quot;When Weather Changed History&quot; on US-based The Weather Channel.

The National Law Enforcement Museum, which opened in Washington, DC, in 2018, has footage of the crash on display along with interviews of survivors and other first-hand accounts. The display includes the U.S. Park Police helicopter involved in the rescue of Flight 90&#x27;s survivors.

Arland D Williams, Jr., is commemorated in Sara Hickman&#x27;s song &quot;Last Man in the Water&quot;.

<text>Panamax and New Panamax (or Neopanamax) are terms for the size limits for ships travelling through the Panama Canal. The limits and requirements are published by the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) in a publication titled &quot;Vessel Requirements&quot;. These requirements also describe topics like exceptional dry seasonal limits, propulsion, communications, and detailed ship design.

The allowable size is limited by the width and length of the available lock chambers, by the depth of water in the canal, and by the height of the Bridge of the Americas since that bridge&#x27;s construction, along with the clearance under the Atlantic and Centennial Bridges since their constructions in 2019 and 2004 respectively. These dimensions give clear parameters for ships destined to traverse the Panama Canal and have influenced the design of cargo ships, naval vessels, and passenger ships.

Panamax specifications have been in effect since the opening of the canal in 1914. In 2009, the ACP published the &quot;New Panamax&quot; specification, which came into effect when the canal&#x27;s third set of locks, larger than the original two, opened on 26 June 2016. Ships that do not fall within the Panamax-sizes are called &quot;post-Panamax&quot; or &quot;super-Panamax&quot;.

The increasing prevalence of vessels of the maximum size is a problem for the canal, as a Panamax ship is a tight fit that requires precise control of the vessel in the locks, possibly resulting in longer lock time, and requiring that these ships transit in daylight. Because the largest ships traveling in opposite directions cannot pass safely within the Culebra Cut, the canal effectively operates an alternating one-way system for these ships.

==Ship dimensions==

Panamax is determined principally by the dimensions of the canal&#x27;s original lock chambers, each of which is wide, long, and deep. The usable length of each lock chamber is . The available water depth in the lock chambers varies, but the shallowest depth is at the south sill of the Pedro Miguel Locks and is at a Miraflores Lake level of . The clearances under the Bridge of the Americas at Balboa, the Centennial Bridge near the Culebra Cut, and the Atlantic Bridge in Colon, are the three limiting factors on a vessel&#x27;s overall height for both Panamax and Neopanamax ships; the exact figure depends on the water level.

The maximum dimensions allowed for a ship transiting the canal using the original locks and the new locks (New Panamax) are:

===Length===
Overall (including protrusions): . Exceptions:

* Container ship and passenger ship: 
* Tug-barge combination, rigidly connected: overall
* Other non-self-propelled vessels-tug combination: overall;

New Panamax increases the allowable length to .

===Width (beam)===
Width over outer surface of the shell plating: . General exception: , when draft is less than in tropical fresh water.

New Panamax originally allowed a width of . This was expanded to during June 2018.

===Draft===
The maximum allowable draft is in tropical freshwater (TFW). The name and definition of TFW is created by ACP using the freshwater Lake Gatún as a reference. The salinity and temperature of water affect its density, and hence how deep a ship will float in the water. The lake&#x27;s water has a density of 995.4 kg/m3, at . The physical limit is set by the lower (seaside) entrance of the Pedro Miguel locks. When the water level in Lake Gatún is low during an exceptionally dry season, the maximum permitted draft may be reduced. Such a restriction is published three weeks in advance, so ship loading plans can take appropriate measures.

New Panamax increases allowable draft to ; however, due to low rainfall, the Canal Authority limited draft to 43 feet when the new locks opened in June 2016, increasing it to 44 feet (13.41 meters) in August, &quot;based on the current level of Gatun Lake and the weather forecast for the following weeks.&quot;

===Height===
Vessel height is limited to measured from the waterline to the vessel&#x27;s highest point; the limit also pertains to New Panamax in order to pass under the Bridge of the Americas at Balboa harbor. Exception: when passage at low water (MLWS) at Balboa is possible.

===Cargo capacity===
A Panamax cargo ship would typically have a DWT of 65,000–80,000 tonnes, but its maximum cargo would be about 52,500 tonnes during a transit due to draft limitations in the canal. New Panamax ships can carry 120,000 DWT. Panamax container ships can carry , with for New Panamax vessels.

===Records===
The longest ship ever to transit the original locks was &quot;San Juan Prospector&quot;, now &quot;Marcona Prospector&quot;, an ore-bulk-oil carrier that is long, with a beam of . The widest ships to transit are the four battleships of both the and battleships, which have a maximum beam of , leaving less than margin of error between the ships and the walls of the locks.

===Routes===
Major Panamax bulk trade routes include Brazil to China, Australia to China, U.S. to China, China to China, and Australia to India.

==Expansion==

As early as the 1930s, new locks were proposed for the Panama Canal to ease congestion and to allow larger ships to pass. The project was abandoned in 1942.

On October 22, 2006, the Panama Canal Authority (with the support of the Electoral Tribunal) held a referendum for Panamanian citizens to vote on the Panama Canal expansion project. The expansion was approved by a wide margin, with support from about 78% of voters. Construction began in 2007, and after several delays, the new locks opened for commercial traffic on 26 June 2016.

===Neopanamax===
Construction of another set of larger locks led to the creation of the &quot;Neopanamax&quot; or &quot;New Panamax&quot; ship classification, based on the new locks&#x27; dimensions of in length, in beam, and in depth. Naval architects and civil engineers began taking into account these dimensions for container ships. With the new locks, the Panama Canal is able to handle vessels with overall length of 366 m (1201 feet), 49 meters beam (increased by the Canal Authority effective 1 June 2018 to 51.25 meters, to accommodate ships with 20 rows of containers) and 15.2 meters draft, and cargo capacity up to ; previously, it could only handle vessels up to about . The Neopanamax standard accommodates ships up to 120,000 DWT.

===Impact on world ports===
====United States====

Several ports, including the ports of New York and New Jersey, Norfolk, and Baltimore, all on the East Coast of the United States, have already increased their depth to at least to accommodate New Panamax ships; in 2015 the Port of Miami achieved the same in a project known as the &quot;Deep Dredge&quot; and is the closest deep-water port to the Panama Canal in the US. In 2017, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey raised the clearance of the Bayonne Bridge to 215 feet (66 m), at a cost of $1.7 billion, to allow New Panamax ships to reach container port facilities at Port Newark–Elizabeth Marine Terminal. Previously, only GCT Bayonne, Global Container, could handle the New Panamax ships.

As of April 2012, a controversy between Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, over limited federal funding for dredging/deepening projects—including both state and federal lawsuits filed by environmental groups in both states opposing the techniques planned to be used in dredging the Savannah River—also revolves around attracting the business of carriers whose fleets include New Panamax vessels. Jacksonville, Florida, is pursuing its &quot;Mile Point&quot; project with the prospect of deepening the St. John&#x27;s River in anticipation of Post-Panamax traffic; Mobile, Alabama, has completed the deepening of its harbor to for the same reason; and other ports seem likely to follow suit.

The American conservative think tanks The Heritage Foundation and Cato Institute have cited the Foreign Dredge Act of 1906 as a factor in constraining American dredging capacity for expanding ports to accommodate post-Panamax ships.

====United Kingdom and Canada====
Liverpool built a new container terminal, Liverpool2, where ships berth in the tidal river rather than in the enclosed docks, coinciding with the opening of the widened Panama Canal locks. In Halifax, Canada, a major expansion of the South End Container Terminal was completed in 2012, extending the pier and increasing the berth depth from .

====Mexico====
The port of Salina Cruz, in the state of Oaxaca, Mexico, has been expanded to obtain the capacity to receive Post Panamax ships. This expansion forms part of the Interoceanic Corridor of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (CIIT) project which the Mexican government has been executing since 2019. This expansion, which began in January 2022, consists of the creation of a new port with an access depth of , a long breakwater and a wide mouth. This new port is planned to be inaugurated on February 26, 2024. Between January 2020 and June 30, 2023, the government spent over 3.8 billion Mexican pesos to this expansion. The project&#x27;s goal is to create a land-based route alternative to the Panama Canal, which has faced complications in recent years due to intense droughts. However, the port of Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, is still deep, but it has nonetheless been subjected to expansion and modernization to efficiently transport cargo.

===Impact on existing ships===
Due to the expansion, demand for &#x27;Old Panamax&#x27; ships has plummeted, resulting in ships being traded at scrap value. Some ships only seven years old have been sold for scrap, and others have been widened.

==Comparison of sizes==

==Post-Panamax and Post-Neopanamax ships==
&quot;Post-Panamax&quot; or &quot;over-Panamax&quot; denote ships larger than Panamax that do not fit in the original canal locks, such as supertankers and the largest modern container and passenger ships. The first post-Panamax ship was the RMS &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, launched in 1934, built with a 118-foot beam as she was intended solely for North Atlantic passenger runs. When she was moved to Long Beach, California, as a tourist attraction in 1967, a lengthy voyage around Cape Horn was necessary. The first post-Panamax warships were the Japanese &quot;Yamato&quot;-class battleships, launched in 1940. Until World War II, the United States Navy required that all of their warships be capable of transiting the Panama Canal. The first US Navy warship design to exceed Panamax limits was the , designed circa 1940 but never built. The limit was specifically removed by the Secretary of the Navy on 12 February 1940, with the (never-realized) prospect of a new set of 140-foot wide locks to be built for the Canal. The s were designed with a folding deck-edge elevator to meet Panamax limits; the limit did not apply to subsequent US aircraft carriers.
