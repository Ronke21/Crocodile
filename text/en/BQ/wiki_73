<text>Nusantara is the Indonesian name for the region spanning the Indonesian Archipelago and the Malay Peninsula. It is an Old Javanese term that literally means &quot;outer islands&quot;. In Indonesia, it is generally taken to mean the Indonesian Archipelago. Outside of Indonesia, the term has been adopted to refer to the Malay Archipelago.

The word Nusantara is taken from an oath by Gajah Mada in 1336, as written in the Old Javanese &quot;Pararaton&quot;. Gajah Mada was a powerful military leader and prime minister of Majapahit credited with bringing the empire to its peak of glory. Gajah Mada delivered an oath called &quot;Sumpah Palapa&quot;, in which he vowed not to eat any food containing spices until he had conquered all of Nusantara under the glory of Majapahit.

The concept of Nusantara as a unified region was not invented by Gajah Mada in 1336. The term Nusantara was first used by Kertanegara of Singhasari in Mula Malurung inscription dated 1255. Furthermore, in 1275, the term &quot;Cakravala Mandala Dvipantara&quot; was used by him to describe the aspiration of united Southeast Asian archipelago under Singhasari and marked the beginning of his efforts to achieve it. Dvipantara is a Sanskrit word for the &quot;islands in between&quot;, making it a synonym to Nusantara as both &quot;dvipa&quot; and &quot;nusa&quot; mean &quot;island&quot;. Kertanegara envisioned the union of Southeast Asian maritime kingdoms and polities under Singhasari as a bulwark against the rise of the expansionist Mongol-led Yuan dynasty of China.

In a wider sense, Nusantara in modern language usage includes Austronesian-related cultural and linguistic lands, namely, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Southern Thailand, the Philippines, Brunei, East Timor and Taiwan, while excluding Papua New Guinea.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;Nusantara&quot; derives from a combined two words of Austronesian and Sanskrit origin, the word &quot;nūsa&quot; (&quot;see also &quot;) meaning &quot;island&quot; in Old Javanese, is ultimately derived from the Proto-Malayo-Polynesian word &quot;*nusa&quot; with the same meaning, and the word &quot;antara&quot; is a Javanese loanword borrowed from Sanskrit अन्तरा (&quot;antarā&quot;) meaning &quot;between&quot; or &quot;in the middle&quot;, thus creating a compound word of &quot;nūsa&quot; (“island”) + &quot;antara&quot; (“interval, interspace; other, another, different”) and together it means &quot; the outer islands&quot; as mentioned in the 14th century Old Javanese manuscript Pararaton and Nagarakretagama.

==Ancient concepts==


===Etymology===
&quot;Nusantara&quot; is an Old Javanese word which appears in the &quot;Pararaton&quot; manuscript. In Javanese, &quot;Nusantara&quot; is derived and &quot;antara&quot;, &#x27;between&#x27;. It means &quot;outer islands&quot; or &quot;other islands&quot; (in the sense of &quot;islands beyond Java in between the Indian and Pacific Oceans&quot;), referring to the islands outside of Java under hegemony of the Majapahit Empire. The term is commonly erroneously translated as &quot;archipelago&quot; in modern times. Based on the Majapahit concept of state, the monarch had power over three areas:

# Negara Agung, or the Grand State — the core realm of the kingdom where Majapahit formed before becoming an empire. This included the capital city and the surrounding areas where the king effectively exercised his government: the area in and around royal capital of Trowulan, port of Canggu and sections of Brantas River valley near the capital, as well as the mountainous areas south and southeast of the capital, all the way to the Pananggungan and Arjuno-Welirang peaks. The Brantas river valley corridor, connecting the Majapahit Trowulan area to Canggu and the estuarine areas in Kahuripan (Sidoarjo) and Hujung Galuh (Surabaya), is also considered to be part of &quot;Negara Agung&quot;.
# Mancanegara, the areas surrounding &quot;Negara Agung&quot; — this traditionally referred to the Majapahit provinces of East and Central Java ruled by the &quot;Bhres&quot; (dukes), the king&#x27;s close relatives. This included the rest of Java as well as Madura and Bali. These areas were directly influenced by Majapahit court culture and obliged to pay annual tributes; their rulers might have been directly related to, allied with, and/or intermarried with the Majapahit royal family. Majapahit officials and officers were stationed in these places to regulate their foreign trade activities and collect taxes, but beyond this &quot;mancanegara&quot; provinces enjoyed substantial autonomy in internal affairs. In later periods, overseas provinces which had adopted Javanese culture or possessed significant trading importance were also considered &quot;mancanegara&quot;. The ruler of these provinces was either a willing vassal of the Majapahit king or a regent appointed by the king to rule the region. These realms included Dharmasraya, Pagaruyung, Lampung and Palembang in Sumatra.
# Nusantara, areas which did not reflect Javanese culture, but were included as colonies which had to pay annual tribute. This included the vassal kingdoms and colonies in the Malay Peninsula, Borneo, the Lesser Sunda Islands, Sulawesi, Maluku, New Guinea, and the Sulu Archipelago. These regions enjoyed substantial autonomy and internal freedom, and Majapahit officials and military officers were not necessarily stationed there; however, any challenges to Majapahit oversight might have drawn a severe response.

The word Nusantara was not only used by the Javanese and did not disappear after the fall of Majapahit. This word can be found in Malay Annals, a classic Malay literature written as early as 1612, but it remained known even in the 1808 manuscript:

&quot;Terlalu sekali besar kerajaan Baginda (Majapahit) pada zaman itu, segala seluruh Jawa semuanya dalam hukum Baginda, dan segala raja-raja Nusantarapun setengah sudah ta-luk kepada baginda&quot;.&lt;br&gt;Very big was the kingdom of &quot;Baginda&quot; (the king of Majapahit) at that time, all of Java was under &quot;Baginda&quot;&#x27;s law, and half of the kings of the Nusantara archipelago were submissive to &quot;Baginda&quot;.

==Nusantara concept in the 20th century==

In 1920, Ernest Francois Eugene Douwes Dekker (1879–1950), also known as Setiabudi, proposed &quot;Nusantara&quot; as a name for the independent country of Indonesia which did not contain any words etymologically related to the name of India or the Indies. This is the first instance of the term &quot;Nusantara&quot; appearing after it had been written into Pararaton manuscript.

The definition of Nusantara introduced by Setiabudi is different from the 14th-century definition of the term. During the Majapahit era, Nusantara described vassal areas that had been conquered. Setiabudi defined Nusantara as all the Indonesian regions from Sabang to Merauke.

==Modern usage==
===Indonesia===
Nowadays, in Indonesian, Nusantara is synonymous with either the Indonesian Archipelago or the national territory of Indonesia. In this sense, the term Nusantara excludes Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, East Timor, and the Philippines. In 1967, it transformed into the concept of &quot;Wawasan Nusantara&quot;, or &quot;archipelagic outlook,&quot; which regards the archipelagic realm of Indonesia (the islands and seas within/surrounding the country) as a single unity of several aspects, mainly socio-cultural, linguistic, political, economic, security-driven and defensive unity.

Nusantara is also the name of the future capital of Indonesia.

===Outside Indonesia===
In Brunei, Malaysia and Singapore, the term is generally used to refer to the Malay Archipelago or the Malay realm () which includes those countries.

In a more scholarly manner without national borders, Nusantara in a modern language usage &quot;refers to the sphere of influence of the Austronesian-related cultural and linguistic islands that comprise Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the southernmost part of Thailand, the Philippines, Brunei, East Timor and perhaps even Taiwan, but it does not involve the areas of Papua New Guinea.&quot;

<doc id="503251" wikidata="Q3180068" url="?curid=503251" title="Orange Line (CTA)">
<text>The Orange Line is a rapid transit line in Chicago, Illinois, operated by the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) as part of the Chicago &quot;L&quot; system. It is approximately long and runs on elevated and at grade tracks and serves the Southwest Side, running from the Loop to Midway International Airport. As of 2023, an average of 16,979 riders board Orange Line trains on weekdays.

==Route==

The Orange Line begins in an open cut at a station on the east side of Midway International Airport. From here, the line rises to an elevated viaduct at 55th Street and continues northeast towards the city on railroad right-of-way. Near the intersection of 49th Street and Lawndale Avenue, the line turns east along a CSX Transportation right-of-way to a point east of Western Boulevard, then curves north and northwest on embankment structure along CSX right-of-way to Western Boulevard and Pershing Road.

From here, the line rises on elevated structure again and makes a curve to cross Archer Avenue, the CSX tracks and Western Boulevard before descending onto the Illinois Central Railroad (CN) right-of-way immediately east of Western Boulevard. Entering the IC right-of-way, the line again changes from elevated structure to surface level. The line continues on surface level to Ashland Avenue where it crosses a bridge over Bubbly Creek, a fork of the South Branch of the Chicago River. At this point, the line enters the joint Illinois Central and Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe (BNSF) Railroad right-of-way continuing on embankment to Canal Street.

There the line again transitions to the elevated structure to bridge Canal Street, Cermak Road and the Chicago &amp; Western Indiana Railroad tracks then curves east to run along the south side of 18th Street, crossing over the Red Line and the Rock Island District tracks near Wentworth Avenue, before joining the South Side Elevated at a flying junction between 16th and 17th Streets. The ballasted track ends and the timber deck begins here. Orange Line trains share the tracks with the Green Line operating from this junction to Tower 12 at the southeast corner of the Loop. Orange Line trains operate clockwise around the inner loop – via Van Buren Street, Wells Street, Lake Street and Wabash Avenue – before returning to Midway.

Along the Orange Line&#x27;s main route there are seven stations. An eighth station is located at Roosevelt/Wabash on the South Side Elevated which Orange Line trains share with Green Line trains. A passenger tunnel connects this station with the Roosevelt/State subway station on the Red Line.

A downtown superstation was proposed to provide express service from the Loop to O&#x27;Hare and Midway airports, but the project was canceled during the excavation process due to significant cost overruns.

==Operating hours and headways==
The Orange Line operates between Midway and the Loop weekdays from 3:30 a.m. to 1:25 a.m., Saturdays from 4 a.m. to 1:30 a.m. and Sundays from 4:30 a.m. to 1:25 a.m. On weekdays, headways consists of 10 tph (trains per hour) during rush hour, 8 tph during midday and 5 tph at night. Saturday service consists 5–8 tph during the day, then 3–4 tph during late night hours. Sunday service runs 5 tph during the day, then 3–4 tph at night.


==Rolling stock==
The Orange Line is operated with 2600-series cars. From November 8, 2012, to October 31, 2014, some 2400-series railcars were assigned to the line. From the opening of the route to October 2018, 3200-series railcars were assigned to the line. Trains operate using eight cars during weekday rush hours and four cars during other times on weekdays and all day on weekends except for special events when eight cars may be required.

Beginning in June 2014, CTA began to transfer some 2600-series cars to the line as an interim replacement for its 2400-series cars. The first batch of the Orange Line&#x27;s 2600-series cars are reassignments from the Blue Line. The lost capacity on the Blue Line was made up from reassignment of newer 2600-series cars from the Red Line, as they were displaced by the new Bombardier-built 5000-series cars on the Red Line. The second batch of 2600-series cars are reassignments from the Red Line as more 5000-series cars were delivered and assigned to the Red Line, replacing the Orange Line&#x27;s remaining 2400-series cars until the Red Line was fully equipped with the 5000-series cars. The last 2400-series cars were retired from service in October 2014. 

After the Red Line was fully equipped with the 5000-series cars, the CTA planned on replacing the Orange Line&#x27;s 2600-series cars with the 5000-series cars, leaving only the Blue and Brown Lines as the only lines not to operate the 5000-series cars. However, the assignment of 5000-series cars to the Orange Line is now unlikely, since delivery of all 5000-series cars is complete and are completely assigned to all other lines except for the Blue and Brown Lines, thus the assignment of 2600-series cars to the Orange Line is now a permanent assignment until the delivery of the new 7000-series cars.

Beginning September 2018, CTA began to transfer the Orange Line&#x27;s 3200-series cars to the Blue Line. As of October 2018, the 3200-series cars no longer operate on the Orange Line.

==History==

The Orange Line opened for service on October 31, 1993, and was the first all-new service in Chicago since the Dan Ryan Line opened in September 1969 and the first extension to the CTA system since the extension of the Blue Line to O&#x27;Hare International Airport in September 1984. But its planning dates back to the late 1930s when the City of Chicago proposed a high speed subway extension along Wells-Archer-Cicero between the Loop and 63rd Street and Cicero Avenue near Midway (then called Chicago&#x27;s Municipal Airport). It would be another four decades before Chicago transit planners became serious about providing rapid transit service to this area of the city.

In 1979, the City began the Southwest Transit Project, which proposed extending the CTA &#x27;L&#x27; system to the Southwest Side of Chicago over existing railroad rights-of-way and newer elevated connections along the very busy Archer-49th-Cicero Corridor from the Loop to its originally planned terminus at the Ford City Mall. Funding for the project was made possible from Interstate Highway Transfer monies saved after the city decided to cancel the high priced and controversial Crosstown Expressway and Franklin Street subway projects. Federal funding for the project was secured by U.S. Representative William Lipinski as a favor from then-President Ronald Reagan, who wanted to thank Lipinski for his vote to provide aid to the Nicaraguan contras.

In 1987, construction of the $500 million transit line began and continued until fall 1993. When the Midway Line opened, the CTA decided to adopt a color-coded naming system for the rapid transit network (like Boston, Washington, D.C., and Cleveland) and named it the Orange Line.

==Former proposed extension==
Printed rollsigns on some CTA rail cars include an entry for &quot;Ford City.&quot; The Ford City Mall is about two miles (3 km) south of Midway Airport, and it was originally planned to be the line&#x27;s terminal. Because there was no funding available, the city decided to end the line at Midway Airport.

The CTA analyzed the cost of an Orange Line extension to Ford City in 2008 and determined that the project would cost approximately $200 million. Community meetings were held in neighborhoods surrounding Midway and Ford City to judge the level of public support for the extension.

The four corridors being studied for the Orange Line extension include alignments along Cicero Avenue, Pulaski Road, and a combination of the Belt Railway and either Cicero or Kostner Avenues. The corridors selected for further study are Cicero Ave (Bus Rapid Transit) and Belt/Cicero or Belt/Kostner (Heavy Rail Transit). In April 2009, the Cicero Avenue/Belt Railway corridor was chosen as the most viable option and advanced in the Alternatives Analysis process. By December 2009, the CTA had identified the Locally Preferred Alternative (LPA) as the Belt/Cicero route. According to a CTA report,

The CTA planned to prepare a draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and complete preliminary engineering. However, the extension was canceled.

==Station listing==


After stopping at Adams/Wabash, Orange Line trains return to Roosevelt, then make all stops back to Midway.

<text>An exotoxin is a toxin secreted by bacteria. An exotoxin can cause damage to the host by destroying cells or disrupting normal cellular metabolism. They are highly potent and can cause major damage to the host. Exotoxins may be secreted, or, similar to endotoxins, may be released during lysis of the cell. Gram negative pathogens may secrete outer membrane vesicles containing lipopolysaccharide endotoxin and some virulence proteins in the bounding membrane along with some other toxins as intra-vesicular contents, thus adding a previously unforeseen dimension to the well-known eukaryote process of membrane vesicle trafficking, which is quite active at the host–pathogen interface.

They may exert their effect locally or produce systemic effects. Well-known exotoxins include: botulinum toxin produced by &quot;Clostridium botulinum&quot;; &quot;Corynebacterium diphtheriae&quot; toxin, produced during life-threatening symptoms of diphtheria; tetanospasmin produced by &quot;Clostridium tetani&quot;. The toxic properties of most exotoxins can be inactivated by heat or chemical treatment to produce a toxoid. These retain their antigenic specificity and can be used to produce antitoxins and, in the case of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, are used as vaccines.

Exotoxins are susceptible to antibodies produced by the immune system, but some exotoxins are so toxic that they may be fatal to the host before the immune system has a chance to mount defenses against them. In such cases, antitoxin, anti-serum containing antibodies, can sometimes be injected to provide passive immunity.

== Types ==

Many exotoxins have been categorized. This classification, while fairly exhaustive, is not the only system used. Other systems for classifying or identifying toxins include:

* By organism generating the toxin
* By organism susceptible to the toxin
* By secretion system used to release the toxin (for example, toxic effectors of type VI secretion system)
* By tissue target type susceptible to the toxin (neurotoxins affect the nervous system, cardiotoxins affect the heart, etc.)
* By structure (for example, AB5 toxin)
* By domain architecture of the toxin (for example, polymorphic toxins)
* By the ability of the toxin to endure in hostile environments, such as heat, dryness, radiation, or salinity. In this context, &quot;labile&quot; implies susceptibility, and &quot;stable&quot; implies a lack of susceptibility.
* By a letter, such as &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, or &quot;C&quot;, to communicate the order in which they were identified.

The same exotoxin may have different names, depending on the field of research.

=== Type I: cell surface-active ===

Type I toxins bind to a receptor on the cell surface and stimulate intracellular signaling pathways. Two examples are described below.

==== Superantigens ====

Superantigens are produced by several bacteria. The best-characterized superantigens are those produced by the strains of &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; and &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot; that cause toxic shock syndrome. Superantigens bridge the MHC class II protein on antigen-presenting cells with the T-cell receptor on the surface of T cells with a particular Vβ chain. As a consequence, up to 50% of all T cells are activated, leading to massive secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, which produce the symptoms of toxic shock.

==== Heat-stable enterotoxins ====

Some strains of &quot;E. coli&quot; produce heat-stable enterotoxins (ST), which are small peptides that are able to withstand heat treatment at 100 °C. Different STs recognize distinct receptors on the cell surface and thereby affect different intracellular signaling pathways. For example, STa enterotoxins bind and activate membrane-bound guanylate cyclase, which leads to the intracellular accumulation of cyclic GMP and downstream effects on several signaling pathways. These events lead to the loss of electrolytes and water from intestinal cells.

=== Type II: membrane damaging ===

Membrane-damaging toxins exhibit hemolysin or cytolysin activity &quot;in vitro&quot;. However, induction of cell lysis may not be the primary function of the toxins during infection. At low concentrations of toxin, more subtle effects such as modulation of host cell signal transduction may be observed in the absence of cell lysis. Membrane-damaging toxins can be divided into two categories, the channel-forming toxins and toxins that function as enzymes that act on the membrane.

==== Channel-forming toxins ====

Most channel-forming toxins, which form pores in the target cell membrane, can be classified into two families: the cholesterol-dependent toxins and the RTX toxins.

* Cholesterol-dependent cytolysins

Formation of pores by cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDC) requires the presence of cholesterol in the target cell. The size of the pores formed by members of this family is extremely large: 25-30 nm in diameter. All CDCs are secreted by the type II secretion system; the exception is pneumolysin, which is released from the cytoplasm of &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; when the bacteria lyse.

The CDCs &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; Pneumolysin, &quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot; perfringolysin O, and &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot; listeriolysin O cause specific modifications of histones in the host cell nucleus, resulting in down-regulation of several genes that encode proteins involved in the inflammatory response. Histone modification does not involve the pore-forming activity of the CDCs.

* RTX toxins

RTX toxins can be identified by the presence of a specific tandemly repeated nine-amino acid residue sequence in the protein. The prototype member of the RTX toxin family is haemolysin A (HlyA) of &quot;E. coli&quot;. RTX is also found in &quot;Legionella pneumophila&quot;.

==== Enzymatically active toxins ====

One example is the α toxin of &quot;C. perfringens&quot;, which causes gas gangrene; α toxin has phospholipase activity.

=== Type III: intracellular ===
Type III exotoxins can be classified by their mode of entry into the cell, or by their mechanism once inside.

==== By mode of entry ====
Intracellular toxins must be able to gain access to the cytoplasm of the target cell to exert their effects.

* Some bacteria deliver toxins directly from their cytoplasm to the cytoplasm of the target cell through a needle-like structure. The effector proteins injected by the type III secretion apparatus of &quot;Yersinia&quot; into target cells are one example.
* Another group of intracellular toxins is the AB toxins. The &#x27;B&#x27;-subunit (binding&quot;) attaches to target regions on cell membranes, the &#x27;A&#x27;-subunit (active&quot;) enters through the membrane and possesses enzymatic function that affects internal cellular bio-mechanisms. A common example of this A-subunit activity is called ADP-ribosylation in which the A-subunit catalyzes the addition of an ADP-ribose group onto specific residues on a protein. The structure of these toxins allows for the development of specific vaccines and treatments. Certain compounds can be attached to the B unit, which is not, in general, harmful, which the body learns to recognize, and which elicits an immune response. This allows the body to detect the harmful toxin if it is encountered later, and to eliminate it before it can cause harm to the host. Toxins of this type include cholera toxin, pertussis toxin, Shiga toxin and heat-labile enterotoxin from &quot;E. coli&quot;.

==== By mechanism ====

Once in the cell, many of the exotoxins act at the eukaryotic ribosomes (especially 60S), as protein synthesis inhibitors. (Ribosome structure is one of the most important differences between eukaryotes and prokaryotes, and, in a sense, these exotoxins are the bacterial equivalent of antibiotics such as clindamycin.)

* Some exotoxins act directly at the ribosome to inhibit protein synthesis. An example is Shiga toxin.
* Other toxins act at elongation factor-2. In the case of the diphtheria toxin, EF2 is ADP-ribosylated and becomes unable to participate in protein elongation, and, so, the cell dies. Pseudomonas exotoxin has a similar action.

Other intracellular toxins do not directly inhibit protein synthesis.
* For example, Cholera toxin ADP-ribosylates, thereby activating tissue adenylate cyclase to increase the concentration of cAMP, which causes the movement of massive amounts of fluid and electrolytes from the lining of the small intestine and results in life-threatening diarrhea.
* Another example is Pertussis toxin.

=== Extracellular matrix damage ===

These &quot;toxins&quot; allow the further spread of bacteria and, as a consequence, deeper tissue infections. Examples are hyaluronidase and collagenase. These molecules, however, are enzymes that are secreted by a variety of organisms and are not usually considered toxins. They are often referred to as virulence factors, since they allow the organisms to move deeper into the hosts tissues.

== Medical applications ==

=== Vaccinations ===
Exotoxins have been used to produce vaccines. This process involves inactivating the toxin, creating a toxoid that does not induce toxin-related illness and is well tolerated. A widely used toxoid vaccine is the DPT vaccine, which is usually administered in multiple doses throughout childhood with adjuvants and boosters for long-term immunity. DPT vaccine protects against pertussis, tetanus and diphtheria infections, caused by the exotoxin-producing &quot;Bordetella pertussis&quot;, &quot;Clostridium tetani&quot; and &quot;Corynebacterium diphtheriae&quot; respectively. Vaccination with the toxoids generates antibodies against the exotoxins, forming immunological memory as protection against subsequent infections. The DPT vaccination may cause adverse side effects, such as swelling, redness and fever, and is contraindicated in some populations. Effective vaccination schedules have reduced rates of mortality linked to pertussis, tetanus and diphtheria but formal controlled trials to test the efficacy of the vaccine have not been conducted. Additionally, pertussis persists endemically and is one of the most common causes of vaccine-preventable deaths.

=== Cancer treatment ===
As exotoxins are highly potent, there has been development in their application to cancer treatment. Cancer cells can be eliminated without destroying normal cells like in chemotherapy or radiation by attaching an antibody or receptor ligand to the exotoxin, creating a recombinant toxin that is targeted to certain cells. The cancer cell is killed once the toxin is internalized; for example, Pseudomonas exotoxin disrupts protein synthesis after cellular uptake. Multiple versions of recombinant exotoxin A, secreted by &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;, have entered clinical trials against tumor growth but have yet to be approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A recombinant diphtheria exotoxin has been approved by the FDA for treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, an immune system cancer. Further testing to improve clinical efficacy of treatment using recombinant exotoxins continues.

<text>The Blue Line is a light rail line in the system of mass transit in Dallas, Texas (USA), operated by the Dallas Area Rapid Transit system. Along with the , it is one of the original modern rail lines in Dallas.

==Route==
The southern terminus of the line is currently at UNT Dallas in south Dallas at University Hills Blvd. just south of Camp Wisdom Rd. The line runs north, under the Dallas Convention Center and through downtown Dallas. After leaving Mockingbird, the line diverts to the northeast towards White Rock Lake. The line then goes north and then east into Garland, finally ending in Rowlett.

==History==
The rail line was part of the initial launch of DART&#x27;s light rail service in 1996. At the time, the line only ran from Illinois to Pearl in the northeast corner of downtown. In May 1997, the Blue Line was extended south to Ledbetter and was extended along the Red Line to Mockingbird in September 1999, in preparation for the future extension to Garland.

On September 24, 2001, the Blue Line extended to White Rock, just northwest of White Rock Lake. On May 6, 2002, the Blue Line was extended to the LBJ/Skillman, just beyond LBJ Freeway (Interstate 635). It was extended to Downtown Garland on November 18, 2002, and to its current northern terminus, Downtown Rowlett, on December 3, 2012.

DART&#x27;s 2030 Transit System Plan, approved in October 2006, calls for the Blue Line to be extended south beyond Ledbetter to the University of North Texas at Dallas, as well as a branch along Bonnie View road to Interstate 20 and the SouthPort Intermodal Terminal. The plan also includes a new Lake Highlands station near Skillman Street and Walnut Hill Lane, which opened as DART&#x27;s second infill station in December 2010.

In October 2014, construction began for a 2.6-mile extension south from Ledbetter station to the University of North Texas at Dallas, adding two new stations to the line: Camp Wisdom and UNT Dallas. The extension opened for service on October 24, 2016.

===Future plans===
The D2 Subway is planned to be implemented in 2028 and will reroute the Blue Line off of the downtown transit corridor and over the former Green Line&#x27;s western segment to terminate at North Carrollton/Frankford station.

<doc id="503271" wikidata="Q887629" url="?curid=503271" title="King of Tyre">
<text>The King of Tyre was the ruler of Tyre, the ancient Phoenician city in what is now Lebanon. The traditional list of 12 kings, with reigns dated to 990–785 BC, is derived from the lost history of Menander of Ephesus as quoted by Josephus in &quot;Against Apion&quot; I. 116–127. Josephus asserts that Menander had drawn his list from the chronicles of Tyre itself. Menander-Josephus also contains a list of 9 kings and judges, with reigns dated to 591–532 BC in Against Apion I. 154–160.

==Ancient Tyrian rulers based on Hellenic mythology==

==Late Bronze Age rulers==
==Kings of the Sidonians (with Tyre as capital), 990–785 BC==

The dates for the reconstruction of Menander&#x27;s Tyrian king list from Abibaal through Pygmalion are established in three places by three independent sources: a Biblical synchronism (Hiram&#x27;s assistance to Solomon in building the Temple, from 967 BC onwards), an Assyrian record (tribute of Baal-Eser II/Balazeros II to Shalmaneser III in 841 BC), and a Roman historian (Pompeius Trogus, who placed the founding of Carthage or Dido&#x27;s flight from her brother Pygmalion in the latter&#x27;s seventh year of reign, in 825 BC, 72 years before the founding of Rome).

==Assyrian ascendancy: 8th and 7th centuries BC==
The Neo-Assyrian Empire established its control over the area and ruled through vassals who are named in Assyrian records.
==Post-Assyrian period==
Menander&#x27;s Tyrian king list also described the period from Ithobaal III through Hiram III. Tyre regained independence with Assyria&#x27;s demise, although Egypt controlled Tyre during some of the time afterwards. Eventually, Tyre fell under the control of the Neo-Babylonian Empire.

===Shoftim of Tyre===
In the 560s the monarchy was overthrown, and an oligarchic government established, headed by &quot;judges&quot; or &quot;shoftim&quot; (cf. Carthage). The monarchy was restored with the ascension of Hiram III to the throne. Josephus mentions these judges in his treatise &quot;Against Apion&quot; (Book I, §21), and which last judge (Hiram III) is said to have been contemporary with Cyrus the Great. According to Josephus, Hiram&#x27;s reign extended to the fourteenth year of Cyrus&#x27;, ascension to power in Babylon. Cyrus took control of Babylon on October 29, 539, therefore Hiram III&#x27;s rule spanned from 551 to 532 BC.

==Under Persian control 539–411 BC==
*Mattan IV fl. c. 490–480
*Boulomenus fl. c. 450
*Abdemon c.420–411 BC. He ruled Salamis, in Cyprus.

==Under control of Cypriot Salamis 411–374 BC==
*Evagoras of Salamis, Cyprus. He united Cyprus under his rule and achieved independence from the Persian Empire.

==Under Persian control 374–332 BC==
*Eugoras fl. 340s
*Azemilcus c.340–332 BC. He was king during the siege by Alexander the Great.

==Under the Greeks and Romans==
After Alexander the Great conquered Tyre in 332 BC, the city alternated between Seleucid (Syrian Greek) and Ptolemaic (Egyptian Greek) rule. Phoenicia came under the rule of the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC.

*Marion (c. 42 BC) was the Roman tyrant of Tyre.

<text>Algea is a Norwegian multinational company operating in the chemical industry and manufacturing seaweed-based fertilizer ingredients.

== History ==

Algea Produckter As was founded in 1937 by Haakon Torgersen. The Neptune’s trident logo identified the company until 1987.

Algea was acquired by Protan, when its international level was already evident: it exported 50% of its production of seaweed meal to the Netherlands, United Kingdom, France, and the United States. In 10 years, from 1960 onward, Algea built several plants along the Norwegian coast, including that of Brønnøysund, which still exists today. The commercial results also made it possible for the company to invest in research and develop a new method of production that would revolutionize the market. In the 1980s, supported by proven beneficial properties of its products, Algea diversified production, extending it to animal feed, including fish food, and cosmetics. Protan was in turn acquired by the Securus group. The logo of the latter, a double &quot;S&quot;, was used by Algea from 1987 to 1994.

In 2000, the company acquired Maxicrop, an English company specializing in the production of seaweed extracts, as well as Frøytang, a Norwegian company at the time leader in production of seaweed products for human and animal consumption. In 2002 the Valagro group, a manufacturer of biostimulants, acquired Algea and started a process of restructuring and development of its image. Following the restructuring, Algea entered the functional food and food supplement ingredients markets as well as the cosmetic ingredients market.

<text>(January 4, 1882 – January 8, 1949) was a Japanese general in World War II and Chief of the Army General Staff during the final years of the conflict. He was convicted of war crimes and sentenced to life imprisonment.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===

Umezu was born in Nakatsu, Ōita, Japan, where his family ran a bookstore since the 18th century. During his years at the Kumamoto Prefectural Seiseikou High School in Kumamoto, he decided to pursue a military career. He graduated from the 15th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy on November 30, 1903, and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the infantry the following February 12, 1904. Promoted to lieutenant on June 30, 1905, he entered the 23rd class of the Army Staff College, graduating first in 1911. Following his promotion to captain on March 25, 1912, he was sent to Europe for further studies in Germany and Denmark. While in Denmark, he was also a military observer from Japan, during the course of World War I, and was promoted to major on June 1, 1918. From 1919 to 1921, he was appointed as a military attaché to Switzerland.

Umezu was promoted to lieutenant colonel on February 8, 1922, and to colonel on December 15, 1925. During the 1920s, he was a member of the &quot;Tōseiha&quot;, led by General Kazushige Ugaki along with Gen Sugiyama, Koiso Kuniaki, Tetsuzan Nagata and Hideki Tōjō. They represented a politically moderate line within the armed forces, in opposition to the radical &quot;Kōdōha&quot; movement, guided by Sadao Araki. Umezu served as an instructor at the Army Staff College from 1923 to 1924, and was commander of the IJA 3rd Infantry Regiment from 1924 to 1926.

Umezu was promoted to major general in August 1930 and commander of the IJA 1st Infantry Brigade. He worked at the General Staff from August 1933, and was sent as a military attaché to Switzerland from November 1933. After his return to Japan in March 1934, he was appointed commander of the Japanese China Garrison Army and in November repelled a large-scale Chinese incursion into Rehe Province. In June 1935 he signed the He–Umezu Agreement, which was an attempt to defuse tensions between the Republic of China and Japan, and which gave Japan control over ten provinces of Hebei. Umezu was promoted to lieutenant general in August. In August 1935, he became commander of the Sendai-based IJA 2nd Division. He strongly opposed the February 26 incident attempted coup-de-etat in 1936. Umezu was appointed Vice Minister of War from March 1936 and working under Army Minister Terauchi Hisaichi, purged many of the radical &quot;kōdōha&quot; members from the Army ranks.

===World War II===

Umezu returned to China in May 1938 as commander-in-chief of the IJA 1st Army. By this time, the IJA 1st Army had completed its combat operations, and was serving as a garrison force in Japanese-occupied northern China. From September 1939 he was commander-in-chief of the Kwantung Army, which was likewise acting as a garrison force in Manchukuo. He was promoted to full general on August 1, 1940.

In July 1944, Umezu was appointed as the final Chief of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff, and a member of the Supreme War Council, following the resignation of Hideki Tojo. Along with Army Minister Korechika Anami and Chief of Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff, Soemu Toyoda, Umezu opposed surrender in August 1945; he believed that the military should fight on, and that by forcing the Allies to sustain heavy losses in an invasion, Japan would be able negotiate for peace under better terms. He was aware of the planned coup d&#x27;état by junior officers opposed to the surrender, but did nothing to either aid or hinder it. He was personally ordered by Emperor Hirohito to sign the instrument of surrender on behalf of the armed forces on September 2, 1945, and was thus the Army&#x27;s senior representative during the surrender ceremonies on the battleship , officially ending World War II. He entered the reserves on November 30.

After the war, he was arrested by the SCAP authorities and tried as a war criminal at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in Tokyo. He was found guilty of Counts 1, 27, 29, 31 and 32 of waging a war of aggression and sentenced to life imprisonment on November 12, 1948.

Umezu died from rectal cancer in 1949 while still incarcerated. He converted to Catholicism one day before his death and his last rites were performed at his bedside by a Catholic priest. Although prior to this Umezu had followed the militaristic State Shinto religion, his family favoured Catholicism and his daughter became a Catholic nun.

<text>Cypress Semiconductor Corporation was an American semiconductor design and manufacturing company. It offered NOR flash memories, F-RAM and SRAM Traveo microcontrollers, PSoCs, PMICs, capacitive touch-sensing controllers, Wireless BLE Bluetooth Low-Energy and USB connectivity solutions.

Its headquarters were in San Jose, California, with operations in the United States, Ireland, India and the Philippines.

In April 2016, Cypress Semiconductors announced the acquisition of Broadcom’s Wireless Internet of Things Business. The deal was closed in July 2016. 

In June 2019, Infineon Technologies announced it would acquire Cypress for $9.4 billion. The deal closed in April 2020, making Infineon one of the world&#x27;s top 10 semiconductor manufacturers.

Some of its main competitors included Microchip Technology, NXP Semiconductors, Renesas Electronics and Micron Technology.

==History==
=== Founding and early years===
It was founded by T. J. Rodgers and others (Fritz Beyerlein, Fred Jenne, Steven H. Kaplan, R. Michael Starnes and Lowell Turriff) from Advanced Micro Devices. It was formed in 1982 with backing by Sevin Rosen and went public in 1986. The company initially focused on the design and development of high speed CMOS SRAMs, EEPROMs, PAL devices, and TTL devices. Two years after going public the company switched from the NASDAQ to the New York Stock Exchange. In October 2009, the company announced it would switch its listing to the NASDAQ on November 12, 2009.

The AgigA Tech, Inc. subsidiary sells non-volatile random-access memory (RAM). It was acquired during the Simtek purchase in August 2008, and marks the second time that Cypress acquired a start-up venture from founder, Ron Sartore, who also co-founded Anchor Chips. The division was sold to the Unigen Corporation in May 2021.

In November 2011, Cypress also backed a packaging firm called Deca Technologies, Inc.

=== 2015 ===
In December 2014, Cypress Semiconductor merged with Spansion in an all-stock deal worth $1.59 billion. The merger represented the combination of two companies that were No. 1 in their respective memory markets and have successfully diversified into embedded processing.

In March 2015, Cypress and Spansion completed of the transactions of the merger in an all-stock, tax-free transaction valued at approximately $5 billion. Cypress shareholders approved the issuance of 2.457 shares of Cypress stock to Spansion shareholders for each Spansion share they own. The merger is expected to achieve more than $135 million in cost synergies on an annualized basis within three years and to be accretive to non-GAAP earnings within the first full year after the transaction closes. At the time of its merger with Spansion in 2015, Cypress Semiconductor had more than 7,000 US and foreign patents. Cypress Semiconductor is a component of the Ocean Tomo 300 Patent Index.

Cypress attempted to acquire Integrated Silicon Solution Inc. in 2015 but was thwarted by a competing bid by Chinese buyer consortium Uphill Investment Co., which included GigaDevice, a major competitor in the NOR flash market. This buyer consortium offered a higher bid than Cypress and successfully acquired ISSI for $731 million.

Also in 2015, Cypress tried to acquire Atmel, but was outbid by Dialog Semiconductor (in the end, Microchip Technology made the deal).

===2016===
In April 2016, Cypress announced the acquisition of Broadcom’s Wireless Internet of Things (IoT) business and related assets in an all-cash transaction valued at $550 million. Under the terms of the deal, Cypress will acquire Broadcom&#x27;s Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Zigbee IoT product lines and intellectual property, along with its WICED brand and developer ecosystem.

In April 2016, it was announced that Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc. will invest $60 million in Deca and will license Deca’s M-Series fan-out wafer-level packaging (FOWLP) technologies and processes. As part of the agreement, ASE Group and Deca will jointly develop the M-Series fan-out manufacturing process and will expand production of chip-scale packages using this technology.

Cypress named Hassane El-Khoury its president and chief executive officer, and announced he will join the board of directors on Aug. 11, 2016.

=== 2017 board dispute ===
In April 2017 Delaware Chancery Court decided Cypress Semiconductor Corp. had to give former CEO Rodgers insight into internal documents related to possible violations of Cypress&#x27;s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics by executive chairman Ray Bingham.

Bingham, who is a founding member of venture capital firm Canyon Bridge Capital Partners Inc, a China state-backed private equity fund, was criticized for the conflict of interest leading Cypress and Canyon Bridge as both companies possibly focus on the same acquisition targets.

Rodgers ran a proxy contest against the board, aiming for veteran tech industry board directors Daniel McCranie and Camillo Martino to replace Ray Bingham and Cypress director Éric Benhamou.

On June 12, 2017 it was made public that Ray Bingham stepped down from the board. Prior to Bingham’s resignation, shareholder-advisory firms ISS, Glass Lewis and Egan-Jones had recommended McCranie and Martino, Rodgers&#x27;s nominees, citing &quot;additional - and sharper - questions not only regarding the board&#x27;s handling of this situation but also regarding the potential for conflicts of interest inherent in Bingham&#x27;s dual roles.&quot;

On June 20, 2017, both of Rodgers&#x27;s nominees won victories by substantial margins.

=== 2019-2020 merger ===
In 2019, under CEO Hassane El-Khouri, the company agreed to the offer of Infineon Technologies valued about $9 billions (that represents the all-cash buyout price of $23.85 per share). This purchase price premium of 55% was the 4th highest premium paid for a public semiconductor company with greater than $1 Billion in value since 2014. The price also represented 18.2 times next twelve month average analyst EBITDA estimates, which was the 4th highest EBITDA multiple paid for a public semiconductor company with a value greater than $1 Billion since 2014. The acquisition was announced complete on April 17, 2020, ending the independent history of Cypress Semiconductors.

<text>The 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion, nicknamed The Triple Nickles, was an all-black airborne unit of the United States Army during World War II.

==History==
===Activation===
The unit was activated as a result of a recommendation made in December 1942 by the Advisory Committee on Negro Troop Policies, chaired by the Assistant Secretary of War, John J. McCloy. In approving the committee&#x27;s recommendation for a black parachute battalion, Chief of Staff General George C. Marshall decided to start with a company, and on 25 February 1943, the 555th Parachute Infantry Company was constituted.

On 19, 1943, Headquarters, Army Ground Forces, authorized the activation of the company as an all-black unit with black officers as well as black enlisted men. All unit members were to be volunteers, with an enlisted cadre to be selected from personnel of the 92nd Infantry Division at Fort Huachuca, Arizona.

The company was officially activated on 30 December 1943, at Fort Benning, Georgia. After several months of training, the unit moved to Camp Mackall, North Carolina, where it was reorganized and redesignated on 25 November 1944, as Company A of the newly formed 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion.

===World War II===
The battalion did not serve overseas during World War II, primarily because it never reached full strength for an Airborne Infantry Battalion. In reaction to the German counterattack that began the Battle of Bulge, the Airborne Command considered reorganizing the 555th PIB as a single reinforced Airborne Rifle Company, and sending it to Europe to reinforce the battered Airborne units already there. However, before this could happen the crisis had passed, and the 555th PIB was instead alerted for deployment to the West Coast. The men of the 555th PIB hoped that they would get into the war against the Japanese, but that was not their new mission. According to Sergeant Walter Morris, &quot;It was a secret mission called Operation Firefly. We thought we were going overseas to [Gen. Douglas] MacArthur&#x27;s theater.&quot; It wasn&#x27;t until they arrived in Oregon, in May 1945, that they learned they would be fighting the Japanese on the fire line in the Western United States.

During the winter of 1944–45, the Japanese sent 9,300 Fu-Go balloon bombs toward North America. It was believed 1,000 succeeded in reaching the United States; 312 balloon bombs have been found. After three days, each balloon dropped an incendiary bomb. The balloon bombs employed a ballast system designed to maintain an average altitude of 30,000 feet. Incendiary bombs would be dropped one at a time (four 11-pounders) and a single high-explosive bomb (33 pounds) would be dropped followed by a self-destruct device. In order to conceal the efficacy of these attacks, the missions of the 555th PIB was kept clandestine in nature. By January 1945, however, both &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; reported the mission.

Although there were no significant wildfires, small ones nonetheless developed from some of the balloon bombs being detonated suddenly after landing on the forests undisturbed for weeks or months mainly in California, Oregon, or Idaho. Stationed at Pendleton Field, Oregon (formerly the base of the pilots and aircraft selected for the Doolittle raid on Japan), with a detachment in Chico, California, unit members participated in fire-fighting missions throughout the Pacific Northwest during the summer and fall of 1945. The 555th worked on twenty-eight fires during the 1945 season. Of these, fifteen fires were &quot;jumped&quot; or parachuted to. While some United States Forest Service reports refer to some employees as smokejumpers, the 555th were reported as paratroopers on all fire reports. The only fatality in the unit died while jumping on 6 August 1945.
The activities of the unit &amp; Project Firefly were reported in the fourth episode of Your AAF, &#x27;Firefighting Paratroopers&#x27; segment broadcast September 13, 1945, which can be found on YouTube and most old-time radio websites. it includes a brief interview by AAF reporter Sergeant Douglas Cooley with jumpmaster Captain Richard Williams, executive officer of the paratroop battalion, in a C47 piloted by Colonel Frank McNees, who commanded the 435th group of the 9th troop carrier command which carried the first airborne divisions over the beaches of Normandy, &amp; later across the Rhine.

The 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion was nicknamed the &quot;Triple Nickles&quot; because of its numerical designation and the selection of 17 of the original 20-member &quot;colored test platoon&quot; from the 92nd Infantry (Buffalo) Division. Hence, the origin of the nickname, Buffalo Nickles. Not to be confused with the U.S. 5-cent coin that had a bison (buffalo) on it, which was first minted long before the war, the spelling derives from old English. Three buffalo nickels joined in a triangle or pyramid is the identifying symbol.

Soon after returning to Camp Mackall in October 1945, the 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion was transferred to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, its home for the next two years. During this period the unit was attached to the elite 82d Airborne Division. When the battalion was inactivated on 15 December 1947, its men were all transferred into the 3d Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 82d Airborne Division, which had been reduced to cadre strength to prepare for their arrival. Also on that date, the 505PIR was redesignated at the 505th Airborne Infantry Regiment.

Soon afterward, individual black paratroopers were transferred to units throughout the 82d Airborne Division, making it the first integrated division in the US Army. The 555th PIB was formally disbanded 22 August 1950.

===Inactivated===
After its inactivation, many former 555th PIB members later fought in the Korean War in other units. First Lieutenant Harry Sutton, one of the battalion&#x27;s former officers, died leading a rearguard action during the Hungnam evacuation and was decorated posthumously with the Silver Star. In 1950, a large number of former 555th PIB members volunteered to form the all-black 2nd Ranger Infantry Company (Airborne). While the 2nd RIC was attached to the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team, it made the combat jump at Munsan-Ni in March 1951, the first combat jump ever made by a US Army Ranger unit. This was the only combat jump ever made by an all-black unit as the Army was segregated by race at the time. President Harry Truman had ordered the military desegregated on July 26, 1948, but it was slow to comply with the order. The last all-black unit was disbanded in 1954.

Clarence H. Beavers, the first volunteer for the 555th, went on to a career in computer systems with the Veterans Administration and US Defense Department, and served as a volunteer firefighter in retirement. He was the last surviving member of the unit when he died in 2017, at age 96.

Although not specifically named, an all-Black parachute unit is prominently mentioned in the 1948 novel &quot;Fire&quot;, by George R. Stewart. Jumping into an uncontrolled California forest fire, they fight it for several days alongside people of many ethnic backgrounds.

In John Ringo&#x27;s Legacy of the Aldenata military science fiction series, the 555 PIR is reactivated as the 555th Mobile Infantry Regiment. The reborn &quot;Triple Nickle&quot; Regiment was one of the most highly decorated units in the Defense of Earth during the Posleen War.

The Triple Nickles is prominently featured in the historical novel, &quot;The Last Jump - A Novel of World War II&quot; by John E. Nevola.

The Triple Nickles are an important part of the book &quot;Jump into the Sky&quot;, written by Shelley Pearsall.

<text>Niagara University (NU) is a private Catholic university in the Vincentian tradition in the census-designated place Niagara University, New York, in the town of Lewiston near Niagara Falls. It is run by the Congregation of the Mission and has approximately 3,300 undergraduate students in 50 academic programs. Approximately half of the students are residents while the other half commute from the surrounding area. The campus area was listed as a census-designated place in 2020 with a population of 940.

== History ==
Founded by the Congregation of the Mission on 21 November 1856 as &quot;Our Lady of Angels Seminary,&quot; the school moved from Buffalo to its current location on May 1, 1857. After 26 years on its new campus as &quot;The College and Seminary of Our Lady of Angels&quot;, it changed its name to Niagara University on August 7, 1883. In 1887, the university opened a law school in Buffalo, what is now the University at Buffalo Law School after being acquired by the University at Buffalo in 1891.

The university is still run by the Vincentian Fathers. All of Niagara&#x27;s 26 presidents, including its current president, Rev. James J. Maher, CM, have been Vincentian priests.

== Academics ==

===Admissions===
For 2023, Niagara University had an acceptance rate of 90%. The university requires an official high school transcript, evidence of past performance and character, and
recommendations from teachers, counselors, or organizational leaders, but does not require applicants to submit either SAT or ACT scores. Half the applicants admitted to the university who submitted test scores had an SAT score between 1030 and 1240 or an ACT score between 24 and 28. The average high school GPA for admitted students was 3.63.

===Areas of study and programs===
Undergraduate students are able to choose an area of study in any of Niagara&#x27;s five academic colleges. In addition to the College of Arts and Sciences, Holzschuh College of Business Administration, College of Education, College of Nursing, and the College of Hospitality and Tourism Management, Niagara&#x27;s Academic Exploration Program allows first and second-year students to take courses in various departments before deciding on a major. Niagara University offers over 80 different major choices.

The university also offers academic programs in Canada which operate under the written consent of the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities of Ontario. The Niagara University in Ontario, located at Expo City in Vaughan, offers a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Professional Studies in Education program (accredited by the Ontario College of Teachers) and a Master of Science degree in education. In 2019, Niagara University expanded their degree offerings with a Master of Business Administration (MBA), a Master of Science in finance (MSF), and a Master of Science in Information and Security and Digital Forensics (MSISDF). The two Masters programs are now being jointly offered with Seneca Polytechnic. The university also offers Ontario-based Additional Qualifications for the teacher profession.

=== College of Arts and Sciences ===
The College of Arts and Sciences forms the foundation of Niagara University&#x27;s curriculum and serves as the basis for its designation as a liberal arts college. All Niagara students complete a portion of their coursework in the College of Arts and Sciences, as numerous general education courses are housed within this unit.

In 2008, Niagara University announced that a $10 million gift, the largest gift in the university&#x27;s history, had been made to the College of Arts and Sciences by B. Thomas Golisano, the CEO of Paychex and the former owner of the Buffalo Sabres. The gift funded the construction of the B. Thomas Golisano Center for Integrated Sciences. The school broke ground on the center during the 2011–2012 school year and the facility opened in August 2013.

=== Holzschuh College of Business Administration ===
The business college includes programs in accounting, economics, finance, management, and marketing. The College of Business is accredited by AACSB International and has maintained accreditation since 2001. The college received a $10 million donation from Jeff and Mary Helen Holzschuh, both graduates of the university. Mr. Holzschuh is a managing director of Morgan Stanley and Mrs. Holzschuh a B.S. in nursing. The university renamed the College of Business to the Holzschuh College of Business Administration in 2022.

===Rankings===
In 2024, out of 178 ranked universities, Niagara University was ranked tied for 30th overall by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in Regional Universities North, ranked #2 in Best Value Schools, and ranked 13th in Best Colleges for Veterans. Taking into account educational quality, affordability, and alumni success, &quot;Money Magazine&quot; ranked Niagara University as the best college or university in the Buffalo-Niagara region in 2017 when it comes to delivering the most value for a student&#x27;s educational dollar. Kiplinger&#x27;s Personal Finance ranked Niagara University 82nd in the magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 best values among private universities.

The Niagara University Fine Arts Program has studio and classroom space in the Museum for students. Docent and volunteer programs are offered to any interested member of the community. The bachelor&#x27;s degree in Art History with Museum Studies has been offered since the fall of 2013, and is now one of the very few places in the country that offer Museum Studies at an undergraduate level.

== Athletics ==
The Niagara University Athletics Department sponsors 18 Division I sports. The Purple Eagles compete in the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC) in all sports except ice hockey. The men&#x27;s ice hockey team competes in Atlantic Hockey America. Niagara named Simon Gray as its athletics director on May 16, 2014.

The men&#x27;s basketball team won the MAAC Championship in 2005 and in 2007, earning automatic bids to the 2005 and 2007&#x27;s NCAA tournaments, known colloquially as the &quot;Big Dance&quot;. Niagara&#x27;s first appearance in the Dance came in 1970, when All-American Calvin Murphy led the Purple Eagles to the Sweet Sixteen. On March 13, 2007, Niagara defeated Florida A&amp;M 77–69 in the so-called &quot;play-in game&quot;. NU was crowned the 2012-2013 MAAC regular season champions. This title earned them an automatic bid into the NIT where they faced the University of Maryland in the first round.

The men&#x27;s hockey team won the College Hockey America Championship in 2000, 2004 and 2008, appearing in the NCAA Men&#x27;s Ice Hockey Championship those years. In 2000, the &quot;Purps&quot; pulled an upset against University of New Hampshire to advance to the Elite Eight.

Two years later, the women&#x27;s hockey team, under head coach Margot Page, shocked the college hockey world by advancing to the Frozen Four, eventually tying the University of Minnesota in the third-place game.

Six other Niagara teams have advanced to the NCAA Tournament in their respective sports: softball (1998); women&#x27;s soccer (2006); women&#x27;s tennis (2003 &amp; 2005); men&#x27;s soccer (2012); women&#x27;s volleyball (2009, 2010 &amp; 2011); and women&#x27;s lacrosse (2024).

=== Clubs ===
During the 2019-2020 School Year, NU teams competed in Men&#x27;s Baseball, Basketball, Ice Hockey, Lacrosse, Rugby, Soccer and Volleyball at the club level. Women teams competed in Basketball, Lacrosse, Rugby, Soccer, Softball, and Volleyball while Co-Ed teams competed in E-Sports, Field Hockey and Golf. Badminton, Roller Hockey, Running, and Tennis clubs have also been active on campus in prior years.

=== Intramurals ===
The Athletics Department also operates the Kiernan Center – Niagara&#x27;s on-campus fitness facility – and sponsors a comprehensive slate of intramural sports, including basketball, broomball, flag football, indoor soccer, softball, street hockey, and rugby union.

<text>The Trinity Railway Express (TRE) is a commuter rail service in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, Texas, United States. It was established by an interlocal agreement between Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) and Trinity Metro. Each transit authority owns a 50% stake in the joint rail project and contractor Herzog Transit Services operates the line. The TRE began operating in December 1996.

In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of , making it the seventeenth most-ridden commuter rail system in the United States.

Before 2006, the TRE was typically shown as a green line on DART maps and therefore was sometimes referred to as the &quot;Green Line,&quot; but this was not an official designation. In 2006, DART chose green as the color for its new light rail route, the . Since 2006, the TRE has been shown as a dark blue line on DART maps.

== History ==
Named after the Trinity River, the West Fork of which flows from Fort Worth to Dallas, the TRE was launched on December 30, 1996, shortly after the inaugural service of Dallas&#x27; DART light rail system, operating from Dallas Union Transit Station to the South Irving Transit Station. It runs along a former Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railroad line that the cities of Dallas and Fort Worth purchased in 1983 for $34 million.

Service initially operated only in weekday rush hours, but midday and evening service was added in December 1997, and Saturday service was added in December 1998.

On September 18, 2000, the line was extended to the suburb of Richland Hills and, for the first time, there was rail service available between downtown Dallas and Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. On November 13, 2000, the West Irving Transit Station also opened. On December 3, 2001, the TRE was extended to its current terminus at the T&amp;P Station in downtown Fort Worth. On February 17, 2024, Richland Hills station was closed, being replaced by Trinity Lakes station, which opened on February 19, 2024.

== Route ==
The eastern terminus of the TRE route is Dallas Union Station on the west side of downtown Dallas. From there, the line runs northwest parallel to Interstate 35E, passing American Airlines Center and Dallas Market Center before turning west. The line crosses the Elm Fork of the Trinity River into Irving, passing through Irving&#x27;s historic downtown district. The train continues west to the Dallas County/Tarrant County border, passing under the President George Bush Turnpike.

While crossing into Tarrant County, the line passes about four miles south of Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. The line passes over SH-360 and takes a slight southwest turn along the northern city limits of Arlington. It turns slightly northwest towards Bell before following the southern city limits of Hurst. As it approaches Interstate 820, it takes a sharper southwest turn towards downtown Fort Worth, passing through Richland Hills and Haltom City. The line enters downtown Fort Worth from the northeast, passing under Interstate 35W and curving towards Fort Worth Central Station. Finally, the track curls around downtown Fort Worth towards T&amp;P Station.

According to current TRE schedules, a one-way trip in either direction takes approximately 1 hour and 2 minutes.

== Service ==
TRE provides service six days a week from 4 AM (5 AM on Saturdays) to midnight (1 AM on Fridays). Trains are scheduled to arrive once every hour, or once every half-hour on weekdays during peak periods (4 to 9 AM and 2 to 7 PM). TRE does not provide service on Sundays except during the State Fair of Texas, in which case a Saturday schedule is used.

The TRE service yard is located in Irving between West Irving and CentrePort/DFW. During the start and end of both service time and peak periods, some trains will start or end at one of these stations.

=== TRE Link ===
Because TRE passes south of Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, the airport is serviced via a shuttle bus that runs between CentrePort/DFW and the airport&#x27;s Terminal B. The Terminal B stop provides a connection to TEXRail via a pedestrian path. Branded as TRE Link and operated by Trinity Metro, the shuttle runs every 20-40 minutes during TRE operating hours.

== Rolling Stock ==
=== Diesel locomotives ===
TRE has a fleet of 11 locomotives.

* EMD F59PH IV (1994)
There are seven EMD F59PH IV locomotives that were acquired from GO Transit.  The original numbers for these were #525, #527–528 and #565–568.
These were overhauled in late 2010 by the Norfolk Southern Railway and RELCO Locomotive to meet EPA standards and renumbered 120–126.
* EMD F59PHI (2001)
There are two EMD F59PHI locomotives that were purchased from EMD. The numbers for these are #569 and #570.
* EMD F40PH (2022)
TRE acquired 2 ex-Amtrak F40PHs No. 270 and 274 from Progress Rail in Late 2021 and Delivered in January 2022. They are numbered 130 and 131.
* Siemens Charger (2026)
TRE announced an order for Siemens Charger locomotives in 2024, which are to be delivered in 2026. They are slated to replace the older locomotives in the fleet.

=== Coaches ===
* Bombardier Transportation and Hawker Siddeley bi-level cabs and coaches
1000-1001 built 1983 (now coaches 1048-1049)
1002-1003 built 2003
1004-1009 built 2007

=== Former fleet ===
Until 2011, the TRE fleet included diesel multiple units, in the form of 13 Budd Rail Diesel Cars (RDCs) built in the 1950s for Canadian Pacific (9), Canadian National (3) and Boston &amp; Maine (1). They were purchased used from Via Rail Canada in 1993. All were remanufactured by GEC-Alsthom in Montreal. They entered service in March and April 1997after trains leased from Amtrak and the Connecticut Department of Transportation temporarily provided initial TRE service when the RDCs were not ready in time for the inauguration of TRE service in December 1996and thereafter provided all service for the line&#x27;s first two to three years. They remained in service for about 14 years, the last cars being taken off of TRE service in March 2011. In 2010–2011, 11 of the 13 cars were leased to Denton County Transportation Authority for operation on the A-train. They were returned in 2012 and placed in storage at the TRE shops in Irving, Texas. In spring 2017, 12 RDCs were sold via auction to AllEarth Rail, a Vermont-based private company that intends to use them to operate commuter rail service connecting the Vermont cities of Montpelier and Burlington. AllEarth subsequently resold two of the TRE cars to TriMet, of Portland, Oregon, before they had left Texas, and those two Dallas RDCs (Nos. 2007 and 2011) were moved in August 2017 from Texas to Oregon, where TriMet planned to use them on its WES Commuter Rail service. The other 10 RDCs were moved to Vermont the same month. Meanwhile, the last RDC was donated to the Museum of the American Railroad in 2023.

Each train includes at least one locomotive unit and one bi-level cab car. Typically, one or two additional coach cars are included between the locomotive and cab car. Each cab car (and thus each train) has a restroom and passengers may move between cars during the trip. The trip from Union Station to T&amp;P Station takes just over an hour, with scheduled trip times ranging from one hour, three minutes to one hour, eleven minutes. Track improvements are currently underway which should offer an improvement in travel times by double-tracking certain stations and sections of the route. Currently, portions of the route are single-track, requiring eastbound and westbound trains to meet only at certain points and requiring some eastbound trains to hold for 5–7 minutes to wait for a westbound train to get to the passing area.

<text>The Green Line is a light rail line in Dallas, United States, operated by the Dallas Area Rapid Transit authority (DART). The US$1.7 billion project opened in phases, starting in 2009. It operates in addition to the , , and Orange lines.

==Route==
The southern terminus of the line is currently at Buckner in southeast Dallas near Buckner Boulevard. The line runs northwest to Fair Park and Deep Ellum, before turning west and running through downtown Dallas. After leaving West End station, the line turns north, running parallel to Interstate 35 past the American Airlines Center. The line then heads northwest, providing service to Southwestern Medical Center, Love Field, and the cities of Farmers Branch and Carrollton, terminating at North Carrollton/Frankford station in Carrollton. Much of the northern end of the line runs in the right of way of the former Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad (which was established by the Dallas and Wichita Railroad).

Trinity Mills Station, near the northern terminus, provides a connection with the A-train line run by the Denton County Transportation Authority (DCTA). This line connects Denton to Carrollton, with stops in Lewisville and Highland Village. The commuter train may stop in other Denton County cities, should they choose to join the DCTA.

==History==
===Proposals===
The future Green Line was studied as two separate segments: the Northwest Corridor (from present-day North Carrollton/Frankford to Victory) and the Southeast Corridor (from present-day Deep Ellum to Buckner).

When the Southeast Corridor was originally proposed, two options were considered for the final segment past Lake June Transit Center. One option would utilize an existing Southern Pacific rail corridor paralleling US 175, while the other would create a new corridor along Lake June Road stretching into the Pleasant Grove neighborhood. Both proposals terminated at Buckner Boulevard. The first proposal was ultimately chosen due to higher costs and neighborhood opposition associated with the second.

===Construction===
*On February 9, 2007, a trench collapsed during construction on the line killing one construction worker.
*On March 12, 2007, the City of Dallas officials and DART made an agreement to make Burbank Station (formerly Love Field Station) a surface-level facility after a long debate of whether or not to make it an underground station.
*Effective June 17, 2007, the Live Oak exit on (U.S. Route 75) was closed until 2009, as part of the Green Line Rail construction around the Bryan/Hawkins intersection. Two bridges in that area were removed and roads were lowered to street level.
*On June 8, 2009, full-speed tests of the Green Line were conducted successfully with local officials and members of the media aboard. The route of the test included the four stations, then still under construction, that joined the DART light rail system in September 2009.

===Opening===
The Green Line began operation on September 14, 2009, with a route from downtown Dallas southeast to Fair Park; this short route was scheduled to open in time to service the 2009 State Fair of Texas. On December 6, 2010 the line extended further to Pleasant Grove, as well as continuing northwest from Victory Station to Farmers Branch and Carrollton; both extensions, completing the Green Line.

===Future plans===
The D2 Subway is planned to be implemented in 2028 and will reroute the Green Line&#x27;s western terminus over the former Blue Line&#x27;s tracks to terminate at UNT Dallas Station.

<text>The 18th Golden Raspberry Awards were held on March 22, 1998, at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel to recognize the worst the movie industry had to offer in 1997. This year, the film with the most nominations was &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; with 11, followed by &quot;Speed 2: Cruise Control&quot; with eight nominations, &quot;Anaconda&quot; with six nominations, &quot;The Postman&quot; with five nominations and &quot;Fire Down Below&quot; with four nominations. The film winning the most awards was &quot;The Postman&quot;, with all five categories for which it was nominated.

Brian Helgeland, co-screenwriter of the Razzie-winning &quot;The Postman&quot;, also received the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; in 1998. Helgeland became the second person, after composer Alan Menken in 1993, to receive a Razzie and Oscar in the same year, a feat not repeated until actress Sandra Bullock in 2010.

<doc id="503314" wikidata="Q156532" url="?curid=503314" title="Peter Graves">
<text>Peter Graves (born Peter Duesler Aurness; March 18, 1926 – March 14, 2010) was an American actor who portrayed Jim Phelps in the television series &quot;&quot; from 1967 to 1973 and in its revival from 1988 to 1990. His elder brother was actor James Arness. Graves also played airline pilot Captain Clarence Oveur in the 1980 comedy film &quot;Airplane!&quot; and its 1982 sequel &quot;Airplane II: The Sequel&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Peter Graves was born Peter Duesler Aurness on March 18, 1926, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the younger son of Rolf Cirkler Aurness (1894–1982), a businessman, and his wife, Ruth (&quot;née&quot; Duesler, died 1986), a journalist. 

Graves&#x27;s ancestry was Norwegian, German, and English. He used the stage name Graves, a maternal family name, to honor his mother&#x27;s family, and also so as to not be confused with the stage name of his elder brother James Arness, star of the television series &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;.

Graves graduated from Southwest High School in 1944. He was a two-time Minnesota state track champion in the 120 yard high hurdles at Southwest. He served in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II from 1944 to 1945, reaching the rank of corporal, and was awarded the American Campaign Medal and the World War II Victory Medal. After demobilization, Graves enrolled at the University of Minnesota on the G.I. Bill, and was a member of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity.

==Career==
Graves appeared in more than 70 films, television shows, and television movies during his career. He was featured in a key role in the 1953 World War II film, &quot;Stalag 17&quot;. In 1955, Graves joined the NBC television series &quot;Fury&quot;, as the rancher and adoptive single father, Jim Newton.
From 1960 to 1961, Graves starred as Christopher Cobb in 34 episodes of the British/Australian TV series &quot;Whiplash&quot;. In the storyline, Cobb is an American who arrives in Australia in the 1850s to establish the country&#x27;s first stagecoach line, using a bullwhip rather than a gun to fight the crooks he encounters. The series also starred Anthony Wickert. Graves also starred in the British ITC series &quot;Court Martial&quot;, playing U.S. Army lawyer Major Frank Whittaker (one of the series&#x27; two American leads starring opposite Bradford Dillman&#x27;s Captain David Young), as well as guest roles in such series as &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;Cimarron City&quot;, &quot;Route 66&quot;, and &quot;The Invaders&quot; (episode &quot;Moonshot&quot;).

In 1967, Graves was recruited by Desilu Studios to replace Steven Hill as the lead actor on &quot;&quot;. Graves portrayed the iconic character of Jim Phelps, the sometimes-gruff director of the Impossible Missions Force, for the six following seasons of the series. After the series ended in 1973, Graves played a cameo-type support role in the feature film &quot;Sidecar Racers&quot; in Australia which was released in 1975. Graves also made a guest appearance in the teen soap opera &quot;Class of 74&quot; in mid-1974, playing himself.

Graves was cast as Palmer Kirby in the 1983 ABC miniseries &quot;The Winds of War&quot;. He played opposite Robert Mitchum, Jan Michael Vincent, Deborah Winters and Ali MacGraw in what became in 1983, the second-most watched miniseries of all time (after &quot;Roots)&quot;. He reprised the role for the 1988 sequel miniseries, &quot;War and Remembrance&quot;. During this time, he became the host of PBS&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, based on &quot;Discover Magazine&quot;.

After playing mainly serious roles in the 1970s, he appeared as Captain Clarence Oveur in the early 1980s comedies &quot;Airplane!&quot; and &quot;Airplane II: The Sequel&quot;.

In 1988, a Hollywood writers&#x27; strike resulted in a being commissioned. Graves was the only cast member from the original series to return as a regular, reprising his role as Jim Phelps, though others (most notably Greg Morris, whose son Phil was a regular in this version) made guest appearances. The series was filmed in Australia, and Graves made his third journey there for acting work. The new version of &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot; lasted for two seasons, ending in 1990. Bookending his work on &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot;, Graves starred in two pilot films, both called &quot;Call to Danger&quot;, which were attempts to create a &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot;–style series. In the first of these (1968), Graves played a government agent (the Bureau of National Resources) who recruited civilians with special talents for secret missions. In the second &quot;Call To Danger&quot;, he portrayed an investigator for the Justice Department.

The 1960s version of the pilot, according to Patrick White in &quot;The Complete Mission: Impossible Dossier&quot; (which White reports was actually the second such pilot, but Graves was not involved in the first), is credited with winning Graves the role of Phelps; after &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot; ended in 1973, Graves filmed a third version of the pilot (this one structured as a made-for-TV movie), but it did not sell as a series. The concept was later used in the brief 1980s adventure series &quot;Masquerade&quot;.

During the 1990s, he hosted and narrated the documentary series &quot;Biography&quot; on A&amp;E. He also acted in a number of films featured on &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, which subsequently featured running jokes about Graves&#x27; &quot;Biography&quot; work and presumed sibling rivalry with Arness. The films that have been featured on &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; include &quot;&quot;, &quot;It Conquered the World&quot;, &quot;Beginning of the End&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. The film &quot;Killers from Space&quot; was featured in &quot;The Film Crew&quot;, Michael J. Nelson&#x27;s follow-up to &quot;MST3K&quot;. Graves himself parodied his &quot;Biography&quot; work in the film &quot;Men in Black II&quot;, hosting an exposé television show. He also played Colonel John Camden in the television series &quot;7th Heaven&quot;.

Graves refused to reprise the role of Jim Phelps (played by Jon Voight) in the of &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot;, after the character was revealed to be a traitor and the villain of the film. In the film, Phelps murders three fellow IMF agents, and is killed in a helicopter crash at the end, a decision that disappointed Graves and fellow cast members, and upset many fans of the original series.

On October 30, 2009, Graves was honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6667 Hollywood Blvd.

AirTran Airways featured Graves in a series of web-only &quot;Internetiquette&quot; videos in 2009 in which Graves appeared in a pilot&#x27;s uniform and references classic &quot;Airplane!&quot; lines. The videos were part of an AirTran Airways campaign to promote their in-flight wireless internet access.

In the summer of 2009, Graves signed on as a spokesman for reverse mortgage lender American Advisors Group. Graves&#x27; final project was narrating the computer game epic &quot;&quot;, released November 5, 2010.

==Personal life==

Graves was a devout Methodist of immigrant German Lutheran descent. He was married to Joan Endress Graves for 60 years from 1950 until his death.

On March 6, 1984, Graves was hospitalized at Tahoe Forest Hospital for a fractured jaw among other injuries sustained from a fall on an icy Lake Tahoe road the previous weekend. He received 100 stitches to his lower lip during his stay.

Graves and his wife Joan had three daughters: Amanda, Kelly, and Claudia.

Graves was a registered Republican.

Controversially, Graves helped organize a Los Angeles city ban on gas-powered leaf blowers.
==Death==
On March 14, 2010, after returning from brunch with his family, Graves collapsed of a heart attack outside his Los Angeles home. His daughter attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation unsuccessfully, and he was pronounced dead four days from his 84th birthday.

==Awards==
Graves was awarded a Golden Globe Award in 1971 for his role as Jim Phelps in the series &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot;. In 1972, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. He also received nominations for an Emmy Award and Golden Globe awards in other seasons of that show. Graves also won a Primetime Emmy Award for outstanding informational series in 1997 as host of &quot;Biography&quot;.

<text>R Leporis (R Lep), sometimes called Hind&#x27;s Crimson Star, is a well-known variable star in the constellation Lepus, near its border with Eridanus. 

It is a carbon star which appears distinctly red. It is named after famous British astronomer J. R. Hind, who observed it in 1845. Its apparent magnitude varies from +5.5 to +11.7 with a period of 418–441 days; recent measurements give a period of 427.07 days. There may be a secondary period of 40 years. Guandalini and Cristallo calculated the luminosity of Mira variables based on their periods. Using a period of 427.07 days, they calculated the bolometric luminosity to be .

R Leporis has often been reported as an intense smoky red color, although this is not pronounced when the star is near its maximum brightness. It is reddest when it is dimmest, which occurs every 14.5 months. During these periods it is a candidate for the most-visible reddest star, but this claim is questionable. The red coloration may be caused by carbon in the star&#x27;s outer atmosphere filtering out the blue part of its visible light spectrum. The star&#x27;s discoverer, Hind, reported that it appeared &quot;like a drop of blood on a black field.&quot;

<doc id="503321" wikidata="Q15054922" url="?curid=503321" title="Saber Marionette J">
<text>is a Japanese anime television series produced by Studio Junio. aired on TV Tokyo from October 1, 1996, to March 25, 1997. It is the first installment of the &quot;Saber Marionette&quot; franchise. The show was localized in North America by Ocean Productions and into six other languages by various companies.

In between production, &quot;Saber Marionette J&quot; spun off into other media. A manga serialized in Kadokawa Shoten&#x27;s Dragon Age magazine ran from October 1996 to November 1999, and was collected into five volumes. A concurrent radio drama was broadcast and the show&#x27;s original soundtrack was published by Kings Records. The show was also the basis for a PlayStation fighting game called &quot;Saber Marionette J: Battle Sabers&quot;, developed and published by Tom Create.

==Plot==
Otaru Mamiya is an 18-year-old day laborer living on his own in the fictional city state of Japoness. Employed as a fish peddler and running a morning&#x27;s catch, he is hit by a car driven by Mitsurugi Hanagata, an acquaintance, spoiling his merchandise and sparking a fight the two agree to take elsewhere.

Traveling to a gully outside of the town, the boys continue their quarrel on a bridge where a skilled Otaru makes quick work of his opponent. In an unfortunate turn of events however, Otaru, balancing himself on a fence post which breaks off, is dumped into the river below where he is helplessly washed away.

Moments later, having drifted ashore in a small pond, Otaru finds himself at a rural athenaeum, the Japoness Pioneer Museum. He curiously explores the decrepit building, falling through a trapdoor and into a secret underground basement where he finds and awakens an encapsulated marionette. She introduces herself as Lime, embracing the dumbfounded boy with a laugh and revealing an unprecedented ability to express emotion.

===Setting===
The prologue of &quot;Saber Marionette J&quot; is set sometime into the 22nd century, when Earth&#x27;s population has grown to such a magnitude that humanity cannot feasibly continue without colonizing space. The initial stages of the project make a promising effort of moving civilization into orbit, however it is during travel to a planet name Terra II that a transport vessel, the Mesopotamia, experiences a catastrophic fate, destroying all but a lone escape pod of people who plunge to the surface below. Of the handful of survivors however, only six males survive the crash, a ratio that both cripples their manpower and leaves them unable to reproduce.

Marooned and without communication, the men turn to genetic engineering as a method to produce clones of themselves, enough to populate the planet and sustain habitation. The effort is critically fruitful, and over a course of three centuries, each of the survivors and their successors establish individual settlements in the form of six city-states.

In spite of the remarkable success however, notwithstanding even advancements in technology, Terra II remains uninhabited by women. An effort to substitute this absence is made with the manufacture of feminine androids name &quot;marionettes&quot;; creations that, while they serve their purpose, operate without sapience, emotion, or free will.

===Themes===
&quot;Saber Marionette J&quot; contains several groups of notable themes, mainly in the names of characters and locations. The focal heroines, Lime, Cherry, and Bloodberry, are named after fruits, while their counterparts, Tiger, Luchs, and Panther are named after animals, specifically of the family Felidae (using the German words and pronunciations for tiger, lynx, and panther due to their Galtland origins). Ieyasu Tokugawa, the fictional shogun of Japoness, derives his name and appearance from Tokugawa Ieyasu, while Gerhardt von Faust, führer of Galtland, is an allusion of Adolf Hitler whose name may be derived from Faust, a character of German folklore.

The city-states established by the male survivors are also based on the political and developmental histories and periods of countries. Japoness is a reminiscence of feudal Japan, Galtland portrays the totalitarian regime of Nazi Germany, Peterburg is structured after Soviet Russia, New Texas is representative of the modern United States, Xi&#x27;an paints the image of Imperial China and Romana takes after the Roman Empire. The letters that affix the titles of the franchise have also been explained to represent the city-state in which a particular series is set in. &quot;Saber Marionette R&quot;, for example, takes place in Romana while &quot;Saber Marionette J&quot;, occurs in Japoness.

Besides the show&#x27;s botanic, animal and historic references, as well as its generally comedic overtones, &quot;Saber Marionette J&quot; briefly explores deeper motifs as well. One such motif, outspoken by Mitsurugi, is the discriminatory notion that marionettes are of no importance to humans beyond their menial labor, and should be disenfranchised to the affection or privileges of people. This idea becomes more recurrent later in the series when Otaru finds himself growing closer to the girls and questions himself for it. Another visited theme is the exploration of life, its senescence, and death. These truths have a major impact on the girls&#x27; developmental identity as they come to terms with themselves and humans.

==Characters==
&quot;Saber Marionette J&quot; follows the life and adventures of , an obstinate young man, who through mishap and predestination, goes from a nondescript street vendor to a national hero and sensation. During the onset of the series, Otaru comes into the inadvertent acquisition of three marionettes; , a wildly effervescent girl with a knack for mischief; , the gentle and soft-spoken mind with gifted culinary skills; and , a bold and voluptuous woman with vigor matched only by her libido. Warranted by their unique ability to show mood and temperament, it is explained that each of the girls possess a heart-like technology, known as a &quot;maiden circuit&quot;, that empowers them with emotion. , the effeminate gay acquaintance who has a crush on Otaru and whose reckless driving more or less sets the premise of the show, also bands together with the group on their travels and as their neighbor when his mansion is burned down.

The show&#x27;s focal antagonists and their endeavors are fronted by , the c dictator of Gartlant who campaigns to conquer his neighboring sovereigns in order to control all of Terra II. Like Otaru, Faust is supported by his own trio of marionettes, collectively known as the &quot;Saber Dolls&quot;, who are structurally villainous counterparts to Lime, Cherry and Bloodberry: , the tenacious and emotionally subservient leader; , an intelligent and accomplished strategist; and , a loud and vicious blonde. In a complementing fashion, each of these girls also possess maiden circuits.

==Media==

===Manga===
A few months before the release of the anime, a manga iteration of &quot;Saber Marionette J&quot; began to circulate in Kadokawa Shoten&#x27;s &quot;Monthly Dragon Age&quot; written by series creator Satoru Akahori and illustrated by Yumisuke Kotoyoshi. The series ran from October 1996 to November 1999, being collected in five volumes by the company from January 1997 to December 1999. Besides its native release, Editora JBC, a Tokyo-based Portuguese publisher, announced on March 8, 2010 that it has secured the rights to the series.

In a similar fashion to the animated series, the &quot;Saber Marionette J&quot; manga was localized into other languages. Notably, Tokyopop announced in 2003 that it had acquired the publishing rights to the series and that the first volume would be released in July of that year. Madman Entertainment, an Australian publisher, additionally published the manga in Oceania from May 19, 2004 to March 5, 2005. Editorial Ivrea, an Argentina-based publishing company, published the series in Spanish.

===Light novels===
A total of 14 light novels were made about the series, written by Satoru Akahori and illustrated by Tsukasa Kotobuki. The books were printed by Fujimi Shobo between April 1995 and July 1, 1999.

===Audio CDs===
The complete soundtrack of &quot;Saber Marionette J&quot; was reproduced for distribution when the anime was still in production. The initial release, titled &quot;Japones ginei shisyu sonoichi&quot; (Japones Recitation Poem Collection 1)&quot;, was made on December 21, 1996 and contained 17 tracks by King Records. A sequel release, containing 24 tracks, was made on April 9, 1997.

Two audio dramas were made of the series. The first, released direct to commercial disc, was published from January 24 to May 22, 1995 as a four-disc set by King Records under their StarChild label, each containing 4 tracks with additional bonuses. These tracks would later be broadcast on October 21. The second audio drama was aired on TBS on Thursdays and was based on the aforementioned novels. Broadcasts were made from April 27 to July 3, 1997.

===Game===
Tom Create, a small Tokyo game developer, produced a fighting game of the series titled , published by Bandai Visual on March 28, 1997 for the PlayStation. Featuring Lime, Cherry, Bloodberry, the Saber Dolls, and a new marionette name Apple, the player is able to fight against a CPU or, with another controller, a second player. At the beginning of each round, player&#x27;s are also allowed to choose two special abilities to buff their characters. The game featured an alternate version of the anime opening and was released in a limited and regular edition, the former bundled with figurines and special edition portraits of the characters.

==Reception==
&quot;Saber Marionette J&quot; was met with mostly positive reception. &quot;THEM Anime Reviews&quot; gave the series a 5 out of 5 stars, calling it &quot;Top-notch animation, involving story and memorable characters make this one of the greats. If there was a flaw to be found here, it was too small to notice.&quot; Industry aggregator &quot;Mania.com&quot; editor Chris Beveridge rated each of the three North American releases a B, averaging a predictable story, an overall solid release, but that &quot;Saber Marionette J was decent if unexceptional in total.&quot;

On Anime News Network, the show retains a median &quot;Good&quot; rating, averaging a 7 out of 10; the first VHS was also given a B+. Less favorable reviews criticized the cliche plot, character voices and less than crisp artwork. On Latin America the show turned a cult classic because of its airing on Locomotion and later Animax Latin America.

<doc id="503327" wikidata="Q1790928" url="?curid=503327" title="Earl of Wiltshire">
<text>The title Earl of Wiltshire is one of the oldest in the Peerage of England, going back to the 12th century. It is currently held by the Marquess of Winchester, and is used as a courtesy title for the eldest son of the marquess.

The earldom was first created for Harvey of Léon, who married Sybilla, an illegitimate daughter of King Stephen. The title lapsed after Harvey lost his English lands during the Anarchy, since at that time one could not be an earl without the territory to support the dignity.

Patrick of Salisbury was created Earl of Wiltshire by the Empress Matilda, probably after July 1143, but he was usually styled Earl of Salisbury. He was the second but eldest surviving son of William of Salisbury and the grandson of Walter of Salisbury, the founder of Bradenstoke Priory, in Wiltshire. He was Sheriff of Wiltshire in October 1152, when he was addressed as &quot;Earl Patrick, sheriff&quot; in a writ of Stephen. Patrick of Salisbury, Earl of Wiltshire, passed the title to his great-granddaughter Margaret Longespée. She married Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, they had a daughter who became &quot;suo jure&quot; Countess of Lincoln and Wiltshire on her mother&#x27;s death. She married three times, but the earldom of Wiltshire seems to have reverted to the crown with her death in October 1348.

William le Scrope was created Earl of Wiltshire in 1397. He was executed during the events leading to the deposition of Richard II by Henry IV. The charter which granted his earldom limited its inheritance to &quot;heirs male&quot;, but did not contain the usual additional limitation &quot;of his body&quot;. Thus in 1859 a collateral descendant attempted to claim the earldom, but the claim was rejected by the House of Lords.

The next creation was for James Butler, eldest son of the 4th Earl of Ormond. He fought on the Lancastrian side at the Battle of Towton, and afterwards was executed and posthumously attainted.

The earldom was next held by three members of the Stafford family, beginning with John, a younger son of the 1st Duke of Buckingham.

Anne Boleyn&#x27;s father Thomas was the recipient of the next creation, but after outliving his son and with no other male heirs upon his death the title became vacant. He was the great-nephew of James Butler, the earl of the 1449 creation.

Finally, in 1550 William Paulet was created Earl of Wiltshire. He was made Marquess of Winchester the next year, and his descendants continue to hold both titles.

<doc id="503345" wikidata="Q212685" url="?curid=503345" title="High Middle Ages">
<text>The High Middle Ages, or High Medieval Period, was the period of European history that lasted from AD 1000 to 1300. The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around AD 1500 (by historiographical convention).

Key historical trends of the High Middle Ages include the rapidly increasing population of Europe, which brought about great social and political change from the preceding era, and the Renaissance of the 12th century, including the first developments of rural exodus and urbanization. By 1350, the robust population increase had greatly benefited the European economy, which had reached levels that would not be seen again in some areas until the 19th century. That trend faltered during the Late Middle Ages because of a series of calamities, most notably the Black Death, but also numerous wars as well as economic stagnation.

From around 780, Europe saw the last of the barbarian invasions and became more socially and politically organized. The Carolingian Renaissance stimulated scientific and philosophical activity in Northern Europe. The first universities started operating in Bologna, Oxford, Paris, Salamanca, Cambridge and Modena. The Vikings settled in the British Isles, France and elsewhere, and Norse Christian kingdoms started developing in their Scandinavian homelands. The Magyars ceased their expansion in the 10th century, and by the year 1000, a Christian Kingdom of Hungary had become a recognized state in Central Europe that was forming alliances with regional powers. With the brief exception of the Mongol invasions in the 13th century, major nomadic incursions ceased. The powerful Byzantine Empire of the Macedonian and Komnenos dynasties gradually gave way to the resurrected Serbia and Bulgaria and to a successor crusader state (1204 to 1261), who continually fought each other until the end of the Latin Empire. The Byzantine Empire was reestablished in 1261 with the recapture of Constantinople from the Latins, though it was no longer a major power and would continue to falter through the 14th century, with remnants lasting until the mid 15th century.

In the 11th century, populations north of the Alps began a more intensive settlement, targeting &quot;new&quot; lands, some areas of which had reverted to wilderness after the end of the Western Roman Empire. In what historian Charles Higounet called the &quot;great clearances&quot;, Europeans cleared and cultivated some of the vast forests and marshes that lay across much of the continent. At the same time, settlers moved beyond the traditional boundaries of the Frankish Empire to new frontiers beyond the Elbe River, which tripled the size of Germany in the process. The Catholic Church, which reached the peak of its political power around then, called armies from across Europe to a series of Crusades against the Seljuk Turks. The crusaders occupied the Holy Land and founded the Crusader States in the Levant. Other wars led to the Northern Crusades. The Christian kingdoms took much of the Iberian Peninsula from Muslim control, and the Normans conquered southern Italy, all part of the major population increases and the resettlement patterns of the era.

The High Middle Ages produced many different forms of intellectual, spiritual and artistic works. The age also saw the rise of ethnocentrism, which evolved later into modern national identities in most of Europe, the ascent of the great Italian city-states and the rise and fall of the Islamic civilization of Al-Andalus. The rediscovery of the works of Aristotle, at first indirectly through medieval Jewish and Islamic philosophy, led Maimonides, Ibn Sina, Ibn Rushd, Thomas Aquinas and other thinkers of the period to expand Scholasticism, a combination of Judeo-Islamic and Catholic ideologies with the ancient philosophy. For much of this period, Constantinople remained Europe&#x27;s most populous city, and Byzantine art reached a peak in the 12th century. In architecture, many of the most notable Gothic cathedrals were built or completed around this period.

The Crisis of the Late Middle Ages began at the start of the 14th century and marked the end of the period.

==Historical events and politics==
===Great Britain and Ireland===

In England, the Norman Conquest of 1066 resulted in a kingdom ruled by a Francophone nobility. The Normans invaded Ireland in 1169 and soon established themselves in most of the country, although their stronghold was the southeast. Likewise, Scotland and Wales were subdued into vassal states at about the same time, though Scotland later asserted its independence and Wales remained largely under the rule of independent native princes until the death of Llywelyn ap Gruffydd in 1282. The Exchequer was founded in the 12th century under King Henry I, and the first parliaments were convened. In 1215, after the loss of Normandy, King John signed the Magna Carta into law, limiting the power of English monarchs.

=== Iberia ===
A key geo-strategic development in the Iberian Peninsula was the Christian conquest of Toledo in 1085. Dominated by war, the societal structures and relations in the northern Christian kingdoms were subordinated to the demands of omnipresent military conflict. The territorial expansion of the northern Christian kingdoms to the south brought the creation of border societies, where military demands on knights and foot soldiers and the promotion of settlement were prioritized over potential seigneurial income; military orders also played an important role in the borderlands in the southern meseta. Agricultural models in areas with Mediterranean climate were generally based on biennial crop rotation. Despite population growth, agricultural output remained relatively rigid throughout the period; between the 10th and 13th centuries, migration southwards to exposed areas was incentivized by the possibility of enjoying privileges and acquiring properties. Conversely, the intensive agriculture-prevalent model in Muslim-ruled lands did not require territorial expansion. While Muslim lands enjoyed a certain demographic and financial edge, Almoravids and Almohads from northern Africa featured volatile state structures; barring (unsuccessful) attempts to take Toledo, they did not stand out for carrying out an expansionist policy.

=== Italy ===

In Italy, with the Norman conquest, the first great and powerful state was formed, the Kingdom of Sicily with hereditary monarchy. Subsequently joined to the Holy Roman Empire, it had its moment of maximum splendor with the emperor Frederick II.

In the rest of Italy, independent city states grew affluent on Eastern Mediterranean maritime trade. These were in particular the thalassocracies of Pisa, Amalfi, Genoa and Venice, which played a key role in European trade from then on, making these cities become major financial centers.

===Scandinavia===
From the mid-10th to the mid-11th centuries, the Scandinavian kingdoms were unified and Christianized, resulting in an end of Viking raids, and greater involvement in European politics. King Cnut of Denmark ruled over both England and Norway. After Cnut&#x27;s death in 1035, England and Norway were both lost, and with the defeat of Valdemar II in 1227, Danish predominance in the region came to an end. Meanwhile, Norway extended its Atlantic possessions, ranging from Greenland to the Isle of Man, while Sweden, under Birger Jarl, built up a power-base in the Baltic Sea. However, the Norwegian influence started to decline already in the same period, marked by the Treaty of Perth of 1266. Also, civil wars raged in Norway between 1130 and 1240.

===France and Germany===

By the time of the High Middle Ages, the Carolingian Empire had been divided and replaced by separate successor kingdoms called France and Germany, although not with their modern boundaries. France pushed to the west. The Angevin Empire controlled much of France in the 12th century and early 13th century until the French retook much of their previous territory. 

===Germany===

By the time of the High Middle Ages, the Carolingian Empire had been divided and replaced by separate successor kingdoms called France and Germany, although not with their modern boundaries. Germany was significantly more eastern. Germany was under the banner of the Holy Roman Empire, which reached its high-water mark of unity and political power under Kaiser Frederick Barbarossa.

===Georgia===

During the successful reign of King David IV of Georgia (1089–1125), the Kingdom of Georgia grew in strength and expelled the Seljuk Empire from its lands. David&#x27;s decisive victory in the Battle of Didgori (1121) against the Seljuk Turks, as a result of which Georgia recaptured its lost capital Tbilisi, marked the beginning of the Georgian Golden Age. David&#x27;s granddaughter Queen Tamar continued the upward rise, successfully neutralizing internal opposition and embarking on an energetic foreign policy aided by further decline of the hostile Seljuk Turks. Relying on a powerful military élite, Tamar was able to build on the successes of her predecessors to consolidate an empire which dominated vast lands spanning from present-day southern Russia on the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea. Georgia remained a leading regional power until its collapse under the Mongol attacks within two decades after Tamar&#x27;s death.

===Hungary===
In the High Middle Ages, Hungary became one of the most powerful medieval states in Europe. The Christian Kingdom of Hungary was established in 1000 under King Saint Stephen I of Hungary, and ruled by the Árpád dynasty for the following centuries. King Saint Ladislaus completed the work of King Saint Stephen. He consolidated the Hungarian state power and strengthened the influence of Christianity. His charismatic personality, strategic leadership and military talents resulted the termination of internal power struggles and foreign military threats. The Kingdom of Hungary expanded to the Adriatic coast and entered a personal union with Croatia in 1102, by establish other vassal states, Hungary became a small empire that extended its control over the Southeast Europe and the Carpathian region. The Hungarian royal Árpád dynasty gave the world the most saints and blessed from a single family.

===Lithuania===

During the High Middle Ages Lithuania emerged as a Duchy of Lithuania in the early 13th century, then briefly becoming the Kingdom of Lithuania from 1251 to 1263. After the assassination of its first Christian king Mindaugas Lithuania was known as Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Unconquered during the Lithuanian Crusade, Lithuania itself rapidly expanded to the East due to conquests and became one of the largest states in Europe.

===Poland===

In the mid-10th century Poland emerged as a duchy after Mieszko I, the ruler of the Polans, conquered the surrounding Lechitic tribes in the region. Then in 1025 under the rule of Bolesław I the Brave, Poland became a kingdom.

===Southeast Europe===

The High Middle Ages saw the height and decline of the Slavic state of Kievan Rus&#x27; and emergence of Cumania. Later, the Mongol invasion in the 13th century had a great impact on the east of Europe, as many countries of the region were invaded, pillaged, conquered or vassalized.

During the first half of this period (1185), Byzantine Empire dominated the Southeast Europe, and under the Komnenian emperors there was a revival of prosperity and urbanization; however, their domination of Southeast Europe was coming to an end with a successful Vlach-Bulgarian rebellion in 1185, and henceforth the region was divided between the Byzantines in Greece, some parts of Macedonia, and Thrace, the Bulgarians in Moesia and most of Thrace and Macedonia, and the Serbs to the northwest. Eastern and Western churches had formally split in the 11th century, and despite occasional periods of co-operation during the 12th century, in 1204 the Fourth Crusade treacherously captured Constantinople. This severely damaged the Byzantines, and their power was ultimately weakened by the Seljuks and the rising Ottoman Empire in the 14–15th century. The power of the Latin Empire, however, was short-lived after the Crusader army was routed by Bulgarian Emperor Kaloyan in the Battle of Adrianople (1205).

===Climate and agriculture===
The Medieval Warm Period, the period from the 10th century to about the 14th century in Europe, was a relatively warm and gentle interval ended by the generally colder Little Ice Age which would continue until the Middle of the 19th century. Farmers grew wheat well north into Scandinavia, and wine grapes in northern England, although the maximum expansion of vineyards appeared to occur within the Little Ice Age period. During this time, a high demand for wine and steady volume of alcohol consumption inspired a viticulture revolution of progress. The relative protection from famine during this time allowed Europe&#x27;s population to increase, despite the famine in 1315 that killed 1.5 million people. This increased population contributed to the founding of new towns and an increase in industrial and economic activity during the period. They also established trade and a comprehensive production of alcohol. Food production also increased during this time as new ways of farming were introduced, including the use of a heavier plow, horses instead of oxen, and a three-field system that allowed the cultivation of a greater variety of crops than the earlier two-field system—notably legumes, the growth of which prevented the depletion of important nitrogen from the soil.

===The rise of chivalry===
During the High Middle Ages, the idea of a Christian warrior started to change as Christianity grew more prominent in medieval Europe. The Codes of Chivalry promoted the ideal knight to be selfless, faithful, and fierce against those who threaten the weak. Household heavy cavalry (knights) became common in the 11th century across Europe, and tournaments were invented. Tournaments allowed knights to establish their family name while being able to gather vast wealth and renown through victories. In the 12th century, the Cluny monks promoted ethical warfare and inspired the formation of orders of chivalry, such as the Templar Knights. Inherited titles of nobility were established during this period. In 13th-century Germany, knighthood became another inheritable title, although one of the less prestigious, and the trend spread to other countries.

==Religion==
===Christian Church===

The East–West Schism of 1054 formally separated the Christian church into two parts: Roman Catholicism in Western Europe and Eastern Orthodoxy in the east. It occurred when Pope Leo IX and Patriarch Michael I excommunicated each other, mainly over disagreement over the filioque, an addition to the creed concerning the origin of the Holy Spirit, as well as disputes as to the existence of papal authority over the four Eastern patriarchs, use of unleavened bread in the liturgy, and fasting days.

===Crusades===
The Catholic Crusades occurred between the 11th and 13th centuries. They were conducted under papal authority, initially with the intent of reestablishing Christian rule in &quot;The Holy Land&quot; by taking the area from the Muslim Fatimid Caliphate. The Fatimids had captured Palestine in AD 970, lost it to the Seljuk Turks in 1073 and recaptured it in 1098, just before they lost it again in 1099 as a result of the First Crusade.

====Military orders====

In the context of the crusades, monastic military orders were founded that would become the template for the late medieval chivalric orders.

The Knights Templar were a Christian military order founded after the First Crusade to help protect Christian pilgrims from hostile locals and highway bandits. The order was deeply involved in banking, and in 1307 Philip the Fair (Philippine le Bel) had the entire order arrested in France and dismantled on charges of alleged heresy.

The Knights Hospitaller were originally a Christian organization founded in Jerusalem in 1080 to provide care for poor, sick, or injured pilgrims to the Holy Land. After Jerusalem was taken in the First Crusade, it became a religious/military order that was charged with the care and defence of the Crusader states. After the Holy Lands were eventually taken by Muslim forces, it moved its operations to Rhodes, and later Malta.

The Teutonic Knights were a German religious order formed in 1190, in the city of Acre, to aid Christian pilgrims on their way to the Holy Lands and to operate hospitals for the sick and injured in Outremer. After Muslim forces captured the Holy Lands, the order moved to Transylvania in 1211 and later, after being expelled, invaded pagan Prussia with the intention of Christianizing the Baltic region. Yet, both before and after the Order&#x27;s main pagan opponent, Lithuania, converted to Christianity, the Order had already attacked other Christian nations such as Novgorod and Poland. The Teutonic Knights&#x27; power hold, which became considerable, was broken in 1410, at the Battle of Grunwald, where the Order suffered a devastating defeat against a joint Polish-Lithuanian army. After Grunwald, the Order declined in power until 1809 when it was officially dissolved. There were ten crusades in total.

===Scholasticism===
The new Christian method of learning was influenced by Anselm of Canterbury (1033–1109) from the rediscovery of the works of Aristotle, at first indirectly through Medieval Jewish and Muslim Philosophy (Maimonides, Avicenna, and Averroes) and then through Aristotle&#x27;s own works brought back from Byzantine and Muslim libraries; and those whom he influenced, most notably Albertus Magnus, Bonaventure and Abélard. Many scholastics believed in empiricism and supporting Roman Catholic doctrines through secular study, reason, and logic. They opposed Christian mysticism, and the Platonist-Augustinian belief that the mind is an immaterial substance. The most famous of the scholastics was Thomas Aquinas (later declared a &quot;Doctor of the Church&quot;), who led the move away from the Platonic and Augustinian and towards Aristotelianism. Aquinas developed a philosophy of mind by writing that the mind was at birth a &quot;tabula rasa&quot; (&quot;blank slate&quot;) that was given the ability to think and recognize forms or ideas through a divine spark. Other notable scholastics included Muhammad Averroes, Roscelin, Abélard, Peter Lombard, and Francisco Suárez. One of the main questions during this time was the problem of universals. Prominent opponents of various aspects of the scholastic mainstream included Duns Scotus, William of Ockham, Peter Damian, Bernard of Clairvaux, and the Victorines.

===Golden age of monasticism===
* The late 11th century/early-mid 12th century was the height of the golden age of Christian monasticism (8th-12th centuries).
** Benedictine Order – black-robed monks
** Cistercian Order – white-robed monks
*** Bernard of Clairvaux

===Mendicant orders===

* The 13th century saw the rise of the Mendicant orders such as the:
** Franciscans (Friars Minor, commonly known as the Grey Friars), founded 1209
** Carmelites (Hermits of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Carmel, commonly known as the White Friars), founded 1206–1214
** Dominicans (Order of Preachers, commonly called the Black Friars), founded 1215
** Augustinians (Hermits of St. Augustine, commonly called the Austin Friars), founded 1256

===Heretical movements===
Christian heresies existed in Europe before the 11th century but only in small numbers and of local character: in most cases, a rogue priest, or a village returning to pagan traditions. However, beginning in the 11th century, mass-movement heresies appeared. The roots of this can be partially sought in the rise of urban cities, free merchants, and a new money-based economy. The rural values of monasticism held little appeal to urban people who began to form sects more in tune with urban culture. The first large-scale heretical movements in Western Europe originated in the newly urbanized areas such as southern France and northern Italy and were probably influenced by the Bogomils and other dualist movements. These heresies were on a scale the Catholic Church had never seen before and as such the response was one of elimination for some (such as the Cathars). Some Catholic monastic leaders, such as Francis of Assisi, the founder of the Franciscans, had to be recognized directly by the Pope so as not to be confused with actual heretical movements such as the Waldensians.

====Cathars====


Catharism was a movement with Gnostic elements that originated around the middle of the 10th century, branded by the contemporary Roman Catholic Church as heretical. It existed throughout much of Western Europe, but its origination was in Languedoc and surrounding areas in southern France.

The name &quot;Cathar&quot; stems from Greek &quot;katharos&quot;, &quot;pure&quot;. One of the first recorded uses is Eckbert von Schönau who wrote on heretics from Cologne in 1181: &quot;Hos nostra Germania catharos appellat.&quot; ([In] our Germany [one] calls these [people] &quot;Cathars&quot;.)

The Cathars are also called Albigensians. This name originates from the end of the 12th century, and was used by the chronicler Geoffroy du Breuil of Vigeois in 1181. The name refers to the southern town of Albi (the ancient Albiga). The designation is hardly exact, for the centre was at Toulouse and in the neighbouring districts.

The Albigensians were strong in southern France, northern Italy, and the southwestern Holy Roman Empire.

The Bogomils were strong in the Southeastern Europe, and became the official religion supported by the Bosnian kings.
* Dualists believed that historical events were the result of struggle between a good (spiritual) force and an evil (material) force and that the world was of the evil force, though it could be controlled or defeated through asceticism and good works.
* Albigensian Crusade, Simon de Montfort, Montségur, Château de Quéribus

====Waldensians====

Peter Waldo of Lyon was a wealthy merchant who gave up his riches around 1175 after a religious experience and became a preacher. He founded the Waldensians which became a Christian sect believing that all religious practices should have strictly scriptural bases. Waldo was denied the right to preach his sermons by the Third Lateran Council in 1179, which he did not obey and continued to speak freely until he was excommunicated in 1184. Waldo was critical of the Christian clergy saying they did not live according to the word. He rejected the practice of selling indulgences (simony), as well as the common saint cult practices of the day.

Waldensians are considered a forerunner to the Protestant Reformation, and they melted into Protestantism with the outbreak of the Reformation and became a part of the wider Reformed tradition after the views of John Calvin and his theological successors in Geneva proved very similar to their own theological thought. Waldensian churches still exist, located on several continents.

==Trade and commerce==

In Northern Europe, the Hanseatic League, a federation of free cities to advance trade by sea, was founded in the 12th century, with the foundation of the city of Lübeck, which would later dominate the League, in 1158–1159. Many northern cities of the Holy Roman Empire became Hanseatic cities, including Amsterdam, Cologne, Bremen, Hanover and Berlin. Hanseatic cities outside the Holy Roman Empire were, for instance, Bruges and the Polish city of Gdańsk (Danzig), as well as Königsberg, capital of the monastic state of the Teutonic Knights. In Bergen, Norway and Veliky Novgorod, Russia the league had factories and middlemen. In this period the Germans started colonising Europe beyond the Empire, into Prussia and Silesia.

In the late 13th century, a Venetian explorer named Marco Polo became one of the first Europeans to travel the Silk Road to China. Westerners became more aware of the Far East when Polo documented his travels in &quot;Il Milione&quot;. He was followed by numerous Christian missionaries to the East, such as William of Rubruck, Giovanni da Pian del Carpine, André de Longjumeau, Odoric of Pordenone, Giovanni de&#x27; Marignolli, Giovanni di Monte Corvino, and other travellers such as Niccolò de&#x27; Conti.

==Science==

Philosophical and scientific teaching of the Early Middle Ages was based upon few copies and commentaries of ancient Greek texts that remained in Western Europe after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. Most of them were studied only in Latin as knowledge of Greek was very limited.

This scenario changed during the Renaissance of the 12th century. The intellectual revitalization of Europe started with the birth of medieval universities. The increased contact with the Islamic world in Spain and Sicily during the Reconquista, and the Byzantine world and Muslim Levant during the Crusades, allowed Europeans access to scientific Arabic and Greek texts, including the works of Aristotle, Alhazen, and Averroes. The European universities aided materially in the translation and propagation of these texts and started a new infrastructure which was needed for scientific communities.
At the beginning of the 13th century there were reasonably accurate Latin translations of the main works of almost all the intellectually crucial ancient authors, allowing a sound transfer of scientific ideas via both the universities and the monasteries. By then, the natural science contained in these texts began to be extended by notable scholastics such as Robert Grosseteste, Roger Bacon, Albertus Magnus and Duns Scotus. Precursors of the modern scientific method can be seen already in Grosseteste&#x27;s emphasis on mathematics as a way to understand nature, and in the empirical approach admired by Bacon, particularly in his &quot;Opus Majus&quot;.

===Technology===
During the 12th and 13th century in Europe there was a radical change in the rate of new inventions, innovations in the ways of managing traditional means of production, and economic growth. In less than a century there were more inventions developed and applied usefully than in the previous thousand years of human history all over the globe. The period saw major technological advances, including the adoption or invention of windmills, watermills, printing (though not yet with movable type), gunpowder, the astrolabe, glasses, scissors of the modern shape, a better clock, and greatly improved ships. The latter two advances made possible the dawn of the Age of Discovery. These inventions were influenced by foreign culture and society.

Alfred W. Crosby described some of this technological revolution in &quot;The Measure of Reality: Quantification in Western Europe, 1250-1600&quot; and other major historians of technology have also noted it.

* The earliest written record of a windmill is from Yorkshire, England, dated 1185.
* Paper manufacture began in Italy around 1270.
* The spinning wheel was brought to Europe (probably from India) in the 13th century.
* The magnetic compass aided navigation, first reaching Europe some time in the late 12th century.
* Eye glasses were invented in Italy in the late 1280s.
* The astrolabe returned to Europe via Islamic Spain.
* Fibonacci introduces Hindu-Arabic numerals to Europe with his book &quot;Liber Abaci&quot; in 1202.
* The West&#x27;s oldest known depiction of a stern-mounted rudder can be found on church carvings dating to around 1180.

==Arts==

===Visual arts===

Art in the High Middle Ages includes these important movements:
* Anglo-Saxon art was influential on the British Isles until the Norman Invasion of 1066
* Romanesque art continued traditions from the Classical world (not to be confused with Romanesque architecture)
* Gothic art developed a distinct Germanic flavor (not to be confused with Gothic architecture).
* Indo-Islamic architecture begins when Muhammad of Ghor made Delhi a Muslim capital
* Byzantine art continued earlier Byzantine traditions, influencing much of Eastern Europe.
* Illuminated manuscripts gained prominence both in the Catholic and Orthodox churches

===Architecture===


Gothic architecture superseded the Romanesque style by combining flying buttresses, gothic (or pointed) arches and ribbed vaults. It was influenced by the spiritual background of the time, being religious in essence: thin horizontal lines and grates made the building strive towards the sky. Architecture was made to appear light and weightless, as opposed to the dark and bulky forms of the previous Romanesque style. It was commonly thought that light was an expression of God; therefore, architectural techniques were adapted and developed to build churches that reflected this teaching. Colorful glass windows enhanced the spirit of lightness. As color was much rarer at medieval times than today, it can be assumed that these virtuoso works of art had an awe-inspiring impact on the common man from the street. High-rising intricate ribbed, and later fan vaultings demonstrated movement toward heaven. Veneration of God was also expressed by the relatively large size of these buildings. A gothic cathedral therefore not only invited the visitors to elevate themselves spiritually, it was also meant to demonstrate the greatness of God. The floor plan of a gothic cathedral corresponded to the rules of scholasticism: According to Erwin Panofsky&#x27;s &quot;Gothic Architecture and Scholasticism&quot;, the plan was divided into sections and uniform subsections. These characteristics are exhibited by the most famous sacral building of the time: Notre Dame de Paris.

===Literature===
A variety of cultures influenced the literature of the High Middle Ages, one of the strongest among them being Christianity. The connection to Christianity was greatest in Latin literature, which influenced the vernacular languages in the literary cycle of the Matter of Rome. Other literary cycles, or interrelated groups of stories, included the Matter of France (stories about Charlemagne and his court), the Acritic songs dealing with the chivalry of Byzantium&#x27;s frontiersmen, and perhaps the best known cycle, the Matter of Britain, which featured tales about King Arthur, his court, and related stories from Brittany, Cornwall, Wales and Ireland. An anonymous German poet tried to bring the Germanic myths from the Migration Period to the level of the French and British epics, producing the Nibelungenlied. There was also a quantity of poetry and historical writings which were written during this period, such as &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; by Geoffrey of Monmouth.

Despite political decline during the late 12th and much of the 13th centuries, the Byzantine scholarly tradition remained particularly fruitful over the time period. One of the most prominent philosophers of the 11th century, Michael Psellos, reinvigorated Neoplatonism on Christian foundations and bolstered the study of ancient philosophical texts, along with contributing to history, grammar, and rhetorics. His pupil and successor at the head of Philosophy at the University of Constantinople Ioannes Italos continued the Platonic line in Byzantine thought and was criticized by the Church for holding opinions it considered heretical, such as the doctrine of transmigration. Two Orthodox theologians important in the dialogue between the eastern and western churches were Nikephoros Blemmydes and Maximus Planudes. Byzantine historical tradition also flourished with the works of the brothers Niketas and Michael Choniates in the beginning of the 13th century and George Akropolites a generation later. Dating from 12th century Byzantine Empire is also Timarion, an Orthodox Christian anticipation of Divine Comedy. Around the same time the so-called Byzantine novel rose in popularity with its synthesis of ancient pagan and contemporaneous Christian themes.

At the same time southern France gave birth to Occitan literature, which is best known for troubadours who sang of courtly love. It included elements from Latin literature and Arab-influenced Spain and North Africa. Later its influence spread to several cultures in Western Europe, notably in Portugal and the Minnesänger in Germany. Provençal literature also reached Sicily and Northern Italy laying the foundation of the &quot;sweet new style&quot; of Dante and later Petrarca. Indeed, the most important poem of the Late Middle Ages, the allegorical &quot;Divine Comedy,&quot; is to a large degree a product of both the theology of Thomas Aquinas and the largely secular Occitan literature.

===Music===

The surviving music of the High Middle Ages is primarily religious in nature, since music notation developed in religious institutions, and the application of notation to secular music was a later development. Early in the period, Gregorian chant was the dominant form of church music; other forms, beginning with organum, and later including clausulae, conductus, and the motet, developed using the chant as source material.

During the 11th century, Guido of Arezzo was one of the first to develop musical notation, which made it easier for singers to remember Gregorian chants.

It was during the 12th and 13th centuries that Gregorian plainchant gave birth to polyphony, which appeared in the works of French Notre Dame School (Léonin and Pérotin). Later it evolved into the &quot;ars nova&quot; (Philippe de Vitry, Guillaume de Machaut) and the musical genres of late Middle Ages. An important composer during the 12th century was the nun Hildegard of Bingen.

The most significant secular movement was that of the troubadours, who arose in Occitania (Southern France) in the late 11th century. The troubadours were often itinerant, came from all classes of society, and wrote songs on a variety of topics, though with a particular focus on courtly love. Their style went on to influence the trouvères of northern France, the minnesingers of Germany, and the composers of secular music of the Trecento in northern Italy.

===Theatre===

Economic and political changes in the High Middle Ages led to the formation of guilds and the growth of towns, and this would lead to significant changes for theatre starting in this time and continuing into the Late Middle Ages. Trade guilds began to perform plays, usually religiously based, and often dealing with a biblical story that referenced their profession. For instance, a baker&#x27;s guild would perform a reenactment of the Last Supper. In the British Isles, plays were produced in some 127 different towns during the Middle Ages. These vernacular Mystery plays were written in cycles of a large number of plays: York (48 plays), Chester (24), Wakefield (32) and Unknown (42). A larger number of plays survive from France and Germany in this period and some type of religious dramas were performed in nearly every European country in the Late Middle Ages. Many of these plays contained comedy, devils, villains and clowns.

There were also a number of secular performances staged in the Middle Ages, the earliest of which is &quot;The Play of the Greenwood&quot; by Adam de la Halle in 1276. It contains satirical scenes and folk material such as faeries and other supernatural occurrences. Farces also rose dramatically in popularity after the 13th century. The majority of these plays come from France and Germany and are similar in tone and form, emphasizing sex and bodily excretions.

<text>Sawbridgeworth (traditionally or , now also ) is a town and civil parish in Hertfordshire, England, close to the border with Essex. It is east of Hertford and north of Epping. It is the northernmost part of the Greater London Built-up Area.

== History ==

Prior to the Norman conquest, most of the area was owned by the Anglo-Saxon Angmar the Staller.

The Manor of &quot;Sabrixteworde&quot; (one of the many spellings previously associated with the town) was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086. After the Battle of Hastings it was granted to Geoffrey de Mandeville I by William the Conqueror. Local notables have included John Leventhorpe, an executor of both King Henry IV and King Henry V&#x27;s wills, and Anne Boleyn, who was given the Pishiobury/Pishobury estate, located to the south of the town.

The Great Hyde Hall mansion and surrounding land was acquired by Sir Walter Lawrence, the master builder, in the 1920s. In 1934, he instituted the Walter Lawrence Trophy for the fastest century in county cricket. He built a cricket ground and pavilion in the grounds where the great and the good of the cricket world came to play against Sir Walter&#x27;s home team, which often included his three sons: Jim, Guy and Pat. Sir Walter also had two daughters: Molly and Gipsy. Great Hyde Hall was sold in 1945 and became a school. It is a Grade II* listed building and has now been divided into housing.

Much of the town centre is a conservation area; many of the buildings date from the Tudor, Stuart and Georgian periods.

Great St Mary&#x27;s Church is a Grade I listed building; &quot;of special interest as a substantially unaltered large medieval parish church, typical of the Hertfordshire type, and with an outstanding collection of memorials of the highest artistic quality&quot;. It was built in the 13th century (although a church on the site existed in Saxon times) and includes a Tudor tower containing a clock bell (1664) and eight ringing bells, the oldest of which dates from 1749. It is thought to be called &#x27;Great&#x27; St Mary&#x27;s to distinguish it from St Mary&#x27;s, Gilston. Ralph Jocelyn of Hyde Hall, who was Lord Mayor of London in 1464 and in 1476, is buried here; images of many of his family and other locals have been engraved on brass, and the church is popular for enthusiasts of brass rubbing. The ghost of Sir John Jocelyn, known for his love of horses, is reputed to appear riding a white horse on the old carriage drive every 1 November.

The town&#x27;s prosperity came from the maltings, some of which now house antiques centres. Among the maltsters were George Fawbert and John Barnard; in 1839 they set up the Fawbert and Barnard charity to fund local children and their education, funding a local infant school that still exists today.

By the time of the Norman conquest, or soon after, Sawbridgeworth&#x27;s rich farming land was fully developed for cultivation as was possible with the means available at the time: it was the richest village community in the county. Many important medieval families had estates here. The land was divided among them, into a number of manors or distinct estates; the lord of each manor had rights not only over this land but also over the people who farmed it. The number of manors increased during the Middle Ages, by a process of subinfeudation, that is the granting out of a part of an existing manor to a new owner so that the new manor was created. Many manors sprang from the original Domesday Book holding of the de Mandeville family. The first came to be called Sayesbury manor, from the de Say family who inherited it from the de Mandevilles in 1189. The many important people who held these manors built themselves houses with hunting parks around them; when they died their tombs enriched the parish church, so that today St Mary&#x27;s has one of the finest collections of church monuments in the country.

During the Second World War RAF Sawbridgeworth, which is not in the civil parish, operated Supermarine Spitfires, Westland Lysanders, North American Mustangs and de Havilland Mosquito, among other types - for a complete history of the airfield, see the book &quot;Where the Lysanders were ...&quot;, by Paul Doyle, published in 1995 by Forward Airfield Research Publishing. The Walter Lawrence &amp; Son Ltd joinery works, located between the canal and the railway, built over 1,000 Mosquito fuselage shells and wing skins for de Havilland during the Second World War. Subsequently, it reverted to making joinery and doors for the building trade. The joinery works was closed in about 1982 and houses were built on the site.

Sawbridgeworth was the birthplace of composer Bernard Rose (1916–1996) and the actor Stephen Greif (1944–2022).

Sawbridgeworth has been twinned with Bry-sur-Marne in France since 1973, and Moosburg an der Isar in Germany since 2018.

==Governance==
===Parliamentary representation===
Sawbridgeworth is in the parliamentary constituency of Hertford and Stortford. Since the formation of the constituency in 1983 until recently, it has elected Tory Members of Parliament. At the most recent general election of 2024, it finally changed hands to the Labour Party with the current MP being Josh Dean.

===Local government===
Sawbridgeworth has three tiers of local government, at parish (town), district, and county level: Sawbridgeworth Town Council, East Hertfordshire District Council, and Hertfordshire County Council. The town council has twelve councillors. The hamlet of Spellbrook is included within the administrative boundaries of the town.

===Town mayors===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Sawbridgeworth, and is usually held by a different councillor each year. Full Council meetings are chaired by the Mayor. The Mayors since 2012 have been:

The parish of Sawbridgeworth was in the hundred of Braughing. From 1835 the parish was included in the Bishop&#x27;s Stortford Poor Law Union. It therefore became part of the Bishop&#x27;s Stortford Rural Sanitary District in 1872. Under the Local Government Act 1894 elected parish and district councils were created. Sawbridgeworth Parish Council came into office on 31 December 1894, and the parish was included in the Hadham Rural District. Sawbridgeworth was made an urban district on 1 April 1901, making it independent of the Hadham Rural District. It was decided that the whole parish of Sawbridgeworth was not suitable for becoming an urban district, and so the more rural western part of the parish was made a separate parish called High Wych on the same day, which remained in the Hadham Rural District.

Until 1914 Sawbridgeworth Urban District Council met at offices on Bell Street (sometimes called Cock Street). In 1914 the council moved to the upper floor of the town&#x27;s fire station at 5 Church Street, which had been built in 1905. In 1937 the council built itself new offices on The Forebury, holding its first meeting in the new building on 5 July 1937.

Sawbridgeworth Urban District Council was granted a coat of arms on 20 July 1962.

The urban district was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, becoming part of East Hertfordshire on 1 April 1974. A successor parish (and Sawbridgeworth Town Council) was created for the former urban district. The urban district council&#x27;s former offices on The Forebury are now used as the town&#x27;s library, whilst Sawbridgeworth Town Council is based at Sayesbury Manor on Bell Street.

===Fire service===
The town has an on-call fire station, in Station Road, with one fire engine. Sawbridgeworth had its own fire brigade from 1897 until it was merged into the National Fire Service in 1941. In 1948 control of the local fire brigade passed to the Hertfordshire Fire Brigade, since renamed the Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue Service, run by Hertfordshire County Council.

==Geography==
Sawbridgeworth adjoins the border between Hertfordshire and Essex. The village of Lower Sheering is across the county boundary into Essex, and adjoins Sawbridgeworth along its eastern edge, east of the railway station and of the River Stort. It has a Sawbridgeworth postal address, but is in the Epping Forest District of Essex.

==Geology==
Underlying the town at some depth is the London Clay stratum, with a thick layer of Boulder clay laid down during the ice ages, including the Anglian. The soil on top of this is a loam, with glacial erratics of Hertfordshire puddingstone conglomerate found around the town.

== Education ==

<text>John Stafford, 1st Earl of Wiltshire , (24 November 1427 – 8 May 1473) was an English nobleman, the youngest son of Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham. In 1461 he was appointed Knight of the Order of the Bath.

==Career==
He fought on the Yorkist side at the Battle of Hexham in 1464. In 1469, he was made Steward of the Duchy of Cornwall for life. He was made Earl of Wiltshire on 5 January 1470 by King Edward IV, and was briefly arrested under Warwick&#x27;s government and prevented from attending the Parliament of November 1470 (he was one of six Yorkist nobles not to receive a summons). 

In return for his loyalty he was made Chief Butler of England, and was empowered, with Lord Mountjoy to pardon rebels who surrendered by 7 June that year. He was made a Knight of the Garter in 1472.

==Diplomacy==
He did act for some time as a diplomat, working with the Earl of Northumberland to deal with ambassadors of James III of Scotland about national grievances.

==Personal life==
He married Constance Green, daughter of Sir Henry Green of Drayton House Northamptonshire and Margaret de Ros. They only had one child, Edward, who succeeded him as Earl of Wiltshire, although during the latter&#x27;s minority he was kept as a ward of the King, meaning revenues from his estates were paid to the Crown.

<text>Germain (; 496 – 28 May 576) was the bishop of Paris and is venerated as a saint in both the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church. According to an early biography, he was known as Germain d&#x27;Autun, rendered in modern times as the &quot;Father of the Poor&quot;.

==Biography==
Germain was born near Autun in what is now France, under Burgundian control 20 years after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, to noble Gallo-Roman parents. Germain studied at Avallon in Burgundy and at Luzy under the guidance of his cousin Scallion, who was a priest. At the age of 35, he was ordained by Agrippinus of Autun and became abbot of the nearby Abbey of St. Symphorian. He was known for his hardworking and austere nature; however, it was his generous alms-giving which caused his monks to fear that one day he would give away all the wealth of the abbey, resulting in their rebellion against him. While in Paris in 555, Sibelius, the bishop of Paris, died, and Charibert I had him consecrated as the bishop of Paris.

Under Germain&#x27;s influence, Childebert is said to have led a reformed life. In his new role, the bishop continued to practice the virtues and austerities of his monastic life, working to diminish the suffering caused by the incessant wars. He attended the Third and Fourth Councils of Paris (557, 573) and also the Second Council of Tours (566). He persuaded the king to stamp out the pagan practices existing in Gaul and to forbid the excess that accompanied the celebration of most Christian festivals.

Childebert was succeeded briefly by Clotaire, who divided the royal demesnes among his four sons, with Charibert becoming King of Paris. Germain was forced to excommunicate Charibert in 568 for immorality. Charibert died in 570. As his surviving brothers fought violently over his possessions, the bishop encountered great difficulty trying to establish peace, with little success. Sigebert and Chilperic, instigated by their wives, Brunehaut and the infamous Fredegund, went to war. Chilperic was defeated, and Paris fell into Sigebert&#x27;s hands. Germain later wrote to Brunehaut, asking her to use her influence to prevent further war. However, Sigebert refused and, despite Germain&#x27;s warning, set out to attack Chilperic at Tournai. Chilperic had fled, and Sigebert was later assassinated at Vitry in 575, under Fredegund&#x27;s orders. Germain died the following year, before peace was restored.

For nine centuries, in times of plague and crisis, his relics were carried in procession through the streets of Paris.

Two stained-glass panels depicting scenes from the life of Germain are in the Metropolitan Museum of Art&#x27;s Cloisters Collection in New York.

==Abbey church of Saint-Germain-des-Prés==
During his war on Spain in the year 542, King Childebert besieged Zaragoza. Upon hearing that the inhabitants had placed themselves under the protection of the martyr Vincent of Saragossa, Childebert raised his siege and spared the city. In gratitude, the bishop of Zaragoza presented him with Vincent&#x27;s stole. When Childebert returned to Paris, he caused a church to be erected to receive the relic. In 558 St. Vincent&#x27;s church was completed and dedicated by Germain on 23 December; on the very same day, Childebert died. A monastery was erected near the church. Its abbots had both spiritual and temporal jurisdiction over the suburbs of Saint-Germain until about the year 1670. The church was frequently plundered and set on fire by the Normans in the ninth century. It was rebuilt in 1014 and dedicated in 1163 by Pope Alexander III.

There is a treatise on the ancient Gallican liturgy that has traditionally been attributed to Germain. The poet Venantius Fortunatus, from whom Germain commissioned a &quot;Vita Sancti Marcelli&quot;, wrote a eulogy of his life. 

Germain&#x27;s body lay for two centuries in a tomb chamber in the chapel of Saint Symphorian, in the &quot;atrium&quot; or forecourt of the church of Saint Vincent outside the walls of Paris. The translation of his relics to a more prominent and typically Frankish position within the main church, &quot;retro altare&quot;, was effected in 756 and was prompted by his appearing in a vision to a pious woman. The church was reconsecrated as Saint-Germain-des-Prés. Fortunatus had visited Germain in Paris and was disappointed so described the work as &quot;nothing but a string of miracles&quot;. Germain, according to Venantius had performed his first miracle in the womb, preventing his mother from performing an abortion.

Germain&#x27;s feast day is appointed as 28 May, and his translation as 25 July.

==Legacy==
The commune Saint-Germain-en-Laye, a suburb of Paris, is named after him, as well as the former Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés and Saint-Germain de Charonne which are both located in the city proper of Paris.

<text>Ware is a town and civil parish in the East Hertfordshire district, in the county of Hertfordshire, England. It is close to the county town of Hertford. In the 2021 Census, the parish had a population of 19,622

==History==
Archaeology has shown that Ware has been occupied since at least the Mesolithic period (which ended in about 4000 BC). The Romans had a sizeable settlement here and foundations of several buildings, including a temple, and two cemeteries have been found. Ware was on Ermine Street, the Roman road from London to Lincoln. A well-preserved Roman skeleton of a teenage girl was found beside the road and nicknamed &#x27;Ermintrude&#x27;. It has been said that Ware is one of the oldest continuously occupied sites in Europe.

In the Domesday Book of 1086, the town was named &quot;Waras&quot; from the natural weirs in the River Lea. The historic rivalry with nearby Hertford can be traced to 1090 when the Lady of Ware (Petronilla de Grandmesnil, Countess of Leicester) diverted Ermine Street from the Roman ford to create a High Street and new bridge over the Lea. The bailiff of Hertford tried to destroy the new bridge before it was recognised as part of the King&#x27;s Highway by Henry III in person. In 1381, during the so-called Peasants&#x27; Revolt, 42 prominent Ware townsmen, led by the Vicar, joined others in destroying Hertford Castle, then owned by John of Gaunt. Many inns were established in the High Street, reflecting Ware&#x27;s importance as a coaching stop on the &quot;Old North Road&quot;. Chaucer mentioned Ware twice in &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;. The Great Bed of Ware, cited by Shakespeare and other playwrights, was housed in a succession of Ware inns.

Mary I had Thomas Fust burned at the stake in Ware marketplace for refusing to convert to Catholicism.

In the 17th century, Ware became the source of the New River, constructed to take fresh water into London. The Ware Mutiny occurred on 15 November 1647, between the First and the Second English Civil War at Corkbush Field, when soldiers were ordered to sign a declaration of loyalty to Thomas Fairfax, the commander-in-chief of the New Model Army (NMA), and the Army Council. When some with Leveller sympathies refused to do this they were arrested and court-martialled; one of the ringleaders, Trooper Richard Arnold, was shot. 62 children were sent to Ware after the 1666 Great Fire of London. In 1683, the Rye House Plot involved assassinating Charles II after he passed through Ware. It failed.

England&#x27;s first turnpike (toll) road was established at Wadesmill, two miles north of Ware, in 1633 in an attempt to control the malting traffic into and from Ware. The town had become a major maltmaking centre during the Civil War and soon became the most important supplier of malt to the Common Brewers of London, with its own quoted price on the London grain market, particularly for brown malt, used in brewing porter beer. The Ordnance Survey First Edition of 1880 showed 107 malt kilns in Ware, more than twice as many as in any other Hertfordshire town. The last working malting in Ware, Pauls Malt at Broadmeads, closed in 1994. In November 1999, the bronze Maltmaker statue by Oxfordshire sculptor, Jill Tweed, was unveiled outside St Mary&#x27;s Church to commemorate the end of the industry and the Millennium. The unveiling was done by Hugo Page Croft, member of a famous Ware malting family; others involved in the project were Guy Horlock, chairman of the Stanstead Abbots maltsters, French &amp; Jupps Ltd, and David Perman, curator of the Ware Museum.

Two legends associated with the 17th century are sometimes mentioned. One is that bargemen born in Ware were given the &quot;freedom of the River Thames&quot; — avoiding the requirement of paying lock dues — as a result of their transport of fresh water and food in during the Great Plague of London of 1665–66. In fact, Ware barges were freed from having to carry a pilot in the Port of London as a result of their relieving the Dutch blockade of the Thames in 1667, by bringing in coal brought overland from the Wash. The other legend is that Ware bargemen brought plague bodies out of London in 1666 and interred them at the Buryfield. The truth is that the Burymead was mentioned as early as 1513 and referred to the present Glaxo site where a number of Roman cemeteries have been found; the Buryfield Recreation Ground was established in 1931 on charity land, the Bell Close, now partly covered by the GSK multi-storey car park.

At the end of the 19th century, malt-making in Ware was joined by two other industries. In 1886, Dennis Wickham, member of a brewing family, established a bottling plant which in 1900 moved to Viaduct Road and became an engineering company. The firm of D. Wickham &amp; Co. became manufacturers of railcars and construction equipment, closing in 1991. In 1898, the pharmaceutical company, Allen &amp; Hanburys, acquired a lease on the Ware corn mill and began building a medicines, dried milk and health foods factory at the nearby Buryfield. A new plant for pharmaceutical research and development was built in Park Road during World War II. Allenburys, as it was known, was merged with Glaxo in 1958 and is now part of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).

The Ware Town Council coat of arms was issued in 1956 by the College of Arms to Ware Urban District Council, and transferred to Ware Town Council in 1975. The arms are derived from matters with which Ware is associated — the barge rudders reference the bargemen of Ware, with the red and white striping on the rudders being the livery colours of the City of London, associating the Ware bargemen&#x27;s free entry rights to that City; the crossed coach horns reference the town&#x27;s long history as a coaching town; and the sheaves of barley reference the malting history of Ware. The motto &quot;cave&quot; (Latin for &quot;beware&quot;) was suggested by the College of Heralds, with the intent of its being a pun on the town&#x27;s name.

==Features==
Ware has 202 listed buildings including fourteen Grade II* and three Grade I, one of which is the remains of a 14th-century friary, now the offices of Ware Town Council and a conference, wedding and function venue called Ware Priory and Fletcher&#x27;s Lea. Recent restoration work has shown that it dates from the 13th century. Opposite the priory is the large 14th-century St Mary&#x27;s parish church. It is known for its elaborate font with large carved stone figures. The town is also famous for its many 18th-century riverside gazebos, several of which have been restored recently.

The Lee Navigation is a canalised river incorporating the River Lea, which runs through the centre of the town; it is one of its most popular tourist attractions, as well as being home to a thriving boating community.

Ware is also known for the Great Bed of Ware, which is mentioned in Shakespeare&#x27;s Twelfth Night and is reputedly able to accommodate at least four couples. It is in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, but from April 2012 until April 2013 it was loaned to the museum in Ware.

Ware is mentioned in &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; and was also the unintended destination of John Gilpin in William Cowper&#x27;s comic poem.

Some of the buildings along the High Street date back to the 14th century. Ware used to have many coaching inns and passageways between some shops lead to their stables. Many of these passageways also have former maltings. Crib Street has a good sequence of timber-framed buildings which have been restored since the 1970s.
Today the town&#x27;s main employer is GlaxoSmithKline, which has large manufacturing and research plants in the town. The Ware company was formerly &#x27; Allen &amp; Hanburys&quot; and has a long connection with the town, with many historical items on view in a section on the company in the Ware Museum. There are also many other small factories.

Fairport Convention&#x27;s 1971 album &quot;&quot;Babbacombe&quot; Lee&quot; was inspired by an old newspaper story that fiddle player Dave Swarbrick bought in an antiques shop in the High Street of Ware when the band lived at The Angel former public house in nearby Little Hadham.
==Places of interest==
===Ware Museum===
Ware has its own museum which, in 2008, received full accreditation from the Museums, Archives and Libraries Council. The museum is independent and run completely by volunteers. In 2012–2013, Ware Museum was home to the Great Bed of Ware on loan for one year from The Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The bed is reputedly haunted by the ghost of its alleged maker, Jonas Fosbrooke, who is said to harass any non-royal person who attempts to sleep in the bed.

The museum is partially housed in the former Priory Lodge and partly inside a Second World War Command Bunker used to co-ordinate local defences and respond to air-raids; this part was refurbished for 2010. The museum contains many interesting items from the history of Ware, including Roman archaeology, exhibits relating to the Second World War and Allen &amp; Hanburys pharmaceuticals. There are also a number of exhibits for children and many special activity days throughout the year.

===Scott&#x27;s Grotto===
Ware is home to Scott&#x27;s Grotto, built for John Scott, an 18th-century poet who owned Amwell House from 1768. The grotto, the largest in the UK, is a series of chambers extending over 65 ft into the chalk hillside. The chambers are decorated with shells, stones such as flint and coloured glass. The grotto was restored in 1990 by the Ware Society and is now owned and managed by the Scott&#x27;s Grotto Trust; it is Grade I listed.

===Bluecoat Yard===
In Bluecoat Yard is Place House, Ware&#x27;s oldest extant surviving building. It dates from the early 14th century, with additions in the 16th and 17th centuries, and was once Ware&#x27;s Manor House. It has a crown post roof.

==Governance==
Ware has three tiers of local government, at parish (town), district and county level: Ware Town Council, East Hertfordshire District Council, and Hertfordshire County Council.

Historically, the parish of Ware was included in the hundred of Braughing. Prior to the 16th century Ware was sometimes called a borough, but it never had a borough charter from the monarch nor sent members to Parliament.

The town was given improvement commissioners in 1811 to pave and light the streets. In 1835 Ware became the centre of a poor law union, and the Ware Union Workhouse was built in 18391840 on Collett Road (then called Musley Lane).

The town was made a local board district on 1 August 1849. The local board replaced the improvement commissioners and had more extensive powers, particularly regarding sewerage and water supply. The local board of health district covered the built-up part of the parish of Ware plus an area known as Amwell End, a southern suburb of the town which was in the neighbouring parish of Great Amwell. After elections, the Ware Local Board held its first meeting on 1 September 1849 at the boardroom of the Ware Union Workhouse, when William Parker was appointed the first chairman of the board.

Under the Local Government Act 1894, the Ware Local Board became Ware Urban District Council on 31 December 1894. The Act also directed that parishes could not straddle urban and rural districts, and so the parish of Ware was split with effect from 4 December 1894 into two parishes: Ware Urban for the part within the urban district, and Ware Rural for the part outside it. Ware Rural parish was included in the Ware Rural District and was renamed Wareside in 1991.

Ware Urban District Council was initially based at the Town Hall at 8 West Street (not to be confused with the former cornmarket that had previously been called Town Hall at 70 High Street overlooking the market place). The Town Hall on West Street comprised an early eighteenth house on the street frontage, behind which were a large public hall and meeting rooms which had been built in 1867, initially as a Corn Exchange. The Corn Exchange business failed in 1875. The following year the building was bought by a new company called the Ware Town Hall and Assembly Rooms Company. The urban district council rented rooms there to serve as its offices and meeting place.

In 1920, the urban district council was effectively given Ware Priory; its owner, Anne Elizabeth Croft, gave the council a 999year lease at a nominal rent of 3 shillings a year. The council then used Ware Priory as its offices and meeting place until its abolition. Most of the former Town Hall at 8 West Street was demolished in the 1950s, retaining only the original house at the front, which is now known as &quot;Rankin House&quot;.

Ware Urban District Council was granted a coat of arms on 26 March 1956.

Ware Urban District was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, merging with other districts to become East Hertfordshire on 1 April 1974. A successor parish was created covering the former urban district of Ware, with its parish council taking the name Ware Town Council. Ware Town Council is now based at The Priory.

==Transport==
Ware railway station is a stop on the Hertford East Branch Line; its close proximity to London makes Ware a commuter town. Greater Anglia operates two trains per hour in each direction between and , with additional services at peak times.

Bus services are provided primarily by Arriva Herts &amp; Essex, Central Connect and Centrebus (South), connecting the town with Hatfield, Hertford, Stevenage, Welwyn Garden City and Heathrow Airport.

The town lies on the north–south A10 road which is partly shared with the east–west A414 (for Hertford to the west and Harlow to the east). There is a large viaduct over the River Lea at Kings Meads. The £3.6m two-mile bypass opened on 17 January 1979. The former route of the A10 through the town is now the A1170.

==Education facilities==

<text>Chlothar (Latin &quot;Chlotharius&quot;; Greek &quot;Khlōthários&quot; Χλωθάριος; French &quot;Clotaire&quot;) is a Germanic given name, attested in Old English as &quot;Hloþhere&quot;, in Old High German as &quot;Lothari&quot; (Lothair, Lothar), and reconstructed in Frankish as *&quot;Hlodhari&quot;. It means &quot;famous warrior&quot;, as a combination of the Germanic root &quot;hlut-&quot; (lauded, famous) and the word &quot;heri&quot; (army, warrior).

It can refer to the following kings of the Franks:

* Chlothar I (497–561)
* Chlothar II (584–629)
* Chlothar III (652–673)
* Chlothar IV (died 719)

<text>Huáscar is an ironclad turret ship owned by the Chilean Navy built in 1865 for the Peruvian government. It is named after the 16th-century Inca emperor, Huáscar. She was the flagship of the Peruvian Navy and participated in the Battle of Pacocha and the War of the Pacific of 1879–1883. At the Battle of Angamos, &quot;Huáscar&quot;, captained by renowned Peruvian naval officer Miguel Grau Seminario, was captured by the Chilean fleet and commissioned into the Chilean Navy. 

Today &quot;Huáscar&quot; is one of the few surviving ships of her type. She has been restored and is a memorial ship anchored in Talcahuano, Chile. &quot;Huáscar&quot; is the second oldest armored warship afloat after , and the oldest monitor afloat.

== Technical details ==
Captain Cowper Coles, wrote of &quot;Huáscar&quot;: &quot;...as a sea-going vessel of 1,100 tons, 300-horse power, and a speed of 12 1/4 knots. Her foremast is fitted with tripods; she carries two 300-pounders in one turret.&quot; And &quot;...the &quot;Huascar&quot; class of 1865 fitted with a hurricane deck; she was one of six different classes designed and built by Messrs. Laird Brothers, to whom the credit for their great success is due. She can fire right ahead from her 300-pounders, and aft within 15 degrees of the line of keel, but would have a stern chaser either on or under her poop.&quot;

The British magazine &quot;Engineering&quot; described it: &quot;She is an armour-clad monitor built by Messrs. Laird Brothers, of Birkenhead, in 1866... She is 190 ft. in length between perpendiculars, 35 ft. in extreme breadth, and 19 ft. 9 in. in depth of hold. Her builder&#x27;s tonnage is 1101, and indicated horse power 1500. Her draught of water is 15 ft. 6 in., and her maximum speed is said to be 12 knots when her boilers are in good condition, and the bottom is clean. Her usual speed under good working conditions is probably not more than 10 1/2 to 11 knots. She is propelled by a single screw. The Huascar is a rigged two-masted vessel, the foremast being upon Captain Cole&#x27;s tripod principle. Her freeboard, or height of deck above water, is about 5 ft. She carries two 300-pounder Armstrong guns in one turret, which is protected by 5 1/2-in. armour plating upon a teak backing of 14 in. The sides are protected by armour plating 4 1/2 in. thick amidships, tapering to 2 1/2 in. at the extremities, which is also worked upon a teak backing of 14 in. There is an armoured pilot tower of hexagonal form abaft the turret from which the ship is worked in action; and the openings in the deck are protected by 2-in. iron plates that are shipped in the openings for skylights or hatchways. The Huascar is an iron-built vessel, and at the time she was built was most perfect in all the appliances of defence, and in her internal arrangements.&quot;

==Career in Peruvian Navy==
===First years===

&quot;Huáscar&quot; was ordered by the Peruvian government from the British shipbuilder John Laird Sons &amp; Company in 1864 for the war against Spain. Laird House had extensive experience of these advanced ships, designing and building the &quot;Laird ram&quot;s. She was built for a price slightly more than £81,000, and launched in Birkenhead on 7 October 1865.

Commanded by Peruvian-Chilean Captain José María Salcedo, a naval officer in service of the Peruvian government, who had supervised construction on behalf of the Peruvian Navy she left for Peru on 20 January 1866 on a trip that saw some trouble: a month-long wait at Brest, a minor collision with the ironclad &quot;Independencia&quot; on 28 February, refusal of service by neutral countries, a month of repairs at Rio de Janeiro, insubordination by &quot;Independencia&quot;&#x27;s commander and the capture and sinking of the Spanish brigantine &quot;Manuel&quot;. When she finally arrived in port at Ancud in allied Chile to join the rest of the combined fleet on 7 June, it was too late for her to participate in the conflict.

Under Captain Lizardo Montero, &quot;Huáscar&quot; prepared at Valparaíso to participate in a late 1866 expedition to fight the Spanish fleet in the Philippines. However Montero, with several other Peruvian officers, objected to plans for Rear Admiral John R. Tucker –formerly a commander of Confederate warships during the American Civil War – to command the fleet, and requested to be relieved. Captain Salcedo took back command of &quot;Huáscar&quot;, but the expedition was eventually cancelled.

In February 1868, Peruvian naval officer Miguel Grau took command of &quot;Huáscar&quot; and would remain in command until 1876, becoming her longest-serving commander. His long years aboard the ironclad would prove very valuable later and he would also become Peru&#x27;s most renowned naval officer.

===Peruvian Civil War===

&quot;Huáscar&quot; participated in Nicolás de Piérola&#x27;s 1877 attempt to overthrow the Peruvian government. On the 6 May, two of de Piérola&#x27;s supporters, Colonel Lorranaga and Major Echenique, boarded the &quot;Huáscar&quot; at the port of Callao while the captain and executive officer where ashore. Some of the ship&#x27;s officers on board were part of the plot and persuaded the crew to join their cause. Now in rebel hands, the &quot;Huáscar&quot; put to sea with Luis Germán Astete in command. Other Peruvian naval ships present in the port, such as the &quot;Atahualpa&quot; were in a state of disrepair and unable to pursue. The ship was used to harass, sabotage and disrupt government forces and shipping lanes. During these actions foreign shipping was also affected, leading to British intervention.

On 29 May 1877, she fought the inconclusive Battle of Pacocha against two British vessels, the frigate HMS &quot;Shah&quot; and the corvette HMS &quot;Amethyst&quot;, commanded by Admiral Algernon Frederick Rous de Horsey. This battle saw the first use in combat of the newly invented self-propelled torpedo which, at the time, had just entered limited service with the Royal Navy. &quot;Huáscar&quot; surrendered to the government after almost one month in rebel hands.

===War of the Pacific===

&quot;Huáscar&quot; participated in the War of the Pacific (1879–1883), initially in the service of Peru. Once again under the command of Captain Grau, she became famous for daring harassment raids on Chilean ports and transports. As a result, during the opening months of the war, the ground invasion was delayed for almost six months until the Chilean fleet could find and stop &quot;Huáscar&quot;.

On 21 May 1879 &quot;Huáscar&quot; led the lifting of the Chilean blockade of Iquique. During the Battle of Iquique, the Chilean captain of the corvette &quot;Esmeralda&quot;, Arturo Prat, was killed on &quot;Huáscar&quot;&#x27;s deck. After sinking the corvette by repeated ramming, &quot;Huáscar&quot; rescued the survivors, then continued pursuit of a fleeing enemy ship, the &quot;Covadonga&quot;.

During the next 137 days &quot;Huáscar&quot; not only evaded confrontation with the enemy fleet, following orders from the Peruvian government, but made the coast insecure for Chilean transport ships. Her biggest prize was the Chilean gunned transport &quot;Rímac&quot; with 260 men of the cavalry regiment &quot;Carabineers of Yungay&quot;.

Determined to secure the supply lines needed for the invasion of Perú, the Chileans committed every possible unit to hunt down &quot;Huáscar&quot;. On 8 October 1879 &quot;Huáscar&quot; was captured by the Chilean Navy under the command of Galvarino Riveros Cárdenas at the Battle of Angamos, during which Rear Admiral Grau and 32 of her crew of 200 were killed.

==Career with Chilean Navy==
===War of the Pacific===
After the Battle of Angamos, &quot;Huáscar&quot; entered the service of the Chilean Navy. At Arica she fought a duel with the Peruvian monitor &quot;Manco Cápac&quot; while participating in the bombardment of the city –where her new commander Manuel Thomson was killed– and she also aided in the blockade of Callao.

===After the war===
After the war, in 1885 and 1887, &quot;Huáscar&quot; was renovated, including renewal of boilers, new screw design, and all-new steam engines to move the gun and artillery turrets.

In May 1888, as part of a ceremonial division commanded by Rear Admiral Luis Uribe, &quot;Huáscar&quot; brought the bodies of the officers of the &quot;Esmeralda&quot; from their graves at Iquique to a new burial place at Valparaíso. These were the same officers killed on &quot;Huáscar&quot;&#x27;s deck at the Battle of Iquique; Rear Admiral Uribe had been the executive officer aboard &quot;Esmeralda&quot; and a survivor of the battle.

===Chilean Civil War===
&quot;Huáscar&quot; participated in the 1891 Chilean Civil War between government and congress. Undergoing major maintenance work at the onset of the war, she was seized and towed out of Valparaíso by the rebel-leaning navy, and readied for action within three days.

Commanded by Captain José María Santa Cruz, she participated in the takeover of the port city of Taltal by the rebels, ran escort duty for convoys and protected rebel-held ports. She returned once more to the port of Iquique, this time to bombard the port city held by government forces. After almost eight months of fighting, the war ended with the government&#x27;s surrender.

===Postwar===
&quot;Huáscar&quot; continued serving the Chilean Navy until a boiler explosion in 1897 at the Talcahuano military harbour resulted in her decommissioning. Partially repaired, she later served as the first submarine tender in the Chilean Navy from 1917 to 1930.

In the early 1930s &quot;Huáscar&quot; was taken in hand for reconditioning as a heritage ship. Recommissioned in 1934, &quot;Huáscar&quot; was now armed with two 8-inch guns, three 4.7 inch guns and four 47 mm guns. It now wore the flag of the Port Admiral at Talcahuano. As late as 1949 she was listed in &quot;Jane&#x27;s Fighting Ships&quot; as a coast defense ship; the photograph of &quot;Huáscar&quot; in that year&#x27;s edition dated from 1938.

===Preservation as memorial ship===
When she was recommissioned in 1934, &quot;Huáscar&quot; was the oldest vessel of the Chilean Navy. Between 1951 and 1952, work was undertaken with the aim to completely restore her to her 1897 condition, when she finished her service in the Chilean Navy, and declare her a shrine to the glory of both the Peruvian and Chilean navies.

She became a floating museum and a memorial, displaying many objects and relics recovered from Navy warehouses or donated by private citizens from the Talcahuano and Concepción area, including:
* A shrine with portraits of the three commanders that lost their lives on her deck, set in the commander&#x27;s quarters.
* A portrait gallery in the boiler room.
* A prayer room, duly authorized by the Archbishop of Concepción

Between 1971 and 1972, a second restoration phase was undertaken at the Chilean Navy&#x27;s drydock in Talcahuano: the hull was completely repaired, and engines rebuilt according to original blueprints obtained in England. Since then, a strict maintenance program ensures survival and preservation for future generations.

In 1995, the World Ship Trust conferred the &quot;Maritime Heritage Award&quot; on the Chilean Navy for its restoration of &quot;Huáscar&quot;.
&quot;Huáscar&quot; is berthed at the port of Talcahuano, Chile. The Talcahuano Naval Base and Shipyards were devastated by the 2010 Chile earthquake and the resulting tsunami; although &quot;Huáscar&quot; was at the base then, she survived with no apparent damage and reopened to visitors in March 2011.

==Significance==
&quot;Huáscar&quot; is one of the few early-ironclad-era warships still afloat. &quot;Huáscar&quot; remains highly regarded in both Peru and Chile, being considered as the site where Peruvian Admiral of the Fleet Miguel Grau, and the Chilean Captains Arturo Prat and Manuel Thomson each lost their lives in naval combat.

<text>The University of Hertfordshire (UH) is a public university in Hertfordshire, United Kingdom. The university is based largely in Hatfield, Hertfordshire. Its antecedent institution, Hatfield Technical College, was founded in 1948 and was identified as one of 25 Colleges of Technology in the United Kingdom in 1959. In 1992, Hatfield Polytechnic was granted university status by the British government and subsequently renamed University of Hertfordshire. It is one of the post-1992 universities.

Hertfordshire is mainly based at two campuses – College Lane and de Havilland. The university has 9 schools: Hertfordshire Business School, Computer Science, Creative Arts, Education, Health and Social Work, Humanities (which oversees its computer-assisted training system, or CATS programme), Hertfordshire Law School, Life and Medical Sciences, Physics, Engineering and Computer Science and Hertfordshire Higher Education Consortium.

As of 2022, it has around 32,000 students, including more than 13,000 international students that together represent 100 countries, making the university host the highest proportion of international students (outside of London) in England. The university is one of Hertfordshire&#x27;s largest employers with over 3,400 staff, 2,045 of whom are academic members of staff. The annual income of the institution for 2021–22 was £317.5 million of which £9 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £305.3 million. Hertfordshire is a member of University Alliance, Universities UK and European University Association.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
The original campus for the university was at Roe Green in Hatfield, where it was founded as a technical college with a particular focus on training aerospace engineers for the aerospace industry that was then prevalent in Hatfield. The Gape family of St Michael&#x27;s Manor in St Albans owned the land at Roe Green from the late 17th century. In the 1920s they sold it to Hill, a farmer, who then sold it to Alan Butler, chairman of the de Havilland Aircraft Company who lived at Beech Farm nearby. In 1944 he donated of land at Roe Green to be used for educational purposes. In 1948 building commenced. The first principal W.A.J Chapman started on 1 January 1949, and in spring 1952 the 33 full-time and 66 part-time teachers were appointed. Hatfield Technical College opened with 1,738 students in September 1952, and in December it was formally opened by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. It was the first large technical college to be established in England after the war. Students attended the college on part-time or full-time courses.
In 1958 it was renamed Hatfield College of Technology, and by 1960 it offered four-year sandwich diplomas in technology. In 1961 it was designated a regional college in England and Wales by the Ministry of Education. The governors purchased a digital computer at a cost of £29,201 in 1962 so that a computer science degree could be established. The Council for National Academic Awards was formed in 1965 and Hatfield College was recognised for 13 honours degree courses.

Sir Norman Lindop became the Principal of the College of Technology in 1966. A year later L.E. Haines was made Chair of Governors, but he died shortly afterwards and was replaced by F. Bramston Austin. A year later, Bayfordbury was acquired for the college.

=== 20th century ===

In 1969 Hatfield College of Technology became Hatfield Polytechnic, offering honours degree courses in engineering and technology. In 1970 an observatory was built on the Bayfordbury Campus. Wall Hall and Balls Park Teacher Training Colleges merged in 1976 to become Hertfordshire College of Higher Education. In the same year Hatfield Polytechnic took over Balls Park. By 1977 more than ten per cent of the 4000 students came from more than forty different countries. The Students&#x27; Union Social Centre opened in 1977.

In 1982 John Illston succeeded Sir Norman Lindop as the director. A sports hall was built on the Hatfield Campus in 1984 and the number of students in that year was more than 5000. The number of staff, in the same year, had increased to 824.

Neil Buxton became its director in 1987. The following year, Sir Ron Dearing and Buxton signed an agreement that gave the polytechnic accreditation from the Council for National Academic Awards. Hatfield was one of only 21 polytechnics, colleges and Scottish Central institutions to be accredited at the time. Hatfield was also, in that year, one of eight polytechnics accredited for research degrees. In 1989 it was given corporate status.

After John Major announced in 1991 that polytechnics were to be abolished, Hatfield Polytechnic announced its intention to apply for university status. In 1992 it became the University of Hertfordshire and Sir Brian Corby became the first Chancellor. It was the first university to run a bus company by making Uno bus public. The Hertfordshire College of Health Care and Nursing Studies and the Barnet College of Nursing and Midwifery merged with the university in 1993.

In 1992, Hatfield Polytechnic was granted university status by the British government and subsequently renamed University of Hertfordshire. Its antecedent institution, Hatfield Technical College, was founded in 1948 and was identified as one of 25 Colleges of Technology in the United Kingdom in 1959.

In 2015, Hertfordshire adopted a policy of naming its buildings after people or organisations with a significant local or regional impact. These include Kate Bellingham, British engineer and television presenter and Alistair Spalding, chief executive and artistic director of Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre. All of the halls are named after influential alumni who the university feels represent the attributes of Hertfordshire graduates. In these two cases, the halls were named in recognition of Bellingham and Spalding&#x27;s attributes of intellectual depth and adaptability and professionalism, employability and enterprise. In the same year, the University of Hertfordshire was announced as one of the first recipients of the Race Equality Charter which is an initiative that recognises excellence in advancing racial equality in higher education. The charter was launched by the Equality Challenge Unit at the start of the 2015 academic year.

In 2020, the University of Hertfordshire Observatory celebrated its 50th anniversary, and revealed an eight-year-long exposure photograph, breaking the record of longest exposure. The artist, Regina Valkenborgh, was a Master&#x27;s student in August 2012, when she set the pinhole camera attached to one of the telescope domes in the Observatory. The camera was then forgotten, and rediscovered in September 2020 by the Observatory&#x27;s Principal Technical officer. The photograph registered the path of the sun over the sky during the 2,953 days it was exposed to it.

=== Academic dress ===
The University of Hertfordshire prescribes academic dress for its members. In accordance with tradition, Hertfordshire&#x27;s academic dress consists of a gown, a cap and a hood. The black gown and square cap familiar to all readers of the Beano had evolved into their present form in England by the end of the Reformation. The hood, which is now the distinctive mark of a university-level qualification, is medieval in origin, and was originally functional.

=== Ceremonial mace ===
The ceremonial mace was produced in 1999 by craftsman Martyn Pugh, a Freeman of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, member of the British Jewellers Association and a Founder Member of the Association of British Designer Silversmiths. Its design symbolises the university&#x27;s origins, expertise and associations. Its shape is inspired by the shape of an aeroplane wing symbolising the university&#x27;s origin in the aviation industry. The head of the mace is engraved with zodiac symbols representing the university&#x27;s contribution to astronomy and also contains the DNA double helix representing the biological sciences and microprocessor chips representing information and communications technology.

=== Kaspar ===
Kaspar, a social robot, has been designed by the University of Hertfordshire&#x27;s Adaptive Systems Research Group (ASRG). The Kaspar project began in 2005, drawing upon previous researches to develop a social robot for engaging autistic children in a variety of play scenarios. The aim was to research whether interacting and communicating with Kaspar would help children with autism interact and communicate more easily with people. This is important because there is mounting evidence that early intervention for children with autism may change the child&#x27;s development trajectory. Kaspar is a research tool with programmed responses adapted to be used by an autistic child in a safe, non-judgemental environment. The Kaspar research has shown that robots may provide a safe and predictable tool for children with autism, that enables the children to learn social interaction and communication skills, addressing specific therapeutic and educational objectives (for example, being able to engage in direct eye-contact or shared eye-gaze), in an enjoyable play context.

=== Rocket powered car ===

Hertfordshire operates a regular shuttle bus service, Park and Ride, which connects 800 parking spaces at Angerland Common with its College Lane and de Havilland Campus facilities. The scheme started in 2006, when it is initially provided with the 700-car facility at Angerland Common, off South Way, Hatfield, in a bid to get cars off surrounding roads.

Since 2006, the university has planned on opening a second venue, with 150 spaces, at the south side car park at Stanborough Lakes in Welwyn Garden City. This second park and ride site was used for a brief time in 2009 served by bus service 692. It was withdrawn due to lack of use.

== Student life ==

The main source of nightlife is the Forum, which houses three entertainment spaces, a restaurant, a café, multiple bars and onsite parking. Hertfordshire Students&#x27; Union (HSU) is the Students&#x27; Union of the University of Hertfordshire. The Students&#x27; Union Social Centre was opened in 1977. The Hatfield Technical College&#x27;s management encouraged the establishment of a Student Representative Council (SRC) in 1982, to create a sense of unity and expand the social activities of its day students. The SRC was affiliated to the National Union of Students but initially restricted itself largely to social activities. After 1988 it began to campaign on issues such as improvements to the canteen, lifting the ban on religious or political activity within the then Hatfield Polytechnic, and for a formal students&#x27; union. The sectarian ban was finally lifted in 1992 and a Union granted in 1995. However, the canteen continued to be an issue throughout the 2000s. The Students&#x27; Union at the University of Hertfordshire represents all students in the university by organising campus activities and running different clubs and societies, from sports to entertainment.

<text>Edward Stafford, 2nd Earl of Wiltshire (7 April 1470 – 24 March 1499) was an English nobleman.

==Origins==
Edward Stafford, born 7 April 1470, was the only child of John Stafford, 1st Earl of Wiltshire (d. 8 May 1473), third son of Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham, by Anne Neville (1414–1480), the daughter of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland, by his second marriage to Joan Beaufort, the legitimated daughter of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, by his mistress and later third wife, Katherine Swynford.

Edward Stafford&#x27;s mother was Constance Greene (d. 2 March 1475), the only daughter and heiress of Henry Greene, esquire, of Drayton in Lowick, Northamptonshire.

==Career==

Stafford&#x27;s father died 8 May 1473, and Stafford succeeded to the earldom at the age of three. He was made a Knight of the Bath on 18 April 1475, and on 16 March and 1 June of that year Sir Ralph Hastings was appointed steward of his lands during his minority, while his &#x27;governance and tuition&#x27; were entrusted to his grandmother, Anne, Duchess of Buckingham.

On 6 July 1483 Stafford bore the Queen&#x27;s crown at the coronation of King Richard III, and on 24 August of that year he was present at the creation of the King&#x27;s, son, Edward, as Prince of Wales.

On 30 June 1484, at the age of fourteen, Stafford had licence to enter on his lands. On 25 November 1487 he attended the coronation of King Henry VII&#x27;s Queen, Elizabeth of York. He was with the forces which fought against the Cornish rebels at Blackheath on 17 June 1497, and on 11 September 1498 entertained the King at Drayton.

Stafford died at Drayton on 24 March 1499 at the age of 28, and was buried at Lowick. His widow, Margaret, died between 8 August 1500 and 9 September 1504.

Stafford left a will dated 21 March 1499, summarized by Harris in &quot;Testamenta Vetusta&quot;, requesting burial in St. Peter&#x27;s Church, Lowick:

My body to be buried in the Church of St. Peter of Lufwyke, in the County of Northampton, in Our Lady&#x27;s aisle, by my grandfather Greene; and I will that my executors make a convenient tomb there for me.

==Marriage and issue==
By settlement dated 13 July 1494 Stafford married Margaret Grey, the daughter of Edward Grey, Viscount Lisle, by Elizabeth Talbot, &quot;suo jure&quot; Baroness Lisle of Kingston Lisle. They had no issue, and the earldom of Wiltshire became extinct at Stafford&#x27;s death.

The earldom of Wiltshire was re-created on 28 January 1510 for Edward Stafford&#x27;s cousin, Henry Stafford, 1st Earl of Wiltshire. Burke erroneously states that Edward Stafford&#x27;s widow, Margaret, married Henry Stafford. However Cokayne, Vol. XII, p. 738, states that this alleged marriage did not take place. Moreover, Burke mistakenly identifies Stafford&#x27;s widow, Margaret, as the &quot;daughter&quot; of John Grey, Viscount Lisle, whereas she was the daughter of Edward Grey, Viscount Lisle, and his wife, Elizabeth Talbot (d. 8 September 1487), and the &quot;sister&quot; of John Grey (d. 6 or 9 September 1504), 2nd Viscount Lisle.

<text>Logica plc was a multinational IT and management consultancy company headquartered in London and later Reading, United Kingdom.

Founded in 1969, the company had offices in London and in a number of major cities across England, Wales and Scotland, as well as in other countries around the world. It was responsible for many telecommunications infrastructure projects, such as the design of the SWIFT network for international money transfers, the Euronet packet-switching network, and the Bay Area Rapid Transit in San Francisco. Following the acquisition of CMG in 2002, the company was known as LogicaCMG from then until 2008, when it changed its name back to Logica. The company&#x27;s main business at that point was in providing consulting, systems integration, and IT outsourcing in both the public and private sectors.

Logica was acquired by Canada-based CGI Group in 2012 and the Logica brand name ceased being used in 2013.

==History==
===Origins===
Logica was started as a systems integration business in 1969. Its founders were five people who left Scicon, an American computer company that had opened a London-based UK subsidiary and that had then been bought by BP. Chief among these were Len Taylor, who took the operational helm, and Philip Hughes, who served in the visionary role. Indeed a later profile would call Hughes &quot;one of the architects of the information age.&quot;

The other founders were Pat Coen, Steve Feldman, and John McNeil. Another important figure, David Mann, joined the fledgling outfit a few weeks later. 

===Early projects and expansion===
The new firm&#x27;s first major contract came in 1970 for a computerized hotel reservation system that would operate on a nationwide basis and was worth £100,000. Another early project was the control system for the United Kingdom&#x27;s natural gas grid in 1971. In its early years the company focused on adapting software to specific customer needs and requirements and advising customers on trends in information technology. The company was premised on the idea that there was tremendous promise in communications technology and that an international approach was warranted. Accordingly, Logica&#x27;s first overseas office, in the Netherlands, was opened in 1973, the same year that turnover exceeded £1 million for the first time. Overall, Logica played a role in putting into use many of the components that later made the Internet a large-scale success.

Logica had a major success that gave it visibility when it won the design of the SWIFT network for international money transfers in 1972–73. The company produced a whole new production, transmission and management system for the BBC in the late 1970s. Another involved the first bank cash dispenser in the UK. The company&#x27;s staffing levels were around 200 employees in the early years, and their successes at pulling off large-scale and difficult projects garnered them a reputation for technical excellence and able management.

McNeil led the teams that did many of the company&#x27;s early projects. He left Logica in 1977 and ended up in a successful career as a novelist and a writer for BBC dramas.

In 1974, Logica, together with the French company SESA, set up a joint venture, Sesa-Logica, to undertake the &quot;Euronet&quot; development. The project, with the support of partners throughout Europe and the assistance of Bolt, Beranek and Newman in Cambridge, Massachusetts, used the packet switching technology of the NPL network and ARPANET and X.25 protocols to form virtual circuits. It established a network linking research centres in a number of European countries. They hired Roger Scantlebury in 1977 who had worked on the European Informatics Network, a datagram network linking CERN, the French research centre INRIA and the UK’s National Physical Laboratory.

Logica set up operating subsidiaries in the Sweden and the United States in 1977.

While there were many other British computer services firms started up during this period, most ended up being bought out by bigger companies or overseas services firms. As such Logica became the dominant independent UK computer services company.

The firm was involved in the development of the original automatic train control system for San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) in the late 1970s and early 1980s as part of the original construction of BART.

===Logica VTS===
In 1975, Logica developed the first electronic typing pool – Unicom – for Unilever. This development allowed the functions of a typing pool to be automated into a single system supporting about 50 workstations.

With the support of the UK&#x27;s National Enterprise Board, in January 1979 the company established a new subsidiary to exploit this technology, Logica VTS. A range of standalone word processors, the VTS 100, the VTS 2200 (&quot;Whirlwind&quot;) and, finally, the VTS 2300 (&quot;Kennet&quot;), were developed and were manufactured at a purpose built factory in Swindon. These machines were sold internationally by BT and by International Computers Ltd, and were amongst the first word processors to achieve mass sales.

The advent of the personal computer, and software such as WordPerfect, led to the decline of this business and its ultimate closure.

In connection with office automation, Logica VTS also engaged in product work related to local area networking, putting out a product called Polynet in 1981 which was based upon the Cambridge Ring idea rather than Ethernet. This aspect of business was still going in 1984, with Logica founder Pat Coen as managing director of Logica VTS.

By the end of 1985, Logica had decided to exit the office automation business, and Logica VTS was shut down over the course of 1986.

===Software Products Group, Rapport, and Xenix===
Most of Logica&#x27;s software products were used only internally, as part of reusing implementation parts of the contracting projects it engaged in. However, Logica staged a foray into the wider software products world in the early-mid 1980s, creating the Software Products Group. The director of the group was Gordon Kirk.

Logica Rapport was an early relational database management system that was developed internally in 1977 and began selling as a general product in 1979, with another release in 1980. Micro Rapport was also released, for the Zilog Z80. By 1986, support for Rapport was being phased out by Logica, to the consternation of some organisations using it.

Xenix was a version of the Unix operating system that Microsoft worked on; in 1982 they engaged with the Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) in this work, with the two companies&#x27; engineers working together on improvements. Microsoft and SCO then further engaged Human Computing Resources in Canada, and the Software Products Group within Logica in the United Kingdom, as part of making further improvements to Xenix and porting Xenix to other platforms. In doing so, Microsoft gave HCR and Logica the rights to do Xenix ports and license Xenix binaries in those territories, which for Logica included all of Europe. This second source agreement was formalised between Microsoft and Logica in January 1983.

This Logica group put out several releases, including Xenix 3.0 in 1984, which was based on UNIX System III for 16-bit processors with some Berkeley Software Distribution networking functionality and improved compatibility with MS-DOS. Logica stated that it had over 300 clients for its Xenix product, including other computer manufacturers such as Acorn Computers, Plessey Microsystems, SAGEM, Regnecentralen, and Triumph-Adler, indirect sales through resellers, and direct sales to end customers such as Chemical Bank, West Midlands County Council, and Natural Environment Research Council. Logica&#x27;s positioning of Xenix included features making it easier to use. However, during 1986, Logica decided to, as it said in its annual review, &quot;withdraw from Xenix operations&quot;.

The Software Products Group was acquired by SCO in December 1986; it became a wholly owned subsidiary, the Santa Cruz Operation Limited, and the basis for SCO&#x27;s UK operation, with its office subsequently being relocated first to Soho and then to Watford outside London. Initially supplemented by some engineers who transferred from SCO&#x27;s headquarters operation in Santa Cruz, California, the ex-Logica group now in Watford became one of the major development sites for SCO and over the next few years did the operating system kernel development work behind the subsequent SCO OpenDesktop and SCO OpenServer product releases, as well as later working in networking, security, escalations, and other areas, in addition to being the sales, marketing, and customer engineering hub for SCO&#x27;s (and later Caldera International&#x27;s) EMEA region (although most development work in Watford was shut down in 2000).

===Public company and the David Mann era===
The company floated on the London Stock Exchange on 26 October 1983. The company had 1,000 employees at this time, and they were major shareholders, owning some 40 percent of the firm. However the stock price remained flat during this time, and indeed would for much of the next ten years.

In 1985 they were faced with a hostile takeover bid by the Ross Perot-led competitor Electronic Data Systems (EDS), but they were able to fend it off. Around this time the UK trade magazine &quot;Computing&quot; named Logica as the &quot;Company of the Decade&quot;.

In 1984 the company developed the automated clearing system for the UK banks (CHAPS) as well as the Customer Service System for British Telecommunications (BT/CSS), the £1bn total implementation, represented largest computer project undertaken in Europe and the largest integrated database in the world.

Logica pioneered the automated ticketing system for London Underground in 1987 and a new version of the system which randomly generates Premium Bond numbers (ERNIE) in 1988.

Logica set up joint ventures in Hong Kong with Jardine Matheson to undertake the real time trading system for the new integrated Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1984, in Italy with Finsiel in 1993, and in the UK with British Airways in 1990 to undertake the development of computer systems for the airline and then sell them to other airlines. The company&#x27;s research and development arm was known as Logica Cambridge and located in Cambridge, England.

Logica&#x27;s competitors in the IT services and contracting realm in general included not just EDS but also Andersen Consulting, Cap Gemini Sogeti, and the Sema Group, as well as in specialty areas (such as banking) Hoskyns Group, Admiral Consulting, and Advanced Computer Techniques.

Near-original employee David Mann became managing director and CEO of the company in 1987. Founder Philip Hughes resigned as chairman of the board of directors in 1990, and left the board entirely in 1995, focusing instead on a completely different career as a very successful landscape painter. Other original founders of the company were also playing a lesser role at this point.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s the company was led by David Mann. During this period the company&#x27;s turnover fell flat, and it suffered a loss in 1991, as it struggled with the effects of the early 1990s recession, especially among customers in the financial services industry. There were also problems in the Logica US subsidiary, and changes in the software marketplace. The company gained a reputation for emphasizing the creation of technically difficult, bespoke solutions, but ones that did not always maximise customer or shareholder value. Logica was a pioneer in the development of Text messageing systems for Mobiles making their first sale to Vodafone. By February 1994, Mann was out as CEO.

===Martin Read era===
Martin Read was recruited from GEC Marconi, where he had worked for Arnold Weinstock, and appointed CEO in August 1993. Most of the executive directors left the company during the two years following his appointment – David Mann, Colin Rowland, Andrew Karney, Ian Macleod and Cliff Preddy. This was not unexpected; as one of the very few still left, Andrew Given, later said, &quot;As executive directors we knew we were being brave in choosing him, because for most of us it was like turkeys voting for Christmas.&quot;

By 1994 the company had some 3,400 employees.

Defence work was still going on within the company, being done both by both Logica plc and by a specific group known as Logica, Defence and Civil Government.

By the close of the 1990s, Logica had seen large-scale growth, with an average annual earnings increase of 35 percent over the previous five years and an increase in the company&#x27;s market capitalisation from £130 million in August 1993 to £6.1 billion in December 1999. Logica had 8,500 employees and had gained entry into the FTSE 100. Its customers included large governmental organizations and private companies such as Ford, Exxon, IBM, Compaq, Vodafone, Reuters, Merrill Lynch, Prudential, Deutsche Bank, and Diageo. Read had great ambitions for the company, saying that over the next five years, &quot;I would like to make Logica as famous a brand as IBM.&quot;.

In 1999 the buyout of the in-house Customer Care and Billing product division took place leading to the founding of the company that would become Cerillion.

In 2000, Logica acquired the German computing services business PDV for £370 million, increasing the size of the German workforce by 1,200 in the process.

In 2001 the company secured an outsourcing contract to create and operate a new case management system for the Crown Prosecution Service. At this time the level of Read&#x27;s remuneration received attention when it was revealed that he enjoyed a £28 million pay packet.

===LogicaCMG===
The merger of Logica (60 percent) with British company CMG (40 percent) to form LogicaCMG on 30 December 2002 united an established technology firm (Logica) with an established consulting firm (CMG).

In December 2003, LogicaCMG’s software controlled the doomed Beagle 2 probe after separation from the Mars Express orbiter.

During the mid-2000s the company embarked on a series of acquisitions of Continental European firms. In 2005, LogicaCMG purchased 60 percent of the Portuguese company Edinfor (and in March 2008 purchased the remaining portion). In 2006, LogicaCMG purchased the French company Unilog for £631 million and the Swedish company WM-data for £876 million.

The company suffered some embarrassment in 2006 when laptops containing police payroll data were stolen from LogicaCMG and an outsourcing contract with Transport for London for IT services was terminated early after disputes over payments and service level agreements.

By 2007, the firm had some 39,000 employees and offices in 36 countries, and was one of Europe&#x27;s largest IT services and outsourcing firms. Its largest locations in terms of employees counts were France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, in that order. Its most profitable sales regions were the UK, France, the Netherlands, and Scandinavia.

On 20 February 2007, LogicaCMG Telecom Products was sold for £265m (US $525m) to private investors Atlantic Bridge Ventures and Access Industries, and became known as Acision.

Following a profit warning in 2007, shareholders became increasingly skeptical about the wisdom of the European acquisitions strategy, and Martin Read was forced out as CEO by these shareholders.

===Return to Logica===

Andy Green was recruited as the new CEO and took office from 1 January 2008.

On 27 February 2008, the company changed its name back to Logica. Nevertheless news accounts often referred to the company as being Anglo-Dutch.

In April 2008 Green announced a major restructuring programme for the company, leading to 1,300 job losses. In May 2008 the company announced that it would offshore more of its activities including SAP support and HR and payroll administration to Makati in the Philippines, and saw a subsequent increase in its outsourced HR and payroll services business to more than 850 customer organisations.

Beginning in late 2009, Logica&#x27;s revenues suffered from the effects of the European debt crisis. In December 2011, Logica announced it would cut 1,300 jobs or around 3 percent of the workforce spread across Benelux, the United Kingdom and Sweden, to save 50 to 60 million pounds a year from the second half of 2012. Logica&#x27;s shares fell to half their value from a year prior. Gradually the outsourcing component came to represent some 45 percent of the company&#x27;s overall business.

===Acquisition by CGI===

On 31 May 2012, Canada&#x27;s CGI Group agreed to buy Logica in a £1.7 billion cash deal. The acquisition would give CGI a large presence in Europe for the first time and make it the sixth-largest IT services provider in the world. The acquisition was completed on 20 August 2012.

At the time of the acquisition, CGI had some 35,000 employees compared to Logica&#x27;s 40,000; following elimination of redundancies, around 71,000 employees were in the newly merged company. By March 2013, Logica had been fully integrated into CGI and the Logica brand name disappeared from use.

==Operations==
Logica was a management consultancy, outsourcing and IT services and solutions company. Its activities included:
* Supporting the missions of over 150 orbiting satellites.
* Processing more than $100 billion of salaries globally each year.
* Supporting 300 telecoms operators in 130 countries.

== LogiBods ==
Some Former Logica staff have referred to themselves as a &quot;LogiBod&quot;.

During the 1980s and 1990s Logica ran an extensive graduate recruitment programme that resulted in the company having a relatively young workforce.

There is an independently operated alumni society, run by former employees, to cater for nostalgic needs of LogiBods and help them keep in touch.

<text>The &quot;M29&quot; class comprised five monitors of the Royal Navy, all built and launched during 1915.

The ships of this class were ordered in March, 1915, as part of the Emergency War Programme of ship construction. The contract for construction was granted to Harland &amp; Wolff, Belfast, who sub-contracted the construction of &quot;M32&quot; and &quot;M33&quot; to Workman, Clark and Company.

The main armament of the ships, two 6-inch Mk XII guns, came from guns originally intended for the five s which became surplus when their aft casemate mountings turned out to be unworkable and were dispensed with.

== Ships of the class ==
* HMS &quot;M29&quot; – launched on 22 May 1915 and later renamed &quot;Medusa&quot; and &quot;Talbot&quot;, she was sold in 1946.
* HMS &quot;M30&quot; – launched on 23 June 1915, and sunk on 14 May 1916.
* HMS &quot;M31&quot; – launched on 24 June 1915, and broken up for scrap in 1948.
* HMS &quot;M32&quot; – launched on 22 May 1915, and sold in January 1920.
* HMS &quot;M33&quot; – launched on 22 May 1915, is one of a number of World War I-era warships in existence today and is located in dry-dock near HMS &quot;Victory&quot; at Portsmouth Naval Base. It has been restored and is open to public.

<text>Parker Road station (formerly East Plano Transit Center) is an intermodal transit facility in Plano, Texas. The station is located near North Central Expressway (US 75) between Parker Road and Park Boulevard. Operated by Dallas Area Rapid Transit, the station services DART light rail, four bus routes, and five on-demand service zones.

The station is the northern terminus of the . It is also the northern terminus of the during weekday peak hours.

==History==

=== Plano Transit Center ===
The first DART facility in Plano was the Plano Transit Center, a small park-and-ride lot located at a former drive-in theater. The facility was very rudimentary, lacking passenger shelters or benches.

In early 1989, DART opened the West Plano Transit Center four miles west of Plano Transit Center. When this did not substantially decrease ridership at the lot, DART opted to build an expanded east Plano facility.

=== East Plano Transit Center ===
In 1990, DART purchased 19.2 acres of land for the new East Plano Transit Center. The land was adjacent to a disused Southern Pacific rail corridor that DART was studying for a then-proposed light rail system. The transit center, built at a $7.5 million cost, opened on April 20, 1993.

=== Parker Road ===
On December 7, 2002, to celebrate the coming train service, DART and the city of Plano offered free preview rides from Bush Turnpike to East Plano Transit Center. The event also celebrated the 100th anniversary of the Texas Electric Railway, which operated on the same right-of-way from 1902 to 1948.

The Red Line was officially extended to East Plano Transit Center on December 9, 2002 as part of the line&#x27;s fourth and final extension. Following the extension, the station was renamed to Parker Road.

==== Fair Share Parking ====
On April 2, 2012, DART began a pilot program known as &quot;Fair Share Parking&quot;. The program, operated by a private contractor, required commuters from non-DART member cities to pay a daily fee for parking at the station. Residents of DART member cities could park for free as long as they applied for and displayed a special resident permit. Parker Road was one of two stations to be included in the program at launch, the other being North Carrollton/Frankford. The program was intended to improve parking availability and to make up for the lack of sales tax revenue from non-residents. However, most commuters at Parker Road simply switched to parking at Bush Turnpike station, which regularly approached capacity in the months following the change.

After the initiative failed to make a profit, DART opted to end it on April 2, 2014 when its contract with the private operator expired. While most stations simply dropped the initiative altogether, Parker Road continued to utilize the resident permits by reserving lots at the station for permit holders.

<text>Henry Stafford, 1st Earl of Wiltshire (c. 1479 – 6 April 1523) was an English peer.

==Family==
Henry Stafford, born c.1479, was the younger of two sons of Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, and Lady Catherine Woodville, the daughter of Richard Woodville, 1st Earl Rivers, by Jacquetta of Luxembourg, daughter of Pierre de Luxembourg, Count of St. Pol, and was thus a nephew of Elizabeth Woodville and King Edward IV.

By his father&#x27;s marriage to Catherine Woodville, Stafford had an elder brother, Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham, and two sisters, Elizabeth, who married Robert Radcliffe, 1st Earl of Sussex, and Anne, who married firstly, Sir Walter Herbert (d. 16 September 1507), an illegitimate son of William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke, and secondly, George Hastings, 1st Earl of Huntingdon.

After the execution of the 2nd Duke of Buckingham, his widow, Catherine Woodville, married Jasper Tudor, second son of Owen Tudor and King Henry V&#x27;s widow, Catherine of Valois. After Jasper Tudor&#x27;s death on 21 December 1495, Catherine Woodville married Sir Richard Wingfield (d. 22 July 1525). Catherine Woodville died 18 May 1497. After her death, Sir Richard Wingfield married Bridget Wiltshire, daughter and heiress of Sir John Wiltshire of Stone, Kent.

==Career==
In October 1483 Stafford&#x27;s father participated in a rebellion against King Richard III. He was beheaded without trial on 2 November 1483, whereby all his honours were forfeited. However, after Richard III&#x27;s defeat at Bosworth on 22 August 1485, and King Henry VII&#x27;s accession to the crown, Stafford&#x27;s elder brother was made a Knight of the Order of the Bath on 29 October 1485 as Duke of Buckingham, and attended Henry VII&#x27;s coronation the following day. Their father&#x27;s attainder was formally reversed by Parliament in November of that year, and the wardship of both Henry Stafford and his elder brother were granted, on 3 August 1486, to the King&#x27;s mother, Margaret Beaufort. The reversal of the attainder may have been influenced by the fact that Edward and Henry Stafford&#x27;s mother, Catherine Woodville, was the sister of Elizabeth Woodville, mother of King Henry VII&#x27;s wife, Elizabeth of York.

Stafford did not inherit properties which would have ensured his financial independence, and according to Dockray his elder brother, the Duke of Buckingham, did not endow him with lands which would have guaranteed him an income. It was thus perhaps for financial reasons that Stafford became one of his brother&#x27;s retained councillors and assisted with the management of the extensive Stafford estates. In 1500 Stafford oversaw a survey of his brother&#x27;s properties in the Welsh Marches, Thornbury, and Bedminster, in 1502 he assisted with an audit of his brother&#x27;s Gloucestershire estates, and from about 1500 to 1521 he served as steward, and for most of that time also as sheriff, of his brother&#x27;s Welsh lordships.

Stafford also played a role at the courts of Henry VII and Henry VIII. On 22 April 1505 he was made a member of the Order of the Garter, and in January 1506 was present at a meeting between the Henry VII and Philip of Castile at Windsor. At the accession of Henry VIII on 21 April 1509 Stafford was imprisoned in the Tower on suspicion of treason, but was released without charge. On 27 January 1510 he was created Earl of Wiltshire.

According to Dockray, Stafford was thereafter among the King&#x27;s favoured courtiers, &#x27;sharing his taste for lavish entertainments, tournaments, and hunting&#x27;. The King granted Stafford several offices in the West Country, and he served militarily on one of the King&#x27;s ships in 1512 and as captain of 651 men during Henry VIII&#x27;s invasion of France in 1513, landing at Calais on 10 June, and marching south-east on 16 June to participate in the siege of Thérouanne.

Stafford was on the commission directed to inquire into riots in Devon on 29 September 1514, and was in attendance in Westminster Abbey when Wolsey received his Cardinal&#x27;s hat on 18 November 1515. Either in or before 1520 he became a member of the Privy Council, and in 1520 was appointed to attend the King at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in June, and at his meeting with the Emperor Charles V in July. Dockray notes that Wiltshire&#x27;s expenditure at court in the early years of the reign of Henry VIII must have been considerable, as by 1521 he owed the crown £4407 4s.

Stafford was under suspicion in the plot which led to the execution of his elder brother on 17 May 1521, being among those on whom the King ordered Wolsey to keep &#x27;good watch&#x27;, but apparently retained the King&#x27;s favour, and was with the army which crossed to France on 12 August 1522.

Stafford died a few months later on 6 April 1523, aged about 44. He left no issue, and the earldom became extinct. On 8 December 1529 the title was granted to Thomas Boleyn, whose daughter, Anne, was betrothed to King Henry VIII.

==Marriage and issue==
According to Burke, p. 493, Stafford married firstly, Margaret Grey, daughter and co-heiress of John Grey, Viscount Lisle, and widow of Edward Stafford, 2nd Earl of Wiltshire (d. 24 March 1499). However Cokayne, Vol. XII, p. 738, states that this alleged marriage did not take place. Moreover, Burke mistakenly identifies Margaret Grey as the &quot;daughter&quot; of John Grey, Viscount Lisle, whereas she was the daughter of Edward Grey, Viscount Lisle, and his wife, Elizabeth Talbot (d. 8 September 1487), and the &quot;sister&quot; of John Grey (d. 6 or 9 September 1509), 4th Viscount Lisle. Pidgeon states that in the supplication he made to obtain a dispensation to marry Cicely Bonville he is described as a widower although &quot;there is no other evidence for a wife.&quot; 

Before 8 October 1505 Stafford paid Henry VII £2000 for permission to marry the wealthy Cecily Bonville, only child and heiress of William Bonville, 6th Baron Harington, and widow of Henry Stafford&#x27;s first cousin, Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset (c.1455 – 30 August 1501). Cecily Bonville was some nineteen years older than Stafford, and had seven sons and seven daughters by her first marriage. The proposed match prompted Cecily&#x27;s eldest son, Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset, to challenge his mother&#x27;s right to continue as her late husband&#x27;s executor. After intervention by King and council, a settlement was reached under which Cecily was prevented from claiming her dower until her eldest son had received his inheritance under his father&#x27;s will, and limited her control over her own inheritance during her lifetime, requiring her to bequeath it to her eldest son at her death.

<text>Downtown Plano station is a DART light rail station in Plano, Texas. The station is located in Plano&#x27;s historic downtown district on the eastern side of Haggard Park. It serves the and, during peak periods, the .

== History ==

=== Predecessor ===
The rail corridor through Downtown Plano was constructed by the Houston and Texas Central Railway in the late 19th century. The corridor was purchased by Dallas Area Rapid Transit in 1988.

The modern-day station site was previously used by the Texas Electric Railway interurban line from 1908 to 1948 as a passenger station. The Texas Electric Railway&#x27;s station building, now used by the Interurban Railway Museum, is located in Haggard Park.

=== Modern station ===
In 1996, DART released preliminary plans for a downtown Plano station, tentatively named 15th Street. The station would be an at-grade structure on the south side of 15th Street with a small parking lot. The station plan was controversial among downtown merchants, as it would require the demolition of an antique mall and would cause traffic congestion. In 1998, the city of Plano approved a different location north of 15th Street. This location was three times larger and able to accommodate redevelopment, though it did not include any long-term parking. The station was slated to open in 2003.

In 2000, construction began on Transit Village, a $16 million transit-oriented development directly adjacent to the station, which contained both apartments and retail space. In 2002, the city of Plano announced renovations to Haggard Park, which is also adjacent to the station.

In March 2002, DART announced that construction of the North Central Corridor, which included Downtown Plano, was six months ahead of schedule. A sculpture of a steam locomotive-inspired horse, named &quot;Iron Horse&quot;, was installed on the station platform.

On December 7, 2002, DART held an opening ceremony for the station. Dubbed &quot;Super Saturday&quot;, the event offered a free preview service between the Bush Turnpike, Downtown Plano, and Parker Road stations, as well as a Christmas parade. The ceremony also commemorated the 100th anniversary of the Northern Texas Traction Company, the first interurban in the modern-day Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. The station officially opened the following Monday.

<doc id="503378" wikidata="Q979829" url="?curid=503378" title="Radon transform">
<text>In mathematics, the Radon transform is the integral transform which takes a function &quot;f&quot; defined on the plane to a function &quot;Rf&quot; defined on the (two-dimensional) space of lines in the plane, whose value at a particular line is equal to the line integral of the function over that line. The transform was introduced in 1917 by Johann Radon, who also provided a formula for the inverse transform. Radon further included formulas for the transform in three dimensions, in which the integral is taken over planes (integrating over lines is known as the X-ray transform). It was later generalized to higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces and more broadly in the context of integral geometry. The complex analogue of the Radon transform is known as the Penrose transform. The Radon transform is widely applicable to tomography, the creation of an image from the projection data associated with cross-sectional scans of an object.

==Explanation==
If a functionformula_1 represents an unknown density, then the Radon transform represents the projection data obtained as the output of a tomographic scan. Hence the inverse of the Radon transform can be used to reconstruct the original density from the projection data, and thus it forms the mathematical underpinning for tomographic reconstruction, also known as iterative reconstruction.

The Radon transform data is often called a sinogram because the Radon transform of an off-center point source is a sinusoid. Consequently, the Radon transform of a number of small objects appears graphically as a number of blurred sine waves with different amplitudes and phases.

The Radon transform is useful in computed axial tomography (CAT scan), barcode scanners, electron microscopy of macromolecular assemblies like viruses and protein complexes, reflection seismology and in the solution of hyperbolic partial differential equations.
==Definition==
Let formula_2 be a function that satisfies the three regularity conditions:

# formula_3 is continuous;
# the double integral formula_4, extending over the whole plane, converges;
# for any arbitrary point formula_5 on the plane it holds that formula_6
The Radon transform, formula_7, is a function defined on the space of straight lines formula_8 by the line integral along each such line as:
formula_9Concretely, the parametrization of any straight line &quot;formula_10&quot; with respect to arc length formula_11 can always be written:formula_12where formula_13 is the distance of formula_14 from the origin and formula_15 is the angle the normal vector to &quot;formula_10&quot; makes with the formula_17-axis. It follows that the quantities formula_18 can be considered as coordinates on the space of all lines in formula_19, and the Radon transform can be expressed in these coordinates by: formula_20More generally, in the formula_21-dimensional Euclidean space formula_22, the Radon transform of a function formula_1 satisfying the regularity conditions is a function &quot;formula_7&quot; on the space formula_25 of all hyperplanes in formula_22. It is defined by:

formula_27where the integral is taken with respect to the natural hypersurface measure, formula_28 (generalizing the formula_29 term from the formula_30-dimensional case). Observe that any element of formula_25 is characterized as the solution locus of an equation formula_32, where formula_33 is a unit vector and formula_34. Thus the formula_21-dimensional Radon transform may be rewritten as a function on formula_36 via: formula_37It is also possible to generalize the Radon transform still further by integrating instead over formula_38-dimensional affine subspaces of formula_22. The X-ray transform is the most widely used special case of this construction, and is obtained by integrating over straight lines.

==Relationship with the Fourier transform==


The Radon transform is closely related to the Fourier transform. We define the univariate Fourier transform here as: formula_40 For a function of a formula_30-vector formula_42, the univariate Fourier transform is: formula_43 For convenience, denote formula_44. The Fourier slice theorem then states: formula_45 where formula_46

Thus the two-dimensional Fourier transform of the initial function along a line at the inclination angle formula_15 is the one variable Fourier transform of the Radon transform (acquired at angle formula_15) of that function. This fact can be used to compute both the Radon transform and its inverse. The result can be generalized into &quot;n&quot; dimensions: formula_49

== Dual transform ==
The dual Radon transform is a kind of adjoint to the Radon transform. Beginning with a function &quot;g&quot; on the space formula_25, the dual Radon transform is the function formula_51 on R&quot;n&quot; defined by: formula_52The integral here is taken over the set of all hyperplanes incident with the point formula_53, and the measure formula_54 is the unique probability measure on the set formula_55 invariant under rotations about the point formula_56.

Concretely, for the two-dimensional Radon transform, the dual transform is given by: formula_57 In the context of image processing, the dual transform is commonly called &quot;back-projection&quot; as it takes a function defined on each line in the plane and &#x27;smears&#x27; or projects it back over the line to produce an image.

===Intertwining property===
Let formula_58 denote the Laplacian on formula_22 defined by:formula_60This is a natural rotationally invariant second-order differential operator. On formula_25, the &quot;radial&quot; second derivative formula_62 is also rotationally invariant. The Radon transform and its dual are intertwining operators for these two differential operators in the sense that: formula_63In analysing the solutions to the wave equation in multiple spatial dimensions, the intertwining property leads to the translational representation of Lax and Philips. In imaging and numerical analysis this is exploited to reduce multi-dimensional problems into single-dimensional ones, as a dimensional splitting method.

==Reconstruction approaches==

The process of &quot;reconstruction&quot; produces the image (or function formula_1 in the previous section) from its projection data. &quot;Reconstruction&quot; is an inverse problem.

===Radon inversion formula===
In the two-dimensional case, the most commonly used analytical formula to recover formula_1 from its Radon transform is the &quot;Filtered Back-projection Formula&quot; or &quot;Radon Inversion Formula&quot;: formula_66where formula_67 is such that formula_68. The convolution kernel formula_67 is referred to as Ramp filter in some literature.

===Ill-posedness===
Intuitively, in the &quot;filtered back-projection&quot; formula, by analogy with differentiation, for which formula_70, we see that the filter performs an operation similar to a derivative. Roughly speaking, then, the filter makes objects &quot;more&quot; singular. A quantitive statement of the ill-posedness of Radon inversion goes as follows:formula_71
where formula_72 is the previously defined adjoint to the Radon transform. Thus for formula_73, we have: formula_74
The complex exponential formula_75 is thus an eigenfunction of formula_76 with eigenvalue formula_77. Thus the singular values of formula_78 are formula_79. Since these singular values tend to formula_80, formula_81 is unbounded.

===Iterative reconstruction methods===

Compared with the &quot;Filtered Back-projection&quot; method, iterative reconstruction costs large computation time, limiting its practical use. However, due to the ill-posedness of Radon Inversion, the &quot;Filtered Back-projection&quot; method may be infeasible in the presence of discontinuity or noise. Iterative reconstruction methods (&quot;e.g.&quot; iterative Sparse Asymptotic Minimum Variance) could provide metal artefact reduction, noise and dose reduction for the reconstructed result that attract much research interest around the world.

==Inversion formulas==

Explicit and computationally efficient inversion formulas for the Radon transform and its dual are available. The Radon transform in formula_21 dimensions can be inverted by the formula: formula_83where formula_84, and the power of the Laplacian formula_85 is defined as a pseudo-differential operator if necessary by the Fourier transform: formula_86For computational purposes, the power of the Laplacian is commuted with the dual transform formula_87 to give: formula_88where formula_89 is the Hilbert transform with respect to the &quot;s&quot; variable. In two dimensions, the operator formula_90 appears in image processing as a ramp filter. One can prove directly from the Fourier slice theorem and change of variables for integration that for a compactly supported continuous function formula_91 of two variables: formula_92Thus in an image processing context the original image formula_91 can be recovered from the &#x27;sinogram&#x27; data formula_94 by applying a ramp filter (in the formula_13 variable) and then back-projecting. As the filtering step can be performed efficiently (for example using digital signal processing techniques) and the back projection step is simply an accumulation of values in the pixels of the image, this results in a highly efficient, and hence widely used, algorithm.

Explicitly, the inversion formula obtained by the latter method is: formula_96The dual transform can also be inverted by an analogous formula: formula_97

==Radon transform in algebraic geometry==

In algebraic geometry, a Radon transform (also known as the &quot;Brylinski–Radon transform&quot;) is constructed as follows.

Write

:formula_98

for the universal hyperplane, i.e., &quot;H&quot; consists of pairs (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;h&quot;) where &quot;x&quot; is a point in &quot;d&quot;-dimensional projective space formula_99 and &quot;h&quot; is a point in the dual projective space (in other words, &quot;x&quot; is a line through the origin in (&quot;d&quot;+1)-dimensional affine space, and &quot;h&quot; is a hyperplane in that space) such that &quot;x&quot; is contained in &quot;h&quot;.

Then the Brylinksi–Radon transform is the functor between appropriate derived categories of étale sheaves

:formula_100

The main theorem about this transform is that this transform induces an equivalence of the categories of perverse sheaves on the projective space and its dual projective space, up to constant sheaves.

<text>CityLine/Bush station (formerly Bush Turnpike station) is a DART light rail station in Richardson, Texas. The station is located on a frontage road of President George Bush Turnpike (SH 190) about east of its interchange with North Central Expressway (US 75). The station serves the and, during peak periods, the . The station will also serve the Silver Line commuter rail service once it is completed.

The station serves the mixed-use development CityLine, and it is also a park-and-ride lot for commuters using PGBT. A shuttle route, dubbed the Comet Cruiser, connects the station to the University of Texas at Dallas.

== History ==

=== Planning and construction ===
Original plans for the North Central Corridor Extension, which consisted of the modern-day Red Line north of Park Lane, included a station located near the Bush Turnpike/North Central interchange. The station was deferred to a secondary build-out phase, which would occur between 2006 and 2011. DART determined four possible locations, three in Plano and one in Richardson.

In 2000, DART selected the Richardson location and opted to construct the station alongside the rest of the Red Line, as it would be more expensive to defer it. The station opened on December 9, 2002 alongside the Downtown Plano and Parker Road stations.

=== Parking ===
Bush Turnpike station opened with 825 parking spaces, were located under an elevated segment of PGBT. This made Bush Turnpike the only DART station to have covered parking. The opening of Bush Turnpike and Parker Road ended parking capacity issues at Arapaho Center, which had previously been the northernmost station with parking. In 2007, DART added 380 additional spaces.

In 2012, DART introduced a paid parking initiative at Parker Road station, which would charge a daily fee to riders that were not residents of a DART member city. Because the initiative did not apply to Bush Turnpike station, many commuters moved to parking there, with an estimated 300 additional cars per day. In response, DART considered adding the parking fee to Bush Turnpike. This did not occur, and the parking initiative was ended in 2014.

=== Development ===
At opening, the area surrounding Bush Turnpike station was undeveloped. The vacant nature of the land served as inspiration for the station&#x27;s design, which sported a rustic theme with several illuminated topiaries.

In 2010, Parliament Group, which owned 300 acres of land east of the station, announced plans for a large mixed-use development on the land, which would include residential, office, and retail space. In 2012, it was announced that insurance firm State Farm would lease office space at the development.

Construction of the development, named CityLine, started in 2013 with a projected completion date of 2015. On March 14, 2016, the station was renamed to CityLine/Bush after the development.

=== Cotton Belt/Silver Line ===
In 1990, DART obtained a former St. Louis Southwestern rail corridor for use as a potential commuter rail corridor. The corridor, nicknamed the Cotton Belt, ran from Fort Worth to Wylie, passing just north of Richardson through Plano. The corridor was divided between DART and the Fort Worth Transportation Authority, with DART&#x27;s segment containing all parts of the corridor east of Dallas Fort Worth International Airport.

In 2010, the city of Plano proposed 12th Street, a new station that would serve as the eastern terminus of the corridor. Following this, the city of Richardson announced two proposals that would integrate Bush Turnpike to the line. One proposal would eliminate 12th Street entirely, instead routing the line south to Bush Turnpike. The other would divert the line south to Bush Turnpike, then run it northward to 12th Street.

In 2018, DART approved a commuter rail service on the Cotton Belt corridor, which was named the Silver Line. The approved plan included both the Bush Turnpike and 12th Street stations using a southern diversion based on Richardson&#x27;s proposal. The diversion required the creation of a bridge over North Central Expressway, which was paid for by both Richardson and DART.

Construction of the line began in 2019, and it is expected to open by 2026. The Silver Line platforms at CityLine/Bush will be directly adjacent to the existing light rail platforms, with a green space and several decorative arches connecting them.

<text>Galatyn Park station is a DART light rail station in Richardson, Texas. The station serves the and, during peak periods, the . It is located on a frontage road of North Central Expressway (US 75) and is named for the adjacent Galatyn Park Urban Center development.

The station is adjacent to the Charles W. Eisemann Center for Performing Arts and a portion of Richardson&#x27;s Telecom Corridor, which includes offices for AT&amp;T, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, GEICO, Goldman Sachs, and CBRE Group. A shuttle bus connects to the Palisades office and residential park on the other side of US 75. A plaza adjacent to the station hosts the annual Wildflower! Arts and Music Festival.

== History ==
Initial plans for the North Central Corridor, which became the northern segment of the Red Line, included a station at Campbell Road, south of the modern Galatyn Park station. The Campbell Road station was not intended for the initial corridor, being deferred to a second build-out phase.

Around the same time, the city of Richardson and a private developer had proposed a 250-acre development adjacent to the rail line, Galatyn Park Urban Center. The development would contain apartments, office buildings, a hotel, and a performing arts venue. DART agreed to move the Campbell Road station to Galatyn Park and to include it in the initial build-out.

The station opened on July 1, 2002, as part of the Red Line&#x27;s third major expansion. It served as the northern terminus of the line until December 9, when the line was extended to Parker Road. In tribute to the Telecom Corridor, the station was decorated with a technology theme, featuring abstract satellite dishes, bundles of steel resembling communication wires, stylized circuit boards, and panels that spell &quot;GALATYN PARK&quot; in Morse code, analog signal, and teletype.

<text>Norman Foster Ramsey Jr. (August 27, 1915 – November 4, 2011) was an American physicist who was awarded the 1989 Nobel Prize in Physics for the invention of the separated oscillatory field method (see Ramsey interferometry), which had important applications in the construction of atomic clocks. A physics professor at Harvard University for most of his career, Ramsey also held several posts with such government and international agencies as NATO and the United States Atomic Energy Commission. Among his other accomplishments are helping to found the United States Department of Energy&#x27;s Brookhaven National Laboratory and Fermilab.

== Early life ==
Norman Foster Ramsey Jr. was born in Washington, D.C., on August 27, 1915, to Minna Bauer Ramsey and Norman Foster Ramsey. His mother was the daughter of German immigrants and an instructor at the University of Kansas. His father, who was of Scottish descent, was a 1905 graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point and an officer in the Ordnance Department who rose to the rank of brigadier general during World War II, commanding the Rock Island Arsenal. He was raised as an Army brat, frequently moving from post to post, and lived in France for a time when his father was Liaison Officer with the and Assistant Military Attaché. This allowed him to skip a couple of grades along the way, so that he graduated from Leavenworth High School in Leavenworth, Kansas, at the age of 15.

Ramsey&#x27;s parents hoped that he would go to West Point, but at 15, he was too young to be admitted. He was awarded a scholarship to the University of Kansas, but in 1930 his father was posted to Governors Island, New York. Ramsey therefore entered Columbia University in 1931 and began studying engineering. He became interested in mathematics and switched to this as his academic major. By the time he received his BA from Columbia in 1935, he had become interested in physics. Columbia awarded him a Kellett Fellowship to Cambridge University, where he studied physics at Cavendish Laboratory under Lord Rutherford and Maurice Goldhaber, and encountered notable physicists, including Edward Appleton, Max Born, Edward Bullard, James Chadwick, John Cockcroft, Paul Dirac, Arthur Eddington, Ralph Fowler, Mark Oliphant and J. J. Thomson. At Cambridge, he took the tripos in order to study quantum mechanics, which had not been covered at Columbia, resulting in being awarded a second BA degree by Cambridge.

A term paper Ramsey wrote for Goldhaber on magnetic moments caused him to read recent papers on the subject by Isidor Isaac Rabi, and this stimulated an interest in molecular beams and in doing research for a PhD under Rabi at Columbia. Soon after Ramsey arrived at Columbia, Rabi invented molecular-beam resonance spectroscopy, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1944. Ramsey was part of Rabi&#x27;s team that also included Jerome Kellogg, Polykarp Kusch, Sidney Millman and Jerrold Zacharias. Ramsey worked with them on the first experiments making use of the new technique and shared with Rabi and Zacharias in the discovery that the deuteron was a magnetic quadrupole. This meant that the atomic nucleus was not spherical, as had been thought. He received his PhD in physics from Columbia in 1940 and became a fellow at the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C., where he studied neutron–proton and proton–helium scattering.

== World War II ==

=== Radiation laboratory ===
In 1940, he married Elinor Jameson of Brooklyn, New York, and accepted a teaching position at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. The two expected to spend the rest of their lives there, but World War II intervened. In September 1940 the British Tizard Mission brought a number of new technologies to the United States, including a cavity magnetron, a high-powered device that generates microwaves using the interaction of a stream of electrons with a magnetic field, which promised to revolutionize radar. Alfred Lee Loomis of the National Defense Research Committee established the Radiation Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to develop this technology. Ramsey was one of the scientists recruited by Rabi for this work.

Initially, Ramsey was in Rabi&#x27;s magnetron group. When Rabi became a division head, Ramsey became the group leader. The role of the group was to develop the magnetron to permit a reduction in wavelength from to , and then to or X band. Microwave radar promised to be small, lighter and more efficient than older types. Ramsey&#x27;s group started with the design produced by Oliphant&#x27;s team in Britain and attempted to improve it. The Radiation Laboratory produced the designs, which were prototyped by Raytheon, and then tested by the laboratory. In June 1941, Ramsey travelled to Britain, where he met with Oliphant, and the two exchanged ideas. He brought back some British components, which were incorporated into the final design. A night fighter aircraft, the Northrop P-61 Black Widow, was designed around the new radar. Ramsey returned to Washington in late 1942 as an adviser on the use of the new 3 cm microwave radar sets that were now coming into service, working for Edward L. Bowles in the office of the Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson.

=== Manhattan Project ===
In 1943, Ramsey was approached by Robert Oppenheimer and Robert Bacher, who asked him to join the Manhattan Project. Ramsey agreed to do so, but the intervention of the project director, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves Jr., was necessary in order to prise him away from the Secretary of War&#x27;s office. A compromise was agreed to, whereby Ramsey remained on the payroll of the Secretary of War and was merely seconded to the Manhattan Project. In October 1943, Group E-7 of the Ordnance Division was created at the Los Alamos Laboratory with Ramsey as group leader, with the task of integrating the design and delivery of the nuclear weapons being built by the laboratory.

The first thing he had to do was determine the characteristics of the aircraft that would be used. There were only two Allied aircraft large enough: the British Avro Lancaster and the US Boeing B-29 Superfortress. The United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) wanted to use the B-29 if at all possible, even though it required substantial modification. Ramsey supervised the test drop program, which began at Dahlgren, Virginia, in August 1943, before moving to Muroc Dry Lake, California, in March 1944. Mock-ups of Thin Man and Fat Man bombs were dropped and tracked by an SCR-584 ground-based radar set of the kind that Ramsey had helped develop at the Radiation laboratory. Numerous problems were discovered with the bombs and the aircraft modifications, and corrected.

Plans for the delivery of the weapons in combat were assigned to the Weapons Committee, which was chaired by Ramsey and answerable to Captain William S. Parsons. Ramsey drew up tables of organization and equipment for the Project Alberta detachment that would accompany the USAAF&#x27;s 509th Composite Group to Tinian. Ramsey briefed the 509th&#x27;s commander, Lieutenant Colonel Paul W. Tibbets, on the nature of the mission when the latter assumed command of the 509th. Ramsey went to Tinian with the Project Alberta detachment as Parsons&#x27;s scientific and technical deputy. He was involved in the assembly of the Fat Man bomb and relayed Parsons&#x27;s message indicating the success of the bombing of Hiroshima to Groves in Washington, D.C.

== Research ==
At the end of the war, Ramsey returned to Columbia as a professor and research scientist. Rabi and Ramsey picked up where they had left off before the war with their molecular-beam experiments. Ramsey and his first graduate student, William Nierenberg, measured various nuclear magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments. With Rabi, he helped establish the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island. In 1946, he became the first head of the Physics Department there. His time there was brief, for in 1947, he joined the physics faculty at Harvard University, where he would remain for the next 40 years, except for brief visiting professorships at Middlebury College, Oxford University, Mt. Holyoke College and the University of Virginia. During the 1950s, he was the first science adviser to NATO and initiated a series of fellowships, grants and summer school programs to train European scientists.

Ramsey&#x27;s research in the immediate post-war years looked at measuring fundamental properties of atoms and molecules by use of molecular beams. On moving to Harvard, his objective was to carry out accurate molecular-beam magnetic-resonance experiments, based on the techniques developed by Rabi. However, the accuracy of the measurements depended on the uniformity of the magnetic field, and Ramsey found that it was difficult to create sufficiently uniform magnetic fields. He developed the separated oscillatory field method in 1949 as a means of achieving the accuracy he wanted.

Ramsey and his PhD student Daniel Kleppner developed the atomic-hydrogen maser, looking to increase the accuracy with which the hyperfine separations of atomic hydrogen, deuterium and tritium could be measured, as well as to investigate how much the hyperfine structure was affected by external magnetic and electric fields. He also participated in developing an extremely stable clock based on a hydrogen maser. From 1967 until 2019, the second has been defined based on 9,192,631,770 Hz hyperfine transition of a cesium-133 atom; the atomic clock which is used to set this standard is an application of Ramsey&#x27;s work. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1989 &quot;for the invention of the separated oscillatory fields method and its use in the hydrogen maser and other atomic clocks&quot;. The Prize was shared with Hans Georg Dehmelt and Wolfgang Paul.

In collaboration with the Institut Laue–Langevin, Ramsey also worked on applying similar methods to beams of neutrons, measuring the neutron magnetic moment and finding a limit to its electric dipole moment. As president of the Universities Research Association during the 1960s he was involved in the design and construction of the Fermilab in Batavia, Illinois. He also headed a 1982 National Research Council committee that concluded that, contrary to the findings of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations, acoustic evidence did not indicate the presence of a second gunman&#x27;s involvement in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

== Later life ==
Ramsey eventually became the Eugene Higgins professor of physics at Harvard and retired in 1986. However, he remained active in physics, spending a year as a research fellow at the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics (JILA) at the University of Colorado. He also continued visiting professorships at the University of Chicago, Williams College and the University of Michigan. In addition to the Nobel Prize in Physics, Ramsey received a number of awards, including the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award in 1960, Davisson–Germer Prize in 1974, the IEEE Medal of Honor in 1984, the Rabi Prize in 1985, the Rumford Premium Prize in 1985, the Compton Medal in 1986, and the Oersted Medal and the National Medal of Science in 1988. In 1990, Ramsey received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. He was an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the United States National Academy of Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society. In 2004, he signed a letter along with 47 other Nobel laureates endorsing John Kerry for President of the United States as someone who would &quot;restore science to its appropriate place in government&quot;.

His first wife, Elinor, died in 1983, after which he married Ellie Welch of Brookline, Massachusetts. Ramsey died on November 4, 2011. He was survived by his wife Ellie, his four daughters from his first marriage, and his stepdaughter and stepson from his second marriage.

<text>Arapaho Center station (formerly Richardson Transit Center) is an intermodal public transit station in Richardson, Texas. Operated by Dallas Area Rapid Transit, the station services DART&#x27;s and three bus routes. During peak periods, the station also services the . The facility is DART&#x27;s main bus transfer center in Richardson and includes an indoor waiting area.

The station is located at the intersection of Greenville Avenue and Arapaho Road, one block east of North Central Expressway (US 75). It services the Richardson Civic Center complex and the southern portions of Richardson&#x27;s Telecom Corridor, including facilities for Honeywell and Verizon. A bus route at the station provides service to the University of Texas at Dallas.

== Station ==
Arapaho Center station consists of both a bus transfer facility and a rail station, which are located on opposite sides of Greenville Avenue. The bus side of the facility includes a large parking lot, two air-conditioned waiting rooms, and restrooms.

A short pedestrian tunnel under Greenville Avenue connects the bus and rail platforms. A street-level signaled crosswalk is also available. At the bus-side entrance to the crosswalk is an reproduction of Hans Van de Bovenkamp&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Gateway&quot; and matching benches.

== History ==

=== Richardson Transit Center ===
DART first began bus service to Richardson in 1984 with an express bus route to Downtown Dallas. The route used Richardson Terrace Shopping Center as a temporary park-and-ride lot.

In 1989, DART broke ground on Richardson Transit Center, a $2 million parking lot and indoor waiting facility that would replace the Richardson Terrace park-and-ride. The facility opened the following year on August 27, 1990. It was the fourth indoor facility to be built by DART, after South Irving Transit Center, North Carrollton Transit Center, and West Plano Transit Center.

=== Arapaho Center ===
Original plans for the rail platforms at Richardson Transit Center called for a signaled pedestrian crosswalk to the parking lot and bus facility. Due to safety concerns, DART and the city opted to build a tunnel between the two platforms. The construction of the tunnel also led to improvements to the Arapaho/Greenville intersection, such as the addition of turn lanes.

On June 29, 2002, DART held an event, Super Saturday, at Arapaho Center and Forest Lane station to celebrate the Red Line&#x27;s next extension, which would run from Park Lane to Galatyn Park. The extension, which included Arapaho Center, was officially inaugurated the following Monday.

When its rail service opened, Arapaho Center was the northernmost Red Line station with a park-and-ride lot, which resulted in the station&#x27;s lot regularly exceeding capacity on workdays. Parking concerns at Arapaho subsided in December 2002 following the Red Line&#x27;s next extension, which added two more park-and-ride stations (namely Bush Turnpike and Parker Road) to the line.

<text>Spring Valley station is a DART light rail station in Richardson, Texas. The station is located on Spring Valley Road, approximately east of North Central Expressway (US 75). It serves the and, during peak periods, the .

The station serves southern Richardson, including the headquarters of fashion company Fossil Group. The station is adjacent to Brick Row, a mixed-use development which contains apartments, townhomes, condominiums, and retail space.

== History ==
An elevated station on Spring Valley Road was first proposed and approved in 1997. The station was expected to serve commuters on Spring Valley, including the then-headquarters for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas. The city of Richardson sought a state grant to build a pedestrian bridge between the station and local businesses, but no bridge was ever built.

The station was constructed as part of the Red Line&#x27;s second expansion, which stretched from Walnut Hill to Galatyn Park. Construction of the extension started in 1999. The station was decorated with a floral theme and two brick sculptures. The extension was opened to revenue service on July 1, 2002.

=== Development ===
Shortly before the station opened, the City of Richardson announced a study to determine development plans around Spring Valley station, Arapaho Center station, and a proposed station in downtown Richardson. In 2004, the city announced the creation of the Spring Valley Station District, a 61-acre mixed-use development zone in the area surrounding the station.

In 2006, plans were announced for Centennial Park, a 30-acre project directly east of the station in the Spring Valley Station District. The development would include apartments, townhomes, and condominiums for a total of 950 residences. In 2008, shortly after construction began, the development was renamed Brick Row.

<text>LBJ/Central station is a DART light rail station in Dallas, Texas that serves the Red Line and Orange Line. During non-peak hours (mornings, evenings, and weekends), it serves as the eastern terminus of the Orange Line.

The station is named for the intersection of Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway (I-635) and North Central Expressway (US 75), which it is adjacent to. The station services the two Dallas campuses of Texas Instruments through employee shuttles. It also services Dallas College Richland Campus through a bus route.

== History ==
Plans for a station servicing Texas Instruments date back to DART&#x27;s 1983 rail plan. The plan called for the station to be the northern terminus of a starter corridor along North Central Expressway.

Detailed plans for the station were completed in 1997. The plan included a large park-and-ride lot intended for use by commuters on LBJ Freeway, particularly those using LBJ&#x27;s high-occupancy vehicle lanes, which DART operated at the time.

The station was built atop two baseball fields, which were donated to DART by Texas Instruments. As part of the construction, DART expanded Markville Drive (on the southern side of the station) to meet Floyd Road (now TI Boulevard).

In tribute to Texas Instruments, the station&#x27;s façade was decorated with circuit boards. The station&#x27;s canopy was decorated with translucent panels honoring local organizations and individuals, including TI&#x27;s Jack Kilby. The station was opened on July 1, 2002 as part of the Red Line&#x27;s third expansion, which expanded the line from Park Lane to Galatyn Park.

<text>Forest Lane station is a DART light rail station in northeastern Dallas, Texas. The elevated station, which serves the and , is located on Forest Lane, east of North Central Expressway (US 75) and south of Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway (I-635).

The station serves the Medical City Dallas hospital complex, the Cottonwood Trail, and the Hamilton Park neighborhood. In tribute to the largely African-American population of Hamilton Park, the station features a sculpture dedicated to African-Americans who fought against housing segregation.

== History ==

=== North Central Transit Center ===
Northeastern Dallas was originally serviced by the North Central Transit Center, a park-and-ride bus station located between North Central Expressway and Coit Road. The transit center was announced by the Texas Department of Transportation in 1983, several months before DART&#x27;s formation; it was opened in 1985.

The lot consisted of an air-conditioned waiting area and 1,300 parking spaces. In addition to servicing DART, the center was intended to service Surtran, a municipal bus service connecting Dallas to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, but Surtran was discontinued in 1985.

The lot was closed after Forest Lane opened in 2002, with all its bus routes moving to Forest Lane station. The lot was left unused for several years before it was redeveloped; it is currently the location of a Costco store.

=== Forest Lane ===
Forest Lane station opened on July 1, 2002, as part of the Red Line&#x27;s second major expansion. The Saturday before, an opening ceremony, dubbed &quot;Super Saturday&quot;, was held at both the Forest Lane and Arapaho Center stations.

In May 2011, the Cottonwood Trail was extended south from North Central Expressway to the White Rock Creek Trail. The extension included a trailhead at Forest Lane, which was the first trailhead to be located at any DART station.

<doc id="503399" wikidata="Q1295062" url="?curid=503399" title="List of high priests of Israel">
<text>This article gives a list of the high priests (&quot;Kohen Gadol&quot;) of ancient Israel up to the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 AD. Because of a lack of historical data, this list is incomplete and there may be gaps.
The High Priests, like all Jewish priests, belonged to the Aaronic line. The Bible mentions the majority of high priests before the Babylonian captivity, but does not give a complete list of office holders. Lists would be based on various historical sources. In several periods of non-Jewish rule, high priests were appointed and removed by kings, but still most high priests came from the Aaronic line. One exception is Menelaus, who may not have been from the Tribe of Levi at all, but from the Tribe of Benjamin.

==List==
===From the Exodus to Solomon&#x27;s Temple===
The following lineage appears in :
* Aaron
* Eleazar, son of Aaron
* Phinehas, son of Eleazar
* Abishua, son of Phinehas
** The Samaritans insert Sashai as the son of Abishua and father of Bukki.
* Bukki, son of Abishua
* Uzzi, son of Bukki
Although Abishua, Bukki and Uzzi are not directly attested as high priests, this portion of the genealogy is assumed by other sources to give the succession of the high priesthood from father to son.

At some time, the office was transferred from descendants of Eleazar to those of his brother Itamar. The first known and most notable high priest of Itamar&#x27;s line was Eli, a contemporary of Samuel.

* Eli, descendant of Ithamar, son of Aaron 
* Ahitub, son of Phinehas and grandson of Eli
* Ahijah, son of Ahitub
* Ahimelech, son of Ahijah (or brother of Ahijah and son of Ahitub)
* Abiathar, son of Ahimelech

Abiathar was removed from the high priesthood for conspiring against King Solomon, and was replaced by Zadok, who oversaw the construction of the First Temple. According to the genealogies given in , Zadok was a descendant of Uzzi (through Zerahiah, Meraioth, Amariah and Ahitub) and thus belonged to the line of Eleazar.

===First Temple period===

Priestly lists for this period appear in the Bible, Josephus and the &quot;Seder Olam Zutta&quot;, but with differences. While Josephus and &quot;Seder &#x27;Olam Zuta&quot; each mention 18 high priests, the genealogy given in gives 12 names, culminating in the last high priest Seriah, father of Jehozadak. However, it is unclear whether all those mentioned in the genealogy between Zadok and Jehozadak were high priests, and whether high priests mentioned elsewhere (such as Jehoiada and Jehoiarib) are simply omitted or did not belong to the male line in this genealogy.
Some name Jehozadak, son of Seriah, as a high priest prior to being sent to captivity in Babylonia, based on the biblical references to &quot;Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest&quot;. According to the commentary attributed to Rashi, this is a misreading of the phrase, as &quot;the high priest&quot; does not refer to Jehozadak (who was exiled without having served as high priest), but to his son Joshua.

===After the Babylonian captivity===

The high priests following the exile were:
* Joshua, son of Jehozadak, after the building of the Second Temple. Contemporary of Cyrus the Great (reigned 538–530 BCE) and Darius I (reigned 522–486 BCE).
* Joiakim, son of Joshua ().
* Eliashib, son of Joiakim (Nehemiah 12:10). Mentioned in the time of Nehemiah in 444 BCE.
* Joiada, son of Eliashib (Nehemiah 12:10). (A son married a daughter of Sanballat the Horonite, for which he was driven out of the Temple by Nehemiah)
* Johanan, son of Joiada (Nehemiah 12:11). Mentioned in the Elephantine papyri in 410 BCE.
* Jaddua, son of Johanan (Nehemiah 12:11). Contemporary of Alexander the Great (reigned 336–323 BCE). Some have identified him as Simeon the Just.

Moreover, there are some sources in Rabbinic tradition that supports the notion that Ezra may have served as Kohen Gadol. 

The chronology given above, based on Josephus, however is not undisputed, with some alternatively placing Jaddua during the time of Darius II (423–405/4 BC) and some supposing one more Johanan and one more Jaddua in the following time, the latter Jaddua being contemporary of Alexander the Great.

* Onias I, son of Jaddua. Contemporary of Areus I of Sparta (reigned 309–265 BCE).
* Simon I, son of Onias. Josephus identified him as Simeon the Just
* Eleazar, son of Onias and brother of Simon I. Contemporary of Ptolemy II Philadelphus of Egypt (reigned 283–246 BCE).
* Manasseh, son of Jaddua, brother of Onias I and uncle of Simon I and Eleazar.
* Onias II, son of Simon I. Contemporary of Ptolemy III Euergetes of Egypt (reigned 246–221 BCE).
* Simon II, son of Onias II. Contemporary of Ptolemy IV Philopator of Egypt (221–204 BCE).
* Onias III, son of Simon II (?–175 BC), murdered 170 BCE
** Onias IV, son of Onias III, fled to Egypt and in c. 150 BCE built a Jewish Temple at Leontopolis (closed between 66–73 CE).
* Jason, son of Simon II, 175–172 BCE (the last of the Zadokite dynasty).
* Menelaus, 172–165 BCE
* Judas Maccabeus, son of Mattathias (son of the murdered Onias III son of Simon II, of Zadokite ancestry), 165–162 BCE (held the office after the consecration of the Temple)
* Alcimus, 162–159 BCE

===Inter-sacerdotium===
It is unknown who held the position of High Priest of Jerusalem between Alcimus&#x27; death and the accession of Jonathan Apphus. Josephus relates that the office was vacant for seven years, but this is highly unlikely, if not impossible. As the Yom Kippur Temple service requires the high priest, Josephus&#x27; account would suggest a seven-year gap in service soon after the restoration of the Temple. Politically, Israel&#x27;s overlords probably would not have allowed a power vacuum to last for so long.

Elsewhere, Josephus suggests that Judas Maccabeus, the brother of Jonathan, held the office for three years, succeeding Alcimus. However, Judas actually predeceased Alcimus by one year. The nature of Jonathan&#x27;s accession to the high priesthood makes it unlikely that Judas held that office during the inter-sacerdotium. The &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; tries to harmonise the contradictions found in Josephus by supposing that Judas held the office &quot;immediately after the consecration of the Temple (165–162), that is, before the election of Alcimus&quot;.

It has been argued that the founder of the Qumran community, the Teacher of Righteousness, was High Priest (but not necessarily the sole occupant) during the inter-sacerdotium and was driven off by Jonathan.

===Hasmonean dynasty===
* Jonathan Apphus, 153–143 BCE
* Simon Thassi, brother of Jonathan Apphus, 142–134 BCE
* John Hyrcanus I, son of Simeon Tassi, 134–104 BCE
* Aristobulus I, son of John Hyrcanus, 104–103 BCE
* Alexander Jannaeus, son of John Hyrcanus, 103–76 BCE
* John Hyrcanus II, son of Alexander Jannaeus, 76–66 BCE
* Aristobulus II, son of Alexander Jannaeus, 66–63 BCE
* Hyrcanus II (restored), 63–40 BCE
* Antigonus, son of Aristobulus II, 40–37 BCE

===Herodian-Roman period===
* Ananelus, 37–36 BCE
* Aristobulus III, grandson of Aristobulus II and Hyrcanus II, 36 BCE (He was the last of the Hasmoneans; brother of Herod&#x27;s second wife Mariamne I)
* Ananelus (restored), 36–30 BCE
* Joshua ben Fabus, 30–23 BCE
* Simon ben Boethus, 23–5 BCE (his daughter Mariamne II was the third wife of Herod the Great)
* Matthias ben Theophilus, 5-4 BCE
* Joazar ben Boethus, 4 BCE
* Eleazar ben Boethus, 4–3 BCE
* Joshua ben Sie, 3 BCE – ?
* Joazar ben Boethus (restored), ? – 6 CE
* Ananus ben Seth, 6–15
* Ishmael ben Fabus (Phiabi), 15–16
* Eleazar ben Ananus, 16–17
* Simon ben Camithus, 17–18

<text>Walnut Hill station is a DART light rail station in Dallas, Texas. It is served by the and the . The elevated station is located at the intersection of Walnut Hill Lane and Manderville Lane, roughly halfway between North Central Expressway (US 75) and Greenville Avenue, with exits on both the northern and southern sides of Walnut Hill Lane.

The station serves the northern portions of the Vickery Meadow neighborhood, including Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital and the mixed-use development The Hill.

In tribute to the hospital, the station&#x27;s columns are decorated with health-related words, and the station contains four pendulums representing that &quot;time heals&quot;. The façade was created by local artist Linnea Glatt as part of DART&#x27;s Station Art &amp; Design Program.

== History ==
Walnut Hill station opened on July 1, 2002, as part of the Red Line&#x27;s second expansion. The station is one of four elevated stations in the expansion, alongside Spring Valley, Forest Lane, and a rebuilt Park Lane.

At opening, Walnut Hill had no passenger parking, as it was considered a &quot;destination&quot; station, though a 200-space parking lot was proposed. In 2005, following a spike in ridership as a result of high gas prices, DART announced plans to add a parking lot for the station by the end of 2006, with a lot appearing north of Glen Lakes Drive.

<doc id="503403" wikidata="Q2078042" url="?curid=503403" title="Texas State Capitol">
<text>The Texas State Capitol is the capitol and seat of government of the U.S. state of Texas. Located in downtown Austin, Texas, the structure houses the offices and chambers of the Texas Legislature and of the Governor of Texas. Designed in 1881 by architect Elijah E. Myers, it was constructed from 1882 to 1888 under the direction of civil engineer Reuben Lindsay Walker. A $75 million underground extension was completed in 1993. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970 and recognized as a National Historic Landmark in 1986.

The Texas State Capitol is tall, making it the sixth-tallest state capitol and one of several taller than the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. The capitol was ranked 92nd in the 2007 &quot;America&#x27;s Favorite Architecture&quot; poll commissioned by the American Institute of Architects.

==History==

The current Texas State Capitol is the fourth building to serve that purpose in Austin. The first was a two-room wooden structure (located on the northeast corner of 8th St and Colorado St) which served as the national capitol of the Texas Republic and continued as the seat of government upon Texas&#x27; admission to the Union. The second Texas capitol was built of limestone in 1853, on the same site as the present capitol in Austin; it was destroyed by fire in 1881, but plans had already been made to replace it with a new, much larger structure. A temporary capitol was then constructed across the street at 11th St and Congress Ave in 1882. The temporary capitol later burned down in a fire also in 1899.

===Construction===
Construction of the Italian Renaissance Revival–style capitol was funded by an article of the state constitution, adopted on February 15, 1876, which authorized the sale of public lands for the purpose. In one of the largest barter transactions of recorded history, the builders of the capitol (John V. Farwell and Charles B. Farwell), known as the Capitol Syndicate, were paid with more than three million acres (12,000 km2) of public land in the Texas Panhandle; this tract later became the largest cattle ranch in the world, the XIT Ranch. The value of the land, combined with expenses, added to a total cost of $3.7 million for the original building. It was constructed largely by convicts or migrant workers, as many as a thousand at a time. The building has been renovated several times, with central air conditioning installed in 1955 and the most recent refurbishments completed in 1997.

The designers originally planned for the building to be clad entirely with hill country limestone quarried in Oatmanville (present-day Oak Hill), about to the southwest. However, the high iron content of the limestone led it to discolor rapidly with rust stains when exposed to the elements. Learning of the problem, business partners George W. Lacy, Nimrod L. Norton, and William H. Westfall, who were the owners of Granite Mountain near Marble Falls, offered to donate to the state, free of charge, the necessary amount of sunset red (also known as pink) granite to sheathe the building. A new 2.3 mile (3.7 km) spur of the Austin and Northwestern Railroad was constructed to transport the stone from Granite Mountain Quarry to the Austin train terminal. This new branch of the railway line had one fault however: there was a bend in the tracks that was a bit too sharp and trains would occasionally derail, accidentally dumping some of the pink granite. Many of the fallen rocks remain in place and are a local point of interest. Oak Hill limestone does comprise much of the Capitol but most is hidden behind the walls or is in the foundations. Granite Mountain red (or pink) granite was subsequently used for many state government buildings in the Austin area. The project&#x27;s 900 workers included 86 granite cutters brought from Scotland.

The cornerstone for the building was laid on March 2, 1885, Texas Independence Day, and the building was opened to the public on April 21, 1888, San Jacinto Day, before its completion. The building was officially dedicated by Texas State Senator Temple Houston on May 18, 1888. The dedication ceremony was marked by a weeklong celebration from May 14–19, 1888, that attracted nearly 20,000 visitors and included events such as military drill demonstrations, cattle roping, baseball games, German choral singing, and fireworks. Guests were able to purchase souvenirs such as pieces of red granite and copies of a song written by composer and pianist Leonora Rives-Diaz called the &quot;State Capitol Grand Waltz&quot;.

===Capitol View Corridors===
In 1931, the City of Austin enacted a local ordinance limiting the height of new buildings to a maximum of , aiming to preserve the visual preeminence of the capitol. From that time until the early 1960s, only the University of Texas Main Building Tower was built higher than the limit, but in 1962, developers announced a new high-rise residential building to be built adjacent to the capitol, called the Westgate Tower. Governor Price Daniel voiced his opposition to the proposed tower, and State Representative Henry Grover of Houston introducing a bill to condemn the property, which was defeated in the Texas House of Representatives by only two votes. The Westgate was eventually completed in 1966, but the controversy over the preservation of the capitol&#x27;s visual presence that dogged its construction continued to grow.

The Westgate was followed by even taller structures: first the Dobie Center (designed in 1968), and then a series of ever larger downtown bank towers, culminating in the One American Center (designed in 1982). In early 1983, inspired by the Westgate and these other structures, State Senator Lloyd Doggett and State Representative Gerald Hill advanced a bill proposing a list of protected &quot;Capitol View Corridors&quot; along which construction would not be permitted, so as to protect the capitol&#x27;s visibility from a series of points around Austin. The bill was signed into law on May 3, 1983, defining 30 state-protected viewing corridors and prohibiting any construction that would intersect one of them. The City of Austin has adopted similar rules, so that the majority of the corridors are also protected under municipal zoning code, as well as under state law.

===Capitol extension and restorations===

On February 6, 1983, a fire began in the apartment of William P. Hobby Jr., then the state lieutenant governor. A guest of Hobby&#x27;s was killed, and four firemen and a policeman were injured by the subsequent blaze. The capitol was crowded with accumulated archives, and the fire was intense and came dangerously close to destroying the structure. It caused severe damage to the east wing and compromised much of the framing, which was largely composed of exposed cast iron posts and beams.

Following the fire, the state took advantage of the extensive rebuilding to update the mechanical and structural systems to modern standards. In November 1985, the original Goddess of Liberty statue on top of the dome was removed by helicopter. A new statue, cast of aluminum in molds made from the original zinc statue, was placed on the dome in June 1986 by the Mississippi National Guard, since Texas lacked the capacity to lift the approx. 3,000-pound statue. The original statue was restored and displayed on the Capitol grounds in a special structure built for it in 1995; it was later moved to the Bullock Texas State History Museum in 2001.

The Old Texas Land Office, on the Capitol grounds, was rebuilt and updated between 1988 and 1990, after which the Capitol Visitors Center was moved there, freeing space in the Capitol. Previously, the building had housed the Texas Confederate Museum, which began in a ground floor room of the Capitol (1903–1920), before moving to the Land Office building.

Additionally, the state sought to address the intensifying shortage of space in the old building, deciding that a new office wing should be added. The logical place for an addition was the plaza immediately to the north; however, a large building there would have eliminated the historic north façade and covered what had traditionally been seen as an important public space. Instead, an expansion to the capitol was built &quot;beneath&quot; the north plaza, connecting to the existing capitol underground.

In 1993, the $75 million, four-story, underground capitol extension was completed to the north, doubling the square footage available to capitol occupants and providing much-improved functionality. Though the extension encompasses (nearly twice the floor space of the original building), little evidence exists of such a large structure at ground level, except for extensive skylights camouflaged as planter rows, and the four-story, open-air, inverted rotunda. In 1995, a comprehensive interior and exterior restoration of the original building was completed at a cost of about $98 million. In 1997, the park-like grounds surrounding the capitol received an $8 million renovation and restoration.

In 2016 the Texas Capitol Complex began a master renovation project. Involving the participation and collaboration of The Texas Facilities Commission, the Partnership Advisory Commission, Texas General Land Office, Texas State Preservation Board, Texas Historical Commission, the project sought to create the Texas Mall—an expansion of the Capitol Extension open space. Another goal was to address the rising cost of leased office space for state agencies which were then dispersed around the city by concentrating them in State-owned facilities. After the project completion, Congress Avenue became a pedestrian-only tree-lined mall with lawn panels extending north of 15th Street to 18th Street. Vehicular access for these blocks is now limited to emergency and service vehicles. The lawn panels continue from 18th Street to Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard with travel 
lanes for vehicular drop off.

==Design and features==

The Texas State Capitol and grounds are located on a hilltop overlooking downtown Austin, with the main entrance facing onto the Congress Avenue Historic District to the south, for which it forms a terminating vista. The northern edge of the capitol grounds lies four blocks south of the University of Texas at Austin.

===Building===
The capitol is a roughly rectangular building with a four-story central block, symmetrical three-story wings extending to the east and west, and a dome rising from the center. It is built in an Italian Renaissance Revival style and modeled on the design of the United States Capitol, but with its exterior clad with local red granite. It contains of floor space (not including the Capitol Extension), more than any other state capitol building, and rests on a footprint. The building has nearly 400 rooms and more than 900 windows.

The interior of the central portion forms an open rotunda beneath the dome. Massive cast-iron staircases flanking the rotunda connect the various levels of the building. The two chambers of the Texas Legislature (the Texas Senate and Texas House of Representatives) meet in large, double-height spaces in the centers of the two wings on the second floor, overlooked by public galleries on the third floor. The remainder of the building is filled with office space, courts, and archives; additional offices fill the underground extension.
====Public art and museums====
The central rotunda is hung with portraits of all the past presidents of the Republic of Texas and governors of the State of Texas; the rotunda is also a whispering gallery. The south foyer features a large portrait of David Crockett, a painting depicting the surrender of General Santa Anna at the Battle of San Jacinto, and sculptures of Sam Houston and Stephen F. Austin made by Elisabet Ney. The Texas Confederate Museum was held in a room on the first floor from its opening in 1903 until 1920, when it was moved into the General Land Office Building (today the Capitol Visitors Center).

===Grounds===
The Capitol building is surrounded by of grounds scattered with statues and monuments. William Munro Johnson, civil engineer, was hired in 1888 to improve the appearance of the grounds. By the time the first monument, commemorating the Heroes of the Alamo, was installed in 1891, the major components of Johnson&#x27;s plan were in place. These included a &quot;Great Walk&quot; of black and white diamond-patterned pavement shaded by trees. The four oldest monuments are the Heroes of the Alamo Monument (1891), Volunteer Firemen Monument (1896), Confederate Soldiers Monument (1903) and Terry&#x27;s Texas Rangers Monument (1907), and these flank the tree-lined Great Walk. In the spring of 2013, ground was broken for the Texas Capitol Vietnam Veterans Monument; dedication took place on March 29, 2014.

A granite monument of the Ten Commandments on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol was the topic of a 2005 U.S. Supreme Court case, &quot;Van Orden v. Perry,&quot; in which the display was challenged as unconstitutional. In late June 2005, the Court in a 5–4 ruling declared that the display was not unconstitutional.

For visitors, the Capitol and downtown Austin feature several convenient garages along with on street parking.

<doc id="503405" wikidata="Q1234032" url="?curid=503405" title="Sumner Welles">
<text>Benjamin Sumner Welles (October 14, 1892September 24, 1961) was an American government official and diplomat. He was a major foreign policy adviser to President Franklin D. Roosevelt and served as Under Secretary of State from 1936 to 1943, during Roosevelt&#x27;s presidency.

Born in New York City to a wealthy, well-connected political family, Welles graduated from Harvard College in 1914. He entered the Foreign Service at the advice of Franklin Roosevelt, who was a family friend. Welles was excited by Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s ideas about how American principles could reorder the international system based on liberal democracy, free-trade capitalism, international law, a league of nations, and an end to colonialism.

Welles specialized in Latin American diplomatic affairs and served several posts in Washington and in the field. President Calvin Coolidge distrusted Welles because of his divorce, and dismissed him from the foreign service. Welles left public service for some years, and wrote a book on the history of the Dominican Republic.

When Roosevelt was elected president in 1932, he put Welles in charge of Latin American affairs as Assistant Secretary of State for Latin American Affairs. Welles became heavily involved in negotiations that removed Cuban president Gerardo Machado from power and replaced him with rival Carlos Manuel de Céspedes y Quesada. He was later promoted to Under Secretary of State, in which role he continued to be active in Latin American issues, but also expanded into European affairs as World War II began in Europe in 1939. In 1940, he issued the Welles Declaration which condemned Soviet occupation of the Baltic states and proved to be a minor point of contention among the Soviets and their Western allies once the U.S. entered the war in 1941. Welles used American power and his senior position to intrude into the domestic affairs of other countries, especially choosing leaders who supported American policies. After the fall of France, he downgraded French affairs because they no longer were a major power. Roosevelt relied on Welles much more than on the official Secretary of State, Cordell Hull, who became the enemy of Welles.

Welles was forced out of government service by Secretary Hull after his enemies began to spread word of a 1943 incident in which he had propositioned two male railroad porters for sex. Returning to private life, he continued to write books on foreign relations and became an advisor to media organizations. He was a target of the House Un-American Activities Committee during the post-war &quot;red scare&quot;, though he was never formally sanctioned. He died in New Jersey in 1961, survived by his third wife and two children from his first marriage.

==Early life==
Benjamin Sumner Welles was born in New York City, the son of Benjamin Sumner Welles Jr. (1857–1935) and Frances Wyeth Swan (1863–1911). He preferred to be called Sumner after his famous relative Charles Sumner, a leading Senator from Massachusetts during the Civil War and Reconstruction. His family was wealthy and was connected to the era&#x27;s most prominent families. He was a grandnephew of Caroline Webster Schermerhorn Astor, known as &quot;&quot;the&quot; Mrs. Astor&quot;. Among his ancestors were Thomas Welles, a colonial Governor of Connecticut, and Increase Sumner, Governor of Massachusetts from 1797 to 1799. Although the two men were occasionally mistaken for cousins, Welles was no relation to director Orson Welles.

The Welles family was also connected to the Roosevelts. A cousin of Sumner Welles married James &quot;Rosy&quot; Roosevelt, Jr., half-brother of future President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR). At the age of 10, Welles was entered in Miss Kearny&#x27;s Day School for Boys in New York City. In September 1904, he entered Groton School in Massachusetts, where he remained for six years. There he roomed with Hall Roosevelt, the brother of Eleanor Roosevelt. In March 1905 at the age of 12 Welles served as a page at Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s wedding to Eleanor.

Welles attended Harvard College where he studied &quot;economics, Iberian literature and culture&quot;, and graduated after three years in 1914.

==Diplomatic career==
After graduating from Harvard, Welles followed the advice of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and joined the U.S. Foreign Service. A &quot;New York Times&quot; profile described him while he joined the foreign service: &quot;Tall, slender, blond, and always correctly tailored, he concealed a natural shyness under an appearance of dignified firmness. Although intolerant of inefficiency, he brought to bear unusual tact and a self-imposed patience.&quot; He secured an assignment to Tokyo, where he served in the embassy as third secretary only briefly.

===Latin America===
Welles soon became a specialist in Latin American affairs. He served in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1919 and became fluent in Spanish. In 1921, Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes appointed him to head the Division of Latin American Affairs.

In March 1922, Welles briefly resigned from the State Department. He was unsympathetic to the view held by American diplomacy that military might was meant to protect the overseas interests of U.S. business. Hughes brought him back the next year as a special commissioner to the Dominican Republic. His particular assignment was to oversee the withdrawal of U.S. forces and to negotiate protection for overseas investors in the Dominican Republic&#x27;s debt. Welles remained in that post for three years and his work was accomplished after his departure in a 1924 treaty.

In 1924, U.S. President Calvin Coolidge sent Welles to act as mediator between disputing parties in Honduras. The country had lacked a legitimate government since the election of 1923 failed to produce a majority for any candidate and the legislature had failed to exercise its power to appoint a new president. Negotiations managed by Welles from April 23 to 28 produced an interim government under General Vicente Tosta, who promised to appoint a cabinet representing all factions and to schedule a presidential election as soon as possible in which he would not be a candidate. Negotiations ended with the signing of an agreement aboard the USS &quot;Milwaukee&quot; in the port of Amapala.

===Years out of government service===
Coolidge, however, disapproved of Welles&#x27;s 1925 marriage to Mathilde Scott Townsend, who had only recently divorced the President&#x27;s friend, Senator Peter Gerry of Rhode Island. He promptly ended Welles&#x27;s diplomatic career.

Welles then retired to his estate at Oxon Hill, Maryland. He devoted himself to writing and his two-volume history of the Dominican Republic, &quot;Naboth&#x27;s Vineyard: The Dominican Republic, 1844–1924&quot; appeared in 1928. &quot;Time&quot; described the work as &quot;a ponderous, lifeless, two-volume work which was technically a history of Santo Domingo, actually a careful indictment of U.S. foreign policy in the Hemisphere&quot;. James Reston summarized its thesis: &quot;we should keep in our own back yard and stop claiming rights for ourselves that we denied to other sovereign States&quot;.

He served as an unofficial adviser to Dominican President Horacio Vásquez.

During the presidential election of 1932, Welles provided foreign policy expertise to the Roosevelt campaign. He was a major contributor to the campaign as well.

===Cuba===
In April 1933, FDR appointed Welles Assistant Secretary of State for Latin American Affairs, but when a revolution in Cuba against President Gerardo Machado left its government divided and uncertain, he became instead the President&#x27;s special envoy to Cuba. He arrived in Havana in May 1933. His mission was to negotiate a settlement so that the U.S. could avoid intervening as U.S. law, namely the Platt Amendment of 1901, required.

His instructions were to mediate &quot;in any form most suitable&quot; an end to the Cuban situation. Welles promised Machado a new commercial treaty to relieve economic distress if Machado reached a political settlement with his opponents, Colonel Dr. Cosme de la Torriente, from the Nationalist Union; Joaquín Martínez Sáenz, for ABC; Nicasio Silveira, for the Revolutionary Radical Cellular Organization; and Dr. Manuel Dorta-Duque, representing the delegation of the University of Havana. Machado believed the U.S. would help him survive politically. Welles promised the opponents of Machado&#x27;s government a change of government and participation in the subsequent administration, if they joined the mediation process and supported an orderly transfer of power. One crucial step was persuading Machado to issue an amnesty for political prisoners so that the opposition leaders could appear in public. Machado soon lost faith in Welles and denounced U.S. interference as a colonialist adventure. Welles&#x27; mediation process conferred political legitimacy on sectors of the opposition that participated and allowed the U.S. to assess their viability as long-term political allies. Unable to influence Machado, Welles met with Rafael Guas Inclan, president of the Chamber of Representatives, at the home of newspaper publisher Alfredo Hornedo, and requested that he initiate impeachment proceedings against the president. When Guas harshly rebuffed him, Welles then negotiated an end to his presidency, with support from General Alberto Herrera, Colonels Julio Sanguily, Rafael del Castillo, and Erasmo Delgado after threatening U.S. intervention under the Platt Amendment and the restructuring of the Cuban army high command.

In 1937, FDR promoted Welles to Under Secretary, and the Senate promptly confirmed the appointment. Indicative of ongoing rivalries within the State Department, Robert Walton Moore, an ally of Secretary of State Hull was appointed the department&#x27;s Counselor at the same time, a position equal in rank to that of Under Secretary.

===World War II===
In the week following Kristallnacht, in November 1938, the British government offered to give the major part of its quota of 65,000 British citizens eligible for emigration to the United States to Jews fleeing Hitler. Under-Secretary Welles opposed this idea, as he later recounted:

I reminded the Ambassador that the President stated there was no intention on the part of his government to increase the quota for German nationals. I added that it was my strong impression that the responsible leaders among American Jews would be the first to urge that no change in the present quota for German Jews be made ... The influential Sam Rosenman, one of the &quot;responsible&quot; Jewish leaders sent Roosevelt a memorandum telling him that an &quot;increase of quotas is wholly inadvisable. It will merely produce a &#x27;Jewish problem&#x27; in the countries increasing the quota.&quot;

Welles headed the American delegation to the 21-nation Pan American conference that met in Panama in September 1939. He said the conference had been planned in earlier hemispheric meetings in Buenos Aires and Lima and he emphasized the need for consultation on economic issues to &quot;cushion the shock of the dislocation of inter-American commerce arising from the war&quot; in Europe.

In February and March 1940 Welles visited Vatican City, Italy, Germany, and France; (he visited President Albert Lebrun on March 7) and England to receive and discuss German peacemaking proposals. Hitler feared that the purpose of his visits was to drive a wedge between Germany and Italy.

===Soviet occupation of the Baltics===
On July 23, 1940, following the principles of the Stimson Doctrine, Welles issued a statement that became known as the Welles Declaration. In the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August 23, 1939, Germany agreed to allow the Soviet Union to occupy and annex the three Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Welles condemned those actions and refused to recognize the legitimacy of Soviet rule in those countries. More than 50 countries later followed the U.S. in this position.

The declaration was a source of contention during the subsequent alliance between the Americans, the British, and the Soviets, but Welles persistently defended the declaration. In a discussion with the media, he asserted that the Soviets had maneuvered to give &quot;an odor of legality to acts of aggression for purposes of the record.&quot;

In a 1942 memorandum describing his conversations with British Ambassador Lord Halifax, Welles stated that he would have preferred to characterize the plebiscites supporting the annexations as &quot;faked.&quot; In April 1942, he wrote that the annexation was &quot;not only indefensible from every moral standpoint, but likewise extraordinarily stupid.&quot; He believed any concession on the Baltic issue would set a precedent that would lead to additional border struggles in eastern Poland and elsewhere.

===Rivalries===

A &quot;New York Times&quot; profile described Welles in 1941: &quot;Tall and erect, never without his cane, ... he has enough dignity to be Viceroy of India and ... enough influence in this critical era to make his ideas, principles, and dreams count.&quot;

He appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; on August 11, 1941, and in that issue &quot;Time&quot; assessed Welles&#x27;s role within Hull&#x27;s Department of State:

Sumner Welles is one of the very few career men ever to become Under Secretary of State, and as matters now stand may eventually become Secretary ... Grave, saintly Mr. Hull, never an expert at paper-shuffling, has long left the actual administration of the Department to his chief aide, Sumner Welles. And Cordell Hull may choose not to retire. But even if Welles never becomes Secretary, he will still hold his present power: through Presidential choice, his own ability, background and natural stamina, he is the chief administrative officer of U.S. foreign policy.

Roosevelt was always close to Welles and made him the central figure in the State Department, much to the chagrin of secretary Cordell Hull, who could not be removed because he had a powerful political base.

The clash became more public in mid-1943, when &quot;Time&quot; reported &quot;a flare-up of long-smoldering hates and jealousies in the State Department&quot;. After Welles was forced out of office, journalists noted that two men who shared &quot;aims and goals&quot; were at odds because of a &quot;clash of temperament and ambitions&quot;.

===Resignation===

Welles was a closeted bisexual. In September 1940, Welles accompanied Roosevelt to the funeral of former Speaker of the House William B. Bankhead in Huntsville, Alabama. While returning to Washington by train, Welles – who was drunk and under the influence of barbiturates – solicited sex from two male African-American Pullman car porters. Cordell Hull dispatched his confidant, former Ambassador William Bullitt, to provide details of the incident to Republican Senator Owen Brewster of Maine. Brewster, in turn, gave the information to journalist Arthur Krock, a Roosevelt critic; and to Senators Styles Bridges and Burton K. Wheeler. When FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover would not release the file on Welles, Brewster threatened to initiate a senatorial investigation into the incident. (In 1995, Deke DeLoach told C-SPAN&#x27;s Brian Lamb on &quot;Booknotes&quot; that file cabinets behind J. Edgar Hoover&#x27;s secretary Helen Gandy contained two-and-a-half drawers of files, including information about &quot;an undersecretary of state who had committed a homosexual act.&quot;) Roosevelt was embittered by the attack on his friend, believing they were ruining a good man, but he was obliged to accept Welles&#x27;s resignation in 1943. Roosevelt particularly blamed Bullitt; his son Elliott Roosevelt wrote that President Roosevelt believed that Bullitt had bribed the porters to entrap Welles.

In August 1943, reports that Welles had resigned as Under-Secretary of State circulated for more than a week. The press reported it as fact on August 24, despite the lack of an official announcement. Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Arthur Krock said that opinion in Washington saw Welles&#x27;s departure as an attempt to end factionalism in the State Department: &quot;The long-existing struggle disorganized the department, bred Hull and Welles factions among its officials, confused those having business with the department and finally produced pressure on the President to eliminate the causes.&quot; Despite the &quot;personal fondness&quot; of the President and his wife for Welles, he continued, the President sided with Hull because supporting a subordinate would promote revolts in other government agencies, Hull was politically connected and popular with Congress, and the Senate, he was told, would not support Welles for Secretary of State or any other office. Krock added a cryptic explanation: &quot;Other incidents arising made the disagreements between the two men even more personal. It was those which aroused the Senate to opposition to Mr. Welles that was reported to the President.&quot;

While Welles vacationed in Bar Harbor, Maine, &quot;where he held to diplomatically correct silence&quot;, speculation continued for another month without official word from the White House or the State Department. Observers continued to focus on the Hull–Welles relationship and believed that Hull forced the President to choose between them to end &quot;departmental cleavage&quot;. Others read the situation politically and blamed FDR&#x27;s &quot;appeasement of Southern Democrats&quot;. Without confirming his resignation or speaking on the record, Welles indicated he would accept any new assignment the President proposed. Finally, on September 26, 1943, the President announced the resignation of Welles and the appointment of Edward R. Stettinius as the new Under-Secretary of State. He accepted Welles&#x27;s resignation with regret and explained that Welles was prompted to leave government service because of &quot;his wife&#x27;s poor health&quot;. Welles&#x27;s letter of resignation was not made public as was customary and one report concluded, &quot;The facts of this situation remained obscure tonight.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; summarized the reaction of the press: &quot;Its endorsement of Sumner Welles was surprisingly widespread, its condemnation of Franklin Roosevelt and Cordell Hull surprisingly severe.&quot; It also described the resignation&#x27;s impact: &quot;In dropping Sumner Welles [Hull] had dropped the chief architect of the US&#x27;s Good Neighbor Policy in South America, an opponent of those who would do business with Fascists on the basis of expediency, a known and respected advocate of U.S. cooperation in international affairs. The U.S. still awaits a clarification of its foreign policy and the forced resignation of Sumner Welles made an already murky issue even more obscure.&quot;

==Later years==
Welles made his first public appearance following his resignation in October 1943. Speaking to the Foreign Policy Association, he sketched his views of the postwar world, including American participation in a world organization with military capability. He also proposed the creation of regional organizations. He also called on the President to express his opinions and help shape public opinion, praising him at length as &quot;rightly regarded throughout the world as the paladin of the forces of liberal democracy&quot; without once mentioning Hull.

Continuing his career-long focus on Latin America, he said that &quot;if we are to achieve our own security every nation of the Western Hemisphere must also obtain the same ample measure of assurance as ourselves in the world of the future.&quot; He also foresaw the end to colonialism as a guiding principle of the new world order:

Can the peaceful, the stable, and the free world for which we hope be created if it is envisioned from the outset as half slave and half free?—if hundreds of millions of human beings are told that they are destined to remain indefinitely under alien subjection? New and powerful nationalistic forces are breaking into life throughout the earth, and in particular in the vast regions of Africa, of the Near East, and of the Far East. Must not these forces, unless they are to be permitted to start new and devastating inundations, be canalized through the channels of liberty into the great stream of constructive and cooperative human endeavor?

In 1944, Welles lent his name to a fundraising campaign by the United Jewish Appeal to bring Jewish refugees from the Balkans to Palestine.

The same year, he wrote &quot;The Time for Decision&quot;. His proposals for the war&#x27;s end included modifications in Germany&#x27;s borders to transfer East Prussia to Poland and to extend Germany&#x27;s eastern border to include German-speaking populations farther east. Then, he suggested dividing Germany into three states, all of which would be included in a new European customs union. A politically divided Germany would be integrated to an economically cohesive Europe. He also &quot;favoured the transfer of populations to bring ethnic distributions into conformity with international boundaries.&quot; With the public engaged in the debate over America&#x27;s postwar role, &quot;The Time for Decision&quot; sold half a million copies.

Welles became a prominent commentator and author on foreign affairs. In 1945, he joined the American Broadcasting Company to guide the organization of the &quot;Sumner Welles Peace Forum,&quot; a series of four radio broadcasts providing expert commentary on the San Francisco Conference, which wrote the founding document of the United Nations. He undertook a project to edit a series of volumes on foreign relations for Harvard University Press.

In 1948, Welles wrote &quot;We Need Not Fail&quot;, a short book that first presented a history and evaluated the competing claims to Palestine. He argued that American policy should insist on the fulfillment of the 1947 promise of the United Nations General Assembly to establish two independent states within an economic union and policed by a United Nations force. He criticized American officials whose obsession with the Soviets required submission to Arab and oil interests. Enforcing the decision of the United Nations was his overarching concern because it was an opportunity to establish the organization&#x27;s role on the international stage that no other interest could trump.

Later that year, the American Jewish Congress presented Welles with a citation that praised his &quot;courageous championing of the cause of Israel among the nations of the world.&quot;

On December 7, 1948, Welles appeared before HCUA as part of its investigation into allegations between Whittaker Chambers and Alger Hiss (part of the Hiss Case). Later that month (and after the death of his friend Laurence Duggan), he suffered a serious heart attack.

In April 1950, Senator Joseph McCarthy repeatedly charged that the Institute of Pacific Relations (IPR), an organization that fostered the study of the Far East and the Pacific, was a communist front. Welles was a member of the American branch of the IPR.

He remained always in the public eye. For example, his departure on the &quot;Île de France&quot; for Europe was noted even as he declined to comment on charges made by McCarthy about communists in the State Department.

He sold his estate outside Washington in 1952, when Oxon Hill Manor became the home of a &quot;huge collection of Americana.&quot;

In 1956, &quot;Confidential&quot;, a scandal magazine, published a report of the 1940 Pullman incident and linked it to his resignation from the State Department, along with additional instances of inappropriate sexual behavior or drunkenness. Welles had explained the 1940 incident to his family as nothing more than drunken conversation with the train staff. His son Benjamin Welles wrote of the incident in his father&#x27;s biography as drunken advances to several porters at about 4 a.m. that were rejected and then reported to government and railway officials.

==Personal life==

On April 14, 1915, Sumner Welles married Esther &quot;Hope&quot; Slater of Boston, the sister of a Harvard roommate, in Webster, Massachusetts. She came from a similarly prominent family that owned a textile empire based in Massachusetts. She was descended from industrialist Samuel Slater and granddaughter of the Boston painter William Morris Hunt. Welles and his wife had two sons: Benjamin Welles (1916–2002), a foreign correspondent for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, later his father&#x27;s biographer, and Arnold Welles (1918–2002)

In 1923, Slater obtained a divorce from Welles in Paris &quot;on grounds of abandonment and refusal to live with his wife&quot;.

Welles occasionally gained public notice for his art dealings. In 1925, for example, he sold a collection of Japanese screens that had been on exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art for several years.

On June 27, 1925, Welles married Mathilde Scott Townsend (1885–1949), &quot;a noted international beauty&quot; whose portrait had been painted by John Singer Sargent, in upstate New York. Until World War II, the Welleses lived on Massachusetts Avenue in Washington, D.C., in the landmark Townsend Mansion, which later became the home of the Cosmos Club. Mathilde died of peritonitis in 1949 while vacationing in Switzerland with Welles.

Welles spent the bulk of his time a few miles outside of Washington in the Maryland countryside at a 49-room &quot;country cottage&quot; known as Oxon Hill Manor designed for him by Jules Henri de Sibour and built on a 245-acre property in 1929. He entertained foreign dignitaries and diplomats there and hosted informal meetings of senior officials. FDR used the site as an occasional escape from the city as well.

On January 8, 1952, Welles married Harriette Appleton Post, a childhood friend (and a granddaughter of architect George B. Post, designer of the New York Stock Exchange) who had previously married and divorced twice, and had resumed the use of her maiden name, in New York City at the bride&#x27;s home on Fifth Avenue.

He died on September 24, 1961, at age 68 in Bernardsville, New Jersey. He is buried in Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

===Legacy===
The biography written by his son Benjamin Welles concludes:

Sumner Welles made four major contributions to the Roosevelt era. He conceived and carried out the Good Neighbor policy, arguably the all-time, high-water mark in U.S.–Latin American relations. With Roosevelt, Churchill and Alexander Cadogan, he wrote the Atlantic Charter, the cornerstone of the United Nations. In mid–World War II, at FDR&#x27;s direction, he drafted the original UN Charter. And during and after the war, he threw his support behind a national homeland for the Jews: Israel. The Good Neighbor policy and the Atlantic Charter are largely memories. The United Nations and Israel endure.

Winston Churchill, who made the phrase &quot;No comment&quot; famous, cited Welles as his source for the cryptic response.

Welles&#x27;s papers are held by the National Archives at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library in Hyde Park, New York.

The street adjacent to the current Embassy of the United States in Riga, Latvia, was named after Sumner Welles (as &quot;Samnera Velsa iela&quot;) in 2012.

<doc id="503407" wikidata="Q6942093" url="?curid=503407" title="Music of Georgia (U.S. state)">
<text>Georgia&#x27;s musical history is diverse and substantial; the state&#x27;s musicians include Southern rap groups such as Outkast and Goodie Mob, as well as a wide variety of rock, pop, blues, and country artists such as Ray Charles, Otis Redding, James Brown, The Allman Brothers Band, Ray Stevens, Bill Anderson, Thomas Rhett, Jason Aldean, Wet Willie, Chuck Leavell, Cole Swindell, Little Richard, Charles Kelley &amp; Dave Haywood (Lady A) &amp; Buddy Greene, Alan Jackson, Jennifer Nettles &amp; Kristian Bush (Sugarland) &amp; many others. 

The music of Athens, Georgia is especially well known for a kind of quirky college rock that has included such well-known bands as R.E.M., The B-52&#x27;s, and Pylon.

== Music institutions ==
The state&#x27;s official music museum is the Georgia Music Hall of Fame, located in Macon, Georgia from 1996 until it closed in 2011. Colleges such as the University of Georgia and Columbus State University have extensive music departments.

==Indigenous music==
== Folk music ==
Georgia&#x27;s folk musical traditions include important contributions to the Piedmont blues, shape note singing, and African-American music.

=== African American folk music ===
The &quot;ring shout&quot; is an African American musical and dance tradition that is among the oldest surviving African American performance styles in North America. The ring shout tradition is rare in the modern Southern United States, but it still found in McIntosh County, Georgia, where black communities have kept the style alive. The McIntosh County ring shout is a counterclockwise ring dance featuring clapping and stick-beating percussion with call-and-response vocals. The ring shout tradition is strongest in Boldon, Georgia (also known as &quot;Briar Patch&quot;), where it is traditionally performed on New Year&#x27;s Eve.

The Georgia Sea Island Singers are an important group in modern African American folk music in Georgia. They perform worldwide the Gullah/Geechee music of the Georgia coast and Sea Islands, and have been touring since the early 1900s; the folklorist and musicologist Alan Lomax discovered the Singers on a 1959-60 collecting trip and helped to bring their music to new audiences. The Georgia Sea Island Singers have included Bessie Jones, Emma Ramsey, John Davis, Mayble Hillery, and Peter Davis.

Fife and drum blues has been documented in west central Georgia.

The Freedom Singers are a group that formed in 1962 in Albany to educate communities about issues related to the Civil Rights Movement through song.

Multi-instrumentalist Abner Jay, born in Fitzgerald, performed eccentric blues-infused folk music as a one-man band.

=== Shape-note ===
The &quot;Sacred Harp&quot;, first published in 1844, was compiled and produced by Georgians Benjamin Franklin White and Elisha J. King. They helped establish a singing tradition also known as Sacred Harp, fasola, or shape note singing. The Sacred Harp system uses notes represented by different shapes according to scale degree, intended to make it easy for people to learn to sight-read music and perform complex pieces without a lot of training. Established in 1933, the Sacred Harp Publishing Company, located in Carrollton, Georgia, publishes the most widely used 1991 edition of &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot;. Hugh McGraw of Bremen, Georgia, served as the company&#x27;s executive secretary from 1958 to 2002 and helped encourage Sacred Harp&#x27;s recent resurgence in popularity. A Georgia-based music label, Bibletone Records, has reissued a 28-cut CD of Sacred Harp music originally released as LPs by the publishing company.

===American folk music revival===
Folksinger/songwriter Hedy West, active in the American folk music revival and famous for her song &quot;500 Miles&quot;, was born in Cartersville.

<text>Park Lane is a DART light rail station in northern Dallas, Texas. The elevated station is located at the intersection of Park Lane and Greenville Avenue, about east of North Central Expressway (US 75). The station serves the Red Line and Orange Line.

The station serves the southern portions of the Vickery Meadow neighborhood, as well as several shopping centers, most notably The Shops at Park Lane. NorthPark Center, which is located on the opposite side of US 75, is serviced by a shuttle bus.

== History ==
Plans for a station on Park Lane date back to 1990 as the northern terminus of a starter system. Two potential locations for the station were considered: one south of Park Lane near the NorthPark East office complex (since replaced by The Shops at Park Lane), and one north of Park Lane near a (now-closed) United Artists theater. After a 1990 study determined that the line may require grade separation when crossing Park Lane to prevent traffic congestion, DART ultimately chose to build a temporary ground-level platform at the NorthPark East location, which would not require crossing Park Lane until the line was extended further north.

The station opened on January 10, 1997, as the northern terminus of the Red Line. It, along with the Mockingbird and Lovers Lane stations, was originally intended to open 6 months prior, but all stations north of Downtown Dallas were delayed due to issues with a subway tunnel between the Mockingbird and Pearl stations.

Construction on the Red Line&#x27;s second northern extension, including a bridge over Park Lane and a permanent elevated station, began in April 1999. DART opted to build the new station on the northern side of the road. Local artists Vicki Meek and John Christensen decorated the station with an &quot;urban oasis&quot; theme. It opened to passenger service on June 17, 2002, two weeks before the extension to the Galatyn Park station opened, becoming the first elevated station on the DART light rail system.

The original station closed, but DART retains it as a private storage corridor. , the original station&#x27;s platform signage is still present.

<text>Lovers Lane station is a DART light rail station in Dallas, Texas. It serves the and . The station is located in East Dallas; it is directly east of North Central Expressway (US 75) and one block south of the intersection of Lovers Lane and Greenville Avenue.

The station services several strip malls along Greenville Avenue, the Energy Square and Meadows Building office complexes, and the residential complex The Village.

Unlike most DART stations, Lovers Lane station does not have a park-and-ride lot. , the station also does not receive bus service, though two bus routes can be accessed from Greenville Avenue one block east of the station entrance.

== History ==
Initial plans for the Lovers Lane station suggested either an at-grade or aerial station, both of which would have an 800-space parking lot and would be located south of an elevated crossing at Lovers Lane. Due to costs, DART chose to remove the parking lot from the plans, which nearly led to the station being rejected by the Dallas City Plan Commission.

As part of DART&#x27;s Station Art &amp; Design Program, DART installed tile mosaics depicting bois d&#x27;arc trees and ten windscreens featuring poems by local poet Robert Trammell. The station opened on January 10, 1997 alongside Mockingbird and Park Lane stations.

At opening, the station was the eastern terminus of a shuttle to Dallas Love Field. The route was eliminated in 2003 in favor of a connection to Downtown Dallas.

In 2008, the city of Dallas established a four-segment tax increment financing district around several DART rail stations. One of the sub-districts consists of land along Greenville Avenue between Lovers Lane and SMU/Mockingbird stations.

<text>SMU/Mockingbird station (originally Mockingbird station) is a DART light rail station in Dallas, Texas. The station is located at the intersection of Mockingbird Lane and North Central Expressway (US 75). The station serves the , , and . It is the northernmost station to serve all three lines: the Red and Orange Lines continue north towards Richardson and Plano, while the Blue Line continues northeast towards Garland and Rowlett.

The station is located east of the main campus of Southern Methodist University (SMU), which is on Mockingbird Lane on the opposite side of US 75. SMU operates a shuttle route between the station and the campus. The station also serves the University Crossing neighborhood of Dallas and the Park Cities (i.e., Highland Park and University Park). It directly connects to the University Crossing Trail, which in turn connects to the Katy Trail, Ridgewood Trail, and SoPac Trail.

Mockingbird Station is a mixed-use development adjacent to the station, which contains an open-air shopping district, an Angelika Film Center, apartments, and office space. 

== Station ==
SMU/Mockingbird is the only entrenched station in the DART light rail system, with the main platform located below ground level. The station is the northern end of a tunnel to Downtown Dallas.

The station&#x27;s upper level consists of a small plaza containing ticket machines, an elevator, and a pair of escalators. The west entrance to the plaza leads to the Mockingbird Station development and the University Crossing Trail, while the east entrance leads to buses, passenger drop-off/pick-up, bicycle parking, and vehicle parking. A stairwell to the rail platform is located at each end of the bus platform.

On the lower level is the rail platform, which is an island platform. Southbound and westbound trains board on the western side, while northbound and eastbound trains board on the eastern side. All three lines use the same platforms.

=== Artwork ===
The eastern entrance to the station contains six archways, each of which are decorated with colorful mosaic tiles and topped with a stained-glass mockingbird. The western retaining wall is decorated with a colorful ribbon pattern, while the eastern retaining wall is landscaped with shade-tolerant plants.

== History ==
Plans for a station at North Central and Mockingbird date back to DART&#x27;s 1983 rail plan. A revised plan in 1986 called for the Mockingbird Lane station to open in 1994 as the initial northern terminus for the North Central line. Later in the decade, DART obtained two rail corridors that intersected north of Mockingbird Lane, one from Southern Pacific (which became the Red Line) and the other from Union Pacific (which became the Blue Line).

A 1990 study of the Southern Pacific corridor determined two possible locations for the Mockingbird Lane station. One location would consist of two separate stations north of the Southern Pacific/Union Pacific junction, while the other would consist of a single station south of the junction. Both proposals included a 950-space parking lot. DART ultimately chose the southern site. The site was located near the former headquarters of Dr Pepper, which was demolished in 1997. A proposal was made to name and theme the station after Dr Pepper, but this was rejected.

Mockingbird station opened on January 10, 1997 as part of a Red Line extension from Pearl to Park Lane. The station did not receive Blue Line service until September 27, 1999, and said service was weekday-only until the opening of White Rock station on September 24, 2001.

In 2015, DART added two dedicated spaces for carsharing company Zipcar to the station&#x27;s passenger pick-up/drop-off zone. An additional space was added later in the year.

On November 4, 2017, a pedestrian bridge over Mockingbird Lane, which connected the station to the Katy Trail, was opened.

On August 12, 2019, DART renamed the station to SMU/Mockingbird station, with SMU paying DART $463,000 for a 10-year naming rights agreement.

==Development==

Several months after the DART station opened, developers Ken Hughes and Archon Group announced plans for Mockingbird Station, a transit-oriented development complex with a pedestrian connection to the DART station. The 10-acre, $100 million complex, built on top of a former Western Electric warehouse, opened on July 1, 2001.

The complex contains 211 apartments, of office space, and of retail and restaurant space. Notable retail tenants include Angelika Film Center, Bath &amp; Body Works, Loft, and Urban Outfitters. The property is currently owned by CBRE Group, which purchased the property in 2015.

A 2004 study of transit-oriented developments by the Transportation Research Board called Mockingbird Station &quot;a TOD success story,&quot; praising it for its location with &quot;strong local demographics, and an abundance of adjacent regional attractions,&quot; as well as for being driven by private developers.

<text>Cityplace/Uptown station (formerly Cityplace station) is a DART light rail station located in Dallas, Texas. The station is located on the , , and serves the Cityplace and Uptown districts. It also serves as a transfer point to the M-Line Trolley.

The station is located beneath North Central Expressway (US 75) at its intersection with Haskell Avenue, and it is located on a tunnel connecting Downtown Dallas to SMU/Mockingbird station. The station is the only underground station on the DART rail system, as well as the only active underground rail station in the state of Texas.

== Station ==
Cityplace/Uptown station is tri-level in design. At ground level, the station has entrances (dubbed &quot;portals&quot;) on both sides of North Central Expressway. Both portals have a corresponding bus stop located on the expressway&#x27;s frontage road. The West Portal, located in Uptown&#x27;s West Village, consists of a small headhouse and a railway turntable, which is used as a stop for the M-Line Trolley. The East Portal is located on the ground floor of Cityplace Tower. Both portals lead a central mezzanine containing an information desk and ticket vending machines. From there, another set of escalators lead to the southern end of the rail platforms.

Early plans for the station called for an additional set of entrances to the north of Haskell Avenue, which would connect to the northern end of the rail platforms.

In total, the station extends beneath ground level. The station contains two inclined elevators, six escalators, and 213 total steps. The station&#x27;s longest escalators are , which made them the longest escalators in the western U.S. at installation.

=== Artwork ===
The station contains an &quot;evolution-themed design&quot; based on geological strata, with each of the station&#x27;s three levels representing a different time period. The stations contains etchings of children&#x27;s drawings, depictions of Native American artifacts discovered during its excavation, and five Native American-styled murals. The walls of the rail platforms depict local fossils, artifacts from the nearby Freedman&#x27;s Cemetery, and the Texas Electric Railway system that previously connected Dallas to Denison.

== History ==
In late 1983, developer Southland Corporation announced plans for Cityplace, a mixed-use project, the centerpiece of which would be two office towers connected by a pedestrian bridge. As the project&#x27;s site was located along a proposed rail transit corridor, the developer proposed adding a passenger station on this corridor to the pedestrian bridge. In 1985, the Dallas City Council endorsed a revised plan that moved the rail corridor to an underground tunnel between Mockingbird Lane and downtown; the planned Cityplace station was moved underground to accommodate this change.

In 1988, Cityplace leadership offered to pay for up to $22 million of the station&#x27;s cost if it was located at Haskell Avenue near the north end of the development, but local residents proposed an alternate location on Lemmon Avenue that was closer to existing housing. At the same time, Cityplace was also attempting to rezone its land for denser development, which was also opposed by residents. An investigation by &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; found secret negotiations between DART, Cityplace, and the Dallas municipal government that would make the rezoning contingent on Cityplace paying for the station (as well as road and utility improvements), which was viewed as illegal contract zoning. After the investigation, DART ultimately settled on a compromise site between Haskell and Lemmon, which caused Cityplace to retract its payment offer.

In 1991, DART announced plans to begin excavating the underground tunnel that would contain Cityplace station. The excavation would be completed by 1993. However, it was also announced that the Cityplace station would not open until 1999 for financial reasons; completing the station after excavation would cost $13.7 million. In 1996, as part of a settlement with the city, Cityplace agreed to pay $3.5 million to finance the station, which the city would reimburse through a tax increment financing district. The station was opened on December 18, 2000.

In early 2001, the McKinney Avenue Transit Authority (MATA) received a $2.5 million grant to extend its heritage streetcar line to Cityplace station. The extension opened the following year. In 2011, MATA constructed a turntable at the entrance to Cityplace, and DART rebuilt the West Portal headhouse so that the entrance points to the turntable.

On July 30, 2012, the station was renamed to Cityplace/Uptown station to emphasize its connection to the Uptown neighborhood.

<text>Pearl Street/Arts District station (formerly Pearl station) is a DART light rail station located in Dallas, Texas. It is located on Bryan Street, east of Pearl Street, in the City Center District. It opened June 14, 1996, and is the easternmost station on the trunk line segment shared by the Red, Blue, Green and Orange Lines, serving the Plaza of the Americas, the Sheraton Dallas Hotel, 2001 Bryan Tower, the San Jacinto Tower, the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center and JPMorgan Chase Tower.

Pearl station was the original northern terminus of the Red and Blue lines before they were extended (Red in 1997 and Blue in 1999).

On July 30, 2012; Pearl was renamed Pearl/Arts District station as part of the service changes effective for that date to better reflect new identities created by their evolving neighborhoods or surrounding developments.

East of this station, the light rail&#x27;s transit mall ends and grade-separated tracks begin, with the Red, Orange and Blue lines branching north at a wye and descending into a tunnel under the expressway, while the Green Line branches southeast.

It opened on June 14, 1996, and is a station on the , , and lines, serving the Trammell Crow Center, the Dallas Museum of Art, the Nasher Sculpture Center, Patriot Tower and First Baptist Church.

St. Paul station takes its name from its namesake street, which received its name in the 1930s, not out of religious interest, but as a protest against the Volstead Act, a national law that banned alcoholic beverages. The city fathers located a passage in the Bible, attributed to St. Paul, that said &quot;drink a little wine, for your stomach&#x27;s sake&quot;.

<text>External Machine Interface (EMI), an extension to Universal Computer Protocol (UCP), is a protocol primarily used to connect to short message service centres (SMSCs) for mobile telephones. The protocol was developed by CMG Wireless Data Solutions, now part of Mavenir.

==Syntax==

A typical EMI/UCP exchange looks like this :

 ^B01/00045/O/30/66677789///1//////68656C6C6F/CE^C
 ^B01/00041/R/30/A//66677789:180594141236/F3^C

The start of the packet is signaled by ^B (STX, hex 02) and the end with ^C (ETX, hex 03). Fields within the packet are separated by / characters.

The first four fields form the mandatory header. the third is the &quot;operation type&quot; (O for operation, R for result), and the fourth is the &quot;operation&quot; (here 30, &quot;short message transfer&quot;).

The subsequent fields are dependent on the operation. In the first line above, &#x27;66677789&#x27; is the recipient&#x27;s address (telephone number) and &#x27;68656C6C6F&#x27; is the content of the message, in this case the ASCII string &quot;hello&quot;. The second line is the response with a matching transaction reference number, where &#x27;A&#x27; indicates that the message was successfully acknowledged by the SMSC, and a timestamp is suffixed to the phone number to show time of delivery.

The final field is the checksum, calculated simply by summing all bytes in the packet (including slashes) and taking the 8 least significant bits from the result.

The full specification is available on the LogicaCMG website developers&#x27; forum, but registration is required.

== Technical limitations ==

The two-digit &quot;transaction reference number&quot; means that an entity sending text messages can only have 100 outstanding messages (per session); this can limit performance, but only over a slow network and with incorrectly configured applications on one&#x27;s SMSC (for example one session, with number of windows greater than 100). In practice it does not have any impact on delivery throughput.

The EMI UCP documentation does not specify a default alphabet for alphanumeric messages after decoding from hex digits. (It specifies an alphabet of IRA for the &quot;encoded&quot; message, which is the same as 7 bit ASCII as 0-9 and A-Z are invariant characters). The related ETS 300 133-3 standard specifies the GSM-7 alphabet, which accommodates more languages than ASCII by replacing unprintable control codes with additional printable characters. In practice the GSM-7 alphabet is used. Other encodings, such as UCS-2, can be sent by using a transparent message and specifying the Data Coding Scheme.

<text>West End station is a DART light rail station in Dallas, Texas. It is located in the West End Historic District of Downtown Dallas on Pacific Avenue, between Market and Lamar Streets near CBD West Transfer Center. It opened on June 14, 1996, and is a station on the , , , and lines, serving the West End Marketplace, Dallas Alley, the Dallas World Aquarium and Zoo, the Sixth Floor Museum (in the Texas School Book Depository), Dealey Plaza, the Old Red Courthouse with its Dallas Visitors Center and El Centro College and is within walking distance of the American Airlines Center and the rest of Victory Park.

This is the westernmost stop on the four-stop trunk segment shared by all four lines. West of here, approaching the TRE tracks, the Orange and Green Lines branch north and the Red and Blue Lines branch south.

Following the shooting of Dallas police officers on July 7, 2016, the station was closed during the investigation of the nearby crime scene. Trains were stopping at all transit mall stations except West End, which they passed through during the incident. News outlets reported that ridership was lower than normal just after the attacks at nearby stations such as Akard, St. Paul, and Pearl/Arts District, typically busy stations during the morning rush hour.

<text>Dallas Union Station, officially Eddie Bernice Johnson Union Station (or simply EBJ Union Station), also known as Dallas Union Terminal, is a large intermodal railroad station in Dallas, Texas. It is the third busiest Amtrak station in Texas, behind Fort Worth Central Station and San Antonio station. It serves DART light rail Blue and Red lines, commuter rail and Amtrak inter-city rail. It is located on Houston Street, between Wood and Young Streets, in the Reunion district of Downtown Dallas. The structure is a Dallas Landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Services==
The station is served by Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Texas Eagle&quot; with Chicago as the eastern terminus and either San Antonio or Los Angeles as the western terminus and later by proposed Crescent (train). The light rail station serves as a stop on the and lines as well as the . Union Station is the northern terminus of the Dallas Streetcar and provides access to the Greyhound bus terminal, the George Allen Courts Building, Dealey Plaza, the Hyatt Regency Dallas at Reunion and Reunion Tower.

The first floor is occupied by an Amtrak ticketing window, a waiting room, and privately rented offices. The second floor contains the restored Grand Hall and several meeting rooms named after railroads that previously serviced Dallas. The second floor and a mezzanine are operated by Wolfgang Puck Catering.

==History==
The Union Terminal Company constructed the Dallas Union Terminal, as Union Station was originally called, in 1916 to consolidate five rail stations scattered around Dallas into one, making Dallas a major transportation center in the Southern United States. At the peak of its usage, as many as 80 trains stopped each day at the station. It was designed by Jarvis Hunt, who designed other large train stations. Railroads served by the station included Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (&#x27;Santa Fe&#x27;), St. Louis Southwestern Railway (&#x27;Cotton Belt&#x27;), Fort Worth &amp; Denver Railway, Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad (&#x27;Rock Island&#x27;), Burlington-Rock Island Railroad, St. Louis and San Francisco Railway (&#x27;Frisco&#x27;), Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad (&#x27;Katy&#x27;), Southern Pacific Railroad and Texas &amp; Pacific Railway.

In 1954, the building served as a temporary library while the Dallas Public Library system built a new central library to replace the original Carnegie Library.

Originally, the 2nd level waiting room was connected to train platforms via an overhead walkway, but this design was never popular with travelers as they needed to climb a large number of stairs. Escalators were added, but the Grand Hall was finally abandoned in favor of renovated ticketing and a waiting room on the ground floor (still in use today). Also, an underground corridor replaced the overhead walkway, with ramps at each platform. Despite Dallas&#x27; status as the second most populous city of the state at the time, the Dallas Union Station was eclipsed in some regard by Fort Worth Union Station. For example, the Rock Island Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Twin Star Rocket&quot; from Minneapolis terminated at Fort Worth, not at Dallas. The Santa Fe Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Texas Chief&quot; from Chicago also took its route through Fort Worth, en route to Houston.

The last passenger train to serve Union Station before the inauguration of Amtrak, the Missouri Pacific Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Texas Eagle,&quot; left on May 31, 1969. When it began in the spring of 1971, Amtrak initially consolidated most of its Metroplex service at Fort Worth, but planned to introduce service to Dallas once improvements were made at Union Terminal, which it considered outdated. With those improvements, Amtrak service began on March 14, 1974, with the &quot;Inter-American&quot; between St. Louis and Laredo; the train evolved into today&#x27;s &quot;Texas Eagle.&quot; From 1975 to 1981, the station was also served by the &quot;Lone Star,&quot; a descendant of an old Santa Fe mainstay, the &quot;Texas Chief.&quot;

DART&#x27;s light-rail service began at the station on June 14, 1996. The station&#x27;s upper-level waiting room was repurposed into meeting and convention space for the Hyatt Regency Dallas, which is connected via an underground walkway.

In October 2016, the Dallas City Council renamed the station to Eddie Bernice Johnson Union Station in honor of U.S. Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson. In April 2019, DART approved the new name and held a dedication ceremony. It is mostly referred to as EBJ Union Station.

==Murals==
In 1934, as part of the federally sponsored Public Works of Art Project, Jerry Bywaters and Alexander Hogue were granted the first commission in Texas to create a series of 10 murals depicting events in Dallas history. They had painted them on the walls of the second-floor lobby at the old Dallas City Hall Building, located on Harwood Street between Main and Commerce Streets. In 1954, the original murals were destroyed when City Hall relocated. When the station was renovated to accommodate light rail usage, the murals were partially recreated by Phillip Lamb along the train platforms at Union Station.

<doc id="503449" wikidata="Q1193928" url="?curid=503449" title="Indian Pacific">
<text>The Indian Pacific is a weekly experiential tourism-oriented passenger train service that runs in Australia&#x27;s east–west rail corridor between Sydney, on the shore of the Pacific Ocean, and Perth, on the shore of the Indian Ocean – thus, like its counterpart in the north–south corridor, &quot;The Ghan&quot;, one of the few truly transcontinental trains in the world. It first ran in 1970 after the completion of gauge conversion projects in South Australia and Western Australia, enabling for the first time a cross-continental rail journey that did not have a break of gauge.

The train has been rated as one of the great rail journeys of the world. Its route includes the world&#x27;s longest straight stretch of railway track, a stretch of the Trans-Australian Railway across the Nullarbor Plain.

The service was originally operated jointly by four government railway administrations: the Department of Railways New South Wales, South Australian Railways, Commonwealth Railways and Western Australian Government Railways, until February 1993 when Australian National took full ownership. In 1997, the &quot;Indian Pacific&quot; was sold to Great Southern Rail and, subsequently, branded as Journey Beyond Rail Expeditions then Journey Beyond during several changes in corporate ownership.

A one-way trip takes between 70.5 and 75 hours, depending on scheduling and daylight saving periods. , two levels of service were offered, branded as Platinum and Gold. A motorail service conveys passengers&#x27; motor vehicles on the train between Adelaide and Perth.

==History==
With the remaining narrow gauge parts of the East-west rail corridor being gauge converted to standard gauge in 1966, the Department of Railways New South Wales, South Australian Railways, Commonwealth Railways and Western Australian Government Railways agreed that a through passenger service from Sydney Central to East Perth Terminal be inaugurated. Originally to be named &quot;The Transcontinental&quot;, in 1969, the &quot;Indian Pacific&quot; name was adopted by a joint meeting of transport ministers.

The service was originally operated jointly by the four operators whose networks it traversed, with revenues and costs apportioned Department of Railways New South Wales (28.5%), South Australian Railways (10%), Commonwealth Railways (45%) and Western Australian Government Railways (16.5%).

The first &quot;Indian Pacific&quot; service left Sydney on 23 February 1970, becoming the first direct train to cross the Australian continent, made possible by the completion of the east-west standard gauge project a few months earlier. At the time it was the third longest passenger train in terms of distance after services on the Trans-Siberian Railway and the Canadian.

Locomotives and crews were provided by the Department of Railways New South Wales between Sydney and Broken Hill, South Australian Railways between Broken Hill and Port Pirie, the Commonwealth Railways between Port Pirie and Kalgoorlie and Western Australian Government Railways between Kalgoorlie and Perth. With the formation of Australian National in July 1975, it provided locomotives and crews from Broken Hill to Kalgoorlie. Locomotives were changed at Lithgow, Broken Hill, Port Pirie and Kalgoorlie.

On-board crews were originally provided between Sydney and Port Pirie by Commonwealth Railways on one service and New South Wales Government Railways on the other services, Commonwealth Railways between Port Pirie and Kalgoorlie and West Australian Government Railways between Kalgoorlie and Perth.

The train originally operated twice per week. In times of heavy demand, a double consist would operate. It would operate in New South Wales as two trains before being combined at Broken Hill.

In July 1973, a third service was introduced followed in July 1975 by a fourth, these later two being extensions of existing &quot;Trans-Australian&quot; services. In October 1976, a motorail service was introduced between Port Pirie and Perth. Originally vehicles were loaded in Perth at the Kewdale Freight Terminal before a car loading ramp was built at East Perth station.

The service was suspended from 2 December 1982 to 25 April 1983 due to an industrial dispute over staffing levels in South Australia. When it resumed, the service was reduced to three times weekly with the second class sleepers replaced by sitting carriages.

From August 1986, the train commenced operating via Adelaide. In October 1988 the motorail service was extended through to Sydney.

In June 1991, the service was cut from three times a week to two. This was reduced to weekly in January 1992 between Sydney and Adelaide with two services a week between Adelaide and Perth.

In February 1993, Australian National took over operation of the service throughout after agreement was reached with the State Rail Authority and Westrail in 1992. A second service resumed in August 1993.

From January 1994, the service was operated throughout by Australian National CL class locomotives.

As part of the privatisation of Australian National, the Indian Pacific, along with &quot;The Ghan&quot; and &quot;The Overland&quot;, was sold to Great Southern Rail (now known as Journey Beyond Rail Expeditions) in October 1997. Motive power provision was contracted to National Rail. As from 2016, the &quot;Indian Pacific&quot; operates weekly. A second service operated between September and November until 2015.

==Route==
The route leaves Sydney and travels via the Western and Broken Hill lines to Broken Hill. It then crosses into South Australia on the Broken Hill to Crystal Brook line before heading south to Adelaide. Before the conversion of the Crystal Brook to Adelaide line to standard gauge, passengers for Adelaide had to change at Port Pirie. However, from August 1986, the Indian Pacific was diverted to make an out-and-back trip to Adelaide adding to the journey. From Crystal Brook, it heads north to Port Augusta and then via the Trans-Australian Railway to Kalgoorlie including travelling over the world&#x27;s longest straight stretch of railway track on the Nullarbor Plain measuring . It then heads via the Eastern Goldfields and Eastern lines to its terminus at East Perth.

The highest point on the line is at Bell, NSW in the Blue Mountains, at 1100 metres.

The most northern point on the line is at the western tip of the Yellabinna Regional Park, South Australia.

The most southern point on the line is at the Adelaide Parklands Terminal in Keswick, South Australia.

Occasionally, when there is trackwork, the &quot;Indian Pacific&quot; is diverted out of Sydney via the Main South line to Cootamundra and cross-country line to rejoin the Broken Hill line at Parkes. It has previously operated via the Temora to Roto line and via Melbourne.

In 1970, the journey took 75 hours. With subsequent infrastructure improvements and reductions to the time needed to change locomotives and crew, by 2010 the journey took 65 hours despite the longer distance.

==Rolling stock==

For the commencement of operations, 59 stainless steel carriages, power vans and luggage vans were built by Commonwealth Engineering, Granville to the same design as already in use on the &quot;Trans-Australian&quot;. These operated in consists of 12 carriages. A further 16 were ordered in 1971.

, the weekly service consists of up to 25 carriages and two motorail wagons. Because of its length, the train is split in two when stabled at Sydney Central station.
Originally, each of the operators hauled the train over their network with locomotives changed at Broken Hill, Port Pirie and Kalgoorlie. A further change occurred at Lithgow from electric to diesel power. Due to Westrail suffering a motive power shortage, Australian National locomotives hauled the service in Western Australia from October 1973 until March 1977.

From January 1994, the service was operated throughout by Australian National CL class locomotives. Since November 1997, it has been hauled by Pacific National NR class locomotives. Seven NR class, (NR18, NR25-NR29, NR86) have been repainted in differing &quot;Indian Pacific&quot; liveries.

The lead locomotive is assisted by an 81, G or second NR class between Sydney and Adelaide. In 2014, NR25-NR28 were repainted in a new livery that is much closer to that of Pacific National. In 2018, NR29 and NR86 had &quot;Indian Pacific&quot; signwriting applied their existing liveries.

==Passenger facilities==
The train originally offered just 52 first-class sleeping berths and 96 second-class sleeping berths. However, the train was limited to 144 passengers, as this was the number that could be serviced by three sittings in the 48-seat dining car.

From 1973, the accommodation was altered to provide 88 first-class sleeping berths and 64 second-class. The club-cafeteria car also provided a small number of second-class seats for short-distance travelers on the Commonwealth Railways segment.

From 1975, Australian National provided full sitting carriages west of Port Pirie on two journeys per week. The Department of Railways New South Wales initially resisted providing sitting accommodation over the whole journey, but Public Transport Commission HUB/RUB sitting carriages were included between Sydney and Port Pirie from 1974, with Australian National providing sitting carriages from Broken Hill to Peterborough for an onward connection to Adelaide. By 1979, the Public Transport Commission carriages were operating from Sydney to Peterborough. In 1981, this was extended to Port Pirie.

Sitting carriages provided by Australian National with Commonwealth Railways carbon steel carriage stock became part of the full through service from Sydney to Perth in 1988.

The train formerly had four classes, branded as Platinum, Gold Service, Red Service Sleeper and Red Service Daynighter. The Platinum Service was introduced in 2008 as a premium class of travel. The Gold Service, the former first-class service, features either roomette or twinette sleeper cabins, with complimentary meals in the restaurant car.

Red Service, the equivalent of economy class, featured both dual-berth shared sleeper cabins and airline-style &#x27;sit-up&#x27; seats similar to other Australian trains. It also had its own restaurant car. Red Service was withdrawn in July 2016 after a Federal Government subsidy was withdrawn making the Red Service no longer financially viable.

The train also has a motorail service to carry passengers&#x27; motor vehicles. This facility was available throughout the journey until November 2015, when it was reduced to only operate between Adelaide and Perth.

==Special trains==
A full &quot;Indian Pacific&quot; set made promotional trips to Canberra and Newcastle for travel agents prior to its launch in February 1970.

Further trips were made to Canberra in 1981 and 1985, and to Newcastle in 1975, 1976, 1977 and 1979.

Following the conversion of the Adelaide to Melbourne railway line to standard gauge in 1995, the &quot;Indian Pacific&quot; made a promotional trip from Perth to Brisbane via Melbourne over 6 days in June of that year.

==Christmas train==
For more than a decade, the &quot;Indian Pacific&quot; operated a Christmas train with a noted musical artist on board, stopping at locations including the remote Nullarbor Plain sidings of Watson, Cook, and Rawlinna. Some of the performers were Nikki Webster (2000), John Williamson (2001), Marcia Hines (2002), John Paul Young (2003), Jimmy Barnes (2004), Guy Sebastian (2005), Human Nature (2006), David Campbell (2007), Brian McFadden (2012) and Rikki-Lee Coulter (2013).

==Media depictions==
In 1980, the &quot;Indian Pacific&quot; featured in an episode of BBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Great Railway Journeys of the World&quot; series, presented by Michael Frayn. In 2019 it was also the subject of an SBS &quot;slow television&quot; documentary: the entire journey from Perth to Sydney was condensed into a three-hour show with no voiceover, much of it comprising footage directly from the front or sides of the train. The &quot;Indian Pacific&quot; also featured in &quot;Great Australian Railway Journeys&quot;, presented by Michael Portillo, first broadcast in November 2019. Also in 2019, the train was featured in an episode of Discovery Channel Canada&#x27;s &quot;Mighty Trains&quot;.

==Incidents==
*18 February 1970: On a test run from Port Pirie, an &quot;Indian Pacific&quot; set struck a derailed freight train near Locksley ripping the sides out of several carriages.
*24 December 1975: 13 of the 25 carriages on the eastbound train derailed due to a collapsed bogie on the leading carriage, east of the remote Nullarbor Plain siding of Rawlinna. Three of the 200 passengers were injured; they were flown from Forrest to Adelaide.
*24 January 1978: The westbound train derailed near Forbes as a result of wet weather washing away part of the track. The train had been diverted south through Forbes, because of washaways between Parkes and Broken Hill. Three of the 153 passengers were taken to Forbes District Hospital.
*18 August 1999: Zanthus train collision – the westbound train was accidentally directed into a crossing loop occupied by an eastbound train at Zanthus.
*3 December 1999: Glenbrook train disaster – a CityRail Intercity train ran into the back of the eastbound train at Glenbrook in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney. Seven people died, all on the CityRail train.
*26 November 2017: At 10:12 am, just 600 metres after departing from East Perth station, the &quot;Indian Pacific&quot;, heading for Sydney, derailed. &quot;The second carriage jumped the tracks, grinding the train-ride to a halt&quot;.

<text>Tyler/Vernon station is a DART light rail station in Oak Cliff, Dallas, Texas. Located just southwest of the intersection of Tyler Street and Lebanon Avenue, the station opened on June 14, 1996 and lies on the .

The station serves nearby residential and commercial areas, including Elmwood, Polk Vernon, Ruthmeade Place, and Tyler Station, an adaptive reuse project located in the adjacent former Dixie Wax Cup factory.

Originally there was no DART parking lot at this station (making it one of the few stations with no parking facilities) but a small pay parking lot, nestled between houses in the mainly residential area, was adjacent to the station. However, this small lot is now part of the station facility and no longer charges for parking.

<text>Downtown Garland station (previously North Garland Transit Center and Garland Central Transit Center) is a DART light rail station located in Garland, Texas. The station is located at the intersection of Fifth Street and Walnut Street in Garland&#x27;s historic downtown district, two blocks north of the town square.

The station serves the . The station is also a major bus transfer facility for the city, with bus routes connecting to the South Garland and Lake Ray Hubbard transit centers.

== History ==

=== North Garland Transit Center/Garland Central Transit Center ===
In 1975, the city of Garland announced plans for an express bus service between Garland and Downtown Dallas, which would be operated by the Dallas Transit System. As part of the service, the city built a 312-space park-and-ride lot in downtown Garland at the corner of Fifth and Walnut, which opened on November 3, 1975.

The Dallas Transit System was superseded by Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) in 1985, which named the lot the North Garland Transit Center. In 1988, DART offered the city $355,609 to purchase the transit center.

In 1993, DART built a new station building, expanded the parking lot to 530 spaces, and renamed the facility to Garland Central Transit Center.

=== Downtown Garland ===
In 1999, DART started construction on a northern extension of the Blue Line, which at the time ended at Mockingbird station. Garland Central Transit Center, which was located near the Missouri–Kansas–Texas right-of-way used for the project, would be the northernmost station on the extension and would open in 2002.

Construction on Garland Central&#x27;s rail platforms began in 2000. In anticipation of the extension, the city of Garland renovated two performing arts venues in its downtown area.

On November 18, 2002, the Blue Line extension to Garland Central Transit Center was completed, and the station was renamed to Downtown Garland. The station made Garland the second suburb with DART Light Rail service (after Richardson) and the first to have a station in its downtown area. The station served as the northern terminus of the Blue Line until 2012, when the line was extended to Downtown Rowlett.

In 2005, Garland mayor Bob Day proposed moving the station one block west to Sixth Street. The proposal would bring the station closer to downtown retailers, and it would also allow for the creation of a bridge over a Kansas City Southern corridor, which was necessary to expand the line to Rowlett. DART eventually determined a bridge design that would not require moving the station.

==== Proposed Amtrak connection ====
In 2001, Amtrak announced plans for the &quot;Crescent Star&quot;, a daily passenger train between Fort Worth and New York City. The route would pass through Garland using the MKT corridor used by the Blue Line. The city of Garland proposed an Amtrak station at the corner of First and Walnut, approximately east of the DART station, to allow for transfer between the two services.

The &quot;Crescent Star&quot; was originally planned to start service in 2001, but it was delayed due to funding issues. The proposal would remain dormant until 2023, when Amtrak applied for a newer grant. It is unclear if the Amtrak station in Garland is still being considered.

Born into a musical family and raised in Johannesburg, Rabin took up the piano and guitar at an early age and became a session musician, playing and producing with a variety of artists. In 1972, he joined the rock band Rabbitt, which enjoyed considerable success in South Africa, and released his first solo album, &quot;Beginnings&quot;. In 1978, Rabin moved to London to further his career, working as a solo artist and a producer for various artists including Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band.

After moving to Los Angeles in 1981, Rabin gained prominence as the guitarist in the progressive rock band Yes from 1983 to 1995. His first album with the group, 1983&#x27;s &quot;90125&quot;, which was developed mostly from his own demos, remains their best-selling album, helped by the US number one single &quot;Owner of a Lonely Heart&quot;. After &quot;Big Generator&quot; (1987) and &quot;Union&quot; (1991), Rabin produced &quot;Talk&quot; (1994) and left the group after its tour. During his time in Yes, Rabin acquired American citizenship.

Rabin became a prolific film composer and has since scored over forty feature films, most notably his frequent collaborations with producer Jerry Bruckheimer. He has won numerous awards, including eleven BMI Awards. He took a short break from scoring to record his fifth solo album, &quot;Jacaranda&quot; (2012), and in 2016 to tour and record with Yes Featuring Jon Anderson, Trevor Rabin, Rick Wakeman. In 2017, Rabin was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Yes. Rabin is also behind the theme song for the &quot;NBA on TNT&quot; and MLB on TBS.

== Early life ==
Rabin was born on 13 January 1954 in Johannesburg, South Africa, into a family of musicians. His mother, Joy, was a painter, ballet dancer, actress, and classical pianist, and his father, Godfrey, was a lawyer, musician, conductor, and the lead violinist in the Johannesburg Philharmonic Orchestra. The two met during their service in the South African army entertainment division. His paternal great-grandfather was a Lithuanian Jew who was a cantor, and his grandfather, Gershon Rabinowitz, was a kosher butcher who arrived in South Africa in the late nineteenth century. His uncle Morrie Rabin was a piano teacher. Rabin&#x27;s brother Derek is three years his elder. Rabin described his family as &quot;extremely anti-apartheid&quot;. Rabin&#x27;s mother converted to Judaism, and the family observed Jewish holidays and celebrations. Lawyer and judge Sydney Kentridge, and journalist and activist Donald Woods are his uncles.

Rabin attended Parktown Boys&#x27; High School in Johannesburg and took up the piano at age six. He recalled, &quot;Pushed by my parents, I had two lessons a week and practised an hour a day for twelve years, whether I liked it or not, as did my brother and sister.&quot; At twelve, he started to teach himself the guitar using piano exercise books and never had a formal lesson in the instrument. A year later he played in The Other before forming Conglomeration, and later joining Freedom&#x27;s Children for a one-year stint until 1973. He wrote their song &quot;State of Fear&quot; and toured the country extensively with a same-titled tour. For several months Rabin studied arrangement, orchestration, and conducting from Walter Mony, a professor at the University of Johannesburg in preparation to be a conductor, but he decided to pursue a career in rock music.

At sixteen, Rabin was discovered by a local record producer and became a session musician, playing a variety of styles including jazz, fusion, country, classical, conga, and kwela. He cites Arnold Schoenberg, Tchaikovsky, Hank Marvin, Cliff Richard and the Shadows, The Beatles and Jimi Hendrix as early influences. At nineteen, Rabin took a mandatory year of military conscription in the South African Army by serving in its entertainment division, arranging its big band, performing in a rock group, and did outside session work at Gallo Record Company. He said, &quot;I used to go into what was called the garrison. I would just go there, find a little corner and literally sit for hours practising the guitar ... although I would always play the piano.&quot; In 1972, Rabin bought a Fender Stratocaster.

== Career ==
=== 1972–1978: Rabbitt and solo projects ===
In 1972, Rabin reunited with his bandmates in Conglomeration to form the rock band Rabbitt with drummer Neil Cloud, bassist Ronnie Robot, and singer, keyboardist, and guitarist Duncan Faure. Their first single, released in 1972, was a cover of &quot;Locomotive Breath&quot; by Jethro Tull. A re-recorded version of the track appeared on their debut album, &quot;Boys Will Be Boys&quot;, released in 1975 on Jo&#x27;Burg Records. Rabin won an award for his orchestral arrangements on the album in 1975. The band won a SARI (South African Recording Industry) Award for Best Contemporary Music Artist in 1976.

Rabbitt&#x27;s second album, &quot;A Croak and a Grunt in the Night&quot;, was released in 1977. Later that year Rabin received a SARI Award for his production work on the album and Rabbitt received their second award for Best Contemporary Music Artist. Rabin also produced and arranged Margaret Singana&#x27;s album &quot;Where is the Love&quot; (1976). His career as a session musician included his two albums released under the pseudonym Trevor Terblanche, organised by producer Rob Schroder and released on a budget record label. Rabin also produced various disco-oriented projects including The Tee Cee&#x27;s, Slang, and Disco Rock Machine.

In 1977, Rabin recorded and released his first solo album, &quot;Beginnings&quot;, for RPM Records. It was recorded in approximately six and a half weeks in Johannesburg. He recalled: &quot;I don&#x27;t think I ever left the studio at that time. I virtually lived and worked there around the clock&quot;. Rabin played all instruments except the drums, for which he used session player Kevin Kruger. Also in 1977 Rabbitt agreed to a distribution deal with the US label Capricorn Records, but they were unable to tour abroad due to the international disapproval of South Africa&#x27;s apartheid policies and restrictions on South Africans obtaining visas. The situation became a catalyst for Rabin to leave the country. He had scored his first feature film by this time, the 1978 blaxploitation film &quot;Death of a Snowman&quot; (later rereleased as &quot;Soul Patrol&quot;). Rabin recalled: &quot;We stuck a sheet up on the wall and I wrote the score ... I still haven&#x27;t watched it&quot;.

=== 1978–1982: London and Los Angeles ===
In January 1978, Rabin arrived in London to continue his solo career. He was encouraged to move by music entrepreneur Ivor Schlosberg, who hired Rabin to kick start the English branch of his production company, Blue Chip Music, and become its first producer. By July, Rabin had struck a recording deal with Chrysalis Records which, in September 1978, reissued his debut solo album under the name &quot;Trevor Rabin&quot;. The album was remixed at Wessex Sound Studios in London and released with some new tracks and in a different track order. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine gave a positive review: &quot;An impressive outing marked by a rock style that invites comparisons to Boston at times or a Tom Petty&quot; with &quot;explosive&quot; keyboards and guitars. Later in 1978, Rabin produced, performed on, and arranged Noel McCalla&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Night Time Emotion&quot; (1979).

In 1979, Rabin released his second solo album, &quot;Face to Face&quot;. He promoted the album with a UK tour as an opening act for guitarist Steve Hillage. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; criticised the record for its hook-ridden ballads but still gave his first two albums good ratings for their technical qualities. In the same year, he co-produced &quot;Wild Horses&quot;, the debut album by Wild Horses. In 1980, Rabin played the guitar and co-produced &quot;Chance&quot; by Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band with Manfred Mann.

&quot;Wolf&quot;, Rabin&#x27;s third solo album for Chrysalis, released in 1980, was co-produced with Ray Davies. Recorded at Konk Studios in London, Rabin provided lead vocals, guitars, and keyboards while using various musicians to contribute, including drummer Simon Phillips, bassists Jack Bruce and Mo Foster, keyboardists Mann and John Bundrick, and Chris Thompson and Noel McCalla on additional vocals. Following its release, Rabin severed ties with Chrysalis as he felt the label did little to promote the album. During this time, Rabin played guitars on &quot;Runner&quot; and a rendition of &quot;Redemption Song&quot; by Bob Marley for Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band&#x27;s album &quot;Somewhere in Afrika&quot; (1983).

In 1981, Rabin moved to Los Angeles upon the encouragement from Geffen Records A&amp;R man John Kalodner, and began to develop material for a fourth solo album for the label with drummer Frankie Banali and bassist Mark Andes. During this time, David Geffen also put him in contact with musicians that went on to form the supergroup Asia. Rabin attended an early rehearsal, but felt his songs were not suitable for the group which led to the label dropping him. This proposed rock supergroup with Rabin, singer and bassist John Wetton, drummer Carl Palmer, and keyboardist Rick Wakeman never came to fruition.

Rabin then sent a tape of his new songs to various labels, including Clive Davis at Arista Records who praised his vocals but deemed his songs unsuitable for the Top 40 format. RCA Records executive Ron Fair was, according to Rabin, &quot;the first one to really hear that I had something interesting&quot;, and talks began regarding a new group of Rabin, Bruce, and keyboardist Keith Emerson. The group fell through, yet Fair offered Rabin a solo deal which was declined after Rabin decided to work with bassist Chris Squire and drummer Alan White, formerly of the progressive rock band Yes after his demos were discovered by producer Mutt Lange and Phil Carson of Atlantic Records.

=== 1982–1995: Yes and &quot;Can&#x27;t Look Away&quot; ===

In late 1982, Rabin, Squire and White formed Cinema which included original Yes keyboardist Tony Kaye, and recorded &quot;90125&quot; with former Yes singer Trevor Horn as producer. Based mostly on Rabin&#x27;s demos, the album displayed a more commercial direction, much different than their progressive rock-themed albums in the 1970s. During the mixing stages in mid-1983, former Yes singer Jon Anderson returned to sing on the album which led to the group becoming a reformed line-up of Yes. Rabin was uncomfortable with the decision, feeling the new music did not represent what the band became popular for and wished for the album to be judged as its own.

Released in 1983, &quot;90125&quot; remains the band&#x27;s highest selling album with three million copies sold in the US alone, helped by its lead single &quot;Owner of a Lonely Heart&quot;, one of Rabin&#x27;s songs, which reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles and Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks charts. When it reached number one, Rabin sent a letter to Davis and wrote, &quot;I guess you were wrong&quot;. Yes toured the album in 1984 and 1985, performing over 100 concerts worldwide which included two headline spots at the inaugural Rock in Rio festival. The tour was delayed to start after a woman hit Rabin&#x27;s midsection when she jumped into a swimming pool. This collision ruptured the Yes guitarist&#x27;s spleen and required emergency surgery. Rabin is featured on the concert film &quot;9012Live&quot;, released in cinemas to coincide with the live LP &quot;9012Live: The Solos&quot;. The latter features Rabin&#x27;s acoustic guitar solo, &quot;Solly&#x27;s Beard&quot;.

&quot;Big Generator&quot; was a laborious album to make. It was released in September 1987, with singles &quot;Love Will Find a Way&quot; and &quot;Rhythm of Love&quot;. Both were modest chart hits compared to the singles from &quot;90125&quot;, though the album was certified Platinum. The song &quot;Shoot High Aim Low&quot; featured a dual lead vocal between Rabin and Anderson. The 1987–88 &quot;Big Generator&quot; tour featured the hits, but other album tracks, such as &quot;Final Eyes&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Running,&quot; were dropped because as Rabin later said, they never quite happened live. Several tour dates were cancelled after Rabin suffered from the flu. The tour ended on 14 May 1988 with a performance at Madison Square Garden as part of the Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary concert. During the album&#x27;s production Rabin was asked by Bob Dylan to play the guitar on two songs.

Later in 1988, Anderson left Yes to form Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe (ABWH) and the band entered a period of inactivity. Rabin used the time to make his fourth solo album, &quot;Can&#x27;t Look Away&quot;. Released in July 1989 by Elektra Records, the album peaked at No. 111 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Its lead single, &quot;Something to Hold on To&quot;, peaked at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock chart and received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Short Form Music Video. In 1989 and 1990, Rabin completed a solo tour of the US with drummer Lou Molino III, bassist Jim Simmons, and keyboardist Mark Mancina. Recordings from the tour were used on the live album &quot;Live in LA&quot; released in 2003, featuring songs from &quot;Wolf&quot;, &quot;90125&quot;, and &quot;Big Generator&quot;. In addition to his solo work, Rabin worked on new music with Supertramp singer Roger Hodgson who was asked to replace Anderson as Yes&#x27;s singer.

From 1990 to 1992, Rabin was a part of an eight-member formation of Yes. Anderson had asked him to submit a song that he would allow ABWH to record on their second album; Rabin said &quot;What I read into that was they needed a single&quot;, and sent three demos. Despite requesting only one be used, Anderson wished to use all three which prompted discussions among the two group&#x27;s management over the idea of Yes and ABWH working on a single album, &quot;Union&quot;. Rabin thought a merge &quot;was useful and convenient to everyone&quot; as it was a quick way to get the band back on the road touring, and completed &quot;Lift Me Up&quot;, &quot;Miracle of Life&quot;, and &quot;Saving My Heart&quot;. The tour featured the eight members playing on stage; though it did little to improve relations between Howe and himself, Rabin began a good relationship with Rick Wakeman.

Rabin&#x27;s final album with Yes was &quot;Talk&quot;, released in 1994. Carson had approached him to make an album with the &quot;90125&quot; line-up for his independent label, Victory Music. Knowing the importance of having a close collaboration with Anderson, the two wrote the album at a motel in San Clemente, California. The group chose Rabin to oversee its production, the recording for which occurred at Rabin&#x27;s home studio and A&amp;M Recording Studios using digital non-linear recording and editing with Digital Performer over traditional tape. &quot;The Calling&quot; and &quot;Walls&quot; were released as singles that charted at No. 3 and No. 24 on the Hot Mainstream Rock chart, respectively. After touring the US, South America, and Japan through 1995, Rabin left the band in the following year to work in film.

=== 1995–2012: Film composer===
In 1995, Rabin scored additional music to the film &quot;Fair Game&quot;. He then produced a complete score for &quot;The Glimmer Man&quot; (1996), directed by John Gray for Warner Bros. starring Steven Seagal. Rabin landed the job after Seagal asked him for guitar lessons. Rabin said: &quot;I went to his house and afterwards he said &#x27;Thank you so much, I really appreciate it. If there&#x27;s anything I can do for you...&#x27; and I said to him &#x27;You know, I really want to get into film scoring&#x27;.&quot; Rabin then accepted Seagal&#x27;s offer to score the film. Rabin went on to form a longtime partnership with Jerry Bruckheimer after he worked on the soundtrack to &quot;Con Air&quot; with Mancina. Rabin has scored 13 films by Bruckheimer. Rabin has twice scored for silent films as a way of practising his composition and orchestration skills, first on the piano and transcribing the music for orchestra. Rabin picked out &quot;Building the Barn&quot; by Maurice Jarre from his score to &quot;Witness&quot; (1985) as a piece of particular influence on him.

In 1997, Rabin performed &quot;I Can&#x27;t Look Away&quot; at a Prince&#x27;s Trust concert for Nelson Mandela in Johannesburg. Rabin called his meeting with Mandela and his family as &quot;an immensely proud moment&quot; of his life. In June 1999, he was one of several guest rock musicians performing with the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra conducted by George Martin at a charity fund-raising concert. In the early 2000s, Rabin declined an offer to join Foreigner as keyboardist due to contractual obligations with film scoring. In 2003, Rabin released several of his demo tracks, of which some were recorded by Yes on &quot;90125&quot;, as &quot;90124&quot;. Later that year, he released &quot;Live in LA&quot;, a live album recorded in 1989 on his &quot;Can&#x27;t Look Away&quot; tour. In 2004, Rabin joined former and current members of Yes to perform &quot;Cinema&quot; and &quot;Owner of a Lonely Heart&quot; at a tribute concert for producer Trevor Horn at Wembley Arena in London, in aid of the Prince&#x27;s Trust. On 9 July 2010, Rabin performed with Yes at their show in Los Angeles for &quot;Owner of a Lonely Heart&quot;, the show&#x27;s encore.

Rabin&#x27;s score for &quot;Glory Road&quot; features vocals from Alicia Keys. His composition &quot;Titans Spirit&quot; from &quot;Remember the Titans&quot; (2000) has been used for NBC&#x27;s coverage of the summer and winter Olympic Games and Barack Obama&#x27;s speech and celebration upon winning the 2008 US presidential election. Rabin composed the theme for Turner Broadcasting System&#x27;s &quot;NBA on TNT&quot; in 2002, &quot;MLB on TBS&quot; in 2007, and &quot;March Madness&quot; in 2011, and Disney&#x27;s attraction at Epcot. In 1995, Rabin produced a set of system software alert sounds for the Apple Power Macintosh computer.

===2012–present: Return to solo and band work===

Rabin&#x27;s fifth solo album and his first in 23 years, &quot;Jacaranda&quot;, was released on 8 May 2012 on Varèse Sarabande. The album came about in 2007 when Rabin began, without any direction from a record company, write &quot;music that I enjoy ... that will be challenging for me to play&quot;. He opted for an instrumental album as one with vocals did not interest him at the time. Recording the album took time as it was completed during breaks from working on film scores. In 2011, Rabin turned down various scoring projects to complete the album. Rabin plays all of the instruments himself with the exception of drums, for which he used Vinnie Colaiuta, Lou Molino III, and his son Ryan. Tal Wilkenfeld plays bass on &quot;Anerley Road&quot; and Liz Constantine provides vocals on &quot;Rescue&quot;, a track Rabin originally recorded for &quot;The Guardian&quot; (2006).

In 2016, Rabin took a break from film scoring to co-form a self-described new version of Yes with Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman. He had toured worldwide with the group from October 2016 to 2018. A studio album was in development, but it was scrapped partly due to the inconvenience of the three having to share ideas online as Wakeman lived in England and Anderson and Rabin in different parts of California.

In 2020, a 10-CD career-spanning box set of Rabin&#x27;s solo material, Yes outtakes, and soundtracks was released entitled &quot;Changes&quot;. Rabin performed at the Alan White tribute concert on 2 October 2022.

In December 2022, Rabin announced that his sixth studio album &quot;Rio&quot; was complete. The album took several years to make; in 2017 Rabin said he was roughly halfway through recording and in 2020, said he was working hard on the album. The album is Rabin&#x27;s first album featuring lead vocals since &quot;Can&#x27;t Look Away&quot;. &quot;Big Mistakes&quot; was released as a digital single on 4 August, followed by “Push” on 5 September, and “Oklahoma” on 29 September. The album was released on 6 October 2023 by Inside Out Music and Sony.

== Personal life ==
Rabin has been married to his wife Shelley May since 1978. The pair first met when they were at school. They have resided in Hollywood, Los Angeles since 1984 and have one son, Ryan. Ryan is a drummer and record producer, and a former member of The Anthem, The Outline, and from 2009 to 2017, the alternative rock band Grouplove.

In 1987, Rabin said of his time in South Africa: &quot;I can&#x27;t remember the feeling of living there anymore. It&#x27;s like it was in another life. That&#x27;s sad in a way. It is my country ... I don&#x27;t live there but carry South Africa with me.&quot; He said that Yes were offered to perform in Sun City, but Rabin refused as it was indirectly sanctioning the country&#x27;s apartheid system. In 1991, Rabin became a naturalised US citizen. He is a godfather to former Yes drummer Alan White&#x27;s son Jesse.

== Awards ==
Rabin has received eleven Broadcast Music Incorporated film score awards and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Temecula Valley International Film Festival.

In June 2011, Rabin received an award at the 26th ASCAP Film and Television Music Awards in the Top Box Office Films category for &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; (2010). On 28 June 2012, Rabin received a Henry Mancini Award at the 27th ASCAP Film &amp; Television Music Awards. Rabin also performed &quot;Owner of a Lonely Heart&quot; with his son&#x27;s band Grouplove.

In 2017, while still a member of ARW, Trevor Rabin was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame along with fellow members of Yes. He performed on &quot;Owner of a Lonely Heart&quot; and &#x27;Roundabout,&quot; the latter which featured Geddy Lee of Rush on bass guitar.

== Influences ==
Rabin names Bernard Herrmann as his favourite score composer. He has named Arnold Schoenberg as one of his favourite classical composers, and him and other classical composers – Beethoven, Ravel, Elgar and Tchaikovsky – as influences.

<text>Forest/Jupiter station is a DART light rail station in Garland, Texas. The station is located in western Garland at the intersection of Forest Lane and Jupiter Road. It is served by the .

The station serves a large industrial corridor (including facilities for Sherwin-Williams and Kraft Heinz) and the Garland Independent School District administration building. A neighborhood north of the station contains the Walnut Creek Branch of Garland&#x27;s Nicholson Memorial Library System.

== History ==
Plans for a station at the Forest/Jupiter intersection date back to DART&#x27;s first rail plan in 1983. The station would be built on an existing freight corridor constructed by the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad. A more detailed plan of the corridor in 1997 proposed that the station and the crossings over Forest and Jupiter be elevated; ultimately, the station was constructed at-grade, but the crossings remained elevated.

The Blue Line was extended to both Forest/Jupiter and Downtown Garland on November 18, 2002. The station was decorated with stylized plows and gearworks, as well as a wind-activated sculpture, which contains stylized prayer wheels in tribute to the area&#x27;s Asian population.

On August 15, 2009, the station was temporarily closed due to a chemical spill in an adjacent industrial park.

In 2013, the city of Garland created a tax increment financing district for the area around the station.

<text>LBJ/Skillman station is a DART light rail station in Dallas, Texas. It is located on the western frontage road of Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway (I-635), approximately southeast of the road&#x27;s interchange with Skillman Street and Audelia Road. The station serves the .

The station is a park-and-ride lot. A bus route connects the station to Dallas College Richland Campus.

== Artwork ==
In tribute to both I-635 and Lady Bird Johnson&#x27;s support of highway beautification, LBJ/Skillman station is decorated with a highway theme. The station&#x27;s columns feature tire tread patterns containing DART&#x27;s chevron logo, and the station&#x27;s paving contains a stylized map of I-635. Windscreens contain quotations from Lyndon B. Johnson and Lady Bird Johnson stylized to resemble highway signage.

A seating area on the northwest corner of the platform is designed to resemble a highway rest area. The surrounding parking lots contain a central median with mile markers counting down to the station platform. The station is dedicated with native plants and wildflowers similar to those used on Texas roadways, which Lady Bird Johnson personally praised.

== History ==
Plans for a station at the intersection of LBJ and Skillman/Audelia, which would be located on an existing Missouri–Kansas–Texas freight corridor, date back to DART&#x27;s original 1983 rail plan. A 1997 proposal, which called the station LBJ/Audelia, outlined five potential locations: two north of I-635 on its frontage road, two south of I-635 on Audelia Road, and one on the bridge crossing I-635.

The station opened on May 6, 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;LBJ/Skillman Opening&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It served as the northern terminus of the Blue Line until the line was extended to Downtown Garland in November.

In 2009, the city of Dallas announced the construction of a pedestrian bridge over I-635, which would connect the station to Audelia Road south of I-635. The bridge was completed in 2011.

<text>White Rock station is a DART light rail station in Dallas, Texas. The station serves the . Located on Northwest Highway (Loop 12) in East Dallas, the station serves the Lakewood neighborhood and White Rock Lake.

The station directly connects to the White Rock Creek Trail, which in turn connects the station to White Rock Lake, Flag Pole Hill Park, and the SoPac Trail.

== History ==
In 1997, DART purchased a Knights of Columbus lodge for use as a station site, which was tentatively named Northwest Highway.

Construction on the site began on January 15, 1999 as part of a larger extension between Mockingbird station and Garland. The station was designed to evoke historic architecture around White Rock Lake, including a faux-spillway filled with landscaping and columns in the style of the White Rock Lake boathouse.

A test run of the of track between Mockingbird and White Rock was completed in July 2001. White Rock station opened three months later on September 24, 2001. It served as the northern terminus of the Blue Line until May 2002, when the line was extended to LBJ/Skillman.

In 2002, Dallas received $10.9 million in federal funding to extend the Katy Trail to White Rock station.
