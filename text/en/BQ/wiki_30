==Council==
===Council composition (as of 2023)===
Due to conflicts in the previous council a new electoral structure was established for Geelong in 2017. The number of wards was reduced to 4 with 3 councillors for each (except Windermere having 2) elected by proportional representation. Residents were also no longer able to directly elect a mayor. 
 The current councillors, in order of election at the 2020 election, are:

==Administrators==
In December 2015, the Minister for Local Government Natalie Hutchins appointed a Commission of Inquiry into the Greater Geelong City Council in response to concerns about the workplace culture and adequacy of governance structures.

The Inquiry found that the council is riven with conflict, unable to manage Geelong&#x27;s economic challenges, has dysfunctional leadership and has a culture of bullying.

On the recommendation of the commission, the Victoria State Government dismissed the entire Greater Geelong City Council on 16 April 2016 and appointed Yehudi Blacher as interim administrator. On 25 May 2016, Dr Kathy Alexander (chairperson), Peter Dorling and Laurinda Gardner were sworn in as administrators, replacing Yehudi Blacher.

Under the &quot;Local Government (Greater Geelong City Council) Act 2016&quot;, the panel of administrators constitutes the Greater Geelong City Council, and has the same functions, powers and duties as the Greater Geelong City Council and its councillors. Likewise, the chairperson of the panel of administrators has the same functions, powers and duties as the mayor of the council.

The council was run by administrators until fresh council elections were held on 27 October 2017.

<text>Naomi Shihab Nye (; born March 12, 1952) is an Arab American poet, editor, songwriter, and novelist. Born to a Palestinian father and an American mother, she began composing her first poetry at the age of six. In total, she has published or contributed to over 30 volumes of poetry. Her works include poetry, young-adult fiction, picture books, and novels. Nye received the 2013 NSK Neustadt Prize for Children&#x27;s Literature in honor of her entire body of work as a writer, and in 2019 the Poetry Foundation designated her the Young People&#x27;s Poet Laureate for the 2019–21 term.

==Early life==
Naomi Shihab Nye is a poet and songwriter born in 1952 to a Palestinian father, Aziz Shihab, who worked as a journalist, editor and writer, and American mother, Miriam Allwardt Shihab, an artist who worked as a Montessori school teacher. Her father grew up in Palestine. He and his family became refugees in the 1948 Nakba, when the state of Israel was created. She has said her father &quot;seemed a little shell-shocked when I was a child.&quot;

She grew up initially in Ferguson, St. Louis County, Missouri. Her mother studied under Philip Guston and Max Beckmann at Washington University in St. Louis. In 1966, when Nye was 14, the family moved to the West Bank, then part of Jordan, when her father&#x27;s mother was sick. After less than a year, before the 1967 Six-Day War occurred, they moved to San Antonio, Texas.

Nye graduated from Robert E. Lee High School, where she was editor of the literary magazine. She earned a BA in English and world religions from Trinity University in 1974 and has lived in San Antonio since.

==Career==

===Teaching writing===
After graduation, Nye worked as a writer-in-schools with the Texas Commission on the Arts. She has continued to teach writing workshops, mostly to kids. Currently, she teaches creative writing at Texas State University.

===Writing===
Nye characterizes herself as a &quot;wandering poet,&quot; and says that much of her poetry is inspired by her childhood memories and her travels. She considers San Antonio her current home, &quot;San Antonio feels most like home as I have lived here the longest. But everywhere can be home the moment you unpack, make a tiny space that feels agreeable&quot;. San Antonio is the inspiration behind many of her poems. Both roots and sense of place are major themes in her body of work. Her poems are frank and accessible, often making use of ordinary images in startling ways. Her ability to enter into foreign experiences and chronicle them from the inside is reminiscent of Elizabeth Bishop, while her simple and direct &quot;voice&quot; is akin to that of her mentor William Stafford.

Her first collection of poems, &quot;Different Ways to Pray&quot;, explored the theme of similarities and differences between cultures, which would become one of her lifelong areas of focus. Her other books include poetry collections &quot;19 Varieties of Gazelle: Poems of the Middle East&quot;, &quot;Red Suitcase&quot;, and &quot;Fuel&quot;; a collection of essays entitled &quot;Never in a Hurry&quot;; a young-adult novel called &quot;Habibi&quot; (the autobiographical story of an Arab-American teenager who moves to Jerusalem in the 1970s) and picture book &quot;Lullaby Raft&quot;, which is also the title of one of her two albums of music. (The other is called Rutabaga-Roo; both were limited-edition.)

Nye&#x27;s first two chapter books, &quot;Tattooed Feet&quot; (1977) and &quot;Eye-to-Eye&quot; (1978), are written in free verse and possess themes of questing. Nye&#x27;s first full-length collection, &quot;Different Ways to Pray&quot; (1980), explores the differences between and shared experiences of cultures from California to Texas and from South America to Mexico. &quot;Hugging the Jukebox&quot; (1982), a full-length collection that won the Voertman Poetry Prize, focuses on the connections between diverse peoples and on the perspectives of those in other lands. &quot;Yellow Glove&quot; (1986) presents poems with more tragic and sorrowful themes. According to the Poetry Foundation, &quot;Fuel&quot; (1998) may be Nye&#x27;s most acclaimed volume and ranges over a variety of subjects, scenes and settings.

Nye&#x27;s poem &quot;Famous&quot; was referenced and quoted in full by Judge Andre Davis in his concurring opinion on the case &quot;G. G. v. Gloucester County School Board&quot;.

Her poem &quot;So much happiness&quot; was included in the &#x27;Happiness&#x27; edition of &quot;Parabola&quot;.

===Editing anthologies===
Nye has edited many anthologies of poems, for audiences both young and old. One of the best-known is &quot;This Same Sky: A Collection of Poems from around the World&quot;, which contains translated work by 129 poets from 68 different countries. Her most recent anthology is called &quot;Is This Forever, Or What?: Poems &amp; Paintings from Texas&quot;.

==Awards and recognition==
Nye has won many awards and fellowships, among them four Pushcart Prizes, the Jane Addams Children&#x27;s Book Award, the Paterson Poetry Prize, and many notable book and best book citations from the American Library Association, and a 2,000 Witter Bynner Fellowship. In 1997, Trinity University, her alma mater, honored her with the Distinguished Alumna Award.

In 1997, Nye became a Guggenheim Poetry Fellow. In 2000, Nye became a Witter Bynner Fellow, awarded by the Library of Congress. In 2002, she became a Lannan Literary Fellow. In June 2009, Nye was named as one of PeaceByPeace.com&#x27;s first peace heroes. In 2013, Nye won the Robert Creeley Award.

In October 2012, she was named laureate of the 2013 NSK Neustadt Prize for Children&#x27;s Literature. The NSK Prize is a juried award sponsored by the University of Oklahoma and &quot;World Literature Today&quot; magazine. In her nominating statement, Ibtisam Barakat, the juror who championed Nye for the award wrote, &quot;Naomi&#x27;s incandescent humanity and voice can change the world, or someone&#x27;s world, by taking a position not one word less beautiful than an exquisite poem.&quot; Barakat commended her work by saying, &quot;Naomi&#x27;s poetry masterfully blends music, images, colors, languages, and insights into poems that ache like a shore pacing in ebb and flow, expecting the arrival of meaning.&quot;

In 2019, the Poetry Foundation designated Nye their Young People&#x27;s Poet Laureate for the 2019–21 term. The foundation&#x27;s announcement characterized Nye&#x27;s writing style as one that &quot;moves seamlessly between ages in a way that is accessible, warm, and sophisticated even for the youngest of readers.&quot;

In 2023, she was awarded an honorary degree from Vermont College of Fine Arts.

==Personal life==
Although she calls herself a &quot;wandering poet&quot;, Nye refers to San Antonio as her home and lives there with her family. She says a visit to her grandmother in the West Bank village of Sinjil was a life-changing experience. In 1978, she married Michael Nye, who worked initially as an attorney and later on photography and on writing on topics including hunger, teenage pregnancy and mental illness. They have one son.

<doc id="493023" wikidata="Q1476850" url="?curid=493023" title="Rural City of Mildura">
<text>The Rural City of Mildura is a local government area in Victoria, Australia, located in the north-western part of the state. It covers an area of being the largest LGA in the state. In August 2021 the area had a population of 56,972. It includes the city of Mildura and the towns of Merbein, Red Cliffs, Irymple, Ouyen, Werrimull, Murrayville, Walpeup and Hattah. It was formed in 1995 from the amalgamation of the City of Mildura, Shire of Mildura and Shire of Walpeup.

The Rural City is governed and administered by the Mildura Rural City Council; its seat of local government and administrative centre is located at the council headquarters in Mildura, it also has service centres located in Ouyen and a couple of other locations within Mildura. The Rural City is named after the main urban settlement lying in the north of the LGA, that is Mildura, which is also the LGA&#x27;s most populous urban centre with a population of 30,647.

The Rural City of Mildura covers most of the Mallee region of Victoria. Before the less infertile soils were fertilised and developed for the production of wheat and barley the whole region was covered in a dense mallee scrub of deep-rooting eucalypts that regenerated after the frequent bushfires in the region. Many of the soils are so sandy that clearing is impractical, and Murray-Sunset National Park covers almost a third of the area of the LGA. Other protected areas include Hattah-Kulkyne National Park and Murray-Kulkyne Park on the Murray River.

The climate of the region is the driest in Victoria, and Neds Corner in the remote northwest has the lowest average annual rainfall in the state at . In the south at Ouyen the average is . In all the areas of the LGA there can be considerable variation in annual rainfall: the range historically has been from in 1967 to in 1973. Temperatures in the LGA are the hottest in Victoria and the average summer maximum is , but it often exceeds . Winter can be very pleasant with a maximum of , but frosts are common in the morning and can sometimes be severe.

The southeast of the LGA is used primarily for grain growing; however yields are erratic and often poor due to drought. In the north irrigated fruit growing (primarily oranges and grapes) is highly productive and supports Mildura and nearby towns; however, salinity in the Murray River is a major threat to the long-term sustainability of these activities, as is competition from overseas citrus growers.

In 2006 the Rural City of Mildura had a population of 49,815, most of which was located in Mildura (30,016) and adjacent areas (that is Victorian Sunraysia). Many of the small towns in the region have practically disappeared as more efficient farming methods reduce the quantity of human labour required.

<doc id="493025" wikidata="Q663742" url="?curid=493025" title="Borough of Queenscliffe">
<text>The Borough of Queenscliffe is a local government area in the Barwon South West region of Victoria, Australia, located in the southern part of the state. It is the smallest local government area in Victoria, covering an area of and, in June 2018, had a population of . It includes only two settlements, which are Queenscliff and Point Lonsdale. It is situated on the south coast, south-east of Geelong on the Bellarine Peninsula south of Swan Bay and next to the Port Phillip Heads, the entrance to Port Phillip Bay from Bass Strait.

The Borough is governed and administered by the Queenscliffe Borough Council; its seat of local government and administrative centre is located at the council headquarters in Queenscliff. The Borough is named after the main settlement located in the centre of the LGA, that is Queenscliff, which is also the LGA&#x27;s most populous urban centre with a population of 1,315.

==History==
The Borough of Queenscliffe was established on 12 May 1863. Queenscliff was first and foremost built for government purposes, providing postal, customs, health and telegraph services, lighthouse and signal services, military and defence establishments and the sea pilots service.

===Survival of the local council restructure===
Queenscliffe is the last borough remaining in both Victoria and all of Australia and was the only LGA not to have been subject to changes to its boundaries and/or name in the Victorian local government restructure which took place between 1993 and 1995. Had the same restructuring principles, which had been applied to other municipalities in the state, also been applied to Queenscliffe, the Borough would have been absorbed into the new City of Greater Geelong.

Queenscliffe&#x27;s exclusion from the restructure was debated in the Victorian Parliament at the time.

Liberal Premier Jeff Kennett, in explaining his reasons, stated:
Labor member for Melbourne Neil Cole suggested that his reasons were, in fact, based on internal Liberal Party considerations:

Kennett explicitly denied that this was the case:

Labor member George Seitz suggested a more innocent reason:

Overall, the reasons for Queenscliffe being excluded remain unclear, and the range of opinions may perhaps best be summarised by Peter Loney&#x27;s quip:
===Reduction in number of councillors===
At the 2008 elections the number of councillors was reduced from seven to the current five.

==Council==

===Current composition===
The council is composed of five councillors elected to represent an unsubdivided municipality. The current council was elected in November 2024 for a four-year term. Councillors are elected on a proportional representation basis.

===Mayors===
* Pat Semmens (2006–2008)
* Bob Merriman (2008–2012; 2018–19)
* Hélène Cameron (2012–2016)
* Tony Francis (2016–2017)
* Susan Salter (2017–2018)
* Ross Ebbels (2019–2022)
* Isabelle Tolhurst (2022-2024)
* Ross Ebbels (2024)
* Di Rule (2024-present)

===Administration and governance===
The council meets in the council chambers at the council headquarters in the Queenscliffe Municipal Offices, which is also the location of the council&#x27;s administrative activities. It also provides customer services at its administrative centre in Queenscliff.

<text>The Rural City of Wangaratta is a local government area in the Hume region of Victoria, Australia, located in the north-east part of the state. It covers an area of and, in August 2021, had a population of 29,808. It includes the towns of Cheshunt, Eldorado, Everton, Glenrowan, Greta, Greta West, Milawa, Moyhu, Oxley, Tarrawingee, Wangaratta and Whitfield. It was formed in 1994 from the amalgamation of the City of Wangaratta, Shire of Wangaratta, Shire of Oxley, and parts of the United Shire of Beechworth, Shire of Benalla and Shire of Yarrawonga. When formed the municipality was originally called the Shire of Milawa, but a few months later, was renamed to its current name.

The Rural City is governed and administered by the Wangaratta Rural City Council; its seat of local government and administrative centre is located at the council headquarters in Wangaratta. The Rural City is named after the main urban settlement located in the north of the LGA, that is Wangaratta, which is also the LGA&#x27;s most populous urban centre with a population of around 18,500.

==Council==

===Current composition===
The council is composed of seven single-councillor wards. As of the 2024 election, the seven councillors are:
====History====

The election of Councillors in 2016 followed a three year period where the Council was governed by Administrators. Administrators had been appointed by an Act of Parliament, following the dismissal of the Councillors elected at the 2012 general election. A panel of three administrators, by an Act of Parliament, was appointed to oversee the council until the 2016 municipal elections.

In 2023, the Victoria Electoral Commission commenced an electoral structure review into the existing Ward structures of the Rural City of Wangaratta to satisfy the requirements of the Local Government Act 2020 (Vic). As a result of this review, the council moved to seven single-councillor wards for the 2024 election. Previously, the council was divided into 4 wards, including a four-councillor city ward.

===Administration and governance===
The councillors meet in the council chambers at the council headquarters in the Wangaratta Government Centre, which is also the location of the council&#x27;s administrative activities. It also provides customer services at its administrative centre in Wangaratta.

==Townships and localities==
The 2021 census, the rural city had a population of 29,808 up from 28,310 in the 2016 census

<text>The mass media in Sweden has a long tradition going back to the 1766 law enacting freedom of the press.

The press is subsidized by the government and is owned by many actors, the dominant owner being Bonnier AB. Swedish television and radio were until the mid-1980s a government monopoly, which slowly has been eroded despite resistance, with a call for prohibition of private ownership of satellite dish receivers.

Until 2019, public service media was financed by a special fee levied on owners of television or radio receivers. Reporting ownership was voluntary, but television sellers were obliged to report purchase to the government, and the government also had a special service of agents, with equipment capable of detecting emissions from television receivers, patrolling residential areas in order to catch unreported receivers. In 2018, the Riksdag voted to instead make paying for public service mandatory for all people having an income. The change was supported by all parliamentary parties except the Sweden Democrats.

Swedish media has mechanisms for self-regulation, such as the Press Council.

== Press ==

The Swedish press is subsidized by the government through press support. Originally this was directly distributed through the political parties to their supporting newspapers, but nowadays subsidies are more direct in form, and are tied to certain requirements, e.g. a minimum of 2000 subscribers. Support also exists in indirect form in the shape of partial tax-exceptions.

The Swedish Press is self-regulated through the Public Press Ombudsman, or &quot;Allmänhetens Pressombudsman&quot; and the Swedish Press Council, or &quot;Pressens Opinionsnämnd&quot;. One example of this is that Swedish media follow a principle of not disclosing the identities of suspected criminals. There was some controversy when on 27 September 2003 published the name and picture of Mijailo Mijailović, who was the suspected assassin of Swedish foreign minister Anna Lindh.

Freedom of the press in Sweden dates back to 1766 when it was enshrined in a law enacted by the Riksdag of the Estates (see Freedom of the press#Sweden). It is today a part of the Constitution of Sweden.

The Swedish newspaper with the widest circulation is the evening newspaper &quot;Aftonbladet&quot;, controlled by the Norwegian media conglomerate Schibsted (majority holder) and the Swedish Trade Union Confederation. Its competitor, &quot;Expressen&quot;, is controlled by Bonnier AB and has sister editions in Gothenburg (&quot;GT&quot;) and Malmö (&quot;Kvällsposten&quot;). Bonnier AB also controls the major national morning newspaper, . Its Stockholm competitor &quot;Svenska Dagbladet&quot; is owned by Schibsted. &quot;Göteborgs-Posten&quot; is the major regional newspaper in Gothenburg and the west of Sweden, while another Bonnier-owned newspaper, &quot;Sydsvenska Dagbladet&quot;, dominates in Malmö and the south. Bonnier AB also owns Sweden&#x27;s major business newspaper, &quot;Dagens Industri&quot;. &quot;The Local&quot; is one of the few English language general news websites in the country which has been the subject of attacks by groups such as Anonymous and has seen an upsurge of people complaining of censorship and bias. In recent years, Swedish state broadcaster, Sverigesradio, has been offering a wider selection of news through its website in English.

Through its subsidiary Bonnier Tidskrifter AB, Bonnier AB also controls many of Sweden&#x27;s most popular magazines, such as &quot;Amelia&quot;, &quot;Allt om Mat&quot;, &quot;Teknikens Värld&quot; and the business magazine &quot;Veckans Affärer&quot;. Other major magazine publishers in Sweden are Allers förlag, the Danish-controlled Egmont and the French Hachette Filipacchi Médias.

Sweden also has many large organizations which almost all produce membership magazines with a wide readership. The biggest ones, with readership figures above 300 000, include &quot;Vår bostad&quot; (published by the Union of Tenants and HSB, a cooperative building society), PRO-pensionären (published by the Pensioners’ National Organization) and the magazines of the largest trade unions: Kommunalarbetaren (published by the Municipal Workers&#x27; Union), &quot;Siftidningen&quot; (published by the Union of Clerical and Technical Employees in Industry) and &quot;Dagens Arbete&quot; (published jointly by the Metalworkers&#x27; Union, the Industrial Union, the Graphic Workers&#x27; Union, the Paper Workers&#x27; Union and the Forest and Wood Workers&#x27; Union).

With the rise of the internet, many magazines have ceased publication, see :Category:Defunct magazines published in Sweden. Newspaper weeklies have also declined, but one example of a nation-wide weekly is :sv:Kvällsstunden.

== Television ==
Television trials from the Royal Institute of Technology started in 1954. Broadcasts officially started in 1956. The broadcasts were made by the public broadcaster Sveriges Radio. When a second channel, TV2, started in 1969 it was broadcast by the same company, but the two channels were supposed to compete against each other. Since SR was split into four different companies in the late 70s, the television broadcasting has been the responsibility of Sveriges Television (SVT).

SVT and its two channels dominated television for a long time. In 1987 the first commercial channel, TV3 was started, broadcasting from London via satellite. In connection with the loosening up of the State media monopoly there was a debate regarding how to preserve the media monopoly, with Social Democratic parliamentarian Maj Britt Theorin proposing that private ownership of satellite dishes be prohibited in Sweden.

In the early 1990s, TV4 became the first commercial channel to be allowed to join the national terrestrial broadcasting network, run by Teracom. Sveriges Television is funded by a fee—fixed by Parliament and collected by the Kiruna-based Receiving Licence Agency, Radiotjänst i Kiruna AB—and is regulated, together with TV4, by the Swedish Broadcasting Commission.

Sweden was an early adopter of digital terrestrial television, officially launching it in April 1999. The analogue shutdown of the SVT and TV4 signals started in September 2005 and was completed in late 2007.

Four companies and five channels dominate the Swedish television viewing:
* SVT with SVT1 and SVT2
* TV4 AB with TV4 (owned by Telia)
* Viasat with TV3 (owned by Modern Times Group)
* SBS Broadcasting Group with Kanal 5 (owned by Warner Bros. Discovery)

The prospect of the digital shutdown has caused SVT and TV4 to start several new channels. SVT have SVT24, SVTB and Kunskapskanalen. TV4 have started lots of channels, including TV4 Plus, TV4 Film, TV400 and TV4 Fakta. Channels owned by Viasat include TV6 and TV8. Other channels such as Eurosport, Discovery Channel, MTV Sweden and Disney Channel Scandinavia also have a relatively strong position in Sweden.

Two dominating networks of premium content exists: TV1000 and Viasat Sport, owned by Viasat, and C More Entertainment owned by TV4 Gruppen (using the Canal+ brand).

The main pay television distributors are: Com Hem (cable), Boxer (terrestrial), Viasat (satellite) and Canal Digital (satellite). There are also several smaller cable networks, most notably Tele2Vision and Telia Digital-tv. As of 2006, it is estimated that 50 percent of the households receive their television signals from a cable network, 30 percent from a regular aerial and 20 percent using a satellite dish.

== Radio ==
National radio is dominated by public service company Sveriges Radio (SR), which is funded through the same fee that is collected for television sets. The sale of commercial radio licenses began in the early 1990s, though commercial radio existed before this through local stations in the larger cities (närradio).

SR have four national channels: P1, P2, P3 and P4. P4 is a regional network where 25 stations broadcast locally for much of the day.

Two systems exist for private radio: community radio (&quot;närradio&quot;) and local commercial radio (PLR, &quot;privat lokalradio&quot;).

When the PLR licenses were auctioned in the early 1990s several different local stations appeared. The licensees would consolidate over the years and in 2006 almost all licenses were owned by Modern Times Group or SBS Broadcasting Group, since SBS bought Fria Media in February 2006.

Most stations are part of a network, the two largest being Rix FM (36 stations, MTG) and Mix Megapol (24 stations, SBS), both using AC-formats. Three other networks exist: The Soft AC network Lugna Favoriter (12 stations, MTG) and two CHR networks, only present in the three major cities: The Voice (SBS) and NRJ (MTG).

== Journalistic bias ==
The Department of Journalism and Mass Communication (JMG) at Gothenburg University has conducted yearly surveys regarding their political party sympathies among the members of the Swedish Union of Journalists (), the largest trade union organizing journalists in Sweden. A survey, conducted between late 2011 and early 2012, has shown a significantly higher percentage of support for the leftwing political parties (mainly the Left Party and the Green Party) compared to these parties&#x27; support amongst the general Swedish population.

After the elections 2010, the researcher Kent Asp studied more than 1000 articles from Sweden&#x27;s major newspapers and found a strong bias towards the political right. 43% of all articles written about the Red-Greens were negative, compared to only 27% written about the centre-right Alliance. When describing the political leaders of the two political blocks, a majority of all articles, 53% were negative in describing the Red-Green candidate Mona Sahlin, whereas only 30% of the articles about the Alliance candidate Fredrik Reinfeldt.

As regards to foreign policy issues, Swedish media has often been reporting biased towards the United States and the George W. Bush administration, and towards Israel in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. A debate was sparked in 2004 when the Sveriges Radio correspondent in the United States, Cecilia Uddén, who was reporting from the 2004 presidential election, said during a live radio debate:

I don&#x27;t think either that Swedish media have any requirement whatsoever regarding fairness when it comes to the U.S. election. We have no reason to be fair and present both sides views as we would have done in a Swedish election.&lt;br&gt;()

After this statement Uddén was put into quarantine by the management of Sveriges Radio for the rest of the U.S. election. Uddén is currently the correspondent for Sveriges Radio in the Middle East. Regarding the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, Uddén has stated in an interview that &quot;in order to be able to describe the conflict honestly you have to side with the weaker part [i.e. the Palestinians]&quot; ()

== Controversies ==

=== Crime reporting ===
The mainstream Swedish media has been accused of not sufficiently covering the Bombings in Sweden in its daily news.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.com/news/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ideological and political bias in reporting ===
The reporting in Swedish media has sometimes, by journalists, been accused of bias and cover-ups, in particular as regards Swedish immigration policy and the societal and financial costs associated with it. Criticism has focused on accusations that those in the media who shape public opinion often do this based on ideological constructs and exhibit a lack of awareness of current societal problems, often pointing to the fact that journalists and editors predominantly reside in segregated low-risk upper middle-class areas. Well-known Swedish journalists have echoed criticism regarding cover-ups, with Janne Josefsson calling it &quot;one of the worst betrayals we journalists have made ourselves guilty of&quot;(&quot;ett av de värsta sveken vi journalister gjort oss skyldiga till&quot;). He also notes that critics were unjustifiably silenced through racism allegations. A former high-profile News-presenter of the Swedish State Television resigned her position and made a public statement that she did so due to the bias in State TV news-reporting and the belittling and racism accusations launched at critics.

In April 2005, Andreas Carlgren from the Center Party published a report saying that the State Media are politically biased through direct political control, predominantly by the Social Democratic party. He accused the Social Democrats of having a long-term party policy to fill strategically important positions in the public-service media with persons loyal to the party.
This has resulted in media-reporting being susceptible to being directed by political considerations.

In December 2010, the ruling Centre-Right Alliance was heavily criticized when they implemented a law that required that all new public service products needed to be pre-approved by the government before they could be approved. Mats Svegfors, the CEO of the Swedish public service radio channels called this &quot;unconstitutional&quot;.

=== Female genital mutilation reports ===

In June 2014, Norrköpings Tidningar published a story on genital mutilation, which was picked up by the foreign press, including The Independent and The Daily News. It was claimed that every single girl in one school class had been victims of genital mutilation. None of the newspapers said where and when the genital mutilation took place. It was later published by Sweden&#x27;s national public radio that none of the girls had been subjected to the procedure, or had any procedure performed on them abroad, while living in Sweden.

<doc id="493034" wikidata="Q1273502" url="?curid=493034" title="City of Warrnambool">
<text>The City of Warrnambool is a local government area in the Barwon South West region of Victoria, Australia, located in the south-western part of the state. It covers an area of and in June 2018 had a population of 34,862. It is entirely surrounded by the Shire of Moyne and the Southern Ocean. It is one of only a few regional councils in Victoria to remain serving just one urban district after the amalgamation process of 1994, although through that process it did gain some portions of the former Shire of Warrnambool.

The city is governed and administered by the Warrnambool City Council; its seat of local government and administrative centre is located at the council headquarters in the central district of Warrnambool. The city is named after the main urban settlement located in the centre of the LGA, that is Warrnambool, which is also the LGA&#x27;s most populous urban centre with a population of 28,413.

==History==
Warrnambool was first incorporated as a municipality on 7 December 1855. It became a borough on 1 October 1863, and a town on 2 February 1883. It was proclaimed as a city on 8 April 1918. On 25 October 1955 and 1 October 1978, it annexed part of the south riding of the Shire of Warrnambool, expanding its area progressively to by the time of Victoria&#x27;s local government amalgamations.

In 1993, the new Kennett Liberal government announced a program of local government reform, in which many of Victoria&#x27;s 210 councils were to be amalgamated. The southwest region containing 23 councils was the first to be reviewed, and the City of Warrnambool sought to be part of the process early on. Warrnambool&#x27;s strength in tertiary education and manufacturing was taken into account. By June, it was clear that Warrnambool would be the only municipality in the region to be spared, and that it would gain Allansford and some other rural areas from the Shire of Warrnambool. On 23 September 1994, the council was dismissed and replaced with a Government-appointed commissioner. It first held elections for a new council in March 1996.

==Council==

===Current composition===
The council is composed of seven councillors elected to represent an unsubdivided municipality.

The most recent council election was declared on 10 November 2020, with the Councillors sworn into office on 23 November 2020. At their first meeting, Councillors resolved to elect both a Mayor and Deputy Mayor, each for a term of 12 months.
====Former wards====
Prior to the statewide amalgamations of the 1990s, the council had four wards and twelve councillors, with three councillors per ward elected to represent each ward; the former wards were Albert, Hopkins, Merri and Victoria. The new council then had, until 2004, seven wards and seven councillors, with one councillor per ward elected to represent each ward. However post-2004, following an electoral representation review, the decision was made to keep the seven councillors, but abolish the wards, as the review concluded that the geography and natural features of Warrnambool didn&#x27;t support the retention of equal wards, and that the City of Warrnambool as a whole was a single community of interest.

Former wards from 1996 to 2004:
* Botanic Ward
* Cassady Ward
* Levy Ward
* Pertobe Ward
* Proudfoot Ward
* Sherwood Ward
* Wollaston Ward

===Administration and governance===
The council meets in the council chambers at the council headquarters in the Warrnambool Civic Centre, which is also the location of the council&#x27;s administrative activities. It also provides customer services at its administrative centre in Warrnambool.

==Geography==
The city of Warrnambool is dominated by the Warrnambool urban area, which represents , or 29.0%, of the city&#x27;s area and at the 2006 census had a population of 28,150.

==Townships and localities==
The 2021 census, the city had a population of 35,406 up from 33,655 in the 2016 census

<text>The City of Wodonga is a local government area in the Hume region of Victoria, Australia, located in the north-east part of the state. It covers an area of and in August 2021, had a population of 43,253.

It is primarily urban with the vast majority of its population living in the Greater Wodonga urban area, while other significant settlements within the LGA include Bandiana and Bonegilla. Its floral and fauna emblems are pink heath and the Leadbeater&#x27;s possum respectively—the same as those of the state of Victoria. It is one of only a few regional councils in Victoria to remain serving just one urban district after the amalgamation process of 1994, although through that process it did gained some portions of the former shires of Chiltern and Yackandandah.

The city is governed and administered by the Wodonga City Council; its seat of local government and administrative centre is located at the council headquarters in Wodonga. The city is named after the main urban settlement located in the north-east of the LGA, that is Wodonga, which is also the LGA&#x27;s most populous urban centre with a population of 16,487. It provides governance for the Victorian part of the Albury-Wodonga urban area.

==History==
Wodonga was first surveyed in 1852 and proclaimed the town of Belvoir in the same year. In 1876 the Victorian colonial government granted a request from the people of the area for their district to be severed from the Shire of Yackandandah to form a new municipality, and on 10 March 1876, the Shire of Wodonga was incorporated. On 12 April 1911 it annexed a further part of Yackandandah, and on 30 March 1973, Wodonga was proclaimed a Rural City by the Governor of Victoria, Sir Rohan Delacombe.

The municipality survived widespread local government amalgamations in 1994, gaining the Baranduda and Barnawartha North districts from neighbouring shires. However, the councillors were dismissed on 18 November 1994, and replaced by commissioners Mel Read, a long-serving executive of the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation, Des Kelly, a Shire of Tallangatta councillor from 1968 until 1994, and Mike Hansen, a retired army officer with management and logistics experience. The commissioners decided in 1995 that, to give the city a fresh image, the term &quot;rural&quot; be dropped from use except when legally required. It has since been officially renamed to the City of Wodonga. The elected council was reinstituted in 1997.

==Council==

===Current composition===
The current council is composed of seven councillors elected to represent an unsubdivided municipality. The current councillors were elected on 23 October 2020, and were announced 6 November 2020. On 23 November 2020, the councillors elected Kevin Poulton as Mayor for a one-year term, with a unanimous decision to have no Deputy Mayor. In March 2022, Kat Bennett announced that she would be resigning from council, the vacancy was filled by a countback from the 2020 election, and Danny Lowe was elected to fill the position. In October 2022, John Watson tendered his resignation after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. A countback from the 2020 election was once again conducted, and Danny Chamberlain was elected. In December 2022, mayoral elections took place and the council elected new mayor, Ron Mildren.
====Former Wards and Structure====
Prior to 1994, Wodonga was composed of four wards and twelve councillors, with three councillors per ward elected to represent each of the following wards:
* Baranduda Ward
* Belvoir Ward
* Bonegilla Ward
* Greenhill Ward

The council was replaced with three commissioners on 18 November 1994, and at the 1997 inaugural elections of the new council, five councillors were elected to an unsubdivided municipality. Following the enactment of the Local Government (Democratic Reform) Act 2003 (Vic.), which amended the Local Government Act 1989, an independent review of Wodonga&#x27;s internal structure was commissioned and advertised on 13 May 2004 by the Victorian Government. The final report by the Victorian Electoral Commission, issued on 27 September 2004, recommended that the council be increased in size to seven elected members, noting that at the time of the report, Wodonga was the only city council with fewer than seven, and that the task of representing the diversity and issues of a growing regional city was complex. It recommended leaving the City unsubdivided as it had a single, dominant centre and a small area.

The council was restructured accordingly and elections held on 26 November 2005 returned seven councillors with Rodney Wangman as mayor and Brian Wicks as deputy mayor.
Elections in late November 2008 resulted in four of the sitting seven councillors losing their seats, and saw the City of Wodonga gain a new Mayor and Deputy-Mayor, Crs Mark Byatt and Angela Collins respectively.

===Administration and governance===
The council meets in the council chambers at the council headquarters in the Wodonga Municipal Offices, which is also the location of the council&#x27;s administrative activities. It also provides customer services at its administrative centre in Wodonga.

<doc id="493040" wikidata="Q2342127" url="?curid=493040" title="Emblemata">
<text>Usually known simply as the Emblemata, the first emblem book appeared in Augsburg (Germany) in 1531 under the title &quot;Viri Clarissimi D. Andreae Alciati Iurisconsultiss. Mediol. Ad D. Chonradum Peutingerum Augustanum, Iurisconsultum Emblematum Liber&quot;. Produced by the publisher Heinrich Steyner, the unauthorized first print edition was compiled from a manuscript of Latin poems which the Italian jurist Andrea Alciato had dedicated to his friend Conrad Peutinger and circulated to his acquaintances. The 1531 edition was soon followed by a 1534 edition authorized by Alciato: published in Paris by Christian Wechel, this appeared under the title &quot;Andreae Alciati Emblematum Libellus&quot; (&quot;Andrea Alciato&#x27;s Little Book of Emblems&quot;). The word &quot;emblemata&quot; is simply the plural of the Greek word &quot;emblema&quot;, meaning a piece of inlay or mosaic, or an ornament: in his preface to Peutinger, Alciato describes his emblems as a learned recreation, a pastime for humanists steeped in classical culture.

The &quot;Emblemata&quot; grew to include over 200 individual emblems and appeared in hundreds of editions, of which probably the best known is that published in Padua by Tozzi in 1621, the &quot;Emblemata Cum Commentariis Amplissimis&quot;. The &quot;very full commentaries&quot; to which the title refers were written by the French scholar Claude Mignault. Alciato&#x27;s work spawned thousands of imitations in all the European vernacular languages: secular, religious, or amorous in nature, emblem books were an integral part of European culture for two centuries.

The preface reads in part (translated):

&quot;While boys are entertained by nuts and youths by dice, so playing-cards fill up the time of lazy men. In the festive season we hammer out these emblems, made by the distinguished hand of craftsmen. Just as one affixes trimmings to clothes and badges to hats, so it behooves every one of us to write in silent marks. Though the supreme emperor may give to you, for you to own, precious coins and finest objects of the ancients, I myself shall give, one poet to another, paper gifts: take these, Konrad, the token of my love.&quot;

* &quot;Corvus pliocaenus&quot; – (fossil: Late Pliocene –? Early/Middle Pleistocene of Europe; possibly a subspecies of &quot;C. corone&quot;/&quot;cornix&quot;)
* &quot;Corvus antecorax&quot; – (fossil: Late Pliocene – Late Pleistocene of Europe; may be &quot;C. janossyi&quot;, possibly a subspecies of &quot;C. corax&quot;)
* &quot;Corvus bragai&quot; – (fossil: Pliocene/Pleistocene transition of South Africa)

* &quot;Corvus moriorum&quot; – Chatham raven (prehistoric: the Chatham Islands, the southwestern Pacific)
* &quot;Corvus pumilis&quot; – Puerto Rican crow (prehistoric: Puerto Rico; possibly a subspecies of &quot;C. nasicus&quot;/&quot;palmarum&quot;)
* &quot;Corvus viriosus&quot; – robust crow (prehistoric: Hawaii)
* &quot;Corvus&quot; sp. – New Ireland crow (prehistoric: New Ireland, Melanesia)

The taxonomy of the &quot;C. antecorax/C. fossilis&quot; complex as well as the &quot;C. pliocaenus/C. betfianus/C. praecorax/C. simionescui&quot;, in particular the temporal succession and relationship to the living relatives, is not yet fully resolved. At least some of these &quot;species&quot; seem to have been direct ancestors of the living forms as listed above.

==Former species==
Formerly, some authorities also considered the following species as species within the genus &quot;Corvus&quot;:
* Western jackdaw (as &quot;Corvus monedula&quot;)
* Daurian jackdaw (as &quot;Corvus dauuricus&quot;)
* Eurasian jay (as &quot;Corvus glandarius&quot;)
* northwestern crow (the Olympic Peninsula to southwestern Alaska). &quot;Corvus caurinus&quot; was once considered a separate species from &quot;Corvus brachyrhynchos&quot; (the American crow) but has since been merged into it due to genetic overlap and mating patterns.

<text>The Shire of Baw Baw () is a local government area in Victoria, Australia, in the eastern part of the state. It covers an area of and in 2021 had a population of 57,626.

It includes the towns of Drouin, Longwarry, Neerim South, Trafalgar, Warragul and Yarragon. It was formed in 1994 from the amalgamation of the Shire of Buln Buln, Shire of Narracan, Rural City of Warragul, and some parts of the Shire of Upper Yarra.

The shire is governed and administered by the Baw Baw Shire Council; its seat of local government and administrative centre is located at the council headquarters in Drouin, and it has a service centre located in Warragul. The shire is named after the major geographical feature in the region, the Baw Baw Plateau with Mount Baw Baw being the second highest peak in the region. An unincorporated area, the Mount Baw Baw Alpine Resort, is enclaved within the shire.

==Location and geography==
The more densely populated southern half of the shire consists of low rolling hills given over primarily to dairy farming and other agriculture. The northern half lies in the Great Dividing Range and its foothills, where forestry remains an important industry. Tourism is also important in the region, aided by its proximity to and easy access from Melbourne. The shire is known for its rural scenery and natural environment, as well as gourmet foods and wines. The historic gold-mining town of Walhalla is located in the northeast of the shire is a major tourist drawcard. The major electricity-producing region of the Latrobe Valley lies immediately to the shire&#x27;s east and south.

Many of the shire&#x27;s larger towns are located along the Princes Highway and Gippsland railway line, which cross the southern part of the shire. From west to east these include: Longwarry, Drouin, Warragul, Darnum, Yarragon, and Trafalgar. North of Warragul are Buln Buln, Neerim South, and Noojee, while south of Trafalgar in the Strzelecki Ranges lies the town of Thorpdale. The towns of Rawson, Erica, and Parkers Corner are located near Walhalla amongst the foothills of the Baw Baw Plateau. Aberfeldy is located in the far north east of the shire above the Thomson Dam, which supplies 50% of Melbourne&#x27;s water.

==Council==

===Composition up to November 2016===
The council was composed of four wards and nine councillors, with three councillors elected to represent the Warragul Ward and two councillors per remaining ward elected to represent each of the other wards.
===Composition November 2016 to November 2020===
The council was changed to a three-ward structure with three councillors per ward, with the new council sworn in on 2 November 2016. The new wards are West [660sq km] (primarily Drouin with some rural areas north/south), Central [66sq km] (Warragul town) and East [3,302sq km] making up the balance of the shire.
===Current composition===
The council&#x27;s three-ward structure continued with three councillors per ward, with the new council sworn in on 18 November 2020. The wards are West [660sq km] (primarily Drouin with some rural areas north/south), Central [66sq km] (based on Warragul) and East [3,302sq km] making up the balance of the shire.
===Administration and governance===
The council meets monthly in the Fountain Room of the West Gippsland Arts Centre. The council&#x27;s administrative activities are centred in Drouin in the former offices of the Buln Buln Shire. It also provides customer services at both Warragul and the council offices in Drouin. Service centres in Trafalgar and on Smith Street in Warragul were closed in 2015.

==Townships and localities==

<doc id="493057" wikidata="Q355125" url="?curid=493057" title="Harry Morgan">
<text>Harry Morgan (born Harry Bratsberg; April 10, 1915 – December 7, 2011) was an American actor whose television and film career spanned six decades. Morgan&#x27;s major roles included Pete Porter in both &quot;December Bride&quot; (1954–1959) and &quot;Pete and Gladys&quot; (1960–1962); Officer Bill Gannon on &quot;Dragnet&quot; (1967–1970); Amos Coogan on &quot;Hec Ramsey&quot; (1972–1974); and his starring role as Colonel Sherman T. Potter in &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; (1975–1983) and &quot;AfterMASH&quot; (1983–1985). Morgan also appeared as a supporting player in more than 100 films.

==Early life==
Morgan was born Harry Bratsberg in Detroit, the son of Hannah and Henry Bratsberg. His parents were of Swedish and Norwegian ancestry. In his interview with the Archive of American Television, Morgan spelled his Norwegian family surname as &quot;Brasburg&quot;. Many sources, however, including some family records, list the spelling as &quot;Bratsburg&quot;. According to one source, when Morgan&#x27;s father Henry registered at junior high school, &quot;the registrar spelled it Brasburg instead of Bratsberg. Bashful Henry did not demur.&quot;

Morgan was raised in Muskegon, Michigan, and graduated from Muskegon High School in 1933, where he achieved distinction as a statewide debating champion. He originally aspired to a J.D. degree, but began acting while a junior at the University of Chicago in 1935.

==Career==
He began acting on stage under his birth name, in 1937, joining the Group Theatre in New York City formed by Harold Clurman, Cheryl Crawford, and Lee Strasberg in 1931. He appeared in the original production of the Clifford Odets play &quot;Golden Boy&quot;, followed by a host of successful Broadway roles alongside such other Group members as Lee J. Cobb, Elia Kazan, John Garfield, Sanford Meisner, and Karl Malden. Morgan also did summer stock at the Pine Brook Country Club located in the countryside of Nichols, Connecticut.

===Film work===

Morgan made his screen debut (originally using the name &quot;Henry Morgan&quot;) in the 1942 movie &quot;To the Shores of Tripoli&quot;. His screen name later became &quot;Henry &#x27;Harry&#x27; Morgan&quot; and eventually Harry Morgan, to avoid confusion with the popular humorist of the same name.

In the same year, Morgan appeared in the movie &quot;Orchestra Wives&quot; as a young man pushing his way to the front of a ballroom crowd with his date to hear Glenn Miller&#x27;s band play. A few years later, still credited as Henry Morgan, he was cast in the role of pianist Chummy MacGregor in the 1954 biopic &quot;The Glenn Miller Story&quot;.

Morgan continued to play a number of significant roles on the big screen in such films as &quot;The Ox-Bow Incident&quot; (1943) with Henry Fonda, &quot;Wing and a Prayer&quot; (1944), &quot;A Bell for Adano&quot; (1945), &quot;State Fair&quot; (1945), &quot;Dragonwyck&quot; (1946) with Walter Huston, &quot;The Gangster&quot; (1947), &quot;The Big Clock&quot; (1948) with Charles Laughton, &quot;The Well&quot; (1951), &quot;High Noon&quot; (1952) with Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly, &quot;Torch Song&quot; (1953) with Joan Crawford, and several films in the 1950s for director Anthony Mann starring James Stewart, including &quot;Bend of the River&quot; (1952), &quot;Thunder Bay&quot; (1953), &quot;The Glenn Miller Story&quot; (1954), &quot;The Far Country&quot; (1955), and &quot;Strategic Air Command&quot; (1955). In his later film career, he appeared in &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot; (1960) with Spencer Tracy and Fredric March, &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; (1962) (as Ulysses S. Grant) with John Wayne, &quot;John Goldfarb, Please Come Home!&quot; (1965) with Peter Ustinov, &quot;Frankie and Johnny&quot; (1966) with Elvis Presley and Donna Douglas, &quot;The Flim-Flam Man&quot; (1967) with George C. Scott, &quot;Support Your Local Sheriff!&quot; (1969) with James Garner, &quot;Support Your Local Gunfighter&quot; (1971) also with James Garner, &quot;Snowball Express&quot; (1972) with Keenan Wynn, &quot;The Shootist&quot; (1976) with John Wayne and Lauren Bacall, &quot;The Wild Wild West Revisited&quot; (1979) with Robert Conrad, and as Captain Gannon in the theatrical film version of &quot;Dragnet&quot; (1987) with Dan Aykroyd and Tom Hanks.

===Radio and television===
Morgan hosted the NBC radio series &quot;Mystery in the Air&quot; starring Peter Lorre in 1947. On CBS, he played Pete Porter in &quot;Pete and Gladys&quot; (1960–1962), with Cara Williams as wife Gladys. &quot;Pete and Gladys&quot; was a spin-off of &quot;December Bride&quot; (1954–1959), starring Spring Byington, a show in which Morgan had a popular recurring role. In 1950, Morgan appeared as an obtrusive, alcohol-addled hotel clerk in the &quot;Dragnet&quot; radio episode &quot;The Big Boys&quot;.

===&quot;Dragnet&quot;===

After &quot;Pete and Gladys&quot; ended production, Morgan guest-starred in the role of Al Everett in the 1962 episode &quot;Like My Own Brother&quot; on Gene Kelly&#x27;s ABC drama series, &quot;Going My Way&quot;, loosely based on the 1944 Bing Crosby film of the same name. That same year, he played the mobster Bugs Moran in an episode of ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, with Robert Stack. In 1963, he was cast as Sheriff Ernie Backwater on Richard Boone&#x27;s &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot; Western series on CBS, then worked as a regular cast member on the 1963–64 anthology series &quot;The Richard Boone Show&quot;.

In the 1964–1965 season, Morgan co-starred as Seldom Jackson in the 26-week NBC comedy/drama &quot;Kentucky Jones&quot;, starring Dennis Weaver, formerly of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;.

Morgan is even more widely recognized as Officer Bill Gannon, Joe Friday&#x27;s partner in the revived version of &quot;Dragnet&quot; (1967–1970).

Morgan had also appeared with &quot;Dragnet&quot; star Jack Webb in three film noir movies, &quot;Dark City&quot; (1950), &quot;Appointment with Danger&quot; (1951) and &quot;Pete Kelly&#x27;s Blues&quot; (1955), and was an early regular member of Jack Webb&#x27;s stock company of actors on the original &quot;Dragnet&quot; radio show. Morgan later worked on two other shows for Webb: 1971&#x27;s &quot;The D.A.&quot; and the 1972–1974 Western series, &quot;Hec Ramsey.&quot; Morgan also appeared in four episodes of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; (&quot;The Witness&quot; – aired 11/23/1970, &quot;Milligan&quot; - aired 11/6/72, &quot;The Wiving&quot; - aired 10/14/1974 and &quot;Brides and Grooms&quot;, sequel to The Wiving - aired 2/10/1975).

Morgan appeared in the role of Inspector Richard Queen, uncle of Ellery Queen in the 1971 television film &quot;Ellery Queen: Don&#x27;t Look Behind You&quot;.

===&quot;M*A*S*H&quot;===
Morgan&#x27;s first appearance on &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; was in the show&#x27;s third season (1974–1975), when he played the mentally unbalanced Major General Bartford Hamilton Steele in &quot;The General Flipped at Dawn&quot;, which first aired on September 10, 1974.

The following season, Morgan joined the cast of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; as Colonel Sherman T. Potter. A fan of the sitcom, Morgan replaced McLean Stevenson, who left the show at the end of the previous season. Unlike Stevenson&#x27;s character Henry Blake, Potter was a career Army officer who was a firm yet good-humored, caring father figure to those under his command.

In 1980, Morgan won an Emmy Award for his performance on &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. When asked if he was a better actor after working with the show&#x27;s talented cast, Morgan responded, &quot;I don&#x27;t know about that, but it&#x27;s made me a better human being.&quot; After the end of the series, Morgan reprised the Potter role in a short-lived spinoff series, &quot;AfterMASH&quot;.

Morgan also appeared in several Disney movies throughout the decade, including &quot;The Barefoot Executive&quot;, &quot;Snowball Express&quot;, &quot;Charley and the Angel&quot;, &quot;The Apple Dumpling Gang&quot;, &quot;The Cat from Outer Space&quot; (opposite McLean Stevenson) and &quot;The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again&quot;.

===Later years===
In 1986, he co-starred with Hal Linden in &quot;Blacke&#x27;s Magic&quot;, a show about a magician who doubled as a detective solving unusual crimes. One season was made. Morgan&#x27;s character, Leonard Blacke, was a semiretired con artist.

In 1987, Morgan reprised his Bill Gannon character, now a captain, for a supporting role in another film version of &quot;Dragnet&quot;, a parody and homage to the original series written by and starring Dan Aykroyd and costarring Tom Hanks and Christopher Plummer.

In 1987–1988, Morgan starred in the one-season situation comedy series &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It with You&quot; as family patriarch Martin Vanderhof.

In the 1990s, Morgan starred alongside Walter Matthau in a series of television movies for CBS as Stoddard Bell, a judge who is an acquaintance/nemesis/partner of Matthau&#x27;s Harmon Cobb, an attorney (&quot;The Incident&quot;; &quot;An Incident in Baltimore&quot;, and &quot;Incident in a Small Town&quot;). He also lent his voice to an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; from season seven, where he once again played Bill Gannon; in the episode &quot;Mother Simpson&quot;, Gannon and Joe Friday (voiced by Harry Shearer) are FBI agents trying to track down Homer&#x27;s mother, who is a fugitive from justice.

Morgan also had a recurring role on &quot;3rd Rock from the Sun&quot; as Professor Suter, a colleague of Dick Solomon&#x27;s. Morgan directed episodes for several TV series, including two episodes of &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot;, two episodes of &quot;Hec Ramsey&quot;, and one episode of &quot;Adam-12&quot;. Morgan had a guest role on &quot;The Jeff Foxworthy Show&quot; as Raymond and a guest role on &quot;Grace Under Fire&quot; as Jean&#x27;s pot-smoking boyfriend.

In 2006, Morgan was inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

==Personal life==
Morgan&#x27;s first marriage was to Eileen Detchon from 1940 until her death in 1985. During Morgan&#x27;s time on &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, a photograph of Detchon regularly appeared on the desk of his character. A drawing of a horse, seen on the wall behind Potter&#x27;s desk, was drawn by Morgan&#x27;s grandson, Jeremy Morgan. In addition, Eileen was the name of the wife of Officer Bill Gannon on &quot;Dragnet&quot;. Morgan had four sons with his first wife: Christopher, Charles, Paul, and Daniel (who died in 1989).

He then married Barbara Bushman Quine (granddaughter of silent film star Francis X. Bushman) on December 17, 1986. The marriage lasted until his death. In July 1996, he was arrested on domestic battery charges for striking his wife Barbara which caused her to be admitted to the hospital. Though she was left &quot;bruised and bloodied,&quot; the case was later dismissed after Morgan attended court-ordered anger management and domestic violence counseling program.

Morgan had two siblings, Marguerite and Arnold (both deceased).

Morgan was close friends with bandleader Glenn Miller, whom he met while filming &quot;Orchestra Wives&quot; in 1942, until Miller&#x27;s disappearance two years later. Morgan was later cast in the 1954 movie about his friend, &quot;The Glenn Miller Story&quot;, playing Chummy MacGregor.

==Death==
Morgan died in his sleep on December 7, 2011, at the age of 96. His son, Charles, said he recently had been treated for pneumonia. His body was cremated and his remains were given to his family.

Following Morgan&#x27;s death, Mike Farrell, who played B.J. Hunnicutt opposite Morgan in &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, released a statement:

<text>The Shire of Colac Otway is a local government area in the Barwon South West region of Victoria, Australia, located in the south-western part of the state. It covers an area of and in June 2018 had a population of 21,503. It includes the towns of Apollo Bay, Beeac, Beech Forest, Birregurra, Colac, Cressy, Forrest, Johanna, Kennett River, Lavers Hill, Warrion and Wye River. It came into existence on 23 September 1994 through the amalgamation of the local government areas of City of Colac, Shire of Colac, part of the Shire of Otway and part of the Shire of Heytesbury.

The Shire is governed and administered by the Colac Otway Shire Council; its seat of local government and administrative centre is located at the council headquarters in Colac, it also has a service centre located in Apollo Bay. The Shire is named after the combination of the names for the former City of &quot;Colac&quot;, and Shires of &quot;Colac&quot; and &quot;Otway&quot;, from which the majority of the LGA was formed. The name Colac is used for both the main urban settlement and the lake, Lake Colac, which are located in the north-centre of the LGA. Colac is also the most populous urban centre in the LGA with a population of almost 12,000. The name Otways is used for the major geographical features located in the south of the LGA, which are The Otways and Cape Otway. Cape Otway was originally named by Lieutenant James Grant who was the commander of the vessel, the Lady Nelson. He named it after Captain William Otway who was one of the commissioners of the Transport Board, on 7 December 1800.

==History==
The Colac district is the traditional land for the Gulidjan people and was known as “Kolak” or “Kolakgnat” which means ‘belonging to sand’. The Gulidjan people are of the Easter Maar Nation.

The earliest European settlers arrived in the district in the 1830s and settled around Lake Colac.

<text>The Shire of Delatite was a local government area in Victoria, Australia, located in the north-east part of the state. It covered an area of and, at the , had a population of 21,553. It included the towns of Benalla and Mansfield, and was formed in 1994 from the amalgamation of the City of Benalla, Shire of Benalla, the then Shire of Mansfield and part of the Shire of Violet Town. In 2002 the shire was split into the Rural City of Benalla and Shire of Mansfield. This process has been cited as an example of successful de-amalgamation by residents of other councils who are unhappy with the forced mergers that affected almost all Victorian local government areas in 1994.

The Delatite Shire Council had its seat of local government and administrative centre in Benalla, with a service centre located in Mansfield. The Shire was named after the county of Delatite, most of which was included in the shire.

<doc id="493075" wikidata="Q15085" url="?curid=493075" title="Piedmontese language">
<text>Piedmontese ( ; autonym: or ; ) is a language spoken by some 2,000,000 people mostly in Piedmont, a region of Northwest Italy. Although considered by most linguists a separate language, in Italy it is often mistakenly regarded as an Italian dialect. It is linguistically included in the Gallo-Italic languages group of Northern Italy (with Lombard, Emilian, Ligurian and Romagnol), which would make it part of the wider western group of Romance languages, which also includes French, Arpitan, Occitan, and Catalan. It is spoken in the core of Piedmont, in northwestern Liguria (near Savona), and in Lombardy (some municipalities in the westernmost part of Lomellina near Pavia).

It has some support from the Piedmont regional government but is considered a dialect rather than a separate language by the Italian central government.

Due to the Italian diaspora Piedmontese has spread in the Argentinian Pampas, where many immigrants from Piedmont settled. The Piedmontese language is also spoken in some states of Brazil, along with the Venetian language.

== Literature ==
The first documents in the Piedmontese language were written in the 12th century, the &quot;&quot;, when it was extremely close to Occitan, dating from the 12th century, a document devoted to the education of the Knights Templar stationed in Piedmont.

During the Renaissance, the oldest Piedmontese literary work of secular character, are the works of Zan Zòrs Alion, poet of the duchy of Montferrat, the most famous work being the opera Jocunda.

In the 1500s and 1600s, there were several pastoral comedies with parts in Piedmontese.

In the Baroque period, &quot;El Cont Piolèt&quot;, a comedy by Giovan Battista Tan-na d&#x27;Entraive was published.

Literary Piedmontese developed in the 17th and 18th centuries, but it did not gain literary esteem comparable to that of French or Italian, other languages used in Piedmont. Nevertheless, literature in Piedmontese has never ceased to be produced: it includes poetry, theatre pieces, novels, and scientific work.

== History ==
The first documents in the Piedmontese language were written in the 12th century, the &quot;sermones subalpini&quot;, when it was extremely close to Occitan.

=== Current status ===
In 2004, Piedmontese was recognised as Piedmont&#x27;s regional language by the regional parliament, although the Italian government has not yet recognised it as such. In theory, it is now supposed to be taught to children in school, but this is happening only to a limited extent.

The last decade has seen the publication of learning materials for schoolchildren, as well as general-public magazines. Courses for people already outside the education system have also been developed. In spite of these advances, the current state of Piedmontese is quite grave, as over the last 150 years the number of people with a written active knowledge of the language has shrunk to about 2% of native speakers, according to a recent survey. On the other hand, the same survey showed Piedmontese is still spoken by over half the population, alongside Italian. Authoritative sources confirm this result, putting the figure between 2 million and 3 million speakers out of a population of 4.2 million people. Efforts to make it one of the official languages of the Turin 2006 Winter Olympics were unsuccessful.

== Regional variants ==

Piedmontese is divided into three major groups

* Western which include the dialects of Turin and Cuneo.
* Eastern which in turn is divided into south-eastern (Astigiano, Roero, Monregalese, High Montferrat, Langarolo, Alessandrino) and north-eastern (Low Montferrat, Biellese, Vercellese, Valsesiano).
* Canavese, spoken in the Canavese region in north-western Piedmont.

The variants can be detected in the variation of the accent and variation of words. It is sometimes difficult to understand a person that speaks a different Piedmontese from the one you are used to, as the words or accents are not the same.

=== Eastern and western group ===
The Eastern Piedmontese group is phonologically more innovative than its Western counterpart.

Words that in the West end in jt, jd or t in the East end in [dʒ] or [tʃ], for example Western , , and (milk, all and old) correspond to Eastern , and .

A typical Eastern feature is as an allophone of : at word end, at the end of verbal infinitives, as in &quot;to read&quot; and &quot;to be&quot; (Western , &quot;vs&quot;. Eastern , ) and in feminine plurals. Nevertheless, this development is also shared partially (in the case of the infinitive) by most Western dialects, including that of Turin, which is the most spoken dialect of Western Piedmontese and also of the whole language.

A morphological feature that sharply divides the East from the West is the indicative imperfect conjugation of irregular verbs. In the East, the suffix -ava/iva is used, while in the West, the corresponding suffix is -asìa/isìa. The groups are also distinguished by differing conjugations of the present simple of irregular verbs: , , (to give, to go, to stay).
== Phonology ==
=== Consonants ===

/v/ is realized as labio-velar w] between /a/ and /u/ and as w] or f] when in word-final position.

=== Vowels ===

Allophones of // are [] in stressed syllables and as when in unstressed position and at end of the word.

== Phonological process==
* Apocope, i.e., dropping of all of the unstressed vowels at word end, except /a/, which is usually centralized to [ɐ].
* Syncope i.e., weakening or dropping of unstressed pro-tonic and post-tonic vowels: /me&#x27;luŋ/ &gt; /mə&#x27;luŋ/ &gt; /m&#x27;luŋ/, same happens in French, and other Gallo-Romance languages. In some cases, prothesis of [ə] or [ɐ] is also present to make some consonant clusters easier to pronounce (ex. novod, &quot;nephew&quot; , [nʊˈvud] &gt; [nvud] &gt; [ɐnˈvud], this feature is also present in Emilian.
* Nasalization of vowels in front of /n/, as in Western Romance, and then shift of nasalization from the vowel to /n/ with development of the /ŋn/ cluster, and subsequent dropping of [n] (/&#x27;buna/&gt; /&#x27;bũna/&gt; /&#x27;buŋna/ &gt; /&#x27;buŋa/).
* Development of vowels /ø/ and /y/ from [ɔ] and [uː] of Latin, respectively.
* Consonantal degemination: SERRARE &gt; saré.
* Latin groups of occlusives [kt] and [gd] become [jd]-, as in Gallo-Romance: NOCTEM &gt; neuit [nøi̯d]; LACTEM &gt; làit [lɑi̯d]. Some dialects have reached the more advanced stage, with palatalization of [i̯d] to [d͡ʒ] (for example Vercelli dialect [nød͡ʒ] and [lad͡ʒ]), as happens in Spanish, Occitan, and Brazilian Portuguese.
* Palatization of [kl] and [gl] : Latin CLARUS &gt; ciàr [tʃɑi̯r], &quot;light&quot;, GLANDIA &gt; gianda [ˈdʒɑŋdɐ] &quot;nut&quot;.
* The Latin unvoiced occlusive /p/, /t/, /k/, are voiced (becoming /b/, /d/, /g/), and then lenited and usually drop: FORMICAM &gt; formìa; APRILEM &gt; avril, CATHÉDRA &gt; careja. 
* Latin /k/-/g/ before front vowels, became post-alveolar affricates /t͡ʃ/ and /d͡ʒ/, then /t͡s/ and /d͡z/ due to typical Western Romance assibilation, later /t͡s/ and /d͡z/ became fricatives: /s/ and /z/: CINERE &gt; sënner; CENTUM &gt; sent; GINGIVA &gt; zanziva.

== Alphabet ==
Piedmontese is written with a modified Latin alphabet. The letters, along with their IPA equivalent, are shown in the table below.


Certain digraphs are used to regularly represent specific sounds as shown below.

All other combinations of letters are pronounced as written. Grave accent marks stress (except for &quot;o&quot; which is marked by an acute to distinguish it from &quot;ò&quot;) and breaks diphthongs, so &quot;ua&quot; and &quot;uà&quot; are , but &quot;ùa&quot; is pronounced separately, .

== Numbers ==
== Characteristics ==
Some of the characteristics of the Piedmontese language are:

# The presence of clitic so-called verbal pronouns for subjects, which give a Piedmontese verbal complex the following form: (subject) + verbal pronoun + verb, as in &quot;(mi) i von&quot; &#x27;I go&#x27;. Verbal pronouns are absent only in the imperative form.
# The bound form of verbal pronouns, which can be connected to dative and locative particles (&quot;a-i é&quot; &#x27;there is&#x27;, &quot;i-j diso&quot; &#x27;I say to him&#x27;).
# The interrogative form, which adds an enclitic interrogative particle at the end of the verbal form (&quot;Veus-to…?&quot; &#x27;Do you want to...?&#x27;])
# The absence of ordinal numerals higher than &#x27;sixth&#x27;, so that &#x27;seventh&#x27; is &quot;col che a fà set&quot; &#x27;the one which makes seven&#x27;.
# The existence of three affirmative interjections (that is, three ways to say yes): &quot;si, sè&quot; (from Latin &quot;sic est&quot;, as in Italian); &quot;é&quot; (from Latin &quot;est&quot;, as in Portuguese); &quot;òj&quot; (from Latin &quot;hoc est&quot;, as in Occitan, or maybe &quot;hoc illud&quot;, as in Franco-Provençal, French and Old Catalan and Occitan).
# The absence of the voiceless postalveolar fricative (like the &quot;sh&quot; in English &quot;sheep&quot;), for which an alveolar S sound (as in English &quot;sun&quot;) is usually substituted.
# The existence of an S-C combination pronounced [stʃ].
# The existence of a velar nasal [ŋ] (like the &quot;ng&quot; in English &quot;going&quot;), which usually precedes a vowel, as in &quot;lun-a&quot; &#x27;moon&#x27;.
# The existence of the third Piedmontese vowel Ë, which is very short (close to the vowel in English &quot;sir&quot;).
# The absence of the phonological contrast that exists in Italian between short (single) and long (double) consonants, for example, Italian &quot;fata&quot; &#x27;fairy&#x27; and &quot;fatta&quot; &#x27;done (F)&#x27;.
# The existence of a prosthetic Ë sound when consonantal clusters arise that are not permitted by the phonological system. So &#x27;seven stars&#x27; is pronounced &quot;set ëstèile&quot; (cf. &quot;stèile&quot; &#x27;stars&#x27;).

Piedmontese has a number of varieties that may vary from its basic koiné to quite a large extent. Variation includes not only departures from the literary grammar, but also a wide variety in dictionary entries, as different regions maintain words of Frankish or Lombard origin, as well as differences in native Romance terminology. Words imported from various languages are also present, while more recent imports tend to come from France and from Italian.

=== Judeo-Piedmontese ===
A variety of Piedmontese was Judeo-Piedmontese, a dialect spoken by the Piedmontese Jews until the Second World War, when most were killed during the Holocaust. Some survivors knew the language but as of 2015, the language had gone extinct. It had many loanwards from Provencal, Spanish and Hebrew. It kept many conservative features that Piedmontese abandoned over time. The language never became as large in terms of words as larger Jewish languages like Yiddish, and it never developed a standardized writing system.

<doc id="493076" wikidata="Q664867" url="?curid=493076" title="Lingo (programming language)">
<text>Lingo is a verbose object-oriented (OO) scripting language developed by John H. Thompson for use in Adobe Director (formerly Macromedia Director). Lingo is used to develop desktop application software, interactive kiosks, CD-ROMs and Adobe Shockwave content.

Lingo is the primary programming language on the Adobe Shockwave platform, which dominated the interactive multimedia product market during the 1990s. Various graphic adventure games were developed with Lingo during the 1990s, including The Journeyman Project, Total Distortion, Mia&#x27;s Language Adventure, Mia&#x27;s Science Adventure, and the Didi &amp; Ditto series. Hundreds of free online video games were developed using Lingo, and published on websites such as Miniclip and Shockwave.com.

Lingo can be used to build user interfaces, to manipulate raster graphics, vector graphics and 3D computer graphics, and other data processing tasks. Lingo supports specialized syntax for image processing and 3D object manipulation. 3D meshes can also be created on the fly using Lingo.

==History==
Lingo was invented by John H. Thompson at MacroMind in 1989, and first released with Director 2.2. Jeff Tanner developed and tested Lingo for Director 2.2 and 3.0, created custom XObjects for various media device producers, language extension examples using XFactory including the XFactory application programming interface (API), and wrote the initial tutorials on how to use Lingo. Dave Shields tested and documented Object-based Lingo for Director 3.13 and 4.0. He ran build scripts to create weekly releases for testing, originated the Macromedia KnowledgeBase, created examples of how to write Lingo XTRA plug-ins in C++, and assembled the &quot;Golden Master&quot; disks of Macromedia Director that were shipped to the duplicator.

Lingo was quickly adopted by burgeoning multimedia community during the 1990s and the already popular Director product. Initially, about 90% of the users only used 10% of Lingo&#x27;s features; primarily codice_1 by multimedia authors of tutorials and presentations. However, 10% of the users were game developers who took a wider interest in the other 90% of its abilities, including their own function extensions by creating their own XFactories/XObjects. The Journeyman Project is a prominent example of this.

==Features==
Lingo is embedded into Adobe Director, and can be added as scripts on objects or on the timeline. Lingo is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, and supports Smalltalk-like verbose syntax, OO dot syntax, and inheritance.

===Verbose syntax===
When Lingo was created, a verbose syntax was designed to mimic spoken language, so it would be easy for new users. Users could write HyperTalk-like sentences such as:

 if the visibility of sprite 5 then go to the frame

In &quot;go to&quot; statements, the &quot;to&quot; is optional, and unlike other programming languages, &quot;go&quot; statements reference frames in Director&#x27;s Score, not specific code lines.

Lingo was also initially very robust by providing object generation through a notion called codice_2, which led to the language&#x27;s extensibility through External Factories (XFactories) or XObjects. For Director 3.13 and later versions, extensibility occurred via a different type of plug-in called an XTRA, based upon the Microsoft Component Object Model (COM).

===Dot syntax===
Although it is still possible to use the verbose syntax, the current version of the language fully supports OO dot syntax, so that the code looks more like standard programming languages such as JavaScript or C++.

The equivalent in new scripting style would be:

 if sprite(5).visible then _movie.go(_movie.frame)

This format uses elements of the Director Object Model, introduced in Director MX 2004. The syntax in prior versions would be like:

 if sprite(5).visible then go the frame
===Scripting===
There are 4 types of Lingo scripts in Director, each with a specific purpose. Each type of script may be added to certain types of compatible objects.

*&quot;Cast&quot; scripts work only with their member, not all events can be used with them.
*&quot;Behavior&quot; scripts are attached to a sprite or inserted into a frame. Sprite behaviors are often used to give control of the sprite&#x27;s properties and movement. Frame behaviors can be used to create a pause or delay within a certain frame in the score. Behaviors make it easy to program in an object-oriented way, as you can directly see the relationship between the programming and the item they are attached to. They can also control or interact with other sprites, making them a true object.
*&quot;Movie&quot; scripts are not attached to sprites nor can they be instantiated as Objects. They are available throughout the program (movie) and are especially useful for holding global handlers and initializing global variables at the start or end of the movie.
*&quot;Parent&quot; scripts are used to &quot;birth&quot; (create instances of) an object into a variable using the &quot;new&quot; command. These objects can control sprites and other media remotely, without being attached to any one sprite, may be used to control data or other non-displayed items, and are useful for recursion routines such as pathfinding. A Parent script can be used to create or destroy an object at any time, freeing them from the confines of the score that a Behavior is limited to.

Behavior and parent scripts encourage good object-oriented programming. Movie scripts are not as OOP-oriented. However, they can still be used to make &quot;black-box&quot; handlers, where other objects can input raw data and receive answers back, without knowing the inner workings of the box. Using the strengths and ease-of-use of Director&#x27;s programming methodology, with the advantages of OOP makes for a powerful and fast programming environment.

===Inheritance ===
Lingo supports object inheritance by a slightly idiosyncratic system: a script can have an codice_3 property which references another object (usually also a script, although other objects such as cast members can also be ancestors). Properties and methods of the ancestor are inherited by the parent. Behavior scripts are also a kind of ancestor of the sprites to which they are attached, since properties and methods of the behavior can be accessed by reference to the sprite itself. In this case, it is a kind of multiple inheritance, as one sprite may have several behaviors.

==Extensibility==

===XObjects===
Lingo 3.0 was also extensible through External Factories (XFactories) or XObjects (later replaced by Lingo Xtras), which provided programmatic extensions to Director. For example, controlling external media devices such as CD-ROM and Video tape players through Macintosh SerialPort. XObject API was openly available to developers and media device producers, which added to the popularity and versatility of Lingo. Macromind was very active in positioning the XObject API as standard for external media devices to collaborate through Lingo; and its interest as a standard achieved a lot of involvement from prominent and burgeoning media product companies through an ad hoc group called the Multimedia Association.

===Xtras===

Starting with Director version 4.0, Lingo was extensible through a new improved class of external plugin called Xtras. Xtras were developed in C++ using the Microsoft Component Object Model (COM). The standardization with COM helped attract developers to creating a market for such plug-ins.

===Imaging Lingo===
Imaging Lingo was introduced with Director 8.0, and allowed developers to write high-performance image manipulation commands using a simple syntax. There are some similarities to functions of image applications (like Photoshop), that make it easy to create dynamic, code-based visual effects. Image manipulation was also added into ActionScript 3.0 with the BitmapData class. As this included more sophisticated commands, Director was also updated to allow conversion between the BitmapData object and its own Image objects.

===3D===
Director 8.5 introduced a DirectX 3D engine that could be scripted with Lingo. Lingo was updated substantially to support the new 3D objects and now includes a full-featured set of 3D commands. An Xtra was also created to enable use of the Havok 3D Physics engine, and later the AGEIA PhysX engine, in Director 11.

==Other languages==
These other languages are perhaps not as well known as the Macromedia language. However, a legal anomaly remains in the UK that the trademark of the word &#x27;Lingo&#x27; is held by &quot;Linn Smart Computing&quot;.

* A language called Lingo was released for software development under Windows. This version was designed as a compilable high level programming language.
* A programming language based on Smalltalk was developed for the Rekursiv processor developed by Linn Smart Computing in Scotland, UK. This language was named Lingo and is significant because its makers successfully obtained a trademark in the UK.
* LINGO is also a programming language for solving linear, nonlinear and integer optimization problems, first developed in 1988 by LINDO Systems Inc. This language is still in production.

<doc id="493093" wikidata="Q750438" url="?curid=493093" title="Astral Media">
<text>Astral Media Inc. was a Canadian media conglomerate. It was Canada&#x27;s largest radio broadcaster, with 84 radio stations in eight provinces. Astral was also a major player in premium and specialty television in Canada, with 23 specialty channels and two conventional stations. In addition, Astral had a presence in out-of-home advertising.

In March 2012, Bell Media announced its intent to acquire Astral for $3.38 billion. Although an attempt to purchase the entirety of the company was blocked under competition law, the CRTC approved a revised offer on June 27, 2013, which saw various Astral specialty channels and radio stations divested to competitors. The sale was consummated on July 5, 2013. Astral was dissolved later the same year as a result of Bell Media completing its acquisition of the company. Bell Media assumed some of Astral&#x27;s television functions and absorbed some of its premium television services.

==History==

===Angreen Photo and Astral Photo===

Astral Media&#x27;s roots lie with Angreen Photo, a Canadian company founded in 1961. It was created when Montreal&#x27;s Greenberg brothers, led by Harold Greenberg, founded it to operate the photography concession in Miracle Mart, a department store chain. Its acquisition in 1963 of Bellevue Pathé led to photography rights at the Montreal Expo 67 World&#x27;s Fair, and it eventually grew into a 125-store chain, Astral Photo, the remnants of which are now owned by the Black&#x27;s Photography chain. The company grew quickly into motion picture processing after acquiring the Pathé-Humphries motion picture lab in 1968 and Associated Screen News Industries of Montreal in 1969.

===Astral Communications Limited===
The company was constituted in 1973 under the name Astral Bellevue Pathé Limited. It eventually undertook videocassette duplication and video wholesaling. The company also produced or executive produced over 100 feature films, television programs and television miniseries. The films were released by American Cinema Releasing. The company had operated such subsidiaries as Astral Films, Astral Film Productions Ltd. and Astral Video, as well as in 1987, a development consortium that was led by Harold Greenberg with funding from the CBC called the Centre De Production De Montreal, which is set for open in 1989.

In 1983, the Greenbergs acquired complete control of two pay television networks, First Choice (now known as The Movie Network) and Premier Choix TVEC (now Super Écran), at which point Astral ceased to be directly involved in film and program production. The company would later expand its television operations by launching new specialty networks. In addition, it became involved with the home video and feature film market, lasting from the mid-1980s until at least 1996. In 1987, Astral Film Enterprises had teamed up with Management Company Entertainment Group to produce three feature films by 1988, with the first film slated to be in the co-production pact was &quot;Boris and Natasha&quot;, &quot;Boardwalk&quot;, and &quot;Villa Golitsyn&quot;, which were proposed in the three-picture pact, but the projects, aside from &quot;Boris and Natasha&quot; were never realized. In 1996, Astral Communications decided to sell all of the program development and distribution divisions to Coscient Group. In February 2000, Astral Communications changed its name to Astral Media.
Astral then expanded into radio, beginning with the 2000 acquisition of Radiomutuel, and the 2002 purchase of most of the radio assets of Telemedia, although those companies&#x27; joint AM radio network Radiomedia was ultimately sold to Corus Entertainment for competitive reasons. Radiomutuel also owned a controlling share of outdoor advertising firm Omni Outdoor (which eventually became the fully owned Astral Out-of-Home division), as well as several French-language specialty channels such as Canal Vie, Ztélé, Séries+, VRAK.TV, and 50% stakes in MusiquePlus and MusiMax (then co-owned with CHUM Limited).

On February 23, 2007, Astral Media announced that it had signed a letter of intent and had entered into exclusive negotiations regarding the acquisition of &quot;substantially all of the assets&quot; of Standard Radio. A formal agreement was later announced, with the proposed transaction being approved by the CRTC on September 28, and completed on October 29 of the same year. The transaction gave Astral Media a significant foothold in English-language radio.
In 2010, Astral Media relocated its headquarters to 1800 McGill College Avenue, in a skyscraper rechristened Maison Astral. In May 2010, the company unveiled a new logo featuring a multi-coloured &quot;a&quot; insignia (reflecting ideals of &quot;collaboration&quot; and &quot;creativity&quot;). At this time, the company began to trade as simply &quot;Astral&quot;.

In the fall of 2011, Teletoon (co-owned with Corus Entertainment at the time) adopted a new logo to reflect Astral&#x27;s 50th anniversary.

===Acquisition by Bell Media===
On March 16, 2012, Astral Media announced that it had agreed to be acquired by Bell Canada through its Bell Media division for $3.38 billion. Astral Media shareholders approved the acquisition of all of its issued and outstanding shares by Bell Media on May 24, 2012; the acquisition of Astral Media&#x27;s issued and outstanding shares by Bell received approval by the Quebec Superior Court during a hearing on May 25, 2012.

The proposed sale faced opposition: a coalition of Cogeco, Vidéotron, and Eastlink argued that Bell&#x27;s market share following the merger would harm consumer choice, and that Bell would raise carriage fees for Astral&#x27;s channels (impacting smaller providers). During a CRTC&#x27;s hearing, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation argued that Bell&#x27;s proposal to use its mandatory tangible benefits to launch a French-language news channel (which would compete with its own Réseau de l&#x27;information) was &quot;self-serving and unprecedented.&quot; In September 2012, the Competition Bureau stated that it was becoming &quot;increasingly concerned&quot; about the implications of the merger, and warned that it could oppose the deal even if it were to be approved by the CRTC.

On October 18, 2012, the CRTC announced that it had rejected BCE&#x27;s proposal to acquire Astral Media. The commission cited that their combined market power could &quot;threaten the availability of diverse programming for Canadians and endanger the ability of distribution undertakings to deliver programming at affordable rates and on reasonable terms on multiple platforms&quot;, and also stated that allowing the merger would have required the implementation of &quot;extensive and intrusive safeguards&quot; across the entire broadcasting industry. The CRTC also felt that Bell did not adequately demonstrate how having most of Canada&#x27;s French-language media owned by two vertically integrated companies would improve competition, and how being bigger would allow it to compete against foreign services.

====Second attempt====
Following the rejection of the deal by the CRTC, Bell Canada CEO George A. Cope asserted that calling the merger dead was &quot;premature&quot;, citing that the formal merger agreement between Bell and Astral did not expire until December 16, 2012, and either company could extend it to January 15, 2013. Bell attempted to ask the Cabinet to overturn the CRTC&#x27;s decision, but was told that they did not have the ability to do so. Bell also reportedly considered going to the Federal Court of Appeal, or restructuring the deal to selectively sell Astral assets to competing companies. Rogers Media expressed interest in acquiring some of Astral&#x27;s channels if such a sale were to occur. On November 16, 2012, Astral confirmed that it was in talks with Bell to negotiate a new offer, which would involve the sale of the majority of its English-language television channels to third parties.

On March 4, 2013, the Competition Bureau approved a new proposal by Bell to acquire Astral Media, which would involve the divestiture of certain television channels and radio stations owned by the combined company, and was subject to restrictions preventing Bell from imposing restrictive bundling requirements on any provider seeking to carry The Movie Network or Super Écran. The CRTC made the proposed takeover proposal public on March 6, 2013. Unlike the previous deal, which would have given Bell a 42% share of the English-language television market, the new deal gave Bell a total market share of 35.7%, and increased its French-language market share to 22% (in comparison to 8% before). On March 18, 2013, the Competition Bureau cleared a proposed deal to sell Astral&#x27;s stakes in several channels to Corus Entertainment in preparation for regulatory approval.

In a speech to the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television prior to the hearings, Bell Media&#x27;s president Kevin Crull detailed plans to invest in French-language productions and maintain a distinct operation in Montreal devoted to its French-language outlets. Crull also praised the role of Québecor Média (despite the company being opposed to the merger) in using its own vertical integration strategy to help promote Francophone talent, and revealed his intention to try and emulate its &quot;star system&quot; in English Canada.

=====Hearings and approval=====
CRTC hearings on the new proposals began in May 2013. Asserting that it would have to sell or shut down the station without one, Bell organized a petition proposing an exception to the ownership cap that would allow it to maintain ownership of CKGM, under the condition that Bell maintain the TSN Radio format on the station and provide $245,000 in funding for local amateur sports and scholarships in sports journalism over a seven-year period. Commissioner Suzanne Lamarre commented that Bell could have sold another station instead, given most of the comments on Bell&#x27;s petition only supported CKGM maintaining a sports radio format, and not Bell&#x27;s purchase of Astral. In response, Bell&#x27;s CEO George A. Cope commented that the company did not want to sell off profitable radio stations, and Astral CEO Jacques Parisien remarked that breaking up its Montreal cluster would affect their operation.

Rogers called on the CRTC to require that Bell divest The Movie Network, claiming that Bell would make it harder and more expensive for competing service providers to access The Movie Network&#x27;s content (especially on its own Anyplace TV and on-demand services) if Bell were to own the service. Bell disputed Rogers&#x27; claims, stating that the company already had a long-term deal to distribute The Movie Network on its cablesystems, and noted that Rogers had expressed interest in purchasing the service if it were to be divested. Bell indicated that it would not go ahead with the deal if it were forced by the CRTC to sell additional media outlets. Rogers also showed interest in making a &quot;reasonable offer&quot; to purchase CKGM as a complement to its recently acquired TV station CJNT-DT. Under Rogers ownership, CKGM would have kept its sports talk format, but as a Sportsnet Radio station instead of TSN Radio.

On June 27, 2013, the CRTC approved Bell&#x27;s acquisition of Astral Media, which closed on July 5, 2013. The deal was subject to conditions, including the requirement for Bell to provide fair treatment to its competitors, to not impose &quot;restrictive bundling practices&quot; on Astral&#x27;s premium movie channels, invest $246.9 million over the next seven years on Canadian-produced programming, and to maintain the operation and local programming levels of all of its television stations through 2017. The CRTC also approved Bell&#x27;s proposed exemptions for maintaining ownership of CKGM.

===== Divestments =====
Following the approval of the new proposal by the Competition Bureau, Corus Entertainment reached a tentative deal to acquire 2 radio stations (CJOT, CKQB), along with Astral&#x27;s stakes in Historia, Séries+, and the Teletoon networks from Bell for just over $400 million. Corus acquired the stakes in Historia and Séries+ from Shaw Media as well. On January 1, 2014, the acquisition was completed. In 2017, Corus attempted to sell Historia and Séries+ to Bell for $200 million, but the deal was blocked and rejected by the Competition Bureau for violations of conditions forbidding Bell from re-acquiring divested Astral properties for ten years.

Bell Media also divested Family, Disney Junior&#x27;s English and French services, Disney XD, MusiMax, MusiquePlus, and 5 other radio stations in Toronto and Vancouver (CHBM-FM, CFXJ-FM, CKZZ-FM, CHHR-FM and CISL) at auction. These divested stations and channels were temporarily held in a blind trust by Pierre Boivin until the completion of their acquisitions.

On May 16, 2013, the Jim Pattison Group announced a deal to acquire three stations in Calgary and Winnipeg from Bell and Astral—CKCE-FM, CHIQ-FM, and CFQX, for an undisclosed amount. The deal expanded the Jim Pattison Group&#x27;s operations in Calgary (where it was planning to launch a new station, CHPK-FM), and gave the company its first stations in Manitoba. On August 26, 2013, Newcap Radio announced its intent to acquire the five aforementioned Toronto and Vancouver stations. Eventually, Newcap was in turn acquired by Stingray Digital Group in 2018.

On November 28, 2013, DHX Media announced that it had reached a deal to acquire Family Channel and its sister networks for $170 million, the deal was completed in late July 2014. On December 4, 2013, Remstar, owners of the French television system V, announced that it would acquire MusiquePlus and MusiMax for an undisclosed amount.

<doc id="493094" wikidata="Q7760881" url="?curid=493094" title="The Rise of Christianity">
<text>The Rise of Christianity (subtitled either &quot;A Sociologist Reconsiders History&quot; or &quot;How the Obscure, Marginal Jesus Movement Became the Dominant Religious Force in the Western World in a Few Centuries&quot;, depending on the edition), is a book by the sociologist Rodney Stark, which examines the rise of Christianity, from a small movement in Galilee and Judea at the time of Jesus to the majority religion of the Roman Empire a few centuries later.

==Summary==
Stark argues that contrary to popular belief, Christianity was not a movement of the lower classes and the oppressed but instead of the upper and middle classes in the cities and of Hellenized Jews. Stark also discusses the exponential nature of the growth of religion.

Stark points to a number of advantages that Christianity had over paganism to explain its growth:

*While others fled cities, Christians stayed in urban areas during plague, ministering and caring for the sick.
*Christian populations grew faster because of the prohibition of birth control, abortion and infanticide. Since infanticide tended to affect female newborns more frequently, early Christians had a more even sex ratio and therefore a higher percentage of childbearing women than pagans.
*To the same effect: Women were valued higher and allowed to participate in worship leading to a high rate of female converts.
*In a time of two epidemics (165 CE and 251 CE) which killed up to a third of the whole population of the Roman Empire each time, the Christian message of redemption through sacrifice offered a more satisfactory explanation of why bad things happen to innocent people. Further, the tighter social cohesion and mutual help made them able to better cope with the disasters, leaving them with fewer casualties than the general population. This would also be attractive to outsiders, who would want to convert. Lastly, the epidemics left many non-Christians with a reduced number of interpersonal bonds, making the forming of new ones both necessary and easier.
*Christians did not fight against their persecutors by open violence or guerrilla warfare but willingly went to their martyrdom while praying for their captors, which added credibility to their evangelism.

Stark&#x27;s basic thesis is that, ultimately, Christianity triumphed over paganism because it improved the quality of life of its adherents at that time.

==Reception==

&quot;Stark has produced a provocative, insightful, challenging account of the rise of Christianity. The thesis—that Christianity was a success because it provided those who joined it with a more appealing, more assuring, happier, and perhaps longer life—may anger many readers and force all readers to stop and think. It is a marvelous exercise in the sociological imagination and a warning to those who like simple explanations--such as that Constantine was ultimately responsible for the success of Christianity when he made it the official religion of the Roman Empire&quot; (Andrew M. Greeley, National Opinion Research Center, University of Chicago).

&quot;For years, biblical scholars and church historians have used sociological jargon to promote ideological views. Now an established sociologist has entered the fray with devastating results. This brilliant and highly provocative book will revolutionize the way people think about both biblical studies and church history. Love it or hate it, Rodney Stark&#x27;s &quot;The Rise of Christianity&quot; is a book nobody interested in the study of religion can ignore&quot; (Irving Hexham, University of Calgary).

==In the media==
This book prominently featured within the storyline of &quot;Hidden Empire&quot; by Orson Scott Card, according to the book&#x27;s afterword, and &quot;The Rise of Christianity&quot; even inspired the book&#x27;s plot.

<doc id="493102" wikidata="Q4681397" url="?curid=493102" title="Addressing scheme">
<text>There are three different addressing schemes for display devices: &quot;direct&quot;, &quot;matrix&quot;, and &quot;raster&quot;. The purpose of each scheme is to set (or maintain) the state of a pixel to either black/white or, more commonly, a grayscale level.

==Direct addressing==
A direct addressed display runs individual control signals to each pixel. This allows the state, whether on/off or grayscale, to be set and maintained on each pixel. For a screen size of &quot;m&quot;×&quot;n&quot; pixels, this scheme would require &quot;m&quot;×&quot;n&quot; control signals. This is generally considered to be an inefficient use of I/O and physical space.

==Matrix addressing==
A matrix addressed display runs control signals only to the rows (lines) and columns of the display. (See also: Display matrix) For a screen size of &quot;m&quot;×&quot;n&quot; pixels, this scheme requires &quot;m&quot;+&quot;n&quot; control signals. To address all pixels of such a display in the shortest time, either entire rows or entire columns have to be addressed sequentially. As many images are shown on a 16:9 aspect ratio, the sequential addressing is typically done row-by-row (i. e. line-by-line). In this case, fewer rows than columns have to be refreshed periodically. Passive matrix addressing is used with the help of persistence of vision of the (usually human) eye so the cell need not be bistable. Persistence of vision is used in simpler, slower changing displays with relatively few picture elements such as clocks. In active matrix addressing, some sort of capacitor (external to the cell proper) is used to maintain the state of the cell. When the electro-optical property of cells itself is bistable, passive matrix addressing 
without external capacitor can be implemented.

==Raster addressing==
A raster addressed display (e.g., a CRT) works by scanning across the entire display in sequence while modulating control signal to activate each pixel as it is scanned. This display uses persistence of the pixel element (e.g., phosphor) to maintain the pixel state until the scan can visit that pixel again. There are only three control signals required for this to work: a horizontal scan control signal, a vertical scan control signal, and an intensity control signal. Timing between these signals is very important, else the image on the screen will show artifacts.

<text>Glückstadt (; ) is a town in the Steinburg district of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. It is located on the right bank of the Lower Elbe at the confluence of the small Rhin river, about northwest of Altona. Glückstadt is part of the Hamburg Metropolitan Region (&quot;Metropolregion Hamburg&quot;). 
==History==

Glückstadt was founded in 1617 on the marsh lands along the Elbe by the Duke of Holstein, King Christian IV of Denmark, who had levees and fortifications built as well as a ducal residence. Its name translates to English literally as &quot;Luck City&quot; or &quot;Fortune City&quot;. As Christian IV promised the settlers tax exemption and freedom of religion, Glückstadt soon became an important trading centre, intended to compete with the Imperial city of Hamburg, located upstream on the Elbe. Calvinists, Remonstrants and Mennonites (Anabaptists) from the Netherlands settled here, as well as Sephardic Jews and Catholics.

After the king had interfered in the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the town in 1627/28 was besieged for fifteen weeks by the united Imperial and Catholic troops under the command of Albrecht von Wallenstein and Count Tilly, though without success.
In 1649 Christian’s son and successor King Frederik III of Denmark had the seat of the Holstein administration moved to Glückstadt, whereafter the duchy became known as Holstein-Glückstadt. In 1773 the town became the capital of all Holstein lands, when the lands of the Holstein-Gottorp line were finally incorporated. During the War of the Sixth Coalition in 1814 Glückstadt was blockaded by the allies and capitulated, whereupon its fortifications were demolished. In 1830 it was made a free port.

Holstein-Glückstadt remained a possession of the Danish Crown until its defeat in the Second Schleswig War of 1864. It was occupied by Austria, but finally incorporated into the Prussian Province of Schleswig-Holstein in the aftermath of the 1866 Austro-Prussian War.

==Transport==
In 1845, Glückstadt station opened on the Marsh Railway line from Elmshorn, which in 1857 was continued to Itzehoe. Today trains run from Hamburg-Altona station to Westerland on Sylt island. Glückstadt also has a ferry service across the Elbe to Wischhafen in Lower Saxony. It is a stop on the Deutsche Fährstraße theme road and the Elbe Cycle Route.

Lake Pedder, once a glacial outwash lake, is a man-made impoundment and diversion lake located in South West Tasmania, Australia. In addition to its natural catchment from the Frankland Range, the lake is formed by the 1972 damming of the Serpentine and Huon rivers by the Hydro-Electric Commission for the purpose of hydroelectric power generation. Consequently, the lake is also known, somewhat derisively, as the Huon-Serpentine Impoundment.

As a result, the flooded Lake Pedder now has a surface area of approximately , making it Tasmania&#x27;s second largest lake.

==The original and modified lake==
In early 20th century the original lake was named after John Pedder, the first Chief Justice of Tasmania. The new artificial impoundment received the official name of the original lake. Although the new Lake Pedder incorporates the original lake, it does not resemble it in size, appearance or ecology.

The new lake consists of an impoundment contained by three dams:
* Serpentine Dam – a high rockfill dam with a concrete upstream face on the Serpentine River.
* Scotts Peak Dam – a high rockfill dam with a bitumen upstream face on the upper reaches of the Huon River near Scotts Peak.
* Edgar Dam – a high rockfill dam at Lake Edgar near Scotts Peak.

The dams were designed and constructed by Tasmania&#x27;s Hydro Electric Commission (HEC) as part of the Upper Gordon River hydro-electric generation scheme. The aim of this scheme was to increase Tasmania&#x27;s capacity to generate hydro-electricity in accordance with the Tasmanian Government&#x27;s policy of attempting to attract secondary industry to the State with the incentive of cheap renewable energy.

The new Huon Serpentine impoundment, which filled after the dams were completed in 1972, drains into Lake Gordon via the McPartlan Pass Canal. Together, the lakes form the biggest water catchment and storage system in Australia.

==Climate==
Lake Pedder has an oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb).

==Damming==
There were protests in Tasmania and mainland Australia at the flooding of the original lake, before, during and after construction of the dams. Protests began when in 1967 the Tasmanian Government revoked the status of the Lake Pedder National Park that had protected the lake since 1955. The role of the HEC as a surrogate wing of the Tasmanian government was perceived when the political or wider social dissent against the HEC power over the Tasmanian environment seemed impregnable. Tasmania&#x27;s political leader, Premier Eric Reece and Allan Knight, the HEC Commissioner, were seen as the leading proponents of the &#x27;damming&#x27; of Tasmania against any opinion to the contrary, and were not averse to taking their opinions to statewide and national advertising campaigns asserting their right to dam the lake.

Reece was well known for his staunch support of the HEC and its power development schemes on the Gordon River, which earned him the nickname &quot;Electric Eric&quot;. In 1972, Reece approved the flooding of Lake Pedder, which proceeded despite a determined protest movement and a blank cheque offer from Prime Minister Gough Whitlam to preserve the Lake Pedder area. Reece refused Whitlam&#x27;s offer, stating that he would &quot;not have the Federal Government interfering with the sovereign rights of Tasmania&quot;.

A series of photographs in the 1976 Tasmanian Year book illustrated the process of flooding of the Lake Pedder area.

==Community response==
Opposition to the flooding of Lake Pedder extended well beyond Tasmania and spread throughout Australia and internationally. The focus on the South West Tasmania Wilderness area as an environmental battleground increased interest in the area, and many travelled to Lake Pedder before it was flooded to see what the issues were about.

In 1971, a large number of people travelled to Pedder to see the lake before it was to be inundated, and a particular weekend in March of that year became known as the &quot;Pedder Pilgrimage&quot; due to the large number of people present.

The protests included the United Tasmania Group who were the precursor to the Tasmanian Greens and are now recognised as the world&#x27;s first green party. The group that preceded the Tasmanian Wilderness Society – the South West Tasmania Action Committee continued after the flooding, with the knowledge that surveying and appraising other catchments in the south west and west of Tasmania was well underway by the HEC. Although increasingly sophisticated economic, environmental and engineering arguments were raised by the opponents of the dam, it was not until the Franklin scheme that either the Hydro or its defenders were even considering the critiques. In 1972, the Christian activist Brenda Hean perished with pilot Max Price in a tiger moth aircraft they were flying from Tasmania to Canberra to protest the damming of Lake Pedder; it was alleged that pro-dam campaigners had entered the plane&#x27;s hangar and placed sugar in one of its fuel tanks.

Hesba Fay Brinsmead, an Australian children&#x27;s author and environmentalist, wrote two books about the damming of Lake Pedder:
* &quot;Echo in the Wilderness&quot; is a children&#x27;s novel set on Lake Pedder on the eve of its flooding (published 1972)
* &quot;I Will Not Say the Day Is Done&quot; (her only non-fiction/adult book) describes the struggle to save Lake Pedder (published 1983)

Concerns over the construction of the dam revolved around the loss of the distinctive pink quartzite beach of the original lake, and an increased understanding of the unique nature of the wilderness quality to the south west of Tasmania. This developed further with the Franklin Dam issue.

In 1994, a campaign group was launched called Pedder 2000. They proposed, unsuccessfully, the draining and restoration of the lake to its original state. There is an ongoing low-key campaign with the same goal by the group known as the Lake Pedder Action Committee which remains active.

==A controversial and contested name==
As is the case in many land use, land ownership and territorial disputes, the name currently officially assigned to this body of water has considerable significance. It is also important in terms of understanding the technical status of the body of water as a component of a hydro-electric scheme.

From a technical, hydro-electric scheme point of view, the current Lake Pedder can be correctly termed a lake or reservoir as the water from Lake Pedder can flow into Lake Gordon via the McPartlan&#x27;s Pass canal and is thereby connected to the Gordon power station. However, people opposed to the flooding of the original lake do not accept the legitimacy of the official, gazetted name of Lake Pedder for the body of water that drowned it in 1972. Instead, they prefer to use the name Huon–Serpentine Impoundment. This name denotes the two major rivers dammed to create the current lake (Huon and Serpentine) and describes the technical status of the lake as an element of a hydro-electric scheme (impoundment) more accurately than the terms lake or reservoir. Bushwalkers sometimes informally refer to it as &quot;Fake Pedder&quot;.

==Lake Pedder extinctions==
The Lake Pedder earthworm (&quot;Hypolimnus pedderensis&quot;) is only known by the type specimen collected from a beach on Lake Pedder, Tasmania in 1971. After the flooding of the lake, this invertebrate was never seen again. A 1996 survey that sought to determine whether the species still existed in the area failed to find any examples. Since 2003 the Lake Pedder Earthworm has been listed as extinct on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

An extinction claimed to have occurred after the flooding is that of the Lake Pedder planarian (&quot;Romankenkius pedderensis&quot;), an endemic flatworm. Since 1996 this invertebrate has also been listed as extinct on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. In 2012, the continued existence of this species was reported.

The Pedder galaxias, an Australian freshwater fish, is considered extinct in its natural habitat of Lake Pedder and its tributaries, although it still exists in captivity and in two translocated populations, one at Lake Oberon in the Western Arthurs mountain range and the other at a modified water supply dam near Strathgordon.

==Restoration Campaign==
To coincide with the United Nations Decade of Ecological Restoration, 2021–2030, the Lake Pedder Restoration Committee is aiming to have the lake restored to its original state. The committee, convened by Christine Milne with support from Todd Dudley, Bob Brown, Paul Thomas and Tabatha Badger, plans to have an Ecological Management Plan to restore the original Lake Pedder and surrounding iconic ecosystems.

<doc id="493118" wikidata="Q273789" url="?curid=493118" title="Counties of Lithuania">
<text>The territory of Lithuania is divided into 10 counties (Lithuanian: singular &quot;apskritis&quot;, plural &quot;apskritys&quot;), all named after their capitals. The counties are divided into 60 municipalities (Lithuanian: singular &quot;savivaldybė&quot;, plural &quot;savivaldybės&quot;): 9 city municipalities, 43 district municipalities and 8 municipalities. Each municipality is then divided into elderates (Lithuanian: singular &quot;seniūnija&quot;, plural &quot;seniūnijos&quot;). This division was created in 1994 and slightly modified in 2000. 

Until 2010, the counties were administered by county governors (Lithuanian: singular – &quot;apskrities viršininkas&quot;, plural – &quot;apskrities viršininkai&quot;) appointed by the central government in Vilnius. Their primary duty was to ensure that the municipalities obey the laws and the Constitution of Lithuania. They did not have great powers vested in them, and so it was suggested that 10 counties are too much for Lithuania as the two smallest counties administer only four municipalities. Therefore, on 1 July 2010, the county administrations were abolished, but the counties themselves are retained for statistical and reporting purposes.

Modern &quot;apskritys&quot; should not be confused with &quot;apskritys&quot; that existed in the independent Lithuania during the interwar period. At that time Lithuania had a two-tier administrative division: &quot;apskritys&quot; that were subdivided into &quot;valsčiai.&quot; Modern &quot;apskritys&quot; remain only a territorial and statistical unit, while the top-tier administrative division are the municipalities (&quot;savivaldybės&quot;), followed by elderships (&quot;seniūnijos&quot;), and sub-elderships in some areas (&quot;seniūnaitijos&quot;). See subdivisions of Lithuania for details.

<doc id="493120" wikidata="Q1859063" url="?curid=493120" title="Magnolia virginiana">
<text>Magnolia virginiana, most commonly known as sweetbay magnolia, or merely sweetbay (also laurel magnolia, swampbay, swamp magnolia, white bay, or beaver tree), is a member of the magnolia family, Magnoliaceae. It was the first magnolia to be scientifically described under modern rules of botanical nomenclature, and is the type species of the genus &quot;Magnolia&quot;; as &quot;Magnolia&quot; is also the type genus of all flowering plants (magnoliophytes), this species in a sense typifies all flowering plants.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Magnolia virginiana&quot; was one of the many species described by Carl Linnaeus.

==Description==
&quot;Magnolia virginiana&quot; is an evergreen or deciduous tree to 30 m (100 ft) tall, native to the lowlands and swamps of the Atlantic coastal plain of the eastern United States, from Florida to Long Island, New York with a disjunct native population found on Cape Ann in northeastern Massachusetts. Whether it is deciduous or evergreen depends on climate; it is evergreen in areas with milder winters in the south of its range (zone 7 southward), and is semi-evergreen or deciduous further north. The leaves are alternate, simple (not lobed or pinnate), with entire margins, 6–12 cm long, and 3–5 cm wide. The bark is smooth and gray, with the inner bark mildly scented, the scent reminiscent of the bay laurel spice.

The flowers, which appear in late spring or early summer, are creamy white, 8–14 cm diameter, with 6-15 petal-like tepals. The flowers carry a very strong vanilla scent that can sometimes be noticed several hundred yards away. The fruit is a fused aggregate of follicles, 3–5 cm long, pinkish-red when mature (in early fall), with the follicles splitting open to release the 1 cm long seeds. The seeds are black but covered by a thinly fleshy red coat, which is attractive to some fruit-eating birds; these swallow the seeds, digest the red coating, and disperse the seeds in their droppings.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Magnolia virginiana&quot; is often grown as an ornamental tree in gardens, and used in horticultural applications to give an architectural feel to landscape designs. It is an attractive tree for parks and large gardens, grown for its large, conspicuous, scented flowers, for its clean, attractive foliage, and for its fast growth. In warmer areas &quot;Magnolia virginiana&quot; is valued for its evergreen foliage.

The English botanist and missionary John Banister collected &quot;Magnolia virginiana&quot; in the southeastern United States in 1678 and sent it to England, where it flowered for Bishop Henry Compton. This species was the first magnolia to be cultivated in England, although it was soon overshadowed by the evergreen, larger-flowered southern magnolia (&quot;M. grandiflora&quot;)

The sweetbay magnolia has been hybridized horticulturally with a number of species within subgenus &quot;Magnolia&quot;. These species include &quot;M. globosa&quot;, &quot;M. grandiflora&quot;, &quot;M. insignis&quot;, &quot;M. macrophylla&quot;, &quot;M. obovata&quot;, &quot;M. sieboldii&quot; and &quot;M. tripetala&quot;.

<doc id="493126" wikidata="Q7753007" url="?curid=493126" title="The Nairobi Trio">
<text>The Nairobi Trio was a sketch comedy skit that Ernie Kovacs performed many times for his TV shows. It combined several existing concepts and visuals in a novel and creative way.

People in gorilla suits had long been a comedy staple. The ploy of well-known, predictable music pieces gone awry had been practiced by artists as diverse as Stan Freberg, Spike Jones, and P. D. Q. Bach. The &quot;slow burn&quot; of one character being annoyed by another, resulting in eventual retaliation, was not new. But the combination of all of those ingredients, combined with impeccable timing, produced a unique and memorable result.

==Origins==

The skit was a live-action version of a child&#x27;s animatronic wind-up music box, performed to the tune &quot;Solfeggio&quot; by Robert Maxwell. According to an interview with Edie Adams in John Barbour&#x27;s 1982 documentary &quot;Ernie Kovacs: Television&#x27;s Original Genius&quot;, Barry Shear, Kovacs&#x27;s director at DuMont Television Network, brought the tune to Kovacs&#x27;s attention in 1954.

==The theme song==
Harpist and songwriter Robert Maxwell had recorded &quot;Solfeggio&quot; himself in 1953. The lyrics, sung by The Ray Charles Singers, were simply the notes of the musical scale as the melody progressed (&quot;Mi-sol-la, re-fa-re-sol...&quot;). When Ernie Kovacs heard the Maxwell record, he immediately came up with a mental image of what would become The Nairobi Trio:

&quot;Solfeggio&quot; became the permanent theme song for the sketch. The Nairobi Trio became so popular that M-G-M Records reissued the Maxwell record of &quot;Solfeggio&quot; as &quot;Song of the Nairobi Trio&quot; in 1957. Composer Maxwell recorded a new, lyrics-free version of the melody, now known as &quot;Song of the Nairobi Trio,&quot; in 1961, billing his ensemble as &quot;The Fortune Tellers.&quot; In 1966, as &quot;Robert Maxwell, His Harp and Orchestra,&quot; he recorded yet a third arrangement of the melody.

==Cast members and skit scenarios==

Of the three gorillas shown, all wearing hats, long coats, and white gloves, the middle gorilla, always played by Kovacs with a cigar, conducted the musicians with either a baton or a banana. To the viewer&#x27;s left stood a gorilla holding two oversized timpani mallets. The identity of this ape varied, but among Kovacs&#x27;s celebrity friends both Jack Lemmon and Frank Sinatra are known to have performed the character. Seated at a piano at screen right was a female simian, variously played by Barbara Loden, Jolene Brand, and Kovacs&#x27;s wife, Edie Adams, who robotically thumped her hands up and down on the keys.

Nearly all of the Nairobi Trio skits operated in the same fashion. As &quot;Solfeggio&quot; plays, the gorilla with the mallets repeatedly uses the center gorilla&#x27;s (Kovacs&#x27;s) head like a drum at the end of every phrase, punctuating the song&#x27;s sharp &quot;ba-da-BUM&quot; bongo riff. Every time this happens it brings a slightly changed and escalating response from the victim, who eventually tries to anticipate the mallet assaults and outwit the perpetrator. Ultimately staring him down, Kovacs, in the gorilla suit, is eventually distracted by the third gorilla, which allows the drummer to give him three final blows. The victimized gorilla then stands up and smashes a prop vase over the percussionist&#x27;s head. The sketch was repeated many times over the course of Kovacs&#x27;s career. The audio was always &quot;Solfeggio&quot; but the staging changed occasionally; one variation had the first and second gorillas handling building blocks in tempo, with the third gorilla pounding at a xylophone.

Edie Adams later said that the skits were simple enough for any one of Kovacs&#x27;s friends and associates to step into the drummer&#x27;s role without needing a rehearsal, and that the gorilla masks provided anonymity.

The last time the routine was performed was on one of Kovacs&#x27;s 1960s ABC specials shortly before his untimely death. On this occasion the combination of a bigger budget, the use of videotape, and the luxury of retakes helped him to perfect the timing of the sketch. But the Nairobi Trio wasn&#x27;t always confined to silence with &quot;Solfeggio&quot; playing; they went into outer space and also became safe crackers on a US Steel special, &quot;Private Eye, Private Eye&quot;, which aired on CBS on March 8, 1961.

==In popular culture==
* A popular New Zealand jazz group adopted the name, as did a radio-played Los Angeles jazz group. 
* The music video for the Harry Nilsson song &quot;Coconut&quot; features a similar arrangement as the trio. The instrumental cover band Hot Butter includes a Moog synthesizer version of &quot;Solfeggio&quot; in its 1972 album &quot;Popcorn&quot; (Musicor MS-3242; 1972). On the album, the song is retitled &quot;Song of the Narobi Trio&quot; with &quot;Nairobi&quot; having the variant spelling of &quot;Narobi&quot;.
*Jim Knipfel entitled the second volume of his memoirs &quot;Quitting The Nairobi Trio&quot;, recounting his time in a mental institution.
*From the early 60s to the late 70s, commercials for Colt 45 Malt Liquor used music resembling &quot;Solfeggio&quot; as Billy Van patiently sat at a small table waiting for a server to bring him a can of Colt 45. One of these commercials won a Clio Award in 1975.

<text>The Surf Coast Shire is a local government area in the Barwon South West region of Victoria, Australia, located in the south-western part of the state. It covers an area of . It had a population of 32,251 in June 2018. It includes the towns of Aireys Inlet, Anglesea, Lorne, Moriac, Torquay and Winchelsea. It was formed in 1994 from the amalgamation of the Shire of Winchelsea, Shire of Barrabool and part of the former City of South Barwon, which was, at that point, part of the City of Greater Geelong.

The Shire is governed and administered by the Surf Coast Shire Council; its seat of local government and administrative centre is located at the council headquarters in Torquay. The Shire is named after its location on the popular surf coast of Victoria.

Post-2008, following an electoral representation review, the decision was made to re-subdivide the municipality into four wards, the current wards are Torquay, Anglesea, Winchelsea and Lorne. Between 2004 and 2008, the Shire was an unsubdivided municipality and as a result, the entire municipality voted to elect nine councillors. Between 1996 and 2004, the municipality was subdivided into six wards, where three councillors per ward were elected from the Torquay and Anglesea wards, and one councillor per ward was elected from the Lorne, Winchelsea, Moriac and Aireys Inlet wards. A position of Deputy Mayor was created in 2004, but it was abolished for the 2005 mayoral election.

<text>Warwick Ashley Davis ( ; born 3 February 1970) is a British actor and television presenter. Active within the industry since he was eleven, Davis is one of the highest grossing supporting actors of all time and has the highest average gross revenue of all time. He played the title character in &quot;Willow&quot; (1988) and the &quot;Leprechaun&quot; film series (1993–2003); several characters in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; film series (1983–2024), most notably Wicket the Ewok; and Professor Filius Flitwick and the goblin Griphook in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series (2001–2011).

Davis starred as a fictionalised version of himself in the sitcom &quot;Life&#x27;s Too Short&quot; (2011–2013). He has also presented the ITV game shows &quot;Celebrity Squares&quot; (2014–2015) and &quot;Tenable&quot; (2016–present). In February 2025 Davis was awarded a BAFTA Fellowship.

== Early life ==
Davis was born on 3 February 1970 in Epsom, Surrey, the son of Susan J. ( Pain) and Ashley Davis, an insurance worker. He has a younger sister. He was educated at Chinthurst School in Tadworth, Surrey and later the City of London Freemen&#x27;s School.

Davis was born with spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, a rare bone growth disorder that results in dwarfism. When Davis was 11, his grandmother heard a radio item about an advert at Borehamwood Jobcentre calling for people who were tall or shorter to be in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. As a &quot;Star Wars&quot; fan, this was a dream come true for Davis. During the filming of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, Mark Hamill bought Davis every &quot;Star Wars&quot; action figure that he did not already own.

== Career ==
=== Acting ===

Davis was originally cast as an extra Ewok, but when Kenny Baker, who was originally going to be Wicket, fell ill, George Lucas picked Davis to be the new Wicket after seeing how he carried himself as an Ewok.

Davis based his Ewok movements on his dog, who tilted his head from side to side whenever he saw something strange. During production on the film, Davis was the subject of a short mockumentary film about his experience as Wicket, titled &quot;Return of the Ewok&quot;, made by &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;″s first assistant director, David Tomblin. The unreleased film was a fictional look at his decision to become an actor and act in the film and his transformation into Wicket the Ewok. Davis reprised his role as Wicket in the ABC made-for-TV films &quot;Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure&quot; and &quot;&quot;. 

In 1987, Davis was called to Elstree Studios near London to meet with Ron Howard and George Lucas to discuss a new film project called &quot;Willow&quot;, which was written with Davis specifically in mind. &quot;Willow&quot; was his first opportunity to act with his face visible. He co-starred with Val Kilmer in the film, which received a Royal Premiere before the Prince and Princess of Wales. He then moved to television to be in the BBC Television adaptation of the classic &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, specifically in &quot;Prince Caspian&quot;, &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot; (as Reepicheep), and &quot;The Silver Chair&quot; (as Glimfeather) and an episode of &quot;Zorro&quot; filmed in Madrid. In 1993, he played the villainous Irish lead character in &quot;Leprechaun&quot;, opposite Jennifer Aniston, a role he reprised in five sequels, from 1994 to 2003. He also played a leprechaun in the 1998 family film &quot;A Very Unlucky Leprechaun&quot;. Davis returned to the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe, playing four roles in &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;: Weazel, a gambler sitting next to Watto at the Podrace; Wald, who was Anakin&#x27;s Rodian friend, Yoda in some scenes where Yoda was seen walking, and finally, a street trader seen walking around the streets of the city of Mos Espa.

Davis played the role of Professor Filius Flitwick in the Harry Potter film series. In addition to playing Flitwick, Davis played the role of the goblin Griphook in &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot;, despite the role being played previously by Verne Troyer.

In 2004, Davis played the character &quot;Plates&quot; in the indie film &quot;Skinned Deep&quot;, directed by special effects artist Gabriel Bartalos. In 2006, Davis appeared, alongside fellow &quot;Harry Potter&quot; star Daniel Radcliffe, in an episode of BBC&#x27;s comedy series &quot;Extras&quot; as a satirical version of himself. Davis starred in the film version of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, as the &quot;body&quot; of Marvin the Paranoid Android (the voice was provided by Alan Rickman). In December 2006, Davis starred in the pantomime &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarves&quot; at the Opera House, Manchester, and again in 2007–08 at the New Wimbledon Theatre. 

Davis appeared in &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian&quot;, in which he played Nikabrik the Dwarf, adding to his previous involvement in TV adaptations of the &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot; series. He also appeared as a contestant on the 2007 series of Children in Need reality show &quot;Celebrity Scissorhands&quot;. Davis starred as a fictional version of himself in &quot;Life&#x27;s Too Short&quot;, written by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, who also starred. In December 2012, Davis returned to New Wimbledon Theatre to reprise his role in &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;.
Davis also appeared in the 2008 TV series &quot;Merlin&quot; as the character Grettir, the gatekeeper to the &quot;lands of king fisher&quot; in the episode &quot;The Eye of the Phoenix&quot; in Series 3.

In March 2013, Davis presented an episode of the ITV series &quot;Perspectives&quot;: &quot;Warwick Davis – The Seven Dwarfs of Auschwitz&quot;, in which he explored the story of the Ovitz family, a touring musical troupe which included seven dwarfs who survived the Nazi Auschwitz concentration camp and the experiments of Josef Mengele.

Davis appeared as the character Porridge in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;Nightmare in Silver&quot;, first broadcast in May 2013.

In late 2013, Davis appeared for one month as Patsy in the musical comedy &quot;Spamalot&quot;, based on the film &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; in London. At the same time, Davis hosted a press conference to announce the Monty Python reunion.

In 2014, Davis hosted a factual series for ITV called &quot;Weekend Escapes with Warwick Davis&quot;. The show saw Davis and his family travelling around Britain, enjoying short weekend holiday breaks. The show returned for a second series in spring 2015. From 2014 to 2015, he hosted the revived version of game show &quot;Celebrity Squares&quot; on ITV. The first series was shown in 2014 and a second aired in 2015.

Davis appeared in the 2015 sequel &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot;. In July 2015, he became the voice of Gordon the Gopher in a pilot developed for BBC Taster, and the pilot progressed well, becoming one of the highest rated on the BBC&#x27;s Taster section.

In November 2016, Davis began presenting the daytime ITV game show &quot;Tenable&quot;. The show returned for further series in 2017 and 2018. Davis also appeared in &quot;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story&quot;, released December 2016, as the rebel fighter Weeteef Cyubee and that was also his first &quot;Star Wars&quot; role with a blaster. In April 2017, at Star Wars Celebration Orlando, it was announced that Davis would voice Grand Admiral Thrawn&#x27;s bodyguard Rukh in the fourth season of &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot;. In December 2017, Davis appeared as Wodibin, an alien gambler, in &quot;Star Wars: The Last Jedi&quot;. Davis appeared in the film &quot;&quot;, released in May 2018, reuniting with his &quot;Willow&quot; director Ron Howard. This was Davis&#x27; eighth appearance in a &quot;Star Wars&quot; film. In the film, Davis reprised his role of Weazel from &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;. Davis also briefly appeared in &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot;, reprising his role of Wicket. He appeared in the role alongside his son Harrison, who also cameoed as Wicket&#x27;s son Pommet.

Davis reprised his role as Willow Ufgood in the Disney+ series &quot;Willow&quot; to generally positive critic reviews.

In February 2025 Davis was awarded a BAFTA Fellowship.

====&quot;Star Wars&quot; characters====
Davis plays Wicket in four films and Weazel in two films; all fifteen of Warwick Davis&#x27; Star Wars characters break down as such:
=== Other projects ===
In 1995, Davis co-founded, with fellow actor and father-in-law Peter Burroughs, the talent agency Willow Management, that specialises in representing actors under five feet (1.52 m) tall. Many of Davis&#x27;s co-stars and fellow actors with dwarfism from &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Willow&quot;, &quot;Labyrinth&quot; and the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series are represented by the agency. In 2004, the agency also began representing actors over seven feet (2.13 m) tall who had suffered from being confined to &quot;niche&quot; roles. Over forty members of Willow Management were cast as goblins in &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot;.

In April 2010, Davis published his autobiography, &quot;Size Matters Not: The Extraordinary Life and Career of Warwick Davis&quot;, with a foreword by George Lucas.

In October 2012, Davis appeared in a set of videos with the popular YouTube group The Yogscast, after the hosts of the yogscast&#x27;s podcast &quot;The YogPod&quot; discussed him in several episodes. In January 2013, he appeared in a Comic Relief episode of &quot;The Great British Bake Off&quot;, winning that episode&#x27;s title of &quot;Comic Relief Star Baker&quot;.

Davis is a founder of the Reduced Height Theatre Company, which stages theatrical productions cast exclusively with short actors and using reduced height sets. Their first production was &quot;See How They Run&quot;, touring the UK in 2014. In February 2015, the production was the subject of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Warwick Davis&#x27; Big Night&quot; as part of the &quot;Modern Times&quot; documentary series.

On 15 July 2014, Davis appeared on stage with Monty Python during their live show &quot;Monty Python Live (Mostly)&quot;. He was the special guest in their &quot;Blackmail&quot; sketch. In June 2016, he was the castaway on the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, choosing Jon Hopkins&#x27; &quot;Monsters&quot; theme, &quot;The Guinness Book of Records&quot; and a pen and paper as his favourite record, book, and luxury item respectively.

Davis produced a new original musical &quot;Eugenius!&quot; by Ben Adams and Chris Wilkins, which premiered as a concert performance on 29 June 2016 at the London Palladium (which Davis also starred in as Evil Lord Hector) followed by fully staged runs at The Other Palace in 2018.

In February 2017, the BBC broadcast an episode of the genealogy programme &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; about Davis. In the episode Davis learned that in his family tree he had an ancestor that had been married to two women at the same time, another who had died in an asylum from syphilis and another who performed at minstrel shows in blackface.

In December 2024, Davis appeared as a judge on the Food Network competition show Harry Potter: Wizards of Baking.

== Personal life ==
Davis is tall.

He was married to Samantha Davis (née Burroughs), the daughter of Davis&#x27; business partner Peter Burroughs and the sister of actress Hayley Burroughs, until her death on 24 March 2024. Davis met the Burroughs family while filming &quot;Willow&quot;, where Samantha and Peter had minor roles as Nelwyn villagers. They have two surviving children; their first child died in infancy. Their daughter is actress Annabelle Davis.

Unlike most people with dwarfism who have a condition called achondroplasia (70.65%), Davis&#x27; dwarfism is caused by an extremely rare genetic condition called spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (SED). Davis&#x27; wife, Samantha, had achondroplasia, and their two children have SED. As a result of inheriting both conditions, the couple&#x27;s first son died nine days after birth. Their second son was miscarried at 19 weeks.

Davis has said the only real drawback to being small was the associated health problems. Of his own dwarfism, Davis has said, &quot;Well, as you get older, it gets worse... Your joints, for a start. My hips are dislocated, so they&#x27;re sitting out here. Very painful knees. I had surgery on my feet when I was very young. There&#x27;s a risk of retinal detachment, but I know the signs now.&quot;

Davis is co-founder of Little People UK, a charity that provides support to people with dwarfism and their families.

On 18 April 2024, Davis said his wife&#x27;s death had &quot;left a huge hole in our lives as a family.&quot;

<text>The Shire of West Wimmera is a local government area in the western part of the Wimmera region of Victoria, Australia, located in the western part of the state. It covers an area of and in June 2018 had a population of 3,862. It includes the towns of Apsley, Edenhope, Goroke, Gymbowen, Harrow, Kaniva, Minimay, Nurcoung and Serviceton. It was formed in 1995 from the amalgamation of the Shire of Kaniva and parts of the Shire of Kowree, Shire of Arapiles and Shire of Glenelg.

The Shire is governed and administered by the West Wimmera Shire Council; its seat of local government and administrative centre is located at the council headquarters in Edenhope, it also has a service centre located in Kaniva. The Shire is named after the Wimmera region, in which the LGA occupies the western portion. The LGA is also located entirely to the west of the Wimmera River, which actually meanders through another municipality to the east, that is the Rural City of Horsham.

==Council==
===Current composition===
The council is composed of five councillors elected to represent an unsubdivided municipality. Council Composition as of November 2022.
===Administration and governance===
The council meets in the council chambers in the Edenhope and Kaniva Municipal Offices. It also provides customer services at both centres.

===Controversies===
In April 2022, Mayor Bruce Meyer caused outrage by likening requests to display the internationally recognised LGBTIQ+ pride flag to mark the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, Intersexism and Transphobia (IDAHOBIT) to the promotion of pedophilia.

==Townships and localities==
The 2021 census documented the shire&#x27;s population at 4,006, up from 3,903 in the 2016 census.

<text>FOREX Bank is a foreign exchange bureau in the Nordic region. 

, the company had 84 branches, principally located at railway stations or airports, but also shopping malls and high streets. The company also offers online current and savings account, loans, cash handling, money transfer, travel booking and payments.

==History ==
The company was started in 1927, it provided currency exchange for travellers at the main Stockholm Central train station. It is said that it started by the owner of Gyllenspet&#x27;s Barber Shop at the station, when he discovered that most of his customers were tourists in need of currency for their trips. Therefore, the barber began keeping the major currencies on hand.

The company was subsequently acquired by Statens Järnvägar, the Swedish State Railways, which expanded the operations until it was sold to Rolf Friberg in 1965. The company was for many years the only non-bank business that was licensed to conduct currency exchange in Sweden.

The company, which is still wholly owned by the Friberg family, expanded into neighbouring Finland in 1993, Denmark in 1994 and Norway in 2004.

In 2003, the company extended its business into retail banking and also offered current and savings accounts including internet and mobile banking, loans, debit and credit cards, cash handling, money transfer and payments.

<doc id="493135" wikidata="Q920571" url="?curid=493135" title="Bailiff of Jersey">
<text>The Bailiff of Jersey () has several roles:
* Chief judge 
* President of the States Assembly, carrying out functions of a presiding officer
* Civic head of the Bailiwick of Jersey
* Guardian of the constitution
* President of the Licensing Assembly, regulating alcohol sales
* Must give permission for certain types of public entertainment to take place.
The position of Bailiff was created shortly after the Treaty of Paris 1259 in which the king of England, Henry III, gave up claim to all of the Duchy of Normandy but the Channel Islands. In 1290, separate bailiffs for Jersey and Guernsey were appointed.

==History==
The position of Bailiff in Norman law predates the separation of Normandy in 1204.

=== Origins ===
When the Channel Islands were granted self-governance by King John after 1204, legislative power was vested in 12 jurats, the twelve &quot;senior men&quot; of the island. Along with the Bailiff, they would form the Royal Court, which determined all civil and criminal causes (except treason).

Any oppression by a bailiff or a warden was to be resolved locally or failing that, by appeal to the King who appointed commissioners to report on disputes. In the late 1270s, Jersey was given its own Bailiff (the first record of someone holding the position is in 1277) and from the 1290s, the duties of Bailiff and Warden were separated. The (Sub-)Warden became responsible for taxation and defence, while the Bailiff became responsible for justice. While probably originally a temporary arrangement by Otto de Grandson, this became permanent and the foundation for Jersey&#x27;s modern separation of Crown and justice. It also lessened the Warden&#x27;s authority relative to the Bailiff, who had much more interaction with the community.

In 1462, the occupying French Governor de Brézé issued ordinances outlining the role of the Bailiff and the Jurats. It may well be during this occupation that the island saw the establishment of the States. Comte Maulevrier, who had led the invasion of the island, ordered the holding of an Assize in the island. Maulevrier confirmed the place of existing institutions, however created the requirement for Jurats to be chosen by Bailiffs, Jurats, Rectors and Constables. The earliest extant Act of the States dates from 1524.

=== 17th century ===
Sir John Peyton (Governor 1603-1620) was also against democracy in the form of the States and the freedoms of the Courts in Jersey. In 1615, Jean Hérault was appointed Bailiff by the King, having been promised the role by letters patent in 1611. Peyton disputed this appointment, claiming it was the Governor&#x27;s jurisdiction to appoint the Bailiff. Hérault asserted it was the King&#x27;s jurisdiction to directly appoint the Bailiff. An Order in Council (dated 9 August 1615) sided with Hérault. Hérault took this to claim the Bailiff was the real head of government and took steps to assert the precedence of the Bailiff over Governor: he ordered his name to be placed before the Governor&#x27;s in church prayers and was the first Bailiff to wear red robes (in the style of English judges). To back his claims, he cited that in the Norman administrative tradition, the Bailiffs had &quot;no one above them except the Duke&quot;. Though the Privy Council did not agree with Hérault&#x27;s extreme position on the precedence of the Bailiff, on 18 February 1617 it declared that the &quot;charge of military forces be wholly in the Governor, and the care of justice and civil affairs in the Bailiff.&quot; This secured for the Bailiff precedence over the Governor on justice and civil affairs.

=== 18th century ===
Following the Jersey Revolution or Corn Riots in 1769, the 1771 Code of Laws confirmed that new Jersey laws could not be adopted without approval by the States assembly and required Privy Council approval. From this time on the Bailiff was to be the chief power in Jersey as president of the States, rather than as president of the Royal Court.

The party of Charlots (conservative supporters of Lemprière who claimed that the States could not pass legislation without the agreement of the Royal Court) were opposed at elections by &quot;Magots&quot;, and by 1790 the progressive &quot;Magots&quot; had majorities in both the Royal Court and the States.

By 1750, the Bailiffship had de facto become a hereditary position in the de Carteret family for 166 years. Absences of the de Carterets and all other high-ranking posts left Charles Lempière, the Lieutenant Bailiff, in effective full control over the island. Lempière was a Parliamentarian, but by temperament was autocratic. His family had significant power with a number of high-ranking roles in the island and he issued ordinances and quashed protest through his court.:195

In 1786, the Bailiff gained power to summon the States (in addition to the Governor and Jurats).

=== 19th century ===
In 1826, the long succession of absentee bailiffs came to an end with the appointment of Thomas Le Breton Sr (Bailiff 1826–1831). He was the first Bailiff for 120 years to live in Jersey and was &#x27;accused of indolence&#x27;.

Under Jean Hammond (Bailiff 1858–1880) the role became established as a politically impartial, if paternalistic, presidency. The introduction of deputies into the States in 1857 added to the democratic weight of the legislative assembly, but the bailiff still guided the government of the bailiwick.

The States continued to use the Royal Court as their debating chamber until the construction of a dedicated States chamber on an adjacent site in 1887.

In 1899, the Bailiff began receiving an annual salary of £1,200, replacing the previous system of funding through court fees. The cost of this salary was jointly covered by the States and the Crown.

=== 20th century ===
Although the need for centralised administration during the German Occupation 1940-1945 made the Bailiff a commanding figure in the circumstances of trying to maintain the life of the bailiwick, the constitutional reforms of 1948 which removed the Jurats from the States, replacing them with Senators, separated more clearly legislature and judiciary. Political leadership now rested more clearly with the senators as purely political senior elected representatives.The reforms declared that the Bailiff shall be the judge of the law, and the Jurats the &quot;judge of fact&quot;.

The States of Jersey Law 2005 removed the Bailiff&#x27;s casting vote in the event of a tied vote in the States chamber, and the power of dissent. The 2005 law also introduced a ministerial system of government under a Chief Minister, which further removed the Bailiff from involvement in executive decision-making.

== Deputy Bailiff ==
The role of Deputy Bailiff was created by the States Assembly in 1958. This is a full-time professional office. Like the Bailiff, the Deputy Bailiff must be qualified as a Jersey lawyer. The deputy bailiff has a specific function of being the president of the Board of Examiners for the Jersey law examinations.

== Lieutenant Bailiffs ==
Two or more of the senior Jurats are appointed by the Bailiff as Lieutenant Bailiffs. They assist the Bailiff with civic duties and may preside in the Royal Court. Like other Jurats, the Lieutenant Bailiffs are part-time honorary (unpaid) roles.

==Appointment of Bailiff and Deputy Bailiff==
By convention, the Deputy Bailiff is appointed as Bailiff without a selection process.

The Deputy Bailiff’s appointment is made formally by the Crown, on the recommendation of a panel consisting of the Bailiff, another judge of the Royal Court, and the chair of the Jersey Appointments Commission. The process involves advertisement, shortlisting based on a job description and consultation process, including of some States members who hold particular Assembly roles. In modern times, all Deputy Bailiffs have previously held office as Attorney General or Solicitor General, or both.

The Bailiff is appointed by the Crown through letters patent. They serve at His Majesty&#x27;s pleasure, usually until an age of retirement as specified in their letters patent, unless they resign earlier.
When a Bailiff&#x27;s term of office ends, all the functions of Bailiff are exercised by the Deputy Bailiff until the next Bailiff is formally appointed.

===Removal from office===
The Bailiff and Deputy Bailiff may be removed from office by the King, on the advice of the UK Government minister responsible for Channel Island affairs, currently the Secretary of State for Justice but in the past the Home Secretary. Three individuals who held the office of Bailiff or Deputy Bailiff have been dismissed or required to resign.
*Sir William Venables Vernon resigned as Bailiff in 1931 following a &#x27;round robin&#x27; letter from several prominent islanders who believed that, aged 79, he was no longer capable of carrying out his duties.
*Charles Malet de Carteret – &#x27;the most self-effacing man who ever occupied this office&#x27;– came under pressure to resign as Bailiff in 1935, after refusing to represent the island at King George V&#x27;s silver jubilee celebrations in London.
*Vernon Tomes was dismissed from his position as Deputy Bailiff in 1992.

==Roles of the Bailiff==
===Chief judge===
The Bailiff is the &quot;Chef Magistrat&quot; of the island. &#x27;The major part of the Bailiff&#x27;s time is spent on his judicial duties&#x27;, the Carwell Review noted. As chief judge, the Bailiff is
* Head of the judiciary of Jersey
* President of the Royal Court (chief justice) 
* President of the Court of Appeal, though in practice the Bailiff rarely sits in this court
* Member of the Court of Appeal of Guernsey

In the Royal Court, the Bailiff may sit as a single judge or with Jurats. The Bailiff is the judge of law but not generally a judge of fact. Instead, the Jurats normally decide the facts in civil and the sentence in criminal cases.

The Bailiff appoints Commissioners to preside in the Royal Court.

The Bailiff appoints - but alone cannot suspend or dismiss - the Judicial Greffier (the clerk of the court). The Bailiff can also issue search warrants.

===President of the States Assembly===
The Bailiff serves as the president (or speaker) of the States Assembly. This role has been in place from the origins of the States in the 16th century, and stems from the States&#x27; role as a consultative body for the Royal Court, where the Bailiff also presided. Le Hérissier notes that ‘From 1771 to 1940, the States slowly detached themselves from the influence of the Royal Court’, growing more representative with the inclusion of elected members – but the Bailiff remained.

Historically, the Bailiff had authority to &#x27;dissent&#x27; from a resolution passed by the States Assembly if the Bailiff was of the opinion that the Assembly lacked the power to pass it. This had the effect of transmitting the resolution to the King and making the resolution of no effect. This was abolished by the States of Jersey Law 2005.

The Bailiff, or Deputy Bailiff when presiding, also previously held a casting vote in the event that the States Assembly was equally divided. This vote, rarely exercised, was by convention used maintain the status quo, allowing further debate on the issue. This was also abolished in 2005.

In the Chamber, the Bailiff&#x27;s seat is higher than the Lieutenant Governor&#x27;s to emphasise the Bailiff&#x27;s higher position in regard to the island&#x27;s civil government.

The question whether the office of bailiff should combine roles of chief justice, presiding officer of the legislature and civic functions has long been a matter of debate. The 1947 &quot;Report of the Committee of the Privy Council on the Proposed Reforms in the Channel Islands&quot; recommended &#x27;that there should be no alteration in the present functions of the Bailiff&#x27;. But three official reviews in the 21st century have recommended that the Bailiff should cease to have the role of President of the States Assembly:
* The Clothier review on the machinery of government in Jersey (December 2000).
* The Carswell review of the Crown Officers (December 2009).
* The Independent Jersey Care Inquiry (July 2017).

The case for reform is that in a democracy, parliamentarians should have the power to choose the speaker of their assembly. There have also been concerns that the Bailiff&#x27;s position as President of the States Assembly conflicts with the constitutional principles of separation of powers and judicial independence. Such calls for the separation of the office&#x27;s powers are longstanding: in 1859, writer Helier Simon called a potential separation &quot;desirable&quot;.

The Bailiff&#x27;s role as President of the States Assembly is defended on the grounds that the current arrangement works well in practice. There are also concerns that removing the Bailiff from the States Assembly would undermine his status as the civic head of Jersey.

===Civic head===
The Carswell Review noted that the Bailiff &#x27;carries out a number of ceremonial and public duties. He receives Royalty, visiting ambassadors and other prominent visitors to Jersey, plays the leading part in the Liberation Day and Remembrance Sunday ceremonies and hosts a number of official dinners. When the Lieutenant Governor is away from the Island the Bailiff acts as Deputy Governor. He is a member of various public committees, supports and attends functions of a number of charities and community organisations and has a constant round of public engagements to fulfil&#x27;.

The Bailiff was previously President of the Emergencies Council, which was established in 1990, but is no longer a member though remains entitled to attend.

===Guardian of the constitution===
In 2020, the Deputy Bailiff described the Bailiff&#x27;s guardian of the constitution function as including powers of
*&#x27;giving voice to constitutional concerns that might undermine the rights and privileges of the Island and of Islanders, and advising and warning the Chief Minister and Government of Jersey accordingly&#x27; and 
* &#x27;advising the Lieutenant Governor who in turn advises the Sovereign on constitutional matters affecting the Island’s privileges and freedoms&#x27;.

The Bailiff is the official channel of communication between the island authorities and the UK Government, though this has altered since the development of ministerial government and the creation of the role of Chief Minister.

The Bailiff is also the keeper of the island&#x27;s Royal Mace the custodian of the island&#x27;s seal, first granted by Edward I in 1279.

===President of the Licensing Assembly===
The Bailiff presides over the Licensing Assembly, the remains of a body which once exercised considerable administrative authority, but now only has the powers to grant alcohol licences. Lord Carswell&#x27;s review in 2009 recommended that the Bailiff should remain the president of Licensing Assembly.

===Licensor of public entertainment===
Many types of public entertainment can only take place by permission of the Bailiff. This is done in consultation with public services and standards of public decency. Since 1987, an advisory panel appointed by the States Assembly has delegated authority in the name of the bailiff who is not involved in any respect with the decision-making process.

The Carswell review noted that &#x27;It is recognised generally that this is an executive function which it is not appropriate for the Bailiff to carry out, and successive Bailiff have wished to be relieved of it&#x27;.

The last Bailiff to make extensive use of censorship powers, on advice of a consultative committee, was Sir Peter Crill. In 1992, he refused permission for a visiting amateur theatre group to perform Howard Brenton&#x27;s play Christie in Love and required changes to the staging of a production of Shakespeare&#x27;s Coriolanus by the Tricycle Theatre Company to prevent an actor&#x27;s naked buttocks being visible to the audience. The Monty Python film &#x27;Life of Brian&#x27; was deemed suitable only for islanders over 18, which led to the production company refusing to let it be shown in Jersey.

==Holders of the office of Bailiff==
The list of bailiffs is only reliably traceable from Philippe L&#x27;Evesque&#x27;s appointment in 1277, although earlier bailiffs are mentioned and the office may date from before 1204.

<text>The United Kingdom was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 2004 with the song &quot;Hold Onto Our Love&quot;, written by Gary Miller and Tim Woodcock, and performed by James Fox. The British participating broadcaster, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), organised a public selection process to determine its entry for the contest, &quot;Eurovision: Making Your Mind Up 2004&quot;. Six acts competed in the national final and the winner was selected entirely through a public vote.

As a member of the &quot;Big Four&quot;, the United Kingdom automatically qualified to compete in the final of the Eurovision Song Contest. Performing in position 20, the United Kingdom placed 16th out of the 24 participating countries with 29 points.

==Background==

Prior to the 2004 contest, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest representing the United Kingdom forty-six times. Thus far, it has won the contest five times: in with the song &quot;Puppet on a String&quot; performed by Sandie Shaw, in with the song &quot;Boom Bang-a-Bang&quot; performed by Lulu, in with &quot;Save Your Kisses for Me&quot; performed by Brotherhood of Man, in with the song &quot;Making Your Mind Up&quot; performed by Bucks Fizz, and in with the song &quot;Love Shine a Light&quot; performed by Katrina and the Waves. To this point, the nation is noted for having finished as the runner-up in a record fifteen contests. Up to and including , it had only twice finished outside the top 10, and . Since 1999, the year in which the rule was abandoned that songs must be performed in one of the official languages of the country participating, it has had less success, thus far only finishing within the top ten once: with the song &quot;Come Back&quot; performed by Jessica Garlick. In , &quot;Cry Baby&quot; performed by Jemini finished in twenty-sixth (last) place out of twenty-six competing entries.

As part of its duties as participating broadcaster, the BBC organises the selection of its entry in the Eurovision Song Contest and broadcasts the event in the country. The broadcaster announced that it would participate in the 2004 contest on 8 November 2003. BBC has traditionally organised a national final featuring a competition among several artists and songs to choose its entry for Eurovision. For its 2004 entry, the broadcaster announced that a new primetime national final involving a public vote would be held to select its entry, replacing the traditional &quot;A Song for Europe&quot; show more recently aired in a Sunday afternoon timeslot on BBC One.

The winner was selected entirely through a public vote. The show was broadcast on BBC One. The national final was watched by 7.2 million viewers in the United Kingdom.

==== Competing entries ====
The BBC collaborated with record label Sony Music and an independent music expert to select five finalists to compete in the national final. Entries were provided to Sony Music and the BBC by music industry experts including writers and producers, and the songwriters behind the five selected songs were: Andy McCluskey and Stuart Kershaw, Brian Higgins and Stuart McLennan, Brian Rawling, Gary Barlow and Pam Sheyne. A sixth finalist, &quot;It Just Gets Better&quot; performed by Madison Taylor, was provided by the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (BASCA) which ran a songwriting competition amongst its members. The six artists were announced on 3 February 2004, while the competing songs were premiered during the BBC One television programme &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, hosted by Tim Kash, on 13 February 2004.

====Final====
Six acts competed in the televised final on 28 February 2004. In addition to their performances, guest performers included previous Eurovision winner Sertab Erener, who won the contest for with the song &quot;Everyway That I Can&quot;, and Emma Bunton, performing her song &quot;Maybe&quot; and the winning song for the &quot;Puppet on a String&quot;.

A panel of experts provided feedback regarding the songs during the show. The panel consisted of Lorraine Kelly (journalist and television presenter), Harry Hill (comedian, writer, and television presenter) and Carrie Grant (member of Sweet Dreams who represented the , vocal coach and television presenter). A public vote consisting of televoting via phone and SMS as well as interactive voting via the red button, which registered more than 200,000 votes, selected the winner. Televotes via phone calls were divided into seven regions in the United Kingdom with each region awarding points as follows: 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 points. Televotes via SMS were combined with the interactive votes and converted to points based on the percentage each song achieved. For example, if a song gained 10% of the SMS and interactive votes, then that entry would be awarded 10 points. The spokesperson announcing the SMS/interactive votes was Lorraine Kelly. After both sets of points were combined, &quot;Hold Onto Our Love&quot; performed by James Fox was the winner. &quot;Hold Onto Our Love&quot; received 45% of the total votes.

<doc id="493141" wikidata="Q11781521" url="?curid=493141" title="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs">
<text>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs () was the holder of a position in the Government of Ireland (and, earlier, in the Executive Council of the Irish Free State). From 1924 until 1984 – when it was abolished – the minister headed the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (also known as the P&amp;T in English and P⁊T in Irish, and later stylised as p+t), the government-run postal, telegraph and telephone service covering the Republic of Ireland.

==History==
The office of Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was created by the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924, which reorganised the Irish system of government shortly after the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922. The Minister exercised those functions which had formerly been exercised by the Postmaster General of the United Kingdom. Legislation in 1831 had amalgamated the earlier offices of Postmaster General of Great Britain and Postmasters General of Ireland, which became a jointly held role in the administration of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.
The Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924 defined the department&#x27;s role:
The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was responsible for Ireland&#x27;s postal and telecommunications services from 1924 to 1984. At its height the department was one of the largest civil service departments in Ireland. The reform of the sector and department began in 1978 with the creation of the Posts and Telegraphs Review Group. This led, following the delivery of a report in 1979, to the creation of the Interim Board for Posts (&quot;An Bord Poist&quot;), chaired by Feargal Quinn, and the Interim Board for Telecommunications (&quot;An Bord Telecom&quot;), chaired by Michael Smurfit. These two boards continued to sit until An Post and Telecom Éireann, respectively, replaced them in 1984 as state-sponsored agencies.

The Department of Posts and Telegraphs ceased to exist in 1984, and its powers and responsibilities were transferred to the newly created Department of Communications. This was one of the largest reorganisations of the civil service in modern times, the old department having had a workforce of about 30,000 prior to dissolution. With the transfer of personnel to the new agencies, the number of civil service employees was almost halved overnight.

The Minister for Communications was created in 1983 to replace both the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the Minister for Transport. In 1987, the transport functions of the department were moved to a new Department of Tourism and Transport. In 1991 the minister&#x27;s functions were passed to the renamed Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications and the department ceased to exist, but was not formally abolished.

The functions which had initially been under the Minister for Communications are now under the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, and the Minister for Transport.

===Alteration of name and transfer of functions===
==List of office-holders==

;Notes
==List of ministers of state==
Under the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924, the Executive Council could appoint Parliamentary Secretaries to assist Ministers in the Executive Council (renamed the Government in 1937). From 1978, this position was abolished and replaced by the position of Minister of State who could be appointed to a government department. The Minister of State did not hold cabinet rank.

<text>Cramlington is a town and civil parish in Northumberland. It is north of Newcastle upon Tyne. The name suggests a probable founding by the Danes or Anglo-Saxons.

The population was 28,843 as of 2021 census data from Northumberland County Council. It sits on the border between Northumberland and North Tyneside with the traffic interchange at Moor Farm, Annitsford, linking the two areas.

The area of East Cramlington lies east of the A189, on the B1326 road that connects the town to Seaton Delaval.

==History==

The first record of the Manor of Cramlington is from a mention in 1135 when the land was granted to Nicholas de Grenville. A register of early chaplains begins with John the Clerk of Cramlington (c. 1163–1180). The register continues to the present day.

From the 12th century onwards, its history has been mostly rural, incorporating several farms and the parish church of St. Nicholas (built at a cost of £3,000 during 1865–1868 in the Gothic style). During the early 19th century, coal mining with several mine shafts in the immediate vicinity began to change that. In 1813 Collingwood Main Colliery suffered an explosion of firedamp in which 8 people were killed. Six miners were carrying timber through the &quot;old workings&quot; when their candles set fire to firedamp. The resulting afterdamp and chokedamp resulted in a wider loss of life to men and horses.

The town remained small, however, until 1964 when it was proclaimed a New Town and developers such as William Leech and J.T. Bell developed large housing estates. Those estates have since been named Beaconhill, Collingwood, Eastfield, Mayfield, Shankhouse, Southfield, and Whitelea and the town has effectively become a dormitory town of the much larger city to its south.

During World War I, the North East of England was protected by the No. 36 Home Defence Squadron. The squadron was formed at Cramlington on 1 February 1916 by Capt. R. O. Abercromby, with Cramlington subsequently becoming an important base for military planes and airships. The Airship Station was at Nelson Village. A reference to Cramlington airfield is made in W. E. Johns 1935 book &quot;The Black Peril&quot; from the extremely popular Biggles series.

Cramlington was the site of two rail accidents. In 1855, the chassis of train&#x27;s first class carriage failed and in 1926, the Merry Hampton engine and five carriages of the Edinburgh to King&#x27;s Cross Flying Scotsman express train were derailed by striking miners during the General Strike. The story of the derailment was recounted in the BBC Two programme &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Witness: The Cramlington Train Wreckers&quot; in 1970.

During the BBC Domesday Project in 1986 it was recorded that Cramlington&#x27;s population was around 30,000.

===New town development===
The idea of a new town development in Cramlington was first envisaged in 1958.

In June 1961, Northumberland County Council&#x27;s Planning Committee approved the draft plans to establish what it hoped would be &quot;Britain&#x27;s first enterprise town.&quot; Sponsored by the council, the development was to be carried by a consortium led by William Leech, which had acquired the land. It was predicted to take 20 years, cost £50m and eventually house 40,000 inhabitants across a four square mile site that also included an industrial zone. A one-way road system was proposed, with the waggon ways of the former pits being repurposed as pedestrians paths.

The plan was finally approved by the Minister of Housing and Local Government in January 1963, by which time the estimated population had grown to 48,000 and the cost projected at £60m. It marked the first time a new town had been developed without the establishment of a government-backed development corporation. The planning officer predicted that it should look like a town in five years and be complete in 20 years. The first factory was to be completed by summer 1963.

In October 1964, an advert inviting investment in the development recorded an area of 2,200 acres, 530 of which were for industry.


In 2017, remnants of an Iron Age settlement was discovered on land destined for further housing development. Despite the interest of the town population and the potential to build upon the increasing town profile and interest created by Northumberlandia, Northumberland County Council decided to proceed with the housing development regardless.

==Local government==
Cramlington Local Government District was created in 1865. Later, the Local Government Act of 1894 established the Cramlington Urban District. This was succeeded by the Seaton Valley Urban District in 1935. From 1 April 1974, Cramlington became a part of Blyth Valley. Responsibilities were transferred to Northumberland County Council from 1 April 2009 as a result of 2009 structural changes to local government in England.

On 5 September 2019, to mark the 10th anniversary of the establishment of Cramlington Town Council, it was agreed to create the position of Town Mayor. The position was awarded to Cllr Loraine De Simone. Loraine has been a councillor in the Cramlington Village ward since 2017.

The most recent vote saw a Conservative majority in the 2021 Northumberland County Council election.

The election results for the Parish and Town council for Cramlington on 6 May 2021:
* Cramlington East - Phil and Faith Rudd
(Independent) &amp; Elizabeth Mitcheson (Labour)
* Cramlington North - Wayne Daley &amp; Helen Morris (Conservative)
* Cramlington West - Barry Flux &amp; Patricia Heard (Conservative)
* Cramlington Eastfield - Christine Dunbar &amp; Norman Dunbar (Conservative)
* Cramlington South East - Paul Ezhilchelvan &amp; Stephen Garrett (Conservative)
* Cramlington Village - Loraine De Simone &amp; Mark Swinburn (Conservative)
Following the death of Cllr Mitcheson in August 2023, a by-election was held in the Cramlington East ward on November 16, 2023 and was won by Feona Bowey (Labour).

==Estates==
With the establishment of the new town, the area was arranged into estates, primarily with a designator of the part of the town in which the estate was to be found.

The estates are:

* Nelson Village
*High Pit
* Northburn (constructed between the late 1980s and the 1990s)
* Northburn Manor (constructed in the early 2000s)
* Eastfield (constructed in the 1970s with an estate added in the mid-1990s)
* Westwood (constructed in the early 1980s)
* Southfield Lea (constructed in the early 1970s)
* Southfield Gardens (constructed in the early 2000s)
* Mayfield (partially existing prior to the new town designation but with addition building in the late 1960s)
* Whitelea (one of the earliest of the new town estates, constructed in the late 1960s and early 1970s)
* Barns Park (constructed in the 1970s)
* Parkside (constructed in the 1970s)
* Beacon Hill (constructed in the 1970s)
* Beacon Lane (constructed in the 1970s)
* Collingwood Grange (constructed in the late 1960s)
* Southfield Lea Westerkirk Extension (constructed in the 1980s)
* Bassington Manor (constructed between 2015 and 2017)
* St Nicholas Manor (constructed between 2017 and 2023)
*Collingwood Chase (Constructed in the late 1960s)
*Southfield Green (Constructed in the early 1970s)

=== Recently completed or currently under construction ===
Northumberland County Council and other equity holders have invested millions into the south-west sector of the town with plans to develop this sector first originating in the late 2000&#x27;s and early 2010&#x27;s. Housebuilders such as Bellway Homes, Persimmon, Barratt and Keepmoat have all agreed to work to develop this sector to be known as &quot;Arcot&quot;. The estates in this sector so far include:

* Arcot Manor (constructed between 2017 and 2023)
* The Fairways (constructed between 2017 and 2024)
* Beaconsfield Park (currently under construction 2023-)
* West Meadows (currently under construction 2023-)
* Foxton Mill (currently under construction 2023-)
* Fairway View (currently under construction 2023-)

==Economy==

===Industry===
There are several large industrial zones in Cramlington, most to the town&#x27;s north-west near the sewage treatment plant, housing major pharmaceutical companies including Merck Sharp and Dohme. Other growing chemical companies including Aesica Pharmaceuticals are also present. The Officers Club menswear firm (now owned by Blue Inc), previously had its headquarters and supply warehouse in Cramlington, in part of the old Wilkinson Blade factory while other companies such as GE Oil &amp; Gas also occupy large sites. Start Football is also headquartered in the town.

Wilkinson Sword established the first factory in the town in 1964. American Air Filter Company later built premises. Brentford Nylons also opened a large site in the town in 1968.

Boots, the pharmaceuticals manufacturer, opened their plant in Cramlington in 1983.

===Retail===
The Manor Walks shopping centre was constructed in the centre of the town in the 1970s, and was subsequently expanded in the mid-1990s and in 2003/4. The centre now includes retailers such as Argos, Asda, Boots, Boyes, Next and Sainsbury&#x27;s. In 2011, plans were put forward to revamp the main center and build a new cinema. The scheme also includes improved retail facilities, restaurants and cafes and more car parking spaces.

Manor Walks was extended into the southern car park in 2012 / 2013 and a new Vue Cinema and two new restaurants opened in July 2013. This coincided with the re-opening of a prominent pub in the town (previously the Traveller&#x27;s Rest but now named John the Clerk of Cramlington). It is hoped that these developments will boost the town&#x27;s leisure and visitor economies.

The Brockwell Centre, built in 1990 towards the north of the town, consists of a small range of shops and food outlets, alongside a public house, care home and medical centre. A supermarket, built for Netto, but subsequently owned by Somerfield and The Co-operative Group, is presently occupied by Home Bargains.

===Healthcare===
Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust opened the first hospital in England purpose-built for emergency care in the town in June 2015. The Northumbria Specialist Emergency Care Hospital cost £75 million. It has emergency care consultants on duty at all times, and a range of specialists available seven days a week. In February 2021, the NHS trust began court action against contractor Lendlease over structural defects identified in the building. A trial is due to start in October 2022.

=== New development ===

The only secondary school in the town, Cramlington Learning Village (which is also the largest school in the county), is part of the Government’s School Rebuilding Programme which involves the demolition of the existing buildings (constructed in 1969) and rebuilt into one ‘state-of-the-art’ teaching accommodation.

Plans for this new school campus were first released in October 2024 by planning organisation DPP Planning. Construction of the new school will start in the summer of 2025 and is expected to be completed by September 2027.

==Landmarks==
Plessey Woods Country Park lies just to the north of Cramlington, with the River Blyth flowing through the country park. Northumberlandia, a huge land sculpture in the shape of a reclining female figure is located on the outskirts of Cramlington. Within the town itself, Nelson Hill is a prominent landmark to the north of the town centre. Arcot Hall Grasslands and Ponds SSSI is situated to the south-east of the town.

==Transport==

The town is served by Cramlington railway station which is on the East Coast Main Line, with services to the MetroCentre, Morpeth and Newcastle upon Tyne provided by Northern.

It is also served by a number of bus operators including Arriva North East which provides express services to Newcastle upon Tyne, Morpeth and Blyth, as well as Go North East which runs services to and from North Shields.

The town is located approximately from Newcastle International Airport and from North Shields International Ferry Terminal.

Cramlington also has good road transport links, being situated between the A1, A19 and A189 roads.

In line with many of the UK&#x27;s post-war New Towns, Cramlington has an extensive bicycle network. With a grid spacing of approximately , segregated cycle routes are provided free of motorised traffic.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North East and Cumbria and ITV Tyne Tees. Television signals are received from the Pontop Pike TV transmitter. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Newcastle, Heart North East, Capital North East, Smooth North East, Greatest Hits Radio North East, Hits Radio North East and Koast Radio, a community based radio station. The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;Northumberland Gazette&quot; (formerly The News Post Leader).

==Education==
Until September 2008, all schools in Northumberland operated under a three tier system, however, following a decision to convert the county to a two tier system, Cramlington was chosen as one of the first towns to complete this. Prior to the closure of the area&#x27;s many middle schools, some primary schools relocated to the former middle school sites. There had been concern from local residents over traffic and parking arrangements at the new sites.

Other schools in Cramlington are listed as follows: Hareside Primary School, Hillcrest School, Shanklea Primary School, Burnside Primary School, Cragside Church of England Primary School, Northburn Primary School, Eastlea Primary School, Beaconhill Primary School and SS Peter and Paul&#x27;s Catholic Primary Academy.

===Cramlington Learning Village===

In September 2008 Cramlington Community High School was renamed Cramlington Learning Village as it gained two new year groups in line with the move to a two tier system. The village has three sections: the Junior Learning Village (for Years 7 and 8), the Senior Learning Village (for Years 9 to 11) and the Advanced Learning Village (for Years 12 and 13). The school was rated outstanding in four successive Ofsted inspections, however in July 2015, this rating was lowered to &#x27;inadequate&#x27;. In February 2017, this was raised to &#x27;Good&#x27;. In July 2022, the school was to be chosen to be part of the Government&#x27;s School Rebuilding Programme, which could involve a state-of-the-art rebuild or refurbishment to the derelict 1960s buildings.

==Religious sites==
Cramlington has a number of Christian churches of various denominations:

Methodist
* Doxford Place Methodist Church
* Welcome Methodist Church (formerly Station Terrace Methodist Church)

==Leisure==

===Leisure centre===
Cramlington&#x27;s main leisure centre, Concordia, is situated in the town centre adjacent to the shopping mall and was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in July 1977. It features a leisure pool, originally designed as an indoor tropical paradise, indoor football pitches, tennis, badminton and squash courts, as well as a climbing wall. It also includes a gymnasium, sauna, bowling green, bar and cafeteria. It was refurbished in 2008, particularly to improve disabled access. The pool was also refurbished in 2011. A major refurbishment began in 2016, with the addition of new facilities and the improvement of existing ones. Most recently, in 2019, a major pool refurbishment took place with changes including replacing the old pool lining and the swimming pool floor areas in the wet changing rooms and around the children&#x27;s poolside water features.

===Cycle paths===
A large cycle path network, completely separate from the road network, was a key part of the new town design. A cycle route also connects the town to the nearest beach, in Blyth. In March 2007, Blyth Valley Borough Council announced that the cycle network was to be extended to allow access to the neighbouring town of Bedlington.

The Shire is bordered by the Rural City of Benalla, the Shire of Baw Baw, the Shire of Murrindindi, the Shire of Yarra Ranges, the Shire of Strathbogie and the Shire of Wellington. There are two unincorporated areas within the shire; the areas around Mount Buller and Mount Stirling.

==Council==

===Current composition===

===Administration and governance===
The council meets in the council chambers at the council headquarters in the Mansfield Municipal Offices, which is also the location of the council&#x27;s administrative activities. It also provides customer services at its administrative centre in Mansfield.

==Townships and localities==
According to the 2021 census, the shire had a population of 10,178, compared to 8,584 in the 2016 census.

<text>The United Tasmania Group (UTG) was an Australian political party based in the state of Tasmania, which is generally acknowledged as the world&#x27;s first green party to contest elections. The party was formed on 23 March 1972, during a meeting of the Lake Pedder Action Committee (LPAC) at the Hobart Town Hall in order to field political candidates in the April 1972 state election.

==1970s==
UTG contested ten state and federal elections between 1972 and 1977, with the highest vote of 9.9% in the Legislative Council election with Rod Broadby in 1975 (see Appendix 4, UTG Journal Issue No. 6, 2021).

The United Tasmania Group&#x27;s first President was Dr Richard Jones and it lasted for five years, briefly reforming in 1990 for the federal election. A few of the 1970s candidates, including Bob Brown, went on to form the Tasmanian Greens and then ultimately, at the national level, the Australian Greens.

==2010s==
On 2 April 2016 following a meeting, former members of the party re-started the group.

The United Tasmania Group launched &quot;The UTG Journal&quot; in 2018. The journal is designed to cover a wide range of topics, including the development of conservation and other issues since that original founding date in April, 1972. Nine issues of &quot;The UTG Journal&quot; have been published since the re-start of the organisation in 2016.

==Histories and analysis==
In the mid 1990s Lance Armstrong wrote a history of the politics of Tasmania in the 1990s.
In the mid-2000s author Bill Lines also attempted to grapple with the broader scope of politics in Australia relative to greens politics in &quot;Patriots&quot;.
Meanwhile the 2017 Master&#x27;s Thesis of Canadian scholar Blake Allen produced an analysis of how the UTG, and their effect on Tasmanian politics, reshaped the Australian federal relationship in a favorable manner for successive national governments. In the late 2010s Paddy Manning researched and wrote a history of the Greens in Australia, and included the UTG in the first chapter, acknowledging the importance of the group within the larger context.

An unpublished Honours Thesis on the party by Pam Walker (University of Tasmania) was written in 1986, and the first chapter in Paddy Manning&#x27;s book, &quot;Inside the Greens&quot; (2019), is devoted to the history of the party.

<text>Electrolux AB () is a Swedish multinational home appliance manufacturer, headquartered in Stockholm. It is consistently ranked the world&#x27;s second largest appliance maker by units sold, after Whirlpool.

Electrolux products are sold under a variety of brand names (including its own), and are primarily major appliances and vacuum cleaners intended for home consumer use. Electrolux has a primary listing on the Stockholm Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the OMX Stockholm 30 index.

==History==

The company originates from a merger of two companies—Lux AB and Svenska Elektron AB, the former an established manufacturer and the latter a younger company founded by a former vacuum salesman who had also been an employee of the former firm. The origins of Electrolux are closely tied to the vacuum, but today it also makes major appliances.
Electrolux made an initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange in 1928 (it was delisted in 2010) and another on the Stockholm Stock Exchange in 1930.

 its shares trade on the NASDAQ OMX Nordic Market and over-the-counter. Electrolux is an OMX Nordic 40 constituent stock.

===Sales company to major manufacturer===
In 1919, a Svenska Elektron AB acquisition, Elektromekaniska AB, became Elektrolux (the spelling was changed to Electrolux in 1957). It initially sold Lux branded vacuum cleaners in several European countries.

In 1923, the company acquired AB Arctic and subsequently added absorption refrigerators to its product line. Other appliances soon followed, including washing machines in 1951, dishwashers in 1959, and food service equipment in 1962.

===Mergers and acquisitions===
The company has often and regularly expanded through mergers and acquisitions.

While Electrolux had bought several companies before the 1960s, that decade saw the beginnings of a new wave of M&amp;A activity. The company bought ElektroHelios, Norwegian Elektra, Danish Atlas, Finnish Slev, and Flymo, et al., in the nine years from 1960 to 1969. It sold its American subsidiary to Consolidated Foods and exited the American market in 1968, only returning in 1974 when Electrolux acquired Eureka-Williams from National Union, one of the oldest names in the vacuum cleaner industry. Electrolux sold its vacuum cleaners using the Eureka brand name in North America until 2004.

This style of growth continued through the 1990s, seeing Electrolux purchase scores of companies including, for a time, Husqvarna. 

, President and later chairman of the board, led the strategic core of an increasingly decentralized Electrolux—and was instrumental to its rapid growth.

While attempts to cut costs, centralise administration, and wring out economies of scale from Electrolux&#x27;s operations were made in the 1960s and 1970s with the focus so firmly on growth, further company-wide restructuring efforts only began in the late 1990s.

===2000 to present===
In North America, the Electrolux name was long used by vacuum cleaner manufacturer Aerus LLC, originally established to sell Swedish Electrolux products. In 2000, Aerus transferred trademark rights back to the Electrolux Group, and ceased using the Electrolux name in 2004.

Conversely, Electrolux-made vacuums carried the Eureka brand name, which Electrolux continued to use while also selling Electrolux branded vacuums after 2000. Electrolux USA customer service maintains a database of Electrolux made vacuums and provides a link to Aerus&#x27;s website for the convenience of owners of Electrolux branded Aerus vacuums.

Keith McLoughlin took over as president and CEO on January 1, 2011, and became the company&#x27;s first non Swedish chief executive.

In August 2011, Electrolux acquired from Sigdo Koppers the Chilean appliance manufacturer CTI obtaining several brands with the purchase including: Fensa, Gafa, Mademsa and Somela.

On February 6, 2017, Electrolux announced that it had agreed to acquire Anova Applied Electronics, Inc., the U.S.-based provider of the Anova Precision Cooker.

On March 23, 2020, Electrolux completed the spin-off of its professional division, which the separated company incorporated as Electrolux Professional AB.

In September 2023, it was announced Electrolux has sold its refrigerator manufacturing facility in Nyíregyháza to the Malmö-headquartered heat pump systems and technology company, Qvantum for €38 million.

==Slogan==
The company&#x27;s international slogan is &quot;Shape living for the better&quot;. In the past it was &quot;Thinking of you&quot;. 

In the 1960s the company successfully marketed vacuums in the United Kingdom with the slogan &quot;Nothing sucks like an Electrolux&quot;.
In the United States, it was frequently assumed that using this slogan was a brand blunder. In fact, the informal American meaning of the word sucks was already well known at the time in the United Kingdom, and the company hoped the slogan, with its possible double entendre, would gain attention. 

In Indonesia, the Electrolux previous slogan was &quot;Kalau saja semua seawet Electrolux&quot; (English: If only all are as durable as Electrolux).

<text>Iceland was historically divided into 23 counties known as &quot;sýslur&quot; (), and 23 independent towns known as &quot;kaupstaðir&quot; (). Iceland is now split up between 24 sýslumenn (magistrates) that are the highest authority over the local police (except in Reykjavík where there is a special office of police commissioner) and carry out administrative functions such as declaring bankruptcy and marrying people outside of the church. The jurisdictions of these magistrates often follow the lines of the historical counties, but not always. When speaking of these new &quot;administrative&quot; counties, the custom is to associate them with the county seats rather than using the names of the traditional counties, even when they cover the same area.

==Composition==
Independent towns (&quot;kaupstaðir&quot;) were first created in the 18th century as urbanisation began in Iceland; this practice continued into the 1980s. The last town that was declared an independent town was Ólafsvík in 1983. Since then, the laws regarding municipalities have been changed in such a way that there is no longer any distinction made between urban or rural municipalities.

===Historical counties===
The historical counties were:

*Árnessýsla (, )
*Austur-Barðastrandarsýsla (, )
*Austur-Húnavatnssýsla (, )
*Austur-Skaftafellssýsla (, )
*Borgarfjarðarsýsla (, )
*Dalasýsla (, )
*Eyjafjarðarsýsla (, )
*Gullbringusýsla (, )
*Kjósarsýsla (, )
*Mýrasýsla (, )
*Norður-Ísafjarðarsýsla (, )
*Norður-Múlasýsla (, )
*Norður-Þingeyjarsýsla (, )
*Rangárvallasýsla (, )
*Skagafjarðarsýsla (, )
*Snæfellsnes- og Hnappadalssýsla (, )
*Strandasýsla (, )
*Suður-Múlasýsla (, )

*Vestur-Barðastrandarsýsla (, )
*Vestur-Húnavatnssýsla (, )
*Vestur-Ísafjarðarsýsla (, )
*Vestur-Skaftafellssýsla (, )

<text>Lysias (; ; c. 445 – c. 380 BC) was a logographer (speech writer) in ancient Greece. He was one of the ten Attic orators included in the &quot;Alexandrian Canon&quot; compiled by Aristophanes of Byzantium and Aristarchus of Samothrace in the third century BC.

==Life==
According to Dionysius of Halicarnassus and the author of the life ascribed to Plutarch, Lysias was born in 459 BC, which would accord with a tradition that Lysias reached, or passed, the age of eighty. This date was evidently obtained by reckoning back from the foundation of Thurii (444 BC), since there was a tradition that Lysias had gone there at the age of fifteen. Modern critics, in general, place his birth later, c. 445 BC, and place the trip to Thurii around 430 BC.

Cephalus, his father, was a native of Syracuse, and on the invitation of Pericles had settled at Athens. The opening scene of Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot; is set at the house of Cephalus&#x27; eldest son, Polemarchus, in Piraeus. The tone of the picture warrants the inference that the Sicilian family were well known to Plato, and that their houses must often have been hospitable to such gatherings. Further, Plato&#x27;s &quot;Phaedrus&quot; opens with Phaedrus coming from conversation with Lysias at the house of Epicrates of Athens: he meets Socrates, with whom he will read and discuss the speech of Lysias he heard.

At Thurii, the colony newly planted on the Tarentine Gulf, the boy may have seen Herodotus, now a man in middle life, and a friendship may have grown up between them. There, too, Lysias is said to have commenced his studies in rhetoric—doubtless under a master of the Sicilian school possibly, as tradition said, under Tisias, the pupil of Corax, whose name is associated with the first attempt to formulate rhetoric as an art. The Athenian invasion of Sicily in 415–413 BC during the Peloponnesian War would ultimately create difficulties for Lysias&#x27;s family, especially when the campaign ended in a devastating defeat for Athens. The continued attempt to link Lysias to the famous names of the era is illustrated by the ancient ascription to Lysias of a rhetorical exercise purporting to be a speech in which the captive Athenian general Nicias appealed for mercy to the Sicilians. The terrible blow to Athens quickened the energies of an anti-Athenian faction at Thurii. Lysias and his elder brother Polemarchus, with three hundred other persons, were accused of Atticizing. They were driven from Thurii and settled at Athens (412 BC).

Lysias and Polemarchus were rich men, having inherited property from their father, Cephalus; and Lysias claims that, though merely resident aliens, they discharged public services with a liberality which shamed many of those who enjoyed the franchise (&quot;Against Eratosthenes&quot; xii.20). The fact that they owned house property shows that they were classed as &quot;isoteleis&quot; (), i.e. foreigners who paid only the same tax as citizens, being exempt from the special tax (μετοίκιον) on resident aliens. Polemarchus occupied a house in Athens itself, Lysias another in the Piraeus, near which was their shield factory, employing a hundred and twenty skilled slaves.

In 404 BC, the Thirty Tyrants were established at Athens under the protection of a Spartan garrison. One of their earliest measures was an attack upon the resident aliens, who were represented as disaffected to the new government. Lysias and Polemarchus were on a list of ten singled out to be the first victims. Polemarchus was arrested and compelled to drink hemlock. Lysias had a narrow escape, with the help of a large bribe. He slipped by a back-door out of the house in which he was a prisoner and took a boat to Megara. It appears that he rendered valuable services to the exiles during the reign of the tyrants, and in 403 Thrasybulus proposed that these services be recognised by the bestowal of the citizenship. The Boule, however, had not yet been reconstituted, and hence the measure could not be introduced to the ecclesia by the requisite preliminary resolution (προβούλευμα). On this ground, it was successfully opposed.

During his later years, Lysias—now probably a comparatively poor man owing to the rapacity of the tyrants and his own generosity to the Athenian exiles—appears as a hard-working member of a new profession—that of logographer, a writer of speeches to be delivered in the law courts. The thirty-four extant are but a small fraction. From 403 to about 380 BC, his industry must have been incessant. The notices of his personal life in these years are scanty. In 403 he came forward as the accuser of Eratosthenes, one of the Thirty Tyrants. This was his only direct contact with Athenian politics. The story that he wrote a defence for Socrates, which the latter declined to use, probably arose from a confusion. Several years after the death of Socrates, the sophist Polycrates composed a declamation against him, to which Lysias replied.

A more authentic tradition represents Lysias as having spoken his own Olympiacus at the Olympic festival of 388 BC, to which Dionysius I of Syracuse had sent a magnificent embassy. Tents embroidered with gold were pitched within the sacred enclosure, and the wealth of Dionysius was vividly shown by the number of chariots which he had entered. Lysias lifted up his voice to denounce Dionysius as, next to Artaxerxes, the worst enemy of Hellas, and to impress upon the assembled Greeks that one of their foremost duties was to deliver Sicily from a hateful oppression. The latest work of Lysias which can be dated (a fragment of a speech &quot;For Pherenicus&quot;) belongs to 381 or 380 BC. He probably died in or soon after 380 BC.

==Style==

Lysias displays literary tact, humour, and attention to character in his extant speeches, and is famous for using his skill to conceal his art. It was obviously desirable that a speech written for delivery by a client should be suitable to his age, station and circumstances. Lysias was the first to make this adaptation truly artistic. His language is crafted to flow easily, in contrast to his predecessor Antiphon&#x27;s pursuit of majestic emphasis, to his pupil (and close follower in many respects) Isaeus&#x27; more conspicuous display of artistry and more strictly logical manner of argumentation, and later to the forceful oratory of Demosthenes.

Translated into terms of ancient criticism, he became the model of the plain style (: &quot;genus tenue&quot; or &quot;subtile&quot;). Greek and then Roman critics distinguished three styles of rhetorical composition—the grand (or elaborate), the plain and the middle, the plain being nearest to the language of daily life. Greek rhetoric began in the grand style; then Lysias set an exquisite pattern of the plain; and Demosthenes might be considered as having effected an almost ideal compromise.

The vocabulary of Lysias is relatively simple and would later be regarded as a model of pure diction for Atticists. Most of the rhetorical figures are sparingly used—except such as consist in the parallelism or opposition of clauses. The taste of the day not yet emancipated from the influence of the Sicilian rhetoric probably demanded a large use of antithesis. Lysias excels in vivid description; he has also the knack of marking the speaker&#x27;s character by light touches. The structure of his sentences varies a good deal according to the dignity of the subject. He has equal command over the periodic style (κατεστραμμένη λέξις) and the non-periodic or continuous (εἰρομένη, διαλελυμένη). His disposition of his subject-matter is always simple. The speech has usually four parts: introduction (προοίμιον), narrative of facts (διήγησις), proofs (πίστεις), which may be either external, as from witnesses, or internal, derived from argument on the facts, and, lastly, conclusion (ἐπίλογος).

It is in the introduction and the narrative that Lysias is seen at his best. In his greatest extant speech—that &quot;Against Eratosthenes&quot;—and also in the fragmentary &quot;Olympiacus&quot;, he has pathos and fire; but these were not characteristic qualities of his work. In Cicero&#x27;s judgment (&quot;De Orat.&quot; iii. 7, 28) Demosthenes was peculiarly distinguished by force (&quot;vis&quot;), Aeschines by resonance (&quot;sonitus&quot;); Hypereides by acuteness (&quot;acumen&quot;); Isocrates by sweetness (&quot;suavitas&quot;); the distinction which he assigns to Lysias is &quot;subtilitas&quot;, an Attic refinement—which, as he elsewhere says (&quot;Brutus&quot;, 16, 64) is often joined to an admirable vigour (&quot;lacerti&quot;). Nor was it oratory alone to which Lysias rendered service; his work had an important effect on all subsequent Greek prose, by showing how perfect elegance could be joined to plainness. Here, in his artistic use of familiar idiom, he might fairly be called the Euripides of Attic prose. His style has attracted interest from modern readers, because it is employed in describing scenes from the everyday life of Athens.

==Works==

===Table of extant speeches===
From Lysias we have thirty-four speeches. Three fragmentary ones have come down under the name of Lysias; one hundred and twenty-seven more, now lost, are known from smaller fragments or from titles. In the Augustan age four hundred and twenty-five works bore his name, of which more than two hundred were allowed as genuine by the critics.

The table below shows the name of the speech (in the ordered listed in the Lamb translation), the suggested date of the speech, the primary rhetorical mode, the main point of the speech, and comments. Forensic is synonymous with &quot;judicial&quot; and denotes speeches made in law courts. Epideictic is &quot;ceremonial&quot; and involves the praise or, less often, the criticism, of the subject. Deliberative denotes speeches made in legislatures. Notes (e.g., A1, B3, etc.) refer to the list of qualifications below the table.

NOTES &quot;A&quot;: FORENSIC, RELATING TO PUBLIC CASES
# Relating to Offences directly against the State (); such as treason, malversation in office, embezzlement of public moneys.
# Cases relating to Unconstitutional Procedure ()
# Cases relating to *Claims for Money withheld from the State ().
# Cases relating to a Scrutiny (δοκιμασία); especially the Scrutiny, by the Senate, of Officials Designate
# Cases relating to Military Offences ()
# Cases relating to Murder or Intent to Murder ()
# Cases relating to Impiety ()

NOTES &quot;B&quot;: FORENSIC, RELATING TO PRIVATE CASES
# Action for Libel (δίκη κακηγορίας)
# Action by a Ward against a Guardian ()
# Trial of a Claim to Property (διαδικασία)
# Answer to a Special Plea ()

=== Miscellaneous ===
To his Companions, a Complaint of Slanders, viii. (certainly spurious).

The speech attributed to Lysias in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Phaedrus&quot; 230e–234. This speech has generally been regarded as Plato&#x27;s own work; but the certainty of this conclusion will be doubted by those who observe:
*the elaborate preparations made in the dialogue for a recital of the &quot;erōtikos&quot; which shall be verbally exact,
*the closeness of the criticism made upon it.
If the satirist were merely analysing his own composition, such criticism would have little point. Lysias is the earliest writer who is known to have composed &quot;erōtikoi&quot;; it is as representing both rhetoric and a false &quot;erōs&quot; that he is the object of attack in the &quot;Phaedrus&quot;. Stylistic differences between the speech and the rest of the &quot;Phaedrus&quot; have also been taken to suggest that the speech was genuine.

===Fragments===
Three hundred and fifty-five of these are collected by Hermann Sauppe, &quot;Oratores Attici&quot;, ii. 170–216. Two hundred and fifty-two of them represent one hundred and twenty-seven speeches of known title; and of six the fragments are comparatively large. Of these, the fragmentary speech &quot;For Pherenicus&quot; belongs to 381 or 380 BC, and is thus the latest known work of Lysias. In literary and historical interest, the first place among the extant speeches of Lysias belongs to that &quot;Against Eratosthenes&quot; (403 BC), one of the Thirty Tyrants, whom Lysias arraigns as the murderer of his brother Polemarchus. The speech is an eloquent and vivid picture of the reign of terror which the Thirty established at Athens; the concluding appeal, to both parties among the citizens, is specially powerful.

Next in importance is the speech &quot;Against Agoratus&quot; (388 BC), one of our chief authorities for the internal history of Athens during the months which immediately followed the defeat at Aegospotami. The Olympiacus (388 BC) is a brilliant fragment, expressing the spirit of the festival at Olympia, and exhorting Greeks to unite against their common foes. &quot;The Plea for the Constitution&quot; (403 BC) is interesting for the manner in which it argues that the well-being of Athens—now stripped of empire—is bound up with the maintenance of democratic principles. The speech &quot;For Mantitheus&quot; (392 BC) is a graceful and animated portrait, of a young Athenian &quot;hippeus&quot;, making a spirited defence of his honor against the charge of disloyalty. The defence &quot;For the&quot; &quot;Invalid&quot; is a humorous character-sketch. The speech &quot;Against Pancleon&quot; illustrates the intimate relations between Athens and Plataea, while it gives us some picturesque glimpses of Athenian town life. The defence of the person who had, been charged with destroying a &quot;mona&quot;, or sacred olive, places us amidst the country life of Attica. And the speech &quot;Against Theomnestus&quot; deserves attention for its curious evidence of the way in which the ordinary vocabulary of Athens had changed between 600 and 400 BC.

<text>Skandia is a Swedish financial services corporation that provides insurance, banking and asset management services.

Between 2006 and 2015, the financial group underwent major changes. From an insurance company with the main emphasis on non-life insurance to a business that is globally focused on savings, to once again becoming a Nordic banking and insurance group with a focus on security and long-term savings. In February 2006, the South African company Old Mutual took over the majority of shares in the company. In March 2012, Skandia Liv bought Skandia&#x27;s Nordic operations back from Old Mutual and decided to transform Skandia into a customer-owned, mutual company retaining the Skandia name.

== History ==
Skandia started out as a Swedish insurance company in 1855. It would go on to operates in Europe, Latin America, and Asia. Skandia also operated an internet bank called Skandiabanken in the Nordic region.

In 1979, the company formed a UK subsidiary, Skandia Life.

In 2003, the operations in North America, American Skandia, were acquired by Prudential Financial. The CEO of American Skandia, Wade Dokken partnered with Goldman Sachs and sold the division to Prudential Financial for $1.2 billion.

In 2005 South African financial services group Old Mutual launched a $6.5bn (£3.6bn) bid to acquire majority control of Skandia, which was met with resistance from some of Skandia&#x27;s shareholders and directors. On 3 February 2006 Old Mutual completed its acquisition of Skandia, which was subsequently delisted from the Stockholm and London stock exchanges.

, Skandia&#x27;s largest operation, in terms of new business and profit, was the United Kingdom which was launched back in 1979. Their UK headquarters was &quot;Skandia House&quot; in Southampton. Skandia in the UK, along with Old Mutual Global Investors, formed Old Mutual Wealth. As well as in the UK, Old Mutual Wealth had operations in Europe and various international markets, overseeing £78.5 billion in customer investments. Paul Feeney was the Chief Executive Officer of Old Mutual Wealth.

In March 2012 Old Mutual sold the Nordic businesses (Sweden, Denmark, Norway) to the Swedish-based Skandia Liv, a partly mutual assurer, in an all-cash deal for £2.1bn. Skandia UK, Skandia International and the Skandia European businesses outside the Nordic region were rebranded as &#x27;Old Mutual Wealth&#x27; in September 2014.

== Operations ==
Following the sale of Skandia in Sweden, Denmark and Norway, the Skandia brand operates independently of Old Mutual.

== Sponsorships ==
Skandia UK was the title sponsor of the world’s largest sailing regatta, Cowes Week, held on the Isle of Wight, UK for 14 years, ending its association in 2008. From April 2006 to March 2013, Skandia UK was the title sponsor of the British sailing team, Skandia Team GBR. The team competed in the Olympic and Paralympic classes and included multiple Olympic gold medal winners such as Ben Ainslie and Iain Percy.

Skandia Poland sponsors the Skandia Marathon, a cycling event organised by Langteam in which over 1000 competitors, aged from 4 to 80 years old, take part.

Skandia International, which specialises in offshore investment, sponsors the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club and partners the United Arab Emirates Professional Golf Association in Singapore.

== Rebranding ==

Following Old Mutual&#x27;s takeover, Skandia announced it would be &quot;going green&quot; and underwent a rebranding from January 2008. The company announced that it would take 18 months for the rebranding to complete, with the UK and offshore division being first. The old logo was replaced with a new one to be more in-line with Old Mutual&#x27;s colours.

Following Old Mutual’s sale the Nordic businesses (Sweden, Denmark, Norway) in March 2012 to the Swedish-based Skandia Liv, a partly mutual assurer, Skandia UK, Skandia International and the Skandia European businesses outside the Nordic region were rebranded as &#x27;Old Mutual Wealth&#x27; in September 2014.

== Criticisms ==
Controversy surrounded Skandia in the mid-nineties, mostly due to illegal internal affairs with the Swedish Skandia Life, and for having provided executives with subsidized apartments in Stockholm. The involved executives are among others Lars-Eric Petersson and Ulf Spång. The Skandia trademark and reputation were tainted in Sweden during this time. It was alleged in late 2003 that executives at Skandia had embezzled 13 billion Swedish kronor. Subsequently, the board had to resign and, in 2006, Lars-Eric Petersson was sentenced to two years in prison. However, the case was later appealed to a higher court.

On 19 December 2007, the Court of Appeal dismissed all charges against Lars-Eric Petersson.

The charges by the prosecutor proceeded from the prerequisite that the payments from Skandia’s bonus program, called Wealthbuilder, to the beneficiaries were limited to an amount of SEK 300 million during the time period 1 January 1998 – 31 December 1999. According to the prosecutor, Lars-Eric Petersson had, without the consent of the Board, removed the cap on the bonus programme by signing a document named Appendix 3, and thus causing payments of additionally approx. SEK 156 million to the beneficiaries. According to the Court of Appeal, the prosecutor was not able to prove that the limitation for Wealthbuilder was still in force when Lars-Eric Petersson signed Appendix 3 in December 2000. The charges were therefore dismissed. (Translation of the press release from the Svea Court of Appeal)

On 26 March 2010, the former legal head of Skandia Germany, Michael Wolski, was prosecuted for tax fraud of the Cezanowski family (about EUR 50 million which Michael Wolski cashed in) for 2 years and 6 months jail in Darmstadt, Germany. His wife Karin Wolski, who is a high court judge, resigned on the same day. His wife is driving among others a Bugatti Veyron, which was bought from the &quot;stolen&quot; money.

<text>Berettyóújfalu is a town in Hajdú-Bihar county, in center of the Northern Great Plain region of eastern Hungary, near the border with Romania. It is strategically located, being 35 km south of Debrecen, the second largest city in Hungary, and 40 km west of Oradea, the tenth largest city in Romania. Berettyóújfalu is named after the river Berettyó.

==Geography==
It covers an area of and has a population of about 15,000 people.

==History==
This area has been inhabited since ancient times. A lot of artifacts from the late Bronze Age were found in the town area. In the Iron Age, Scythians, Sarmatians, Celts and Huns conquered this area one after another.

After the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin (C.E. 9–10th century) 14–15 villages came to be in this area where semi-nomad farming took place. The villages were built on the top of the hills, because this area was a huge swamp. People used boats to travel between the hills. Every settlement had at least one port.

The center of the villages was named Herpály. The first written mention of the village was the Regestrum Varadi in the 13th century. Herpály was important because of a Romanesque monastery (built in the 12th century). The village and the monastery were destroyed twice. No written records have survived about the monastery after the Mongol invasion of Europe (C.E. 1241–1242. in Hungary). At the first half of the 19th century the height of the walls was 8–12 meters (26–32 ft). Each of the two towers stood, until a local landowner demolished the north tower, because it was life-threatening. The bricks were offered to the base structure of the Reformed Church&#x27;s organ. The ruin of the tower is called &quot;csonkatorony&quot; (lit. crooked tower) by the locals. The south tower and only its foundation is visible today.

Herpály had four streets in 1418, according to degree possession of sharing. The village had three pubs: one had a guestroom, the others had cellars. The estimated number of villagers was fewer than 300 people.

At the other bank of river Berettyó was a notable village, named Berettyószentmárton. It was a custom and tow place. In 1481 Matthias Corvinus (King of Hungary) donated right to hold markets for the settlement.

Herpály lamentable chronicle began in 1658, when Crimean Tatars burned the Berettyó-valley. The settlements was not completely destroyed, but Invasion Szejdi in 1660 certainly dispels the residents here.

Gábor Báthory (Prince of Transylvania, from 1608 to 1613) gave privilege for Berettyóújfalu on 23 May 1608, but it lost that privilege in the same century.

Significant changes happened in the landscape in the middle of the 19th century. The old &quot;water world&quot; disappeared when the river regulation had finished. The Püspökladány - Nagyvárad (later Oradea) railway line was built in 1858. It passes over Berettyóújfalu and gave dynamism to the development of the economy.

In the 1920s, with a new county hall, elementary school, hospital, official site built, Berettyóújfalu was the county seat of Bihar county between 1920 and 1940, and 1945–1950, because Oradea was annexed to Romania, after the Treaty of Trianon (4 June 1920). Later the government created Hajdú-Bihar County. From this time the county seat was Debrecen.

The catchment area is still large, the town is an important transport, economic and cultural center. There are five elementary and three high schools, a mill, a reconditioned spa, a regional hospital and major medical centers. Berettyóújfalu and Berettyószentmárton merged in 1970, and received city status in 1978.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

<text>Atlas Copco (&quot;Copco&quot; from Compagnie Pneumatique Commerciale) is a Swedish multinational industrial company that was founded in 1873. It manufactures industrial tools and equipment.

The Atlas Copco Group is a global industrial group of companies headquartered in Nacka, Sweden. In 2019, global revenues totaled , and by the end of that year, the company employed about 38,774 people. The firm&#x27;s shares are listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange and both &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;B&#x27; classes form part of the benchmark OMXS30 index.

Atlas Copco companies develop, manufacture, service, and rent industrial tools, air compressors (of which it is the world&#x27;s leading producer), construction and assembly systems. The Group operates in four areas: Compressor Technology, Vacuum Technology, Power Technology and Industrial Technology.

== History ==
=== Early development ===
AB Atlas, as it was previously named, was founded by Edvard Fränckel, who was a Swedish industrialist, politician and senior official at the Swedish State Railways. The company was established along with Andre O. Wallenberg, Johan W. Arnberg, Carl G. Cervin and Fredrik Didro.

In its inauguration phase, Atlas dealt with the manufacturing, purchasing and selling of material for railway construction and operations. After the recession in the 1880s, Atlas diversified its products and branched off into locomotives, central heating and tool machinery. In 1899, Atlas began developing their first air compressors and established itself as a compressor manufacturer. As older production branches started phasing out, Atlas teamed up with Diesel Motors in 1917, and the new company, Atlas Diesel, emerged with two primary divisions: diesel engines and compressor air products.

=== War-time development ===
The Atlas Diesel merger experienced significant growth during the First World War and towards the end of the war, the export was 40–50 % of production. The depression years caused significant losses for the company, which led to several financial reconstructions in the 1920s and 1930s.

During the Second World War, manufacturing capabilities were developed. The &quot;Swedish method&quot; influenced the firm&#x27;s pneumatic program, consisting of lightweight rock drills and drill bits with carbide tips. In 1948, the company terminated its diesel manufacturing and the name &quot;Atlas Diesel&quot; was no longer pertinent. The name Atlas Copco became official in 1955 and was inspired by the Belgian subsidiary Compagnie Pneumatique Commerciale (Trading Pneumatic Company).

===Post-war international expansion===
The acquisition of the Belgian compressor company Arpic Engineering in 1956, was the firm&#x27;s first major international acquisition. Eventually, Arpic&#x27;s plants carried out the majority of Atlas Copco&#x27;s compressor production. In 1960, the company purchased Craelius. In the 1970s, a number of strategic acquisitions were made, including the French compressor manufacturer Mauguière. In order to strengthen their position in the United States, several strategic acquisitions were made in the airpower business, including the key purchase of Worthington Compressors.

They purchased Chicago Pneumatic Tools in 1987. In 1992, AEG Elektrowerkzeuge was purchased, and in 1995, Milwaukee Electric Tool was acquired. In 2004, Milwaukee Electric Tool was sold to a Hong Kong-based manufacturer, Techtronic Industries. In 1997, Atlas Copco purchased Prime Service Corporation, which was the largest machine leasing company in the United States. The North American Rental Service Corporation was purchased in 1999.

== Business areas ==

Since 2017, Atlas Copco has had four main business areas: Compressor Technique, Vacuum Technique, Industrial Technique and Power Technique.

===Compressor Technique===
Atlas Copco&#x27;s Compressor Technique area creates products such as industrial compressors, oil and gas treatment equipment, air management systems, and gas and process compressor and expanders. The products are mainly used in the manufacturing, oil, gas and process industries.

===Vacuum Technique===
Atlas Copco&#x27;s Vacuum Technique business area provides vacuum products, exhaust management systems, valves and related products mainly under the Edwards, Leybold and Atlas Copco brands. The main markets served are semiconductors, chemical processing industries, food packaging and paper handling. Principal product development and manufacturing units are located in the United Kingdom, Czech Republic, Germany, South Korea, the United States, China and Japan.

===Industrial Technique===
Atlas Copco&#x27;s products in Industrial Technique are mainly developed for the automotive and aerospace industries, but are also used in industrial manufacturing, maintenance and vehicle service. Products manufactured include assembly systems, industrial power tools, quality assurance products and various types of software.

===Power Technique===
This area produces portable compressors, lighting towers, pumps, generators, paving equipment, compaction equipment, demolition tools and construction tools for infrastructure projects. These include civil works, road construction, gas and oil, and drilling construction projects.

== Operations ==
Atlas Copco manufactures critical equipment components in-house and cooperates with business partners for non-critical components. Approximately 75% of the production cost of equipment represents purchased components and around 25% are internally manufactured core components, assembly costs and overhead. Equipment represents less than 64% of revenues and the manufacturing of equipment is primarily based on customer orders. Only some standard, high-volume equipment is manufactured based on projected demand.

Atlas Copco has customer centres in about 71 countries and sales in about 180 countries. Sales and service are primarily direct but also channeled through alternative sales mechanisms, e.g. distributors. Sales of equipment are performed by engineers and service and maintenance are performed by technicians. Service is the responsibility of divisions in each business area. The responsibility includes the development of service products, sales and marketing, technical support, service delivery and follow-up. About 36% of revenues are generated from services (spare parts, maintenance, repairs, consumables, accessories and rental).

=== Brands ===

The Atlas Copco Group has dozens of brands around the world, including Chicago Pneumatic for compressors and tools, Edwards for vacuums, BeaconMedeas for medical gas and SCA &amp; Henrob for automotive assembly.

Notable brands include:
* Chicago Pneumatic
* Desoutter Tools
* Edwards
* Leybold GmbH

=== Structure===
Atlas Copco&#x27;s operations are organized into four business areas and more than 20 divisions. The organization has both operating units and legal units. Each operating unit has a business board. The duty of a business board is to serve as an advisory and decision-making body on strategic operational issues. It also ensures the implementation of controls and assessments. Each legal company has a legal board focusing on compliance and the legal structure of the group.&lt;ref name=&quot;atlascopcogroup.com/investor-relations&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Atlas Copco decided on a split and formed Epiroc AB which will focus on customers in the mining, infrastructure and natural resources segments. Epiroc is a fully independent company.

=== Innovation ===

Atlas Copco conducts research and development in a wide range of technologies at their global research centres, where each division has its own individual area of focus and resources. Training and workshops have been rolled out in customer centres and product companies globally. The company puts its focus on growth in automation to bring more production back to the US and Europe. In 2020, Atlas Copco acquired Isra Vision in February and Perceptron in September to automate more. In March 2022, Atlas Copco acquired the assets of Ceres Technologies, a US-based manufacturer and designer of gas and vapour delivery equipment for the semiconductor industry.

<doc id="493182" wikidata="Q2146870" url="?curid=493182" title="Kinderwhore">
<text>Kinderwhore is a fashion style most notably worn by some female grunge and alternative rock musicians in the US during the early to mid-1990s. The style is characterized through the combination of cute, feminine fashion items like babydoll and Peter Pan collared dresses, with more adult aspects like smudged red lipstick and dark eye makeup. It has its origins in the mid-1980s band Pagan Babies, which featured future Babes in Toyland vocalist/guitarist Kat Bjelland and future Hole vocalist/guitarist Courtney Love, who lived together and shared clothes. Following the band&#x27;s disbandment, the two&#x27;s subsequent bands achieved significant mainstream success and led to the fashion being popularised amongst the general public and being referenced by high fashion designers including Marc Jacobs.

==Fashion==
Kinderwhore fashion is based around a childlike fashion silhouette and accessories in combination with punk fashion&#x27;s &quot;rips and tears&quot;. Common items include torn, ripped tight or low-cut babydoll and Peter-Pan-collared dresses, slips, knee-socks, heavy makeup with dark eyeliner, slip dresses, ripped tights, bleached hair, smudged red lipstick, lingerie, cardigans, barrettes, and leather boots or Mary Jane shoes.

Mish Way described it as &quot;intentionally taking the most constraining parts of the feminine, good-girl aesthetic, inflating them to a cartoon level, and subverting them to kill any ingrained insecurities.&quot; She further noted that although the look was very feminine, when its exponents performed onstage they &quot;stood tall and confident, they threw their guitars around like weapons, and screamed out whip-smart feminist lyrics. These women were questioning the cultural importance of typical beauty through costume and the stage.&quot; Fashion academic Morna Laing likened the style to a same-sex form of drag by &quot;exaggerating the contradictory demands of ideal femininity; betraying its constructed-ness; subverting it from within&quot;.

Interviewed in 1994, Love commented:

== History ==

In the mid–1980s, musicians Kat Bjelland and Courtney Love shared an apartment together while playing in the band Pagan Babies. During this time, the pair would often borrow one another&#x27;s clothes. Both are generally credited by publications including &quot;i-D&quot;, &quot;the Guardian&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as inventing the kinderwhore fashion style, however both dispute the other&#x27;s involvement. In interviews, Love credited the inspiration for the style as coming from KatieJane Garside of Daisy Chainsaw and Christine Amphlett of Divinyls. Furthermore, during this period, many of the style&#x27;s prominent characteristics such as vintage clothing, velvet and 1970s polyester were cheap and easily accessible. &quot;i-D&quot; observed that the name &quot;kinderwhore&quot; was coined by &quot;Melody Maker&quot; journalist Everett True, whereas &quot;the Guardian&quot; credited the term to Bjelland.

Following the 1987 disbandment of Pagan Babies, Bjelland formed Babes in Toyland and Love formed Hole, and both continued to sport this look. In the 1990s, these groups received significant mainstream success. As early as 1992, the style was beginning to slip into mainstream and high fashion, with Perry Ellis&#x27; 1992 &quot;Grunge&quot; collection, by Marc Jacobs embracing elements of kinderwhore. &quot;The Guardian&quot; specifically cited the 1994 music video for Hole&#x27;s song &quot;Miss World&quot; as when &quot;The look went viral.&quot; Soon, major fashion magazines like &quot;Seventeen&quot; and &quot;Sassy&quot; featured editorials on how to achieve the look.

=== Legacy ===
With the rise of the soft grunge fashion trend in the 2010s, kinderwhore received a revived interest. Meadham Kirchhoff&#x27;s spring/summer 2012 collection was inspired by the style, with its runway show being opened by introducing a group of women dressed as Courtney Love during Hole 1996 Reading Festival performance, with Jeremy Scott&#x27;s fall/winter 2014 collection and Yves Saint Laurent&#x27;s Resort 2016 collections also embracing this influence. Furthermore, brand including Urban Outfitters, Forever 21 and Free People began putting an emphasis on many of the items that defined kinderwhore fashion, as did Kanye West and Kim Kardashian&#x27;s childrenswear collection the Kids Supply.
In 2019 designer Batsheva Hay cited Courtney Love&#x27;s &quot;kinderwhore aesthetic&quot; as inspiration. Hay said Love&#x27;s look &quot;was so of that time but she was also so ahead of her time&quot;.

The style received a minor revival in the early 2020s through videos posted on the video sharing application TikTok and mainstream musicians including Olivia Rodrigo taking influence from its aesthetics for her debut album &quot;Sour&quot; (2021). The 2020 novel &quot;Dead Rock Stars&quot; by the English author Guy Mankowski depicts a fictional Kinderwhore band called Cherub, whose lead singer Emma draws from the Kinderwhore aesthetic of &#x27;Hollywood glamour of tiaras and satin dresses... with a twisted, girlish sensibility.&#x27; Mankowski added, &#x27;I was influenced by the urge that such artists had to use their body to offer a message, with them making the very most of the textual space that comes with being in a band.&#x27;

Lock Factory Lock Factory Corp.&quot; (first Corp. and Låsfabriken from Swedish, last Lukkotehdas and Corp. from Finnish).

<text>Autoliv is a Swedish automotive safety supplier headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden, and incorporated in Delaware, United States as Autoliv, Inc. It is the world’s largest automotive safety system supplier, producing systems such as airbags, seatbelts, and steering wheels for automotive manufacturers. Autoliv&#x27;s name combines &quot;auto&quot; for automobiles, and &quot;liv&quot; {‘li:v} the Swedish word for &quot;life&quot;.

Together with its joint ventures, Autoliv has over 68,000 employees in 27 countries, of whom 5,700 are involved in research, development and engineering. In addition, the company has 14 technical centers around the world, including 20 test tracks.

The group is among the largest Tier 1 automotive suppliers in the world, with annual revenues exceeding US$8 billion, and is part of the Fortune 500, ranking #289 in 2018. The company&#x27;s shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and its Swedish Depository Receipts on the Nasdaq Stockholm.

==History==
Autoliv was founded in Vårgårda, Sweden in the form of Auto Service AB in 1953 by Lennart Lindblad. In 1956, the company became a pioneer in seat belt technology when it began production of two-point seat belts. The name of the company was changed to Autoliv AB in 1968. It was bought in 1974 by Granges Weda AB, inventors of the retractable seat belt. Granges Weda was acquired in turn in 1989 by Electrolux and changed its name to Electrolux Autoliv AB. During the 1980s and 1990s, the company grew through acquisitions, mainly in Europe. Between 1994 and 1997 the company was listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange under the name of Autoliv AB and in 1997 it merged with the American firm Morton ASP Inc to form Autoliv Inc. In June 2018, the company spun off its Electronics business into a separate company Veoneer Inc.

In March 2019 Autoliv was fined €121 million by the European Commission for participating in two cartels that violated EU antitrust rules. The company, along with TRW and Takata, coordinated the supply of seatbelts, airbags, and steering wheels to Volkswagen Group and BMW Group from 2007 to 2011. Autoliv received a 30% reduction in its fine under the Leniency Notice and an additional 10% reduction for acknowledging its involvement. This case was part of a broader investigation into anti-competitive practices in the automotive parts sector, which resulted in total fines of €2.15 billion.

In November 2019, Autoliv selected Fredrik Westin as Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, succeeding Interim CFO Christian Hanke.

==Products==

The company develops, manufactures and markets safety systems (estimated market share of approximately 42% in 2020) such as airbags, seatbelts, steering wheels, and passive safety electronics. It also produces pedestrian protection systems.

<doc id="493199" wikidata="Q7623537" url="?curid=493199" title="Streynsham Master">
<text>[[Sir]] Streynsham Master (28 October 1640 – 28 April 1724) was an English colonial administrator who was one of the 17th-century pioneers of the English East India Company. He served as the Agent of Madras from 27 January 1678 to 3 July 1681, and is credited with having introduced the first administrative reforms in the Madras Government. He banned sati and prohibited the burning of a Hindu widow in 1680 in what is the first official British response to sati. He made English the sole official language and language of court in the Madras Presidency, replacing the
Portuguese, Tamil and Malayalam languages.

Returning to England, in 1692 he bought the Codnor Castle estate and for the rest of his life divided his time between Derbyshire and London.

== Early career ==

Streynsham Master had a distinguished career in the East India Company (EIC) right from his early days. He served as the Acting President of the company&#x27;s factory (trading post) at Surat during the visit of the factory&#x27;s President Gerald Aungier to the new colony at Bombay. After the return of Aungier, Master served for some time as a member of the EIC Council. In 1670 he led the English in the successful defence of his company in Surat against the Marathas. In 1676, even before the then Agent Sir William Langhorne&#x27;s removal from power, Master was nominated in advance as the next Agent of Madras in the case of emergency. In the meantime, until the end of Langhorne&#x27;s tenure, Master served for a time as the Agent of the company&#x27;s factory at Masulipatnam and then Bengal, where he was tasked with introducing a new administrative system for the factories on the Hooghly River; lastly he was sent back to Fort St. George to take office as the second member of the EIC Council.

== Tenure as Agent of Madras ==

=== Shivaji&#x27;s Campaign ===

In August 1678, the Maratha Emperor Shivaji sent an army of 1,500 horse to capture Poonamallee. While the Maratha army camped near Kanchipuram, news reached the Council at Fort St George by means of the company&#x27;s spies that the Marathas intended to proceed upon Madras, Sadras and Pulicat. However, the information proved to be false as the Maratha troops immediately returned to the north from whence they came after the siege of Poonamallee.

=== Foundation of St Mary&#x27;s Church ===

The foundations of St Mary&#x27;s church, the oldest Anglican church in Madras, were laid during the Agency of Streynsham Master. The foundation of the church was laid on Lady Day, 1678. The construction of the church was completed in two and a half years and it opened on 28 October 1680.

=== Lingappa Naik&#x27;s Demands ===

In August 1678 Lingappa Naik, the Naik of Poonamallee, demanded a large sum of money from the EIC. The company&#x27;s merchant, Kasi Veeranna (Casa Verona), declined and sent him a harsh reply. A month later, when Lingappa visited Kasi Veeranna to express his condolences on the death of the former&#x27;s wife, he asked the latter the reason why the Agent had not sent anyone to receive. To this Kasi Veeranna delivered an extremely arrogant reply which left the Naik fuming with anger.

When Kasi Veeranna died in 1680, Lingappa sent a Havildar named Shakeel Ahmed to take over the settlement of Madras from the company. He was promptly arrested by the company&#x27;s troops and dispatched across the frontier. Following this act by the English, Lingappa blockaded Madras and prevented goods and supplies from entering the settlement. He demanded that the English agree to pay him an annual tribute of 2,000 pagodas in order to lift the embargo. At one point of time, the situation became so serious that the Directors of the Council even contemplated the thought of moving the company&#x27;s factory to Gingee. Neither food nor fuel could be obtained, and the inhabitants starved.

On 9 April 1681 Lieutenant Richardson was sent with fifty of the company&#x27;s troops to Gingee. Richardson reached the village of Khandur and besieged the town. At about midnight, Richardson took the town and drove away the Polygar. The required amount of provisions were obtained and transported back to Madras.

On 3 July 1681 Streynsham Master was replaced with William Gyfford as the Agent of Madras.

=== Reforms ===

The population of Madras had increased to the point that it seemed difficult to retain the old Choultry courts. Hence, in 1678, the Government of Fort St George set up a judiciary with the Agent and the members of the council as judges. Two English Choultry judges were appointed to hear cases concerning their Indian subjects.

Master is credited with having introduced the role of a scavenger who was required to remove the dirt and filth of the streets. Scavengers were also empowered to collect the house-tax and other taxes. Watchmen were appointed to guard the settlement at night. Taverns, hotels, entertainment-houses and theatres had to be licensed.

==Family==

He was the son of Richard Master of East Langdon, near Dover, Kent. He married Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Legh of Lyme Hall, Cheshire with whom he had two sons, Legh Master, MP for Newton, Lancashire, and Rev. Streynsham Master, M.A., and a daughter, Anne. In 1692 he purchased the Codnor Castle estate in Derbyshire. He served as High Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1712. Master and his wife resided at Stanley Grange in Morley in Derbyshire. His nephew – the son of his elder brother, James Master – was a Royal Navy captain also named Streynsham Master. Among his descendants are Admiral Sir Nicholas John Streynsham Hunt and his son Jeremy Hunt, an MP since 2005, Foreign Secretary from 2018 to 2019, Conservative leadership candidate in 2019, and Chancellor of the Exchequer from 2022 to 2024.

<text>A visor was an armored covering for the face often used in conjunction with Late Medieval war helmets such as the bascinet or sallet. The visor usually consisted of a hinged piece of steel that contained openings for breathing and vision. Appropriately, &quot;breaths&quot; refers to the holes in the metal of the visor. Visors protected the face during battle and could be remarkably durable. One surviving artifact was found to be &quot;equivalent in hardness to cold worked high speed steel.&quot;

== History ==

The first recorded European reference to a helmet&#x27;s visor in the Middle Ages is found in the 1298 will of Odo de Roussillon, which speaks of a &quot;heume a vissere&quot;. Whether this statement refers to a pivoting visor or a fixed faceplate is not clear; but by the early fourteenth century artistic depictions of moving visors appear quite frequently. The popularization of the visor also increased the practical value of armorial surcoats in battle, since when the visor was down &quot;it was no longer possible to distinguish king from subject, leader from stranger, comrade from foe&quot;. As such, the visor may have led to the design of more complex forms of livery.

In addition to material artifacts, written accounts provide some evidence for the effectiveness of visors. Mounted jousters appear to have benefited particularly from the use of visors. In his account of peacetime jousts at Saint-Inglevert, French chronicler Jean Froissart provides an example of visored helmets being used in tournament. Froissart describes the visors as being durable enough to withstand a blow from a couched lance, writing that &quot;the steel tips struck the visors of [the jousting knights] so strongly and directly that the two were unhelmed.&quot; The style of visor employed in the joust is not clear from Froissart&#x27;s account. When wearing an open-faced helmet, some knights would utilize the top of a shield to create a visor-like defense. Castilian chronicler Fernao Lopes describes such a situation taking place in a 1387 joust, wherein one knight held his shield &quot;so that only his right eye was visible.&quot; Whether this was a strategic alternative to the use of a visor or simply an accommodation for inferior armor is unclear.

Visors are also mentioned in accounts of Late Medieval warfare. The author of the &quot;Gesta Henrici Quinti&quot; makes mention of the use of visored helms by French nobles at the Battle of Agincourt: &quot;But the French nobles, who had previously advanced together in the front, so that they had almost come into contact with us, either fearing our missiles, whose might had pierced through the sides and visors of their helms...divided themselves into three parts.&quot; While the account displays a strong propagandist tone, it suggests that stray arrows could penetrate a visor, presumably by striking in the opening provided for the wearer&#x27;s vision.
Despite the necessary inclusion of an opening through which a wearer might see, a visor might substantially impair the user&#x27;s field of vision. For this reason, many visors could be lifted if needed. Muslim chronicler Imad ad-Din depicts Christian crusaders &quot;with raised visors amid the swords&quot; at the Battle of Hattin in 1187. The account provided by Imad ad-Din suggests the crusaders lifted the visor in response to being unhorsed, perhaps implying that closed visors were favored by cavalry more than infantry.

== Cultural legacy ==
Visors played an important role in Late Medieval and Early Modern literature, allowing for a dramatic reveal of a character&#x27;s identity. Sir Thomas Malory employs this tactic in &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur &quot;, wherein a damsel commands a knight she believes is Sir Lancelot to &quot;put up thy visage&quot; only to discover that he is actually Sir Tristam de Lyones.

Whether the literary usage of visored helmets corresponded to actual battlefield practice is less clear. For instance, the word &quot;beaver&quot; is sometimes used interchangeably with &quot;visor&quot;, as in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, when Prince Hamlet and Horatio are discussing the Ghost. Hamlet says: &quot;Then saw you not his face?&quot; to which Horatio responds &quot;O yes, my lord. He wore his beaver up.&quot; This may be misleading, however, as the term &quot;beaver&quot; can also refer to a piece of plate-armor which protected the neck.

The French literary critic Jacques Derrida references the literary power of the visor in &quot;Specters of Marx&quot;, viewing the visor as conferring &quot;the power to see without being seen&quot; on the wearer.

In contemporary media, many films portray knights in visored helmets, such as the 2001 feature film &quot;A Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot;.

<doc id="493219" wikidata="Q211430" url="?curid=493219" title="Demades">
<text>Demades (, BC) was an Athenian orator and demagogue.

==Background and early life==

Demades was born into a poor family of ancient Paeania and was employed at one time as a common sailor, but he rose to a prominent position at Athens thanks to his eloquence as well as his unscrupulous character. He espoused the cause of Philip II of Macedon in the war against Olynthus, and was thus brought into bitter and lifelong enmity with Demosthenes, whom he at first supported.

==Relations with Macedon==

Demades fought against the Macedonians in the Battle of Chaeronea, and was taken prisoner. Having made a favourable impression upon Philip, he was released together with his fellow-captives, and was instrumental in bringing about a treaty of peace between Macedonia and Athens.

Demades continued to be a favourite of Alexander, and, prompted by a bribe, saved Demosthenes and some other Athenian orators from his vengeance. It was also chiefly owing to him that Alexander, after the destruction of Thebes, treated Athens so leniently.

Demades&#x27; conduct in supporting the Macedonian cause, yet receiving any bribes that were offered by the opposite party, led him to be heavily fined more than once; he was finally deprived of his civil rights. He was reinstated (322 BC) on the approach of Antipater, to whom he was sent as ambassador. Before setting out he persuaded the citizens to pass sentence of death upon Demosthenes and his followers, who had fled from Athens. The result of his embassy was the conclusion of a peace considered to be greatly to the disadvantage of the Athenians.

In 318 BC (or earlier), having been discovered involved in an intrigue with Perdiccas, Antipater&#x27;s opponent, Demades was put to death by Antipater at Pella, when entrusted with another mission by the Athenians. 

Demades was avaricious and unscrupulous, but he was a highly gifted and practised orator. According to Arrian, Demades was killed by Cassander, Antipater&#x27;s son, after suffering the slaughtering of his child in his hands. Cassander justified his actions by accusing Demades that he had slandered Antipater in his letters to Perdiccas.

==Legacy==

It has been said of Demades that he was a master improviser. This may explain why practically none of his works have fully survived and only scattered fragments have been preserved.

A fragment of a speech, bearing his name, in which he defends his conduct, is to be found in C Müller&#x27;s &quot;Oratores Attici&quot;, ii. 438, but its genuineness is considered to be doubtful.

The saying that &quot;Draco&#x27;s laws were written with blood, not with ink&quot; is attributed to Demades.

He is also alleged to have called the state largesse distributed by the Theoric Fund the &quot;cement of democracy&quot;.

<text>Dinarchus or Dinarch (; Corinth, c. 361 – c. 291 BC) was a logographer (speechwriter) in Ancient Greece. He was the last of the ten Attic orators included in the &quot;Alexandrian Canon&quot; compiled by Aristophanes of Byzantium and Aristarchus of Samothrace in the third century BC.

==Life==
A son of Sostratus (or, according to the &quot;Suda&quot;, Socrates), Dinarchus settled at Athens early in life, and when not more than twenty-five was already active as a logographer—a writer of speeches for the law courts. As a metic, he was unable to take part in the debates. He had been the pupil both of Theophrastus and of Demetrius Phalereus, and had early acquired a certain fluency and versatility of style.

In 324 the Areopagus, after inquiry, reported that nine men had taken bribes from Harpalus, the fugitive treasurer of Alexander. Ten public prosecutors were appointed. Dinarchus wrote, for one or more of these prosecutors, the three speeches which are still extant: &quot;Against Demosthenes&quot;, &quot;Against Aristogeiton&quot;, and &quot;Against Philocles&quot;.

The sympathies of Dinarchus were in favor of an Athenian oligarchy under Macedonian control; but it should be remembered that he was not an Athenian citizen. Aeschines and Demades had no such excuse. In the Harpalus affair, Demosthenes as well as the others accused, were probably innocent. Yet Hypereides, the most fiery of the patriots, was on the same side as Dinarchus.

Under the regency of his old master, Demetrius Phalereus, Dinarchus exercised much political influence. The years 317–307 were the most prosperous of his life. On the fall of Demetrius Phalereus and the restoration of the democracy by Demetrius Poliorcetes, Dinarchus was condemned to death and withdrew into exile at Chalcis in Euboea.

About 292, thanks to his friend Theophrastus, he was able to return to Attica, and took up his abode in the country with a former associate, Proxenus. He afterwards brought an action against Proxenus on the ground that he had robbed him of some money and plate. Dinarchus died at Athens about 291.

==Surviving speeches==
According to Suidas, Dinarchus wrote 160 speeches; and Dionysius held that, out of 85 extant speeches bearing his name, 58 were genuine: 28 relating to public, 30 to private causes. The surviving speeches mentioned above are:
* &quot;Against Demosthenes&quot;
* &quot;Against Aristogiton&quot;
* &quot;Against Philocles&quot;

<text>Swedbank AB is a Nordic-Baltic banking group based in Stockholm, Sweden, offering retail banking, asset management, financial, and other services. Swedbank has a leading presence in Estonia and has a strong presence in Latvia and Lithuania.

==History==
The first Swedish savings bank was founded in Gothenburg in 1820. In 1992, a number of local savings banks merged to create Sparbanken Sverige (&quot;Savings Bank Sweden&quot;). In 1995, this bank was listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange and in 1997, it merged with Föreningsbanken under the combined name FöreningsSparbanken (abbreviated FSB). During the 2007–2008 financial crisis, Swedbank accepted government assistance due to its losses from loans made to neighboring Baltic economies.

On 8 September 2006, Föreningssparbanken AB changed its name to &quot;Swedbank AB&quot;. The name change took place in the afternoon local time, after the Swedish Companies Registration Office registered the changes in the company&#x27;s articles of association. On the same date, the subsidiary AB Spintab changed its name to &quot;Swedbank Hypotek AB&quot; (&quot;Swedbank Mortgage AB&quot;) and FöreningsSparbanken Jordbrukskredit AB changed its name to &quot;Swedbank Jordbrukskredit AB&quot; (&quot;Swedbank Agricultural Credit AB&quot;). Other subsidiaries will change their names at later dates.

In 2013 Swedbank closed its operations in Russia and sold its Ukrainian subsidiary.

In 2019 Swedbank had 900,000 private and 130,000 corporate clients and a 60% market share of Estonia’s payments.

==Headquarters==
The current Swedbank Headquarters was inaugurated in 2014 in Sundbyberg Municipality. The building was designed by 3XN.

==Organisation==


In 2023 Swedbank had 7.2 million retail customers and 555,000 corporate customers in Sweden, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. The group has 226 branches in Sweden and in the Baltic countries. It also maintains a presence in Copenhagen, Helsinki, New York City, Oslo, Shanghai and Johannesbourg.

Swedbank has close cooperation with about 60 local, but still independent, savings banks who chose not to join during the 1992 merger. These banks use FSB logos and customers have the same access to independent banks and branches belonging to FSB. Two relatively large independent savings banks, including the one in Skåne, have chosen not to cooperate with Swedbank and continue to use the logo used by Sparbanken before the merger with Föreningsbanken.

Together with the independent savings banks, Swedbank has branches all over Sweden. The bank has more than 16,000 employees across its operations in Sweden and abroad. Jens Henriksson is president and CEO, while former Swedish Prime Minister Göran Persson is chairman.

==Market position==
Swedbank is one of the primary banks in Sweden, together with Nordea, Handelsbanken, and SEB. In 2001, a deal to merge Swedbank (then FSB) with SEB failed as the European Commission thought that the merged company would have had too dominant a position in the Swedish banking market. Today, Swedbank has 7 million private customers and 555 000 corporate customers.

Swedbank is the largest bank in both Estonia and Latvia.

== Regulatory issues ==

=== Money laundering ===
On 20 February 2019 Swedish broadcaster SVT revealed that Swedbank is under investigation for alleged link in money laundering scandal by Estonian authorities due to suspicious transactions through Danske Bank which is being investigated in Denmark, Estonia, Britain, France and the United States. Estonian authorities confirmed findings by SVT. At least 40 billion Swedish crowns (£3.3 billion) had been transferred between accounts at Swedbank and Danske in the Baltics between 2007 and 2015, SVT&#x27;s Uppdrag Granskning investigative programme reported. Chief executive Birgitte Bonnesen was fired in March 2019 during the money laundering scandal and her severance pay was cancelled. The bank&#x27;s chairman Lars Idermark resigned the following month. Swedbank was subsequently fined a record 4bn SEK ($380m) by Swedish and Estonian regulators.
Swedish appeals court found in September 2024 former Swedbank CEO Birgitte Bonnesen guilty of gross fraud over her handling of anti-money laundering protocols in Estonia, sentencing her to 15 months in prison.

=== Sanction breaches ===
Swedbank Latvia AS was charged by OFAC in the USA with 386 apparent violations, totalling $3,312,120, breaching sanctions in relation to sending payments to Crimea through US Correspondent banks in 2015 and 2016, Swedbank settled, by agreeing in 2023 to pay $3,430,900 in penalties.

== Patron of the University of Latvia ==
Swedbank is a gold patron of the University of Latvia Foundation. Cooperation and support has been received from Swedbank since 2005 to promote the development of education in Latvia by donating to student events and activities. Major projects - Open Mind Research Fellowships 2007/2008. and 2008/2009. as well as annual support for the LU student festival &quot;Aristotelis&quot;.

<text>Svenska Handelsbanken AB is a Swedish bank providing banking services including traditional corporate transactions, investment banking and trading as well as consumer banking including insurance. Handelsbanken is one of the major banks in Sweden with a nationwide branch network.

Since the mid-1990s Handelsbanken has been expanding its universal banking operations into the other Nordic countries, and also in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The largest of these is in Britain with more than 150 branch offices. In October 2021 Handelsbanken announced that it would focus on its main markets Britain, Sweden and Norway and sell its operations in Finland and Denmark.

==History==

===Founding as Stockholms Handelsbank===

Stockholms Handelsbank (&quot;Stockholm Commerce Bank&quot;) was created in early 1871 by several large corporations and leading Stockholm residents. Several of the initial owners had been active in Stockholms enskilda bank, the forerunner of SEB, which had opened in 1856 as the first private bank of Stockholm, and left that bank in April 1871 after a conflict. Handelsbanken began operating 1 July 1871 in rented space in the commercial and financial district in the central Old Town. The bank&#x27;s first year was quite successful and soon, it was one of the city&#x27;s leading financial institutions, functioning as a bank for businesses and also as an issuer of bonds. In 1873, the shares in Handelsbanken were listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange.

In 1887, the bank entered into a crisis due to considerable losses, but was able to pull through. In 1893, the banking company of Louis Frænckel was fused with Stockholms Handelsbank, with Frænckel as the CEO. Under Frænckel&#x27;s tenure, which lasted until his death in 1911, the bank was expanded with a notary department in 1896 and by a securities trading department in 1899. It also developed contacts with many leading foreign banks and financial institutions, which led to the buildup of trading activities in foreign currencies. The merge of the Julius Geber &amp; Co banking company into Handelsbanken in 1906 contributed to its prominence in the Swedish foreign exchange market.

From 1914 to 1917, Stockholm&#x27;s Handelsbank bought several smaller Swedish regional banks, and was in a short time transformed from a purely Stockholm-based bank to a bank with a large number of branch offices (38 in 1914 and 143 in 1917) throughout Sweden, in particular central and northern Sweden. In 1918, new branches were opened in Gothenburg and Malmö to get better national coverage, and in 1919, a bank in southern Sweden was bought, which brought the number of branch offices to over 250. After this expansion, the name was changed to Svenska Handelsbanken (&quot;Swedish Commerce Bank&quot;) on 15 November 1919.

===1920–1945===
Following the post–World War I recession, Sweden experienced deflation, which caused considerable problems for the financial sector. In 1922, Handelsbanken failed to show a profit for the first time in its existence and in 1922–1923 it consolidated its activities, and made some write-downs, reductions in dividends and reserved funds to cover losses. The second half of the 1920s were much better times for the bank. In 1926, Mälarebanken was fused into Handelsbanken, bringing the number of branch offices to 270, of which 28 in Stockholm.

The worldwide depression following the Wall Street crash of 1929 led to reduced profits, and problems for borrowers resulted in the bank taking over stock in several industrial companies to secure their loans. Handelsbanken had however been cautious in their relation to Ivar Kreuger and his financial empire so it was not much affected by the Kreuger crash following Kreuger&#x27;s death in 1932. Handelsbanken did however expand its ownership in Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget (SCA) as a result of the crash.

In the winter of 1943/1944, Handelsbanken formed a holding company for the companies owned by the bank after the financial problems of the 1920s and 1930s, as part of a plan to phase out the bank&#x27;s ownership of these companies, which included L. M. Ericsson. The company was named Industrivärden (&quot;The Industry Host&quot; or &quot;Industry Values&quot;), and after the bank&#x27;s shareholders had been given the opportunity to acquire shares in the holding company, it was listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange in 1945.

===1945–1970===
Handelsbanken continued to expand by purchasing other banks in the 1940s and 1950s – Vänersborgsbanken, Norrköpings Folkbank, Luleå Folkbank and Gotlandsbanken. The mortgage company SIGAB was acquired in 1955 and renamed to Handelsbanken Hypotek. In the 1955 to 1965 period, 157 new branch offices were opened, many of these in the newly built suburbs of Stockholm, in order to increase the number of customers and to expand deposits.

Towards the end of the 1960s, the Swedish society saw increased socialist sentiments, just like many other European countries. This was particularly strong among students and other youth, and banks and industrialists in general were portrayed in a very negative way. During this time, Handelsbanken was also the subject of specific criticism from media and authorities, including foreign exchange transactions in 1969 that contravened regulations. The resulting crisis led to the resignation of the bank&#x27;s management, including CEO Rune Höglund in 1970.

===1970–1990===
After the resignation of the previous management, Jan Wallander was recruited as the bank&#x27;s new CEO. Wallander had a background as an economic researcher who had later become CEO of Sundsvallsbanken, a regional bank in northern Sweden. Under Wallander&#x27;s leadership, many changes were introduced which have continued to be characteristic of Handelsbanken since that time. During 1970–1972, Handelsbanken created eight regional banks with a high degree of independence, to which the branch offices belonged. Much of the decision making was decentralised to the local and regional level, and the financial management and control system was overhauled, by focusing more on reporting and less on central budgeting. The new organisation focused on achieving profitability rather than on volume growth, which had been the case in the 1950s and 1960s.

In 1973, a particular form of profit sharing scheme was introduced. When Handelsbanken meets its goals of higher return on equity than the average of the other listed Swedish banks, a profit share is paid to a foundation named Oktogonen, which keeps its fund entirely in Handelsbanken shares. Payment only takes place after retirement, which means that all employees are interested in securing the long-term profitability of the bank. Oktogonen owns around 10 per cent of Handelsbanken&#x27;s shares.

In 1970, Handelsbanken installed its first six automated teller machines (ATMs), initially as a trial.

In 1985, many aspects of the Swedish financial sector were deregulated which led to a considerable credit expansion in the following years. Handelsbanken&#x27;s volume of loans doubled in three years in the end of the 1980s. Skånska Banken and its 76 branch offices was acquired in 1990.

===1990–present===
In 1990, Sweden entered a severe financial crisis, which was compounded by the credit expansion of the late 1980s and a financial bubble related to real estate prices. Many of the Swedish banks were hit hard by this crisis and had to be rescued by the government, which led to some of the banks being temporarily nationalised. Handelsbanken was least affected of the major Swedish banks, and was able to expand its market share in the 1990s. In 1997, Handelsbanken bought Stadshypotek, a major mortgage company, from the government.

In the 1980s Handelsbanken opened several branch offices in other countries mostly to support corporate banking activities. From 1990, several smaller Norwegian, Finnish and Danish banks were acquired to build up Handelsbanken&#x27;s activities and branch networks in the other Nordic countries. In 1998, Handelsbanken&#x27;s operations in Denmark, Finland and Norway were organised into regional banks, and started to operate in the same way as the regional bank organisation used by Handelsbanken in Sweden since the 1970s.

In late 1991, the bank introduced telephone banking services and on 10 December 1997 online banking followed.

In 1995, Handelsbanken acquired the vast majority of the credit and financing portfolio of the former Finnish bank SKOP Bank (; which went bust in the early-1990s Finnish banking crisis and the recession that followed), as well as SKOP&#x27;s holdings in the Industrialization Fund of Finland Ltd .

In 1999, Handelsbanken decided to expand in the United Kingdom by organic growth. At that time the bank had three offices in the UK and opened a fourth in 2000. In 2007, the bank opened its 50th UK branch office, and in 2011 its 100th UK branch office. In 2002, the UK operations were organised as a regional bank, in the same way as the bank&#x27;s Nordic operations.

On 19 October 2021 Handelsbanken announced that it will sell its operations in Finland and Denmark and exit the two markets. Of Handelsbanken&#x27;s total turnover, Finland and Denmark accounted for 10% from the beginning of 2021, but the share of expenses rose to 13%. Finnish and Danish operations generated 8% of the revenue. The main markets, Sweden, Norway and the UK, accounted for 91%.

On 15 June 2022 Handelsbanken confirmed it was in discussion with Jyske Bank for the acquisition of Handelsbankens Danish operations.

On 31 May 2023 S-Bank announced to acquire the Finnish private customer, asset management and investment services operations of Handelsbanken.

<doc id="493233" wikidata="Q955655" url="?curid=493233" title="Municipalities of Iceland">
<text>The municipalities of Iceland ( ; sing.  ) are local administrative areas in Iceland that provide a number of services to their inhabitants such as kindergartens, elementary schools, waste management, social services, public housing, public transportation, services to senior citizens and disabled people. They also govern zoning and can voluntarily take on additional functions if they have the budget for it. The autonomy of municipalities over their own matters is guaranteed by the Icelandic constitution.

==History==

The origin of the municipalities can be traced back to the commonwealth period in the 10th century when rural communities were organized into communes (&quot;hreppar&quot; ) with the main purpose of providing help for the poorest individuals in society. When urbanization began in Iceland during the 18th and 19th centuries, several independent townships (&quot;kaupstaðir&quot; ) were created. The role of municipalities was further formalized during the 20th century and by the end of the century there was no longer any official distinction between urban and rural municipalities. 

The trend in recent years has been to transfer more functions and power from the state to the municipalities. This has called for larger municipalities. The government encourages municipalities to merge but has taken a different approach to the issue than governments in other Nordic countries where forced amalgamation is regularly carried out (such as the municipal reform in Denmark that took effect in 2007). Instead, the process is voluntary. Municipalities negotiate possible mergers among themselves, and any merger must first receive approval from the relevant municipality&#x27;s constituent voting electorate in a referendum. A similar approach is used by the Faroese government. However, municipalities having a population of below 50 may be forced to merge.

The number of municipalities peaked in the mid-20th century. There were 229 of them in 1950. From 1986 to 1998, their number decreased from 222 to 124. From 2000 to 2024, their number decreased from 124 to the current figure of 62.

==Government==
The municipalities are governed by municipal councils which are directly elected every four years. Municipal elections were last held on 14 May 2022. The sizes of these councils vary from five members in the smallest municipalities to fifteen in the largest one. Most municipalities except for the very small ones hire an executive manager who may or may not be a member of the municipal council. These managers are usually referred to as mayors (&quot;bæjarstjóri&quot; or &quot;borgarstjóri&quot; ) in the mostly urban municipalities but &quot;municipal manager&quot; (&quot;sveitarstjóri&quot; ) in the rural or mixed municipalities. It is common for these executive managers to be professionally hired and politically independent.

<text>This is a list of notable events in the history of LGBT rights that took place in the year 1992.

==Events==
* The World Health Organization declassifies homosexuality as a mental illness in the latest edition of its list of diseases and health problems, the ICD-10.
* U.S. state of California bans sexual orientation discrimination in the private sector.
* U.S. states of Vermont and New Jersey ban sexual orientation discrimination in the private sector.
* U.S. state of Oregon&#x27;s Measure 8, approved in a referendum in 1988, is ruled unconstitutional by the Oregon Court of Appeals in the case known as &quot;Merrick v. Board of Higher Education&quot;, meaning that the 1987 executive order banning public-sector discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation stands.
* The City Council of Phoenix, Arizona, prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation in the private sector.
* San Mateo County, California, bans employment discrimination based on sexual orientation in the private sector.

===June===
* The Lesbian Avengers, a direct action group, is founded in New York City by activists from the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP).

===September===
* 24 — The Kentucky Supreme Court issues its holding in &quot;Kentucky v. Wasson&quot;, invalidating the state&#x27;s sodomy law as unconstitutional.

=== October ===
* 27 — The Federal Court of Canada orders the Canadian military to stop discriminating against gays.

=== November ===
* 3
** Denver, Aspen, and Boulder, Colorado pass ordinances to protect the rights of LGB people.
** By a margin of 54 to 36%, voters in the U.S. state of Colorado approved Amendment 2, which prohibited bans on sexual orientation discrimination by cities in Colorado, such as the ones simultaneously enacted in Denver, Aspen, and Boulder. The amendment would never go into effect as it is soon challenged and struck down in &quot;Romer v. Evans&quot;, in which the Supreme Court of the United States ruled 6 to 3 that the Amendment did not satisfy the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.
** Oregon Ballot Measure 9 is defeated in a referendum. The measure denounced homosexuality as &quot;abnormal,&quot; &quot;unnatural,&quot; and &quot;perverse,&quot; would have prohibited sexual orientation discrimination bans in Oregon.
* Voters in Portland, Maine rejected a ballot measure to repeal a local gay rights ordinance by a vote of 57-43%.
* 5 — A clause prohibiting anti-gay verbal abuse in schools is repealed by the Fairfax County, Virginia board of education out of concerns that it promotes homosexuality.
* The Cincinnati City Council passed a city ordinance forbidding housing, employment, and public accommodations discrimination based on race, age, religion, &quot;Appalachian origin,&quot; or sexual orientation.

<doc id="493238" wikidata="Q702175" url="?curid=493238" title="Triadica sebifera">
<text>Triadica sebifera is a tree native to eastern Asia (Chinese 乌桕, wū jiù). It is commonly called Chinese tallow, Chinese tallowtree, Florida aspen, chicken tree, gray popcorn tree, or candleberry tree.

The seeds (as well as from those of &quot;Triadica cochinchinensis&quot;) are the sources of stillingia oil, a drying oil used in paints and varnishes. The fatty coat of the seeds, used for candle and soap making, is known as stillingia tallow; hence its common name. It is relevant to biodiesel production because it is the third most productive vegetable oil producing crop in the world, after algae and oil palm. The leaves are used as herbal medicine to treat boils. The plant sap and leaves are reputed to be toxic, and decaying leaves from the plant are toxic to other species of plants. The species is classified as a noxious invader in the southern U.S.

This species and &quot;T. cochinchinensis&quot; were formerly classified in the genus &quot;Stillingia&quot;, as &quot;Stillingia sebifera&quot; and &quot;Stillingia discolor&quot; (hence the name still used for the oil and tallow). The specific epithet &quot;sebifera&quot; is derived from Latin &quot;sebum&quot; (meaning &quot;tallow&quot;) and &quot;fero&quot; (meaning &quot;to bear&quot;), thus &quot;tallow-bearing&quot;. At some time before 1950, this tree was reclassified into the genus &quot;Sapium&quot; as &quot;Sapium sebiferum&quot;, and many papers about the oil still refer to the tree by this name. In 2002 or so it was reclassified again into the genus &quot;Triadica&quot; with its present name.

==Description==

The simple, deciduous leaves of this tree are alternate, broad rhombic to ovate in shape and have smooth edges, heart shaped and sometimes with an extended tail often resembling the bo tree, &quot;Ficus religiosa&quot;. The leaves are bright green in color and slightly paler underneath. They become bright yellows, oranges, purples and reds in the autumn. The tree is monoecious, producing male and female flowers on the same plant.

The waxy green leaves set off the clusters of greenish-yellow and white flowers at bloom time. The flowers occur in terminal spike-like inflorescences up to 20 cm long. Light green in color, these flowers are very conspicuous in the spring. Each pistillate (female) flower is solitary and has a three-lobed ovary, three styles, and no petals. They are located on short branches at the base of the spike. The staminate (male) flowers occur in clusters at the upper nodes of the inflorescence.

Fruits are three-lobed, three-valved capsules. As the capsules mature, their color changes from green to a brown-black. The capsule walls fall away and release three globose seeds, about 12 mm in diameter and weighing about
0.15 g, with a white, tallow-containing covering. Seeds usually hang on the plants for several weeks. In North America, the flowers typically mature from April to June and the fruit ripens from September to October.

==Range and habitat==
&quot;Triadica sebifera&quot; is native to China, probably originally in the Zhejiang area, and it was described in the Tang pharmacopoeia &quot;Xinxiu bencao&quot;. Cultivation of the tree may have begun in the 7th century during the Tang dynasty in the Yangtze Delta region, and from there it spread westward and southward. The trees reached the Philippines, Taiwan, northern Vietnam and Hainan by the 17th century. It was also introduced to Japan during the Edo period. By the 18th century, it had spread to India, the Caribbean islands, and South Carolina and Georgia in the United States through the East India Company. It is also found in Sudan, and southern France.

The tree was said to have been introduced to the US by Benjamin Franklin, who mentioned having obtained some seeds in a letter dated October 1772, but it may have actually been introduced to South Carolina, Georgia and Florida in early 1773 by John Bradby Blake who had access to the seeds earlier in late 1770 or early 1771. The tree has become naturalized from North Carolina southward along the Atlantic seaboard and the entire Gulf Coast, where it grows profusely along ditchbanks and dikes. It grows especially well in open fields and abandoned farmland coastal prairie regions featuring disturbed ground—such as abandoned farmland, spoil banks, roadsides, and storm-damaged forests—and along the edges of the Western Gulf coastal grasslands biome, sometimes forming monocultures. The Chinese Tallow Tree is listed as an invasive species in South Carolina.

==Uses==

The seed&#x27;s white waxy aril is used in soap making. The seed&#x27;s inner oil (&quot;stillingia oil&quot;) is toxic but has industrial applications.

The nectar is non-toxic, and it has become a major honey plant for beekeepers. The honey is of high quality. It is produced copiously during the month of June on the US Gulf Coast. In that region, beekeepers migrate with their honey bees to good tallow locations near the gulf.

The tree is ornamental, fast growing, and a provides shade. It is especially noteworthy if grown in areas that have strong seasonal temperature ranges with the leaves becoming a multitude of colours rivaling maples in the autumn. It is not choosy about soil types or drainage, but will not grow in deep shade. It has naturalized all over in Japan, and is reasonably hardy. It should not be planted outside of its native range due to its invasive tendencies.

==Invasive species==
The tallow tree is a non-native species to many places around the world. Its introduced status in North America along with the harm it causes to ecosystems makes the tree considered an invasive species there. Tallow trees present a danger of expansion that can hurt local ecosystems by out-competing native vegetation and creating a monoculture. The monoculture lowers species diversity and overall resilience of the area. The tree&#x27;s tenacious nature, high growth rates, and high reproductive ability contribute to its invasive success. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, tallow trees begin producing viable seed in as soon as three years. They can spread by root sprouts and cuttings and are quick to invade after a disturbance occurs in an area, due to the clearing out of land. A single tallow tree can produce nearly 100,000 viable seeds annually that can remain in the soil for several years before sprouting. A mature stand can produce 4,500 kilograms of seeds per hectare per year. These seeds are easily carried to different places by birds and water. Tallow trees can remain productive for 100 years. It is also extremely hard to kill—its poisonous features in its leaves and berries leave it with few to no predators, and its short generation time means even freshly cut trees can quickly regrow. Currently, herbicides and prescribed fire are the only effective treatments available to contain and control Chinese tallow. The USDA is evaluating the flea beetle (&quot;Bikasha collaris&quot;) as a natural control agent.

In the Houston area, Chinese tallow trees account for a full 23 percent of all trees, more than any other tree species and is the only invasive tree species in the 14 most common species in the area. The Texas Department of Agriculture lists Chinese Tallow as one of the 24 most invasive plants, and includes Chinese Tallow in a list of Noxious and Invasive Plants which are illegal to sell, distribute or import into Texas. Herbivores and insects have a conditioned behavioral avoidance to eating the leaves of Chinese tallow tree, and this, rather than plant toxins, may be a reason for the success of the plant as an invasive.

In Europe, the species features on the Union list of invasive alien species. This means it is now illegal to import or sell this plant in the European Union.

==Biological control==
In parts of the USA biological control of the Chinese tallow tree has been considered, using the flea beetle &quot;Bikasha collaris&quot;, whose larvae attack the roots, and the moth &quot;Gadirtha fusca&quot;, whose caterpillars attack the leaves. In those areas, the resulting prospect of losing the Chinese tallow as a honey source has caused concern in beekeepers.

<text>Sonata Arctica is a Finnish power metal band from the town of Kemi, Finland. Created as a hard rock band named Tricky Beans, they later changed to Tricky Means and finally to Sonata Arctica, when they shifted to power metal. The current lineup consists of drummer Tommy Portimo, lead singer Tony Kakko, keyboardist Henrik Klingenberg, guitarist Elias Viljanen and bassist Pasi Kauppinen. All the musicians of the band&#x27;s history except Portimo also acted as backing vocalists.

As of 2024, the band has released eleven full-length albums (three via Spinefarm Records, eight via Nuclear Blast, and one via Atomic Fire), their most recent being &quot;Clear Cold Beyond&quot; in March 2024.

==Biography==
===Formation and early years (1996–1999)===
The band was founded by drummer Tommy Portimo and guitarists Jani Liimatainen and Marko Paasikoski in Kemi. At the end of 1995, lead vocalist Tony Kakko was added and bassist Pentti Peura joined in early 1996. Originally named Tricky Beans, they played hard rock rather than the power metal with which they grew to fame. Kakko explained that when he was invited to join the band, Paasikoski said the band was going to play &quot;a mixture of Megadeth and Spin Doctors&quot;. During their early career, they recorded three demos which were never sent to a recording label — &quot;Friend &#x27;til the End&quot;, &quot;Agre Pamppers&quot; and &quot;PeaceMaker&quot;. According to Kakko, the band&#x27;s first name was based on one of their early songs, which was &quot;about a lady who was tricky and I didn&#x27;t really know what I was talking about (laughs)&quot;. Their first show was about to take place but they were still unnamed, so they had to come up with something.

In 1997 the band changed their name to Tricky Means, and from that point until 1999 their style was thoroughly worked upon and ultimately was drastically changed, acquiring a strong emphasis on the keyboard melodies and relying on an easily distinguishable rhythm line maintained both by the bass and the guitar. Vocalist Tony Kakko developed a clean singing style which relies both on falsetto and tenor voices. Kakko has stated that the change of sound was influenced by fellow Finnish power metal band Stratovarius. At that time, Pentti Peura was fired and Marko Paasikoski left due to a lack of gigging. Two months later the band got signed to a three-album deal with Spinefarm, which left Marko displeased. The band finally changed their name to Sonata Arctica, because they thought they wouldn&#x27;t be able to sell metal albums with the previous name and also because Spinefarm asked them to do so. &quot;Sonata Arctica&quot; was suggested by a friend of the band: &quot;sonata&quot; for the music and &quot;arctica&quot; for their home (Kemi, in Northern Finland).

In 1997, they recorded a demo entitled &quot;FullMoon&quot; in Kemi&#x27;s Tico Tico Studios, which was their first real metal recording. The line-up consisted of Portimo, Liimatainen, Kakko and new bassist Janne Kivilahti (who started first as second guitarist). The demo was sent to Spinefarm Records by a friend of the band and a recording deal soon followed.

===&quot;Ecliptica&quot; and &quot;Silence&quot; (1999–2002)===

Later that year, Sonata Arctica&#x27;s first single, entitled &quot;UnOpened&quot;, was released in Finland. Soon after, the band had closed deals with labels from around the world, prior to the release of their debut album. The debut &quot;Ecliptica&quot; arrived by the end of 1999 and had a worldwide release. Tony Kakko then decided to focus on singing and the band began seeking a new keyboard player. Mikko Härkin (ex-Kenziner) was eventually invited to fill the position.

At the beginning of 2000, Sonata Arctica was chosen to support the well-known power metal band Stratovarius throughout their European tour. Marko Paasikoski returned to the band to play bass in the wake of Janne Kivilahti&#x27;s departure after the tour. According to Kakko, Kivilahti left because he thought they weren&#x27;t going anywhere and Paasikoski was their first choice as the new bassist since he left just before the band got their first record deal.

Throughout Winter 2000/2001, the band worked on composing and recording their next album — &quot;Silence&quot; — which was released in June 2001. An extensive tour followed, which included concerts throughout Europe (together with Gamma Ray) and Japan. In 2002 Sonata Arctica made its first incursion to America, putting on shows in Brazil and Chile. A live album entitled &quot;Songs of Silence&quot; was also released that year, consisting of gigs from their tour in Japan. By the end of 2002, Mikko Härkin left the band for personal reasons.

===&quot;Winterheart&#x27;s Guild&quot; and &quot;Reckoning Night&quot; (2003–2006)===
In the search for another keyboardist, the band received many applications and two of them were invited for auditions. Since they were well aware of the candidates&#x27; ability, the band decided to pick the new member based on personality. To this end, they spent a night drinking with each of the potentials to find out which one would fit best into the band&#x27;s personality and mentality. Henrik Klingenberg was eventually chosen and joined the band in time to take part in the tour that followed the release of &quot;Winterheart&#x27;s Guild&quot;. With the end of their contract with Spinefarm Records, the band received invitations from most European recording labels and eventually opted for Nuclear Blast.

Their third album — &quot;Winterheart&#x27;s Guild&quot; was recorded with the help of the seasoned keyboard player Jens Johansson from Stratovarius who recorded the keyboard solos, while Kakko took care of the basics. The album was released in 2003.

In early 2004, the band was chosen as the opener for Iron Maiden&#x27;s Japanese tour. Additionally, Tommy Portimo became a father; his wife gave birth to a baby girl in March. &quot;Reckoning Night&quot; was recorded in three months and released in October, with Klingenberg introducing the use of the organ to the band. Both the single and the EP of this release remained on the top of the Finnish charts simultaneously for over six weeks. A promotional tour was to follow, but Sonata Arctica was invited by the popular Nightwish to join their European tour, and thus made a change of plans.

In early 2005, Nightwish invited the band to open the concerts of their North American tour. This tour eventually got cancelled, but the members of Sonata Arctica opted to still make a short tour, playing concerts in Canada and the United States. On 21 October 2005, Sonata Arctica opened for Nightwish at the Hartwall Areena, Helsinki.

In 2006, the band released a live CD and DVD entitled &quot;For the Sake of Revenge&quot;, which was recorded in Tokyo in February 2005. Then, Spinefarm Records released a compilation album to get the most out of their contract with the band, since Sonata Arctica had changed to another label. The compilation is entitled &quot;The End of This Chapter&quot; and was released in Japan in August 2005 and in Europe in May 2006.

A computer video game was also planned, based on Sonata Arctica characters and music. The name of the game was going to be &quot;Winterheart&#x27;s Guild&quot;, after the album. The game was to be developed by Zelian Games, and was to be an Action-RPG in a style between &quot;Fallout&quot; and &quot;Diablo&quot;. The game was cancelled for unannounced reasons but a demo was shown at the Leipzig video game conference in 2006, featuring Henrik Klingenberg as the playable character. In December 2006, the band began recording their fifth studio album.

===&quot;Unia&quot; and &quot;The Days of Grays&quot; (2007–2011)===

On 25 May 2007, &quot;Unia&quot; was released. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Paid in Full&quot;, was released on 27 April 2007. On 6 August 2007, the band announced on their website that guitarist Jani Liimatainen had been asked to leave the band due to problems related to his conscription. He was replaced by Elias Viljanen who had already filled in for him in the band&#x27;s Finnish and Japanese shows during the spring and summer.

In October 2007, Sonata Arctica headlined the ProgPower USA VIII. Later, the band supported Nightwish across their 2008 tour of the United States and Canada and headlined at the shows that Nightwish cancelled due to Anette Olzon&#x27;s sudden severe sickness.

It was announced on 4 September 2008 that the band&#x27;s first two albums would be re-released with bonus tracks by Spinefarm UK on October 6.
&quot;The Days of Grays&quot; was released on September 16, 2009 in Finland and September 22 in the USA. Henrik stated that the new album would be in the same vein as &quot;Unia&quot;, but not as complex and darker. Singles from this album include &quot;Flag in the Ground&quot; and &quot;The Last Amazing Grays&quot;. On 28 August 2009, the music video of &quot;Flag in the Ground&quot; was released to the web. The limited 2CD European edition of the album featured many of the album tracks with all instruments performed by a symphony orchestra.

The band also toured with DragonForce for the third U.S. leg of the &quot;Ultra Beatdown&quot;. In early 2010 they engaged on an Australian tour with Ensiferum and Melbourne band Vanishing Point. In April 2010, Sonata Arctica embarked on their USA and Canada Headlining tour for &quot;The Days of Grays&quot;. In October they headlined in Chile in support of the same album.

===&quot;Stones Grow Her Name&quot; (2011–2013)===

In January 2011, the band hinted in an online interview for &quot;Metaleater&quot; magazine that they were writing songs for a new album while on their current tour. Elias is quoted as saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve been working on some new riffs, quite dark. Tony&#x27;s been stuck in his bed scratching notes about some girl and her &#x27;Luna Lust&#x27;.&quot; Tommy states later, &quot;We&#x27;ve just got back from Cozumel, we had a good time, had lots of beers, loads more sun and thought about putting a bit more Queen stuff back into the music again.&quot; In April, the band recorded a live DVD in Oulu, Finland, entitled &quot;Live in Finland&quot;, which was released on 11 November 2011 (11/11/11).

It was announced on 20 February 2012 through the official Sonata Arctica website that the new album entitled &quot;Stones Grow Her Name&quot; would be released on 18 May in Europe and 22 May in North America.

The Album&#x27;s first single and video &quot;I Have A Right&quot; was released on April 18, the second single from the album, &quot;Shitload of Money&quot; was released on September 14.

The Stones Grow Her Name World Tour began in April with summer festivals until August.

===&quot;Pariah&#x27;s Child&quot;, &quot;The Ninth Hour&quot; and &quot;Talviyö&quot; (2014–2023)===

In a June 2013 interview concerning Henrik Klingenberg&#x27;s own band Silent Voices, Henrik confirmed Sonata Arctica would go into recording for their eighth studio album in September 2013. When pushed for more information, he assured jovially: &quot;If it doesn&#x27;t come out by next year, we&#x27;re in big trouble!&quot;
Concerning the progress and style of this new album, he also mentioned &quot;The bulk of the album, we already have the demos ...&quot; as well as &quot;we want to focus on making songs that work live.&quot;
During rehearsals, Henrik mentioned on his blog that songs they were rehearsing for the new album seemed to hearken towards Sonata Arctica&#x27;s earlier days. He also mentioned their plan to record a 10-minute track for the new album.
On 26 August 2013 the band officially announced on their Facebook page that Marko Paasikoski had left the band due to unsolvable issues with being part of a touring ensemble, and was replaced by bassist Pasi Kauppinen.
On January 9, 2014, the band officially announced via their official website that the band&#x27;s next studio album, &quot;Pariah&#x27;s Child&quot;, will be released on March 28, 2014.

Tony Kakko commented on the style of the new album as well as its album artwork upon the release announcement:
In summer 2014, the band re-recorded their first album, Ecliptica. It was released in October 2014. Tony stated that the band was hoping to record the songs in a manner faithful to the original, not in a manner that would completely change the feel of their original album.

On 3 September 2014, Ouergh Records announced a Sonata Arctica tribute album. The album, &quot;A Tribute to Sonata Arctica&quot; featured bands from across the globe covering Sonata Arctica songs, with a focus on newer bands that were influenced by Sonata Arctica. Prominent bands included: Xandria, Van Canto, Stream of Passion, Arven, Powerglove, and Timeless Miracle. The album was endorsed by Tony Kakko. The tribute album was released September 12, 2015.

In 2014, writer Marko J. Ollila released a biography of the band, titled simply &quot;Sonata Arctica&quot;. The book was published by Paasilinna Publishing Ltd. and was originally only in Finnish. An English translation was published on 5 December 2014 as an e-book. The book covered the band&#x27;s history from its formations up to the 2014 re-record of &quot;Ecliptica&quot;. It also included a fictional short-story written by Kakko, which was the singer&#x27;s debut as a writer of material other than lyrics.

On 18 December 2015, Sonata Arctica released a Christmas-themed single, &quot;Christmas Spirits&quot;.

In February 2016, the band announced their plans to start recording a new album and release it in the final quarter of 2016. In July 2016, they announced on their Facebook page that the yet-to-be-titled album was mixed. On July 21, they officially announced the album&#x27;s title, album artwork, and release date on their Facebook page. Their ninth studio album, &quot;The Ninth Hour&quot;, was released on October 7, 2016. The artwork featured a future Utopian landscape with technology and nature in the balance.

In November 2018, the band revealed that they were working on a new album, which its production had finished in 2019. On 21 June 2019 they released a lyric video for &quot;A Little Less Understanding&quot; and revealed the name of the tenth studio album &quot;Talviyö&quot; which was released via Nuclear Blast on 6 September 2019.

===&quot;Clear Cold Beyond&quot; (2023–present)===
The band released &quot;First in Line&quot;, the first single from their eleventh studio album &quot;Clear Cold Beyond&quot; on 13 October 2023; the album was released on 8 March 2024.

==Musical style and influences==
When asked if the band identified themselves with power metal, melodic metal or none of them, Kakko stated:

In a 2007 interview with C.B.Liddell, Tony Kakko cited the English rock band Queen as his biggest musical influence.

He also cites Stratovarius&#x27; &quot;Visions&quot;.

<doc id="493245" wikidata="Q649393" url="?curid=493245" title="Sapium">
<text>Sapium is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is widespread across most of Latin America and the West Indies. Many Old World species were formerly included in the genus, but recent authors have redistributed all the Old World species into other genera.

Species are known commonly as milktrees.

==Description==
These are shrubs and trees. They produce latex. The leaves are alternately arranged and smooth-edged or toothed. They are monoecious, often with spikelike or raceme-shaped inflorescences that have several male flowers, plus a few female flowers near the base. The male flowers have 2 to 4 stamens. The female flowers have 2 to 4 styles which are sometimes coiled. The flowers lack petals. The fruit has 2 to 4 lobes and may split open or not.

;Species
==Toxicity==
The milky sap of &quot;Sapium biloculare&quot; is poisonous if it comes into contact with the eyes, mucous membranes, stomach or bloodstream. It was used in arrow poison and to stupefy fish.

<doc id="493247" wikidata="Q191022" url="?curid=493247" title="Scarf">
<text>A scarf (: scarves or scarfs) is a long piece of fabric that is worn on or around the neck, shoulders, or head. A scarf is used for warmth, sun protection, cleanliness, fashion, religious reasons, or to show support for a sports club or team. Scarves can be made from materials including wool, linen, silk, and cotton. It is a common type of neckwear and a perennial accessory.

==History==
===Antiquity and the Middle Ages===
Scarves have been worn since ancient times. In 1350 BC, in Ancient Egypt, Queen Nefertiti is said to have worn a tightly woven headscarf, and a 9th-century BC statue of Ashurnasirpal II depicts the emperor wearing a shawl.

In 500 BC in Athens, women wore scarves to enhance their seductive charm; in the same period, Indian women wore them flirtatiously as headgear.

During the reign of the Chinese Emperor Cheng, from 259 to 210 BC, scarves were used as military markers to identify the rank of Chinese warriors or their status as officers; many of the Terracotta Warriors are depicted wearing them.

In Ancient Rome, around AD 10, the garment was used for cleanliness rather than warmth. It was called a focale or &quot;sudarium&quot; () and was used to wipe sweat from the neck and face in hot weather. Scarves were originally worn by men around their necks or were tied to belts.

In the 1200s, Egyptian belly dancers wore a scarf-like belt low on the hips to highlight their body movements.

===Modern Era===
Around the 17th century in Croatia, soldiers of all ranks wore scarves; officers wore silk scarves while other ranks were issued with cotton scarves. Some Croatian soldiers served as mercenaries with the French forces; their scarves were sometimes referred to as &quot;cravats&quot; (from the French &quot;cravate&quot;, meaning &quot;Croat&quot;), and were the precursor to the necktie. The modern British &quot;cravat&quot; is called an &quot;ascot&quot; in American English.

During the French Revolution, women and men wore differently coloured scarves to display their political affiliations to democratic principles of &quot;Liberté&quot;, &quot;Egalité&quot;, &quot;Fraternité&quot;; and &quot;Cravates&quot;. The French epitomised the elegant scarf style. The French word for &quot;scarf&quot; is a derivative of the Croatian word &quot;Karvata&quot;.

In the New England region of North America, bereaved families were given a scarf as a thank-you gift, as a mark of respect.

Napoleon Bonaparte found Egyptian scarves attractive and bought them as gifts for his wife. After this gift, Empress Josephine Bonaparte is believed to have acquired over 400 scarves in the following three years costing about £80,000. Following this, the people of Paisley, Scotland, started manufacturing their own scarves.

The scarf became a real fashion accessory by the early 19th century for both men and women.

====Twentieth century====
During World War I and II, women in the United States considered it a patriotic duty to knit scarves for the soldiers, along with other necessities. During these two wars, fighter pilots wore scarves to keep themselves warm in high altitudes and to cover their necks.

By the middle of the 20th century, scarves became one of the most versatile clothing accessories for both men and women. Throughout the 20th century, the fashion industry adopted the scarf. Thierry Hermès of Hermès created silk scarves that were modelled on those Napoleon&#x27;s soldiers wore in battle. Hermes started making scarves that were designed by some of the biggest names in the fashion and music industries in Hollywood; actor Grace Kelly sported one of Hermes&#x27;s scarves. Hermes imported raw silk from China that was made into long-lasting high-quality fabric with hand print; the process involved 43 screens to produce colour effects, and this printed scarf design was exhibited in a picture by two women in white wigs playing a game.

Silk scarves were also modelled by actors Faye Dunaway in &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; (1967) and Diane Keaton in &quot;Annie Hall&quot; (1977). Madonna, in the 1980s, corralled her perm with a scarf. Alexander McQueen&#x27;s much-copied silk-skull scarves have generated rage among celebrities and fans.

==Uses and types==
There are many types of scarf, including neck scarves, ponchos, head scarves, and kercheifs. They are chiefly worn around the neck or head.

Winter scarves are used in cold climates; these are often knitted; and commonly made of wool. The winter scarf is sometimes called a muffler, and is usually accompanied by a heavy jacket or coat. The winter scarf can be wrapped around the face and ears for additional protection from cold.

In dry, dusty, warm climates or environments with airborne contaminants, a thin headscarf, kerchief or bandanna is often worn over the eyes, nose, and mouth to keep the hair clean. This custom has evolved into a fashionable item in many cultures, particularly among women. The cravat, an ancestor of the necktie and bow tie, evolved from scarves of this sort in Croatia From the keffiyeh, a headscarf worn by men in the Middle East has come the Palestinian keffiyeh, worn to symbolise support for the cause of Palestine.

In India, woollen scarves with Bandhani work adopting tie-and-dye techniques are commonly worn in Bhuj and Mandvi in the Kutch District of Gujarat. In India and elsewhere there is a trend of wearing a scarf or dupatta as a safeguard against pollution.

In Indonesia and Malaysia the &quot;slenddang&quot; is a native scarf or sash, wide and long that is worn principally by the Malaysian women, being draped over one shoulder and across the body diagonally. They are both printed and coloured.

Scarves that are used to cover the lower part of the face, and in particular the neck, are sometimes called cowls. Scarves can colloquially be called a &quot;neck-wrap&quot;.

Scarves can be tied in many ways, including the pussy-cat bow, the square knot, the cowboy bib, the ascot knot, the loop, the necktie, and the gipsy kerchief. Scarves have also been tied on the head as a headscarf. Monarchs, including Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth I, have worn the headscarf. During the late 1990s, it was a fashion trend with hip hop and R&amp;B artists. During the period of silent films, actors Anna May Wong and Evelyn Brent wore headscarves of sophisticated silks and popularised them. In Islamic religious culture, wearing a head scarf is linked to the Quran. In Saudi Arabia, wearing a head scarf is necessary to face the harsh climate and intense heat, even before Islam was adopted. During the same period, Christians and Jews also covered their hair with veils as dictated by their sacred texts.

Scarves are also used as fashion accessories with evening gowns by draping them over the shoulders or arms; one example is the feather boa.

===In religious or cultural use===
The ecclesiastical scarf was originally a loose wrap or muffler (band) that was worn around the neck when out of doors. In the English Church, in post-Reformation times, the minister wore the scarf over the surplice, which was a broad band of black silk with fringed ends arranged like the stole around the neck but falling nearly to the feet. The scarf&#x27;s use has been almost entirely replaced by that of the stole, with which it has sometimes been confused.

Several Christian denominations include a scarf known as a stole as part of their liturgical vestments. In the English Church, the scarf of colour made of black silk, which is twice the width of a stole, is worn around the neck of chaplains, doctors of religion, and other clergy. Mourners at funerals wear a black scarf made of silk or crape over the right shoulder. Scarves of coloured silk are worn on public occasions, and in the courts and lodges by members of many social orders, such as Foresters and Odd fellows.

In a procession organised by the Masonic Lodge, marshals wear a cocked hat, sword, and scarf. In the procession, the colour of the scarf is mandatorily blue for Subordinate Lodge and purple for the Grand Lodge.

The khata is a scarf used in Himalayan buddhist tradition as an offering or a gift, usually white in Tibetan tradition but elsewhere blue or other colours.

===In uniforms===

Pilots of early aircraft wore white, silken scarves and knitted scarfs to keep oily smoke from the exhaust out of their mouths while flying. Pilots of closed-cockpit aircraft wore scarves to prevent neck chafing, especially by fighter pilots, who were constantly turning their heads from side to side, watching for enemy aircraft. Today, military flight crews wear scarves imprinted with unit insignia and emblems for &quot;esprit-de-corps&quot; and heritage reasons rather than practical purposes.

The dress code adopted by pilots and cabin crew has changed over time. In the early years of flying, aircraft pilots copied the pilots of World War I, and adopted silk scarves and gloves as part of their outfit of flying boots and leather bomber jackets. Modern commercial airline pilot&#x27;s uniform has a nautical look. The flight attendant&#x27;s uniform has also undergone substantial changes; many female uniforms include a scarf. The modern trend is to follow national traditions of dress. In this context, female cabin crew of Emirate Airlines wear a drape scarf. Thai Airways female cabin crew wear pink and purple silks with sashes; Fiji Airways female crew wear scarves with bula prints. Air Canada&#x27;s dictum is; &quot;Wear your scarf at all times&quot;.

Students in the United Kingdom and Ireland traditionally wear academic scarves with distinctive combinations of colours identifying their university or college. This scarf is made from Saxony wool and usually measures in length, with a rectangular shape, and two or more longitudinal coloured stripes.

Members of the Scout Movement wear a scarf, sometimes called a neckerchief, as part of their uniform. The Scout scarf was copied from common frontier, rural and outdoor wear. Such a scarf can be used to cover the face from dust or sun or for first aid with a bleeding injury or as a splint, sling or bandage. Some communist Young Pioneers wore a red scarf and some fascist Balilla and the Hitler Youth wore scarves.

===In sport===

At football matches, supporters wear scarves and shirts in club colours. Scarves have been worn in the UK since at least the early 1930s, when the phenomenon of scarves began in Britain. Scarf-wearing became common in 1970s. Team scarves in football matches represent fans&#x27; loyalty and are an insignia rather than a protective piece of clothing. They are usually about long and wide. Scarf sales are an important part of the football economy throughout Europe. In the late 1990s, coloured scarves have been traditional supporter wear for fans of association football (soccer) teams across the world, even those in warmer climates. These scarves come in a wide variety of sizes and are made in team colours, and designs may include:

* The club or team crest
* Pictures of renowned players
* Various slogans relating to the club&#x27;s history and its rivalry with others

Initially, two-coloured scarves were called granny scarves because the players&#x27; grandmothers knitted them. At some clubs, supporters sometimes perform a &quot;scarf wall&quot; in which all supporters in a section of the stadium will stretch out their scarves above their heads, creating a wall of colour.

This scarf wall is usually accompanied by the singing of a club anthem, such as &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; at Liverpool F.C. matches, or national anthems such as &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; at France national football team matches. The socio-cultural anthropology of football is compared to a religious service by way of raising hands, singing the club&#x27;s anthem, shouting slogans, jumping up, and whistling and clapping. By the end of the 19th century, in Britain, football had changed from an amateur game of the bourgeois into a professional, working class sport, and later an international spectacle.

Half-and-half scarves, where each half of the design represents one of the teams playing, are also sold at matches. Also known as friendship or matchday scarves, they are popular with neutral spectators as souvenirs, but are the subject of some controversy among more partisan fans.

Under Aussie rules, the Australian Football League (AFL) commands the country&#x27;s largest sport audiences. At matches, fans wear apparel including scarves, knitted hats, and shirts.

==Manufacture==
The knitting garments such as scarves is an important trade in some countries. Hand-knitted scarves are still common as gifts.

Printed scarves are offered internationally through high-fashion design houses, including Burberry, Missoni, Alexander McQueen, Valentino, Cole Haan, Chanel, Etro, Lanvin, Louis Vuitton and Prada.

Hermès, which made its first scarf in 1937, has produced more than 2,000 designs. In 1937, Hermès designed a woodblock scarf made of Chinese silk that was worn by Queen Elizabeth II of England, American First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and Grace Kelly.

The basic scarf shapes are square, triangular, and rectangular. The most common type is the square scarf, which can be folded to form a rectangular or triangular scarf. A sash is usually a long, narrow rectangle. The size of either can range from mini to maxi. The style of the garment with which the finished scarf is worn will make a difference, as will the way it is tied.

<doc id="493250" wikidata="Q729969" url="?curid=493250" title="Sir William Jardine, 7th Baronet">
<text>Sir William Jardine, 7th Baronet of Applegarth FRS FRSE FLS FSA (23 February 1800 – 21 November 1874) was a Scottish naturalist. He is known for his editing of a long series of natural history books, &quot;The Naturalist&#x27;s Library&quot;.

==Life and work==
Jardine was born on 23 February 1800 at 28 North Hanover Street in Edinburgh, the son of Sir Alexander Jardine, 6th baronet of Applegarth and his wife, Jane Maule. He was educated in both York and Edinburgh then studied medicine at Edinburgh University.

From 1817 to 1821 he lodged with Rev Dr Andrew Grant at James Square, an arrangement made by his father. Grant was minister of St Andrew&#x27;s Church on George Street.

In his early years, aged only 25, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh his proposer being Sir David Brewster.

He was a co-founder of the Berwickshire Naturalists&#x27; Club, and contributed to the founding of the Ray Society. He was &quot;keenly addicted to field-sports, and a master equally of the rod and the gun&quot;. While ornithology was his main passion, he also studied ichthyology, botany and geology. His book on fossil burrows and traces, the &quot;Ichnology of Annandale&quot;, included fossils from his ancestral estate. He was the first to coin the term &quot;ichnology&quot;, and this was the first book written on the subject. His private natural history museum and library are said to have been the finest in Britain.

Jardine made natural history available to all levels of Victorian society by editing the hugely popular forty volumes of The Naturalist&#x27;s Library (1833–1843) issued and published by his brother in law, the Edinburgh printer and engraver, William Home Lizars. The series was divided into four main sections: Ornithology (14 volumes), Mammalia (13 volumes), Entomology (7 volumes), and Ichthyology (6 volumes); each prepared by a leading naturalist. James Duncan wrote the insect volumes. The artists responsible for the illustrations included Edward Lear. The work was published in Edinburgh by W. H. Lizars. The frontispiece is a portrait of Pierre André Latreille.

His other publications included an edition of Gilbert White&#x27;s &quot;Natural History of Selborne&quot; which re-established White&#x27;s reputation, &quot;Illustrations of Ornithology&quot; (1825–1843), and an affordable edition of Alexander Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Birds of America&quot;.

Jardine described of a number of bird species, alone or in conjunction with his friend Prideaux John Selby. He died on 21 November 1874 in Sandown, Isle of Wight.

==Family and descendants==
He was married to Jane Home Lizars, and through her was brother-in-law to John Lizars FRSE and William Home Lizars.
After Lady Jardine&#x27;s death he married the daughter of the Rev. William Samuel Symonds, the well-known geologist.

Jardine&#x27;s daughter, Catherine Dorcas Maule Jardine, married Hugh Edwin Strickland and produced many of the illustrations for &quot;Illustrations of Ornithology&quot; (identifiable by her initials, CDMS).

The Olympic rower Sir Matthew Pinsent is a direct descendant of Jardine.

<doc id="493251" wikidata="Q225201" url="?curid=493251" title="Avitus of Vienne">
<text>Alcimus Ecdicius Avitus (c. 450 – February 5, 517/518 or 519) was a Latin poet and bishop of Vienne in Gaul. His fame rests in part on his poetry, but also on the role he played as secretary for the Burgundian kings.

Avitus was born of a prominent Gallo-Roman senatorial family related to Emperor Avitus.

==Life==
His father was Hesychius, bishop of Vienne, where episcopal honors were informally hereditary. His paternal grandfather was a western Roman emperor whose precise identity is not known. Apollinaris of Valence was his younger brother; their sister Fuscina became a nun.

Avitus was probably born at Vienne, for he was baptized by bishop Mamertus. About 490 he was ordained bishop of Vienne. In 499 Vienne was captured by Gundobad, king of the Burgundians, who was at war with Clovis, king of the Franks, where he came to the attention of that king. Avitus, as metropolitan of southern and eastern Gaul, took the lead in a conference between the Catholic and Arian bishops held in presence of Gundobad at Sardiniacum near Lyons. He won the confidence of King Gundobad, and converted his son, King Sigismund to Catholicism.

A letter of Pope Hormisdas to Avitus records that he was made vicar apostolic in Gaul by that pontiff; and in 517 he presided in this capacity at the Council of Epaon for restoring ecclesiastical discipline in Gallia Narbonensis. Avitus appears also to have exerted himself to terminate the dispute between the churches of Rome and Constantinople which arose out of the excommunication of Acacius; his later letters suggest that this was accomplished before his death.

Upon his death, Avitus was buried in the monastery of St. Peter and St. Paul at Vienne.

== Writings ==
The literary fame of Avitus rests on his many surviving letters (his recent editors make them ninety-six in all) and on a long poem, &quot;Poematum de Mosaicae historiae gestis&quot; (also known as &quot;De spiritualis historiae gestis&quot;), in classical hexameters, in five books, dealing with the Biblical themes of original sin, expulsion from Paradise, the Deluge, and the Crossing of the Red Sea. The first three books offer a certain dramatic unity; in them are told the preliminaries of the great disaster, the catastrophe itself, and the consequences. The fourth and fifth books deal with the Deluge and the Crossing of the Red Sea as symbols of baptism. Avitus deals freely and familiarly with the Scriptural events, and exhibits well their beauty, sequence, and significance. He is one of the last masters of the art of rhetoric as taught in the schools of Gaul in the 4th and 5th centuries. His poetic diction, though abounding in archaisms and rhythmic redundancy, is pure and select, and the laws of metre are well observed. Writing in the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, Thomas Joseph Shahan says &quot;that Milton made use of his paraphrase of Scripture in writing &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;.&quot; Avitus also wrote a poem for his sister Fuscina, a nun, &quot;De consolatoriâ castitatis laude&quot;.
The letters of Avitus are of considerable importance for the ecclesiastical and political history of the years between 499 and 518. Like his contemporary, Ennodius of Pavia, he was strenuous in his assertion of the authority of the Apostolic See as the chief bulwark of religious unity and the incipient Christian civilization. &quot;If the pope,&quot; he says, &quot;is rejected, it follows that not one bishop, the whole episcopate threatens to fall&quot; (Si papa urbis vocatur in dubium, episcopatus videbitur, non episcopus, vaccilare. — Ep. xxxiv; ed. Peiper). His letters are also among the important primary sources of early Merovingian political, ecclesiastical, and social history. Among them is a famous letter to Clovis on the occasion of his baptism. Avitus addresses Clovis not as if he was a pagan convert, but as if he was a recent Arian sympathiser, possibly even a catechumen. The letters document the close relations between the Catholic Bishop of Vienne and the Arian king of the Burgundians, the great Gundobad, and his son, the Catholic convert Sigismund.

There was once extant a collection of his homilies and sermons, but they have all perished except for two, and some fragments and excerpts from others.

The so-called &quot;Dialogues with King Gundobad&quot;, written to defend the Catholic faith against the Arians and which purports to represent the famous Colloquy of Lyon in 449, was once believed to be his work. Julien Havet demonstrated in 1885, however, that it is a forgery of the Oratorian, Jérôme Vignier, who also forged a letter purporting to be from Pope Symmachus to Avitus.

<doc id="493256" wikidata="Q3182145" url="?curid=493256" title="John Murray Forbes">
<text>John Murray Forbes (February 23, 1813 – October 12, 1898) was an American railroad magnate, merchant, philanthropist and abolitionist. He was president of both the Michigan Central railroad and the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad in the 1850s. He kept doing business with Russell &amp; Company.

==Early life==
Forbes was born on February 23, 1813, in Bordeaux, France. His father, Ralph Bennett Forbes, was a member of the Forbes family, descended from Scottish immigrants who attempted unsuccessfully to start a trade from Bordeaux. His mother, Margaret Perkins, was a member of the Boston Brahmin Perkins family merchant dynasty involved in the China trade. Among his siblings, his older brother was Robert Bennet Forbes, sea captain and China merchant.

His paternal uncle was John Murray Forbes, lawyer and diplomat, and his maternal uncle was merchant Thomas Handasyd Perkins. Among his cousins was the botanist Francis Blackwell Forbes.

In 1814, his parents moved back to the Captain Robert Bennet Forbes House in Milton, Massachusetts. Forbes attended school at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, then at Round Hill School in Northampton, Massachusetts, from 1823 to 1828.

==Career==
Forbes was one of three brothers sent by their uncle to Canton, China, and achieved some financial success during a short time spent trading opium in Canton. However, unlike his brother Robert, who devoted himself to the China trade, Forbes returned to Boston and became an early railroad investor and landowner.

As with Jay Gould and E. H. Harriman, Forbes was an important figure in the building of America&#x27;s railroad system. From March 28, 1846, through 1855, he was president of Michigan Central Railroad, and he was a director and president of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, he helped with the growth of the American Middle West. In addition, he founded J.M. Forbes &amp; Co., an investment firm in Boston in 1838.

In 1860, he was an elector for Abraham Lincoln. He served as the Chairman of the Republican National Committee during the administration of President Abraham Lincoln. Staunchly pro-Union, he is given credit for founding the New England Loyal Publication Society in early 1863 (Smith 1948). After the Civil War, Forbes was elected as a 3rd Class (honorary) Companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.

Forbes was a delegate to the Republican conventions of 1876, 1880 and 1884, he eventually became displeased with the Republican party and worked successfully to get Democrat Grover Cleveland elected president.

===Philanthropy===
He supplied money and weapons to New Englanders to fight slavery in Kansas and in 1859 entertained John Brown.

Forbes&#x27;s many philanthropic activities included the re-establishment of Milton Academy, a preparatory school south of Boston, Massachusetts in 1884.

==Personal life==
Forbes married Sarah Swain Hathaway (1813–1900). They resided in Milton, Massachusetts, and summered on Naushon Island in Dukes County, Massachusetts. They had two sons and four daughters:

* Ellen Randolph Forbes (1838–1860).
* Alice Hathaway Forbes (1838–1917), who married Edward Montague Cary (1828–1888) in 1875.
* William Hathaway Forbes (1840–1897), who married Edith Emerson (1841–1929), the daughter of poet Ralph Waldo Emerson. William became the first president of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and father of William Cameron Forbes.
* Mary Hathaway Forbes (1844–1916), who married Henry Sturgis Russell (1838–1905) in 1863.
* John Malcolm Forbes (1847–1904), the yachtsman and horseman who married Sarah Coffin Jones (1852–1891) in 1873.
* Sarah Forbes (1853–1917), who married William Hastings Hughes (1833–1909) in 1887.

Forbes died of pneumonia on October 12, 1898, in Milton, Massachusetts.

===Descendants===
His cousin Francis Blackwell Forbes (1839–1908) is the great-grandfather of 2004 U.S. Democratic presidential candidate John Forbes Kerry. His 4x great-grandson is Jonathan Meath, a renowned Emmy award-winning television producer.

===Legacy===
In the September 1899 issue of &quot;Atlantic&quot; magazine, Edward Waldo Emerson (Ralph Waldo Emerson&#x27;s son), published Forbes&#x27; biography. The Emerson and Forbes families were close as Forbes&#x27; son, William, married Ralph&#x27;s daughter, Edith Emerson. In &quot;Letters and Social Aims&quot;, Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote of Forbes:

&quot;Never was such force, good meaning, good sense, good action, combined with such domestic lovely behavior, such modesty and persistent preference for others. Wherever he moved he was the benefactor... How little this man suspects, with his sympathy for men and his respect for lettered and scientific people, that he is not likely, in any company, to meet a man superior to himself,&quot; and &quot;I think this is a good country that can bear such a creature as he.&quot;

The small community of Forbes, Missouri, is named for him.

<text>Prideaux John Selby FRSE FLS (23 July 1788 – 27 March 1867) was an English ornithologist, botanist and natural history artist.

==Life==

Selby was born in Bondgate Street in Alnwick in Northumberland, the eldest son of George Selby of Beal and Twizell (d.1804), and his wife, Margaret Cook. He was educated at Durham School.

He studied at University College, Oxford. He succeeded in 1804 to the family estates at Beal, and added to the landholdings there at a cost of some £14000 in about 1840. He sold the Beal estate amounting to in 1850 for £47000 (£ at today&#x27;s prices).
He died at Twizell House and was buried in Bamburgh churchyard.

==Family==

In 1810, he married Lewis Tabitha Mitford (1782–1859) daughter of Bertram Osbaldeston Mitford (1748–1800) of Dennet&#x27;s Hall in Leicester. They had three daughters.

==Work==

Selby is best known for his &quot;Illustrations of British Ornithology&quot; (1821–1834), the first set of life-sized illustrations of British birds. He also wrote &quot;Illustrations of Ornithology&quot; with William Jardine and &quot;A History of British Forest-trees&quot; (1842).

Many of the illustrations in his works were drawn from specimens in his collection. His wife’s first cousin and friend, Lt John Atherton of the 13th Light Dragoons who died on passage from Madras to England onboard the Rockingham in July 1827 sent a variety of specimens. Text appearing immediately before the following illustration states that Lt Atherton took the passage for the benefit of his health. 

Lt John Atherton, was the brother of Robert Atherton of Sri Lanka. 

In addition to the above works he contributed to Jardine&#x27;s &quot;Naturalist&#x27;s Library&quot; the volumes on the pigeons (1835) and the parrots (1836), the latter illustrated by Edward Lear. He was for some time one of the editors of the &quot;Magazine of Zoology and Botany&quot;.

His collections were sold in 1885 and became dispersed. The South African birds collected by Andrew Smith went to the Zoology Museum of the University of Cambridge.
