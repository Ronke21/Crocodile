<text>Rush Hour is a 1998 American buddy cop action comedy film directed by Brett Ratner and written by Jim Kouf and Ross LaManna from a story by LaManna. It stars Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker as mismatched police officers who are assigned to rescue a Chinese diplomat&#x27;s abducted daughter. Tom Wilkinson, Chris Penn and Elizabeth Peña play supporting roles.

Released on September 18, 1998, the film received positive reviews from critics and grossed over $244 million worldwide. Its box office commercial success led to two sequels: &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot; (2001) and &quot;Rush Hour 3&quot; (2007).

==Plot==
On the last day of British rule of Hong Kong on June 30, 1997, Detective Inspector Lee of the Royal Hong Kong Police Force leads a raid at the wharf, hoping to arrest the unidentified, anonymous crime lord Juntao. He finds only Sang, Juntao&#x27;s right-hand man, who escapes in a boat. Lee recovers numerous Chinese cultural treasures stolen by Juntao, which he presents as a farewell victory gift to his departing superiors, Chinese consul Solon Han and British police commander Thomas Griffin.

Two months later after Han takes up his new diplomatic post in Los Angeles, Han&#x27;s daughter Soo Yung is kidnapped by Sang while on her way to school. Han calls Lee to assist in the case, but the FBI, fearing that Lee&#x27;s involvement could cause an international incident, pawns him off on the LAPD. Detective James Carter, a talented but obnoxious LAPD officer who is disliked by the rest of his precinct for his self-aggrandizing attitude, is tricked into &quot;babysitting&quot; Lee as punishment for botching a sting operation under the guise of an arms deal. When Carter finds out, he decides to solve the case. Carter takes Lee on a sightseeing tour, keeping him away from the embassy while contacting informants about the kidnapping. Lee gets into trouble at a bar when Carter tells him to follow his lead, resulting in Lee calling a black bartender the N-word, not knowing it is derogatory and offensive. Several black patrons attack Lee as a result, forcing him to defeat them. Carter tries to prevent Lee from leaving him but Lee makes his own way to the Chinese Consulate, where Han and the FBI await news about his daughter. While arguing with Special Agent in Charge Warren Russ, Carter unwittingly negotiates with Sang, arranging a $50 million ransom drop.

The FBI traces the call to a warehouse, where a team of agents are killed by plastic explosive. Spotting Sang nearby, Lee and Carter give chase but he escapes, dropping the detonator. Carter&#x27;s colleague, LAPD bomb expert Tania Johnson, traces it to Clive Cobb, the man arrested by Carter in the earlier botched sting operation. Lee presses Clive into revealing his business relationship with Juntao, whom he met at the Foo Chow restaurant in Chinatown. Clive is initially unwilling to speak to the duo but Lee shows him a picture of Soo Yung, causing him to relent. Lee then begins to earn Carter&#x27;s trust. Carter goes to the restaurant alone and sees a surveillance video of Juntao carrying Soo Yung into a van. Lee arrives and saves Carter from Juntao&#x27;s syndicate, but they are taken off the case as the FBI blames them for the botched ransom drop, with Lee sent back to Hong Kong. However, Carter refuses to give up and appeals to Johnson for assistance to sneak on board Lee&#x27;s plane, where he persuades the Hong Kong detective to help stop Juntao together.

Griffin later involves himself in the case, revealing more about the HKPF&#x27;s past with Juntao&#x27;s syndicate, and implores Han to pay the ransom to avoid further bloodshed. At the opening of a Chinese art exhibition at the Los Angeles Convention Center, overseen by Han and Griffin, the now $70 million ransom is delivered, and Carter, Lee, and Johnson enter disguised as guests. Carter orders the guests to evacuate for safety, angering the FBI, but Lee catches Griffin accepting a remote for the detonator from Sang. Lee and Johnson realize Griffin is Juntao when Carter recognizes him from the Chinatown surveillance tape. Griffin threatens to detonate a bomb vest attached to Soo Yung and demands that the ransom be paid in full, as compensation for the priceless Chinese artifacts which Lee recovered in his raid. Juntao&#x27;s men start a shootout with the FBI while Carter sneaks out, locates Soo Yung in the van, and drives it into the building within range of Griffin, preventing him from setting off the vest.

Johnson gets the vest off Soo Yung, while Griffin heads to the roof with the bag of money. Lee takes the vest and pursues Griffin, while Carter shoots Sang dead in a gunfight and saves Russ. Lee has a brief altercation with Griffin that culminates in both dangling from the rafters. Griffin, holding on to the vest, falls to his death when its straps are torn, but when Lee falls, Carter catches him with a large flag. Han and Soo Yung are reunited and Han sends Carter and Lee on vacation to Hong Kong as a reward. Before Carter leaves, agents Russ and Whitney offer him a position in the FBI, which he mockingly refuses, proudly stating he is LAPD. Carter boards the plane with Lee, who annoyingly starts singing Edwin Starr&#x27;s &quot;War&quot; off-key. A desperate Carter yells for a stewardess, demanding that she give him another seat.

== Production ==
&quot;Rush Hour&quot; began as a spec script written in 1995 by screenwriter Ross LaManna. The screenplay was sold by LaManna&#x27;s William Morris agent Alan Gasmer to Hollywood Pictures, a division of the Walt Disney Company, with Arthur Sarkissian attached as producer. After attaching director Brett Ratner and developing the project for more than a year with producers including Sarkissian, Jonathan Glickman and Roger Birnbaum, Disney Studios chief Joe Roth put the project into turnaround, citing concerns about the $34 million budget, and Jackie Chan&#x27;s appeal to American audiences. Several studios were interested in acquiring the project. New Line Cinema was confident in Ratner, having done &quot;Money Talks&quot; with him, so they made a hard commitment to a budget and start date for &quot;Rush Hour&quot;.

Martin Lawrence, Wesley Snipes, Chris Rock, Eddie Murphy and Dave Chappelle were considered for the role of Detective James Carter; Murphy turned down the role to do &quot;Holy Man&quot; instead while Snipes turned down the role in favor of &quot;Blade&quot;, which was also for New Line Cinema. Chan wanted Lawrence for the role, but he turned it down due to a low offer.

After the success of &quot;Rumble in the Bronx&quot;, Ratner wanted to put Chan in a buddy-cop movie, not as a co-star or sidekick but on equal footing with an American star. Ratner flew to South Africa where Chan was filming and pitched the film. A few days later Chan agreed to star and not long after flew to Los Angeles and met Chris Tucker, the latter actor who ended up taking the role as Detective James Carter.

Ratner credited Tucker with getting his first feature film &quot;Money Talks&quot; and thought Tucker and Chan would make a great team. Filming began on November 30, 1997. Shooting took place mainly in locations around the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area, including the Los Angeles Convention Center, Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theater, Greystone Mansion, Ennis House, and Long Beach Airport. The opening sequence was shot in Hong Kong.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;Rush Hour&quot; opened at No. 1 in September 1998 at the North American box office, with a weekend gross of $33 million. It surpassed &quot;The First Wives Club&quot; to have the highest September opening weekend and &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; to have the biggest opening weekend for a New Line Cinema film. The film would hold latter record until the following June when &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot; took it. &quot;Rush Hour&quot; would continue to hold the September record for three more years until it was surpassed by &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; in 2002. Overall, it would top the box office for two weeks before getting displaced by &quot;Antz&quot;. &quot;Rush Hour&quot; grossed over $140 million in the US and $103 million in the rest of the world, for a total worldwide gross over $244 million.

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, &quot;Rush Hour&quot; holds an approval rating of 62% based on 77 reviews and an average score of 6.2/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;While it won&#x27;t win any awards for originality, the combustible chemistry between its stars means &quot;Rush Hour&quot; hits just as hard on either side of the action-comedy divide.&quot; On Metacritic, the film received a weighted average score of 61 out of 100 based on 23 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert praised both Jackie Chan, for his entertaining action sequences without the use of stunt doubles, and Chris Tucker, for his comical acts in the film, and how they formed an effective comedic duo. Joe Leydon of &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a frankly formulaic but raucously entertaining action comedy&quot;. Leydon is critical of the editing, saying that it &quot;works against Chan by breaking up the flow of his frenzied physicality.&quot; Charles Taylor of Salon.com is critical of Hollywood misusing Jackie Chan: &quot;Chan is a one-of-a-kind performer: Bruce Lee crossed with Donald O&#x27;Connor in the &quot;Make &#x27;em Laugh&quot; number from &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;. Hollywood needs to stop treating him as if he were one of those fondue sets given as wedding gifts in the &#x27;70s: a foreign novelty shoved in a closet due to absolute cluelessness about what to do with it.&quot;

Michael O&#x27;Sullivan of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; calls the film a &quot;misbegotten marriage of sweet and sour&quot; and says, &quot;The problem is it can&#x27;t make up its mind and, unlike Reese&#x27;s Peanut Butter Cups, the sharply contrasting flavors of these ingredients only leave a bad taste in the customer&#x27;s mouth.&quot; O&#x27;Sullivan says Tucker is miscast, the script &quot;perfunctory and sloppy&quot;, and the direction &quot;limp, lethargic&quot;. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a grade &quot;C−&quot; and was critical of the buddy comedy, saying, &quot;The two characters barely even have a relationship; they&#x27;re a union of demographics—the &quot;urban&quot; market meets the slapstick-action market.&quot;

Chan has expressed dissatisfaction with the film: &quot;I didn’t like the movie. I still don’t like the movie.&quot; Chan continued: &quot;I don’t like the way I speak English, and I don’t know what Chris Tucker is saying&quot;. Although he respects the box-office success of &quot;Rush Hour&quot;, Chan said he preferred the films he made in his native Hong Kong because they delivered more fight scenes: &quot;If you see my Hong Kong movies, you know what happens: Bam bam bam, always Jackie Chan-style, me, 10 minutes of fighting.&quot;

== Cultural influence ==
&quot;Rush Hour&quot; was the catalyst for the creation of the review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes. Senh Duong, the website&#x27;s founder and a Jackie Chan fan, was inspired to create the website after collecting all the reviews of Chan&#x27;s Hong Kong action films as they were being released in the United States. In anticipation of &quot;Rush Hour&quot;, Chan&#x27;s first major Hollywood crossover, he coded the website in two weeks and the site went live shortly before the film&#x27;s release.

== Sequels ==
A sequel, &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot;, which was primarily set in Hong Kong, was released in 2001. A third film, &quot;Rush Hour 3&quot;, which was primarily set in Paris, was released on August 10, 2007. Tucker earned $25 million for his role in the third film and Chan received the film&#x27;s distribution rights in Asia.

In 2007, before the release of &quot;Rush Hour 3&quot;, Ratner was optimistic about making a fourth film and potentially having it set in Moscow. In 2017, Chan agreed to a potential script for &quot;Rush Hour 4&quot; after years of turning down scripts.

== Music ==
Edwin Starr&#x27;s &quot;War&quot; was used as the ending theme for the film.

The film&#x27;s soundtrack features the hit single &quot;Can I Get A...&quot; by Jay-Z, Ja Rule and Amil, as well as tracks by Flesh-n-Bone, Wu-Tang Clan, Dru Hill, Charli Baltimore and Montell Jordan.

The official soundtrack album was certified platinum on January 21, 1999.

<text>Henry Martyn Leland (February 16, 1843 – March 26, 1932) was an American machinist, inventor, engineer, and automotive entrepreneur. He founded the two premier American luxury automotive marques, Cadillac and Lincoln.

==Early years==
Henry M. Leland was born to Leander and Zilpha, the youngest of 8, in Vermont in 1843. Sources differ on the town of his birth (Danville versus Barton); he grew up in Barton. He learned engineering and precision machining in the Brown &amp; Sharpe plant at Providence, Rhode Island. He subsequently worked in the firearms industry, including at Colt. These experiences in toolmaking, metrology, and manufacturing steeped him in the 19th-century zeitgeist of interchangeability.

He applied this expertise to the nascent motor industry as early as 1870 as a principal in the machine shop Leland &amp; Faulconer, and later was a supplier of engines to Ransom E. Olds&#x27;s Olds Motor Vehicle Company, later to be known as Oldsmobile. He also invented the electric barber clippers, and for a short time produced a unique toy train, the Leland-Detroit Monorail.

==Cadillac==

Leland created the Cadillac automobile, later bought out by General Motors. In 1902, William Murphy and his partners at the Henry Ford Company hired Leland to appraise the company&#x27;s factory and tooling prior to liquidation. Leland completed the appraisal, but he advised Murphy and his partners that they were making a mistake to liquidate, and suggested they instead reorganize, building a new car powered by a single-cylinder engine Leland had originally developed for Oldsmobile. The directors lost no time in renaming the company Cadillac. At Cadillac, Leland applied many modern manufacturing principles to the fledgling automotive industry, including the use of interchangeable parts. Alfred P. Sloan, longtime president and chair of General Motors, considered Leland to be &quot;one of those mainly responsible for bringing the technique of interchangeable parts into automobile manufacturing.&quot;

The Cadillac won the Dewar Trophy for 1908, which was actually presented in 1909.

Leland sold Cadillac to General Motors on July 29, 1909, for $4.5 million, but remained as an executive until 1917. With Charles Kettering, he developed a self-starter for the Cadillac, which won its second Dewar Trophy in 1913 as a result. He prodded Kettering to design a workable electric starter after Byron Carter, a Cadillac engineer, was hit in the head by a starting crank when the engine backfired which later resulted in death.

He left General Motors in a dispute with company founder William C. Durant over producing materiel during World War I. Cadillac had been asked to build Liberty aircraft engines but Durant was a pacifist.

==Lincoln==

Leland formed the Lincoln Motor Company in 1917 with a $10,000,000 wartime contract to build the V12 Liberty aircraft engine. After the war, the company was reorganized, and the Lincoln Motor Company Plant was retooled to manufacture luxury automobiles. The V8 engine used in the first Lincoln automobiles is said to be influenced by the Liberty engine&#x27;s design.

In 1922, Lincoln became insolvent and was bought out by Henry Ford&#x27;s Ford Motor Company. Ford&#x27;s bid of $8 million was the only bid at a receivers sale. Ford had first offered $5 million, but the judge would not accept it for a well-equipped company whose assets were conservatively estimated at $16 million. Ford had deliberately low-balled his offer as revenge for Leland&#x27;s role in the creation of Cadillac.

After the sale, Leland and his son Wilfred continued to run the company, believing they would still have full control to run the company as they saw fit. Ford assigned a number of their employees to Lincoln, ostensibly to learn from the latter. However, it soon became clear they were there to streamline their production and stop the loss of money that had bankrupted Lincoln. Relations between the workers of Henry Ford and Leland continued to deteriorate.

On June 10, 1922, Ford executive Ernest Liebold arrived at Lincoln to ask for the resignation of Wilfred Leland. When it became clear that Liebold had the full authority of Henry Ford, Henry Leland resigned as well. That afternoon both men were shown out of the factory they had created.

The Lincoln continues to be part of the luxury line of Ford to the present. Leland had no connection to the Lincoln Motor Car Works, a marque sold by Sears-Roebuck from 1905 to 1915.

==Politics==
Progressivism in Detroit was energized by upper-middle-class men and women who felt a civic duty to uplift society by freeing it from the tyranny of corrupt politicians who worked hand in hand with unscrupulous saloonkeepers. Leland was an important leader, with his base in the Detroit Citizens League. Supported by Detroit&#x27;s business, professional, and Protestant religious communities, the League campaigned for a new city charter in 1918, an anti-saloon ordinance, and the open shop whereby a worker could get a job even if he did not belong to a labor union.

==Personal life==
Leland was the son of Leander Leland and Zilpha Tifft. He married Ellen Rhoda Hull (April 24, 1846 – January 15, 1914), the daughter of Elias Hull. They had three children: Martha Gertrude (1868–1912), Wilfred Chester (November 7, 1869 – 1958), and Miriam Edith (1872–1894). They were all born in Millbury, Massachusetts.

Henry M. Leland died in Detroit on March 26, 1932. He is buried there in Woodmere Cemetery.

<text>Tower Air was a certificated FAR 121 U.S. charter airline that also operated scheduled passenger service from 1983 until 2000 when the company declared bankruptcy and was liquidated. Scheduled flights were initially offered over a New York – Brussels – Tel Aviv route in addition to charter flights to Athens, Frankfurt, Rome, and Zurich. Short-lived New York – Los Angeles flights were introduced with the addition of an ex-Avianca Boeing 747-100 in 1984. The airline was headquartered in Building 178 and later in Hangar 17 at John F. Kennedy International Airport in Jamaica, Queens, New York City.

==History==
Tower Air was co-founded, majority-owned, and managed by Morris K. Nachtomi, an Israeli citizen who had emigrated to the United States. After a 30-year career with El Al, he moved to New York to start a passenger operation for Flying Tiger Line, Metro International Airways. After this airline shut down, Nachtomi acquired the &quot;Tower&quot; brand from a packaged tour agency called Tower Travel Corporation. Tower Air began charter service in 1983 and served a number of international destinations, with a focus on charter flights to Israel. Nachtomi eventually bought out his partners to control about three-quarters of the stock.

Arthur Fondlier, son of Sam Fondlier and the former Chief Financial Officer of Tower Air, was a passenger in the first-class section of Pan Am flight 103. His untimely death gave Morris Nachtomi much more freedom in management and cost-cutting.

The company won many contracts from the United States Department of Defense to transport armed forces personnel to overseas locations, and from the United Nations to transport troops to their peacekeeping missions all over the world. Tower often flew charters for groups of Muslim pilgrims to Mecca.

Tower Air&#x27;s main base of scheduled operations was John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. In the mid-1980s, the airline operated from the British Airways terminal at JFK (now Terminal 7). In the early 1990s, it operated from the former Eastern terminal. In 1993, Tower Air renovated and expanded Building 213, a former Pan Am hangar, to serve as its dedicated JFK terminal, adding three finger gates in 1995.

During the 1990-91 Gulf War, Tower Air evacuated US citizens from Tel Aviv using the otherwise empty return legs of military charter flights to the region. It eventually became the only US carrier providing scheduled service to Israel in 1991, using special war risk insurance provided by the Federal Aviation Administration. It opened a special departure terminal at Ben Gurion Airport in 1997.

The airline began running into financial and operational difficulties in the late 1990s. The airline lost $20 million in 1996. The 1997 Zagat Survey ranked Tower Air 59th out of 61 ranked carriers in terms of maintenance, ahead of only Valujet and Aeroflot, and in February 1998, the Federal Aviation Administration proposed two civil penalties totaling $276,000 for continuing to fly aircraft that required maintenance. The airline had attempted to cut costs by cannibalizing its own engines for spare parts, but was forced to borrow money to acquire new engines in 1998.

In January 1998 the FAA successfully sought to have the airline remove Guy Nachtomi, son of the Chairman and CEO, 24 years old at that time, from the position of Vice President-Operations. This was done in part because of the airline&#x27;s maintenance problems, as well as his lack of airline experience (he worked at Twentieth Century Fox until 1994). The junior Mr. Nachtomi continued service with the company in a capacity unrelated to maintenance as Vice President-Office of the Chairman.

The Department of Defense Commercial Airlift Review Board suspended Tower Air military charters from January 27 to February 12, 1999, pending an on-site review of its operations. At the same time, the airline lost an arbitration brought by the Association of Flight Attendants, claiming that Tower Air was lodging their flight attendants in dirty Tel Aviv hotels with poor security and bed bugs.

By 2000, a majority of Tower Air&#x27;s fleet (11 out of 19 aircraft) was out of service. Tower Air filed for protection under Chapter 11 bankruptcy on February 29, 2000, ceased all scheduled service on May 1, 2000 and surrendered their FAA air operator&#x27;s certificate on November 28, 2000. The airline&#x27;s bankruptcy trustee, Charles Stanziale, subsequently sued the airline&#x27;s directors and officers for &quot;driving the company into insolvency by indifference and egregious decision-making.&quot;

In 1997, a Boeing 747-200 US registration N618FF operated by Tower Air appeared in the movie &quot;Liar Liar&quot;. Its aircraft also appeared in the movie &quot;Turbulence (1997 film)&quot; the same year in their own livery and as the fictional Trans-Continental Airlines.

According to the Official Airline Guide (OAG), in early 1989 Tower Air was operating transatlantic flights from both New York John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) and Miami (MIA) with nonstops between New York and Brussels, Copenhagen and Oslo with direct one stop service to and from Tel Aviv, and nonstops between Miami and Copenhagen, Oslo and Stockholm.

==Aircraft==

Tower Air&#x27;s fleet consisted of Boeing 747s in both the −100 and −200 series, including both passenger and cargo aircraft. The airline operated a total of thirty 747s (fifteen −100 and fifteen −200 series) over its history. Several were converted to freighters following Tower&#x27;s bankruptcy. One former Tower Air 747-200 was converted to a hotel, the Jumbo Stay at Stockholm Arlanda Airport.

==Incidents and accidents==
On December 20, 1995, Tower Air Flight 41 from New York Kennedy to Miami veered off the runway during takeoff in a snowstorm resulting in one flight attendant receiving serious injuries and 24 passengers receiving minor injuries. The aircraft sustained heavy damage and was written off. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the probable cause of this accident was the captain&#x27;s failure to reject the takeoff in a timely manner when excessive nosewheel steering tiller inputs resulted in a loss of directional control on a slippery runway.

<text>Gennes is a former commune in the Maine-et-Loire department in western France. On 1 January 2016, it was merged into the new commune of Gennes-Val-de-Loire.

==History==
Gennes was the scene of a World War II battle in June 1940, during the Battle of Saumur during the last stages of the Battle of France. The French casualties, seventeen Cadets of the Cadre Noir Saumur Cavalry school, killed between 17 and 20 June 1940, are buried in the enclosure of the 11th century Saint-Eusèbe church built over an ancient Gallo-Roman sanctuary, on a hilltop overlooking the scene of their sacrifice.

The castle of Milly-le-Meugon, in its vicinity, was the property of the Maillé-Brézé family, closely related to the French royal family through the First Prince of the Blood, Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Condé.

<doc id="489829" wikidata="Q903903" url="?curid=489829" title="Dendragapus">
<text>The genus Dendragapus contains two closely related species of grouse that have often been treated as a single variable taxon (blue grouse). The two species are the dusky grouse (&quot;Dendragapus obscurus&quot;) and the sooty grouse (&quot;Dendragapus fuliginosus&quot;). In addition, the spruce grouse and Siberian grouse have been considered part of this genus.


==Description==
These are large grouse that inhabit highland regions of North America and Eurasia. The sooty grouse is found in the Pacific Coast Ranges and Sierra Nevada, and the dusky grouse in the Rocky Mountains. These two taxa were originally regarded as separate species, but were considered conspecific for much of the twentieth century. However, in 2006 the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union re-split them, following the DNA-based work of Barrowclough et al. (2004). whose results supported the earlier work of Brooks (1929) who regarded the two taxa as separate species based on morphology, behavior and vocalizations. The precise ranges of the two species are well-defined in the south, separated by extensive areas of unsuitable forest-free habitat, but somewhat uncertain in the north of the range of the genus where there is no separation; Barrowclough et al.&#x27;s study did not include these northern populations.

Adults have a long square tail, gray at the end (lighter in the sooty grouse). Adult males are mainly dark (especially sooty grouse) with a yellow (sooty grouse) or purplish (dusky grouse) throat air sac surrounded by white, and a yellow (sooty grouse) or yellow-to-red (dusky grouse) wattle over the eye during display. Adult females of both species are mottled brown with dark brown and white marks on the underparts.

Their breeding habitat is the edges of conifer and mixed forests in mountainous regions of North America and Eurasia. Their range is closely associated with that of various conifers. The nest is a scrape on the ground concealed under a shrub or log.

All species have healthy populations, except for some population decline and habitat loss of the sooty grouse at the southern end of its range in southern California, and the Siberian grouse which is considered near-threatened.

==Species==
===Extant Species===


===Fossils===
Late Pleistocene fossil species that have been described are &quot;Dendragapus gilli&quot; (western and west-central US), initially placed in a distinct genus Palaeotetrix, and &quot;Dendragapus lucasi&quot; (known only from Fossil Lake, US).

<text>&quot;&#x27;&quot; (; &#x27;National Song&#x27;) or &quot;&#x27;&quot; (&#x27;Anthem of Lithuania&#x27;), also known by its incipit &quot;&quot; (&#x27;Lithuania, Our Homeland&#x27;), is the national anthem of Lithuania. The music and lyrics were written in 1898 by Vincas Kudirka, when Lithuania was still part of the Russian Empire. The fifty-word poem was a condensation of Kudirka&#x27;s conceptions of the Lithuanian state, the Lithuanian people, and their past. Shortly before his death in 1899, the anthem was performed for Lithuanians living in Saint Petersburg, Russia.

The first public Lithuanian performance of the anthem took place in Vilnius in 1905, and it became the official national anthem in 1919, a year after Lithuania declared its independence.

&quot;Tautiška giesmė&quot; was reinstated in 1989 shortly before the reestablishment of Lithuanian independence and confirmed in the National Anthem Act of October 21, 1991. It was automatically included as the national anthem in 1992, when the new Constitution was ratified after independence from the Soviet Union was achieved. The status of &quot;Tautiška giesmė&quot; as the national anthem of Lithuania was further confirmed in 1999 with the passage of a national law stating this.

== Creation ==
At the time when the poem &quot;Lietuva, Tėvyne mūsų&quot; was written, Lithuania was part of the Russian Empire. Kudirka, a medical student at the University of Warsaw, was writing as a columnist for the newspaper &quot;Varpas&quot; (&#x27;The Bell&#x27;). In his &quot;Varpas&quot; columns, Kudirka urged Lithuanians to take pride in their heritage, discussed the problems the Russian Government was causing the Lithuanian population, and denounced those who wished to work for the Tsarist autocracy. In the course of writing for &quot;Varpas&quot;, he wrote down his thoughts on what Lithuania was and what it should be, resulting in the fifty-word poem &quot;Lietuva, Tėvynė mūsų&quot;.

The poem described the heroic past of Lithuania and exhorted its people to care for the land, care for humanity, and live in honor. Kudirka also urged the country to become a source of enlightenment and virtue. Without a melody, Kudirka took the time to compose the music just before dying of tuberculosis. Both the melody and the lyrics were printed in Varpas in September 1898. Upon his death in 1899, Kudirka&#x27;s tomb was engraved with the second stanza of the anthem (later destroyed by the authorities).

== History ==
=== Pre-independent Lithuania ===
Before Kudirka&#x27;s death, the first performance of the poem occurred in 1899 at a concert in St. Petersburg, Russia. The concert was conducted by Česlovas Sasnauskas and was attended by Lithuanians, which St. Petersburg had the largest population of at that time. The anthem was first performed in Lithuania during the Great Seimas of Vilnius on December 3, 1905.

=== Independent Lithuania ===
When Lithuania declared its independence from Russia in 1918, the song was declared the national anthem. It held this status until Lithuania was annexed into the Soviet Union during World War II. During the interwar period, there had been suggestions to modify the words to include a reference to God. It was decided, in Kudirka&#x27;s memory, that the lyrics should remain as he had written them.

=== Usage in German-occupied Lithuania ===
In 1942, between May 9 and May 12, the Marijampolė Commissariat took 580 young men as labour for the German Army Transportation Service. At the barracks, about 3000–4000 appeared, about two thirds of women and girls, and began to shout out: &quot;We are not Germans, do not go to the front.&quot; At that time, about 70% of the troops returned to the barracks yard to support the demonstration as well as students from the Marijampole Teachers Seminary and the Marijampole Gymnasium. The demonstrators sang Lithuanian liberation songs and &quot;Tautiška giesmė&quot;. When threatened with a fight by several insufficiently armed local commando soldiers, the protest turned violent with members of the crowd breaking some windows. Finally, the crowd gathered on the street to walk to the city. In that direction, the soldiers of the Wehrmacht stoned the truck.

While singing the national anthem, the Lithuanian policemen paid homage, and weighed on two of them. The soldiers of the 1st Police Battalion in the Marijampolė were completely passive, with regard, to the crowd.

=== Usage in the Lithuanian SSR ===
==== 1940–1941 ====

Immediately following the Soviet occupation of Lithuania, the government of the Lithuanian SSR published a new constitution, the Stalinist Constitution of the Lithuanian SSR, that regulates the usage of the new flag and the new coat of arms as a symbol of the socialist identity. However, in this constitution, there was no regulations on a regional anthem for the Lithuanian SSR. According to Soviet custom, all of the republics of the Soviet Union had the &quot;Internationale&quot; translated into their own language as regional anthems.

The officially-introduced &quot;Internationale&quot; in Lithuania was unpopular and the majority of the population of Lithuania disliked it as most Lithuanians then still remembered the &quot;Tautiška giesmė&quot; as being their actual national anthem. This was particularly evident when the authorities gathered all of the teachers in 14–15 August 1940 at the Lithuanian Teachers&#x27; Congress in Kaunas. The congress was attended by more than 10,000 primary and secondary school teachers and high school lecturers. Of all the speakers, only the Prime Minister of Lithuania, Vincas Krėvė-Mickevičius, reminded the audience of the Lithuanian national anthem, concluding his speech: &quot;Light and truth all along, guide our steps forever.&quot; At the end of the congress the orchestra began playing the Internationale. A teacher began to sing the Tautiška Giesmė. Other teachers joined in singing the anthem, and shortly all of the teachers that attended the congress sang along, thus publicly testifying about &quot;their determination to serve their homeland, but not the occupier&quot;. Inspired by them, the orchestra followed them standing.

==== 1944–1950 ====
The issue about the anthem was raised again after the re-occupation of the Baltic States, after Lithuania was forcibly re-incorporated into the USSR as the Lithuanian SSR. A new anthem of the USSR was made, and the lyrics of the anthem were translated to the languages of the USSR republics. The original plan was to use the translated anthem as the temporary anthem, until a new, more socialist anthem was made.

During the translation process, Antanas Venclova as the translator, expressed worries over the lyrics. The lyrics mentioned &quot;Великая Русь&quot; (), which he translated to &quot;Didžiosios Rusios&quot;. He feared that the part of the lyrics would be badly accepted in Lithuania, because the lyrics showed the superiority of the Russian nation in Lithuania, and the spirit of national revival that was suppressed after the occupation of Lithuania. The translation of the anthem itself was submitted on January 5, 1944 and was approved two days later.

On January 26, 1944, in the session of the Supreme Council of the USSR, the council adopted a resolution about the rights of all of the Soviet republics to hold their national military formations and Foreign Affairs Commissariat. The resolution was an attempt by the USSR to provide a semblance of independent statehood for the Soviet republics and create places for each of them in the UN. Even before the session, Justas Paleckis proposed to the USSR Commissioner for Foreign Affairs of the People&#x27;s Commissars, Vyacheslav Molotov, to consider whether the Soviet republics were allowed to have their own anthems. Molotov reported that the Politburo had decided to offer the Soviet republics to create their own anthems.

With the offer from the USSR government, the question of the Lithuanian anthem was re-discussed. The first proposal of the anthem was the song &quot;Mes su Stalinu&quot; (&#x27;We Are with Stalin&#x27;), which was proposed by G. Alexandrov to Kazys Preikšas. Other proposals proposed by G. Alexandrov was Tautiška giesmė, and other popular songs, including a poem by Petras Vaičiūnas &quot;Ei, pasauli, mes be Vilniaus nenurimsime&quot;.

On June 1, 1944 the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Lithuania prepared a draft resolution of the national anthem of Lithuania: 

&quot;At the present political situation, it is expedient to use the national anthem of Lithuania, in the Lithuanian SSR, to use its popularity and the opportunity to turn it into a weapon of strengthening the Soviet power to create a national anthem of the Lithuanian SSR...&quot;

The main points of the decree were:
# To allow the performance of music and text of the old Lithuanian national anthem, Tautiška giesmė, created in the end the 19th century by Vincas Kudirka as the National Anthem of the Lithuanian SSR
# To delay the question about the creation of the anthem of the Lithuanian until the time when it will be possible to attract all creative forces of the nation, and to create a hymn that reflects a new era in the life of the Lithuanian nation and the changes of the country&#x27;s economy, culture and people&#x27;s minds.

In the same draft resolution, it was envisaged that the lyrics and the melody of the Tautiška giesmė will be approved by the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Lithuanian SSR and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.

The question of the creation of a new anthem of the Lithuanian SSR returned a year later. In 1945, from September 28 to 29, the issue was held at the meeting of the Lithuanian Communist Party Central Committee Bureau. In the meeting, it was decided that a new anthem of the Lithuanian SSR was needed to reflect the socio-political change in Lithuania. A commission was organized to make the new national anthem of the Lithuanian SSR.

The committee consisted of K. Preikšas as the chairman, Justas Paleckis, Juozas Banaitis, Juozas Žiugžda, and the Honored Artists of the Lithuanian SSR, Professor Juozas Gruodis, Kostas Korsakas, and Vladas Niunka. The lyrics and the melody of the national anthem of the Lithuanian SSR should be submitted no later than on January 1, 1946. However, the anthem wasn&#x27;t submitted in the deadline. A new commission for the anthem was created, consisted of Antanas Venclova, Teofilis Tilvytis, Juozas Melnikas, Valerija Valsiūnienė, Eduardas Mieželaitis, Vacys Reimeris and Aleksys Churginas. Due to the active national partisan struggle in Lithuania, the plans of the new national anthem was relinquished. Apparently, the authorities believed that replacing Tautiška giesmė with a new one would further aggravate dissatisfaction of the population with the political system.

Of all the Soviet Baltic republics, only Lithuania managed to maintain the usage of their previous national anthem. The anthem was used until 1950. In occupied Latvia and Estonia, new anthems were created and approved in 1945. Due to the different opinions about the anthem of the Lithuanian SSR, Justas Paleckis proposed to change the words of the Tautiška giesmė. However, the proposed idea was rejected.

==== 1950 ====
After decline in Lithuanian partisan activity, the authorities concluded that it was safe to introduce the new anthem. On July 15, 1950, in the 10th anniversary of the incorporation of Lithuania to the Soviet Union, the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Lithuanian SSR approved a new anthem. The music for the anthem was composed by Balys Dvarionas and Jonas Švedas, and the words were written originally by Antanas Venclova. The anthem was confirmed in Article 169 of the 1978 Constitution of the Lithuanian SSR.

==== 1950–1988 ====
Even though Tautiška giesmė was used as the national anthem of the Lithuanian SSR for six years, the anthem ended up being banned in the Lithuanian SSR after the introduction and the approval of the new anthem. During this period, the &quot;Tautiška giesmė&quot; became a symbol of national resistance to the Soviet Union. The anthem was often sung at various festivities in families and in small gatherings of trusted people.

==== 1988–1990 ====
On October 6, 1988, &quot;Tautiška giesmė&quot; was approved as a replacement for the State Anthem of the Lithuanian SSR. The preliminary approval was made by the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR and successive legislative bodies.

=== Current status ===
The status of &quot;Tautiška giesmė&quot; as the national anthem of the Lithuanian Republic was reconfirmed in 1992. In that year, the Constitution of Lithuania was approved; Article 19 of the document states that Tautiška giesmė will be the national anthem of Lithuania. The last law in relation to the national anthem was passed in 1999; it contained the official lyrics and protocol on how and when to play the anthem.

=== 2015 Taoyuan incident ===
During the medal ceremony for Lithuanian team in 2015 World Deaf Basketball Championships in Taoyuan, Taiwan, where they won the final against the United States, the organizers of the tournament erroneously played the Soviet-era anthem instead of the actual anthem, upsetting the Lithuanians. The team, led by coach Algimantas Šatas, was forced to stand in dais during the entirety of the song. Later, the organizers recognized the mistake and apologized, stated that they had downloaded the wrong song in last minutes shortly before the ceremony.

==1999 law==
Signed into law by President Valdas Adamkus on June 9, 1999, the &quot;Law on the National Anthem of the Republic of Lithuania&quot; details when and where the national anthem is played and its performance protocols.

Article 2 of the law states that the anthem is to be played at the following occasions: At the beginning or ending of solemn sessions of the Seimas, on national holidays and memorial days, and at receptions and farewells of foreign heads of state on official visits to Lithuania—but only after the anthem of the foreign country has been played.

It is played in foreign countries to represent Lithuania, according to their own diplomatic protocols; on national holidays and other days when the flag is raised by order of the government; when the flag is raised during public events sponsored by governmental institutions, business, and organizations; and at the beginning and end of National Radio programming. The anthem may also be played at other occasions, such as sporting competitions.

When playing the anthem, the music may be either live or recorded. The anthem may be performed with a choir, an orchestra, a military band, or a combination of the latter two. Article 4, Section 2, states that all participants are encouraged to sing the national anthem. When the anthem is played, all civilians are asked to stand in a gesture of respect to the anthem. If employees of national defense, police, and other military or military-related organizations are present, they must respect the anthem in a way prescribed by their statutes. The anthem cannot be used as background music, purposes of advertisement, or for entertainment, such as karaoke. Public disrespect of the anthem may be punishable by law.

==Lyrics==

The Lithuanian National Culture Centre has created several sheet music for the anthem. Below are the sheet music for the anthem:
* Men&#x27;s Choir (tenor and bass)

<text>Decompression Illness (DCI) comprises two different conditions caused by rapid decompression of the body. These conditions present similar symptoms and require the same initial first aid. Scuba divers are trained to ascend slowly from depth to avoid DCI. Although the incidence is relatively rare, the consequences can be serious and potentially fatal, especially if untreated.

== Classification ==
DCI can be caused by two different mechanisms, which result in overlapping sets of symptoms. The two mechanisms are:
* Decompression sickness (DCS), which results from metabolically inert gas dissolved in body tissue under pressure emerging out of solution and forming bubbles during decompression. It typically afflicts underwater divers on poorly managed ascent from depth or aviators flying in inadequately pressurised aircraft.
* Arterial gas embolism (AGE), which is perfusion blockage caused by gas bubbles in the arterial bloodstream. In the context of DCI these may form either as a result of bubble nucleation and growth by dissolved gas into the blood on depressurisation, which is a subset of DCS above, and leakage from venous circulation to arterial circulation via patent foramen ovale or other shunt, or by gas entering the blood mechanically as a result of pulmonary barotrauma. Pulmonary barotrauma is a rupturing of lung tissue by expansion of breathing gas held in the lungs during depressurisation. This may typically be caused by an underwater diver ascending while holding the breath after breathing at ambient pressure, ambient pressure escape from a submerged submarine without adequate exhalation during the ascent, or the explosive decompression of an aircraft cabin or other pressurised environment. Other forms of lung overpressure injury such as pneumothorax require distinctly different treatment to AGE.

In any situation that could cause decompression sickness, there is also potentially a risk of arterial gas embolism, and as many of the symptoms are common to both conditions, it may be difficult to distinguish between the two in the field, and first aid treatment is the same for both mechanisms.

== Signs and symptoms ==

Approximately 90 percent of patients with DCS develop symptoms within three hours of surfacing; only a small percentage become symptomatic more than 24 hours after diving. 

Below is a summary comparison of the signs and symptoms of DCI arising from its two components: &quot;Decompression Sickness&quot; and &quot;Arterial Gas Embolism&quot;. Many signs and symptoms are common to both maladies, and it may be difficult to diagnose the actual problem. The dive history can be useful to distinguish which is more probable, but it is possible for both components to manifest at the same time following some dive profiles.

==Causes==
Decompression sickness is caused by the formation and growth of inert gas bubbles in the tissues when a diver decompresses faster than the gas can be safely disposed of through respiration and perfusion.

Arterial gas embolism is caused by gas in the lungs getting into the pulmonary venous circulation through injuries to the capillaries of the alveoli caused by lung overpressure injury. These bubbles are then circulated to the tissues via the systemic arterial circulation, and may cause blockages directly or indirectly by initiating clotting.

== Mechanism ==
The mechanism of decompression sickness is different from that of arterial gas embolism, but they share the causative factor of depressurization.

===Decompression sickness===
Depressurisation causes inert gases, which were dissolved under higher pressure, to come out of physical solution and form gas bubbles within the body. These bubbles produce the symptoms of decompression sickness. Bubbles may form whenever the body experiences a reduction in pressure, but not all bubbles result in DCS. The amount of gas dissolved in a liquid is described by Henry&#x27;s Law, which indicates that when the pressure of a gas in contact with a liquid is decreased, the amount of that gas dissolved in the liquid will also decrease proportionately.

On ascent from a dive, inert gas comes out of solution in a process called &quot;outgassing&quot; or &quot;offgassing&quot;. Under normal conditions, most offgassing occurs by gas exchange in the lungs. If inert gas comes out of solution too quickly to allow outgassing in the lungs then bubbles may form in the blood or within the solid tissues of the body. The formation of bubbles in the skin or joints results in milder symptoms, while large numbers of bubbles in the venous blood can cause lung damage. The most severe types of DCS interrupt — and ultimately damage — spinal cord function, leading to paralysis, sensory dysfunction, or death. In the presence of a right-to-left shunt of the heart, such as a patent foramen ovale, venous bubbles may enter the arterial system, resulting in an arterial gas embolism. A similar effect, known as ebullism, may occur during explosive decompression, when water vapour forms bubbles in body fluids due to a dramatic reduction in environmental pressure.

===Arterial gas embolism===

When a diver holds their breath during an ascent the reduction in pressure will cause the gas to expand and the lungs will also have to expand to continue to contain the gas. If the expansion exceeds the normal capacity of the lungs, they will continue to expand elastically until the tissues reach their tensile strength limit, after which any increase in pressure difference between the gas in the lungs and the ambient pressure will cause the weaker tissues to rupture, releasing gas from the lungs into any permeable space exposed by the damaged tissue. This could be the pleural space between the lung and the chest walls, between the pleural membranes, and this condition is known as pneumothorax. The gas could also enter the interstitial spaces within the lungs, the neck and larynx, and the mediastinal space around the heart, causing interstititial or mediastinal emphysema, or it could enter the blood vessels of the venous pulmonary circulation via damaged alveolar capillaries, and from there reach the left side of the heart, from which they will be discharged into the systemic circulation. On the way out through the aorta the gas may be entrained in blood flowing into the carotid or basilar arteries. If these bubbles cause blockage in blood vessels, this is arterial gas embolism. Vascular obstruction and inflammation caused by gas bubbles causes end organ damage to most tissues. Sufficient pressure difference and expansion to cause this injury can occur from depths as shallow as .

== Diagnosis ==

Definitive diagnosis is difficult, as most of the signs and symptoms are common to several conditions and there are no specific tests for DCI. The dive history is important, if reliable, and the sequence and presentation of symptoms can differentiate between possibilities. Most doctors do not have the training and experience to reliably diagnose DCI, so it is preferable to consult a diving medicine specialist, as misdiagnosis can have inconvenient, expensive and possibly life-threatening consequences. Prior to 2000, there was a tendency to under-diagnose DCI, and as a result a number of cases did not get the treatment that could have produced a better result, while since 2000, there has been a swing to over-diagnosis, with consequent expensive and inconvenient treatments, and expensive inconvenient and risky evacuations that were not necessary. The presence of symptoms of pneumothorax, mediastinal or interstitial emphysema would support a diagnosis of arterial gas embolism if symptoms of that condition are also present, but AGE can occur without symptoms of other lung overpressure injuries. Most cases of arterial gas embolism will present symptoms soon after surfacing, but this also happens with cerebral decompression sickness.

Numbness and tingling are associated with spinal DCS, but can also be caused by pressure on nerves (compression neurapraxia). In DCS the numbness or tingling is generally confined to one or a series of dermatomes, while pressure on a nerve tends to produce characteristic areas of numbness associated with the specific nerve on only one side of the body distal to the pressure point. A loss of strength or function is likely to be a medical emergency. A loss of feeling that lasts more than a minute or two indicates a need for immediate medical attention. It is only partial sensory changes, or paraesthesias, where this distinction between trivial and more serious injuries applies.

Large areas of numbness with associated weakness or paralysis, especially if a whole limb is affected, are indicative of probable brain involvement and require urgent medical attention. Paraesthesias or weakness involving a dermatome indicate probable spinal cord or spinal nerve root involvement. Although it is possible that this may have other causes, such as an injured intervertebral disk, these symptoms indicate an urgent need for medical assessment. In combination with weakness, paralysis or loss of bowel or bladder control, they indicate a medical emergency.

==Prevention==
Almost all arterial gas embolism is avoidable by not diving with lung conditions which increase the risk and not holding the breath during ascent. These conditions will usually be detected in the diving medical examination required for professional divers. Recreational divers are not all screened at this level. Complete emptying of the lungs is not recommended in emergency swimming ascents as this is thought to increase the risk by collapsing small air passages and trapping air in parts of the lung. Rate of ascent is not usually an issue for AGE.

Decompression sickness is usually avoidable by following the requirements of decompression tables or algorithms regarding ascent rates and stop times for the specific dive profile, but these do not guarantee safety, and in some cases, unpredictably, there will be decompression sickness. Decompressing for longer can reduce the risk by an unknown amount. Decompression is a calculated risk where some of the variables are not well defined, and it is not possible to define the point at which all residual risk disappears. Risk is also reduced by reducing exposure to ingassing and taking into account the various known and suspected risk factors. Most, but not all, cases are easily avoided.

== Treatment ==

Treatment for the &quot;Decompression Sickness&quot; and the &quot;Arterial Gas Embolism&quot; components of DCI may differ significantly, but that depends mostly on the symptoms, as both conditions are generally treated based on the symptoms. Refer to the separate treatments under those articles.

Urgency of treatment depends on the symptoms. Mild symptoms will usually resolve without treatment, though appropriate treatment may accelerate recovery considerably. Failure to treat severe cases can have fatal or long term effects. Some types of injuries are more likely to have long lasting effects depending on the organs involved.

=== First aid ===
First aid is common for both DCS and AGE:
* Monitor the patient for responsiveness, airway, breathing and circulation, resuscitate if necessary.
* Treat for shock.
* Lay the patient on their back, or for drowsy, unconscious, or nauseated victims, on their side.
* Administer 100% oxygen as soon as possible.
* Seek immediate medical assistance, locate a hospital with hyperbaric facilities and plan for possible transport.
* Allow the patient to drink water or isotonic fluids only if responsive, stable, and not suffering from nausea or stomach pain. Administration of intravenous saline solution is preferable.
* Record details of recent dives and responses to first aid treatment and provide to the treating medical specialist. The diving details should include depth and time profiles, breathing gases used and surface intervals.

== Prognosis ==

The prognosis of the DCS is generally favorable for patients with mild symptoms, given timely and appropriate treatment, and in excellent health before the dive. Symptoms may resolve within days after prompt administration of high-flow oxygen and rest. 

The outcome for cerebral arterial gas embolism largely depends on severity and the delay before recompression. Most cases which are recompressed within two hours do well. Recompression within six hours often produces improvement and sometimes full resolution. Delays to recompression of more than 6 to 8 hours are not often very effective, and are generally associated with delays in diagnosis and delays in transfer to a hyperbaric chamber.

Xu et al. reported a 99.3% effectiveness rate of treating decompression illness with immediate recompression in a study of 5,278 cases across 2000-2010 in China. The initial symptom occurred within 6 hours after surfacing in 98.9% of cases.

Long term complications can arise as end organ damage from air embolisms. In bones, dysbaric osteonecrosis leads to pathological fractures and chronic arthritis, particularly in the proximal femur, humerus, and tibia. In the brain and spinal cord, depending on the area and severity of damage there can be neurological deficits ranging from becoming comatose, having sensorimotor weakness, incontinence, and other effects. The lungs can develop pulmonary fibrosis. The pancreas, kidneys, and liver are also vulnerable, and reginal necrosis in the gastrointestinal tract can cause strictures leading to obstruction.
== Epidemiology ==
Roughly 3 to 7 cases per 10,000 dives are diagnosed, of which about 1 in 100,000 dives are fatal.

<text>Datong is a prefecture-level city in northern Shanxi Province in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It is located in the Datong Basin at an elevation of and borders Inner Mongolia to the north and west and Hebei to the east. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 3,105,591 of whom 1,790,452 lived in the built-up (or metro) area made of the 2 out 4 urban districts of Pingcheng and Yungang as Yunzhou and Xinrong are not conurbated yet.

==History==
The area of present-day Datong was close to the state of Dai, which was conquered by the Zhao clan of Jin in 457 BC. It was a frontier land between the agricultural Chinese and the nomads of the Great Steppe. The area was well known for its trade in horses.

The area of present-day Datong eventually came under the control of the Qin dynasty, during which it was known as Pingcheng County (平城县) and formed part of the Qin commandery of Yanmen. Pingcheng County continued under the Han dynasty, which founded a site within present-day Datong in 200BC following its victory against the Xiongnu nomads at the Battle of Baideng. Located near a pass to Inner Mongolia along the Great Wall, Pingcheng blossomed under Han rule and became a stop-off point for camel caravans moving from China into Mongolia and beyond. It was sacked at the end of the Eastern Han. Pingcheng became the capital of the Xianbei-founded Northern Wei dynasty from AD398–494. The Yungang Grottoes were constructed during the later part of this period (460–494). During the mid to late 520s, Pingcheng was the seat of Northern Wei&#x27;s Dai Commandery. During the Tang dynasty, Datong became the seat of the Tang prefecture of Yunzhou, and the original Guandi temple was built.

The city was renamed Datong in 1048. It was the Xijing (&quot;Western Capital&quot;) of the Jurchen Jin dynasty prior to being sacked by the Mongols. Datong later came under the control of the Ming dynasty, serving as an important Ming military stronghold against the Mongols to the north. During the Ming period, many of Datong&#x27;s notable historical structures such as the Drum Tower and the Nine-Dragon Wall were built. Datong was sacked again at the end of the Ming in 1649, but promptly rebuilt in 1652.

By 1982 a portion of its city walls remained so it became one of the National Famous Historical and Cultural Cities that year. Prior to 2008, about 100,000 people lived in the old city. In 2008 mayor Geng Yanbo decided to redevelop much of the inner city, with over being redeveloped, and with Geng becoming known as the &quot;Demolition Mayor&quot;. Geng and his group anticipated that 30,000 to 50,000 people would remain in the old city.

In 2013 Geng left his position. Su Jiede of &quot;Sixth Tone&quot; wrote that much of the city was still under construction at the time and that Geng&#x27;s efforts resulted in &quot;a half-finished city center and a complicated legacy&quot; and that &quot;To critics, the city had spent enormous sums of money without much to show for it.&quot; By 2020 the population of the old city was below 30,000 and there were fewer governmental facilities available for the residents. That year Su stated that the old city &quot;still presents a headache for the local government.&quot;

==Demographics==
Su Jiede wrote that since Pingcheng District, which had most of its urbanized area, had 1,105,699 people as of 2020, &quot;Datong is a small city by Chinese standards&quot;.

==Geography==
Datong is the northernmost city of Shanxi, and is located in the Datong Basin, with an administrative area spanning latitude 39° 03&#x27;–40° 44&#x27; N and longitude 112° 34&#x27;–114° 33&#x27; E. The urban area is surrounded on three sides by mountains, with passes only to the east and southwest. Within the prefecture-level city elevations generally increase from southeast to northwest. Datong borders Ulanqab (Inner Mongolia) to the northwest and Zhangjiakou (Hebei) to the east, Shuozhou (Shanxi) to the southwest, and Xinzhou (Shanxi) to the south.

The well-known Datong Volcanic Arc lies nearby in the Datong Basin.

It is west of Beijing.

===Climate===
Datong has a continental, monsoon-influenced steppe climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;), influenced by the + elevation, with rather long, cold, very dry winters, and very warm summers. Monthly mean temperatures range from in January to in July; the annual mean temperature is . Due to the aridity and elevation, diurnal temperature variation is often large, averaging annually. There barely is any precipitation during winter, and more than of the annual precipitation occurs from June to September. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 54% in July to 66% in October, sunshine is abundant year-round, and the city receives 2,671 hours (about 60% of the possible total) of bright sunshine per year. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from on 16 December 2023 to on 29 July 2010.

==Administrative divisions==

*Defunct – Kuang District () is largely made up of separate mines throughout the metropolitan area.

==Tourism==
The Yungang Grottoes are a collection of shallow caves located west of Datong. There are over 50,000 carved images and statues of Buddhas and bodhisattvas within these grottoes, ranging from 4 centimeters to 7 meters tall. Most of these icons are around 1500 years old.

Within the city itself, there are a few surviving sites of historical interest such as the Nine-Dragon Wall, the Huayan Monastery, and the Shanhua Temple. Further afield is the Hanging Temple built into a cliff face near Mount Heng. Most of the historical sites in this region date to the Liao, Jin and Ming dynasties, but the Hanging Temple dates to the Northern Wei dynasty (386–534).

The railway locomotive works (see below) began to attract increasing numbers of railway enthusiasts from the 1970s. When the construction of steam locomotives was phased out, the authorities did not want to lose this valuable tourism market, and pondered the possibility of developing a steam railway operating center as an attraction. A number of study visits were undertaken to the East Lancashire Railway at Bury, and a twinning arrangement was concluded with that town.

In 2010, work began on reconstructing the city&#x27;s 14th century Ming dynasty defensive wall. The controversial reconstruction project was in its final phase at the end of 2014. The documentary &quot;The Chinese Mayor&quot; documents two years of vigorous and highly controversial (due to summary demolition of about 200,000 homes) effort by Mayor Geng Yanbo to push the reconstruction project forward.
==Culture==
Datong is known for its knife-cut noodles.

==Economy==
The GDP per capita was ¥17,852 (US$2,570) per annum in 2008, ranked no. 242 among 659 Chinese cities. Coal mining is the dominant industry of Datong. Its history and development are very much linked to this commodity.

Development zones
Datong Economic and Technological Development Zone

Due to its strategic position, it is also an important distribution and warehousing center for Shanxi, Hebei and Inner Mongolia.

Datong is an old fashioned coal mining city, and still sits on significant reserves of this commodity. Consequently, it has developed a reputation as one of China&#x27;s most polluted cities. The Datong Coal Mining Group is based here and is China&#x27;s third largest such enterprise. Datong is indeed however an emerging economy, as the city seeks to loosen its dependence on coal, introduce more environmentally friendly and efficient methods of extraction and move into other areas of business services. The local government has continued to upgrade its pillar coal sector (and related industries like coal chemicals, power and metallurgy), while also developing &quot;substitute industries&quot; such as machinery manufacturing, tourism and distribution, warehousing and logistics services. This has had some impact. Datong&#x27;s GDP grew by 5.1 percent in 2008 to RMB56.6 billion.

While coal will continue to dominate, Datong has been identified as one of the key cities requiring redevelopment, with part of this being in environmental cleanup, rehabilitation and industrial refocusing. Datong is a pilot city for rehabilitation studies following years of pollution. To this end it has already struck up strong relationships with other cities worldwide with similar backgrounds, and has begun plans, for example, to develop a tourism base focused on steam engine technology with antique locomotives to be used along designated tracks.

Datong has a large railway locomotive works &#x27;Datong locomotive factory&#x27;, where the &#x27;Aiming Higher&#x27; () class of steam locomotive was built as late as the 1970s. Steam locomotive production ended in the late 1980s and the plant&#x27;s main products (as of 2010) is mainline electric locomotives.

<text>Caloocan, officially the City of Caloocan (; ), is a highly urbanized city in Metro Manila, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 1,661,584 people making it the fourth-most populous city in the Philippines.

Caloocan is divided into two geographical locations with a total combined area of , a result of the 1949 expansion of Quezon City, which absorbed much of its territory. It was formerly part of the Province of Rizal in southern Luzon. It comprises what is known as the CAMANAVA area along with the cities of Malabon, Navotas and Valenzuela.

South Caloocan is bordered by Manila, Quezon City, Malabon, Navotas and Valenzuela. The presence of commercial and industrial activities combined with residential areas make it a highly urbanized central business district and a major urban center in the Northern District of Metropolitan Manila. North Caloocan shares its border with Quezon City and Valenzuela, Marilao, Meycauayan and San Jose del Monte in the province of Bulacan, and Rodriguez in the province of Rizal. It is composed of mostly residential subdivisions and extensive resettlement areas with scattered distribution of industrial estates mostly within road transit points and intersections.

== Etymology ==
Caloocan as a toponym comes from the Tagalog words &quot;lo-ok&quot; that translates to &quot;bay&quot;, &quot;sulok&quot; that means &quot;corner&quot; suggested by its location between the ends of the present-day Malabon and Tondo, Manila, and &quot;kalook-lookan&quot; (or &quot;kaloob-looban&quot;) meaning &quot;innermost area&quot;. The city&#x27;s name is colloquially spelled Kalookan. Historically, it was called Kaloogan, meaning &quot;interior territory,&quot; which evolved from the old Tagalog word &quot;loog&quot; (synonymous with &quot;loob,&quot; meaning &quot;inside&quot;). The &quot;g&quot; sound could have shifted to the &quot;k&quot; sound in Tagalog phonetics (e.g. baksak → bagsak), leading to the present name of the city. 

There is a mixed preference over the preferred spelling of the city&#x27;s name. Variation, and the apparent confusion over the spelling, came about during the early 1970s, when a resolution was adopted by the municipal board, requiring the city departments to use the name &quot;Kalookan.&quot; However, execution of the resolution was interrupted due to martial law imposed nationwide in September 1972. In 1988, Councilor Aurora Asistio-Henson proposed Resolution No. 006, aiming to promote Filipino nationalism by enforcing the spelling &quot;Kalookan&quot; in all city departments and establishments. Despite this, the change was met with opposition from residents, business owners, and officials. Former representative and mayor Virgilio Robles deemed the move illegal, asserting that the city&#x27;s name is spelled as &quot;Caloocan&quot; according to the city charter. Although confusion persists, the general inclination in the city is towards &quot;Caloocan,&quot; as evidenced by the official logo and favored by many barangays, schools, and newspapers. However, some entities, like the Directories of the Philippines Corporation, prefer the spelling &quot;Kalookan.&quot;

==History==
===Spanish colonial era===
Originally, Caloocan was the area where the old town of Tondo and Tambobong met, located along the shores of Dagat-Dagatan, a crescent-shaped inland lagoon to the west. The settlement along the shore was called &quot;Aromahan&quot;, or &quot;Espina&quot; to the Spaniards, and was separated from Manila Bay by a narrow ridge from Tondo towards an opening in Kinabutasan leading to the sea.

By the late 1700s, the fishermen of Aromahan have expanded towards a hill east of Dagat-Dagatan. This naturally stony hill was called &quot;Kaloogan&quot;, meaning &quot;interior territory.&quot; With Aromahan relegated to the periphery, this hilltop area was also settled by oppressed people from Tondo, becoming the new center of the community by 1802. To the east was a vast stretch of cogon-covered land. Eventually called &quot;Kalaanan&quot;, meaning flat grassland in old Tagalog, this area is now generally known as Grace Park.

Caloocan became a municipality when it was separated from Tondo in 1815. Its original territory extended to the foothills of Marikina, San Mateo and Montalban to the east; Tinajeros, Tanza, and Tala rivers to the north; San Juan del Monte, San Francisco del Monte, Sampalok, Santa Cruz and Tondo in the south; and Dagat-dagatan and Aromahan to the west. The local government building was set up on the relatively well-settled portion just above Libis Espina. The old Aromahan chapel was finally abandoned and a new church was built facing the municipal hall. To escape the Spanish authorities, many from the area abandoned the town proper and sought refuge in the grasslands of Balintawak and Pugad-Lawin, in which the people fought the landlords of Hacienda de Maysilo for terrestrial rights, which went on for almost a hundred years.

In 1891 what is now the Philippine National Railways opened a station in the town, which today also hosts its major repair and maintenance depots alongside other stations opened in later years, 3 years before, the steam tranvia preceded that linking the town to the capital and the then coastal towns of Malabon and Navotas. 

====The Philippine revolution====

Caloocan is historically significant because it was the center of activities for the Katipunan, the secret militant society that launched the Philippine Revolution during the Spanish occupation of the Philippines. In a house in Caloocan, secret meetings were held by Andrés Bonifacio and his men, and it was in the city&#x27;s perimeters where the first armed encounter took place between the Katipunan and the Spaniards. The revolution erupted after the &quot;Cry of Balintawak&quot; led by Andres Bonifacio against their oppressors on August 30, 1896.

===American invasion era===
In 1899, the people of Caloocan showed resistance to coming to terms with the Americans, who were bent on extending their supremacy over the country. The men of Caloocan fought the new invaders on February 23, 1899, however victory eluded the local troops on the pretext of Antonio Luna&#x27;s rift with Emilio Aguinaldo&#x27;s loyalists. The city then saw heavy fighting in the Philippine–American War, at the Battle of Caloocan and the Second Battle of Caloocan.

In 1901, under the American regime, Caloocan, previously a part of the province of Manila, became one of the municipalities of the newly established province of Rizal. Due to the consolidation of several municipalities in 1903, Novaliches, then an independent municipality, became part of Caloocan pursuant to Act No. 942, as amended by Act Nos. 984 and 1008 of the Philippine Commission.

===Japanese occupation era===
In 1942, Caloocan was one of the municipalities of Rizal merged alongside Manila and Quezon City to form the City of Greater Manila as an emergency measure by President Manuel L. Quezon. It regained its pre-war status as a municipality of Rizal when the City of Greater Manila was dissolved effective August 1, 1945.

===Cityhood===
In 1961, after Republic Act No. 3278 was approved by the Philippine Congress, a plebiscite was conducted. Caloocan was officially inducted into cityhood on February 16, 1962.

Caloocan remained a city of the province of Rizal until November 7, 1975, when it became a part of the National Capital Region or Metro Manila, by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 824.

===Territorial changes===

Caloocan once encompassed a much larger, contiguous area. The districts of Balintawak, La Loma and Novaliches were once part of Caloocan. Balintawak is a historic district because it was the original site of the &quot;Cry of Pugad Lawin&quot; (Unang Sigaw sa Balintawak) at a location called &quot;Kang-kong&quot; near Tandang Sora&#x27;s house. Novaliches was an expansive sector with some hillsides that served as meeting places and hideouts for Andrés Bonifacio and the &quot;Katipunan&quot;.

During the American occupation, there was a consolidation of several municipalities. Caloocan annexed the neighboring town of Novaliches on October 12, 1903, as stated in the Act No. 942 of the Philippine Commission, bringing its total area to about . When Commonwealth Act No. 502 created Quezon City in 1939, Caloocan ceded 1,500 hectares of land from the barrios or sitios of Bagubantay (Bago Bantay), Balintauac (Balintawák), Balingasa, Kaingin, Kangkong (present-day Apolonio Samson), La Loma, Malamig, Matalahib (present-day Santo Domingo), Masambong, Galas, San Isidro, San José, Santol and Tatalon. Instead of opposing the transfer, Caloocan residents willingly gave the land in the belief it will benefit the country&#x27;s new capital city.

However, in 1949, Congress passed Republic Act No. 392, which redefined the Caloocan–Quezon City boundary. The barrios of Baesa, Sangandaan, Talipapâ, San Bartolomé, Pasong Tamó, Novaliches Proper (poblacion), Banlat (present-day Tandang Sora), Kabuyao, Pugad Lawin, Bagbag, Pasong Putik, which once belonged to Novaliches and had an area of about , were excised from Caloocan. The remaining portion of the Novaliches is now called North Caloocan. This split Caloocan into two parts: a more urbanized southern section and a suburban-rural northern section, which is part of Novaliches.

In 1957, the sitio of Bagbaguin was separated from the barrio of Caybiga (Kaybiga) and converted into a distinct barrio known as Barrio Bagbaguin.

===Reorganization attempts===
Issues concerning budget and handling village governments led to attempts to restructure the city&#x27;s &quot;barangays&quot; since late 1980s. A bill authored by city&#x27;s 1st district representative Virgilio Robles, which aimed to reduce the barangays from 188 to 60—thirty in each legislative district—was approved as Republic Act (RA) No. 6714 on February 28, 1989. A plebiscite was held on March 10; with a turnout of only 10% of 384,981 registered voters, majority of the participated voters reportedly opposed the proposal.

On the other hand, residents of Bagong Silang (Barangay 176), then the country&#x27;s most populous barangay and was used to be a relocation site for informal settlers, appealed the partition of the barangay since 2013. On April 3, 2024, President Bongbong Marcos signed RA No. 11993 which would divide the village into six. This was ratified by the majority of voters in a plebiscite held on August 31.

===Philippine drug war===
Throughout Oscar Malapitan&#x27;s mayorship from 2013 to 2022, he regularly boasted of a decreased crime rate in Caloocan. However, the Peace Research Institute Frankfurt (PRIF) noted in 2020 that Malapitan&#x27;s mayorship was characterized with a passivity towards President Rodrigo Duterte&#x27;s war on drugs during its first year (2016–2017), with Malapitan asking the local branch of the Philippine National Police (PNP) to take charge of crime control and work vigorously against illegal drugs, which PRIF claimed to have &quot;resulted in a huge spike of deadly police violence&quot; and &quot;excessive levels of vigilantism&quot; during this period. Many of the high-profile incidents in Duterte&#x27;s national drug war occurred in Caloocan, including the murders of Luis Bonifacio and his son Gabriel in 2016 and the murders of Kian delos Santos, Carl Arnaiz and Reynaldo de Guzman in 2017.

Bishop Pablo Virgilio David of the Diocese of Kalookan met with Malapitan, lawyer Sikini Labastilla, and the city police chief, all three of whom were members of the Caloocan City Anti-Drug Abuse Council (CADAC), sometime in 2017 to discuss how to better facilitate rehabilitation and drug prevention in the city during the drug war, which lead to the establishment of the Caloocan Anti-Drug Abuse Office (CADAO) in early September through an ordinance written by councilor Rose Mercado. Caloocan also passed Ordinance No. 702, sponsored by councilors Mercado, Onet Henson and Alou Nubla, in early September that implemented a new curfew for minors (from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.) and placed the liability on their parents in response to the police murders of delos Santos, Arnaiz and de Guzman. By mid-September, Caloocan&#x27;s entire police force was relieved from duty by PNP Chief Oscar Albayalde, despite it receiving the award for Metro Manila&#x27;s Best City Police Station from the National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) a month earlier; only newly assigned police chief Jemar Modequillo and his administration deputy were retained. Although Modequillo attempted to instill discipline in the city&#x27;s police force and reduce the number of deaths in police operations in the months after his assignment, he was characterized by his support for Duterte&#x27;s drug war and observance of his mandate.

In March 2018, a spate of drive-by shootings perpetrated by pairs of motorcyclists, locally known as &quot;riding-in-tandem&quot;, occurred in the city. By next month, councilors Mercado, Nubla and PJ Malonzo proposed an ordinance that would ban motorcycle-riding male tandems, but upon the protest of motorcycle clubs, however, mayor Malapitan stated that changes will first be made to the proposed ordinance before he signs it into law.

==Geography==
Caloocan is divided into two non-contiguous areas with a total combined area of . South Caloocan, with an area of , is bordered on the south by Manila, on the east by Quezon City, on the west by Navotas, on the north-northwest by Malabon, and on the north by Valenzuela. North Caloocan, with an area of , shares its border on the south-southeast by Quezon City, on the southwest by Valenzuela, on the north by Marilao, Meycauayan and San Jose del Monte in the province of Bulacan, and on the northeast by Rodriguez in the province of Rizal.

===Topography===

South Caloocan, where most commercial and industrial establishments are found, lies on generally flat and highly accessible land, with slopes ranging from 0–3%. The topography gradually changes from gently to moderately sloping to rolling along the North Luzon Expressway, with slopes ranging from 3–18%. The highest point at above sea level can be found in this area, while the lowest point is in the southern part of Dagat-Dagatan at about above mean sea level.

North Caloocan is characterized by gently to steeply undulating to rolling topography with slopes ranging from 3–18%, mostly seen in the northern and central portion, gradually transforming into a southward trend of flat lands down to the southwestern tip of the boundary. Being accessible to major roads, many industrial and residential subdivisions have been developed on this near-level land.

===Geology===
The geologic formation of the two portions of Caloocan varies in type and characteristics. and are specifically classified as quaternary alluvium, tuff and tuffaceous sediment, pyroclastic flow deposit, and conglomerates. The formation on the eastern half of Metropolitan Manila extending to the coastline of Manila Bay and including a greater part of South Caloocan is the quaternary alluvium, which consists of unconsolidated stream-deposited sediments that include sand, silt, clay and gravel.

Eastward of South Caloocan, large areas consisting of tuff and tuffaceous sediment can be traced, spreading towards the whole eastern side of Metro Manila. Pyroclastic flow deposit or igneous rocks formed by the lithification of ash flow are likewise present in some northern fringes of South Caloocan and in most parts of North Caloocan. On the northeast borders of North Caloocan, conglomerate rocks were traced, crossing Tala Estate and extending to the province of Bulacan and the La Mesa Watershed.

Soil found in both areas of Caloocan predominantly falls under the Novaliches Series, covering 96% of the total land area of the city. The Novaliches Series is composed of reddish brown soil, friable in consistency and granular in structure. Spherical concretions are present in the subsoil and underneath is tuffaceous material of varying degrees of disintegration and weathering. This tuffaceous material is exposed by extensive erosion in some places.

===Surface drainages===
Caloocan has surface waters that either have natural courses (creeks and rivers) or were constructed to serve as drainages to remove excess water from soil surfaces. South Caloocan has about open drainage canals that serve mainly the reclamation area comprising Kaunlaran Village (Dagat-Dagatan Development Project) and nearly natural surface water coursing through the different natural river systems. These include the Tinajeros-Tullahan River along the Caloocan–Valenzuela boundary; Maligaya Creek within La Loma Cemetery and crossing Rizal Avenue Extension; Casili Creek which terminates in Estero de Maypajo, and Cantarilla/Panaca Creek along the Caloocan–Malabon boundary. In North Caloocan, all surface waters consist of natural streams, the longest being the Meycauayan-Marilao River dividing Caloocan and Bulacan. Others include the Bagong Silang River, Tala, Camarin, Pasong Malapad, and Bagumbong Creeks crossing multiple subdivisions, for long within the city&#x27;s territorial boundaries.

===Climate===
===Barangays===
Currently, Caloocan has 193 barangays divided into 3 legislative districts. The 1st District is composed of 64 barangays, which include Barangays 1 to 4, 77 to 85, 132 to 164 in South Caloocan and Barangays 165 to 177 in North Caloocan. The 2nd District is composed of 118 barangays, which include Barangays 5 to 76 and 86 to 131, all in South Caloocan. 3rd District, which was created in 2021, includes 11 barangays in North Caloocan that were formerly part of the 1st District, which include Barangays 178 to 188.

The city uses a hybrid system for its barangays, further dividing the cities into 16 zones. Among the cities in Metro Manila, only Manila, Pasay and Caloocan implement the so-called &quot;Zone Systems&quot;. A zone is a group of barangays in a district. Although a zone is considered a subdivision in the local government units, the people do not elect a leader for the zone in a popular election similar to the normal barangay or local elections as the system is merely for statistical purposes. Furthermore, all barangays have corresponding numbers but only a few—mostly in Caloocan&#x27;s northern part—have corresponding names. However, the names of barrios and districts do not necessarily coincide with the perimeters of barangays. The barangays in southern Caloocan are generally smaller compared to their northern counterparts.

Prior to its split in 2024, Barangay 176 or Bagong Silang was the most populous barangay in the country with a population of 261,729 people or 15.75% of the total population of Caloocan. This was due to the continuous influx of informal settler families through relocation programs since the 1970s. As a result, there have been calls by residents to subdivide Bagong Silang into seven distinct barangays. Finally, a plebiscite held on August 31, 2024, resulted in the division of Bagong Silang into six distinct barangays: 176-A, 176-B, 176-C, 176-D, 176-E, and 176-F.

Barangay 76, meanwhile, is the least populous barangay in Metro Manila with a population of 2. It used to be an informal settlement and its entire area is now predominated by retail buildings.

===Territorial disputes===
Caloocan has two unresolved boundary disputes. Its dispute with San Jose del Monte, Bulacan, docketed as G.R. No. 142601 dated October 23, 2006, particularly encompasses portions of Pangarap Village and apparently Bankers Village 2 that are once part of Tala Estate. The lack of jurisdiction of the Commission on Settlement of Land Problems (COSLAP) resulted to the nullification of its decision. On the other hand, its dispute with Quezon City revolves around the latter&#x27;s Barangay Baesa. 

Moreover, the city governments of Caloocan and Malabon signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) in 2014 to develop of disputed land located within Caloocan&#x27;s Libis Baesa area and Malabon&#x27;s Barangay Potrero. The MOU preempted any court decisions on the dispute that began in 2001, when Malabon, upon its conversion to a highly urbanized city, took control over lands formerly under Caloocan&#x27;s jurisdiction.

==Demographics==
As of 2020, the city has a population of 1,661,584 people, which makes it the fourth largest city in the Philippines in terms of population. Under the same census year, Caloocan South (Barangays 1 to 164) was recorded as having a population of 585,091, and Caloocan North (Barangays 165 to 188) was recorded with a population of 998,887. If the two districts were treated as separate cities, they still would have been among the largest in the country as of the 2015 census year, ranking fourth and 17th respectively in terms of population.

The population density of Caloocan () surpasses that of the National Capital Region as a whole.

The 1st district of Caloocan was once the country&#x27;s most populous legislative district, with 1.19 million persons as of 2015, prior to the creation of the 3rd district that was excised from it.

Most residents speak Filipino (Tagalog) and English, with considerable numbers speaking other languages and dialects of the Philippines.

Like many other places in the country, Caloocan is predominantly Roman Catholic. It is home to the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kalookan in its southern part, while its northern part is under the Roman Catholic Diocese of Novaliches. There is also a significant presence of Iglesia ni Cristo and other Protestant churches in the city.

==Economy==
According to the Department of Trade and Industry&#x27;s Cities &amp; Municipalities Competitive Index, Caloocan has an economic dynamism of 20% as of 2024, ranking 15th among local government units (LGUs) in the Philippines.

Caloocan&#x27;s 10th Avenue area is well known for its clusters of motorcycle dealers and motorcycle spare parts dealers. Among the major and famous streets are P. Zamora Street and A. Mabini Street.

Numerous banks have branches in the city such as BDO, EastWest Bank, MetroBank, PSBank, Maybank, Chinabank, Bank of the Philippine Islands, UnionBank, PNB, Philippine Business Bank, Bank of Makati, Security Bank, Land Bank of the Philippines, Sterling Bank of Asia, Bank of Commerce, Philtrust Bank, Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation, Malayan Bank, Bank One Savings &amp; Trust Corporation, WealthBank, Rural Bank of Caloocan, and Our Lady of Grace Credit Cooperative.
The city also has a number of shopping malls and stand-alone supermarkets and hypermarkets. In the southern part are SM City Grand Central (on the former site of Ever Gotesco Grand Central), Puregold Monumento, Puregold Maypajo, Victory Central Mall, Araneta Square, Uniwide Warehouse Club Monumento, LRT Caloocan Mall, SM Hypermarket Monumento, SM Center Sangandaan, 999 Shopping Mall Caloocan, and Walter Mart Caloocan. On the other hand, in the northern part are Zabarte Town Center, Holiday Island Mall, Metroplaza Mall, Primark Town Center Deparo, Primark Town Center Brixton, and SM City Caloocan. Savemore Market has three branches which are located in Kiko Camarin (Barangay 178), Zabarte inside Zabarte Town Center, Kaybiga and Primark Deparo. Puregold Price Club has seven branches in the north and five in the south.

Factories and industrial areas have also been built in various parts of Caloocan. Manufacturers are concentrated in the northern part, particularly in Bagumbong, Kaybiga, Llano, and Tala, while plastic and steel industries are concentrated in the southern part. Tala hosts the Victoria Wave Special Economic Zone, a registered zone under the Philippine Economic Zone Authority.

NLEX Corporation, the concession holder of the North Luzon Expressway, is headquartered in Caloocan. The expressway&#x27;s main section, NLEX Harbor Link, and NLEX Connector traverse through South Caloocan. Planned expressways such as the North Luzon East Expressway and North Access Link Expressway are slated to traverse Caloocan.

==Government==
===Local government===
Caloocan, like other cities of the Philippines, is a local government unit whose powers and functions are specified by the Local Government Code of the Philippines. In general, as a city, Caloocan is headed by a mayor who heads the city&#x27;s executive function and the vice mayor who heads the city&#x27;s legislative function, which is composed of eighteen councilors, six from each of the city&#x27;s three city council districts. For representation, the city has three districts, and therefore three representatives, in the country&#x27;s House of Representatives.

The current Caloocan City Hall, situated in Grace Park East, serves as the city&#x27;s seat of government. Located in a rectangular lot between 8th and 9th Streets and 8th and 9th Avenues, it replaced the old city hall built in 1952 on A. Mabini Street, across from San Roque Cathedral-Parish, now occupied by 999 Shopping Mall Caloocan. The Caloocan City Hall North, situated in Camarin along Zapote Street, serves the northern part of the city. It is currently undergoing reconstruction since 2023.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===

The LRT Line 1 has two stations in the southern part of the city, namely: Monumento and 5th Avenue. Philippine National Railways (PNR) also has a line, with its terminal at Samson Road, and passes through Caloocan railway station (the first railway station built in the city), 10th Avenue railway station, and 5th Avenue railway station. The currently under construction MRT Line 7 has also two under-construction stations located at the northern part of Caloocan, namely: Sacred Heart and Tala. The North–South Commuter Railway, another currently under construction rail transit system, will replace the existing PNR Metro Commuter Line and will have one station at Caloocan.

The city has an extensive network of roads, the most prominent being Epifanio de los Santos Avenue, which begins in the Monumento area. Quirino Highway, which connects Quezon City and eastern Bulacan, also traverses the northern part of Caloocan. The North Luzon Expressway&#x27;s Operations and Maintenance Center and the motorway&#x27;s Balintawak toll barrier are in the southern part of Caloocan. NLEX Harbor Link, its extension that connects it towards Navotas and Port of Manila, and the NLEX Connector project that connects Harbor Link with the City of Manila and Skyway also traverse Caloocan. The northern end of Skyway, which connects the North and South Luzon Expressways, is also found near NLEX&#x27;s Balintawak toll plaza, with a possible connection to Northern Access Link Expressway, a future toll road to New Manila International Airport.

Bus line Victory Liner Incorporated has its headquarters and terminal along Rizal Avenue Extension near the Monumento station.

===Landmarks===

The city&#x27;s most celebrated landmark is the monument to the revolutionary Andrés Bonifacio, which stands on a roundabout where EDSA, MacArthur Highway, Samson Road, and Rizal Avenue Extension intersect. The memorial was erected in 1933 and consists of an obelisk with sculptures by National Artist Guillermo Tolentino. The monument marks the very first battle of the Philippine Revolution on August 3, 1896. Recent renovations have been made on the environs of the monument, including the Bonifacio Circle, its former site, and the Caloocan stretch of EDSA, which is away from the landmark. The whole area is known as &#x27;Monumento&#x27;. 

Other sites of historical importance identified by the city government include a lot in P. Zamora Street where the wife of Katipunan leader Andrés Bonifacio once resided; the heritage house of Gertrudes Sevilla, the owner of which is the nephew of Gregoria de Jesús; Santa Quiteria Church in Baesa; and Our Lady of Grace Parish in 11th Avenue; La Loma Cemetery, the oldest cemetery in Manila; and Thai To Taoist Temple along 6th Avenue. In addition, the city&#x27;s District Office of the Bureau of Internal Revenue is along EDSA.

==Police==
The Caloocan City Police Station is under the parent agency National Capital Region Police Office&#x27;s Northern Police District of the Philippine National Police. They were once recognized as the best police station for their contribution to the drug war during the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte.

However, the whole Caloocan city police force was recently sacked after a series of crimes, including killings and robberies, were committed by its members. However, instead of dismissing the erring police officers, they were scheduled to be retrained by then Philippine National Police Chief Ronald dela Rosa.

In addition, the Northern Police District is headquartered in Caloocan since 1993.

==Education==
The city&#x27;s lone public university is the University of Caloocan City (formerly Caloocan City Community College in 1971 and Caloocan City Polytechnic College in 1975). Other educational institutions offering tertiary education include University of the East Caloocan, Manila Central University, La Consolacion College-Caloocan, and La Consolacion College – Novaliches, Access Computer College Caloocan, AMA Computer College-Caloocan, STI Academic Center Caloocan, among others.

<doc id="489852" wikidata="Q700556" url="?curid=489852" title="Counts of Celje">
<text>The Counts of Celje () or the Counts of Cilli (; ) were the most influential late medieval noble dynasty on the territory of present-day Slovenia. Risen as vassals of the Habsburg dukes of Styria in the early 14th century, they ruled the County of Cilli as immediate counts (&quot;Reichsgrafen&quot;) from 1341. They soon acquired a large number of feudal possessions also in today&#x27;s Croatia and Bosnia. They rose to Princes of the Holy Roman Empire in 1436. The dynasty reached its peak with Ulrich II of Cilli, but with his death in 1456 they also died out, and after a war of succession, the Habsburgs inherited their domains.

== History ==

The Lords of Sanneck (Žovnek) Castle on the Sann (Savinja) river in Lower Styria were first mentioned around 1123/30. Their ancestors may have been relatives of Saint Hemma of Gurk (d. 1045), who held large estates in the area. The fortress was allegedly already built under the rule of Charlemagne as a stronghold against the Avars.

=== Counts ===
One Leopold of Sanneck appeared as a supporter of the Habsburg king Rudolf I of Germany in the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld. In the early 14th century, the Lords of Sanneck allied with the Austrian Habsburgs in their conflict against Duke Henry VI of Carinthia around the Kingdom of Bohemia, making them Habsburg vassals in 1308. Leopold&#x27;s brother Frederick by marriage inherited the large possessions of the late Counts of Heunburg in 1322; the Celje estates became a property of the dynasty in 1333, not before years of feuds with Count Ulrich V of Pfannberg and other rival noble dynasties. Frederick finally prevailed with the support of Otto the Merry, the Habsburg duke of Styria. He became governor of Carniola and the Windic March in 1332 and was elevated to comital status by Emperor Louis IV in 1341 at Munich, receiving the title &quot;Cylie&quot; or &quot;Cilli&quot; derived from Celje Castle. 

The Counts of Celje soon owned more than 20 castles spread over the territory of modern Slovenia and beyond through the marriages of their daughters. By acquiring large estates in the adjoining duchies of Styria and Carinthia, in the March of Carniola as well as in the territories of the Hungarian Crown (including Croatia and Slavonia), their influence rose and they became one of the most powerful families in the area. Count Ulrich I of Cilli, a leader of mercenary soldiers, joined King Louis I of Hungary on his 1354 campaign into Dalmatia and, shortly afterwards, accompanied the &quot;Rex Romanorum&quot; Charles IV to his coronation at Rome. His son William married Anna of Poland, daughter of the Polish king Casimir III the Great. The Counts of Cilli were related by marriage with rulers of Bosnia and Polish and Hungarian kings. Through Barbara of Cilli the Counts were also in kinship with the royalty of Bohemia.

=== Imperial princes ===
Their rapid rise continued after the 1396 Battle of Nicopolis against the Ottoman Empire, where Count Hermann II of Cilli saved the life of King Sigismund of Hungary, the son of the late Emperor Charles IV. As a reward, the king donated (1397–99) the city of Varaždin, the county of Zagorje, Međimurje region and many estates in Croatia to the family. In 1401, the Counts of Cilli were among Sigismund&#x27;s supporters against the rebellious Hungarian magnates. Their alliance with the Imperial House of Luxembourg became even closer through the marriage of Hermann&#x27;s daughter Barbara of Cilli to the king in 1405. In 1418, Count Hermann II inherited the Carinthian and Carniolan estates of the extinct Counts of Ortenburg, which was subsequently administered by his vassal Andreas von Graben zu Sommeregg. 

In 1410, Sigismund had been elected King of the Romans and was crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 1433. In 1436 he elevated the Counts of Cilli to the rank of Princes of the Holy Roman Empire (although they retained their title of &quot;Graf&quot; ()). The Habsburgs, whose strongest rivals they had become, reacted with a war that lasted until 1443, when an agreement of mutual inheritance was signed.

Count Ulrich II of Cilli was the most powerful member of the Cilli family. In 1432 he married Catherine, daughter of the Serbian despot Đurađ Branković. Ulrich held a large influence in many courts, which originated from the relationships the Cilli family had made in the past. Upon the death of the Habsburg king Albert II in 1439, he tried to get regency of Hungary, Bohemia and Austria through control over Albert&#x27;s minor son Ladislaus the Posthumous. With such ambitions he got many opponents and rivals, such as the Hungarian Hunyadi family, Friderick, the Archduke of Styria and Carinthia (Albert&#x27;s cousin, later emperor Friderick III.) and George of Podebrad. After an unsuccessful claim to the Bosnian crown, Cilli obtained some territories in Croatia and Slavonia and in 1452 finally succeeded in forcing Emperor Frederick III to hand over the boy king Ladislaus to his keeping. Thus, Ulrich II became &quot;de facto&quot; regent of Hungary.

=== Decline ===
In 1456 after the death of his rival John Hunyadi, Ulrich II succeeded him as Captain General of Hungary. That initiated a plot by the Hunyadi family against Ulrich II, and he was assassinated by the men of John Hunyadi&#x27;s son Ladislaus on 8 November in Belgrade.

With the death of Ulrich II the male line of the Counts of Cilli died out, and after a war of succession all of their estates and property were handed over to the Habsburgs on the basis of the inheritance agreement.

== Legacy ==
Part of their coat of arms - the three golden stars on a blue background, which, as Lords of Sanneck, they had inherited from the once powerful Carinthian Counts of Heunburg in 1322 - was incorporated into the Emblem of Yugoslavia in 1920s and the Slovenian coat of arms in 1991. It is also the current coat of arms of Celje.

<doc id="489854" wikidata="Q8861" url="?curid=489854" title="Malabon">
<text>Malabon, officially the City of Malabon (), is a highly urbanized city in the National Capital Region of the Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 380,522 people.

Located just north of the city of Manila, it is primarily a residential and industrial area, and is one of the most densely populated cities in the metropolis. It has a total land area of .

Malabon is part of the sub-region of Metro Manila informally called CAMANAVA, an area which derives its name from the first syllable of its component cities: Caloocan, Malabon, Navotas, and Valenzuela. Caloocan lies to the south and east, Navotas to the west, and Valenzuela to the north. Malabon also borders the town of Obando in the province of Bulacan to the northwest.

==Etymology==
The name Malabon is from Tagalog word &quot;malabon&quot;, meaning &quot;having many silt deposits&quot;. The name was previously also used for two other places in Cavite during the early Spanish colonial period: Santa Cruz de Malabon (now Tanza) and San Francisco de Malabon (now General Trias). It is previously named as Tambobong, after the rural Tagalog word &quot;tambúbong&quot;, which translates to barn.

==History==
===Spanish rule===
Originally called Tambobong, Malabon was founded as a &quot;visita&quot; (hamlet) of Tondo by the Augustinians on May 21, 1599. It remained under the administrative jurisdiction of the Province of Tondo (renamed to Manila in 1859) from 1627 to 1688.

Malabon played an important economic role in the late 19th century with the founding of &quot;La Princesa Tabacalera&quot; tobacco company in 1851 and the Malabon Sugar Company in 1878. La Princesa was under the corporate umbrella of &quot;Compañia General de Tabacos de Filipinas&quot; (owned by the Spanish Crown), while the latter pioneered the refined sugar industry in the Philippines.

In 1859, three Malabon barangays—San Jose, Navotas, and Bangkulasi—were separated from Tambobong to form a new town that is now Navotas.

The newspaper &quot;La Independencia&quot; was first printed in Malabon&#x27;s &quot;Asilo de Huérfanos&quot; (Orphanage), where children orphaned by the Plague of 1882 were housed. 

In 1889, a stream tram line from Tondo borough reached Malabon, later to be linked to the other lines of horse drawn and later electric tramcars in Manila, the latter operated by Meralco until the Second World War. The steam connection would be one of the pioneer steam-powered rail services in Southeast Asia and the first at large in the Philippines, pre-dating the Main Line North of the Philippine National Railways which opened in 1892, 3 years later.

===American rule===
The first Mayor of Malabon was &quot;Don&quot; Agustín Salamante, a Spanish &quot;mestizo&quot; originally from Cavite. The first Filipino Mayor of Malabon was Don Vicente P. Villongco, in 1899 during the onset of the American regime.

Malabon was officially made a municipality of the newly created Province of Rizal on June 11, 1901, by virtue of Philippine Commission Act No. 137. From 1903 to 1906, Navotas was returned to Malabon to form a single municipality.

===Since independence and cityhood===
In 1955, Malabon mayor Florante Villegas of the Liberal Party ran for governor of Rizal, but lost to Nacionalista candidate Isidro Rodriguez from Montalban (now Rodriguez).

Malabon remained a municipality of Rizal until November 7, 1975, when Malabon became a part of the National Capital Region or Metro Manila by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 824.

Malabon became a highly urbanized city on April 21, 2001, under Republic Act No. 9019, 407 years after its founding.

==Geography==

Malabon is one of the most densely populated cities in the Philippines and its low-lying, flat terrain makes it prone to frequent flooding, especially during high tides, heavy rains and when river and dams overflow. The four cities in CAMANAVA are commonly affected by interconnected rivers, one of which is the Tullahan River.

The river system used to be navigable, and fishing was the major livelihood activity in the area. The river used to be wider and deeper with better quality water, and was a regular source of different species of fish, an important food source for local residents. Also, trees and crops like &quot;palay&quot; (rice) and vegetables used to be grown along the riverbanks. However, these agricultural plots have been replaced by industrial yards, which also became home to thousands of informal settlers who built makeshift dwellings without legal claim to the land.

Floods have worsened in recent years, occurring more frequently and reaching depths of several feet. Most affected are families in the communities that are along or near the riverbanks. The river has become narrower and shallower over the years, and its capacity to hold water has decreased. With more frequent intense rains, the riverbanks flood regularly and flooding reaches farther into low-lying and densely populated areas of the city.

===Climate===
===Barangays===

Before the present-day Malabon, the town was originally composed of sitios (barangay) and others were further divided into two or more purok (zone).

Malabon is divided into 21 barangays.
==Demographics==
===Religion===

Malabon belongs to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kalookan under the episcopal seat of Bishop Pablo Virgilio Cardinal David. Almost 80% of the people here adhere to this religion. Today there are eight Roman Catholic Parishes in Malabon.

Malabon bears the old images of San Bartolome in the Poblacion and the La Inmaculada Concepcion, canonically crowned since 1986 during the pontificate of Pope John Paul II.
Other religions in Malabon include Iglesia Filipina Independiente (belongs to the Diocese of Rizal and Pampanga, Parish of La Purisima Concepcion de Malabon), Baptists, Jesus the Living Stone International Assembly of God, Iglesia ni Cristo or Church of Christ, Members of the Church of God International, Jesus Is Lord Church, IEMELIF and Seventh-day Adventist.
==Economy==

Malabon industries include sugar refinery, patis- (fish sauce) making, cigar-making, candle production, fishing and ilang-ilang flower-extract production (the distilled perfume is exported).

==Government==
===City hall===

On April 21, 2008, Malabon&#x27;s newly constructed 11-story city hall building along F. Sevilla Blvd. in Barangay San Agustin, was inaugurated by Gloria Macapagal Arroyo on Malabon&#x27;s 7th City anniversary. It was dubbed as a &quot;potential business center of the city,&quot; a one-stop shop for government transactions, due to its state-of-the-art facilities such as 3 high-speed elevators and the new city hall building and its offices&#x27; &quot;digital system.&quot;

==Tourism==
The Malabon City Tourism Office launched the Malabon Tricycle Tours in December 2014. The tours take visitors to eight heritage sites including the newly renovated 400-year-old San Bartolome Church as well as to notable heritage houses like the Raymundo House and Ibaviosa House.

On March 14, 2015, the tours started to offer visitors a unique gastronomic experience through visits to the city&#x27;s home-based eateries. This culinary aspect was the brainchild of current Mayor Antolin Oreta III&#x27;s wife Melissa Oreta, the next mayor of Malabon.

The Malabon Zoo and Aquarium, located in Potrero, is a small zoo that features an array of caged animals, along with an aquarium and gardens.

==Culture==
Malabon is considered as the local Venice, due to year-long floods and gradual sinking. It is a place famous for its Pancit Malabon and its predominantly Atlantic ambience. It is also famous for other variety of foods (kakanin), such as puto sulot, puto bumbong, sapin-sapin, broas, bibingka and camachile. The culinary delights are abundant in its specialty eateries.

Its most famous festival is the &quot;Pagoda-Caracol&quot;, a fluvial procession with street dancing to commemorate the Feast of the Immaculate Conception every December 8.

===Heritage houses===

Malabon houses several old homes of historical value: the Dionisio family home, the Rivera house, the Villongco house, the Luna house, the Pascual house, the Chikiamco house, the Rojas-Borja house, the (Teodoro) Luna house, the Santos-Lapus house, the Pantaleon Bautista house, the Syjuco (formerly Gaza) house, and the Raymundo house, considered to be the oldest located along C.

<text>Valenzuela (, Tagalog: ), officially the City of Valenzuela (), is a highly urbanized city in the National Capital Region of the Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 714,978 people.

It is the 6th most populous city in the National Capital Region, and the 11th most populous in the country. It is located about north of Manila, the nation&#x27;s capital. Valenzuela is categorized under Republic Act Nos. 7160 and 8526 as a highly urbanized, first-class city based on income classification and number of population. A landlocked chartered city located on the island of Luzon, it is bordered by the province of Bulacan, and cities of Caloocan, Malabon and Quezon City. Valenzuela shares border and access to Tenejeros-Tullahan River with Malabon. It has a total land area of , where its residents are composed of about 72% Tagalog people followed by 5% Bicolanos with a small percentage of foreign nationals.

Valenzuela was named after Pío Valenzuela, a physician and a member of the Katipunan, a secret society founded against the colonial government of Spain. The city, as a town, originally had the name Polo, initially formed in 1621 after separation from Meycauayan, Bulacan. The Battle of Malinta of the Philippine–American War was fought in Polo in 1899. In 1960, President Carlos P. Garcia ordered the split of Polo&#x27;s southern barangays to form another town named as &quot;Valenzuela&quot;. The split was revoked by President Diosdado Macapagal in 1963 after political disagreements and the new merged town was named Valenzuela. The modern-day Valenzuela with its borders was chartered in 1998.

==Toponymy==
In Spanish, &quot;Valenzuela&quot; is a diminutive form of Valencia which means &quot;little Valencia&quot;. The name &quot;Valenzuela&quot; is also the surname of Pío Valenzuela y Alejandrino. He was regarded as a member of the Katipunan triumvirate which started the Philippine Revolution against Spanish colonial authorities in 1896. He also served as the provisional chairman for the Katipunan.

Before 1960, Valenzuela was formerly known as Polo, where Pío Valenzuela was born. The name &quot;Polo&quot; was derived from the Tagalog term &quot;pulô&quot;, which means &quot;island&quot; or &quot;islet&quot;, although the area was not an island itself. The town of Polo was entirely surrounded by the rivers, thus, creating an impression of itself being an island.

==History==
===Early Spanish period===
During the Spanish era, present-day Valenzuela, Obando and Novaliches (now in Quezon City) were parts of Bulacan. Areas now covered by Valenzuela included four haciendas (Malinta, Tala, Piedad, and Maysilo), small political settlements and a Spanish garrison. These areas were known as &quot;Polo&quot;. The region was bounded by the Tullahan River on the south and streams of branching Río Grande de Pampanga on some areas.

When Manila became an archdiocese in 1595, regular friars who had already established permanent churches in Meycauayan decided that the &quot;sitio&quot; of Polo be separated from the town and have its own church to cater its increasing spiritual needs. Through successive efforts of Franciscan friar Juan Taranco and Don Juan Monsód, &quot;sitio&quot; Polo and Catanghalan &quot;(now part of Obando)&quot; was successfully separated from Meycauayan on November 7, 1621, at the feast day of the town&#x27;s new patron, St. Didacus of Alcalá, known locally as &quot;San Diego de Alcalá.&quot; The first &quot;cabeza de barangay&quot; of Polo was Monsód, while Taranco run the parish on a small tavern, which would become the present-day San Diego de Alcalá church. The separation was then confirmed by Governor-General Alonso Fajardo de Entenza in a proclamation letter on November 12, 1623. Later, the date of November 12 is adopted as the foundation day of the city.

=== Polo Church ===
The construction of a parochial church dedicated to St. Didacus of Alcalá started in 1627, under the supervision of José Valencia and Juan Tibay. The first church structure was completed in 1632. But its bell was looted during the Chinese uprising of 1635. At that time, Chinese merchants resided specifically in Barrio Pariancillo, which was located at the back of the church. In 1852, the church was repaired and remodeled under the direction of Fr. Vicente. The church was later re-dedicated to another patron, to the &quot;Nuestra señora de la Inmaculada Concepción.&quot; A convent was also built followed by a common house (&quot;casa tribunal&quot;) that had a rectangular prison cell and a school house made of stone. On June 3, 1865, a strong earthquake destroyed the belfry of the San Diego de Alcalá Church, followed by an epidemic that killed thousands of people.

=== Separation of Obando ===
A new pueblo was carved out of the northwestern area of Polo on May 14, 1753, by the orders of the Governor-General Francisco Jose de Obando y Solis, Marquis of Brindisi. The new town was named Obando in honor of the governor general, and was incorporated to Bulacan.

=== British invasion of Bulacan ===
In 1762-1764 British occupation of Manila and surrounding suburbs the colonial government led by Simón de Anda y Salazar fled to Bacolor, Pampanga through Polo. The British followed Anda, and at one point stayed in sitio Mabolo while waiting for orders from the British civil Governor Dawsonne Drake. They explored the nearby communities of Malanday, Wakas, Dalandanan, Pasolo, Rincon and Malinta. The terrified local population fled and sought refuge in the forests of Viente Reales, where many of them died of malaria. The British then proceed to Malolos, Bulacan where they were ambushed by the stationed Spanish soldiers. After the chase, the local population of Polo returned to their homes on May 12, 1763, after days of reconstruction. The day May 12 was commemorated as the feast of St. Roch, locally known as &quot;San Roque&quot;, as another patron saint and as a memorial to those who died in the Seven Years&#x27; War.

=== Separation of Novaliches ===
In 1854, General Manuel Pavía y Lacy, Marquis de Novaliches, was named Governor-General of the Philippine Islands. He arrived in Manila with the task of establishing a penal colony where prisoners would be granted lands they would develop in exchange for their release. The colony was given the name Hacienda Tala since the once heavily forested area became identical to one where a star (“tala”) had fallen after clearing. This hacienda grew into a larger community that eventually merged with the haciendas of Malinta and Piedad in forming the independent town of Novaliches on January 26, 1856. A new road from Polo to Novaliches opened and traversed the barrios of Mabolo, Pasolo, Rincon, Malinta, Masisan, Paso de Blas, Canumay and Bagbaguin.

=== Revolutionary period ===

In 1869, Filipino physician and patriot Pío Valenzuela was born in Polo. He would be later known as one of the key leaders of the Katipunan, which he joined in 1892 at the age of 23. His admission to the society led to the more recruits from Polo, including Ulpiano Fernández, Gregorio Flamenco, Crispiniano Agustines, and Faustino Duque. When Valenzuela was the chief editor, Fernández held a special role in the Katipunan as a printer of the &quot;Ang Kalayaan,&quot; the organization&#x27;s official newspaper.

The now-defunct Manila-Dagupan Railway opened in 1892 and traversed the barrios of Marulas, Caruhatan, Malinta, Dalandanan and Malanday, with the station being in Dalandanan.

A constituted branch of the Katipunan was established in Polo on February 1, 1896. The town joined other revolutionaries when the Philippine Revolution broke out in August 1896, while Valenzuela availed the amnesty offered by Spanish authorities few weeks later. One of the notable battles in Polo occurred in sitios Bitik and Pasong Balite in Pugad Baboy, where the locals won under the command of General Tiburcio de León y Gregorio. During the revolution, the Spanish massacred many residents, most of them in Malinta. Suspected revolutionaries were hanged and tortured to death. Many were forced to admit guilt or shout innocent names; others were shot without trial.

===American invasion period===
The Americans imposed a military government when they acquire the Philippine islands from Spain as part of the peace treaty of the Spanish–American War. They appointed Pío Valenzuela as the first municipal president of (&quot;presidente municipal&quot;) on September 6, 1899, to suppress aggressive leadership in the area. He resigned in February 1901 to become the head of the military division and an election was held. Later that year, the government proclaimed Rufino Valenzuela, a relative of Pío as the second president and first elected municipal president of the town.

When the Philippine–American War broke out in early 1899, the Americans were directed to capture Emilio Aguinaldo who was escaping to Malolos, Bulacan. Polo was one of the towns where Aguinaldo retreated, thus it received heavy casualties on the first stages of the war. On February 22, 1899, General Antonio Luna camped at Polo after an unsuccessful engagement with the American forces in Caloocan. A bloody battle on March 26, 1899, happened near the barrio chapel of Malinta. The Filipino forces had to retreat with arrival of American reinforcements after being were initially successful in defending Malinta and killing Colonel Harry Egbert.

On October 8, 1903, the adjacent town of Obando merged with Polo by virtue of Act No. 932. It was later separated from Polo effective August 10, 1907, by virtue of Act No. 1588 dated January 25, 1907.
In 1910, a stone arch was built at its municipal boundary with Malabon, Rizal along Calle Real (modern-day Marcelo H. Del Pilar Street). In 1928, Manila North Road (Highway 3) opened and became the new gateway. The once-agricultural town slowly shifted to industrial. Businesses soon put up factories, the most famous of which is the Japanese venture Balintawak Beer Brewery that opened in 1938.

===Japanese occupation period===
The entrance of the Japanese in Polo during the Second World War was met with almost no resistance. However, there were too many murders committed. The place became a center of &quot;Makapili&quot; and spies who troubled the peaceful civilians. It was found that the Balintawak Beer Brewery became front for manufacturing ammunition for the Japanese forces. The sudden appearance of the Japanese added terror to the place. The old church of San Diego de Alcalá became a torture house during WWII.

The reign of terror climaxed on December 10, 1944. It was a day of mourning for the people of Polo and Obando when the Japanese massacred more than a hundred males in both towns. About 1:00 am on this day up to the setting of the sun cries could be heard from the municipal building when males were tortured to death. Mayor Feliciano Ponciano met the same fate when he died on a cruel death together with other municipal officials.

When liberation came, the town was partly burned by the approaching the military forces of combined Filipino and American regiments who used flamethrowers. They bombed and shelled big houses in the town not exempting even the more than 300 years old church of San Diego.

The historical old bridge connecting northern and southern areas of the town was destroyed by the Japanese, thus separating Polo in two parts. The northern part was at once liberated by joint Filipino and American troops while the southern part, which includes the municipal center &quot;poblacion&quot; was still under the Japanese banner. The Japanese abandoned the town on February 11, 1945, when the combined troops were able to cross the river and took the town.

===Philippine independence===
In 1947, the Balintawak Beer Brewery was acquired by San Miguel Beer. The Spanish church was never rebuilt and only the belfry and the entrance arch remained. A new church was built perpendicular to the ruins of the old one.

On July 21, 1960, President Carlos P. Garcia signed Executive Order No. 401 which divided Polo into two: Polo and Valenzuela. Polo comprised the northern barangays of Wawang Pulo, Poblacion, Palasan, Arkong Bato, Pariancillo Villa, Balangkas, Mabolo, Coloong, Malanday, Bisig, Tagalag, Rincon, Pasolo, Punturin, Bignay, Viente Reales, and Dalandanan. Valenzuela, on the other hand, comprised the southern barangays of Karuhatan, Marulas, Malinta, Ugong, Mapulang Lupa, Canumay, Maysan, Parada, Paso de Blas, Bagbaguin and Torres Bugallón (now Gen. T. de Leon). A provisional town hall was built across today’s SM City Valenzuela, until a permanent town hall was built near the intersection of MacArthur Highway and the old Polo-Novaliches Road.

The division soon proved to be detrimental to economic growth in each town, so Bulacan Second district Representative to the Fifth Congress Rogaciano Mercado and Senator Francisco Soc Rodrigo filed a bill which sought the reunification of the two towns. On September 11, 1963, President Diosdado Macapagal signed Executive Order No. 46 which reunified Valenzuela and Polo, adapting &quot;Valenzuela&quot; as the name of the resulting town.

In 1967, mayor Ignacio Santiago Sr. purchased lots in Karuhatan in which the new municipal hall would be built. Misinterpretation of property surveys and tax appropriation issues sparked the debate on which barangay should the municipal hall be belonged to: Karuhatan, Malinta, or Maysan. To resolve the issue, Santiago ordered the creation of a new barangay which was called Poblacion II, a reference to the old Poblacion barangay.

====Incorporation of Metro Manila====
On November 7, 1975, jurisdiction over Valenzuela was moved from the province of Bulacan to Metro Manila. Metro Manila was then headed by First Lady Imelda Marcos as its governor. Due to this, Valenzuela is the only area in the modern National Capital Region that was neither part of Spanish colonial-era Manila, Rizal province, nor the war-time City of Greater Manila.

In 1968, the North Diversion Road (now North Luzon Expressway) was opened. Rail transport to the city ceased in 1988 with the closure of the Philippine National Railway&#x27;s North Line.

====Cityhood====

The passage of the Local Government Code in 1991 provided local governments autonomy which has allowed them develop into self-reliant communities. On February 14, 1998, President Fidel V. Ramos signed Republic Act No. 8526, which converted the municipality of Valenzuela into a highly urbanized chartered city. The law also ordered the division of the newly created city into two legislative districts. When the law was ratified on December 30, 1998, Valenzuela became the 12th city to be admitted in Metro Manila and the 83rd in the Philippines.

===Contemporary===
In 2002, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo proclaimed July 11 every year as &quot;Valenzuela Day&quot;, which was an official holiday in the city that commemorates the birth date of Pío Valenzuela. However, in 2008, the date of the city&#x27;s charter day was transferred to February 14. Today, Valenzuela celebrates &quot;Valenzuela Day&quot; and &quot;Valenzuela Foundation Day&quot; on February 14 and November. 12 respectively

On December 9, 2002, the National Capital Region Police Office announced that they have discovered the largest illegal drugs factory in the country within a Chinese-owned warehouse in Lawang Bato after a fire broke out in the building, achieving the largest methamphetamine drug bust at the time with over worth of drugs seized.

On May 13, 2015, a fire broke out in Kentex Manufacturing factory in barangay Ugong, killing 74 people in the incident. In 2016, the Ombudsman ordered the dismissal of mayor Rex Gatchalian and other city officials due to grave misconduct and negligence of duty during the incident. This is dubbed as the third worst fire incident in the country.

==Geography==
Valenzuela is located at , about north of the country&#x27;s capital, Manila. Manila Bay, the country&#x27;s top port for trade and industry, is located about west of the city. Valenzuela is bordered in the north by the town of Obando and the city of Meycauayan in Bulacan, the city of Navotas in the west, Malabon in the south, and Quezon City and the northern portion of Caloocan in the east.

The highest elevation point is above sea level. Having a surface gradient of 0.55% and a gentle slope, the hilly landscape is located in the industrial section of the city in Canumay. The average elevation point is above sea level.

Apart from the political borders set by the law, Valenzuela and Malabon are also separated by the Tenejeros-Tullahan River or simply &quot;Tullahan River&quot;. The river obtained its name from &quot;tulya&quot; or clam due to the abundance of such shellfish in the area. Tullahan is a part of the Marilao-Meycauayan-Obando river system of central Luzon. It is now considered biologically dead and one of the dirtiest river systems in the world. Tullahan riverbanks used to be lined with mangrove trees and rich with freshwater fish and crabs. Children used to play in the river before it was polluted by developing industries near it.

To save the river, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority and the local governments of Valenzuela and Malabon signed partnerships with private and non-government organizations to dredge the area.

Increased climate variability, which is associated with global warming, has brought with it periods of heavy rainfall and high tides which in turn results in stagnant water which can stay in the area for up to 4 weeks due to insufficient drainage and improper solid waste disposal. People are often stranded inside their homes and are exposed to water-borne diseases such as dengue and leptospirosis. Better early warning systems are needed to manage the risk associated with increased rainfall.

===Administrative divisions===

Valenzuela has 33 barangays, the smallest administrative unit in the city. The barangay is headed by the barangay captain or &quot;punong barangay&quot; and his 7-manned local council or &quot;mga&quot; &quot;kagawad&quot; duly elected by the residents. The youth sector of the barangay is represented by the youth council called the &quot;Sangguniang Kabataan&quot; (SK) headed by the SK chairperson and his 7-manned assembly, also known as &quot;mga SK kagawad&quot;. There are 33 &quot;punong barangays&quot; and 231 &quot;kagawads&quot; in Valenzuela; SK officials are also of the same number. The barangays also serve as census areas of the city.

At the national level, Valenzuela is divided into two congressional districts: the first legislative district in the northern half of the city, which contains 24 barangays, and the second legislative district in the southern half of the city, which contains the remaining 9 barangays. Unlike barangays, the legislative districts have no political leader but are represented by congressional representatives in the House of Representatives of the Philippines.

===Climate===

Due to its location in Metro Manila, the climate of Valenzuela is almost similar to the country&#x27;s capital, Manila. Being on the west coast of the Philippines, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) classifies Valenzuela as &quot;Type I&quot; under its weather scheme. Wind from the Pacific Ocean is generally blocked by the Sierra Madre mountain range several kilometers east of the city.

Its proximity to the equator tends to give the city a very small temperature range, from as low as to as high as , although humidity makes these hot temperatures feel much hotter. The Köppen climate system classifies Valenzuela climate as a borderline tropical monsoon (&quot;Am&quot;) and tropical savanna (&quot;Aw&quot;) due to its location and precipitation characteristics. This means the city has two pronounced seasons: dry and wet seasons.

Humidity levels are usually high in the morning, especially during June–November, making it feel warmer. The lowest humidity levels are recorded in the evening during the wet season. Discomfort from heat and humidity is extreme during May and June and is higher than other places in the country. The average sunlight is highest in April at 254.25 hours and lowest in July, August and September at 113 hours.

===Ecology===
The vegetation in Valenzuela was originally covered with grasslands suitable for agriculture. Because of the rapid development of industries and the economy, land use converts grass covers into cemented roads. However, the government made efforts to preserve vegetation, such as constructing community vegetable gardens and techno-demo farms all over the city. In 2003, these gardens numbered up to two functioning farms.

Flora and fauna in Valenzuela include the common plants and animals found in Luzon, such as domesticated mammals. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources Protected Areas and Wildlife Bureau declared a two-hectare mangrove/swampy area in Villa Encarnacion, barangay Malanday as an ecotourism site. Every year, about 100 species of migratory birds, such as black-crowned night herons (&quot;Nycticorax nycticorax&quot;) and other native birds such as moorhen (&quot;Gallinula sp.&quot;), swamphen (&quot;Porphyrio sp.&quot;) and Philippine duck (&quot;Anas luzonica&quot;) flock the area. Wooden view decks are built to facilitate spectators, enthusiasts and visitors while having birdwatching and counting activities. As of 2020, the said ecotourism site is no longer the Villa Encarnacion today, as the area has been changed, and houses were built on the side of the main road and other residential developments.

In 2007, ordinary fishing ponds in Tagalag and Coloong were transformed into fishing spots which attract anglers every year for a prize catch. Fish tournaments are held yearly to increase tourism and livelihood in the area.

In 2008, the Supreme Court of the Philippines mandated Regional Trial Court Branch 171 as an environmental court handling all environmental cases in Valenzuela.

Thomas Hodge-Smith noted in 1939 that Valenzuela is rich in black tektites occurring in spheroidal and cylindrical shapes and are free of bubbles.

==Government==

===Local government===

Like other cities in the Philippines, Valenzuela is governed by a mayor and a vice mayor who are elected to three-year terms. The mayor is the executive head who leads the city&#x27;s departments in the execution of city ordinances and delivery of public services. The vice mayor heads a legislative council that is composed of 14 members: six councilors from each of the city&#x27;s two districts, and two &quot;ex officio&quot; offices held by the Association of Barangay Chairmen President as the barangay sector representative and the &quot;Sangguniang Kabataan&quot; Federation President as youth sector representative. The council is in charge of creating the city&#x27;s policies in the form of ordinances and resolutions.

The city is geographically part of, but not politically related to, the third district of Metro Manila.

===Elected officials===

The incumbent mayor and vice mayor of the city are Weslie T. Gatchalian and Lorena C. Natividad-Borja, respectively.

===Court system and police===
The Supreme Court of the Philippines recognizes five regional trial courts and two metropolitan trial courts within Valenzuela that have an over-all jurisdiction in the populace of the city.

The Valenzuela City Police Station (VCPS) is one of the four city police stations in the Northern Police District under the jurisdiction of the Nation Capital Region Police office. Today, there are more than 500 police officers working for the VCPS, which puts the police-residents ratio in the city at 1:16,000.

In 2007, the Valenzuela City Peace and Order Council, of which the VCPS is a member, was hailed 2nd placer for the Best Peace and Order Council award that was conferred by the Department of the Interior and Local Government, the NCRPO, and the Manila Peace and Order Council. In 2012, the VCPS was cited by the NCRPO for having the best Women and Children Protection Desk in the metro.

==Culture==

===&quot;Himig Valenzuela&quot;===

&quot;Himig Valenzuela&quot;, or &quot;Valenzuela Hymn&quot;, is the official song of the city. It is sung during flag ceremonies of private and public schools as well as government institutions along with the Philippine national anthem, &quot;Lupang Hinirang&quot;. The hymn was composed by Edwin Ortega which has the primary objective to promote unity, progress and patriotism among the city&#x27;s citizens.

City ordinance number 18 mandated all citizens of Valenzuela to sing the hymn in all meetings and public occasions.

Before its adoption in 2008, Valenzuela has its official hymn during its time as municipality, from being part of Bulacan to Metro Manila, called &quot;Bayang Valenzuela&quot;, composed by Igmidio M. Reyes and its lyrics by Dr. Eusebio S. Vibar. It is now abandoned its use as official hymn of this city. There is a video by Valenzuela City Cultural and Tourism Development Office, which is found on Facebook.

===Feasts and holidays===
In 2007, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo signed Republic Act No. 9428 which sets February 14 every year as a special non-working holiday to commemorate cityhood of Valenzuela in 1998. On the same hand, November 12 each year is declared by the city government as the city&#x27;s foundation day, looking back the establishment of then-Polo in 1623. There are misunderstandings before regarding the date of the actual foundation of the town, however, this date was decided by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines to be the town&#x27;s creation, since Spanish colonizers adopted a town&#x27;s patron saint feast day as its date of creation.

Each barangay in Valenzuela have their own feast. Most of them launch celebrations during May and April to honor patron saints and bounty harvest. Every April 26, a santacruzan is performed along with Santa Cruz Festival in Barangay Isla. A santacruzan is a novena procession commemorating St. Helena&#x27;s mythical finding of the cross. St. Helena was the mother of Constantine the Great. According to legends, 300 years after the death of Christ, at the age of 75, she went to Calvary to conduct a search for the Cross. After some archeological diggings at the site of the Crucifixion, she unearthed three crosses. She tested each one by making a sick servant lie on all three. The cross where the servant recovered was identified as Christ&#x27;s. St. Helena&#x27;s feast day falls on August 8 but the anniversary of the finding of the Cross is on May 3, in the Philippines, this celebration took the form of the Mexican Santa Cruz de Mayo.

The celebration, known as Putong Polo Festival includes a parade featuring artistic creations from the rice cake which showcases creativity among the residents.

== Economy ==

Owing to the cross-migration of people across the country and its location as the northernmost point of Metro Manila, Valenzuela has developed into a multicultural metropolis. A former agricultural rural area, Valenzuela has grown into a major economic and industrial center of the Philippines when a large number of industries relocated to the central parts of the city.

==Tourism==

There are several attractions in Valenzuela that residents and visitors of the city can enjoy.

The Valenzuela City People&#x27;s Park or simply &quot;People&#x27;s Park&quot;, is an urban park located in a 1.3-hectare lot beside the city hall in barangay Karuhatan.

The images were later distributed to churches worldwide, where one of them is intended for the Philippines, however, unclaimed ending up in New Jersey. In 1984, Cardinal Jaime Sin, Archbishop of Manila, finally claimed the statue and was then transferred under the custody Bahay Maria Foundation, a Philippine-based Marian organization. During People Power Revolution in 1986, it was one of the iconic figures held by revolutionaries to oust the dictator Ferdinand Marcos. On October 17, 1999, the statue was then transferred to the shrine. The feast of Our Lady of Fatima is celebrated every March 7 and May 13.

Dr. Pío Valenzuela, who became part of the triumvirate of revolutionary society Katipunan and founder of the organ &quot;Ang Kalayaan&quot;, lived and died in 1956 at the old Residence of Pío Valenzuela along Velilla Street in Barangay Pariancillo Villa, where a marker by the Valenzuela city government was placed in his honor. The present house was built after the war on the site of the old house which once served as venue for secret meetings and gatherings of the Katipunan. The old house was burned during World War II.

The San Diego de Alcala Church and its belfry was built in 1632 by the people of Polo. Residents were taken to forced labor to complete the church after the town gained its independence through Father Juan Taranco and Don Juan Monsod. The belfry and entrance arch, which are over four centuries old, are the only parts of the edifice that remain to this day. The main structure was destroyed by bombs during the Japanese occupation. Residents of barangays Polo and Poblacion celebrate the feast day of San Diego de Alcala on November 12 every year, together with the &quot;putong polo&quot; festival.

==Services==

===Education===

The city collaborates with other institutions, government or private, to bring quality education among its citizens under the &quot;WIN ang Edukasyon Program&quot; (roughly means &quot;Education WIN sic Program&quot;, WIN is the nickname of the current mayor Sherwin Gatchalian). In 2010, the government, in partnership with the local school board, funded the purchase and construction of computer laboratories in 10 secondary schools all having a net worth of (or about as of April 2011). This also includes the distribution of (or about US$34,000 as of April 2011) computers in Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Valenzuela and Valenzuela City Polytechnic College, as part of Department of Education&#x27;s ICT4E Strategic Plan. In this project, information and communication technology education is extended and expanded among all students. In 2009, the City Engineering Office repaired sidewalks and drainage to assist students especially during the wet season; they also repaired and constructed new buildings and classrooms to some schools in the city. Under the same program, elementary school students received free mathematics and English workbooks published by the government especially designed for Valenzuelanos. The steady increase of 3.4% enrollment rate each year forces the government to construct new buildings and classrooms to meet the target 1:45 teacher-to-student ratio, contrary to the current count of 1:50 ratio alternating in three shifts. &quot;WIN ang Edukasyon Program&quot; was done in partnership with the Synergeia Foundation, a non-government organization that aims to improve education in local governments in the Philippines.

At the same time, &quot;WIN ang Edukasyon Program&quot; also spearheads the yearly training of some mathematics and English language teachers assigned to Grades 1 and 2 pupils. The seminar focuses on how to enhance reading skills, language proficiency and mathematics of the students they are teaching through re-acquaintance with various drills and activities. This was done with the efforts of lecturers from Ateneo de Manila University and Bulacan State University using the approach developed by the UP Diliman&#x27;s College of Education.

The government owns Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Valenzuela and Valenzuela City Polytechnic College that serve as the city&#x27;s state university and technical school for residents and non-residents respectively. The Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Valenzuela (PLV) or &quot;University of the City of Valenzuela&quot;, was established in 2002 and is located within the perimeters of the old city hall in barangay Poblacion. In 2009, the city council passed Resolution No. 194 series of 2008 which authorized the government to purchase lots costing PhP 33M (or about US$750,000 as of April 2011) in nearby Children of Mary Immaculate College as part of the university&#x27;s expansion. Mayor Sherwin Gatchalian assisted the development, which has an over-all cost of (or about US$1.7M as of April 2011) loaned from Development Bank of the Philippines. The newly purchased lots are used to construct an annex building which will house the departments of business administration and accountancy. The Board of Regents expected an increase of enrollment from 800 to 3,000 students in the next few years.

Valenzuela City Polytechnic College (VCPC) was allotted with additional (or about US$420,000 as of April 2011) budget in 2009 from the city fund which will be used for expansion and upgrade of the college.

There are also privately owned academic institutions including the Our Lady of Fatima University (OLFU). OLFU was previously granted by Commission on Higher Education an autonomy, which includes independence from monitoring and evaluation services by the Commission though still entitled by subsidies and other financial grants from the national government whenever possible. The autonomous status of the university was approved on March 11, 2009, and expired last March 30, 2014.

===Healthcare===
There are numerous hospitals in Valenzuela like the city-run Valenzuela City Emergency Hospital and the Valenzuela Medical Center. There are also privately owned hospitals like Calalang General Hospital, Sanctissimo Rosario General Hospital and Fatima University Medical Center, a tertiary private hospital under the administration of Our Lady of Fatima University. The soon-to-rise Valenzuela City West Emergency Hospital and Dialysis Center is located in barangay Dalandanan, adjacent to Valenzuela City Astrodome and Dalandanan National High School. It will render adequate healthcare services to underprivileged residents at a minimal fee.

The city implements &quot;VC Cares Program&quot; which is designed for individuals who are unable to provide healthcare and basic necessities for themselves or meet special emergency situations of need. While health care service and financial assistance are generally the forms of assistance given, these may be supplemented by other forms of assistance, as well as problem-solving and referral services. Appropriate referrals may be made to other agencies or institutions where complementary services may be obtained.

According to the 2002 Commission on Audit, the city reported accomplishment per health center ranging from as low as 42.26% to as high as 206% and vaccine utilization of 33% to 90% compared to normal 46% to 377% per basic requirements.

There are swampy areas on Valenzuela and there is a stagnant water in Tullahan River on the south, which make citizens vulnerable to mosquito-linked diseases such as dengue and malaria. Though malaria is not a common case in Valenzuela–the city ranks consistently among top five dengue-infected regions in the Philippines with around 560% chance of recurrence every year. In the second quarter of 2008, however, only 500% increase was reported compared to the same period in 2007.

In September 2009, the Department of Health distributed free Olyset anti-dengue nets treated permethrin insecticide to Gen. T. de Leon High School. Over 150 rolls of the nets were given and installed to the windows of the said school, as part of DOH&#x27;s &quot;Dalaw sa Barangay: Aksyon Kontra Dengue&quot; (Visit Barangay: Action against Dengue) campaign.

====Legal issues====

In April, 2024, Wilbert T. Lee filed House Resolution No. 1674 to investigate the reported complaints against Allied Care Experts Medical Center - Malanday, Valenzuela. Richel Mae Pepito Alvaro, 26, and Lovery Magtangob, 28, “palit-ulo” scheme victims, filed complaints of serious and slight illegal detention with the Valenzuela City Prosecutor&#x27;s Office against the hospital and several of its staff over unsettled hospital bills amounting to P518,519 and P777,378, respectively. &quot;For Case No. 1, a slight illegal detention charge was filed. For Case No. 2, the victim was detained for three days so it will fall [under] serious illegal detention,&quot; Wes Gatchalian said.

===Shopping centers and utilities===

On October 28, 2005, SM Supercenter Valenzuela (now SM City Valenzuela) was inaugurated. Other shopping sites such as Puregold Valenzuela, the newly renovated South Supermarket and the newly opened Puregold Paso de Blas is also located in the city. All these stores compete against each other since most have the same product offerings as diversified groceries except for SM City Valenzuela which has upgraded with the opening of The SM Store. People from the city with more major shopping needs normally head south to cities such as Quezon City and Manila, since they have bigger malls and commercial centers with more diverse trade goods.

Water supply for the city is supplied by the Metropolitan Water Works and Sewerage System (MWSS)&#x27; west concessionaire Maynilad Water Services, Inc. (MWSI). As of 2006, the city has at least 68% water service coverage as determined by the Regulatory Office of the MWSS. Each customer receives at least 7 psi water pressure, which means supply can reach for up to two floors for residential use. Maynilad is owned and currently operated by DMCI Holdings, Inc.–Metro Pacific Investments Corporation (DMCI-MPIC).

On June 2, 2010, the Sitero Francisco Memorial National High School in barangay Ugong unveiled its first solar generators, the first time for a school in the Philippines. The six 1-kilowatt photovoltaic solar arrays installed to light nine-classrooms are bought from Wanxiang America Corporation through the Foundation for Environmental Education (FEE) and are part of the solar energy initiative of the city. The arrays were shipped from Illinois, installation were paid by the city government. First district representative Rex Gatchalian and former second district councilor Shalani Soledad headed the switching ceremony, that made it the first-ever solar-powered school in the country. The solar panels can generate 1 kW to 5 kW of electricity per hour depending on the intensity of sunlight. Unused solar energy is stored in eight deep-cycle batteries which can be used after sunset. The panels also continue to absorb light from the night sky.

===Waste management===
According to the 2002 Metro Manila Solid Waste Management Report of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Valenzuela has the highest number of identified recycling companies in the region. It was also said that recycling centers related to plastic materials are relatively higher than other recyclable objects like metals, paper, glass among others. Accordingly, the city government allocates an amount of about 785.70 Philippine pesos (approx. US$18 as of April 2011) for every transportation and collection costs of a ton of waste material. In 2003, the city generated about 307.70 tons of waste every day. In 2001, it was reported by ADB that the city has as high as 25% solid waste management cost recovery rate through service charges on households and other enterprises for operational activities associated with waste collection, treatment and disposal. That same year, the city&#x27;s proposal to implement a community-based solid waste management project in barangay Mapulang Lupa, was approved by the national government, which involves social mobilization, training of personnel, implementation of segregated collection and establishment of materials recovery facility and windows composting operation among others. The city government was granted a maximum of US$25,000 from Asian Development Bank for the operation of the project.

In 1988, the city opened its first waste disposal facility, the Lingunan Controlled Dumpsite. Every year, the facility collects and processed only about 60% of the entire city&#x27;s waste with landfilling and recycling services. The dumpsite uses rice hull ash as daily cover and odor control material for the waste collected in the area. Lingunan Controlled Dumpsite also conducted some limited waste segregation and resource recovery operations prior to burial of residual waste. In 2006, the controlled dumpsite was closed per MMDA order in 2003 and was subsequently converted into a sanitary landfill as directed by RA 9003.

In statistics, 60% of the wastes collected in the city are collected, hauled and dumped in controlled dumpsites while 5% are retrieved and recycled and 35% are thrown everywhere in the city. Half of all these wastes are non-biodegradable wastes which include plastics, Styrofoams and rubbers alike, while the remaining are biodegradable wastes which is 70% food and kitchen wastes, 20% plant wastes and 10% animal wastes. In 2002, there are about 30 small and big junkshops that collect recyclable materials and 20 schools that require their students to bring recyclable stuff as school project.

The city spearheaded Metro Manila&#x27;s implementation of full-pledged waste management program in 1999 when it became the first area in the region to allocate 2.8-hectare land in barangay Marulas, to serve an ecology center and location for the city&#x27;s waste management program&#x27;s operation center. Biodegradable wastes in this area are converted to fertilizers. In 2004, the city government funded the repair of 29 garbage trucks and purchase of another 20 trucks that may increase the capacity of Waste Management Office to do full rounds of garbage every week.

===Justice management===
In a joint study conducted by the Supreme Court of the Philippines and the United Nations Development Programme in July 2003 assessing inmate and institutional management among selected municipal and city jails in the National Capital Region, it was found that Valenzuela City Jail has a congestion rate of 170%. According to the study, the excess number of inmates in Metro Manila jails resulted into outbreak of various ailments such as psychiatric disorders, pulmonary tuberculosis and skin diseases. The Bureau of Jail Management and Penology recommends the implementation of release programs under applicable laws.

The Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) of Valenzuela is located along Valenzuela Hall of Justice in barangay Karuhatan. It was formerly located at the old city hall in barangay Maysan which was transferred by mayor Sherwin Gatchalian in 2010 along with other trial courts, the police headquarters and prosecutor&#x27;s office of the city. That same year, the BJMP launched the Alternative Learning System program, in partnership with the local government and Department of Education (DepEd), as part of the rehabilitation programs to city jail inmates. Successful passers of the program received certification of DepEd as proof of completion of secondary education.

==Transportation==

Expressways such as the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) and NLEX Harbor Link project traverse through Valenzuela. Valenzuela is accessible to and from NLEX via Paso de Blas Interchange, formerly known as Malinta Exit (due to the road&#x27;s direct access to barangay Malinta), at Km. 28. It also has exits towards barangays Lingunan and Lawang Bato. Meanwhile, the Harbor Link project, where Segments 8.1 and 9 are components of Circumferential Road 5, provides access to Valenzuela through its interchanges at MacArthur Highway (Karuhatan), Harbor Link Interchange with NLEX, and Mindanao Avenue in barangay Ugong, as well as exits towards barangays Parada and Gen. T. de Leon.

Valenzuela is also connected to Bulacan through MacArthur Highway which ends at Bonifacio Monument in Caloocan.

One of the well-known bridges in Valenzuela is the Tullahan Bridge in barangay Marulas that connects the city to barangay Potrero in Malabon. Tullahan bridge is part of MacArthur Highway that was built during the Spanish era as a way of transporting vehicles over Tullahan River. In the span of years, it was renovated repeatedly, most recent was in 2008, though defects on the bridge began to appear barely six months after it opened for public use.

The city is webbed by hundreds of roads where 99.622% of them has a surface type of concrete while the remaining 0.378% were made of dirt. The Department of Public Works and Highways recognizes nine national bridges in Valenzuela, listed below. Other bridges are just minors that connect small cliffs and former landfill areas, like Malinta Bridge in barangay Malinta. City roads has an average road density of 1.155 kilometer of road per 100 square-kilometer of land area. Each road has an average road section of 155 sections and spans .

The Valenzuela Gateway Complex Terminal in Paso de Blas is designated by the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority as Manila&#x27;s northern provincial bus terminal. Bus companies also founded terminals in barangay Malanday, northernmost locality of Valenzuela along the border with Bulacan, though there are terminals situated in barangays Dalandanan and Karuhatan as well. This includes Laguna Star Bus, PAMANA Transport Service, Inc., CEM Trans Services and Philippine Corinthian Liner, Inc. among others. These buses are lined with Metro Manila destinations only, usually in Alabang or Baclaran with routes along EDSA. Bus traffic is also dense at barangays Paso de Blas and Bagbaguin due to its proximity to Paso de Blas Interchange and bus terminals in Novaliches, Quezon City. Other modes of transportation includes jeepneys (with routes usually from Malanday to Recto, Santa Cruz, Divisoria, Pier 15 South Harbor &amp; T. M. Kalaw in Manila and Grace Park &amp; Monumento in Caloocan and Malinta to Malolos City, Baliwag and Santa Maria along MacArthur Highway) for general mass transportation, tricycles (or &quot;trikes&quot;) for small-scale transportation and taxicabs for upper middle classes.

There are no airports and ports in Valenzuela.

<doc id="489861" wikidata="Q213476" url="?curid=489861" title="Tristania (band)">
<text>Tristania was a Norwegian gothic metal band formed in 1996 by Morten Veland, Einar Moen and Kenneth Olsson. Tristania&#x27;s music is usually classified as Gothic metal with death influences, due to its strong tie and legacy within the gothic metal history. Their songs largely dealt with dark and sentimental topics, including depression, sadness, suicide, love, absence, and anger.

The band had not had any known activity from 2016 to October 2018, when they announced that they would perform at 70000 Tons of Metal in early 2019. In 2022, they announced they had disbanded.

== History ==
=== Background ===
In 1992, Morten Veland and Kenneth Olsson formed Uzi Suicide. Since Veland was getting more interested in the UK gothic scene, his songwriting began to take a darker feel. Fragments of the band later became Tristania.

=== Founding and &quot;Widow&#x27;s Weeds&quot;, 1996–1998 ===

Tristania was founded in Stavanger, Norway by Einar Moen (keyboards), Morten Veland (vocals/guitar), and Kenneth Olsson (drums) in 1996. A few weeks later Anders Høyvik Hidle (guitars/vocals) and Rune Østerhus (bass) joined the band. Vibeke Stene was initially recruited as a guest singer for the demo recording in 1997, but she later joined as a regular member. According to Stene, she did not know she was in the band until she read an interview after &quot;Widow&#x27;s Weeds&quot; was released. In May 1997, the band entered the studio for the first time and recorded their demo in Klepp Lydstudio. During the summer of 1997 different labels showed interest in the demo. Tristania signed with Napalm Records and released the EP &quot;Tristania&quot;.

Tristania&#x27;s first full-length album, &quot;Widow&#x27;s Weeds&quot;, was recorded at the end of 1997 and released early 1998. Two guest performers who were involved in &quot;Widow&#x27;s Weeds&quot; would later get more prominent roles on Tristania&#x27;s albums; singer Østen Bergøy (who would later become a full band member) and violinist Pete Johansen. Tristania got to do their first shows outside of Norway as support act for Lacrimosa in Belgium and at the Mind over Matter festival in Austria in August 1998. Later the same year Tristania went on their first European tour, with Solefald and Haggard.

=== &quot;Beyond the Veil&quot;, 1999–2000 ===
The band&#x27;s second full-length album &quot;Beyond the Veil&quot; was released in 1999. As on the debut album, Moen and Veland wrote the majority of the music, but Moen and Hidle emerged as a songwriting team. Tristania went on their first headlining tour with The Sins of Thy Beloved, Trail of Tears and Antichrisis as support acts. The band also toured with Tiamat and Anathema in 1999. The band continued touring extensively in 2000. In December 2000 Veland and the rest of the band agreed on going separate ways, due to musical and personal differences.

=== &quot;World of Glass&quot;, 2001–2002 ===
&quot;World of Glass&quot; was released in September 2001, with guest contributions from Ronny Thorsen, Johansen, and Barkved. The album added classical and industrial elements to Tristania&#x27;s sound, and included the band&#x27;s only cover version: &quot;The Modern End,&quot; originally by Seigmen. Bergøy, now a permanent member of the band, also began to write lyrics on this album and became the band&#x27;s main lyricist. Kjetil Ingebrethsen joined the band prior to the &quot;World of Glass&quot; tour on extreme vocals. On that tour Tristania was supported by Rotting Christ, Vintersorg, and Madder Mortem. More touring of Europe and Latin America followed in 2002.

=== Break, 2003–2004 ===
For over two years (between 2003 and 2004), the band took a break from performing live to focus solely on songwriting.

=== &quot;Ashes&quot; 2005–2006 ===

&quot;Ashes&quot; was released on SPV/Steamhammer Records in February 2005 and featured a stripped-down sound that de-emphasized the classical and operatic elements of the previous albums.
The band then toured Europe and Latin America (sometimes without Moen, who chose to remain at home and focus on songwriting) along with Nightwish, Gothminister, and Kreator. After the tours, Ingebrethsen decided to leave the band as he wanted to continue his musical career at a lower level. The band decided not to recruit a replacement, and Hidle took over the growling vocals.

=== &quot;Illumination&quot; 2007 ===
Tristania&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Illumination&quot;, was released in January 2007, with touring guitarist Svein Terje Solvang added as an official member. Vorph of Samael appeared as a guest singer and a string quartet appeared on several songs. Shortly after the release of the album, Vibeke Stene suddenly decided to quit her musical career in order to focus on family and her work as a teacher. As a result, all planned touring activities were put on hold. In spring 2007, a few months after Stene left Tristania, the Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish were going to announce the name of their new female vocalist. Due to Stene&#x27;s recent departure from Tristania, it was widely discussed in the musical circles whether Vibeke would be inducted into Nightwish to replace Tarja Turunen. The rumor was quickly denied, however, when Stene said in an interview, &quot;I am not the new singer in Nightwish.&quot;

After holding auditions for a singer with a voice different than Stene&#x27;s, Tristania recruited singer Mariangela Demurtas from Sardinia, Italy, who officially joined the band in October 2007.

=== &quot;Rubicon&quot; 2008–2012 ===

Østerhus and Solvang both quit the band in 2008. Ole Vistnes joined as the new bassist and Gyri Losnegaard later joined as second guitarist. The new line-up featuring Demurtas on vocals debuted on 29 February 2008 at a festival appearance in Kyiv, Ukraine. The next member to depart was drummer Kenneth Olsson, who was replaced by Tarald Lie; while singer Østen Bergøy scaled back to part-time status with the band due to family commitments. Kjetil Nordhus was added to the lineup on clean vocals. The band&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;Rubicon&quot;, was released on 25 August 2010.

After the Out of the Dark Festival on 2 October 2011, the Hungarian &quot;Lambda Team&quot; released a freeware PC game about Tristania, named &quot;Tristania 3D&quot;.

On 15 December, the band confirmed a new full-length album on their website for late May 2013, which was going to be called &quot;Darkest White&quot;.

=== &quot;Darkest White&quot;, inactivity, and disbandment 2013–2022 ===
&quot;Darkest White&quot; was recorded in January 2013. The album was critically well received, and often considered the &quot;real come back&quot; for the band after former vocalist Vibeke Stene left the band in 2007. &quot;Sputnikmusic&quot; stated that with &quot;Darkest White&quot; &quot;they have actually outdone themselves,&quot; while &quot;being the same band who released &quot;Rubicon&quot;.&quot; The album was praised for its &quot;exploration of dark, desolate beauty&quot; mood and &quot;emotional thread&quot;. Another aspect that was well received was the &quot;flawlessly accomplished&quot; three-vocalist style driven throughout the album with the harsh vocals from Anders H. Hidle, the clean vocals from the returning Kjetil Nordhus, and Mariangela Demurtas&#x27; female vocals. The combination of these three vocalists was considered &quot;intelligent&quot; and &quot;diligent.&quot;

During their long hiatus between 2016 and 2018, the band not had any known activity, while some of their members joined other musical projects. Tristania returned to the stage in 2018 for some occasional shows, not including new songs.

Finally, on 17 September 2022, Tristania announced their official disbandment, due to an unspecified &quot;medical situation in near family within the band&quot; resulting in the scheduled tour of Latin America in December 2022 being cancelled.

== Music ==
Tristania stood apart from the other bands of the genre with their use of three distinct vocal styles in the &quot;operatic soprano Vibeke Stene, clean-singing baritone Østen Bergøy, and harsh, black metal-style shrieker Morten Veland&quot;. Their second album &quot;Beyond the Veil&quot; in 1999 made use of a ten members choir and featured violin passages from Pete Johansen of The Sins of Thy Beloved, earning &quot;rave reviews&quot; across Europe. By then, the band had risen to &quot;the top of the goth metal heap&quot; with their &quot;lush, symphonically enhanced&quot; approach. They were &quot;dealt a potentially crippling blow&quot; when singer, guitarist and principal composer Veland left the group to form Sirenia. Tristania continued to prosper with subsequent releases and has since been &quot;regarded as one of the world&#x27;s premiere goth metal bands&quot;.

<doc id="489870" wikidata="Q1054581" url="?curid=489870" title="Buffer zone">
<text>A buffer zone, also historically known as a [[March (territory)|march]], is a neutral area that lies between two or more bodies of land; usually, between countries. Depending on the type of buffer zone, it may serve to separate regions or conjoin them.
Common types of buffer zones are demilitarized zones, border zones and certain restrictive easement zones and green belts. Such zones may be comprised by a sovereign state, forming a buffer state.

Buffer zones have various purposes, politically or otherwise. They can be set up for a multitude of reasons, such as to prevent violence, protect the environment, shield residential and commercial zones from industrial accidents or natural disasters, or even isolate prisons. Buffer zones often result in large uninhabited regions that are themselves noteworthy in many increasingly developed or crowded parts of the world that unintentionally create a de facto wildlife sanctuary.

== Conservation ==

For use in nature conservation, a buffer zone is often created to enhance the protection of areas under management for their biodiversity importance. The buffer zone of a protected area may be situated around the periphery of the region or may be a connecting zone within it that links two or more protected areas, therefore increasing their dynamics and conservation productivity. A buffer zone can also be one of the protected area categories (e.g. category V or VI of IUCN Protected Area) or a classification scheme (e.g. NATURA 2000) depending on the conservation objective. The term &#x27;buffer zone&#x27; initially gained prominence in the conservation of natural and cultural heritage through its usage in the establishment of UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage Convention, and the term was intended to be used as follows:
—World Heritage Convention

The buffer zone is one of the Best Management Practices (BMPs). A buffer zone is intended to avert the effect of negative environmental or human influences, whether or not it embodies natural or cultural value itself. The importance and function of a buffer zone and the necessary protective measures derived thereof is a relatively new concept in conservation science and can differ greatly for each site.

== Ecological functions of conservation ==

=== Water quality improvement ===
The quality of surface water in many countries is getting worse due to the misuse of land. Although the buffer zone occupies a small area, it greatly improves the quality of water in the agricultural due to its filtering effect on nutrients in the underground water and surface water.

Because farmland is sprayed with large amounts of pesticides, some of which can seep into surface water, fish and other aquatic life can be negatively affected, which in turn can lead to environmental damage. Vegetation buffer has been proved to be an effective filter for sediment, especially for sediment-bound pesticides. When pesticides are sprayed in excess, a vegetation buffer can be built to reduce the penetration of pesticides into surface water. The buffer zone also prevents heavy metals or toxins from spreading to protected areas.

=== Riverbank stabilization ===
When riverbanks are low due to plant roots entering the interior of the riverbank vertically, the sediment of riverbank is affected by the action of said plant roots, and the ability to resist erosion is higher than that without plant roots. But when the riverbanks are higher, the roots of the plants do not penetrate deeply into the soil, and the lakeshore soil is not very strong. Herbaceous plants can play a role to some extent, but in the long term, vegetation buffer zone can effectively solve the problem of water level rise and water erosion.

The adsorption capacity of a buffer zone can reduce the speed of surface runoff and increase the effective water content of soil. Through increasing soil organic matter content and improving soil structure, a buffer zone can have a positive effect on soil water storage performance. In addition, plant roots make the soil stronger, withstand waves and rainstorm, mitigate the erosion of riverbanks by floods, and effectively control the erosion of the beach.

=== Wildlife food and habitat ===
Riparian buffer zones have been used in many areas to protect the habitats of many animals which are being devastated by increased human activity. The areas around the buffer zone can form the habitat of many animals, and plants can become food for small aquatic animals. The buffer zone itself can also support the life activities of various amphibians and birds. Plants and animals can migrate or spread in response to these buffer zones, thus increasing the biodiversity in the area.

A 1998 study shows that the species and number of animals and plants in riparian zones are higher than in other ecosystems. Because of their ability to provide abundant water, soft soil and stable climate, small animals such as &quot;Myotis&quot; and &quot;Martes&quot; prefer to live along riverbanks rather than in hilly areas. The buffer zone can also provide a good environment for upland habitat, which is in line with the living conditions of freshwater turtles, making them more dependent on the wetland environment. The protection level of the buffer zones will affect the habitat range of amphibians and reptiles, and the environmental management of the wetland habitat around buffer zone is extremely important.

=== Providing aesthetic value ===
Vegetation buffer zones form a variety of landscapes as an important part of the riparian zone. Combining land and water improves the aesthetic value of river basin landscapes. The riparian buffer is rich in plant resources, and the wetland, grassland, and forest ecosystems make the landscape more beautiful. In addition, some recreational facilities can be built in the buffer zone to provide better living conditions for residents or tourists and improve people&#x27;s quality of life.

In the buffer zone, trees up to 6 meters tall greatly enhance the aesthetic value of the landscape. These tall trees have luxuriant branches and leaves, especially their upright posture, making them of higher ornamental value. Some colorful landscape tree species can be planted on both sides of rivers with tourism and sightseeing value to improve the aesthetic value of the place. Establishing vegetation in the buffer zone can increase green land, improve forest coverage, beautify the environment and visual effect, improve people&#x27;s living environment, enrich the humanistic landscape, and enhance aesthetic value. By emphasizing the importance of the buffer zone, residents can be encouraged to participate in the protection and management of the buffer zone, and checkpoints around the buffer zone can be set up to make it more secure and effective.

<doc id="489873" wikidata="Q4659080" url="?curid=489873" title="A Quaker Action Group">
<text>A Quaker Action Group (AQAG) was founded in Philadelphia during the summer of 1966 to &quot;apply nonviolent direct action as a witness against the war in Vietnam&quot;.

==History==
Founding member Lawrence Scott was a Quaker and radical pacifist who had worked for the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) in the 1950s, but resigned in protest at what he saw as the AFSC&#x27;s preference for words over action. AQAG, which was based in the peace committees of the Religious Society of Friends&#x27; New York and Philadelphia Yearly meetings, aimed to renew the Society of Friends commitment to its historic peace testimony.

In 1966, AQAG attempted to mail relief packages to North Vietnam, only to have the US Postal Service refuse the delivery. When they collected money for the North and South Vietnamese Red Cross Societies, the Treasury seized the donated funds.

In March 1967, members of AQAG sailed to North Vietnam in the yacht &quot;Phoenix&quot;, carrying medical supplies for North Vietnamese wounded by the American bombing. The protest generated wide media coverage.

In 1971, East Pakistan was attempting to break free from the government in West Pakistan; it would become Bangladesh. The overwhelming public sentiment in the U.S. was in favor of Bangladeshi independence. Very few Americans were aware that the US government was providing arms to Pakistan, which it was using to suppress the independence of Bangladesh. AQAG decided to take action to publicize the shipping of arms from Baltimore to Pakistan. On July 14, 1971, members of AQAG took to Baltimore Harbor in small boats and kayaks to blockade the Padma, a ship loaded with weapons the U.S. was secretly sending to Pakistan. Media coverage of this quixotic action made national news and led to the stopping of U.S. support of Pakistan against Bangladesh.

==Legacy==
In the early seventies, AQAG, having abandoned its goal of transforming the Society of Friends, evolved into the Movement for a New Society, a self-styled &quot;transformational network&quot; dedicated to spreading the practice of non-violent practices throughout the social change networks in North America, and which would play a key role in the anti-nuclear movement of the 1970s.

==Other Quaker Action Groups==

Following the pattern of AQAG, several Quaker action groups were formed in the UK in the late 1960s, most notably in Manchester and London. These groups focused mainly on pacifist campaigns, community living, and local projects such as providing food and shelter for homeless people.

<doc id="489880" wikidata="Q1021167" url="?curid=489880" title="Troon">
<text>Troon (Scottish Gaelic: &quot;An Truthail / An t-Sròn&quot;) is a town and sea port in South Ayrshire, situated on the west coast of Ayrshire in Scotland, about north of Ayr and northwest of Glasgow Prestwick Airport. Troon has a port with ferry and freight services, and a yacht marina. Up until January 2016, P&amp;O operated a seasonal ferry service to Larne. In May 2006, a ferry service to Campbeltown was added, although this was withdrawn the following year. Since March 2024, Caledonian MacBrayne have operated a ferry service to Brodick on the Isle of Arran.

In the 2001 census the population of Troon, not including the nearby village of Loans but including the Barassie area, was estimated at 14,766, a 4.77% increase on the 1991 estimate of 14,094. The population in 2024 is just over 15,000.

== Name ==
The name &quot;Troon&quot; is likely from a Brythonic or Pictish name cognate with Welsh (&quot;nose, cape&quot;). When Scottish Gaelic became the main language, it is possible that the Gaelic form (; &quot;the nose&quot;) was used for the name Troon. Since the words &quot;sròn&quot; and &quot;trwyn&quot; are cognate, it could have been easily adapted from one language to the other. This is similar to the Gaelic name of Stranraer (&quot;An t-Sròn Reamhar&quot;, the fat nose), which lies further south on the coast. However, it is not certain if &quot;An t-Sròn&quot; was the Gaelic name, as its usage cannot be traced back any further than Johnston&#x27;s &quot;Place-names of Scotland&quot; (1932). It is more likely that a gaelicized respelling, such as &quot;An Trùn&quot;, was used.

The name &quot;An Truthail&quot; was used by Gaelic speakers on nearby Arran Island up until the 20th century.

== History ==
===Early history===

In 1808, the 3rd Duke of Portland added docks to the existing natural harbour on the north side of the headland, under powers granted by an act of Parliament, the 
 (48 Geo. 3. c. xlvii). The harbour opened in 1812 to serve the Kilmarnock and Troon Railway. Later improvements increased the protection afforded by the headland with an artificial &quot;ballast bank&quot; made from the dumped ballast of incoming merchant ships. Troon Lifeboat Station opened at the harbour in 1871 on land donated by the Duke of Portland. 

Troon Harbour played a notable part in the development of the town for many years. It was home to the Ailsa Shipbuilding Company, which constructed many vessels for worldwide customers but mainly small passenger and various merchant vessels. The fishing fleet from Ayr moved to Troon Harbour and a revitalisation of the abandoned section of the harbour started. An approach road was constructed to connect to a P&amp;O terminal which operates a service to Ireland. The Seacat high speed ferry service briefly operated from Troon Harbour. It is now a fishing port, yachting marina, seasonal passenger ferry port and Ro-Ro ferry terminal for timber and containers. Shipbuilding at Troon Harbour ended in 2000.

===Economic growth===
From 1812 Troon was the terminus of the Kilmarnock and Troon Railway, a horse-drawn railway connecting it to the duke&#x27;s coal mines around Kilmarnock. This was not licensed for passengers, a minor technicality evaded by weighing those wishing to travel and charging them freight rates. Troon (old) railway station was one of the first passenger stations in Scotland, formed in 1839 when the Kilmarnock and Troon Railway was upgraded to run steam locomotives as part of the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway. The town is now served by Troon railway station.

Troon is the birthplace of C. K. Marr, who left a fund to the people of Troon which was used to construct Marr College, the town&#x27;s secondary school.

The artist&#x27;s impression and the theoretical master plan for Troon that the Duke of Portland had drawn up was almost on as grand a scale, relative to its size, as that of Edinburgh&#x27;s New Town. The broad streets with a grid network and ample space for civic amenities created for a thriving community built around the industry of the harbour. Troon&#x27;s prosperity allowed this confident plan to be proposed. The drawing shows two spires, the taller spire was of that proposed by Troon Parish Church. Although the new building was erected in 1895 the spire was never completed. To the right a smaller spire indicates Portland Street United Free Church, which sat behind where WH Smith is today.

The first railway in Scotland (Troon to Kilmarnock 1811) is clearly showing in the background. It was the Glasgow and South Western Railway in 1892 who altered this plan by building a loop to bring passengers closer to the beach and town. The park never came to pass but public spaces on the promenade, (where the bandstand was built), the ballast bank and Fullarton ground allow residents and visitors scope for leisure. The industrial units to the right of the harbour line towards Barassie were the gas works and slaughter house.

===Fullarton House===

Fullarton House was built by William Fullarton of that ilk in 1745 and altered by his son, however it was demolished in 1966 by the council who had been unable to maintain the building after purchasing it in 1928. The entrance route had been changed by the Duke of Portland and the house design altered so that the back became the front, with grand views opened up of the Isle of Arran and Firth of Clyde. After centuries of occupation the Fullarton lines possession had thus come to an end when the 3rd Duke of Portland purchased the property in 1805. He lived here for a while as his principal residence in Scotland, however he had a greater interest in developing Troon harbour and the Kilmarnock and Troon Railway.

The grounds are now a park with some signs of the old house still apparent, such as the magnificent stable block, the ornamental pediments, walled gardens, doocot and an ice house. Reed Loch was located near Lochgreen House and was used latterly as a curling pond.

====The Fullarton family====
The name is thought to come from the office of &#x27;Fowler to the King&#x27;, the purpose of which was to supply wild-fowl to the King as required. The dwelling which came with the post was called Fowlertoun and the family may have eventually adopted the name. The Fullarton&#x27;s of Angus had been required by Robert I to supply him with wild-fowl at his castle of Forfar.

Alanus de Fowlertoun was in possession of the lands shortly before his death in 1280 and the family continued in a nearly unbroken line from father to son. William Fullarton, the builder of the house, inherited the estate from his grandfather in 1710, he having inherited it from his brother in turn. Colonel Fullarton died in 1808, the last Fullarton of that Ilk laird. He wrote in 1793 the seminal &quot;A General View of the Agriculture in the County of Ayr&quot; and was one of the few on record to praise Robert Burns&#x27;s skills as a farmer, commenting favourably on a method of dishorning cattle which the poet had demonstrated. Burns is said to have visited Fullarton.

===Crosbie Castle===
Robert II granted the old Crosbie estate to the Fullartons in 1344 and by the 18th century the old castle was partly demolished and converted into an ice house for Fullarton House, with a doocot nearby. In 1969 more of the ice house was demolished to make it safe. The building had been known as Crosby Place and later became Fullarton House, not long before the new building of the same name replaced it.

Over the centuries the castle was rebuilt three times, in the same typical square design as seen at Dundonald Castle. The remains today mainly represent the Castle&#x27;s dungeon. Many of Crosbie Castle&#x27;s stones were used in the construction of the first Fullarton House. The dungeon, had an underground stream, making it the ideal cold storage cellar or ice house.

=== Crosbie church and cemetery ===

First recorded in 1229, the present structure dates from 1691. Tradition claims that the roof blew off on the day in 1759 that Robert Burns was born and it was left to become a ruin. One of the graves is that off David Hamilton of Bothwellhaugh, son of James, alleged assassin of the Regent Moray, bastard son of James V. This event occurred in 1570 and David died in 1619. David Fullarton of that Ilk had married David&#x27;s sister.

Constructed on the site of the original chapel, the name comes from the Anglo-Saxon word &#x27;Crossbye&#x27;, signifying the dwelling of the cross; a fairly common placename. The cemetery dates from circa 1240 and was held in secular times by Fullarton of Crosbie in the 14th century after being passed on from relatives. Records indicate that this ground was used by a holy order before the Fullartons arrived in the area. The chapelry of Crosbie, together with that of Richardstoun (Riccartoun) were attached to Dundonald and were granted by the second Walter Stewart to the short-lived Gilbertine Convent which he had founded at Dalmulin before 1228. The convent was dis-established in 1238 and the chapel passed to the monks of Paisley Abbey.

The cemetery was the burial ground for Troon until 1862 and family lairs were still in use until after the First World War. On the other side of the road, the remains of the church manse can still be seen (2009). The &#x27;Wrack Road&#x27; was the Fullarton Estate estate road used by tenants who took their carts down to the shore to collect seaweed or wrack as fertilizer and it was the main road from Troon for funerals going to Crosbie.

==Politics and governance==

Troon is part of the Ayr Scottish parliamentary constituency which has been represented by Scottish National Party (SNP) MSP Siobhian Brown since the 2021 Scottish Parliament election. The constituency also incorporates the towns of Ayr and Prestwick. At Westminster, Troon has formed part of the Central Ayrshire constituency since 2005. It is represented by Scottish Labour MP Alan Gemmell: the constituency extends south into Prestwick and rural South Ayrshire and north into Irvine and part of Kilwinning.

Councillors serving Troon 
Four Councillors currently represent the Troon ward as part of South Ayrshire Council:
Troon Town Hall, which is the meeting place of Troon Community Council, was completed in 1932.

On 18 September 2014 a referendum was held on Scottish independence from the United Kingdom. The South Ayrshire Council area voted against Scotland becoming an independent country at 58% No 42% Yes whilst Troon (which was counted with the rest of South Ayrshire) voted overwhelmingly against independence at 65% No 35% Yes.

==Economy==
Troon is home to the Royal Troon golf course, one of the hosts of the Open Golf Championship. The course is chosen to host this annual event roughly every seven years, and will do so again for the 2024 Open Championship.

SeaCat opened passenger services from Troon in 1999, with catamaran ferries to Ireland. They were followed by P&amp;O Irish Sea in 2003. SeaCat closed the following year. Up until 2015, P&amp;O Ferries operated seasonal sailings with the high speed catamaran HSC &quot;Express&quot;: the term &#x27;SeaCat&#x27; is often used to refer to the P&amp;O service. P&amp;O announced on 13 January 2016 that the Troon–Larne service was to close with immediate effect. The former SeaCat terminal is currently fenced off and is being used as log storage.

During a period of expansion and renovation work to the ferry terminal at Ardrossan in North Ayrshire, the ferry terminal at Troon has been used by ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne for the Brodick sailings to the Isle of Arran. In March 2024, Caledonian MacBrayne confirmed plans to trial berthing the vessel &quot;MV Isle of Arran&quot; at Troon Harbour, and if successful, the vessel would commence further trials from sailing from Troon to Brodick.
==Education==
 

Troon has five primary schools. Four (Troon Primary School, Muirhead Primary School, Struthers Primary School and Barassie Primary School) are non-denominational, and one primary school provides Catholic educational provision: St. Patrick&#x27;s Primary School. Early years education is provided with a mix of private establishments and local authority establishments attached to primary schools which are operated by South Ayrshire Council. Troon is served by one secondary school, Marr College, which is operated by South Ayrshire Council. Pupils who access Catholic educational provision usually transfer to Queen Margaret Academy in nearby Ayr as Troon currently has no separate secondary school that accommodates this provision.

After school care provision in Troon is again a mix of private establishments and one local authority operated after school care club, which is based in and operated from Muirhead Care Club in the Muirhead area of the town.

==Sport and culture==

Troon is perhaps most famous for its golf courses, but there is also a healthy sporting culture in other disciplines such as windsurfing and kitesurfing. Troon Handball Club is a handball club that is located in Troon. The club was founded in 2008 when Ayrshire Handball Club disbanded into Ayr HC, Belmont HC, Grange HC (formerly Kilmarnock HC), Kyle Academy HC and Troon Handball Club. The club has two senior teams, a men&#x27;s team and a woman&#x27;s team, both coached by head coach Stephen Neilson, a former Scottish and British handball player. Both the men and woman&#x27;s teams compete in the top tier of the Scottish Handball Association league system. The club also has a thriving junior section that is coached by men&#x27;s first team player Chris Kerr. The club also works closely with Marr College, the local secondary school, and has been crowned Scottish schools and junior Scottish Cup champions on several occasions.

Troon F.C. is the senior football side in the area, representing the town in the West of Scotland Football League, and play at Portland Park, close to the town&#x27;s heart in Portland Street. The prominent sports team in the village is Troon Dundonald A.F.C. The club was formed in 1983 by 3 &#x27;ageing&#x27; players, at which time they were named Troon Burns A.F.C., and have now surpassed their 30th season in the Ayrshire Amateur Football Association. During this time they have had a few name changes, sometimes due to sponsorship commitments, but in 1998/99 season, they settled on Troon Amateurs Football Club. The club President, Stuart Urquhart, still remains from the original founders of the club and he is as passionate as ever about everything that goes on within the club, as well as with amateur football in general.

In the years since their formation, they have enjoyed three promotions in back to back seasons, 1983-1984 through 1985-1986, which saw them go from the fourth division to the first of Ayrshire&#x27;s Amateur Leagues, which is one of the largest and toughest amateur leagues in Scotland.

<text>Graeme Ronald Strachan (pronounced &quot;Strawn&quot;) (2 January 195229 August 2001), professionally billed and known as &quot;Shirley&quot; Strachan or Shirl, was an Australian singer, songwriter, radio and television presenter, and carpenter. He was the lead singer of the rock group Skyhooks (1974–1978, 1983, 1984, 1990, 1994). While still a member of Skyhooks, he had solo singles, which charted on the Kent Music Report, with a cover recording of Brenda Holloway&#x27;s &quot;Every Little Bit Hurts&quot; (October 1976, No. 3) and a remake of The Miracles &quot;Tracks of My Tears&quot; (July 1977, top 20). After leaving Skyhooks in July 1978, he concentrated on his solo career. He was the host of children&#x27;s TV program &quot;Shirl&#x27;s Neighbourhood&quot; (1979–83). From 1993, he appeared on home renovation TV program &quot;Our House&quot; as a carpenter and co-host. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1993, Skyhooks were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame. Strachan died in August 2001 in a self-piloted helicopter accident.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Strachan born in Malvern, Victoria, on 2 January 1952 and grew up in Mount Waverley. He was the older brother of three sisters, and he was the son of Joyce and Ronald Strachan, who was a carpenter and former World War II Navy sailor. Strachan became an avid surfer, and his nickname &quot;Shirley&quot; was applied by fellow surfers due to his long, sunbleached and curly hair (referring to Shirley Temple). He was educated at Mount Waverley High School to the end of year 10, where he completed an apprenticeship as a carpenter.

Strachan was a well-known supporter of the Hawthorn Football Club in the AFL.

===Music career and Skyhooks===
Strachan met &quot;Freddy&quot; Strauks, a drummer, at a performance at Village Green. Strachan would later drive his friend to gigs. Strauks and Greg Macainsh, on bass guitar, were members of Claptrap in 1970, and they asked Strachan to join on lead vocals in the following year. The group were renamed Frame with Strachan; Strauks and Macainsh were joined by Pat O&#x27;Brien and Sintjio Oohms, both on guitars. The group&#x27;s debut performance was on 19 April 1971 at Eltham&#x27;s Montsalvat, where Strachan &quot;stood facing the band, too shy to face the audience&quot;.

In November 1972, Strachan left Frame and moved to Phillip Island to take up surfing and part-time carpentry. He later recalled, &quot;You&#x27;d get up in the morning and look out the window and say &#x27;yeah&#x27;. Then you&#x27;d go down to Woolami and check it out. There&#x27;d be a few bars there, and you&#x27;d go surfing. Then you&#x27;d have lunch and perhaps a couple of hours&#x27; work, and then it&#x27;s high tide, so you go surfing again.&quot; While Strachan was surfing at Philip Island, Macainsh and Strauks formed a new band, Skyhooks, in March 1973 with Steve Hill on lead vocals (ex-Lillee), Peter Inglis on guitar (ex–Captain Matchbox Whoopee Band) and Peter Starkie on guitar and vocals (ex–Lipp &amp; the Double Decker Brothers). In March 1974, Strachan replaced Hill on lead vocals in Skyhooks alongside Macainsh, Strauks and Bob &quot;Bongo&quot; Starkie (ex–Mary Jane Union) and Red Symons (ex-Scumbag), both on guitars.

Australian musicologist Ian McFarlane described Strachan as &quot;a natural frontman: young and gifted, loudmouthed and witty, blessed with a sweet yet powerful voice and androgynous good looks&quot;. Ed Nimmervoll, a music journalist, opined that &quot;Not only did he have a new identity, he took his singing role on with new maturity and attitude. [Macainsh] told him he&#x27;d need to work the stage, and &#x27;Shirl&#x27; never looked back, roaming the stage like a maniac.&quot; In December 1975, they toured nationally, which Strachan declared was &quot;the biggest tour ever undertaken by an Australian group. Every concert will be performed in the open air&quot;. The group followed with a tour of the United States with some performances as a support act to Uriah Heep.

Strachan started his solo singing career during his time with Skyhooks. In October 1976, he issued a cover version of Brenda Holloway&#x27;s 1964 hit &quot;Every Little Bit Hurts&quot; as his debut single, which peaked at No. 3 on the Kent Music Report Singles Chart. It was produced by Warren Morgan, engineered by Ross Cockle and recorded at Armstrong Studios on Mushroom Records/Festival Records. The B-side, &quot;Cruisin&#x27; Out on You&quot;, was co-written by Strachan with Morgan.

His follow-up single, &quot;Tracks of My Tears&quot;, a cover of Smokey Robinson and the Miracles&#x27; 1965 hit, reached No. 18 in July 1977. It was produced by Ric Formosa, engineered by Cockle, and recorded at Armstrongs. The B-side, &quot;Missing You&quot;, was co-written by Strachan and Bob Spencer (Skyhooks&#x27; then-current guitarist). According to Nimmervoll, &quot;Skyhooks in the meantime had started to struggle, and not one to do something he wasn&#x27;t enjoying any more, Shirl left. It didn&#x27;t mean that much to him.&quot; In July 1978 Strachan left Skyhooks, but his departure was not announced until the following January. He was replaced on lead vocals by Tony Williams of Reuben Tice. During 1978, he issued his third solo single, &quot;Mr Summer&quot;, which did not chart.

===Post-Skyhooks and &quot;Shirl&#x27;s Neighbourhood&quot;===
After Skyhooks, Strachan worked as a radio and television presenter. He became known to a new generation as the host of a magazine-style children&#x27;s TV series, &quot;Shirl&#x27;s Neighbourhood&quot;, from 1979 to 1983. He issued his debut solo album, &quot;It&#x27;s all Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll to Me&quot;, in 1980. At the Logie Awards of 1983, &quot;Shirl&#x27;s Neighbourhood&quot; won Best Children&#x27;s TV Series. He organised and participated in several Skyhooks reformations during the 1980s and 1990s.

===Party Boys, radio, &quot;Our House&quot; and Skyhooks reunions===
In 1984, Strachan joined a rock supergroup, the Party Boys, for a national tour and was recorded on lead vocals for their third live album, &quot;No Song Too Sacred&quot;, alongside founding members Graham Bidstrup on drums, Kevin Borich on guitar and Paul Christie on bass guitar, and new guitarist, Robin Riley (ex-Rose Tattoo). The album provided their cover version of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Kashmir&quot; as a single.

At the ARIA Music Awards of 1993 in March, Skyhooks were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame. Strachan relocated to Queensland in that year and started as a regular presenter on home makeover program, &quot;Our House&quot;, where he resurrected skills from his pre-Skyhooks carpentry trade. He also presented a breakfast radio show, with Gary Belcher and Dean Miller, on the radio station Triple M Brisbane in the 1990s. Strachan left Triple M in 1997 following a pay dispute. He died in August 2001 while solo-piloting a helicopter, aged 49.

A biography of Strachan, &quot;Shirl: The Life of Legendary Larrikin Graeme &#x27;Shirley&#x27; Strachan&quot;, written by Jeff Apter, appeared in 2012. Apter had already written 15 celebrity biographies; for &quot;Shirl&quot;, Apter had access to Skyhooks&#x27; band members, Strachan&#x27;s family, and &quot;music industry figures, people from Strachan&#x27;s later career in TV and radio, and the surfing gang he assembled after relocating to Queensland in the 90s.&quot; Alistair Jones of &quot;The Australian&quot; felt that Apter&#x27;s sources &quot;all contribute to a picture of a good bloke fondly remembered&quot; with the biography&#x27;s strength being the &quot;input that keeps the journey of a larger-than-life character grounded in personal terms&quot; while a &quot;down-side&quot; was that &quot;in sympathetically honouring the trust of his sources, &quot;Shirl&quot; becomes something of a tear-jerker.&quot;

== Personal life ==

In August 1975, Strachan married Sandra Davis at a registry office in London. The pair had started dating when he was surfing and working on Phillip Island in 1972–73. By October 1977, the couple had separated. Strachan&#x27;s second wife was Sue Scott. The couple met in 1981 when he was a guest of the TV game show &quot;Catch Us If You Can&quot;, where Scott was a model and presenter. In 1993, the Strachans moved to Queensland.

===Death===
Strachan was killed in a helicopter crash on 29 August 2001, at the age of 49. He had been a fixed-wing pilot for many years and had been undergoing training for a helicopter pilot&#x27;s licence, with a view to buying a helicopter and taking friends and family on surfing safaris. On a solo flight near Mount Archer, Queensland, in clear weather and inexplicably off the course planned by his instructor, Strachan encountered mountain turbulence which caused the rotor of his Bell 47G to sever the tailboom, crashing the helicopter onto the north-north-eastern slope of Mount Archer. The day Strachan died was, coincidentally, the day an ABC documentary episode on rock and roll in Australia, &quot;Long Way to the Top&quot;, which referred to the Skyhooks, aired on TV.

===Tributes===

In early September 2001, a beachside funeral was attended by Strachan&#x27;s family and friends, including Skyhooks&#x27; guitarist, Red Symons, and radio colleagues, Gary Belcher and Dean Miller. His ashes were scattered into the sea from a helicopter by his wife, Sue.

Triple M Brisbane, Strachan&#x27;s former employer, held a day-long on-air tribute to him on the day after his death. Old archived audio was played on air. An episode of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation documentary &quot;Long Way to the Top&quot; featuring Skyhooks was broadcast on the day of his death: it was dedicated to his memory. On 10 September, Channel Nine broadcast a tribute episode of &quot;Our House&quot;, &quot;Our House – Memories of Shirl&quot;, with content filmed in the weeks before his death, along with archival footage. It was the most-watched program on that night, with 2.19 million viewers.

In September 2001, remaining members of Skyhooks reunited for a memorial gig at the Palais Theatre, St Kilda. Guest vocalists included Daryl Braithwaite on &quot;All My Friends Are Getting Married&quot; and Ross Wilson on &quot;Warm Wind in the City&quot;.

=== Shirley Strachan Memorial Swim ===
The Noosa Heads Surf Lifesaving Club has been holding a competitive surf swim commemorating Shirley Strachan since 2002 – the Annual Shirley Strachan Memorial Swim. It was originally organised Bruce and Sandy Warren. In November 2016, Bruce Warren died, and subsequent swims have been re-named the Shirley Strachan and Bruce Warren Memorial Swim.

<doc id="489894" wikidata="Q273158" url="?curid=489894" title="Irene Morgan">
<text>Irene Amos Morgan (April 9, 1917 – August 10, 2007), later known as Irene Morgan Kirkaldy, was an African-American woman from Baltimore, Maryland, who was arrested in Middlesex County, Virginia, in 1944 under a state law imposing racial segregation in public facilities and transportation. She was traveling on an interstate bus that operated under federal law and regulations. She refused to give up her seat in what the driver said was the &quot;white section&quot;. At the time she worked for a defense contractor on the production line for B-26 Marauders.

Morgan consulted with attorneys to appeal her conviction and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund took up her case. She was represented by William H. Hastie, the former governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands and later a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and Thurgood Marshall, legal counsel of the NAACP. Her case, &quot;Irene Morgan v. Commonwealth of Virginia,&quot; , was appealed to the United States Supreme Court. In 1946 in a landmark decision, the Court ruled that the Virginia law was unconstitutional, as the Commerce clause protected interstate traffic. But neither Virginia nor other states observed the ruling and it was not enforced for decades.

==Early life, education and family==
Irene Morgan was born in 1917 in Baltimore. She went to local schools and was raised as a Seventh-day Adventist. Morgan married Sherwood Morgan Sr., and had a son and daughter with him. He died in 1948.

During World War II, she helped the war effort by working at Glenn L. Martin, an aircraft manufacturer and defense contractor in Baltimore. She worked on the production line for the B-26 Marauder.

She later married Stanley Kirkaldy and lived with him in New York City. They ran a dry-cleaning business and a child-care center near where they lived in Queens. In her 60s Kirkaldy started college studies, attending St. John&#x27;s University in New York City; she received her bachelor&#x27;s degree when she was 68 years old. Five years later Morgan earned a master&#x27;s degree in Urban Studies from Queens College.

== Arrest, jail and conviction ==
Irene Morgan had been dealing with a recent miscarriage and was visiting her mother in Gloucester County, Virginia, to physically and mentally recover from the ordeal. Hoping to go back home so she could continue working on the production line for the B-26 Marauder, Morgan boarded a Greyhound to return to Baltimore. On July 16, 1944, Morgan boarded the Greyhound bus and had sat down next to another African-American woman who was carrying an infant. An African-American could not sit next to or across from a Caucasian passenger, but there were no designated &quot;black&quot; or &quot;white&quot; seats on the bus. When a white couple boarded the bus at a stop in Middlesex County, Virginia, the bus driver ordered Morgan and her seatmate to surrender their seats. Her seatmate immediately retreated to the back of the bus with her infant, but Morgan refused to give up her spot. When Morgan would not move, the bus driver got off the bus to find a sheriff. The sheriff presented Morgan with an arrest warrant, but she tore up the piece of paper and threw it out of the window of the bus. When the sheriff touched her to pull her out of her seat, she kicked him in the groin. The sheriff got off the bus and a different sheriff was sent on. &quot;He touched me, that&#x27;s when I kicked him in a very bad place. He hobbled off, and another one came on. I was going to bite him, but he looked dirty, so I clawed him instead. I ripped his shirt. We were both pulling at each other. He said he would use his nightstick. I said, &#x27;We&#x27;ll whip each other&#x27;&quot;. The second sheriff got off the bus to grab the deputy.

Morgan was arrested. She had been charged with resisting arrest and violating Virginia&#x27;s Jim Crow transit law. On October 18, 1944, Morgan attended her court case. She agreed to pay a $100 fine for resisting arrest but refused to plead to the segregation violation. Since Maryland did not enforce segregation for interstate travel, Virginia&#x27;s Jim Crow law could possibly not apply to Morgan. Morgan&#x27;s case, with the help of the NAACP, was taken to the Virginia Supreme Court. The supreme court ruled her in violation of the law. Morgan then took her case to the U.S. Supreme Court and won.

== U.S. Supreme Court case ==
Her case, &quot;Irene Morgan v. Commonwealth of Virginia&quot;, , was argued by William H. Hastie, the former governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands and later a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Thurgood Marshall of the NAACP was co-counsel. He later was appointed as a US Supreme Court justice.

The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6–1 in 1946 that Virginia&#x27;s state law enforcing segregation on interstate buses was unconstitutional. Hastie and Marshall used an innovative strategy to brief and argue the case. Instead of relying upon the Equal Protection clause of the 14th Amendment, they argued successfully that segregation on interstate travel violated the Interstate Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution.

&quot;If something happens to you which is wrong, the best thing to do is have it corrected in the best way you can,&quot; said Morgan. &quot;The best thing for me to do was to go to the Supreme Court.&quot;

In 1960, in &quot;Boynton v. Virginia&quot;, the Supreme Court extended the &quot;Morgan&quot; ruling to bus terminals used in interstate bus service. African Americans continued to be ejected or arrested when they tried to integrate such facilities, as Southern states refused to obey &quot;Morgan v. Virginia.&quot; They staged numerous non-violent demonstrations using interstate buses and bus terminals, such as the Freedom Rides of 1961. White Southerners attacked the Freedom Riders, attracting renewed national media attention to the South&#x27;s Jim Crow system.

== Journey of Reconciliation ==
Morgan&#x27;s case inspired the 1947 Journey of Reconciliation, during which 16 activists from the Chicago-based Congress of Racial Equality rode on interstate buses through the Upper South to test the enforcement of the Supreme Court ruling. The activists divided themselves between the interstate Greyhound and Trailways bus lines. They usually placed an interracial pair in the white-area of the bus. Other activists, disguised as ordinary passengers, rode in the racial sections &quot;reserved&quot; for them by segregation law.

The group traveled uneventfully through Virginia, but when they reached North Carolina, they encountered arrests and violence. By the end of the Journey, the protesters had conducted over 24 &quot;tests,&quot; and endured 12 arrests and dangerous mob violence. In a flagrant violation of the &quot;Morgan&quot; decision, North Carolina police arrested the civil rights activist Bayard Rustin. A jury convicted him and he was sentenced to 22 days on a chain gang for violating the state&#x27;s segregation laws, although he had been riding on an interstate bus.

The 1947 Journey of Reconciliation, ahead of its time in the use of tactics of nonviolent direct action, inspired the highly publicized Freedom Rides of 1961, also organized by CORE.

<doc id="489904" wikidata="Q1342987" url="?curid=489904" title="Soundtrack to Your Escape">
<text>Soundtrack to Your Escape is the seventh studio album by Swedish heavy metal band In Flames, released on 29 March 2004.

The album was criticized by longtime fans because of a major change in musical style. However, the album was seen by many as a natural progression from &quot;Reroute to Remain&quot; and was critically praised by critics such as Metal Hammer and Kerrang!. It reached number 3 in Sweden, number 45 on the American Billboard 200 chart (the band&#x27;s first album to reach the Billboard 200), number 2 on the Top Heatseekers chart, and number 7 on the Independent Albums chart. This would mark the first album where the band would exclusively use drop A# tuning and abandoning the C standard tuning of previous albums.

==Releases==
The album is available in both a regular jewel case version featuring 12 tracks and a limited edition digipak with a bonus track, &quot;Discover Me Like Emptiness&quot;. The Japanese version has an additional live track called &quot;Clayman&quot;.

A special edition, which includes a bonus DVD with live footage and videos of the singles &quot;The Quiet Place&quot; and &quot;Touch of Red&quot;, was also released. Music videos were produced for the songs &quot;My Sweet Shadow&quot;, &quot;Like You Better Dead&quot;, &quot;Borders and Shading&quot; and &quot;F(r)iend&quot;.

<doc id="489905" wikidata="Q191414" url="?curid=489905" title="Lenin's Mausoleum">
<text>Lenin&#x27;s Mausoleum (from 1953 to 1961 Lenin&#x27;s and Stalin&#x27;s Mausoleum) (), also known as Lenin&#x27;s Tomb, is a mausoleum located at Red Square in Moscow, Russia. It serves as the resting place of Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin, whose preserved body has been on public display since shortly after his death in 1924, with rare exceptions in wartime. The outdoor tribune over the mausoleum&#x27;s entrance was used by Soviet leaders to observe military parades. The structure, designed by Alexey Shchusev, incorporates some elements from ancient mausoleums such as the Step Pyramid, the Tomb of Cyrus the Great and, to some degree, the Temple of the Inscriptions.

==History==
Two days after Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s death on 21 January 1924, architect Alexey Shchusev was tasked with building a structure suitable for viewing of the body by mourners. A wooden tomb, built in Red Square close to the Moscow Kremlin Wall, was ready on 27 January, the same day Lenin&#x27;s coffin was placed inside. More than 100,000 Soviet citizens visited the tomb in the next six weeks. By the end of May, Shchusev had replaced the tomb with a larger, more elaborate mausoleum, and Lenin&#x27;s body was transferred to a sarcophagus designed by architect Konstantin Melnikov. The new wooden mausoleum was opened to the public on 1 August 1924.

Pathologist Alexei Ivanovich Abrikosov had embalmed Lenin&#x27;s body shortly after his death, with Boris Zbarsky and Vladimir Vorobiev later being tasked with its ongoing preservation. Zbarsky was soon assisted by his son Ilya Zbarsky, a recent graduate of Moscow University, who likened the work on Lenin&#x27;s body to that of ancient Egyptian priests. In 1925, Boris Zbarsky and Vorobiev urged the Soviet government to replace the wooden structure after mold was found in the walls and even on the body itself. A new mausoleum of marble, porphyry, granite, and labradorite, designed by Shchusev, was completed in 1930. The mausoleum also served as a viewing stand for Soviet leaders to review military parades on Red Square.

Lenin&#x27;s body has been on almost continuous public display inside the mausoleum since its completion in 1930. In October 1941, during the Second World War, known in Russia as the Great Patriotic War, when it appeared that Moscow might be captured, the body was evacuated to Tyumen in Siberia. After the war the body was returned and the tomb was re-opened. Between 1953 and 1961, the embalmed body of Joseph Stalin shared a spot next to Lenin&#x27;s; Stalin&#x27;s body was eventually removed as part of de-Stalinization and Khrushchev&#x27;s Thaw, and buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis. Soviet sculptor Nikolai Tomsky designed a new sarcophagus for Lenin&#x27;s body in 1973.

On 26 January 1924, the head of the Moscow Garrison issued an order to place the guard of honour, popularly known as the &quot;Number One Sentry&quot;, at the mausoleum. The guard of honour was disbanded following the Russian constitutional crisis of 1993, but was restored at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Alexander Garden four years later.

== Architectural features ==
=== Project selection and construction ===
In January 1925, the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee announced an international competition to design a stone tomb for Lenin&#x27;s body. The commission received 117 suggestions and sketches. Among them, there were offered different variants: a ship with Lenin&#x27;s figure on board, a round mausoleum in a shape of a globe, an analogue of an Egyptian pyramid and a mausoleum in a shape of the five-pointed star. But after considering the proposed designs, the commission decided to retain the image of a wooden mausoleum. Shchusev created some new drawings based on old sketches and made a model in granite, and his project was approved. It was decided to clad the new building with red granite, as well as black and grey labradorite.

The basement under the sarcophagus weighed twenty tonnes. It was installed on a thick layer of sand, and guarding pilesmeant to protect the tomb from vibrationwere driven around the slab. Altogether 2900 m2 of polished granite was required for the construction, each square metre of which was processed for three days on average. The upper slab of red Karelian Shoksha quartzite was placed on columns of granite, whose different species were specially brought to Moscow from all the republics of the USSR.

The stone mausoleum was completed October 1930, after sixteen months of construction. Compared to the previous wooden mausoleum, the new building was built three metres higher, the outer volume was increased 4.5 times – 5800 m³, and the inner volume 12 times, up to 2400 m³. Its total weight was about 10,000 tonnes. The mausoleum occupied the highest point on Red Square.

During construction, both the mausoleum and the necropolis were brought to a unified architectural design: differently characterised tombstones and monuments were removed, individual and collective burials at Nikolskaya and Spasskaya Towers were united, and the fence was redesigned and installed. Guest stands for ten thousand seats were installed on either side of the mausoleum.

=== Interiors ===
The mausoleum contains a vestibule, Mourning Hall and two staircases. Opposite the entrance is a huge granite block bearing the State Emblem of the Soviet Union.

Two staircases lead down from the vestibule. The left-hand staircase, measuring three meters wide, takes visitors down to the Funeral Hall. The walls of the descent are of grey labradorite. The Funeral Hall is a ten-meter cube with a stepped ceiling. A band of black labradorite runs across the entire room, on which pilasters of red porphyry are placed. Next to the pilasters are bands of bright red smalt, to the right of which are bands of black labradorite. This combination creates the effect of flames and banners flying in the wind. In the centre of the hall is a black pedestal with a sarcophagus.

The upper stepped slab of the sarcophagus is supported by four inconspicuous metal columns, which gives the impression that the slab is hanging in the air. The lower slab is covered in reddish jasper. The sarcophagus is made up of two inclined conical glasses, which are held together by a bronze frame. Illuminators and light filters are embedded in the upper part of the frame, giving an animating pink coloring and reducing heat. On either side of the sarcophagus are the battle and labour bronze banners, which appear satiny due to the special illumination. In the headboard is the Soviet State Emblem framed by oak and laurel branches. At the foot, there are branches twisted with ribbon. 

The exit from the Funeral Hall to the right-hand staircase leads back to Red Square.

== Preserving the body ==

One of the main problems the embalmers faced was the appearance of dark spots on Lenin&#x27;s body, especially on the face and hands. They managed to solve the problem by the use of a variety of different reagents. While working on ways to preserve the body, Boris Zbarsky invented a new way to purify medical chloroform used for preservation. For example, if a patch of wrinkling or discoloration occurred, it was treated with a solution of acetic acid and ethyl alcohol diluted with water. Hydrogen peroxide could be used to restore the tissues&#x27; original coloring. Damp spots were removed by means of disinfectants such as quinine or phenol. Lenin&#x27;s remains are soaked in a solution of glycerol and potassium acetate on a yearly basis. Synthetic eyeballs were placed in Lenin&#x27;s orbital cavities to prevent his eye sockets from collapsing.

Until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the continued preservation work was funded by the Soviet government. After 1991, the government discontinued financial support, after which the mausoleum was funded by private donations. In 2016 the Russian government reversed its earlier decision and announced it would spend 13 million rubles to preserve Lenin&#x27;s body.

==Contemporary==

Lenin&#x27;s Mausoleum is open to the public on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays from 10:00–13:00. Entrance is free of charge. Visitors are required to show respect whilst inside the tomb: photography and filming inside the mausoleum are forbidden, as is talking, smoking, keeping hands in pockets or (unless female) wearing hats.

Lenin&#x27;s Mausoleum has undergone several changes in appearance since the collapse of the Soviet Union. One of the first noticeable was the placement of gates at the staircases leading to the tribune. After the removal of the guard, this was necessary to prevent unauthorised usage of the tribune. Beginning in 2012, the mausoleum underwent foundation reconstruction, necessitated by the construction of a building attached to the mausoleum in 1983. The new building housed an escalator used by members of the Politburo to ascend the tribune. In 1995–96, when Yeltsin used the tribune, he used the staircase and not the escalator. The escalator was removed after the tribune became disused. Following renovations, the mausoleum was reopened on 30 April 2013, in time for the 1 May celebration of &quot;The Day of Spring and Labour&quot;.

==Proposals for burial==

Since 1991 there has been discussion about moving Lenin&#x27;s body to the Kremlin Wall Necropolis. Russian President Boris Yeltsin, with the support of the Russian Orthodox Church, intended to close the mausoleum and bury Lenin next to his mother, Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova, at the Volkov Cemetery in St. Petersburg. Yeltsin&#x27;s successor, Vladimir Putin, opposed this. On 24 July 2001, he stated:
In 2009, Vladimir Medinsky, a State Duma deputy from United Russia, noted that there was no point in keeping Lenin&#x27;s body in the mausoleum:
On 20 April 2017, deputies from the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia and United Russia proposed for consideration a bill on the burial of Lenin&#x27;s body, which proposed to establish a procedure for the burial of historical figures. The very fact of the need for burial was considered established, but specific dates were not specified:
The absence of specific deadlines would allow the bill to be applied whenever the public would be ready to bury Lenin&#x27;s body. After discussing and criticizing the bill, United Russia deputies withdrew their signatures. The government did not support the bill. The provisions of the bill allow for burials without taking into account the will of the deceased and at the expense of the federal budget, but the sources of funding have not been identified, which makes it difficult to assess the financial consequences of the adoption of this law.

In 2018, RIA Novosti reported that Vladimir Petrov, a member of the legislative assembly of Leningrad Oblast, proposed creating a special commission in order to examine the question of the removal of Lenin&#x27;s body from the mausoleum. Petrov seemed to be willing to replace the corpse with a copy made of synthetic resin. 

In November 2018, Sergey Malinkovich, the central committee secretary of the Communists of Russia political party, called for the criminal prosecution of Vladimir Petrov for insulting religious believers by calling for Lenin&#x27;s preserved body to be buried. He said Petrov&#x27;s proposal had violated the Criminal Code of Russia by insulting religious feelings and inciting hatred, and that he planned to &quot;keep hounding&quot; Petrov for his remarks.

<text>Finntroll is a Finnish metal band from Helsinki that combines elements of black metal and folk metal. Finntroll&#x27;s lyrics are mostly in Swedish, the only exception being the song &quot;Madon Laulu&quot; on &quot;Visor om slutet&quot;. Finntroll&#x27;s original singer, Katla, decided to use Swedish over Finnish since he was part of a Swedish-speaking minority in Finland and the sound of the language seemed to better suit the band&#x27;s &quot;trollish&quot; outfit. Despite several vocalist changes, this tradition has continued.

According to band members Vreth and Skrymer, they took their name from an old Finnish legend where Swedish priests coming to Finland had an encounter with a wild-looking man who killed most of their party. The survivors came back bearing the tale of the Finn-Troll.

Finntroll&#x27;s lyrics mainly deal with legends and tales revolving around the fictional troll-king &quot;Rivfader&quot; and the trolls fighting against the Christians who entered their lands and spread their beliefs. A recurring theme is the story of two priests named &quot;Aamund&quot; and &quot;Kettil&quot;: the first three full-length albums feature a rather short but fierce song about the two men who constantly get themselves into trouble with the trolls, only to get beaten up and mutilated over and over again by the wrathful followers of Rivfader.

To date, the band&#x27;s discography includes seven full-length albums, a live album and three EPs. Their newest studio album &quot;Vredesvävd&quot; was released in 2020.

== History == 

Finntroll was founded in 1997 with a line-up which included guitarist Teemu &quot;Somnium&quot; Raimoranta and vocalist/lyricist Jan &quot;Katla&quot; Jämsen. A year later they were joined by guitarist Samuli &quot;Skrymer&quot; Ponsimaa, drummer Samu &quot;Beast Dominator&quot; Ruotsalainen, keyboardist Henri &quot;Trollhorn&quot; Sorvali and bassist Sami &quot;Tundra&quot; Uusitalo, creating the first stable line-up of the band. The band&#x27;s first demo, &quot;Rivfader&quot;, released the same year.

Their second album, &quot;Jaktens Tid&quot;, was released in 2001. The following summer, the band had their first time playing festivals in Finland and other countries. The album features yoiking by then Shaman vocalist Jonne Järvelä, later known as vocalist and guitarist for fellow folk metal band Korpiklaani.

The year after the release of the album &quot;Jaktens Tid&quot; proved to be a misfortune for Finntroll: some tours had to be cancelled, and vocalist Jämsen had to retire from the band due to a viral-based tumor in his vocal cords which could not be removed surgically; he retired after the release of the EP &quot;Visor om slutet&quot;. The EP was recorded in early January 2003, in a forest cabin near Helsinki. It was an &quot;acoustical experiment&quot;, where Jämsen and the new vocalist Tapio Wilska (of Sethian and Lyijykomppania) shared the singing duties among them. &quot;Visor om slutet&quot; was released as a mid-price EP and held rank on the Finnish midprice chart for several weeks.

On 16 March 2003, shortly before the release of &quot;Visor om slutet&quot;, guitarist Teemu Raimoranta died when he fell off a bridge in Hakaniemi, Helsinki. Although they had lost their last remaining founding members in this tragic event, the band did not dissolve, but after some time decided to go on, touring Europe for two weeks, supported by the band Katatonia. Guitarist Mikael Karlbom was hired as a replacement for Raimoranta.

In 2004, the band released an EP, &quot;Trollhammaren&quot; &quot;(&quot;The Trollhammer&quot;)&quot;, a prequel to the soon to follow album &quot;Nattfödd&quot; &quot;(&quot;Nightborn&quot;)&quot;. Also in 2004, Trollhorn stopped touring with the band, prompting touring musicians to be hired to fill the void left in his absence. Aleksi &quot;Virta&quot; Virta joined the band in an official capacity as second keyboardist in 2005.

On 29 January 2006, Tapio Wilska, vocalist of the band since 2003, was fired from the band. In a statement issued on the band&#x27;s website, Wilska stated that he would like to keep the reason for his dismissal private.

Following Wilska&#x27;s parting with the band, they decided to take on Mathias &quot;Vreth&quot; Lillmåns of Chthonian and Twilight Moon as a full-time member on vocals.

A new album, titled &quot;Ur jordens djup&quot; &quot;(&quot;From the Depths of the Earth&quot;)&quot;, was released March 2007. This fourth album put more emphasis on epic keyboard riffs with very loud but melodic guitar. Former vocalist Katla was brought in to write the lyrics for this album, and continues in this capacity with the band. The last song contains an acoustic hidden track entitled &quot;Trollvisan&quot; which can be heard at 11:03 minutes. It is commonly believed to be the installment&#x27;s &quot;Aamund och Kettil song&quot;, yet there is no mention of the two priests in the lyrics, the song rather refers to &quot;de kristna&quot; (&quot;the Christians&quot;) in general.

The band has recorded a live performance for its upcoming first live DVD. A release date is yet to be confirmed. They have released their fifth album, titled &quot;Nifelvind&quot; &quot;(&quot;Underworld&#x27;s Winds&quot;)&quot;, and Katla has again written the lyrics. The progress on the album was recorded by Trollhorn in a studio diary. On 15 January 2010 Finntroll released a music video for the new song &quot;Solsagan&quot; on their &quot;MySpace&quot; page in preparation for the album release. The new album was then released in February 2010.

The band&#x27;s sixth studio album Blodsvept was released on 25 March 2013.

On 13 May 2014, drummer Samu Ruotsalainen revealed that he would be departing the band in July of that year; the parting was confirmed to be amicable by the band. He was replaced by Heikki &quot;Mörkö&quot; Saari.

In June 2014, the band released a live album, &quot;Natten med de Levande Finntroll&quot; (&quot;Night of the Living Finntroll&quot;). Thomas Woroniak of RockRevolt Magazine stated &quot;&quot;Natten Med De Levande Finntroll&quot; is a must-have for any dedicated Finntroll fan. Followers of the group have been waiting a long time for a live recording...the music is unique and vibrant in color and tonality, and the performance is exceptional.&quot;

On 25 June 2020, the band announced that their next album, titled &quot;Vredesvävd&quot;, would be released on 18 September.

<text>Donatella Francesca Versace (; born 2 May 1955), sometimes simply referred to mononymously as Donatella, is an Italian fashion designer, businesswoman, socialite, and model. She is the sister of Gianni Versace, founder of the luxury fashion company Versace, with whom she worked closely on the development of the brand and in particular its combining of Italian luxury with pop culture and celebrity. 

Upon Gianni&#x27;s death in 1997, she inherited a portion of the Versace brand and became its creative director. She is currently the brand&#x27;s chief creative officer. Along with her brother Gianni, she is widely credited for the supermodel phenomenon of the 1990s by casting editorial models on the runway.

==Early life and education==
Donatella Versace was born in Reggio di Calabria, Italy, the youngest of four children; Santo, Gianni, and Tina. Her father, Antonio Versace, helped run the family coal mining business, and her mother, Francesca Versace (née Olandese), was a seamstress for a fashion company before setting up her own fashion boutique. Her older sister, Tina, died at the age of 12 from an improperly treated tetanus infection. Always close to her brother Gianni, Donatella was persuaded by him to dye her hair blonde at 11 years old in honor of the Italian singer Patty Pravo, of whom he was a big fan.

In the mid-1970s, Donatella studied literature and languages in Florence. On the weekends, she would commute to Milan to work with Gianni, who was working at the Callaghan fashion label. Donatella&#x27;s mother did not approve, wanting her to focus instead on her studies, and would check up on Donatella with surprise visits to Florence.

==Career==
Donatella was only ever interested in a career in the fashion and model industry, stating; &quot;I knew I was going to work in fashion; I really didn&#x27;t think of nothing else.&quot; In 1976, Donatella and Santo joined their brother Gianni in Milan. The three travelled to the United States in 1977 on a three-week tour in search of press and overseas buyers in anticipation of starting the Versace brand.

The Versace brand was established in 1978, with Donatella employed as vice president, although she collaborated with Gianni across all projects, especially in styling, creating the brand image, and designing the brand&#x27;s accessories, shoes, and handbags. In 1982, Gianni sent Donatella to an auction where she placed the winning bid on the palazzo at Via Gesù 12 in Milan which would become the Versace headquarters and showroom.

Donatella is widely considered to have been both a creative partner and muse to Gianni. In 1989, Gianni dedicated the new Blonde perfume to Donatella, and entrusted the Versus diffusion line to her – gifting her a yellow diamond ring to mark the occasion. During 1996 and early 1997, with Gianni Versace recovering from a cancer of the left ear, Donatella took over much of the decision-making for the Versace brand.

Versace has described her approach to design as being rooted in images, saying &quot;I don&#x27;t look at the clothes with my eyes, I look through images – a picture, or a video.&quot; She is often cited with developing the Versace look. Donatella worked with fashion photographer Richard Avedon on the Spring-Summer 1980 campaign shoot, his first for the brand, and would art direct Avedon on the Spring-Summer 1993 campaign.

Gianni was murdered on 15 July 1997, outside the re-constructed Casa Casuarina, also known as Versace Mansion, in Miami, Florida. In the aftermath of the highly publicized crime and manhunt, most of the Versace family, including Donatella, moved temporarily to a secluded private resort in the Caribbean. Her brother, Santo Versace, inherited 30% of Versace upon Gianni&#x27;s death and her daughter, Allegra Versace, inherited 50%. Gianni Versace&#x27;s book The Art of Being You, published posthumously in 1997, includes a dedication to Gianni from Donatella and Santo which reads &quot;This book is a tribute to a great artist himself, to someone who lived with an incredible love for art, to a very special person who was always fascinated by art and artists and always supported them, our brother Gianni&quot;.

On 18 July 1998, one year and three days after Gianni&#x27;s death, Donatella Versace mounted her first haute couture show for the Versace Atelier at the Hôtel Ritz Paris. She built her runway over the hotel&#x27;s swimming pool, as her brother had done every season, though this time using sheer glass. From October 2002 to January 2003, Gianni and Donatella&#x27;s best known Versace clothing was displayed in a special exhibit of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

Donatella has designed advertising campaigns for Versace that included Madonna, Courtney Love, Christina Aguilera, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Demi Moore, Nicki Minaj, Lady Gaga, Beyoncé and January Jones. She designed the Green Versace dress of Jennifer Lopez, also known as the &quot;Jungle-Dress&quot;, which was worn by Lopez at the 42nd Grammy Awards in 2000. In 2015, she appeared in the AW15 ad campaign of its direct competitor Givenchy.

Donatella designed the Palazzo Versace Australia resort on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia, which opened in September 2000, and played a major role in the design of the Palazzo Versace Dubai, the second Palazzo Versace hotel, which opened in November 2016. She also designed a Mini Cooper for the Life Ball. In September 2017, Donatella Versace set up a tribute show dedicated to her brother.

Versace and her former husband, American model Paul Beck have two children: daughter Allegra Versace Beck (born 30 June 1986), and son Daniel Versace Beck (born 1989). Her marriage with Paul Beck ended in 2000.

She fought a cocaine addiction for 18 years until 2005. A heavy smoker, she quit in 2014.

==Philanthropy==
Versace has been involved in several charitable causes. In 1993, Donatella and Gianni Versace published the book &quot;South Beach Stories&quot; and donated all proceeds to ANLAIDS. She continues to be a patron of the Elton John AIDS Foundation.

Alongside supermodel Naomi Campbell, in 1998 Versace organized a benefit fashion show in support of the Nelson Mandela Children&#x27;s Fund, raising thousands of dollars for the charity. In the same year, Versace staged a charity fashion show during the Fire &amp; Ice Ball in California to raise funds for the Revlon/UCLA Women&#x27;s Cancer Research Program. The ball raised $1.8million for the charity. 
In 2008, Versace staged its first fashion show in China as part of a charity fund-raiser auction and dinner as part of a yearlong partnership in benefit of the Jet Li One Foundation to open children&#x27;s centers for post-trauma and psychological relief in China&#x27;s Sichuan province, following an earthquake in the region. As part of the collaboration, Donatella designed a Versace/One Foundation logo and limited-edition merchandise.

In 2010, Versace contributed £20,000 to the 20:20 Fashion Fund of the London fashion college, Central Saint Martins, with funds going towards new equipment for the college.

In 2021, £200,000 were donated by Donatella and her daughter to help during the pandemic of COVID-19. The donation went to the San Raffaele Hospital&#x27;s intensive care in Milan, Italy.

==In popular culture==
Versace made a cameo appearance in &quot;Zoolander&quot;. In &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot;, her name was mentioned sporadically.

At the 42nd Grammy Awards (2000), Jennifer Lopez wore the Green Jungle Dress, which became an international point of attention, being highly publicised in the media. It was designed by Versace herself and Lopez has the original dress currently with her at her estate. The dress worn by Lopez remains the reason for the creation of Google Images, and is known to have been downloaded over 600,000 times within 24 hours of the Grammy&#x27;s night. In 2019, Lopez wore the dress for the first time since 2001 for the Versace Milan Fashion Show.

Versace was parodied several times by Maya Rudolph on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

In the ABC series &quot;Ugly Betty&quot;, a fictional character called Fabia, played by actress Gina Gershon, is a parody of Versace. Gershon also played Versace as the lead role in the Lifetime television film &quot;House of Versace&quot;, released in 2013.

Lady Gaga wrote the song &quot;Donatella&quot; from her album &quot;Artpop&quot; (2013) for her.

The plot of season 2 of the television series &quot;American Crime Story&quot; recounts the murder of Donatella&#x27;s brother Gianni. She is portrayed by Penélope Cruz. She criticized the authenticity of the TV series, stating that she was with Madonna when the murder occurred, a moment that is not in the pictures.

In 2022, Versace took part in an onstage skit alongside musicians Dua Lipa and Megan Thee Stallion at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards. Dua and Megan came to the stage in matching black floor-length gowns before Versace joined them on the stage and unclipped a part of each dress to reveal different looks. The moment was a tribute to a skit between Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston at the 1998 VMAs. Also in 2022, Donatella&#x27;s team assisted with making Cardi B&#x27;s shiny gold chain outfit for the Met Gala. This dress took around 20 people to make, with each chain being hand embroidered. 

In 2023, Versace designed a strapless safety pin dress with white tweed, pearl accents and camellia flower details which was worn by Anne Hathaway at the Met Gala. 

The character Donatello Versus in &quot;Stone Ocean&quot;, Part 6 of the &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot; manga, is named after her.

<text>The Circle Line (CCL) is a medium-capacity Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) line in Singapore. It runs in a loop from Dhoby Ghaut station in the city-centre to HarbourFront station in the south via Bishan station in the centre of the country. It also has a branch from Promenade station to Marina Bay station, which will be extended to HarbourFront station from the first half of 2026 (when Stage 6 commences operation) to form a complete loop. Coloured orange on the rail map, the fully-underground line is approximately long with 30 stations. Travelling from one end of the line to the other takes about an hour.

The line was the fourth MRT line to be opened on the network, with the first stage, from Bartley to Marymount station, commencing operations on 28 May 2009. The next stage to Dhoby Ghaut was completed on 17 April 2010 and the next stage to HarbourFront opened on 8 October 2011. A two-station extension to Marina Bay station was opened on 14 January 2012. The last stage of the line from HarbourFront to Marina Bay with stations at Keppel, Cantonment, and Prince Edward Road will be completed in 2026, completing the loop.

It is the second line in Singapore after the North East Line to be completely automated and driverless and is among the world&#x27;s longest driverless rapid transit lines. It is also the first medium capacity line in Singapore, with each Circle Line train, the Alstom Metropolis C830 and C830C, having a three-car configuration.

==History==

===Original plans===
The Circle Line dates back to 1989, when then-Minister for Communications and Information, Yeo Ning Hong, stated that such a system would be &quot;feasible when the population reaches four million&quot;, noting the slow population growth and demand.

Feasibility studies for the proposed line commenced on 11 October 1994. The line, then named the Marina Line, was first announced on 16 October 1997. The line would serve Marina Centre and the new downtown at Marina South, with multiple branches to Chinatown and Dhoby Ghaut via the National Stadium to either Kallang or Paya Lebar stations. The line was planned to have 18 stations, with a possible extension to Tanjong Pagar station. Plans for the line were confirmed and approved by the government on 12 June 1998. However, due to the high costs and lack of development in Marina South, the Chinatown branch was later removed in November 1999 and the line was reduced to 6 stations from the Dhoby Ghaut to Stadium stations. A part of the removed leg later became part of the Downtown Line. On the other hand, a further extension towards Upper Paya Lebar was announced on 28 April 2001.

The Marina Line was eventually merged with a planned Light Rail Transit line that went from Paya Lebar to Buona Vista via Serangoon and Bishan to form Circle Line Stage 3 on 20 January 2003, and subsequently Circle Line Stage 4 and 5 on 12 December 2003 when Stage 4 was extended from Buona Vista to World Trade Centre to close up the link and to provide connectivity from the west to Sentosa, becoming the Circle Line. On 8 August 2001, SMRT won the bid and was appointed the operator of the Circle Line. Names for the stations for the first three stages of the Circle Line were finalised in July 2005 after the Land Transport Authority (LTA) conducted a public consultation exercise on the naming of stations. In November 2005, the names of the stations in Stages 4 and 5 were finalised.

===Construction of the initial stages===
Construction started on 13 March 2002 for Stage 1, 5 September 2002 for Stage 2, May 2003 for Stage 3, and January 2005 for Stages 4 and 5. Initially planned to be opened in stages from 2006 to 2010, at an estimated cost of S$6.7 billion, the Nicoll Highway collapse delayed the opening of the first stage to 2009. When the line fully opened on 8 October 2011, the cost of construction had risen to nearly S$10 billion. Due to the collapse, the station was relocated to a new site two-thirds the size of the original away. Three stations on the Circle Line were initially designed as &#x27;shell stations&#x27;, but the decision was made to open two of them, Caldecott and Haw Par Villa (previously Thomson and West Coast respectively), leaving Bukit Brown as the only unopened station on the line.

The first section of the line, Stage 3, a five-station segment stretching from Bartley to Marymount, opened on 28 May 2009. Initial ridership on this section was lower than estimated, at 32,000 passengers per day (ppd) instead of the estimated 55,000 ppd. Tunneling works for the entire line were completed on 17 August 2009. Stages 1 and 2 started operations on 17 April 2010, followed by Stages 4 and 5 (from the Marymount to HarbourFront stations) on 8 October 2011. A two-station extension to Marina Bay opened on 14 January 2012.
===Circle Line stage 6===
On 17 January 2013, then-Minister for Transport, Lui Tuck Yew, announced Circle Line Stage 6 which would &quot;close the circle&quot;, set to be completed by 2025. The 4 km extension will run between Marina Bay and HarbourFront. The extension will connect commuters between the HarbourFront to Marina Bay stations and expand the rail network to the southern edge of the Central Business District. On 29 October 2015, LTA announced the station locations for Stage 6, with the working names of the stations being Keppel, Cantonment, and Prince Edward. Tenders were called for construction between 2016 and 2017.

On 15 May 2017, the LTA invited the public to send in suggestions for names of the three MRT stations or propose to keep their current names. The Keppel and Cantonment stations kept their names, while Prince Edward station was changed to Prince Edward Road station.

Construction of Stage 6 commenced in late 2017. A joint venture – by China State Construction Engineering (The Singapore branch) and Nishimatsu Construction – won the contract to build the new Keppel station and its associated tunnels.

Stage 6 of the line is now expected to be completed by 2026 instead due to delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Tunnelling works for the CCL6 were completed on 12 January 2022, with a final tunnel breakthrough from Prince Edward Road station into Cantonment station. The tunnels between Cantonment station and the adjacent Prince Edward Road station were constructed only below the former Tanjong Pagar Railway Station. Prior to the tunnelling works, an extensive survey was conducted to ensure that the tunnels do not cross through the building&#x27;s foundations. Structures were erected to protect the railway station&#x27;s facade and interior, and monitoring instruments were installed to watch out for any building settlement. To construct the tunnels to Keppel station, the Keppel viaduct had to be closely monitored while underpinning the viaduct with new micro piles. Three bored piles were removed for the tunnelling works.

On 6 December 2024, it was announced that Stage 6 will commence operation in the first half of 2026.

==Incidents==

===Nicoll Highway collapse===

On 20 April 2004, a section of the tunnel being built for the Circle Line collapsed, when a retaining wall used in the tunnel&#x27;s construction gave way. This incident occurred near the proposed site of the Nicoll Highway station, not far from the Merdeka Bridge. The accident left a collapse zone that was wide, long, and deep. Four workers were killed, and three were injured.

A criminal inquiry found the main contractor Nishimatsu Construction Company and joint venture partner firm Lum Chang Construction Company and their officers, as well as key Land Transport Authority officers responsible for the collapse. Several other officers and subcontractors were reprimanded and issued warnings in connection with the accident.

As a result of this accident, the first phase of the Circle Line, previously scheduled to open in 2008, was completed in 2009 instead. The affected station has been shifted about away from the accident site and is now located at Republic Avenue.

This accident also resulted in stricter safety regulations for the construction of all future MRT lines. The shifting of the Nicoll Highway station also meant it can no longer serve as a terminus for the Bukit Timah Line, partially influencing the creation of the current Downtown line.

===Other incidents===
On 16 August 2007, the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) issued a stop-work order and revoked the contractor&#x27;s tunnelling permit after a stretch of two lanes close to the junction of Telok Blangah Road and Alexandra Road sank about that evening.

A section of the road above a construction site near Holland Road caved in on the morning of 24 May 2008, creating a hole. The hole, directly in front of two private houses along Cornwall Gardens, measured 8 by 7 metres and was 3 metres deep. No one was injured, but the road was temporarily closed to traffic.

===Line disruptions===
On 20 September 2011, a power fault disrupted train services at all 16 stations on the Circle Line. The four-hour delay left thousands of commuters stranded during rush-hour. It was reported that leaks and a damaged electrical cable along the Circle Line were the cause of the disruption. The disruption started at about 5.30am. Train services were gradually restored from 8am and all services were restored just before 10am. Dakota and Mountbatten stations were the last two to resume operations. Investigations were carried out, and the fault was traced back to a faulty cable beneath the platform level at Dakota station. 27,000 passengers were affected by the disruption during the four hour delay, with bus bridging services plying the Circle Line route.

In late August 2016, intermittent signal interference led to a five-day series of train disruptions. The issue reappeared in November. A team of data scientists explored the data and discovered via a Marey chart visualization that it was caused by hardware problems, sending errant signals from a &quot;rogue&quot; train, PV46.

On 30 September 2023, due to the discovery of a crack on the rails near Promenade station, delays of about 30 minutes occurred between Dhoby Ghaut, Marina Bay, and Stadium stations for 14 hours.

On 17 September 2024, at 5.50pm, a power outage on the Circle Line disrupted services along the entire line, with 11 trains stalled in the tunnels. Power was restored by 6.05pm, and SMRT staff had to manually drive the stalled trains to their next stations, causing delays of about 30 minutes. Normal train services fully resumed by 7.40pm. Investigations show that the disruption was first caused by a circuit breaker that tripped in the Traction Safety Shutdown System (TSSS) cubicle. After SMRT&#x27;s maintenance team reset the circuit breaker, they had concerns that the fault might reoccur and decided to replace the main circuit breaker that had also tripped. They powered down the TSSS cubicle as a safety precaution, but caused another circuit breaker to trip, which led to the loss of power on the entire line. The maintenance team had failed to seek clearance from the head of CCL operations before proceeding with the maintenance, and such maintenance work should have been done during engineering hours while trains were not running.

On 18 September 2024, at around 8pm, a fire in the Traction Safety Shutdown System (TSSS) cubicle was detected, triggering a power shutdown along the entire line as part of a safety feature. This comes one day after a power fault that affected the entire line as well. The fire was extinguished, and traction power was restored within 10 minutes. Full train services resumed at 8.15pm. After the incident, SMRT said that the procurement of a replacement TSSS cubicle with enhanced features, is being expedited. Systemic improvements will also be made, including enhancements to the Circle Line&#x27;s signalling and PA systems, as well as fail-safe and fail-soft features.

==Network and operations==

=== Network ===
The Circle Line is the second line in Singapore to be completely automated and driverless, following the North East line, and is among the world&#x27;s longest driverless rapid transit lines. It is also the first medium capacity line in Singapore.

===Route===
The Circle Line forms an incomplete loop from Dhoby Ghaut in the Central Region of Singapore, north to Serangoon and Bishan, and south to HarbourFront, with a branch from Promenade to Marina Bay station which will be extended to HarbourFront in 2026. The fully-underground circular route also makes several links with the other MRT lines. The line begins at Dhoby Ghaut station, which has an interchange with the North–South and North East lines, going eastwards and paralleling Bras Basah Road and Raffles Boulevard, before joining the Circle Line extension at Promenade station, which also interchanges with the Downtown line. From Promenade station, the line goes northwards and towards the east, passing beneath the Kallang Basin. Between the Stadium and Dakota stations, the line parallels Stadium Boulevard and Old Airport Road, then the line continues northwards and follows the route of Paya Lebar Road and Upper Paya Lebar Road between the Paya Lebar (which interchanges with the East–West Line) and Tai Seng stations.

The line curves and continues westwards between the Bartley and Marymount stations, also interchanging with the North East and North–South lines at Serangoon and Bishan stations respectively, and then it continues in a general southwest direction between Caldecott and Kent Ridge, the former having an interchange with the Thomson East-Coast line, passing through Bukit Brown Cemetery between the Caldecott and Botanic Gardens stations. The line also interchanges with the Downtown line at Botanic Gardens station and the East–West Line at Buona Vista station. After Kent Ridge station, the line curves eastwards, paralleling the West Coast Highway and then terminating at HarbourFront station, where it interchanges with the North East Line.

From 2026, upon the completion of Stage 6, the Circle Line will continue eastwards from HarbourFront, paralleling Keppel Road and Ayer Rajah Expressway, and joins the Circle Line extension at Marina Bay station. The Circle Line extension from Marina Bay to Promenade station generally parallels the Downtown Line and Bayfront Avenue, also passing underneath Marina Bay Sands at Bayfront station, which it serves and has cross-platform interchange with the Downtown Line.

===Stations===
Station codes for the line are orange, corresponding to the line&#x27;s colour on the system map. All stations have island platforms, with the exception of Promenade and future infill station Bukit Brown.

The Circle Line&#x27;s numbering scheme reserves station code &quot;CC18&quot; for future use.

===Depots===
==Rolling stock==
The rolling stock for the Circle Line uses electric multiple unit (EMU) trains operating in a three-car configuration, with four doors per side on each carriage and can accommodate of up to 931 passengers in each trainsets. It consists of 40 first-generation Alstom Metropolis trains were supplied under contract C830. They are built in France by Alstom between 2006 and 2008. They are stabled at Kim Chuan Depot, which was the world&#x27;s largest underground depot when it opened in 2009. To increase the capacity of the Circle Line, an additional 24 second-generation Alstom Metropolis trains were supplied under contract C830C, a similar in design to the first-generation trains, were delivered to Singapore from July 2014. They are also built in Shanghai, China by Alstom between 2014 and 2016. To facilitate the extension of the line with the construction of Stage 6, a tender for additional trains for the line was published on 31 March 2017. To increase the capacity of the Circle Line for Circle Line Stage 6, an additional 23 third-generation Alstom Metropolis trains were supplied under contract C851E with the first train set arrived in Singapore on 11 March 2022.

The automated CBTC system on board relies on &quot;continuous two-way digital communication&quot; between each controlled train and the control centre.

==Train control==
The Circle Line is equipped with Alstom Urbalis 300 Communications-based train control (CBTC) moving block signalling system on the MASTRIA system with Automatic train control (ATC) under Automatic train operation (ATO) GoA 4 (UTO). The subsystems consist of Automatic train protection (ATP) to govern train speed, Iconis Automatic Train Supervision (ATS) to track and schedule trains and Smartlock Computer-based interlocking (CBI) system that prevents incorrect signal and track points to be set.

Train Data Management System (TDMS) which concentrate and dispatch the rolling stock information with fixed equipment. The IAGO Waveguide communications network has the capability to transmit video and is almost maintenance-free. Base stations are located within the signalling equipment room.

Automatic platform screen doors supplied by Westinghouse provide safety for commuters, offering protection from arriving and departing trains.

<text>Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba (1 September 1453 – 2 December 1515) was a Spanish general and statesman. He led military campaigns during the Conquest of Granada and the Italian Wars, after which he served as Viceroy of Naples. For his extensive political and military success, he was made Duke of Santángelo (1497), Terranova (1502), Andría, Montalto and Sessa (1507), and earned the nickname El Gran Capitán (&quot;The Great Captain&quot;).

Held as one of the greatest generals in history, he became the first European to decisively employ firearms on the battlefield, and among the first to reorganize the infantry with pikes and firearms in effective defensive and offensive formations. He developed them as part of a combined arms doctrine including fields as disparate as cavalry, artillery, fortifications, guerrilla, siegecraft and diplomacy. The changes implemented by Fernández de Córdoba, which led to the formation of the &quot;tercios&quot;, were instrumental in making the Spanish army the dominant land force in Europe for over a century and a half. He has been credited with marking the transition between medieval and modern warfare.

Córdoba rose to international prestige during his career, maintaining active relationships not only with the crowns of Castile and Aragon, but also with France, the Papal States, the Italian city-states and the Holy Roman Empire, all of which sought out his services. Chronicler Jerónimo Zurita went to consider him &quot;...the most esteemed person that lived in these times, for such princes, either desired to have him for a friend, or were wary that he might become their enemy.&quot;

==Early life==
Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba was born on 1 September 1453 at Montilla in the province of Córdoba. He was the younger son of Pedro Fernández de Córdoba, Count of Aguilar (himself the son of 
Pedro Fernández de Córdoba, 1390–1424 and of Leonor de Arellano)
and of Elvira de Herrera (daughter of Pedro Núñez de Herrera y Guzmán, d. 1430, and Blanca Enríquez de Mendoza). In 1455, when Gonzalo was two years old, his father died. His older brother, Alonso, inherited all of their father&#x27;s estates, leaving Gonzalo to seek his own fortune. In 1467, Gonzalo was first attached to the household of Alfonso, Prince of Asturias, the half-brother of King Henry IV of Castile. After Alfonso died in 1468, Gonzalo devoted himself to Alfonso&#x27;s sister, Isabella of Castile.

When King Henry IV died in 1474, Isabella proclaimed herself a successor as queen, disputing the right of Juana la Beltraneja (the king&#x27;s 13-year-old daughter and her niece) to ascend the throne. During the ensuing civil war between the followers of Isabella and Juana, there was also conflict with Portugal since King Afonso V of Portugal sided with his niece Juana. Gonzalo fought for Isabella under Alonso de Cárdenas, grand master of the Order of Santiago. In 1479, he fought in the final against the Portuguese by leading 120 lancers. Cárdenas praised him for his service. When the war ended, Isabella and her husband Ferdinand were the rulers of Castile and Aragon.

==Conquest of Granada==

Once the Catholic Monarchs had consolidated their rule, they embarked in 1481 on a ten-year campaign to conquer Granada, the last remaining Muslim stronghold on the Iberian peninsula. Fernández de Córdoba was an active participant in the fighting and distinguished himself as a brave and competent military leader. He gained renown for participation in the sieges of several walled towns including Loja, Tajara, Illora, and Montefrío. At Montefrío he was reported to be the first attacker over the walls. In 1492, Fernández de Córdoba captured the city of Granada, bringing an end to the war. The skills of a military engineer and a guerilla fighter were equally useful. Because of his knowledge of Arabic and his familiarity with Boabdil, Gonzalo was chosen as one of the officers to arrange the surrender.

For his service he was rewarded with an Order of Santiago, an encomienda, the manor of Órgiva in Granada as well as silk production rights in the region.

==Italian campaigns==
Gonzalo was an important military commander during the Italian Wars, holding command twice and earning the name &quot;The Great Captain&quot;.

===First Italian War===

The Italian Wars began in 1494 when Charles VIII of France marched into Italy with 25,000 men to make good his claim to the Kingdom of Naples ruled by Ferdinand II, a cousin to Ferdinand of Aragon. The French easily overwhelmed the Neapolitan defenses and on 12 May 1495 Charles had himself crowned Emperor of Naples. The Catholic Monarchs were anxious to reverse French success in Naples and selected Fernández de Córdoba to lead an expeditionary force against Charles. Fernández de Córdoba landed in Naples shortly after Charles&#x27; coronation with a force of about 5,000 infantry and 600 light cavalry. Fearful of being trapped in Italy, Charles installed Gilbert de Bourbon as Viceroy of Naples and returned to France with about half of the French forces.

Initially, the light infantry and cavalry under Fernández de Córdoba command were no match against the heavily armed French. A lack of training and poor coordination between Spanish and Italian forces compounded the problem. In their first major engagement on 28 June 1495, Fernández de Córdoba was defeated at the Battle of Seminara against French forces led by Bernard Stewart d&#x27;Aubigny. After the defeat, Fernández de Córdoba withdrew to implement a rigorous training program and reorganize his army. The Spanish employed effective guerrilla tactics, striking quickly to disrupt French supply lines and avoiding large-scale battles. Gradually Fernández de Córdoba regained a foothold in the country and then assaulted the French-occupied Italian cities. Within a year, Fernández de Córdoba achieved a decisive victory at Atella, capturing the French viceroy and expelling the remaining 
French forces from Naples. He also recovered the Roman port of Ostia and returned the captured territories to the Italians by 1498.

===Military restructuring===
When Fernández de Córdoba returned to Spain he drew on the lessons from the Italian campaign to restructure the Spanish forces and military strategy. In the open field, the loose formation and short swords of the Spanish infantry were unable to withstand a charge of heavy cavalry and infantry armed with pikes. To overcome this weakness, Fernández de Córdoba introduced a new infantry formation armed with pikes and a heavy, shoulder-fired gun called an arquebus. To increase tactical flexibility he assigned different sections of his forces to specific roles, rather than using them as one general force. These new sections could maneuver more independently and act with greater flexibility.

===Second Italian War===
After Louis XII succeeded Charles as king of France in 1498, he quickly declared his intention to re-invade Italy and once again seize Naples. To buy time, Spain negotiated the Treaty of Granada with France in 1500, agreeing to partition Naples between the two countries. Fernández de Córdoba returned to Italy leading a large force on the pretext of joining with France and Venice to attack the Ottomans in the Ionian Sea. For a time Fernández de Córdoba did fight the Turks, seizing the strongly held island of Cephalonia in December 1500 after a two-month siege.
Fernández de Córdoba returned to Naples and after Frederick IV abdicated, the French and Spanish fought a guerilla war while negotiating the partition of the kingdom. Spain was outnumbered and besieged in Barletta by the French. Gonzalo refused to be drawn into a full-scale battle until he received sufficient reinforcements.

When his army was adequately reinforced, Fernández de Córdoba engaged the French on 28 April 1503 at the Battle of Cerignola where 6,000 Spanish troops faced a French army of 10,000. Gonzalo formed his infantry into units called &quot;coronelías&quot; with pikemen tightly packed in the center and arquebusiers and swordsmen on the flanks. The French unsuccessfully attacked the front and were assailed by gunfire coming from the flanks. The French commander, the Louis d&#x27;Armagnac, Duke of Nemours, was killed early in the battle. After withstanding two French charges, Fernández de Córdoba, El Gran Capitán, went on the offensive and drove the French off the field. This was the first time in history that a battle had been won largely through the strength of firearms.

Fernández de Córdoba occupied the city of Naples and pushed the French forces back across the Garigliano River. Separated by the river, a stalemate ensued with neither side able to make progress. But Fernández de Córdoba strung together a pontoon bridge and stole across the river on the night of 29 December 1503. The French, commanded by Ludovico II of Saluzzo, had assumed the rain-swollen river was impassable and were taken by complete surprise. Fernández de Córdoba and his army decisively defeated the French with their formations of pikes and arquebuses. Fernández de Córdoba continued to pursue the French and captured the Italian city of Gaeta in January 1504. Unable to mount a defense after these losses, the French were allowed to evacuate Italy by sea and forced to sign the Treaty of Blois in 1505, relinquishing their hold on Naples.

==Viceroy of Naples==
When the French were driven out of Naples, Fernández de Córdoba was made Duke of Terranova and appointed Viceroy of Naples in 1504. Later that same year Queen Isabel I of Castile died, depriving him of his most ardent supporter. Isabel&#x27;s death also effectively pushed her husband, Ferdinand II of Aragon, out of power temporarily in Castile and forced him to defend his interests in Aragon. Naples was an Aragonese kingdom but Gonzalo was a Castilian and widely popular. As a result, Ferdinand suspected his loyalty and also felt that Gonzalo spent too freely from the treasury. In 1507 Ferdinand traveled to Naples, removed him from office and ordered him to return to Spain with a promise that he would be installed as master of the Order of Santiago, a powerful and prestigious position.
Although Fernández de Córdoba was awarded the additional title, Duke of Sessa, he never received the promised appointment to lead the Santiago military order. Ferdinand continued to praise him but gave him nothing else to do; he eventually retired to one of his country estates. Fernández de Córdoba died of malaria on 2 December 1515 at his villa near Granada at age 62.

==Marriage and family==
Fernández de Córdoba first married in 1474 to his cousin María de Sotomayor; about a year later she died giving birth to a stillborn son. On 14 February 1489 he married María Manrique de Lara y Figueroa (also known as María Manrique de Lara y Espinosa, d. 1527) from a powerful and wealthy noble family. His only surviving daughter, Elvira Fernández de Córdoba y Manrique, would inherit all his titles upon his death in 1515.

==Legacy==

The &quot;Gran Capitán&quot; was a pioneer of modern warfare. He revolutionized 16th-century military strategy by integrating firearms into the Spanish infantry and directed the first battle in history won by gunpowder small arms (in this case, arquebuses), the Battle of Cerignola of 1503. 
He helped found the first modern standing army (the nearly invincible Spanish infantry which dominated European battlefields for the 16th and early 17th century), and he pioneered combined arms warfare by combining the use of infantry, cavalry and artillery with naval support.

He left no sons, and was succeeded in his dukedoms by daughter Elvira Fernández de Córdoba y Manrique. María Cerezo, who married Amerigo Vespucci, was alleged to be an illegitimate daughter to Fernández de Córdoba too.

His burial place in the Monastery of San Jerónimo in Granada, was built in Renaissance style. His remains were transferred there in 1552, together with some 700 war trophies (captured banners). His daughter, Elvira, and his wife, Maria, are also buried there, along with a number of other family members. Elvira died in 1524, and Maria died in 1527.

The tomb was desecrated by Napoleonic troops under the command of the Corsican General Sebastiani during the Peninsular War, in 1810/11. The remains of Fernández de Córdoba were illegally exhumed and mutilated, and the 700 banners were burned. 
Stone from the tower was used to build the Puente Verde bridge over the Genil. The monastery was fully restored at the end of the 19th century.

<doc id="489924" wikidata="Q7419361" url="?curid=489924" title="Santa Claus (horse)">
<text>Santa Claus (1961–1970) was a British-bred, Irish-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He is most notable for his achievements as a three-year-old in 1964 when he won the Irish 2,000 Guineas, The Derby, and the Irish Derby. His performances earned him the title of British Horse of the Year.

==Background==
Santa Claus was a dark-coated bay stallion standing a little over 16.1 hands high, bred in Warwickshire by Dr F Smorfitt. He was sired by the St Leger winner Chamoissaire out of Aunt Clara, a mare who failed to win in her three racecourse appearances.

Santa Claus was first sent to the sales as a weanling in December 1961 at Newmarket, where he was sold for 800 guineas. A year later he was returned to the sales and was bought for 1,200 guineas by the Irish division of the British Bloodstock Agency acting on behalf of John Ismay and Mrs Darby Rogers. The colt was sent into training with Mrs Rogers&#x27; son, Mick Rogers, at the Curragh.

==Racing career==

===1963: two-year-old season===
Santa Claus made little impression on his debut, finishing unplaced in the six furlong Anglesey Stakes at the Curragh in August. A month later however, he ran in Ireland&#x27;s most prestigious two-year-old race, the National Stakes, also at the Curragh. He won by eight lengths, establishing himself as a leading contender for the following year&#x27;s Irish and British Classics.

===1964: three-year-old season===
In 1964, Santa Claus won the Irish 2,000 Guineas. He started as even-money favourite and won by three lengths. At Epsom, he started favourite at odds of 15/8 for the Derby, in which he was ridden by the fifty-year-old Australian jockey Scobie Breasley. Santa Claus was reported to have arrived at the course under tight security as there were fears of a plot to interfere with the heavily backed colt to prevent him from winning. A crowd estimated at over 200,000, including the Queen and other members of the British royal family, was in attendance to view the most valuable race ever run in Britain. Breasley held the colt up in the early stages before producing him with a run down the centre of the course in the straight. Santa Claus took the lead inside the final furlong and won by a length from the future St Leger winner Indiana. After the race, Breasley called the colt &quot;a dream to ride, a beaut.&quot;

A month later, Santa Claus started 4/7 favourite for the Irish Derby at the Curragh and won by four lengths from Lionhearted. At Ascot, he was the shortest-priced favourite in the history of the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, starting at odds of 2/13 against three opponents. In one of British racing&#x27;s biggest upsets he failed to catch the front-running French colt Nasram and was beaten two lengths, having been unsuited by the unusually firm ground.

More firm ground in the autumn led to Santa Claus missing the St Leger and going straight for the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp in October. He finished second of the twenty-two runners, beaten three quarters of a length by the outsider Prince Royal.

==Assessment and achievements==
Santa Claus was named British Horse of the Year by the Bloodstock Breeders&#x27; Review, gaining 10 of the 20 votes. His highest Timeform rating was 133+ Santa Claus&#x27;s second place in the Arc took his total earnings to £153,646, enabling him to overtake Ballymoss as the biggest prize-money winner in the history of British and Irish racing. He held the record until his total was surpassed by Ribocco in 1967.

In their book &quot;A Century of Champions&quot;, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Santa Claus as an “average” Derby winner and the fifteenth-best Irish racehorse of the 20th century.

==Stud career==
Santa Claus was retired in 1965 to stand at stud in Ireland after being sold at the end of his racing career for £400,000. He had some success as a stallion but had little opportunity to distinguish himself as he died of thrombosis in 1970. His best offspring included the Irish Classic winners Reindeer (Irish St. Leger) and Santa Tina (Irish Oaks).

<doc id="489929" wikidata="Q2462224" url="?curid=489929" title="Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus">
<text>Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus (1992) is a book written by American author and relationship counselor John Gray. The book states that most common relationship problems between men and women are a result of fundamental psychological differences between the sexes, which the author exemplifies by means of its eponymous metaphor: that men and women are from distinct planets—men from Mars and women from Venus—and that each sex is acclimated to its own planet&#x27;s society and customs, but not to those of the other. One example is men&#x27;s complaint that if they offer solutions to problems that women bring up in conversation, the women are not necessarily interested in solving those problems, but talking about them. The book asserts each sex can be understood in terms of distinct ways they respond to stress and stressful situations.

The book has sold more than 15 million copies and, according to a CNN report, it was the &quot;highest ranked work of non-fiction&quot; of the 1990s, spending 121 weeks on the bestseller list. The book and its central metaphor have become a part of popular culture and the foundation for the author&#x27;s subsequent books, recordings, seminars, and other ventures.

==Summary of results==
Gray writes how men and women each monitor the amount of give and take in relationships. If the balance shifts, one person feeling they have given more than they have received, resentment can develop. This is a time when only communication can help to bring the relationship back into balance.

Gray further asserts men and women view giving and receiving love differently; one&#x27;s intended loving expressions may not be so perceived by the other, for whom such actions are &quot;tallied up&quot;. According to Gray, women and men are often surprised to find their partners &quot;keep score&quot; at all, or that their scoring methods widely differ.

He says women use a points system which few men are aware of. Each individual act of love gets one point, regardless of magnitude. Men, on the other hand, assign small acts, small expenditures, fewer points. Larger blocks of points (20, 30, 40 points, etc.) go to what they consider bigger expenditures. To a woman, the emotional stroke delivered by sincere attention is inseparable from the act. The different perception of expenditure can lead to conflict when the man thinks his work has earned him, say, 20 points and deserves corresponding recognition, while the woman has assigned him only 1 point and recognizes him accordingly. The man tends to think he can do one Big Thing for her (scoring 50 points) and not do much else, assuming he has &quot;banked&quot; points and can afford to &quot;coast&quot;. The woman should be satisfied with his performance and give him credit for it. Instead, the woman would rather have many little things done for her on a regular basis, because women like to think their men are thinking of them and care for them more constantly. Gray clarifies how these two perceptions of &quot;strokes&quot; cause conflict. He encourages talking about these issues openly.

Another major idea put forth in Gray&#x27;s book regards the difference in the way the genders react to stress. Gray states that when male tolerance to stressful situations is exceeded, they withdraw temporarily, &quot;retreating into their cave&quot;, so to speak. Often, they literally retreat: for example, to the garage, or to go spend time with friends. In their &quot;caves&quot;, Gray writes, men are not necessarily focused on the problem at hand. Yet this &quot;time-out&quot; lets them distance themselves from the problem and relax, allowing them to re-examine the problem later from a fresh perspective.

Gray holds that male retreat into the cave has historically been hard for women to understand. When women become unduly stressed, their natural reaction is to talk with someone close about it (even if talking doesn&#x27;t provide a solution to the problem at hand). This sets up a natural dynamic where the man retreats as the woman tries to get closer, which becomes a major source of conflict between them.

The &quot;wave&quot; is a term Gray uses to describe a natural dynamic centered around a woman&#x27;s ability to give to other people. He writes when she feels full of love and energy to give to others, her wave is stable. When she gives of herself, but doesn&#x27;t receive adequate love and attention in return, her wave becomes unbalanced, cresting and eventually crashing. Then, a woman needs the attention, listening, understanding, and reassurance of those around her—as well as self-love. Gray explains that once she is rejuvenated by getting the support she needs, her wave is able to build and rise once again, with renewed love and energy to give. Men, advises Gray, should support this natural cycle by not being threatened by it or telling her why she should not feel the way a woman feels.

==Reception==
===Popularity===
The book has sold more than 15 million copies and, according to a CNN report, it was the &quot;highest ranked work of non-fiction&quot; of the 1990s.

The book has become a &quot;popular paradigm&quot; for problems in relationships based on the different tendencies in each gender and has spawned infomercials, audiotapes and videotapes, weekend seminars, theme vacations, a one-man Broadway show, a TV sitcom, and a proposed movie topic with 20th Century Fox. The book has been turned into a successful stage show in France in 2006, where it has been running for six years in Paris. In 2012, an English version went on tour in the UK.

===Criticism===
The book has been criticized for placing human psychology into stereotypes.

Michael Kimmel, a professor of sociology at Stony Brook University, makes the assertion that men and women are not fundamentally different, contrary to what Gray suggests in his book. In Kimmel&#x27;s 2008 lecture at Middlebury College in Vermont, titled &quot;Venus, Mars, or Planet Earth? Women and Men in a New Millennium&quot;, Kimmel contends that the perceived differences between men and women are ultimately a social construction, and that socially and politically, men and women want the same things.

In 2002, author Julia T. Wood published a critical response to the portrayal of the genders in &quot;Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus&quot;. In the first chapter of the 2003 book, &quot;The Essential Difference&quot;, Simon Baron-Cohen states: &quot;the view that men are from Mars and women Venus paints the differences between the two sexes as too extreme. The two sexes are different, but are not &quot;so&quot; different that we cannot understand each other.&quot; In 2004, Erina MacGeorge, a Purdue University communications professor, said that based on research she conducted using questionnaires and interviews, men and women are not so different and &quot;books like John Gray&#x27;s &quot;Men are From Mars and Women are From Venus&quot; and Deborah Tannen&#x27;s &quot;You Just Don&#x27;t Understand&quot; tell men that being masculine means dismissing feelings and downplaying problems (which many men themselves that read the book disagree with). That isn&#x27;t what most men do, and it isn&#x27;t good for either men or women.&quot;

A study by Bobbi Carothers and Harry Reis involving over 13,000 individuals, fittingly titled, &quot;Men and Women are From Earth...&quot; found that on most psychological characteristics or tendencies, including the Big Five personality traits as well as sex-related questions like rating level of desire for casual sex, there was not a taxonomic difference between men and women on the vast majority of personality traits and preferences. Despite there being differences in averages by gender, the distributions overlapped so much that a taxonomic distinction was not meaningful. &quot;Thus, contrary to the assertions of pop psychology titles like &quot;Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus&quot;, it is untrue that men and women think about their relationships in qualitatively different ways.&quot; There were notable taxonomic differences on physical attributes and measurements of physical strength.

Schauberger was born in Holzschlag, Upper Austria on 30 June 1885. His parents were Leopold Schauberger and Josefa, née Klimitsch. From 1891 to 1897 he attended the elementary school in Aigen, then until 1900 the state grammar school in Linz. Until 1904 he went to the forestry school in Aggsbach in the Kartause Aggsbach, where he passed the exam as a forester. From 1904 to 1906 he was a forest clerk in Groß-Schweinbarth in Lower Austria.

<text>Robert Wright (1906–1992) was a historian and biographer of Hugh Dowding, the RAF&#x27;s commanding officer in the Battle of Britain. Wright served as Dowding&#x27;s personal assistant during the Battle. In his book &quot;Dowding and the Battle of Britain&quot; (1969) Wright was one of the early proponents of the Big Wing conspiracy theory that blamed Trafford Leigh-Mallory and the British Air Ministry for Dowding&#x27;s removal from command at the end of the battle. Many of Wright&#x27;s claims, some based on Dowding&#x27;s faulty recollections, have been repudiated by witnesses and documentary evidence, but his allegations have proven popular and persistent over the years.

In November 1944, whilst serving as radar operator on No. 85 Squadron RAF, the Mosquito he was in crashed. The pilot died, but Wright survived and was taken to RAF Hospital Ely.

Prior to becoming a champion of Dowding, Wright co-wrote the biography of Dowding&#x27;s rival and replacement at Fighter Command, Sholto Douglas in two volumes titled: &quot;Years of Combat&quot; and &quot;Years of Command&quot; (1966).

<doc id="489935" wikidata="Q6086107" url="?curid=489935" title="Isomorphism of categories">
<text>In category theory, two categories &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; are isomorphic if there exist functors &quot;F&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → &quot;D&quot; and &quot;G&quot; : &quot;D&quot; → &quot;C&quot; that are mutually inverse to each other, i.e. &quot;FG&quot; = 1&quot;D&quot; (the identity functor on &quot;D&quot;) and &quot;GF&quot; = 1&quot;C&quot;. This means that both the objects and the morphisms of &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; stand in a one-to-one correspondence to each other. Two isomorphic categories share all properties that are defined solely in terms of category theory; for all practical purposes, they are identical and differ only in the notation of their objects and morphisms.

Isomorphism of categories is a very strong condition and rarely satisfied in practice. Much more important is the notion of equivalence of categories; roughly speaking, for an equivalence of categories we don&#x27;t require that formula_1 be &quot;equal&quot; to formula_2, but only &quot;naturally isomorphic&quot; to formula_2, and likewise that formula_4 be naturally isomorphic to formula_5.

==Properties==
As is true for any notion of isomorphism, we have the following general properties formally similar to an equivalence relation:
* any category &quot;C&quot; is isomorphic to itself
* if &quot;C&quot; is isomorphic to &quot;D&quot;, then &quot;D&quot; is isomorphic to &quot;C&quot;
* if &quot;C&quot; is isomorphic to &quot;D&quot; and &quot;D&quot; is isomorphic to &quot;E&quot;, then &quot;C&quot; is isomorphic to &quot;E&quot;.

A functor &quot;F&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → &quot;D&quot; yields an isomorphism of categories if and only if it is bijective on objects and on morphism sets. This criterion can be convenient as it avoids the need to construct the inverse functor &quot;G&quot;.

==Examples==
* Consider a finite group &quot;G&quot;, a field &quot;k&quot; and the group algebra &quot;kG&quot;. The category of &quot;k&quot;-linear group representations of &quot;G&quot; is isomorphic to the category of left modules over &quot;kG&quot;. The isomorphism can be described as follows: given a group representation ρ : &quot;G&quot; → GL(&quot;V&quot;), where &quot;V&quot; is a vector space over &quot;k&quot;, GL(&quot;V&quot;) is the group of its &quot;k&quot;-linear automorphisms, and ρ is a group homomorphism, we turn &quot;V&quot; into a left &quot;kG&quot; module by defining formula_6 for every &quot;v&quot; in &quot;V&quot; and every element Σ &quot;ag&quot; &quot;g&quot; in &quot;kG&quot;. Conversely, given a left &quot;kG&quot; module &quot;M&quot;, then &quot;M&quot; is a &quot;k&quot; vector space, and multiplication with an element &quot;g&quot; of &quot;G&quot; yields a &quot;k&quot;-linear automorphism of &quot;M&quot; (since &quot;g&quot; is invertible in &quot;kG&quot;), which describes a group homomorphism &quot;G&quot; → GL(&quot;M&quot;). (There are still several things to check: both these assignments are functors, i.e. they can be applied to maps between group representations resp. &quot;kG&quot; modules, and they are inverse to each other, both on objects and on morphisms). See also .
* Every ring can be viewed as a preadditive category with a single object. The functor category of all additive functors from this category to the category of abelian groups is isomorphic to the category of left modules over the ring.
* Another isomorphism of categories arises in the theory of Boolean algebras: the category of Boolean algebras is isomorphic to the category of Boolean rings. Given a Boolean algebra &quot;B&quot;, we turn &quot;B&quot; into a Boolean ring by using the symmetric difference as addition and the meet operation formula_7 as multiplication. Conversely, given a Boolean ring &quot;R&quot;, we define the join operation by &quot;a&quot;formula_8&quot;b&quot; = &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; + &quot;ab&quot;, and the meet operation as multiplication. Again, both of these assignments can be extended to morphisms to yield functors, and these functors are inverse to each other.
* If &quot;C&quot; is a category with an initial object s, then the slice category (&quot;s&quot;↓&quot;C&quot;) is isomorphic to &quot;C&quot;. Dually, if &quot;t&quot; is a terminal object in &quot;C&quot;, the functor category (&quot;C&quot;↓&quot;t&quot;) is isomorphic to &quot;C&quot;. Similarly, if 1 is the category with one object and only its identity morphism (in fact, 1 is the terminal category), and &quot;C&quot; is any category, then the functor category &quot;C&quot;1, with objects functors &quot;c&quot;: 1 → &quot;C&quot;, selecting an object &quot;c&quot;∈Ob(&quot;C&quot;), and arrows natural transformations &quot;f&quot;: &quot;c&quot; → &quot;d&quot; between these functors, selecting a morphism &quot;f&quot;: &quot;c&quot; → &quot;d&quot; in &quot;C&quot;, is again isomorphic to &quot;C&quot;.

<text>Plestiodon anthracinus, the coal skink, is a species of lizard which is endemic to the United States.

==Description==
It is a mid-sized lizard with short well developed legs, and overlap when addressed in most specimens, except gravid females. It grows to in total length with a maximum snout-to-vent length (SVL) of . It is a four-lined skink whose light stripes extend onto the tail. The broad dark lateral stripe is 4–4.5 scales wide and there are no light lines on top of the head. The dorsolateral light stripe is on the edges of the 3rd and 4th scale rows, counting from midline of back. One postmental scale is present. The sides of the head of the male are reddish during spring breeding season, at least in some parts of the range.

==Taxonomy==
Two subspecies of the coal skink are recognized, including the nominotypical subspecies:
*Northern coal skink – &quot;Plestiodon anthracinus anthracinus&quot; 
*Southern coal skink – &quot;Plestiodon anthracinus pluvialis&quot; 

The (northern) coal skink was first described by Baird in 1850; the southern subspecies &quot;P. a. pluvialis&quot; was identified by Cope in 1880. They are the near the ancestral form for the fasciatus group.

The southern coal skink as a subspecies has posterior supralabials with light centers and dark edges, producing a spotted appearance. There are 26 or more rows of scales around the middle of the body.

==Reproduction==
The coal skink mates in spring or early summer, laying a clutch of 8 or 9 eggs. Their eggs are typically around 10–11 mm in length. Courting for this species usually involves the male&#x27;s initial investigation and recognition of a potential female through pheromonal cues. The young hatch after four to five weeks and are about long. The hatchlings have a blue tail; those of the northern coal skink are striped like the adults, but young southern coal skinks have black bodies with at the utmost faint traces of stripes.

==Habitat and Geographic range==

&lt;br&gt;

The more humid portions of wooded hillsides with abundant leaf litter or loose stones are favorite habitats. Coal skinks&#x27; habitat may also include areas around springs, rocky bluffs overlooking creek valleys, and mesic sites. If pursued, they will take refuge in shallow water, going to the bottom and hiding under stones or debris.

The northern coal skink (blue in the figure) occurs in western New York and central Pennsylvania and in isolated colonies in the Appalachians. The southern coal skink (orange) can be found on the eastern Gulf coast from the Florida panhandle to Louisiana as well as west of the Mississippi from eastern Kansas and central Missouri to eastern Texas and northern Louisiana. Scattered intermingled occurrences of both subspecies (green in the figure) occur in Alabama and in Georgia. Their current natural threats include a number of small mammals, snakes, and larger species of lizards. Human influence has also been known to pose a threat to this species, due to habitat decrease and degradation for a number of reptile species.

<doc id="489941" wikidata="Q2119938" url="?curid=489941" title="Saturation diving">
<text>Saturation diving is diving for periods long enough to bring all tissues into with the partial pressures of the inert components of the breathing gas used. It is a diving mode that reduces the number of decompressions divers working at great depths must undergo by only decompressing divers once at the end of the diving operation, which may last days to weeks, having them remain under pressure for the whole period. A diver breathing pressurized gas accumulates dissolved inert gas used in the breathing mixture to dilute the oxygen to a non-toxic level in the tissues, which can cause potentially fatal decompression sickness (&quot;the bends&quot;) if permitted to come out of solution within the body tissues; hence, returning to the surface safely requires lengthy decompression so that the inert gases can be eliminated via the lungs. Once the dissolved gases in a diver&#x27;s tissues reach the saturation point, however, decompression time does not increase with further exposure, as no more inert gas is accumulated.

Saturation diving takes advantage of this by having divers remain in that saturated state. When not in the water, the divers live in a sealed environment which maintains their pressurised state; this can be an ambient pressure underwater habitat or a saturation system at the surface, with transfer to and from the pressurised living quarters to the equivalent depth underwater via a closed, pressurised diving bell. This may be maintained for up to several weeks, and divers are decompressed to surface pressure only once, at the end of their tour of duty. By limiting the number of decompressions in this way, and using a conservative decompression schedule the risk of decompression sickness is significantly reduced, and the total time spent decompressing is minimised. Saturation divers typically breathe a helium–oxygen mixture to prevent nitrogen narcosis, and limit work of breathing, but at shallow depths saturation diving has been done on nitrox mixtures.

Most of the physiological and medical aspects of diving to the same depths are much the same in saturation and bell-bounce ambient pressure diving, or are less of a problem, but there are medical and psychological effects of living under saturation for extended periods.

Saturation diving is a specialized form of diving; of the 3,300 commercial divers employed in the United States in 2015, 336 were saturation divers. Special training and certification is required, as the activity is inherently hazardous, and a set of standard operating procedures, emergency procedures, and a range of specialised equipment is used to control the risk, that require consistently correct performance by all the members of an extended diving team. The combination of relatively large skilled personnel requirements, complex engineering, and bulky, heavy equipment required to support a saturation diving project make it an expensive diving mode, but it allows direct human intervention at places that would not otherwise be practical, and where it is applied, it is generally more economically viable than other options, if such exist.

==History==

On December 22, 1938, Edgar End and Max Nohl made the first intentional saturation dive by spending 27 hours breathing air at 101 feet sea water (fsw) (30.8 msw) in the County Emergency Hospital recompression facility in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Their decompression lasted five hours leaving Nohl with a mild case of decompression sickness that resolved with recompression.

Albert R. Behnke proposed the idea of exposing humans to increased ambient pressures long enough for the blood and tissues to become saturated with inert gases in 1942. In 1957, George F. Bond began the Genesis project at the Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory proving that humans could in fact withstand prolonged exposure to different breathing gases and increased environmental pressures. Once saturation is achieved, the amount of time needed for decompression depends on the depth and gases breathed, and does not increase with further exposure. This was the beginning of saturation diving and the US Navy&#x27;s Man-in-the-Sea Program.
The first commercial saturation dives were performed in 1965 by Westinghouse to replace faulty trash racks at on the Smith Mountain Dam. In the same year, the Conshelf III experiment was carried out by divers of Jacques Cousteau at the depth of 100 m.

Peter B. Bennett is credited with the invention of trimix breathing gas as a method to eliminate high pressure nervous syndrome. In 1981, at the Duke University Medical Center, Bennett conducted an experiment called &quot;Atlantis III&quot;, which involved subjecting volunteers to a pressure of 2250 fsw (equivalent to a depth of 686 m in seawater), and slowly decompressing them to atmospheric pressure over a period of 31-plus days, setting an early world record for depth-equivalent in the process. A later experiment, &quot;Atlantis IV&quot;, encountered problems as one of the volunteers experienced euphoric hallucinations and hypomania.

The history of commercial saturation diving is closely linked to offshore oil and gas extraction. In the early 1960s exploration of the North Sea started on the premise that the Dutch gas fields might extend under the sea. This was borne out when the Gulf Tide rig hit the Ekofisk reservoir in 1969 and in 1971 Shell oil found the Brent oilfield between Norway and Shetland. From this time to the 1990s the industry developed the procedures and equipment for saturation diving from pioneering and experimental, with a somewhat dubious safety record, to a mature industry with greatly improved occupational health and safety.

When the North Sea drilling started, there was little diving support infrastructure in Europe, and the high wages attracted divers from the Gulf of Mexico oilfields, who introduced the fibre reinforced resin lightweight demand helmets from Kirby-Morgan, hot water suits from Diving Unlimited International, and the U.S. Navy Diving Manual, at the time the leading set of offshore diving procedures. Research and development money was available, and new technical developments were supported by the European Economic Community. A major challenge was developing saturation diving practices suitable to the common North Sea depth range of 100 to 180 m.

During the early drilling stages most of the diving work was for relatively short periods and was generally suitable for bell bounce diving, but the development of oilfield seabed infrastructure required much longer diver interventions, and saturation diving procedures were developed to suit. By 1982, a large amount of shallow maintenance work was becoming necessary, which brought in more air diving to service the rigs. By 2017 about 80% of North Sea diving was heliox saturation diving and the other 20% shallow air diving.

Excursion dives without decompression stops can be done both upward and downward from saturation storage pressure within limits, allowing the divers a range of working depths, and if work is required beyond excursion range, the divers can be compressed or decompressed in storage to suit the changed depth range. Further work was done by the United States Navy Experimental Diving Unit on excursion dives from February 1974 to June 1976, and the results published in the 1984 U.S. Navy Diving Manual. These tables used a partial pressure of oxygen of 0.35 to 0.4 bar during decompression, with quite slow decompression rates, which varied with the depth, getting slower as the depth decreased, with a 6-hour stop from midnight and a two-hour stop from 14:00 and a gas fraction limit of 22% for the last part of the ascent to reduce fire risk. The tables allowed decompression to start directly after return from a dive provided there had not been an upward excursion, as this was found to increase the risk of bubble development.

At the same time, the commercial diving contractor Compagnie maritime d&#x27;expertises (COMEX) had been developing slightly different decompression procedures, in which the oxygen partial pressures were higher, between 0.6 and 0.8 bar, and the ascent rates were faster to take advantage of the high PO2. Continuous decompression without night stops was used, and excursions were allowed. Over time these were revised to use lower PO2 and slower ascent rates, particularly at the shallower depths. Competing tables were thought to be used to gain competitive advantage, so in 1988 the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate organised a conference on saturation decompression safety under Val Hempleman, and in 1990 a conference to harmonise the saturation tables to be used in the North Sea in the Norwegian sector using input from five contractors. In 1999 the NORSOK U100 standard was published, which was a compromise using aspects of several of the tables, but which has proven in use to be sufficiently conservative and has a good safety record.

In the 1980s the Royal Navy were using an oxygen partial pressure of 0.42 bar for decompression from saturation, which is slightly higher than to 0.40 bar of the US Navy table. This reduced the time for decompression by a small percentage.

Saturation decompression in the Brazil oilfields took a slightly different route, and was originally based on company tables, until Brazil produced their own legislation in 1988, similar to that of the UK&#x27;s Health and Safety Executive. In 2004 revised legislation was closer to the COMEX procedures.

By 2017 the system had settled into a chamber PO2 of 0.5 bar while deeper than 15 msw, and limited to 22 to 23% at the end of decompression to limit fire risk.

==Applications==
Saturation diving has applications in scientific diving and commercial offshore diving.

Commercial offshore diving, sometimes shortened to just offshore diving, is a branch of commercial diving, with divers working in support of the exploration and production sector of the oil and gas industry in places such as the Gulf of Mexico in the United States, the North Sea in the United Kingdom and Norway, and along the coast of Brazil. The work in this area of the industry includes maintenance of oil platforms and the building of underwater structures. In this context &quot;&quot; implies that the diving work is done outside of national boundaries. Saturation diving work in support of the offshore oil and gas industries is usually contract based.

Saturation diving is standard practice for bottom work at many of the deeper offshore sites, and allows more effective use of the diver&#x27;s time while reducing the risk of decompression sickness. Surface oriented air diving is more usual in shallower water.

Underwater habitats are underwater structures in which people can live for extended periods and carry out most of the basic human functions of a 24-hour day, such as working, resting, eating, attending to personal hygiene, and sleeping. In this context &#x27;habitat&#x27; is generally used in a narrow sense to mean the interior and immediate exterior of the structure and its fixtures, but not its surrounding marine environment. Most early underwater habitats lacked regenerative systems for air, water, food, electricity, and other resources. However, recently some new underwater habitats allow for these resources to be delivered using pipes, or generated within the habitat, rather than manually delivered.

An underwater habitat has to meet the needs of human physiology and provide suitable environmental conditions, and the one which is most critical is breathing air of suitable quality. Others concern the physical environment (pressure, temperature, light, humidity), the chemical environment (drinking water, food, waste products, toxins) and the biological environment (hazardous sea creatures, microorganisms, marine fungi). Much of the science covering underwater habitats and their technology designed to meet human requirements is shared with diving, diving bells, submersible vehicles and submarines, and spacecraft.

Numerous underwater habitats have been designed, built and used around the world since the early 1960s, either by private individuals or by government agencies. They have been used almost exclusively for research and exploration, but in recent years at least one underwater habitat has been provided for recreation and tourism. Research has been devoted particularly to the physiological processes and limits of breathing gases under pressure, for aquanaut and astronaut training, as well as for research on marine ecosystems. Access to and from the exterior is generally vertically through a hole in the bottom of the structure called a moon pool. The habitat may include a decompression chamber, or personnel transfer to the surface may be via a closed diving bell.

==Medical aspects==

===Decompression sickness===

Decompression sickness (DCS) is a potentially fatal condition caused by bubbles of inert gas, which can occur in divers&#x27; bodies as a consequence of the pressure reduction as they ascend. To prevent decompression sickness, divers have to limit their rate of ascent, to reduce the concentration of dissolved gases in their body sufficiently to avoid bubble formation and growth. This protocol, known as decompression, can last for several hours for dives in excess of when divers spend more than a few minutes at these depths. The longer divers remain at depth, the more inert gas is absorbed into their body tissues, and the time required for decompression increases rapidly. This presents a problem for operations that require divers to work for extended periods at depth, as the time spent decompressing can exceed the time spent doing useful work by a large margin. However, after somewhere around 72 hours under any given pressure, depending on the ingassing model used, divers&#x27; bodies become saturated with inert gas, and no further uptake occurs. From that point onward, no increase in decompression time is necessary. The practice of saturation diving takes advantage of this by providing a means for divers to remain at depth pressure for days or weeks. At the end of that period, divers need to carry out a single saturation decompression, which is much more efficient and a lower risk than making multiple short dives, each of which requires a lengthy decompression time. By making the single decompression slower and longer, in the controlled conditions and relative comfort of the saturation habitat or decompression chamber, the risk of decompression sickness during the single exposure is further reduced.

===High-pressure nervous syndrome===

High-pressure nervous syndrome (HPNS) is a neurological and physiological diving disorder that results when a diver descends below about while breathing a helium–oxygen mixture. The effects depend on the rate of descent and the depth. HPNS is a limiting factor in future deep diving. HPNS can be reduced by using a small percentage of nitrogen in the gas mixture.

===Compression arthralgia===

Compression arthralgia is a deep aching pain in the joints caused by exposure to high ambient pressure at a relatively high rate of compression, experienced by underwater divers. The pain may occur in the knees, shoulders, fingers, back, hips, neck or ribs, and may be sudden and intense in onset and may be accompanied by a feeling of roughness in the joints. Onset commonly occurs around 60 msw (meters of sea water), and symptoms are variable depending on depth, compression rate and personal susceptibility. Intensity increases with depth and may be aggravated by exercise. Compression arthralgia is generally a problem of deep diving, particularly deep saturation diving, where at sufficient depth even slow compression may produce symptoms. The use of trimix can reduce the symptoms. Spontaneous improvement may occur over time at depth, but this is unpredictable, and pain may persist into decompression. Compression arthralgia may be easily distinguished from decompression sickness as it starts during descent, is present before starting decompression, and resolves with decreasing pressure, the opposite of decompression sickness. The pain may be sufficiently severe to limit the diver&#x27;s capacity for work, and may also limit the depth of downward excursions.

===Dysbaric osteonecrosis===

Saturation diving (or more precisely, long term exposure to high pressure) is associated with aseptic bone necrosis, although it is not yet known if all divers are affected or only especially sensitive ones. The joints are most vulnerable to osteonecrosis. The connection between high-pressure exposure, decompression procedure and osteonecrosis is not fully understood.

===Extreme depth effects===
A breathing gas mixture of oxygen, helium and hydrogen was developed for use at extreme depths to reduce the effects of high pressure on the central nervous system. Between 1978 and 1984, a team of divers from Duke University in North Carolina conducted the &quot;Atlantis&quot; series of onshore-hyperbaric-chamber-deep-scientific-test-dives. In 1981, during an extreme depth test dive to 686 metres (2251 ft) they breathed the conventional mixture of oxygen and helium with difficulty and suffered trembling and memory lapses.

A hydrogen–helium–oxygen (hydreliox) gas mixture was used during a similar on shore scientific test dive by three divers involved in an experiment for the French Comex S.A. industrial deep-sea diving company in 1992. On 18 November 1992, Comex decided to stop the experiment at an equivalent of 675 meters of sea water (msw) (2215 fsw) because the divers were suffering from insomnia and fatigue. All three divers wanted to push on but the company decided to decompress the chamber to 650 msw (2133 fsw). On 20 November 1992, Comex diver Theo Mavrostomos was given the go-ahead to continue but spent only two hours at 701 msw (2300 fsw). Comex had planned for the divers to spend four and a half days at this depth and carry out tasks.

===Oxygen toxicity===

Both acute and chronic oxygen toxicity are significant risks in saturation diving. The storage breathing gas exposes the divers to one continuous level of oxygen concentration for extended periods, on the order of a month at a time, which requires the gas in the habitat to be maintained at a long term tolerable partial pressure, generally around 0.4 bar, which is well tolerated, and allows for quite large accidental deviations without causing hypoxia. This may be increased during decompression, but as decompression may take over a week, the safely tolerable increase is limited, and at lower pressures oxygen partial pressure is also limited by fire hazard considerations.

Bell and excursion gas composition must suit the planned dive profile. A higher oxygen partial pressure may be tolerable over the working period, but it may be logistically preferable to use the same gas used for storage. Bailout gas may have a higher oxygen content. At one time the recommended bailout oxygen partial pressure was significantly higher than used in the main gas supply.

===Thermal balance of the diver===

Heat transfer to and via gases at higher pressure than atmospheric is increased as higher-density gases have a higher heat capacity. This effect is also modified by changes in breathing gas composition necessary for reducing narcosis and work of breathing, to limit oxygen toxicity and to accelerate decompression. Since helium conducts heat readily, divers in a helium based atmosphere will lose or gain heat fast if the gas temperature is too low or too high. These effects decrease the tolerable temperature range in a saturation habitat.

The heat loss situation is very different in the saturation living areas, which are temperature and humidity controlled, in the dry bell, and in the water.

The alveoli of the lungs are very effective at heat and humidity transfer. Inspired gas that reaches them is heated to core body temperature and humidified to saturation in the time needed for gas exchange, regardless of the initial temperature and humidity. This heat and humidity are lost to the environment in open circuit breathing systems. When heat loss exceeds heat generation, body temperature will fall.

Exertion increases heat production by metabolic processes, but when breathing gas is cold and dense, heat loss due to the increased volume of gas breathed to support these metabolic processes can result in a net loss of heat, even if the heat loss through the skin is minimised. 
===Health effects of living under saturation conditions===
There is some evidence of long term cumulative reduction in lung function in saturation divers.

Saturation divers are frequently troubled by superficial infections such as skin rashes, otitis externa and athlete&#x27;s foot, which occur during and after saturation exposures. This is thought to be a consequence of raised partial pressure of oxygen, and relatively high temperatures and humidity in the accommodation.

Dysbaric osteonecrosis is considered a consequence of decompression injury rather than living under saturation conditions.

Long term cumulative exposure to high oxygen partial pressures is associated with accelerated development of cataracts.

===Duration of exposure and surface intervals===
The Diving Medical Advisory Council recommends that under normal circumstances the duration of a saturation dive should not exceed 28 days, and the interval between saturation exposures should generally equal the duration of the previous exposure, with a cumulative exposure of not more than 182 days in any 12-month period.

==Operating procedures==
Saturation diving allows professional divers to live and work at pressures greater than 50 msw (160 fsw) for days or weeks at a time, though lower pressures have been used for scientific work from underwater habitats. This type of diving allows for greater economy of work and enhanced safety for the divers. After working in the water, they rest and live in a dry pressurized habitat on, or connected to, a diving support vessel, oil platform or other floating work station, at approximately the same pressure as the work depth. The diving team is compressed to the working pressure only once, at the beginning of the work period, and decompressed to surface pressure once, after the entire work period of days or weeks. There are accepted safe upward and downward excursion limits based on the storage depth. Excursions to greater depths require decompression when returning to storage depth, and excursions to shallower depths are also limited by decompression obligations to avoid decompression sickness during the excursion. Most of the diving skills required for saturation diving are the same as for surface-oriented surface-supplied diving.

Increased use of underwater remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for routine or planned tasks means that saturation dives are becoming less common, though complicated underwater tasks requiring complex manual actions remain the preserve of the deep-sea saturation diver.

A person who operates a saturation diving system is called a life support technician (LST).

===Personnel requirements===
A saturation diving team requires at the minimum the following personnel:
* A diving supervisor (on duty during any diving operations)
* Two life-support supervisors (working shifts while there are divers under pressure)
* Two life-support technicians (also working shifts)
* Two divers in the bell (working diver and bellman – they may alternate during the dive)
* One surface stand-by diver (on duty when the bell is in the water)
* One tender for the surface stand-by diver
In some jurisdictions there will also be a diving medical practitioner on standby, but not necessarily on site, and some companies may require a diving medical technician on site. The actual personnel actively engaged in aspects of the operation are usually more than the minimum.

===Compression===
Compression or blowdown to storage depth is generally at a limited rate to minimize the risk of HPNS and compression arthralgia. Norwegian standards specifies a maximum compression rate of 1 msw per minute, and a rest period at storage depth after compression and before diving.

===Storage depth===
Storage depth, also known as living depth, is the pressure in the accommodation sections of the saturation habitat—the ambient pressure under which the saturation divers live when not engaged in lock-out activity. Any change in storage depth involves a compression or a decompression, both of which are stressful to the occupants, and therefore dive planning should minimize the need for changes of living depth and excursion exposures, and storage depth should be as close as practicable to the working depth, taking into account all relevant safety considerations.

===Atmosphere control===
The hyperbaric atmosphere in the accommodation chambers and the bell are controlled to ensure that the risk of long term adverse effects on the divers is acceptably low. Most saturation diving is done on heliox mixtures, with partial pressure of oxygen in accommodation areas kept around 0.40 to 0.48 bar, which is near the upper limit for long term exposure. Carbon dioxide is removed from the chamber gas by recycling it through scrubber cartridges. The levels are generally limited to a maximum of 0.005 bar partial pressure, equivalent to 0.5% surface equivalent. Most of the balance is helium, with a small amount of nitrogen and trace residuals from the air in the system before compression.

Bell operations and lockouts may also be done at between 0.4 and 0.6 bar oxygen partial pressure, but often use a higher partial pressure of oxygen, between 0.6 and 0.9 bar, which lessens the effect of pressure variation due to excursions away from holding pressure, thereby reducing the amount and probability of bubble formation due to these pressure changes. In emergencies a partial pressure of 0.6 bar of oxygen can be tolerated for over 24 hours, but this is avoided where possible. Carbon dioxide can also be tolerated at higher levels for limited periods. US Navy limit is 0.02 bar for up to 4 hours. Nitrogen partial pressure starts at 0.79 bar from the initial air content before compression, but tends to decrease over time as the system loses gas to lock operation, and is topped up with helium.

=== Deployment of divers ===
Deployment of divers from a surface saturation complex requires the diver to be transferred under pressure from the accommodation area to the underwater workplace. This is generally done by using a closed diving bell, also known as a Personnel Transfer Capsule, which is clamped to the lock flange of the accommodation transfer chamber and the pressure equalized with the accommodation transfer chamber for transfer to the bell. The lock doors can then be opened for the divers to enter the bell. The divers will suit up before entering the bell and complete the pre-dive checks. The pressure in the bell will be adjusted to suit the depth at which the divers will lock out while the bell is being lowered, so that the pressure change can be slow without unduly delaying operations.

The bell is deployed over the side of the vessel or platform using a gantry or A-frame or through a moon pool. Deployment usually starts by lowering the clump weight, which is a large ballast weight suspended from a cable which runs down one side from the gantry, through a set of sheaves on the weight, and up the other side back to the gantry, where it is fastened. The weight hangs freely between the two parts of the cable, and due to its weight, hangs horizontally and keeps the cable under tension. The bell hangs between the parts of the cable, and has a fairlead on each side which slides along the cable as it is lowered or lifted. The bell hangs from a cable attached to the top. As the bell is lowered, the fairleads guide it down the clump weight cables to the workplace.
The bell umbilical is separate from the divers&#x27; umbilicals, which are connected on the inside of the bell. The bell umbilical is deployed from a large drum or umbilical basket and care is taken to keep the tension in the umbilical low but sufficient to remain near vertical in use and to roll up neatly during recovery.

A device called a bell cursor may be used to guide and control the motion of the bell through the air and the splash zone near the surface, where waves can move the bell significantly.

Once the bell is at the correct depth, the final adjustments to pressure are made and after final checks, the supervisor instructs the divers to lock out of the bell. The hatch is at the bottom of the bell and can only be opened if the pressure inside is balanced with the ambient water pressure. The bellman tends the working diver&#x27;s umbilical through the hatch during the dive. If the diver experiences a problem and needs assistance, the bellman will exit the bell and follow the diver&#x27;s umbilical to the diver and render whatever help is necessary and possible. Each diver carries back-mounted bailout gas, which should be sufficient to allow a safe return to the bell in the event of an umbilical gas supply failure.

Breathing gas is supplied to the divers from the surface through the bell umbilical. If this system fails, the bell carries an on-board gas supply which is plumbed into the bell gas panel and can be switched by operating the relevant valves. On-board gas is generally carried externally in several storage cylinders of 50 litres capacity or larger, connected through pressure regulators to the gas panel.

Helium is a very effective heat transfer material, and divers may lose heat rapidly if the surrounding water is cold. To prevent hypothermia, hot-water suits are commonly used for saturation diving, and the breathing gas supply may be heated. Heated water is produced at the surface and piped to the bell through a hot-water line in the bell umbilical, then is transferred to the divers through their excursion umbilicals.
The umbilicals also have cables for electrical power to the bell and helmet lights, and for voice communications and closed circuit video cameras. In some cases the breathing gas is recovered to save the expensive helium. This is done through a reclaim hose in the umbilicals, which ducts exhaled gas exhausted through a reclaim valve on the helmet, through the umbilicals and back to the surface, where the carbon dioxide is scrubbed and the gas boosted into storage cylinders for later use.

===Lock-in and lock-out===
Lock-in (also lock in) is the process of passing from the outside ambient pressure to an internally pressurised space. In saturation diving the internal space of the accommodation is generally at a significantly higher pressure than the internal pressure, and an airlock is needed as an intermediate compartment. Locking into the bell from the water is done at equal pressures so an intermediate airlock is not required. The opposite process, called lock-out (or lock out), is passing out of the internally pressurised space to ambient pressure surroundings.

===Lock-on and lock-off===
Lock-on (or lock on) is the airtight connection of one pressurised compartment to another, and lock-off (or lock off) is the separation of two connected pressurised compartments from each other. An intermediate airlock or trunking space is needed which is equalised from ambient pressure to internal pressure after the seal has been made, and vented to ambient before disconnection.

===Excursions from storage depth===

It is quite common for saturation divers to need to work over a range of depths while the saturation system can only maintain one or two storage depths at any given time. A change of depth from storage depth is known as an excursion, and divers can make excursions within limits without incurring a decompression obligation, just as there are no-decompression limits for surface oriented diving. Excursions may be upward or downward from the storage depth, and the allowed depth change may be the same in both directions, or sometimes slightly less upward than downward. Excursion limits are generally based on a 6 to 8 hour time limit, as this is the standard time limit for a diving shift.
These excursion limits imply a significant change in gas load in all tissues for a depth change of around 15 m for 6 to 8 hours, and experimental work has shown that both venous blood and brain tissue are likely to develop small asymptomatic bubbles after a full shift at both the upward and downward excursion limits. These bubbles remain small due to the relatively small pressure ratio between storage and excursion pressure, and are generally resolved by the time the diver is back on shift, and residual bubbles do not accumulate over sequential shifts. However, any residual bubbles pose a risk of growth if decompression is started before they are eliminated. Ascent rate during excursions is limited, to minimize the risk and amount of bubble formation.

Inner ear decompression sickness is a relatively frequent symptom of DCS as a consequence of excursions in deep saturation dives, in comparison to its very low frequency in decompressions from bounce dives.

===Decompression from saturation===
Once all the tissue compartments have reached saturation for a given pressure and breathing mixture, continued exposure will not increase the gas loading of the tissues. From this point onward the required decompression remains the same. If divers work and live at pressure for a long period, and are decompressed only at the end of the period, the risks associated with decompression are limited to this single exposure. This principle has led to the practice of saturation diving, and as there is only one decompression, and it is done in the relative safety and comfort of a saturation habitat, the decompression is done on a very conservative profile, minimising the risk of bubble formation, growth and the consequent injury to tissues. A consequence of these procedures is that saturation divers are more likely to suffer decompression sickness symptoms in the slowest tissues, whereas bounce divers are more likely to develop bubbles in faster tissues.

Decompression from a saturation dive is a slow process. The rate of decompression typically ranges between 3 and 6 fsw (0.9 and 1.8 msw) per hour. The US Navy Heliox saturation decompression rates require a partial pressure of oxygen to be maintained at between 0.44 and 0.48 atm when possible, but not to exceed 23% by volume, to restrict the risk of fire.
For practicality the decompression is done in increments of 1 fsw at a rate not exceeding 1 fsw per minute, followed by a stop, with the average complying with the table ascent rate. Decompression is done for 16 hours in 24, with the remaining 8 hours split into two rest periods. A further adaptation generally made to the schedule is to stop at 4 fsw for the time that it would theoretically take to complete the decompression at the specified rate, i.e. 80 minutes, and then complete the decompression to surface at 1 fsw per minute. This is done to avoid the possibility of losing the door seal at a low pressure differential and losing the last hour or so of slow decompression.

====Decompression following a recent excursion====
Neither the excursions nor the decompression procedures currently in use have been found to cause decompression problems in isolation. However, there appears to be significantly higher risk when excursions are followed by decompression before non-symptomatic bubbles resulting from excursions have totally resolved. Starting decompression while bubbles are present appears to be the significant factor in many cases of otherwise unexpected decompression sickness during routine saturation decompression. The Norwegian standards do not allow decompression following directly on an excursion.

====Emergency decompression====
Very little is known with confidence about how best to decompress from saturation in an emergency. A DMAC consensus document has been issued with tentative advice on possible procedures based on a balance of perceived risk. These procedures are not supported by experience or experimental work as there is very little of either, and constitute an educated guess at best. The risk of symptomatic decompression sickness is expected to increase as the rate of decompression increases, with earlier pain only symptoms, and more serious symptoms developing later or at higher decompression rates.

Existing decompression tables for accelerated saturation decompression from the US Navy, Duke Tables, and Comex procedures were considered inadequate for the emergency scenarios envisaged, although they are faster than the schedules in general commercial use.

Recommendations include the use of high oxygen partial pressures before and during decompression, with the actual partial pressure chosen depending on the predicted total duration of the decompression. Environmental factors such as dehydration, stress, gas contamination and confinement are considered likely to affect the risk. It is considered of high importance to maintain hydration at high levels. Intravenous administration may be appropriate.

The decompression should be planned to make use of all the expected time available, at the slowest practicable rate, using the highest oxygen partial pressure appropriate for the time scale. Environmental control of the chamber should maintain temperature as closely as possible, and divers should move around enough to aid circulation, but not exercise strenuously. It is considered safer in an accelerated decompression to slow down the decompression, or stop and recompress if the situation changes than to start slow and accelerate decompression if the situation deteriorates.

==Architecture of a surface saturation facility==


Saturation diving systems are a variation of pressure vessels for human occupancy, which are subject to rules for life support, operations, maintenance, and structural design. The &quot;saturation system&quot;, &quot;saturation complex&quot; or &quot;saturation spread&quot; typically comprises either an underwater habitat or a surface complex which includesof a living chamber, transfer chamber and submersible decompression chamber, which is commonly referred to in commercial diving and military diving as the diving bell, personnel transfer capsule (PTC), or submersible decompression chamber (SDC). The system can be permanently installed on a ship or ocean platform, but is more commonly capable of being moved from one vessel to another by crane. To facilitate transportation of the components, it is standard practice to construct the components as modular units based on the intermodal container system, some of which may be stackable to save deck space. The entire system is managed from a control room (&quot;van&quot;), where pressure (depth), chamber atmosphere and other system parameters are monitored and controlled. The diving bell is the elevator or lift that transfers divers from the system to the work site. Typically, it is mated to the system utilizing a removable clamp and is separated from the system tankage bulkhead by a trunking space, a kind of tunnel, through which the divers transfer to and from the bell. At the completion of work or a mission, the saturation diving team is decompressed gradually back to atmospheric pressure by the slow venting of system pressure, at an average of to per day (schedules vary). The process normally involves only one decompression, thereby mitigating the time-consuming and comparatively risky process of in-water staged decompression, or surface decompression (sur-D O2) operations normally associated with non-saturation mixed gas diving. More than one living chamber can be linked to the transfer chamber through trunking so that diving teams can be stored at different depths where this is a logistical requirement. An extra chamber can be fitted to transfer personnel into and out of the system while under pressure and to treat divers for decompression sickness if this should be necessary.

The divers use surface-supplied umbilical diving equipment, usually utilizing deep diving breathing gas, such as helium and oxygen mixtures, stored in large capacity, high pressure gas storage cylinders. The gas supplies are plumbed to the control room, from where they are routed to supply the system components. The bell is fed via a large, multi-part umbilical that supplies breathing gas, electricity, communications and hot water. The bell is also fitted with externally mounted breathing gas cylinders for emergency use.

While in the water the divers will often use a hot water suit to protect against the cold. The hot water comes from boilers on the surface and is pumped down to the diver via the bell&#x27;s umbilical and then through the diver&#x27;s umbilical.

===Personnel transfer capsule===
A closed diving bell, also known as personnel transfer capsule or submersible decompression chamber, is used to transport divers between the workplace and the accommodations chambers. The bell is a cylindrical or spherical pressure vessel with a hatch at the bottom, and may mate with the surface transfer chamber at the bottom hatch or at a side door. Bells are usually designed to carry two or three divers, one of whom, the , stays inside the bell at the bottom and is to the working divers. Each diver is supplied by an umbilical from inside the bell. The bell has a set of high pressure gas storage cylinders mounted on the outside containing on-board reserve breathing gas. The on-board gas and main gas supply are distributed from the bell gas panel, which is controlled by the bellman. The bell may have viewports and external lights. The divers&#x27; umbilicals are stored on racks inside the bell during transfer, and are tended by the bellman during the dive.

====Bell handling system====

The bell is deployed from a gantry or A-frame, also known as a bell launch and recovery system (LARS), on the vessel or platform, using a winch. Deployment may be over the side or through a moon pool.
* The handling system must be able to support the dynamic loads imposed by operating in a range of weather conditions.
* It must be able to move the bell through the air/water interface (splash zone) in a controlled way, fast enough to avoid excessive movement caused by wave action.
* A bell cursor may be used to limit lateral motion through and above the splash zone.
* It must keep the bell clear of the vessel or platform to prevent impact damage or injury.
* It must have sufficient power for fast retrieval of the bell in an emergency, and fine control to facilitate mating of the bell and transfer flange, and to accurately place the bell at the bottom.
* It must include a system to move the bell between the mating flange of the transfer chamber and the launch/retrieval position.

===Transfer chamber===
The transfer chamber, also known as the &quot;&quot;, is where the bell is mated to the surface saturation system for transfer under pressure (TUP). It is a wet surface chamber where divers prepare for a dive and strip off and clean their gear after return. Connection to the bell may be overhead, through the bottom hatch of the bell, or lateral, through a side door.

===Accommodation chambers===

The accommodation chambers may be as small as 100 square feet. This part is generally made of multiple compartments, including living, sanitation, and rest facilities, each a separate unit, joined by short lengths of cylindrical trunking. It is usually possible to isolate each compartment from the others using internal pressure doors. Catering and laundry are provided from outside the system and locked in and out as required.
===Recompression chamber===
A recompression chamber may be included in the system so that divers can be given treatment for decompression sickness without inconveniencing the rest of the occupants. The recompression chamber may also be used as an entry lock, and to decompress occupants who may need to leave before scheduled.

===Mating flange for transportable chamber===
One or more of the external doors may be provided with a mating flange or collar to suit a portable or transportable chamber, which can be used to evacuate a diver under pressure. The closed bell can be used for this purpose, but lighter and more easily portable chambers are also available. There will usually also be a mating flange for the hyperbaric rescue and escape system.

===Supply lock===

A small lock, also known as an equipment lock or medical lock, is used for transfer of supplies into and out of the pressurized system. This would normally include food, medical supplies, clothing, bedding etc.

===Trunking===
The pressurised compartments of the system are connected through access trunking: relatively short and small diameter bolted between the external flanges of the larger compartments, with pressure seals, forming passageways between the chambers, which can be isolated by pressure doors.

==Auxiliary and support equipment==

===Life support systems===

The life support system provides breathing gas and other services to support life for the personnel under pressure. It includes the following components:
* Breathing gas supply, distribution and recycling equipment: scrubbers, filters, boosters, compressors, mixing, monitoring, and storage facilities
* Chamber climate control system – control of temperature and humidity, and filtration of gas
* Instrumentation, control, monitoring and communications equipment
* Fire suppression systems
* Sanitation systems

The life support system for the bell provides and monitors the main supply of breathing gas, and the control station monitors the deployment and communications with the divers. Primary gas supply, power and communications to the bell are through a bell umbilical, made up from a number of hoses and electrical cables twisted together and deployed as a unit. This is extended to the divers through the diver umbilicals (excursion umbilical]]s).
The accommodation life support system maintains the chamber environment within the acceptable range for health and comfort of the occupants. Temperature, humidity, breathing gas quality sanitation systems and equipment function are monitored and controlled.

====Life support system operation====

The life support system is operated by the life-support technicians under the life-support supervisor, who are part of the saturation diving team. There will be at least two life support technicians working shifts, as one must be on duty at all times while there are divers under pressure.
===Hot water system===

Divers working in cold water, particularly when breathing helium-based gases (which increase the rate of heat transfer), may rapidly lose body heat and suffer from hypothermia. Hypothermia is unhealthy, can be life-threatening, and reduces diver effectiveness. This can be ameliorated with a hot water system. A diver hot water system heats filtered seawater and pumps it to the divers through the bell and diver umbilicals. This water can be used to heat the breathing gas before it is inhaled. The divers breathing gas is mainly heated on dives below 150 metres, and the region will dictate what temperature the water is heated to so that it will then flow through the diver&#x27;s hot water suit to keep the diver warm.

===Emergency heating of the bell===

There is a need for emergency heating of divers trapped in a closed diving bell. The breathing gas may be helium based, at a high pressure, and the ambient water temperature may be quite low, down to 2 °C, with a typical temperature in the North Sea of about 5 °C. The bell itself is usually made of steel, a good thermal conductor, and the quality of bell insulation is variable, so the internal atmosphere tends to match the water temperature fairly soon after the primary heating fails. Divers trapped in bells for long periods have been subjected to various degrees of hypothermia when the primary heating systems failed. There have been deaths attributed to this cause.

Passive systems were the first to be developed to a stage where they were considered functionally sufficient, and are relatively simple, economical and immediately available, and are used as standard equipment when applicable. Personal insulation for the diver, in the form of an insulated bag, combined with a breathing gas heat exchanger to conserve the heat of exhaled gas, and heat liberated by a personal carbon dioxide scrubber kept within the insulation layer round the diver is usually sufficient to keep the divers in thermal balance while waiting for rescue. The scrubber has an orinasal mask, and the bag is secured to the inside of the bell by a harness, to prevent the diver from collapsing if rendered unconscious, and potentially blocking access to the bell by rescuers.

===Communication systems===

Helium and high pressure both cause hyperbaric distortion of speech. The process of talking underwater is influenced by the internal geometry of the life support equipment and constraints on the communications systems as well as the physical and physiological influences of the environment on the processes of speaking and vocal sound production. The use of breathing gases under pressure or containing helium causes problems in intelligibility of diver speech due to distortion caused by the different speed of sound in the gas and the different density of the gas compared to air at surface pressure. These parameters induce changes in the vocal tract formants, which affect the timbre, and a slight change of pitch. Several studies indicate that the loss in intelligibility is mainly due to the change in the formants.

The difference in density of the breathing gas causes a non-linear shift of low-pitch vocal resonance, due to resonance shifts in the vocal cavities, giving a nasal effect, and a linear shift of vocal resonances which is a function of the velocity of sound in the gas, known as the Donald Duck effect. Another effect of higher density is the relative increase in intensity of voiced sounds relative to unvoiced sounds. The contrast between closed and open voiced sounds and the contrast between voiced consonants and adjacent vowels decrease with increased pressure. Change of the speed of sound is relatively large in relation to depth increase at shallower depths, but this effect reduces as the pressure increases, and at greater depths a change in depth makes a smaller difference. Helium speech unscramblers are a partial technical solution. They improve intelligibility of transmitted speech to surface personnel.

The communications system may have four component systems.
* The hardwired intercom system, an amplified voice system with speech unscrambler to reduce the pitch of the speech of the occupants of the pressurized system. This system will provide communications between the main control console and the bell and accommodation chambers. This two-way system is the primary communications mode.
* Wireless through-water communications between bell and main control console is a backup system in case of failure of the hardwired system with the bell.
* Closed circuit video from cameras on the bell and diver helmets allow visual monitoring of the dive and the divers by the supervisor.
* A sound powered phone system may be provided as a backup voice communication system between bell and control console

===Breathing gas===


====Bulk gas supplies====

Gas storage and blending equipment are provided to pressurize and flush the system, and treatment gases should be available appropriate to the planned storage depths. Bulk stock of premixed gas is usually provided to suit the planned depth of the operation, and separate bulk stock of helium and oxygen to make up additional requirements, adjust chamber gas composition as the oxygen is used up, and mix decompression gas.

Bulk gas is usually stored in manifolded groups of storage cylinders known as &quot;quads&quot;, which usually carry about 16 high pressure cylinders, each of about 50 litres internal volume mounted on a frame for ease of transport, or larger frames carrying larger capacity high pressure &quot;tubes&quot;. These tube frames are usually designed to be handled by intermodal container handling equipment, so are usually made in one of the standard sizes for intermodal containers.

====Gas distribution====

====Gas reclaim systems====

A helium reclaim system (or push-pull system) may be used to recover helium based breathing gas after use by the divers as this is more economical than losing it to the environment in open circuit systems. The recovered gas is passed through a scrubber system to remove carbon dioxide, filtered to remove odours and other impurities, and pressurised into storage containers, where it may be mixed with oxygen to the required composition. Alternatively the recycled gas can be more directly recirculated to the divers.

During extended diving operations very large amounts of breathing gas are used. Helium is an expensive gas and can be difficult to source and supply to offshore vessels in some parts of the world. A closed circuit gas reclaim system can save around 80% of gas costs by recovering about 90% of the helium based breathing mixture. Reclaim also reduces the amount of gas storage required on board, which can be important where storage capacity is limited. Reclaim systems are also used to recover gas discharged from the saturation system during decompression.

A reclaim system will typically consist of the following components:

Topside components:
* A reclaim control console, which controls and monitors the booster pump, oxygen addition, diver supply pressure, exhaust hose pressure and make-up gas addition.
* A gas reprocessing unit, with low-pressure carbon dioxide scrubber towers, filters&#x27; receivers and back-pressure regulator which will remove carbon dioxide and excess moisture in a condensation water trap. Other gases and odours can be removed by activated carbon filters.
* A gas booster, to boost the pressure of the reclaimed gas to the storage pressure.
* A gas volume tank
* A storage system of pressure vessels to hold the boosted and reconstituted gas mixture until it is used. This functions as a buffer to allow for the variations of gas volume in the rest of the system due to pressure changes.
* Dive control panel
* A bell gas supply panel, to control the supply of gas to the bell.
Underwater components:
* The bell umbilical, with the supply and exhaust hoses between the topside system and the bell.
* Internal bell gas panel to supply the gas to the divers, and bell reclaim equipment, which controls the exhaust hose back-pressure, and can shut off the reclaim hose if the diver&#x27;s gas supply is interrupted. A scrubber for the bell atmosphere and water trap would be included.
* Diver excursion umbilicals, with supply and exhaust hoses between the bell and the divers
* Reclaim helmets which supply gas to the divers on demand, with reclaim back-pressure regulators which exhaust the exhaled gas to the return line.
* Bell back-pressure regulator with water trap

In operation the gas supply from the reclaim system is connected to the topside gas panel, with a backup supply at a slightly lower pressure from mixed gas storage which will automatically cut in if the reclaim supply pressure drops. The bellman will set onboard gas supply to a slightly lower pressure than surface supply pressure to the bell gas panel, so that it will automatically cut in if surface supply is lost. After locking out of the bell the diver will close the diverter valve and open the return valve on the helmet, to start the gas reclaim process. Once this is running, the reclaim control panel will be adjusted to make up the metabolic oxygen usage of the diver into the returned gas. This system will automatically shut down oxygen addition if the flow of exhaled gas from the diver fails, to avoid an excessive oxygen fraction in the recycled gas. There is an indicator light to show whether the return gas is flowing.

The gas supplied to the diver&#x27;s helmet passes through the same hoses and demand valve as for the open circuit system, but the exhaled gas passes out into the reclaim valve at slightly above ambient pressure, which is considerably above atmospheric pressure, so the flow must be controlled to prevent dropping the helmet internal pressure and causing the demand valve to free-flow. This is achieved by using back-pressure regulators to control the pressure drop in stages. The reclaim valve itself is a demand triggered back-pressure regulator, and there is another back pressure regulator at the bell gas panel, and one at the surface before the receiver tanks. Each of these back-pressure regulators is set to allow about a 1 bar pressure drop.

Exhaust gas returns to the bell through the diver&#x27;s umbilical exhaust hose, where it passes through a water separator and trap then through a back-pressure regulator which controls the pressure in the exhaust hose and which can be monitored on a pressure gauge in the bell and adjusted by the bellman to suit the excursion depth of the diver. The gas then passes through the bell umbilical exhaust hose to the surface via a non-return valve and another water trap. When the gas enters the surface unit it goes through a coalescing water separator and micron particle filter, and a float valve, which protects the reclaim system from large volumes of water in the event of a leak at depth. Another back-pressure regulator at the surface controls the pressure in the bell umbilical. The gas then passes into the receiver tanks, where oxygen is added at a flow rate calculated to compensate for metabolic use by the diver.

Before entering the boosters, the gas passes through a 0.1 micron filter. The gas is then boosted to storage pressure. Redundant boosters are provided to keep the system running while a booster is serviced. The boosters are automatically controlled to match the diver&#x27;s gas consumption, and the boosted gas passes through a scrubber where the carbon dioxide is removed by a material like sodalime. Like the boosters, there are at least two scrubbers in parallel, so that they can be isolated, vented and repacked alternately while the system remains in operation. The gas then passes through a cooling heat exchanger to condense out any remaining moisture, which is removed by another 1 micon coalescing filter before it reaches the volume storage tank, where it remains until returned to the gas panel to be used by the divers. While in the volume tank, the gas can be analysed to ensure that it is suitable for re-use, and that the oxygen fraction is correct and carbon dioxide has been removed to specification before it is delivered to the divers. If necessary any lost gas can be compensated by topping up the volume tank from the high pressure storage. Gas from the volume tank is fed to the topside gas panel to be routed back to the bell and diver.

===Sanitation system===
The sanitation system includes hot and cold water supply for washbasins and showers, drainage, and marine toilets with holding tank and discharge system.

=== Control consoles ===
It is common for the control room to be installed in an ISO intermode container for convenience of transport. There are three main control panels, for life support, dive control and gas management.

==== Gas management panel ====
The gas management panel includes pressure regulation of gases from high pressure storage, and distribution to the consumers. Gases will include air, oxygen and heliox mixes

==== Saturation control panel ====
The chamber control panel will typically include depth gauges for each compartment, including trunking, blowdown and exhaust valves, oxygen monitoring and other gas analysis equipment, make-up system for oxygen replenishment, valves for supplying therapeutic breathing mixture, closed circuit television monitoring displays, and monitoring systems with alarms for temperature and pressure in the system chambers.

==== Dive control panel ====
The dive control panel will include depth gauges for bell internal and external pressure, diver and bellman depth, and trunking pressure for transfer to the accommodation chambers. There will also be breathing gas pressure gauges and control valves for each diver, and blowdown and exhaust valves for the bell interior, diver communications systems with speech unscramblers, a through-water emergency communications system to the bell, controls, monitors and recording equipment for helmet and bell mounted video cameras, oxygen analysers for diver breathing gas, oxygen and carbon dioxide analysers for bell and reclaim gas, alarms for reclaim gas flow, dynamic positioning and hot water supply.

===Fire suppression system===
Firefighting systems include hand held fire extinguishers to automatic deluge systems. Special fire extinguishers which do not use toxic materials must be used. In the event of a fire, toxic gases may be released by burning materials, and the occupants will have to use the built-in breathing systems (BIBS) until the chamber gas has been flushed sufficiently. When a system with oxygen partial pressure 0.48 bar is pressurized below about 70 msw (231fsw), the oxygen fraction is too low to support combustion (less than 6%), and the fire risk is low. During the early stages of compression and towards the end of decompression the oxygen levels will support combustion, and greater care must be taken.

===Built in breathing systems===

Built in breathing systems are installed for emergency use and for treatment of decompression sickness. They supply breathing gas appropriate to the current function, which is supplied from outside the pressurized system and also vented to the exterior, so the exhaled gases do not contaminate the chamber atmosphere.

===Hyperbaric rescue and escape systems===


A saturated diver who needs to be evacuated in an emergency should preferably be transported without a significant change in their environmental pressure. Hyperbaric evacuation requires pressurised transportation equipment, and could be required in a range of situations:
* The support vessel at risk of capsize or sinking.
* Unacceptable fire or explosion hazard.
* Failure of the hyperbaric life support system.
* A medical problem which cannot be dealt with on site.
* A &quot;lost&quot; bell (a bell which has been broken free of lifting cables and umbilical; the actual position of the bell is usually still known with considerable accuracy).

A hyperbaric lifeboat or rescue chamber may be provided for emergency evacuation of saturation divers from a saturation system. This would be used if the platform is at immediate risk due to fire or sinking, and allows the divers under saturation to get clear of the immediate danger. A hyperbaric lifeboat is self-contained and can be operated by a surface pressure crew while the chamber occupants are under pressure. It must be self-sufficient for several days at sea, in case of a delay in rescue due to sea conditions. It is possible to start decompression after launching if the occupants are medically stable, but seasickness and dehydration may delay the decompression until the module has been recovered.

The rescue chamber or hyperbaric lifeboat will generally be recovered for completion of decompression due to the limited onboard life support and facilities. The recovery plan will include a standby vessel to perform the recovery.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) and International Marine Contractors Association IMCA recognise that though the number of hyperbaric evacuations which have been successfully carried out is small, and the likelihood of an incident needing hyperbaric evacuation is extremely low, the risk is sufficient to justify requiring the equipment to be available. The original meaning for the term &quot;hyperbaric evacuation system&quot; covered the system that actually transported the divers away from the working hyperbaric system such as a hyperbaric rescue chamber, a self-propelled hyperbaric lifeboat, or hyperbaric rescue vessel, all of which float and carry short term life-support systems of varied endurance, but it has more recently come to include all of the equipment that would support a hyperbaric evacuation, such as a life support package that can be connected to a recovered hyperbaric rescue unit, to provide interim life support until decompression facilities are available, and the hyperbaric reception facility where divers can be decompressed and treated in relative comfort. The four main classes of problem that must be managed during a hyperbaric evacuation are thermal balance, motion sickness, dealing with metabolic waste products, and severely cramped and confined conditions.

Bell to bell transfer may be used to rescue divers from a lost or entrapped bell. This will generally occur at or near the bottom, and the divers transfer between bells at ambient water pressure. It is possible in some circumstances to use a bell as a rescue chamber to transport divers from one saturation system to another. This may require temporary modifications to the bell, and is only possible if the mating flanges of the systems are compatible.

Evacuation of a single diver who is medically stable, or a single diver with an attendant, may be possible using a hyperbaric stretcher or a small portable chamber if the duration of the trip is short, the pressure is suitable and the locking flanges are compatible.

==Platforms==

Most saturation diving is done offshore, in the vicinity of drilling and production platforms, or for salvage work, and requires precise positioning of the bell during the dive. In deep water this is usually done from a specialised diving support vessel, or a suitable vessel of opportunity on which a saturation system has been temporarily installed. Positioning can either be by a substantial anchor pattern, which may interfere with other anchoring spreads already established, and which presents its own set of hazards, or by dynamic positioning, which must be sufficiently reliable and fail-safe for the expected conditions.
==Underwater habitats==
Scientific saturation diving is usually conducted by researchers and technicians known as aquanauts living in an underwater habitat, a structure designed for people to live in for extended periods, where they can carry out almost all basic human functions: working, resting, eating, attending to personal hygiene, and sleeping, all while remaining under pressure beneath the surface.

==Depth records==

The diving depth record for offshore diving was achieved in 1988 by a team of professional divers (Th. Arnold, S. Icart, J.G. Marcel Auda, R. Peilho, P. Raude, L. Schneider) of the Comex S.A. industrial deep-sea diving company performing pipe line connection exercises at a depth of 534 meters of sea water (msw) (1752 fsw) in the Mediterranean Sea during a record scientific dive.

In the real working conditions of the offshore oil industry, in Campos Basin, Brazil, Brazilian saturation divers from the DSV &quot;Stena Marianos&quot; (later &quot;Mermaid Commander&quot; (2006)) performed a manifold installation for Petrobras at depth in February 1990. When a lift bag attachment failed, the equipment was carried by the bottom currents to depth, and the Brazilian diver Adelson D&#x27;Araujo Santos Jr. made the recovery and installation.

In 1992, Greek diver Theodoros Mavrostomos of the Comex S.A. achieved a simulated of seawater depth in an on shore hyperbaric chamber. He took 43 days to complete the record experimental dive, where a hydrogen–helium–oxygen gas mixture was used as breathing gas.

The complexity, medical problems and accompanying high costs of professional diving to such extreme depths and the development of deep water atmospheric diving suits and ROVs in offshore oilfield drilling and production have effectively eliminated the need for ambient pressure manned intervention at extreme depths.

==Training and registration==
Training of saturation divers generally takes place at commercial diving schools registered to train saturation divers, and having the required infrastructure and equipment.
Diver training standards for saturation divers are published by a small number of organisations, and there is some international recognition of equivalence. The prerequisites for starting training are generally that the diver is already qualified as a bell diver and has a specified number of dives and hours of experience since qualifying.

Training of saturation divers generally starts with a competent and at least moderately experienced surface oriented bell diver and concentrates on the additional knowledge and skills required for saturation diving. There is a large additional technical component related to the specialised equipment.
For the South African Department of Labour Class I Diver, the additional knowledge and skills include:
* A basic knowledge of the history of mixed gas and saturation diving,
* An understanding of modular and diving support vessel based saturation diving systems, saturation life-support systems including environmental control, diver heating systems, sump drains and hyperbaric toilet discharges
* An understanding and practical operating skills for closed diving bells, their standard and emergency equipment, handling systems, bell and excursion umbilicals and personal diving equipment, and their testing and maintenance requirements,
* An understanding and practical operating skills for transfer under pressure and closed bell diving from 4-point moored and dynamically positioned vessels
* An understanding of gas supplies and saturation consumables, including minimum gas requirements, gas transfer pumps, gas blending, and gas reclaim systems,
* An understanding and practical experience in committing divers to saturation, and pressurisation
* An understanding of split level saturation diving
* Knowledge of the minimum personnel requirements for saturation diving operations and the responsibilities of the diving team members, including the superintendent, supervisor, life support supervisor, life support technician, support and systems technicians, gas man, and the bellman and diver, and experience and skills as diver and bellman
* Knowledge of saturation decompression procedures, emergency saturation decompression and hyperbaric evacuation and practical experience of standard procedures and simulated emergency procedures.
* Certification as a level 2 first aider, with additional knowledge of saturation hygiene, saturation first aid requirements and the deep diving compression disorders, high pressure nervous syndrome and compression arthralgia.

==Safety and risk==

The purpose of saturation diving is to extend the useful working time for dives without increasing the exposure to risk of decompression sickness. There is a trade-off against other risks associated with living under high-pressure saturation conditions, and the financial cost is high due to the complex infrastructure and expensive equipment and consumables required. The risk of decompression sickness is reduced at the cost of increased risk due to being committed to the saturation environment for the duration of the decompression schedule associated with the storage depth. Hyperbaric evacuation from saturation is possible, but not universally available, and is logistically complicated. Having an evacuation system on standby is expensive.

Some notable saturation diving incidents include:
* 
* 
* 
* &quot;Bibby Topaz&quot; diving accident, documented by the 2019 film &quot;Last Breath&quot;

==Working conditions==

The living and working conditions of the saturation diver are unusual. There are shifting demands and large contrasts. The diver is required to be adaptable to the variations in work and coworkers, and to do so for several weeks at a time. The future of the occupation is uncertain and linked to the oil and gas industry. The work environment and living conditions on contract tend to be monotonous, but they are interspersed with periods of leisure. There is a conflict between family commitments and extended work periods in relative isolation, but in the continuous close proximity with a small group of co-workers. The job is prestigious, the pay is good and there are fairly long periods of leisure between jobs. The occupation needs mental endurance, flexibility and willingness to adapt and learn. Maintaining personal routines may help in maintaining mental health. The quality of the team can have a large effect on the members. The ability to get along well with each other and mutual trust are important to cooperation and efficiency in a group who depend on each other for safety and sometimes for survival. A sense of humour is an advantage though there is a tendency for this to be relatively dark, possibly due to the high risk environment.

==In arts and media==

For saturation diving in fiction, see &quot;Pressure&quot; (2015), &quot;The Abyss&quot; (1989), &quot;Sphere&quot; (1987), &quot;Goliath Awaits&quot; (1981), &quot;Dykket (The Dive)&quot; (1989), &quot;Pioneer (Pionér)&quot; (2013) and &quot;The Neptune Factor&quot; (1973).

In 2019, Netflix released &quot;Last Breath&quot;, a documentary which tells the story of Chris Lemons, a saturation diver who survived 38 minutes without a surface-supplied breathing gas supply after the vessel&#x27;s dynamic positioning system failed during a storm, setting off a red alert. The two working divers started returning to the bell, but the ship drifted from the work site, dragging the bell with it, and his umbilical was snagged and severed under the load. He was able to return to the workplace using his bailout set, so was easily found by an ROV from the ship, but his bailout gas was insufficient for the time it took to get the ship back on position for a rescue attempt from the bell. Although presumed dead by support crew aboard the vessel, he was recovered by the second diver and successfully resuscitated in the bell. It has been hypothesised that his survival may have been a result of hypothermia, high partial pressure of oxygen in the bailout gas, or a combination. The ROV video footage shows him twitching while unconscious, which is consistent with an oxygen toxicity blackout.

<doc id="489947" wikidata="Q7847760" url="?curid=489947" title="Trump (magazine)">
<text>Trump was a glossy magazine of satire and humor, mostly in the forms of comics features and short stories. It was edited by Harvey Kurtzman and published by Hugh Hefner, with only two issues produced in 1957. The first issue appeared in January 1957 and the second came out in March. The magazine&#x27;s mascot was a trumpeter herald in the style of John Tenniel&#x27;s &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; illustrations.
Kurtzman began work on &quot;Trump&quot; shortly after leaving &quot;Mad&quot; following a break with its publisher William M. Gaines. &quot;Mad&quot; also lost two of its top cartoonists in the dispute&#x27;s aftermath, when Will Elder and Jack Davis chose to follow Kurtzman. Wally Wood was also recruited for the &quot;Trump&quot; team in the form of an either-or option, but he chose to stay at &quot;Mad&quot;. Other notable artists, including Al Jaffee and Arnold Roth, appeared in &quot;Trump&quot;.

==Production==
Sales were reportedly good for &quot;Trump&quot;, especially for a new title with a 50-cent cover price, then considered high. But the project was ill-fated. The magazine featured glossy (and costly) production standards and had the misfortune of debuting at the same time that a financial crunch forced publisher Hefner to scale back his non-&quot;Playboy&quot; publishing interests. This put an end to &quot;Trump&quot; before the magazine ever got the chance to develop a steady readership.

Speaking about the magazine&#x27;s short run later, Hefner said, &quot;I gave Harvey an unlimited budget, and he exceeded it.&quot;

==Aftermath==

Kurtzman spearheaded additional humorous publications such as &quot;Humbug&quot; and &quot;Help!&quot;. Kurtzman and Elder continued to work at &quot;Playboy&quot; for another three decades, chiefly producing &quot;Little Annie Fanny&quot;, which made use of copious sight gags. Jack Davis became a top freelancer for advertising agencies and various magazines, including a return to &quot;Mad&quot; in 1965.&#x27;

<text>11 Downing Street in London, also known colloquially in the United Kingdom as Number 11, is the official residence of the Chancellor of the Exchequer (who traditionally also has the title of Second Lord of the Treasury). The residence, in Downing Street in London, was built alongside the official residence of the Prime Minister at Number 10 in 1682.

The first Chancellor to live there was Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice in 1806, but Number 11 did not become the Chancellor&#x27;s official residence until 1828.

From 1997 to 2022, prime ministers Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson chose to reside for all or part of their term of office in the flat above Number 11, as its residential apartment is larger than at Number 10. Rishi Sunak broke with this by resuming residence in the smaller flat above Number 10. Current Prime Minister Keir Starmer, his wife Victoria, and their two children are expected to live above Number 11.

==Background==
Number 11 is part of a (blackened) yellow-brick Georgian-era converted mansion. The building overlooks St. James&#x27;s Park and Horse Guards Parade and consists—from left to right—of Numbers 12, 11 and 10.

Number 11 is located on the left side of Number 10, the official residence of the Prime Minister (or First Lord of the Treasury) since the early 19th century. Number 12, to the left of Number 11, is the official residence of the Chief Whip, but it is now used as the Prime Minister&#x27;s press office.

As a result of many internal alterations over the years, the three terraced houses are internally a single complex; one can walk from number 11 to number 10, via an internal connecting door, without using the street doors. The Cabinet Office on Whitehall is also directly connected to these at its rear making up an executive office of the prime Minister and senior Privy Councillors.

The terraced house was one of several built by Sir George Downing between 1682 and 1684 to designs by Christopher Wren. It was altered c. 1723–35; refaced c. 1766–75 by Kenton Couse and with early C.19 alterations. Along with Number 10, it underwent a major reconstruction by Raymond Erith, 1960–64. Despite reconstruction, the interior retains a fine staircase with carved bracket tread ends and three slender turned balusters per tread. The fine Dining Room of 1825–26 is by Sir John Soane.

==Recent occupancy==
When Tony Blair became Prime Minister in 1997 he chose to reside in Number 11, rather than Number 10, as it has a larger living area; Blair was living with his wife and their several young children, while Gordon Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, was still a bachelor. In 2007, when Brown became Prime Minister, he at first chose to live in Number 11, but soon moved back to Number 10.

Following the 2010 general election, the incoming prime minister, David Cameron, moved into 11, and George Osborne chose to remain in his Notting Hill home. In early August 2011, Osborne moved into Number 10.

Boris Johnson lived in Number 11, instead of his first and second Chancellor (Sajid Javid and Rishi Sunak, respectively). In March 2020, Johnson refurbished the residential apartment at Number 11. An Electoral Commission inquiry investigated the financing of this refurbishment. This was known in the press as the Cash-for-Curtains scandal.

Rishi Sunak broke with this by resuming residence in the smaller flat above Number 10.

<text>Yevgeny Aleksandrovich Kafelnikov (; born 18 February 1974) is a Russian former professional tennis player. He was ranked as the world No. 1 in men&#x27;s singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP). Kafelnikov won 26 ATP Tour-level singles titles, including two majors at the 1996 French Open and the 1999 Australian Open, as well as an Olympic gold medal at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. He also won four major doubles titles (three at the French Open and one at the US Open), and is the most recent man to have won both the men&#x27;s singles and doubles titles at the same major, which he achieved at the 1996 French Open. In 2019, Kafelnikov was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.

==Career==
In his breakthrough year in 1994, Kafelnikov won three titles, reached the Hamburg Masters final and beat world top-5 players on six occasions. His ranking rose from 102 at the beginning of the year, to a year-end ranking of 11.

In 1995, he reached his first Grand Slam semifinals, beating world No. 1, Andre Agassi, in straight sets in the quarterfinals. He also defeated three top-10 players (Michael Stich, Goran Ivanisevic and Boris Becker) on his way to the title in Milan.

At the 1996 French Open, Kafelnikov became the first Russian to ever win a Grand Slam title, defeating Michael Stich in the final in straight sets, having beaten world No. 1, Pete Sampras, in the semifinals.

Kafelnikov was finalist at the 1997 ATP Tour World Championships, and won three titles during that season. In doubles, he won both the French Open and US Open partnering Daniel Vacek.

At the 1999 Australian Open, 10th seed Kafelnikov won his second singles Grand Slam title, defeating Thomas Enqvist in the final in four sets. He also won in Rotterdam and Moscow, was runner-up at the Canadian Open and reached the semifinals of the US Open.

Seeded fifth, Kafelnikov won the gold medal in the men&#x27;s singles tournament at the 2000 Olympic Games, beating second seed Gustavo Kuerten in the quarterfinals and Tommy Haas in the final in five sets. He also reached the final of the Australian Open and the quarterfinals of the French Open.

In 2001, he defeated world No. 1 Gustavo Kuerten in the quarterfinals of the US Open for the loss of just seven games, before losing to Lleyton Hewitt in the semifinals. Kafelnikov was also a finalist at the Paris Masters, quarterfinalist at the Australian Open and French Open, and won a record fifth consecutive title in Moscow.

Kafelnikov won his fourth and final doubles Grand Slam at the French Open in 2002, partnering Paul Haarhuis, and his final career singles title, in Tashkent. He was also a member of Russia&#x27;s Davis Cup-winning team in 2002.

Kafelnikov played his last ATP Tour match in October 2003 (in St Petersburg). In total, he won 53 titles across singles and doubles during his career, and he remains the last male player to win both singles and doubles titles at the same grand slam.

==Post-retirement==
Since retiring from tennis, Kafelnikov cashed three times at the 2005 World Series of Poker. He also played golf on the European Tour at the 2005, 2008, 2013, 2014 and 2015 Russian Open, 2012, 2013 and 2014 Austrian Open, and the 2014 Czech Masters, plus several Challenge Tour events, without making any cuts. During the 2008 Miami Masters, Kafelnikov coached Marat Safin (in the absence of Safin&#x27;s usual coach, Hernán Gumy). In 2009 and 2010, he participated in the ATP Champions Tour (for retired ATP-professional tennis players), finishing in third place in tournaments in Chengdu, Bogotá and São Paulo.

Kafelnikov was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2019, not counting enough votes in his previous nominations in 2012 (compared to Gustavo Kuerten and Jennifer Capriati), in 2015 (compared to David Hall and Amélie Mauresmo), and in 2018 (compared to Michael Stich and Helena Suková). In May 2017, Kafelnikov was extensively interviewed by the most popular Russian website Sports.ru considering his current political preferences. In August 2020, Kafelnikov announced his plans to settle in [Western / old] Europe.

In March 2021, Kafelnikov faced another wave of rumors about his retirement in 2003 as really being caused by ATP&#x27;s desire to avoid a betting scandal considering his match in Lyon against Fernando Vicente. Russian volleyball player Aleksey Spiridonov said in an interview: &quot;Kafelnikov is corrupt. He made bets against himself during his career. And then he finished abruptly when being grabbed by the ass. I know. My friends work in the offices. And someone in an interview also said that Kafelnikov offered him to bet against himself and lose the match. Who pinned him down? There was no [powerful] tennis federation back then. I think, the gangsters&quot;. One week after his match in 2003, Kafelnikov said about the accusations: &quot;This is a complete bullshit, but now in the locker room, they [players] look at me like at an enemy of the people. Even in my country where I have always been a role model they [people] have begun to look at me that way. I talked to Fernando and he said his mother was crying on the phone because of this. Those who made this mess should be punished. The article says Kafelnikov has been involved in match-fixing and it rips me to pieces. I do not want to be associated with betting in any way&quot;.

To a lesser extent, the player has been commemorated for his outspoken jealousy towards the much more impressive incomes of golf players in general, if compared to his colleagues in tennis. Lindsay Davenport correspondingly voiced some support for Kafelnikov&#x27;s claim who was also worried &quot;it would be a shame to see the public lose sympathy in me just because I am making such a statement&quot;. In January 2001, during the 2001 Australian Open, he concluded: &quot;If you look at the golfers, we are taking an extreme example now, of course, the golfers make $540,000 a week to the winner. And this is the lowest tournament that they have on the U.S. Tour. If you look at the tennis players, to win a tournament, win five matches [at the] absolutely lowest level tournament you make only $42,000. I think it is quite bizarre to see that kind of money in a tennis game.&quot;

<doc id="489965" wikidata="Q220604" url="?curid=489965" title="Black ice">
<text>Black ice, sometimes called clear ice, is a coating of glaze ice on a surface, for example on streets or on lakes. The ice itself is not black, but visually transparent, allowing the often black road below to be seen through it and light to be transmitted. The typically low levels of noticeable ice pellets, snow, or sleet surrounding black ice means that areas of the ice are often next to invisible to drivers or people walking on it. Thus, there is a risk of slippage and subsequent accident due to the unexpected loss of traction.

== Definitions ==
The term &quot;black ice&quot; in the United States is defined by the National Weather Service as &quot;patchy ice on roadways or other transportation surfaces that cannot easily be seen. It is often clear (not white) with the black road surface visible underneath. It is most prevalent during the early morning hours, especially after snowmelt on the roadways has a chance to refreeze overnight when the temperature drops below freezing. Black ice can also form when roadways are slick from rain and temperatures drop below freezing overnight.&quot;

The World Meteorological Organization definitions of black ice are:

*A popular alternative for the term &quot;glaze&quot;. A thin sheet of ice, relatively dark in appearance, may form when light rain or drizzle falls on a road surface that is at a temperature below freezing point or, alternatively, when water already on the road surface subsequently freezes when its temperature falls below freezing point. It may also be formed when supercooled fog droplets are intercepted by buildings, fences, and vegetation.
*Thin, new ice on freshwater or saltwater, appearing dark in color because of its transparency, a result of its columnar grain structure.

==Formation==

===On roads and pavements===
The American Meteorological Society Glossary of Meteorology includes the definition of black ice as &quot;a thin sheet of ice, relatively dark in appearance, [that] may form when light rain or drizzle falls on a road surface that is at a temperature below .&quot; Because it represents only a thin accumulation, black ice is highly transparent and thus difficult to see compared with snow, frozen slush, or thicker ice layers. In addition, it is often interleaved with wet pavement, which is nearly identical in appearance.
This condition makes driving, cycling or walking on affected surfaces extremely dangerous. Deicing with salt (sodium chloride) is effective down to temperatures of about . Other compounds such as magnesium chloride or calcium chloride have been used for extremely cold temperatures since the freezing-point depression of their solutions is lower.

At lower temperatures (below ), black ice can form on roadways when the moisture from automobile exhaust, such as motorcycles and cars, condenses on the road surface. 

Such conditions caused multiple accidents in Minnesota when the temperatures dipped below that point for a prolonged period of time in mid-December 2008. Salt&#x27;s ineffectiveness at melting ice at these temperatures compounds the problem. Black ice may form even when the ambient temperature is several degrees above the freezing point of water , if the air warms suddenly after a prolonged cold spell that has left the surface of the roadway well below the freezing point of water.

On December 1, 2013, heavy post-Thanksgiving weekend traffic encountered black ice on the westbound I-290 expressway in Worcester, Massachusetts. A chain reaction series of crashes resulted, involving three tractor-trailers and over 60 other vehicles. The ice formed suddenly on a long downward slope, surprising drivers coming over the crest of a hill, who could not see crashed vehicles ahead until it was too late to stop on the slick pavement.

On February 11, 2021, icing in Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas, contributed to a crash on I-35W which authorities called a &quot;mass casualty event&quot;. Over 100 cars were involved in the pileup and multiple fatalities were reported.

===On bridges===

Bridges and overpasses can be especially dangerous. Black ice forms first on bridges and overpasses because air can circulate both above and below the surface of the elevated roadway when the ambient temperature drops, causing the pavement temperature on the bridge to fall rapidly.

====Case study in Minnesota====

The I-35W Mississippi River bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota, was well known for its black ice before it collapsed in 2007 into the Mississippi River. It had caused several pileups during its 40-year life. On December 19, 1985, the temperature reached . Cars crossing the bridge experienced black ice and there was a massive pile up of crashed vehicles on the bridge on the northbound side. In February and in December 1996, the bridge was identified as the single most treacherous cold-weather spot in the local freeway system, because of the almost frictionless thin layer of black ice that regularly formed when temperatures dropped below freezing. The bridge&#x27;s proximity to Saint Anthony Falls contributed significantly to the icing problem and the site was noted for frequent spinouts and collisions.

By January 1999, Mn/DOT began testing magnesium chloride solutions and a mixture of magnesium chloride and a corn-processing byproduct to see whether either would reduce the black ice that appeared on the bridge during the winter months. In October 1999, the state embedded temperature-activated nozzles in the bridge deck to spray the bridge with potassium acetate solution to keep the area free of winter black ice. The system came into operation in 2000.

===On water===
When the temperature is below freezing and the wind is calm, such as under high atmospheric pressure at night in the fall, a thin layer of ice will form over open water of a lake. If the depth of the body of water is large enough, its color is black and can be seen through the ice, thus the name black ice. On lakes, black ice is also commonly overlain by white ice formed from refrozen snow or slush towards spring. Black ice transmits more light than white ice which can be important for primary producers in lakes, such as phytoplankton. Black ice has a higher bearing capacity than white ice which is important to consider for ice safety reasons when doing recreational activities on lakes, such as ice skating and ice fishing.

Ice can also be formed by seawater spray and water vapour freezing upon contact with a vessel&#x27;s superstructure when temperature is low enough. Ice formed in this manner is known as &quot;rime&quot;. As the formation progress, the aboveboard weight of the vessel increases and may ultimately cause capsizing. Furthermore, rime ice may impede the correct functioning of important navigational instruments on board, such as radar or radio installations. Different strategies for the removal of such ice are employed: chipping away the ice or even using fire hoses in an attempt to remove the ice.

===In mountains===

Black ice is a significant hazard for climbers and scramblers. Cold weather is common at high altitudes, and black ice quickly forms on rock surfaces. Loss of traction is as sudden and unexpected as on a pavement or road, but can be dangerous if the rock is in an exposed position with a drop below. An ice-axe and crampons are essential use in such circumstances as they will help to prevent a fall, and a belay rope will help to arrest a fall.

<text>Aldbury () is a village and civil parish in Hertfordshire, England, near the borders of Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire in the Bulbourne valley of the Chiltern Hills, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The nearest towns are Tring and Berkhamsted. Uphill from the narrow valley are the Bridgewater monument and the Ashridge Estate, a country estate owned and managed by the National Trust. 

Aldbury is designated as a conservation area, with most of the land surrounding the village unaltered since the late medieval period. The village is a popular filming location, retaining several archetypical historical features: in the centre is a green and pond; close by stand well-preserved stocks and a whipping-post, and the Church of Saint John the Baptist.

The village has a lively community life, including a number of local societies and clubs. Residents are kept updated on village events through the &quot;Aldbury Outlook&quot;, a magazine published by local residents ten times a year. It has a village shop and post office, two pubs, three cafés, a Church of England primary school, a sports ground and tennis court, as well as the nearby Stocks Golf Club.

Aldbury&#x27;s picturesque setting and proximity to Tring railway station makes it one of the most desirable places to live in Hertfordshire. It has been referred to as a &quot;chocolate-box&quot; village due to its traditional appearance.

==History==
The manor was recorded as Aldeberie in the 1086 Domesday Book. The public house, &quot;The Valiant Trooper&quot;, served as an ale house for centuries, the first traceable evidence dated to 1752.
The wooded slope towards the Bridgewater Monument is one of the steepest ascents in Hertfordshire, crowned by a ridge at one of the five highest elevations in the county. Monuments in the church witness the importance of certain manorial families including the family of Sir Ralph Verney (1546), who have the northern chapel in the church, and the similarly landed family of Thomas Hyde (1570) and his son George (1580). Aldbury was the home of Sir Guy de Gravade, known as the Wizard of Aldbury, who was reputed to be able to turn base metals into gold.

To the northwest of Aldbury, Aldbury Nowers forms part of the Chiltern Hills. It is traversed by The Ridgeway ancient tracks and by two sections of Grim&#x27;s Ditch, a linear earthwork dating from the Iron Age.

===Etymology===
The name &#x27;Aldbury&#x27; is derived from the Old English &quot;ald&quot; (old) &quot;burh&quot; (fortification).

===Aldbury Manor===
In the time of Edward the Confessor Aldbury Manor was held by Alwin, a thegn of the king, and by 1086 was in the hands of Robert, Count of Mortain. Throughout most of the Norman period the manor was held &quot;of the honour&quot; (with part rent due to) of the manor of Berkhamsted. Various lower nobles followed until it was held in the 1530s under a Dynham family trust by a wife of William Fitzwilliam (Sheriff of London). Shares created became acquired by John Hyde of Hyde, Dorset an officer of the Court of Exchequer who had a lease of the manor and died in 1545.
In 1665, Sir Thomas Hyde, whose family had held the main manor for more than 100 years, died leaving the estate to his only daughter, Bridget. She married Peregrine Osborne, 2nd Duke of Leeds; whose family held the estate until Thomas Osborne, 4th Duke of Leeds sold it to Scroop Egerton, 1st Duke of Bridgewater. After further subdivision, the remaining manor descended to Francis Henry, ninth and last earl of Bridgewater, whose widow held it for life. At her death, it passed to John Hume Cust, Viscount Alford, eldest son of the first Earl Brownlow, and so finally to the 3rd Earl in 1867. He died in 1921 without leaving an heir (at which point the earldom and viscountcy became extinct). The lordship of the manor appears then to have passed to his second cousin, Adelbert, the 5th Baron and 8th Baronet Brownlow (d.1927); as in 1935, the then Lord of the Manor, Lord Brownlow (presumably Adelbert&#x27;s son, the 6th Baron (9th Bart) Brownlow, d.1978), is reported to have conveyed &quot;by deed of gift&quot; the village green to the Aldbury Parish Council.
A few of the court rolls of the manor are held at the Public Record Office, now part of the National Archives).

===Stocks House or Stocks Manor (anciently &quot;la Stok&quot;)===
Landowner William de Mandeville held land at &quot;la Stock&#x27; in Aldbury around 1176–1177. Records exist of a Henry de Bohun who was a knight in the service of King Henry III&#x27;s son, Prince Edward, and uncle of Humphrey de Bohun, 3rd Earl of Hereford and of Essex. In 1277–1278, the men of Stocks were ordered to come de Bohun&#x27;s view of frankpledge at Amersham (&quot;Agmondesham&quot;) in Buckinghamshire. In 1278 de Bohun was granted the manors of Amersham and Nuthampstead by his nephew Humphrey. Henry may be the same Sir Henry de Bohun who was killed at the Battle of Bannockburn by the Scottish king Robert the Bruce in 1214. The land at Stocks belonged to a John de la Stock, who died in 1270. Records of feudal duties show that the land was held by a Master Henry Sampson in 1273. The last mention of Stocks until the 17th century appears when Philip de Aylesbury granted a piece of land called &quot;Stockyngge&quot; to William de Dunhamstede in 1318.

After a gap there are references from the 17th century of the land being in the possession of Robert Duncombe, an ancestor of the Lords Feversham. In 1773, Arnold Duncombe built a new house, Stocks House. The estate then passed successively to the Hayton, Whitbread and Gordon families.

An heir to the Stocks estate, James Adam Gordon (d.1854), was a friend of the Scottish author Sir Walter Scott, and it is reputed that the writer visited Gordon at Stocks House. Gordon&#x27;s widow, Emma Katherine, married the politician Richard Bright, who died at Stocks in 1878. Emma Katherine died in 1891, and left the estate to Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey, as a descendant of Samuel Whitbread. He shortly afterwards sold the house, as all that remained, to the author Mary Augusta Ward, whose husband was also a writer, Thomas Humphry Ward. While the Wards lived at Stocks, it became a bustling literary salon, welcoming leading intellectuals and writers of the day, including their nephews Aldous Huxley and Julian Huxley, their son-in-law George Macaulay Trevelyan, and Eric Blair (George Orwell). Mary Ward died in 1920 and Stocks was inherited by her son, politician Arnold Ward.

In 1944, Stocks was turned into a girls&#x27; school. Stocks House achieved some notoriety when in 1972 it was purchased by Victor Lownes, an owner of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, who hosted lavish, rowdy parties there, staffed by scantily-clad bunny girls. The parties were attended by a number of celebrities of the day including Peter Cook, John Cleese, Christopher Reeve, Jack Nicholson, Keith Moon and Tony Curtis. After Lownes&#x27;s death, the house was sold and became a hotel and golf course. Today it is the home of racehorse trainer Walter Swinburn.

===Launcelene&#x27;s Manor===
This consisted of of general land, of meadow and 5 shillings rent and was held in 1361 of the heir of Roger Launcelene in free socage for the service of one pair of white s. John, son of William Aignel, died seised of this manor in 1361 and from this time it appears to have descended with the manor of Pendley in Tring.

===Cherrywicke Manor (reputed as a manor)===
Robert Dogget bought land in Aldbury from Edward Verney in 1557, described as a manor in 1615, Edward Dogget sold the actual manor to Francis Bellingham, though parcels near the churchlands were held by John Dogget in 1638.

===1954 Valetta accident===

On 6 January 1954, a Royal Air Force Vickers Valetta twin-engine training aircraft crashed at Tom&#x27;s Hill, just south of the village. Of the 17 airmen on board, 16 were killed.

==Notable buildings==
===Parish Church===

The Parish Church of Saint John the Baptist is of Early English style. In 1203 the church was granted to the Canons of the Priory of St. Mary, Missenden by William de Brocland. Parts of the chancel and nave are 13th century in origin, thought to be part of an older Romanequse church which was enlarged in the 14th century. The church was restored in 1866–1867 by W. Browning, who removed two Romanesque arches from the north arcade of the nave and dressed the exterior in flint rubble masonry and totternhoe Stone.

The church is noted for the Pendley Chapel, also known as the Verney Chapel, an ornate memorial chapel which is located at the east end of the nave. It was installed here in 1575 but its origins are much older; Edmund Verney had the tomb moved here from the dissolved monastery of Ashridge and enclosed it in an ornate stone parclose screen, also brought from Ashridge. The floor is covered in medieval encaustic tiles. The small chapel contains a carved stone recumbent tomb of Sir Robert Whittingham (d.1471), a nobleman who was slain at the battle of Tewkesbury (illustrated below). He is depicted in plate armour lying next to his wife. At his feet lies a wild man, a mythical creature covered in hair, and a hind lies at his wife&#x27;s feet. On the wall is a later monument to Sir Richard Anderson (1635–1699) of Pendley Manor and to his wife Elizabeth (1631–1698), sister of George, Viscount Hewwett. The Anderson are represented as a pair of busts surrounded by marble pilasters surmounted by a segmental pediment.

The church also contains memorials of the Hides and Harcourts, families who left charities to the poor of the parish.

===The Valiant Trooper===
The 17th-century cottages that form the &quot;Trooper&quot; have served as alehouses for several centuries. The first traceable evidence dates back to 1752 when the pub – then known as &quot;The Royal Oak&quot; – was left in the will of one John Barnes. Its next owner was Isaac Dell Master, whose initials &quot;ID&quot; and the date &quot;1769&quot; can be seen carved in the brickwork alongside the main front window. The name changed to &quot;The Trooper Alehouse&quot; in 1803 – rumoured to be because the &quot;Duke of Wellington&quot; met his troops here to discuss tactics. In the 1970s, &quot;Playboy&quot; executive Victor Lownes was a regular customer at the Valiant Trooper. In 2023, the pub reopened after restoration as the Trooper, with an adjoining café opening in 2024.

==Parish council==
Aldbury Parish Council is the local administrative body and covers Aldbury village itself and the hamlet at Tring Station – in Saxon times, Aldbury lay in Dacorum, one of the &quot;Hundreds&quot; of Hertfordshire and in 1973, the Dacorum Borough of Hertfordshire providing recycling, ultimate planning authority and certain business and leisure services was created with Aldbury in it.

==Transport==
Tring railway station lies west of the village, within the parish of Aldbury. West Midlands Trains run frequent passenger rail services southbound to and northbound to Milton Keynes Central. 

Aldbury is served by the 387 bus route to Tring via the railway station.

<doc id="489970" wikidata="Q299383" url="?curid=489970" title="Dmitri Sychev">
<text>Dmitri Yevgenyevich Sychev (; born 26 October 1983) is a Russian professional football official and a former player who played as a forward or as a midfielder. He is the president of Irtysh Omsk. He was hailed by the international press as &quot;The Russian Michael Owen&quot;, because of his pace, and was dubbed &quot;the most sensational young Russian forward since Vladimir Beschastnykh&quot;. He was well known for his blinding pace and agility.

==Early life==
Sychev was born in Omsk, a city in south-central Russia. He spent his formative years at St. Petersburg&#x27;s famous Smena football academy before joining FC Spartak Tambov, a second division club. At that time he played as a midfielder.

==Club career==

===Spartak Moscow and Marseille===
After having trials at clubs in FC Nantes and FC Metz, Sychev was picked up by Spartak Moscow in January 2002, where he scored eight goals in his first 12 matches, and it was during that time when he was transformed into a striker. With Spartak he reached the final of the 2002 Commonwealth of Independent States Cup. He scored 6 goals and finished second on the top scorer list, after coming in as a substitute in every match he played. He entered the symbolic top players list of the tournament.

In August 2002, Sychev announced he was quitting Spartak, by giving his employers three months&#x27; notice. Having already signed a five-year contract with the Russian club he was banned from football for four months by the Russian Professional Football League (RPFL).

After finishing this suspension, Sychev signed a five-year contract with Olympique de Marseille, rejecting an offer from Dynamo Kyiv. He was used as a midfielder, both left and right, but was usually a substitute during his time in France.

===Lokomotiv Moscow===

In late January 2004, Sychev returned to Russia to join Lokomotiv Moscow on a four-year contract. His transfer played a role in manager Yuri Syomin&#x27;s decision to change the starting formation from 5–3–2 to 4–2–3–1 or 4–4–1–1, which would help Sychev form a strong attacking partnership with team&#x27;s primary playmaker and captain Dmitri Loskov. He went on to claim the 2004 Russian Premier League title and the Russian Footballer of the Year award in his first season back in Russia, courtesy of his 15 goals and 4 assists in 27 league games. The following year, he continued his victorious streak with the club by winning the 2005 Russian Super Cup. However, in August 2005, he sustained an anterior cruciate ligament injury and was forced to miss the rest of the year, which saw Lokomotiv dropping points in the closing stages of the league and eventually losing the title to CSKA Moscow. In May 2007, Sychev also won the 2006–07 Russian Cup. Sychev played mostly as a striker, except the period when Lokomotiv was coached by Anatoliy Byshovets and Rashid Rakhimov respectively. During those times, he was mainly employed as a midfielder. Sychev started playing again in his natural position with the appointment of Yury Syomin. In 2009, he was voted by Lokomotiv fans as the player of the season. In the 2012–13 season, under manager Slaven Bilić, Sychev lost his place in the line-up (only four games in the first half of season, including the national cup).

====Loan spells====
In March 2013, Sychev moved to Dinamo Minsk on loan until July of the same year.

In July 2013, after returning from Dinamo Minsk, Sychev moved to fellow Russian Premier League side Volga Nizhny Novgorod on a year-long loan deal. Sychev featured in 16 league games for Volga, failing to score in any of them, and returned to Lokomotiv Moscow at the end of the season following Volga&#x27;s relegation to the Russian National Football League.

On 16 March 2015, Sychev moved to FC Okzhetpes on a season-long loan deal.

===Pyunik===
After over a year away from football, Sychev signed for FC Pyunik on 31 August 2019. On 6 December 2019, he left Pyunik by mutual consent having failed to make a first team appearance for the club. On 10 December 2019, he announced his retirement from playing.

==International career==

Sychev was selected to play for the Russian national team at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, where he became the youngest player to appear for the Soviet Union or Russia at 18 years and 222 days. In the event, he scored a goal and set up other three in an otherwise disappointing Russian campaign. This goal made him the fourth youngest goalscorer in the FIFA World Cup.

Sychev was called up to Russia&#x27;s squad for UEFA Euro 2008 in Austria and Switzerland. Despite playing as a striker at Lokomotiv Moscow, during Guus Hiddink&#x27;s stint with the Russian national team, he was used as a midfielder. He won his last cap in 2010.

==Post-playing career==
On 30 January 2024, Sychev was appointed president of his hometown club Irtysh Omsk in the third-tier Russian Second League.

==Television==
He appeared in the seventh season of ice show contest &quot;Ice Age&quot;.

==Personal life==
Besides football, Sychev is a fan of ice hockey and his hometown team Avangard Omsk. He also likes tennis and billiards. Outside of sports, he plays the guitar and was seen rapping at the MTV Russia Music Awards ceremony in Moscow with national teammate Diniyar Bilyaletdinov.

Aside from his native Russian, Sychev also speaks English, French, and plans to learn more.

In 2007, Sychev received a degree from the Russian State University of Physical Education, Sport, Youth and Tourism.

Sychev was in Danila Kozlovsky&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Coach&quot; which was released in 2018. Sychev portrayed Dodin, the player who scored the winning goal for his team.

<doc id="489971" wikidata="Q803917" url="?curid=489971" title="Bionicle">
<text>Bionicle (stylized all caps) was a line of Lego construction toys marketed primarily towards 8-to-16-year-olds. The line was launched in 2001, originally as a subsidiary of Lego&#x27;s Technic series. Over the following decade, it became one of the company&#x27;s biggest-selling properties, turning into a franchise and subsequently becoming one of the factors in saving Lego from its financial crisis of the late 1990s. Despite a planned twenty-year tenure, the theme was discontinued in 2010, citing low sales, but was rebooted in 2015 for a further two years.

Unlike previous Lego themes, Bionicle was accompanied by an original story that was told across a multimedia spectrum, including books, comics, games, and animated films. It primarily depicts the exploits of the Toa, heroic biomechanical beings with innate elemental abilities whose duty is to protect and maintain peace throughout their universe. Bionicle&#x27;s success prompted later Lego themes to use similar story-telling methods.

== History ==
=== Concept ===
After suffering a decade-long downturn in the 1990s, the Lego Group went forward with the idea that a theme with a storyline behind it would appeal to consumers. Their first attempt was the space opera franchise &quot;Star Wars&quot;, which became an instant success; however, the royalty payments to Lucasfilm marginalized Lego&#x27;s profits, prompting them to conceive their own story-driven themes.

The concept for Bionicle originated from an idea by co-creator Christian Faber named &quot;Cybots&quot;, a line of humanoid action figures with attachable limbs and ball-and-socket joints. Faber recalled: &quot;I was sitting with Lego Technic and thought I would love to build a character instead of a car. I thought of this biological thing: The human body is built from small parts into a functional body just like a model. What if you got a box full of spare parts and built a living thing?&quot;. He pitched the idea to Lego, but was initially implemented as the themes Slizer/Throwbots in 1999 and RoboRiders in 2000.

A new project called &quot;BoneHeads of Voodoo Island&quot; was later conceived by Faber and Lego employees Bob Thompson and Martin Riber Andersen from a brief by Erik Kramer that was sent to outside writers, one of whom was Alastair Swinnerton, who rewrote the concept and was later invited to pitch it to the Lego Group at their headquarters in Billund, Denmark. The revised concept was well received and Swinnerton was commissioned to expand his initial pitch into a full &#x27;bible&#x27;. On his second visit to Billund, the project was given approval and entitled &quot;Bionicle&quot; at an internal Lego meeting (a portmanteau constructed from the words &quot;biological chronicle&quot;, with reference to the word &quot;bionics&quot;). The names &quot;BioKnights&quot; and &quot;Afterman&quot; were also considered prior to the finalization of the brand.

To accompany theme, Lego worked with Swinnerton and the creative agency Advance to create an elaborate story with extensive lore centering on half-organic, half-robotic characters and telling it across a vast multimedia spectrum including comic books, novels, games, films and online content. Māori culture became a key inspiration behind the story and the theme at large. The use of tropical environments and characters based on classical elements were also carried over from Slizer/Throwbots and RoboRiders. The toys themselves would be an expansion of the Lego Technic sub-series, featuring the same building system that was already featured in the aforementioned themes. One particular element – the then-innovative ball-and-socket system which created free joint movement – would feature heavily in Bionicle&#x27;s run and later across other Lego themes.

=== Launch and success ===
The first wave of Bionicle sets were initially launched in December 2000 in Europe and Australasia as a &quot;test market&quot; to predict how well the series would sell in North America. The official website, explaining the premise of Bionicle, also debuted around the same time. After a positive reception, Bionicle premiered in North America in mid-2001, where it generated massive success and garnered the Lego Group £100 million in its first year. New sets were released every six months, ranging from buildable action figures to play sets and vehicles, and would gradually increase in size and flexibility with every new wave. Collectibles such as weapon ammo and the &quot;Kanohi&quot; masks that certain characters wore were also sold; some became rare and valuable and withheld secret codes that when entered onto the official Bionicle website, provided the user with &quot;Kanoka Points&quot; that enabled them to access exclusive membership material.

As Bionicle&#x27;s popularity rose, it became one of Lego&#x27;s most successful properties, accounting for nearly all of their financial turnover from the previous decade. It was named as the #1 Lego theme in 2003 and 2006 in terms of sales and popularity, with other Lego themes at the time failing to match the profits generated by Bionicle. Its popularity led to high web traffic on its official website, averaging more than one million page views per month, and further kinds of merchandise such as clothes, toiletries and fast-food restaurant toy collectibles.

=== Discontinuation ===
In November 2009, Lego made the decision to cease production on new Bionicle sets after a final wave was released in 2010. The decision was made due to recent low sales and a lack of new consumer interest in the brand, thought to be brought on by its decade-long backstory and extensive lore.

At his request, long-term Bionicle comic book writer and story contributor Greg Farshtey was given permission to continue the Bionicle storyline, with chapters for new serials arranged to be posted regularly on the website BionicleStory.com. However, Farshtey stopped posting new content in 2011 due to his other commitments and the website was shut down in 2013, leaving a number of serials incomplete. Farshtey regularly contributed new story details and &quot;canonization&quot; of fan made models via online forums and message boards until his departure from Lego in 2022. Nevertheless, he continues to play an active role in the Bionicle fan community.

=== Reboot ===
Work on a reboot of Bionicle began in 2012. Matt Betteker, a junior designer who had previously worked on Hero Factory, a successor theme to the original Bionicle line, was promoted to senior designer for the project. The theme&#x27;s comeback was announced in September 2014, with the first wave of sets and story details revealed at New York Comic Con on October 9. Dubbed colloquially as &quot;Generation 2&quot; by fans and later Lego themselves, the new storyline was based on the premise of the original, albeit with simplified lore and a smaller trans-media platform.

The reboot launched in January 2015 to a mixed reception from toy critics and fans of the original Bionicle franchise, with the playability of the new sets and the inspiration taken from the theme&#x27;s first wave being praised, but the simplified story and undeveloped characters receiving less positive feedback.

Lego discontinued the reboot in late 2016, citing low sales, despite plans to release new sets through to at least 2017. It is widely believed by fans that a lack of marketing and reliance on fans to promote the theme, coupled with the new simplified story, were factors in Generation 2&#x27;s decreased interest.

=== Legacy ===
During and after its run, Bionicle became the inspiration for several other Lego themes including Knights Kingdom, Exo-Force, Ninjago, Legends of Chima, and Nexo Knights. They all followed a similar story narrative about a group of heroes, each with varying abilities, battling the henchmen of an ally-turned-foe in a fantasy world. Bionicle writer Greg Farshtey would also go on to write material for the some of these themes, most notably Ninjago.

A direct successor theme to Bionicle, Hero Factory, was launched in 2010. It continued to use the building system introduced in Bionicle before evolving into the Character and Creature Building System (CCBS) that would later be carried over into other Lego sets and eventually Bionicle&#x27;s 2015 reintroduction. Hero Factory itself ceased after 2014.

Despite its ending as a toyline, Bionicle&#x27;s popularity has persisted and was acknowledged by Lego in its 90th anniversary poll, winning the first round. A promotional Lego System set celebrating Bionicle was released in 2023, featuring brick-built versions of the characters of Tahu and Takua, to which the community responded well. Additionally, fans have engaged in several community-based projects, including creating a &quot;Bionicle Day&quot; for August 10 (stylized as &quot;810NICLE Day&quot;), story and media archives, and several fan games.

== Story ==
=== Generation 1 (2001–2010) ===

Set in a science fantasy universe featuring a diversity of biomechanical beings, the main story depicts the exploits of the Toa, heroes with elemental powers whose duty is to protect the Matoran, the prime populace of their world, and reawaken their god-like guardian, the Great Spirit Mata Nui, who was forced into a coma by the actions of his antagonist &quot;brother&quot;, the Makuta.

The first story arc (2001–2003) takes place on the tropical island of Mata Nui, named after the Great Spirit, and deals with the arrival of the six Toa Mata and their adventures in protecting the Matoran villagers from Makuta&#x27;s minions. They are later transformed into the more-powerful Toa Nuva. A heavy emphasis is placed on the Kanohi masks worn by the Toa, which supplement their elemental powers with abilities such as super-strength, super-speed, levitation and water-breathing. The second arc (2004–2005) acts as a prequel to the first; set on an island city called Metru Nui, it follows another group of Toa who would go on to become Turaga, the Matoran&#x27;s elders, and explains how they all came to settle on the island of Mata Nui. The culminating third arc (2006–2008) sees a new team of Toa (transformed from Matoran) set out on a quest to find the Mask of Life, an artifact that can save the now-dying Mata Nui. A fourth arc (2009), originally envisioned as a soft reboot of the franchise, introduces the desert world of Bara Magna, its inhabitants, and Mata Nui&#x27;s origins. However, all planned storylines were scrapped after Lego announced that Bionicle would be discontinued and was replaced with a new one that concluded the main narrative in 2010.

Characters such as the Toa and Matoran are typically divided into tribes based on six &quot;primary&quot; elements: fire, water, air, earth, ice, and stone. Less common &quot;secondary&quot; elements, such as light, gravity and lightning, began being introduced in 2003. The 2009 storyline, which features a different society, uses a similar grouping method for its Glatorian and Agori characters.

The entire saga was developed by a team of Lego employees led by Bob Thompson for a multimedia platform spanning animations, comic books, novels, console and online games, short stories, and a series of direct-to-video films. The majority of comics and novels were written by Greg Farshtey, who also published a number of in-character blogs, serials, and podcasts that expanded the franchise lore. After the toyline was discontinued, publication of these serials continued through to 2011 before halting abruptly due to Farshtey&#x27;s other commitments.

=== Generation 2 (2015–2016) ===
A reboot of the original story, the revival chronicles the adventures of six elemental Toa heroes who protect the bio-mechanical inhabitants of the mystical island of Okoto from Makuta and his minions. Characters are again divided into six elemental tribes: fire, water, jungle (changed from air for creative reasons), earth, ice, and stone. The reboot&#x27;s multimedia spectrum was scaled back in comparison to the first generation&#x27;s – online animations, a series of books and graphics novels authored by Ryder Windham, and the animated Netflix series &quot;Lego Bionicle: The Journey to One&quot; (2016) detail the narrative. Christian Faber and Greg Farshtey served as creative consultants.

== Reception ==
Initially, the idea of Bionicle faced resistance from company traditionalists as the Lego Group had no experience of marketing a story-based brand of their own. The &quot;war-like&quot; appearance of the characters also went against the company&#x27;s values of creating sets without themes of modern warfare or violence. Lego reconciled on this statement by claiming that the theme was about &quot;Good versus evil; &quot;good hero warriors&quot; designed to combat &quot;evil enemy fighters&quot; in a mythical universe, so children are not encouraged to fight each other&quot;.

The Bionicle franchise was well received over its venture and became one of the Lego Group&#x27;s biggest-selling properties. At the time of its launch, one reviewer described the sets as &quot;A good combination of assembly and action figure&quot;. and first-year sales of £100 million. Bionicle later received a Toy of the Year Award for Most Innovative Toy in 2001 from the Toy Industry Association.

Bionicle&#x27;s rapid success had a major impact on the Lego Company. Stephanie Lawrence, the global director of licensing for Lego, stated: &quot;We&#x27;ve created an evergreen franchise to complement the many event-based properties on the children&#x27;s market. An increasing number of category manufacturers want to tap into the power of the Bionicle universe, and the key for us now is to manage the excitement to stay true to the brand and the lifestyle of our core consumer&quot;.

Since its launch, toy critics have said that Bionicle has changed the way children think and play with Lego products by combining &quot;The best of Lego building with the story telling and adventure of an action figure&quot;. Toy statistics have revealed that as of 2009, 85% of American boys aged 6–12 had heard of Bionicle while 45% owned the sets.

=== Māori language controversy ===
In 2002, several Māori iwi (tribes) from New Zealand were angered by Lego&#x27;s lack of respect for some of their words which were used to name certain characters, locations and objects in the Bionicle storyline. A letter of complaint was written, and the company agreed to change the names of certain story elements (e.g., the villagers originally known as &quot;Tohunga&quot; was changed to &quot;Matoran&quot;) and met with an agreement with the Māori people to still use a small minority of their words.

In the story, the reason for certain name changes was dubbed as a Naming Ceremony for certain Matoran after doing heroic deeds (though the pronunciations remain the same), an example being the name change of &#x27;Huki&#x27; to &#x27;Hewkii&#x27;. Other names such as &quot;Toa&quot; meaning &quot;Warrior&quot;, &quot;Kanohi&quot; meaning &quot;Face&quot; and &quot;Kōpaka&quot; meaning &quot;Ice&quot; were not changed.

<doc id="489978" wikidata="Q5011878" url="?curid=489978" title="CISS-FM">
<text>CISS-FM (105.3 MHz) is a commercial radio station in Ottawa, Ontario. The station is owned by Rogers Radio, a division of Rogers Sports &amp; Media, and broadcasts a hot adult contemporary format branded on-air as &quot;KiSS 105.3&quot;. The radio studios and offices are co-located with its sister stations at Thurston Drive and Conroy Road.

CISS-FM has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 84,000 watts. The transmitter is located in Camp Fortune, Quebec, within Gatineau Park.

==History==
The station signed on the air in 1972 with the call sign CKBY, playing a country format.

On January 9, 2004, the station shifted to a hot adult contemporary format and adopted the &quot;105.3 KISS-FM&quot; moniker. The station launched with Pink&#x27;s &quot;Get the Party Started&quot;. A month after the format change, the station adopted its current call letters. The CISS call sign was previously associated with a Toronto radio station, also owned by Rogers, which now uses the call letters CKIS-FM. The CKBY calls were subsequently transferred to a third Rogers station in Smiths Falls. In the station&#x27;s early years, the station&#x27;s playlist resembled that of CHUM-FM in Toronto, but with a less rhythmic lean. Later that year, it shifted from Hot AC to adult top 40.

The introduction of CISS came at the expense of &quot;101.1 XFM&quot; (CIOX-FM), an alternative rock station that was shut down to make way for KISS and the relocation of country radio 105.3 FM as &quot;Y105&quot;, to 101.1 FM as &quot;Y101&quot;, which later rebranded as &quot;Country 101.1&quot;. The two morning show hosts of XFM, Mauler and Rush, were temporarily left unemployed. They have since moved to The Morning Hot Tub on CIHT-FM, which is also simulcast on other Stingray Group stations across Canada.

With the transition of the former CISS in Toronto from &quot;Jack FM&quot; to top 40 as &quot;KiSS 92.5&quot; on June 5, 2009, the CISS calls remained unchanged on this station. Instead, Rogers swapped the CJAQ-FM calls in Toronto with the former CKIS-FM (a &quot;Jack&quot; station) in Calgary.

As of the fall of 2009, CISS has begun leaning towards a more rhythmic sound again, dropping most modern adult contemporary artists.

As of 2011, the station eliminated the majority of its pre-1999 playlist, shifting towards a more 2000s-now direction. 

A new logo and tagline were introduced. The tagline was &quot;The New&quot; in its &quot;KISS-FM&quot; branding. The station leans on rhythmic material during nights and weekends. As of March 31, 2014, CISS faced additional competition from CKQB, which transitioned from active rock to a Top 40/CHR format. CKQB&#x27;s presentation heavily favours current rhythmic and dance products aimed at young adult and teen listeners. CISS is on the Canadian Hot AC panels of Mediabase and Nielsen BDS.

By early 2016, CISS re-branded slightly to &quot;KiSS 105.3&quot;.

In September 2016, CISS re-added 1990s music to their playlist and changed the slogan to &quot;The Most Variety from the 90s to Now.&quot;

In August 2021, CISS re-branded as &quot;The Capital&#x27;s KiSS 105.3&quot;, and changed their slogan to &quot;90&#x27;s, 2000&#x27;s, Now!&quot;

<text>The Battle of Perryville, also known as the Battle of Chaplin Hills, was fought on October 8, 1862, in the Chaplin Hills west of Perryville, Kentucky, as the culmination of the Confederate Heartland Offensive (Kentucky Campaign) during the American Civil War. Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg&#x27;s Army of Mississippi initially won a tactical victory against primarily a single corps of Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell&#x27;s Union Army of the Ohio. The battle is considered a strategic Union victory, sometimes called the Battle for Kentucky, since Bragg withdrew to Tennessee soon thereafter. The Union retained control of the critical border state of Kentucky for the remainder of the war.

On October 7, Buell&#x27;s army, in pursuit of Bragg, converged on the small crossroads town of Perryville in three columns. Union forces first skirmished with Confederate cavalry on the Springfield Pike before the fighting became more general, on Peters Hill, when the Confederate infantry arrived. Both sides were desperate to get access to fresh water. The next day, at dawn, fighting began again around Peters Hill as a Union division advanced up the pike, halting just before the Confederate line. After noon, a Confederate division struck the Union left flank—the I Corps of Maj. Gen. Alexander M. McCook—and forced it to fall back. When more Confederate divisions joined the fray, the Union line made a stubborn stand, counterattacked, but finally fell back with some units routed.

Buell, several miles behind the action, was unaware that a major battle was taking place and did not send any reserves to the front until late in the afternoon. The Union troops on the left flank, reinforced by two brigades, stabilized their line, and the Confederate attack sputtered to a halt. Later, three Confederate regiments assaulted the Union division on the Springfield Pike but were repulsed and fell back into Perryville. Union troops pursued, and skirmishing occurred in the streets until dark. By that time, Union reinforcements were threatening the Confederate left flank. Bragg, short of men and supplies, withdrew during the night, and continued the Confederate retreat by way of Cumberland Gap into East Tennessee.

Considering the casualties relative to the engaged strengths of the armies, the Battle of Perryville was one of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War. It was the largest battle fought in the state of Kentucky.

== Background ==
=== Military situation ===

=== Kentucky campaign of 1862 ===

Situated between the Southern states of Tennessee and Virginia and the Northern states of Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, the border state of Kentucky was coveted by both sides of the conflict because of its central location and its control of key rivers, particularly the Ohio. In September 1861, Kentucky-born President Abraham Lincoln wrote in a private letter, &quot;I think to lose Kentucky is nearly to lose the whole game.&quot;

Opposing political elements within the state vied for control during the early part of the war, and the state legislature declared official neutrality to keep out both the Union and the Confederate armies. This neutrality was first violated on September 3, 1861, when Confederate Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk occupied Columbus, considered key to controlling the Lower Mississippi. Two days later Union Brig. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant seized Paducah. Henceforth, the proclaimed neutrality was a dead letter. While the state never seceded from the Union, Confederate sympathizers who were members of the legislature set up a temporary Confederate capital in Bowling Green in November 1861. It never wielded significant power inside the state. The Confederate States recognized Kentucky and added a star representing the state to the Confederate flag.

After the Battle of Shiloh on April 6–7, the beaten Confederate army under Maj. Gen Pierre G.T. Beauregard retreated down into Corinth, very slowly pursued by the combined Union forces under Maj. Gen Henry Halleck – the armies of Grant, Buell, and John Pope. Although Halleck had 100,000 men under his command and Beauregard half or less of that number, it took him 51 days to march the 20 miles from Pittsburg Landing to Corinth, which was abandoned by the Confederates on May 29. Confederate president Jefferson Davis, unhappy with Beauregard&#x27;s retreat, removed him from command and gave Braxton Bragg the army, which he renamed the Army of Tennessee. Bragg spent most of June drilling and reorganizing the army in camp at Tupelo, Mississippi. The Union armies ignored him and the war in Tennessee virtually ground to a halt during the summer months. Grant&#x27;s Army of the Tennessee was scattered about western Tennessee and northern Mississippi, while Buell&#x27;s Army of Ohio was moving towards Chattanooga at an incredibly slow pace, spending much of that time rebuilding railroad lines. While Halleck had had overall command of the Union war effort in the West since spring, he was summoned to Washington DC in July to become general-in-chief of the armies, leaving Grant and Buell to their separate independent commands – Pope was also called east to take command of the Union war effort in Virginia and his former army added to Grant&#x27;s and put under the command of William Rosecrans.

The initiative to invade Kentucky came primarily from Confederate Maj. Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith, commander of the Department of East Tennessee. He believed the campaign would allow them to obtain supplies, enlist recruits, divert Union troops from Tennessee, and claim Kentucky for the Confederacy. In July 1862 Col. John Hunt Morgan carried out a successful cavalry raid in the state, venturing deeply into the rear areas of Buell&#x27;s department. The raid caused considerable consternation in Buell&#x27;s command and in Washington, D.C. During the raid, Morgan and his forces were cheered and supported by many residents. He added 300 Kentucky volunteers to his 900-man force during the raid. He confidently promised Kirby Smith, &quot;The whole country can be secured, and 25,000 or 30,000 men will join you at once.&quot;

Bragg considered various options, including an attempt to retake Corinth, Mississippi, or to advance against Buell&#x27;s army through Middle Tennessee. He eventually heeded Kirby Smith&#x27;s calls for reinforcement and decided to relocate his Army of Mississippi to join with him. He moved 30,000 infantrymen in a tortuous railroad journey from Tupelo, Mississippi, through Mobile and Montgomery to Chattanooga. Supply wagons, cavalry, and artillery moved overland under their own power through Rome, Georgia. Although Bragg was the senior general in the theater, Confederate President Jefferson Davis had established Kirby Smith&#x27;s Department of East Tennessee as an independent command, reporting directly to Richmond. This decision caused Bragg difficulty during the campaign.

Smith and Bragg met in Chattanooga on July 31, and devised a plan for the campaign: The newly created Army of Kentucky, including two of Bragg&#x27;s brigades and approximately 21,000 men, would march north under Kirby Smith&#x27;s command into Kentucky to dispose of the Union defenders of Cumberland Gap. (Bragg&#x27;s army was too exhausted from its long journey to begin immediate offensive operations.) Smith would return to join Bragg, and their combined forces would attempt to maneuver into Buell&#x27;s rear and force a battle to protect his supply lines. Any attempt by Ulysses S. Grant to reinforce Buell from northern Mississippi would be handled by the two small armies of Maj. Gens. Sterling Price and Earl Van Dorn.

The first indication that something was happening came in late June when Col. Phil Sheridan, commanding a cavalry demi-brigade (two regiments) in the Army of the Tennessee, went on a reconnaissance mission to discover that the Confederates had abandoned their camp at Tupelo and began moving towards Chattanooga, while another Confederate army under Sterling Price was gathering in Mississippi. Several captured letters from Confederate soldiers boasted that the Yankees would be given the slip (Maj. Gen William Rosecrans was impressed with Sheridan&#x27;s foray and recommended him for promotion to brigadier general).

Once the armies were combined, Bragg&#x27;s seniority would apply and Smith would be under his direct command. Assuming that Buell&#x27;s army could be destroyed, Bragg and Smith would march north into Kentucky, a movement they assumed would be welcomed by the local populace. Any remaining Federal force would be defeated in a grand battle in Kentucky, establishing the Confederate frontier at the Ohio River.

The campaign plan was bold but risky, requiring perfect coordination between multiple armies that would initially have no unity of command. Bragg almost immediately began to have second thoughts, despite pressure from President Davis to take Kentucky. Smith quickly abandoned the agreement, foreseeing that a solo adventure in Kentucky would bring him personal glory. He deceived Bragg as to his intentions and requested two additional brigades, ostensibly for his expedition to Cumberland Gap. On August 9, Smith informed Bragg that he was breaking the agreement and intended to bypass Cumberland Gap, leaving a small holding force to neutralize the Union garrison, and to move north. Unable to command Smith to honor their plan, Bragg focused on a movement to Lexington instead of Nashville. He cautioned Smith that Buell could pursue and defeat his smaller army before Bragg&#x27;s army could join up with them.

Smith marched north with 21,000 men from Knoxville on August 13; Bragg departed from Chattanooga on August 27, just before Smith reached Lexington. The beginning of the campaign coincided with Gen. Robert E. Lee&#x27;s offensive in the northern Virginia campaign (second Manassas campaign) and with Price&#x27;s and Van Dorn&#x27;s operations against Grant. Although not centrally directed, it was the largest simultaneous Confederate offensive of the war.

Meanwhile, Buell was forced to abandon his slow advance toward Chattanooga. Receiving word of the Confederate movements, he decided to concentrate his army around Nashville. The news that Smith and Bragg were both in Kentucky convinced him of the need to place his army between the Confederates and the Union cities of Louisville and Cincinnati. On September 7, Buell&#x27;s Army of the Ohio left Nashville and began racing Bragg to Louisville.

On the way, Bragg was distracted by the capture of a Union fort at Munfordville. He had to decide whether to continue toward a fight with Buell (over Louisville) or rejoin Smith, who had gained control of the center of the state by capturing Richmond and Lexington, and threatened to move on Cincinnati. Bragg chose to rejoin Smith.

Buell reached Louisville, where he gathered, reorganized, and reinforced his army with thousands of new recruits. He dispatched 20,000 men under Brig. Gen. Joshua W. Sill toward Frankfort, hoping to distract Smith and prevent the two Confederate armies from joining against him. Meanwhile, Bragg left his army and met Smith in Frankfort, where they attended the inauguration of Confederate Governor Richard Hawes on October 4. The inauguration ceremony was disrupted by the sound of cannon fire from Sill&#x27;s approaching division, and organizers canceled the inaugural ball scheduled for that evening.


=== Prelude to battle ===
When he departed for Frankfort on September 28, Bragg left his army under Polk&#x27;s command. On October 3, the approach of the large Union force caused the Confederates to withdraw eastward and Bardstown was occupied on October 4. Hardee&#x27;s wing stopped at Perryville and requested reinforcements from Bragg. Although Bragg wished to concentrate his army at Versailles, the quickly approaching Federal III Corps forced the concentration at Perryville and Harrodsburg.

==== Geography and location ====
Hardee had selected Perryville for a few reasons. The village of approximately 300 residents had an excellent road network with connections to nearby towns in six directions, allowing for strategic flexibility. It was located to prevent the Federals from reaching the Confederate supply depot in Bryantsville. Finally, it was a potential source of water. An extremely wet winter and spring of 1862, believed caused by the eruption of Mt. Dubbi in East Africa in May 1861, gave way to dry conditions during June which stayed that way throughout the summer and into early fall. The Southern states remained locked under a stagnant high pressure ridge that sent daytime temperatures soaring with little rain to cool things down. The heat was oppressive for both men and horses, and the few sources of drinking water provided by the rivers and creeks west of town—most reduced to isolated stagnant puddles—were desperately sought after.

==== Disposition of armies ====
On October 7, Buell reached the Perryville area as Union cavalry clashed with Wheeler&#x27;s rearguard throughout the day. Accompanying III Corps, Buell learned that the Confederates had halted at Perryville and were deploying their infantry. He therefore planned an attack. The enemy force was his principal objective, but the availability of water also made control of the town and surrounding area desirable. Buell issued orders for all corps to move at 3 a.m. the next day and attack at 10 a.m. However, movements of the I and II Corps were delayed, having deviated several miles from their line of march in search of water. Buell decided to delay his attack until October 9 to complete his army&#x27;s deployment and ordered each corps commander to avoid a general engagement on October 8. Buell was unable to oversee the deployment of his arriving corps. Thrown from his horse, he suffered injuries that prevented him from riding. He established his headquarters at the Dorsey house, about due west of town.

Hardee established a line of defense across the three roads leading into Perryville from the north and west. Until reinforcements could arrive, he was limited to three of the four brigades of Buckner&#x27;s division. Brig. Gen. Sterling A. M. Wood was placed at the north of town. Brig. Gen. Bushrod Johnson was to Wood&#x27;s right, east of the Chaplin River near the Harrodsburg Pike. Brig. Gen. St. John R. Liddell&#x27;s Arkansas Brigade formed on the crest of Bottom Hill, just east of Bull Run Creek, a tributary of Doctor&#x27;s Creek, with one regiment, the 7th Arkansas, sent forward to Peters Hill on the other side of the creek. On the evening of October 7 the final Confederate forces began to arrive. The first of Patton Anderson&#x27;s four brigades reached the area around 3 p.m. Brig. Gen. Patrick Cleburne&#x27;s brigade, the remainder of Buckner&#x27;s division, followed. Around midnight, three brigades of Frank Cheatham&#x27;s division arrived, moving quickly and enthusiastically, having left their baggage train behind; his fourth brigade, under Brig. Gen. Preston Smith, received orders to return to Harrodsburg.

== Opposing forces ==
=== Union ===


On October 1, Buell&#x27;s Army of the Ohio left Louisville with Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas as his second in command. (Two days earlier, Buell had received orders from Washington relieving him of command, to be replaced by Thomas. Thomas demurred, refusing to accept command while the campaign was underway, leaving Buell in place.) The 55,000 troops—many of whom Thomas described as &quot;yet undisciplined, unprovided with suitable artillery, and in every way unfit for active operations against a disciplined foe&quot;—advanced toward Bragg&#x27;s veteran army in Bardstown on three separate roads.

* The I Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen. Alexander M. McCook, marched on the left, along the Mackville Road. His 13,000 men consisted of the 3rd Division, under Brig. Gen. Lovell H. Rousseau, and the 10th Division, under Brig. Gen. James S. Jackson.
* The II Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen. Thomas L. Crittenden, marched on the right, along the Lebanon Road. His 20,000 men were in three divisions: the 4th, commanded by Brig. Gen. William Sooy Smith; the 5th, Brig. Gen. Horatio P. Van Cleve; and the 6th, Brig. Gen. Thomas J. Wood.
* The III Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen. Charles Champion Gilbert, took the center, along the Springfield Pike. Just a few weeks earlier, Gilbert had been a captain, but was elevated to acting major general and corps command following the death by murder of the previous commander, Maj. Gen. William &quot;Bull&quot; Nelson. Gilbert&#x27;s 22,000 men were also in three divisions: the 1st, under Brig. Gen. Albin F. Schoepf; 9th, Brig. Gen. Robert B. Mitchell; and the 11th, Brig. Gen. Philip H. Sheridan.
=== Confederate ===


Bragg&#x27;s Army of Mississippi consisted of about 16,800 men in two wings:
* Right Wing, commanded by Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk, consisted of a single division under Maj. Gen. Benjamin F. Cheatham;
* Left Wing, commanded by Maj. Gen. William J. Hardee, consisted of the divisions of Brig. Gen. J. Patton Anderson and Maj. Gen. Simon B. Buckner.

==Battle==
=== Morning actions ===
The first shots of the battle were fired early on the morning of October 8. Finding that there were algae-covered pools of water in the otherwise dry bed of Doctor&#x27;s Creek, troops from the 10th Indiana advanced to take advantage of them. They encountered the forward men of the 7th Arkansas and some shots were exchanged. At 2 a.m., Buell and Gilbert, the III Corps commander, ordered newly promoted Brig. Gen. Phil Sheridan to seize Peters Hill; Sheridan started off with the brigade of Col. Daniel McCook (the younger brother of the I Corps commander). Sheridan seized the hill, driving the Arkansans back to the main line of their brigade, but continued to push across the creek. Liddell&#x27;s brigade could not check the momentum of Sheridan&#x27;s thirsty soldiers and Buckner, Liddell&#x27;s division commander, was ordered by Polk not to reinforce him, but to pull his brigade back. Polk was concerned about starting a general engagement to the west of the Chaplin River, fearing he was outnumbered. Meanwhile, on the Union side, a nervous Gilbert ordered Sheridan to return to Peters Hill.

For the preceding few days, Braxton Bragg had been deceived by the diversion launched by Sills against Frankfort, assuming that it was the major thrust of Buell&#x27;s army. He wanted Polk to attack and defeat what he considered to be a minor force at Perryville and then immediately return so that the entire army could be joined with Kirby Smith&#x27;s. Polk sent a dispatch to Bragg early that morning that he intended to attack vigorously, but he quickly changed his mind and settled on a defensive posture. Bragg, angered that he was not hearing the sounds of battle, rode from Harrodsburg to Perryville to take charge, arriving about 10 a.m. and establishing his headquarters at the Crawford house on the Harrodsburg Pike.

Bragg was appalled at the condition of Polk&#x27;s battle line, which contained gaps and was not properly anchored on the flanks. As he rode in, he observed some of McCook&#x27;s I Corps troops north of town, but he assumed that the primary threat continued to be on the Springfield Pike, where the action against the III Corps had taken place early that morning. (He had no knowledge of Crittenden&#x27;s II Corps approaching on the Lebanon Pike.) He gave orders to realign his army into a north–south line and prepare to attack &quot;en echelon&quot;. Cheatham&#x27;s division marched north from town and prepared to open the attack on the Union left—which Bragg assumed to be on the Mackville Road—beginning a large &quot;left wheel&quot; movement. Two brigades from Patton Anderson&#x27;s division would then strike the Union center and Buckner&#x27;s division would follow up on the left. Another of Anderson&#x27;s brigades, commanded by Col. Samuel Powel, would attack farther to the south along the Springfield Pike. The large clouds of dust raised by Cheatham&#x27;s division marching north at the double-quick prompted some of McCook&#x27;s men to believe the Confederates were starting to retreat, which increased the surprise of the Rebel attack later in the day.

By the afternoon of October 8, most of Buell&#x27;s army had arrived. They were positioned with McCook&#x27;s I Corps on the left from the Benton Road to the Mackville Road; Gilbert&#x27;s III Corps in the center, on the Springfield Pike; Crittenden&#x27;s II Corps on the right, along the Lebanon Pike. The vast majority of action during the battle would be against McCook&#x27;s corps. Because of an unusual acoustic shadow, few sounds from the battle reached Buell&#x27;s headquarters only away; he did not exert effective control over the battle and committed no reserves until late in the day.

=== Attack from the Confederate right ===
Cheatham&#x27;s artillery bombardment began at 12:30 p.m., but he did not immediately order his infantry forward. Union troops continued to file into line, extending their flank to the north, beyond the intended avenue of attack. Bragg moved Cheatham&#x27;s division into Walker&#x27;s Bend, assuming the redirected attack would now strike the Union&#x27;s open flank. Unfortunately for the Confederates, their cavalry reconnaissance withdrew before McCook placed an artillery battery under Lt. Charles Parsons and the brigade of Brig. Gen. William R. Terrill onto the Open Knob, a prominent hill on the northern end of the battlefield.

The brigade of Brig. Gen. Daniel S. Donelson was the first to cross the Chaplin River, climb the bluffs on the west bank, and began its attack around 2 p.m. Two of the brigade&#x27;s regiments had been detached, leaving only three for the attack. Cheatham shouted, &quot;Give &#x27;em hell, boys!&quot; One of the enduring legends of the Civil War is that Gen. Polk, who was also an Episcopal bishop, was nearby and seconded the cheer: &quot;Give it to &#x27;em boys; give &#x27;em what General Cheatham says!&quot; The brigade found that instead of striking the open flank it had expected, it was performing a frontal assault on the center of the Union position. The 16th Tennessee Infantry, under Col. John H. Savage, raced ahead of the other two regiments, attempting to reach the artillery battery of Capt. Samuel J. Harris. (Savage held Donelson in disdain, considering him a drunkard with limited military ability, and often paid little attention to orders from his commander. He considered Donelson&#x27;s order to attack Harris&#x27;s battery to be a death sentence against him.) As it moved west into a depression, it came under crossfire from the 33rd Ohio Infantry and the eight guns of Parsons&#x27; artillery on Open Knob, to the north. Cheatham ordered the brigade of Brig. Gen. George E. Maney forward to deal with Parsons on the Open Knob, but Donelson&#x27;s brigade could not withstand the fire and withdrew to its starting point at 2:30 p.m. with about 20% casualties; Savage&#x27;s regiment lost 219 of its 370 men.
Parsons&#x27; eight guns on the Open Knob were manned by inexperienced soldiers, some of whom were infantry recruits from the 105th Ohio Infantry. Terrill&#x27;s 33rd Brigade was posted to defend the guns. Meanwhile, Confederate Brigadier General George Maney&#x27;s brigade was able to approach the Knob undetected through the woods, as the Union troops&#x27; attention was focused on Donelson&#x27;s attack. Eventually, the Union artillery redirected their guns and a fierce firefight ensued. Brig. Gen. Jackson, the 10th Division commander, was killed in the action, and command fell to Terrill, who immediately made a poor command decision. Obsessed with the safety of his artillery, he ordered the 123rd Illinois to mount a bayonet charge down the hill. The 770 raw Union troops suffered heavy casualties at the hands of the 1,800 veteran Confederates. As reinforcements arrived from the 80th Illinois and a detachment of infantry commanded by Col. Theophilus T. Garrard, the two sides were briefly stalemated. Maney&#x27;s artillery, commanded by Lt. William Turner, pounded the inexperienced defenders, and Maney ordered a charge up the steep slope, which swept the Union men from the hill and captured most of Parsons&#x27; guns; the tenacious Parsons had to be dragged away from the scene by his retreating soldiers.
Maney&#x27;s attack continued to the west, down the reverse slope of the Open Knob, through a cornfield, and across the Benton Road, after which was another steep ridge, occupied by the 2,200 men in the Union 28th Brigade of Col. John C. Starkweather (Rousseau&#x27;s division), and twelve guns. Those guns made the Open Knob an untenable position. Starkweather had placed his 21st Wisconsin in the cornfield about the time that Maney was attacking Parsons&#x27; position. The inexperienced men of the 21st—some of whom had never fired their weapons before, the regiment having been formed less than a month earlier—could see little through the 10- to high cornstalks of the cornfield. They were surprised as the remnants of Terrill&#x27;s brigade retreated through their position. As Terrill himself retreated, he shouted, &quot;The Rebels are advancing in terrible force!&quot; Terrill convinced the regimental adjutant to order yet another bayonet charge; 200 men advanced and were quickly smashed by the oncoming Confederates. While the Union men had to hold their fire to keep from shooting their retreating comrades, artillery fire from Starkweather&#x27;s batteries caused numerous friendly fire casualties. The 21st managed to fire a volley into the Confederate ranks, but it was answered by a 1,400-musket volley that decimated the Union regiment, and the survivors fled toward the Benton Road.

To fill a gap in the Confederate line where Donelson&#x27;s brigade had fought, Cheatham deployed the Tennessee brigade of Brig. Gen. Alexander P. Stewart and they joined Maney&#x27;s brigade in the advance against Starkweather. The 1st Tennessee attacked the northern end of the hill while the remainder of Maney&#x27;s brigade assaulted directly up the slope. Starkweather&#x27;s position was a strong one, however, and the Confederates were initially repulsed by strong infantry and artillery fire. A second charge and vicious hand-to-hand fighting brought the Confederates to the crest, among the batteries.

At that time Brig. Gen. Terrill returned to the fight, leading his troops up the reverse slope of the hill. He was mortally wounded by an artillery shell exploding overhead and died at 2 a.m. the following day. Starkweather, meanwhile, was able to salvage six of his twelve guns and move them west to the next ridge. Col. Albert S. Hall began the day as regimental commander of the 105th Ohio, and with the deaths of Jackson, Terrill, and Col. George Webster, advanced all the way to command of the 10th Division by the end of the day.

Once again the Federals had a strong defensive position, with good artillery support and a stone wall at the top of a steep slope. Maney&#x27;s and Stewart&#x27;s men attempted three assaults, all unsuccessful, and withdrew to the vicinity of the Open Knob at around 5:30 p.m. The assault by Maney&#x27;s brigade over three hours was the bloodiest of the battle, and arguably its most crucial action. Historian Kenneth W. Noe describes Maney&#x27;s final repulse as the &quot;high-water mark of the Confederacy in the western theater, no less important than the Angle at Gettysburg.&quot;

===Attack from the Confederate center===
The &quot;en echelon&quot; attack continued with Anderson&#x27;s division in the center. At about 2:45 p.m., the same time that Maney&#x27;s first attack was being repulsed on the Open Knob, the brigade of Col. Thomas M. Jones began its attack across a valley commanded by a large sinkhole. Jones had no orders to attack from Anderson or Hardee, but moved forward on his own initiative when he heard the sound of firing to his right. As they entered the valley, his men were cut down by musketry and fire from twelve artillery pieces on the next ridge, where the Union 9th Brigade (Rousseau&#x27;s division) under Col. Leonard A. Harris was posted. Confederate artillery attached to Jones&#x27;s brigade, Capt. Charles Lumsden&#x27;s Alabama Light Artillery, returned fire, but due to an optical illusion that made two successive ridges look the same, were unable to fix on the appropriate range and their fire had no effect on the Federal line. At 3:30 p.m., the Confederate brigade of Brig. Gen. John C. Brown moved up to take the place of Jones&#x27;s retreating men. By this time, most of the Union artillery had had to withdraw to replenish their ammunition, so Brown&#x27;s men did not suffer the same fate as Jones&#x27;s. Nevertheless, they made no headway against the infantry units in place until successes on the Confederate left put pressure on the Union position.

=== Attack from the Confederate left ===
Almost all of McCook&#x27;s I Corps units were posted at the beginning of the battle on land owned by &quot;Squire&quot; Henry P. Bottom. The corps&#x27; right flank, Col. William H. Lytle&#x27;s 17th Brigade, was posted on a ridge on which Squire Bottom&#x27;s house and barn were situated, overlooking a bend in the Chaplin River and a hill and farm owned by R. F. Chatham on the other side. At about 2:30 p.m. Major John E. Austin&#x27;s 14th Battalion of Louisiana Sharpshooters, screening Brig. Gen. Daniel W. Adams&#x27;s Confederate brigade, engaged the 42nd Indiana as it was collecting water in the ravine of Doctor&#x27;s Creek. This began a Confederate attack against this area with Brig. Gen. Bushrod R. Johnson&#x27;s brigade descending from Chatham House Hill at about 2:45 p.m., crossing the almost-dry riverbed and attacking the 3rd Ohio Infantry, commanded by Col. John Beatty. The attack was disorganized; last-minute changes of orders from Buckner were not distributed to all of the participating units and friendly fire from Confederate artillery broke their lines while still on Chatham House Hill. When the infantry attack eventually moved up the hill, fighting from stone wall to stone wall, Confederate artillery bombarded the 3rd Ohio and set afire Squire Bottom&#x27;s log barn. Some of the Union wounded soldiers had sought refuge in the barn and many were burned to death.

The Ohioans withdrew and were replaced in their position by the 15th Kentucky. As Johnson&#x27;s men ran low on ammunition, Brig. Gen. Patrick R. Cleburne&#x27;s brigade entered the battle at about 3:40 p.m. Cleburne&#x27;s horse, Dixie, was killed by an artillery shell, which also wounded Cleburne in the ankle, but he kept his troops moving forward. As they advanced up the slope, they were subjected to Confederate artillery fire; Cleburne later surmised that the friendly fire was caused by his men wearing blue uniform trousers, which had been captured from Union soldiers at Richmond. On Cleburne&#x27;s left, Brig. Gen. Daniel W. Adams&#x27;s brigade joined the attack against the 15th Kentucky, which had been reinforced by three companies of the 3rd Ohio. The Union troops retreated to the west toward the Russell House, McCook&#x27;s headquarters. Lytle was wounded in the head as he attempted to rally his men. He was left on the field for dead, and was captured.

While Lytle&#x27;s brigade was being beaten back, the left flank of Phil Sheridan&#x27;s division was only a few hundred yards to the south on Peters Hill. One of the lingering controversies of the battle has been why he did not choose to join the fight. Earlier in the day he had been ordered by Gilbert not to bring on a general engagement. At around 2 p.m., the sound of artillery fire reached army headquarters where Buell was having dinner with Gilbert; the two generals assumed that it was Union artillery practicing and sent word to Sheridan not to waste gunpowder. Sheridan did project some artillery fire into the Confederate assault, but when Gilbert finally arrived from the rear, he feared that Sheridan would be attacked and ordered him back to his entrenchments.

Sheridan&#x27;s division did participate toward the end of the battle. The Confederate brigade of Col. Samuel Powel (Anderson&#x27;s division) was ordered to advance in conjunction with Adams&#x27;s brigade, on Cleburne&#x27;s left. The two brigades were widely separated, however, with Powel&#x27;s on Edwards House Hill, immediately west of Perryville. At about 4 p.m., Powel received orders from Bragg to advance west on the Springfield Pike to silence the battery of Capt. Henry Hescock, which was firing into the left flank of Bragg&#x27;s assault. Bragg assumed this was an isolated battery, not the entire III Corps. Three regiments of Powel&#x27;s brigade encountered Sheridan&#x27;s division, and although Sheridan was initially concerned by the Confederates&#x27; aggressive attack and sent for reinforcements, the three regiments were quickly repulsed.

Sheridan, who would be characterized in later battles as very aggressive, hesitated to pursue the smaller force, and also refused a request by Daniel McCook to move north in support of his brother&#x27;s corps. However, his earlier request for reinforcements bore fruit and the 31st Brigade of Col. William P. Carlin (Mitchell&#x27;s division) moved up on Sheridan&#x27;s right. Carlin&#x27;s men moved aggressively in pursuit of Powel, chasing them as fast as they could run toward Perryville. As they reached the cemetery on the western outskirts of town, fierce artillery dueling commenced. Carlin pressed forward and was joined by the 21st Brigade of Col. George D. Wagner (Wood&#x27;s division, II Corps). They were poised to capture the town and the critical crossroads that dominated Braxton Bragg&#x27;s avenue of withdrawal, but an order from Gilbert to Mitchell curtailed the advance, despite Mitchell&#x27;s furious protestations.

===Dixville Crossroads===
Bragg&#x27;s attack had been a large pincer movement, forcing both flanks of McCook&#x27;s corps back into a concentrated mass. This mass occurred at the Dixville Crossroads, where the Benton Road crossed the Mackville Road. If the Confederates seized this intersection they could, conceivably, get around the right wing of McCook&#x27;s corps and effectively cut them off from the rest of the army. The southern jaw of the pincer began to slow at the temporary line established at the Russell House. Harris&#x27;s and Lytle&#x27;s brigades defended until Cleburne&#x27;s and Adams&#x27;s attack ground to a halt. The northern jaw had been stopped by Starkweather&#x27;s defense. The remaining attacks came from north of the Mackville Road by two fresh brigades from Buckner&#x27;s division: Brig. Gen. St. John R. Liddell&#x27;s and Brig. Gen. Sterling A. M. Wood&#x27;s.

The initial target of the assault was Col. George Webster&#x27;s 34th Brigade of Jackson&#x27;s division. Webster was mortally wounded during the fighting. His death marked the final senior loss for the 10th Division—the division commander, Jackson, and the other brigade commander, Terrill, had also been mortally wounded. (The previous evening, Jackson, Terrill, and Webster had been idly discussing the possibility of all of them being killed in battle and they dismissed the thought as being mathematically negligible.) Webster&#x27;s infantry and Capt. Harris&#x27;s artillery battery posted on a hill near the Benton Road shot Wood&#x27;s attackers to pieces and they were forced to fall back. They regrouped at the base of the hill and renewed their assault. Harris&#x27;s battery ran low on ammunition and had to withdraw, and the Confederate attack pushed Webster&#x27;s men back toward the crossroads. Col. Michael Gooding&#x27;s 13th Brigade (Mitchell&#x27;s division) arrived on the field from Gilbert&#x27;s corps and took up the fight. Wood&#x27;s men withdrew and were replaced by Liddell&#x27;s.

The arrival of reinforcements was a result of McCook&#x27;s belated attempts to secure aid for his beleaguered corps. At 2:30 p.m. he sent an aide to Sheridan on Peters Hill requesting that he secure I Corps&#x27; right flank. McCook dispatched a second staff officer at 3 p.m. to obtain assistance from the nearest III Corps unit. The officer encountered Brig. Gen. Albin F. Schoepf, commanding the 1st Division, the III Corps&#x27; reserve. Unwilling to act on his own authority, Schoepf referred the staff officer to Gilbert, who in turn referred him to Buell&#x27;s headquarters more than away. The arrival of McCook&#x27;s staff officer at about 4 p.m. surprised the army commander, who had heard little battle noise and found it difficult to believe that a major Confederate attack had been under way for some time. Nevertheless, Buell ordered two brigades from Schoepf&#x27;s division to support I Corps. This relatively minor commitment indicated Buell&#x27;s unwillingness to accept the reported dire situation at face value.

Liddell&#x27;s men fired at an unknown unit less than east of the crossroads. Calls were heard, &quot;You are firing upon friends; for God&#x27;s sake stop!&quot; Leonidas Polk, the wing commander, decided to ride forward to see who had been the victims of the supposedly friendly fire. Polk found that he had ridden by mistake into the lines of the 22nd Indiana and was forced to bluff his way out by riding down the Union line pretending to be a Union officer and shouting at the Federal troops to cease fire. When he had escaped he shouted to Liddell and the Confederates fired hundreds of muskets in a single volley, which killed Col. Squire Keith and caused casualties of 65% in the 22nd Indiana, the highest percentage of any Federal regiment engaged at Perryville. Although Liddell wanted to pursue the assault, Polk had been unnerved by his personal contact with the enemy and halted the attack, blaming the falling darkness. The Union units moved their supplies and equipment through the endangered intersection and consolidated their lines on a chain of hills northwest. McCook&#x27;s corps had been badly damaged during the day, but was not destroyed.

== Aftermath ==
=== Casualties ===
Union casualties totaled 4,276 (894 killed, 2,911 wounded, 471 captured or missing). Confederate casualties were 3,401 (532 killed, 2,641 wounded, 228 captured or missing). In all, casualties totaled one-fifth of those involved.
===Reactions and effects===
Braxton Bragg had arguably won a tactical victory, having fought aggressively and pushed his opponent back for over a mile. But his precarious strategic situation became clear to him as he found out about the III Corps advance on the Springfield Pike, and when he learned late in the day of the II Corps&#x27; presence on the Lebanon Pike. At 9 p.m. he met with his subordinates at the Crawford House and gave orders to begin a withdrawal after midnight, leaving a picket line in place while his army joined up with Kirby Smith&#x27;s. As the army marched toward Harrodsburg, they were forced to leave 900 wounded men behind.

Bragg united his forces with Smith&#x27;s at Harrodsburg, and the Union and Confederate armies, now of comparable size, skirmished with one another over the next week or so, but neither attacked. Bragg soon realized that the new infantry recruits he had sought from Kentucky would not be forthcoming, although many Kentuckians were willing to join the Confederate cavalry. Furthermore, Bragg concluded that he lacked the logistical support he needed to remain in the state. He made his way southeast to Knoxville, Tennessee through the Cumberland Gap. Bragg was quickly called to the Confederate capital, Richmond, Virginia, to explain to Jefferson Davis the charges brought by his officers about how he had conducted his campaign, who were demanding that he be replaced as head of the army. Although Davis decided to leave the general in command, Bragg&#x27;s relationship with his subordinates would be severely damaged. Upon rejoining the army, he ordered a movement to Murfreesboro, Tennessee.

Buell conducted a half-hearted pursuit of Bragg and returned to Nashville, rather than pushing on to East Tennessee as the Lincoln administration had wished. Pent-up dissatisfaction with Buell&#x27;s performance resulted in a reorganization of the Western departments. On October 24, a new Department of the Cumberland was formed under Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans, and Buell&#x27;s Army of the Ohio was assigned to it, redesignated the XIV Corps. (After the Battle of Stones River at Murfreesboro in late December, another strategic defeat for Braxton Bragg, it would receive its more familiar name, the Army of the Cumberland.) Buell was ordered to appear before a commission investigating his conduct during the campaign. He remained in military limbo for a year and a half, his career essentially ruined. He resigned from the service in May 1864.

===Subsequent events===
Following the Battle of Perryville, the Union maintained control of Kentucky for the rest of the war. Historian James M. McPherson considers Perryville to be part of a great turning point of the war, &quot;when battles at Antietam and Perryville threw back Confederate invasions, forestalled European mediation and recognition of the Confederacy, perhaps prevented a Democratic victory in the northern elections of 1862 that might have inhibited the government&#x27;s ability to carry on the war, and set the stage for the Emancipation Proclamation which enlarged the scope and purpose of the conflict.&quot;
 Only two days after the battle, the drought suddenly ended as a cold front pushed through the region and brought rain and cool temperatures across Kentucky.

== Battlefield preservation ==
Portions of the battlefield of Perryville are preserved by the state of Kentucky as Perryville Battlefield State Historic Site. Also the Perryville Historic District covering downtown Perryville includes buildings which had roles in the battle, including the Elmwood mansion which was pressed into use as a field hospital during the battle. The American Battlefield Trust, its members and the Office of Kentucky Nature Preserves’ Kentucky Heritage Land Conservation Fund have saved about 1,202 acres at the Perryville Battlefield through mid-2023.

<text>A diving mask (also half mask, dive mask or scuba mask) is an item of diving equipment that allows underwater divers, including scuba divers, free-divers, and snorkelers, to see clearly underwater. Surface supplied divers usually use a full face mask or diving helmet, but in some systems the half mask may be used. When the human eye is in direct contact with water as opposed to air, its normal environment, light entering the eye is refracted by a different angle and the eye is unable to focus the light on the retina. By providing an air space in front of the eyes, the eye is able to focus nearly normally. The shape of the air space in the mask slightly affects the ability to focus. Corrective lenses can be fitted to the inside surface of the viewport or contact lenses may be worn inside the mask to allow normal vision for people with focusing defects.

When the diver descends, the ambient pressure rises, and it becomes necessary to equalise the pressure inside the mask with the external ambient pressure to avoid the barotrauma known as mask squeeze. This is done by allowing sufficient air to flow out through the nose into the mask to relieve the pressure difference, which requires the nose to be included in the airspace of the mask. Equalisation during ascent is automatic as excess air inside the mask easily leaks out past the seal.

A wide range of viewport shapes and internal volumes are available, and each design will generally fit some shapes of face better than others. A good comfortable fit and a reliable seal around the edges of the rubber skirt is important to the correct function of the mask. National and international standards relating to diving masks provide a means of ensuring that they are manufactured to a suitable quality.

== Function ==
Light rays bend when they travel from one medium to another; the amount of bending is determined by the refractive indices of the two media. If one medium has a particular curved shape, it functions as a lens. The cornea, humours, and crystalline lens of the eye together form a lens system that focuses images on the retina. Our eyes are adapted for viewing in air. Water, however, has approximately the same refractive index as the cornea (both about 1.33), so immersion effectively eliminates the cornea&#x27;s focusing properties. When our eyes are in water, instead of focusing images on the retina, they now focus them far behind the retina, resulting in an extremely blurred image from hypermetropia.

By wearing a flat diving mask, humans can see clearly under water. The scuba mask&#x27;s flat window separates the eyes from the surrounding water by a layer of air. Light rays entering from water into the flat parallel window change their direction minimally within the window material itself. But when these rays exit the window into the air space between the flat window and the eye, the refraction is quite noticeable. The view paths refract (bend) in a manner similar to viewing fish kept in an aquarium.

Refraction of light entering the mask makes objects appear about 34% bigger and 25% nearer when underwater. Also, pincushion distortion and lateral chromatic aberration are noticeable. As the diver descends in clean water, the water acts as a colour filter eliminating the red end of the visible spectrum of the sunlight entering the water leaving only the blue end of the spectrum. Depending on the depth and clarity of the water, eventually all sunlight is blocked and the diver has to rely on artificial light sources to see underwater.

== Construction ==
There are two basic categories of diving mask: The half mask covers the eyes and nose, and the full face mask covers eyes, nose and mouth, and therefore includes a part of the breathing apparatus. The half-mask is described here.

Diving masks may have a single, durable, tempered glass faceplate, or two lenses in front of the eyes. These may be supported by a relatively rigid plastic or metal frame, or they may be permanently bonded to the rim of the skirt, in a construction known as &quot;frameless&quot;. In the case of freediving masks, which need to have a low internal volume to minimize the amount of breath needed to equalize the change of pressure that occurs with depth, the lenses may be made of polycarbonate plastic. The best scuba masks are sealed well. There is usually a &quot;skirt&quot; of synthetic rubber or silicone elastomer to support the frame and lenses and create a watertight seal with the diver&#x27;s face.
The skirt material may be almost transparent, translucent or opaque. A nearly transparent skirt provides a greater peripheral vision, though somewhat distorted, and may reduce the feeling of claustrophobia in some divers, but in some cases the light entering through the sides may cause distracting internal reflections. The skirt also encloses the nose, usually by means of a nose pocket, so that air can be exhaled through the nose into the mask to equalise the internal pressure during descent and thereby avoid possible barotrauma of the enclosed area of the face. The section of the mask covering the nose must allow the wearer to block the nostrils while equalising pressure in the middle ear. All diving masks have means to keep them in position, usually an elastomer strap of similar material to the skirt, but occasionally an expanded neoprene pad with velcro straps is used. Mask straps are usually wider at the back or split into an upper and lower strap at the back of the head for stability and comfort.

Some masks had a one-way purge valve under the nose to let water out, but this is no longer common as they were neither necessary nor reliable, and often leaked.

=== Manufacturing standards ===

Nine national and international standards relating to diving masks are known to exist: British standard BS 4532:1969 (amended 1977); USSR and CIS standard GOST 20568:1975 (Active); German standard DIN 7877:1980; Polish Industry Standard BN-82/8444-17.01 (Active). American national standard ANSI Z87.11:1985 (Active); Austrian standard ÖNORM S 4225:1988; Chinese national standard CNS 12497:1989 (Active); Chinese national standard CNS 12498:1989 (Active); and European standard EN 16805:2015 (Active).

== Visual correction ==

Diving masks can be fitted with prescription lenses for divers needing optical correction to improve vision. Corrective lenses are ground flat on one side and optically cemented to the inside face of the mask lens. This provides the same amount of correction above and below the surface of the water. Bifocal lenses are also available for this application. Some masks are made with removable lenses, and a range of standard corrective lenses are available which can be fitted. Plastic self-adhesive lenses that can be applied to the inside of the mask may fall off if the mask is flooded for a significant period. Contact lenses may be worn under a mask or helmet, but there is some risk of losing them if the mask is dislodged in turbulent water.

== Fit ==
A mask is considered to fit well when it seals comfortably and effectively all round the skirt, and provides a good field of vision, without pressing on the nose or forehead while in use underwater. A low internal volume is considered desirable by freedivers, as less breath is wasted to equalise, and by scuba divers, as there is less tendency to press up under the nose due to buoyancy, which becomes uncomfortable quite quickly.

Divers may test whether a mask is a good fit by placing it on their face, without using the straps, and gently inhaling through their nose. If the mask stays on without any help this indicates that no air is being drawn in and that the skirt is in sufficient contact with the facial skin all the way round the mask. Optimum sealing requires that hair strands do not cross under the edge of the seal, as they can provide a path for water to leak into the mask. This is more a problem with the forehead hairline than with lower facial hair, as water from the top tends to run into the eyes, while water pooling at the bottom is easily purged by exhaling a small volume of air through the nose. Most bearded divers learn to manage the slight leakage without difficulty, inconvenience, or greasing the moustache. Other factors affecting a comfortable fit are sufficient space for the nose in the nose pocket, no contact between the rigid mask frame and the bridge of the nose, and no excessive pressure on the forehead. There should also be sufficient space between the mask lenses and the face that the eyelashes do not contact the glass noticeably when blinking.

== Use ==
The strap can be adjusted to suit the diver&#x27;s head. Too loose may not provide an effective seal and the mask may dislodge easily, and too tight may result in discomfort or pain. Correct positioning of the strap around the back of the head will reduce the risk of dislodging and facilitate clearing.

When entering the water while wearing the mask, the diver may need to manually prevent water impact from dislodging or knocking off the mask. Alternatively, a diver can enter the water with the mask off and then put it on or use an entry method which does not result in fast water flow over the mask. Wearing the mask pushed up onto the forehead while out of the water or on the surface increases the risk of the mask falling or being knocked off.

To prevent a mask from fogging up due to condensation on the glass many divers spit into the dry mask before use, spread the saliva around the inside of the plate and rinse it out with a little water. The saliva residue allows condensation to wet the glass and form a continuous film, rather than form droplets. There are commercial products that can be used as an alternative to the saliva method, some of which are more effective and last longer.

Standard maintenance is to rinse inside and out with clean, fresh water after each day&#x27;s use, and allow to dry out of direct sunlight before storage. Ultraviolet light degrades the synthetic materials of the skirt and frame. A well-maintained mask should last for several years. The strap is the most stressed component and is often the first part to fail, but can usually be replaced. Inspection of the strap for cracks and tears before use can reduce the risk of failure during a dive.

Mask removal and refitting underwater and clearing are basic skills that all divers must learn so that they can deal with flooding and leaks or the mask being dislodged without panic.

=== Mask clearing ===

It is quite common for water to leak into the mask, which can be annoying, or interfere with clear vision, and the diver needs to be able to get rid of the water quickly and effectively. Reasons for the leakage include poor fit or fitting, leaking via head or facial hair, movement of the facial muscles causing temporary leaks, or impact of external objects against the mask, which may distort it temporarily, or move it so that it leaks, or in extreme cases dislodge it entirely from the diver&#x27;s head.

The methods of clearing differ between the half mask, which covers the eyes and nose, and the full-face mask, which also covers the mouth. If the mask has a purge valve and the strap tension is correct, the diver holds the head so that the valve is at the lowest point and exhales through the nose. If the mask is a good fit on the diver&#x27;s face and the strap is correctly placed, exhaling through the nose will usually drive water out along the bottom edge of the skirt. It may be necessary to press the upper part of the mask against the face to improve the seal if the diver is rolled to one side. If the fit is not perfect, or the strap is too low, contact pressure of the top edge against the forehead may be insufficient to maintain a seal when the head is upright.

=== Equalizing ===
The pressure changes during ascent and descent may affect gas spaces in the diver and diving equipment. A change in pressure will cause a pressure difference between the gas space and environment which will cause the gas to expand or compress if that is possible, and constraining the gas from expanding or compressing to balance the pressure may cause damage to the surrounding material or tissues by over-expansion or crushing. Some gas spaces, such as the mask, will automatically release excess gas as it expands during ascent, but have to be equalized during compression of descent.

Equalising of the mask is an essential skill for any form of diving. Goggles that do not cover the nose can not be equalised and are unsuitable for diving. The mask is equalised by exhaling sufficient air through the nose to provide a balanced internal pressure. Any excess will simply leak out around the skirt. Equalising (or clearing) the ears is necessary to prevent barotrauma to the middle and inner ear. Some divers need to pinch the nostrils closed as part of their equalisation technique, and this must be allowed for in the design of the mask skirt.

== Types of diving half-mask ==
Early diving masks were made with a single pane of glass or transparent plastic, usually elliptical, but sometimes circular or approximately rectangular or triangular with rounded sides and corners. These masks have indentations in the skirt at the bottom on either side of the nose, into which the diver can insert a thumb and forefinger to pinch the nose, when performing a valsalva maneuver to clear their ears. This design was improved by bringing the window closer to the face, reducing the volume of air inside the mask, thus making mask clearing easier. The window has a cutout to fit around the nose, which is covered by the rubber or silicone material of the skirt. This facilitates pinching the nose when ear-clearing.

A further development is the mask with two windows, one for each eye. It can have the windows closer to the face than the one-window type, and therefore contain less internal volume for the diver to clear or equalise, and a lower buoyancy. These types are often called a &quot;low-volume mask&quot;. Participants in the sport of underwater hockey are required to use twin-lens masks of this type for their own safety – the sport uses a heavy lead puck similar to an ice hockey puck, but skillful players can flick the puck a considerable height off the bottom when making passes which leads to the possibility of accidental puck contact with other players. Should a puck hit the lens of a single-lens mask it may break the glass and pass through the aperture to hit the face and eyes, but with a twin-lens mask, though the glass may break, the frame will prevent the passage of the puck any further.

Recent innovations have produced more complex designs, intended to provide extra features:
* The double-dome mask. This was invented by HydroOptix. Double-dome masks allow a wider field of view and avoid the refraction error in perceived distance and size of objects. Underwater the curved mask windows make the diver&#x27;s vision effectively more hyperopic, or less myopic, and the diver must wear special contact lenses to compensate (unless their eyes are myopic to the right amount to compensate exactly for the refraction at the curved mask windows). The diver&#x27;s vision will become myopic when they put their head out of water with the contact lenses in.
* The &quot;Data Mask&quot;, or integrated diver display mask, developed by Oceanic, is a half mask with a built-in LCD head up display which displays various dive and breathing set conditions including the function of a diving computer, depth and tank pressures.

== Alternative equipment ==

There are other types of equipment for underwater vision enhancement:
* Full face diving mask – often worn by working divers who need underwater verbal communication ability.
* Lightweight demand diving helmet – usually worn by divers using surface supplied diving equipment.
* Copper standard diving helmet – part of the early standard diving dress or other free-flow helmet.
* Fluid filled mask – the need to equilibrate the internal pressure in the mask by exhaling air through the nose reduces the freediver&#x27;s capacity to dive deep. Masks or swimming goggles with high power lenses (40-200 diopters) have been developed which are filled with water or saline fluid, which do not need to be equalised.
* Contact lenses of suitable power have been tried but are not in common use.

<text>The Syro-Malankara Catholic Church, also known as the Malankara Syrian Catholic Church, is an Eastern Catholic &quot;sui iuris&quot; particular church that employs the West Syriac Rite and is in full communion with the worldwide Catholic Church possessing self-governance under the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches (CCEO). It is one of the major archiepiscopal churches of the Catholic Church. It is headed by Major Archbishop Baselios Cardinal Cleemis Catholicos of the Major Archdiocese of Trivandrum based in Kerala, India. With more than 1096 parishes, it is one of India&#x27;s biggest church evangelical establishments.The Malankara Syrian Catholic Church traces its origins to the missions of Thomas the Apostle in the 1st century. The Church employs the West Syriac Rite Divine Liturgy of Saint James. It is one of the two Eastern Catholic churches in India, the other being the Syro-Malabar Church which employs the East Syriac Rite liturgy.

The Malankara Syrian Catholic Church was formed on 20 September 1930 as a result of the reunion movement under the leadership of Archbishop Geevarghese Ivanios, when it split from the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church and entered into communion with the Catholic Church. The Malankara Church itself had emerged from the split within the Saint Thomas Christian community of the 17th century; after the Coonan Cross Oath in 1653, the Malankara Church emerged as the faction that stood with Archdeacon Thoma I in swearing to resist the authority of the Latin Catholic Portuguese &quot;Padroado&quot;. This faction entered into a relationship with the Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch and adopted the West Syriac Rite (the Saint Thomas Christians of India had until this point used the East Syriac Rite inherited from the historic Church of the East). The Syro-Malankara Catholic Church represents the group from this Malankara faction that reunited with Rome in the 20th century (1930), though retaining the West Syriac liturgical rite.

Mar Ivanios started to have negotiations with the Holy See of Rome in 1926 to enter into a new communion. The two bishops including Ivanios, a priest, a deacon and a layman were received into the Catholic Church together on 1930. By 1950 there were some 65,588 faithful, in 1960 112,478, and in 1970 183,490. There are now over 400,000 faithful in over 12 dioceses in India and across the world.

==History==

===Pre-Coonan Cross Oath===
The St. Thomas Christians, also known as Nasranis, are an ancient Christian community in India with origins traditionally traced to the evangelistic activities of Thomas the Apostle in the 1st century CE. Situated primarily in the southwestern state of Kerala, the St. Thomas Christians developed a unique identity blending elements of Indian and Syriac Christian traditions. They maintained a hierarchical ecclesiastical structure, often aligning with the East Syriac Church (under the Church of the East) and later the Chaldean Catholic Church. The community largely followed Eastern Christian liturgy, practiced Syriac liturgical traditions, and were in communion with the Patriarch of the East based in Persia.

The arrival of Portuguese explorers in India in the late 15th century marked the beginning of significant European influence on the St. Thomas Christians. The Portuguese sought to bring the Indian Christians into conformity with the Latin Catholic Church and asserted their religious and administrative control through the establishment of the Diocese of Goa. This led to tensions, as the Portuguese pressured the community to abandon Eastern practices and adopt Latinized customs, culminating in the Synod of Diamper in 1599, which formally placed the St. Thomas Christians under the jurisdiction of the Catholic Archbishopric of Goa and imposed Latin rites and customs. These measures sparked resistance among the St. Thomas Christians, who sought to preserve their traditions and ecclesiastical autonomy. By the mid-17th century, these grievances intensified, setting the stage for the historic Coonan Cross Oath.

===Coonan Cross Oath===

A protest took place in 1653 with the Coonan Cross Oath (Oath of the bent cross). Under the leadership of Archdeacon Thomas, the Thomas Christians publicly took an oath that they would not obey the Jesuit Bishops. Church historian KOOTHUR observes that &quot;the &#x27;Coonan Cross&#x27; revolution obviously was the final outbreak of the storm that had been gathering on the horizon of the ecclesial life of the St. Thomas Christians for over a century.&quot;

Rome sent Carmelites in two groups from the Propagation of the Faith to Malabar headed by Fr. Sebastiani and Fr. Hyacinth. Fr. Sebastiani arrived first in 1655 and began to speak directly with the archdeacon, Thoma I. Fr. Sebastiani, with the help of Portuguese, gained the support of many, especially with the support of Palliveettil Chandy, Kadavil Chandy Kathanar and Vengoor Geevarghese Kathanar. These were the three of the four counselors of Thoma I, who along with Thoma I, had defected with Francisco Garcia Mendes, Archbishop of Cranganore, before the arrival of Sebastaini, according to Jesuit reports.

Between 1661 and 1662, out of the 116 churches, the Carmelites claimed eighty-four churches, leaving the native Thoma I with thirty-two churches. The eighty-four churches and their congregations were the body from which the Syro Malabar Church and Chaldean Syrian Church have descended. The other thirty-two churches and their congregations represented the nucleus from which the Malankara Syriac Orthodox Church (Jacobite Church), Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church (Indian Orthodox), the Malabar Independent Syrian Church (Thozhiyur Church), Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church (Reformed Syrians), and Syro-Malankara Catholic Church have originated.

In 1665 Gregorios, a bishop sent by the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch, arrived in India. The independent group under the leadership of the archdeacon welcomed him. Though most of the St. Thomas Christians gradually relented in their strong opposition to the Western control, the arrival of Bishop Gregorios of the Syriac Orthodox Church in 1665 marked the beginning of a formal schism among the St. Thomas Christians. Those who accepted the West Syriac liturgical tradition of the Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch of Gregorios became known as the &quot;Puthenkoor&quot;. Those who were in the communion of Rome after the Synod of Daimper and remained in the communion even after the oath of bent cross, and those who rejoined the Catholic communion from the &quot;Puthenkoor&quot; church during the Carmelite period, came to be known as the &quot;Pazhayakoor&quot;. 

Both factions continued to use the name &quot;Malankara&quot;, the real name of the St. Thomas Christian community for the church. Some of the &quot;Pazhayakoor&quot; churches not joined in the &quot;Angamaly Padiyola&quot; (1787) later became Latin churches, e.g. Mathilakom (Pappinivattom), Maliankara, Thuruthipuram, etc. One branch of the &quot;Pazhayakoor&quot; Church later re-established ties with the Assyrian Church of the East and formed the Chaldean Syrian Church when an East Syriac bishop, Gabriel, came to evangelize them in 1701. Kottayam Cheriapally was the headquarters of Gabriel.

The remaining &quot;Pazhayakoor&quot; christians came to be known as the Syro Malabar Church from the last decade of the Nineteenth century onwards.

===Post-Coonan Cross Oath===
It was in this contentious context that the 118th Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch, Ignatius Abded Aloho II, went to Malankara in 1911 and excommunicated Vattasseril Geevarghese Dionysius (This excommunication was declared invalid by the High Court of Travancore). To ward off the undue interference of the Patriarch in the administration of the temporalities of the Church, Fr. P.T. Geevarghese with the blessing of Vattasseril Thirumeni contacted Ignatius Abdul Masih II, the 117th Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch, who had been excommunicated by the Ottoman government in 1906, and invited him to visit Malankara and to establish a Catholicate here. Accordingly, Ignatius Abdul Masih II went to Malankara in 1912 and established the Catholicate in Malankara. This created a split in the church:
*the faction resisting the Patriarch&#x27;s administrative interference became the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, an autocephalous Church under Malankara Metropolitan and the Catholicos;
*the faction supporting the Patriarch&#x27;s administration became the Malankara Syriac Orthodox Church (known today as the &quot;Jacobite Syrian Christian Church&quot;).

Baselios Paulose I (1912–1913), the first Catholicos, died after a short period of five months on 13 May 1913; the See remained vacant until 1925. That was a period of litigation in the Malankara Church. The litigation for Vattippanam (a fixed deposit of money in the name of the Church) and its after-effects in the community was at its zenith.

=== Pre-Ecclesial communion ===

In the early 20th century, Geevarghese Ivanios emerged as a pivotal figure in the development of the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church. Born on 21 September 1882 in Mavelikara, he was raised in the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church and later pursued education at M.D. Seminary School in Kottayam. After completing high school, he furthered his studies at Madras Christian College, earning a master’s degree. In 1908, he was ordained as a priest by Vattasseril Geevarghese Dionysius and appointed principal of M.D. Seminary, a position that allowed him to shape future church leaders. Later, he accepted an invitation to teach at Serampore College in Calcutta, where he also founded a monastic community.

Upon returning to Kerala, Ivanios established the Bethany Ashram on land donated by his friend E. John Vakeel in Mundanmala, Ranni-Perunadu. This ashram, founded on 15 August 1919, served as a center for spiritual renewal and monastic life, with an additional outreach for orphan care. His monastic vision expanded in 1925 with the founding of the Bethany Madhom, a convent for women religious, inspired by the Epiphany Sisters of England.

Ivanios was consecrated as a bishop in the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church by Catholicos Beselios Geevarghese I on 1 May 1925, taking the name Geevarghese Ivanios. However, he later advocated for reunification with the Catholic Church, leading a movement that ultimately established the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church. 

=== Ecclesial communion ===
On 20 September 1930 Ivanios, Bishop Jacob Theophilos, Fr. John Kuzhinapurath OIC, Dn. Alexander OIC, and Chacko Kilileth embraced and united with the Catholic Church. The Union Movement under the leadership of Ivanios gave rise to Malankara Catholic Church. This took place in the Quilon bishop’s chapel. The members of the Jacobite Church were received by his Lordship Bishop Aloysius Maria Benziger (Bishop of Quilon), whom Ivanios approached for help and who was deputed by the Holy See to perform the reception.

=== Post-Ecclesial communion ===
Pope Pius XI, through the Apostolic Constitution &quot;Christo Pastorum Principi&quot; of 11 June 1932, established the Syro-Malankara Catholic hierarchy for the reunited community and erected the Archeparchy of Thiruvananthapuram with the Eparchy of Tiruvalla as its suffragan. The Metropolitan Eparchy of Thiruvananthapuram was established in 1933. Ivanios was enthroned as its first Metropolitan Archbishop. The Eparchy of Tiruvalla was established in 1933. Jacob Theophilos was enthroned as its first bishop.

In 1937 Joseph Severios of the Malankara Orthodox Church joined the Catholic Church. In 1939, Thomas Dioscoros, the metropolitan of the Knanaya Jacobite Church, joined the Catholic Church. In 1938, the missionary congregation of the Daughters of Mary was founded at Marthandom in Kanyakumari District. Bishop Dioscoros died in 1943.

Ivanios consecrated Benedict Gregorios as his auxiliary bishop in 1953. Ivanios died on 15 July 1953.

The Eparchy of Tiruvalla was led by Jacob Theophilos and Joseph Severios. Severios was the administrator of the eparchy until 1950 due to the ill health of Theophilos. In 1950 he was appointed as the bishop of Tiruvalla. He was also invested with the title &quot;archbishop&quot;. He died on 18 January 1955.
In 1955 Metropolitan Archbishop Benedict Gregorios was enthroned as the metropolitan archbishop of Thiruvananthapuram and the head of the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church.

The Holy See appointed Zacharias Athanasios as successor to Severios; his consecration took place in 1954. Jacob Theophilos died in 1956.

Francis Acharya, a Cistercian monk, came to the Eparchy of Tiruvalla. In the year 1957 he founded the Kristiya Sanyasa Samaj, Kurisumala Ashram in the high ranges of Vagamon.

In 1958 the territorial boundary of the Eparchy of Tiruvalla was extended north to include the Malabar region of Kerala, the civil districts of Coimbatore and Nilgiris and Karoor Taluk in Tiruchirappally District of Tamil Nadu and districts of Mysore, Mandya, Coorg, Hasan, Chickamangalore, Shimoga and South Kanara of Karnataka State.

Athanasios died in 1977.

Paulos Philoxenos, the metropolitan of the Malabar Independent Syrian Church, was received into the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church on 28 August 1977.

The appointment of Isaac Yoohanon as Bishop of Tiruvalla and erection of the Eparchy of Bathery with the appointment of Cyril Baselios as its first bishop through the decree of the Holy See took place in 1978. Both prelates were consecrated that year.

The Eparchy of Bathery was officially inaugurated in 1978. In 1979 the Eparchial contemplative monastery, Dhyana Ashram, was founded in the Eparchy of Bathery by Fr. Silvester Kozhimannil.

Lawrence Ephrem was consecrated bishop in 1980.

==Around the world==
===North America===
The eparchy of the United States of America and Canada was initially established as an apostolic exarchate by Pope Benedict XVI in July 2010. Father Thomas Naickamparampil, then serving as secretary general of the Major Archiepiscopate of the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church, was appointed the first apostolic exarch. He was consecrated as bishop on 21 September 2010 at St. Mary&#x27;s Malankara Syrian Catholic Cathedral in Pattom, adopting the episcopal name Aboon Thomas Eusebius. His enthronement took place on 3 October 2010 at Kellenberg High School in Uniondale, New York.

On 4 January 2016, Pope Francis elevated the exarchate to the status of an eparchy, expanding its jurisdiction to include Canada. Subsequently, Bishop Philippos Mar Stephanos was appointed as the eparchy&#x27;s second bishop on 5 August 2017, succeeding Bishop Thomas Mar Eusebius. Bishop Mar Stephanos was installed on 28 October 2017.

As of now, the eparchy oversees 19 parishes and missions, with 14 located in the United States and five in Canada.

=== Europe and Oceania ===
In 2017, Pope Francis appointed Bishop Yoohanon Mar Theodosius as Apostolic Visitor for Syro-Malankara Catholics residing in Europe and Oceania. This appointment was in addition to his role as Bishop of the Major Archiepiscopal Curia of the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church. The Syro-Malankara communities in these regions are present in several countries, including Germany, Austria, Ireland, Italy, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand.

===Middle East===
The Syro-Malankara Catholic Church has a presence in Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, with a total of thirteen communities. These communities do not have an organized ecclesiastical jurisdiction and remain under the supervision of the Latin Church&#x27;s Apostolic Vicariates of Northern Arabia and Apostolic Vicariates of Southern Arabia. Qatar is the only country in the region with an officially organized Syro-Malankara parish.

The Syro-Malankara faithful in the Gulf region have been proactive in their online engagement, with early websites being launched to connect the community before the establishment of official church platforms. Currently, most communities in the region maintain their own websites to support pastoral activities.

In recent developments, Rev. Fr. Mathew Kandathil, a Syro-Malankara priest serving in the Apostolic Vicariate of Southern Arabia, has been appointed as the Coordinator for the Malankara Catholic faithful in the Middle East. He oversees pastoral activities and coordinates the efforts of Syro-Malankara priests in the Gulf region, facilitating religious services and community engagement.

In North India, it functions under the Apostolic Visitation for Malankara Syrian Catholic Churches (MCCETR – New Delhi). Internationally, MCYM serves the Syro-Malankara Catholic Eparchy of the United States and Canada, headquartered in Elmont, New York, through the Malankara Catholic Youth Movement of North America (MCYM-NA).&quot;&quot;

<doc id="489997" wikidata="Q6964481" url="?curid=489997" title="Schism of the Russian Church">
<text>The Schism of the Russian Church, also known as  (, , meaning &#x27;split&#x27; or &#x27;schism&#x27;), was the splitting of the Russian Orthodox Church into an official church and the Old Believers movement in the 1600s. It was triggered by the reforms of Patriarch Nikon in 1653, which aimed to establish uniformity between Greek and Russian church practices. In the 1630s and 1640s, Nikon had been a part of a group known as the Zealots of Piety, a circle of church reformers whose acts included amending service books in accordance with the &quot;correct&quot; Russian tradition. When Nikon became Patriarch of Moscow in 1652, he continued the practice of amending books under the guidance of Greek Orthodox advisors, changing practices in the Russian Church to align with the Greek rite. This act, along with the acceptance of the Nikonian reforms by Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich and the state, led to the rupture between Old Believers and the newly reformed church and state.

The schism contributed to popular uprisings in the late 1600s, including the Solovetsky Monastery uprising and the Moscow uprising of 1682, but by the time of Peter the Great in the early 1700s, much of the popular uproar had waned. Despite persecution, Old Believer communities have persisted to the present day, chiefly in Russia and Eastern Europe.

==Earlier reforms==
At the beginning of the 1600s, the Orthodox Church in Russia was threatened by a period of political crisis known as the Time of Troubles. In 1598, Tsar Feodor I died without an heir, leaving Russia in a state of apparent lawlessness until the ascension of Tsar Michael I in 1613. During this time, the position of the Orthodox Church was twice imperiled. First, the usurper False Dmitry I was crowned tsar in 1605 and converted to Catholicism before being assassinated during an uprising in 1606, and later Moscow was occupied from 1610 to 1612 by the Catholic Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth during the Polish–Russian War. These dangers to the Orthodox Church, and the entire period of violent instability, aroused a renewal of religious fervor among some Russians who perceived the events as divine retribution for a lack of devotion.

This heightened religiosity was materialized in the Zealots of Piety, a renewal movement aimed at reforming liturgy and embracing piety. The movement&#x27;s early members included the Archbishop of Novgorod Nikon and Archpriests , , and Avvakum, with secular support from Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich and his supporters Fyodor Rtishchev and Boris Morozov. In the 1630s and 1640s, during the reign of Patriarch of Moscow Joseph, the Zealots of Piety were concerned primarily with reforming a disordered liturgy and suppressing impious pre-Christian festivals, issues which had been prominent since the Stoglav Sobor of 1551. In 1636, Nerov and other priests sent a petition to the Patriarch from Nizhny Novgorod requesting aid in reforming &quot;liturgical shortcuts&quot;. Complaints included the use of ( ), the practice of chanting multiple parts of the services at the same time, singing evening vespers in the morning, and omitting parts of the service altogether. The Patriarch responded by ordering parish clergy to prohibit such behavior. The petition further cited the observance among villagers of pre-Christian festivals such as Koliada, to which Tsar Alexei responded by decreeing a ban on the pagan entertainment.

Joseph&#x27;s reign as Patriarch of Moscow was marked by a decline of the political power of the position. During the reign of the previous Patriarch, Filaret of Moscow, from 1619 to 1633, the Patriarch served as de jure ruler of the church and had a powerful influence on the state. In contrast, Joseph was unable to intercede in public affairs, and the state began to interfere in ecclesiastical affairs. In 1652, Joseph died. Many members of the Zealots of Piety urged Tsar Alexei to appoint Stephen Vonifatiev to the position, as he was the movement&#x27;s informal leader, but the Tsar instead appointed Nikon to the seat, as Nikon had been the Tsar&#x27;s spiritual advisor and close companion since 1646. Nikon was a Volga Finn born to a peasant family, and his harsh upbringing meant he took an uncompromising stance as Patriarch and reformer.

==Nikon&#x27;s reforms==

In 1653, with support from the Tsar, Patriarch Nikon began the process of changing the Russian divine service books to align with their contemporary Greek counterparts and changed certain liturgical rituals. Nikon&#x27;s reforms of the service books were performed on the advice of Ukrainian and Greek monks and advisors. The former were a more learned and reactionary group than native Muscovite priests, having adapted Catholic Counter-Reformation rhetoric to the defense of the Orthodox Church, while the latter had an obvious bias in favor of the Greek rite. Among liturgical rituals, the most controversial changes included replacing the two-finger sign of the cross by one with three fingers and pronouncing &quot;hallelujah&quot; three times instead of two. These new reforms met with resistance from both the clergy and the people, who disputed the legitimacy and correctness of these reforms. Avvakum and other clergymen called Nikon a heretic, and the boyars saw Nikon&#x27;s reforms and the renewal of the Patriarch&#x27;s political power as a challenge to their own influence on the state.

The major claim made by Nikon&#x27;s opposition was that the Russian pre-reform faith more closely adhered to the practices of the early church, since the fall of Constantinople had corrupted the Greek rite while Russians had preserved the church. This idea of the Moscow patriarchy as uncorrupted meant that observance of the Greek practices was apostasy. This tension between reformation and preservation of texts had been an issue in the Russian Church long before Nikon, as the Zealots of Piety and other reformers understood that consistent texts were necessary for consistent worship. However, while the conservative Zealots viewed the original Muscovite texts as inviolable and sacred, and viewed the reformation as a process of consolidating a preserved faith, Nikon was convinced by his advisors that the Russian practices were in error compared to the unalloyed Greek rite. Nikon was following the guidance of the 1593 Council of Constantinople, which required the adherence of the newly created Moscow Patriarchate to the Greek rite, while opponents of the reforms protested that the &quot;correct&quot; Greek books had been printed in Venetian, Catholic print houses for the Greek church of the Islamic Ottoman Empire. Since Nikon&#x27;s reforms held that not only the service books but the liturgical practices of the pre-reform rite were heretical, he implied that pre-reform saints were also in error, a point often brought up by opponents of the reforms.

A traditional view of Nikon&#x27;s reforms is that they only affected the external ritualistic side of the Russian Orthodox faith and that the Schism concerned only fanatics who superstitiously clung to pre-reform Russian customs. However, these reforms alienated the largely illiterate peasantry, for whom rituals such as the sign of the cross were inseparable from orthodox doctrine. Furthermore, the reforms established radically different relations between the church and the faithful. Nikon used his reforms for the purpose of centralization of the church and strengthening of his own authority; for example, Nikon would seize land and use the Russian Church&#x27;s wealth to found his own monastic ventures such as the New Jerusalem Monastery. The earlier reforms of the Zealots of Piety were aimed at consolidating the power of priests in their own parish in order to combat local disorder, but the Nikonian reforms were aimed at consolidating the Patriarch&#x27;s control over the parishes. These offenses alienated the Tsar, first leading to Nikon&#x27;s flight from Moscow to one of his monasteries and later to Nikon&#x27;s deposition at the Great Moscow Synod of 1666, a council convened by the Tsar himself. The official reason for the gathering was to try Nikon for dereliction of duty during his absence from Moscow, but as part of its proceedings the council also declared the Stoglav Sobor of 1551 heretical, as it had dogmatized pre-reform Russian practices such as the two-finger sign of the cross, which was unacceptable under the Greek rite. The council was the consummation of the Nikonian reformation crisis, and marked the beginning of the Old Believer movement, as it was at this synod that Avvakum and other Old Believer priests were finally anathematized and exiled.

== Uprisings and persecution ==

The case brought by the defenders of the old practices found many supporters among different strata of the Russian society. Some of the low-ranking clergy protested against the increase of feudal oppression coming from the church leaders in the form of monastic serfdom, while some members of the high-ranking clergy joined the Raskol movement due to their discontent over Nikon&#x27;s authoritative aspirations and the arbitrariness of his church reforms. The unification of such heterogeneous forces against what had become the &quot;official&quot; church could be explained by the somewhat contradictory ideology of the Raskol movement. A certain idealization and conservation of traditional values and old traditions, a critical attitude towards innovations, the conservation of national originality, and the acceptance of martyrdom in the name of the old faith were intertwined with criticism of the traditional practices of feudalism and serfdom. Different social strata were attracted to different sides of this ideology.

In the upper strata of ecclesiastic elites, Nikon&#x27;s former friends among the Zealots of Piety were his most outspoken critics. Ivan Neronov spoke against the strengthening of patriarch&#x27;s authority and demanded democratization of ecclesiastic management, while Avvakum directly protested the reformed rituals. However, both had already come into conflict with the Church before their participation in the Raskol: Neronov was engaged in a dispute over the collection of taxes, and Avvakum quarreled over assuming Neronov&#x27;s position as Archpriest after Neronov&#x27;s exile from Moscow. The first martyr for the pre-reform belief was Bishop Paul of Kolomna, who was burned in Novgorod in 1656 for defending the pre-reform texts. According to Old Believer tradition, Avvakum and his companions were burned in 1682. Secular aristocrats also participated in the Raskol movement, such as Boyarynya Feodosia Morozova and her sister Princess Evdokia Urusova, who openly supported the defenders of the old faith and were also martyred. Avvakum had been Morozova&#x27;s confessor, and she followed Avvakum in rejecting the Nikonian reforms. After convincing her sister to join the Raskol, the two were arrested by the Tsar in 1671 and were starved to death in 1675.

In the lower strata of the popular, peasant defense of the old traditions, opposition often materialized as popular uprisings. Some of the supporters of the Old Believers took part in Stepan Razin&#x27;s rebellion in 16701671. After Razin&#x27;s beheading, many of his supporters joined other Raskol popular movements, such as the Solovetsky Monastery uprising and the Moscow uprising of 1682. At the Solovetsky Monastery, both monks and enserfed peasants rebelled against Tsarist authority, opposing what they saw as the exploitation of secular power: for the monks, this was the consolidation of central authority during the church schism, and for the peasants, this was feudal system which supported the centralizing Nikonian reforms. Both groups were united in their defense of the Old Belief. In the Moscow uprising of 1682, Old Believers openly preached to the Moscow Streltsy regiments who were in rebellion due to discontent with their superiors, and one of the leaders of the rebels, Prince Ivan Andreevich Khovansky, openly supported the pre-reform traditions. While occupying the capital, part of the rebel unit&#x27;s conditions were that the official church must agree to a public disputation with the Old Believer priest Nikita Pustosvyat; his well-known debate with Patriarch Joachim of Moscow led to his beheading and to the Moscow uprising&#x27;s alternative title as the &quot;Raskolnik rebellion&quot;.

== Old Believers movement ==
In the wake of the persecutions of the 1600s, it was clear to many schismatics that reunion with the Russian Orthodox Church would be impossible. As a result of their conflict with official church hierarchy, the Old Believers never formed a united movement. Instead, it was largely a movement of independent factions on the edges of the Russian empire, far from persecution and state authority. Old Believers fled to the dense forests of Northern Russia and Volga region, the southern borders of Russia, Siberia, and even abroad, where they would organize their own obshchinas. Many of the members of the old faith migrated west, seeking refuge bordering the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, where the Warsaw Compact allowed them to practice their faith freely. In 1684, Princess Sophia, with active support from the Russian Orthodox Church, began to persecute the so-called ( &#x27;schismatics&#x27;). Up to this point, Old Believers had merely been anathematized, but following Sophia&#x27;s ukaz, local governments were commanded to burn all schismatics at the stake unless they submitted to the Nikonian reforms. The majority of Old Believers were peasants or cossacks, but this persecution inadvertently attracted members of the merchant class to the schismatics. Merchants were expected to collect taxes for the state, but since schismatics were persecuted by the government, schismatic merchants were exempt from this duty.

The memory of their schism with the official Russian Orthodox Church is fundamental to the Old Believers movement. Much of their literary canon consists of letters written by priests such as Avvakum, , and during Nikon&#x27;s reforms, as well as literature depicting Nikon as a devil or Antichrist. Particularly important to the canon is Avvakum&#x27;s &quot;The Life Written By Himself&quot;, an account of his various exiles by authorities to Siberia. Since the Old Believers were denied the use of the printing press to print their literature and unrevised service books, they developed a robust tradition of manuscript writing and book collecting.

== Apocalypticism ==
The most radical defenders of the Old Belief preached a message of apocalypticism and the coming of the Antichrist in connection with Nikon&#x27;s reforms. Following the Time of Troubles, loss of ecclesiastic power and the legal enserfment of peasants in the Sobornoye Ulozheniye (not to mention a plague in Moscow), there was a general atmosphere of the end-times in Russia in the middle of the 1600s. The more famous early schismatics, such as Avvakum and his brothers-in-exile at the Pustozyorsk prison, often justified this time of strife as God&#x27;s punishment of the ecclesiastic and tsarist authorities for their erroneous reforms. Nikon, being the figurehead of the reforms, was often framed in Old Believer tales either as an accomplice to the Antichrist, or even the Antichrist himself. Other state authorities, especially those who persecuted the Old Believers, such as Tsar Alexei, would also be decried by schismatics as agents of the Devil. The reforms of Nikon were seen by some Old Believers as direct manifestations of the Antichrist, with the altered sign of the cross compared to the mark of the beast, and the year of the 1666 Moscow Synod seen as indicating the number of the beast. By condemning its own saints and historical rituals, Old Believers further believed that Nikon&#x27;s reforms plunged the Third Rome, Russia, into heresy, which was a clear indication of the end-times.

These ideas of the Antichrist&#x27;s arrival on Earth and of the end-times found a broad response among the Russian people, who sympathized with the ideology of these more radical apologetes. The most dramatic practices of the Raskol included the practice of (, or baptism by fire), practiced by those who thought that the end of the world was near. Rather than submit to apostasy or to the Antichrist, Old Believers would burn themselves alive. These practices were inspired by the martyrs of the early Christian church, as well as the practices of earlier fringe ascetic movements, such as the self-immolating followers of Kapiton in the middle of the 1600s. This practice of active, fiery martyrdom gradually died out as the schism cooled down at the beginning of the 1700s. During the reign of Peter the Great, Old Believers who were not active political dissidents were no longer persecuted, so Old Believers no longer needed to martyr themselves rather than submit to the rule of what they perceived as agents of the Antichrist.

Kapiton&#x27;s self-immolating followers, the ( ), appeared in Russia at the same time as the Zealots of Piety and were equally inspired by the sense of Armageddon following the Time of Troubles; however, while the Zealots practiced optimistic conservation of ecclesiastic rites, the &quot;lesnye startsy&quot; believed in a kind of pessimistic triumph of the Antichrist over the world, where ecclesiastic rites were no longer meaningful. The Old Believers who preserve the conservative ideals of the Zealots of Piety are known as the Popovtsy, meaning &quot;priested ones&quot;, as they accept clergymen ordained by the Nikonite Russian Orthodox Church but reject the church&#x27;s authority; those who preserve the apocalyptic pessimism of Kapiton and other spiritual leaders are the Bezpopovtsy, the &quot;priestless ones&quot;, as they reject both the established church&#x27;s priesthood and authority. Many Bezpopovtsy sects reject any sacraments which are traditionally performed by priests, such as marriage, and therefore practice celibacy.
