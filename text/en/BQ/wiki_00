<text>The Province of New York was a British proprietary colony and later a royal colony on the northeast coast of North America from 1664 to 1783. It extended from Long Island on the Atlantic, up the Hudson River and Mohawk River valleys to the Great Lakes and North to the colonies of New France and claimed lands further west.

In 1664, Charles II of England and his brother James, Duke of York raised a fleet to take the Dutch colony of New Netherland, then under the Directorship of Peter Stuyvesant. Stuyvesant surrendered to the English fleet without recognition from the Dutch West India Company. The province was renamed for the Duke of York, as its proprietor. England&#x27;s rule was established &quot;de facto&quot; following military control in 1664, and became established &quot;de jure&quot; as sovereign rule in 1667 in the Treaty of Breda and the Treaty of Westminster (1674). It was not until 1674 that English common law was applied in the colony. 

In the late 18th century, colonists in New York rebelled along with the other Thirteen Colonies, and supported the American Revolutionary War that led to the founding of the United States. British claims in New York were ended by the 1783 Treaty of Paris, with New York establishing its independence from the crown. The final evacuation of New York City by the British Army was followed by the return of General George Washington&#x27;s Continental Army on November 25, 1783, in a grand parade and celebration.

==Geography==
This British crown colony was established upon the former Iroquois nation and then Dutch colony of New Netherland, with its core being York Shire, in what today is typically known as Downstate New York.

==History==

===New Amsterdam and Dutch Rule (1617-1664)===
In 1617, officials of the Dutch West India Company in New Netherland created a settlement at present-day Albany, and in 1624 founded New Amsterdam, on Manhattan Island. The Dutch colony included claims to an area comprising all of the present U.S. states of New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and Vermont, along with inland portions of Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Maine in addition to eastern Pennsylvania. 

===Proprietary government (1664–1685) ===

New Amsterdam surrendered to Colonel Richard Nicholls on August 27, 1664; he renamed it New York. On September 24 Sir George Carteret accepted the capitulation of the garrison at Fort Orange, which he called Albany, after another of the Duke of York&#x27;s titles. The capture was confirmed by the Treaty of Breda in July 1667.

Easing the transition to British rule, the Articles of Capitulation guaranteed certain rights to the Dutch; among these were: liberty of conscience in divine worship and church discipline, the continuation of their own customs concerning inheritances, and the application of Dutch law to bargains and contracts made prior to the capitulation.

In 1664, James, Duke of York, was granted a proprietary colony which included New Netherland and present-day Maine. The New Netherland claim included western parts of present-day Massachusetts (to an extent that varied depending on whether the reference was the States General claim of all lands as far east as Narragansett Bay or the Treaty of Hartford negotiated by the English and Dutch colonies in 1650 but not recognized by either the Dutch or English governments) putting the new province in conflict with the Massachusetts charter. In general terms, the charter was equivalent to a conveyance of land conferring on him the right of possession, control, and government, subject only to the limitation that the government must be consistent with the laws of England. The Duke of York never visited his colony and exercised little direct control of it. He elected to administer his government through governors, councils, and other officers appointed by himself. No provision was made for an elected assembly.

Also in 1664, the Duke of York gave the part of his new possessions between the Hudson River and the Delaware River to Sir George Carteret in exchange for settlement of a debt. The territory was named after the Island of Jersey, Carteret&#x27;s ancestral home. The other section of New Jersey was sold to Lord Berkeley of Stratton, who was a close friend of the Duke. As a result, Carteret and Berkeley became the two English Lords Proprietors of New Jersey. 
The Province of New Jersey was created, but the border was not finalized until 1765 (see New York-New Jersey Line War). In 1667, territories between the Byram River and Connecticut River were split off to become the western half of Connecticut.

The acquired territory land designations were reassigned by the crown, leaving the territory of the modern State of New York, including the valleys of the Hudson and Mohawk Rivers, and future Vermont. The territory of western New York was disputed with the indigenous Iroquois Confederacy, and also disputed between the English and the French from their northern colonial province of New France (modern eastern Canada). The province remained an important military and economic link to Canada throughout its history. Vermont was disputed with the Province of New Hampshire to the east.

The first governor Richard Nicolls was known for writing &quot;The Duke&#x27;s Laws&quot; which served as the first compilation of English laws in colonial New York. Nicholls returned to England after an administration of three years, much of which was taken up in confirming the ancient Dutch land grants. Francis Lovelace was next appointed Governor and held the position from May 1667 until the return of the Dutch in July 1673. A Dutch fleet recaptured New York and held it until it was traded to the English by the Treaty of Westminster. A second grant was obtained by the Duke of York in July 1674 to perfect his title.

Upon conclusion of the peace in 1674, the Duke of York appointed Sir Edmund Andros as Governor of his territories in America. Governor Edmund Andros in 1674 said &quot;permit all persons of what religion soever, quietly to inhabit within the precincts of your jurisdiction&quot; Nonetheless, he made the Quakers of West Jersey pay toll on the Delaware, but they applied to England and were redressed. He was followed by Colonel Thomas Dongan in 1682. Dongan was empowered, on the advice of William Penn, to summon &quot;...a general assembly of all the freeholders, by such persons they should choose to represent them to consult with you and said council what laws are fit and necessary to be made...&quot;

A colonial Assembly was created in October 1683. New York was the last of the English colonies to have an assembly. The assembly passed the Province of New York constitution on October 30, the first of its kind in the colonies. This constitution gave New Yorkers more rights than any other group of colonists including the protection from taxation without representation. On November 1, 1683, the government was reorganized, and the state was divided into twelve counties, each of which was subdivided into towns. Ten of those counties still exist (see above), but two (Cornwall and Dukes) were in territory purchased by the Duke of York from the Earl of Stirling, and are no longer within the territory of the State of New York, having been transferred by treaty to Massachusetts. While the number of counties has been increased to 62, the pattern still remains that a town in New York State is a subdivision of a county, similar to New England.

An act of the assembly in 1683 naturalized all those of foreign nations then in the colony professing Christianity. To encourage immigration, it also provided that foreigners professing Christianity may, after their arrival, be naturalized if they took the oath of allegiance as required.

The Duke&#x27;s Laws established a non-denominational state church.

The British replaced the Dutch in their alliance with the Iroquois against New France, with an agreement called the Covenant Chain.

The colony was one of the Middle Colonies, and ruled at first directly from England. When the Duke of York ascended to the throne of England as James II in 1685, the province became a royal colony.

===Royal province (1686–1775)===
In 1664, after the Dutch ceded New Netherland to Britain, it became a proprietary colony under James, Duke of York. When James ascended the throne in February 1685 and became King James II, his personally owned colony became a royal province.

In May 1688, the Province of New York was made part of the Dominion of New England. However, in April 1689, when news arrived that King James had been overthrown in the Glorious Revolution, Bostonians overthrew their government and imprisoned Dominion Governor Edmund Andros. The province of New York rebelled in May in what is known as Leisler&#x27;s Rebellion. King William&#x27;s War with France began during which the French attacked Schenectady. In July, New York participated in an abortive attack on Montreal and Quebec. A new governor Henry Sloughter arrived in March 1691. He had Jacob Leisler arrested, tried, and executed.

New York&#x27;s charter was re-enacted in 1691 and was the constitution of the province until the creation of the State of New York.

The first newspaper to appear in New York was the &quot;New-York Gazette&quot;, started November 8, 1725, by William Bradford. It was printed on a single sheet, published weekly.

During Queen Anne&#x27;s War with France from 1702 to 1713, the province had little involvement with the military operations, but benefited from being a supplier to the British fleet. New York militia participated in two abortive attacks on Quebec in 1709 and 1711.

====Dutch====

When the British took over, the great majority of Dutch families remained, with the exception of government officials and soldiers. However, new Dutch arrivals became very few. While the Netherlands was a small country, the Dutch Empire was large, meaning that emigrants leaving the mother country had a wide variety of choices under full Dutch control. The major Dutch cities were centers of high culture, but they sent few immigrants. Most Dutch arrivals to the New World in the 17th century had been farmers from villages who on arrival in New Netherland scattered into widely separated villages that had little cross contact with each other. Even inside a settlement, different Dutch groups had minimal interaction. 

With very few new arrivals, the result was an increasingly traditional system cut off from the forces for change. The folk maintained their popular culture, revolving around their language and their Calvinist religion. The Dutch brought along their own folklore, most famously &quot;Sinterklaas&quot;, which evolved into the modern day Santa Claus. They maintained their distinctive clothing and food preferences. They introduced some new foods to America, including beets, endive, spinach, parsley, and cookies. After the British takeover, rich Dutch families in Albany and New York City emulated the English elite, purchasing English furniture, silverware, crystal, and jewelry. They were proud of the Dutch language, which was strongly reinforced through the church, but were much slower than the Yankees in setting up schools for their children. They finally set up Queens College, which is now Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey. They published no newspapers, and published no books and only a handful of religious tracts annually.

====Germans====
Nearly 2,800 Palatine German emigrants were transported to New York by Queen Anne&#x27;s government in ten ships in 1710, the largest single group of immigrants before the Revolutionary War. By comparison, Manhattan then had only 6,000 people. Initially, the Germans were employed in the production of naval stores and tar along the Hudson River near Peekskill. In 1723 they were allowed to settle in the central Mohawk Valley west of Schenectady as a buffer against the Native Americans and the French. They also settled in areas such as Schoharie and Cherry Valley. Many became tenant farmers or squatters. They kept to themselves, married their own, spoke German, attended Lutheran churches, and retained their own customs and foods. They emphasized farm ownership. Some mastered English to become conversant with local legal and business opportunities.

====Black slaves====
The first slaves were introduced to the colonies by the Dutch, and thereafter by the British, largely bought from African tribal chiefs who exploited prisoners taken during the numerous tribal wars of that period. In the 1690s, New York was the largest importer of the colonies of slaves and a supply port for pirates. 

The black population became a major element in New York City, and on large upstate farms. With its shipping and trades, New York had use for skilled African labor as artisans and domestic servants. New York sold these slaves using slave markets, giving slaves to the highest bidder at an auction.

Two notable slave revolts occurred in New York in 1712 and 1741.

The numbers of slaves imported to New York increased dramatically from the 1720s through 1740s. By the 17th century, they established the African burial ground in Lower Manhattan, which was used through 1812. It was discovered nearly two centuries later during excavation before the construction of the Ted Weiss Federal Building at 290 Broadway. Historians estimated 15,000–20,000 Africans and African Americans had been buried in the approximately 8 acres surrounding there. Because of the extraordinary find, the government commissioned a memorial at the site, where the National Park Service has an interpretive center. It has been designated a National Historic Landmark and National Monument. Excavation and study of the remains has been described as the &quot;most important historic urban archaeological project undertaken in the United States.&quot;

====King George&#x27;s War====

This province, as a British colony, fought against the French during King George&#x27;s War. The assembly was determined to control expenditures for this war and only weak support was given. When the call came for New York to help raise an expeditionary force against Louisburg, the New York assembly refused to raise troops and only appropriated a token £3,000. The assembly was opposed to a significant war effort because it would interrupt trade with Quebec and would result in higher taxes. The French raid on Saratoga in 1745 destroyed that settlement, killing and capturing more than one hundred people. After this attack the assembly was more generous and raised 1,600 men and £40,000.

====French and Indian War====
Upstate New York was the scene of fighting during the French and Indian War, with British and French forces contesting control of Lake Champlain in association with Native American allies. Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet, and other agents in upstate New York brought about the participation of the Iroquois. The French and their Indian allies laid siege to Fort William Henry at the southern end of Lake George in 1757. The British forces surrendered to the French, but many prisoners were then massacred by the Indians. Some prisoners had smallpox, and when Indians took the scalps to their home villages, they spread a disease that killed large numbers. In the end the British won the war and took over all of Canada, thereby ending French-sponsored Indian attacks.

One of the largest impressment operations occurred in New York in the spring of 1757 when three thousand British troops cordoned off the city and impressed nearly eight hundred persons they found in taverns and other gathering places of sailors. New York was the centre for privateering. Forty New York ships were commissioned as privateers in 1756 and in the spring of 1757 it was estimated the value of French prizes brought into New York was two hundred thousand pounds. By 1759, the seas had been cleaned of French vessels and the privateers were diverted into trading with the enemy. The ending of the war caused a severe recession in New York.

Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet, negotiated an end to Pontiac&#x27;s Rebellion. He promoted the Proclamation of 1763 and the Treaty of Fort Stanwix to protect the Indians from further English settlement in their lands. The treaty established a boundary line along the West Branch Delaware River and the Unadilla River, with Iroquois lands to the west and colonial lands to the east.

===Political parties===
During the middle years of the 18th century, politics in New York revolved around the rivalry of two great families, the Livingstons and the De Lanceys. Both of these families had amassed considerable fortunes. New York City had an inordinate influence on New York province politics because several of the assembly members lived in New York City rather than in their district. In the 1752 election, De Lanceys&#x27; relatives and close friends controlled 12 of the 27 seats in the assembly. The De Lanceys lost control of the assembly in the election of 1761. 

Governor Cadwallader Colden tried to organize a popular party to oppose the great families, thus earning the hatred of the city elite of both parties. The Livingstons looked to the imperial ties as a means of controlling the influence of James De Lancey. The De Lanceys regarded imperial ties to be a tool for personal advantage.

===Stamp Act===
Parliament passed the Stamp Act 1765 to raise money from the colonies. New York had previously passed its own stamp act from 1756 to 1760 to raise money for the French and Indian war. The extraordinary response to the Stamp Act can only be explained by the build-up of antagonisms on local issues. New York was experiencing a severe recession from the effects of the end of the French and Indian war. The colonies were experiencing the effects of a very tight monetary policy caused by the trade deficit with Britain, a fiscal crisis in Britain restricting credit, and the Currency Act, which prevented the issuing of paper currency to provide liquidity.

From the outset, New York led the protests in the colonies. Both New York political factions opposed the Stamp Act of 1765. In October, at what became Federal Hall in New York, representatives of several colonies met in the Stamp Act Congress to discuss their response. The New York assembly petitioned the British House of Commons on December 11, 1765, for the Americans&#x27; right of self taxation. In August, the intimidation and beating of stamp agents was widely reported. The New York stamp commissioner resigned his job.

The act went into effect on November 1. The day before, James De Lancey organized a meeting at Burns Tavern of New York merchants, where they agreed to boycott all British imports until the Stamp Act was repealed. A leading moderate group opposing the Stamp Act were the local Sons of Liberty headed by Isaac Sears, John Lamb and Alexander McDougall. Historian Gary B. Nash wrote of what was called the &quot;General Terror of November 1–4&quot;:

Historian Fred Anderson contrasted the mob actions in New York with those in Boston. In Boston, after the initial unrest, local leaders such as the Loyal Nine (a precursor to the Sons of Liberty) were able to take control of the mob. In New York, however, the &quot;mob was largely made up of seamen, most of whom lacked deep community ties and felt little need to submit to the authority of the city&#x27;s shorebound radical leaders.&quot; The New York Sons of Liberty did not take control of the opposition until after November 1.

On November 1, the crowd destroyed a warehouse and the house of Thomas James, commander at Fort George. A few days later the stamps stored at Fort George were surrendered to the mob. Nash notes that, &quot;whether the Sons of Liberty could control the mariners, lower artisans, and laborers remained in doubt,&quot; and &quot;they came to fear the awful power of the assembled lower-class artisans and their maritime compatriots.&quot;

On January 7, 1766, the merchant ship &quot;Polly&quot; carrying stamps for Connecticut was boarded in New York Harbor and the stamps destroyed. Up to the end of 1765 the Stamp Act disturbances had largely been confined to New York City, but in January the Sons of Liberty also stopped the distribution of stamps in Albany.

In May 1766, when news arrived of the repeal of the Stamp Act the Sons of Liberty celebrated by the erection of a Liberty Pole. It became a rallying point for mass meetings and an emblem of the American cause. In June, two regiments of British regulars arrived in New York and were quartered in the upper barracks. These troops cut down the liberty pole on August 10. A second and third pole were erected and also cut down. A fourth pole was erected and encased in iron to prevent similar action.

In 1766, widespread tenant uprisings occurred in the countryside north of New York City centered on the Livingston estates. They marched on New York expecting the Sons of Liberty to support them. Instead, the Sons of Liberty blocked the roads and the leader of the tenants was convicted of treason.

===Quartering Act===
In the last years of the French and Indian War London approved a policy of keeping twenty regiments in the colonies to police and defend the back country. The enabling legislation took the form of the Quartering Act which required colonial legislatures to provide quarters and supplies for the troops. The Quartering Act stirred little controversy and New Yorkers were ambivalent about the presence of the troops. The assembly had provided barracks and provisions every year since 1761. 

However, the tenant riots of 1766 showed the need for a police force in the colony. The Livingston-controlled New York assembly passed a quartering bill in 1766 to provide barracks and provisions in New York City and Albany which satisfied most, but not all of the requirements of the Quartering Act. London suspended the assembly for failure to comply fully, and Governor Moore dissolved the House of Assembly, February 6, 1768. The next month New Yorkers went to the polls for a new assembly. In this election, with the Sons of Liberty support, the De Lancey faction gained seats, but not enough for a majority.

===Townshend Acts===
In 1768, a letter issued by the Massachusetts assembly called for the universal boycott of British imports in opposition to the Townshend Acts. In October, the merchants of New York agreed on the condition that the merchants of Boston and Philadelphia also agreed. In December, the assembly passed a resolution which stated the colonies were entitled to self-taxation. Governor Moore declared the resolution repugnant to the laws of England and dissolved the assembly. The De Lancey faction, again with Sons of Liberty support, won a majority in the assembly.

In the spring of 1769, New York was in a depression from the recall of paper boycott and the British boycott. By the Currency Act New York was required to recall all paper money. London allowed the issuance of additional paper money, but the attached conditions were unsatisfactory. While New York was boycotting British imports, other colonies including Boston and Philadelphia were not. The De Lanceys tried to reach a compromise by passing a bill which allowed for the issuing of paper currency, of which half was for provisioning of the troops. Alexander McDougall, signed a &#x27;Son of Liberty&#x27;, issued a broadside entitled &quot;To the Betrayed Inhabitants of the City and Colony of New York&quot; which was an excellent piece of political propaganda denouncing the De Lanceys for betraying the liberties of the people by acknowledging the British power of taxation. The Sons of Liberty switched their allegiance from the De Lanceys to the Livingstons. Alexander McDougall was arrested for libel.

Conflict between the Sons of Liberty and the troops in New York erupted with the Battle of Golden Hill on January 19, 1770, where troops cut down the fourth Liberty Pole which had been erected in 1767.

In July 1770, the merchants of New York decided to resume trade with Britain when news arrived of Parliament&#x27;s plan to repeal the Townshend Duties and to give permission for New York to issue some paper currency. The Sons of Liberty were strongly opposed to the resumption of trade. The merchants twice polled their members and went door to door polling residents of New York and all polls were overwhelming in support of resumption of trade. This was perhaps the first public opinion poll in American history.

===Tea Act===

New York was peaceful after the repeal of the Townshend Act, but the economy of New York was still in a slump. In May 1773 the Parliament passed the Tea Act cutting the duty on tea and enabling the East India company to sell tea in the colonies cheaper than the smugglers could. This act primarily hurt the New York merchants and smugglers. The Sons of Liberty were the organizers of the opposition and in November 1773 they published &quot;Association of the Sons of Liberty of New York&quot; in which anyone who assisted in support of the act would be an &quot;enemy to the liberties of America&quot;. As a result, the New York East India agents resigned. The New York assembly took no action in regard to the Sons of Liberty assumption of extra-legal powers.

The New York City Sons of Liberty learned of Boston&#x27;s plan to stop the unloading of any tea and resolved to also follow this policy. Since the &quot;Association&quot; had not obtained the support they had expected, the Sons of Liberty were afraid that if the tea was landed the population would demand its distribution for retail.

In December, news arrived of the Boston Tea Party strengthened opposition. In April 1774, The boat &quot;Nancy&quot; arrived in New York harbor for repairs. The captain admitted that he had 18 chests of tea on board and he agreed that he would not attempt to have the tea landed, but the Sons of Liberty boarded the ship regardless and destroyed the tea.

===Intolerable Acts===
In January 1774, the Assembly created a Committee of Correspondence to correspond with other colonies in regard to the Intolerable Acts.

In May 1774 news arrived of the Boston Port Act which closed the port of Boston. The Sons of Liberty were in favor of resumption of a trade boycott with Britain, but there was strong resistance from the large importers. In May, a meeting in New York was called in which members were selected for a Committee of Correspondence. The Committee of Fifty was formed which was dominated with moderates, the Sons of Liberty only obtained 15 members. Isaac Low was the chairman. Francis Lewis was added to create the Committee of Fifty-One. The group adopted a resolution which said Boston was &quot;suffering in the defence of the rights of America&quot; and proposed the formation of a Continental Congress. In July, the committee select five of their members as delegates to this congress. Some of the other counties also sent delegates to the First Continental Congress which was held in September. The New York delegates were unable to stop the adoption at the congress of the Continental Association. The association was generally ignored in New York.

In January and February 1775, of the New York Assembly voted down successive resolutions approving the proceedings of the First Continental Congress and refused to send delegates to the Second Continental Congress. New York was the only colonial assembly which did not approve the proceeds of the First Continental Congress. Opposition to the Congress revolved around the opinion that the provincial houses of assembly were the proper agencies to solicit redress for grievances. In March, the Assembly broke with the rest of the colonies and wrote a petition to London, but London rejected the petition because it contained claims about a lack of authority of the &quot;parent state&quot; to tax colonists, &quot;which made it impossible&quot; to accept. The Assembly last met on April 3, 1775.

===Provincial Congress===

The revolutionary New York Provincial Congress of local representatives assumed the government on May 22, 1775, declared the province the State of New York in 1776, and ratified the first New York Constitution in 1777. During the ensuing American Revolutionary War the British regained and occupied the strategic port and harbor of New York Town in September 1776, using it as its military and political base of operations in British North America;
though a British governor was technically in office, much of the remainder of the upper part of the colony was held by the rebel Patriots. 

In April 1775, the rebels formed the New York Provincial Congress as a replacement for the New York Assembly. News of the battle of Lexington and Concord reached New York on April 23, which stunned the city since there was a widely believed rumor that Parliament was to grant the colonies self-taxation. The Sons of Liberty led by Marinus Willett broke into the Arsenal at City Hall and removed 1,000 stand of arms. The armed citizens formed a voluntary corps to govern the city with Isaac Sears&#x27;s house the de facto seat of government and militia headquarters. The crown-appointed New York executive council met on April 24 and concluded that &quot;we were unanimously of the opinion that we had no power to do anything.&quot; The British troops in New York never left their barracks.

On October 19, 1775, Governor William Tryon was forced to leave New York for a British warship offshore, ending any appearances of British rule of the colony as the Continental Congress ordered the arrest of anyone endangering the safety of the colony. In April 1776 Tryon officially dissolved the New York assembly.

New York was located in the Northern theatre of the American Revolutionary War. New York served as the launching point for the failed Invasion of Canada in 1775, the first major military operation of the newly formed Continental Army. General George Washington took the Continental Army from Boston after the British withdrew following the Fortification of Dorchester Heights, and brought it to New York in 1776, correctly anticipating the British would return there. The Battle of Saratoga in 1777 was a turning point in the war. West Point on the Hudson was a strategic asset. And New York played a central role for the British in their attempt to divide New England from the rest of the colonies.

The Fourth Provincial Congress convened in White Plains on July 9, 1776, and became known as the &quot;New York First Constitutional Convention&quot;. New York endorsed the Declaration of Independence the same day, and declared the independent state of New York. New York celebrated by tearing down the statue of George III in Bowling Green. On July 10, 1776, the Fourth Provincial Congress changed its name to the &quot;Convention of Representatives of the State of New York&quot;, and &quot;acts as legislature without an executive.&quot; While adjourned it left a Committee of Safety in charge. The New York state constitution was framed by a convention which assembled at White Plains on July 10, 1776, and after repeated adjournments and changes of venue, it concluded in Kingston, New York on Sunday evening, April 20, 1777, when the new constitution was adopted with one dissenting vote. It had been drafted by John Jay and was not submitted to the people for ratification. Under its provisions, the governor would be elected not appointed, voting restrictions were reduced, secret ballots were introduced, and civil rights were guaranteed. On July 30, 1777, George Clinton was inaugurated as the first Governor of New York at Kingston. On July 9, 1778, the State of New York signed the Articles of Confederation and officially became a part of the government of the United States of America, though it had been a part of the nation since it was declared in 1776 with signatories from New York.

The province was the scene of the largest battle of the entire war, and the first after the Declaration of Independence was signed. The British recaptured the city in September 1776 in the New York and New Jersey campaign, cut down the Liberty Pole in the common, and placed the province under martial law under the command of James Robertson, though his effective authority did not extend far beyond the southern tip of Manhattan (then the extent of New York City). Tryon retained his title of governor, but with little power. David Mathews was Mayor for the duration of British occupation of New York until Evacuation Day in 1783. After its reoccupation, New York became the headquarters for the British army in America, and the British political center of operations in North America. Loyalist refugees flooded into the city raising its population to 33,000. Prison ships in Wallabout Bay held a large proportion of American soldiers and sailors being held prisoner by the British, and was where more Americans died than in all of the battles of the war, combined. The British retained control of New York until Evacuation Day in November 1783, which was commemorated long afterward.

==Structure of government==

The governor of New York was royally appointed. The governor selected his Executive Council which served as the upper house. The governor and king had veto power over the assembly&#x27;s bills. However, all bills were effective until royal disapproval had occurred which could take up to a year. During King George&#x27;s War, the governor approved two assembly initiatives; that the colony&#x27;s revenue be approved annually rather than every five years and that the assembly must approve the purpose of each allocation. Elections to the house of assembly were initially held whenever the governor pleased, but eventually a law was passed requiring an election at least once every seven years. The city of New York was the seat of government and where the New York provincial assembly met.

Between 1692 and 1694 the governor of New York was also the governor of Pennsylvania. From 1698 to 1701 the governor was also the governor of Massachusetts and New Hampshire. From 1702 to 1738 he was also the governor of New Jersey.

Representation in the assembly in 1683 was six for Long Island, four for New York City, two for Kingston, two for Albany, one for each of Staten Island, Schenectady, Martha&#x27;s Vineyard and Nantucket and one for Pemequid on the Maine coast. In 1737, the assembly was expanded to 27 and in 1773 to 31.

Voters were required to have a £40 freehold, in addition to requirements related to age, sex, and religion. The £40 freehold requirement was often ignored. Jews were not allowed to vote between 1737 and 1747. In rural counties slightly more than half the males could vote. No secret ballot safeguarded the independence of the voters. The elections were held at the county town, under the supervision of the sheriff and sometimes at such short notice that many of the voting population could not get to the polls. The candidates were usually at the polls and the vote was taken by a show of hands unless this vote did not result in a clear winner.

David Osborn notes, 
The election for an open seat in the New York assembly, held on the Village Green in Eastchester, Westchester County on October 29, 1733, is one of the better known political events in colonial America. Two hundred and seventy-five years after the contest, historians continue to cite the election to advance various arguments about colonial life. One recent student used the election to argue for the persistent importance of monarchy in the outlook of colonists, while another scholar treated the voting as an important point in the development of political awareness among New York artisans. Many writers address the election, held at what is today St. Paul&#x27;s Church National Historic Site, in Mt. Vernon, as part of the story of the printer John Peter Zenger, whose acquittal in a seditious libel case in 1735 is seen as a foundation of the free press in America. The first issue of Zenger&#x27;s &quot;New York Weekly Journal&quot; carried a lengthy report on the famous election, producing one of the few complete accounts of a colonial election available to historians.&quot;

===Counties===

The Province of New York was divided into twelve counties on November 1, 1683, by the Royal Governor Thomas Dongan:
* Albany County: all of the region that is now northern and western New York. Also claimed the area, later disputed, that is now Vermont. In addition, as there was no fixed western border to the colony (a sea-to-sea grant), Albany County technically extended to the Pacific Ocean. Most of this land, which was Indian land for most of the province&#x27;s history, has now been ceded to other states and most of the land within New York has been divided into new counties. 
* Cornwall County: that part of Maine between the Kennebec River and the St. Croix River from the Atlantic Ocean to the St. Lawrence River. Ceded to the Province of Massachusetts Bay in 1692.
* Dukes County: the Elizabeth Islands, Martha&#x27;s Vineyard and Nantucket Island east of Long Island. Ceded to Massachusetts in 1692.
* Dutchess County: now Dutchess and Putnam counties.
* Kings County: the current Kings County; Brooklyn.
* New York County: the current New York County; Manhattan.
* Orange County: now Orange and Rockland counties.
* Queens County: now Queens and Nassau counties.
* Richmond County: the current Richmond County; Staten Island.
* Suffolk County: the current Suffolk County.
* Ulster County: now Ulster and Sullivan counties and part of what is now Delaware and Greene counties.
* Westchester County: now Westchester and Bronx counties.

On March 24, 1772:
* Tryon County was formed out of Albany County. It was renamed Montgomery County in 1784, with a later division to Herkimer County around Little Falls.
* Charlotte County was formed out of Albany County. It was renamed Washington County in 1784.

==Legal profession==
The British governors were upper class aristocrats not trained in the law, and felt unduly constrained by the legalistic demands of the Americans. In the period from the 1680s to about 1715 numerous efforts were made to strengthen royal control and diminish legal constraints on the power of the governors. Colonial lawyers fought back successfully. An important technique that developed especially in Boston, Philadelphia and New York in the 1720s and 1730s was to mobilize public opinion by using the new availability of weekly newspapers and print shops that produced inexpensive pamphlets. The lawyers used the publicity medium to disseminate ideas about American legal rights as Englishmen. By the 1750s and 1760s, however, there was a counterattack ridiculing and demeaning the lawyers as pettifoggers. Their image and influence declined.

The lawyers of colonial New York organized a bar association, but it fell apart in 1768 during the bitter political dispute between the factions based in the Delancey and Livingston families. For the next century, various attempts were made, and failed, in New York state to build an effective organization of lawyers. The American Revolution saw the departure of many leading lawyers who were Loyalists; their clientele was often tied to royal authority or British merchants and financiers. They were not allowed to practice law unless they took a loyalty oath to the new United States of America. Many went to Britain or Canada after losing the war. Finally a Bar Association emerged in 1869 that proved successful and continues to operate.

===Judiciary===
Initially the Province of New York started with the system of courts it had had in its earlier period of English rule: the Court of Assizes, the Court of Sessions, and a series of town courts such as the Mayor&#x27;s Court of the City of New York.

In 1683 the Court of Assizes was abolished, with its jurisdiction being transferred to a new Court of Oyer and Terminer and Court of Chancery.

The Supreme Court of Judicature of the Province of New York was established by the New York Assembly on 6 May 1691, replacing the Court of Oyer and Terminer. Jurisdiction was based on the English Courts of King&#x27;s Bench, Common Pleas and Exchequer but excluded cases of equity which continued to be dealt with by the Court of Chancery. The Supreme Court continued in being under the Constitution of 1777, becoming the New York Supreme Court under the 1846 Constitution.

==Demographics==

Upstate New York (as well as parts of present Ontario, Quebec, Pennsylvania and Ohio) were occupied by the Five Nations (after 1720 becoming Six Nations, when joined by Tuscarora) of the Iroquois Confederacy for at least a half millennium before the Europeans came.

* In 1664, one-quarter of the population of New York was African American.
* In 1690, the population of the province was 20,000, of which 6,000 were in New York.
* In 1698, the population of the province was 18,607. 14% of the population of New York was black.
* The slave population grew after Queen Anne&#x27;s war. The percentage of blacks in New York in 1731 and 1746 was 18% and 21% respectively.
* In 1756, the population of the province was about 100,000 of which about 14,000 were blacks. Most of the blacks in New York at this time were slaves.

==Economy==

The fur trade established under Dutch rule continued to grow. As the merchant port of New York became more important, the economy expanded and diversified and the agricultural areas of Long Island and the regions further up the Hudson River developed. Fishermen also made a decent living because New York was next to the ocean, making it a port/fishing state. Inland, farming crops made farmers a lot of money in the colony. Tradesmen made a fortune selling their wares.

<text>Ibrahim Ahmed Mahmoud al Qosi () (born July 1960) is a Sudanese militant and paymaster for al-Qaeda. Qosi was held from January 2002 in extrajudicial detention in the United States Guantanamo Bay detainment camps, in Cuba. His Guantanamo Internment Serial Number is 54.

Ibrahim Ahmed Mahmoud al Qosi was held at Guantanamo for approximately ten years and six months; he was charged with low-level support of al-Qaeda. After pleading guilty in a plea bargain in 2010, in the first trial under the military commissions, and serving a short sentence, Qosi was transferred to Sudan by the Obama administration in July 2012. He was to be held in custody and participate in Sudan&#x27;s re-integration program for former detainees before being allowed to return to his hometown.

Some years after his release, Al Qosi moved to Yemen and joined Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), appearing in video releases by the group and reportedly taking a leadership role in it.

In November 2019, the Rewards for Justice Program offered $4 million for information leading to the identification or location of Al Qosi.

==Background==
Ibrahim Al Qosi was born in 1960 in Atbara, Sudan. He has a brother named Abdullah. He is married to one of Abdullah Tabarak&#x27;s daughters and has two daughters.

In 1990, Qosi was recruited by Sudanese jihadists and later traveled to Afghanistan via the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan, where he trained at a training camp outside of Khost. Two years later, he returned to Khartoum and worked in currency trading. In 1995, he went to Chechnya via Syria, Azerbaijan and Dagestan, where he fought in the First Chechen War as a mortar operator. A year later, he went back to Afghanistan where he aided in the fight against the Northern Alliance from 1998 to 2001. However, he was captured by the Pakistani authorities while trying to cross the Afghan-Pakistani borders on 15 December 2001 near Parachinar, Pakistan. Then he was detained in a prison in Peshawar until 27 December, before being held in US custody at a Kandahar detention facility. Later on, he was transferred to Guantanamo on 13 January 2002.

Qosi was the first captive to face charges before a Guantanamo military commission. He was not accused of being a member of al Qaeda&#x27;s leadership, only of simple support tasks, like cooking. After pleading guilty in a plea bargain, he was sentenced in July 2010. He was transferred to Sudan in July 2012 after completing a shortened sentence, and was to participate in Sudan&#x27;s re-integration program for former detainees.

==Official status reviews==

Originally the Bush presidency asserted that captives apprehended in the &quot;war on terror&quot; were not covered by the Geneva Conventions, and could be held indefinitely, without charge, and without an open and transparent review of the justifications for their detention.
In 2004, the United States Supreme Court ruled, in Rasul v. Bush, that Guantanamo captives were entitled to being informed of the allegations justifying their detention, and were entitled to try to refute them.

===Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants===

Following the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling the Department of Defense set up the Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants.
A summary of evidence memo listing allegations justifying his detention was prepared for his Combatant Status Review Tribunal on September 4, 2004.

Scholars at the Brookings Institution, led by Benjamin Wittes, listed the captives still
held in Guantanamo in December 2008, according to whether their detention was justified by certain
common allegations:

* Ibrahim Ahmed Mahmoud al Qosi was listed as one of the captives who had faced charges before a military commission.
* Ibrahim Ahmed Mahmoud al Qosi was listed as one of the captives who &quot;The military alleges ... are members of Al Qaeda.&quot;
* Ibrahim Ahmed Mahmoud al Qosi was listed as one of the captives who &quot;The military alleges ... traveled to Afghanistan for jihad.&quot;
* Ibrahim Ahmed Mahmoud al Qosi was listed as one of the captives who &quot;The military alleges ... took military or terrorist training in Afghanistan.&quot;
* Ibrahim Ahmed Mahmoud al Qosi was listed as one of the captives who &quot;The military alleges ... fought for the Taliban.&quot;
* Ibrahim Ahmed Mahmoud al Qosi was listed as one of the captives who &quot;The military alleges ... were at Tora Bora.&quot;
* Ibrahim Ahmed Mahmoud al Qosi was listed as one of the captives who was an &quot;al Qaeda operative&quot;.
* Ibrahim Ahmed Mahmoud al Qosi was listed as one of the captives &quot;who have been charged before military commissions and are alleged Al Qaeda operatives.&quot;
* Ibrahim Ahmed Mahmoud al Qosi was listed as one of the &quot;82 detainees [who] made no statement to CSRT or ARB tribunals or made statements that do not bear materially on the military&#x27;s allegations against them.&quot;

===Habeas petition===
A petition of habeas corpus was filed on Al Qosi&#x27;s behalf. Following the United States Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling in &quot;Rasul v. Bush&quot; (2004) that detainees had the right under &quot;habeas corpus&quot; to an impartial tribunal to challenge their detention, more than 200 captives had habeas corpus petitions filed on their behalf. Congress passed the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA) and the Military Commissions Act of 2006 (MCA) at the request of the Bush administration, which suspend their access to the US civilian justice system and shift all responsibility to military tribunals.

In September 2007, the Department of Defense published the unclassified dossiers arising from the Combatant Status Review Tribunals of 179 captives. The Department of Defense withheld the unclassified documents from Al Qosi&#x27;s tribunal without explanation.

On June 12, 2008, in its landmark ruling in the &quot;Boumediene v. Bush&quot; &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petition, the United States Supreme Court determined that the MCA was unconstitutional for attempting to deprive the captives&#x27; of their constitutional right to &quot;habeas corpus.&quot; It ruled that detainees could access the US federal courts directly.

===Formerly secret Joint Task Force Guantanamo assessment===

On April 25, 2011, whistleblower organization WikiLeaks published formerly secret assessments drafted by Joint Task Force Guantanamo analysts.
Al-Qosi&#x27;s assessment was eleven pages long, and was drafted on November 15, 2007.
It was signed by camp commandant Mark H. Buzby. The report noted that al-Qosi had been &quot;compliant and non-hostile to the guard force and staff.&quot;

==Charged before military commissions==

On February 24, 2004, al Qosi was named in documents for the first military commissions to be held for detainees. The United States alleged that he joined al-Qaeda in 1989 and worked as a driver and bodyguard for Osama bin Laden, as well as working as a quartermaster for al-Qaeda. He was also alleged to have been the treasurer of a business which was an al-Qaida front.

He was indicted along with Ali Hamza Ahmed Sulayman al Bahlul. The indictment allowed the detainees to consult with military defense lawyers assigned by the government to prepare their defenses. Al Qosi was charged with conspiracy to commit war crimes, including attacking civilians, murder, destruction of property, and terrorism.

Lieutenant Colonel Sharon Shaffer USAF (Judge Advocates Group) was appointed al Qosi&#x27;s defense lawyer on February 6, 2004.

On August 27, 2004, Shaffer complained that the prosecution was not providing her with the information she needed for her defense of al Qosi. She said that al Qosi had informed her that the quality of translation at his military commission was insufficient for him to understand what was happening. She told the tribunal that she had to resign as al Qosi&#x27;s attorney.

According to the Voice of America, Chief Prosecutor Colonel Robert L. Swann assured the commission that: &quot;...all resources will be devoted to obtaining the most accurate translations possible.&quot;

On November 9, 2004, legal action against Qosi was suspended, The US District Court Justice James Robertson had ruled, in &quot;Hamdan v. Rumsfeld&quot;, that the military commissions violated international agreements to which the United States was a signatory, including part of the Geneva Conventions. This ruling applied to all four of the detainees who had been charged by the military commission.

In 2005, a three-judge appeals panel overturned Robertson&#x27;s ruling, setting the commissions back in motion. In &quot;Hamdan v. Rumsfeld&quot; (2006), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the president lacked the constitutional authority to establish military the military commissions, and that only Congress could do so. Congress subsequently passed the Military Commissions Act of 2006, which included provisions to suspend the access of detainees to &quot;habeas corpus&quot; in the US courts.

On February 9, 2008, al Qosi and Ali Hamza Suleiman Al Bahlul were charged before the congressionally authorized Guantanamo military commissions authorized by the Military Commissions Act of 2006.

===Phoning home===
 Ibrahim al Qosi was among those who was granted access to telephone privileges.
On May 22, 2008, Lieutenant Colonel Nancy Paul, the presiding officer of his commission ordered that Ibrahim al Qosi be permitted his first phone call home. While it was reported that the phone call was made, this was in error. Qosi had declined to leave his cell to meet with Commander Suzanne Lachelier, his assigned legal counsel, and the Camp&#x27;s security rules do not permit her going to his cell to talk to him—so they have never discussed his case. During a preliminary hearing, Ibrahim Al Qosi told Paul he does not want to be represented by an American lawyer. He said that he had been unable to hire the lawyer of his choice because he had been isolated in Guantanamo, and had been unable to contact his family since his detention.

Later that day, Commander Pauline Storum, a Guantanamo spokesman, reported that the call had been completed, and that he had spoken with his family for an hour.

On May 23, 2008, Storum sent an apology by e-mail to reporters to retract her claim the phone call had been completed.
I misspoke when I confirmed that al Qosi&#x27;s call was complete. In clarifying the current status of the detainee phone program, I misunderstood the information I was given, and inaccurately conveyed that al Qosi&#x27;s call was completed.

I apologize for the error.
Ibrahim al-Qosi&#x27;s appointed counsel, Suzanne Lachelier, told Carol Rosenberg, of the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;, that she was surprised to learn, through press reports, that the call had been completed. She said she had only begun to initiate the co-ordination with the Red Cross to arrange for his family to be set up to receive the call when she learned the call had already been completed. According to Rosenberg:

The original statement Thursday struck some observers as extraordinary -- for both its speed and the coordination between the separate bureaucracies of the prison camp and the war court.

The Department of Defense had until July 1, 2008, to arrange the phone call.

The US Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Boumediene v. Bush&quot; (2008) that the Military Commissions Act of 2006 was unconstitutional, as it suspended the right of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; of detainees. Military commissions were suspended.

===July 2009 hearing===
On July 15, 2009, al Qosi had his first hearing that year.
According to Carol Rosenberg, writing in the &quot;Lakeland Ledger&quot;, the electronic audio management equipment the court had been supplied with in 2008 initially failed to function properly. Rosenberg reported that al Qosi&#x27;s defense team was concerned that the prosecution was imposing improper delays, and noted they had told the presiding officer.

===Continuance===
The Barack Obama presidency was granted a continuance on October 21, 2009. Congress had amended the MCA, passing the Military Commissions Act of 2009, and the Department of Defense needed to create regulations to implement it. The military commissions for five other captives were granted continuances, until November 16, 2009. Ibrahim al Qosi did not attend this hearing.

===New charges rejected, status determination scheduled===
On December 3, 2009, Paul ruled that the charges against Al Qosi should be limited to crimes he was alleged to have committed in Afghanistan. She ruled that crimes he was alleged to have committed when al Qaeda was based in Sudan were beyond the mandate of the military commission system.

Carol Rosenberg, writing in the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;, reported that Paul scheduled hearings for January 6, 2010, to determine whether Al Qosi met the eligibility criteria as an &quot;illegal enemy combatant&quot; as laid out in the Military Commissions Act of 2006. Only if he was classified under that status would the military commission have jurisdiction to try him. Rosenberg described Paul as the first presiding officer of a military commission to address the changes that US Congress set in place when passing the Military Commissions Act of 2009.

Andrea Prasow, a senior counsel with Human Rights Watch, was critical of Paul for proceeding with the commission, although the government had not completed drafting the rules of procedure under the act.

===Guilty Plea===
On July 7, 2010, al Qosi entered a guilty plea under a plea bargain deal, the details of which have not been publicly released. His sentencing was set for August 9, 2010. On August 11, 2010, a military jury at Guantanamo recommended that al-Qosi serve 14 years in prison.

===Appeal dismissed===
Other individuals who, like al-Qosi, had pleaded guilty to &quot;providing material support for terrorism&quot;, had their convictions overturned on appeal. Appeals courts ruled that the charge was not a crime at the time the acts were committed. In 2014, Al-Qosi&#x27;s military-appointed lawyer, Mary McCormick, attempted to have al-Qosi&#x27;s conviction overturned, following the precedent of the over-turning the convictions of other men convicted of the same charge. The United States Court of Military Commission Review first declined to provide funds for McCormick to travel to Sudan to consult with al-Qosi, and then ruled that she could not prove she had an attorney–client relationship, on his behalf. Finally, the USCMCR ruled that since McCormick could not prove she had an attorney–client relationship she was not authorized to file motions on al-Qosi&#x27;s behalf. On May 1, 2015, three judges of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals confirmed that McCormick could not prove she had an attorney–client relationship.

Steve Vladeck, a professor of law who specializes in security matters, described the decision by the USCMCR to withhold funds from McCormick so she could renew contact with al-Qosi because she could not document that she remained in contact with him as &quot;somewhat circular&quot;&quot;.

==Repatriation==
When al Qosi was transferred to Sudan by the Obama administration on July 11, 2012, his lawyer Paul Reichler said al Qosi will enter a Sudan government &quot;re-integration program:&quot;

al Qosi was held in Sudan&#x27;s capital, Khartoum, during the initial period of his re-integration. He was eventually transferred to his home town of Afbara. Nine other former Guantanamo detainees went through the reintegration program with no sign of recidivism.

==Recidivism==
In December 2015, al Qosi (as Sheikh Khubayb al Sudani) was featured in a video released by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which he reportedly joined in 2014. The footage showed him and other al-Qaeda veterans encouraging &quot;individual jihad&quot;.

He gave a 12-page interview on the life and legacy of Osama bin Laden in the AQAP magazine &quot;Inspire&quot; Spring 2016 issue (#15).

In October 2021, Qosi threatened the United States with attacks and praised Nidal Hasan.

<doc id="486950" wikidata="Q4892500" url="?curid=486950" title="Berlin-to-Kitchener name change">
<text>The city of Berlin, Ontario, Canada, changed its name to &quot;Kitchener&quot; by referendum in May and June1916. Named in 1833 after the capital of Prussia and later the German Empire, the name &quot;Berlin&quot; became unsavoury for residents after Britain and Canada&#x27;s entry into the First World War.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, most residents of Berlin and neighbouring Waterloo were of German origin. The towns and their citizens lived peacefully and enjoyed a unique blend of German and British culture. Following Britain and Canada&#x27;s entry into war against Germany in August1914, German Canadians experienced increasing anti-German sentiment. In early 1916, business and community leaders began pushing for Berlin to either seek a new name or amalgamate with Waterloo. Rising tension in the community culminated in soldiers of the local 118th Battalion ransacking German social clubs and attacking an outspoken German Lutheran preacher.

In a vote characterized by intimidation, the 19May 1916 referendum on whether to change the city name decided &quot;yes&quot; by a slim margin. A vote held the following month to determine a replacement name saw lower voter turnout. The vote settled on &quot;Kitchener&quot;, named for the recently deceased British Army officer Horatio Herbert Kitchener. &quot;Kitchener&quot; prevailed in a tight race over the only serious competitor, &quot;Brock&quot; – for Isaac Brock, a British military leader in the War of 1812. The city officially changed names on 1September 1916.

Towns across the English-speaking world retreated from their German culture during the First World War, with similar cases seen in the United States and Australia. The Berlin–Kitchener change distinguished itself by the levels of violence and protest. The name change failed to assuage outside suspicion of the city and its German population, propelled partly by opponents unsuccessfully petitioning the Ontario Government to stop the change from proceeding as well as the election of an anti-conscription candidate in Waterloo North in the 1917 federal election. After the war, the city experienced a decline in its German culture with German Canadians being culturally assimilated into the broader Canadian identity.

==Background==
Originally known as Eby&#x27;s Town, Ebytown, Ben Eby&#x27;s or Sandhills by the first Mennonites from Pennsylvania to settle in the area, an influx of German-speaking European immigrants beginning in the 1820s pushed local community leaders Benjamin Eby and Joseph Schneider to change the Upper Canadian hamlet&#x27;s name to Berlin in 1833. In the 1870s, most residents of Berlin and neighbouring Waterloo, Ontario, were of German origin, comprising 73 and 80 per cent of each population, respectively. Many Germans immigrated to Canada to escape the conflicts of Europe and were inclusive of the town&#x27;s Anglo-Saxon population. Most immigrants arrived before the &quot;Völkisch&quot; movement spawned in the late 19th century, resulting in a German community less concerned with German nationalism than those who immigrated to western Canada after the 1870s. Historians John English and Kenneth McLaughlin write that the common background of both employers and employees in Berlin allowed for a softening of racial and social animosity.

Berliners displayed a simultaneous loyalty to both the British Empire and to their German heritage. Germans pointed to the relationship between the British and German royal families, such as the marriage of the English Queen Victoria to the German Prince Albert, as a source of pride. In May1871, the towns held a joint German heritage celebration, attracting around 12,000 participants. The , or &quot;Peace Festival&quot;, marked the end of the Franco-Prussian War, resulting in the unification of Germany. The strength of the British-German relationship was such that the German festival closed with &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;. Historian Geoffrey Hayes writes that the festival – and subsequent , or song festivals – served as a way for German-speaking residents to develop their German-Canadian identity in a way acceptable to other Canadians. The nine held from 1874 to 1912 in Berlin and Waterloo generated positive national press coverage and large crowds of visitors.

Berlin residents often displayed both the Union Jack and the German flag next to one another. Visiting royalty and politicians – including the Governor General, the Marquis of Lorne; Princess Louise; the Duke of Connaught; and the former Princess Louise Margaret of Prussia – praised the bonds displayed between the British and German populations of Berlin and Waterloo. Based on a model by sculptor Reinhold Begas, the community leaders George Rumpel and John Motz dedicated a bust of Kaiser Wilhelm I in Victoria Park in August1897. Residents saw the bust as symbolically representing the bond between Germany and Britain. Government support for the project was strong, Canadian Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier ensuring the bust entered Canada duty-free. By the early 20th century, few residents considered themselves wholly German, instead identifying as German-Canadian. The 1911 census listed 76 per cent of people in the community as being of German origin, most of whom had never been to Germany. Among Waterloo&#x27;s residents, 90 per cent were born in Canada. Berliners avidly embraced their German heritage, with celebrations commemorating the birthdays of Otto von Bismarck and the Kaiser typical. In February1914, while celebrating Kaiser Wilhelm II&#x27;s 55th birthday, W. H. Schmalz addressed Waterloo&#x27;s Concordia Club:

== World War I ==
=== Outbreak ===
Britain declared war on Germany on 4August 1914. As a Dominion of the British Empire, Canada automatically entered the war following Britain&#x27;s declaration. On 12August, the &quot;Berliner Journal&quot;, a local German-language weekly, implored Germans in Ontario: &quot;Don&#x27;t allow yourselves to be driven to demonstrations of any kind, avoid arguments... Be silent, bear this difficult time with dignity, and show that you are true Germans grateful to the country that accommodated you.&quot; British policy allowed Germans across the Dominion four days to leave, while the German government encouraged the German diaspora to return. The 1911 census counted 393,320 people of German origin living across Canada. Because the war was being fought in Europe, Berlin residents expected the fighting to have little direct impact on their lives. German social clubs continued to meet and found their proceedings unaffected. Ministers holding religious services in German declared their loyalty to the Canadian war effort.

Three weeks after Canada&#x27;s entry into the war, vandals toppled Victoria Park&#x27;s bust of Kaiser Wilhelm and threw it into the park&#x27;s lake. Residents retrieved the bust and apprehended the three youths responsible. In the months following the outbreak of the war, Berlin&#x27;s Board of Education voted to end the use of German in schools. Respected Berlin citizens, including businessman and politician Louis Jacob Breithaupt, held public meetings opposed to the decision. In his reply to the speech from the throne on 19August 1914, Conservative MP Donald Sutherland expressed sympathy to the German people for &quot;the dangers brought upon them by their ruling classes, by their oligarchic, insane, military government.&quot; The same day, Canadian Prime Minister Robert Borden stated that people born in Germany and Austria-Hungary and who came to Canada &quot;as adopted citizens of this country, whether they are naturalized or not, are entitled to the protection of the law in Canada and shall receive it&quot;, adding that an exception would be made for those aiding and abetting the enemy.

In early 1915, Waterloo North MP William George Weichel expressed in Canada&#x27;s House of Commons that German-speaking Canadians could be proud of their cultural heritage while remaining loyal to the Canadian war effort. The year before, Waterloo and Berlin, measured on a per capita basis, were first and second in Canada, respectively, in individual contributions to the Canadian Patriotic Fund. Of the 60 members of Waterloo&#x27;s German social club, the Acadian Club, half enlisted in Canada&#x27;s armed forces. The club hosted events supporting the Canadian Red Cross and the Patriotic Fund. Local Professor F. V. Riecthdorf proclaimed, &quot;I am a native German and former soldier... My loyalty is to the British flag... let our response to the Empire be immediate and sufficient!&quot; Trying to lessen signs of disloyalty, in May1915 the Berlin City Council asked for the appointment of a local Registrar of Enemy Aliens, though this request was denied after being deemed unnecessary.

=== Increasing anti-German sentiment ===

The war led to condemnation of the German tradition in Canada and rising anti-German sentiments. Actions by the German Empire contributed to anti-German feelings, including the violation of Belgium&#x27;s neutrality, their use of poison gas, the execution of Edith Cavell, the sinking of the RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot;, and an apocryphal story of German troops crucifying a Canadian soldier. In a 1March 1916 letter to the &quot;Berlin News Record&quot;, the chair of the North Waterloo recruiting committee stated: &quot;The fact remains that Berlin was named after the capital of Prussia and is to-day the capital of the German Empire, whence have emanated the most diabolical crimes and atrocities that have marred the pages of history.&quot; A fire at Parliament Hill in February1916 was falsely assumed to have been set by German arsonists. Although many accounts of wartime atrocities were later shown to be fabrications and British propaganda, most Canadian citizens took them to be true.

The use of the German language or the display of German flags became seen as signs of Canadian disloyalty. Young men, many of them German, were harassed in the street if they had not signed up for military service. Newspapers in Toronto like &quot;The Globe&quot; and &quot;Toronto News&quot; made frequent attacks on German-Canadians. A &quot;Globe&quot; editorial warned that Berliners should be kept under observation, warning of espionage. To guard against the perceived threat of sabotage and attacks by German-Canadians, 16,000 Canadian soldiers were stationed in Canada; between October1915 and September1916, 50,000 Canadian Expeditionary Force volunteers were kept home to protect against any eventualities. Beginning in 1914, those Germans deemed a threat to national security were interned; the Canadian government held discretionary power to intern any civilian they considered either an &quot;agent&quot; or of potential service to an enemy power. In 1916, roughly 2,000 Germans were interned across Canada, totalling 2,009 by war&#x27;s end. Though none were interned or jailed in Ontario, Germans across the province experienced a curtailing of their rights and freedoms. In a February1916 diary entry, L. J. Breithaupt lamented, &quot;Public sentiment in Canada is very anti-German &amp; so to some extent against anything connected with or reminding one of Germany.&quot; Canadian military leaders also espoused anti-German sentiments. In an April1916 letter to the &quot;Berlin News Record&quot;, Sergeant-Major Granville Blood warned Berliners: &quot;Be British. Do your duty or be despised... Be British or be dead.&quot; In a printed address to Canada, Lieutenant Stanley Nelson Dacey wrote:

In January1916, members of the local 118th Battalion campaigned for new recruits but – like most battalions in Canada – found little success. Recruiters resorted to harassing men in the streets who had not signed up for service and forcing them into the recruiting office. Berlin&#x27;s local police force found it difficult to control the battalion. When Constable Blevins, a Berlin police officer, attempted to arrest soldier Joseph Meinzinger for harassing citizens, Meinzinger broke Blevins&#x27; jaw. On 15February, a group of Canadian soldiers from the Battalion broke into the Concordia Club, stole memorabilia and destroyed the interior. An inquiry from Camp Borden led to no charges and instead justified the raid.

In early 1916, Canada&#x27;s Militia Minister, Sam Hughes, made a speech in the House of Commons attacking the Reverend C. R. Tappert, a Berlin Lutheran minister. Tappert became a controversial figure locally for several actions, including his continued use of German in religious services, telling his children to avoid saluting the Union Jack and to not sing &quot;God Save the King&quot;, his refusal to contribute to the Patriotic Fund and his public doubting of anti-German propaganda. In an early 1915 letter to the &quot;Berlin News Record&quot;, he wrote that while he was loyal to Canada his heart remained German. Hughes accused Tappert of being a &quot;[semi-apologist] for German atrocities and Kaiserism.&quot; Tappert ignored threats to leave the country by 1March; on 4 or 5March a group of 60 soldiers broke into Tappert&#x27;s parsonage and seized him. A witness recalled: &quot;Within minutes, Tappert was being dragged behind horses through the streets, his face bloodied, his body twisting as he fell into unconsciousness while the pavement scraped off his flesh.&quot; Magistrate John J. A. Weir warned the two soldiers responsible – Private Schaefer and Sergeant-Major Granville Blood – that he remembered Schaefer being connected to the throwing of the Kaiser Wilhelm bust in the Victoria Park lake in 1914 and he knew Blood had further plans to attack other citizens. Both received suspended sentences of $100 fines () and/or six months in prison for the assault. Hughes blamed Tappert for instigating them with his anti-British sentiments. Tappert and his family left Berlin on 8March.

==Organization of the referendum==

The first suggestion of a name change appeared in a letter to the &quot;Berlin News Record&quot; on 4February 1916. The author, identified only as &quot;A &quot;, suggested the Berlin City Council adopt a resolution changing the name of the city. The initial impetus for changing the city name was borne out of monetary rather than patriotic interests. The start of war brought many contracts to the city&#x27;s manufacturers, but business leaders worried the &quot;made in Berlin&quot; label on their products would hurt sales. On 8February 1916, the Berlin Board of Trade proposed changing the city&#x27;s name, hoping that doing so would serve to indicate the city&#x27;s patriotism to the rest of the Dominion and thereby help local business. On 11February, the Berlin City Council resolved:

Most at the meeting endorsed the resolution with only one member voting against it. L. J. Breithaupt attended the meeting and spoke against the resolution, arguing that any name change would have no effect on British victory in the war and that any proposal of changing the city name should instead be put to a popular vote. In his diary he called the event, &quot;an epoch making meeting&quot;. On 21February, organizers of the resolution brought a petition with 1,080 signatures to the city council calling for the name change. City council voted in favour of petitioning Ontario&#x27;s Legislative Assembly to have the city&#x27;s name changed and to possibly amalgamate with Waterloo. Businessmen and community leaders wrote letters to the &quot;Berlin News Record&quot; arguing for and against the name change. Many arguments turned toward ad hominem. At an earlyMarch meeting manufacturers and businessmen pushed for the name change. Those opposing the change were threatened with boycotts. The city council offered a reward for the most suitable replacement name and received thousands of suggestions by the end of March. On 4April, Berlin&#x27;s delegation appeared before the Ontario&#x27;s Legislative Assembly&#x27;s Private Bills Committee. The committee voted to not report the bill to the Legislature out of fears that violence would break-out in Berlin as a result. Returning to Berlin unsuccessful, the delegation formed a British League &quot;to promote British Sentiments in the community&quot;. On 14April, the league passed their own resolution imploring the city council to protest their treatment at Ontario&#x27;s Legislative Assembly. The council passed the resolution, including in it an amendment that allowed them to hold a referendum over the issue. During a 24April meeting, the council voted to hold a referendum on 19May.

Most Berliners expressed little interest in the campaign but those who did found it intense. Archivist Barbara Wilson states: &quot;Many Berliners, including Mayor J. E. Hett, saw no real purpose in changing Berlin&#x27;s name, but to oppose the change-the-name movement actively in February[1916] would have led to more charges of disloyalty and pro-Germanism.&quot; The &quot;Berlin Telegraph&quot; supported the name change while the &quot;Berlin News Record&quot; opposed. Both papers ran pieces and advertisements arguing their positions. Tensions continued to rise, culminating on 5May when 30 soldiers entered and ransacked the Acadian Club in Waterloo. Canada&#x27;s Minister of Justice, Charles Doherty, refused to reimburse the club for the damages, explaining that doing so would engender further racial disharmony. William Breithaupt, head of Berlin&#x27;s library board and the president of the Waterloo Historical Society, was outspoken in his opposition to the name change. Throughout the campaign he received threatening letters and found the phone lines to his house cut.

==Voting and results==
===May 1916 referendum===

On 19May 1916, the referendum was held in Berlin asking voters: &quot;Are you in favour of changing the name of this city?&quot; Historian Adam Crerar writes that much of the voting was characterized by intimidation. Soldiers of the 118th kept potential name change opponents away from the polls, while name change proponents challenged unnaturalized citizens. Many of those disenfranchised had voted in previous elections and had sent sons to fight for Canada in the war.

Of 3,057 votes cast, &quot;yes&quot; won by 81 votes. English &amp; McLaughlin write that women and soldiers were generally &quot;yes&quot; voters, while the working class and residents of the especially German North Ward generally voted &quot;no&quot;. The result of the vote prompted supporters to celebrate in the streets. A report in the &quot;Berlin News Record&quot; recounted fireworks being set off into the air and the sidewalks, ultimately injuring many celebrants. Alderman J. A. Hallman sent a telegram to King George V informing him, &quot;The loyal citizens of Berlin Canada rejoice to inform Your Majesty that they have this day cast off forever the name of the Prussian capital.&quot; The Duke of Connaught informed Hallman on 23May that the King had received his telegram. A regimental band and crowd walked through Berlin and gathered in front of August Lang&#x27;s home, a major opponent of the name change. Lang confronted the crowd and an altercation ensued. Colonel Lochead of the 118th Battalion found no fault on the part of his soldiers. On 22May, a week after the initial referendum, the 707 soldiers in the 118th Battalion left for London, Ontario, to continue training, alleviating much on the tension in the community.

===June 1916 name selection===

A civic committee of 99 members was assembled to produce name recommendations. The committee narrowed thousands of suggestions to a shortlist of Huronto, Bercana, Dunard, Hydro City, Renoma and Agnoleo. A report in the &quot;Berlin News Record&quot; wrote that the names became &quot;the joke of the country&quot;. On 1June, the Berlin City Council thanked the committee and decided to assemble its own list, offering cash prizes for winning suggestions. On 5June, Britain&#x27;s Secretary of State for War, Horatio Herbert Kitchener, drowned aboard HMS &quot;Hampshire&quot; after it struck a mine while en route to Russia. News of his drowning was widely reported the following day. The &quot;Berlin News Record&quot; published a letter in its 7June edition from local resident Elsie Master, who suggested &quot;Kitchener&quot; as a better alternative to &quot;Berlin&quot;, writing it would evoke &quot;splendid patriotism, tremendous energy, great attainments, and a sense of unswerving honour and rectitude&quot;. The city council added Kitchener to their revised shortlist of names, the name being particularly popular among local businessmen, though some felt it to be in poor taste. An editorial in Stratford, Ontario&#x27;s &quot;Herald&quot; complained: &quot;No name of a martyr of this war should be allowed to be appropriated where the motive is largely commercial.&quot;

The final choices for the vote were narrowed to Brock, Kitchener, Corona, Adanac, Keowana and Benton. Some residents suggested that Berlin be renamed Waterloo and the cities merge. A resolution pushing for this failed in Berlin&#x27;s City Council on 20June. From 24 to 28June 1916, between 9:00 am and 9:00 pm each day, a second vote was held to determine a new city name. Turnout was low, with only 892 votes cast out of a possible 4,897. Of those, 163 spoiled their ballots, many crossing out all the options and writing in either Berlin or Waterloo. Kitchener won with 346 votes, besting Brock by eleven votes.

==Reaction and aftermath==
===Immediate===

Wilson writes that the reaction to the June vote result was &quot;dead silence&quot;. Regarding the low voter turnout, the &quot;Berlin News Record&quot; commented: &quot;The outstanding feature was the absolute indifference displayed by the ratepayers.&quot; On 4July 1916, the Berlin City Council approved the vote, setting 1September 1916 as when the city would officially become Kitchener. On 11July, the city council endorsed a petition by the newly formed Citizens&#x27; League, garnering 2,068 signatures opposing the name change. A delegation took the petition on to Ontario&#x27;s Legislative Assembly. The provincial government refused to stop the change seeing the vote as having been entirely orderly. On 23August, the Ontario government passed an order recognizing the change as coming into effect on 1September.

On 1September 1916, Berlin officially became Kitchener. English &amp; McLaughlin write that Berlin&#x27;s name change failed to quell outside suspicions about the loyalty of the German population. Those who opposed the name change were harassed for their defiance. Letter writers continued to address their mail to Berlin, forcing the Post Office to issue memoranda, while municipalities in Ontario petitioned the government to force those who refused to reference the city as Kitchener. In the lead-up to Kitchener&#x27;s 1January 1917 municipal election, members of the British League sought to expel &quot;aliens&quot; off the voters&#x27; list. Every candidate elected to the city council had previously been against the name change. When the results were announced, the British League, citizens and soldiers of the 118th Battalion gathered outside the &quot;Berlin News Record&quot; office, as well as mayor-elect David Gross&#x27;s home and button factory. Soldiers smashed windows and destroyed the interiors of both buildings. In an effort to defuse tensions, Gross pledged in his inaugural address that he would not try to change Kitchener&#x27;s name back to Berlin.

The last major attempt to change the name of Kitchener back to Berlin came during a 2December 1919 city council meeting. A finance committee report recommended another vote be held regarding the city&#x27;s name. A crowd of 500, mostly members of the Great War Veterans&#x27; Association, made their way into the council room to show their opposition to the resolution. The council voted the resolution down but protestors assaulted two aldermen who abstained from the vote, forcing them to kiss the Union Jack and throwing one in the Victoria Park lake.

===1917 federal election===


On 24November 1917, Prime Minister Robert Borden visited Kitchener to generate support for his &quot;Military Service Act&quot; and to campaign for his Unionist Party in the upcoming federal election. Two months earlier, his government passed the &quot;Wartime Elections Act&quot; which, among other things, disenfranchised voters expected to be opposed to conscription. The disenfranchisement included Germans who received their citizenship after 31 March 1902. At the November event, a group of disgruntled citizens heckled Borden, an incident which received national press coverage. Local manufacturers and businessmen subsequently urged Kitchener City Council to apologize to the prime minister to prevent further lost business, but the city council refused to apologize by a vote of seven to five. Newspapers in other Ontario cities – including Kingston, Guelph and Brantford – pointed to the refusal as evidence that, though Kitchener had changed its name, the residents remained loyal to Germany over Canada. In his memoirs, Borden reflected that, for the rest of Canada, &quot;the Kitchener incident was much more effective than any speech I could have delivered.&quot; Following the refusal, the Board of Trade and the Kitchener Manufacturers&#x27; Association protested the action by organizing a factory shutdown scheduled for 3December. On the day of the protest, city council voted to apologize to stop a prolonged shutdown.

During the election campaign, newspapers across Ontario generally sided with the Union government and their pro-conscription stance. Kitchener and Waterloo were similar, where in the final three and a half weeks of the election campaign the &quot;Berlin News Record&quot; and the &quot;Berlin Telegraph&quot; did not publish or report on any campaign material from the Liberals, forcing Liberal challenger William Daum Euler to print his own paper, the &quot;Voice of the People&quot;. Union campaign posters argued, &quot;Who would the Kaiser vote for?&quot; In the vote, the incumbent Unionist Weichel lost his Waterloo North seat to Euler, a major opponent of conscription. Carried by the German vote, Euler won by a twenty-point margin, the largest majority of any of Ontario&#x27;s Liberals. Illustrating the divide, he took 63.1 per cent of the civilian vote but only 4.6 per cent of the soldier vote. The defeated Weichel lamented, &quot;you cannot beat the Kaiser in North Waterloo.&quot; German animus for the Union Government and the Conservative Party persisted for generations, while Euler&#x27;s win reinforced outside perceptions that the residents of Kitchener and Waterloo remained loyal to Germany despite the name change.

== Legacy ==

In the years during and immediately following the First World War, numerous towns in Canada, the US and Australia changed the names of places associated with Germany, though the levels of public unrest displayed during the Berlin-Kitchener name change distinguishes it from other contemporary name change examples. The historian David Blackbourn describes the First World War as a caesura for people of German descent in the Anglo-Saxon world, marking a general decline in German culture: &quot;When the heavily German city of Berlin, Ontario, became Kitchener, and Berlin, Iowa, became Lincoln, these were instances of something repeated thousands of times across the German-speaking parts of the English speaking world. Little Germanys retreated sharply.&quot; In the final months of the war, the Canadian Government passed an Order in Council requiring all Canadian newspapers in &quot;languages of the enemy&quot; to be published in either English or French. Ontario&#x27;s last German-language newspaper, the &quot;Berliner Journal&quot;, ran its last issue in December1918. The government repealed the order in January1920, but it was not until 1967 that another German-language newspaper appeared in Kitchener.

Anti-German sentiments persisted in the immediate aftermath of the war. Many German-Canadians anglicized their names – changing Braun to Brown and Schmidt to Smith, for example – and instead referred to their heritage as Dutch or Austrian. A 1919 Order in Council forbade German immigrants to enter Canada, a restriction held in place until 1923. In the decades that followed, the German population of Kitchener decreased continuously. The 1911 census listed 76 per cent of people in the community as being of German origin, dropping to 55.6 and 53 per cent in 1921 and 1931 censuses, respectively. Though the city had attracted large numbers of German immigrants in the previous century, when the restrictions on immigration were lifted in 1923 most newcomers instead settled in western Canada where resource industries were plentiful and land was inexpensive.

In the early 1930s, Kitchener and Waterloo largely rejected local fascist movements inspired by Germany&#x27;s rising Nazi Party. When Canada and Britain again found themselves at war against Germany during the Second World War, community leaders were sensitive to charges of disloyalty and acted quickly to assuage outside doubts; the Concordia Club and other German social clubs shut down in August1939. Kitchener experienced little of the anti-German sentiment seen during the First World War. During the war, seven Kitchener residents were interned as enemy aliens. This was a lower number than that of surrounding communities, a fact the &quot;Daily Record&quot; reported proudly. Historian William Campbell credits the lack of anti-German sentiment to a broadening of the Canadian identity following the First World War, extending beyond the dominant English and French cultures. English &amp; McLaughlin point to the automobile and new forms of mass media – such as movies, the radio and magazines – as expanding culture in Kitchener and bringing it more in alignment with Canada and North America as a whole. Most scholars agree that in the decades following the war Germans in Canada were assimilated.

Through the second half of the 20th century, Greeks, Portuguese, Indian, West Indian and Chinese ethnic groups dominated immigration to the community, 25 per cent of residents considering themselves of German origin in the 2001 census. After English, German was the second-most spoken language in Waterloo Region until 2016, when it was surpassed by Mandarin. In the aftermath of the First World War, the community shifted to emphasizing the Pennsylvania Dutch and Mennonite communities that first settled in the area, illustrated in Mabel Dunham&#x27;s 1924 work of historical fiction, &quot;The Trail of the Conestoga&quot;, and in the 1926 dedication of the Waterloo Pioneer Memorial Tower. Overt celebrations of the city&#x27;s European German tradition returned in the late 1960s and early 1970s; the Kitchener–Waterloo Oktoberfest attracts hundreds of thousands of participants annually, making it the largest Oktoberfest celebrated in North America, though English &amp; McLaughlin comment the event is more a celebration of drinking than of German culture. In 1992, author William Chadwick examined the name change in a work of popular history, published as &quot;The Battle for Berlin, Ontario: An Historical Drama&quot;. He produced a play from the book, &quot;The Berlin Show&quot;, staged for Waterloo audiences in the summer of 1994. In the 21st century, Horatio Herbert Kitchener&#x27;s role in establishing concentration camps during the Second Boer War has made his legacy unsavoury to some Kitchener residents. In 2020, a 380-signature petition calling for another name change prompted the Kitchener City Council to respond: &quot;While we in no way condone, diminish or forget his actions... Kitchener has become so much more than its historic connection to a British field marshal.&quot;

<text>Broad Universe is a United States-based, all volunteer organization with the primary goal of promoting science fiction, fantasy, and horror written by women. Writers, editors, publishers, reviewers, artists, and fans are invited to join them. &quot;Broad-minded&quot; men are welcome to participate. The organization originated in a panel discussion at WisCon, the feminist science fiction convention in Madison, Wisconsin, in 2000. 

Broad Universe created the Rapid Fire Reading with a small group of member authors who each read an excerpt from their work no more than 5 minutes long. This has been very popular at conventions. It gives more authors an opportunity to read and it gives the audience a taste of fantastic fiction from several authors instead of just one.

Broad Universe buys dealer&#x27;s tables at various conventions (genre related or publishers, librarians and other conventions of use to the members.) One member benefit is the sale of their books at 0% commission by Broad Universe volunteers at conventions.

<doc id="486953" wikidata="Q1096546" url="?curid=486953" title="Into the Void (Nine Inch Nails song)">
<text>&quot;Into the Void&quot; is a song by American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails from their third studio album, &quot;The Fragile&quot;, released in 1999. It is the album&#x27;s third single and saw release early 2000. A music video was directed by Walter Stern and Jeff Richter.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Into the Void&quot; was released as a single only in Australia on 10 January 2000. It peaked at #72 on the ARIA singles chart. This Australian release lacks a halo number, making it the only commercial Nine Inch Nails release with that distinction. (The Capital G single was released to Europe as a non-halo&#x27;ed 9&quot; vinyl in June 2007.) However, a two-track promotional CD for &quot;Into the Void&quot;, released only in the United States, was incorrectly identified as &quot;Halo Sixteen.&quot; As it was not an international release and was only sold in Australia, it is considered a rare release for NIN memorabilia collectors.

The version of &quot;The Perfect Drug&quot; included on this single is slightly longer than the one released on the &quot;Lost Highway&quot; soundtrack. It fades out at the end instead of ending abruptly. It is the same version found on the &quot;We&#x27;re in This Together Pt. 3&quot; single. This track and all of the other tracks on this disc can be found on other halos.

&quot;Into the Void&quot; was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance, but lost to &quot;Again&quot; by Lenny Kravitz.

==Music video==

A music video for the song was directed by Walter Stern and Jeff Richter. An alternate version of the video was later released. The video begins with a series of macrophotographic close-ups of Trent Reznor, including his eyes, hair, and mouth. The video concludes with the Nine Inch Nails band performing the song in a red room and eventually destroying their equipment and the set itself. &quot;Into the Void&quot; was nominated for the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards Breakthrough Video award, but lost out to Björk&#x27;s &quot;All Is Full of Love&quot;, directed by Chris Cunningham.

==Track listing==
==Charts==
== In other media ==
The song was played in the 2000 film &quot;Final Destination&quot; in one of the characters&#x27; car radio.

During Tennocon 2023, the song was used in a cinematic teaser trailer for an upcoming update to the video game &quot;Warframe&quot;.

<text>London Irish RFC is a professional rugby union club that most recently competed in the Premiership, the top division of rugby union in England. The club also participated in the European Champions Cup, and the European Challenge Cup. While competing in the RFU Championship, the second tier of English rugby, during the 2016–17 and 2018–19 seasons, London Irish also took part in the British and Irish Cup and the RFU Championship Cup. For twenty years, the club played its home games at the Madejski Stadium in Reading, Berkshire, before relocating to the Brentford Community Stadium in Brentford, West London, for the 2020–21 season.

The club was founded in 1898 following the creation of London Scottish, London Cornish and London Welsh for the same reason, allowing Irishmen the chance to play rugby with fellow countrymen in the English capital. They won their only major trophy, the Powergen Cup, in 2002 and reached the 2009 Premiership final, losing 10–9 to Leicester Tigers. In the 2007–08 season, the team came close to a place in the Heineken Cup Final, losing out to Stade Toulousain 15–21 in the semi-final.

London Irish faced financial difficulties during the 2022–23 season and was issued a winding-up order by HMRC over an unpaid tax demand. To avoid suspension from the Premiership, the RFU set a deadline for the club to provide financial assurances confirming its ability to continue paying players and staff. The club failed to meet this deadline and was subsequently excluded from competing in the 2023–24 season—not only in the Premiership but across all professional tiers of rugby union in England. After a number of moribund years, the club exited administration on 12 February 2025 when it was purchased by a consortium led by Irish former Formula One owner, Eddie Jordan.

==History==
===Formation and early years===

London Irish was the second to last club to be formed in England by working and student exiles from the home countries, following London Scottish in 1878, London Welsh in 1885, and London Cornish
in 1962. The first game took place on 1 October 1898 against the former Hammersmith club at Herne Hill Athletic Ground, with London Irish winning 8–3. The team that season benefited from the early recruitment of vet and Irish international Louis Magee. He became essential in the early years of the club along with club captain R.S Dyas in putting the team on the map and having regular fixtures between other London-based teams.

===War and conflict===
The turn of the new century was a great time for London Irish with the club firmly solidified in the London club roster but these would be some of the last years of normality for the team. With the commencement of World War I, many of the players enlisted with Irish Battalions in their homeland for deployment in mainland Europe. In 1916, following the Easter Rising, a number of remaining players and members returned to Ireland to fight in the independence struggle; many did not return. It is unknown exactly how many with a connection to the club were lost. Following the formation of the Irish Free State in 1923, some of those who fought in Europe and/or Ireland returned to the club, which saw an overhaul of the organisation over the remainder of the decade, reviving the team and its influence for a new beginning.

In the years that followed, Irish made strides in playing competition outside of Greater London with matches against teams such as Leicester and Cardiff. This, however, was short-lived with the commencement of World War II and players and members again being dispersed across the continent, many of whom elected not to return following the end of the war. Nine of the players who participated in the 1938–39 season died in the conflict. The club&#x27;s then playing ground located in Sunbury-on-Thames was acquired by Ministry for Agriculture to be used as a site to grow food for the war-torn capital. Because of the state of the playing field after the war, games were temporarily held at Rectory Field in Blackheath.

===Post-war years===
The post-war era got off to a rocky beginning. Player numbers weren&#x27;t what they used to be as former members elected not to move back to London and this made it difficult to front a starting XV. The year that followed saw the Winter of 1946, one of the coldest winters on record in the United Kingdom. Rectory Field was frozen for most of the winter meaning Irish missed matches in the season. Things picked up with the arrival of a new captain, Des O&#x27;Brien, and a number of other key players and in 1948 London Irish celebrated their 50th anniversary with the most successful season yet for the club.

In the 1950s the club thrived, fielding teams most weeks, and in 1951 they became the first club to host touring Italian team Roma. On 9 September 1959, Irish returned to Sunbury and had a place to call home, which was dubbed &quot;The Avenue&quot;. They achieved a record-breaking season, remaining unbeaten.

Results in the 1960s were mixed, with many good wins but also a number of defeats. Fixtures improved and the club played against many famous teams, which changed the attitude of the training and playing and, in the 70s, London Irish became a force to be reckoned with, finishing first in the London Division of the Rugby Football Union in the 1976–77 season. Pre-season tours became popular and in 1977, the London Irish made history in South Africa when they became the first touring side to play a host of mixed-race teams.

===Professional era===

Since the professional era began in August 1995, London Irish has only lifted one piece of major silverware, winning the Powergen Cup in 2002 in a match against Northampton at Twickenham that saw the club win 38–7. Some 75,000 people attended the match, seeing the Exiles win in what is regarded as one of the most successful days in the club&#x27;s history. London Irish enjoyed success in Europe in 2005–06 when they reached the final of the Challenge Cup, only to be defeated by Gloucester 36–34 at Twickenham.

In 2013, Irish were taken over by a consortium led by Mick Crossan, executive chairman of Powerday, a London-based recycling and waste management firm. Powerday would go on to be one of the club&#x27;s main sponsors.

In early May 2023, the RFU sought clarification from London Irish about why the club&#x27;s players and staff had not yet been paid for April 2023. On 15 May the RFU gave the club a 30 May deadline to sell the club to new owners, and indicated the club would be suspended from the Premiership if they were not satisfied the club had sufficient funding. Two weeks later, the RFU extended the deadline until 6 June.

On 2 June 2023, London Irish received winding up petitions from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) over an unpaid tax bill believed to be up to £1 million, which saw them forced out of business.
===Post administration era (2024–present)===

In October 2024, it was reported that Irish businessman and TV personality Eddie Jordan alongside former New Zealand and South Africa internationals Andrew Mehrtens and Bobby Skinstad respectively, were forming a consortium to buy London Irish as part of a wider project to emulate the success of the City Football Group.

In February 2025, Strangford Ellis Ltd, led by Eddie Jordan, completed the takeover of London Irish, defeating German businessman Daniel Loitz in the bid. The consortium outlined plans to have the club playing rugby again by 2026, while remaining open to both a return to the Premiership and the possibility of joining the United Rugby Championship.

==Academy==
London Irish managed their own academy, with players such as Tom Homer, Nick Kennedy, Topsy Ojo, Anthony Watson, brothers Delon and Guy Armitage, Alex Corbisiero and Jonathan Joseph having gone on to play for the senior side and be internationally capped. Ojo retired at the end of the 2018–19 season having made 301 appearances for the club.

==Stadium==
From the 2020–21 season, London Irish played at the Gtech Community Stadium, in Brentford, Greater London. The stadium is owned by Brentford F.C. who also play their home games there. The ground is a 17,250-capacity all-seater stadium that opened in 2020.

Prior to 2020, London Irish played at the Madejski Stadium in Reading, Berkshire for twenty seasons between 2000 and March 2020 when the 2019–20 season was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to delays owing to the pandemic, Brentford Stadium was running behind its scheduled opening date. Irish made the decision to play their remaining games when possible at Harlequin&#x27;s Twickenham Stoop as they could not return to Reading. The Exiles had previously played at The Stoop in the 1999–2000 season before moving to the Madejski Stadium.
 
The largest crowd for a London Irish match was for a game against London Wasps on 15 March 2008 during the 2007–08 season. The crowd of 23,790 was also the highest attendance for a regular season Premiership Rugby match until December 2008.

On 12 March 2016, London Irish played their first home Premiership match abroad, and also the first-ever Premiership match outside England, when they travelled to the United States to face Saracens at the New York Red Bulls&#x27; Red Bull Arena in the New York metropolitan area.

On 15 August 2016, the club announced its intention to return to London and that it was in formal discussions with Hounslow London Borough Council to play at Brentford&#x27;s new stadium. On 10 February 2017, the club confirmed that the council had approved its application to use the stadium for rugby, effectively allowing it to move into the new stadium from its opening season. This was later confirmed.

The club&#x27;s training ground and offices were located at the Hazelwood Centre, which is located in the west of the city in Sunbury-on-Thames. The facility was opened in 2014 following the closure of The Avenue and is also used by NFL teams during the NFL International Series as a training facility.

==London Irish Amateur Rugby Football Club==

The club also hosts London Irish Amateur RFC (a separate legal entity) for non-professionals to allow them to improve in rugby. The team plays at the location of London Irish&#x27;s training ground and offices, Hazelwood in Sunbury. Some players such as Justin Bishop and Kieran Campbell have gone through the ranks to play for the London Irish professional team.

==Mascot==
===Digger===
Digger is an Irish wolfhound and the official mascot of London Irish.

In 2003, Digger won the &quot;Best Mascot&quot; award in Premiership Rugby at the Premier Rugby Marketing Awards.

On 23 April 2006, Digger ran the London Marathon raising money for spinal research. He finished the marathon in a time of 6 hours 39 minutes 31 seconds.

===Others===

Digger was joined by his cousin, Duggie, from the 2006–07 season. Much taller and much slower, Duggie has proved popular with younger children attending matchdays. As well as the mascot characters, there is also a real Irish wolfhound, Mr Doyle, who also attends the home games. Prior to Mr Doyle, his great uncle, Jumbo, attended home games before his retirement.

==Rivalries==
London Irish have rivalries in the Greater London area, mainly with Harlequins and Saracens, with whom they are now, thanks to Irish moving back to West London, able to have local derbies. Gtech Community Stadium&#x27;s location makes it less than two miles to the Twickenham Stoop. They also maintain a friendly rivalry with fellow exiles London Scottish.

<text>Gullfoss (&quot;Golden Falls&quot;; ) is a waterfall located in the canyon of the Hvítá river in southwest Iceland.

==History and description==

The Hvítá river flows southward, and about a kilometre above the falls it turns sharply to the west and flows down into a wide curved three-step &quot;staircase&quot; and then abruptly plunges in two stages (, and ) into a crevice deep. The crevice, about wide and in length, extends perpendicular to the flow of the river. The average amount of water running down the waterfall is per second in the summer and per second in the winter. The highest flood measured was per second.

During the first half of the 20th century and some years into the late 20th century, there was much speculation about using Gullfoss to generate electricity. During this period, the waterfall was rented indirectly by its owners, Tómas Tómasson and Halldór Halldórsson, to foreign investors. However, the investors&#x27; attempts were unsuccessful, partly due to lack of money. The waterfall was later sold to the state of Iceland, and is now protected.

Sigríður Tómasdóttir, the daughter of Tómas Tómasson, was determined to preserve the waterfall&#x27;s condition and even threatened to throw herself down. Although it is widely believed, the very popular story that Sigríður saved the waterfall from exploitation is untrue. A stone memorial to Sigriður, located above the falls, depicts her profile.

Gullfoss is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Iceland. Together with Þingvellir and the geysers of Haukadalur, Gullfoss forms part of the Golden Circle, a popular day excursion for tourists in Iceland.

==In popular culture==
Gullfoss appears on the cover of the album &quot;Porcupine&quot; by the British band Echo and the Bunnymen. Additionally, the falls are referenced in the novella &quot;The Odd Saga of the American and a Curious Icelandic Flock&quot;; during a dinner, Snorri expresses a preference for Gullfoss, while Dr. Gustafsson favors Glymur. Gullfoss features in the music video for the single &quot;Heaven&quot; by the band Live. Gullfoss appears briefly in a sub-plot of the TV series &quot;Vikings&quot;, and one character kills herself by diving into it.

Gullfoss appears in the penultimate episode of the thirty-fourth season of the American reality competition &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;.

<doc id="486957" wikidata="Q2612877" url="?curid=486957" title="We're in This Together (Nine Inch Nails song)">
<text>&quot;We&#x27;re in This Together&quot; is a song by industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails released in 1999. It is the 15th official Nine Inch Nails release and is a single for the album &quot;The Fragile&quot;. It was released as a three-disc single (also known as a &quot;triple single&quot;).

==Background==
According to &quot;The Fragile&quot; contributor Keith Hillebrandt, &quot;the whole song started from something [Reznor] actually played at the end of another track ... he wrote it up into an entirely new song&quot;.

The lyrics seem to be inspired by David Bowie&#x27;s song &quot;Heroes&quot; from the same-named 1977 album, such as with the line &quot;You&#x27;re the queen and I&#x27;m the king&quot; and describing two people trying to fight against an ominous and seemingly unstoppable force. Bowie, who is recognized as one of Reznor&#x27;s greatest influences, is given a special thanks credit in the liner notes of &quot;The Fragile&quot;.

MTV&#x27;s Gil Kaufman described the song as &quot;a seven-minute-plus cathartic pop song with somewhat hopeful lyrics over a plodding hip-hop beat, walls of distorted guitars and an eerie slasher-film cricket sound&quot;.

Both &quot;10 Miles High&quot; and &quot;The New Flesh&quot; originally appeared on the vinyl version of &quot;The Fragile&quot;.

The song was featured in the first official teaser trailer for Marvel Studios film &quot;The Avengers&quot;.

The song peaked at #21 on the US Mainstream Rock Billboard. Despite being one of the band&#x27;s most popular songs, the band has only played it live five times, all during the Performance 2007 Tour.

==Music video==

The song&#x27;s music video was directed by Mark Pellington and released on August 27, 1999. An extended version of the video has since surfaced. Trent Reznor and a large group of black-clothed men are seen running down empty streets, onto a train, and into a field. There are also shots of several elderly people, and a brief scene with a young woman.

The video was filmed in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico and in the dry lake of Sayula.

==Release and reception==
&quot;We&#x27;re in This Together&quot; was released on a three-part single, which was only available in Europe and Japan; it was not released in the United States. Two radio promos (the first with the album mix and radio edit of the song, the second with just a unique short edit of the song) were released in America as &quot;Halo 15&quot; as well.

AllMusic critic Christian Huey has reviewed the single release, describing the title track as a &quot;strong song&quot; and &quot;different turn for him emotionally&quot; while stating that &quot;this adrenaline-infused, white noise territory was mined to even better effect on &quot;Wish.&quot; Huey also criticized the three part single release, particularly referring to the orange disk as &quot;the least substantial and the most redundant of the bunch&quot; and &quot;a tired repackaging of material.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; reviewer Ann Powers referred to the song as &quot;a sweet pop tune encased within the armor of industrial rock.&quot;

The track was listed as number 19 on &quot;Spin&quot;″s list of &quot;The 69 Best Alternative Rock Songs of 1999.&quot; Critic Christopher R. Weingarten has stated: &quot;Though the anthemic chorus borders on “hit single,” the song still grinds with crunchy noise, whining guitars and a trash-can-sounding snare drum.&quot;

<doc id="486965" wikidata="Q917520" url="?curid=486965" title="Chinese bronze inscriptions">
<text>Chinese bronze inscriptions, also referred to as bronze script or bronzeware script, comprise Chinese writing made in several styles on ritual bronzes mainly during the Late Shang dynasty () and Western Zhou dynasty (771 BC). Types of bronzes include &quot;zhong&quot; bells and &quot;ding&quot; tripodal cauldrons. Early inscriptions were almost always made with a stylus into a clay mold, from which the bronze itself was then cast. Additional inscriptions were often later engraved onto bronzes after casting. The bronze inscriptions are one of the earliest scripts in the Chinese family of scripts, preceded by the oracle bone script.

==Terminology==

For the early Western Zhou to early Warring States period, the bulk of writing which has been unearthed has been in the form of bronze inscriptions. As a result, it is common to refer to the variety of scripts of this period as &quot;bronze script&quot;, even though there is no single such script. The term usually includes bronze inscriptions of the preceding Shang dynasty as well.
However, there are great differences between the highly pictorial Shang emblem (aka &quot;identificational&quot;) characters on bronzes (see &quot;ox&quot; clan insignia below), typical Shang bronze graphs, writing on bronzes from the middle of the Zhou dynasty, and that on late Zhou to Qin, Han and subsequent period bronzes. Furthermore, starting in the Spring and Autumn period, the writing in each region gradually evolved in different directions, such that the script styles in the Warring States of Chu, Qin and the eastern regions, for instance, were strikingly divergent. In addition, artistic scripts also emerged in the late Spring and Autumn to early Warring States, such as Bird Script (鳥書 &quot;niǎoshū&quot;), also called Bird Seal Script (&quot;niǎozhuàn&quot; 鳥篆), and Worm Script (&quot;chóngshū&quot; 蟲書).

==Inscribed bronzes==
Of the abundant Chinese ritual bronze artifacts extant today, about 12,000 have inscriptions. These have been periodically unearthed ever since their creation, and have been systematically collected and studied since at least the Song dynasty. The inscriptions tend to grow in length over time, from only one to six or so characters for the earlier Shang examples, to forty or so characters in the longest, late-Shang case, and frequently a hundred or more on Zhou bronzes, with the longest up to around 500.

In general, characters on ancient Chinese bronze inscriptions were arranged in vertical columns, written top to bottom, in a fashion thought to have been influenced by bamboo books, which are believed to have been the main medium for writing in the Shang and Zhou dynasties. The very narrow, vertical bamboo slats of these books were not suitable for writing wide characters, and so a number of graphs were rotated 90 degrees; this style then carried over to the Shang and Zhou oracle bones and bronzes. Examples: 

Of the 12,000 inscribed bronzes extant today, roughly 3,000 date from the Shang dynasty, 6,000 from the Zhou dynasty, and the final 3,000 from the Qin and Han dynasties.

==Shang bronze inscriptions==
Inscriptions on Shang bronzes are of a fairly uniform style, making it possible to discuss a &quot;Shang bronze script&quot;, although great differences still exist between typical characters and certain instances of clan names or emblems. Like early period oracle bone script, the structures and orientations of individual graphs varied greatly in the Shang bronze inscriptions, such that one may find a particular character written differently each time rather than in a standardized way (see the many examples of &quot;tiger&quot; graph to the lower left). As in the oracle bone script, characters could be written facing left or right, turned 90 degrees, and sometimes even flipped vertically, generally with no change in meaning. For instance, and both represent the modern character &quot;xū&quot; 戌 (the 11th Earthly Branch), while and are both &quot;hóu&quot; 侯 &quot;marquis&quot;. This was true of normal as well as extra complex identificational graphs, such as the &quot;hǔ&quot; 虎 &quot;tiger&quot; clan emblem at right, which was turned 90 degrees clockwise on its bronze.

These inscriptions are almost all cast (as opposed to engraved), and are relatively short and simple. Some were mainly to identify the name of a clan or other name, while typical inscriptions include the maker&#x27;s clan name and the posthumous title of the ancestor who is commemorated by the making and use of the vessel. These inscriptions, especially those late period examples identifying a name, are typically executed in a script of highly pictographic flavor, which preserves the formal, complex Shang writing as would have primarily been written on bamboo or wood books, as opposed to the concurrent simplified, linearized and more rectilinear form of writing as seen on the oracle bones.

A few Shang inscriptions have been found which were brush-written on pottery, stone, jade or bone artifacts, and there are also some bone engravings on non-divination matters written in a complex, highly pictographic style; the structure and style of the bronze inscriptions is consistent with these.

The soft clay of the piece-molds used to produce the Shang to early Zhou bronzes was suitable for preserving most of the complexity of the brush-written characters on such books and other media, whereas the hard, bony surface of the oracle bones was difficult to engrave, spurring significant simplification and conversion to rectilinearity. Furthermore, some of the characters on the Shang bronzes may have been more complex than normal due to particularly conservative usage in this ritual medium, or when recording identificational inscriptions (clan or personal names); some scholars instead attribute this to purely decorative considerations. Shang bronze script may thus be considered a &quot;formal&quot; script, similar to but sometimes even more complex than the unattested daily Shang script on bamboo and wood books and other media, yet far more complex than the Shang script on the oracle bones.

==Zhou dynasty inscriptions==

===Western Zhou===
Western Zhou dynasty characters (as exemplified by bronze inscriptions of that time) basically continue from the Shang writing system; that is, early W. Zhou forms resemble Shang bronze forms (both such as clan names, and typical writing), without any clear or sudden distinction. They are, like their Shang predecessors in all media, often irregular in shape and size, and the structures and details often vary from one piece of writing to the next, and even within the same piece. Although most are not pictographs in function, the early Western Zhou bronze inscriptions have been described as more pictographic in flavor than those of subsequent periods. During the Western Zhou, many graphs begin to show signs of simplification and linearization (the changing of rounded elements into squared ones, solid elements into short line segments, and thick, variable-width lines into thin ones of uniform width), with the result being a decrease in pictographic quality, as depicted in the chart below.

Some flexibility in orientation of graphs (rotation and reversibility) continues in the Western Zhou, but this becomes increasingly scarce throughout the Zhou dynasty. The graphs start to become slightly more uniform in structure, size and arrangement by the time of the third Zhou sovereign, King Kāng, and after the ninth, King Yì, this trend becomes more obvious.

Some have used the problematic term &quot;large seal&quot; (大篆 &quot;dàzhuàn&quot;) to refer to the script of this period. This term dates back to the Han dynasty, when (small) seal script and clerical script were both in use. It thus became necessary to distinguish between the two, as well as any earlier script forms which were still accessible in the form of books and inscriptions, so the terms &quot;large seal&quot; (大篆 &quot;dàzhuàn&quot;) and &quot;small seal&quot; (小篆 &quot;xiǎozhuàn&quot;, aka 秦篆 &quot;Qín zhuàn&quot;) came into being. However, since the term &quot;large seal&quot; is &quot;variously&quot; used to describe &quot;zhòuwén&quot; (籀文) examples from the ca. 800 BC Shizhoupian compendium, &quot;or&quot; inscriptions on both late W. Zhou bronze inscriptions and the Stone Drums of Qin, &quot;or&quot; all forms (including oracle bone script) predating small seal, the term is best avoided entirely.

===Eastern Zhou===

====Spring and Autumn====

By the beginning of the Eastern Zhou, in the Spring and Autumn period, many graphs are fully linearized, as seen in the chart above; additionally, curved lines are straightened, and disconnected lines are often connected, with the result of greater convenience in writing, but a marked decrease in pictographic quality.

In the Eastern Zhou, the various states initially continued using the same forms as in the late Western Zhou. However, regional forms then began to diverge stylistically as early as the Spring and Autumn period, with the forms in the state of Qin remaining more conservative. At this time, seals and minted coins, both probably primarily of bronze, were already in use, according to traditional documents, but none of the extant seals have yet been indisputably dated to that period.

By the mid to late Spring and Autumn period, artistic derivative scripts with vertically elongated forms appeared on bronzes, especially in the eastern and southern states, and remained in use into the Warring States period (see detail of inscription from the Warring States Tomb of Marquis Yĭ of Zēng below left). In the same areas, in the late Spring and Autumn to early Warring States, scripts which embellished basic structures with decorative forms such as birds or worms also appeared. These are known as Bird Script (&quot;niǎoshū&quot; 鳥書) and Worm Script (&quot;chóngshū&quot; 蟲書), and collectively as Bird-worm scripts, (&quot;niǎochóngshū&quot; 鳥蟲書; see Bronze sword of King Gōujiàn to right); however, these were primarily decorative forms for inscriptions on bronzes and other items, and not scripts in daily use. Some bronzes of the period were incised in a rough, casual manner, with graph structures often differing somewhat from typical ones. It is thought that these reflected the popular (vulgar) writing of the time which coexisted with the formal script.

====Warring States period====
Seals have been found from the Warring States period, mostly cast in bronze, and minted bronze coins from this period are also numerous. These form an additional, valuable resource for the study of Chinese bronze inscriptions. It is also from this period that the first surviving bamboo and silk manuscripts have been uncovered.

In the early Warring States period, typical bronze inscriptions were similar in content and length to those in the late Western Zhou to Spring and Autumn period. One of the most famous sets of bronzes ever discovered dates to the early Warring States: a large set of &quot;biānzhōng&quot; bells from the tomb of Marquis Yĭ of the state of Zēng, unearthed in 1978. The total length of the inscriptions on this set was almost 2,800 characters. 

In the mid to late Warring States period, the average length of inscriptions decreased greatly. Many, especially on weapons, recorded only the date, maker and so on, in contrast with earlier narrative contents. Beginning at this time, such inscriptions were typically engraved onto the already cast bronzes, rather than being written into the wet clay of piece-molds as had been the earlier practice. The engraving was often roughly and hastily executed.

In Warring States period bronze inscriptions, trends from the late Spring and Autumn period continue, such as the use of artistically embellished scripts (e.g., Bird and Insect Scripts) on decorated bronze items. In daily writing, which was not embellished in this manner, the typical script continued evolving in different directions in various regions, and this divergence was accelerated by both a lack of central political control as well as the spread of writing outside of the nobility. In the state of Qin, which was somewhat culturally isolated from the other states, and which was positioned on the old Zhou homeland, the script became more uniform and stylistically symmetrical, rather than changing much structurally. Change in the script was slow, so it remained more similar to the typical late Western Zhou script as found on bronzes of that period and the Shizhoupian compendium of ca. 800 BC. As a result, it was not until around the middle of the Warring States period that popular (aka common or vulgar) writing gained momentum in Qin, and even then, the vulgar forms remained somewhat similar to traditional forms, changing primarily in terms of becoming more rectilinear. Traditional forms in Qin remained in use as well, so that two forms of writing coexisted. The traditional forms in Qin evolved slowly during the Eastern Zhou, gradually becoming what is now called (small) seal script during that period, without any clear dividing line (it is not the case, as is commonly believed, that small seal script was a sudden invention by Li Si in the Qin dynasty). Meanwhile, the Qin vulgar writing evolved into early clerical (or proto-clerical) in the late Warring States to Qin dynasty period, which would then evolve further into the clerical script used in the Han through the Wei-Jin periods.

Meanwhile, in the eastern states, vulgar forms had become popular sooner; they also differed more radically from and more completely displaced the traditional forms. These eastern scripts, which also varied somewhat by state or region, were later misunderstood by Xu Shen, author of the Han dynasty etymological dictionary &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot;, who thought they predated the Warring States Qin forms, and thus labeled them &quot;gǔwén&quot; (古文), or &quot;ancient script&quot;.

==Computer encoding==
It has been anticipated that bronze script will some day be encoded in Unicode, very likely in Plane 3 (the Tertiary Ideographic Plane, or TIP); however, no codepoints have yet been allocated or officially proposed for it (unlike the seal and oracle bone scripts, which both have ranges of codepoints tentatively blocked out within the TIP).

<text>Wu (; Wugniu and IPA: (Shanghainese), (Suzhounese)) is a major group of Sinitic languages spoken primarily in Shanghai, Zhejiang province, and parts of Jiangsu province, especially south of the Yangtze River, which makes up the cultural region of Wu. The Wu languages are at times simply called [[Shanghainese]], especially when introduced to foreigners. The Suzhounese variety was the prestige dialect of Wu as of the 19th century, but had been replaced in status by Shanghainese by the turn of the 20th century, coinciding with a period of rapid language change in the city. The languages of Northern Wu constitute a language family and are mutually intelligible with each other, while those of Southern Wu neither form a phylogenetic language family, nor are mutually intelligible with each other.

Historical linguists view Wu of great significance due to its obviously distinct nature. The Wu languages typically preserve all voiced initials of medieval Chinese, as well as the checked tone in the form of a glottal stop. Wu varieties also have noticeably unique morphological and syntactic innovations, as well as lexicon exclusively found in the Wu grouping. It is also of note that the influential linguist Chao Yuen Ren was a native speaker of Changzhounese, a variety of Northern Wu. The Wu varieties, especially that of Suzhou, are traditionally perceived as soft in the ears of speakers of both Wu and non-Wu languages, leading to the idiom &quot;the tender speech of Wu&quot; ().

==Names==

Speakers of Wu varieties are mostly unaware of this term for their speech, since the classificatory imposition of &quot;Wu&quot; used in linguistics today is a relatively recent coinage. Saying someone &quot;speaks Wu&quot; is therefore akin to saying someone &quot;speaks a Romance language&quot;; it is not a particularly defined entity like Standard Mandarin or Hochdeutsch.

Most speakers are only aware of their local variety&#x27;s affinities with other similarly classified varieties, and will generally only refer to their local Wu variety rather than to the dialect family as a whole. This is typically done by affixing (&#x27;speech&#x27;) to a location&#x27;s endonym. For example, () is used for Wenzhounese. Affixing is also common, and more typical of Northern Wu, as in (: ) for the . Names for the group as a whole include:

* Wu language (; Shanghainese ; Suzhounese ; Wuxinese ; &#x27;Wu language&#x27;), the formal name and standard reference in dialectology literature.
* Wu topolect (), a common name that refers to Wu languages that appends (&quot;dialect, topolect&quot;) instead of (&quot;language&quot;), at times perceived as derogatory.
* Wuyue language (), a poetic and historical name, highlighting the roots of the language in antiquity, specifically the culture of the Wu and Yue states during the Warring States period.
** Goetian, derived from the Japanese spelling of &quot;Wuyue&quot; (; ), is among the alternative names listed by &quot;Ethnologue&quot;.
* Jiang–Zhe speech (), a non-standard name meaning &#x27;the speech of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, occasionally used to highlight the fact that the language is spoken across two provinces.
* Jiangnan speech (), a non-standard, less common name linking the language to the cultural region of Jiangnan. This is not to be confused with the Jiangnan Industrial Groups Koiné spoken in Xiangtan, which is classified as a variety of Mandarin. Contrasts with &quot;Jiāngběihuà&quot; (), ie. Huai Chinese.

==History==
It is believed that Han Chinese peoples first arrived at the area during pre-dynastic history. After the migrations preceding the Upheaval of the Five Barbarians, the vernacular that would later lead to modern Wu Chinese started taking shape, though the court language of Jiankang (today Nanjing) was still noticeably different to that of the commonfolk. A second migration wave during the Southern Song dynasty, this time to Lin&#x27;an (Hangzhou), led to the formation of the modern literary layer, and during the Yuan and Ming dynasties, many operatic traditions and vernacular texts began to appear. Later, during the Qing dynasty, missionaries began translating the Bible into various local varieties, recording the exact pronunciations of many varieties for the first time. This was also when the economic boom of Shanghai happened, leading to its urban variety becoming the prestige variety over that of Suzhou. The 20th century marked a pivotal moment of Wu linguistic change, as Standard Mandarin was promoted nation-wide, though the 21st century is seeing revival efforts for many Wu Chinese varieties.

===Ancient and early dynastic Wu===

Before the migration of the Han Chinese peoples, the Jiangnan region was inhabited by Kra-Dai or Austroasiatic peoples, which were dubbed barbarians by the early Chinese.

According to traditional history, Taibo of Wu settled in the area during the Shang dynasty, bringing along a large section of the population and Chinese administrative practices to form the state of Wu. The majority population of the state would have been the ancient Baiyue peoples, who had very different customs and practices compared to the Chinese.

It is said in Master Lü&#x27;s Spring and Autumn Annals that the customs and languages of the states of Wu and Yue were the same. This refers not just to the Baiyue language of the area, but also of that of &quot;Ancient Wu&quot;, a Sinitic language likely only used by the nobility. The northern border of this Ancient Wu language is at the Huai River rather than the Yangtze like it is today, and its southern limits may have reached as far as Fujian, as Proto-Min may have been a daughter language to Ancient Wu, though this is not fully accepted. As early as the time of Guo Pu (275–324), speakers easily perceived differences between dialects in different parts of China, including the area where Ancient Wu was spoken. The language slowly receded from the north due to growing pressure from the Central Plains, until its northern limit was set near the Yangtze River towards the end of the Western Jin dynasty. Note, however, that due to the fact that all modern Wu varieties work within the Qieyun system, this Old Chinese dialect cannot be the primary origin of Wu Chinese today.

====Non-Sinitic strata====
It is known that Wu languages inherited a significant number of loanwords of Kra-Dai origin. A study of the variety spoken in Maqiao, a suburb of Shanghai, found that 126 out of around a thousand lexical items surveyed were of Kra-Dai origin. Terms such as (: &quot;8loq-su1&quot; &quot;aubergine&quot;) are also shared between other Sinitic languages (eg. Teochew, : &quot;lag8 sou1&quot;) as well as Kra-Dai languages (cf. Standard Zhuang ). Shared terms with Austroasiatic languages have also been suggested, though many of them, such as Vietnamese , , and , have also been argued to be areal features, Chinese words in disguise, or long shots.

Though Sino-Tibetan, Kra-Dai, Austronesian and Austroasiatic are mostly considered to be unrelated to each other, Laurent Sagart has proposed some possible phylogenetic affinities. Specifically, Tai–Kadai and Sino-Tibetan could possibly both belong to the Sino-Austronesian language family (not to be confused with Austroasiatic) due to a scattering of cognates between their ancestral forms, and there is also some, albeit much more tenuous, evidence to suggest that Austroasiatic should also be included. However, his views are but one among competing hypotheses about the phylogeny of these languages, and is not widely accepted. See the Sino-Austronesian languages article for some further detail.

It does appear that Wu varieties have had non-Sinitic influences, and many contain words cognate with those of other languages in various strata. These words however are few and far between, and Wu on the whole is most strongly influenced by other Chinese languages rather than any other linguistic influence.

===Medieval Wu===

This period is bookended by two major migration waves into the Wu-speaking area. The first was in the 4th century from primarily the mountains of Shandong, whereas the second happened during the 12th century, and originated from the Heluo region.

====Northern and Southern dynasties====
Due to events such as the Wu Hu uprising and the Disaster of Yongjia during the Western Jin dynasty, collectively known as the Upheaval of the Five Barbarians, the imperial court from the Heluo region, along with a large migration wave from the North that lasted 150 years, primarily northern Jiangsu and much of Shandong, entered the Jiangnan region, establishing a new capital at Jiankang, modern-day Nanjing.

Migrants went as far south as central Zhejiang, though many settled in the geographically less challenging areas in the north, that is to say, the Yangtze Delta and the Hangjiahu Plain. Early stages of this period of change was likely marked by diglossia, with the commonfolk typically speaking Ancient Wu or their native Shandong or northern Jiangsu Chinese, and the nobility, both new migrants and old aristocracy, typically speaking a variety not dissimilar to that of early medieval Luoyang. This linguistic situation eventually led to the formation of modern Wu, with many early coincidental strata that are hard to differentiate today. It is unclear as to when exactly the language of the Baiyue became extinct, though during the Eastern Han dynasty, Kra-Dai words were recorded in the everyday vernacular of people in the region, and by the end of the Western Jin, the common language of the region was Sinitic, as will be explained below.

As early as the Eastern Wu dynasty, commentators criticized the speech of the Southern aristocracy (ie. that of the Wu-speaking areas), noting that it is neither Wu-sounding nor Northern. However, evidence suggests that the primary language among the populace was, in fact, Sinitic, although not one that was perceived as &quot;civilized&quot;. This possible civilian language would be a common Jiangdong Sinitic language (), as is seen in the &quot;Book of Wei&quot;, which unflatteringly compares the speech of Jiangdong to the calls of wild animals. The court language of Jiankang at this time would not have been the same as the civilian Wu language, though it would have been closely related. This would also mark the time where Japanese &quot;Go-on&quot; (; : &quot;go-on&quot;; : &quot;Wúyīn&quot;) readings were loaned, and it is accepted that these readings would have been loaned from the language variety of medieval Jiankang.

====Second Golden Age====
One prominent historical speaker of the medieval Wu language was Emperor Yangdi of the Sui dynasty and his Empress Xiao. Emperor Xuan of Western Liang, a member of Emperor Wu of Liang&#x27;s court, was Empress Xiao&#x27;s grandfather and he most likely learned Wu at Jiankang. It is also noted in the preface of the Qieyun, a Sui dynasty rime dictionary, that the speech of Wu, as well as that of Chu, is &quot;at times too soft and light&quot;. A &quot;ballad–narrative&quot; () known as &quot;The Story of Xue Rengui Crossing the Sea and Pacifying Liao&quot; (), which is about the Tang dynasty hero Xue Rengui, is believed to have been written in the Suzhounese. After the An Lushan rebellion, significant migration into the northern Wu-speaking areas occurred, which some believe created the north-south geographical divide we see today. , a variety of Oujiang Wu, was first recorded during the Song dynasty. Yongjianese is the variety in which the &quot;&quot; () by (, 1200-1285) is written. This treaty of calligraphy was published in 1320.

After the Jingkang incident, the imperial capital of the Song dynasty was moved from Bianjing (modern-day Kaifeng) to Lin&#x27;an (Hangzhou), starting the Southern Song period. This also coincided with a large migration wave mostly from the Heluo region, a strip of the Central Plains south of the Yellow River that roughly stretches from Luoyang to Kaifeng, which also brought a language that was not only phonologically and lexically different to the Wu Chinese of the time, but was syntactically and morphologically distinct as well. This Old Mandarin influence manifested in the form of the modern literary layer, as it was also the court language of the time. Coblin believes that this literary layer is also the origin of Huai Chinese.

===Late dynastic &amp; post-dynastic Wu===

Unlike the previous periods, the history of Wu Chinese after the Mongol conquest of China becomes a lot clearer, due to the emergence of vernacular texts.

====Yuan dynasty====

Following the Mongol conquest of China, a period of relative stability followed, and vernacularism started being further embraced. This is evident in the fact that Chinese opera productions, including those of both the Northern and Southern Wu-speaking regions, started using their local varieties rather than Classical Chinese, as was the norm during and before the Song dynasty.

The &quot;Tō-on&quot; (; : &quot;tō-on&quot;; : &quot;Tángyīn&quot;) pronunciations introduced during the Japanese Kamakura period were largely rooted in the vernacular of northern Zhejiang at around the end of the Song dynasty or start of the Yuan dynasty, despite what its name may suggest. Analyses on texts of the time reveal stark phonetic differences between the Wu of today and that of the 13th century.

====Ming dynasty====
The Ming dynasty saw continued development of local operas, such as Suzhou pingtan, and more vernacular texts being written. In particular, the contemporary Classic Chinese Novels, such as &quot;Water Margin&quot;, are believed to have significant lexical and syntactic influence from Hangzhounese.

The Yuan-Ming transition saw a tremendous loss of life in the Jianghuai area due to events such as the Red Turban Rebellions. The Hongwu Emperor ordered for people from Jiangnan, primarily in Suzhou, Songjiang, Jiaxing, Hangzhou, and other Northern Wu-speaking areas, to resettle the now depopulated areas in modern central Jiangsu. More migration happened several decades later to avoid &quot;wokou&quot; pirates. These migrations are believed to have contributed to the Wu-like features in western Huai Chinese groups, such as Tongtai.

Dialectal differences were not as obvious in textual sources until Ming times, and thus regional linguistic distinctions were only seen in media after the fall of the Yuan. These differences are largely found in musical sources such as historical folk songs and &quot;tanci&quot; (a kind of ballad or lyric poem). For instance, the &quot;Shange&quot; (), a collection of folk songs gathered during the Ming dynasty by Feng Menglong in southern Jiangsu and northern Zhejiang, where Northern Wu is today spoken, shows clear signs of modern Wu Chinese in its lexicon. Other Ming documents that are either written in Wu or contain parts where Wu is used include:

* &quot;Sanyan&quot; (), a trilogy of collected stories also compiled by Feng Menglong
* &quot;Erpai&quot; (), two short story collections by Ling Mengchu
* &quot;Xingshiyan&quot; (), a novella recorded by Lu Renlong ()
* &quot;Huanshaji&quot; (), an opera by Liang Chenyu ()
* &quot;Mo Hanzhai Dingben Chuanqi&quot; (), by Feng Menglong
* &quot;Guzhang Juechen&quot; (), a late Ming novel collection
* &quot;Bozhonglian&quot; (), written by an unknown author

These works contain a small handful of unique grammatical features, some of which are not found in contemporary Mandarin, Classical Chinese, or in contemporary Wu varieties. They do contain many of the unique features in its vocabulary present in contemporary Wu, such as pronouns, but clearly indicate that not all of the earlier unique features of these Wu varieties were carried into present varieties. These works also possess a number of characters uniquely formed to express features not found in the classical language and used some common characters as phonetic loans (see Chinese character classification) to express other uniquely Wu vocabulary.

A 16th century text called the &quot;Wenqiji&quot; () includes a chapter called &quot;Gedi Xiangyin&quot; () that records the local pronunciations of terms in various areas. Unlike the &quot;Qieyun&quot; preface, it separates the early Southwestern Mandarin of Huguang, ie. that of Chu, from Wu Chinese. The chapter records typical features of modern Wu, such as:
* the coda in the term ()
* the loss of the final glide in terms such as ()
* the apical rime &quot;-yu&quot; (Wugniu) ()
* the voicing (potentially even the breathy voice or &quot;murmur&quot; that Northern Wu is famous for) of historically voiced initials (, , etc.)

====Qing dynasty and Republican China====
Texts in the early Qing dynasty remained much the same as that of the Ming dynasty. Works of the time include the &quot;Qingzhongpu&quot; () and &quot;Doupeng xianhua&quot; (), an early Qing &quot;baihua&quot; novel. During the 18th century, significant lexical shifts away from that seen in &quot;Shange&quot; took place; many sources we have of the period are operatic in nature. Representative works from this section include the operas (especially &quot;kunqu&quot; operas) by Qian Decang () in the collection &quot;Zhuibaiqiu&quot; (), and the legends written by or what are known as &quot;Shenshi Sizhong&quot; (), as well as huge numbers of &quot;tanci&quot; () ballads.

From the late Qing period to Republican China (the 19th and early 20th centuries), long-form vernacular novels ( or ) such as &quot;The Sing-song Girls of Shanghai&quot; () and &quot;The Nine-tailed Turtle&quot; () started appearing. Both above examples are pornographic in nature. Other works include:

* &quot;Haitian Hongxue Ji&quot; ()
* &quot;The Nine-tailed Fox&quot; ()
* &quot;Officialdom Unmasked&quot; ()
* &quot;Wuge Jiaji&quot; ()
* &quot;He Dian&quot; ()

Wu-speaking writers who wrote in vernacular Mandarin often left traces of their native varieties in their works, as can be found in &quot;Guanchang Xianxing Ji&quot; and &quot;Fubao Xiantan&quot; (). Works in this period also saw an explosion of new vocabulary in Wu varieties to describe their changing world. This clearly reflects the great social changes which were occurring during the time.

At the same time, missionary Joseph Edkins gathered large amounts of data and published several educational works on Shanghainese, as well as Bibles in a few major Wu varieties, including Southern Wu varieties such as Jinhuanese and Wenzhounese.

Following the Taiping Rebellion, many migrants from Mandarin-speaking areas migrated into the Wu-speaking area. Xuanzhou Wu therefore significantly receded, which is reflected in the fact that it is now only spoken in the mountainous highlands of southern Anhui. Some territorial changes and stratification occurred, primarily near the Yangtze River. The newly-arrived Huai Chinese varieties have been slowly overtaking the suburban and rural Wu varieties. For instance, in Lishui county, Nanjing prefecture, the Huai variety was confined inside the town itself until the 1960s; at present, it is overtaking the Wu variety even in rural areas.

Several important proponents of vernacular Chinese in official use, such as Lu Xun and Chao Yuen Ren, were speakers of Northern Wu varieties, in this case Shaoxingese and Changzhounese respectively. Wenzhounese was used during the Second World War to avoid Japanese interception.

====Wu post-1949====
After the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the strong promotion of Mandarin in the Wu-speaking region yet again influenced the development of Wu Chinese. Curiously, Wenzhounese was used again during the Vietnam War to avoid enemy comprehensibility. Wu varieties were gradually excluded from most modern media and schools. With the influx of a migrant non-Wu-speaking population, the near total conversion of public media and organizations to the exclusive use of Mandarin as well as certain Mandarin promotion measures, promotion and regularization of Wu languages became improbable and left them more prone to Mandarinization. In 1992, students in Shanghai were banned from speaking Shanghainese at all times on campuses. As of now, Wu has no official status, no legal protection and there is no officially sanctioned romanization.

It is not uncommon to encounter children who grew up with a regional variant of Mandarin as their parent tongue with little or no fluency in a Wu variety at all. This led to a step up in the preservation and documentation of Wu Chinese, with the first major attempt being the &quot;Linguistic Atlas of Chinese Dialects&quot;, which surveyed 2,791 locations across the nation, including 121 Wu locations (an increase from the two locations in PKU&#x27;s earlier surveys). This also led to the formation of an elaborate database including digital recordings of all locations, however, this database is not available to the general public. The atlas&#x27;s editor, Cao Zhiyun, considers many of these languages &quot;endangered&quot; and has introduced the term (&#x27;languages in danger&#x27; or &#x27;endangered local languages&#x27;) to raise people&#x27;s attention to the issue, although major international databases, such as &quot;Glottolog&quot; and &quot;Ethnologue&quot;, do not share similar sentiments.

Although more TV programs are appearing in Wu varieties, they are no longer permitted to air during primetime. They are generally more playful than serious and many of these shows, such as Hangzhou&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (&quot;Old Liutou tells you the news&quot;), provide local or regional news in the variety, but most are limited to fifteen minutes of airtime. Popular video sites such as Youku and Tudou also host a variety of user-uploaded audio and visual media in many Wu varieties, most of which are regional TV shows, although some are user-created songs and the like. A number of books are also appearing to teach people how to speak Wu varieties such as Suzhounese and Shanghainese, the latter of which even having international titles.

Today, popular support for the preservation of Wu languages is very strong, while feature-length movies such as &quot;B for Busy&quot; and highly successful TV shows such as &quot;Blossoms Shanghai&quot; have been filmed in Wu varieties (in both aforementioned cases, Shanghainese). It is now not uncommon to see advertisements and billboards, as well as government media, using Wu Chinese written in non-&quot;ad hoc&quot; orthographies.

==Classification==

Wu&#x27;s place within the greater scope of Sinitic languages is less easily typified than prototypically northern Chinese varieties such as Mandarin or prototypically southern Chinese varieties such as Cantonese. Its original classification, along with the other Sinitic varieties, was established in 1937 by Li Fang-Kuei, whose boundaries more or less have remained the same, and were adopted by Yuan Jiahua in his influential 1961 dialect primer. These limits were also adopted by Chao Yuen Ren, and he even further created a potential proto-system for Wu using the several varieties included in these boundaries. A similar attempt was attempted by William L. Ballard, though with significantly fewer localities and a heavy skew towards the North.

The sole basis of Li Rong&#x27;s classification was the evolution of Qieyun system voiced stops. This was also Chao&#x27;s only &quot;necessary and sufficient&quot; requirement for a variety to be Wu. This definition is problematic considering the devoicing process has occurred in many Southern Wu varieties and in Northern Wu varieties situated near Huai Chinese. It furthermore would place unrelated varieties such as Old Xiang in this category, and also includes Hangzhounese despite its linguistically complex situation. Therefore, more elaborate systems have developed, but they still mostly delineate the same regions. Regardless of the justification, the Wu region has been clearly outlined, and Li&#x27;s boundary in some ways has remained the de facto standard.

In Jerry Norman&#x27;s usage, Wu dialects can be considered &quot;central dialects&quot; or dialects that are clearly in a transition zone containing features that typify both northern and southern Chinese varieties.

Dialectologists traditionally establish linguistic boundaries based on several overlapping isoglosses of linguistic features. One of the critical historical factors for these boundaries lies in the movement of the population of speakers. This is often determined by the administrative boundaries established during imperial times. As such, imperial boundaries are essential for delineating one variety from another, and many varieties&#x27; isogloss clusters line up perfectly with the county boundaries established in imperial times, although some counties contain more than one variety and others may span several counties. Another factor that influences movement and transportation, as well as the establishment of administrative boundaries, is geography. Northernmost Zhejiang and Jiangsu are very flat—being in the middle of a river delta, and as such are more uniform than the more mountainous regions farther south towards Fujian. The Taihu varieties, like Mandarin in the flat northern plains, are more homogeneous than Southern Wu, which has a significantly greater diversity of linguistic forms, likely a direct result of the geography. Coastal varieties also share more featural affinities, likely because the East China Sea provides a means of transportation. The same phenomenon can be seen with Min varieties.

It has also been noted that Huizhou Chinese and the Tongtai branch of Huai Chinese share significant similarities with Wu Chinese.

===Wu subgroups===
Wu is divided into two major groups: Northern Wu () and Southern Wu (), which are not mutually intelligible. Individual words spoken in isolation may be comprehensible among these speakers, but the flowing discourse of everyday life mostly is not. Another lesser group, Western Wu, is synonymous with the Xuanzhou division, which not only has a larger influence from the surrounding Mandarin varieties than much of Northern Wu, but also has very unique phonetic innovations, making it typologically quite different to the rest of Wu. Southern Wu is well known among linguists and sinologists as being one of the most internally diverse among the Sinitic groups, with very little mutual intelligibility between varieties across subgroups.

In the first edition of Li&#x27;s &quot;Language Atlas of China&quot;, Wu was divided into six groups ():

*Taihu () (ie. varieties around Lake Tai): Spoken in southern Jiangsu and northern Zhejiang provinces, namely in Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, eastern Nantong, Jiaxing, most of Huzhou, most of Hangzhou, Shaoxing, most of Ningbo, and Zhoushan prefectures, Shanghai municipality, as well as parts of Zhenjiang, Taizhou, and Nanjing prefectures in Jiangsu. This group makes up the largest population among all Wu speakers. The local varieties of this region are mostly mutually intelligible among each other. This group is also often referred to as Northern Wu (), as well as Yunhe Wu (). The &quot;Atlas&quot; further divides this group into the following subgroups ():
** Suhujia (), referring to Suzhou, Shanghai, and Jiaxing.
** Piling ()
** Tiaoxi or Shaoxi (), referring to Huzhou
** Hangzhou (), which only includes Hangzhounese
** Linshao (), referring to Lin&#x27;an and Shaoxing
** Yongjiang (), referring to Ningbo
*Taizhou (): A pluricentric variety, spoken in and around Taizhou prefecture, Zhejiang. Taizhounese, as it is also called, is the closest to Northern Wu among the Southern varieties.
*Oujiang (): Spoken in and around the Wenzhou prefecture, Zhejiang. This variety is the very distinctive and is both internally and externally highly mutually unintelligible. Some dialectologists even treat it as a variety separate from the rest of Wu by using the monosyllable &quot;Ou&quot;, the abbreviated form of Wenzhou, suffixed with the term &quot;language&quot;, hence Ou Chinese (). It is also dubbed Dong&#x27;ou () by Zhengzhang Shangfang.
*Wuzhou (): Spoken in and around Jinhua prefecture, Zhejiang.
*Chu–Qu (): Spoken in and around Lishui and Quzhou prefectures in Zhejiang as well as in eastern parts of Shangrao prefecture in Jiangxi. It is further subdivided into Longqu () and Chuzhou () subbranches in the &quot;Atlas&quot;.
*Xuanzhou (): spoken in the linguistically highly diverse southern parts of Anhui province, as well as in Gaochun and Lishui counties, Nanjing prefecture. The &quot;Atlas&quot; divides the branch into Taigao (), Tongjing (), and Shiling () subbranches.

Cao Zhiyun rearranged some of the Southern Wu divisions based on a larger corpus of data. According to Cao, it can be divided into three broad divisions:

* Jinqu (), which contains much of Jinhua prefecture, eastern parts of Quzhou prefecture (including Quzhou itself), and Jinyun county in Lishui prefecture
* Shangli (), which has two subdivisions:
**Shangshan (), which contains the Wu-speaking parts of Shangrao prefecture and western Quzhou prefecture
**Lishui (), which contains much of Lishui prefecture, Taishun county in Wenzhou prefecture, and Pucheng county in Nanping prefecture, Fujian
* Oujiang (), which contains the remaining parts of Wenzhou prefecture (excluding the Min-speaking regions of Pingyang and Cangnan counties).

Taizhounese remained unchanged as it was not included in the study. This was later adopted by the second edition of Li&#x27;s &quot;Atlas&quot;. Minor adjustments were also made regarding Northern Wu subdivisions.

==Phonology==
Wu varieties typically possess a larger phonological inventory than many Sinitic languages. Many varieties also have tone systems known for highly complex tone sandhi. Phonologies of Wu varieties are diverse and hard to generalize. As such, only typologically significant features will be discussed here. For more information, refer to individual varieties&#x27; pages.

In terms of consonants, those in initial positions are more plentiful than those in finals. Finals typically only permit two consonant phonemes, a singular nasal and a glottal stop. Some varieties however, may deviate from this and have features such as the addition of , or the omission of the glottal stop. Wu varieties typically preserve Qieyun system voiced initials (, , , , , etc.) though some varieties have lost this feature. Implosives are also occasionally found in Wu varieties, primarily in suburban Shanghainese varieties, as well as in .

Wu languages have typologically high numbers of vowels and are on par with Germanic languages in having the largest vowel quality inventories in the world. The Jinhui variety, spoken in Shanghai&#x27;s Fengxian District, can be analyzed to have 20 vowel qualities. The abnormal number of vowels in Wu is due in part to rimes ending in glottal stops may be analysed as a short vowel in many varieties, as well as 
unique sound shifts, such as the tensing of Qieyun system &quot;shan&quot; () and &quot;xian&quot; () rimes, among other factors.

Both breathy and creaky voice are also found in Wu varieties. Breathy voice appears in Northern Wu and may act as a depressor that lowers the pitch of the entire syllable&#x27;s realization. Creaky voice, on the other hand, is found in Taizhounese, and is associated with the rising tone category ().

Xuanzhou Wu is phonologically very unique and has a host of complex syllables, such as:
* (Yanchi township, Xuancheng prefecture )
* (Jingxian )

===Tones===
Wu varieties typically have 7-8 tonemes though varieties may have as many as 12 tones or as few as 5. Many merge the historical light rising category () with the light departing (). The reflexes of the checked tone categories () may be complex. Jinhuanese irregularly merge it with other tone categories, while Wenzhounese has lengthened tone contours rather than the typological norm of short, contourless tones.

Tone sandhi in Sinitic languages can occur due to phonological, syntactic, or morphological reasons, though most varieties only employ it to a limited extent. This stands in stark contrast with Wu, in which all three can trigger tone sandhi. Examples of situations that can trigger unique tone sandhi chains include (but are not limited to):

* Polysyllabic terms
:: (Shanghainese)
* Verb-object compounds
:: (Suzhounese)
* Verb-complementizer compounds
:: (Hangzhounese)
* Particles such as aspect markers or sentence final particles
:: (Shaoxingese)
* Numeral-classifier compounds
:: (Chongmingese)
* Reduplication
* Contractions and ellipsis
* Specification
* &quot;Erhua&quot;
:: (Jinhuanese)

The relevant changed tone is highlighted in bold.

Tone sandhi in Sinitic languages can typically be classified as left- or right-dominant systems, depending on whether the leftmost or rightmost item keeps its tone. Both systems exist in Wu Chinese, with most varieties having both concurrently. Right-dominant is more associated with changes in part of speech, whereas left-dominant is typically seen in polysyllabic terms. Minimal pairs between types of sandhi also exist, such as and in , or and in Chongmingese.

==Grammar==
Wu languages&#x27; grammar is largely similar to that of Standard Chinese, though they do diverge in quite striking ways, such as in verb-object-complementizer phrases. Since differences exist between varieties, only general trends will be included below.

===Syntax===
Much like other Chinese languages, Wu languages have classifiers, primarily mark verbs by aspect (though it has been suggested that there is some evidence of tenses in Old Shanghainese), have a great number of particles (including sentence-final particles), possess SVO word order with topic-fronting.

Topic-fronting is more common in Northern Wu than in most other Sinitic languages. It is commonly seen in closed questions, in which the topic is dislocated in order to avoid confusion.

Word order at times differs between Wu and other Chinese varieties. In the aforementioned verb-object-complementizer (VOC) phrases, VOC is common in Wu whereas VCO is dominant in Mandarin.

Similarly, ditransitive constructions typically see the direct object placed in front of the indirect object, whereas the opposite is true for Mandarin varieties.

The verb &quot;to give&quot;, is a checked tone variant of and is commonly found in Wu languages. It is also used to mark the passive voice.

Reduplication is common, and many varieties make greater use of it than Standard Chinese. For instance, verbal reduplication can be used to indicate the imperative mood, as well as the perfect aspect.

Elision of the negation particle in closed question constructions is also common in Northern Wu but ungrammatical in Standard Chinese. In some varieties, this triggers its own tone sandhi patterns.

 in the above sentence is pronounced rather than the expected left-prominent pattern, which would be .

===Morphology===
Much like other Chinese languages, Wu languages are analytic, lack inflection, and most morphemes are monosyllabic. Words in Wu are typically polysyllabic &quot;ciyu&quot; (), which are composed of multiple morphemes. Common bound morphemes include:

* : ; &quot;aq-ng&quot; (Shanghainese); ; &quot;aq-fi&quot; (); ; &quot;a-yi&quot; (Wenzhounese)
* : ; &quot;biq-dei&quot; (Changzhounese), ; &quot;nga-deu&quot; (Shaoxingese); ; &quot;ciuan-tieu&quot; (Jinhuanese)
* : ; &quot;kau-tsy&quot; (), ; &quot;tsho-tsy&quot; ()

:* , the checked tone variant of : ; &quot;ngo-shiuq-tseq&quot; (); ; &quot;shoe-tseq&quot; ()

* : ; &quot;than-ng&quot; (Quzhounese), ; &quot;ken&quot; ()

AAB adjectival reduplication, where it has an intensive meaning as seen in terms such as , , is more common in Wu than Standard Chinese.

==Vocabulary==
&quot;For more terms, refer to the .&quot;

Wu Chinese varieties share a number of lexical innovations and retentions, though it does also have a considerable number of loanwords from Old Mandarin via the literary layer from the Southern Song dynasty.

Wu Chinese common shared lexica include:
* Personal pronouns, namely those cognate with and , as well as 
* A large number of grammatical particles derived from , such as the possessive, demonstratives, and certain adverbs (eg. &#x27;so, such&#x27;)
* A fricative-initial negator, ie. /
* Substrate words, such as , , 
* and 
* Kinship terminology such as , 
* Basic verbs such as , , 

Many of the above are also exhibited in Hangzhounese.

Old Mandarin loanwords are often geographically distributed along trade routes out of Hangzhou. Such terms include:
* (cf. native )
* (cf. native )
* (cf. native )

===Western loanwords===
Due to foreign influence in the port of Shanghai, Wu varieties, especially in the North, gained a number of loanwords from languages such as English and French through Chinese Pidgin English. Some of these loanwords even entered mainstream Chinese, and thus can also be found in other Chinese languages. Such loanwords include:

* ; &quot;sy-men-thin&quot;, from English &quot;cement&quot;
* ; &quot;we-sy&quot;, from English &quot;waste&quot;
* ; &quot;aq-la-ka&quot;, from French &quot;à la carte&quot;
* ; &quot;ve-zy-lin&quot;, from English &quot;vaseline&quot;
* ; &quot;aon-se&quot;, from English &quot;on sale&quot;

Terms above provided in Shanghainese.

===Literary and colloquial pronunciations===
Wu, like other Chinese languages, have literary and colloquial readings of many characters. The literary layer was brought to the region during the Southern Song dynasty when the imperial court was moved to Lin&#x27;an, today Hangzhou. Common features of literary sound changes include:
* Palatalization of dorsals
:* : , (Ningbonese)
:* : , ()
* Lowering of high back rounded vowels
:* : , (Tiantainese)
* Frication of historical &quot;ri&quot;-initial () syllables
:* : , (Chuanshanese)
:* : , (Jinhuanese)

Words do not necessarily have to use only literary or only colloquial pronunciations, eg. ; &quot;da-ghoq&quot; (Shanghainese): &quot;da&quot; is literary, whereas &quot;ghoq&quot; is colloquial.

==Orthography==
Wu Chinese is primarily written in Sinographs. Due to most speakers being located within the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Simplified Chinese characters are often used. Phonetic matching is often used due to the lack of knowledge regarding the etymologies of many terms, though texts such as the &quot;Great Dictionary of Shanghainese&quot; () serve as &quot;de facto&quot; recommended standardized forms, as is seen in government media.

===Romanization===

Wu Chinese does not have any government-recognized romanization system. Adapted forms of Hanyu Pinyin are commonly seen due to the relative familiarity of the system among the Wu Chinese speakerbase. Online communities such as Wu-Chinese and Wugniu have created pluricentric romanization systems, largely based on 19th and 20th century Western textual sources.

==Literature==
The genres of &quot;kunqu&quot; opera and &quot;tanci&quot; song, appearing in the Ming dynasty, were the first instances of the use of Wu dialect in literature. By the turn of the 20th century it was used in several novels that had prostitution as a subject. In many of these novels, Wu is mainly used as dialogue of prostitute characters. In one work, &quot;Shanghai Flowers&quot; by Han Bangqing, all of the dialogue is in Wu. Wu originally developed in genres related to oral performance. It was used in manners related to oral performance when it proliferated in written literature and it was widely used in fiction about prostitutes, a particular genre, and not in other genres. Donald B. Snow, author of &quot;Cantonese as Written Language: The Growth of a Written Chinese Vernacular&quot;, compared the development of Wu in this manner to the patterns of Baihua and Japanese vernacular writing.

According to Jean Duval, author of &quot;The Nine-Tailed Turtle: Pornography or &#x27;fiction of exposure&quot;, at the time &quot;The Nine-tailed Turtle&quot; by () was published, it was one of the most popular novels written in the Wu dialect. &quot;Magnificent Dreams in Shanghai&quot; () by Sun Jiazhen () was another example of a prostitute novel with Wu dialogue from the turn of the 20th century.

Snow wrote that Wu literature &quot;achieved a certain degree of prominence&quot; by 1910. After 1910 there had been no novels which were as popular as &quot;The Nine-tailed Turtle&quot; or the critical acclaim garnered by &quot;Shanghai Flowers&quot;. In the popular fiction of the early 20th century the usage of Wu remained in use in prostitute dialogue but, as asserted by Snow, &quot;apparently&quot; did not extend beyond that. In 1926 Hu Shih stated that of all of the Chinese dialects, within literature, Wu had the brightest future. Snow concluded that instead Wu dialect writing became &quot;a transient phenomenon that died out not long after its growth gathered steam.&quot;

Snow argued that the primary reason was the increase of prestige and importance in Baihua, and that one other contributing reason was changing market factors since Shanghai&#x27;s publishing industry, which grew, served all of China and not just Shanghai. Duval argued that many Chinese critics had a low opinion of Wu works, mainly originating from the eroticism within them, and that contributed to the decline in Wu literature.

<text>Waterloo County was a county in Canada West in the United Province of Canada from 1853 until 1867, then in the Canadian province of Ontario from 1867 until 1973. It was the direct predecessor of the Regional Municipality of Waterloo.

Situated on a subset of land within the Haldimand Tract, Waterloo County consisted of five townships: Woolwich, Wellesley, Wilmot, Waterloo, and North Dumfries. The major population centres were Waterloo, Kitchener (known as Berlin prior to 1916), Preston, Hespeler, Blair, and Doon in Waterloo township; Galt in North Dumfries; Elmira in Woolwich; and New Hamburg in Wilmot. All are now part of the Regional Municipality.

==History==
===Background===

Waterloo County was once one of the most densely wooded sections in North America. Oak trees three to four feet in diameter, maple, beech, elm, ash oak and great pines were common. The county, located in the northerly edge of Attawandaron land, was excellent for hunting and fishing.

===Haldimand Proclamation (1784–1800)===

In 1784, by way of the Haldimand Proclamation, the British Government granted the Grand River valley to Iroquois confederation refugees from central and western New York State, indigenous peoples who served as allies during the American Revolution. The area was from Lake Erie to the Elora falls, and the width being six miles on each side of the river. The First Nations soon offered almost half of the upper area for sale. It was divided into four blocks. Blocks 1, 2 and 3 were sold by 1816; this large area became the townships of Waterloo, Woolwich and Dumfries.

The western part of this area was initially settled by Mennonites of German extraction from Pennsylvania; most settled the area that would become Kitchener, St. Jacobs, Elmira and surroundings. The southern part (now Cambridge) – as well as areas that would become Fergus and Elora, just outside Waterloo County – were settled by Scots. Except for grist, woolen and saw mills, there was little industry in any of these area until about 1870.

===Early arrivals from Pennsylvania (1800–1819)===

Settlement of the what later became the Township of Waterloo started in 1800 (in an area that is now a part of Kitchener) by Joseph Schoerg (later called Sherk) and Samuel Betzner, Jr. (brothers-in-law), Mennonites, from Franklin County, Pennsylvania. At the time, the upper part of the Grand River Valley was considered deep in the wilderness, and was difficult to penetrate into with wagons due a lack of roads. One Waterloo County historian, W. H. Breithaupt, believed that Schoerg and Betzner, after arriving in Upper Canada, travelled from Ancaster westward through Beverley Township to a point on the Grand River near where Paris would later be founded, using a road cut through the wilderness the previous year by two Englishmen named Ward and Smith. They then followed the Grand River northward. Joseph Schoerg and his wife settled on Lot 11, B.F. Beasley Block, S.R., on the bank of the Grand River opposite Doon, and Betzner and his wife settled on the west bank of the Grand, on a farm near what would become the village of Blair. 

The homes built by the next generation of these families still stand as of March 2021, on what is now Pioneer Tower Road in Kitchener, and have been listed as historically important; the John Betzner homestead (restored) and the David Schoerg farmstead (not yet restored) were erected circa 1830.

The German Company, represented by Daniel Erb and Samuel Bricker, had gotten into financial difficulties after buying the land in 1796 from Joseph Brant who represented the Six Nations. The payment to Beasly, in cash, arrived from Pennsylvania in kegs, carried in a wagon surrounded by armed guards.

Other settlers followed mostly from Pennsylvania typically by Conestoga wagons. 
Many of the pioneers arriving from Pennsylvania after November 1803 bought land in a section of Block Two from the German Company from Richard Beasley who had acquired a massive territory. The tract had originally been purchased from the Six Nations Indians by the British Crown in 1784; it was acquired in 1798 by Richard Beasley and two partners who decided to resell land, in smaller parcels. The Tract included most of Block 2 of the previous Grand River Indian Lands. Many of the first farms were least four hundred acres in size. 

At this time, many Mississauga people still frequented the area. Recorded history documents that the relationship between the Mississaugas and early settlers could sometimes be strained. In one case, a John Erb (likely the same John Erb who built the first mills at Preston) was shot and wounded by a Mississauga man in Haldimand County in 1804. Ezra E. Eby, whose history of Waterloo Township was based on oral family histories of early settlers as well as written history, highlights positive social relationships between early settlers and indigenous people, describing frequent trade between them, that settlers&#x27; children and indigenous children would play together, and that indigenous people would sometimes stay overnight in settlers&#x27; houses. However, in one surviving document from the period, a group of settlers in &quot;Beasley&#x27;s Township&quot; (the name used before Waterloo Township was adopted) petitioned the Upper Canada legislature in 1808 to ban the sale of spirits to indigenous people, citing social disorder and &quot;bad behaviour&quot; including the shooting of another settler. Another, later historian, Angus S. Bauman, points out in his own history that Ezra Eby may have been aware of these incidents, highlighting Eby&#x27;s comment that &quot;[i]n those early times the Indians were very numerous and if kindly treated would never injure anyone,&quot; noting that &quot;perhaps these men did inadvertently displease the Indians.&quot;

The majority of the settlers of the Lower Block along the Grand River (including areas such as the current Freeport and Hespeler) were also Mennonites from Pennsylvania often called Pennsylvania Dutch although they were actually Deutsch or Deitsch, German. Others immigrated from the British Isles and directly from Germany, producing a mix of cultures.

The first school opened in 1802 near the village of Blair, then known as Shinglebridge and now part of Cambridge, Ontario. The first teacher&#x27;s name was Mr. Rittenhaus. 

By the early 1800s, a corduroy road had been built along what is now King Street in Waterloo; its remains were unearthed in 2016. The road was probably built by Mennonites using technology acquired in Lancaster County Pennsylvania, between the late 1790s and 1816. The log road was buried in about 1840 and a new road built on top of it. A historian explained that the road had been built for access to the mill but was also &quot;one of the first roads cut through (the woods) so people could start settling the area&quot;.

Later declared the founder of the city of Waterloo, Abraham Erb, a German Mennonite from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, bought 900 acres of bush land in 1806 from the German Company; (this would later be part of Waterloo Township). He built a sawmill in 1808 and a gristmill in 1816; the latter operated continuously for 111 years. Other early settlers of what would become Waterloo included Samuel and Elia Schneider who arrived in 1816. Until about 1820, settlements such as this were quite small.

By 1804, the cemetery in the village of Blair (now part of Cambridge) was already in use. The next cemetery to be started is the one next to Pioneer Tower in Doon; the first recorded burial at that location was in 1806. The cemetery at First Mennonite church at 800 King St. East in Kitchener is not as old, but contains the graves of some notable citizens, including Bishop Benjamin Eby who died in 1853, Joseph Schneider, and Rev. Joseph Cramer, founder of the House of Friendship social service agency.

In 1807, of Block 3 (Woolwich) was purchased by Pennsylvanians John Erb, Jacob Erb and others.

Later named the founder of Kitchener, Benjamin Eby (made Mennonite preacher 1809, and bishop in 1812) arrived from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania in 1806 and purchased a very large tract of land consisting of much of what would become the village of Berlin (named about 1830). The settlement was initially called Ebytown and was at the south-east side of what would later become Queen Street. (Eby was also responsible for the growth of the Mennonite church in Waterloo County; he built the first church in 1813.) Abram Weber settled on the corner of what would become King and Wilmot Streets and David Weber in the area of the much later Grand Trunk Railway station. Benjamin Eby encouraged manufacturers to move to the village. Jacob Hoffman came in 1829 or 1830 and started the first furniture factory. 

Almost as important as Benjamin Eby in the history of Kitchener, Joseph Schneider of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania (son of immigrants from southern Germany) bought lot 17 of the German Company Tract of block 2 in 1806. While farming, he helped to build what became &quot;Schneider&#x27;s Road&quot; and by 1816 built a sawmill. Years later, Schneider and Phineas Varnum would help form the commercial centre of Ebytown.

The War of 1812 interrupted settlement. The Mennonite settlers refused to carry arms so were employed in non-combatant roles in camps and hospital and as teamsters in transport service during the war.

William Dickson of Niagara purchased land in the township of North Dumfries and South Dumfries. With his land agent, Absolom Shade, he located a town site on the Grand River. Settlers were attracted, largely from Scotland with the price of land being about four dollars an acre. Years later (1827), this village would be named Galt for John Galt, the British author and then Superintendent of the Canada Company headquartered in Guelph. Galt was a friend of William Dickson.

===Rural development (1819–1852)===

During and shortly after the War of 1812, government expenditures on roads increased dramatically, leading to the improvement and extension of a number of roads in Upper Canada. By 1819, a new road had been constructed, which ran diagonally across Beverley Township from Dundas to Galt. The new road gave pioneers in Dumfries Township (and by extension, Waterloo Township) a direct route to urban centres near Lake Ontario, although it was over a difficult track which passed through many swamps. This &quot;Beverley Road&quot; was the predecessor to the later . Before commercial mills were constructed in the Waterloo area, settlers had to bring their grain in wagons along the road to Dundas to be milled. By the 1830s, the government had adopted a new strategy: the creation of toll roads maintained by private companies. The first such company, incorporated in 1829, was the Dundas and Waterloo Turnpike Company. It had a capitalization of CA£25,000, almost double the government&#x27;s expenditure on roads the following year, and was committed to improve and maintain the Galt–Dundas road to a width of . Despite these funds, the company struggled financially, and a debenture of another £25,000 was requested and authorized in 1837. A further £8,000 was authorized two years later, in 1839, for macadamization.

The earliest recorded proposal for a railway in Waterloo County was in January 1836; at the time, no public railways existed in Canada, as the first, the Champlain and St. Lawrence Railroad, was still under construction and would only open later that year. This first proposal was for a long-distance route from Dundas to Goderich, going through Preston. A similar proposal for a &quot;Toronto and Lake Huron Railway&quot; was made in August, which was intended to pass through the townships of Dumfries and Waterloo. However, an economic crisis in 1837 delayed railway development, and it wouldn&#x27;t be until the railway fever of the 1840s that new proposals would emerge.

John Eby, druggist and chemist, arrived from Pennsylvania in about 1820 and opened a shop to the west of what would later be Eby Street. At the time, it was common for settlers to form a building &quot;bee&quot; to help newcomers erect a long home. Immigration from Lancaster county continued heavily in the 1820s because of a severe agricultural depression in Lancaster County. Joseph Schneider also settled in that area and built a frame house in 1820 on the south side of the future Queen Street after clearing a farm and creating a rough road. A small settlement formed around &quot;Schneider&#x27;s Road&quot; which later became the nucleus of Berlin. The home was renovated over a century later and still stands.

The village centre of what would become Berlin (and later, Kitchener) was established in 1830 by Phineas Varnum who leased land from Joseph Schneider and opened a blacksmith shop on the site where a hotel would be built many years later, the Walper House. A tavern was also established here at the same time and a store was opened. At the time, the settlement of Berlin was still considered to be a hamlet.

By 1830 the village of Preston was a thriving business centre with Jacob Hespeler, a native of Württemberg and a prominent citizen. He would later move to the village of New Hope that was renamed Hespeler in 1857 in recognition of his public service and the industries he started there. Jacob Beck from the Grand Duchy of Baden founded the village of Baden in Wilmot Township and started a foundry and machine shop. Jacob Beck was the father of Sir Adam Beck.

The first newspaper of the county (first issue dated August 27, 1835) was the Canada Museum und Allgemeine Zeitung, printed mostly in German and partly in English. It was published for only five years.

The land which now makes up the township of Woolwich, including communities such as St. Jacobs and Elmira, were first settled in the early 1800s. The early settlers were primarily from England or Ireland but after 1830, Mennonites from Pennsylvania formed a significant proportion of the population. The area still retains much of its traditional character. Old Order Mennonites can still be seen on the local roads using their traditional horse and buggy transportation.

By 1835, many immigrants to Waterloo County were not from Pennsylvania. Many settler came from England, Ireland, Scotland and Germany to areas such as New Germany in the Lower Block of Block Two. In 1835, approximately 70% of the population was Mennonite but by 1851, only 26% of the much larger population were of this religion. This was due to the large wave of new German migrants from Europe, particularly between 1830 and 1850.

The Wellington District and Waterloo County were formed in June 1840 from territory transferred from certain other districts:


The district town was Guelph.

Records indicate a population of 13,782 in 1841. The &quot;Smith&#x27;s Canadian Gazetteer&quot; of 1846 states that the Township of Waterloo (smaller than Waterloo County) consisted primarily of Pennsylvanian Mennonites and immigrants directly from Germany who had brought money with them. At the time, many did not speak English. There were eight grist and twenty saw mills in the township. In 1841, the population count was 4424. In 1846 the village of Waterloo had a population of 200, &quot;mostly Germans&quot;. There was a grist mill and a sawmill and some tradesmen. Berlin (Kitchener) had a population of about 400, also &quot;mostly German&quot;, and more tradesmen than the village of Waterloo.

===Reorganization of the county (1852–1853)===
At the beginning of 1852, the County was divided into three, forming the United Counties of Wellington, Waterloo and Grey:


The County of Waterloo was withdrawn from the United Counties in January 1853.

===Urbanization and centralization around Berlin (1853–1894)===

There had been some contentious debate between Galt and Berlin (later, Kitchener) as to where the county seat would be located. At the time, Berlin was a hamlet with a population of only 700, as opposed to Galt&#x27;s population of 2,200. one of the requirements for founding was the construction of a courthouse and jail. When the local Berlin hotelier Friedrich Gaukel donated a small parcel of land he owned (at the current Queen and Weber streets), this secured the county seat for Berlin. The courthouse at the corner of the later Queen Street North and Weber Street and the county gaol were built within a few months. The first county council meeting was held in the new building on 24 January 1853, as the county officially began operations. The new county council included 12 members from the five townships and two villages; Doctor John Scott was appointed as the first warden (reeve). Though the courthouse has since been replaced with a modern structure, the gaol and adjacent governor&#x27;s house remain to this day under historical designation; they have been repurposed for further legal capacities (courtrooms and prosecutors&#x27; offices). In the following years, various County institutions and facilities would be created, including roads and bridges, schools, a House of Industry and Refuge, agricultural societies and local markets.

The Grand Trunk Railway reached Berlin in 1856 and that accelerated the growth of industry. In the next decade factories and the homes of labourers and wealthy owners replaced the early settlers&#x27; log houses. A rail line did not reach St. Jacobs or Elmira until 1891. The Grand Trunk and the Canadian Pacific railways provided useful transportation and as a result, furniture manufacturing and other industries began to open in Elmira.

After about 1850, settlers direct from Germany began arriving to all parts of the county, including Woolwich Township. Waterloo was incorporated as a village in 1857 and became the Town of Waterloo in 1876 and the City of Waterloo in 1948.

The population was 38,750 by 1861. In 1864, there were two grammar schools in the county, at Galt and Berlin, three Roman Catholic Separate Schools in the township of Wellesley, and two others in the township of Wilmot.

By 1871, the largest ethnic groups in the county were Scots (18 per cent of the population), Irish (8 per cent), English (12.6 per cent), and German. At that time, those with German roots (direct from Europe or from Pennsylvania) made up nearly 55 per cent of the population. That was much higher than the 10 percent typical in the rest of Ontario.

The first hospital in Waterloo County opened in 1890 as Galt General Hospital. Additional buildings and facilities were added in the early 1900s. By 1918, the facility had an X-ray room, a 27-room nurses&#x27; residence and was also a nurse training school.

By 1911, there were nearly three times as many Lutherans as Mennonites in that area, for example.

====Nascent urban hierarchy====

In urban studies, a metric called the &quot;functional unit&quot; is sometimes used as a measure for the complexity of a settlement. A functional unit is a measure of a type of economic activity, such as milling, banking, or retailing. A single establishment could contain multiple functional units; one example, common in pioneer settlements, is the general store/post office, which would constitute two functional units. For Waterloo County, statistics on functional units are possible for 1864 onward using contemporary data sources. In 1864, Galt was clearly at the top of the county&#x27;s urban hierarchy, with of all functional units, while Berlin had only . Waterloo, Preston, Ayr, and New Hamburg all followed with between and each; no other community in the county had more than of the county&#x27;s functional units.

By 1871, Galt still held the lead, but several small and mid-sized settlements in the county had dramatically increased in total number of functional units, overtaking others. In particular, New Hamburg, Elmira, and Ayr pulled ahead of Preston, while St. Jacobs and Hespeler more than doubled and tripled respectively. From 1871 to 1881, the county entered an era described by the geographer Fred Dahms as one of &quot;competition and centralization&quot;. Between 1871 and 1881, the rural population decreased while the urban share of total population increased by nearly , despite a total population growth of only . The total number of settlements with functional units increased between 1864 and 1881, reaching an all-time peak of 44, and communities were widely dispersed. The result of this was numerous hamlets with one or two functional units (often a hotel, general store, or smithy) which had developed at road intersections, and a road system which allowed anyone with access to a horse and carriage the easy ability to return from a day trip. Economic functions, however, had already begun to centralize amongst a handful of major settlements.

====House of Industry and Refuge====

In 1869, the County built a large poorhouse with an attached farm, the House of Industry and Refuge that accommodated some 3,200 people before being closed down in 1951; the building was subsequently demolished. It was located on Frederick St. in Kitchener, behind the now Frederick Street Mall and was intended to minimize the number of people begging, living on the streets or being incarcerated at a time before social welfare programmes became available. A 2009 report by the Toronto Star explains that &quot;pauperism was considered a moral failing that could be erased through order and hard work&quot;.

A research project by the Laurier School of Social Work has amassed all available data about the House and its former residents, digitized it and made the archive available on-line at WaterlooHouseOfRefuge.ca. According to Sandy Hoy, a director of research projects, the &quot;inmates&quot; included not only the poor, &quot;but folks with disabilities, women, children. Some were single women who had been servants and became pregnant; in fact, many were single mothers of all types. The archives also indicate that in addition to food and shelter for &quot;inmates&quot;, in return for labour in the house and on the attached farm, the House also donated food, clothing and money for train tickets to enable the poor to reach family that might be able to support them. There were also two cemeteries for the poor nearby, including &quot;inmates&quot; of the House who had died.

===Later railway development (1894–1955)===
====Street railways====


Although railways had arrived in Waterloo County in the 1850s, street railways only arrived several decades later. Urban railways offered a number of advantages to developing communities, but required a serious infrastructure investment which often fell to local municipalities or private businessmen. Street railways tended to lead to the development of the &quot;streetcar strip&quot; – highly developed urban commercial corridors – in contrast with older downtowns, which were usually less linear in form. With King Street already dominant as a linear commercial corridor, it was natural that early street railway development would connect two of the county&#x27;s urban centres (Berlin and Waterloo) along this established route. This came about in 1888 in the form of the Berlin and Waterloo Street Railway. It initially started operations with horsecar service before later owners electrified the line and began using electric streetcars.

The next street railway system to be constructed in the county was the Galt and Preston Street Railway in 1894, which, similarly to the Berlin and Waterloo, connected the existing urban centres of Galt and Preston. It soon became the Galt, Preston and Hespeler Street Railway after a branch line was built which connected Preston and Hespeler along the east bank of the Speed River. This system hosted not just passengers and mail, but also full carload freight. In 1904, the railway&#x27;s Galt–Preston mainline was effectively extended with the construction of the Preston and Berlin Street Railway which, despite its name, took on many of the characteristics of an interurban. It featured two new freight yards, one in Berlin and one in Waterloo. These systems were gradually consolidated over several years and by 1914, they were known under the unified name of the Grand River Railway, which dispensed with street railway nomenclature. The Berlin and Waterloo Street Railway, in contrast, never lost its street railway traits and continued to operate similarly in the 20th century under Kitchener Public Utilities Commission management as it had in the 19th century, until its eventual shutdown in 1946.

====Interurban railways====


By the turn of the 20th century, interurban railways had begun to spread throughout North America. These were a natural evolution from street railways, but represented a more substantial commitment to regional rail infrastructure. The Grand River Railway was noted by rail historian John M. Mills as one of the earliest interurbans in Canada, and &quot;for many years one of the most energetic and progressive.&quot; While plans for a northern extension of the mainline never resulted in new construction, a succession of lines provided connections to the south. These were the Grand Valley Railway, built as an extension of the Brantford Street Railway and extended north to Galt in 1903, and the Lake Erie and Northern Railway, a more modern successor to the Grand Valley Railway which opened in 1916.

Taken as a sum, these interurban lines created direct rail connections between Waterloo County, Brant County, and Norfolk County, as well as freight interchange with significant Canadian National Railway, Canadian Pacific Railway, and Michigan Central Railroad lines and intercity stations. In fact, both lines were indirectly controlled by the Canadian Pacific Railway, and starting in 1931, they were managed together as a single entity known as the Canadian Pacific Electric Lines. Ridership on passenger trips declined, and services began to be cut starting in the late 1930s with the cancellation of trips to Waterloo, though the system had a brief swan song in ridership during the Second World War. Regular passenger service ended in 1955. Freight service continued, though the line was extensively relocated to make room for highway expansion in south Kitchener during the 1960s.

== German heritage ==
While German-speaking settlers from Pennsylvania were the most numerous until about 1840, a few Germans from Europe began arriving in as 1819, including Friedrich Gaukel, a hotel keeper, being one of the firsts. He would build what later became the Walper House in Berlin. Two streets in present-day Kitchener, Frederick and Gaukel streets, are named after him. Other German-speaking immigrants from Europe arrived in Waterloo County during the 1830s to 1850s, bringing with them their language, religion and cultural traditions. Waterloo County soon became recognized throughout Canada for their Germanic heritage. The German community became industrial and political leaders, and created a German-Canadian society unlike any other found in Canada at the time. They established German public schools and German language churches.

Both the immigrants from Germany and the Mennonites from Pennsylvania spoke German of course, though with different dialects such as Low German or the incorrectly called Pennsylvania Dutch, actually Pennsilfaanisch &quot;Deitsch&quot; (German). (This dialect is different from Standard German with a simplified grammatical structure, some differences in vocabulary and pronunciation and a greater influence of English.) The combination of various types of German-speaking groups was a notable factor in the history of Waterloo County. The two groups of Germanics were able to understand each other quite easily and there was no apparent conflict between the Germans from Europe and those who came from Pennsylvania.

Some sources estimate that roughly 50,000 Germans directly from Europe settled in a large area of Southern Ontario, in and around Waterloo County, between the 1830s and 1850s. Unlike the predominantly Mennonite settlers from Pennsylvania, the majority of Germans from Europe were of other denominations: most in the first groups were Catholic and those who arrived later were primarily Lutheran.

In 1862, German-speaking groups held The Sängerfest, or &quot;Singer Festival&quot; concert event that attracted an estimated 10,000 people and continued for several years. Eleven years later, 
the over 2000 Germans in Berlin, Ontario started a new event, Friedenfest, commemorating Prussian victory Franco-Prussian war. This annual celebration continued until the start of WWI. In 1897, they raised funds to erect a large monument, with a bronze bust of Kaiser Wilhelm 1, in Victoria Park. (The monument would be destroyed by townspeople just after the start of WWI.)

By 1871, nearly 55 percent of the population had German origins, including both those of Pennsylvania Mennonite and European Germans. This group greatly outnumbered the Scots (18 per cent), the English 
(12.6 per cent) and the Irish (8 per cent). Berlin, Ontario was a bilingual town with German being the dominant language spoken. More than one visitor commented on the necessity of speaking German in Berlin.

Immigration from continental Germany slowed by 1880. First and second-generation descendants now comprised most of the local German population, and while they were proud of their German roots, most considered themselves loyal British subjects. The 1911 Census indicates that of the 15,196 residents in Berlin, Ontario, about 70% were identified as ethnic German but only 8.3% had been born in Germany. By the beginning of the First World War in 1914, Berlin and Waterloo County were still considered to be predominantly German by people across Canada. This would prove to have a profound impact on local citizens during the war years. During the first few months of the war, services an activities at Lutheran churches in Waterloo County continued on as they always had. However, as anti-German sentiment increased throughout Waterloo County, many of the churches decided to stop holding services in German.

By the early 1900s, North Waterloo County (the Kitchener, Waterloo and Woolwich Township areas) exhibited a strong German culture and those of German origin made up a third of the population in 1911, with Lutherans as the primary religious group. The Mennonites at that time primarily resided in the rural areas and small communities.

The governor general of Canada, the Duke of Connaught, while visiting Berlin, Ontario, in May 1914, discussed the importance of Canadians of German ethnicity (regardless of their origin) in a speech: &quot;It is of great interest to me that many of the citizens of Berlin are of German descent. I well know the admirable qualities – the thoroughness, the tenacity, and the loyalty of the great Teutonic Race, to which I am so closely related. I am sure that these inherited qualities will go far in the making of good Canadians and loyal citizens of the British Empire&quot;.

Nonetheless, before and during World War I, there was some Anti-German sentiment in Canada and some cultural sanctions on the community, particularly in Berlin, Ontario. However, by 1919 most of the population of what would become Kitchener, Waterloo and Elmira were &quot;Canadian&quot;; over 95 percent had been born In Ontario. 
Those of the Mennonite religion were pacifist so they could not enlist and the few who had immigrated from Germany (not born in Canada) could not morally fight against a country that was a significant part of their heritage.
 The anti-German sentiment was the primary reason for the Berlin to Kitchener name change in 1916. News reports indicate that &quot;A Lutheran minister was pulled out of his house ... he was dragged through the streets. German clubs were ransacked through the course of the war. It was just a really nasty time period.&quot;. A document in the Archives of Canada makes the following comment: &quot;Although ludicrous to modern eyes, the whole issue of a name for Berlin highlights the effects that fear, hatred and nationalism can have upon a society in the face of war.&quot;

The Waterloo Pioneer Memorial Tower built in 1926 commemorates the settlement by the Pennsylvania &#x27;Dutch&#x27; (actually Pennsilfaanisch &quot;Deitsch&quot;, or German) of the Grand River area of Waterloo County.

This county is still home to the largest population of Old Order Mennonites in Canada, particularly in the areas around St Jacobs and Elmira.

Running for nearly 50 years now, the Kitchener-Waterloo Oktoberfest has been a remembrance of the Region&#x27;s German Heritage. The event includes beer halls and German entertainment, as well as a major parade, The second largest Oktoberfest in the world, the event is based on the original German Oktoberfest and is billed as &quot;Canada&#x27;s Greatest Bavarian Festival&quot;. In recent years, it has been attracting an average of 700,000 people to the county. During the 2016 Oktoberfest parade, an estimated 150,000 people lined the streets along the route.

==Successor==

Created in 1853, Waterloo County consisted of five townships: Woolwich, Wellesley, Wilmot, Waterloo, and North Dumfries, including the cities, towns and villages in each area.

The county was dissolved in 1973 and the new Regional Municipality of Waterloo, was formed, consisting of the cities of Kitchener, Cambridge, and Waterloo and the townships of Wellesley, Woolwich, Wilmot, and North Dumfries. In addition, a small portion of Beverley Township, in the former Wentworth County (now City of Hamilton), was added to North Dumfries and the Waterloo Region.

More specifically, the cities of Galt, Kitchener, and Waterloo were previously independent single-tier municipalities prior to joining the newly formed regional municipality. In the 1973 reorganization, the fifteen towns and townships of the county were reduced to just seven in the new Region of Waterloo. The new city of Cambridge was created by the amalgamation of the city of Galt, the towns of Preston and Hespeler, the village of Blair, and various parcels of township land. One township vanished when the former Waterloo Township was divided among Woolwich Township and the three cities of Kitchener, Waterloo, and Cambridge. The community of Bridgeport was annexed to the city of Kitchener. Erbsville was annexed to the city of Waterloo. The former county government was given broader powers as a regional municipality.

The Region of Waterloo, with Jack A. Young as its first chairman, took over many services, including Police, waste management, recreation, planning, roads and social services.

The Region is 1,369 square kilometres in size and its regional seat of government is in Kitchener. The Region&#x27;s population was 535,154 at the 2016 census. The former village, town and city councils joined into the council of a new township or city. An overseeing regional council handles the former county-level responsibilities, as well as now providing police and other service for the Region as a whole.

<text>In anatomy, the extrapyramidal system is a part of the motor system network causing involuntary actions. The system is called &quot;extrapyramidal&quot; to distinguish it from the tracts of the motor cortex that reach their targets by traveling through the pyramids of the medulla. The pyramidal tracts (corticospinal tract and corticobulbar tracts) may directly innervate motor neurons of the spinal cord or brainstem (anterior (ventral) horn cells or certain cranial nerve nuclei), whereas the extrapyramidal system centers on the modulation and regulation (indirect control) of anterior (ventral) horn cells.
==Extrapyramidal tracts==
The extrapyramidal tracts are chiefly found in the reticular formation of the pons and medulla, and target lower motor neurons in the spinal cord that are involved in reflexes, locomotion, complex movements, and postural control. These tracts are in turn modulated by various parts of the central nervous system, including the nigrostriatal pathway, the basal ganglia, the cerebellum, the vestibular nuclei, and different sensory areas of the cerebral cortex. All of these regulatory components can be considered part of the extrapyramidal system, in that they modulate motor activity without directly innervating motor neurons.

The extrapyramidal tracts include parts of the following:
* rubrospinal tract: Conflicts between the motor commands sent by the cerebrum and body position information provided by the proprioceptors cause the cerebellum to stimulate the red nucleus of the midbrain. The red nucleus then sends corrective commands to the spinal cord along the rubrospinal tract.
* reticulospinal tract: connects the reticular system, a diffuse region of gray matter in the brain stem, to the spinal cord. It also contributes to muscle tone and influences autonomic functions.
* lateral vestibulospinal tract: Connects the brain stem nuclei of the vestibular system with the spinal cord. This allows posture, movement, and balance to be modulated on the basis of equilibrium information provided by the vestibular system.
* tectospinal tract: This tract projects from the midbrain to the spinal cord and is important for postural movements that are driven by the superior colliculus.

<doc id="486979" wikidata="Q2335128" url="?curid=486979" title="Province of New Jersey">
<text>The Province of New Jersey was one of the Middle Colonies of Colonial America and became the U.S. state of New Jersey in 1776. The province had originally been settled by Europeans as part of New Netherland but came under English rule after the surrender of Fort Amsterdam in 1664, becoming a proprietary colony. The English renamed the province after the island of Jersey in the English Channel. The Dutch Republic reasserted control for a brief period in 1673–1674. After that it consisted of two political divisions, East Jersey and West Jersey, until they were united as a royal colony in 1702. The original boundaries of the province were slightly larger than the current state, extending into a part of the present state of New York, until the border was finalized in 1773.

==Background==

The Province of New Jersey was originally settled in the 1610s as part of the colony of New Netherland. The surrender of Fort Amsterdam in September 1664 gave control over the entire Mid-Atlantic region to the English as part of the Second Anglo-Dutch War. The English justified the seizure by claiming that John Cabot, an Italian under the sponsorship of the English King Henry VII, had been the first to discover the place, but it was probably to assert control over the profitable North Atlantic trade. Director-General of New Netherland Peter Stuyvesant, unable to rouse a military defense, relinquished control of the colony and was able in the articles of transfer to secure guarantees for property rights, laws of inheritance, and freedom of religion. After the surrender, Richard Nicolls took the position as deputy-governor of New Amsterdam and the rest of New Netherland, including those settlements on the west side of the North River (Hudson River) known as Bergen and those along the Delaware River that had been New Sweden.

==Proprietary government==
In March 1664, King Charles II granted his brother, James, the Duke of York, a Royal colony that covered New Netherlands and present-day Maine. This charter also included parts of present-day Massachusetts, which conflicted with that colony&#x27;s charter. The charter allowed James traditional propriety rights and imposed few restrictions upon his powers. In general terms, the charter was equivalent to a conveyance of land conferring on him the right of possession, control, and government, subject only to the limitation that the government must be consistent with the laws of England. The Duke of York never visited his colony and exercised little direct control of it. He elected to administer his government through governors, councils, and other officers appointed by himself. No provision was made for an elected assembly.
Later in 1664, the Duke of York gave the part of his new possessions between the Hudson River and the Delaware River to Sir George Carteret in exchange for settlement of a debt. The territory was named after the island of Jersey, Carteret&#x27;s ancestral home. The other section of New Jersey was sold to Lord Berkeley of Stratton, who was a close friend of the Duke. As a result, Carteret and Berkeley became the two English lords proprietors of New Jersey. The two proprietors of New Jersey attempted to attract more settlers to move to the province by granting sections of lands to settlers and by passing the Concession and Agreement, a 1665 document that granted religious freedom to all inhabitants of New Jersey; under the British government, there was no such religious freedom as the Church of England was the state church. In return for the land, the settlers were supposed to pay annual fees known as quit-rents.

In 1665, Philip Carteret became the first governor of New Jersey, appointed by the two proprietors. He selected Elizabeth as the capital of New Jersey. Immediately, Carteret issued several additional grants of land to landowners. Towns were started and charters granted to Newark (1666), Piscataway (1666), Bergen (1668), Middletown (1693), Woodbridge (1669), and Shrewsbury.

The idea of quit-rents became increasingly difficult because many of the settlers refused to pay them. Most of them claimed that they owed nothing to the proprietors because they received land from Richard Nicolls, governor of New York. This forced Berkeley to sell West Jersey to John Fenwick and Edward Byllynge, two English Quakers. Many more Quakers made their homes in New Jersey, seeking religious freedom from English (Church of England) rule.

Meanwhile, conflicts began rising in New Jersey. Edmund Andros, governor of New York, attempted to gain authority over East Jersey after the death of Sir George Carteret in 1680. However, he was unable to remove the position of governorship from Governor Phillip Carteret and subsequently moved to attack him and brought him to trial in New York. Carteret was later acquitted. In addition, quarrels occurred between Eastern and Western New Jerseyans, between Native Americans and New Jerseyans, and between different religious groups.

==East and West Jerseys==
From 1674 to 1702, the Province of New Jersey was divided into East Jersey and West Jersey, each with its own governor. Each had its own constitution: the West Jersey Constitution (1681) and the East Jersey Constitution (1683).

The exact border between West and East Jersey was often disputed. The border between the two sides reached the Atlantic Ocean to the north of present-day Atlantic City. The border line was created by George Keith and can still be seen in the county boundaries between Burlington and Ocean counties, and between Hunterdon and Somerset counties. The Keith line runs north-northwest from the southern part of Little Egg Harbor Township, passing just north of Tuckerton, and reaching upward to a point on the Delaware River which is just north of the Delaware Water Gap. Later, the 1676 Quintipartite Deed helped to lessen the disputes. More accurate surveys and maps were made to resolve property disputes. This resulted in the Thornton Line, drawn around 1696, and the Lawrence Line, drawn around 1743, which was adopted as the final line for legal purposes.

==Dominion of New England==
The Dominion of New England was a short-lived administrative union. On May 7, 1688, the Province of New York, the Province of East Jersey, and the Province of West Jersey were added to the Dominion. The capital was located in Boston, but because of its size, New York, East Jersey, and West Jersey were run by the lieutenant governor from New York City. After news of the overthrow of James II by William of Orange in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 reached Boston, the colonists rose up in rebellion, and the Dominion was dissolved in 1689.

==Royal colony==
On April 17, 1702, under the rule of Queen Anne, the two sections of the proprietary colony were united, and New Jersey became a royal colony. Edward Hyde, Lord Cornbury, became the first governor of the colony as a royal colony. However, he was an ineffective and corrupt ruler, taking bribes and speculating on land. In 1708, Lord Cornbury was recalled to England. New Jersey was then again ruled by the governors of New York, but this infuriated the settlers of New Jersey, accusing those governors of favoritism to New York. Judge Lewis Morris led the case for a separate governor and was appointed governor by King George II in 1738.

==New York–New Jersey Line War==
The New York – New Jersey Line War was a series of skirmishes and raids that took place for over half a century between 1701 and 1765 at the disputed border between the two American colonies the Province of New York and the Province of New Jersey. Border wars were not unusual in the early days of settlements of the colonies and originated in conflicting land claims. Because of ignorance, willful disregard, and legal ambiguities, such conflicts arose involving local settlers until a final settlement was reached. In the largest of these squabbles some of land were at stake between New York and New Jersey. The conflict was eventually settled by royal commission in 1769.

==Provincial Congress==
The Provincial Congress of New Jersey was a transitional governing body of the Province of New Jersey in the early part of the American Revolution. It first met in 1775 with representatives from all New Jersey&#x27;s thirteen counties, to supersede the royal governor.

==First state constitution==
New Jersey&#x27;s first state constitution was adopted on July 2, 1776. The American Revolutionary War was underway, and General George Washington recently had been defeated in New York, putting the state in danger of invasion. The 1776, the New Jersey State Constitution was drafted in five days and ratified within the next two days to establish a temporary government, thereby preventing New Jersey from collapsing and descending into anarchy. Among other provisions, it granted unmarried women and blacks who met property requirements the right to vote.

==Judiciary==
The Supreme Court was established in 1704, to sit alternately at Perth Amboy and Burlington, consisting of a chief justice, a second judge and several associate judges.

<text>Charles DeWitt (April 27, 1727 – August 27, 1787) was an American statesman and miller from the U.S. state of New York. He served as a delegate to the Continental Congress.

==Early life==
DeWitt was born in Kingston, New York, the eldest son of Johannes DeWitt and Mary (née Brodhead) DeWitt. Among his siblings was brother Andries J. DeWitt, who married Blandina Elmendorf Ten Eyck (parents of Jenneke (née DeWitt) Bruyn and grandparents of U.S. Representative Andrew DeWitt Bruyn). He was a first cousin once removed of Charles Clinton, DeWitt Clinton, George Clinton, Jr. and Jacob Hasbrouck DeWitt.

DeWitt attended school in Kingston and pursued classical studies. He helped his family operate a flour mill in Greenkill (in what is now Rosendale, New York). The first mill at the site was built by Mattys Mattysen Van Keuren in 1677. Van Keuren had no children and when he died the mill was passed on to his nephew, who was a DeWitt.

==Career==
He was first elected to the New York General Assembly to represent Ulster County in 1768. He was returned to that seat in every election until the Assembly was replaced in the American Revolution by a Provisional Congress for the colony in 1775. That year he was one of the members who voted to approve the work of the Continental Congress. As the revolution drew near, and the Ulster militia was expanded, he was named Colonel of the 2nd Ulster Militia regiment on December 21, 1775.

DeWitt served in the New York Provincial Congress from 1775 to 1777 while continuing his militia duties. In the New York Provincial Congress he served on the committee that drafted the state&#x27;s first constitution. He also served on the Committee of Safety. After active warfare slowed, he was elected to the New York Assembly under the new government. He served in the assembly from 1781 to 1785 and 1785–1787. The assembly sent him as a delegate to the Continental Congress in 1781 and 1784.

DeWitt supplied a great deal of flour to the Continental Army from his grist mill on the Greenkill.

==Personal life==
On December 20, 1754, DeWitt was married to Blandina DuBois (1731–1765) in Hurley. She was the daughter of Gerrit DuBois and Margaret Elemendorf, and was a great-granddaughter of Louis DuBois, a Huguenot who was one of the earliest settlers and founders of New Paltz, New York. Together, the couple had five children:

* Johannes &quot;John&quot; Charles DeWitt (1755–1833), who served as the Town of Hurley supervisor for three different terms (1788-1793, 1796–1797, 1807–1808); he married Cornelia Kantein in 1778.
* Margrietje &quot;Margaret&quot; DeWitt (1758–1827), who married Johannes Bruyn (1750–1814), a New York Assemblymen from Ulster County, a presidential elector for New York, and a member of New York State Senate who was the son of Jacobus Bruyn.
* Maria DeWitt (1760–1798), who married Jacobus &quot;James&quot; Hasbrouck in Kingston in 1783.
* Gerret DeWitt (1762–1846), who married Catharine Ten Eyck (1765–1840), a daughter of Matthew Ten Eyck and Cornelia (née Wynkoop) Ten Eyck, in 1786.
* Ann DeWitt

He died on August 27, 1787, in Kingston and is interred in the Dutch Reformed Cemetery in Hurley, New York. He wrote his will on July 7, 1776, as he prepared to set out for the defense of New York City. He left the mill to his son Gerret, who expanded it in 1806, and the water-powered mill would continue in operation until 1922.

===Descendants===
DeWitt&#x27;s grandson, Charles G. DeWitt, served in the U.S. Congress. Another grandson, Charles DeWitt Bruyn (1784–1849), was a New York Assemblymen from Sullivan and Ulster counties from 1821 to 1822. His great-grandson, Matthew Pawling DeWitt, served as Hurley Town Supervisor from 1856 to 1857, and Matthew&#x27;s son (Charles&#x27;s great-great-grandson), Christopher Newkirk DeWitt, served in this position from 1880 to 1886 and 1896–1899. Another great-great-grandson, Matthew TenEyck DeWitt, was Hurley Supervisor on multiple occasions (1910-1911, 1914–1915, 1924–1927, and 1933–1935, his death). Another great-grandson was David M. De Witt.

<doc id="486981" wikidata="Q2579356" url="?curid=486981" title="Mormopterus">
<text>Mormopterus is a genus of molossid microchiropterans, small flying mammals referred to as free-tailed bats. The genus has been the subject of several revisions, and the diversity of taxa centred on Australia were separated to a new genus &quot;Ozimops&quot;, and two monotypic genera, &quot;Setirostris&quot; and &quot;Micronomus&quot;. The species of &quot;Mormopterus&quot;, in this stricter sense, are only found in areas outside of Australia and West Papua.

== Taxonomy ==
A description of the genus was published in 1865 by Wilhelm Peters, as a new subgenus allied to &quot;Nyctinomus&quot;.

While the species-level taxonomy became better resolved, the integrity of the genus &quot;Mormopterus&quot; as it stood was less clear and molecular sequencing data indicated that &quot;Mormopterus&quot; was paraphyletic. The closest relatives of &quot;M. kalinowski&quot; are members of &quot;Nyctinomops&quot;. Further phylogenetic work is required to resolve the relationships of the species’ groups from the three regional areas, and what their relationships are to other molossid genera.

Investigations of Australian bat systematics have resulted in species confusion, which has in turn inhibited other research and recognition for the purpose of conservation; &quot;Mormopterus&quot; had presented the greatest difficulties to taxonomic workers. A revision in 2014 used a multilocus approach, combining morphological and molecular analysis to further separate the genus; this recognised the subgenus &quot;Micronomus&quot; and erected two new taxa, subgenera &quot;Setirostris&quot; (monotypic) and &quot;Ozimops&quot;, which circumscribed four accepted and three new species of &quot;Mormopterus&quot;. Prior to this revision some taxa were given tentative labels of convenience by workers, &quot;Mormopterus&quot; sp. 1, 2, 3 ... , following a molecular study in 1998 that identified probable species without publishing descriptions.

The Australian Faunal Directory, citing a 2015 taxonomic publication that elevated subgenera published in a 2014 review, recognises genera &quot;Ozimops&quot;, &quot;Setirostris&quot; and &quot;Micronomus&quot; and the new generic combinations of taxa formerly assigned to this genus.

== Diversity ==

The genus &quot;Mormopterus&quot; has seven species occurring in geographically disparate locations, three species from the west Indian Ocean region (Madagascar and the Mascarene Islands and possibly South Africa and Ethiopia), one species from western Indonesia (known from a single specimen from Sumatra) that appears to be related to the above three species; and three species from the neotropics (the western side of South America as far south as northern Chile, and Cuba). The former subgenus &quot;Ozimops&quot;, later elevated to genus, is most diverse in Australia, although also found in the Indonesian Archipelago, Halmahera, Ambon, Seram and West Papua, and in Papua New Guinea. The two monotypic subgenera &quot;Micronomus&quot; and &quot;Setirostris&quot;, also elevated to genus, are endemic to Australia.

<text>WSB-FM (98.5 MHz) is a commercial radio station in Atlanta, Georgia. It carries an adult contemporary radio format and is owned by the Cox Media Group, serving as the group&#x27;s flagship FM station. WSB-FM is the oldest FM radio station in Atlanta. The studios and offices are on Peachtree Street NE in Atlanta, in the WSB-TV and Radio Group Building.

WSB-FM has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 100,000 watts. The transmitter is at the end of New Street NE in the Edgewood neighborhood of Atlanta. It shares the tower with WABE-TV, WSTR-FM and WVEE-FM. It broadcasts in the HD Radio hybrid format; the HD2 subchannel airs a soft adult contemporary format, and the HD3 subchannel carries the Regional Mexican format heard on WLKQ-FM, and also feeds FM translator W296BB (107.1) in Jonesboro.

==History==
===Early years===
In the early 1940s, the &quot;Atlanta Constitution&quot; started an FM radio station. After an experimental period, it became WCON-FM on 98.5 MHz. The call sign contained the letters &quot;CON&quot; for &quot;Constitution&quot;. The competing &quot;Atlanta Journal&quot; had already put Atlanta&#x27;s first AM station on the air in 1922, WSB. In 1948, the Journal added a companion FM station, WSB-FM, broadcasting on 104.5 MHz.

When the two newspapers merged under Cox Enterprises ownership in 1952, WCON-FM and WSB-FM went silent. WSB-FM returned to the air in 1955 on WCON-FM&#x27;s dial position, 98.5 FM. While it has the call letters of WSB-FM, the station traces its founding to when WCON-FM first signed on.

During its early years, when few people had FM radio receivers, WSB-FM mostly simulcast the programming on WSB (AM). That included dramas, comedies, news and sports from the NBC Red Network, as well as local shows. As network programming moved from radio to television in the 1950s, WSB-AM-FM carried a full service, middle of the road format of popular music, news, sports and information.

===Beautiful music===
In the 1960s, the Federal Communications Commission encouraged large market radio stations to provide separate programming on their FM outlets. WSB-FM would begin airing beautiful music, 15-minute sweeps of orchestral music, mostly cover versions of pop songs, as well as Hollywood and Broadway show tunes. It was mostly automated.

A planned merger of General Electric and Cox in the late 1970s would have caused WSB-FM to be spun off. Noted African-American broadcaster Ragan Henry had plans to acquire WSB-FM and use the call letters WEZA on the station, so it would no longer share its call sign with WSB-AM-TV, but the GE deal did not materialize.

===Switch to AC===
In the 1970s, WSB-FM added some soft vocals to its beautiful music playlist. The ratio of vocals to instrumentals continued to increase until March 15, 1982, when the station formally switched to soft adult contemporary music and eliminated the instrumentals.

In the 1980s, many FM stations were rounding off their dial positions on the air; WSB-FM stopped identifying itself as 98.5 and rounded it off to &quot;99FM&quot;. In 1985, WSB-FM sued its soft AC competitor WLTA-FM, owned by Susquehanna Broadcasting, which had begun calling itself &quot;Warm 99&quot;. Cox Broadcasting claimed trademark infringement, saying listeners would be confused with two Atlanta stations with similar formats using &quot;99&quot; as their dial position. Arbitron was having trouble crediting each station in the ratings because of the common use of &quot;99&quot;.

Cox v. Susquehanna Broadcasting became a landmark case in United States district court. The judge was handed a digital radio and asked to tune to 100.0 MHz, but there was no signal. To find the nearest station, he pressed the &quot;Scan&quot; button, and it stopped on 101.5 MHz (WKHX-FM). Next, he entered 99.0 MHz, which, again, contained no signal. Scanning from there, the radio hit 99.7, WLTA&#x27;s frequency. In his precedent-setting decision, the judge stated that on a radio dial &quot;a radio station&#x27;s frequency is its address&quot; and one cannot trademark an address. On June 25, he ruled in favor of Warm 99. A short time later, WSB-FM began calling itself &quot;B98.5FM&quot;.

===Competing with 94.9===
Another former beautiful music station, WPCH, made the transition to soft AC shortly after WSB-FM in the early 1980s. The two stations were locked in a battle for &quot;at-work listeners&quot; for two decades, with formats designed for workplace listening. WPCH, at various times, called itself &quot;95 WPCH&quot;, &quot;Peach 94.9&quot;, and &quot;94.9 Lite FM&quot;, and even switched its call letters to WLTM. On December 18, 2006, 94.9 flipped to country music as WUBL.

For a year, the soft AC format and WLTM call letters were moved to the weaker frequency of 96.7. When that station (now WBZW) switched to classic country, WSB-FM became the only adult contemporary music station in Atlanta. Over time, WSB-FM would move to a more upbeat AC direction.

===DJs and programming changes===
On December 29, 2006, WSB-FM became the Atlanta affiliate for the nationally syndicated Delilah show (which was previously broadcast on 94.9 Lite FM/Peach 94.9). Delilah was dropped from WSB-FM in December 2011.

On July 1, 2008, Steve McCoy and Vikki Locke joined WSB-FM as the morning hosts after 17 years at adult top 40 station WSTR &quot;Star 94&quot;. Steve McCoy was let go on February 25, 2010. In March 2011, Kelly Stevens from the old &quot;Kelly and Alpha&quot; show rejoined the station and was paired with Vikki. In August 2012, in the early morning hours one day, Stevens&#x27; SUV was totaled by a vehicle driving the wrong way while he was driving to work on the Georgia 400 Freeway. The other driver was killed. Stevens&#x27; left leg was broken and left elbow shattered, but he was in good spirits later in the morning at Grady Hospital, when he called in to the show.

In the past, WSB-FM produced an annual &quot;Family Fun Fest&quot; event, where companies that provide products for kids and families would showcase the products and services they offered. The show featured live events and appearances from local sports stars. The station conducted live broadcasts from the location both days of the event. The festival ended in 2009.

During the spring of 2011, WSB-FM shook up its on-air staff and format due to declining ratings. All music before 1980 was dropped, more songs from the 2000s were added, and WSB-FM abandoned the longtime &quot;Atlanta&#x27;s Best Variety of Soft Rock&quot; tagline. Its slogan became &quot;Your Favorites From the 80s, 90s, and Now&quot;, later shortened to &quot;80s, 90s &amp; Now&quot;.

From 2001 to 2003 and again from 2009 to 2011, each weekend WSB-FM would play only music from the 1980s. On September 16, 2011, the station changed from &quot;All-80&#x27;s Weekends&quot; to &quot;80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s Weekends&quot;. As of January 2012, 1980s and 1990s weekends no longer air. The station had previously aired all 1970s weekends during the 1990s.

On April 27, 2012, longtime WSB-FM afternoon DJ Kelly McCoy retired after 27 years in the same air shift, after joining the station in January 1985. At 4:00 that afternoon, WSB-FM aired a special tribute during his last show. It was the first time in recent memory that the station broke format during afternoon drive time. McCoy was replaced by DJ Mike Shannon. On January 4, 2013, Cox Radio management fired Shannon after just nine months on air.

<text>The Carl Brandon Society is an organization originating within the science fiction community. Their mission &quot;is to increase racial and ethnic diversity in the production of and audience for speculative fiction.&quot; Their vision is &quot;a world in which speculative fiction, about complex and diverse cultures from writers of all backgrounds, is used to understand the present and model possible futures; and where people of color are full citizens in the community of imagination and progress.&quot;

The Society was founded in 1997 following discussions at the feminist science fiction convention WisCon 23 in Madison, Wisconsin. It was named after &quot;Carl Brandon&quot;, a fictional black fan writer created in the mid-1950s by Terry Carr and Pete Graham. This also alludes to the James Tiptree, Jr. Award, named after the fictional male persona used by the writer long known as &quot;James Tiptree, Jr.&quot;.

The Society maintains annuals lists of fantastical works published by writers of color.

==CBS Parallax and Kindred Awards==

Inaugurated in 2005, the Carl Brandon Parallax Award is a juried award given to works of speculative fiction created by a self-identified person of color. The 2005 Parallax, the first to be awarded, went to Walter Mosley for his young adult novel &quot;47&quot;.

Inaugurated in 2005, the Carl Brandon Kindred Award is a juried award given to any work of speculative fiction dealing with issues of race and ethnicity; nominees may be of any racial or ethnic group. The 2005 Kindred Award went to Susan Vaught for her young adult novel, &quot;Stormwitch&quot;.

The awards were not given for years from 2012 to 2018, but resumed with awards for 2019.

<doc id="486995" wikidata="Q375207" url="?curid=486995" title="Vespertine">
<text>Vespertine is the fourth studio album by Icelandic recording artist Björk. It was first released on 18 August 2001 in Japan by One Little Indian Records and in the United States by Elektra Entertainment. Björk aspired to create an album with minimal and intricate electronic music to evoke an intimate and domestic feeling, in contrast with the louder styles of her previous studio album &quot;Homogenic&quot; (1997). She enlisted producers such as Opiate, Console and the duo Matmos, and has also worked with harpist Zeena Parkins. Production on the album began whilst filming her role in &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot;.

Björk composed arrangements with thin-sounding instruments, including the harp, the celesta, clavichord, strings and custom music boxes. Assisted by Matmos, Björk created &quot;microbeats&quot; from various commonplace sounds, such as that of shuffling cards and ice being cracked. Lyrically, the album drew inspiration from Björk&#x27;s new relationship with Matthew Barney, exploring themes related to sex, intimacy, eroticism, and love. Other lyrical sources include the poetry of E. E. Cummings and British playwright Sarah Kane&#x27;s &quot;Crave&quot;. Three singles were released from &quot;Vespertine&quot;: &quot;Hidden Place&quot;, &quot;Pagan Poetry&quot;, and &quot;Cocoon&quot;. The music videos of the latter two were banned on MTV for their depictions of sexuality. Björk embarked on the Vespertine world tour with Parkins, Matmos, and a choir of Inuit women, where they performed at theatres and small venues in favor of acoustics.

The album peaked at number 19 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 selling 75,000 copies in its first week and at number 8 on the UK Albums Chart. It was certified gold in Canada, France, and the United Kingdom. Noted for its erotic, intimate mood and sonic experimentation, &quot;Vespertine&quot; received universal acclaim from music critics, with some considering it Björk&#x27;s best album to date. The album appeared on several publications&#x27; lists of the best albums of 2001 and of the decade, and has been evaluated by many critics to be one of the best albums of all time.

== Conceptualisation ==
Björk had released her previous studio album, &quot;Homogenic&quot;, in 1997. The album&#x27;s style differed from her previous two releases, described by her as &quot;very emotionally confrontational and [...] very dramatic&quot;. She also described &quot;All Is Full of Love&quot;—&quot;Homogenic&quot;″s closing track—as the first song on &quot;Vespertine&quot;, as it opposed the rest of the album&#x27;s &quot;aggressive, macho&quot; aesthetic. Writer and critic Mark Pytlik writes, &quot;Her appetite for thumping techno had been, temporarily at least, subsumed by a desire for stark melodies and minimalist production&quot;. In 2000, she starred in Lars von Trier&#x27;s &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot;, and composed its soundtrack, &quot;Selmasongs&quot;. While she worked on the film, she also began producing her next album, writing new music, and teaming with new collaborators. She has said &quot;&quot;Selmasongs&quot; was the day job and &quot;Vespertine&quot; was the hobby&quot;. During this time, she also began to use her new laptop to write music, and &quot;Vespertine&quot; has been retrospectively referred to as &quot;her laptop album&quot;.

She initially set about making a record with a domestic mood featuring &quot;everyday moods and everyday noises translating into melodies and beats&quot;, hence its working title &quot;Domestika&quot;. Marius de Vries told &quot;Sound on Sound&quot; that the project was driven by an &quot;overriding aesthetic of being homely and comfortable&quot;, which had &quot;all to do with Björk wanting to make a record as a reaction to the wanderings and the pain she experienced making &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot;… [and coming back] after you&#x27;ve wandered.&quot; Björk&#x27;s initial idea was also to &quot;celebrat[e] the banalities of everyday life.&quot; For example, the title track &quot;Domestica&quot;, originally titled &quot;Lost Keys&quot;, was meant to be a &quot;gentle, humorous snapshot&quot; of Björk looking for her keys.

Her new relationship with artist Matthew Barney, and the tension while filming &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot;, have been referred to as the two major forces that shaped what would become &quot;Vespertine&quot;. Her relationship with Barney influenced her lyrics, which were now more intimate, detailed, and revealing as opposed to those of her past works. A particular example is &quot;Cocoon&quot;, which is sexually explicit. As the process of filming demanded that she be extroverted, the new music she was creating became hushed and tranquil as a way to escape.

The eventual title change of the record reveals its changing nature. Writer and critic Mark Pytlik notes that, &quot;where [&quot;Domestika&quot;] signified a focus of extracting magic from the platitudes of everyday life, [&quot;Vespertine&quot;] [...] suggested a creation of magic through much more powerful forces. In fine style, Björk had set out to write an album about making sandwiches. She&#x27;d ended up with an album about making love&quot;. A stylistic antecedent was her poem &quot;Techno Prayer&quot;, published in &quot;Details&quot; magazine in July 1996, which would later be used as part of the lyrics of &quot;All Neon Like&quot;. It featured thematic ideas such as cocooning and thread-weaving that she would later explore on &quot;Vespertine&quot;.

== Recording ==
The earliest sessions took place in Spain with programmer Jake Davies. Björk commissioned Valgeir Sigurðsson to relocate some of his studio equipment from Iceland to Denmark where &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot; was being filmed. While living in Copenhagen, she also contacted the electronic musician Thomas Knak (also known as Opiate), after having enjoyed his 1999 album &quot;Objects for an Ideal Home&quot;.

In Iceland, programmers Jake Davies and Marius de Vries joined Björk for a writing session, laying down more tracks, in addition to nine already mixed. Then, she &quot;set up camp [...] during summer&quot; in a New York City loft, and began to work with harpist Zeena Parkins. Much of &quot;Vespertine&quot; was &quot;composed, crafted and edited&quot; in that loft, in what has been called the &quot;&quot;Domestika&quot; sessions&quot;. Some tracks were recorded as an overdub &quot;on top of a slave mixdown&quot; of the Spanish sessions.

&quot;Undo&quot; was written during a two-week session with Knak that January in Reykjavík. Björk recorded her vocals on top of Knak&#x27;s minimalist rhythmic backbone, and months later she had added a full choir and string section. &quot;Cocoon&quot;, also produced by Knak, was one of the last songs to be written for the album; its melody suddenly came to Björk and she contacted him. Knak took it as a chance to make a more minimal track, similar to his own releases.

&quot;Heirloom&quot; was based on an existing instrumental track from electronic musician Console&#x27;s album &quot;Rocket in the Pocket&quot; (1998), titled &quot;Crabcraft&quot; (which itself samples Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark&#x27;s &quot;Sacred Heart&quot;). Björk contacted Console in early 2000 and they met in London; she then added her vocals on top. During this period, Björk also worked with Bogdan Raczynski on the song &quot;Who Is It&quot;, but it did not make the final cut and was subsequently re-recorded for the album &quot;Medúlla&quot;. Björk said that she worked on &quot;Vespertine&quot; for three years.

== Instrumentation ==
As she wanted to write her own songs on music boxes, Björk contacted a music box company requesting transparent acrylic boxes because she wanted the sound to be &quot;as hard as possible, like it was frozen&quot;. Björk decided to use sounds that would not be compromised when downloaded from sites such as Napster, such as &quot;microbeat[s]&quot;, whispered vocals, the harp, music box, celeste, clavichord, and strings which &quot;ended up being more panoramic textures in the background.&quot; For the string and music box arrangements, she used Sibelius scorewriter software.

For &quot;Vespertine,&quot; Björk wanted to make a &quot;microcosmos of thirty or forty beats interacting&quot;. To do this, she recorded noises around her house to make beats out of them. Once the songs were almost finished, Björk contacted the duo Matmos, who she considered &quot;virtuosos&quot; in the field, and sent them various songs to work with. They added beats made from the noise of crushing ice and shuffling cards, among others. In her documentary &quot;Minuscule&quot;, Björk explained that this process consisted of &quot;taking something very tiny and magnifying it up to big&quot;, intending to convey the &quot;sensation that you&#x27;ve been told a secret&quot;, that is also present in micrographs. Marius de Vries and Björk did much of the sound design on &quot;Vespertine&quot; with a text-based synthesizer called SuperCollider. De Vries said that typing in commands as opposed to using knobs, &quot;take[s] you in surprising directions.&quot; Additionally, Knak used an Ensoniq ASR-10, for &quot;Cocoon&quot;.
== Composition ==
Björk has stated that she wanted the album to sound like &quot;modern chamber music&quot;, referring to the times where &quot;the most ideal music situation was in the home, where people would play harps for each other&quot;. She also considers &quot;Vespertine&quot; to be the opposite of her previous studio album &quot;Homogenic&quot;, the former being an introverted, quiet, winter record; the latter a loud, dramatic, summer record. Björk has also described the album as &quot;more electronic folk music&quot;.

Critics have classified &quot;Vespertine&quot; as electronica, art pop, psychedelia, ambient, trip-hop, folktronica, and glitch pop. Music journalists have also noted the experimental nature of the record. The &quot;Orlando Weekly&quot; wrote that with the album, Björk &quot;[took] her modernist art-pop further into the abstract&quot;. According to Joseph Hale of &quot;Tiny Mix Tapes&quot;, described &quot;Vespertine&quot;&#x27;s music as a combination of &quot;psychedelic techno, chamber music, and chorale together into modal constructions that swelled and receded like emotions (or psylocibin)&quot;. David Fricke of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote &quot;&quot;Vespertine&quot; is the closest any pop-vocal album has come to the luxuriant Zen of the new minimalist techno&quot;. Björk&#x27;s performance on &quot;Vespertine&quot; has been described as that of an &quot;art-rock torch singer&quot;.

Stylistically, &quot;Vespertine&quot; incorporates elements of both art and dance music. For example, the instrumentation of choir, strings, and harp is suggestive of Romantic art music, while the &quot;synthesised keyboard sonorities, filtering effects and complex percussive sounds&quot; are elements characteristic of dance-based pop. Academic Nicola Dibben wrote that its &quot;classical and dance-based elements&quot; combine &quot;the spiritual and the sensual&quot; allusions of the album.

&quot;Vespertine&quot; is also characterised by &quot;the obsession with sonic traces of analog technology – that is, the pervasive use of loops, static and white noise&quot;. Unlike previous albums like &quot;Debut&quot; and &quot;Post&quot;, &quot;electronic sounds are the norm, and the acoustic sounds become the interjections.&quot; Influenced by the 1999 album &quot;New Ancient Strings&quot;, a recording of kora duets by Toumani Diabaté with Ballaké Sissoko, Björk said she &quot;messed up the sound of too angelic instruments, like the harp or the glockenspiel&quot; on &quot;Vespertine&quot;. Björk&#x27;s voice is used as a supplement to &quot;the complex electronic textures&quot;. Her vocals often appear to be recorded close to the microphone and with little treatment, and sung in a sometimes &quot;unstable whisper&quot;, conveying a sense of close proximity and reduced space suitable for the intimate lyrics.

== Songs ==

=== Tracks 1-6 ===
The album opens with &quot;Hidden Place&quot;, which features a soprano section and strings, &quot;over the top of a warm, intimate melody&quot;. Michael Hubbard of &quot;musicOMH&quot; felt the track was reminiscent of &quot;Homogenic&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Hunter&quot;, but less focused on the beats. &quot;NME&quot; called it progressive folk, while &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; wrote it was electro. Björk sings about &quot;how two people can create a paradise just by uniting&quot;, as she intones: &quot;I&#x27;m so close to tears/And so close to/Simply calling you up/And simply suggesting/We go to that hidden place&quot;. &quot;Cocoon&quot; is &quot;based around an exploratory bassline and beats that sound like fingertips on skin&quot;. Discussing the glitch nature of the track, Björk said, &quot;when you take technology and use the areas where it breaks, where it&#x27;s faulty, you&#x27;re entering a mystery zone where you can&#x27;t control it&quot;. Lyrically revolving around making love, the song alternates between metaphors like &quot;Who would have known/That a boy like him/Would have entered me lightly/Restoring my blisses&quot;, and explicit lines such as &quot;He slides inside/Half awake, half asleep&quot; and &quot;Gorgeousness/He&#x27;s still inside me&quot;. Björk sings a breathy, &quot;whispered, near-cracking falsetto&quot; on the track.

&quot;It&#x27;s Not Up to You&quot; has been described as a &quot;dizzying ballad&quot; and a song that lifts the album upward. Michael Paoletta of &quot;Billboard&quot; described the track as &quot;melancholy&quot;. Its lyrics are about &quot;love for the unknown devices that culminate in &#x27;perfect days&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;pleas to find beauty in unlikely places&quot;. The &quot;caressing lyrics&quot; of &quot;Undo&quot; assure that: &quot;It&#x27;s not meant to be a strife/It&#x27;s not meant to be a struggle uphill&quot;. Biographer Mark Pytlik wrote that &quot;Undo&quot; is &quot;a reassuring reminder that anything can happen once you let it. If you are in pain, undo it, Björk suggests, no hint of disingenuousness in her voice, over climbing strings and a rising choir&quot;. &quot;Pagan Poetry&quot; is a &quot;harp-splashed&quot; song that concerns unrequited love. The track builds slowly, &quot;with Björk wailing over swelling keyboard crescendos&quot;, until, at the four-minute mark, &quot;all the music drops away, leaving Björk utterly exposed&quot; as she sings &quot;I love him, I love him/I love him, I love him/I love him, I love him&quot;. The song also features &quot;a flotilla of music boxes with an Asian-teahouse touch&quot;. The instrumental interlude &quot;Frosti&quot; has been described as &quot;metallic tundra&quot;. Its sound stems from a music box, creating an intimate, fairy tale-like effect.

=== Tracks 7-12 ===
&quot;Frosti&quot; fades into &quot;Aurora&quot;, while &quot;a warm, faintly crunchy sound&quot; is heard. These are samples of footsteps in the snow—the work of Matmos—re-appropriated as the song&#x27;s &quot;subtly shifting beat&quot;. &quot;Aurora&quot; has been described as &quot;something that appeals to a child-like imagination&quot;, and having a &quot;magical and airy quality&quot;. In the lyrics, she addresses a Nature goddess, and sings about &quot;literally dissolving with pleasure&quot; as she &quot;prays to become one with… the northern lights&quot;. One of Björk&#x27;s broodiest compositions, &quot;An Echo, a Stain&quot; is underpinned by a creeping choir line and nibbling clicks, and features an &quot;unresolved, ominous tension&quot; that is atypical of her writing style. Most of the song&#x27;s lyrics speak directly to incidents in Sarah Kane&#x27;s 1998 dark-themed play &quot;Crave&quot;, so much so that it was titled &quot;Crave&quot; up to the last minute. &quot;Sun in My Mouth&quot; is an adaptation of E. E. Cummings&#x27; poem &quot;I will wade out/Till my thighs are steeped in burning flowers&quot;, with an emphasis on the vocal and accompaniment provided by a string orchestra, a harp, and soft electronica. The track&#x27;s lyrics have been considered a &quot;startling allusion to masturbation&quot;, positioned &quot;within the fantasy-like imagery of burning flowers, sea-girls, darkness and the sun&quot;.

&quot;Heirloom&quot; alters &quot;between what sounds like a samba preset on a vintage Wurlitzer organ and skittering breakbeats, and is decorated with inverted synthtones and analog keyboards&quot;. The song&#x27;s lyrics tell a &quot;fuzzy story&quot; about a recurring dream, while &quot;[likening] the art of singing to swallowing and exhaling &#x27;glowing lights&#x27;&quot; as Björk sings: &quot;During the night/They do a trapeze walk/Until they&#x27;re in the sky/Right above my bed&quot;. Film director Harmony Korine wrote &quot;Harm of Will&quot;&#x27;s lyrics. The &quot;Slate&quot; album review noted the minimalist nature of the track, pointing out a lack of hook, beat and melody. It is a slow song, as is the closing track, &quot;Unison&quot;. The latter &quot;[contains] a refrain directly inspired by [Björk&#x27;s] experience in &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot; and a healthy dollop of self-effacing humor evoked to counter the balance&quot;. It &quot;brings beats and strings together in a final crescendo that also manages to incorporate a little jungle&quot;.

== Artwork ==
The cover art, shot by Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin in Los Angeles, California, is a black and white photograph of Björk lying down on the patterned ground next to a swimming pool, covering her eyes from the sun and wearing the Marjan Pejoski swan dress that she wore at the 73rd Academy Awards in 2001, which caused a media frenzy and was widely criticised.

The duo M/M (Paris), known for applying and integrating their work on photographs (so called &quot;dessin dans l&#x27;image&quot;, or &quot;drawings in the picture&quot;), illustrated the cover, featuring a swan and the album&#x27;s title with feathers. Björk thought swans embodied &quot;Vespertine&quot;″s music, describing them as &quot;a white, sort of winter bird&quot; and &quot;very romantic&quot;. &quot;Vespertine&quot; came with a booklet of M/M (Paris) artwork. Michael Hubbard of &quot;musicOMH&quot; commented, &quot;the spine of the CD is entirely white, while the rest of the sleeve features innovative photography and artwork&quot;. Academic Nicola Dibben has likened &quot;Vespertine&quot;&#x27;s artwork and promotion to representations of the Greek myth of Leda and the Swan, emphazising the erotic overtones of both.

&quot;Vespertine&quot; was released later than One Little Indian Records had intended. Originally, the album&#x27;s release was scheduled for May, but by March it had been put back to August, so as to enable Björk to work on the album&#x27;s promotion. On 22 May 2001, Björk premiered six songs off the new album in an intimate concert at the Riverside Church in New York City, accompanied by Matmos and Zeena Parkins. &quot;Vespertine&quot; was released on 27 August, as a double 12&quot; record, CD and compact cassette. To coincide with the release of the album, Björk also released an eponymously titled coffee table book, created by her and edited and designed by M/M (Paris). A second single, Towards the end of 2001, &quot;Vespertine&quot; was released as a DVD-Audio. The music videos for &quot;Hidden Place&quot;, &quot;Pagan Poetry&quot; and &quot;Cocoon&quot; were included in the DVDs &quot;Volumen Plus&quot; (2002) and &quot;Greatest Hits – Volumen 1993–2003&quot; (2002).

=== Appearances ===
Together, Elektra, and New York-based independent marketing firm Drill Team, created the Björk Vespertine Syndicate (BVS), a group of 30-plus websites that had exclusive access to non-album tracks, music videos, and concert/rehearsal footage. To promote the album, Björk appeared in various magazines in mid-2001, including: &quot;The Fader&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;Pulse&quot;, &quot;URB&quot;, &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;InStyle&quot;, &quot;Vibe&quot;, &quot;Us&quot;, &quot;Nylon&quot;, &quot;Index&quot;, &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot; and, &quot;Spin&quot;. Magazines &quot;Dazed &amp; Confused&quot; and &quot;Les Inrockuptibles&quot; featured a special issue with texts, photographs, and different CDs issued randomly, each with a different song from the album. &quot;The Times&quot; issued a Björk special, featuring videos, music, photographs, and a competition to see Björk perform. She also appeared on several TV shows, including: &quot;The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;, &quot;The David Letterman Show&quot; and, &quot;Charlie Rose&quot;, among others.

==Singles==
===Hidden Place===
On 6 August 2001, &quot;Hidden Place&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lead single, its music video having premiered in July. It was released as two CDs and a DVD, featuring B-sides &quot;Generous Palmstroke&quot;, &quot;Foot Soldier&quot;, &quot;Mother Heroic&quot; and &quot;Verandi&quot;.

The music video for &quot;Hidden Place&quot; was directed by Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin and co-directed by M/M (Paris). It was shot in London over four days in February 2001. It was originally planned for a song from &quot;Selmasongs&quot;, but Björk felt the project was more appropriate for &quot;Vespertine&quot;. The video consists of close-up shots panning around Björk&#x27;s face, as fluids flow in and out of her facial orifices. M/M (Paris) said that they &quot;wanted to get as close to her as we could, as we all felt she had never been portrayed as the &#x27;real&#x27; and beautiful woman she is.&quot;, and that the fluids in the video &quot;visualiz[e] all possible emotions pulsating and circulating in her very busy brain.

===Pagan Poetry===
&quot;Pagan Poetry&quot;, was released on 5 November 2001 as two CDs and a DVD, featuring a remix by Matthew Herbert, &quot;Domestica&quot;, &quot;Batabid&quot;, an Opiate remix of &quot;Aurora&quot;, and the music video for &quot;Pagan Poetry&quot;.

Nick Knight, who had previously shot the cover art for &quot;Homogenic&quot;, directed the music video for &quot;Pagan Poetry&quot;. It is about a woman preparing herself for marriage and for her lover, as she sews a wedding dress onto her skin. As she had asked him to make a video about her love life, Knight gave Björk a camcorder and asked her to shoot her own private scenes. Shots of skin being pierced were also recorded with this camera; the people being pierced were five women who &quot;were into subculture and piercings&quot; and Björk herself, who only pierced her ear. This first two-thirds of the video contains a great deal of post-production by Peter Marin, who gave the image its abstract watercolor-like effect. The shots of Björk with her Alexander McQueen topless wedding dress were filmed in super 35 format. The main idea behind the music video was: &quot;to do something with the moving image that was a mirror of what was happening musically&quot;. Although the music video has been well received by critics, it was highly controversial and banned from MTV in 2001.

===Cocoon===
&quot;Cocoon&quot;, the album&#x27;s third single, was released on 11 March 2002. Its music video had premiered in February. Once again, the single was released as two separate CDs and a DVD, with &quot;Pagan Poetry&quot;, &quot;Sun in My Mouth&quot; and &quot;Amphibian&quot; as B-sides.

The music video for &quot;Cocoon&quot; was directed by Eiko Ishioka and was shot in April 2001 in New York City. One of Björk&#x27;s most avant-garde music videos, it: &quot;plays with minimalist white for both costume and bleached eyebrows, treating Björk as a geisha whose makeup extends over her entire nude body&quot;. Red threads emerge from her nipples and circulate between her breasts and nose, finally enveloping her in a cocoon. Björk actually wore a very close-fitting body suit. Although not as controversial as the &quot;Pagan Poetry&quot; music video, it was still banned from MTV.

== Tour ==

In early August 2001, Björk confirmed the first set of dates for the Vespertine world tour which would take place at opera houses, theatres, and small venues, with favourable acoustics for the concerts. She enlisted Matmos, Zeena Parkins, a choir of Inuit girls from Greenland, and conductor Simon Lee; Visually, fauna illustrations by Ernst Haeckel were used as a backdrop during the tour.

The tour opened at the Grand Rex in Paris on 18 August. While in Paris, she held a press conference to discuss the album but gave no individual interviews saying that: &quot;she&#x27;d rather do music than talk about it.&quot; While in France she also received the National Order of Merit at the Ministry of National Education in Paris. Another press conference was held in Barcelona on 3 November 2001 while touring in Spain.

A 16 December 2001 performance at the Royal Opera House in London was released as the DVD &quot;Live at Royal Opera House&quot; in 2002. A DVD release featuring a behind-the-scenes look at the tour, titled &quot;Minuscule&quot;, was released at the end of 2003. &quot;Vespertine Live&quot;, a live album consisting of songs recorded during the Vespertine world tour, was included in the 2003 box set &quot;Live Box&quot;; it also includes a live version of &quot;All Is Full of Love&quot;, a song from &quot;Homogenic&quot; and &quot;Overture&quot; from &quot;Selmasongs&quot;.

== Commercial performance ==
&quot;Vespertine&quot; debuted at #19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, selling 75,000 units in its first week, becoming her career peak in sales. It also debuted upon the top spot on the Top Electronic Albums chart, staying there for 3 weeks. One Little Indian head Derek Birket declaring that the album had sold over 1.2 million copies in Europe alone. That month, the album also became number one on the album charts in Iceland, Sweden, Denmark, France, Norway, and the European Top 100 Albums chart. In addition, &quot;Vespertine&quot; charted in the top 10 of Canada, Italy, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, Finland, Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden, Austria and Australia. The album has been certified Gold in Canada, France, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

Lead single &quot;Hidden Place&quot; reached the top spot of the singles charts in Spain, also charting in the top 40 in the United Kingdom, Canada, Italy, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Belgium and France. Following release &quot;Pagan Poetry&quot; also performed well in Spain, while entering the French chart at number 49 and the UK chart at number 38. &quot;Cocoon&quot; performed more poorly, charting at number 61 in France and number 35 in the United Kingdom.

== Critical reception ==

Upon release, &quot;Vespertine&quot; received universal acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 88, based on 28 reviews. Various writers including David Fricke and Simon Reynolds named &quot;Vespertine&quot; Björk&#x27;s best album to date. The album received some praise for its themes of intimacy and introversion, with Anthony Carew from About.com writing: &quot;What makes &quot;Vespertine&quot; even more intriguing is the way that it marries its musical ambitions to its thematic emotions… And what makes it great… is the purity and intimacy of its feelings.&quot; Fricke and &quot;musicOMH&quot;&#x27;s Michael Hubbard have both noted that the singer had shown a more mature side of her. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s Keith Phipps found it to be: &quot;an album both timeless and of the moment, an avant-garde electronic-pop exploration of classic themes&quot;. In a later review for &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, Douglas Wolk described the album as &quot;a banquet in the hall of Björk&#x27;s personal erotics&quot; and stated that &quot;it&#x27;s not the stuff of radio hits, but the music is spectacular&quot;.

An enthusiastic review came from &quot;The Wire&quot;, which felt that: &quot;In the end, &quot;Vespertine&quot; commits its magic by daring to go places more obvious and more human than one would have ever expected.&quot; Calling it &quot;one of the most impressive and cohesive&quot; albums of the year, &quot;Tiny Mix Tapes&quot; found &quot;Vespertine&quot; to be Björk&#x27;s most effective use of the studio as an instrument. Chris Smith of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; praised the album for its nuance and delicacy, describing its sonic palette as &quot;a breath of fresh air.&quot; Additionally, &quot;Vespertine&quot; was thought to have challenged gender roles in rock music and in sexuality.

&quot;Q&quot; also praised the album, stating that it &quot;quietly proves that cutting-edge production and human contact aren&#x27;t mutually exclusive.&quot; American music journalist Robert Christgau enjoyed the album&#x27;s central theme of sex and wrote: &quot;when she gets all soprano on your ass you could accuse her of spirituality&quot;. A more lukewarm review came from &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Ryan Schreiber, who felt that: &quot;while undeniably beautiful, &quot;Vespertine&quot; fails to give electronic music the forward push it received on Björk&#x27;s preceding albums&quot;. David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said &quot;her lyrics occasionally dive into the deep end&quot; and &quot;her voice is at times stiff&quot;, although he also wrote &quot;when it all comes together, [...] Björk and her electronica collaborators create moving interplanetary chorals&quot;. &quot;Almost Cool&quot; wrote: &quot;if there&#x27;s one question to be raised with the album, it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s all simply so lush and nice that on some levels it fails to excite&quot;.

In a 2015 interview with &quot;The Pitchfork Review&quot;, Björk said that her work on &quot;Vespertine&quot; was not fully acknowledged by press, she further added, &quot;Matmos came in the last two weeks and added percussion on top of the songs, but they didn&#x27;t do any of the main parts, and they are credited &quot;everywhere&quot; as having done the whole album.&quot;.

=== Accolades ===
In 2002, &quot;Vespertine&quot; was nominated for the Shortlist Music Prize, though the award went to &quot;In Search of...&quot; by N.E.R.D. The same year, the album received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Alternative Album, losing to Coldplay&#x27;s &quot;Parachutes&quot;. In addition, Björk was nominated for Best International Female Solo Artist at the Brit Awards, and Best International Female Artist at the Italian Music Awards, while &quot;Vespertine&quot; was nominated for Album of the Year at the Icelandic Music Awards.

<text>The National Arts Centre (NAC) () is a performing arts organization in Ottawa, Ontario, along the Rideau Canal. It is based in the eponymous National Arts Centre building.

==History==
The NAC was one of several projects launched by the government of Lester B. Pearson to commemorate Canada&#x27;s 1967 centenary. It opened its doors to the public for the first time on May 31, 1969, at a cost of C$46 million.

In February 2014, the centre unveiled a new logo and slogan, &quot;Canada is our stage,&quot; in preparation for its fiftieth anniversary in 2019. The former logo had been designed by Montreal graphic designer Ernst Roch and had been in use since the centre&#x27;s opening.

In October 2015, initial talks about plans to develop an Indigenous theatre were held between NAC leadership, Indigenous performers and community leaders from across Canada with the aim of making Indigenous theatre a core activity of the National Arts Centre. In June 2017, Kevin Loring was hired to be the first artistic director of the NAC Indigenous Theatre department. Lori Marchand was appointed the first managing director of the department soon after. Along with Lindsay Lachance, an artistic associate, the Indigenous Theatre department works to increase the representation of Indigenous peoples through theatre and provide further space and resources for Indigenous actors and playwrights to thrive. To date, over $1 million has been raised to establish the Indigenous Theatre department through a tribute dinner hosted by the NAC in June 2018. The first full season of the Indigenous theatre department commenced in the fall of 2019.

== Departments ==

=== Orchestra ===
The National Arts Centre Orchestra is a world-class ensemble of outstanding classical musicians from across Canada and around the world, led by music director, Alexander Shelley. Since its debut in 1969 at the opening of Canada’s National Arts Centre, the Orchestra has been praised for the passion and clarity of its performances, its groundbreaking educational programs, and its leadership in nurturing Canadian creativity.

=== Indigenous Theatre ===
Kevin Loring is the current director of the Indigenous Theatre. Loring is Nlaka&#x27;pamux from Lytton, British Columbia, a small town in the Fraser Canyon and was born November 24, 1974. His first published play, &quot;Where The Blood Mixes&quot;, won the Governor General&#x27;s Award for English-language drama in 2009. He is also the Artistic Director of The Savage Society. When asked what Indigenous theatre is, he says that it is “Our stories told and performed through the lens of Indigenous people&quot;.

The Indigenous Theatre&#x27;s first production, co-presented by the NAC English Theatre, was in September 2019 when Muriel Miguel directed Marie Clements&#x27; &quot;The Unnatural and Accidental Women&quot;. The production starred PJ Prudat as Rebecca and Monique Mojica as Aunt Shadie and also featured Yolanda Bonnell, Columpa C. Bobb, and Cheri Maracle.

Notable figures in the Indigenous theatre department include:

* Kevin Loring: playwright, actor and teacher, winner of the Governor General&#x27;s Award for English-language drama for his play, &quot;Where the Blood Mixes&quot; in 2009
* Lori Marchand: former director of Western Canada Theatre and daughter of Leonard Marchand, the first Indigenous Member of Parliament in Canada
* Lindsay Lachance: PhD candidate and sessional lecturer in theatre at the University of British Columbia and Simon Fraser University

== Artistic aims and performances ==
One of Canada&#x27;s most extensive performing arts facilities, the National Arts Centre displays ballets, orchestras, theatre and musical performances. At , the NAC works with thousands of artists, both emerging and established, from across Canada and around the world and collaborates with dozens of other arts organizations across the country. The NAC operates in the performing arts fields of classical music, English theatre, French theatre, Indigenous theatre, dance, variety, and community programming. The NAC supports programs for young and emerging artists and programs for young audiences and produces resources and study materials for teachers. The NAC is the only multidisciplinary, multilingual performing arts centre in North America and one of the largest in the world.

The National Arts Centre is home to the National Arts Centre Orchestra, considered one of the world&#x27;s leading classical-size orchestras. Alexander Shelley, a conductor, pianist, cellist and teacher, has been the orchestra&#x27;s music director since 2015. Jean Roberts was the artistic director of the English theatre (1975-77), followed by John Wood (1977-84). Andis Celms was a theatre producer (1984-97), and Marti Maraden served as artistic director of English theatre from 1997 to 2005. Peter Hinton succeeded Maraden in November 2005, followed by Jillian Keiley in 2012. The current artistic director of English Theatre is Nina Lee Aquino; the artistic director of French Theatre is Mani Soleymanlou (who succeeded Brigitte Haentjens in 2021); Caroline Ohrt is the executive producer of dance (succeeding Cathy Levy in 2023); Heather Moore is producer and executive director of the Scene Festivals; Heather Gibson is producer of NAC Presents. The National Arts Centre produces nine podcasts in both official languages. They cover French and English theatre and classical and contemporary Canadian music. The NAC has since created an Indigenous Theatre discipline. On June 15, 2017, Kevin Loring was announced as the first Artistic Director of Indigenous Theatre.

Kurt Waldele was executive chef for two decades until his death in 2009. His successor Michael Blackie, was responsible for creating &quot;Celebrity Chefs of Canada,&quot; which ran in both 2011 and 2012. In late 2012, Michael left the NAC to develop his own business in Ottawa, located on the city&#x27;s west end and called NeXT. In 2013, John Morris was promoted to the position of executive chef. John Morris worked under chefs David Garcelon, Michael Blackie and Steven Gugelmeier. Kenton Leier was appointed as Executive Chef, effective July 26, 2017.

The National Arts Centre is a co-producer of the Canada Dance Festival and co-founder of the Magnetic North Theatre Festival, which operates in partnership with the Canadian Theatre Festival Society. The Magnetic North Theatre Festival is an annual event first held in Ottawa in 2003 and is held every in other Canadian cities in alternating years. The festival offers not only productions and performances for the theatre-going public, but offers workshops and seminars aimed at theatre students and professionals.

In 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, the NAC created the series &quot;Undisrupted&quot; for CBC Gem, which featured four Canadian performers or composers of classical or opera music creating a short film set to a new original composition.

<text>Talisman Dungeon is an expansion set published by Games Workshop in 1987 for the second edition of the &quot;Talisman&quot; board game.
==Description==
&quot;Talisman Dungeon&quot; is a supplement for the &quot;Talisman&quot; game that can also be used as a small stand-alone game. It is the only &quot;Talisman&quot; supplement that was designed by Bob Harris, the designer of the original game.

===Components===
It comes with the following components:
* separate board with the Dungeon track
* 36-card &quot;Dungeon&quot; deck
* 4 &quot;Doorway&quot; cards
* 14 new characters
** Conjurer
** Dark Elf
** Gipsy
** Highlander
** Inquisitor
** Martial artist
** Pirate
** Saracen
** Scout
** Sprite
** Spy
** Swashbuckler
** Swordsman
** Zulu
These new characters can be used in any game of &quot;Talisman&quot;.

===Setup===
To use it as part of a &quot;Talisman&quot; game, the Dungeon board and Dungeon deck are set up beside the regular &quot;Talisman&quot; board, and the four &quot;Doorway&quot; cards are shuffled into the main &quot;Talisman&quot; &quot;Adventure&quot; deck.

===Gameplay===
When a player draws a &quot;Doorway&quot; card, they have the option of entering the dungeon or staying on the main &quot;Talisman&quot; board. If they choose to enter the Dungeon, they must complete the spiral track on the Dungeon board that leads to the central Treasure Chamber. From there, the player is transported back to the main board, possibly closer to the Crown of Command, but also possibly further away.

While in the Dungeon, certain special rules apply — for example, mules and horses are not allowed, and the Blizzard does not affect players in the Dungeon. Some spells and character abilities are nullified or altered within the Dungeon.

===Stand-alone game===
There is an option to play &quot;Dungeon&quot; on its own. Characters start at the entrance to the dungeon and race to the Treasure Chamber. The first one to arrive is the winner. Unlike the normal game, character cannot encounter one another.

==Reception==
In the September 1987 edition of &quot;White Dwarf&quot; (Issue #93), Graeme Davis found the artwork of both the board and the cards to be &quot;well-done and maintains the feel of the basic game.&quot; Davis also thought some of the locations on the Dungeon board to be interesting. He found that although there were new rules for the Dungeon board, they &quot;set all this out clearly and they are soon picked up.&quot; He found all of the encounters, from rats to a Bronze dragon, &quot;all work well — as you would expect in an expansion game from Bob Harris, the game&#x27;s inventor.&quot; Davis concluded with a strong recommendation, saying, &quot;&quot;The Talisman Dungeon&quot; is a significant addition to the game. Hardened &quot;Talisman&quot; fans will probably agree that it&#x27;s the best expansion set yet, and if you own the game, it&#x27;s definitely worth looking at.&quot;

Stewart Wieck reviewed &quot;Talisman Dungeon&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #9 (1988), rating it an 8 out of 10 and stated that &quot;Players of &quot;Talisman&quot; should certainly consider purchasing this expansion set. It is probably the most worthwhile of all the available expansions as it truly does add to the scope of the game. Those who do not even own &quot;Talisman&quot; should get both the game and &quot;Talisman Dungeon&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="487011" wikidata="Q1139456" url="?curid=487011" title="Credo">
<text>In Christian liturgy, the credo (; Latin for &quot;I believe&quot;) is the portion of the Mass where a creed is recited or sung. The Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed or the Apostles&#x27; Creed are the primary creeds used for this purpose.

==History==
After the formulation of the Nicene Creed, its initial liturgical use was in baptism, which explains why the text uses the singular &quot;I ...&quot; instead of &quot;we ...&quot;. The text was gradually incorporated into the liturgies, first in the east and in Spain, and gradually into the north, from the sixth to the ninth centuries. In 1014 it was accepted by the Church of Rome as a legitimate part of the Mass. It is recited in the Western Mass directly after the homily on all Sundays and solemnities; in modern celebrations of the Tridentine Mass as an extraordinary form of the Roman Rite, the Credo is recited on all Sundays, feasts of the I class, II class feasts of the Lord and of the Blessed Virgin, on the days within the octaves of Christmas, Easter, and Pentecost, and on the &quot;birthday&quot; feasts of the apostles and evangelists (including the feasts of St. Peter&#x27;s Chair and of St. Barnabas). It is recited in the Orthodox Liturgy following the Litany of Supplication on all occasions.

Probably because of its late adoption, and the length of the text (the longest in the Ordinary of the Mass), there are relatively few chant settings of it. What is identified as &quot;Credo I&quot; in the &quot;Liber Usualis&quot; was apparently widely considered the only authentic Credo, and it is the element of the ordinary that was most strongly associated with a single melody. The &quot;Liber Usualis&quot; contains only two other settings, designated as &quot;Credo V&quot; and &quot;Credo VI,&quot; which is far fewer than for other settings of the Ordinary.

In musical settings of the Credo, as in the Gloria, the first line is intoned by the celebrant alone (&quot;Credo in unum Deum&quot;), or by a soloist, while the choir or congregation joins in with the second line. This tradition continued through the Middle Ages and Renaissance, and is even followed in more recent settings. In Stravinsky&#x27;s Mass, for example, a soloist intones the first line, which is from the plainchant Credo I. In Mass settings of the Baroque, Classical and Romantic period the Credo line is usually set for whole choir, such as in the &quot;Symbolum Nicenum&quot; (Nicene Creed) of Bach&#x27;s Mass in B minor, where the composer uses plainchant as the theme for a fugue, in the later Masses of Haydn, and the &quot;Missa Solemnis&quot; of Beethoven.

The melody of Credo I first appears in eleventh-century manuscripts, but it is believed to be much older, and perhaps Greek in origin. It is almost entirely syllabic, probably because of the length of the text, and consists of a great deal of repetition of melodic formulas.

In polyphonic settings of the Mass, the Credo is usually the longest movement, but is usually set more homophonically than other movements, probably because the length of the text demanded a more syllabic approach, as was seen with chant as well. A few composers (notably Heinrich Isaac) have set Credos independently from the rest of the ordinary, presumably to allow their insertion into &quot;missae breves&quot; or their omission where a said or chanted Credo is the custom.

==Musical settings==

Settings of alternative texts as a Credo outside the Mass, as a motet, are extremely rare. The first published polyphonic settings of the Symbolum Apostolorum were settings by the French composer Le Brung in 1540, and two further settings by the Spanish composer Fernando de las Infantas in 1578.

<text>Verner Panton (13 February 1926 – 5 September 1998) is considered one of Denmark&#x27;s most influential 20th-century furniture and interior designers. During his career, he created innovative and futuristic designs in a variety of materials, especially plastics, and in vibrant and exotic colors. His style was very &quot;1960s&quot; but regained popularity at the end of the 20th century. As of 2004, Panton&#x27;s best-known furniture models are still in production (at Vitra, among others).

==Biography==
Panton was already an experienced artist in Odense when he went to study architecture at the Royal Danish Academy of Art (&quot;Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi&quot;) in Copenhagen, graduating in 1951. During the first two years of his career, 1950–1952, he worked at the architectural practice of Arne Jacobsen, another Danish architect and furniture designer. Panton turned out to be an &quot;enfant terrible&quot; and he started his own design and architectural office. He became well known for his innovative architectural proposals, including a collapsible house (1955), the Cardboard House and the Plastic House (1960). Near the end of the 1950s, his chair designs became much more unconventional, with no legs or discernible back. In 1960 Panton was the designer of the very first single-form injection-moulded plastic chair. The &quot;Stacking chair&quot; or &quot;S chair&quot; was mass-produced and became the most famous of his designs derived from organic shapes echoing curves of the human body – in this case the tongue.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Verner Panton experimented with designing entire environments: radical and psychedelic interiors that were an ensemble of his curved furniture, wall upholstering, textiles and lighting. He is perhaps best known for a series of interior designs for Bayer&#x27;s yearly product exhibition, held aboard excursion boats.

== Career ==
From 1950 to 1952, Verner Panton worked for the architect Arne Jacobsen, who became another important mentor. While at Jacobsen&#x27;s office, Panton worked primarily in furniture design- specifically, the development of the ‘Ant’ chair. Following his employment with Jacobsen, Panton took a number of extensive trips throughout Europe over the course of three years. During this time, he establishes a number of international contacts with design colleagues, manufacturers, and dealers. From this, Panton is given a large number of architectural and furniture designs including the Bachelor Chair and Tivoli Chair commissioned by prestigious Danish furniture manufacturer Fritz Hansen in 1955.

In the mid-Fifties Verner Panton for the first time occupied himself with the idea of a chair made from one single element. In 1956 the Neue Gemeinschaft für Wohnkultur (WK-Möbel) organized a competition in which Panton participated. His entry was an entire furniture collection, which also included a stackable chair in which the seat and backrest formed a single unit. This is the project from which the so-called &#x27;S-Chair&#x27; is derived. The competition entry itself was not successful, with his designs failing to win a prize. In 1957, a prefabricated weekend house is produced as a small series called the All Round House.

In 1958, Panton redesigned his parents’ inn, Kom-igen in the Langesø Park on the island of Fünen, for which he also designed the Cone Chair. The Kom-igen inn was one of Panton&#x27;s first major commissions. Panton designed the interior as well as a one-floor extension with a roof terrace. He used five different shades of red for the interior to give it warmth while including dark colors for the table linens. Panton developed a flexible system made of fabrics with geometrical patterns to hang from the ceiling to divide up the room. From this, began the start of the cooperation with the Danish firms of Plus-Linje (Cone Chair series furniture), Unika Væv (textiles) and Louis Poulsen (lighting).

Panton designed the Astoria Hotel restaurant in Trondheim, Norway in 1960 which included the entry area with the cloakroom, the day restaurant with the wintergarten, an evening restaurant with dance floor as well as a self-service restaurant. Panton used textile design for floors, walls and ceilings in order to give the room a uniform image. The chairs were various versions of the cone chairs. During this time, Panton also designs the first inflatable seating elements made of transparent plastic in furniture history.In 1961, Panton presents his furniture, textiles and lamps in the legendary black book of the design magazine Mobilia and in the Pfister furniture showrooms in Zurich. The Shell Lamps are first presented on Lüber&#x27;s stand in Frankfurt in 1964. During the International Furniture Fair in Cologne, the Flying Chairs are the absolute sensation. In 1965, Thonet produced the S-Chair (Model 275) by Panton which became the first cantilever chair made of molded plywood. This stackable chair was made of plywood which the edge of the seat was slightly tilted upwards. There are two different versions of the S Chair: Model 275 and Model 276. In 1965/66, the design of a modular furniture system made of foam plastic sections, which is manufactured from 1967 by Kill, Metzeler and sold by the Kaufhof chain.The Danish design magazine Mobilia presented the Panton Chair to the public for the first time in 1967. Design of the exhibition on the Dralon ship (later renamed Visiona 0) for Bayer on the occasion of the Cologne Furniture Fair. The Flower Pot lamp is produced. Design for the offices of the Spiegel publishing house. The Living Tower is presented at a joint exhibition with Charles Eames, Joe Colombo and others at the Louvre in Paris. For the Spiegel Publishing House, which moved into the modernized premises in 1969 in Hamburg&#x27;s Ost-West Street, Panton designed the entrance area with courtyard and lobby, the canteen and the bar areas, the swimming pool for the employees in the basement of the building, the rooms for the editorial conferences and the lounges, as well as the colour schemes for the hallways of the administration or editorial highrise buildings. Design of the Visiona 2 (1970) exhibition for Bayer on the occasion of the Cologne Furniture Fair, where the first Mira X collection is also on show. Redesign of the Varna Restaurant, Arhus DK

== Projects ==
=== Astoria Hotel and restaurant in Trondheim, Norway ===
The design of the Hotel and Restaurant Astoria in Trondheim included the entry area with the cloakroom, the day restaurant with the wintergarten, an evening restaurant with dance floor as well as a self-service restaurant. Panton used the textile design Geometry I to IV for floors, walls and ceilings in order to give the room a uniform image. The chairs are various versions of the cone chairs. The chairs grouped around the tables and the Topan lights work together to divide the large room into individual seating areas with an intimate note.

=== Visiona I &amp; Visiona II ===
From the end of the Sixties to the mid-Seventies Bayer corporation hired a Rhine excursion steamer during every Cologne furniture fair and commissioned a well-known designer to transform it into a temporary showroom. The main purpose was the promotion of various synthetics used in home furnishings. Bayer&#x27;s Dralon synthetic fibre and its applications in the field of home textiles played a prominent part in the exhibition. As a result, the showroom was initially called the &#x27;Dralon ship&#x27;, until at Panton&#x27;s suggestion it came to be known from 1969 as &#x27;Visiona&#x27;. Panton, who was commissioned to design the ship in 1968, found ways from the very beginning to get round any excessive restriction to the field of textiles. By integrating furniture and lighting in his presentation he created atmospherically dense spaces in which colour and light played a dominant role. As early as the Visiona 0 exhibition Panton created experimental interior landscapes in which he was able to freely implement and demonstrate his design ideas, which were often interpreted as utopian. As a result, the &#x27;Dralon ship&#x27; caused a sensation among visitors well beyond narrow specialist circles.

Verner Panton was commissioned no less than twice to design this exhibition, entitled &#x27;Visiona&#x27;. The 1970 &#x27;Visona 2&#x27; exhibition showed the Fantasy Landscape which was created in this environment. The resulting room installation consisting of vibrant colours and organic forms is one of the principal highlights of Panton&#x27;s work. In terms of design history this installation is regarded as one of the major spatial designs of the second half of the twentieth century.

The creative fireworks which Panton lit with his studio within a preparation time of only a few months for &#x27;Visiona 2&#x27; is expressed not only in the highly diversified room designs in the exhibition ship, but also in the wide range of furniture, lighting, wall coverings and textiles developed specially for this presentation. Some of these were adapted and went into series production later.

=== Spiegel Publishing House ===
The furnishing of the Spiegel Publishing house buildings in Hamburg count among the most outstanding examples of Panton&#x27;s interior designs and are some of the few that still exist, at least in part. For the famous news magazine which moved into the modernized premises in 1969 in Hamburg&#x27;s Ost-West Street, Panton designed the entrance area with courtyard and lobby, the canteen and the bar areas, the swimming pool for the employees in the basement of the building, the rooms for the editorial conferences and the lounges, as well as the color schemes for the hallways of the administration or editorial high-rise buildings. Here again the color schemes became a major design element, providing Panton&#x27;s typical fusion of room design. All designs were his own – lamps, textiles and wall claddings, only the furniture had to be ordered from Knoll International according to his contracts. The specially designed mirror lighting used on walls and ceilings was of major importance. While the swimming pool area was destroyed soon afterwards by a fire and the entry and lobby saw major redesign in the 90s, the canteen has so far remained in the original version and today represents a unique and valuable historic document.

=== Private House at Binningen ===
The rooms open to guests in this mansion were designed by Panton in such a way that they acted as a kind of showroom for his work. Particularly noticeable were the entrance hall with its ringed lamps, the dining room with a spectacular shell ceiling, and the large dining room. This was dominated by the Living Sculpture which today is part of the design collection of the Centre Pompidou in Paris.

=== Gruner &amp; Jahr Publishing House, Hamburg ===

The commission to design the new head office of the publishers Gruner &amp; Jahr in Hamburg was as extensive as that for the Spiegel publishing company a few years earlier. Whereas in the design of the offices Panton restricted himself to a simple system of colours and patterns, in the entrance hall and canteen he once more succeeded in using visual trompe l&#x27;oeil effects to create impressive and surprising interior design solutions. In the lobby the eye was caught by a mirrored ceiling from which apparently innumerable VP Globe lamps were suspended, and in the canteen the carpeting with its wave design gave the floor a three-dimensional appearance.

=== Pantorama ===
In 1979 Panton was able to create the special &#x27;Pantorama&#x27; exhibition as part of the Swiss furniture fair in Basel. Here he created monochrome colour spaces in which simple geometrical fixtures and objects set up an atmosphere which was at the same time archaic and highly artificial.

=== Colour Spaces ===
In the &quot;Colour spaces&quot; installation, which Panton showed at Gallery Littmann in Basel in 1996, he demonstrated the power of colour in a physical way. Walking through the sequence of eight circular rooms, each of which was painted in a single colour, visitors were able to perceive the effect of colour, now warming, now cooling. This tunnel of colour was supplemented by foam elements in different shapes and colours, which were spread around a black room like over-sized building blocks.

=== Exhibition Light and Colour at the Trapholt ===
The &#x27;Light and colour&#x27; exhibition which opened at the Trapholt Museum on 17 September 1998, only a few days after Panton&#x27;s death, was his last design project. In eight colourful rooms, which once more provided an impressive demonstration of his masterly use of colours, Panton presented a representative cross section of his entire creation as a designer.

<text>A bouldering mat or crashpad (also sketchpad) is a nylon-enclosed multi-layer foam pad used for protection when bouldering. Bouldering mats help prevent climbers from injuring themselves from the continuous and repeated falls onto hard or uneven surfaces that are associated with projecting a bouldering problem. 

Some modern pads include a hinge to fold the pad over into a more compact form (a &#x27;hinge mat&#x27;), and some also come with shoulder straps. and even waist straps, for easier carrying to and from the bouldering area. The first commercially available bouldering mat, the &quot;Kinnaloa Sketchpad&quot;, was designed and produced in 1992. 

==Design==

Modern bouldering mats are made in a wide range of sizes and styles (and colors) and can be up to in thickness, and up to in surface area (at the larger end). 

&quot;Bi-fold&quot; mats (and even &quot;tri-fold&quot; mats), allow the bouldering pad to be more easily transported to the bouldering area, however, the use of any &quot;hinge&quot; for easier folding introduces a point of weakness. The term &#x27;taco mat&#x27; is a single-section foam pad that bends in the middle when folded but has no hinge (&#x27;burrito mats&#x27; fold in three), while &#x27;hinge mats&#x27; are pads with separate sections of foam connected by a hinge.

Bouldering mats and crashpads typically have two or three different layers of polyurethane foam that are enclosed in a tough outer skin of typically 600 to 1000 denier nylon, or equivalent material like cordura. Softer &#x27;open-celled&#x27; foam below firmer, higher-density &#x27;closed-cell&#x27; foam will prevent a climber&#x27;s foot from sinking through the foam and either impacting the ground or getting stuck in the mat, which would increase the chance of injury. The foam itself comes in various thicknesses, with smaller thinner mats used for sit starts, to cover gaps between larger mats, and/or to keep shoes clean and off the bare earth. 

Modern bouldering mats—and particularly the larger ones—usually come with some form of shoulder straps, and even waist straps, so that the mats can be comfortably carried on the climber&#x27;s back while hiking to and from the bouldering areas. Some mats also include pockets for storage or straps that allow climbers to turn the pad into a day-pack with their bouldering gear stuffed inside the folds.

==Use==

A unique aspect of bouldering is the general lack of any requirement for climbing protection equipment that is associated with most other forms of rock climbing, such as sport climbing or traditional climbing. While bouldering is essentially a free solo climbing format, the continuous and repeated falls associated with projecting a bouldering problem can damage the heel, ankles, shins (e.g. shin splints), and knees. Bouldering mats are particularly important where the ground is very hard, uneven, and/or the fall area is littered with rocks. They are also very common in indoor climbing walls. 

On boulders with potentially serious falls, such as in highball bouldering, the mats can be supported by spotters (see image), who try to ensure that a falling climber lands on the mats. It is common for modern boulderers to use multiple bouldering mats at a time to give complete coverage of the fall area below a bouldering problem.

There is some concern amongst climbers about the excessive use of bouldering mats and in particular the employment of &#x27;stacking&#x27; (i.e. layers of mats in a vertical pile), and whether &#x27;stacked&#x27; mats are akin aid climbing that could help with a difficult &#x27;first move&#x27; on a route, and whether the use of &#x27;stacked&#x27; mats reduces the objective danger—and thus the technical grade and challenge—of a given traditional climbing or highball bouldering route. In 2023, Austrian climber wrote in &quot;Climbing&quot; regarding the use of excess bouldering mats, &quot;Today, we see landing zones resembling construction sites&quot;, and adding: &quot;... I wonder if it wouldn&#x27;t be more honest just to toprope?&quot;.

==Origin==

The earliest bouldering mats are associated with the Hueco Tanks bouldering area, and its bouldering pioneer John Sherman. In a 2022 interview with &quot;Climbing&quot;, Sherman credited El Paso-based boulder climbers, Donny Hardin and Fred Nakovic, for the original idea &quot;after a heel-bruising session not at Hueco, but City of Rocks, New Mexico&quot;. In 1992, Sherman and Bruce Pottenger, from Bishop-based climbing gear manufacturer Kinnaloa, designed the first commercially available bouldering mat/crashpad with the &quot;nylon sleeve, carrying straps, dual-density replaceable foam&quot; that would become the standard design in bouldering, which they sold as the &quot;Kinnaloa Sketchpad&quot; (&#x27;sketchpad&#x27; was a slang used in the area for prototype/cumtomized mats). 

By 2019, &quot;Climbing Magazine&quot; estimated that there were over 50 manufacturers of bouldering mats/crashpads worldwide.

<doc id="487030" wikidata="Q61747417" url="?curid=487030" title="Government of Jersey">
<text>The Government of Jersey () is the executive body of the States of Jersey and is the central government of the Bailiwick of Jersey. The government is led by the Chief Minister (currently Lyndon Farnham, since 2024), who nominates all the remaining ministers, all elected by the States Assembly.

All Ministers of the Government are required to be elected States members and are accountable to it. They make statements in and take questions from the assembly. The government is dependent on the assembly to make primary legislation, however ministers can make secondary legislation, such as Orders and Regulations. The government is not formed of one single party, but made of multiple independent members.

The &#x27;Government of Jersey&#x27; is the official identity of the executive and administrative arm of the States of Jersey. The government no longer uses the term States of Jersey in reference to executive and administrative departments.

== History ==

Under the uncodified constitution of Jersey, executive power lies in the Council of Ministers, formed of the Chief Minister and his ministers. Before 2005, the States of Jersey held both legislative and executive power through committee-led government

Since the implementation of the &quot;States of Jersey (Jersey) Law 2005&quot;, the executive and legislative functions have been split between the Council of Ministers and States Assembly respectively. In 2019, the Council of Ministers formally adopted the identity of the &#x27;Government of Jersey&#x27; for the executive responsibilities of the States.

== Ministers ==

The decision-making body for the island&#x27;s government is the Council of Ministers. The Council lead the island&#x27;s executive and administrative governance. The ministers are nominated by the Chief Minister or by any States member and confirmed by the States Assembly. The States of Jersey (Jersey) Law 2005 establishes the role and function of ministers.

The administration of the Government is made up by a number of departments that may have more than one minister. The Ministers are responsible each for an area of policy. The Ministers provide policy direction to civil service officers, having given fair consideration and due weight to informed and impartial advice from such officer.

A new (or existing) Chief Minister is (re-)appointed after:

* every ordinary election of Deputies
* the previous Chief Minister ceases to be a States member
* the previous Chief Minister resigns, is incapacitated (for a period exceeding 8 weeks) or is deceased
* the States have no confidence in the Chief Minister or the whole Council

== One Government ==
Under the &#x27;One Government&#x27; structure implemented by former Government Chief Executive Charlie Parker, there are nine government departments.

In April 2018, the States approved changes to the Government machinery. The Chief Executive was appointed the Principal Accounting Officer for public finances, giving them the control and responsibility for government spending. The Government states this change has improved funding allocations and government transparency. In February 2022, the Democratic Accountability and Governance Sub-Committee.

The same proposition also proposed to make the Government a single legal entity. Currently, each Minister forms a single corporation sole, however when the changes are implemented (as they have been approved), &#x27;Jersey Ministers&#x27; as a single entity will become legally responsible for all areas of government. The argument in favour of this is that it will allow more cross-Ministerial working. However, some are worried that this move would lead to more centralisation of power in the Chief Minister and Chief Executive.

The OneGovernment structure has been criticised for blurring the lines of accountability in the Government and that the introduction of the reforms &#x27;have had a negative effect on governance&#x27; because departments are no longer necessarily have one political lead. On 28 April 2022, the States voted to scrap the One Government scheme and return to Minister-led government departments by the end of the year.

<text>Baron Hesketh, of Hesketh in the County Palatine of Lancaster, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1935 for Sir Thomas Fermor-Hesketh, 8th Baronet, who had previously briefly represented Enfield in the House of Commons as a Conservative. the titles are held by his grandson, the third Baron, who succeeded his father in 1955. Lord Hesketh held junior ministerial positions in the Conservative administrations of Margaret Thatcher and John Major. However, he lost his seat in the House of Lords after the House of Lords Act 1999 removed the automatic right of hereditary peers to sit in the upper chamber of Parliament.

The Hesketh baronetcy, of Rufford in the County Palatine of Lancaster, was created in the Baronetage of Great Britain in 1761 for Thomas Hesketh, with special remainder to his brother Robert, who succeeded him as second Baronet. The latter&#x27;s great-great-grandson, the fifth Baronet, sat as a Conservative Member of Parliament for Preston. His grandson, the eighth Baronet, was elevated to the peerage as Baron Hesketh in 1935.

The former seat of the Barons Hesketh was Easton Neston in Northamptonshire. The house was previously the seat of the Fermor family (Earls of Pomfret since 1721), and came into the Hesketh family through the marriage in 1846 of Sir Thomas George Hesketh, 5th Baronet, to Lady Anna Maria Isabella Fermor sister and heiress of George Richard William Fermor, 5th and last Earl of Pomfret. However, the house and all contents were sold by the current Baron in 2005.

The original seat of the Hesketh family was Rufford Old Hall in the village of Rufford in Lancashire. This house was sold to the National Trust by the first Baron Hesketh in 1936.

<text>The globus pallidus (GP), also known as paleostriatum or dorsal pallidum, is a major component of the subcortical basal ganglia in the brain. It consists of two adjacent segments, one external (or lateral), known in rodents simply as the globus pallidus, and one internal (or medial). It is part of the telencephalon, but retains close functional ties with the subthalamus in the diencephalon – both of which are part of the extrapyramidal motor system.

The globus pallidus receives principal inputs from the striatum, and principal direct outputs to the thalamus and the substantia nigra. The latter is made up of similar neuronal elements, has similar afferents from the striatum, similar projections to the thalamus, and has a similar synaptology. Neither receives direct cortical afferents, and both receive substantial additional inputs from the intralaminar thalamic nuclei.

Globus pallidus is Latin for &quot;pale globe&quot;.

==Structure==

Pallidal nuclei are made up of the same neuronal components. In primates, almost all pallidal neurons are very large, parvalbumin-positive, with very large dendritic arborizations. These have the peculiarity of having the three-dimensional shape of flat discs, parallel to one another, parallel to the border of the pallidum and perpendicular to the afferent striatopallidal axons. There are only a few small local circuitry neurons.

The globus pallidus is traversed by the numerous myelinated axons of the striatopallidonigral bundle that give it the pale appearance from which it is named.

The ultrastructure is very peculiar, as the long dendrites are everywhere, without discontinuity, covered by synapses.

===Parts===
In primates, the globus pallidus is divided into two parts by a thin medial medullary lamina. These are the internal globus pallidus (GPi) and the external globus pallidus (GPe); both are composed of closed nuclei surrounded by myelinic walls.

The ventral pallidum lies within the substantia innominata (Latin for unnamed substance) and receives efferent connections from the ventral striatum (the nucleus accumbens and the olfactory tubercle). It projects to the dorsomedial nucleus of the dorsal thalamus, which, in turn, projects to the prefrontal cortex; it also projects to the pedunculopontine nucleus and tegmental motor areas. Its function is to serve as a limbic-somatic motor interface, and it is involved in the planning and inhibition of movements from the dorsal striatopallidal complex.

==Function==
The globus pallidus is a structure in the brain involved in the regulation of voluntary movement. It is part of the basal ganglia, which, among many other functions, regulate movements that occur on the subconscious level.

The globus pallidus has a predominantly inhibitory effect on movement regulation, balancing cerebellar excitation. Pulsatile and regular interaction between these complementary systems allows smooth and controlled movement. Imbalances can result tremors, jerks, dystonia, chorea and progressive motor weakness ending in diaphragmatic dysfunction, with the most common cause of mortality in most neurodegenerative disorders being aspiration pneumonia.

The basal ganglia acts on a subconscious level, requiring no conscious effort to function. When someone makes a decision to engage in an activity such as petting a dog, for example, these structures help to regulate the movement to make it as smooth as possible, and to respond to sensory feedback. Likewise, the globus pallidus is involved in the constant subtle regulation of movement that allows people to walk and engage in a wide variety of other activities with a minimal level of disruption.

===Pallidonigral pacemaker===
The two pallidal nuclei and the two parts of the substantia nigra (the pars compacta and pars reticulata) constitute a high-frequency autonomous pacemaker. (see primate basal ganglia#Pallidonigral set and pacemaker)

===Common afferents===
The two parts receive successively a large quantity of GABAergic axonal terminal arborisations from the striatum through the dense striato-pallidonigral bundle. The synaptology is very peculiar (see primate basal ganglia system). The striatal afferents contribute more than 90% of synapses.
The two pallidal nuclei receive dopaminergic axons from the pars compacta of the substantia nigra.

===Pathway===
This area of the basal ganglia receives input from another area, called the striatum, which has two parts, the caudate nucleus and the putamen. This data is routed to the thalamus, either directly or indirectly. In the case of the interna, one area of the globus pallidus, the structure can feed directly to the thalamus. The externa, which lies on the outside of this structure, feeds information to the interna, where it can be passed on to the thalamus.

==Disease==
Infarction of the globus pallidus can be seen with anoxic brain injury, carbon monoxide poisoning and drug overdoses (MDMA and heroin), with the insult classically being bilateral. Bilateral calcification can occur in a lentiform shape with aggressive parenteral nutrition. Encephalopathy, as can occur with cirrhosis or Leigh syndrome, also causes globus pallidus abnormalities, making them bright on MRI T1 sequences in liver disease and on bright on T2 sequences with Leigh syndrome. Additional substances that can accumulate in the basal ganglia include heavy metals (such as gadolinium, iron and copper), calcium and amyloid with hypothyroidism.

Clumps of disorganized nerve tissue, can accumulate inside the globus pallidus with neurofibromatosis type I, causing severe neurologic dysfunction. The pallidus can also be destroyed by rare metabolic disorders such as PKAN, methylmalonic acidemias and maple syrup urine disease.

Though damage to the globus pallidus can cause movement disorders, diseases like Parkinson&#x27;s and essential tremor can paradoxically be treated by surgically inducing lesions in the nuclei using ultrasound, Gamma knife, or more rarely open surgery. The nucleus can also be artifically stimulated using deep brain stimulation in which a battery pack is inserted into the chest wall and electrical leads run up the neck and into the brain from the back of the skull. The aim of these procedures is to reduce involuntary muscle tremors and improve extrapyramidal symptoms associated with neurodegeneration, though they can impact intellectual function and cause dysarthria.

==History==
The origin of the name is not established. It was used by Joseph Dejerine (1906) but not by Santiago Ramón y Cajal (1909–1911).

As the elements in no way have the shape of a globe, throughout the 20th century scientists proposed a simpler term (a neuter adjective), &quot;pallidum&quot; (meaning &quot;pale&quot;). Propositions include those by Foix and Nicolesco (1925), the Vogts (1941), Crosby et al. (1962) and the &quot;Terminologia Anatomica&quot;.

For a long time the globus pallidus was linked to the putamen and termed the lentiform nucleus (nucleus lenticularis or lentiformis), a heterogeneous anatomical entity that is part of the striatum rather than the pallidum. The link with the substantia nigra pars reticulata was stressed very early on due to the similarities in dendritic arborisation (and they are sometimes known as the pallidonigral set) but, in spite of strong evidence, this association remains controversial.

==Animal Studies==
In rodents, the globus pallidus internus is also known as the entopeduncular nucleus.

<text>Baron Hazlerigg, of Noseley in the County of Leicester, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1945 for Sir Arthur Hazlerigg, 13th Baronet. He had previously served as Lord Lieutenant of Leicestershire. the title is held by his great-grandson, the fourth Baron, who succeeded his father in 2022.

The Hazlerigg baronetcy, of Noseley Hall in the County of Leicester, was created in the Baronetage of England in 1622 for Thomas Hesilrige. He notably represented Leicestershire in the House of Commons. He was succeeded by his son, the second Baronet, the most famous member of the family. He was one of the five members of Parliament whom King Charles I tried to have arrested in 1642, and was one of the most vocal advocates of parliamentary supremacy throughout the English Civil War and the Protectorate. His grandson, the fourth Baronet, also represented Leicestershire in Parliament. He was succeeded by his uncle, the fifth Baronet. The latter&#x27;s great-great-grandson, the eleventh Baronet, assumed by Royal licence the surname of Hazlerigg in lieu of Hesilrige in 1818. His great-grandson was the thirteenth Baronet, who was elevated to the peerage in 1945.

, the present holder of the barony has not successfully proven his succession to the baronetcy and is therefore not on the Official Roll of the Baronetage.

The family seat is Noseley Hall, near Noseley, Leicestershire.

<text>K3b (from KDE Burn Baby Burn) is a CD, DVD and Blu-ray authoring application by KDE for Unix-like computer operating systems. It provides a graphical user interface to perform most CD/DVD burning tasks like creating an Audio CD from a set of audio files or copying a CD/DVD, as well as more advanced tasks such as burning eMoviX CD/DVDs. It can also perform direct disc-to-disc copies. The program has many default settings which can be customized by more experienced users. The actual disc recording in K3b is done by the command line utilities cdrecord or cdrkit, cdrdao, and growisofs. As of version 1.0, K3b features a built-in DVD ripper.

As is the case with most KDE applications, K3b is written in the C++ programming language and uses the Qt GUI toolkit. Released under the GNU General Public License, K3b is free software.

A first alpha of a KDE Platform 4 version of K3b was released on 22 April 2009, the second on 27 May 2009 and a third on 14 October 2009.

<doc id="487061" wikidata="Q132634" url="?curid=487061" title="Vigna">
<text>Vigna is a genus of plants in the legume family, Fabaceae, with a pantropical distribution. It includes some well-known cultivated species, including many types of beans. Some are former members of the genus &quot;Phaseolus&quot;. According to &quot;Hortus Third&quot;, &quot;Vigna&quot; differs from &quot;Phaseolus&quot; in biochemistry and pollen structure, and in details of the style and stipules.

&quot;Vigna&quot; is also commonly confused with the genus &quot;Dolichos&quot;, but the two differ in stigma structure.

&quot;Vigna&quot; are herbs or occasionally subshrubs. The leaves are pinnate, divided into 3 leaflets. The inflorescence is a raceme of yellow, blue, or purple pea flowers. The fruit is a legume pod of varying shapes containing seeds.

Familiar food species include the adzuki bean (&quot;V. angularis&quot;), the black gram (&quot;V. mungo&quot;), the cowpea (&quot;V. unguiculata&quot;, including the variety known as the black-eyed pea), and the mung bean (&quot;V. radiata&quot;). Each of these may be used as a whole bean, a bean paste, or as bean sprouts.

The genus is named after Domenico Vigna, a seventeenth-century Italian botanist and director of the Orto botanico di Pisa.

==Uses==
Root tubers of &quot;Vigna&quot; species have traditionally been used as food by the Indigenous Peoples of the Northern Territory.

<text>John Curwen (14 November 1816 – 26 May 1880) was an English Congregationalist minister and diffuser of the tonic sol-fa system of music education created by Sarah Ann Glover. He was educated at Wymondley College in Hertfordshire, then Coward College as that institution became known when it moved to London, and finally University College London.

==Background and biography==
John Curwen was a descendant of the Curwens of Workington Hall in Cumbria, one of the oldest families in England, the male line proper being a direct descent from Eldred, a pre-Norman Englishman, whose son Ketel held lands in the Barony of Kendal. Orm, Ketel&#x27;s son, inherited the Cumbrian manor of Workington.

Curwen was born 14 November 1816, at Heckmondwike, West Riding of Yorkshire, the son of Spedding Curwen and Mary Jubb. His father was a Non-conformist minister, as John was also from 1838 until 1864. Curwen gave up full-time ministry to devote himself to his new method of musical nomenclature.

He established the Tonic Sol-Fa Press in Plaistow, where he had been a minister, and in 1879 the Tonic Sol-Fa college (later the Forest Gate School of Music) in Forest Gate.

Curwen married Mary Thompson (1816–1890) in May 1845. They had four children – Margaret, John Spencer, Spedding and Thomas Herbert. Curwen died at Heaton Mersey, Stockport on 26 May 1880. His son John Spencer married Annie Jessy Gregg, who went on to write the extensive and influential series &quot;Mrs. Curwen&#x27;s Pianoforte Method&quot; based on her adaptation for the piano of John Curwen&#x27;s method for voice.

==Tonic sol-fa==

Curwen&#x27;s system was designed to aid in sight reading of the stave with its lines and spaces. He adapted it from a number of earlier musical systems, including the Norwich Sol-fa method of Sarah Ann Glover (1785–1867) of Norwich. Her Sol-fa system was based on the ancient gamut; but she omitted the constant recital of the alphabetical names of each note and the arbitrary syllable indicating key relationship, and also the recital of two or more such syllables when the same note was common to as many keys (e.g. C, Fa, Ut, meaning that C is the subdominant of G and the tonic of C). The notes were represented by the initials of the seven syllables, still in use in Italy and France as their names. Curwen taught himself to sight-read based on Glover&#x27;s Norwich Sol-fa, made alterations and improvements, and named his method &quot;Tonic Sol-fa&quot;. In the Tonic Sol-fa the seven letters refer to key relationship (relative pitch) and not to absolute pitch. Curwen utilised the first letter (lower case) of each of the solmisation tones (do, re, me, fa, sol, la, ti), and a rhythmic system that used bar lines (prefixing strong beats), half bar lines (prefixing medium beats), and semicolons (prefixing weak beats) in each measure.

Curwen felt the need for a simple way of teaching how to sing by note through his experiences among Sunday school teachers. Stemming from his religious and social beliefs, Curwen thought that music should be easily accessible to all classes and ages of people. Apart from Glover, similar ideas had been elaborated in France by Pierre Galin (1786–1821), Aimé Paris (1798–1866) and Emile Chevé (1804–1864), whose method of teaching how to read at sight (the Galin-Paris-Chevé system) also depended on the principle of tonic relationship being taught by the reference of every sound to its tonic, and by the use of a numeric notation. Curwen adapted French time names from Paris&#x27; &quot;Langue de durées&quot;.

==Curwen&#x27;s publications==
Curwen brought out his &quot;Grammar of Vocal Music&quot; in 1843, and in 1853 started the Tonic Sol-Fa Association. The &quot;Standard Course of Lessons on the Tonic Sol-fa Method of Teaching to Sing&quot; was published in 1858. In 1879 the Tonic Sol-Fa College was opened. Curwen also began publishing, and brought out a periodical called the &quot;Tonic Sol-fa Reporter and Magazine of Vocal Music for the People&quot;, and in his later life was occupied in directing the spreading organisation of his system. With his son, John Spencer Curwen (1847–1916) who later became principal of the Tonic Sol-Fa College, Curwen incorporated the J. Curwen &amp; Sons publishing firm in 1863. This firm continued as the Curwen Press into the 1970s, when it was closed. The Sol-fa system was widely adopted for use in education, as an easily teachable method in the reading of music at sight, but its more ambitious aims for providing a superior method of musical notation have not been generally adopted. In 1872, Curwen changed his former course of using the Sol-fa system as an aid to sight reading, when that edition of his &quot;Standard Course of Lessons&quot; excluded the staff and relied solely on Curwen&#x27;s Tonic Sol-fa system.

Curwen technically did not invent Tonic Sol-fa. Rather he developed a distinct method of applying it in music education, including both rhythm and pitch. The name and current form can be traced to Curwen.

==Memorial==
Curwen is remembered in Heckmondwike with a memorial in the Green Park and by the John Curwen Cooperative Primary, by Curwen Primary School in Plaistow, London, and by Curwen Crescent, and in 2007 a new housing development in the north of the town was named Curwen Park.

<text>Emo Philips (born Philip Soltanec, February 7, 1956) is an American stand-up comedian and actor. His stand-up comedy persona makes use of paraprosdokians spoken in a wandering falsetto tone of voice.

== Career ==
The character of Emo Philips appears as a fidgety, possibly mentally disturbed, nervous but highly intelligent individual. Philips constantly moves throughout the routine, often shifting from sitting to standing positions, wandering from end to end on stage, playing with his hair or clothing, or going as far as to partially undress as he delivers punchlines. His comedy, which is largely self-deprecating, is often delivered in a modulated falsetto. His look (occasionally described as geeky, disco and vaudeville-inspired), particularly his hair—a 1970s-style bob with straight-lined front fringe—has been a signature part of his appearance and act for most of his career.

Philips has recorded three comedy albums. His album &quot;E=mo²&quot;, recorded live at Caroline&#x27;s in Manhattan, New York City won the 1985 New Music Award for best comedy album. It was later re-released along with his &quot;Live at the Hasty Pudding Theatre&quot; album on a single CD. He also released an album called &quot;Emo&quot; in 2001. A joke of his was voted funniest religious joke ever in a 2005 online poll. In 2006, he appeared at the Newbury Comedy Festival. He was included in the top 50 of &quot;E4&quot;″s 100 Greatest Comedians, and also appeared number 54 on Channel 4&#x27;s top 100 greatest standups.

<doc id="487079" wikidata="Q7225133" url="?curid=487079" title="Political unions involving Sweden">
<text>Sweden has for political and dynastic reasons been in union with other kingdoms and princely states, ostensibly personal unions.

==Norway (I)==

In 1319 the infant Magnus Eriksson was crowned as king of both Sweden and Norway (which included Iceland and Greenland). In 1332 when the King of Denmark Christopher II died as a &quot;king without a country&quot; after he had pawned Denmark piece by piece, King Magnus took advantage of his neighbour&#x27;s distress, redeeming the pawn for the eastern Danish provinces for a huge amount of silver. Magnus Eriksson would later on buy Skåneland from Denmark twice first time in 1332 and second time in 1341.The union of these two countries lasted until 1343 when Magnus preemptively let his son Haakon, succeed him to the Norwegian throne, though he would still rule as regent during his son&#x27;s minority, which ended in 1355, when Haakon came of age. In 1360 the Danish king Valdemar Atterdag reconquered Skåneland.

== Mecklenburg-Schwerin ==
In 1384 Albrekt of Mecklenburg (ca 1338-1412) was king of Sweden 1363-1389 and Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin 1384-1412. Briefly forming a personal union in 1384 to 1389.

==Kalmar Union==
In 1397 the three Scandinavian kingdoms of Sweden, Norway and Denmark were united in the Kalmar Union, a personal union agreed upon in the Swedish city of Kalmar. After only a few decades the relationship between Sweden and the leading power Denmark had deteriorated into open conflict. The period until the dissolution in 1521 was marked by the constant strife between Sweden and Denmark. The union was sometimes made defunct by Sweden electing a monarch separate from the union king, and on one occasion Sweden and Norway were even de facto united in a personal union in opposition to the union monarch.

==Poland-Lithuania==
In 1592 Sigismund succeeded his father John III of Sweden to the Swedish throne, but after the Polish election in 1587 and confirmation of GDL Natural and legal rights in 1588 he had also been elected king of Poland–Lithuania making him the monarch of both nations. Sigismund, who was a Roman Catholic failed however to gain support in Lutheran Sweden, and was eventually deposed and succeeded by his uncle Charles IX in Sweden 1599.

==Palatine Zweibrücken==
In 1654, Christina abdicated and was succeeded by her cousin Charles X, Duke of Palatine Zweibrücken. Sweden and Zweibrücken were also united under Charles XI and Charles XII, until the death of the latter in 1718, at which point he was succeeded by his sister Ulrike Eleonora on the Swedish throne, but not in his German Duchy.

== Grand Duchy of Lithuania ==
In 1655, Lithuania and Sweden signed the Treaty and Union of Kėdainiai. This personal union &quot;de facto&quot; established Lithuania as Sweden&#x27;s protectorate with Charles X Gustav serving as its Grand Duke of Lithuania. Following Sweden&#x27;s defeat in the Second Northern War, the protectorate was terminated in 1657.

==Hesse-Kassel==
Frederick I of Sweden had acceded to the Swedish throne when his wife, Ulrike Eleonora, abdicated in his favour in 1721. In 1730 he was also in line of succession to the duchy of Hesse-Kassel, which resulted in a personal union that lasted until his death in 1751.

==Norway (III)==
By the Treaty of Kiel in 1814 the king of Denmark-Norway ceded Norway to the king of Sweden, an event which likely would have resulted in a full political union between Sweden and Norway. The treaty however never came into force, as Norway adopted a constitution and declared independence. Sweden, which would not accept this outcome, went to war and forced Norway into accepting a personal union with Sweden. The two kingdoms had full inner autonomy and separate institutions, sharing only the monarch and the foreign policy, which was conducted by the Swedish foreign office. The new Bernadotte dynasty could just as well be termed Norwegian until the dissolution of the union in 1905.

==European Union==
In 1995 Sweden joined the European Union after holding a referendum on the matter. The European Union at present constitutes 27 European states. The organisation is a political union where each state is technically allowed to conduct their own foreign policy (though a loose joint policy is in place).

<text>The Province of Georgia (also Georgia Colony) was one of the Southern Colonies in colonial-era British America. In 1775 it was the last of the Thirteen Colonies to support the American Revolution.

The original land grant of the Province of Georgia included a narrow strip of land that extended west to the Pacific Ocean.

The colony&#x27;s corporate charter was granted to General James Oglethorpe on April 21, 1732, by George II, for whom the colony was named. The charter was finalized by the King&#x27;s privy council on June 9, 1732.

Oglethorpe envisioned a colony which would serve as a haven for English subjects who had been imprisoned for debt and &quot;the worthy poor.&quot; General Oglethorpe imposed very strict laws that many colonists disagreed with, such as the banning of alcoholic beverages. He disagreed with slavery and thought a system of smallholdings more appropriate than the large plantations common in the colonies just to the north. However, land grants were not as large as most colonists would have preferred.

Another reason for the founding of the colony was as a buffer state and a &quot;garrison province&quot; which would defend the southern British colonies from Spanish Florida. Oglethorpe imagined a province populated by &quot;sturdy farmers&quot; who could guard the border; because of this, the colony&#x27;s charter prohibited slavery. The ban on slavery was lifted by 1751 and the colony became a royal colony by 1752.

==Foundation==


Although many believe that the colony was formed for the imprisoned, the colony was actually formed as a place of no slavery. Oglethorpe did have the vision to make it a place for debtors, but it transformed into a royal colony. The following is an historical accounting of these first English settlers sent to Georgia:

A committee was appointed to visit the jails and obtain the discharge of such poor prisoners as were worthy, carefully investigating &quot;character, circumstances and antecedents&quot;.

Thirty-five families, numbering one hundred and twenty persons, were selected.

On the 16th of November, 1732, the emigrants embarked at Gravesend on the ship Anne ... arriving January 13th [1733] in the harbor of Charleston, S. C. ... They set sail the day following ... into Port Royal, some eighty miles southward, to be conveyed in small vessels to the river Savannah.
Oglethorpe continued up the river to scout a location suitable for settlement. On February 12, 1733, Oglethorpe led the settlers to their arrival at Yamacraw Bluff, in what is now the city of Savannah, and established a camp with the help of a local elderly Creek chief, Tomochichi. A Yamacraw Indian village had occupied the site, but Oglethorpe arranged for the Indians to move. The day is still celebrated as Georgia Day.

The original charter specified the colony as being between the Savannah and Altamaha Rivers, up to their headwaters (the headwaters of the Altamaha are on the Ocmulgee River), and then extending westward &quot;to the south seas.&quot; The area within the charter had previously been part of the original grant of the Province of Carolina, which was closely linked to Georgia.

==Development of the colony==

The Privy Council approved the establishment charter on June 9, 1732, and for the next two decades the council of trustees governed the province, with the aid of annual subsidies from Parliament. However, after many difficulties and the departure of Oglethorpe, the trustees proved unable to manage the proprietary colony, and on June 23, 1752, they submitted a deed of reconveyance to the crown, one year before the expiration of the charter. On January 2, 1755, Georgia officially ceased to be a proprietary colony and became a royal colony.

From 1732 until 1758, the minor civil divisions were districts and towns. In 1758, without Indian permission, the Province of Georgia was divided into eight parishes by the Act of the Assembly of Georgia on March 15. The Town and District of Savannah was named Christ Church Parish. The District of Abercorn and Goshen, plus the District of Ebenezer, was named the Parish of St. Matthew. The District of Halifax was named the Parish of St. George. The District of Augusta was named the Parish of St. Paul. The Town of Hardwick and the District of Ogeechee, including the island of Ossabaw, was named the Parish of St. Philip. From Sunbury in the District of Midway and Newport to the south branch of Newport, including the islands of St. Catherine and Bermuda, was named the Parish of St. John. The Town and District of Darien, to the Altamaha River, including the islands of Sapelo and Eastwood and the sea islands north of Egg Island, was named the Parish of St. Andrew. The Town and District of Frederica, including the islands of Great and Little St. Simons, along with the adjacent islands, was named the Parish of St. James.

Following Britain&#x27;s victory in the French and Indian War, King George III issued the Proclamation of 1763. One of its provisions was to extend Georgia&#x27;s southern boundary from the Altamaha River to the St. Marys River. Two years later, on March 25, 1765, Governor James Wright approved an act of the General Assembly creating four new parishesSt. David, St. Patrick, St. Thomas, and St. Mary in the recently acquired land, and it further assigned Jekyll Island to St. James Parish.

The Georgia colony had had a sluggish beginning. James Oglethorpe did not allow liquor, and colonists who came at the trustees&#x27; expense were not allowed to own more than of land for their farm in addition to a 60 foot by 90 foot plot in town. Those who paid their own way could bring ten indentured servants and would receive 500 acres of land. Additional land could neither be acquired nor sold. Discontent grew in the colony because of these restrictions, and Oglethorpe lifted them. With slavery, liquor, and land acquisition the colony developed much faster. Slavery had been permitted from 1749. There was some internal opposition to slavery, particularly from Scottish settlers, but by the time of the War of Independence, Georgia was much like the other Southern colonies.

==Revolutionary War period and beyond==
During the American Revolution Georgia&#x27;s population was at first divided about exactly how to respond to revolutionary activities and heightened tensions in other provinces. After violence broke out in Massachusetts in 1775, radical Patriots stormed the royal magazine at Savannah and carried off its ammunition, took control of the provincial government, and drove many Loyalists out of the province. In 1776 a provincial congress had declared independence and created a constitution for the new state. Georgia also served as the staging ground for several important raids into British-controlled Florida.

In 1777 the original eight counties of the state of Georgia were created. Prior to that Georgia had been divided into local government units called parishes. Settlement had been limited to the near vicinity of the Savannah River; the western area of the new state remained under the control of the Creek Indian Confederation.

James Wright, the last Royal Governor of the Province of Georgia, dismissed the royal assembly in 1775. He was briefly a prisoner of the revolutionaries before escaping to a British warship in February 1776. During the American Revolutionary War Wright was the only royal governor to regain control of part of his colony after British forces captured Savannah on December 29, 1778. British and Loyalist forces restored large areas of Georgia to colonial rule, especially along the coast, while Patriots continued to maintain an independent governor, congress, and militia in other areas. In 1779 the British repelled an attack of militia, Continental Army, and French military and naval forces on Savannah. The 1781 siege of Augusta, by militia and Continental forces, restored it to Patriot control. When the war was lost for Britain, Wright and British forces evacuated Savannah on July 11, 1782. After that the Province of Georgia ceased to exist as a British colony.

The new state of Georgia was a member of the Second Continental Congress, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, the tenth state to ratify the Articles of Confederation on July 24, 1778, and the fourth state to be admitted to the Union under the U.S. Constitution, on January 2, 1788.

On April 24, 1802, Georgia ceded to the U.S. Congress parts of its western lands, that it had claims for going back to when it was a province (colony). These lands were incorporated into the Mississippi Territory and later (with other adjoining lands) became the states of Alabama and Mississippi.

<doc id="487087" wikidata="Q3457242" url="?curid=487087" title="Yakama Indian Reservation">
<text>The Yakama Indian Reservation (spelled Yakima until 1994) is a Native American reservation in Washington state of the federally recognized tribe known as the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation. The tribe is made up of Klikitat, Palus, Wallawalla, Wenatchi, Wishram, and Yakama peoples.

==Geography==
The reservation is located on the east side of the Cascade Mountains in southern Washington state. The eastern portion of Mount Adams lies within this territory. According to the United States Census Bureau, the reservation covers 2,185.94 square miles (5,661.56 km²) and the population in 2000 was 31,799. It lies primarily in Yakima and the northern edge of Klickitat counties. The largest city on the reservation is Toppenish.

About 80% of the reservation&#x27;s land is held in trust by the federal government for the benefit of the tribe and tribal members. The remaining 20% of the reservation&#x27;s land is privately owned.

Some 410,000 acres of the reservation are shrub-steppe rangeland; as of 2014, about 15,000 wild horses roamed these lands—an unsustainable population, many times what the land can support.

The reservation was created in 1855 by a treaty signed by Washington Territory Gov. Isaac Stevens and representatives of the Yakama tribe. Several Native leaders believed that those representatives did not have the authority to cede communal land and had not properly gained consensus from the full council or tribe. A dispute over the treaty conditions led to the Yakima War (1855–1858), which the Yakama and allied tribes waged against the United States.

Following the Bannock War of 1878, the United States government forced the Northern Paiute people out of Nevada and onto the Yakama Reservation, although most had not been involved in the war. The more than 500 Paiute in Washington were subjected to privation for more than a decade before being allowed to return to Nevada. They were forced to compete for the limited resources and housing on the reservation with peoples who had been established there for decades. The Paiute did not return to Nevada until the 1886 expansion of the Duck Valley Indian Reservation permitted them to reunite with their Western Shoshone brethren.

In 1994, the Yakima Tribal Council unanimously voted to change the spelling of the tribe&#x27;s name from &quot;Yakima&quot; to &quot;Yakama&quot;, matching the spelling of the 1855 treaty. The pronunciation remained the same.

The Yakama reservation was affected by the Cougar Creek fire, one of the 2015 Washington wildfires. About 80% of the Cougar Creek fire burned on reservation land. The Yakama responded by salvage logging.

==Membership==
Roughly 10,000 people were enrolled members of the Yakama Nation in 2009. The required blood quantum for tribal membership is .

==Economy==
The Yakama Nation suffers from high poverty and unemployment; a 2005 report indicated that 42.8% of Yakama Nation families lived in poverty. As of 2017, there was a wait list of 1,800 families for tribal housing, and high rates of homelessness. In 2016, an encampment at the reservation was set up by about 130 people evicted from tribal housing. Members of the tribe responded by building tiny houses, but the structures do not have plumbing and are not viewed as a permanent solution.

The tribe undertakes forest management activities, including a lumber mill that supports several hundred jobs in the region. The tribe owns one of the largest commercial forests in the country, which makes up a sizable percent of the tribe&#x27;s income.

The tribe operates a casino, one of the few Native American casinos in the United States that are &quot;dry&quot; (alcohol-free).

The Yakama Nation is one of several tribal governments in the northwestern United States to offer free bus service on its reservation.

==Law and government==
The governance of the tribe is the responsibility of a 14-member tribal council, elected by a vote of the tribe&#x27;s members.

In 1963, most criminal and civil jurisdiction over tribal members was transferred from the tribe to the Washington state government under Public Law 280. (Misdemeanors and traffic infractions continued to be handled by the tribe.) From 1983 to April 1993, thirteen women were killed on the reservation, and two other women disappeared in the early 1990s; none of the cases were solved, fueling native distrust of the FBI.

In 2016, full criminal jurisdiction over tribal members reverted to the tribe, along with jurisdiction over the five civil areas of &quot;compulsory school attendance, public assistance, domestic relations, juvenile delinquency and operations of motor vehicles on public roads and highways on the reservation.&quot;

The Yakama Nation bans alcohol on tribal land, including its casino and convenience store, as well as on tribal powwows and other ceremonies. In 2000, the tribal council voted to extend its alcohol ban to the entirety of the 1.2-million-acre reservation, including private land owned by the estimated 20,000 non-tribal members who lived on the reservation. Washington state, represented by its state attorney general, sued the tribe. The suit was dismissed on ripeness grounds, because the ban had not yet been enforced against non-tribal members or on privately owned land. In 2001, the acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Washington issued an opinion letter stating that federal prosecutors would enforce existing federal liquor laws, but would not enforce a ban on the sale of alcohol on privately owned, non-Indian communities within the reservation.

The reservation has struggled with substance abuse over a series of decades. Although the recreational use of marijuana is generally legal in Washington state under Initiative 502 (enacted by voters in 2012), the Yakama have sought to block the issuance of licenses for the legal marijuana cultivation and sales on their lands; in 2014, the tribe filed challenges to almost 1,300 pending applications for marijuana business licenses in the 10-county area on which the reservation is located.

==Crime and public safety==
In February 2018, the Yakama tribal council Yakamas passed a resolution declared a public safety crisis in response to a surge of crime on the reservation, particularly in White Swan. The resolution sought to impose greater penalties on tribal members who commit crimes (including the loss of treaty rights to hunt and fish, as well as banishment from the tribe) and stated that non-members who committed crimes on the reservation could be excluded from the reservation.

In June 2019, the tribal council said that the reservation was plagued by drug use and violent crime, as well as &quot;disregard for the rule of law and general civil unrest&quot; and responded by imposing a youth curfew, establishing a telephone hotline for reporting crime, and increasing penalties for theft and assault. The announcement came after five people were killed in White Swan on the reservation in a shooting earlier that month.

<doc id="487090" wikidata="Q1772910" url="?curid=487090" title="Scientific racism">
<text>Scientific racism, sometimes termed biological racism, is the pseudoscientific belief that the human species is divided into biologically distinct taxa called &quot;races&quot;, and that empirical evidence exists to support or justify racial discrimination, racial inferiority, or racial superiority. Before the mid-20th century, scientific racism was accepted throughout the scientific community, but it is no longer considered scientific. The division of humankind into biologically separate groups, along with the assignment of particular physical and mental characteristics to these groups through constructing and applying corresponding explanatory models, is referred to as racialism, racial realism, race realism, or race science by those who support these ideas. Modern scientific consensus rejects this view as being irreconcilable with modern genetic research.

Scientific racism misapplies, misconstrues, or distorts anthropology (notably physical anthropology), craniometry, evolutionary biology, and other disciplines or pseudo-disciplines through proposing anthropological typologies to classify human populations into physically discrete human races, some of which might be asserted to be superior or inferior to others.

Scientific racism was common during the period from the 1600s to the end of World War II, and was particularly prominent in European and American academic writings from the mid-19th century through the early-20th century. Since the second half of the 20th century, scientific racism has been discredited and criticized as obsolete, yet has persistently been used to support or validate racist world-views based upon belief in the existence and significance of racial categories and a hierarchy of superior and inferior races.

During the 20th century, anthropologist Franz Boas and biologists Julian Huxley and Lancelot Hogben were among the earliest leading critics of scientific racism. Skepticism towards the validity of scientific racism grew during the interwar period, and by the end of World War II, scientific racism in theory and action was formally denounced, especially in UNESCO&#x27;s early antiracist statement, &quot;The Race Question&quot; (1950): &quot;The biological fact of race and the myth of &#x27;race&#x27; should be distinguished. For all practical social purposes, &#x27;race&#x27; is not so much a biological phenomenon as a social myth. The myth of &#x27;race&#x27; has created an enormous amount of human and social damage. In recent years, it has taken a heavy toll in human lives, and caused untold suffering&quot;. Since that time, developments in human evolutionary genetics and physical anthropology have led to a new consensus among anthropologists that human races are a sociopolitical phenomenon rather than a biological one.

The term &quot;scientific racism&quot; was popularized by Stephen Jay Gould who used it in his 1981 book &quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot; to describe the historical role of science in propagating the ideal of White racial superiority. Today, the term is generally used pejoratively when applied to more modern theories, such as those in &quot;The Bell Curve&quot; (1994). Critics argue that such works postulate racist conclusions, such as a genetic connection between race and intelligence, that are unsupported by available evidence. Publications such as the &quot;Mankind Quarterly&quot;, founded explicitly as a &quot;race-conscious&quot; journal, are generally regarded as platforms of scientific racism because they publish fringe interpretations of human evolution, intelligence, ethnography, language, mythology, archaeology, and race.

==Antecedents==

===Enlightenment thinkers===
During the Age of Enlightenment (an era from the 1650s to the 1780s), concepts of monogenism and polygenism became popular, though they would only be systematized epistemologically during the 19th century. Monogenism contends that all races have a single origin, while polygenism is the idea that each race has a separate origin. Until the 18th century, the words &quot;race&quot; and &quot;species&quot; were interchangeable.

====François Bernier====
François Bernier (1620–1688) was a French physician and traveller. In 1684, he published a brief essay dividing humanity into what he called &quot;races&quot;, distinguishing individuals, particularly women, by skin color and a few other physical traits. The article was published anonymously in the &quot;Journal des Savants&quot;, the earliest academic journal published in Europe, and titled &quot;New Division of the Earth by the Different Species or &#x27;Races&#x27; of Man that Inhabit It&quot;.

In the essay, he distinguished four different races:
* The first race included populations from Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, India, south-east Asia, and the Americas
* The second race consisted of the sub-Saharan Africans
* The third race consisted of the east- and northeast Asians
* The fourth race consisted of Sámi people.

A product of French salon culture, the essay placed an emphasis on different kinds of female beauty. Bernier emphasized that his novel classification was based on his personal experience as a traveler in different parts of the world. Bernier offered a distinction between essential genetic differences and accidental ones that depended on environmental factors. He also suggested that the latter criterion might be relevant to distinguish sub-types. His biological classification of racial types never sought to go beyond physical traits, and he also accepted the role of climate and diet in explaining degrees of human diversity. Bernier had been the first to extend the concept of &quot;species of man&quot; to racially classify the entirety of humanity, but he did not establish a cultural hierarchy between the so-called &quot;races&quot; that he had conceived. On the other hand, he clearly placed white Europeans as the norm from which other &quot;races&quot; deviated.

The qualities which he attributed to each race were not strictly Eurocentric, because he thought that peoples of temperate Europe, the Americas, and India—although culturally very different from one another—belonged to roughly the same racial group, and he explained the differences between the civilizations of India (his main area of expertise) and Europe through climate and institutional history. By contrast, he emphasized the biological difference between Europeans and Africans, and made very negative comments towards the Sámi (Lapps) of the coldest climates of Northern Europe, and about Africans living at the Cape of Good Hope. For example, Bernier wrote: &quot;The &#x27;Lappons&#x27; compose the 4th race. They are a small and short race with thick legs, wide shoulders, a short neck, and a face that I don&#x27;t know how to describe, except that it&#x27;s long, truly awful, and seems reminiscent of a bear&#x27;s face. I&#x27;ve only ever seen them twice in Danzig, but according to the portraits I&#x27;ve seen, and from what I&#x27;ve heard from a number of people, they&#x27;re ugly animals&quot;. The significance of Bernier&#x27;s ideology for the emergence of what Joan-Pau Rubiés called the &quot;modern racial discourse&quot; has been debated, with Siep Stuurman considering it the beginning of modern racial thought, while Rubiés believes it is less significant if Bernier&#x27;s entire view of humanity is taken into account.

====Robert Boyle====

An early scientist who studied race was Robert Boyle (1627–1691), an Anglo-Irish natural philosopher, chemist, physicist, and inventor. Boyle believed in what today is called monogenism, that is, that all races, no matter how diverse, came from the same source: Adam and Eve. He studied reported stories of parents&#x27; giving birth to differently coloured albinos, so he concluded that Adam and Eve were originally white, and that whites could give birth to different coloured races. Theories of Robert Hooke and Isaac Newton about color and light via optical dispersion in physics were also extended by Robert Boyle into discourses of polygenesis, speculating that perhaps these differences were due to &quot;seminal impressions&quot;. However, Boyle&#x27;s writings mentioned that at his time, for &quot;European Eyes&quot;, beauty was not measured so much in colour, but in &quot;stature, comely symmetry of the parts of the body, and good features in the face&quot;. Various members of the scientific community rejected his views, and described them as &quot;disturbing&quot; or &quot;amusing&quot;.

====Richard Bradley====
Richard Bradley (1688–1732) was an English naturalist. In his book titled &quot;Philosophical Account of the Works of Nature&quot; (1721), Bradley claimed there to be &quot;five sorts of men&quot; based on their skin colour and other physical characteristics: white Europeans with beards; white men in America without beards (meaning Native Americans); men with copper-coloured skin, small eyes, and straight black hair; Blacks with straight black hair; and Blacks with curly hair. It has been speculated that Bradley&#x27;s account inspired Linnaeus&#x27; later categorisation.

==== Lord Kames ====

The Scottish lawyer Henry Home, Lord Kames (1696–1782) was a polygenist; he believed God had created different races on Earth in separate regions. In his 1734 book &quot;Sketches on the History of Man&quot;, Home claimed that the environment, climate, or state of society could not account for racial differences, so the races must have come from distinct, separate stocks.

====Carl Linnaeus====

Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778), the Swedish physician, botanist, and zoologist, modified the established taxonomic bases of binomial nomenclature for fauna and flora, and also made a classification of humans into different subgroups. In the twelfth edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; (1767), he labeled five &quot;varieties&quot; of human species.
Each one was described as possessing the following physiognomic characteristics &quot;varying by culture and place&quot;:
* The &quot;Americanus&quot;: red, choleric, upright; black, straight, thick hair; nostrils flared; face freckled; beardless chin; stubborn, zealous, free; painting themself with red lines; governed by habit.
* The &quot;Europeanus&quot;: white, sanguine, muscular; with yellowish, long hair; blue eyes; gentle, acute, inventive; covered with close vestments; governed by customs.
* The &quot;Asiaticus&quot;: yellow, melancholic, stiff; black hair, dark eyes; austere, haughty, greedy; covered with loose clothing; governed by beliefs.
* The &quot;Afer&quot; or &quot;Africanus&quot;: black, phlegmatic, relaxed; black, frizzled hair; silky skin, flat nose, tumid lips; females with elongated labia; mammary glands give milk abundantly; sly, lazy, negligent; anoints themself with grease; governed by caprice.
* The &quot;Monstrosus&quot; were mythologic humans which did not appear in the first editions of &quot;Systema Naturae.&quot; The sub-species included: the &quot;four-footed, mute, hairy&quot; &quot;Homo feralis&quot; (&quot;Feral man&quot;); the animal-reared &quot;Juvenis lupinus hessensis&quot; (Hessian wolf boy); the &quot;Juvenis hannoveranus&quot; (Hannoverian boy); the &quot;Puella campanica&quot; (Wild-girl of Champagne); the agile, but faint-hearted &quot;Homo monstrosus&quot; (&quot;Monstrous man&quot;); the Patagonian giant; the Dwarf of the Alps; and the monorchid Khoikhoi (Hottentot). In &quot;Amoenitates academicae&quot; (1763), Linnaeus presented the mythologic &quot;Homo anthropomorpha&quot; (&quot;Anthropomorphic man&quot;), or humanoid creatures, such as the troglodyte, the satyr, the hydra, and the phoenix, incorrectly identified as simian creatures.

There are disagreements about the basis for Linnaeus&#x27; human taxa. On the one hand, his harshest critics say the classification was not only ethnocentric, but seemed to be based upon skin colour. Renato G. Mazzolini argued that classifications based on skin colour, at its core, were a white/black polarity, and that Linnaeus&#x27; thinking became paradigmatic for later racist beliefs. On the other hand, Quintyn (2010) points out that some authors believed that Linnaeus&#x27; classification was based upon geographical distribution, being cartographically-based, and not hierarchical. In the opinion of Kenneth A. R. Kennedy (1976), Linnaeus certainly considered his own culture as superior, but his motives for the classification of human varieties were not race-centered. Paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould (1994) argued that the taxa was &quot;not in the ranked order favored by most Europeans in the racist tradition&quot;, and that Linnaeus&#x27; division was influenced by the medical theory of humors, which said that a person&#x27;s temperament may be related to biological fluids. In a 1994 essay, Gould added: &quot;I don&#x27;t mean to deny that Linnaeus held conventional beliefs about the superiority of his own European variety over others... nevertheless, and despite these implications, the overt geometry of Linnaeus&#x27; model is not linear or hierarchical&quot;.

In a 2008 essay published by the Linnean Society of London, Marie-Christine Skuncke interpreted Linnaeus&#x27; statements as reflecting a view that &quot;Europeans&#x27; superiority resides in &quot;culture&quot;, and that the decisive factor in Linnaeus&#x27; taxa was &quot;culture&quot;, &quot;not&quot; race&quot;. Thus, regarding this topic, Skuncke considers Linnaeus&#x27; view as merely &quot;eurocentric&quot;, arguing that Linnaeus never called for racist action, and did not use the word &quot;race&quot;, which was only introduced later &quot;by his French opponent, Buffon&quot;. However, the anthropologist Ashley Montagu, in his book &quot;Man&#x27;s Most Dangerous Myth: the Fallacy of Race&quot;, points out that Buffon, indeed &quot;the enemy of all rigid classifications&quot;, was diametrically opposed to such broad categories, and did not use the word &quot;race&quot; to describe them. &quot;It was quite clear, after reading Buffon, that he uses the word in no narrowly defined, but rather in a general sense&quot;, wrote Montagu, pointing out that Buffon did employ the French word &quot;la race&quot;, but as a collective term for whatever population he happened to be discussing at the time; for instance: &quot;The Danish, Swedish, and Muscovite Laplanders, the inhabitants of Nova-Zembla, the Borandians, the Samoiedes, the Ostiacks of the old continent, the Greenlanders, and the savages to the north of the Esquimaux Indians, of the new continent, appear to be of one common race&quot;.

Scholar Stanley A. Rice agrees that Linnaeus&#x27; classification was not meant to &quot;imply a hierarchy of humanness or superiority&quot;; however, modern critics regard Linnaeus&#x27; classification as obviously stereotyped and erroneous for having included anthropological, non-biological features, such as customs or traditions.

==== Charles White ====
Charles White (1728–1813), an English physician and surgeon, believed that races occupied different stations in the &quot;Great Chain of Being&quot;, and he tried to scientifically prove that human races had distinct origins from each other. He speculated that whites and Negroes were two different species. White was a believer in polygeny, the idea that different races had been created separately. His &quot;Account of the Regular Gradation in Man&quot; (1799) provided an empirical basis for this idea. White defended the theory of polygeny by rebutting French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon&#x27;s interfertility argument, which said that only the same species can interbreed. White pointed to species hybrids, such as foxes, wolves, and jackals, which were separate groups that were still able to interbreed. For White, each race was a separate species, divinely created for its own geographical region.

==== Buffon and Blumenbach ====
The French naturalist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon (1707–1788) and the German anatomist Johann Blumenbach (1752–1840) were proponents of monogenism, the concept that all races have a single origin. Buffon and Blumenbach believed a &quot;degeneration theory&quot; of the origins of racial difference. Both asserted that Adam and Eve were white, and that other races came about by degeneration owing to environmental factors, such as climate, disease, and diet. According to this model, Negroid pigmentation arose because of the heat of the tropical sun; that cold wind caused the tawny colour of the Eskimos; and that the Chinese had fairer skins than the Tartars, because the former kept mostly in towns, and were protected from environmental factors. Environmental factors, poverty, and hybridization could make races &quot;degenerate&quot;, and differentiate them from the original white race by a process of &quot;raciation&quot;. Interestingly, both Buffon and Blumenbach believed that the degeneration could be reversed if proper environmental control was taken, and that all contemporary forms of man could revert to the original white race.

According to Blumenbach, there are five races, all belonging to a single species: Caucasian, Mongolian, Negroid, American, and the Malay race. Blumenbach stated: &quot;I have allotted the first place to the Caucasian for the reasons given below, which make me esteem it the primeval one&quot;.

Before James Hutton and the emergence of scientific geology, many believed the Earth was only 6,000 years old. Buffon had conducted experiments with heated balls of iron, which he believed were a model for the Earth&#x27;s core, and concluded that the Earth was 75,000 years old, but did not extend the time since Adam and the origin of humanity back more than 8,000 years—not much further than the 6,000 years of the prevailing Ussher chronology subscribed to by most of the monogenists. Opponents of monogenism believed that it would have been difficult for races to change markedly in such a short period of time.

====Benjamin Rush====
Benjamin Rush (1745–1813), a Founding Father of the United States and a physician, proposed that being black was a hereditary skin disease, which he called &quot;negroidism&quot;, and that it could be cured. Rush believed non-whites were actually white underneath, but that they were stricken with a non-contagious form of leprosy, which darkened their skin color. Rush drew the conclusion that &quot;whites should not tyrannize over [blacks], for their disease should entitle them to a double portion of humanity. However, by the same token, whites should not intermarry with them, for this would tend to infect posterity with the &#x27;disorder&#x27;... attempts must be made to cure the disease&quot;.

====Christoph Meiners====
Christoph Meiners (1747–1810) was a German polygenist, and believed that each race had a separate origin. Meiners studied the physical, mental, and moral characteristics of each race, and built a race hierarchy based on his findings. Meiners split mankind into two divisions, which he labelled the &quot;beautiful white race&quot; and the &quot;ugly black race&quot;. In his book titled &quot;The Outline of History of Mankind&quot;, Meiners argued that a main characteristic of race is either beauty or ugliness. Meiners thought only the white race to be beautiful, and considered ugly races to be inferior, immoral, and animal-like. Meiners wrote about how the dark, ugly peoples were differentiated from the white, beautiful peoples by their &quot;sad&quot; lack of virtue and their &quot;terrible vices&quot;.

Meiners hypothesized about how the Negro felt less pain than any other race, and lacked in emotions. Meiners wrote that the Negro had thick nerves, and thus, was not sensitive like the other races. He went so far as to say that the Negro possessed &quot;no human, barely any animal, feeling&quot;. Meiners described a story where a Negro was condemned to death by being burned alive. Halfway through the burning, the Negro asked to smoke a pipe, and smoked it like nothing was happening while he continued to be burned alive. Meiners studied the anatomy of the Negro, and came to the conclusion that Negroes were all carnivores, based upon his observations that Negroes had bigger teeth and jaws than any other race. Meiners claimed the skull of the Negro was larger, but the brain of the Negro was smaller than any other race. Meiners theorized that the Negro was the most unhealthy race on Earth because of its poor diet, mode of living, and lack of morals.

Meiners studied the diet of the Americans, and said they fed off any kind of &quot;foul offal&quot;, and consumed copious amounts of alcohol. He believed their skulls were so thick that the blades of Spanish swords shattered on them. Meiners also claimed the skin of an American is thicker than that of an ox.

Meiners wrote that the noblest race was the Celts. This was based upon assertions that they were able to conquer various parts of the world, they were more sensitive to heat and cold, and their delicacy is shown by the way they are selective about what they eat. Meiners claimed that Slavs are an inferior race, &quot;less sensitive and content with eating rough food&quot;. He described stories of Slavs allegedly eating poisonous fungi without coming to any harm. He claimed that their medical techniques were also counterproductive; as an example, Meiners described their practice of warming up sick people in ovens, then making them roll in the snow.

===Later thinkers===

====Thomas Jefferson====
Thomas Jefferson (1743–1826) was an American politician, scientist, and slave owner. His contributions to scientific racism have been noted by many historians, scientists, and scholars. According to an article published in the &quot;McGill Journal of Medicine&quot;: &quot;One of the most influential pre-Darwinian racial theorists, Jefferson&#x27;s call for science to determine the obvious &#x27;inferiority&#x27; of African Americans is an extremely important stage in the evolution of scientific racism&quot;. Writing for &quot;The New York Times,&quot; historian Paul Finkelman described how as &quot;a scientist, Jefferson nevertheless speculated that blackness might come &#x27;from the color of the blood,&#x27; and concluded that blacks were &#x27;inferior to the whites in the endowments of body and mind&#x27;&quot;. In his &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia&quot;, Jefferson described black people as follows:

They seem to require less sleep. A black, after hard labor through the day, will be induced by the slightest amusements to sit up till midnight, or later, though knowing he must be out with the first dawn of the morning. They are at least as brave, and more adventuresome. But, this may perhaps proceed from a want of forethought, which prevents their seeing a danger till it be present. When present, they do not go through it with more coolness or steadiness than the whites. They are more ardent after their female: but love seems with them to be more an eager desire, than a tender delicate mixture of sentiment and sensation. Their griefs are transient. Those numberless afflictions, which render it doubtful whether heaven has given life to us in mercy or in wrath, are less felt, and sooner forgotten with them. In general, their existence appears to participate more of sensation than reflection... Comparing them by their faculties of memory, reason, and imagination, it appears to me, that in memory, they are equal to the whites; in reason, much inferior, as I think one [black] could scarcely be found capable of tracing and comprehending the investigations of Euclid; and that in imagination, they are dull, tasteless, and anomalous... I advance it, therefore, as a suspicion only, that the blacks, whether originally a distinct race, or made distinct by time and circumstances, are inferior to the whites in the endowments both of body and mind.

However, by 1791, Jefferson had to reassess his earlier suspicions of whether blacks were capable of intelligence when he was presented with a letter and almanac from Benjamin Banneker, an educated black mathematician. Delighted to have discovered scientific proof for the existence of black intelligence, Jefferson wrote to Banneker:

No body wishes more than I do to see such proofs as you exhibit, that nature has given to our black brethren, talents equal to those of the other colors of men, &amp; that the appearance of a want of them is owing merely to the degraded condition of their existence both in Africa &amp; America. I can add with truth that no body wishes more ardently to see a good system commenced for raising the condition both of their body &amp; mind to what it ought to be, as fast as the imbecility of their present existence, and other circumstance which cannot be neglected, will admit. 

====Samuel Stanhope Smith====
Samuel Stanhope Smith (1751–1819) was an American Presbyterian minister and author of the &quot;Essay on the Causes of Variety of Complexion and Figure in the Human Species&quot; (1787). Smith claimed that Negro pigmentation was nothing more than a huge freckle that covered the whole body as a result of an oversupply of bile, which was caused by tropical climates.

====Georges Cuvier====

Racial studies by Georges Cuvier (1769–1832), the French naturalist and zoologist, influenced both scientific polygenism and scientific racism. Cuvier believed there were three distinct races: the Caucasian (white), Mongolian (yellow), and the Ethiopian (black). He rated each for the beauty or ugliness of the skull and quality of their civilizations. Cuvier wrote about Caucasians: &quot;The white race, with oval face, straight hair and nose, to which the civilised people of Europe belong, and which appear to us the most beautiful of all, is also superior to others by its genius, courage, and activity&quot;.

Regarding Negroes, Cuvier wrote:

The Negro race ... is marked by black complexion, crisped or woolly hair, compressed cranium, and a flat nose. The projection of the lower parts of the face, and the thick lips, evidently approximate it to the monkey tribe: the hordes of which it consists have always remained in the most complete state of barbarism.

He thought Adam and Eve were Caucasian, and hence, the original race of mankind. The other two races arose by survivors escaping in different directions after a major catastrophe hit the earth approximately 5,000 years ago. Cuvier theorized that the survivors lived in complete isolation from each other, and developed separately as a result.

One of Cuvier&#x27;s pupils, Friedrich Tiedemann, was among the first to make a scientific contestation of racism. Tiedemann asserted that based upon his documentation of craniometric and brain measurements of Europeans and black people from different parts of the world, that the then-common European belief that Negroes have smaller brains, and are thus intellectually inferior, was scientifically unfounded, and based merely on the prejudice of travellers and explorers.

====Arthur Schopenhauer====

The German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer (1788–1860) attributed civilizational primacy to the white races, who gained sensitivity and intelligence via the refinement caused by living in the rigorous Northern climate:

 The highest civilization and culture, apart from the ancient Hindus and Egyptians, are found exclusively among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste, or race, is fairer in colour than the rest, and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the Brahmins, the Inca, and the rulers of the South Sea Islands. All this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention, because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers, and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want, and misery, which, in their many forms, were brought about by the climate. This they had to do to make up for the parsimony of nature, and out of it all came their high civilization.

====Franz Ignaz Pruner====
Franz Ignaz Pruner (1808–1882) was a German physician, ophthalmologist, and anthropologist who studied the racial structure of Negroes in Egypt. In a book Pruner wrote in 1846, he claimed that Negro blood had a negative influence on the Egyptian moral character. He published a monograph on Negroes in 1861. He claimed that the main feature of the Negro&#x27;s skeleton is prognathism, which he claimed was the Negro&#x27;s relation to the ape. He also claimed that Negroes had brains very similar to those of apes and that Negroes have a shortened big toe, a characteristic, he said, that connected Negroes closely to apes.

==Racial theories in physical anthropology (1850–1918)==
The scientific classification established by Carl Linnaeus is requisite to any human racial classification scheme. In the 19th century, unilineal evolution, or classical social evolution, was a conflation of competing sociologic and anthropologic theories proposing that Western European culture was the acme of human socio-cultural evolution. The Christian Bible was interpreted to sanction slavery and from the 1820s to the 1850s was often used in the antebellum Southern United States, by writers such as the Rev. Richard Furman and Thomas R. Cobb, to enforce the idea that Negroes had been created inferior, and thus suited to slavery.

===Arthur de Gobineau===

The French aristocrat and writer Arthur de Gobineau (1816–1882), is best known for his book &quot;An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races&quot; (1853–55) which proposed three human races (black, white and yellow) were natural barriers and claimed that race mixing would lead to the collapse of culture and civilization. He claimed that &quot;The white race originally possessed the monopoly of beauty, intelligence and strength&quot; and that any positive accomplishments or thinking of blacks and Asians were due to an admixture with whites. His works were praised by many white supremacist American pro-slavery thinkers such as Josiah C. Nott and Henry Hotze.

Gobineau believed that the different races originated in different areas, the white race had originated somewhere in Siberia, the Asians in the Americas and the blacks in Africa. He believed that the white race was superior, writing:
Gobineau later used the term &quot;Aryans&quot; to describe the Germanic peoples ().

Gobineau&#x27;s works were also influential to the Nazi Party, which published his works in German. They played a key role in the master race theory of Nazism.

===Carl Vogt===

Another polygenist evolutionist was Carl Vogt (1817–1895) who believed that the Negro race was related to the ape. He wrote the white race was a separate species to Negroes. In Chapter VII of his &quot;Lectures of Man&quot; (1864) he compared the Negro to the white race whom he described as &quot;two extreme human types&quot;. The difference between them, he claimed are greater than those between two species of ape; and this proves that Negroes are a separate species from the whites.

===Charles Darwin===
Charles Darwin&#x27;s views on race have been a topic of much discussion and debate. According to Jackson and Weidman, Darwin was a moderate in the 19th century debates about race. &quot;He was not a confirmed racist — he was a staunch abolitionist, for example — but he did think that there were distinct races that could be ranked in a hierarchy&quot;.

Darwin&#x27;s influential 1859 book &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; did not discuss human origins. The extended wording on the title page, which adds &quot;by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life&quot;, uses the general terminology of biological races as an alternative for &quot;varieties&quot; such as &quot;the several races, for instance, of the cabbage&quot;, and does not carry the modern connotation of human races. In &quot;The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex&quot; (1871), Darwin examined the question of &quot;Arguments in favour of, and opposed to, ranking the so-called races of man as distinct species&quot; and reported no racial distinctions that would indicate that human races are discrete species.

The historian Richard Hofstadter wrote:

According to the historian Gertrude Himmelfarb, &quot;The subtitle of [&quot;The Origin of Species&quot;] made a convenient motto for racists: &#x27;The Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life.&#x27; Darwin, of course, took &#x27;races&#x27; to mean varieties or species; but it was no violation of his meaning to extend it to human races... Darwin himself, in spite of his aversion to slavery, was not averse to the idea that some races were more fit than others&quot;.

On the other hand, Robert Bannister defended Darwin on the issue of race, writing that &quot;Upon closer inspection, the case against Darwin himself quickly unravels. An ardent opponent of slavery, he consistently opposed the oppression of nonwhites... Although by modern standards &quot;The Descent of Man&quot; is frustratingly inconclusive on the critical issues of human equality, it was a model of moderation and scientific caution in the context of midcentury racism&quot;.

According to Myrna Perez Sheldon, Darwin believed that different races gained their &#x27;population-level characteristics&#x27; via sexual selection. Previously, race theorists conceptualized race as a &#x27;stable blood essence&#x27; and that these &#x27;essences&#x27; mixed when miscegenation occurred.

===Herbert Hope Risley===

As an exponent of &quot;race science&quot;, colonial administrator Herbert Hope Risley (1851–1911) used the ratio of the width of a nose to its height to divide Indian people into Aryan and Dravidian races, as well as seven castes.

===Ernst Haeckel===
Like most of Darwin&#x27;s supporters, Ernst Haeckel (1834–1919) put forward a doctrine of evolutionary polygenism based on the ideas of the linguist and polygenist August Schleicher, in which several different language groups had arisen separately from speechless prehuman (German for &#x27;original humans&#x27;), which themselves had evolved from simian ancestors. These separate languages had completed the transition from animals to man, and, under the influence of each main branch of languages, humans had evolved as separate species, which could be subdivided into races. Haeckel divided human beings into ten races, of which the Caucasian was the highest and the primitives were doomed to extinction. Haeckel was also an advocate of the out of Asia theory by writing that the origin of humanity was to be found in Asia; he believed that Hindustan (South Asia) was the actual location where the first humans had evolved. Haeckel argued that humans were closely related to the primates of Southeast Asia and rejected Darwin&#x27;s hypothesis of Africa.

Haeckel also wrote that Negroes have stronger and more freely movable toes than any other race which is evidence that Negroes are related to apes because when apes stop climbing in trees they hold on to the trees with their toes. Haeckel compared Negroes to &quot;four-handed&quot; apes. Haeckel also believed Negroes were savages and that whites were the most civilised.

===Nationalism of Lapouge and Herder===
At the 19th century&#x27;s end, scientific racism conflated Greco-Roman eugenicism with Francis Galton&#x27;s concept of voluntary eugenics to produce a form of coercive, anti-immigrant government programs influenced by other socio-political discourses and events. Such institutional racism was effected via phrenology, telling character from physiognomy; craniometric skull and skeleton studies; thus skulls and skeletons of black people and other colored &quot;volk&quot;, were displayed between apes and white men.

In 1906, Ota Benga, a Pygmy, was displayed as the &quot;Missing Link&quot;, in the Bronx Zoo, New York City, alongside apes and animals. The most influential theorists included the anthropologist Georges Vacher de Lapouge (1854–1936) who proposed &quot;anthroposociology&quot;; and Johann Gottfried Herder (1744–1803), who applied &quot;race&quot; to nationalist theory, thereby developing the first conception of ethnic nationalism. In 1882, Ernest Renan contradicted Herder with a nationalism based upon the &quot;will to live together&quot;, not founded upon ethnic or racial prerequisites (see Civic nationalism). Scientific racist discourse posited the historical existence of &quot;national races&quot; such as the &quot;Deutsche Volk&quot; in Germany, and the &quot;French race&quot; being a branch of the basal &quot;Aryan race&quot; extant for millennia, to advocate for geopolitical borders parallel to the racial ones.

===Craniometry and physical anthropology===

The Dutch scholar Pieter Camper (1722–89), an early craniometric theoretician, used &quot;craniometry&quot; (interior skull-volume measurement) to scientifically justify racial differences. In 1770, he conceived of the facial angle to measure intelligence among species of men. The facial angle was formed by drawing two lines: a horizontal line from nostril to ear; and a vertical line from the upper-jawbone prominence to the forehead prominence. Camper&#x27;s craniometry reported that antique statues (the Greco-Roman ideal) had a 90-degree facial angle, whites an 80-degree angle, blacks a 70-degree angle, and the orangutan a 58-degree facial angle—thus he established a racist biological hierarchy for mankind, per the Decadent conception of history. Such scientific racist researches were continued by the naturalist Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1772–1844) and the anthropologist Paul Broca (1824–1880).

====Samuel George Morton====
In the 19th century, an early American physical anthropologist, physician and polygenist Samuel George Morton (1799–1851), collected human skulls from worldwide, and attempted a logical classification scheme. Influenced by contemporary racialist theory, Dr Morton said he could judge racial intellectual capacity by measuring the interior cranial capacity, hence a large skull denoted a large brain, thus high intellectual capacity. Conversely, a small skull denoted a small brain, thus low intellectual capacity; superior and inferior established. After inspecting three mummies from ancient Egyptian catacombs, Morton concluded that Caucasians and Negroes were already distinct three thousand years ago. Since interpretations of the bible indicated that Noah&#x27;s Ark had washed up on Mount Ararat only a thousand years earlier, Morton claimed that Noah&#x27;s sons could not possibly account for every race on earth. According to Morton&#x27;s theory of polygenesis, races have been separate since the start.

In Morton&#x27;s &quot;Crania Americana&quot;, his claims were based on craniometry data, that the Caucasians had the biggest brains, averaging 87 cubic inches, Native Americans were in the middle with an average of 82 cubic inches and Negroes had the smallest brains with an average of 78 cubic inches. In &quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot; (1981), the evolutionary biologist and historian of science Stephen Jay Gould argued that Samuel Morton had falsified the craniometric data, perhaps inadvertently over-packing some skulls, to so produce results that would legitimize the racist presumptions he was attempting to prove. A subsequent study by the anthropologist John Michael found Morton&#x27;s original data to be more accurate than Gould describes, concluding that &quot;[c]ontrary to Gould&#x27;s interpretation... Morton&#x27;s research was conducted with integrity&quot;. Jason Lewis and colleagues reached similar conclusions as Michael in their reanalysis of Morton&#x27;s skull collection; however, they depart from Morton&#x27;s racist conclusions by adding that &quot;studies have demonstrated that modern human variation is generally continuous, rather than discrete or &quot;racial&quot;, and that most variation in modern humans is within, rather than between, populations&quot;.

In 1873, Paul Broca, founder of the Anthropological Society of Paris (1859), found the same pattern of measures—that &quot;Crania Americana&quot; reported—by weighing specimen brains at autopsy. Other historical studies, proposing a black race–white race, intelligence–brain size difference, include those by Bean (1906), Mall (1909), Pearl (1934), and Vint (1934).

===Nicolás Palacios===
After the War of the Pacific (1879–83) there was a rise of racial and national superiority ideas among the Chilean ruling class. In his 1918 book physician Nicolás Palacios argued for the existence of Chilean race and its superiority when compared to neighboring peoples. He thought Chileans were a mix of two martial races: the indigenous Mapuches and the Visigoths of Spain, who descended ultimately from Götaland in Sweden. Palacios argued on medical grounds against immigration to Chile from southern Europe claiming that Mestizos who are of south European stock lack &quot;cerebral control&quot; and are a social burden.

===Monogenism and polygenism===
Samuel Morton&#x27;s followers, especially Dr Josiah C. Nott (1804–1873) and George Gliddon (1809–1857), extended Dr Morton&#x27;s ideas in &quot;Types of Mankind&quot; (1854), claiming that Morton&#x27;s findings supported the notion of polygenism (mankind has discrete genetic ancestries; the races are evolutionarily unrelated), which is a predecessor of the modern human multiregional origin hypothesis. Moreover, Morton himself had been reluctant to espouse polygenism, because it theologically challenged the Christian creation myth espoused in the Bible.

Later, in &quot;The Descent of Man&quot; (1871), Charles Darwin proposed the single-origin hypothesis, i.e., monogenism—mankind has a common genetic ancestry, the races are related, opposing everything that the polygenism of Nott and Gliddon proposed.

===Typologies===
One of the first typologies used to classify various human races was invented by Georges Vacher de Lapouge (1854–1936), a theoretician of eugenics, who published in 1899 (&quot;The Aryan and his social role&quot;). In this book, he classified humanity into various, hierarchized races, spanning from the &quot;Aryan white race, dolichocephalic&quot;, to the &quot;brachycephalic&quot;, &quot;mediocre and inert&quot; race, best represented by Southern European, Catholic peasants&quot;. Between these, Vacher de Lapouge identified the &quot;&quot;Homo europaeus&quot; (Teutonic, Protestant, etc.), the &quot;Homo alpinus&quot; (Auvergnat, Turkish, etc.), and finally the &quot;Homo mediterraneus&quot;&quot; (Neapolitan, Andalus, etc.) Jews were dolichocephalic like the Aryans, according to Lapouge, but exactly for this reason he considered them to be dangerous; they were the only group, he thought, threatening to displace the Aryan aristocracy. Vacher de Lapouge became one of the leading inspirators of Nazi antisemitism and Nazi racist ideology.

Vacher de Lapouge&#x27;s classification was mirrored in William Z. Ripley in &quot;The Races of Europe&quot; (1899), a book which had a large influence on American white supremacism. Ripley even made a map of Europe according to the alleged cephalic index of its inhabitants. He was an important influence of the American eugenist Madison Grant.

Furthermore, according to John Efron of Indiana University, the late 19th century also witnessed &quot;the scientizing of anti-Jewish prejudice&quot;, stigmatizing Jews with male menstruation, pathological hysteria, and nymphomania. At the same time, several Jews, such as Joseph Jacobs or Samuel Weissenberg, also endorsed the same pseudoscientific theories, convinced that the Jews formed a distinct race. Chaim Zhitlovsky also attempted to define &quot;Yiddishkayt&quot; (Ashkenazi Jewishness) by turning to contemporary racial theory.

Joseph Deniker (1852–1918) was one of William Z. Ripley&#x27;s principal opponents; whereas Ripley maintained, as did Vacher de Lapouge, that the European populace comprised three races, Joseph Deniker proposed that the European populace comprised ten races (six primary and four sub-races). Furthermore, he proposed that the concept of &quot;race&quot; was ambiguous, and in its stead proposed the compound word &quot;ethnic group&quot;, which later prominently featured in the works of Julian Huxley and Alfred C. Haddon. Moreover, Ripley argued that Deniker&#x27;s &quot;race&quot; idea should be denoted a &quot;type&quot;, because it was less biologically rigid than most racial classifications.

==Ideological applications==
===Nordicism===
Joseph Deniker&#x27;s contribution to racist theory was (the Nordic race), a generic, racial-stock descriptor, which the American eugenicist Madison Grant (1865–1937) presented as the white racial engine of world civilization. Having adopted Ripley&#x27;s three-race European populace model, but disliking the &quot;Teuton&quot; race name, he transliterated into &#x27;the Nordic race&#x27;, the acme of the concocted racial hierarchy, based upon his racial classification theory, popular in the 1910s and 1920s.

The State Institute for Racial Biology (Swedish: ) and its director Herman Lundborg in Sweden were active in racist research. Furthermore, much of early research on Ural-Altaic languages was coloured by attempts at justifying the view that European peoples east of Sweden were Asian and thus of an inferior race, justifying colonialism, eugenics and racial hygiene. The book &quot;The Passing of the Great Race&quot; (Or, The Racial Basis of European History) by American eugenicist, lawyer, and amateur anthropologist Madison Grant was published in 1916. Though influential, the book was largely ignored when it first appeared, and it went through several revisions and editions. Nevertheless, the book was used by people who advocated restricted immigration as justification for what became known as scientific racism.

===Justification of slavery in the United States===
In the United States, scientific racism justified Black African slavery to assuage moral opposition to the Atlantic slave trade. In 1972, Alexander Thomas and Samuell Sillen documented how blacks&#x27; supposed &quot;primitive mentality&quot;
was used to justify black men as uniquely fitted for bondage. In 1851, in antebellum Louisiana, the physician Samuel A. Cartwright (1793–1863) wrote of slave escape attempts as &quot;drapetomania&quot;, a treatable mental illness, that &quot;with proper medical advice, strictly followed, this troublesome practice that many Negroes have of running away can be almost entirely prevented&quot;. The term &quot;drapetomania&quot; (mania of the runaway slave) derives from the Greek (, &#x27;a runaway [slave]&#x27;) and (, &#x27;madness, frenzy&#x27;). Cartwright also described &quot;dysaesthesia aethiopica&quot;, called &quot;rascality&quot; by overseers. The 1840 United States census claimed that Northern, free blacks suffered mental illness at higher rates than did their Southern, enslaved counterparts. Though the census was later found to have been severely flawed by the American Statistical Association, it became a political weapon against abolitionists. Southern slavers concluded that escaping Negroes were suffering from &quot;mental disorders&quot;.

At the time of the American Civil War (1861–1865), the matter of miscegenation prompted studies of ostensible physiological differences between Caucasians and Negroes. Early anthropologists, such as Josiah Clark Nott, George Robins Gliddon, Robert Knox, and Samuel George Morton, aimed to scientifically prove that Negroes were a human species different from the white people; that the rulers of Ancient Egypt were not African; and that mixed-race offspring (the product of miscegenation) tended to physical weakness and infertility. After the Civil War, Southern (Confederacy) physicians wrote textbooks of scientific racism based upon studies claiming that black freemen (ex-slaves) were becoming extinct, because they were inadequate to the demands of being a free man—implying that black people benefited from enslavement.

In &quot;Medical Apartheid&quot;, Harriet A. Washington noted the prevalence of two different views on blacks in the 19th century: the belief that they were inferior and &quot;riddled with imperfections from head to toe&quot;, and the idea that they did not know true pain and suffering because of their primitive nervous systems (and that slavery was therefore justifiable). Washington noted the failure of scientists to accept the inconsistency between these two viewpoints, writing that:
Even after the end of the Civil War, some scientists continued to justify the institution of slavery by citing the effect of topography and climate on racial development. Nathaniel Shaler, a prominent geologist at Harvard University from 1869 to 1906, published the book &quot;Man and the Earth&quot; in 1905 describing the physical geography of different continents and linking these geologic settings to the intelligence and strength of human races that inhabited these spaces. Shaler argued that North American climate and geology was ideally suited for the institution of slavery.

===South African apartheid===

Scientific racism played a role in establishing apartheid in South Africa. In South Africa, white scientists, like Dudly Kidd, who published &quot;The essential Kafir&quot; in 1904, sought to &quot;understand the African mind&quot;. They believed that the cultural differences between whites and blacks in South Africa might be caused by physiological differences in the brain. Rather than suggesting that Africans were &quot;overgrown children&quot;, as early white explorers had, Kidd believed that Africans were &quot;misgrown with a vengeance&quot;. He described Africans as at once &quot;hopelessly deficient&quot;, yet &quot;very shrewd&quot;.

The Carnegie Commission on the Poor White Problem in South Africa played a key role in establishing apartheid in South Africa. According to one memorandum sent to Frederick Keppel, then president of the Carnegie Corporation, there was &quot;little doubt that if the natives were given full economic opportunity, the more competent among them would soon outstrip the less competent whites&quot;. Keppel&#x27;s support for the project of creating the report was motivated by his concern with the maintenance of existing racial boundaries. The preoccupation of the Carnegie Corporation with the so-called poor white problem in South Africa was at least in part the outcome of similar misgivings about the state of poor whites in the southern United States.

The report was five volumes in length. Around the start of the 20th century, white Americans, and whites elsewhere in the world, felt uneasy because poverty and economic depression seemed to strike people regardless of race.

Though the ground work for apartheid began earlier, the report provided support for this central idea of black inferiority. This was used to justify racial segregation and discrimination in the following decades. The report expressed fear about the loss of white racial pride, and in particular pointed to the danger that the poor white would not be able to resist the process of &quot;Africanisation&quot;.

Although scientific racism played a role in justifying and supporting institutional racism in South Africa, it was not as important in South Africa as it has been in Europe and the United States. This was due in part to the &quot;poor white problem&quot;, which raised serious questions for supremacists about white racial superiority. Since poor whites were found to be in the same situation as natives in the African environment, the idea that intrinsic white superiority could overcome any environment did not seem to hold. As such, scientific justifications for racism were not as useful in South Africa.

===Eugenics===
Stephen Jay Gould described Madison Grant&#x27;s &quot;The Passing of the Great Race&quot; (1916) as &quot;the most influential tract of American scientific racism&quot;. In the 1920s–30s, the German racial hygiene movement embraced Grant&#x27;s Nordic theory. Alfred Ploetz (1860–1940) coined the term in &quot;Racial Hygiene Basics&quot; (1895), and founded the German Society for Racial Hygiene in 1905. The movement advocated selective breeding, compulsory sterilization, and a close alignment of public health with eugenics.

Racial hygiene was historically tied to traditional notions of public health, but with emphasis on heredity—what philosopher and historian Michel Foucault has called state racism. In 1869, Francis Galton (1822–1911) proposed the first social measures meant to preserve or enhance biological characteristics, and later coined the term &quot;eugenics&quot;. Galton, a statistician, introduced correlation and regression analysis and discovered regression toward the mean. He was also the first to study human differences and inheritance of intelligence with statistical methods. He introduced the use of questionnaires and surveys to collect data on population sets, which he needed for genealogical and biographical works and for anthropometric studies. Galton also founded psychometrics, the science of measuring mental faculties, and differential psychology, a branch of psychology concerned with psychological differences between people rather than common traits.

Like scientific racism, eugenics grew popular in the early 20th century, and both ideas influenced Nazi racial policies and Nazi eugenics. In 1901, Galton, Karl Pearson (1857–1936) and Walter F. R. Weldon (1860–1906) founded the &quot;Biometrika&quot; scientific journal, which promoted biometrics and statistical analysis of heredity. Charles Davenport (1866–1944) was briefly involved in the review. In &quot;Race Crossing in Jamaica&quot; (1929), he made statistical arguments that biological and cultural degradation followed white and black interbreeding. Davenport was connected to Nazi Germany before and during World War II. In 1939 he wrote a contribution to the &quot;festschrift&quot; for Otto Reche (1879–1966), who became an important figure within the plan to remove populations considered &quot;inferior&quot; from eastern Germany.

==Interbellum to World War II==
Scientific racism continued through the early 20th century, and soon intelligence testing became a new source for racial comparisons. Before World War II (1939–45), scientific racism remained common to anthropology, and was used as justification for eugenics programs, compulsory sterilization, anti-miscegenation laws, and immigration restrictions in Europe and the United States. The war crimes and crimes against humanity of Nazi Germany (1933–45) discredited scientific racism in academia, but racist legislation based upon it remained in some countries until the late 1960s.

===Early intelligence testing and the Immigration Act of 1924===

Before the 1920s, social scientists agreed that whites were superior to blacks, but they needed a way to prove this to back social policy in favor of whites. They felt the best way to gauge this was through testing intelligence. By interpreting the tests to show favor to whites these test makers&#x27; research results portrayed all minority groups very negatively. In 1908, Henry Goddard translated the Binet intelligence test from French and in 1912 began to apply the test to incoming immigrants on Ellis Island. Some claim that in a study of immigrants Goddard reached the conclusion that 87% of Russians, 83% of Jews, 80% of Hungarians, and 79% of Italians were feeble-minded and had a mental age less than 12. Some have also claimed that this information was taken as &quot;evidence&quot; by lawmakers and thus it affected social policy for years. Bernard Davis has pointed out that, in the first sentence of his paper, Goddard wrote that the subjects of the study were not typical members of their groups but were selected because of their suspected sub-normal intelligence. Davis has further noted that Goddard argued that the low IQs of the test subjects were more likely due to environmental rather than genetic factors, and that Goddard concluded that &quot;we may be confident that their children will be of average intelligence and if rightly brought up will be good citizens&quot;. In 1996 the American Psychological Association&#x27;s Board of Scientific Affairs stated that IQ tests were not discriminatory towards any ethnic/racial groups.

In his book &quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot;, Stephen Jay Gould argued that intelligence testing results played a major role in the passage of the Immigration Act of 1924 that restricted immigration to the United States. However, Mark Snyderman and Richard J. Herrnstein, after studying the Congressional Record and committee hearings related to the Immigration Act, concluded &quot;the [intelligence] testing community did not generally view its findings as favoring restrictive immigration policies like those in the 1924 Act, and Congress took virtually no notice of intelligence testing&quot;.

Juan N. Franco contested the findings of Snyderman and Herrnstein. Franco stated that even though Snyderman and Herrnstein reported that the data collected from the results of the intelligence tests were in no way used to pass The Immigration Act of 1924, the IQ test results were still taken into consideration by legislators. As suggestive evidence, Franco pointed to the following fact: Following the passage of the immigration act, information from the 1890 census was used to set quotas based on percentages of immigrants coming from different countries. Based on these data, the legislature restricted the entrance of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe into the United States and allowed more immigrants from northern and Western Europe into the country. The use of the 1900, 1910 or 1920 census data sets would have resulted in larger numbers of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe being allowed into the U.S. However, Franco pointed out that using the 1890 census data allowed congress to exclude southern and eastern Europeans (who performed worse on IQ tests of the time than did western and northern Europeans) from the U.S. Franco argued that the work Snyderman and Herrnstein conducted on this matter neither proved or disproved that intelligence testing influenced immigration laws.

=== Sweden ===
Following the creation of the first society for the promotion of racial hygiene, the German Society for Racial Hygiene in 1905—a Swedish society was founded in 1909 as the , the third in the world. By lobbying Swedish parliamentarians and medical institutes the society managed to pass a decree creating a government-run institute in the form of the Swedish State Institute for Racial Biology in 1921. By 1922 the institute was built and opened in Uppsala. It was the first such government-funded institute in the world performing research into &quot;racial biology&quot; and remains highly controversial to this day. It was the most prominent institution for the study of &quot;racial science&quot; in Sweden. The goal was to cure criminality, alcoholism and psychiatric problems through research in eugenics and racial hygiene. As a result of the institute&#x27;s work, a law permitting compulsory sterilization of certain groups was enacted in Sweden in 1934. The second president of the institute Gunnar Dahlberg was highly critical of the validity of the science performed at the institute and reshaped the institute toward a focus on genetics. In 1958 it closed down and all remaining research was moved to the Department of Medical Genetics at Uppsala University.

===Nazi Germany===

The Nazi Party and its sympathizers published many books on scientific racism, seizing on the eugenicist and antisemitic ideas with which they were widely associated, although these ideas had been in circulation since the 19th century. Books such as (&quot;Racial Science of the German People&quot;) by Hans Günther (first published in 1922) and (&quot;Race and Soul&quot;) by (published under different titles between 1926 and 1934) attempted to scientifically identify differences between the German, Nordic, or Aryan people and other, supposedly inferior, groups. German schools used these books as texts during the Nazi era. In the early 1930s, the Nazis used racialized scientific rhetoric based on social Darwinism to push its restrictive and discriminatory social policies.

During World War II, Nazi racialist beliefs became anathema in the United States, and Boasians such as Ruth Benedict consolidated their institutional power. After the war, discovery of the Holocaust and Nazi abuses of scientific research (such as Josef Mengele&#x27;s ethical violations and other war crimes revealed at the Nuremberg Trials) led most of the scientific community to repudiate scientific support for racism.

Propaganda for the Nazi eugenics program began with propaganda for eugenic sterilization. Articles in &quot;Neues Volk&quot; described the appearance of the mentally ill and the importance of preventing such births. Photographs of mentally incapacitated children were juxtaposed with those of healthy children. The film &quot;Das Erbe&quot; showed conflict in nature in order to legitimize the Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring by sterilization.

Although the child was &quot;the most important treasure of the people&quot;, this did not apply to all children, even German ones, only to those with no hereditary weaknesses. Nazi Germany&#x27;s racially based social policies placed the improvement of the Aryan race through eugenics at the center of Nazi ideology. People targeted by this policy included criminals, &quot;degenerates&quot;, &quot;dissidents&quot; who opposed the Nazification of Germany, the &quot;feeble minded&quot;, Jewish people, homosexuals, the insane, idle and &quot;weak&quot;. As they were seen as people who fit the criteria of &quot;life unworthy of life&quot; (), they should thus not be allowed to procreate and pass on their genes or heritage. Although they were still regarded as &quot;Aryan&quot;, Nazi ideology deemed Slavs (i.e., Poles, Russians, Ukrainians, etc.) to be racially inferior to the Germanic master race, suitable for expulsion, enslavement, or even extermination.

Adolf Hitler banned intelligence quotient (IQ) testing for being &quot;Jewish&quot;.

===United States===

In the 20th century, concepts of scientific racism, which sought to prove the physical and mental inadequacy of groups deemed &quot;inferior&quot;, was relied upon to justify involuntary sterilization programs. Such programs, promoted by eugenicists such as Harry H. Laughlin, were upheld as constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;Buck v. Bell&quot; (1927). In all, between 60,000 and 90,000 Americans were subjected to involuntary sterilization.

Scientific racism was also used as a justification for the Emergency Quota Act of 1921 and the Immigration Act of 1924 (Johnson–Reed Act), which imposed racial quotas limiting Italian American immigration to the United States and immigration from other southern European and eastern European nations. Proponents of these quotas, who sought to block &quot;undesirable&quot; immigrants, justifying restrictions by invoking scientific racism.

Lothrop Stoddard published many racialist books on what he saw as the peril of immigration, his most famous being &quot;The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy&quot; in 1920. In this book he presented a view of the world situation pertaining to race focusing concern on the coming population explosion among the &quot;colored&quot; peoples of the world and the way in which &quot;white world-supremacy&quot; was being lessened in the wake of World War I and the collapse of colonialism.

Stoddard&#x27;s analysis divided world politics and situations into &quot;white&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;black&quot;, &quot;Amerindian&quot;, and &quot;brown&quot; peoples and their interactions. Stoddard argued race and heredity were the guiding factors of history and civilization, and that the elimination or absorption of the &quot;white&quot; race by &quot;colored&quot; races would result in the destruction of Western civilization. Like Madison Grant, Stoddard divided the white race into three main divisions: Nordic, Alpine, and Mediterranean. He considered all three to be of good stock, and far above the quality of the colored races, but argued that the Nordic was the greatest of the three and needed to be preserved by way of eugenics. Unlike Grant, Stoddard was less concerned with which varieties of European people were superior to others (Nordic theory), but was more concerned with what he called &quot;bi-racialism&quot;, seeing the world as being composed of simply &quot;colored&quot; and &quot;white&quot; races. In the years after the Great Migration and World War I, Grant&#x27;s racial theory would fall out of favor in the U.S. in favor of a model closer to Stoddard&#x27;s.

An influential publication was &quot;The Races of Europe&quot; (1939) by Carleton S. Coon, president of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists from 1930 to 1961. Coon was a proponent of multiregional origin of modern humans. He divided &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; into five main races: Caucasoid, Mongoloid (including Native Americans), Australoid, Congoid, and Capoid.

Coon&#x27;s school of thought was the object of increasing opposition in mainstream anthropology after World War II. Ashley Montagu was particularly vocal in denouncing Coon, especially in his &quot;Man&#x27;s Most Dangerous Myth: The Fallacy of Race&quot;. By the 1960s, Coon&#x27;s approach had been rendered obsolete in mainstream anthropology, but his system continued to appear in publications by his student John Lawrence Angel as late as in the 1970s.

In the late 19th century, the &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; (1896) United States Supreme Court decision—which upheld the constitutional legality of racial segregation under the doctrine of &quot;separate but equal&quot;—was intellectually rooted in the racism of the era, as was the popular support for the decision. Later, in the mid-20th century, the Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka&quot; (1954) decision rejected racialist arguments about the &quot;need&quot; for racial segregation—especially in public schools.

==After 1945==
By 1954, 58 years after the &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; upholding of racial segregation in the United States, American popular and scholarly opinions of scientific racism and its sociologic practice had evolved.

In 1960, the journal &quot;Mankind Quarterly&quot; was founded, which is commonly described as a venue for scientific racism and white supremacy, and as lacking a legitimate scholarly purpose. The journal was founded in 1960, partly in response to the Supreme Court decision &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; which desegregated the American public school system.

In April 1966, Alex Haley interviewed American Nazi Party founder George Lincoln Rockwell for &quot;Playboy&quot;. Rockwell justified his belief that blacks were inferior to whites by citing a long 1916 study by G. O. Ferguson which claimed to show that the intellectual performance of black students was correlated with their percentage of white ancestry, stating &quot;pure negroes, negroes three-fourths pure, mulattoes and quadroons have, roughly, 60, 70, 80 and 90 percent, respectively, of white intellectual efficiency&quot;. &quot;Playboy&quot; later published the interview with an editorial note claiming the study was a &quot;discredited ... pseudoscientific rationale for racism&quot;.

International bodies such as UNESCO attempted to draft resolutions that would summarize the state of scientific knowledge about race and issued calls for the resolution of racial conflicts. In its 1950 &quot;The Race Question&quot;, UNESCO did not reject the idea of a biological basis to racial categories, but instead defined a race as: &quot;A race, from the biological standpoint, may therefore be defined as one of the group of populations constituting the species Homo sapiens&quot;, which were broadly defined as the Caucasian, Mongoloid, Negroid races but stated that &quot;It is now generally recognized that intelligence tests do not in themselves enable us to differentiate safely between what is due to innate capacity and what is the result of environmental influences, training and education&quot;.

Despite scientific racism being largely dismissed by the scientific community after World War II, some researchers have continued to propose theories of racial superiority in the past few decades. These authors themselves, while seeing their work as scientific, may dispute the term &quot;racism&quot; and may prefer terms such as &quot;race realism&quot; or &quot;racialism&quot;. In 2018, British science journalist and author Angela Saini expressed strong concern about the return of these ideas into the mainstream. Saini followed up on this idea with her 2019 book &quot;&quot;.

One such post-World War II scientific racism researcher is Arthur Jensen. His most prominent work is &quot;The g Factor: The Science of Mental Ability&quot; in which he supports the theory that black people are inherently less intelligent than whites. Jensen argues for differentiation in education based on race, stating that educators must &quot;take full account of &quot;all&quot; the facts of [students&#x27;] nature&quot;. Responses to Jensen criticized his lack of emphasis on environmental factors. Psychologist Sandra Scarr describes Jensen&#x27;s work as &quot;conjur[ing] up images of blacks doomed to failure by their own inadequacies&quot;.

J. Philippe Rushton, president of the Pioneer Fund (&quot;Race, Evolution, and Behavior&quot;) and a defender of Jensen&#x27;s &quot;The g Factor&quot;, also has multiple publications perpetuating scientific racism. Rushton argues &quot;race differences in brain size likely underlie their multifarious life history outcomes&quot;. Rushton&#x27;s theories are defended by other scientific racists such as Glayde Whitney. Whitney published works suggesting higher crime rates among people of African descent can be partially attributed to genetics. Whitney draws this conclusion from data showing higher crime rates among people of African descent across different regions. Other researchers point out that proponents of a genetic crime-race link are ignoring confounding social and economic variables, drawing conclusions from correlations.

Christopher Brand was a proponent of Arthur Jensen&#x27;s work on racial intelligence differences. Brand&#x27;s &quot;The g Factor: General Intelligence and Its Implications&quot; claims black people are intellectually inferior to whites. He argues the best way to combat IQ disparities is to encourage low-IQ women to reproduce with high-IQ men. He faced intense public backlash, with his work being described as a promotion of eugenics. Brand&#x27;s book was withdrawn by the publisher and he was dismissed from his position at the University of Edinburgh.

Other prominent modern proponents of scientific racism include Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein (&quot;The Bell Curve&quot;).

Kevin MacDonald, in his Culture of Critique series, used arguments from evolutionary psychology to promote antisemitic theories that Jews as a group have biologically evolved to be highly ethnocentric and hostile to the interests of white people. He asserts Jewish behavior and culture are central causes of antisemitism, and promotes conspiracy theories about alleged Jewish control and influence in government policy and political movements.

Psychologist Richard Lynn has published multiple papers and a book supporting theories of scientific racism. In &quot;IQ and the Wealth of Nations,&quot; Lynn claims that national GDP is determined largely by national average IQ. He draws this conclusion from the correlation between average IQ and GDP and argues low intelligence in African nations is the cause of their low levels of growth. Lynn&#x27;s theory has been criticized for attributing causal relationship between correlated statistics. Lynn supports scientific racism more directly in his 2002 paper &quot;Skin Color and Intelligence in African Americans&quot;, where he proposes &quot;the level of intelligence in African Americans is significantly determined by the proportion of Caucasian genes&quot;. As with &quot;IQ and the Wealth of Nations&quot;, Lynn&#x27;s methodology is flawed, and he purports a causal relationship from what is simply correlation.

Nicholas Wade&#x27;s book (&quot;A Troublesome Inheritance&quot;) faced strong backlash from the scientific community, with 142 geneticists and biologists signing a letter describing Wade&#x27;s work as &quot;misappropriation of research from our field to support arguments about differences among human societies&quot;.

On June 17, 2020, Elsevier announced it was retracting an article that J. Philippe Rushton and Donald Templer had published in 2012 in the Elsevier journal &quot;Personality and Individual Differences&quot;. The article falsely claimed that there was scientific evidence that skin color was related to aggression and sexuality in humans.

The Jena Declaration, published by the German Zoological Society, rejects the idea of human races and distances itself from the racial theories of 20th century scientists. It states that genetic variation between human populations is smaller than within them, demonstrating that the biological concept of &quot;races&quot; is invalid. The statement highlights that there are no specific genes or genetic markers that match with conventional racial categorizations. It also indicates that the idea of &quot;races&quot; is based on racism rather than any scientific factuality.

Clarence Gravlee writes that disparities in the incidence of such medical conditions as diabetes, stroke, cancer, and low birth weight should be viewed with a societal lens. He argues that social inequalities, not genetic differences between races, are the reason for these differences. He writes that genetic differences between different population groups are based on climate and geography, not race, and he calls for replacing incorrect biological explanations of racial disparities with an analysis of the social conditions that lead to disparate medical outcomes. In his book &quot;Is Science Racist&quot;, Jonathan Marks similarly asserts that races exist, though they lack a natural categorization in the realm of biology. Cultural rules such as the &quot;one-drop rule&quot; must be devised to establish categories of race, even if they go against the natural patterns within our species. According to Marks&#x27; writing, racist ideas propagated by scientists are what make science racist.

In her book &quot;Medical Apartheid&quot; Harriet Washington describes the abuse of Black people in medical research and experimentation. Black people were tricked into participating in medical experiments through the use of unclear language on consent forms and a failure to list the risks and side effects of the treatment. Washington mentions that, because Black people were denied adequate health care, they were often desperate for medical help, and medical experimenters were able to exploit that need. Washington also emphasizes that when treatments were perfected and refined as a result of those experiments, Black people almost never benefited from the treatments.

A 2018 statement by the American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) expressed alarm at the &quot;resurgence of groups rejecting the value of genetic diversity and using discredited or distorted genetic concepts to bolster bogus claims of white supremacy&quot;. The ASHG denounced this as a &quot;misuse of genetics to feed racist ideologies&quot;, and highlighted several factual errors upon which white supremacist claims have been based. The statement affirms that genetics &quot;demonstrates that humans cannot be divided into biologically distinct subcategories&quot; and that it &quot;exposes the concept of &#x27;racial purity&quot; as scientifically meaningless&quot;.

<text>Morten Thrane Brünnich (30 September 1737 – 19 September 1827) was a Danish zoologist and mineralogist.
==Biography==
Brünnich was born in Copenhagen, the son of a portrait painter. He studied oriental languages and theology, but soon became interested in natural history. He contributed his observations of insects to Erik Pontoppidan&#x27;s &quot;Danske Atlas&quot; (1763–81). After being put in charge of the natural history collection of Christian Fleischer he became interested in ornithology, and in 1764 he published &quot;Ornithologia Borealis&quot;, which included the details of many Scandinavian birds, some described for the first time.

The publication of &quot;Ornithologia Borealis&quot; was aided by his insight in the collection.

Brünnich corresponded with many foreign naturalists including Linnaeus, Peter Simon Pallas and Thomas Pennant. He published his &quot;Entomologia&quot; in 1764. He then embarked on a long tour of Europe, spending time studying the fish of the Mediterranean Sea and publishing his &quot;Ichthyologia Massiliensis&quot; on the subject in 1768.

On his return Brünnich took up the post of Lecturer in Natural History and Economy at Copenhagen University. Here he established a natural history museum and wrote a textbook for his students, the &quot;Zoologiae fundamenta&quot;.

==Namesake organisms==
Brünnich&#x27;s guillemot and the European wasp spider are named after him.

Also in 1927, botanists Hutch. &amp; Dalziel published &quot;Afrobrunnichia&quot;, which is a genus of plants in the family Polygonaceae with two species in West Africa. It was named in Morten Thrane Brünnich&#x27;s honour.

<text>The Bangkok Mass Transit System, commonly known as the BTS Skytrain ( &quot;[BTS]&quot;), is an elevated rapid transit system in Bangkok, Thailand. It is operated by Bangkok Mass Transit System PCL (BTSC), a subsidiary of BTS Group Holdings, under a concession granted by the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) which owns the lines. The system consists of 62 stations along three lines with a combined route length of . The BTS Sukhumvit Line runs northwards and south-eastwards, terminating at Khu Khot and Kheha respectively. The BTS Silom Line which serves Silom and Sathon Roads, the central business district of Bangkok, terminates at National Stadium and Bang Wa. The Gold Line people mover runs from Krung Thon Buri to Klong San and serves Iconsiam. The lines interchange at Siam station and Krung Thon Buri. The system is formally known as &quot;The Elevated Train in Commemoration of HM the King&#x27;s 6th Cycle Birthday&quot; ().

Besides the three BTS lines, Bangkok&#x27;s rapid transit system includes the underground and elevated Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) lines, the Bus Rapid Transit System (BRT), and the elevated Airport Rail Link (ARL), serving several stations before reaching Suvarnabhumi Airport, and the SRT Red Lines of the State Railway of Thailand.

==History==

Plans for mass transit in Bangkok began in the early 1980s. An early version of the Skytrain project was known as the Lavalin Skytrain because it was designed using the Vancouver SkyTrain as a model, adopting technology developed by SNC-Lavalin. Due to political interference, the concession with Lavalin was cancelled in June 1992, despite Bangkok&#x27;s chronic traffic congestion. The Thai government focused on increasing road and expressway infrastructure in an attempt to reduce congestion. This had little impact, as the number of cars on the road continued to increase dramatically. The routes considered as part of the Skytrain project would become the basis for the MRT system and are mainly underground. In the early 1990s, foundations and a viaduct for the Lavalin Skytrain were constructed in the middle of the Phra Pok Klao Bridge across the Chao Phraya River. The viaduct was redeveloped into a sky park in June 2020.

Another abortive attempt at building an elevated rail network was the Bangkok Elevated Road and Train System (BERTS), which was terminated in 1998 after only 13.77 percent had been completed.

Shortly after it became clear that the Lavalin Skytrain had stalled, then-Governor Major General Chamlong Srimuang asked his deputy, Captain Kritsada Arunwong na Ayutthaya, to create a new feeder system with a route along Sukhumvit and Silom Roads. Krisda and his team from the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) succeeded in finding a private investor. Krisda also convinced everyone concerned to allow the city supervise the project. Keeree Kanjanapas founded the Bangkok Transit System Corporation (BTSC) and it successfully financed the system and grew it from a feeder system to a full mass transit project. Thanayong Public Company Limited ) had a 28 percent stake in BTSC when the Skytrain began, and therefore in its early days the system was sometimes referred to as the &quot;Thanayong Skytrain&quot;.

Siemens, the supplier of the railway technology, and the Thai contractor, Italian Thai Development, built the system for BTSC. The &quot;Skytrain&quot; name was bestowed later by the press following the Vancouver example where the elevated metro had been named &quot;Skytrain&quot;. Originally, the Skytrain depot was to be built underneath Lumphini Park, but due to widespread objections from Bangkok residents it was constructed on a parcel of land on Phahonyothin Road, replacing the old northern/northeastern bus terminal (Mo Chit). The current depot at Mo Chit is part of the proposed &quot;Bangkok Terminal&quot; project, where a large complex composed of a new regional bus terminal, park and ride facility, and other commercial development can be built directly above it.

The Skytrain system was opened on 5 December 1999 by Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn. It initially had lower-than-predicted ridership, with 200,000 passenger trips per day. Ticket revenue was only enough to meet the trains&#x27; operating cost, and not sufficient to service construction loans. The Skytrain&#x27;s daily passenger numbers have steadily increased since then. On 9 December 2005, more than 500,000 single trips were made on the Skytrain on a single day for the first time. By September 2012, the Skytrain served around 600,000 passengers on an average day, increasing to 650,000 on an average weekday in 2013. A record 760,000 passengers traveled on Sunday, 22 December 2013, a day of mass political protest in Bangkok. The normal Sunday average is 400,000 passengers. The BTS had a fleet of 52 four-car trains (208 carriages) by 2017. 46 new four-car trains (184 carriages) were ordered to address growing capacity requirements of the existing lines to cater for the Sukhumvit Line extensions south to Kheha and north to Khu Khot. They were delivered from 2018 to 2020.&lt;ref name=&quot;BTSG-AR2017/18&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 March 2020, the BTS made a song about the COVID-19 pandemic, as an antidote to the grim warnings about the coronavirus, showing the staff dancing and keeping hygiene.

==Station layout==

The system&#x27;s stations are all elevated and designed with three distinct levels. At street level, passengers can access the stations via stairs, escalators, and lifts. This level also typically houses supporting utility equipment like generators and water tanks, often situated on traffic islands.

The first elevated level houses the ticket booths, small kiosk-style shops, and fare gates. Passengers can reach the second level (or the third level in the case of Siam station) using stairs, lifts, and escalators. This level is dedicated to the platforms and rails. Most stations adopt a side platform layout, with the notable exceptions of Siam Station, Ha Yaek Lat Phrao Station, and Samrong, which utilize island platforms. Siam Station features island platforms to enable easy cross-platform interchange between the two lines of the system.

The platform design accommodates the precise positioning of train doors, with equal distances between doors in all cars. Markings on the platform indicate where the doors will align once the train stops. Although the platforms are constructed to support six-car trains, currently, only four-car trains are operational. For added safety and assistance, security personnel are stationed at every platform and in the ticketing halls.

The Skytrain system in Thailand features five key stations – Sala Daeng, Asok, Ha Yaek Lat Phrao, Bang Wa, and Mo Chit – that serve as interchanges with the Metropolitan Rapid Transit (MRT) system. Additionally, the Saphan Taksin station is conveniently connected to the adjacent Sathon Pier, which is a stop for the Chao Phraya Express Boat services. Many of these stations are also connected to nearby buildings and public amenities through skybridges, providing easy and convenient access for pedestrians.

Since 2014, platform screen doors (half size) have been installed in several stations including On Nut, Phrom Phong, Asok, Chit Lom, Siam, Thong Lor, Phaya Thai, Victory Monument, Sala Daeng, Chong Nonsi and Surasak. However, it&#x27;s noteworthy that the installation process has not been without issues. For instance, the installation at Phrom Phong station in December 2013 led to a software problem, resulting in a six-hour shutdown of all BTS services. This shutdown caused significant traffic congestion in the city.

==Ticketing==
Fares for the Skytrain in Bangkok are determined based on the distance traveled. Initially, in 2007, a stored-value card known as the BTS Smartpass was introduced. However, in May 2012, it was replaced by the Rabbit Card, a more advanced electronic payment system. The Rabbit Card not only covers fares for the BTS and the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) but also functions as a payment method for various services and restaurants associated with the BTS.

For single journeys, passengers can purchase tickets from machines at the stations. These tickets are tapped upon entering the paid area and inserted at the exit gates, where they are retained.

The Mangmoom Card, designed for use across multiple transport systems including the Skytrain, the MRT, and the Airport Rail Link, has experienced several delays. Originally planned for a 2015 launch, it is not yet valid for use on the BTS as of the current date.

Currently, passengers need to purchase separate tickets for travel on different Bangkok train systems, namely the Skytrain and the Airport Rail Link. The MRT and the SRT Red Lines, in contrast, accept EMV (Europay, Mastercard, and Visa) contactless payment, allowing passengers to use their credit or debit cards directly at the entry gates. Additionally, passengers can purchase single-journey tickets at BTS Skytrain stations (except for the Gold Line) to any station on the MRT Pink Line and MRT Yellow Line. This is possible because Wat Phra Si Mahathat station has paid-area integration between the Sukhumvit Line and the MRT Pink Line. At Samrong station, passengers transferring between the Sukhumvit Line and the MRT Yellow Line must insert their single-journey ticket into the fare gates. The readers will then return the ticket, which passengers can tap at the other fare gates to continue their journey.

==BTS Network==

At its opening, the BTS had 23 stations on its two lines: 17 on the Sukhumvit Line and 7 on the Silom Line, with both lines interchanging at Siam. Since then, 30 additional stations have opened on the Sukhumvit Line and 6 on the Silom Line, with the latest new three stations at Gold Line.
==BTS route extensions==

In 2002, the cabinet of then Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra amended laws in order to allow private firms to finance the cost of operating the train system, while the government would undertake civil engineering works to build new extensions.

===1st extension – Silom Line south to Wongwian Yai (2009)===
On 18 October 2005, with no approval from the central government forthcoming, Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) decided to fund and complete the Silom Line route extension to Krung Thon Buri Station (S7) and Wongwian Yai Station (S8). Construction began on 13 December 2005 with completion originally expected within two years. However, problems with the tendering and installation of a new Bombardier open signalling system repeatedly pushed back the schedule. The extension finally opening on 15 May 2009. However, the single platform Saphan Taksin station which has only one track, has caused repeated delays during rush hour. In 2012, the BMA announced plans to demolish Saphan Taksin station in the future. There are now plans to construct new platforms and remove the bottleneck and keep the station which provides an important link between river boats. The plan includes redesigning the road bridges either side of the viaduct to fit the new station.

===2nd extension – Sukhumvit Line east to Bearing (2011)===
A second extension, the 5.25 km On Nut station (E9) to Bearing station (E14) started construction in August 2006. The 4 billion baht extension was again funded by the BMA. The original scheduled opening date was mid-2009. However, an unusual, prolonged delay in the tendering of the contract for the electrical and signals resulted in a two-year delay. &quot;The senior City Hall official responsible for making the purchase has apparently stalled the scheme over fears of being investigated if something went wrong with the purchase.&quot;

The BTSC was contracted by the BMA to run the extension. Subsequently, the extension did not open until over two years later on 12 August 2011. The delay in opening prompted the BMA to offer free travel for this extension until the end of 2011 as compensation. A flat fare separate from the distance based fare normal in the BTS network was then charged for this section. However, distance based fares are now used for this extension.

===3rd extension – Silom Line south to Bang Wa (2013)===
The third extension to the network, a 5.3 km, four station extension from Wongwian Yai (S8) to Bang Wa (S12) in Phasi Charoen District began construction in the 2nd quarter of 2011 with a deadline of the end of 2012. Only the stations had to be constructed as the viaduct had been completed some years prior. However, construction was delayed for many months by the 2011 Thailand floods. It eventually opened in stages. Pho Nimit opened on 12 January 2013, Talat Phlu opened on 14 February 2013, with the last two stations opening on 5 December 2013. For most of 2013, passengers changed platforms and trains at Wongwian Yai for a shuttle service to S09 and S10 as there was no turnout at S10 for through trains. Since the opening of the final section of the extension to Bang Wa station on 5 December 2013, this is no longer the case.

===4th extension – Sukhumvit Line east to Kheha (2017-2018)===
Construction started in April 2012 for a , seven station extension from Bearing station (E14) to Samut Prakan Station (E23). The extension is being built by Ch. Karnchang. Two stations (E18 &amp; E22) will be built at a later date. The extension was funded by the MRTA as it is outside BMA city limits. The extension was planned to open in 2017. In April 2013, the MRTA awarded Ch Karnchang the contract for track laying and electrical systems. Construction was completed in 2017, but arguments over who should operate the line delayed the opening. One station, Samrong opened earlier, on 3 April 2017. The full extension opened on 6 December 2018 and the BTSC has announced that the free travel concession on this section will continue until the new train sets arrive to allow for the new section to be fully functional.

===5th extension – Sukhumvit Line north to Khu Khot (2019-2020)===
*1) Mo Chit station to Saphan Mai: 11.4 km, 12 stations (N9–N20).
*2) Saphan Mai to Khu Khot: 7.5 km, four stations (N21-N24).
An 11.4 km, 12 station northern extension from Mo Chit station to Saphan Mai in Don Mueang District has been planned since the Sukhumvit Line opened. Originally, this extension was scheduled to be completed by 2008. However, due to a combination of changes in government, a prolonged environmental study, and problems with locating a suitable train depot, the extension has been continually delayed.

A further 16.5 km, nine station extension from Saphan Mai to Lam Lukka was also planned once the extension to Saphan Mai had been completed. This was subsequently split into two extensions. A 7.5 km, four station extension to Khu Khot and a 9 km, five station extension along Lam Luk Ka Road to Lam Luk Ka.

Due to the significant delay in the northern extension plans, in mid-2013 it was decided by the MRTA to tender extensions (1) &amp; (2) at the same time by the end of 2013. However, the dissolution of parliament in November 2013 delayed this yet again. A tender was finally released in January 2014 with an April deadline before being delayed until late May 2014 due to concerns from bidders.

A military coup in late-May suspended the bidding process while the military administration reviewed all major projects. In late-June, the military administration affirmed the tender which will proceed before the end of 2014. In mid-August, the MRTA announced that the new tender deadline would be 30 September 2014. Five bidders qualified with successful bids to be announced by December. The contract to construct the line for both extensions (1) &amp; (2) was finally signed in April 2015 and the full extension was scheduled to open in 2020.

Testing of the final 9.8 km, 7 station section from Wat Phra Sri Mahathat (N17) to Khu Khot (N24) began on 5 October and continued until the full extension opens. It was officially inaugurated on 16 December 2020 by the Prime Minister.

Opening dates
# The first section to Ha Yaek Lat Phrao station (N9) opened on 9 August 2019;
# the next 4 stations from Ha Yaek Lat Phrao station (N9) to Kasetsart University (N13) opened on 4 December 2019;
# further 4 stations from Kasetsart University (N13) to Wat Phra Sri Mahathat (N17) opened on 5 June 2020;
# the remaining section of 9.8 km and 7 stations from Wat Phra Sri Mahathat (N17) to Khu Khot (N24) opened on 16 December 2020.

===Saint Louis (S4) infill station – Silom Line (2021)===
In 2018, it was decided to finally build the missing Saint Louis BTS Station (S4) station (originally named Sueksa Wittaya), the EIA was finalised in March 2019. Construction of the station began in August 2019 and by the end of 2019 had reached 25% progress. By August 2020, construction had reached 50% but was 30% behind schedule due to COVID related delays.

The station opened on 8 February 2021.

==Future extension plans==

BTS Group Holdings will tender to operate more BTS and MRT lines in the future through financing from its BTS Rail Mass Transit Growth Infrastructure Fund after it received approval from the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission in March 2013. The IPO raised US$2.1 billion, the largest in Thailand&#x27;s history.

===Sukhumvit Line, north===
A further 9 km, five station extension from Khu Khot station to Wongwaen-Lam Luk Ka station is planned to be constructed by 2029.

===Sukhumvit Line, east===
* A further 7 km, five-station extension from Kheha station to Bang Pu station is planned to be constructed by 2029.
* A spur line from Bang Na to Suvarnabhumi Airport (terminating at future South Passenger Terminal of Suvarnabhumi Airport). However, this may also be built as a light rail.

===Silom Line, south===
After the opening of Wutthakat (S11) and Bang Wa (S12) stations 5 December 2013, the BMA announced a new proposal to further extended the Silom Line by 7 km from Bang Wa (S12) station, by six stations to Taling Chan. At Taling Chan it would connect with the SRT Light Red line.

A public hearing was held in 2015. Three route options were considered, with construction intended to start in 2017. Part of the basis for this further extension by the BMA is that it would provide proximate access to the Southern Bus Terminal. The BMA Transport and Traffic Office completed an economic evaluation of the extension in October 2018 which found a cost benefit ratio of 2.37. The study recommended that an EIA be completed in 2019 but this was delayed.

In 2022, Department of Rail Transport (&quot;DRT&quot;) was announced that the Silom Line will be part of the new M-Map 2 action plan. This plan will be extended the Silom Line from Bang Wa (S12) to Bang Rak Noi Tha It (S23) on the Ratchaphruek road by 18 kilometers and 11 stations. The first part of the extension will be end at Taling Chan (S16) to connect with the SRT Light Red line. The second part of the extension will be end at Bang Rak Noi Tha It (S23) in Nonthaburi province to connect with the MRT Purple Line at current MRT station. In this extension, DRT proposed the new main depot to separate the system depot from the Sukhumvit Line. Which make the Silom Line will be completely standalone system. However, the extension will be start until the Saphan Taksin station (S6) was renovated into double track.

===Silom Line, west===
The Silom Line is planned to be extended by one or two stations west along Rama 1 from National Stadium (W1) to link with the SRT Dark Red Line at Yot Se station. However, no time frame for this extension has been announced and this section of the SRT Dark Red Line will not be built until after 2022.

Originally, the plan was to extend the Silom Line west from National Stadium into Chinatown, then north to Democracy Monument where it would then run west to Rattanakosin Island and Sanam Luang, tunnel under the river to the Thonburi side before terminating at Phran Nok. However, this plan was shelved in 2009 and much of this route has been replaced by routing changes to the planned MRT Orange Line.
== Terminal stations ==

Terminal stations and physical ends of their lines are Khu Khot, Kheha, National Stadium, Bang Wa.

Some trains terminate early and resume travel in the opposite direction at Kasetsart University, Mo Chit, and Samrong. This allows more frequent trains on the central sections of the lines without added investment in carriages.

==Rolling stock==

The BTS Skytrain uses two variations of electric multiple unit rolling stock. All operate on . All trains have four doors on each side per car, an air-conditioning unit, and LCD monitors for public announcement and advertising. Public announcements are spoken by actress . The power supply for all trains is at 750 V DC from the third rail.

===Siemens trains===
====First order (EMU-A1)====

The rolling stock of BTS Skytrain, in use when the line opened in 1999, consisted of 35 Siemens Modular Metro trains from Siemens. These initial trains had three cars, two motor cars and one trailer in the center. The Sukhumvit Line used 20 trains, and the Silom Line had 15.

After the 12 new car CNR trains were delivered for the Silom Line in December 2010, the 15 Siemens trains on the Silom Line were transferred to the Sukhumvit Line.

====Second order: extra cars to expand to four-car train operations (EMU-A1)====
To increase capacity, in October 2010, BTSC ordered an extra 35 single cars from Siemens to make each train a four car set.

These extra cars were progressively introduced into operation from November 2012 to March 2013, when all 35 sets of Siemens rolling stock finally became four car sets.

The Silom Line cars have been modified to support a signaling system from Bombardier Transportation since the extension from Saphan Taksin to Wong Wian Yai.

EMU-A1 Formation 

• Car 3 was added later

====Third order: new four-car sets for extension operations (EMU-A2)====

To serve the Sukhumvit Line Extension (East) BTSC ordered 22 new Siemens four-car trains from a consortium of Siemens and Bozankaya in May 2016.

These trains were manufactured in the Bozankaya factory in Ankara, Turkey. Siemens supplied bogies, traction, braking, and auxiliary systems and was responsible for project management, development, construction, and commissioning of the trains. Siemens will also take on service and maintenance for 16 years.

The first set of the new batch of rolling stock arrived in early August 2018 for testing and approval by the BTSC. These new trains increase capacity from 1,490 passengers per train to 1,572. As of the opening of the new Sukhumvit Line extension to Kheha Samut Prakan on 6 December 2018, only 3 sets of the 22 sets had been delivered. This resulted in a limited 10-minute frequency, shuttle service for the new extension as an interim measure until more rolling stock is delivered.

The train features: Perch Seats, LCD Dynamic Route Map (AKA. Passengers Information Display)
===CNR Changchun trains===
====First order (EMU-B1)====
In early 2008, the BTSC ordered 12 new trains (12 sets of four cars) from Changchun Railway Vehicles (EMU B class) to cater for the then soon to open Wong Wian Yai extension of the Silom Line. Their design was modified to the existing BTS&#x27;s Siemens Modular Metro. The new trains were delivered late and only began service the Silom Line in December 2010. This was some 18 months after the Wong Wian Yai and Krung Thonburi stations were opened in May 2009 during which time there was severe overcrowding on the Silom Line.

These trains consist of two-motor cars and two-trailer cars (i.e., four-car trainsets) and feature LCD TVs for public announcements and advertising. An advanced digital voice announcement (DVA) and passenger information systems was installed.

====Second order (EMU-B2)====
In September 2011, the BTSC ordered five more four-car trainsets of CNR rolling stock for 1.5 billion baht to prepare for the Silom Line extension to Bang Wa which was then due to open in December 2012. These five new train sets of rolling stock entered service on 29 November 2013 after the first two stations of the Silom Line extension to Bang Wa opened in January and February 2013, respectively. This second batch of CNR EMUs (B Class) differ slightly from the first batch in exterior fitting out such as with the LCDs screens, LED route displays, signage, and passenger communication units.

EMU-B1/B2 Formation
===CRRC Changchun trains (EMU-B3)===

In May 2016, BTSC has signed a contract to order 24 more four-car trains of CRRC Changchun Railway Vehicles rolling stock to prepare for the Sukhumvit Line extension (North) and to cater for increasing demand, with expected delivery in 2018.

It has delivered 24 of its cars to Mo Chit Depot. 24 cars are now operating its service on the Silom Line and Sukhumvit Line (Car 75–98)

This train features: Perch Seats, LCD Dynamic Route Map (AKA. Passengers Information Display)
==Ridership==

The first years of operations saw limited ridership. The line had few direct ramps into malls and lacked escalators. Little by little, while escalators were installed and side bridges added, patronage increased. The opening of Siam Paragon Mall in 2004, at the time Thailand&#x27;s most luxurious mall, boosted crowds at the system&#x27;s central Siam station. The redevelopment of the Ratchaprasong and Siam districts as well as new &quot;skywalks&quot; fostered growing accessibility.

Ridership grew steadily with incremental expansion of the lines, and at peak hour, the trains sometimes depart without being able to take all waiting passengers. Average daily ridership first surpassed 200,000 in June 2001, 300,000 in November 2003, 400,000 in March 2006, 500,000 in August 2011, 600,000 in August 2013 and 700,000 in November 2017. Ridership decreased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand.

From 25 January to 31 January 2025, Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra has implemented a policy of free public transportation in Bangkok for one week. This measure aims to address the worsening air pollution caused by surging dust levels across all districts of the capital.

<text>up2date, also known as the Red Hat Update Agent, is a tool used by older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS and Fedora Core that downloads and installs new software and upgrades the operating system. It functions as a front-end to the RPM Package Manager and adds advanced features such as automatic dependency resolution. The file specifies where up2date will search for packages.

==Tool==
By default, Red Hat Enterprise Linux&#x27;s up2date retrieves packages from a Red Hat Network (RHN) server, though users can add directories full of packages or even Debian and yum repositories if they wish.

up2date on Fedora Core defaults to retrieving packages from yum repositories. Again, other sources can be added (apart from RHN, which is Red Hat Enterprise Linux Specific). As of Fedora Core 5 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, up2date is no longer shipped with the distribution; yum is used instead.

CentOS&#x27;s up2date downloads packages from yum repositories on the CentOS Mirror Network .

<doc id="487105" wikidata="Q1030752" url="?curid=487105" title="Salient (military)">
<text>A salient, also known as a bulge, is a battlefield feature that projects into enemy territory. The salient is surrounded by the enemy on multiple sides, making the troops occupying the salient vulnerable. The opponent&#x27;s front line that borders a salient is referred to as a re-entrant – that is, an angle pointing inwards. A deep salient is vulnerable to being &quot;pinched off&quot; through the base, and this will result in a pocket in which the forces in the salient become isolated and without a supply line. On the other hand, a breakout of the forces within the salient through its tip can threaten the rear areas of the opposing forces outside it, leaving them open to an attack from behind.

==Implementation==
Salients can be formed in a number of ways. An attacker can produce a salient in the defender&#x27;s line by either intentionally making a pincer movement around the military flanks of a strongpoint, which becomes the tip of the salient, or by making a broad, frontal attack which is held up in the centre but advances on the flanks. An attacker would usually produce a salient in his own line by making a broad, frontal attack that is successful only in the center, which becomes the tip of the salient. A salient can also be formed if the attacking army feigns retreat, tricking the defending forces to chase them down, leading to the main army being on all sides in a pre-arranged ambush.

In trench warfare, salients are distinctly defined by the opposing lines of trenches, and they were commonly formed by the failure of a broad frontal attack. The static nature of the trenches meant that forming a pocket was difficult, but the vulnerable nature of salients meant that they were often the focus of attrition battles.

=== Examples ===
* American Civil War
** On the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg, Union General Daniel Sickles moved his III Corps ahead of the main line of the Union Army without orders, causing him to be nearly cut off from the main army when the Confederate Army attacked. Sickles had held a similar position at Catherine&#x27;s Furnace in the Battle of Chancellorsville two months earlier, and in both cases his corps was badly mauled and had to be rescued by other units.
** At the Battle of Spotsylvania, the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia arrived first at a strategic crossroads, and constructed a timber-reinforced line of trenches to stand against the numerically superior Union Army of the Potomac. The trench line bulged forward to protect a piece of high ground, in a curve that became known as the Mule Shoe Salient. Union troops concentrated their attack on this point, broke through, and 22 hours of brutal, hand-to-hand fighting ensued before the Confederates pulled back to a new position.
* World War I
** The British occupied a large salient at Ypres for most of the war. Formed as a result of the First Battle of Ypres, it became one of the most bloody sectors of the Western Front. So enduring was the feature and so dreadful its reputation that when British infantry spoke of &quot;The Salient&quot;, it was understood that they were referring to Ypres.
** A similar salient existed around the French city of Verdun; the Battle of Verdun around it cost both sides heavy casualties.
** The Germans occupied a small salient in front of Fromelles called the Sugarloaf due to its distinctive shape. Being small, it provided advantage to the occupiers by allowing them to enfilade the stretches of no man&#x27;s land on either flank.
* World War II
** The Soviet Union occupied a massive, 150 km deep salient at Kursk that became the site of the largest tank battle in history and a decisive battle on the Eastern Front.
** The German Army launched a surprise attack against advancing Allied forces in the Ardennes (a region of extensive forests primarily in Belgium and Luxembourg) in December 1944. This battle created a large salient for several weeks, and is commonly known as the Battle of the Bulge (also known as the Ardennes Offensive and the Von Rundstedt Offensive).
* Turkish invasion of Cyprus
** Turkish forces reached as far south as the Turkish Cypriot village of Louroujina. The cease-fire line dividing Cyprus into Greek and Turkish-controlled sectors put Louroujina in a salient — accessible from the rest of Turkish Cypriot-controlled Cyprus by a single road.
* Bangladesh Liberation War
** The Battle of Boyra was fought by the Indian Army and the Mukti Bahini against the Pakistan Army, over the Boyra salient, overlooking an important supply route, the Jessore Road.

===Pocket===

In mobile warfare, such as the German Blitzkrieg, salients were more likely to be made into pockets which became the focus of annihilation battles.

A pocket carries connotations that the encircled forces have not allowed themselves to be encircled intentionally, as they may when defending a fortified position, which is usually called a siege. This is a similar distinction to that made between a skirmish and pitched battle.

<text>Boris Yakovlevich Bukreev (Russian: Борис Яковлевич Букреев; 6 September 1859 – 2 October 1962) was a Russian and Soviet mathematician who worked in the areas of complex functions and differential equations. He studied Fuchsian functions of rank zero. He was interested in projective and non-Euclidean geometry. He worked on differential invariants and parameters in the theory of surfaces, and also wrote many papers on the history of mathematics.

==Biography==

Boris Bukreev was born in Lgov, Kursk Governorate of Russian Empire in the family of a schoolteacher. His grandfather was also a school teacher. His early education was at home and later he attended a classical Gymnasium at Kursk. In 1878, Bukreev entered St. Vladimir University that at the time was called the University of Saint Vladimir in Kyiv. The university was founded in 1834 and had a very strong school of mathematics. In 1880, Bukreev was awarded a gold medal by the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics as the best student. In 1882, he got his first degree and remained at the university to continue his training. At that time he worked on Karl Weierstrass&#x27;s theory of elliptic functions. This became a topic of his Master&#x27;s thesis titled &quot;On the expansion of transcendental function in partial fractions. After publishing his thesis Bukreev went abroad and took lectures of Karl Weierstrass, Lazarus Fuchs, and Leopold Kronecker in Berlin. Bukreev undertook research on Fuchsian functions under Fuchs&#x27; guidance, which he completed in 1888 and which became the basis of his doctoral thesis &quot;On the Fuchsian functions of rank zero&quot; defended in 1889.

In 1889, Bukreev became a professor of mathematics at the St. Vladimir University of Kyiv, Russian Empire (now Kyiv, Ukraine). During the 1890s, Bukreev published a series of high quality papers including: &quot;On the theory of gamma functions,&quot; &quot;On some formulas in the theory of elliptic functions of Weierstrass,&quot; &quot;On the distribution of the roots of a class of entire transcendental functions,&quot; and &quot;Theorems for elliptic functions of Weierstrass&quot;. By the end of the 1890s, Bukreev began to undertake research into differential geometry. In 1900, he published &quot;A Course on Applications of Differential and Integral Calculus to Geometry&quot;. Although at this time his main position was in the University of Kyiv, he also taught at the Women&#x27;s College from 1896 and at the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute of Emperor Alexander II from 1898. He continued to teach at the Polytechnic Institute until 1926. He continued working at the University of Kiev until 1959 and retired at the age of 100. He received a number of scientific and state honors during his life, including the Order of Lenin and the Order of the Red Banner of Labour. 

Bukreev published a number of books which proved influential. For example, &quot;Introduction to the theory of series,&quot; &quot;Elements of the theory of determinants,&quot; &quot;Course on definite integrals&quot; (1903), and &quot;Elements of algebraic analysis&quot; (1912). In 1934, he published &quot;An Introduction to the Calculus of Variations.&quot; His most important book on non-Euclidean geometry was &quot;Non-Euclidean Planimetry in Analytic Terms&quot;, which he published in 1951. Bukreev continued actively working in mathematics up to the very end of his life; his last paper was published when he was 98.

<text>The Thomas Henry Pentland Molson Prize for the Arts is awarded by the Canada Council for the Arts. Two prizes are awarded annually to distinguished individuals. One prize is awarded in the arts, one in the social sciences and humanities. The prizes are $50,000 each, and intended to encourage continuing contribution to the cultural and intellectual heritage of Canada.

==Endowment==
Funded by an endowment from the Molson Foundation, the prizes are administered by the Canada Council for the Arts in cooperation with the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. Laureates are chosen by a peer assessment committee appointed jointly by the Canada Council and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.

==Eligibility==
Candidates must be Canadian citizens or permanent residents of Canada. To be nominated, candidates must have made a substantial and distinguished contribution over a significant period of time. In the words of the deed of gift, the prizes are intended &quot;to encourage Canadians of outstanding achievement in the fields of the Arts, the Humanities or the Social Sciences to make further contribution to the cultural or intellectual heritage of Canada&quot;. The terms of reference are interpreted as follows:
*outstanding achievement must have already been amply demonstrated
*further contribution implies that the laureates should still be very active and productive. 

In other words, the prize is not intended as an &quot;end of service&quot; reward or as recognition for one great accomplishment. Past assessment committees have been quite consistent in choosing laureates who are close to the top of an outstanding career. Corporations and other organizations are excluded from consideration, as are posthumous awards. No individual may be awarded the prize more than once. The prizes are accessible to qualified persons from Aboriginal Peoples and diverse cultural and regional communities. Members of the board of the Canada Council for the Arts and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council are not eligible to be considered for this prize during the course of their terms as members nor for six months following the end of their term.

==Nomination process==
Candidates may not apply for the Canada Council for the Arts Molson Prizes on their own behalf. They must be nominated by three individuals or three organizations, or a combination of individuals and organizations. Nominations are sought from persons and organizations that have the interest and capacity to nominate appropriate individuals. Nominators may submit one letter signed by the three nominating individuals or organizations, or submit three separate letters of nomination. Nominators are responsible for gathering and providing relevant documentation to the Canada Council.

==Selection procedure==
The two laureates are chosen by a single, multidisciplinary peer assessment committee co-chaired by the Chairman of the Canada Council for the Arts and the President of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. Members are chosen to ensure fair representation of gender, the two official languages, the various regions and cultures of Canada, and the various types of artistic and scholarly disciplines. Committee members are among the most accomplished individuals in their respective fields and, ideally, have interests that extend beyond the confines of a single discipline.

<doc id="487119" wikidata="Q4862389" url="?curid=487119" title="Baron Gerard">
<text>There have been three baronies created for the Gerard family who lived historically at Bryn, Ashton-in-Makerfield, Lancashire and Kingsley, Cheshire, in the 13th century. The third and current barony was created in 1876.

==History==

The earliest traceable member of the family that gave rise to the Barons Gerard was a William Fitz Gerard, who lived during the reign of Henry III of England and obtained his lands in Kingsley, Cheshire, by marriage Emma, daughter of Richard de Kingsley. Traditional genealogical sources have shifted this man back in time and given the family a shared origin with the Hiberno-Norman FitzGeralds, Dukes of Leinster in the Peerage of Ireland, and they adopted the same arms as that famous family, &quot;argent, a saltire gules&quot;, before the 17th century in place of an earlier coat bearing a lion. They were noted as having exasperated heralds by long ignoring their entreaties to be allowed to record the family&#x27;s pedigree, arms, and early land documents.

==First creation (1603–1733)==

The title Baron Gerard, of Gerard&#x27;s Bromley, was created in the Peerage of England on 21 July 1603 for Sir Thomas Gerard (d. 1617), son of Sir Gilbert Gerard (d. 1593) Attorney General between 1559 and 1581 and Master of the Rolls in 1581, who acquired estates at Gerards Bromley and Hilderstone, Staffordshire. The first Baron was Lord President of Wales between 1616 and 1617. The barony passed in direct line of succession until the death of the fifth Baron in 1684 when it passed to his second cousin Charles, a great-grandson of the 1st Baron Gerard, and upon his death without a male heir, to his brother Philip Gerard, a Jesuit priest who died childless in 1733 when the barony became extinct.

==Second creation (1645–1702)==
A second peerage was awarded the family in 1645, when Charles Gerard, whose grandfather was the brother of the 1st Baron Gerard of Gerard&#x27;s Bromley, was summoned to Parliament as Baron Gerard, of Brandon, Suffolk. The 1st Baron was subsequently made Earl of Macclesfield in 1679, and the two titles passed together to his son and grandson, Fitton Gerard, 3rd Earl of Macclesfield and 3rd Baron Gerard, on whose death in 1702 the 1645 Gerard barony became extinct.

==Third creation (1876–present)==
The title of Baron Gerard of Bryn in the County Palatine of Lancaster, was created in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1876 for Sir Robert Gerard, 13th Baronet Gerard of Bryn.

The title followed the line of the first Baron&#x27;s eldest son until the death of the latter&#x27;s grandson, the fourth Baron, in 1992. He was succeeded by his second cousin once removed, the fifth and present holder of the barony. He is the great-grandson of Captain the Hon. Robert Joseph Gerard-Dicconson, second son of the 1st Baron. The family seat was originally Bryn Hall, Ashton-in-Makerfield, but later Garswood Hall, followed by New Hall, a majestic, modernist, building of considerable size.

The current baron, Anthony Gerard, 5th Baron Gerard, was educated at Harvard University and lives in New York.

<text>Ekrem Spahiu (born 18 April 1960) was a Member of the Albanian Parliament in XVIth legislature (from 2001). Eqerem Spahia was arrested for &quot;organising armed uprising, participating in it and violating institutions&quot; after an armed protest near the parliament building that aimed to topple the Nano government and bring to power Crown Prince Leka, son of Zog of Albania, in September 1998.
Ekrem Spahiu made the most disputed case of homophobia and hate speech in Albania as he stated in 2012 to a local newspaper: “What remains to be done is to beat them up with a stick. If you don&#x27;t understand this, I can explain it: to beat them with a rubber stick”. The EU Delegation in Tirana, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and ILGA Europe, the local and international media covered and condemned this statement, even Prime Minister Sali Berisha condemned it publicly, but the Commissioner failed to follow up the case.

<doc id="487132" wikidata="Q485396" url="?curid=487132" title="Analytics">
<text>Analytics is the systematic computational analysis of data or statistics. It is used for the discovery, interpretation, and communication of meaningful patterns in data, which also falls under and directly relates to the umbrella term, data science. Analytics also entails applying data patterns toward effective decision-making. It can be valuable in areas rich with recorded information; analytics relies on the simultaneous application of statistics, computer programming, and operations research to quantify performance.

Organizations may apply analytics to business data to describe, predict, and improve business performance. Specifically, areas within analytics include descriptive analytics, diagnostic analytics, predictive analytics, prescriptive analytics, and cognitive analytics. Analytics may apply to a variety of fields such as marketing, management, finance, online systems, information security, and software services. Since analytics can require extensive computation (see big data), the algorithms and software used for analytics harness the most current methods in computer science, statistics, and mathematics. According to International Data Corporation, global spending on big data and business analytics (BDA) solutions is estimated to reach $215.7 billion in 2021. As per Gartner, the overall analytic platforms software market grew by $25.5 billion in 2020. 

== Analytics vs analysis ==
Data analysis focuses on the process of examining past data through business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling and evaluation, and deployment. It is a subset of data analytics, which takes multiple data analysis processes to focus on why an event happened and what may happen in the future based on the previous data. Data analytics is used to formulate larger organizational decisions. 

Data analytics is a multidisciplinary field. There is extensive use of computer skills, mathematics, statistics, the use of descriptive techniques and predictive models to gain valuable knowledge from data through analytics. There is increasing use of the term &quot;advanced analytics&quot;, typically used to describe the technical aspects of analytics, especially in the emerging fields such as the use of machine learning techniques like neural networks, decision trees, logistic regression, linear to multiple regression analysis, and classification to do predictive modeling. It also includes unsupervised machine learning techniques like cluster analysis, principal component analysis, segmentation profile analysis and association analysis.

== Applications ==
=== Marketing optimization ===
Marketing organizations use analytics to determine the outcomes of campaigns or efforts, and to guide decisions for investment and consumer targeting. Demographic studies, customer segmentation, conjoint analysis and other techniques allow marketers to use large amounts of consumer purchase, survey and panel data to understand and communicate marketing strategy.

Marketing analytics consists of both qualitative and quantitative, structured and unstructured data used to drive strategic decisions about brand and revenue outcomes. The process involves predictive modelling, marketing experimentation, automation and real-time sales communications. The data enables companies to make predictions and alter strategic execution to maximize performance results.

Web analytics allows marketers to collect session-level information about interactions on a website using an operation called sessionization. Google Analytics is an example of a popular free analytics tool that marketers use for this purpose. Those interactions provide web analytics information systems with the information necessary to track the referrer, search keywords, identify the IP address, and track the activities of the visitor. With this information, a marketer can improve marketing campaigns, website creative content, and information architecture.

Analysis techniques frequently used in marketing include marketing mix modeling, pricing and promotion analyses, sales force optimization and customer analytics, e.g., segmentation. Web analytics and optimization of websites and online campaigns now frequently work hand in hand with the more traditional marketing analysis techniques. A focus on digital media has slightly changed the vocabulary so that &quot;marketing mix modeling&quot; is commonly referred to as &quot;attribution modeling&quot; in the digital or marketing mix modeling context.

These tools and techniques support both strategic marketing decisions (such as how much overall to spend on marketing, how to allocate budgets across a portfolio of brands and the marketing mix) and more tactical campaign support, in terms of targeting the best potential customer with the optimal message in the most cost-effective medium at the ideal time.

=== People analytics ===
People analytics uses behavioral data to understand how people work and change how companies are managed. It can be referred to by various names, depending on the context, the purpose of the analytics, or the specific focus of the analysis. Some examples include workforce analytics, HR analytics, talent analytics, people insights, talent insights, colleague insights, human capital analytics, and human resources information system (HRIS) analytics. HR analytics is the application of analytics to help companies manage human resources. 

HR analytics has become a strategic tool in analyzing and forecasting human-related trends in the changing labor markets, using career analytics tools. The aim is to discern which employees to hire, which to reward or promote, what responsibilities to assign, and similar human resource problems. For example, inspection of the strategic phenomenon of employee turnover utilizing people analytics tools may serve as an important analysis at times of disruption. 

It has been suggested that people analytics is a separate discipline to HR analytics, with a greater focus on addressing business issues, while HR Analytics is more concerned with metrics related to HR processes. Additionally, people analytics may now extend beyond the human resources function in organizations. However, experts find that many HR departments are burdened by operational tasks and need to prioritize people analytics and automation to become a more strategic and capable business function in the evolving world of work, rather than producing basic reports that offer limited long-term value. Some experts argue that a change in the way HR departments operate is essential. Although HR functions were traditionally centered on administrative tasks, they are now evolving with a new generation of data-driven HR professionals who serve as strategic business partners.

Examples of HR analytic metrics include employee lifetime value (ELTV), labour cost expense percent, union percentage, etc.

=== Portfolio analytics ===
A common application of business analytics is portfolio analysis. In this, a bank or lending agency has a collection of accounts of varying value and risk. The accounts may differ by the social status (wealthy, middle-class, poor, etc.) of the holder, the geographical location, its net value, and many other factors. The lender must balance the return on the loan with the risk of default for each loan. The question is then how to evaluate the portfolio as a whole.

The least risk loan may be to the very wealthy, but there are a very limited number of wealthy people. On the other hand, there are many poor that can be lent to, but at greater risk. Some balance must be struck that maximizes return and minimizes risk. The analytics solution may combine time series analysis with many other issues in order to make decisions on when to lend money to these different borrower segments, or decisions on the interest rate charged to members of a portfolio segment to cover any losses among members in that segment.

=== Risk analytics ===
Predictive models in the banking industry are developed to bring certainty across the risk scores for individual customers. Credit scores are built to predict an individual&#x27;s delinquency behavior and are widely used to evaluate the credit worthiness of each applicant. Furthermore, risk analyses are carried out in the scientific world and the insurance industry. It is also extensively used in financial institutions like online payment gateway companies to analyse if a transaction was genuine or fraud. For this purpose, they use the transaction history of the customer. This is more commonly used in Credit Card purchases, when there is a sudden spike in the customer transaction volume the customer gets a call of confirmation if the transaction was initiated by him/her. This helps in reducing loss due to such circumstances.

=== Digital analytics ===
Digital analytics is a set of business and technical activities that define, create, collect, verify or transform digital data into reporting, research, analyses, recommendations, optimizations, predictions, and automation. This also includes the SEO (search engine optimization) where the keyword search is tracked and that data is used for marketing purposes. Even banner ads and clicks come under digital analytics. A growing number of brands and marketing firms rely on digital analytics for their digital marketing assignments, where marketing return on investment (MROI) is an important key performance indicator (KPI).

=== Security analytics ===
Security analytics refers to information technology (IT) to gather security events to understand and analyze events that pose the greatest security risks. Products in this area include security information and event management and user behavior analytics.

=== Software analytics ===

Software analytics is the process of collecting information about the way a piece of software is used and produced.

== Challenges ==
In the industry of commercial analytics software, an emphasis has emerged on solving the challenges of analyzing massive, complex data sets, often when such data is in a constant state of change. Such data sets are commonly referred to as big data. Whereas once the problems posed by big data were only found in the scientific community, today big data is a problem for many businesses that operate transactional systems online and, as a result, amass large volumes of data quickly.

The analysis of unstructured data types is another challenge getting attention in the industry. Unstructured data differs from structured data in that its format varies widely and cannot be stored in traditional relational databases without significant effort at data transformation. Sources of unstructured data, such as email, the contents of word processor documents, PDFs, geospatial data, etc., are rapidly becoming a relevant source of business intelligence for businesses, governments and universities. For example, in Britain the discovery that one company was illegally selling fraudulent doctor&#x27;s notes in order to assist people in defrauding employers and insurance companies is an opportunity for insurance firms to increase the vigilance of their unstructured data analysis.

These challenges are the current inspiration for much of the innovation in modern analytics information systems, giving birth to relatively new machine analysis concepts such as complex event processing, full text search and analysis, and even new ideas in presentation. One such innovation is the introduction of grid-like architecture in machine analysis, allowing increases in the speed of massively parallel processing by distributing the workload to many computers all with equal access to the complete data set.

Analytics is increasingly used in education, particularly at the district and government office levels. However, the complexity of student performance measures presents challenges when educators try to understand and use analytics to discern patterns in student performance, predict graduation likelihood, improve chances of student success, etc. For example, in a study involving districts known for strong data use, 48% of teachers had difficulty posing questions prompted by data, 36% did not comprehend given data, and 52% incorrectly interpreted data. To combat this, some analytics tools for educators adhere to an over-the-counter data format (embedding labels, supplemental documentation, and a help system, and making key package/display and content decisions) to improve educators&#x27; understanding and use of the analytics being displayed.

=== Risks ===
Risks for the general population include discrimination on the basis of characteristics such as gender, skin colour, ethnic origin or political opinions, through mechanisms such as price discrimination or statistical discrimination.

<text>Hegemony or Survival: America&#x27;s Quest for Global Dominance is a book about the United States and its foreign policy written by American political activist and linguist Noam Chomsky. It was first published in the United States in November 2003 by Metropolitan Books and then in the United Kingdom by Penguin Books. It was republished by Haymarket Books in January 2024.

Chomsky&#x27;s main argument in &quot;Hegemony or Survival&quot; is that the socio-economic elite who control the United States have pursued an &quot;Imperial Grand Strategy&quot; since the end of World War II to maintain global hegemony through military, political, and economic means. He argues that in doing so they have repeatedly shown a total disregard for democracy and human rights, in stark contrast to the US government&#x27;s professed support for those values. He further argues that this continual pursuit of global hegemony threatens the existence of humanity itself because of the increasing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

Drawing historical examples from 1945 through to 2003, Chomsky looks at the US government&#x27;s support for regimes responsible for mass human rights abuses—including ethnic cleansing and genocide—namely El Salvador, Colombia, Turkey, Israel, Egypt, South Africa, and Indonesia. He also discusses US support for militant dissident groups widely considered &quot;terrorists&quot;, particularly in Nicaragua and Cuba, as well as direct military interventions, such as the Vietnam War, NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, Afghan War and Iraq War, to further its power and grasp of resources. He argues that US foreign policy—whether controlled by Republican or Democratic administrations—pursues the same agenda of gaining access to lucrative resources and maintaining US world dominance.

Mainstream press reviews in the US were mixed and were largely negative in the UK, although a review in Asia was more positive. In a speech before the UN General Assembly in September 2006, Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez openly praised the work. Sales of the book surged after the recommendation, its rank on Amazon.com rising to No. 1 in paperback and No. 6 in hardcover in only a few days.

==Background==

Noam Chomsky (born 1928) was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. Becoming academically involved in the field of linguistics, Chomsky gained a PhD and secured a teaching job at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In the field of linguistics, he is credited as the creator or co-creator of the Chomsky hierarchy and the universal grammar theory, achieving international recognition for his work.

Politically, Chomsky had held radical leftist views since childhood, identifying himself with anarcho-syndicalism and libertarian socialism. A staunch critic of U.S. foreign policy, he arose to public attention for these views in 1967, when &quot;The New York Times&quot; published his article, &quot;The Responsibility of Intellectuals&quot;, a criticism of the Vietnam War.
His media criticism has included &quot;Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media&quot; (1988), co-written with Edward S. Herman, an analysis articulating the propaganda model theory for examining the media.

Chomsky is the author of over 100 books, and has been described as a prominent cultural figure. According to the Arts and Humanities Citation Index in 1992, Chomsky was cited as a source more often than any other living scholar from 1980 to 1992, and was the eighth most cited source overall.

The book was published as the first in The American Empire Series, edited for Metropolitan Books by Steve Fraser and Tom Engelhardt. The series had been devised as a vehicle for works of anti-imperialism that were critical of U.S. foreign policy. Engelhardt informed an interviewer that the series reflected their &quot;counterinterventionary impulse&quot; and represented an attempt to reclaim &quot;the word&quot; from the political right in the United States. They agreed to publish with Metropolitan because it was co-run by Engelhardt and Sara Bershtel. In conjunction with the publication of the book, Chomsky answered a series of public questions on the website of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

==Synopsis==
Chomsky&#x27;s first chapter, &quot;Priorities and Prospects&quot;, provides an introduction to U.S. global dominance at the start of 2003. He looks at the role of propaganda – employed by government and mass media – in shaping public opinion in both the U.S. and United Kingdom, arguing that it allows a wealthy elite to thrive at the expense of the majority. As evidence for the manner in which the media shapes public opinion on foreign policy, he discusses the role of the U.S. government in protecting its economic interests in Nicaragua, first by supporting the military junta of General Somoza and then by supporting the Contra militias, in both instances leading to mass human rights abuses which were ignored by the mainstream U.S. media.

Chapter two, &quot;Imperial Grand Strategy&quot;, looks at the U.S. government&#x27;s belief that it should take part in &quot;preventative war&quot; against states who threaten its global hegemony, despite the illegality of these actions under international law. Chomsky argues that the targets of U.S. preventative war must be weak, yet important and easy to depict as a threat to the U.S. populace. Using the 2003 invasion of Iraq as an example, he discusses how the U.S. government and media portrayed the Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein as a threat to the U.S. and other Middle Eastern states, something which Chomsky argues it was not.

Chapter three, &quot;The New Era of Enlightenment&quot;, explores further examples of U.S. interventionism in world affairs. Criticising the standard U.S. government claim that such interventionism is for humanitarian purposes, Chomsky maintains that it is an attempt to further the power of U.S. capitalism, with little interest in the welfare of the people involved. Using the 1999 NATO intervention in Kosovo as an example, he argues that western forces intervened not to protect Albanian Kosovans from Serbian aggression (as they claimed), but to humiliate and weaken Serbian President Slobodan Milošević, who had remained resistant to western demands for years. He asserts that western criticism of foreign human rights abuses is politically motivated, highlighting that while the U.S. were intervening in Kosovo, they were simultaneously supporting the governments of Turkey, Colombia and Indonesia, all of whom were involved in widespread human rights abuses and ethnic cleansing (see Kurdish–Turkish conflict (1978–present), Plan Colombia, 1999 East Timorese crisis, respectively).

In the fourth chapter, &quot;Dangerous Times&quot;, Chomsky focuses primarily on U.S. interventionism throughout Latin America, which the government has defended through its Monroe Doctrine. He discusses the U.S. campaign to topple the socialist government of Fidel Castro in Cuba, highlighting both its economic embargo of the island and its financial backing for militant groups that attack Cuban targets, including the perpetrators of the Bay of Pigs invasion and the bombing of Cubana Flight 455. He furthermore discusses the U.S. government&#x27;s role in training Latin American right wing paramilitary squads, who have perpetrated widespread human rights abuses across the region.

Chapter five, &quot;The Iraq Connection&quot;, looks at the background to the 2003 Iraq War, beginning with an analysis of the activities of the Reagan administration in the 1980s, who focused their military efforts in Central America and the Middle East. Chomsky argues that Reagan&#x27;s administration utilized fear and nationalist rhetoric to distract the public from the poor economic situation that the U.S. was facing, finding scapegoats in the form of the leftist governments of Libya, Grenada and Nicaragua, as well as the international drug trade. He examines the long relationship that the U.S. had with the Hussein&#x27;s Iraqi government, noting that they actively supported Hussein throughout the Iran–Iraq War, Al-Anfal Campaign and the Halabja poison gas attack, only turning against their former ally after his Invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Proceeding to critique the idea that the Bush II administration was genuinely concerned about threats to U.S. security, he criticises their attempts to undermine international efforts to prevent the militarization of space, the abolition of biological warfare, and the fight against global pollution, as well as the fact that they ignored all warnings that the Iraq invasion would cause a worldwide anti-American backlash. Exploring the dismissive attitude that the U.S. took towards European governments who opposed the war, namely France and Germany, he critiques the idea that the U.S. wanted to install a democratic government in Iraq, arguing that they wanted to install a puppet regime that would be obedient to U.S. corporate interests.

In the sixth chapter, &quot;Dilemmas of Dominance&quot;, Chomsky explores the relationship that the U.S. has had with Eastern Europe since the collapse of the Soviet Union and with East Asia since the Second World War. In the former, Chomsky argues, the U.S. has allied itself with the capitalist reformers who have advocated privatization and neoliberalism at the expense of the welfare state, leading to increased poverty and demographic decline across the region. In the latter, he has explored the role that the U.S. has played – through the likes of the San Francisco Peace Treaty of 1951 – in supporting capitalist development, but trying to ensure its own economic hegemony at the same time.

Chapter seven, &quot;Cauldron of Animosities&quot;, opens with a discussion of U.S. support for the increasing militarization of Israel and its illegal development of nuclear weapons, something Chomsky believes threatens peace in the Middle East by encouraging nations like Iran and Iraq to do the same. He explores the longstanding western exploitation of the Middle East for its oil resources, first by the British Empire and subsequently by the U.S. post-World War II, and then looks at the U.S.&#x27; role in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, continually supporting Israel both militarily and politically, furthering human right abuses against the Palestinian people and repeatedly sabotaging the peace process.

The eighth chapter, &quot;Terrorism and Justice: Some Useful Truisms&quot;, looks at what Chomsky calls &quot;a few simple truths&quot; regarding the criteria that is accepted for a conflict to be internationally recognized as a &quot;just war&quot;. He argues that these truisms are continually ignored when it comes to the actions of the U.S. and her allies. Exploring the concepts of &quot;terror&quot; and &quot;terrorism&quot;, he argues that the U.S. only use the term to refer to the actions of their enemies, and never to their own actions, no matter how similar they may be. As an example of such double standards, he highlights the public outcry at the killing of Leon Klinghoffer, a disabled American murdered by Palestinian militants in 1985, contrasting it with the complete U.S. ignorance of the Israeli military&#x27;s killing of a disabled Palestinian, Kemal Zughayer, in 2002. Focusing in on the Afghan War – widely described as a &quot;just war&quot; in the U.S. press – he criticizes such a description, arguing that the conflict was opposed by the majority of the world&#x27;s population, including the Afghan people.

In the final chapter, &quot;A Passing Nightmare&quot;, Chomsky turns his attention to weapons of mass destruction. He argues that rather than helping to eradicate nuclear, chemical and biological weaponry, the U.S. has continually increased its number of nuclear warheads, thereby encouraging other nations to do the same, putting the world in jeopardy of nuclear holocaust. Discussing the role of the U.S. in creating ballistic missile defense systems and encouraging the militarization of outer space, he notes that the U.S. government have continually undermined international treaties to decrease the number of weapons of mass destruction, because the American socio-economic elite believe that &quot;hegemony is more important than survival.&quot; However, he argues that there is still hope for humanity if the citizens of the world – the &quot;Second Superpower&quot; – continue to criticize and oppose the actions of the U.S. government.

==Main arguments==
===U.S. Imperial Grand Strategy===
Chomsky&#x27;s primary argument in &quot;Hegemony or Survival&quot; is that the United States government has pursued an &quot;Imperial Grand Strategy&quot; in order to maintain its status as the world&#x27;s foremost superpower since at least the end of the Second World War. Adopting the term &quot;Imperial Grand Strategy&quot; from international affairs specialist John Ikenberry of Princeton University, he quotes Ikenberry on the nature of this doctrine and the manner in which it considers the &quot;rule of force&quot; to be more important than the &quot;rule of law&quot;, thereby ignoring international law.
Quoting liberal statesman Dean Acheson, Chomsky asserts that the purpose of this strategy is to prevent any challenge to the &quot;power, position, and prestige of the United States&quot;.

Noting that economic decision making in the United States is highly centralized among a select socio-economic elite who control big business, he argues that this elite play a dominant role in this Imperial Grand Strategy because they consistently maintain a strong influence over successive U.S. governments. As a result, he argues that U.S. foreign policy has focused on gaining and maintaining unrestricted access to markets, energy supplies, and strategic resources across the world. Chomsky goes on to categorize the specific purposes of the doctrine as:

:containing other centers of global power within the &quot;overall framework of order&quot; managed by the United States; maintaining control of the world&#x27;s energy supplies; barring unacceptable forms of independent nationalism; and overcoming &quot;crisis of democracy&quot; within domestic enemy territory.

Chomsky argues that as a part of this strategy, the U.S. has regularly engaged in &quot;preventative war&quot;, which he highlights is illegal under international law and could be categorised as a war crime. Preventative war refers to conflict waged to prevent a nation ever reaching the stage where it could become a potential threat, and according to Chomsky, under the regimes of Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and his son George W. Bush it has actively involved attacking &quot;an imagined or invented threat&quot; such as Grenada and Iraq. He differentiates this &quot;preventative war&quot; from &quot;preemptive war&quot;, which he argues can be justifiable under international law in cases of self-defence.
Examining examples of preventative war waged by the United States, he notes that all of the nations that have been attacked have shared the same three characteristics: 1) they are &quot;virtually defenseless&quot;, 2) they are &quot;important enough to be worth the trouble&quot; and 3) there has been a way to portray them as &quot;the ultimate evil and an imminent threat to our survival.&quot;

===The Bush administration and the invasion of Iraq===
Chomsky argues that the Republican neoconservative administration of President George W. Bush, elected to the presidency in 2001, differed from earlier administrations in one key respect: it was open about adhering to the Imperial Grand Strategy, outright declaring that it would be willing to use force to ensure U.S. global hegemony despite international condemnation. Chomsky sees this as being in contrast to previous administrations, who had never explicitly informed the public that they adhered to such a doctrine. Instead, earlier administrations had discussed their intentions within elite circles which were known only to specialists or readers of dissident literature. Thus, where once only the socio-economic elite and their left-wing critics knew of the Imperial Grand Strategy, now the entire American populace are potentially aware of it. He considers this a &quot;significant difference.&quot;

In Chomsky&#x27;s view, the invasion of Iraq by a U.S. and U.K. coalition must be seen in the wider context of the U.S. government&#x27;s Imperial Grand Strategy. He claims that the Iraq invasion fits the three criteria that he has highlighted for being classified as a U.S. target for preventative war. Considering the country &quot;virtually defenseless&quot; against the superior might of the western armed forces, he also notes that securing control of the country would be an important move for the U.S. socio-economic elite, gaining unlimited access to the country&#x27;s lucrative oil resources and asserting their own military might to intimidate other nations into compliance. He also argued that government and media propaganda also set out to forge an erroneous link between Iraq President Saddam Hussein and Al-Qaeda, playing on the American people&#x27;s horror of the 9/11 attacks. Furthermore, he stated that they also wrongly claimed that the Iraqi government was developing weapons of mass destruction to be used against the U.S. or its allies. Chomsky remarks that the 2003 invasion of Iraq is particularly significant because it signals the &quot;new norm&quot; in international relations, and that in future the U.S. might be willing to wage a preventative war against &quot;Iran, Syria, the Andean region, and a number of others.&quot;

==Reviews==
===Academic reviews===
Writing in the &quot;International Affairs&quot; journal, Michael T. Boyle of the Australian National University reviewed &quot;Hegemony or Survival&quot; alongside Immanuel Wallerstein&#x27;s &quot;The Decline of American Power: The U.S. in a Chaotic World&quot; (2003), considering both to be &quot;well-considered if imperfect arguments&quot; that the Bush administration&#x27;s foreign policy was in keeping with a long history of U.S. interference in global affairs. Praising its &quot;prescient&quot; appearance and its analysis of the historical evidence, Boyle did present some criticism of the book. In stressing the Bush administration&#x27;s continuity with earlier presidencies, Boyle argued that Chomsky had neglected to highlight the differences between the Bush administration and its predecessors, in particular its willingness to break relationships with long-standing allies. Furthermore, Boyle opined that Chomsky had failed to offer a &quot;compelling explanation&quot; for why the U.S. government was willing to declare war on Iraq in 2003, a conflict that was far costlier and riskier than the 1980s military adventures in Nicaragua and Grenada.

Journalism lecturer David Blackall of the University of Wollongong reviewed Chomsky&#x27;s book for the &quot;Asia Pacific Media Educator&quot;. He noted that it would polarize readers between those whose anti-imperialist beliefs would be reinforced and those who would denounce Chomsky&#x27;s ideas as conspiracy theories. He thought the book was important in reminding readers that the War on Terror was keeping the US public in fear and was ensuring an ongoing international market for weaponry. However, he thought that there were &quot;recurring attribution problems&quot; in Chomsky&#x27;s text, for instance by referring to the international press as if it were a homogeneous entity with a single point of view. Ultimately, he thought that the book had something to teach educators of journalism: that &quot;[w]hen there is a desire of the power elite to move on an issue, and the population is generally opposed, then the issue is removed from the political arena and from the news media priorities – distraction being a primary method.&quot;

Eliza Mathews of the University of Queensland published a review of the book in the &quot;Journal of Australian Studies&quot;. She considered it similar to other books criticizing Bush&#x27;s administration, such as those of Michael Moore, John Dean, and Bob Woodward, but thought it novel in acknowledging prior policy. She thought some of his research to be &quot;inadequate&quot; in supporting his arguments, relying too heavily on newspaper reports and not verifying secondary sources. In other instances, she thought it unsatisfactory that Chomsky used his own work as a reference. She thought that despite being aimed at a wide audience, the text was not &quot;light reading&quot;, and expressed dislike at Chomsky&#x27;s &quot;sarcastic tone&quot;.

===Press reviews===
Views in the U.S. press were mixed. In a review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Harvard scholar, and Pulitzer Prize winner Samantha Power described the book as a &quot;raging and often meandering assault&quot; on U.S. foreign policy. Believing that Chomsky divides the world into two camps, the oppressor and the oppressed, she asserts that in &quot;Hegemony or Survival&quot; he portrays the U.S. as &quot;the prime oppressor, [who] can do no right&quot;, meanwhile overlooking the crimes of the oppressed. Arguing that he completely ignores the concept that the U.S. might undertake any foreign interventions with good intentions, she asserts that his book is not easy to read, and that his &quot;glib and caustic tone&quot; are distracting. Furthermore, she highlights problems with his use of end notes, particularly when some of these notes simply reference his earlier publications. Although disagreeing with his arguments, she believed that reading his book was &quot;sobering and instructive&quot;, having value in illustrating how many non-Americans viewed the U.S. and highlighting many of the &quot;structural defects&quot; in U.S. foreign policy. Furthermore, recognizing that Chomsky&#x27;s &quot;critiques have come to influence and reflect mainstream opinion elsewhere in the world,&quot; she concedes that Chomksy&#x27;s analysis has a coherence that, for many, resolves much of the post-9/11 confusion and disillusionment stemming from the Bush administration&#x27;s standard response to the question, &quot;Why do they hate us?&quot;.
Carol Armbrust discussed Chomsky&#x27;s book critically in &quot;The Antioch Review&quot;, claiming that his writing style was &quot;a monumental turnoff&quot; and that only those who already agreed with Chomsky&#x27;s political views would read the book. Claiming that his opinions constituted &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;, she compared his arguments to adding &quot;two and two&quot; together and getting &quot;minus six&quot;. Conversely, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; considered it &quot;highly readable&quot; and thought it both &quot;cogent and provocative&quot;, representing a significant addition to the debate on U.S. foreign policy.

Views in the British press were largely negative. Writing in &quot;The Observer&quot;, journalist Nick Cohen wrote disparagingly of &quot;Hegemony or Survival&quot;, describing Chomsky as a &quot;master of looking-glass politics&quot;, exemplifying a trend in the western Left for being more interested in anti-Americanism than in opposing the &quot;fascist&quot; regime of Saddam Hussein. Focusing his critique primarily on Chomsky and his readership than the book itself, he refers to its &quot;convoluted prose&quot;, and remarks that its argument is &quot;dense and filled with non sequiturs&quot;. In a shorter review published in &quot;The Observer&quot;, Oliver Robinson described the work as an &quot;unequivocally incensed, if meandering&quot; study of U.S. foreign policy.

Piyush Mathur reviewed the work for &quot;Asia Times Online&quot;, a joint Thai-Hong Kongese publication. Praising the book, Mathur argued that by being a U.S. citizen who was willing to criticise his own government, Chomsky was showing &quot;a way beyond parochialism&quot; that avoided nationalistic or ethnocentric intentions. Highlighting Chomsky&#x27;s &quot;wry humor and sarcasm&quot;, he notes that the author &quot;successfully shows that the American emperor, while preaching modesty to the rest, himself struts about rather ostentatiously.&quot; Mathur also turned his attention to the most prominent press reviews of the book that appeared in the U.S. and U.K., those of Power and Cohen. He argues that the former&#x27;s review was &quot;hardly charitable&quot;, and that she had narrowly framed &quot;Hegemony or Survival&quot; as a critique purely of the Bush administration, something Mathur stated it clearly was not. Turning to Cohen&#x27;s &quot;venomous&quot; review, he highlights that it actually dealt very little with Chomsky&#x27;s book, instead offering a diatribe against the Left, one which consisted of a &quot;thoroughly convoluted vagueness&quot;. Ultimately, Mathur notes that the &quot;strangely defensive and rather parochial posture&quot; adopted by Power and Cohen was &quot;entirely in line&quot; with the reception that Chomsky had received from the Anglo-American world.

===Hugo Chávez&#x27;s endorsement===
In September 2006, Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez held up a Spanish-language copy of &quot;Hegemony or Survival&quot; during his speech at the United Nations. Chávez praised the work as an &quot;excellent book to help us understand what has been happening in the world throughout the 20th century&quot;. He urged everyone present to read it, including those in the U.S., remarking that &quot;I think that the first people who should read this book are our brothers and sisters in the United States, because their threat is right in their own house.&quot; A vocal anti-imperialist and prominent critic of U.S. foreign policy, particularly in his native Latin America, Chávez went on to describe U.S. President Bush as the &quot;devil&quot; in his speech.

In the U.S., demand for the book dramatically increased. Within a week, sales had risen tenfold; it reached number 1 on amazon.com&#x27;s best-seller list, and number 6 in the best-seller lists of the bookstore chains Borders and Barnes &amp; Noble. A prominent critic of Chomsky&#x27;s political views, Alan Dershowitz of Harvard Law School, told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that he believed most of those buying &quot;Hegemony or Survival&quot; would not read it, remarking that &quot;I don&#x27;t know anybody who&#x27;s ever read a Chomsky book&quot;. Furthermore, he related that the MIT professor &quot;does not write page turners, he writes page stoppers. There are a lot of bent pages in Noam Chomsky&#x27;s books, and they are usually at about Page 16.&quot;

In response to Chávez&#x27;s endorsement, Chomsky told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that he would be &quot;happy to meet&quot; the Venezuelan President, asserting that he was &quot;quite interested&quot; in what his administration had achieved and thought many of Chávez&#x27;s views to be &quot;quite constructive&quot;.
This meeting came about in August 2009, when Chomsky visited the Latin American country. In a press conference to commence the meeting, Chávez made reference to the intellectual&#x27;s work, remarking &quot;Hegemony or survival; we opt for survival&quot;, before comparing Chomsky&#x27;s thesis with the concept of &quot;Socialism or Barbarism&quot; advocated by German Marxist Rosa Luxemburg in the early 20th century. Speaking through an interpreter, Chomsky replied that &quot;I write about peace and criticize the barriers to peace; that&#x27;s easy. What&#x27;s harder is to create a better world ... and what&#x27;s so exciting about at last visiting Venezuela is that I can see how a better world is being created.&quot; He went on to Venezolana de Televisión, where he commented on the U.S. government&#x27;s role in orchestrating the 2009 Honduran coup d&#x27;état to overthrow leftist President Manuel Zelaya. He also expressed cautious support for the leftist reforms being implemented by Chávez&#x27;s administration, remarking his opinion that their moves &quot;toward the creation of another socio-economic model could have a global impact if these projects are successfully carried out&quot;.

In summer 2011, Chomsky expressed criticism of Chávez&#x27;s government over the controversial imprisonment of judge María Lourdes Afiuni, who had been detained since December 2009. He asserted that he was &quot;convinced that she must be set free, not only due to her physical and psychological health conditions, but in conformance with the human dignity the Bolivarian revolution presents as a goal.&quot; In December 2011, Chomsky reiterated this position, sending a letter to Chávez asking him to include the judge in his &quot;Christmas-time pardons&quot;.
Afiuni was released on June 14, 2013.
