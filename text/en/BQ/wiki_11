<doc id="488965" wikidata="Q4646349" url="?curid=488965" title="99th United States Congress">
<text>The 99th United States Congress was a meeting of the legislative branch of the United States federal government, composed of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives. It met in Washington, D.C., from January 3, 1985, to January 3, 1987, during the fifth and sixth years of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s presidency. The apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives was based on the 1980 United States census.

The Republicans maintained control of the Senate, while the Democrats maintained control of the House of Representatives – albeit with both majorities slightly reduced from the 98th Congress.

This is the most recent Congress to feature a Republican senator from Maryland, Charles Mathias, who retired at the end of the Congress.

This is also the most recent Congress in which no Democratic women Senators served and the most recent Congress in which more Republican women Senators served than Democratic women Senators.

This was the most recent session of Congress prior to the 116th to feature a Republican Senate/Democratic House split and had a third-party House member.

<text>Church Slavonic is the conservative Slavic liturgical language used by the Eastern Orthodox Church in Belarus, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Ukraine, Russia, Serbia, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, Slovenia and Croatia. The language appears also in the services of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia, the American Carpatho-Russian Orthodox Diocese, and occasionally in the services of the Orthodox Church in America.

In addition, Church Slavonic is used by some churches which consider themselves Orthodox but are not in communion with the Orthodox Church, such as the Montenegrin Orthodox Church and the Russian True Orthodox Church. The Russian Old Believers and the Co-Believers also use Church Slavonic.

Church Slavonic is also used by Greek Catholic Churches in Slavic countries, for example the Croatian, Slovak and Ruthenian Greek Catholics, as well as by the Roman Catholic Church (Croatian and Czech recensions).

In the past, Church Slavonic was also used by the Orthodox Churches in the Romanian lands until the late 17th and early 18th centuries, as well as by Roman Catholic Croats in the Early Middle Ages.

==Historical development==
Church Slavonic represents a later stage of Old Church Slavonic, and is the continuation of the liturgical tradition introduced by two Thessalonian brothers, Saints Cyril and Methodius, in the late 9th century in Nitra, a principal town and religious and scholarly center of Great Moravia (located in present-day Slovakia). There the first Slavic translations of the Scripture and liturgy from Koine Greek were made.

After the Christianization of Bulgaria in 864, Saint Clement of Ohrid and Saint Naum of Preslav were of great importance to the Eastern Orthodox faith and the Old Church Slavonic liturgy in the First Bulgarian Empire. The success of the conversion of the Bulgarians facilitated the conversion of the East Slavs. A major event was the development of the Cyrillic script in Bulgaria at the Preslav Literary School in the 9th century. The Cyrillic script and the liturgy in Old Church Slavonic, also called Old Bulgarian, were declared official in Bulgaria in 893.

By the early 12th century, individual Slavic languages started to emerge, and the liturgical language was modified in pronunciation, grammar, vocabulary and orthography according to the local vernacular usage. These modified varieties or &quot;recensions&quot; (e.g. Serbian Church Slavonic, Russian Church Slavonic, Ukrainian Church Slavonic in Early Cyrillic script, Croatian Church Slavonic in Croatian angular Glagolitic and later in Latin script, Czech Church Slavonic, Slovak Church Slavonic in Latin script, Bulgarian Church Slavonic in Early Cyrillic and Bulgarian Glagolitic scripts, etc.) eventually stabilized and their regularized forms were used by the scribes to produce new translations of liturgical material from Koine Greek, or Latin in the case of Croatian Church Slavonic.

Attestation of Church Slavonic traditions appear in Early Cyrillic and Glagolitic script. Glagolitic has nowadays fallen out of use, though both scripts were used from the earliest attested period.

The first Church Slavonic printed book was the &quot;Missale Romanum Glagolitice&quot; (1483) in angular Glagolitic, followed shortly by five Cyrillic liturgical books printed in Kraków in 1491.

==Recensions==
The Church Slavonic language is actually a set of at least four different dialects (recensions or redactions; , izvod), with essential distinctions between them in dictionary, spelling (even in writing systems), phonetics, and other aspects. The most widespread recension, Russian, has several local sub-dialects in turn, with slightly different pronunciations.

These various Church Slavonic recensions were used as a liturgical and literary language in all Orthodox countries north of the Mediterranean region during the Middle Ages, even in places where the local population was not Slavic (especially in Romania). In recent centuries, however, Church Slavonic was fully replaced by local languages in the non-Slavic countries. Even in some of the Slavic Orthodox countries, the modern national language is now used for liturgical purposes to a greater or lesser extent.

The Russian Orthodox Church, which contains around half of all Orthodox believers, still holds its liturgies almost entirely in Church Slavonic. However, there exist parishes which use other languages (where the main problem has been a lack of good translations). Examples include:
* According to the decision of the All-Russian Church Council of 1917–1918, service in Russian or Ukrainian can be permitted in individual parishes when approved by church authorities.
* Parishes serving ethnic minorities in Russia use (entirely or in part) the languages of those populations: Chuvash, Mordvinic, Mari, Tatar (for Keräşens), Sakha (Yakut), etc.
* Autonomous parts of the Russian Orthodox Church prepare and partly use translations to the languages of the local population, as Ukrainian, Belarusian, Romanian (in Moldova), Japanese, and Chinese.
* Parishes in the diaspora, including ones of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia, often use local languages: English, French, Spanish, German, Dutch, Portuguese, etc.

What follows is a list of modern recensions or dialects of Church Slavonic. For a list and descriptions of extinct recensions, see the article on the Old Church Slavonic language.

===Russian (Synodal) recension===
The Russian recension of New Church Slavonic is the language of books since the second half of the 17th century. It generally uses traditional Cyrillic script (); however, certain texts (mostly prayers) are printed in modern alphabets with the spelling adapted to rules of local languages (for example, in Russian/Ukrainian/Bulgarian/Serbian Cyrillic or in Hungarian/Slovak/Polish Latin).

Before the eighteenth century, Church Slavonic was in wide use as a general literary language in Russia. Although it was never spoken &quot;per se&quot; outside church services, members of the priesthood, poets, and the educated tended to slip its expressions into their speech. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, it was gradually replaced by the Russian language in secular literature and was retained for use only in church. Although as late as the 1760s, Lomonosov argued that Church Slavonic was the so-called &quot;high style&quot; of Russian, during the nineteenth century within Russia, this point of view declined. Elements of Church Slavonic style may have survived longest in speech among the Old Believers after the late-seventeenth century schism in the Russian Orthodox Church.

Russian has borrowed many words from Church Slavonic. While both Russian and Church Slavonic are Slavic languages, some early Slavic sound combinations evolved differently in each branch. As a result, the borrowings into Russian are similar to native Russian words, but with South Slavic variances, e.g. (the first word in each pair is Russian, the second Church Slavonic): / ( / ), / ( / ), / ( / ), / ( / ). Since the Russian Romantic era and the corpus of work of the great Russian authors (from Gogol to Chekhov, Tolstoy, and Dostoevsky), the relationship between words in these pairs has become traditional. Where the abstract meaning has not commandeered the Church Slavonic word completely, the two words are often synonyms related to one another, much as Latin and native English words were related in the nineteenth century: one is archaic and characteristic of written high style, while the other is found in common speech.

====Standard (Russian) variant====
In Russia, Church Slavonic is pronounced in the same way as Russian, with some exceptions:
* Church Slavonic features &quot;okanye&quot; and &quot;yekanye&quot;, i.e., the absence of vowel reduction in unstressed syllables. That is, о and е in unstressed positions are always read as and ~ respectively (like in northern Russian dialects), whereas in standard Russian pronunciation they have different allophones when unstressed.
* There should be no de-voicing of final consonants, although in practice there often is.
* The letter е is never read as ё ~ (the letter ё does not exist in Church Slavonic writing at all). This is also reflected in borrowings from Church Slavonic into Russian: in the following pairs the first word is Church Slavonic in origin, and the second is purely Russian: небо / нёбо (&quot;nebo / nëbo&quot;), надежда / надёжный (&quot;nadežda / nadëžnyj&quot;).
* The letter Γ can traditionally be read as voiced fricative velar sound (just as in Southern Russian dialects); however, occlusive (as in standard Russian pronunciation) is also possible and has been considered acceptable since the beginning of the 20th century. When unvoiced, it becomes ; this has influenced the Russian pronunciation of Бог (&quot;Bog&quot;) as &quot;Boh&quot; [box].
*The adjective endings -аго/-его/-ого/-яго are pronounced as written (, , , ), whereas Russian -его/-ого are pronounced with instead of (and with the reduction of unstressed vowels).

===Old Moscow recension===

The Old Moscow recension is in use among Old Believers and Co-Believers. The same traditional Cyrillic alphabet as in Russian Synodal recension; however, there are differences in spelling because the Old Moscow recension reproduces an older state of orthography and grammar in general (before the 1650s). The most easily observable peculiarities of books in this recension are:
* using of digraph not only in the initial position,
* hyphenation with no hyphenation sign.

===Ukrainian and Rusyn recension===

A main difference between Russian and Ukrainian recension of Church Slavonic as well as the Russian &quot;Civil Script&quot; lies in the pronunciation of the letter yat (ѣ). The Russian pronunciation is the same as е ~ whereas the Ukrainian is the same as и . Greek Catholic variants of Church Slavonic books printed in variants of the Latin alphabet (a method used in Austro-Hungary and Czechoslovakia) just contain the letter &quot;i&quot; for yat. Other distinctions reflect differences between palatalization rules of Ukrainian and Russian (for example, is always &quot;soft&quot; (palatalized) in Russian pronunciation and &quot;hard&quot; in the Ukrainian one), different pronunciation of letters and , etc.
Another major difference is the use of Ґ in the Rusyn variant. Г is pronounced as h and Ґ is pronounced as G. For example, Blagosloveno is Blahosloveno in Rusyn variants.

Typographically, Serbian and Ukrainian editions (when printed in traditional Cyrillic) are almost identical to the Russian ones. Certain visible distinctions may include:
* less frequent use of abbreviations in &quot;nomina sacra&quot;;
* treating digraph as a single character rather than two letters (for example, in letter-spacing or in combination with diacritical marks: in Russian editions, they are placed above , not between and ; also, when the first letter of a word is printed in different color, it is applied to in Russian editions and to the entire in Serbian and Ukrainian).

=== Serbian recension ===
The variant differences are limited to the lack of certain sounds in Serbian phonetics (there are no sounds corresponding to letters ы and щ, and in certain cases the palatalization is impossible to observe, e.g. ть is pronounced as т etc.). The medieval Serbian recension of Church Slavonic was gradually replaced by the Russian recension beginning in the early 18th century. 

Nowadays in Serbia, Church Slavonic is generally pronounced according to the Russian model.

=== Croatian recension ===

This is in limited use among Croatian Catholics. Texts are printed in the Croatian Latin alphabet (with the addition of letter for yat) or in Glagolitic script. Sample editions include:
*&quot;Missale Romanum Glagolitice&quot;
* Ioseph Vais, &quot;Abecedarivm Palaeoslovenicvm in usvm glagolitarvm&quot;. Veglae, [Krk], 1917 (2nd ed.). XXXVI+76 p. (collection of liturgical texts in Glagolitic script, with a brief Church Slavonic grammar written in Latin language and Slavonic-Latin dictionary)
*&quot;Rimski misal slavĕnskim jezikom: Čin misi s izbranimi misami...,&quot; Zagreb: Kršćanska sadašnjost, 1980 (The ISBN specified even at the publisher 978-953-151-721-5 is bad, causing a checksum error) (in Croatian Latin script)

===Czech recension===
Church Slavonic is in very limited use among Czech Catholics. The recension was developed by Vojtěch Tkadlčík in his editions of the Roman missal:
* &quot;Rimskyj misal slověnskym jazykem izvoljenijem Apostolskym za Arcibiskupiju Olomuckuju iskusa dělja izdan&quot;. Olomouc 1972.
* &quot;Rimskyj misal povelěnijem svjataho vselenskaho senma Vatikanskaho druhaho obnovljen...&quot; Olomouc 1992.

==Grammar and style==
Although the various recensions of Church Slavonic differ in some points, they share the tendency of approximating the original Old Church Slavonic to the local Slavic vernacular. Inflection tends to follow the ancient patterns with few simplifications. All original six verbal tenses, seven nominal cases, and three numbers are intact in most frequently used traditional texts (but in the newly composed texts, authors avoid most archaic constructions and prefer variants that are closer to modern Russian syntax and are better understood by the Slavic-speaking people).

In Russian recension, the fall of the yers is fully reflected, more or less to the Russian pattern, although the terminal ъ continues to be written. The yuses are often replaced or altered in usage to the sixteenth- or seventeenth-century Russian pattern. The yat continues to be applied with greater attention to the ancient etymology than it was in nineteenth-century Russian. The letters ksi, psi, omega, ot, and izhitsa are kept, as are the letter-based denotation of numerical values, the use of stress accents, and the abbreviations or &quot;titla&quot; for &quot;nomina sacra&quot;.

The vocabulary and syntax, whether in scripture, liturgy, or church missives, are generally somewhat modernised in an attempt to increase comprehension. In particular, some of the ancient pronouns have been eliminated from the scripture (such as етеръ &quot;a certain (person, etc.)&quot; → нѣкій in the Russian recension). Many, but not all, occurrences of the imperfect tense have been replaced with the perfect.

Miscellaneous other modernisations of classical formulae have taken place from time to time. For example, the opening of the Gospel of John, by tradition the first words written down by Saints Cyril and Methodius, (искони бѣаше слово) &quot;In the beginning was the Word&quot;, were set as &quot;искони бѣ слово&quot; in the Ostrog Bible of Ivan Fedorov (1580/1581) and as въ началѣ бѣ слово in the Elizabethan Bible of 1751, still in use in the Russian Orthodox Church.

<text>George Robert Gray (8 July 1808 – 6 May 1872) was an English zoologist and author, and head of the ornithological section of the British Museum, now the Natural History Museum, London for forty-one years. He was the younger brother of the zoologist John Edward Gray and the son of the botanist Samuel Frederick Gray.

George Gray&#x27;s most important publication was his &quot;Genera of Birds&quot; (1844–49), illustrated by David William Mitchell and Joseph Wolf, which included 46,000 references.

==Biography==
He was born in Little Chelsea, London, to Samuel Frederick Gray, naturalist and pharmacologist, and Elizabeth (née Forfeit), his wife. He was educated at Merchant Taylor&#x27;s School.

Gray started at the British Museum as Assistant Keeper of the Zoology Branch in 1831.

He began by cataloguing insects, and published an &quot;Entomology of Australia&quot; (1833) and contributed the entomogical section to an English edition of Georges Cuvier&#x27;s &quot;Animal Kingdom&quot;. Gray described many species of Lepidoptera. In 1833, he was a founder of what became the Royal Entomological Society of London.

Gray&#x27;s original description of Gray&#x27;s grasshopper warbler, which was named for him, appeared in 1860. The specimen had been collected by Alfred Russel Wallace in the Moluccas. In a brief biography dealing with Gray&#x27;s work on phasmids, Bragg credits Gray with more than doubling the number of named species of phasmids with three publications (in 1833, 1835 and 1843); three species of phasmids were subsequently named after Gray.

<text>HMS &quot;Irresistible&quot;—the fourth British Royal Navy ship of the name—was a pre-dreadnought battleship. The design of these ships were developments of earlier British battleships: they mounted more powerful 40-calibre guns and featured heavier armour protection, all while maintaining the preceding &#x27; top speed of .

&quot;Irresistible&quot; was laid down in April 1898, was launched in December that year, and was completed in October 1901. Commissioned in 1902, she initially served with the Mediterranean Fleet until April 1908, when she was transferred to the Channel Fleet. Now outclassed with the emergence of the dreadnought class of ships, she entered service with the Home Fleet in 1911 following a refit. In 1912, she was assigned to the 5th Battle Squadron.

Following the outbreak of the First World War, &quot;Irresistible&quot;, along with the squadron, was assigned to the Channel Fleet. After operations with the Dover Patrol, during which she bombarded German forces in northern France, she was assigned to the Dardanelles Campaign in February 1915. She took part in numerous unsuccessful attacks on the Ottoman forts guarding the Dardanelles in February and March. These operations included several raids by landing parties to destroy Ottoman coastal artillery batteries. On 18 March, she struck a naval mine that caused extensive flooding and disabled her engines. Without power, she began to drift into the range of Turkish guns, which laid down a withering fire. Attempts to tow her failed, so her surviving crew was evacuated and &quot;Irresistible&quot; was abandoned and eventually sank. Her crew suffered around 150 killed in the sinking.

==Design==

The design for the &quot;Formidable&quot; class was prepared in 1897; it was an incremental improvement over the preceding and es. &quot;Formidable&quot; adopted the larger size of the &quot;Majestic&quot;s, while taking the stronger Krupp armour of the &quot;Canopus&quot; design. In addition, the new design incorporated longer (and thus more powerful) main and secondary guns and an improved hull form. These characteristics produced a ship with better armour protection than either earlier class, and the same high speed of &quot;Canopus&quot;.

&quot;Irresistible&quot; was long overall, with a beam of and a draught of . She displaced normally and up to fully loaded. Her crew numbered 780 officers and ratings. The &quot;Formidable&quot;-class ships were powered by a pair of 3-cylinder triple-expansion engines, with steam provided by twenty Belleville boilers. The boilers were trunked into two funnels located amidships. The &quot;Formidable&quot;-class ships had a top speed of from .

&quot;Irresistible&quot; had a main battery of four 40-calibre guns mounted in twin-gun turrets fore and aft; these guns were mounted in circular barbettes that allowed all-around loading or elevation. The ships also mounted a secondary battery of twelve 45-calibre guns mounted in casemates, in addition to ten 12-pounder guns and six 3-pounder guns for defence against torpedo boats. As was customary for battleships of the period, she was also equipped with four torpedo tubes submerged in the hull.

&quot;Irresistible&quot; had an armoured belt that was thick; the transverse bulkheads on either end of the belt were thick. Her main battery turret sides were thick, atop barbettes, and the casemate battery was protected with 6 in of Krupp steel. Her conning tower had thick sides as well. She was fitted with two armoured decks, thick, respectively.

==Service history==
===Pre-First World War===
The keel for HMS &quot;Irresistible&quot; was laid down at Chatham Dockyard on 11 April 1898 and launched on 15 December 1898 in a very incomplete state to clear the building ways for the construction of the battleship . &quot;Irresistible&quot; was completed in October 1901. The ship was commissioned at Chatham Dockyard on 4 February 1902 by Captain George Morris Henderson and a complement of 870 officers and men for Mediterranean Fleet service. She left Portsmouth in late March 1902, arriving the following month at Gibraltar where she relieved the turret ship as a guard ship. In May 1902 she visited Augusta, Sicily, and in August 1902 she went to Piraeus. In late December 1902 she was back in Greek waters when she visited Astakos in the Ionian Sea with HMS &quot;Bulwark&quot; and HMS Pioneer.

She suffered two mishaps during her years in the Mediterranean, colliding with the Norwegian merchant steamer while steaming in fog on her way to her commissioning on 3 March 1902, sustaining considerable damage to the side of her hull, and running aground at Malta on 5 October 1905. She underwent a refit there after her grounding, and a second refit there between October 1907 and January 1908. In April 1908, &quot;Irresistible&quot; was transferred to the Channel Fleet, where she collided with a schooner while steaming in fog on 4 May 1908, suffering no damage. She was assigned to the Nore Division in 1909, and was reduced to a nucleus crew in May 1910. Her Channel Fleet service ended on 1 June 1910, when she paid off at Chatham Dockyard for a refit. Her refit completed, &quot;Irresistible&quot; commissioned at Chatham on 28 February 1911 to serve in the 3rd Division, Home Fleet, at the Nore. In 1912, she was assigned to the 5th Battle Squadron.

===First World War===
Britain entered the First World War in August 1914; the 5th Battle Squadron was based at Portland and assigned to patrol duties in the English Channel under the Channel Fleet. &quot;Irresistible&quot; covered the landing of the Plymouth Marine Battalion at Ostend, Belgium, on 25 August, and thereafter covered the occupation. In October–November 1914, &quot;Irresistible&quot; was temporarily attached to the Dover Patrol. Her duties included bombardment of German Army forces along the Belgian coast in support of Allied troops fighting on the front. On 3 November, she was detached to support East Coast Patrols during the German raid on Yarmouth, though she did not see action with German warships. &quot;Irresistible&quot; returned to the Channel Fleet later in November 1914. The 5th Battle Squadron was transferred to Sheerness on 14 November to guard against a possible German invasion. The squadron was transferred back to Portland on 30 December.

====Dardanelles campaign====


On 1 February 1915, &quot;Irresistible&quot; sailed from Sheerness in company with the battleship , bound for the eastern Mediterranean Sea. There, the British and French fleets, under the overall command of British Admiral Sackville Carden, were preparing to launch a major attack on the Dardanelles strait; the Entente commanders hoped to force the Dardanelles and enter the Sea of Marmara, where they could attack the capital of the Ottoman Empire, Constantinople, directly. She took part in the opening bombardment of the Ottoman forts guarding the entrance to the Çanakkale (Dardanelles) on 18–19 February as part of the 2nd Division, though she did not actively engage the Ottoman coastal defences during the attack.

Another attack took place on 25 February; &quot;Irresistible&quot; and the battleship being tasked with providing long-range covering fire while other battleships closed with the fortresses to engage them directly. During their operation, the battleship came under fire from the guns from Battery &quot;Orkaniye&quot;. Counter fire from &quot;Irresistible&quot; forced the Ottomans to cease firing, knocking out two guns in the process. By 15:00, the leading British and French battleships had silenced the Ottoman guns, allowing for minesweepers to advance and attempt to clear the minefields; most of the fleet withdrew while the minesweepers worked. By clearing these fields, Allied warships could now enter the Dardanelles themselves, opening the route to attack additional fortifications around the town of Dardanus. While other vessels shelled the forts there, &quot;Irresistible&quot; and the battleship sent men ashore to destroy an abandoned artillery battery near Kumkale, with both ships remaining off shore to support the raid. The 75-man team from &quot;Irresistible&quot; landed unopposed at Sedd el Bahr, but quickly came under attack from a superior Ottoman force and was compelled to retreat. 6-inch fire from &quot;Irresistible&quot; broke up the Ottoman attack, however, and the landing party was able to make their way to the fort, where they found four of the six heavy guns still operable. They destroyed the guns with gunpowder from the Ottoman magazine before proceeding to Fort Helles. The Ottoman defences were too strong there, and so the British party retreated after they destroyed a pair of 12-pounder guns outside the fort.

Two days later, &quot;Irresistible&quot; repeated the operation with another 78-man landing party under the command of Lieutenant F. H. Sandford, again at Sedd el Bahr. This time, the target was a battery of six 6-inch Krupp mortars. The men again came under attack from the Ottoman defenders, and again forced their way to their objective using heavy fire from &quot;Irresistible&quot;″s 6-inch guns to suppress the Ottomans. All six mortars were packed with gunpowder and destroyed, and the landing party returned to the ship without a single casualty. The following day, Admiral John de Robeck, the British fleet commander, transferred his flag from &quot;Vengeance&quot; to &quot;Irresistible&quot;, while the latter was in Mudros for repairs. De Robeck ordered another attack on 28 February, though bad weather hampered British progress; later in the day, a break in the weather led him to order &quot;Irresistible&quot;″s landing party, again under Sandford&#x27;s direction, to go ashore. In the course of the raid, the party destroyed eight heavy guns in a battery near Kumkale, six 12-pounder field guns, and four Nordenfelt guns on the way back to the ship. Again, the men returned without a single casualty.

On 3 March, another attack was launched against the fortresses, and &quot;Irresistible&quot; contributed a reconnaissance party that went ashore under cover of a heavy bombardment from the fleet&#x27;s battleships. During their exploration of the area around Erenköy, they discovered a battery of six 15-pounder field guns, which they destroyed. They proceeded to the main fort and found that it had been evacuated under the heavy bombardment. Again, they returned to the ship with no casualties. The next day, a larger landing force of marines went ashore; &quot;Irresistible&quot; provided support off Kumkale. After the landing party came under sniper fire from windmills above the village, &quot;Irresistible&quot; demolished them before shifting fire to the town itself. The Ottoman fire proved to be too heavy, however, and the marines had to retreat to their ships. &quot;Irresistible&quot; remained de Robeck&#x27;s flagship until 6 March, when &quot;Vengeance&quot; returned.

The next attack came on 8 March; the powerful superdreadnought , with her guns, was to demolish the main Ottoman fortress at Rumili, the &quot;Hamidieh I&quot;, &quot;Hamidieh II&quot;, and &quot;Namazieh&quot; batteries, and the fortress at Chemenlik. While she attacked those objectives, &quot;Irresistible&quot; and three other battleships were tasked with covering her from mobile field guns in the straits. Poor visibility hampered British shooting and made it easy for the Ottoman field guns to continually shoot and relocate before the battleships could locate them and return fire. The repeated failures to destroy the fortresses guarding the straits convinced the British command that further attempts were pointless until the minefields protecting the fortresses could be cleared, which would allow the battleships to engage and destroy them at very close range. Accordingly, trawlers were sent in during the night to clear the minefields while the British and French fleets replenished ammunition and gathered reinforcements. While this work was ongoing, &quot;Irresistible&quot;, &quot;Albion&quot;, and the battleship were sent in on 9 March to raid Ottoman defences; &quot;Irresistible&quot; inflicted damage on a bridge used to support the fort at Kumkale. The next morning, &quot;Irresistible&quot;, the battleship , the light cruiser , and the seaplane carrier made another foray to attack targets of opportunity.

====Loss====
By mid-March, it had become clear that the plan to sweep the minefields had failed. In response, de Robeck, who had succeeded Carden as the commander of the Dardanelles campaign, proposed to launch a major daylight attack on the fortresses, suppress them as best as possible at longer range, and to clear the minefields at the same time. This would then allow the battleships to demolish the forts at close range. Ottoman opposition was expected to be very heavy, as they had been reinforcing their defences throughout the campaign; by this time, they had massed forty-two guns or larger, along with numerous mobile field guns. The attack was launched on 18 March, and &quot;Irresistible&quot; was again part of 2nd Division, which formed the second wave of the attack. &quot;Irresistible&quot; joined the fray at 14:39, shortly after the French battleship was mined and sunk in the straits; she and several other battleships attempted to suppress Ottoman guns that were firing on boats that were picking up survivors from &quot;Bouvet&quot;. &quot;Irresistible&quot; engaged the &quot;Namazieh&quot; Battery, which at that time was not actively firing. She quickly came under heavy fire from the &quot;Hamidieh I&quot; battery, which targeted the ship with four-shell salvos.

At 15:14, &quot;Irresistible&quot; was rocked by an explosion, and by 15:32, had begun to take on a list, prompting de Robeck to order her to withdraw to avoid further damage. At 16:15, &quot;Irresistible&quot;, having idled her engines, struck a mine that caused extensive damage to the ship. The mine detonated under her starboard engine room, flooding it and killing all but three of the men on duty there. The bulkhead that divided the starboard from the port engine room collapsed under the sudden weight of water, disabling that engine as well. Unable to maneuver, with a list of 7 degrees to starboard, and down by the stern, &quot;Irresistible&quot; became an attractive target for the Ottoman gunners. She drifted helplessly into range of Turkish guns, which laid down a heavy fire on her. Her main gun turrets began to malfunction, and she was obscured by smoke and spray. De Robeck ordered the battleship to take her under tow and pull her out of range of the Ottoman guns, and the destroyer came alongside and rescued most of the crew—28 officers and 582 men—despite the punishing Ottoman shelling. A group of ten men remained aboard to try to secure a line from &quot;Ocean&quot;. By the time &quot;Ocean&quot; had arrived it had become clear that &quot;Irresistible&quot; could not be saved. Her list had increased and the fire from the Ottoman guns had become very heavy, so the remaining men were evacuated and &quot;Ocean&quot; began to withdraw.

With the heavy losses that day—&quot;Bouvet&quot;, &quot;Irresistible&quot;, and &quot;Ocean&quot;, which had been mined and disabled after withdrawing from her attempt to rescue &quot;Irresistible&quot;—de Robeck issued the order to break off the attack. That evening, the destroyer entered the Dardanelles to torpedo and sink the two abandoned battleships to prevent their capture in case they had remained afloat, but could find no sign of them. The Ottomans later reported that the derelict &quot;Irresistible&quot; had drifted closer to shore and suffered further severe damage from their shore batteries before sinking at about 19:30. &quot;Irresistible&quot;″s crew suffered about 150 casualties during her sinking.

<text>Drakengard, known in Japan as is a 2003 action role-playing video game developed by Cavia and published by Square Enix for the PlayStation 2. The game is the first installment of the &quot;Drakengard&quot; series and features a mixture of ground-based hack-and-slash, aerial combat, and role-playing elements which have become a staple of the series. The story is set during a religious war between two factions—the Union and the Empire—with the war tipping in favor of the Empire. The player controls Caim, a deposed prince of the Union, in his quest for vengeance against the Empire. Wounded in battle while protecting his sister Furiae, he is forced to make a pact with a red dragon named Angelus as they journey together on a quest to prevent the Empire from destroying magical seals that keep the world in balance.

Takamasa Shiba and Takuya Iwasaki conceived the game as a hybrid between the popular &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; series and Namco&#x27;s aerial combat game &quot;Ace Combat&quot;. It was Shiba&#x27;s first project as a producer. The dark story was created by director Yoko Taro and Sawako Natori, who wrote the majority of the script. The music was written by Nobuyoshi Sano and Takayuki Aihara. A Europe-exclusive mobile adaptation was developed by Macrospace and published by Square Enix for Vodafone devices in August 2004.
&quot;Drakengard&quot; sold well in Japan and received mixed to positive reviews in the west: reviewers praised the game&#x27;s story and music, but were mixed about the graphics and criticized the gameplay for being repetitive.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Drakengard&quot; is an action role-playing video game featuring three types of gameplay: ground missions, aerial missions, and Free Expedition Mode. The gameplay modes are called Ground Mode, Strafe Mode, and Air Mode. In some levels, players can switch between ground-based and aerial combat. Ground-based gameplay primarily has the player controlling the main protagonist, Caim. He has access to three types of attack: a standard sword-slash, a magic attack and a dash attack that throws enemies to the ground. Additional weapons can be accessed and swapped via the menu. Weapons gain experience levels through use, dealing more damage as a result. Each has a four-level cap. The player can access up to eight weapons during a mission. Pressing the attack button repeatedly while in combat with enemy units triggers combos, and pressing another button mid-combo will trigger a special attack which will temporarily incapacitate enemy units in the immediate area. The player can also temporarily switch between Caim and an assigned ally, who shares similar attacks but deals more damage. These allies are gained in optional levels and can only be summoned a limited number of times.

In aerial combat missions, players control Caim&#x27;s dragon partner Angelus. During these moments, players are directed against multiple aerial targets that must be destroyed in order to win. As Angelus gains experience points through combat, she levels up and is able to do more damage – similar to the weapons used in ground-based combat. Boss battles are all located in these aerial stages. Angelus has access to two types of standard fire attacks: a free-aim blast that causes high damage, and homing bolts that can hit multiple targets but do less damage. Homing shots can be dodged or countered by some enemy types later in the game. Angelus can also perform a special area-affecting magical attack that damages or kills multiple enemy units. She can be used to quickly traverse battle areas during primarily ground-based missions. Players can summon Angelus during certain ground-based missions and play her in Strafe Mode. Controls are identical to ground-based combat. Pressing the select button causes Caim to dismount Angelus. Caim and Angelus level up during combat in different ways: as Caim levels up, their shared health meter grows, while Angelus&#x27; leveling increases the damage her attacks do to enemy units.

Players can navigate the game world and select missions via a world map accessed between levels. While playing, a mini-map allows the player to see enemy locations, and a full-screen map can be switched to that covers the entire area and shows mission objectives. &quot;Drakengard&quot;″s levels are called verses, and the verses are grouped across thirteen chapters. Each level has a time limit of one hour for players to complete them. Normal levels are numbered, while additional levels are marked by Roman numerals. The game features five endings: the normal ending and four additional endings which are unlocked when certain conditions are met, such as completing optional chapters or obtaining powerful weapons. 

==Synopsis==
===Setting and characters===

&quot;Drakengard&quot; takes place in a medieval dark fantasy world called Midgard. The world is protected from falling into chaos by the Seals, objects magically linked to a woman chosen as the Goddess of the Seal. If the seals and the Goddess were destroyed, malevolent beings known as the Watchers would enter the world to destroy humanity. A key element of the world is the ability for a human and a beast to form a pact, a ritual that ties their souls together and grants great power. Their lives become bound by the pact, and the human pays a price for it in the form of some attribute (e.g. their voice, their eyesight or their ability to age). During the events of &quot;Drakengard&quot;, the Union, which protects the Seals, is in the midst of a religious war with the Empire, a power led by a cult who believe that destroying the seals will bring them good fortune.

The main characters are , a deposed prince of the Union, and , a red dragon. Joining Caim and Angelus in optional sections of the story are , a hermit who loses his brothers in an attack by the Empire; , an elf woman driven mad by the murder of her family; and , a young boy from the Empire whose village was destroyed by the cult&#x27;s devotees. Other prominent characters are , Caim&#x27;s sister and the current Goddess of the Seal; , Furiae&#x27;s former fiancé; , a priest in charge of protecting the Goddess Seal; and , Seere&#x27;s sister, leader of the enemy cult and the game&#x27;s main antagonist.

===Plot===
&quot;Drakengard&quot; opens with Caim in the midst of a battle to protect his sister from the Empire. During the battle, Caim is mortally injured, but continues to fight his way into Furiae&#x27;s castle, where he finds Angelus severely wounded from torture. Despite their mutual mistrust, Caim and Angelus agree to make a pact and save each other. With the attack repelled, Caim is joined by Furiae and Inuart to find safety, encountering Verdelet on their travels. Inuart is captured, tortured and brainwashed by Manah, eventually kidnapping Furiae in the belief that he can save her from her fate as the Goddess and earn her love. Verdelet and Caim travel to each of the three Seals, but each time arrive too late to stop them being destroyed. Eventually, the Union and the Empire engage in battle, and the Union emerge victorious. After the battle, however, the Union&#x27;s surviving troops are decimated by an unknown force from above, and the Empire&#x27;s troops return to life. Caim and Angelus travel to an Imperial fortress that has appeared in the sky, where they find that Furiae has killed herself, breaking the final seal. Inuart, seeing her body, is released from his brainwashing and takes her away.

Optional missions allow Caim to find and recruit Leonard and Seere, and take along Arioch to protect others from her madness. Subsequent playthroughs and extra chapters reveal further details about the characters. Leonard&#x27;s self-imposed seclusion is because he was trying to suppress his pedophilia, and the guilt at his brothers&#x27; deaths stems from the fact that he gave in to his cravings and left them unprotected. Arioch&#x27;s madness takes the form of cannibalism of children, in the belief that they would be safe from harm within her. Furiae is revealed to love Caim romantically, which led to Inuart becoming jealous and vulnerable to Manah&#x27;s influence. During the events leading to the third ending, Manah reveals Furiae&#x27;s feelings for Caim, who shows revulsion at the revelation: due to this and the Watchers&#x27; influence, Furiae stabs herself. Manah was abused by her and Seere&#x27;s mother, but Seere was never subjected to the abuse, leading him to feel guilty. The abuse Manah received and her longing for love eventually drove her insane, and she was chosen to become the Watchers&#x27; agent.

There are five possible endings, four of which are unlocked after fulfilling certain conditions.
*In the first ending, Caim and Angelus confront Manah and defeat her. Manah asks them to kill her, but Angelus declares that she must live with her crimes. Angelus then offers herself as the new Goddess of the Seal for Caim&#x27;s sake. As Verdelet performs the ritual, Angelus tells Caim her name before fading away.
*In the second ending. Inuart uses a magical object called a &quot;Seed of Resurrection&quot; to resurrect Furiae: while successful, the Seed turns her into a monster, and she kills Inuart. Caim is forced to kill her, but not before clones of her are produced from other Seeds to destroy humanity.
*In the third ending, after Furiae&#x27;s suicide, Caim and Angelus stop Inuart&#x27;s attempt to resurrect her and confront Manah, who is killed by another dragon. With the dragons now being driven to destroy mankind, Angelus breaks her pact with Caim and fights him to the death. Caim then prepares to die fighting the other dragons.
*In the fourth ending, Seere has his Golem pact partner kill the deranged Manah, causing the fortress to collapse. Caim, Seere, Leonard and Arioch escape, while Inuart and Furiae are killed inside. With Manah dead, the Watchers descend on the Imperial capital, with Leonard and Arioch dying at their hands. Caim and Angelus then sacrifice themselves to allow Seere to use his powers to seal the city and the Watchers in a timeless zone, nullifying their threat.
*In the fifth ending, instead of using Seere&#x27;s power, Caim and Angelus instead attack the queen and the three disappear through a portal. After engaging the queen monster in a rhythm game in modern-day Tokyo, the two destroy it, and are then shot down by a fighter jet.

==Development==
The original idea for &quot;Drakengard&quot; originated between Takamasa Shiba and Takuya Iwasaki when they were working at Cavia. It was conceived as an aerial battle game similar to &quot;Ace Combat&quot;. The four-year development was Shiba&#x27;s first project as a producer. The team developing the game went under the moniker of &quot;Project Dragonsphere&quot;. As development progressed, ground-based battles were also incorporated after the success in Japan of &quot;Dynasty Warriors 2&quot;. Creating the change from ground to aerial gameplay was exceptionally difficult for the team as they encountered problems with the PlayStation 2 hardware. Speaking in 2013, Shiba commented that Cavia had been inexperienced in creating action games, and as such it was not up to the standards of its contemporaries. The game&#x27;s battle scenes were inspired by films such as the 1999 version of &quot;The Mummy&quot; and its spin-off &quot;The Scorpion King&quot;, as well as films like &quot;Dragonheart&quot; and epic films from Asia. Iwasaki was unable to take up the position of director because of other projects he was involved with: the position instead went to Yoko Taro, who was primarily responsible for the game&#x27;s tone. The lead programmers were Toshiyuki Koike and Takeshi Katayama. The CGI cutscenes were created by Studio Anima. During production, the team were asked to make multiple adjustments and changes to its content by &quot;Drakengard&quot;″s advisory board. It was annoying enough for Yoko that he decided at the time not to make another &quot;Drakengard&quot;. Yoko was worried that the dark tone would cause the game to go unreleased, so one of the game&#x27;s external producers Yosuke Saito went to Sony with a pitch; Sony were so tired of reviewing pitches at the time that they approved the project without looking at it.

The game was originally announced in December 2002, then set to be published by Enix. Its date was announced the following year by Square Enix. It released in Japan on September 11, 2003. &quot;Drakengard&quot; was first shown off to the western public at E3 2003. Its title was changed for the Western release. The original &quot;Drag-On Dragoon&quot; title was chosen for its sound, but was not considered right for the western market. Because of this, it was changed to &quot;Drakengard&quot;. In addition, some of the more mature themes, such as references to incest and sexual taboos, were censored in the western localization. In North America, the game released on March 2, 2004. While Square Enix published the title in Japan and North America, Take-Two Interactive was chosen to publish it in European territories, releasing it on May 21. For this version, the game underwent major debugging and an alteration in the angle of the in-game camera. The mobile port was part of Square Enix&#x27;s plans to branch out into the European mobile game market. It was co-developed with London-based mobile developer Macrospace as part of a collaboration between Square Enix and Vodafone, designed to function on the Vodafone live! service. It was first released in Germany, then made available in the United Kingdom, Spain and Italy.

===World design===
The setting, mythos and landscape were primarily inspired by the folklore of Northern Europe, while other elements drew from Japanese-style revisionism. According to Shiba, multiple elements of the story and world were created to be dark, sad and serious in tone, in contrast to the likes of &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;. One of the core narrative threads, involving romantic feelings between siblings, was inspired in Yoko&#x27;s mind by the anime series &quot;Sister Princess&quot;. Another series that inspired the team was &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, with a comparison being drawn between them due to a shared trait: while having standard premises, darker narrative elements were hidden in its content. The central narrative theme was &quot;Immorality&quot;, which was mostly demonstrated by writer Sawako Natori through the characters. Multiple endings were made because Yoko was told that the game would not have a sequel. The characters&#x27; stories were created by Yoko and Iwasaki, who independently created the character backgrounds: Yoko took charge of Seere, Leonard and Arioch, while Iwasaki was involved in developing Verdelet, Inuart and Caim. In an interview concerning her role in the game, Natori admitted to feeling embarrassed by her writing when hearing Sota Murakami and Natsuki Yamashita, who voiced Seere and Manah, speak their lines.

Caim, the main protagonist, was meant to be an examination of the typical action game hero, which Yoko felt should not have a happy ending in a story focused on violence. The nature of Caim and Angelus&#x27; relationship underwent changes during development: Yoko had conceived their relationship as a parasitic one, but Iwasaki wanted to create a different type of romance, and so wrote the love story for the two of them. The actor who portrayed the two was Shinnosuke Ikehata: though originally cast for the role of Caim, his versatility also got him the role of Angelus. Furiae was designed by Yoko as both an explanation for Caim and Inuart&#x27;s rivalry, and as a representation of his distaste for the kind of forgettable character she represented. The relationship between Caim and Furiae, as well as their ultimate fates, was Yoko&#x27;s response to the standard happy ending found in most role-playing games at the time, which he felt did not fit in with a protagonist who had killed hundreds during their quest. The second ending was principally inspired by this and his dislike for &quot;Sister Princess&quot;. Caim and Furiae were respectively based around Guts from &quot;Berserk&quot; and Rei Ayanami from &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, with Caim being codenamed &quot;Guts&quot; during development.

Inuart was originally designed as the main protagonist of &quot;Drakengard&quot;, with him being a &quot;useless hero&quot;. A pivotal scene in the game, where he first clashes with Caim, became one of the ways Yoko was able to properly project his vision of the game&#x27;s world. Verdelet was portrayed as the &quot;despicable elder&quot;, who cared for no-one except himself: his personality was intended to be both ineffectual and bossy, even in the face of catastrophe. Manah&#x27;s role in &quot;Drakengard&quot; was designed to represent unloved children. The fifth ending, a boss battle in modern-day Tokyo, was created as a joke ending in the same vein as the &quot;Silent Hill&quot; series and an unexpected twist for players who were expecting an upbeat tone after the previous endings. Titled &quot;the End of dragon sphere&quot;, this ending served as a tribute to &quot;The End of Evangelion&quot;.

Character designs were done by Kimihiko Fujisaka. &quot;Drakengard&quot; was his first job as a character designer: his designs were firmly seated within the Medieval European aesthetic. To achieve this, he imagined that he had been sent back to that historical period. His designs were inspired by the character designs of &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;. Caim was one of the earliest characters created for &quot;Drakengard&quot;. In Inuart&#x27;s design, Fujisaka incorporated heavy armor into his design to give a more forceful impression for players. His ultimate role and final design were based around the idea of him being Caim&#x27;s rival. The design of the black dragon, which acted as Inuart&#x27;s pact beast, did not impress Shiba, who considered cutting it from the final product. Manah&#x27;s red clothing was designed to evoke both its status as the game&#x27;s key color, and her status as the leader of the Cult of the Watchers. Shiba approved of the design, feeling that it contrasted nicely with Furiae&#x27;s predominantly white design. Fujisaka also helped design Furiae&#x27;s monster form for the game&#x27;s second ending. In hindsight, Fujisaka was dissatisfied with his work on &quot;Drakengard&quot;, particularly his work on Caim. The game&#x27;s monsters were designed by Taro Hasegawa.

===Music===

The music was composed by Nobuyoshi Sano and Takayuki Aihara: the two used excerpts from pieces of classical music (selected by Aihara), then rearranged, remixed and layered them. Their main objective was to create music that emulated the gameplay, as well as the story and general narrative theme of &quot;madness&quot;. The music was intended to be &quot;experimental&quot; and &quot;expressionistic&quot; rather than &quot;commercial&quot;. The theme song, , was composed by Sano, written by Natori and sung by Eriko Hatsune. The soundtrack was originally released in two volumes under the names &quot;Drag-On Dragoon Original Soundtrack Vol.1&quot; and &quot;Drag-On Dragoon Original Soundtrack Vol.2&quot;, released on October 22 and November 21, 2003, respectively. The soundtrack was re-released on April 20, 2011, as a two-disc set under the title &quot;Drag-On Dragoon Original Soundtrack&quot;.

== Reception ==

&quot;Drakengard&quot; sold more than 122,000 units in its first week of release in Japan, taking &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: Encounters in Space&quot;″s place at the top of the sales charts. By the end of 2003, it had sold 241,014 copies. Gaming magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot; ranked it as the 50th best-selling title of 2003, and sold well enough that it was made part of Square Enix&#x27;s Ultimate Hits series, re-releases of popular titles. Its strong sales were attributed by the team to its cinematic story and similarity to the popular &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; series. In Europe, the game sold 110,000 units by September 2004.

According to GameSpot, &quot;Drakengard&quot; received favorable reviews in Japan. &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it an overall score of 29/40. After the game&#x27;s reveal at E3, multiple video game publications, including &quot;&quot;, IGN and &quot;Game Informer&quot;, praised its promising story and mixture of gameplay genres. The game received &quot;average&quot; reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.

The story received the highest amount of praise. IGN&#x27;s Jeremy Dunham called it the game&#x27;s &quot;biggest strength&quot;, praising the edgy themes explored and the balance between fantasy and realism. He also praised the multiple parallels with &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;. The reviewer for Computer and Video Games (CVG) praised &quot;the maturity and wit of the dialogue and unfolding plot&quot;, noting that they stood alongside other Square Enix RPGs of the time. VideoGamer.com&#x27;s Adam Jarvis praised the game&#x27;s storytelling style, saying that while it became &quot;a little bogged down at various points, it is deep enough to keep your interest throughout the game.&quot; GameSpot&#x27;s Greg Kasavin said that &quot;though the story itself is awkwardly paced and is sometimes difficult to keep up with, it becomes one of the main motivating factors for wanting to get all the way through to the end of the game.&quot;

The graphics received mixed responses. Kasavin said the game &quot;looks decent but, ultimately, not all that good&quot;. He criticized the bland environments and awkward movements for enemy units and the playable character, but praised the design of the dragon. &quot;Game Informer&quot; was more positive, praising the graphical detail and cutscenes and the look of enemy units, despite finding pop-up issues and framerate dips. Jarvis praised the design of the main cast, but cited the repetitive enemy design and dark environments as detracting elements. Dunham praised the character and monster designs as well as the full-motion cutscenes, but was less impressed by the repetitive human enemy designs, bland environments and low draw distance. The full-motion videos were also praised by the CVG reviewer.

Reaction to the sound design was mixed to positive. Dunham praised the majority of the British-style voice acting, but called the music &quot;disappointing&quot;. &quot;Game Informer&quot; cited the low number of background tracks and voice acting &quot;straight out of a renaissance festival&quot; as poorer parts of the game. Kasavin praised the voice acting and called the music &quot;the most nerve-racking and most intense aspect of the game.&quot; Jarvis was also positive, praising the sound design for battles, most of the voice acting and the music, which &quot;[helped] create a suitably dark atmosphere.&quot;

Reception of the gameplay was mixed to negative, with Dunham saying it suffered the same problems as its derivative games despite its easy entertainment value, while Jarvis called the options in gameplay &quot;fairly limited&quot;. The CVG reviewer praised the aerial segments of gameplay, calling them the most entertaining, and found that the standard combat served to embellish the protagonist&#x27;s &quot;kick-ass persona, making him more than just another anonymous dragon rider&quot;. The main criticism was repetition in the gameplay. Kasavin was exceptionally critical, saying that the gameplay both made the process of playing laborious and detracted from the main story. &quot;Game Informer&quot; called the gameplay &quot;fun, but [lacking] any semblance of depth.&quot;

==Legacy==
&quot;Drakengard&quot; received two novelizations by Emi Nagashima (writing as Jun Eishima) and Takashi Aizawa. The game&#x27;s events were retold again in a special story titled &quot;Drakengard 1.3&quot;, which followed on from the spin-off manga &quot;Drag-On Dragoon: Shi ni Itaru Aka&quot;. In March 2014, Hardcore Gamer&#x27;s Jahanzeb Khan favorably referred to the game as a precursor to the TV adaptation of the book series &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; in its handling of taboo themes and violence. The game was considered successful enough in Japan by Square Enix that a sequel was commissioned. &quot;Drakengard 2&quot; was again produced by Shiba, but Yoko was replaced as director by Akira Yasui, resulting in numerous thematic changes. Originally set following the first ending of &quot;Drakengard&quot;, it was later retconned into an isolated timeline. A prequel, &quot;Drakengard 3&quot;, was released in 2013, with multiple staff members returning to their original roles.

An attempt to create another title in the series resulted in the spin-off &quot;Nier&quot;, which retains links and themes from the main series. &quot;Nier&quot; takes place over a thousand years after the events of &quot;Drakengard&quot;″s fifth ending. When Cavia was absorbed by AQ Interactive after &quot;Nier&quot;″s release, a future attempt by Shiba to continue the series was unsuccessful. A sequel, &quot;&quot;, was developed by PlatinumGames in collaboration with previous &quot;Nier&quot; staff and released in 2017, taking place after &quot;Nier&quot;″s fourth ending.

<text>The Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations was an English colony on the eastern coast of America, founded in 1636 by Puritan minister Roger Williams after his exile from the Massachusetts Bay Colony. It became a haven for religious dissenters and was known for its commitment to religious freedom and self-governance.

The colony was officially chartered by the Patent of 1643–1644, granted by the English Parliament. It received a more comprehensive Royal Charter in 1663 from King Charles II, which established its government and guaranteed its religious liberties. Rhode Island continued as a self-governing colony until 1776, when it declared independence from Great Britain during the American Revolution, becoming the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.

==First settlements==
The land was first owned by the Narragansett Indians, which led to the name of the town of Narragansett, Rhode Island. European settlement began around 1622 with a trading post at Sowams, now the town of Warren, Rhode Island.

The first four European Settlements were at Providence, Portsmouth, Newport and Warwick.

===Roger Williams—Providence===
Roger Williams was a Puritan theologian and linguist who founded Providence Plantations in 1636. He sought refuge among the Narragansetts and negotiated with sachems Canonicus and Miantonomo for land, agreeing to trade goods in exchange. He named the settlement Providence Plantations to express his gratitude for divine guidance. 

Williams had been exiled from the Massachusetts Bay Colony under religious persecution; he and his fellow settlers agreed on an egalitarian constitution providing for majority rule &quot;in civil things&quot; with liberty of conscience on spiritual matters. He named three islands in the Narragansett Bay after Christian virtues: Patience, Prudence, and Hope Islands.

===Island settlements—Portsmouth and Newport===
In 1637, another group of Massachusetts dissenters settled on Aquidneck Island, which was called Rhode Island at the time. They established a settlement called Pocasset at the northern end of the island. The group included William Coddington, John Clarke, and Anne and William Hutchinson, among others. That settlement, however, quickly split into two separate settlements. Samuel Gorton and others remained to establish the settlement of Portsmouth in 1638, while Coddington and Clarke established nearby Newport in 1639. Both settlements were situated on Rhode Island.

===Shawomet Purchase—Warwick===
The second settlement on the mainland was Samuel Gorton&#x27;s &quot;Shawomet Purchase&quot; from the Narragansetts in 1642. As soon as he settled there, however, the Massachusetts Bay authorities laid claim to his territory and acted to enforce their claim. Gorton traveled to London to enlist the help of Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick, head of the Commission for Foreign Plantations. He returned in 1648 with a letter from Rich ordering Massachusetts to cease molesting him and his people. In gratitude, he changed the name of Shawomet Plantation to Warwick.

==Coddington Charter attempt==
In 1651, William Coddington obtained a separate charter from England setting up the Coddington Commission, which made him life governor of the islands of Rhode Island and Conanicut in a federation with Connecticut Colony and Massachusetts Bay Colony. 

Protest, open rebellion, and a further petition to Oliver Cromwell in London led to the reinstatement of the original 1643 Patent.

==1663 Royal Charter==

Following the 1660 restoration of royal rule in England, it was necessary to gain a Royal Charter from King Charles II. Charles was a Catholic sympathizer in staunchly Protestant England, and he approved of the colony&#x27;s promise of religious freedom. He granted the request with the Royal Charter of 1663, uniting the four settlements together into the English Colony of Rhode-Island and Providence Plantations. 

In the following years, many persecuted groups settled in the colony, notably Quakers and Jews. The Rhode Island colony was very progressive for the time, passing laws abolishing witchcraft trials, imprisonment for debt, and most capital punishment. The colony also passed the first anti-slavery law in America on May 18, 1652, though the practice remained widespread in Rhode Island and there exists no evidence that the legislation was ever enforced.

==King Philip&#x27;s War==
Rhode Island remained at peace with the Narragansett Indians, but the relationship was more strained between other New England colonies and certain tribes. This situation frequently led to bloodshed, despite attempts by the Rhode Island leadership to broker peace. 

During King Philip&#x27;s War (1675–1676), Colonist and Indian fighting regularly violated Rhode Island&#x27;s neutrality. The war&#x27;s largest battle occurred in Rhode Island on December 19, 1675 when a force of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Plymouth militia under General Josiah Winslow invaded and destroyed the fortified Narragansett village in the Great Swamp. 

The Narragansetts also invaded and burned several towns in Rhode Island, including Providence. Roger Williams had known both Metacom (Philip) and Canonchet since they were children. He was aware of the tribe&#x27;s activities and promptly sent letters informing the Governor of Massachusetts of enemy movements. Providence Plantations made some efforts at fortifying the town, and Williams even started training recruits for protection. In one of the final actions of the war, troops from Connecticut killed Philip in Mount Hope, Rhode Island.

==Dominion of New England==
In the 1680s, Charles II sought to streamline administration of the English colonies and to more closely control their trade. The Navigation Acts passed in the 1660s were widely disliked, since merchants often found themselves trapped and at odds with the rules. However, many colonial governments refused to enforce the acts, Massachusetts principally among them, and Massachusetts took matters one step further by obstructing the activities of the Crown agents. Charles&#x27; successor James II introduced the Dominion of New England in 1686 as a means to accomplish these goals. Under its provisional president Joseph Dudley, the disputed &quot;King&#x27;s Country&quot; (now Washington County) was brought into the dominion, and the rest of the colony was brought under dominion control by Governor Edmund Andros. The rule of Andros was extremely unpopular, especially in Massachusetts. The 1688 Glorious Revolution deposed James II and brought William III and Mary II to the English throne; Massachusetts authorities conspired in April 1689 to have Andros arrested and sent back to England. With this event, the dominion collapsed and Rhode Island resumed its previous government.

The bedrock of the economy continued to be fishing and agriculture, especially dairy farming; lumber and shipbuilding also became major industries. The Rhode Island General Assembly legalized African and Native American slavery throughout the colony in 1703, and the slave trade fueled the growth of Providence and Newport into major ports. By 1755, enslaved people made up 10% of the colony&#x27;s population. The Rhode Island merchants also profited by distilling rum as part of the triangular trade in slaves and sugar between Africa, America, and the Caribbean.

==American Revolutionary period==
Rhode Island was the first of the Thirteen Colonies to take up arms against Great Britain in the &quot;Gaspee&quot; Affair, when an armed group of men attacked and burned a British Navy ship. This impromptu attack occurred in June, 1772, more than a year before the more famous Boston Tea Party. 

Leading figures in the colony were involved in the 1776 launch of the American Revolutionary War which brought American independence from the British Empire. This included Governors Stephen Hopkins and Samuel Ward, as well as John Brown, Nicholas Brown, William Ellery, the Reverend James Manning, and the Reverend Ezra Stiles, each of whom had played an influential role in founding Brown University in Providence in 1764 as a sanctuary for religious and intellectual freedom.

On May 4, 1776, Rhode Island became the first of the 13 colonies to renounce its allegiance to the British Crown, and it was the fourth to ratify the Articles of Confederation among the newly sovereign states on February 9, 1778. It boycotted the 1787 convention that drew up the United States Constitution, and initially refused to ratify it. It relented after Congress sent a series of constitutional amendments to the states for ratification, the Bill of Rights guaranteeing specific personal freedoms and rights, clear limitations on the government&#x27;s power in judicial and other proceedings, and explicit declarations that all powers not specifically delegated to Congress by the Constitution are reserved for the states or the people. On May 29, 1790, Rhode Island became the 13th state and the last of the former colonies to ratify the Constitution.

==Boundaries==
The boundaries of Rhode Island underwent numerous changes from early Colonial times well after American independence, including repeated disputes with Massachusetts and Connecticut who contested for control of territory that ultimately belonged to Rhode Island. Rhode Island&#x27;s early compacts did not stipulate the boundary on the eastern shore of Narrangansett Bay, and did not include any of Washington County, land that belonged to the Narragansett people. The original settlements were at Providence, Warwick, Newport, and Portsmouth, and the territory was expanded by purchasing land from the Narragansetts westward toward Connecticut and the smaller islands in Narrangasett Bay. Block Island was settled in 1637 after the Pequot War, became a part of the colony in 1664, and was incorporated in 1672 as New Shoreham.

===Western boundary===
The western boundary with Connecticut Colony was defined ambiguously as the &quot;Narragansett River&quot; in the Connecticut charter, which was decided by arbitrators in 1663 to be the Pawcatuck River from its mouth to the Ashaway River mouth, from which a northward line was drawn to the Massachusetts line. This resolved a long-standing dispute concerning the former Narragansett lands which were also claimed by Connecticut and Massachusetts, although the dispute continued until 1703, when the arbitration award was upheld. After repeated surveys, a mutually agreeable line was defined and surveyed in 1728.

===Eastern boundary===
The eastern boundary was an area of dispute with Massachusetts Bay Colony. Overlapping charters had awarded an area extending three miles inland to both Plymouth Colony and Rhode Island east of Narragansett Bay; this area was awarded to Rhode Island in 1741, establishing Rhode Island&#x27;s jurisdiction over Barrington, Warren, Bristol, Tiverton, and Little Compton which Massachusetts had claimed. Also adjudicated in the 1741 decision was the award of most of Cumberland to Rhode Island from Massachusetts. The final establishment of the boundaries north of Barrington and east of the Blackstone River occurred almost a century after American independence, requiring protracted litigation and multiple U.S. Supreme Court decisions. In the final decision, a portion of Tiverton was awarded to Massachusetts to become part of Fall River, and two-thirds of Seekonk (now eastern Pawtucket and East Providence) was awarded to Rhode Island in 1862.

===Northern boundary===
Rhode Island&#x27;s northern border with Massachusetts also underwent a number of changes. Massachusetts surveyed this line in 1642, but subsequent surveys by Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut agreed that it was placed too far south. In 1718-19, commissioners for Rhode Island and Massachusetts agreed on roughly that line anyway (except the section east of the Blackstone River, which remained disputed until 1741), and this is where the line remains today.

==Demographics==
From 1640 to 1774, the population of Rhode Island grew from 300 to 59,607, but then declined during the American Revolutionary War to 52,946 in 1780. William Coddington and a group of 13 other men bought Aquidneck Island from the Narragansett Indians in 1639, and the population of Newport, Rhode Island grew from 96 in 1640 to 7,500 in 1760 (making Newport the fifth-largest city in the Thirteen Colonies at the time), and Newport grew further to 9,209 by 1774. The black population in the colony grew from 25 in 1650 to 3,668 in 1774 (ranging between 3 and 10 percent of the population), and like the state as a whole, declined to 2,671 (or 5 percent of the population) by 1780. In 1774, Narragansetts accounted for 1,479 of the inhabitants of the colony (or three percent).

Rhode Island was the only New England colony without an established church. Rhode Island had only four churches with regular services in 1650, out of the 109 places of worship with regular services in the New England Colonies (including those without resident clergy), while there was a small Jewish enclave in Newport by 1658. Following the First Great Awakening (1730–1755), the number of regular places of worship in Rhode Island grew to 50 in 1750 (30 Baptist, 12 Congregational, 7 Anglican, and 1 Jewish), with the colony gaining an additional 5 regular places of worship by 1776 (26 Baptist, 11 Friends, 9 Congregational, 5 Episcopal, 1 Jewish, 1 New Light Congregational, 1 Presbyterian, and 1 Sandemanian).

Puritan mass migration to New England began following the issuance of the royal charter for the Massachusetts Bay Company by Charles I of England in 1629 and continued until the beginning of the English Civil War in 1642. The immigration leveled off following the war&#x27;s conclusion in 1651, and the population growth owed almost entirely to natural increase rather than immigration or slave importations for the remainder of the 17th century and through the 18th century. Mass migration from New England to the Province of New York and the Province of New Jersey began following the surrender of New Netherland by the Dutch Republic at Fort Amsterdam in 1664, and the population of New York continued to expand by families moving from New England in the 18th century rather than from natural increase.

Most Puritan immigrants to New England moved as families, as approximately two-thirds of the male Puritan immigrants to New England were married rather than unmarried indentured servants. By the American Revolutionary War, only two percent of the New England colonial labor force were bonded or convict laborers and another two percent were black slaves, while nine percent of the colonial black population in New England were free, as compared with only three percent in the Southern Colonies. In February 1784, the Rhode Island General Assembly passed a gradual emancipation law that increased the ratio of the free black population in Rhode Island to 78 percent by the 1790 U.S. Census; slavery was completely eliminated in Rhode Island by 1842.

<doc id="489002" wikidata="Q233711" url="?curid=489002" title="Melissus of Samos">
<text>Melissus of Samos (; ; ) was the third and last member of the ancient school of Eleatic philosophy, whose other members included Zeno and Parmenides. Little is known about his life, except that he was the commander of the Samian fleet in the Samian War. Melissus’s contribution to philosophy was a treatise of systematic arguments supporting Eleatic philosophy. Like Parmenides, he argued that reality is ungenerated, indestructible, indivisible, changeless, and motionless. In addition, he sought to show that reality is wholly unlimited, and infinitely extended in all directions; and since existence is unlimited, it must also be one.

==Life==

Not much information remains regarding the life of Melissus. He may have been born around 500 BC; the date of his death is unknown. The little which is known about him is mostly gleaned from a small passage in Plutarch’s &quot;Life of Pericles&quot;. He was the commander of the Samian fleet in the Samian War, and defeated Pericles and the Athenian fleet in 440 BC. Plutarch claims that Aristotle says that Melissus had also defeated Pericles in an earlier battle. In his &quot;Life of Themistocles&quot;, Plutarch denies Stesimbrotos’s claim that Melissus was held in high regard by Themistocles, claiming that he is confusing Themistocles and Pericles. Melissus was reputed to have been the pupil of Parmenides, and the teacher of Leucippus, though one must regard such claims with a fair amount of skepticism.

==Philosophy==
Much of what remains of Melissus’s philosophical treatise, later titled &quot;On Nature&quot;, has been preserved by Simplicius in his commentaries on Aristotle’s &quot;Physics&quot; and &quot;On the Heavens&quot;, and several summaries of his philosophy have come down to us. Most of the remaining fragments can be found in Diels–Kranz. Unlike Parmenides, Melissus wrote his treatise in prose, not poetry, consequently making it easier to follow than that of his teacher. Like Parmenides, he claims that Being is one, ungenerated, indestructible, indivisible, changeless, motionless and the same. Melissus’s philosophy differs from that of Parmenides in two respects: (1) Parmenides claims that Being is limited, while Melissus claims that it is wholly unlimited; and (2) for Parmenides, Being existed in a timeless Present, while for Melissus Being is eternal. McKirahan claims that Parmenides argues for Being as spatially limited, but this is a contentious point.

===Eternal===
Melissus argues that since The One neither came to be nor is subject to destruction, it is therefore eternal. While fragment 1 is merely a summary of Parmenides’s arguments against coming to be and perishing (8.5–21), fragment 2 provides Melissus’s argument. Melissus’s argument is twofold, addressing the temporal aspect of The One somewhat as a timeline: granting the reality of the present moment, he argues that The One has existed eternally into the past and will exist eternally into the future. 

His argument is as follows:
#Whatever comes to be must have a beginning.
#According to fragment 1, The One did not come to be.
#Therefore, The One does not have a beginning.
#Therefore, The One is eternal (has always existed in the past).

in addition:
#Whatever has a beginning must also end.
#According to fragment 1, The One did not have a beginning.
#Therefore, The One will not end.
#Therefore, The One is eternal (will always exist in the future).

He restates his argument for The One as eternal in fragments 6 and 9.1.

It is in this respect that Melissus differs from Parmenides, although some argue that the difference is not as important as it might seem. Parmenides’s view is that there is only one moment (the eternal present), while Melissus argues for an infinite number of moments. The existence of a changeless, motionless, eternal present is an arguable position (as Time, by its nature, is merely made by change and motion and that, there would exist no such thing as Time if there were no change in quality or quantity); however, the existence of a changeless, motionless, infinite succession of moments is a much more difficult position to defend as moments are distinguished from one another by the change in quality or quantity of the one space that they exist within, otherwise, there would have been an infinite number of moments of the same quality and quantity, which is, in actuality, one continuous moment as Parmenides argued. 

There are several problems with Melissus’s reasoning. His second argument is based on a dubious premise (i.e., that whatever comes to be must also end at some point). Furthermore, both arguments, which can be reduced to “If A, then B; but not-A, therefore not-B”, are logically flawed.

It seems that both Parmenides and Melissus had in mind a mathematical figure of Time, though, for Parmenides, arithmetical and for Melissus, geometrical. Parmenides seems to mean that there is no end to the quantity of numbers, but the number &quot;One&quot; exists in all of them regardless of how great a number might become, so every other number is dependent upon the number &quot;one&quot;, therefore, every other number is just the repetition of this &quot;one&quot;, accumulated upon itself so there&#x27;s only and only &quot;one&quot; continuous moment; but Melissus took the number &quot;one&quot; to not be accumulated atop of itself but rather being juxtaposed next to itself in order to form a &quot;circular&quot; figure, thus, the beginning becomes the end, though indirectly, through infinite gates of media or moments.

===Unlimited===
Melissus contends that The One is unlimited. Fragments 7 and 8 apparently indicate that Melissus is speaking in terms of spatial infinity, although regarding fragment 3, which first argues this point, Simplicius explicitly denies this: “But by ‘magnitude’ he does not mean what is extended in space.” Simplicius undoubtedly had more of Melissus’s treatise at his disposal, as well as other commentaries and notes which have not survived to the present day.

In any case, Melissus’s argument for this claim is unclear, and it is possible that it has not been preserved for us. Alternatively, he may intend for this argument to follow from the arguments of fragments 1 and 2, either directly or indirectly. In the former case, unless the argument is based on a now lost theory on the relationship between time and space, it is, as McKirahan says, “grossly fallacious”. In the latter case, granting the “beginning” and “end” of fragment 2 spatial as well as temporal qualities leaves Melissus open to the charge of equivocation.

In fragment 6 Melissus connects an eternal existence and the quality of being unlimited. Melissus may have argued for this quality due to certain issues arising in Parmenides’s thesis (8.42-9). The argument is as follows:

#Whatever has a beginning and end is neither eternal nor unlimited.
#Being has no beginning or end.
#Therefore, it is eternal and unlimited.

This argument, as fragment 3, is logically flawed, being basically: “If not-A, then not-B”.

===One===
Melissus’s argument for the oneness of what-is, given mainly in fragments 7 and 8, is undoubtedly his best. His argument is clearer and more concise than the one provided by Parmenides. Melissus argues that, because what-is is unlimited, it must also be one, because if it were more than one it would have limits (namely, the boundaries between what-is and the other existing objects). His argument is founded on the premises that what-is is both spatially and temporally unlimited and is as follows:

#What-is is temporally unlimited.
#Therefore, nothing else temporally unlimited could exist at the same time.
#What-is is spatially unlimited.
#Therefore, nothing else spatially unlimited could exist at a different time.
#Therefore, what-is is one.

===The same===
In &quot;On Melissus, Xenophanes and Gorgias&quot;, Pseudo-Aristotle states that Melissus made a claim that The One is qualitatively the same. The validity of the argument depends on the nature of unity intended by Melissus. It is possible for one, single thing to have different parts: a human has a head, a body, two arms and two legs, but it is still one human. In most respects, Melissus is following in Parmenides’s footsteps, and so it is likely that Melissus is arguing for the same type of unity as Parmenides, namely, that The One is completely unified, with no parts to subdivide it. His argument is as follows:

#If what-is has qualitative differences, it is plural.
#What-is is one.
#What-is is whole in and of itself.
#Therefore, what-is has no qualitative differences (i.e., is the same).

This is not provided in the second-hand report by Pseudo-Aristotle; however, the quality of wholeness is a major claim in Parmenides’s thesis, and it is likely that Melissus either made the argument for this point in a fragment that has not come down to us or expected it to be understood or inferred from his other arguments.

===Changeless===
Melissus argues that The One cannot undergo any change. He specifically states that The One cannot be rearranged, become greater or smaller, or undergo any kind of distress, but we may safely expand his argument to include all kinds of change. If The One underwent any kind of change whatsoever, it would become different and thus would no longer be unified or whole. His argument is as follows:

#Whatever undergoes change is altered.
#Whatever is altered is not unified or whole.
#The One is unified and whole.
#Therefore, The One does not undergo any type of change.

===Motionless===
In fragment 9.7-10 Melissus makes the argument for motionless with the qualities of full and empty. He states that The One is full, because if it were empty it would be nothing, and what is nothing doesn’t exist. He then states that because The One is full, it can’t move. The argument is as follows:

#To be empty is to be nothing.
#What is nothing does not exist.
#The One exists.
#Therefore, The One is not empty.
#What is not empty must be full.
#Therefore, The One is full.

and further:
#Whatever has motion is not full.
#Whatever is full (i.e., has no empty spaces) must be motionless.
#The One is full.
#Therefore, The One is motionless.

===Incorporeal===
In fragment 5, Melissus makes the remarkable claim that The One is incorporeal. Just as his insistence that The One is unlimited, this claim may also be his attempt to address a potential problem inherent in Parmenides’s philosophy (8.42–9). His argument is as follows:

#The One is whole in and of itself.
#Therefore, The One has no parts.
#Therefore, The One has no thickness.
#Therefore, The One does not have a body.

This argument, on the surface, does not coincide with Melissus&#x27;s claim that The One is extended and full. After all, why can something that is extended not have any parts, and how can something that is full have no thickness? McKirahan offers an interesting interpretation for what Melissus may have been arguing. A body not only has extension, but also limits, and something infinitely large, such as The One, is unlimited; an object, then, with no limits, is not a body. Furthermore, thickness is simply the measure of the distance between a body’s limits. Since The One is unlimited, it cannot have thickness.

==Influence==
Melissus&#x27;s version of Eleatic philosophy was the chief source for its presentation in the works of Plato and Aristotle. Aristotle characterised Melissus&#x27;s work as &quot;a bit crude&quot; and stated that Melissus made &quot;invalid arguments starting from false assumptions&quot;. The later Peripatetic philosopher, Aristocles of Messene, also had little admiration for Melissus, calling several of his arguments &quot;absurd&quot;. Melissus has fared somewhat better in the eyes of modern scholars; he was an inventive philosopher and had the good quality of offering clear and direct arguments. Although he follows Parmenides in his general views and the framework of Eleaticism, he made original contributions and innovations to the substance of Eleatic philosophy.

<text>Linjeflyg was a Swedish domestic airline, formed in 1957 as a domestic subsidiary by Scandinavian Airlines System and Airtaco as well as by newspaper publishers Dagens Nyheter AB and Stockholms-Tidningen AB.

== History ==
Airtaco (founded in August 1950 as Aero Scandia) can be considered as Linjeflyg&#x27;s predecessor and was merged into the new airline, including its entire fleet. When Linjeflyg was founded, Airtaco&#x27;s four Lockheed Model 18 Lodestars and four Douglas DC-3s were integrated into the new fleet.

In October 1983 Linjeflyg moved from Stockholm Bromma Airport in the central part of Stockholm to Stockholm Arlanda Airport in the north of Stockholm. Bromma had been the main hub for Linjeflyg since 1957. On 10 September 1990 Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) sold their 50% in Linjeflyg to Bilspedition for 475 million Swedish crowns (SEK). Approximately six months later SAS bought it back.

In February 1992 Linjeflyg became too big a threat for SAS, because it planned a strategic alliance with Braathens and Maersk Air. Such an alliance would have been too competitive for SAS on the intra-Scandinavian capital routes and on domestic flights. Consequently SAS bought the 50% of Linjeflyg that it did not already own, to maintain its market dominance. On 1 January 1993 Linjeflyg was merged into SAS. Linjeflyg was Sweden&#x27;s largest domestic airline. It served over 20 domestic airports and carried over 5 million people annually. Linjeflyg had 2200 employees in 1992, and was at that time the largest Fokker F28 operator in the world.

==Incidents and accidents==
*On 20 November 1964 Flight 267V, operated by Convair 440 SE-CCK, crashed during an approach to Ängelholm joint civil/military Airport. In instrument conditions, the crew abandoned the set procedure and began the final approach too early. The reason for this must have been that the crew allowed themselves to be misled by an arrangement of lights peculiar to the airfield with which, apart from certain information received during the approach, they were not acquainted. Thirty-one of the 43 people aboard were killed in Sweden&#x27;s worst air disaster.
*On 15 January 1977 Flight 618, operated by Vickers Viscount SE-FOZ leased from Skyline, crashed at Kälvesta on approach to Bromma Airport, Stockholm owing to ice accretion on the tailplane leading to a loss of control. All 22 people on board were killed.

<text>Hasan al-Sabbah also known as Hasan I of Alamut, was a religious and military leader. He was the founder of the Nizari Ismai&#x27;li sect widely known as the &quot;Hashshashin&quot; or the Order of Assassins, as well as the Nizari Ismaili state, ruling from 1090 to 1124 AD. 

Alongside his role as a formidable leader, Sabbah was an accomplished scholar of mathematics, most notably in geometry, as well as astronomy and philosophy, especially in epistemology. It is narrated that Hasan and the Persian polymath Omar Khayyam were close friends since their student years. He and each of the later Assassin leaders came to be known in the West as the [[Old Man of the Mountain (Assassin)|Old Man of the Mountain]], a name given to the sect&#x27;s leader in the writings of Marco Polo that referenced the sect&#x27;s possession of the commanding mountain fortress of Alamut Castle.

==Sources==
Hasan is thought to have written an autobiography, which did not survive but seems to underlie the first part of an anonymous Isma&#x27;ili biography entitled &quot;Sargozasht-e Seyyednā&quot; (). The latter is known only from quotations made by later Persian authors. Hasan also wrote a treatise, in Persian, on the doctrine of &quot;ta&#x27;līm&quot;, called, &quot;al-Fusul al-arba&#x27;a&quot; The text is no longer in existence, but fragments are cited or paraphrased by al-Shahrastānī and several Persian historians.

==Early life and conversion==

===Qom and Rayy===
The possibly autobiographical information found in &quot;Sargozasht-i Seyyednā&quot; is the main source for Hasan&#x27;s background and early life. According to this, Hasan al-Sabbāh was born in the city of Qom, Persia in the 1050s to a family of Twelver Shia. His father, a Kufan Arab reportedly of Yemenite origins, had left the Sawād of Kufa (located in modern Iraq) to settle in the town of Qom, one of the first centres of Arab settlement in Persia and a stronghold of Twelver Shia.

Early in his life, his family moved to Rayy. Rayy was a city that had a history of radical Islamic thought since the 9th century, with Hamdan Qarmaṭ as one of its teachers.

It was in this religious centre that Hasan developed a keen interest in metaphysical matters and adhered to the Twelver code of instruction. During the day he studied at home, and mastered palmistry, languages, philosophy, astronomy and mathematics (especially geometry).

Rayy was also the home of Isma&#x27;ili missionaries in the Jibal. At the time, Isma&#x27;ilism was a growing movement in Persia and other lands east of Egypt. The Persian Isma&#x27;ilis supported the &quot;da&#x27;wa&quot; (&quot;mission&quot;) directed by the Fatimid caliphate of Cairo and recognized the authority of the Imam-Caliph al-Mustansir (d. 1094), though Isfahan, rather than Cairo, may have functioned as their principal headquarters. The Ismā&#x27;īlī mission worked on three layers: the lowest was the &quot;fida&#x27;i&quot; or foot soldier&quot;,&quot; followed by the &quot;rafīk&quot; or comrade, and finally the &quot;dā‘ī&quot; or missionary. It has been suggested that the popularity of the Ismā&#x27;īlī religion in Persia was due to the people&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the Seljuk rulers, who had recently removed local rulers.

===Conversion to Ismailism and training in Cairo===
At the age of 17, Hasan converted and swore allegiance to the Fatimid caliph in Cairo. Hasan&#x27;s studies did not end with his crossing over. He further studied under two other &quot;dā‘i&quot;s, and as he proceeded on his path, he was looked upon with eyes of respect.

Hasan&#x27;s austere and devoted commitment to the &quot;da&#x27;wa&quot; brought him in audience with the chief missionary of the region: &#x27;Abdu l-Malik ibn Attash. Ibn Attash, suitably impressed with the young seventeen-year-old Hasan, made him Deputy Missionary and advised him to go to Cairo to further his studies.

However, Hasan did not initially travel to Cairo. Some historians have postulated that Hasan, following his conversion, was playing host to some members of the Fatimid caliphate, and this was leaked to the anti-Fatimid and anti-Shī‘a vizier Nizam al-Mulk. This prompted his abandoning Rayy and heading to Cairo in 1076.

Hasan took about 2 years to reach Cairo. Along the way he toured many other regions that did not fall in the general direction of Egypt. Isfahan was the first city that he visited. He was hosted by one of the Missionaries of his youth, a man who had taught the youthful Hasan in Rayy. His name was Resi Abufasl and he further instructed Hasan.

From here he went to Arran (current Azerbaijan), hundreds of miles to the north, and from there through Armenia. Here he attracted the ire of priests following a heated discussion, and Hasan was thrown out of the town he was in.

He then turned south and traveled through Iraq, reached Damascus in Syria. He left for Egypt from Palestine. Records exist, some in the fragmentary remains of his autobiography, and from another biography written by Rashid-al-Din Hamadani in 1310, to date his arrival in Egypt at 30 August 1078.

It is unclear how long Hasan stayed in Egypt: about 3 years is the usually accepted amount of time. He continued his studies here, and became a full missionary.

===Return to Persia===
Whilst he was in Cairo, studying and preaching, he incurred the displeasure of the Chief of the Army, Badr al-Jamalī. This may have been a result of the fact that Hasan supported Nizar, the Ismaili Imam-Caliph al-Mustanṣir&#x27;s elder son, as the next Imam. Hasan was briefly imprisoned by Badr al-Jamali. The collapse of a minaret of the jail was taken to be an omen in favor of Hasan and he was promptly released and deported. The ship that he was traveling on was wrecked. He was rescued and taken to Syria. Traveling via Aleppo and Baghdad, he terminated his journey at Isfahan in 1081.

Hasan&#x27;s life now was totally devoted to the mission. Hasan toured extensively throughout Persia. In northern Persia, touching the south shore of the Caspian Sea, are the mountains of Alborz. These mountains were home to a people who had traditionally resisted attempts by both Arabs and Turkish subjugation; this place was also a home of Shia leaning. The news of this Ismā&#x27;īlī&#x27;s activities reached Nizam al-Mulk, who dispatched his soldiers with the orders for Hasan&#x27;s capture. Hasan evaded them, and went deeper into the mountains.

==Capture of Alamut==

His search for a base from which to guide his mission ended when in 1088 he found the castle of Alamut in the Rudbar area (modern Qazvin, Iran). It was a fort that stood guard over a valley that was about fifty kilometers long and five kilometers wide. This fortress had been built about the year 865; legend has it that it was built by a king who saw his eagle fly up to and perch upon a rock, a propitious omen, the importance of which this king, Wah Sudan ibn Marzuban, understood. Likening the perching of the eagle to a lesson given by it, he called the fort Aluh Amu(kh)t: the &quot;Eagles&#x27; Teaching&quot;.

Hasan&#x27;s takeover of the fort was conducted without any significant bloodshed. To effect this transition Hasan employed a patient and deliberate strategy, one which took the better part of two years to effect. First Hasan sent his &quot;Daʻiyyīn&quot; and &quot;Rafīk&quot;s to win over the villages in the valley, and their inhabitants. Next, key people amongst this populace were converted, and finally, in 1090, Hasan took over the fort by infiltrating it with his converts.

While legend holds that after capturing Alamut Hasan devoted himself to isolated study, this narrative is highly doubtful, given his extensive recruiting and organizational involvement in the growing Ismā&#x27;īlī insurrections in Persia and Syria. 

==Foreign views: Marco Polo and China==
The leaders of Nizari Isma&#x27;ilis in Persia, were designated by Marco Polo using a Syrian equivalent term known in Europe at that time, as &quot;Elder&quot; or &quot;Old Man of the Mountain&quot;. Polo&#x27;s travelogue (&quot;ca.&quot; 1300) describes the Old Man of the Mountain as a charlatan who devised plots to convert young men to his sect. At the &quot;court&quot; of the &quot;Old Man of the Mountain&quot; &quot;they were educated in various languages and customs, courtly etiquette, and trained in martial and other skills&quot;. At Alamut they had &quot;impressive libraries whose collections included books on various religious traditions, philosophical and scientific texts, and scientific equipment&quot;.

&quot;Xishiji&quot; （Chinese: 西使記）, a Chinese manuscript completed in 1263, relates a story similar to that of Polo. The sect leaders &quot;ordered to send assassins to hide in those kingdoms which did not surrender. They stabbed their lords, and women as well, and they died&quot;.

==Nizari doctrine==
Historians and scholars identify Hasan-i Sabbah as the founder of the Nizari Assassins and their doctrine. It developed during the struggle for succession of Nizar to the Fatimid throne in Cairo that eventually laid the foundation of the Nizari Isma&#x27;ilism Shia Islam. Since then, as a basic element of conservative nature, the Ismaili Imamate includes a &quot;hidden&quot; imam, in addition to the visible (or &quot;hazar&quot;, meaning apparent) &quot;imam of the time&quot;, acting as such in a community. An important task of the latter is the proliferation of the doctrine, and of the undisclosed imam&#x27;s &quot;spiritual guidance&quot;, in learning centers having instructors proficient in teaching techniques.

Devotion of the &quot;true believers&quot; having &quot;absolute faith&quot; in the beliefs is another element originating from the times of Sabbah in Northern Iran, who reportedly &quot;was so devout that he even had one of his sons executed after he was accused of drunkenness.&quot;

A Nizari assassin is identified as &quot;fida&#x27;i&quot; or devotee, &quot;who offers his life for others or in the service of a particular cause.&quot;

In Nizari literature, in a major departure from conventional Islamic tradition, Hasan declared Persian to be the language of holy literature for Nizaris – a decision that resulted in all the Nizari Ismā&#x27;īlī literature from Persia, Syria, Afghanistan and Central Asia to be transcribed in Persian for several centuries.

==Personal life==
Hasan is known for his ascetic and austere religious lifestyle. At his modest living quarters in the Alamut Castle, he spent most of his time reading, writing, and administering. During his 45 years of residence in Alamut, he apparently left his quarters only twice to ascend the rooftop.

Hasan al-Sabbah probably had one wife, two daughters, and two sons. Hasan&#x27;s wife and daughters were sent to Gerdkuh as a safe place during Shirgir&#x27;s campaign against Alamut; they never returned. They lived on spinning. He had both his sons executed, Muhammad for &quot;khamr&quot; and Ustad Husayn for his suspected role in the murder of &quot;da&#x27;i&quot; Husayn Qa&#x27;ini.

Hassan was highly revered by the Nizari community, whose members called him &quot;Sayyidna&quot; (&quot;Our Master&quot;) and regularly visited his mausoleum in Rudbar before it was demolished by the Mongols.

==In popular culture==
* Betty Bouthoul published a popular book in French titled &quot;Le grand maître des assassins&quot; (&quot;Master of the Assassins&quot;) about Hasan-i Sabbāh in 1936.

<text>The urial ( ; Ovis vignei), also known as arkars, shapo, or shapu, is a wild sheep native to Central and South Asia. It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.

== Taxonomy==
&quot;Ovis vignei&quot; was the scientific name proposed by Edward Blyth in 1841 for wild sheep in the Sulaiman Mountains. The specific name honours Godfrey Vigne (1801–1863).

The &quot;vignei&quot; subspecies group consists of six individual subspecies:

* Ladakh urial (&quot;Ovis vignei vignei&quot;): India (Ladakh), northern Pakistan, Kashmir
* Transcaspian urial (&quot;Ovis vignei arkal&quot;): Ustjurt-Plateau (Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, northern Iran) and western Kazakhstan
*Blanford&#x27;s urial or Baluchistan urial (&quot;Ovis vignei blanfordi&quot;): Pakistan (Balochistan)
*Bukhara urial (&quot;Ovis vignei bochariensis&quot;): Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan

*Afghan urial or Turkmenian sheep (&quot;Ovis vignei cycloceros&quot;): southern Turkmenistan, eastern Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan (north Balochistan)
*Punjab urial (&quot;Ovis vignei punjabiensis&quot;): provincial animal of Punjab, Pakistan

== Characteristics ==

Urial males have large horns, curling outwards from the top of the head turning in to end somewhere behind the head; females have shorter, compressed horns. The horns of the males are up to long. The shoulder height of an adult male urial is between .

== Distribution and habitat==
The urial is native to montane areas in the Pamir Mountains, Hindu Kush and Himalayas up to an elevation of . It is distributed from northeastern Iran, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and southwestern Kazakhstan to northern Pakistan and Ladakh in northwestern India. It prefers grassland, open woodland and gentle slopes, but also inhabits cold arid zones with little vegetation.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
The mating season begins in September. Rams select four or five ewes, which give birth to a lamb after a gestation of five months.

<doc id="489032" wikidata="Q690218" url="?curid=489032" title="Cam timer">
<text>A cam timer or drum sequencer is an electromechanical system for controlling a sequence of events automatically. It resembles a music box with movable pins, controlling electrical switches instead of musical notes.

==Description==
An electric motor drives a shaft arranged with a series of cams or a drum studded with pegs along its surface. Associated with each cam is one or more switches. The motor rotates at a fixed speed, and the camshaft is driven through a speed-reducing gearbox at a convenient slow speed. Indentations or protrusions on the cams operate the switches at different times. Complex sequences of opening and closing switches can be made by the arrangement of the cams and switches. The switches then operate different elements of the controlled system - for example, motors, valves, etc.

A programmer may change or rearrange (reprogram) peg or cam positions. Much like the pegs in a music box cylinder activate the notes, in a drum sequencer, as the drum of the sequencer spins, the pegs run across switches, activating machine processes. The placement of the pegs along the length of the cylinder determines which switch will activate along the length of the drum. Where the peg lies along the circular circumference of the drum determines at what point the peg will activate the switch in the drum&#x27;s spin. The drum performs repetitive switching operations by controlling the timing and sequence of switches.

Most cam timers use a miniature mains synchronous motor to rotate the mechanism at an accurate constant speed. Occasionally, more complex timers with two motors are seen.

A drum sequencer is a reprogrammable electromechanical timing device that activates electric switches in repetitive sequences. These sequencers were primarily used in industrial applications to enable automated manufacturing processes.

==Uses==
Industrial machines use Cam timers and drum sequencers to control repetitive sequencing operations. The cam followers often operated hydraulic valves. Cam timers in the industry were superseded by the introduction of programmable logic controllers (PLCs), which offer improved flexibility and more complicated control logic functions. In consumer products like washing machines, they were replaced with ASICs or microcontrollers.

The most common use for cam timers is in automatic washing machines, which drive the washing sequence according to a pre-programmed pattern. They are gradually being superseded by microprocessor-controlled systems, which have greater versatility and thus can more efficiently respond to various feedback.

Another example is the usage in electromechanical pinball machines, where the Cam timer is also known as a &#x27;Score Motor.&#x27;

==Methods used to increase control==
The most basic cam timer rotates continually, which is inconvenient when waiting for events that occur at variable times.

With washing machine cam timers, it is necessary to wait a variable amount of time (for example, waiting for a tank of water to heat up to a preset temperature). To achieve this, the cam motor is subjected to control by one of its switches. The timer sequence switches the cam motor off, and the motor is started again by the signal from the thermostat when the required temperature is reached.

Usually, washing machine thermostats have fewer fixed temperature detection points than the number of wash temperatures used. For intermediate temperatures, the cam mechanism uses the stop and wait for the method to heat to the nearest temperature below the one desired, then uses only the fixed timing of the heating element to increase the water to the desired temperature.

Some cam timers also have a fast forward mode, where applying power to a point on the controller causes rapid advance of the mechanism. This is often seen on washing machine controllers. Rapid advance can be achieved by moving of gearing, which may be triggered by various means.

Using feedback, external time delay, and other sensory circuits, it is possible to build an electromechanical state machine using a cam timer. These are common in washing machines, where the cam timer runs in phases, but also stops and waits for external signals such as a fill level sensor, or a water heating temperature sensor.

==Replacement with electronic controllers==
While still fairly popular, cam timers are mechanical and hence subject to wear and reliability problems. Their reliability record remains good, but there is always some failure rate with mechanical switch contacts.

Electronic controllers have largely replaced cam timers in most applications, primarily to reduce costs and also to maximize product features.

Cam timers don&#x27;t offer the greater flexibility that CPU-based controllers provide. In addition to offering more wash program variations, a CPU-based washing machine controller can respond to malfunctions, automatically initiate test cycles, reducing manufacturing costs, and provide fault codes in the field, again reducing repair costs. It also provides feedback on real-world failure rates and causes. All of these reduce manufacturing and business costs.

<doc id="489040" wikidata="Q1034494" url="?curid=489040" title="Cape Reinga">
<text>Cape Reinga / Te Rerenga Wairua (; sometimes spelled Rēinga, ) is the northwestern most tip of the Aupōuri Peninsula, at the northern end of the North Island of New Zealand. Cape Reinga is more than 100 km north of the nearest small town of Kaitaia.

In Māori, means the &quot;leaping-off place of spirits&quot;. is the Māori word for &quot;underworld&quot;. Both refer to the Māori belief that the cape is the point where the spirits of the dead enter the underworld.

Cape Reinga is a popular tourist site, with annual visitor numbers estimated at over 500,000 people. Visitor numbers are growing by about five percent a year, and the increase is likely to become even more now that the road to the cape is fully sealed.

==Geography==
Cape Reinga is generally considered the separation marker between the Tasman Sea to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east. From the lighthouse it is possible to watch the tidal race, as the two seas clash to create unsettled waters just off the coast. The Māori refer to this as the meeting of &quot;Te Moana-a-Rehua&quot;, &#x27;the sea of Rehua&#x27; with &quot;Te Tai-o-Whitirea&quot;, &#x27;the sea of Whitirea&#x27;, Rehua and Whitirea being a male and a female respectively.

The cape is often mistakenly thought of as being the northernmost point of the North Island, and thus, of mainland New Zealand. However, North Cape&#x27;s Surville Cliffs, 30 km east of Cape Reinga are 3 km further north. Another headland just to the west of Cape Reinga is Cape Maria van Diemen, which was named by the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman during his journey in 1642 and thought of by him to be the northernmost point of the newly discovered country he named &#x27;Staten Landt&#x27;. 

=== Access ===
Cape Reinga is more than 100 km north of the nearest small town of Kaitaia. State Highway 1 extends all the way to the cape, but until 2010 was unsealed gravel road for the last 19 km. Suitable vehicles can also travel much of the way via Ninety Mile Beach and Kauaeparaoa Stream (Te Paki Stream) stream bed.

The cape is also the northern terminus of the Te Araroa hiking trail.

==Māori mythology==
According to mythology, the spirits of the dead travel to Cape Reinga on their journey to the afterlife to leap off the headland and climb the roots of the 800-year-old pōhutukawa tree and descend to the underworld to return to their traditional homeland of Hawaiki, using the &quot;Te Ara Wairua&quot;, the &#x27;Spirits&#x27; pathway&#x27;. At Cape Reinga they depart the mainland. They turn briefly at the Three Kings Islands for one last look back towards the land, then continue on their journey.

A spring in the hillside, &quot;Te Waiora-a-Tāne&quot; (the &#x27;Living waters of Tāne&#x27;), also played an important role in Māori ceremonial burials, representing a spiritual cleansing of the spirits, with water of the same name used in burial rites all over New Zealand. This significance lasted until the local population mostly converted to Christianity, and the spring was capped with a reservoir, with little protest from the mostly converted population of the area. However, the spring soon disappeared and only reappeared at the bottom of the cliff, making the reservoir useless.

==Restoration ==
In 2007 protests by Māori and increased tourist numbers led the Department of Conservation to announce that the public carpark and toilet facilities, which intrude on traditionally sacred ground, would be moved further away from the cape and extended, at a cost of NZ$6.5 million (for details, see external links below). The road to the cape, one of the last stretches of State Highway 1, was sealed following three years of work and include extensive roadside revegetation with over 150,000 plants to prevent erosion. In March 2009, the works on the visitor facilities were completed.

==Climate==
Cape Reinga has a very mild oceanic climate (Cfb) with high precipitation and little temperature difference between the seasons.

==Lighthouse==
The lighthouse at Cape Reinga was built in 1941 and first lit during May of that year, replacing a lighthouse located on nearby Motuopao Island, which had been built 1879. In 1987, the lighthouse was fully automated and the lighthouse keepers were withdrawn. The previous 1000 watt light and its revolving Fresnel lens have since been replaced with a tiny 50 watt flashing beacon, lodged in their place in the huge lantern.

<text>The 76th Academy Awards ceremony, presented by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), honored the best films of 2003 and took place on February 29, 2004, at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles. During the ceremony, AMPAS presented Academy Awards (commonly referred to as Oscars) in 24 categories. The ceremony, televised in the United States by ABC, was produced by Joe Roth and was directed by Louis J. Horvitz. Actor Billy Crystal hosted for the eighth time. He first presided over the 62nd ceremony held in 1990 and had last hosted the 72nd ceremony held in 2000. Two weeks earlier in a ceremony at The Ritz-Carlton Huntington Hotel &amp; Spa in Pasadena, California held on February 14, the Academy Awards for Technical Achievement were presented by host Jennifer Garner.

&quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; won a record-tying eleven awards including Best Director for Peter Jackson and Best Picture. Other winners included &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World&quot; and &quot;Mystic River&quot; with two awards and &quot;The Barbarian Invasions&quot;, &quot;Chernobyl Heart&quot;, &quot;Cold Mountain&quot;, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, &quot;The Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara&quot;, &quot;Harvie Krumpet&quot;, &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;, &quot;Monster&quot;, and &quot;Two Soldiers&quot; with one. The telecast garnered nearly 44 million viewers in the United States, making it the most-watched telecast in four years.

==Winners and nominees==
The nominees for the 76th Academy Awards were announced on January 27, 2004, at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills, California, by Frank Pierson, president of the Academy, and the actress Sigourney Weaver. &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; received the most nominations with eleven; &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World&quot; came in second with ten.

The winners were announced during the awards ceremony on February 29, 2004. With eleven awards, &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; is tied with &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot; as the most awarded films in Oscar history. Moreover, its clean sweep of its eleven nominations surpassed &quot;Gigi&quot; and &quot;The Last Emperor&quot;″s nine awards for the largest sweep for a single film in Oscar history. The film was also the tenth film to win Best Picture without any acting nominations. Best Director nominee Sofia Coppola became the first American woman and third woman overall to be nominated in that category. By virtue of her father, Francis Ford Coppola and her grandfather, Carmine&#x27;s previous wins, her victory in the Original Screenplay category made her the second third-generation Oscar winner in history. At age thirteen, Best Actress nominee Keisha Castle-Hughes became the youngest nominee in that category until being surpassed by Quvenzhané Wallis, who was nine at the time of her nomination, in 2013. With Sean Penn and Tim Robbins&#x27;s respective wins in the Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor categories, &quot;Mystic River&quot; became the fourth film to win both male acting awards.

==Ceremony information==

In light of the record low viewership from the preceding year&#x27;s ceremony, the Academy sought to make several changes and hire a new producer for the upcoming show. AMPAS announced that unlike previous years where the ceremony typically was held in either late March or early April, the festivities would be held in late February. AMPAS director of communications John Pavlik explained that the purpose of moving the telecast a month earlier was &quot;to bolster the ceremony&#x27;s sagging television ratings and protect the Oscar&#x27;s status as the nation&#x27;s pre-eminent awards event.&quot; Despite several Academy officials denying such reasons, some industry insiders speculated that the earlier Oscar date was also implemented to mitigate the intense campaigning and lobbying during Oscar season put forth by film studios. This marked the first time since the 14th ceremony that the awards were held outside the aforementioned time frame.

In August 2003, the Academy hired film producer Joe Roth to oversee production of the ceremony. The following month, Roth recruited veteran Oscar host Billy Crystal to emcee the awards gala for the eighth time. To stir interest surrounding the awards, Roth produced three trailers promoting the ceremony that each was set to different pop tunes (Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Hollywood&quot;, OutKast&#x27;s &quot;Hey Ya!&quot;, and Pink&#x27;s &quot;Get the Party Started&quot;). The trailers contained clips of previous ceremonies with slogans such as &quot;Expected the unexpected&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Oscar night&quot; occasionally flashing between scenes. These promotional spots were shown at movie theaters, on several cable channels, and at participating Blockbuster stores. The Academy also granted talk show host Oprah Winfrey unprecedented access to rehearsals and meetings as part of a month-long series on her eponymous talk show covering behind the scenes preparation of the telecast.

===MPAA ban on screeners===
In September 2003, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) initially banned distribution of screeners to awards groups, citing fears of piracy. Many independent film studios and prominent film directors objected to this decision charging that this would hurt smaller films for Oscar consideration since they heavily rely on screeners to lure Academy members&#x27; attention. The following month, AMPAS and the MPAA reached an agreement in which Academy members would receive the screeners on the condition that they keep them out of reach from people unaffiliated with AMPAS. In December 2003, a federal judge in New York overturned the ban citing that it violated federal antitrust laws.

===Box office performance of nominated films===
At the time of the nominations announcement on January 27, the combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees was $638 million with an average of $127 million per film. &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; was the highest earner among the Best Picture nominees with $338.3 million in domestic box office receipts. The film was followed by &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; ($120.2 million), &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World&quot; ($85.3 million), &quot;Mystic River&quot; ($59.1 million), and finally &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; ($34.8 million).

Of the top 50 grossing movies of the year, 45 nominations went to 10 films on the list. Only &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; (1st), &quot;The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King&quot; (2nd), &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; (3rd), &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; (16th), &quot;Something&#x27;s Gotta Give&quot; (21st), &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; (23rd), &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World&quot; (31st), &quot;Brother Bear&quot; (32nd) &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; (37th), and &quot;Mystic River&quot; (46th) were nominated for Best Picture, Best Animated Feature, or any of the directing, acting, or screenwriting.

===Tape delay implementation===
In light of the controversy surrounding the halftime show during Super Bowl XXXVIII, network ABC implemented a five-second tape delay to ensure that profanity and obscenity were not seen or heard. AMPAS president Frank Pierson protested this decision in a written statement, stating, &quot;Even a very brief tape-delay introduces a form of censorship into the broadcast—not direct governmental control, but it means that a network representative is in effect guessing at what a government might tolerate, which can be even worse.&quot; In response, producer Joe Roth reiterated that censorship would only be applied to profanity and not political speeches.

===Critical reviews===
The show received a mixed reception from media publications. &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; television critic Steve Johnson lamented that the show &quot;felt almost numbingly familiar and disappointingly genteel.&quot; He also criticized broadcaster ABC&#x27;s decision to implement the five-second tape delay. Tom Shales of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; quipped that the ceremony &quot;was about as entertaining as watching Jell-O congeal.&quot; He also added that the lack of surprises among the awards contributed to the dull atmosphere of the telecast. Columnist Tim Goodman of &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; bemoaned, &quot;The 76th annual Academy Awards dragged on without much drama or comedy, sucking the life out of the event even while it was doing justice to the masterpiece that is &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.&quot;

Other media outlets received the broadcast more positively. Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised Crystal&#x27;s hosting performance saying that he &quot;has located the perfect middle ground between Steve Martin&#x27;s adroit silliness and Whoopi Goldberg&#x27;s unapologetic hamminess.&quot; On the show itself, he said that it &quot;managed to do what Hollywood may not have: convince us that this was a great year for the movies.&quot; Film critic Andrew Sarris of &quot;The New York Observer&quot; wrote that the show was &quot;the funniest and least tedious in memory.&quot; He also extolled producer Joe Roth by concluding, &quot;As far as this old critic&#x27;s concerned, Mr. Roth, you did a fine job.&quot; &quot;USA Today&quot; critic Robert Bianco commented that despite the lack of suspense due to the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; sweep of the awards &quot;Crystal was able to lace funny bits throughout the evening.&quot; He further lauded the show as &quot;more glamorous and upbeat than last year&#x27;s war-muted event, and decently paced.&quot;

===Ratings and reception===
The American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 43.56 million people over its length, which was a 26% increase from the previous year&#x27;s ceremony. An estimated 73.89 million total viewers watched all or part of the awards. The show also earned higher Nielsen ratings compared to the previous ceremony with 26.68% of households watching over a 41.84 share. In addition, it garnered a higher 1849 demo rating with a 15.48 rating over a 38.79 share among viewers in that demographic. It was the highest viewership for an Academy Award telecast since the 72nd ceremony held in 2000.

In July 2004, the ceremony presentation received nine nominations at the 56th Primetime Emmys. Two months later, the ceremony won one of those nominations for Louis J. Horvitz&#x27;s direction of the telecast.

==&quot;In Memoriam&quot;==
The annual &quot;In Memoriam&quot; tribute was presented by Academy President Frank Pierson. The montage featured an excerpt of &quot;The Love of the Princess&quot; from &quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot;, composed by Miklós Rózsa (&quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, &quot;Spellbound&quot;, &quot;Quo Vadis&quot;, &quot;King of Kings&quot;, &quot;El Cid&quot;).

<text>Elbert Green Hubbard (June 19, 1856 – May 7, 1915) was an American writer, publisher, artist, and philosopher. Raised in Hudson, Illinois, he had early success as a traveling salesman for the Larkin Soap Company. Hubbard is known best as the founder of the Roycroft artisan community in East Aurora, New York, an influential exponent of the Arts and Crafts movement.

Among Hubbard&#x27;s many publications were the fourteen-volume work &quot;Little Journeys to the Homes of the Great&quot; and the short publication &quot;A Message to Garcia&quot;. He and his second wife, Alice Moore Hubbard, died aboard the RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot; when it was torpedoed and sunk by German submarine SM &quot;U-20&quot; off the coast of Ireland on May 7, 1915.

==Early life==
Hubbard was born in Bloomington, Illinois, to Silas Hubbard and Juliana Frances Read on June 19, 1856. In the autumn of 1855, his parents had relocated to Bloomington from Buffalo, New York, where his father had a medical practice. Finding it difficult to settle in Bloomington—mainly due to the presence of several already established doctors—Silas moved his family to Hudson, Illinois, the next year. Nicknamed &quot;Bertie&quot; by his family, Elbert had two older siblings: Charlie, who was largely bed-ridden after a fall when he was young, and Hannah Frances, nicknamed &quot;Frank&quot; like her mother. Charlie died at the age of nine, when Elbert was three-and-a-half years old. Elbert also had three younger sisters who were named Mary, Anna Miranda, and Honor.

The Hubbard children attended the local public school, a small building with two rooms that overlooked a graveyard. Thirty years later, Elbert described his schooling days as &quot;splendid&quot; and &quot;tinged with no trace of blue... I had no ambitions then—I was sure that some day I could spell down the school, propound a problem in fractions that would puzzle the teacher, and play checkers in a way that would cause my name to be known throughout the entire township.&quot; Mary would remember her older brother&#x27;s role as a school troublemaker, noting that he &quot;annoyed his teachers... occasionally by roaring inappropriately when his too-responsive sense of humor was tickled.&quot;

Elbert&#x27;s first business venture was selling Larkin soap products, a career which eventually brought him to Buffalo, New York. His innovations for Larkin included premiums and &quot;leave on trial&quot;.

==Roycroft==


His best-known work came after he founded Roycroft, an Arts and Crafts community in East Aurora, New York, in 1895. This grew from his private press which he had initiated in collaboration with his first wife Bertha Crawford Hubbard, the Roycroft Press, inspired by William Morris&#x27; Kelmscott Press. Although called the &quot;Roycroft Press&quot; by latter-day collectors and print historians, the organization called itself &quot;The Roycrofters&quot; and &quot;The Roycroft Shops&quot;.

Hubbard edited and published two magazines, &quot;The Philistine—A Periodical of Protest&quot; and &quot;The FRA--A Journal of Affirmation&quot;. &quot;The Philistine&quot; was bound in brown butcher paper and featuring largely satire and whimsy. (Hubbard himself quipped that the cover was butcher paper because: &quot;There is meat inside.&quot;) The Roycrofters produced handsome, if sometimes eccentric, books printed on handmade paper, and operated a fine bindery, a furniture shop, and shops producing modeled leather and hammered copper goods. They were a leading producer of Mission style products.

Hubbard&#x27;s second wife, Alice Moore Hubbard, was a graduate of the New Thought-oriented Emerson College of Oratory in Boston and a noted suffragist. The Roycroft Shops became a site for meetings and conventions of radicals, freethinkers, reformers, and suffragists. Hubbard became a popular lecturer, and his homespun philosophy evolved from a loose William Morris-inspired socialism to an ardent defense of free enterprise and American know-how. Hubbard was mocked in the Socialist press for &quot;selling out&quot;. He replied that he had not given up any ideal of his, but had simply lost faith in Socialism as a means of realizing them.

An example of his trenchant critical style may be found in his saying that prison is, &quot;An example of a Socialist&#x27;s Paradise, where equality prevails, everything is supplied and competition is eliminated.&quot;

In 1908, Hubbard was the main speaker at the annual meeting of The Society in Dedham for Apprehending Horse Thieves. Before he died, Hubbard planned to write a story about Felix Flying Hawk, the only son of Chief Flying Hawk. Hubbard had learned about Flying Hawk during 1915 from Major Israel McCreight.

In 1912, the passenger liner &quot;RMS Titanic&quot; sank after hitting an iceberg. Hubbard subsequently wrote of the disaster, singling out the story of Ida Straus, who as a woman was supposed to be placed on a lifeboat in precedence to the men, but refused to board the boat, and leave her husband. Hubbard then added his own commentary: 
==Conviction and pardon==
At the beginning of World War I, Hubbard published a great deal of related commentary in &quot;The Philistine&quot; and became anxious to cross the ocean, report on the war and interview the Kaiser himself. However, Hubbard had pleaded guilty on January 11, 1913, in the court of U.S. District Court Judge John R. Hazel for violating Section 211 of the penal code. Hubbard was convicted on one count of circulating &quot;objectionable&quot; (or &quot;obscene&quot;) matter in violation of the postal laws.

Hubbard requested a presidential pardon from William Howard Taft, but the administration discarded the request as &quot;premature&quot;. When his application for a passport was denied in 1915, Hubbard went directly to the White House and pleaded with Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s personal secretary, Joseph P. Tumulty. At the time, the President was in the midst of a cabinet meeting, but Tumulty interrupted and, as a result, the Secretary of State (William Jennings Bryan) and Attorney General Thomas Gregory were also able to hear of Hubbard&#x27;s situation and need.

The pardon was found to be appropriate, and Hubbard&#x27;s clemency application process lasted exactly one day. Seventy-five percent of those petitioning for clemency during that fiscal year were not so fortunate; their requests were denied or adversely reported or no action was taken. On receiving his pardon, Hubbard obtained a passport and, on May 1, 1915, left with his wife on a voyage to Europe.

==Death==
A little more than three years after the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot;, the Hubbards boarded the in New York City. On May 7, 1915, while at sea 11 miles (18 km) off the Old Head of Kinsale, Ireland, the ship was hit by a single torpedo and sunk by the German U-boat . His end seems to have followed the pattern he had admired in Mrs. Straus. In a letter to Elbert Hubbard II dated March 12, 1916, Ernest C. Cowper, a survivor of this event, wrote:

The Roycroft Shops, managed by Hubbard&#x27;s son, Elbert Hubbard II, operated until 1938.

== Personal life ==
Hubbard described himself as an anarchist and a socialist. He believed in social, economic, domestic, political, mental and spiritual freedom. In &quot;A Message to Garcia and Thirteen Other Things&quot; (1901), Hubbard explained his &quot;Credo&quot; by writing &quot;I believe John Ruskin, William Morris, Henry Thoreau, Walt Whitman and Leo Tolstoy to be Prophets of God, and they should rank in mental reach and spiritual insight with Elijah, Hosea, Ezekiel and Isaiah.&quot;

Hubbard wrote a critique of war, law and government in the booklet &quot;Jesus Was An Anarchist&quot; (1910). Originally published as &quot;The Better Part&quot; in &quot;A Message to Garcia and Thirteen Other Things&quot;, the essay was described by Ernest Howard Crosby as &quot;The best thing Elbert ever wrote.&quot;

Another book which was written by Hubbard is titled &quot;Health and Wealth&quot;. It was published in 1908 and includes many short truisms.

== Legacy ==

Contributors to a 360-page book published by Roycrofters and titled &quot;In Memoriam: Elbert and Alice Hubbard&quot; included such celebrities as meat-packing magnate J. Ogden Armour, business theorist and Babson College founder Roger Babson, botanist and horticulturalist Luther Burbank, seed-company founder W. Atlee Burpee, ketchup magnate Henry J. Heinz, National Park Service founder Franklin Knight Lane, success writer Orison Swett Marden, inventor of the modern comic strip Richard F. Outcault, poet James Whitcomb Riley, Nobel Peace Prize recipient Elihu Root, evangelist Billy Sunday, intellectual Booker T. Washington, and poet Ella Wheeler Wilcox.

Hubbard&#x27;s &quot;Message to Garcia&quot; essay was adapted into two movies: the 1916 silent movie &quot;A Message to Garcia&quot; and the 1936 movie &quot;A Message to Garcia&quot;.

Mack Bolan, the main character of Don Pendleton&#x27;s fiction series &quot;The Executioner&quot;, frequently cites as inspiration a Hubbard quote, &quot;God will not look you over for medals, diplomas, or degrees – but for scars.&quot;

The phrase &quot;The graveyards are full of indispensable men&quot; may have originated with Hubbard.

A quote of Hubbard&#x27;s from his biography of American automotive developer John North Willys, &quot;Do nothing, say nothing, and be nothing, and you&#x27;ll never be criticized&quot;, is often misattributed to Aristotle.

Other quotes include 
* Do not take life too seriously. You will never get out of it alive.
* In order to have friends, you must first be one.
* Never explain - your friends do not need it and your enemies will not believe you anyway.

<text>Henry Charles Carey (December 15, 1793 – October 13, 1879) was an American publisher, political economist, and politician from Pennsylvania. He was the leading 19th-century economist of the American School and a chief economic adviser to U.S. President Abraham Lincoln and Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase during the American Civil War.

Carey&#x27;s central work is &quot;The Harmony of Interests: Agricultural, Manufacturing, and Commercial&quot; (1851), which criticizes the system of &quot;laissez faire&quot; capitalism and free trade expounded by Thomas Malthus and David Ricardo in favor of the American System of developmentalism through the use of tariff protection and state intervention to encourage national self-sufficiency and unity. Carey was also a critic of the practice of slavery from an economic perspective. His work on protective tariffs was largely influential on the early Republican Party and United States trade policy through the start of the 20th century, and his views on banking and monetary policy were adopted by the Lincoln administration in its issuance of paper fiat currency as legal tender.

== Biography ==
===Early life===
Carey was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on December 15, 1793.
His father, Mathew Carey (1760–1839), was a native of Ireland and an influential economist, political reformer, editor, and publisher whose patrons included Benjamin Franklin and the Marquis de Lafayette. He founded a publishing firm, which soon became among the leading firms in Philadelphia and the young United States. Among his many writings was &quot;Essays on Political Economy&quot; (1822), one of the earliest American treatises favoring Alexander Hamilton&#x27;s idea of protection and its use in the promotion of American industry.

Carey began working at his father&#x27;s firm at only twelve years old. At the firm, Carey read most of the books selected for publication, substituting for a formal college education. In 1812, he traveled to Raleigh, North Carolina as part of his business for the firm. He was elevated to partner alongside his father in 1814.

In 1819, he married Martha &quot;Patty&quot; Leslie, the sister of Charles Robert Leslie and Eliza Leslie. They adopted one daughter.

===Publisher===
In 1821, Carey became the leading partner at Carey &amp; Lea, at the time the largest publishing house in the United States. He took little formal interest in economics, tacitly accepting the market doctrines of Jean-Baptiste Say and of his Philadelphia associates, Condy Raguet, Nicholas Biddle, and Charles Pettit McIlvaine who were active believers in free trade doctrine.

In 1824, Carey established the common method of trade sales, a medium of exchange between booksellers, which lasted through his life.

===Economist===
In 1835, Carey read the published 1829–30 lectures of Nassau William Senior titled &quot;The Rate of Wages&quot; and &quot;The Cost of Obtaining Money&quot; and published his refutation &quot;Essay on the Rate of Wages, with an Examination of the Differences in the Condition of the Laboring Population throughout the World&quot;. Carey agreed with Senior&#x27;s principles and main propositions but criticized the Senior&#x27;s failure to adjust for real wage rates. He remained an advocate of free trade in the essay, writing that &quot;Laissez nous faire is the true doctrine. . . it is now so fully understood that the true policy of the United States is freedom of trade and action, that there will be every day less disposition to interfere with it.&quot; Nevertheless, his intensely nationalist tone conflicted with economic orthodoxy; Carey identified the purpose of political economy as the promotion of the happiness of nations and the application of national labor for the comfort of workers.

The same year that &quot;Essay on the Rate of Wages&quot; was published, Carey retired from active business with a fortune and devoted his time to economics and related work. He began work on a text, &quot;The Harmony of Nature&quot;, which he did not feel adequate for wider publication but which became central to his later thinking. Setting this work aside, he began &quot;Principles of Political Economy&quot; in 1837, an expansion of his refutation of Senior. He completed the three-volume work in 1840. This work was largely adapted by the French economist Frédéric Bastiat in his own &quot;Harmonie Economiques&quot; in 1849, with some later accusing Bastiat of plagiarism. The first volume explained Carey&#x27;s labor theory of value. Its second volume, a comparative study of credit systems in France, Great Britain, and the United States, reads as a defense of the American free banking system, particularly as practiced in New England, in the wake of the Panic of 1837. It was cited favorably by John Stuart Mill in defense of his own arguments for a similar system in Britain. Carey continued to ground his thinking in standard &quot;laissez faire&quot; doctrine, writing that &quot;Governments have arrogated to themselves the task of regulating the currency, and the natural effect is that nothing is less regular.&quot; He would soon thereafter abandon the doctrine.

====Rejection of free trade====
Following the Panic of 1837 and the success of the protectionist Tariff of 1842, Carey became an open critic of free trade.

Carey&#x27;s newfound skepticism was based on his empirical observation of tariff history and his belief that some economic law must exist to explain prosperity under protection and bankruptcy under free trade. By Carey&#x27;s own account, he initially expected the 1842 tariff would prolong the recession; when it did not, he sought an explanation and became convinced &quot;as with a flash of lightning, that the whole Ricardo-Malthusian system is an error and that with it must fall the system of British free trade.&quot; Subsequent scholars have challenged Carey&#x27;s claim of a sudden change of heart by pointing to his earlier opposition to the English occupations of Ireland and India and his support for Friedrich List and the German Zollverein. He may have also been influenced by his own personal experience; between 1837 and 1840, he invested a portion of his publishing wealth in a paper mill that became completely bankrupt. By the end of 1843, Carey was engaged in a public debate with former Vice President John C. Calhoun, a leading advocate for tariff reduction. In 1845, in a pamphlet entitled &quot;Commercial Associations in France and England,&quot; Carey began to reject wholesale the &quot;British&quot; economics of Thomas Malthus and David Ricardo altogether and sought to develop a critique of their underlying assumptions. At the same time in England, the Manchester school of liberal capitalism reached the apex of its influence with the repeal of the Corn Laws.

Over the course of ninety days in 1848, Carey expanded on this view by writing &quot;Past, Present, and Future&quot;, which he said was &quot;designed to demonstrate the existence of a simple and beautiful law of nature, governing man in all his efforts for the maintenance and improvement of his condition... which, nevertheless, has hitherto remained unnoticed.&quot; The work argued in favor of a marriage of industry with capital and the necessity of maintaining domestic markets to promote prosperity; it was met with derision from Manchester school economists. The same year, while living in Burlington, New Jersey, Carey founded &quot;The Plough, the Loom, and the Anvil&quot;, a periodical journal of economic development, with John Stuart Skinner serving as its publisher. Selections of Carey&#x27;s writings in the journal were compiled into his next work, &quot;The Harmony of Interests.&quot;

==== Critique of slavery ====
Carey was a long-time opponent of American slavery, criticizing it as an economic albatross.

In 1853, prompted by the popularity of &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, Carey wrote and published &quot;The Slave Trade, Domestic and Foreign: Why it Exists and How It May Be Extinguished&quot;. The tract was partly written as an accusation of hypocrisy against the English. &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; had been particularly popular among abolitionists in England, who cited it to contrast English liberty to American slavery; Carey sought to expose the English system of pauperism and colonialism as an equally severe or worse form of bondage, introducing famine, exile, and pestilence to its subjects in addition to its restraint on liberty. Nevertheless, &quot;The Slave Trade&quot; is primarily a criticism of the Southern system of chattel slavery on moral and economic grounds.
===New York Tribune===
From 1849–57, Carey was a leading editorialist on political economy at Horace Greeley&#x27;s &quot;New York Daily Tribune&quot;.

Beginning in 1852, Karl Marx also served as European correspondent for the &quot;Tribune&quot;. Marx privately referred to Carey as &quot;the only American economist of importance,&quot; but was highly critical of Carey&#x27;s views as obstructive of communist revolution. Marx believed himself to be engaged in a &quot;hidden warfare&quot; against Carey through his own work for the &quot;Tribune&quot;. Even after both had left the &quot;Tribune&quot;, Marx remained a critic of Carey for the remainder of his life. In a 1890 study of Carey&#x27;s thought, Charles Herbert Levermore suggested that Carey&#x27;s criticisms of David Ricardo and Thomas Malthus may have been a &quot;prophetic vision of the use that Karl Marx and the socialists would make of [their work].&quot;

While at the &quot;Tribune&quot;, Carey successfully pressed for an open editorial position in support of the Russian Empire in the Crimean War against Great Britain and France, despite the Russian institution of serfdom. This stance was adopted by much of the Northern press and has been partially credited for influencing Russia&#x27;s reciprocal support of the Union during the American Civil War and the opposition of Great Britain and France.

Carey left the &quot;Tribune&quot; in 1857, around the same time Greeley came out in support of a reduction in tariffs. Greeley would later run for President in 1872 on an anti-tariff platform. After leaving the &quot;Tribune&quot;, Carey took two tours of Europe, where he personally met with John Stuart Mill, Count Cavour, Alexander Humboldt, Justus von Liebig, Michel Chevalier, and other leading men. He maintained correspondence with many of his European acquaintances and hosted them as guests when they visited Philadelphia.

===Influence on Republican Party===
Carey was hugely influential in shaping the nationalist and protectionist economic policy of the early Republican Party, through his roles as a public intellectual, party operative, and advisor to numerous figures. During the American Civil War, Carey was a trusted adviser to both President Abraham Lincoln and Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase. He directly assisted in the drafting of Republican tariff legislation from 1857 through the Civil War, and his thought also influenced President Lincoln&#x27;s banking and finance policy through the passage of the National Bank Act of 1863 and subsequent Treasury policy.

====Tariff of 1857====

When the Republican Party was founded in popular reaction against the Kansas-Nebraska Act and the extension of slavery, it had no broad economic platform. Attempts to formulate one were met with disapproval, given the possibility they would detract from its anti-slavery mission or divide its supporters. Carey joined the new party in 1856, while still working at the &quot;Tribune&quot;. He received three votes for Vice President at the 1856 Republican National Convention and served as a fundraiser, soliciting Philadelphia manufacturers for donations without assigning his beliefs to the party as a whole. Immediately after the election, which ended in defeat, Charles A. Dana asked Carey for his support in broadening the party&#x27;s base, &quot;a principle alone not being sufficient.&quot; Carey proposed centering the 1860 platform on his system of economic nationalism built around the protective tariff. When Dana declined to &quot;build up a new Protection party,&quot; Carey set out on a crusade for a coherent economic policy.

Through personal friendship with Lewis D. Campbell, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and James Hepburn Campbell, Carey heavily influenced the committee&#x27;s report on tariffs, which was a vigorous defense of protection quoting directly from &quot;Harmony of Interests&quot;. The committee&#x27;s bill was opposed by some Republicans, including future Treasury Secretary John Sherman and Benjamin Stanton, who criticized it as &quot;essentially a manufacturers&#x27; bill... [which] would not bear the test of scrutiny.&quot; The ensuing House debate mostly dealt with slavery; one of the few Representatives to focus on protection was Justin Smith Morrill of Vermont, who would become the leading proponent of Carey&#x27;s theories during the American Civil War. The tariff rates were reduced in the Democratic Senate, and the compromise bill passed with Republican support, over objections by Morrill and James Campbell.

====Panic of 1857 and 1860 election====
After the United States entered another economic recession, Republicans began to take a new interest in economic policy. Revived calls for protective tariffs enhanced Carey&#x27;s standing. Senator Simon Cameron was elevated as Pennsylvania&#x27;s candidate for President on a protectionist platform, and David Wilmot agreed to stand for Pennsylvania&#x27;s other Senate seat on the same platform. Cameron&#x27;s campaign was premised on a proposition that no candidate could win without Pennsylvania, and no candidate could win Pennsylvania without supporting protection.

As Carey&#x27;s influence in the party grew, he began to draw connections between slavery and international trade. In a public debate of letters with William Cullen Bryant on the causes of the Panic, its relationship to slavery, and the Republican response, Carey argued that, &quot;In [Pennsylvania and New] Jersey, the tariff is the one and almost the only question.&quot; He positioned slavery as one phase of an international economic system. &quot;Slavery,&quot; he argued, &quot;must stand or fall with free trade.&quot; Protection would bring about abolition through industrialization, an end to the plantation economy and cotton exports, and the establishment of a Southern middle class.

By 1860, Republicans outside of Pennsylvania remained reluctant to embrace protection. In most Western states, the party was divided, and Senator Henry Wilson, who previously pledged New England&#x27;s support, urged Carey to be cautious. Republicans in the United States House, led by Justin S. Morrill and James H. Campbell, passed a protective tariff at Carey&#x27;s urging, though it languished in the Senate into winter.

The platform ultimately declared, &quot;while providing revenue for the support of the general government by duties upon imports, sound policy requires such an adjustment as to encourage the development of the industrial interests of the whole country.&quot; Biographer George Winston Smith claimed Carey personally drafted the plank through Pennsylvania judge William Jessup, the platform chair, while Gustave Koerner later claimed it was developed at the behest of Horace Greeley to avoid alienating free trade proponents. Regardless, Republicans in Pennsylvania, led by Carey, made protection the central issue of the campaign and carried the state in the fall elections. Though Abraham Lincoln, the Republican President-elect and former Whig, publicly expressed ignorance on tariffs and pledged to &quot;endeavor to comprehend it more fully,&quot; Lincoln historian Reinhard H. Luthin claims that by the time of his election, Lincoln had almost certainly read Carey&#x27;s work on the subject.
====Advisor to Lincoln and Chase====

After his election, Abraham Lincoln sought Carey&#x27;s advice on whether he should nominate Simon Cameron for Secretary of the Treasury. Lincoln initially sought Carey out for his expertise on Pennsylvania politics and Cameron&#x27;s reputation for corruption, which Carey confirmed despite their prior alliance. Lincoln soon began to consult with Carey on tariff policy. At the same time, Carey backed Lincoln&#x27;s alternative for Treasury, Salmon P. Chase. Though Chase did not respond to Carey&#x27;s letters and had a background as a supporter of free trade, Carey preferred to persuade Chase than trust Cameron. Via a sustained correspondence through the summer of 1861, Chase and Lincoln consulted Carey on the tariff, domestic taxation, and financial matters generally. By July, Morrill reported to Carey that although &quot;[Chase&#x27;s] Philosophy is Free trade or ad valorems,&quot; he was &quot;willing to yield&quot; on tariff policy amid the growing cost of the American Civil War. &quot;I think Chase, considering his antecedents, should receive generous treatment by all our friends,&quot; Morrill wrote. &quot;He is doing the best he can practically.&quot; Carey also used his influence to secure key appointments in the Treasury Department for protectionists, including his trusted adviser Dr. William Elder as the lead tariff architect in the administration.

In the winter of 186061 amid Southern secession, Morrill and Campbell pressed tariff protection in the lame duck Congress, and Carey personally went to Washington to direct lobbying efforts. John Sherman, now serving as Chair of Ways and Means, was persuaded to the cause. With most free trade advocates leaving Congress as the result of secession, the bill passed with some amendments in the session&#x27;s final days. George W. Scranton of Pennsylvania also distributed Carey&#x27;s writings to all members-elect in the incoming Congress; Carey continued to influence tariff policy in Congress throughout the war, and his views remained dominant in the party long after.

====National Banking Act and greenbacks====

Carey&#x27;s theories also influenced the National Banking Act of 1863 and the provision of greenbacks and secured bank notes.

In March 1865, Carey published a series of letters written to the Speaker of the House Schuyler Colfax during the Civil War, entitled &quot;The Way to Outdo England Without Fighting Her&quot;. In these letters, Carey advocated the continuance of the greenback system to ensure economic sovereignty. Carey also suggested raising the reserve requirements on private banks up to 50%.

After the war, Carey publicly opposed Secretary Hugh McCulloch&#x27;s proposal to contract the money supply. In a series of public letters, he accused Wall Street banks of artificially inflating the cost of capital and predicted that a swift contraction would lead to chaos, economic paralysis, and political rebellion, particularly among farmers in the West whose mortgage rates would increase. He also opposed the sale of United States bonds overseas, arguing that specie payments could not be resumed until the national debt was held by America creditors, and that payment should be made in silver as well as gold.

===Later work and death===
In autumn 1872, Carey was a delegate to the convention organized to write a new Pennsylvania Constitution. His commentary during the convention on banking, usury, corporations, and railroads were later published in pamphlet form.

He died at his home in Philadelphia on October 13, 1879.

== Views ==
Carey&#x27;s views are generally described as nationalist and have been described more particularly as associationist and collectivist for his opposition to economic restraints without distinction between private and state monopoly. Carey argued that ultimately, a causal chain could be drawn through &quot;separation of [men], centralization of the mass, subjection of the many to the powerful few, slavery, stagnation, [and] decrease of real civilization.&quot; Instead, the chain should be reversed at its start with &quot;association, complexity of interests, decentralization, [and] harmonious increase of power.&quot;

Carey&#x27;s rejection of orthodox English economic theory was borne of a belief that the state, as the coordinating power in society, must intervene to prevent private advantage from working public mischief. Carey argued for developmentalism, positing that state intervention was necessary to remove &quot;the obstacles to the progress of younger communities created by the action of older and wealthier nations.&quot;

Carey&#x27;s philosophy is condensed and summarized in his work &quot;The Principles of Social Science&quot;, which frames social science and political economy from the perspective of the economic development of the &quot;citizen&quot;, that is, one belonging to and responsible to a social community. In his &quot;Principles of Social Science&quot;, Carey appealed to natural law to argue life must be intentionally oriented toward happiness and peace, and suffering is the result of willful ignorance of natural law. One way in which suffering is brought about is by obscuring the &quot;real&quot; man in favor of the &quot;politico-economical man,&quot; a two-dimensional monster who &quot;can be made to work, must be fed, and will procreate.&quot; Carey therefore defined social science as &quot;the science of laws which govern man in his efforts to secure for himself the highest individuality and the greatest power of association with his fellow men.&quot; Political economy is thus the subset of social science that considers the measures that give these natural laws their fullest effect.

===Economic nationalism and trade===

A common theme in Carey&#x27;s writing is the limits of international economic association and the necessary of national association, and his best-known policy position was his defense of protective tariffs. He was described by an admirer as &quot;rigid, devoted, and uncompromising&quot; on the issue, and as &quot;a Cato hammering on his one theme.&quot; Critics accused Carey of Anglophobia for his hostility to the system of free trade under the British Empire and British theories of political economy in general.

Consistent with the law of comparative advantage, Carey argued global centralization required an international division of labor by which each nation developed only those resources in which it possessed a natural advantage. This system placed despotic power in the hands of those controlling the mediums of exchange; the places these middlemen congregated became the global marketplace. Carey argued this theory was the basis for the British policy of imperialism and free trade, by which the Empire intended to establish a global monopoly on both manufacturing and shipping centered on London, while other nations were resigned to exporting raw materials. To check centralization, Carey thus emphasized the need for human association; in Carey&#x27;s writing, the natural form of association was the nation, an association of citizens. He suggested that the United States and other nations should interpose protective tariffs between themselves and London, increasing the cost of their raw materials, fostering domestic manufacturing, and depriving British manufacturers of a monopoly on finished goods. This would enable the establishment of a middle class, the abolition of chattel slavery, and the encouragement of patriotic feeling.

Carey emphasized that the final result of industrialization would be the establishment of &quot;&quot;perfect&quot; free trade&quot; between developed nations, whose range of production would be limited only by absolute natural barriers. His utopian vision was laid out in writing:

&quot;Of the advantage of perfect free trade there can be no doubt. What is good between the states ought to be good the world over. But free trade can be successfully administered only after an apprenticeship of protection. Strictly speaking, taxation should all be direct. Tariff for revenue should not exist. Interference with trade is excusable only on ground of self-protection. A disturbing force of prodigious power pre- vents the loom and spindle from taking and keeping their proper places by the plow and harrow. When the protective regime has counteracted the elements of foreign opposition, obstacles to free trade will disappear and the tariff will pass out of existence. Wars will cease; for no chief magistrate will dare to recommend an increase of direct taxation.&quot;

Carey further contrasted this theory of &quot;perfect&quot; free trade to the English system in a letter to Henry Wilson: &quot;Free trade, as ultimated in England, is the most debased ignorance, the most abhorrent cruelty, the most disgusting vice and the most heart-breaking misery that can be seen in any country calling itself civilized and Christian.&quot; Despite this stated utopian view, Carey never backed down from his support for high tariffs within his lifetime, believing that the United States had not reached complete economic development.

In addition to his long advocacy for protectionism to obstruct international trade, Carey also opposed the institution of an international copyright law, which he argued would dissolve national boundaries and lead to the formation of publishing monopolies. This would in turn lead to a decline in the quality of literary writing, as the best authors did not write for wide audiences and would derive no benefit from a global market.

===Monetary and banking theory===
As a corollary to his system of protection, Carey developed a theory of monetary sovereignty built on fiat currency. Carey&#x27;s monetary views were the basis for the National Banking Act of 1863 and issuance of greenbacks and later popularly associated with the Greenback Party.

He criticized the view of David Hume, Adam Smith, and John Stuart Mill that currency served only as a symbol of wealth and was the least productive part of a nation&#x27;s capital. Instead, he argued nations should increase monetary reserves by any means; credit money was useful and necessary to the establishment of stable prices and credit growth. National sovereignty would be preserved through a domestic, non-exportable currency to inure domestic markets against fluctuations in the value of precious metals, while the gold dollar should serve as the unit of international exchange. Carey opposed monetary contraction, arguing that increasing business development demanded an increasing currency supply. He accused the financial industry of artificially inflating interest rates and predicted that contraction would lead to political and economic chaos. He was also an early advocate of bimetallism and the remonetization of silver in order to secure a stable national currency, fearing that gold reserves in the United States were too small. His views on these issues were later incorporate in the platform of the Greenback Party, with which he was popularly associated, and the populist movement.

In the realm of private banking, Carey was a lifelong advocate of free banking and believed banks were essential as springs of local business life; he discouraged the general attacks on private banking institutions made by some other &quot;green-backers.&quot;
===Criticism of Ricardo and Malthus===

In &quot;Principles of Social Science&quot;, Carey delivers a lengthy rebuke of David Ricardo and Thomas Malthus. He sharply distinguishes value, &quot;man&#x27;s power to command the always gratuitous services of nature,&quot; from utility, the measure of man&#x27;s power over nature. Value is limited by reproduction and declines with the increase of combination among men, while utility grows with the extension of human association. Because value is constantly decreasing, Carey posits the power and wealth of the laborer will tend to increase both absolutely and relative to that of capital as population and association increase; he calls this &quot;the most beautiful of all the laws recorded in the book of science. As rents continually diminish, the farmer or laborer finds it easier to make his living. Further, Carey believed that the history of human civilization demonstrated that human progress was from poorer to richer soils, while Ricardo&#x27;s law of comparative advantage is dependent on the opposite assumption. Charles Herbert Levermore compares Carey&#x27;s reasoning to that of Pierre Paul Leroy-Beaulieu a half century later.

Malthus, Carey says, &quot;teaches that a monopoly of the land is in accordance with a law of nature. Admiring morality, he promotes profligacy by encouraging celibacy. ... Desirous to uplift the people, he tells the landowner and the laborer that the loss of the one is the gain of the other. His book is the true manual of the demagogue, seeking power by means of agrarianism, war and plunder.&quot; Carey also criticizes Malthus for failing to prove his ratios of production and consumption, given variation in the growth cycle of plants and the diets of humans over time, and for contradicting the Christian belief of the goodness of God, who would be malicious to create a world which could not sustain the proliferation of humanity. Carey also cites Herbert Spencer to argue &quot;the degree of fertility varies inversely [against the development of] the nervous system,&quot; which suggests that resource scarcity is a greater restraint in less developed societies and population is self-regulative.

Upon his death, Carey&#x27;s library was donated to the University of Pennsylvania.

Carey&#x27;s economic theories not only impacted Western and American economic thought but also resonated with intellectuals in other parts of the world. For instance, Gebrehiwot Baykedagn, an Ethiopian economist and reformer, was influenced by Carey&#x27;s principles. Baykedagn applied Carey&#x27;s ideas on protectionism and national economic self-sufficiency to the context of Ethiopia, advocating for policies that would modernize and strengthen the country&#x27;s economy.

A portrait of Carey painted by his brother-in-law Charles Robert Leslie is housed by the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.

Carey elected to prestigious societies during his lifetime:
* Elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1833
* Elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1863
* Elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1868

<text>The Douglas C-124 Globemaster II, nicknamed &quot;Old Shaky&quot;, is an American heavy-lift cargo aircraft built by the Douglas Aircraft Company in Long Beach, California.

The C-124 was the primary heavy-lift transport for United States Air Force (USAF) Military Air Transport Service (MATS) during the 1950s and early 1960s, until the Lockheed C-141 Starlifter entered service. It served in MATS, later Military Airlift Command (MAC), and units of the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard until retired in 1974.

==Design and development==
Douglas Aircraft developed the C-124 from 1947 to 1949, from a prototype they created from a World War II–design Douglas C-74 Globemaster, and based on lessons learned during the Berlin Airlift. The aircraft was powered by four, large Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major piston engines producing each. The C-124&#x27;s design featured two, large, clamshell doors and a hydraulically actuated ramp in the nose, as well as a cargo elevator under the aft fuselage. The C-124 was capable of carrying of cargo, and the cargo bay featured two overhead hoists, each capable of lifting . As a cargo hauler, it could carry tanks, guns, trucks, and other heavy equipment, while in its passenger-carrying role, it could carry 200 fully equipped troops on its double decks or 127 litter patients and their nurses. It was the only aircraft of its time capable of transporting fully assembled heavy equipment such as tanks and bulldozers.

The C-124 first flew on 27 November 1949, with the C-124A being delivered from May 1950. The C-124C was next, featuring more powerful engines, and an APS-42 weather radar fitted in a &quot;thimble&quot;-like structure on the nose. Wingtip-mounted combustion heaters were added to heat the cabin, and enable wing and tail surface deicing. The C-124As were later equipped with these improvements.

One C-124C, 52-1069, c/n 43978, was used as a JC-124C, for testing the Pratt &amp; Whitney XT57 (PT5) turboprop, which was installed in the nose.

==Operational history==

First deliveries of the 448 production aircraft began in May 1950 and continued until 1955. The C-124 was operational during the Korean War, and was also used to assist supply operations for Operation Deep Freeze in Antarctica. They performed heavy-lift cargo operations for the U.S. military worldwide, including flights to Southeast Asia, Africa, and elsewhere. From 1959 to 1961, they transported Thor missiles across the Atlantic to England. The C-124 was also used extensively during the Vietnam War transporting materiel from the U.S. to Vietnam. Until the C-5A became operational, the C-124 and its sister C-133 Cargomaster were the only aircraft available that could transport very large loads.

The USAF&#x27;s Strategic Air Command (SAC) was the initial operator of the C-124 Globemaster, with 50 in service from 1950 through 1962. Four squadrons operated the type, consisting of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Strategic Support Squadrons. Their primary duty was to transport nuclear weapons between air bases and to provide airlift of SAC personnel and equipment during exercises and overseas deployments.

The Military Air Transport Service (MATS) was the primary operator until January 1966, when the organization was retitled Military Airlift Command (MAC). Within a few years following the formation of MAC, the last remaining examples of the C-124 were transferred to the Air Force Reserve (AFRES) and the Air National Guard (ANG), said transfers being complete by 1970. The first ANG unit to receive the C-124C, the 165th Tactical Airlift Group (now known as the 165th Airlift Wing) of the Georgia Air National Guard, was the last Air Force unit to retire their aircraft (AF serial numbers 52-1066 and 53-0044) in September 1974.

==Accidents and incidents==
*23 March 1951: A C-124A 49-0244 flying from Loring Air Force Base to RAF Mildenhall reported a fire in the cargo crates, signaling mayday. They began jettisoning the crates and announced they were ditching. The C-124 ditched around , southwest of Ireland. The aircraft was intact when it touched down on the ocean. All hands exited the aircraft wearing life preservers and climbed into the inflated five-man life rafts. The rafts were equipped with cold-weather gear, food, water, flares, and Gibson Girl hand-crank emergency radios. Shortly after the men were in the life rafts, a B-29 pilot out of England spotted the rafts and the flares that the men had ignited. Their location was reported and the pilot left the scene when his fuel was getting low. No other United States or Allied planes or ships made it to the ditch site for over 19 hours, until Sunday, 25 March 1951. When the ships arrived, all they found were some charred crates and a partially deflated life raft. Ships and planes continued searching for the next several days, but not a single body was found. Some circumstantial evidence indicates that the airmen may have been &quot;snatched&quot; by the Soviet Union for their intelligence value, but their fate remains a mystery. See 1951 Atlantic C-124 disappearance.
*22 November 1952: C-124A 51-0107 ,flying out of McChord Air Force Base in Washington, crashed into the Colony Glacier on Mount Gannett, east of Anchorage, Alaska, killing all 41 passengers and 11 crew. Debris from the plane and remains of some of the victims were found by the Alaska National Guard on 10 June 2012, having apparently been uncovered due to the receding of the glacier. By 2014, remains of 17 victims had been recovered.
*20 December 1952: C-124 50-0100 flying out of Moses Lake, Washington (Larson AFB), and taking airmen home to Texas for the holidays as part of &quot;Operation Sleigh Ride&quot; crashed not long after takeoff. In total, 87 airmen were killed.
*18 June 1953: C-124 51-137 took off from Tachikawa Air Base in Japan. Shortly after takeoff, one of the engines failed, forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing. Due to a loss of airspeed, the pilot lost control and crashed into a melon patch, killing all seven crew and 122 passengers. At the time, it was the worst accident in aviation history.
*6 April 1956: C-124 52-1078, crashed on takeoff from Travis AFB. Three of the seven crew members died in the crash. The cause of the crash was attributed to the crossing of the elevator control cables by maintenance personnel.
* 2 April 1957: C-124A 51-5176 crashed on final approach in Cambridge Bay, Nunavut (at the time, in the Northwest Territories), while ferrying supplies for the construction of the DEW Line station. No fatalities occurred, but the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.
*31 August 1957: C-124C 52-1021, operated by the 1st Strategic Squadron, crashed during an instrument approach to Biggs Air Force Base in El Paso, Texas, in bad weather after a flight from Hunter AFB near Savannah, Georgia. Five aircrew were killed, and 10 were injured.
*4 September 1957, C-124A 51-5173 &quot;en route&quot; from Larson AFB, Washington, crashed while attempting a landing at Binghamton Airport, Binghamton, New York. The C-124A was delivering 20 tons of equipment for Link Aviation. The crew of nine survived.
*27 March 1958: C-124C 52-0981 collided in midair with a USAF Fairchild C-119C Flying Boxcar, 49-0195, over farmland near Bridgeport, Texas, killing all 15 on the Globemaster and all three on the Flying Boxcar. The two transports crossed paths over a VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) navigational radio beacon during cruise flight under instrument flight rules in low visibility. The C-124 was on a north-north-easterly heading flying at its properly assigned altitude of 7,000 ft (2,100 m); the C-119 was on a southeasterly heading, and the crew had been instructed to fly at 6,000 ft (1,800 m), but their aircraft was not flying at this altitude when the collision occurred.
*16 October 1958: C-124C 52-1017 crashed into a mountain near Cape Hallett Bay, killing seven of the 13 on board. Navigational errors were made during this air-drop mission over Antarctica.
*18 April 1960: C-124C 52-1062 crashed into a hillside after taking off in heavy fog from Stephenville-Harmon Air Force Base, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, killing all nine on board.
*24 May 1961: C-124 51-0174 crashed following takeoff from McChord Air Force Base. Eighteen of the 22 passengers and crew were killed. M/Sgt Llewellyn Morris Chilson, the second-highest decorated soldier of World War II, was one of the four survivors.
*2 January 1964: C-124C 52–0968 of the 24th Air Transport Squadron flying from Wake Island Airfield to Hickam Air Force Base, Honolulu, was on a flight from Tachikawa Air Force Base near Tokyo, Japan, with 11 tons of cargo; the plane disappeared over the ocean, 1,200 km west of Hawaii. The Globemaster II is last heard from at 0159 hrs. An automatic SOS signal was detected emanating from an aircraft-type radio with a constant carrier frequency of 4728 kHz, issuing an automatically keyed distress message. Eight crew and one passenger were lost in the accident.
*22 January 1965: C-124 52-1058 crashed into mountains while on approach to Athens Airport. All 10 passengers and crew were killed.
*12 February 1966: C-124 52-0980 crashed into the Pico Mulhacén in the Sierra Nevada while on a flight from Morón Air Base to Murcia–San Javier Airport, Spain. All eight aboard were killed.
*28 July 1968: C-124A 51-5178, flying from Paramaribo-Zanderij to Recife, while on approach to land at Recife, flew into a 1,890-ft-high hill, 50 miles (80 km) away from Recife. All 10 occupants died.
*26 August 1970: C-124 52-1049 crashed on approach to Cold Bay Airport in the Aleutian Islands. All seven on board were killed.
*3 May 1972: C-124 52-1055 crashed on approach to Johan Adolf Pengel International Airport; all 11 on board were killed.

<text>World Journal () is a U.S. newspaper printed in Chinese. It is the most influential Chinese language newspaper in the United States and one of the largest Chinese language newspapers outside of Greater China, with a daily circulation of 350,000. The newspaper is headquartered in the Whitestone neighborhood of Queens in New York City.

&quot;World Journal&quot; is published in major cities in the United States with large overseas Chinese populations including New York as well as Los Angeles, and San Francisco. The publication is widely sold in many Chinatowns and major suburbs. Subscription is available in the United States and Canada.

==History==
The newspaper was established simultaneously in New York and San Francisco on February 12, 1976. The headquarter is located in Whitestone, New York City, where it has since remained.

The &quot;World Journal&quot; is one of three major Chinese-language dailies among the Chinese American community. The publication is owned by the same media conglomerate that runs the &quot;United Daily News&quot; in Taiwan and carries a significant Taiwanese American administrative presence. Until the mid-1990s, it was viewed as hostile to the People&#x27;s Republic of China, in part because the paper referred to people from mainland China as &quot;Communist Chinese&quot;. Furthermore, its coverage on mainland China usually comprised only one article or so each day out of dozens of pages and sections.

However, the newspaper has changed since it began increasing its coverage of mainland China. Following the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, such coverage increased to two pages per day. While the paper still attempts to maintain an anti-communist stance, it has become increasingly sensitive to the tastes of its large Chinese immigrant readership which has grown since the 1990s with the expanded access to permanent resident green cards in the United States following the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. Another reason for the shift was rooted in the newspaper&#x27;s sympathy to the Chinese democracy movement.

Immediately after the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the newspaper no longer referred indiscriminately to all mainland Chinese as &quot;Communist Chinese&quot;, and additionally praised pro-democracy efforts on the mainland. During the mid-1990s, it began to give credit to the positive progress made in mainland China, and by the late-1990s, it began to criticize wrongdoings within the Chinese democracy movement and in the West in the same manner with which it criticizes corruption within the Chinese communist regime. After 2000, there has also been an increase in the representation of mainland Chinese immigrants on the newspaper&#x27;s reporting staff, and the paper has published readers&#x27; letters voicing different views from the pro-Taiwan independence stance that have also made it popular among mainland Chinese immigrants to the United States.

&quot;World Journal&quot; ceased publication in Canada on January 1, 2016, to better focus its business in the United States.

==Controversies==

===Alleged ties to the Chinese Communist Party===
According to a 2001 report by the Jamestown Foundation, &quot;World Journal&quot; was one of the four major Chinese newspapers found in the U.S. that &quot;has recently begun bowing to pressure from the Beijing government.&quot; The other three which were &quot;Sing Tao Daily&quot;, &quot;Ming Pao Daily News&quot;, and &quot;The China Press&quot; had already been &quot;either directly or indirectly controlled by the government of Mainland China&quot;. The report referenced an instance of self-censorship by &quot;World Journal&quot; in its efforts to develop business ties with Mainland China in which Chinese Consulates in both New York and San Francisco have pressured the paper″s local offices to not publish ads related to Falun Gong. The New York office reportedly acquiesced in full and did not publish the ads, while the San Francisco office acquiesced in part by burying the ads among the paper&#x27;s least viewed pages. Conversely, Jason Q. Ng of China Digital Times and Citizen Lab considered &quot;World Journal&quot; in 2013 to be relatively critical of PRC policies.

===Labor law violation===
On January 10, 2007, a Southern California jury found the Monterey Park-based &quot;Chinese Daily News&quot; responsible for failing to give employees breaks, lunches, and overtime, and awarded the plaintiffs $2.5 million. The plaintiffs alleged that they worked over twelve hours per day, were not provided accurate pay statements, and were unfairly interfered with during unionization attempts. In 2001, the employees voted to join the Communication Workers of America, but the National Labor Relations Board vacated the union vote after finding that the election was tainted. &quot;Chinese Daily News&quot; appealed the ruling in the district court, with proceedings held in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal and the U.S. Supreme Court.

In 2011, after the U.S. Supreme Court decided &quot;Dukes v. Wal-Mart&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court remanded the case back to the Ninth Circuit for reconsideration in light of Dukes. On September 13, 2013, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal rejected the district court&#x27;s grant of class certification under FRCP Rule 23(b)(3). Upon remand at the district court level, Plaintiffs once again moved for class certification, and the district court recertified the class.

&quot;Chinese Daily News&quot; thereafter filed a FRCP Rule 23(f) Petition to Appeal, which the Ninth Circuit granted on August 22, 2014. This matter is currently pending briefing at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal. The Los Angeles area-based &quot;Chinese Daily News&quot; was later amalgamated into the New York City-headquartered &quot;World Journal&quot;.

===Discrimination against breastfeeding women===
On October 21, 2013, &quot;World Journal&quot; published a controversial article that allegedly discriminated against breastfeeding women. Titled &quot;Breastfeeding photos embarrass Chinese-American to death&quot;, the article cited anonymous resources, labeled breastfeeding photos as &quot;R-rated-photos&quot;, described those photos as &quot;disturbing&quot; and &quot;disgusting.&quot; The article received strong reaction among Chinese American Community and the Taiwanese Breastfeeding Association launched a protest against &quot;World Journal&quot;. Media Watch criticized that the report was &quot;misleading&quot; and &quot;biased.&quot;

It was also reported that &quot;World Journal&quot; allegedly failed to accommodate employees&#x27; legal nursing needs. Taiwanese American journalist and author To-wen Tseng blogged about her experience of being forced to pump her breast milk in a bathroom stall, and was harassed by colleagues for attempting to wash pumping accessories in the office kitchen. In November 2013, Legal Aid Society-Employment Law Center submitted a lawyer&#x27;s letter to &quot;World Journal&quot;, requesting a policy change and supervisor training regarding nursing employee&#x27;s legal rights.

The &quot;World Journal&quot; disputed the employee&#x27;s claims, but agreed to settle the case. On August 25, 2014, &quot;World Journal&quot; made a policy change as requested and paid for the damage.

<doc id="489072" wikidata="Q13293" url="?curid=489072" title="Southern Sámi">
<text>Southern or South Sámi (; ; ) is the southwesternmost of the Sámi languages, and is spoken in Norway and Sweden. It is an endangered language. Southern Sámi belongs to the Saamic group within the Uralic language family.

In Sweden, Saami is one of five recognized minority languages, but the term &quot;Saami&quot; comprises different varieties/languages, and they are not individually recognized. In Norway, Southern Sámi is recognized as a minority language in its own right.

It is possible to study Southern Sámi at Nord University in Levanger Municipality, Umeå University in Umeå Municipality, and Uppsala University in Uppsala Municipality. In 2018, two master&#x27;s degrees were written in the language at Umeå University. Language courses are also offered at different Sámi-language centres throughout the Southern Sámi area.

==Writing system==
Southern Sámi is one of the eight Sámi languages that have an official written standard, but only a few books have been published for the language, one of which is an adequate-sized Southern Sámi–Norwegian dictionary. This language has had an official written form since 1978. The spelling is closely based on Swedish and Norwegian and uses the following Latin alphabet:
In 1976, the Sámi Language Council recommended the use of ⟨æ⟩ and ⟨ö⟩, but in practice the latter is replaced by ⟨ø⟩ in Norway and the former by ⟨ä⟩ in Sweden. This is in accordance with the usage in Norwegian and Swedish, based on computer or typewriter availability. The represents a back version of ; however, many texts fail to distinguish between the two.

, , , , and are only used in words of foreign origin.

Long sounds are represented with double letters for both vowels and consonants.

==Phonology==

Southern Sámi has fifteen consonant and eleven vowel phonemes; there are six places of articulation for consonants and six manners of articulation.

There are also two dialects, northern and southern. The phonological differences are relatively small; the phonemic system of the northern dialect is explained below.

The typical word in Southern Sámi is disyllabic, containing a long stem vowel and ending in a vowel, as in the word /pa:ko/ &#x27;word&#x27;. Function words are monosyllabic, as are the copula and the negative auxiliary. Stress is fixed and always word-initial. Words with more than three syllables are given secondary stress in the penultimate syllable.

===Vowels===
The eleven vowel phonemes comprise four phonologically short and long vowels (i-i:, e-e:, a-a:, u-u:) and three vowel phonemes which do not distinguish length (ø, æ, o).

The vowel phonemes of the northern dialect are the following; orthographic counterparts are given in italics:


The non-high vowels , , , and contrast in length: they may occur as both short and long. High vowels only occur short.

The vowels may combine to form ten different diphthongs:

===Consonants===
In Southern Sámi, all consonants occur as geminates in word-medial position. 
==Grammar==

=== Sound alternations ===

In Southern Sámi, the vowel in the second syllable of a word causes changes to the vowel in the first syllable, a feature called umlaut. The vowel in the second syllable can change depending on the inflectional ending being attached, and the vowel in the first vowel will likewise alternate accordingly. Often there are three different vowels that alternate with each other in the paradigm of a single word, for example as follows:

* ~ ~ : &#x27;to walk&#x27; : &#x27;I walk&#x27; : &#x27;I walked&#x27;
* ~ ~ : &#x27;to leave&#x27; : &#x27;I leave&#x27; : &#x27;I left&#x27;

The following table gives a full overview of the alternations:

On the other hand, Southern Sámi is the only Sami language that does not have consonant gradation. Hence, consonants in the middle of words never alternate in Southern Sámi, even though such alternations are frequent in its relatives. Compare, for instance, Southern Sámi &#x27;name&#x27; : &#x27;in the name&#x27; to Northern Sámi : , with the consonant gradation : .

=== Cases ===

Southern Sámi has eight cases:

== Morphology ==

=== Nouns ===
Southern Sámi nouns inflect for singular and plural and have eight cases: nominative, accusative, genitive, illative, locative, elative, comitative, and essive, but number is not distinguished in the essive. Inflection is essentially agglutinative, but the case endings are not always the same in the plural and in the singular. The plural marker is -h in the nominative case, otherwise -i/j-, to which the case endings are added. There are five different inflection classes but no declension classes. All nouns take the same case markers.

The function of the nominative is to mark the subject, and the accusative marks the object. The nominative plural can also be used to mark plural (direct) objects, a feature called differential object marking, and here the noun gets an indefinite reading, while the accusative plural marks definite direct objects. The genitive is used in adnominal possession and marks the dependent of postpositions. The illative is a spatial case marking the recipient; while the locative and elative are also spatial cases, the locative is additionally used in existential constructions and the elative in partitive constructions. The comitative expresses participation and instrument, and the essive marks a state or a function.

Four stem classes can be distinguished: ie-stems, e-stems, a-stems, and oe-stems.

Earlier, in the comitative singular and in the plural, besides the nominative i, umlaut of the root vowel to öö took place: Gen. Pl. göölij etc.

=== Pronouns ===
Personal pronouns inflect for three numbers (singular, dual, and plural) and seven cases (all of the above with the exception of the essive). A demonstrative pronoun without specific deictic bias is employed as the third-person pronoun, treating dual and plural forms as indistinguishable. Additional pronouns encompass pronominal and adnominal demonstratives, along with interrogative and relative pronouns, reflexive, logophoric, reciprocal, and a variety of indefinite pronouns. The majority of these pronouns change based on whether they refer to a singular or plural entity, and some also adapt to different cases. Demonstratives distinguish between three degrees of distance relative to the speaker.
===Verbs===
Southern Sámi verbs inflect for person (first, second, and third) and number (singular, dual, and plural, where dual is an optional category). There are also two finite inflectional categories, the present and the past tense. Subject suffixes are the same across the tenses, and there are three different inflectional classes based on the thematic vowels and their behaviour in inflection. Furthermore, there are 4 non-finite forms: the perfect participle, the progressive, the infinitive, and the connegative and imperative form. Meanwhile, verbs express the TAM categories present indicative, past indicative, perfect, pluperfect, progressive, and imperative. The copula also inflects for the conditional.

In the verbum, a distinction must be made between odd-syllable and even-syllable verbs; in the latter, there are six different stem classes.

The morphology of adjectives is restricted to comparative and superlative forms. Some have different forms in attributive and predicative position, but most are invariable.

====Person====

Southern Sámi verbs conjugate for three grammatical persons:

*first person
*second person
*third person

====Mood ====

====Tense====

====Grammatical number====

Southern Sámi verbs conjugate for three grammatical numbers:

*singular
*dual
*plural

====Negative verb====

Southern Sámi, like Finnish, the other Sámi languages, and Estonian, has a negative verb. In Southern Sámi, the negative verb conjugates according to tense (past and non-past), mood (indicative and imperative), person (first, second, and third), and number (singular, dual, and plural). This differs from some other Sámi languages, e.g. Northern Sámi, which do not conjugate according to tense.

==Syntax==

Like Skolt Sámi and unlike other Sámi languages, Southern Sámi has preserved the basic structure SOV (Subject-Object-Verb). Only the copula (&#x27;to be&#x27;) and auxiliary verbs appear second. The case-alignment system is nominative-accusative. However, plural objects are also sometimes marked with the nominative. Objects in the nominative plural get an indefinite reading, while objects in the accusative plural are definite. This applies for nouns as well as pronouns. An example of a plural object in the nominative:

Subject and agent are always marked identically, while the marking of the object depends on definiteness. 

The verb agrees with the subject in person and number. The TAM categories mentioned above are based on non-finite verb forms and are expressed in periphrastic constructions with an auxiliary. The subject agrees with the auxiliary, but it is not obligatory. It is either marked on the pronoun or inferred from context. The imperative second singular uses the same non-finite irrealis form also used in negation constructions. 

Southern Sámi has some features that separate the language from its closest relatives, like SOV instead of SVO as basic constituent order, no stem gradation, and a genitive possessive. Nevertheless, most features of Southern Sámi are commonly found in other Uralic languages.

<text>Daniel Friedrich List (6 August 1789 – 30 November 1846) was a German entrepreneur, diplomat, economist and political theorist who developed the nationalist theory of political economy in both Europe and the United States. He was a forefather of the German historical school of economics and argued for the Zollverein (a pan-German customs union) from a nationalist standpoint. He advocated raising tariffs on imported goods while supporting free trade of domestic goods and stated the cost of a tariff should be seen as an investment in a nation&#x27;s future productivity. His theories and writing also influenced the American school of economics.

List was a political liberal who collaborated with Karl von Rotteck and Carl Theodor Welcker on the &quot;&quot;, an encyclopedia of political science that advocated constitutional liberalism and which influenced the &quot;Vormärz&quot;. At the time in Europe, liberal and nationalist ideas were almost inseparably linked, and political liberalism was not yet attached to what was later considered &quot;economic liberalism.&quot; Emmanuel Todd considers List a forerunner to John Maynard Keynes as a theorist of &quot;moderate or regulated capitalism.&quot;

== Biography ==
===Early life===
Daniel Friedrich List was born in the free imperial city of Reutlingen in the Duchy of Württemberg. His date of birth is uncertain, but his baptism is usually given as August 6, 1789. His father, Johannes (1746–1813), was a prosperous master tanner and a city official, and his mother was Maria Magdalena (née Schäfer). Daniel Friedrich was the second son and youngest child in his family. He was educated at the town&#x27;s Latin School. As an apprentice at his father&#x27;s tanning business, List showed little interest in manual labor. He was apprenticed as a bureaucratic clerk at Blaubeuren. After passing his examination, he entered the administrative service in 1805 and became Taxes and Warehouses Commissioner in Schelklingen.

===University professor and early advocacy for German customs union: 1817–1820===
At age 23 in 1811, List was promoted to a post at Tübingen. While there, he regularly attended lectures at the University of Tübingen and expanded his reading. He also made the acquaintance of the future minister . In 1816, List&#x27;s position in the bureaucracy was improved as the succession of King William I of Württemberg ushered in a period of reform. Under minister , later his sponsor, List rose quickly through the bureaucracy. He moved to the Ministry of Finance in Stuttgart and rose to the position of chief auditor and accountant in 1816. In that role, he commissioned surveys among emigrants from Baden and Württemberg for the purpose of studying the increase in emigration and enacting countermeasures.

Von Wangenheim, who had meanwhile been appointed Minister for Church and School Affairs for the Duchy, commissioned List to propose reforms to university civil service training. List proposed establishing a political science faculty alongside the standard legal training, arguing in 1817:

&quot;No one in our University has any conception of a national economy. No one teaches the science of agriculture, forestry, mining, industry, or trade. ... [T]he forms of government are in such a truly barbarous state, that if an official of the seventeenth century rose again from the dead he could at once take up his old work, though he would assuredly be astonished to find the advances that had been made during the interval in the simplest process of manufacture.&quot;

This proposal was accepted and the institution opened in Tübingen on October 17, 1817. Despite lacking a university degree, List was appointed professor of public administration science at the insistence of Von Wangenheim. The established professors and the university committees opposed the appointment on the grounds that List had only achieved his position through patronage, and they accused him of incompetence.

List published his thoughts on these reform in the short book &quot;Die Staatskunde und Staatspraxis Württembergs&quot; (1818). He further published arguments for constitutional liberalism in the magazine &quot;Volksfreund aus Schwaben, a national newspaper for morality, freedom and law&quot;. His journalistic activities drew suspicion from the new Württemberg government, and List was compelled to submit a petition to the king to defend himself against accusations of subversion.

In 1819, List traveled to Frankfurt and organized local merchants to establish the General German Trade and Industry Association. This association, which was later renamed the &quot;Association of German Merchants and Manufacturers&quot;, is considered the first German business association of the modern era. List thus stands at the beginning of the economic association system that has been typical of German economic history since the 19th century. List formulated the association&#x27;s opposition to customs borders between the various German states and first envisioned the creation of a large German common market as a necessary prerequisite for the industrialization of Germany. With regard to the foreign trade policy of this desired new internal market, List advocated a retaliatory tariff that would compensate for the trade barriers that existed for German traders abroad. This tariff was intended to protect German economic interests, but it was not yet the idea of an educational tariff that he later developed. The association initiated a petition drive and lobbied German governments and princes to promote these policies.

&quot;Thirty-eight customs and toll lines in Germany paralyze internal traffic and produce approximately the same effect as if every limb of the human body were ligated so that the blood did not overflow into another. In order to trade from Hamburg to Austria, from Berlin to Switzerland, one has to cross ten states, study ten customs and toll regulations, and pay ten times the transit toll.&quot;– Extract from the petition of the General German Trade and Industry Association of 14 April 1819 to the Federal Assembly, formulated by Friedrich List

The Bundestag did not recognize the trade association and instead referred the signatories to the individual state governments. These, however, strictly rejected outside interference in state affairs, and List&#x27;s activism lost the trust of King Wilhelm I. In order to forestall his dismissal as professor, List resigned his office. Instead, List turned his focus to activism. He became editor-in-chief of the newspaper &quot;Organ for the German Trade and Industry&quot;, founded on July 1, 1818 and managing director of the Trade and Industry Association. In the latter role, he traveled to various German capitals and unsuccessfully sought dialogue with the governments. Among other places, he traveled to Vienna in 1820, where a pan-German follow-up conference to the Carlsbad Assembly was held. There, List presented an expanded memorandum advocating for the broad principles of free trade. He also presented suggestions for an industrial exhibition or the establishment of an overseas trading company. Despite these failures, Wangenheim, who had become the Württemberg delegate to the Bundestag, relied on List to develop plans for a , which eventually became a reality in 1828.

===Member of Württemberg parliament and imprisonment: 1820–1824===
By 1819, List had been elected to the Württemberg state parliament, but his election was invalid, having not reached the minimum age of 30. In 1820, he was elected to the state parliament from Reutlingen.

As a member of parliament, he continued his campaign for democracy and free trade. In his &quot;Reutlingen Petition &quot; of January 1821, he criticized the prevailing bureaucracy and economic policy, arguing, &quot;A superficial look at the internal conditions of Württemberg must convince the unbiased observer that the legislation and administration of our fatherland suffer from fundamental defects that are consuming the marrow of the country and destroying civil liberties.&quot; List further argued that Württemberg suffered under a “world of bureaucrats separated from the people, spread over the whole country and concentrated in the ministries, ignorant of the needs of the people and the conditions of civil life, … opposing every influence of the citizen as if it were a threat to the state.” To remedy the issue, List proposed strong local self-government, including free elections to local authorities and independent local jurisdiction. However, his petition was confiscated by police before it could be distributed. Under pressure from King Wilhelm I, the conservative parliament withdrew his political immunity in a vote on February 24, 1821.

On April 6, 1822, List was sentenced to ten months imprisonment at Hohenasperg. He fled and evaded capture for two years in Baden, Alsace and Switzerland but returned to serve his sentence in 1824, having been unable to build a secure life in exile.

===Exile in United States: 1825–1833===
After serving five months of his sentence at Hohenasperg, List was pardoned in exchange for agreeing to emigrate to the United States of America. He initially worked as a farmer, with little success. After one year, he sold his farm and moved to Reading, Pennsylvania, where he became editor-in-chief of the German-language &quot;Reading Adler&quot; from 1826 to 1830.

After discovering a coal deposit in 1827, he and several partners founded a coal mine. In 1831, they also founded the Little Schuylkill Navigation, Railroad and Coal Company, which opened a railroad line to transport the coal, making List an early American railroad pioneer. Through these ventures, he gained a certain amount of wealth and financial independence, which he lost again in the wake of the Panic of 1837.

While in the United States, List further developed arguments for economic nationalism, joining American entrepreneurs in demanding the introduction of protective tariffs in 1827. List also came into contact with the ideas of Alexander Hamilton and contributed, among other works, to the 1827 publication &quot;Outlines of American Political Economy&quot;, in which he provided economic support for the demand for trade protections. He began to distance himself from Adam Smith&#x27;s theories of free trade as the basis for his customs union proposals, instead arguing that protective tariffs would empower the United States and Germany, which lagged behind England in industrialization, to develop domestic economic sovereignty. In &quot;Outlines of Political Economy&quot;, List drew heavily on Jean-Antoine Chaptal&#x27;s work &quot;De l’industrie française&quot; (1819) and the emerging historical school of economics to argue that economic policy should vary depending on the needs of individual states. Some argue (e.g., Chang, 2002) that List&#x27;s American exile inspired his pronounced &quot;National System&quot;, which found realization in Henry Clay&#x27;s American System. Others deny this (e.g., Daastøl, 2011), since List argued for a German customs union as early as 1819 and his views in the United States were framed as pragmatic rather than dogmatic and were influenced by liberal protectionists such as Chaptal and Adolphe Thiers.

The protectionist campaign brought List into the presidential election of 1828, in which he supported Andrew Jackson. Jackson granted List American citizenship in 1830 and appointed him consul to Hamburg in 1830, though this appointment was not confirmed by the United States Senate, and the Grand Duchy of Baden at Leipzig in 1833, providing him diplomatic immunity and protection from prosecution in Württemberg. However, the position did not provide a fixed salary, and List soon neglected his duties. While in Leipzig, List traveled frequently to Paris to promote American-French trade relations. He met frequently with Heinrich Heine and, through his daughters, befriended the musicians Robert and Clara Schumann.

===Leipzig, railway promotion and encyclopedist: 1833–1837===

Soon after his arrival in Leipzig in 1833, List began to promote the construction of a greater German railway network. For List, overcoming the inner-German customs barriers and the construction of railways were the &quot;Siamese twins&quot; of German economic history and thus necessary steps towards the economic development of the German states. He wrote a short paper, which he distributed free of charge in large numbers, arguing for the economic advantages of such a railway, which would enable cheap, fast and regular mass transport, and therefore promote the development of the division of labor, the choice of location for commercial enterprises and ultimately, a developed consumer economy. On the basis of this paper, a committee was founded that drew up a convincing cost and profitability analysis, negotiated the necessary concessions with the government and finally issued shares to finance the route. The Leipzig–Dresden railway, established in 1839, was the first German long-distance railway line. Most other German railway projects were also based on List&#x27;s model of organization.

He subsequently attempted to initiate similar projects in other German states or publicly supported existing projects. In 1835, for example, he advocated a route from Mannheim to Basel, another from Magdeburg to Berlin and a connection from there to Hamburg. In order to promote these proposals and his economic program, List founded the &quot;Eisenbahnjournal und National-Magazin für die Fortschritt in Handel, Gewerbe und Ackerbau&quot; in 1835. Forty issues of this magazine were published, concluding in 1837.

In Leipzig, List also proposed an encyclopedia of political science, the &quot;&quot; working with Karl von Rotteck and Carl Theodor Welcker as co-editors. Significant tensions quickly arose, particularly with Welcker, until List was pushed out of the project. The encyclopedia, published in 1834, is considered one of the most important texts of early German liberalism. It provided a common intellectual basis for the emerging German liberal movement and was therefore a significant contribution to its cohesion across the German states. Franz Schnabel described the first edition of 1834 as the &quot;basic book of Vormärz liberalism.&quot; List contributed articles focused on industry and technology, including railways, steamships, workers, wages and labor-saving machines.

Despite his achievements, List himself received little material benefit from his involvement in railway politics, apart from a few bonuses. When his income from his American investments decreased following the Panic of 1837, List had to give up his voluntary activism and look for new ways of earning money. In addition, his attempt to be rehabilitated in Württemberg failed in 1836, after a corresponding petition for clemency had been rejected. List decided to relocate permanently to Paris.

===Journalism and &quot;The National System&quot;: 1837–1841===
In Paris, List wrote regularly for the leading German newspaper, &quot;Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;, as a correspondent on French domestic politics. He also returned to his work on general political economy. His 1837 work &quot;The Natural System of Political Economy&quot; renewed interest in his ideas in Germany, such that from 1839 to 1840, he was able to publish numerous essays on trade policy and legislation, which would later for the basis of his magnum opus.

In 1840, List returned to Germany following the death of his only son, Oskar, in the service of the French Foreign Legion. He settled in Augsburg, initially continuing his work as a journalist. In 1841, he published his main work, &quot;The National System of Political Economy&quot;, inspired by the work of Jérôme-Adolphe Blanqui, &quot;Histoire de l&#x27;economique politique en Europe&quot;. As in his earlier writings, List argued that economic development was the product of legal, social and political factors and that industrialization was the necessary initial spark of a self-reinforcing process of development. Therefore, to promote industrialization, List advocated for the establishment of a unified nation-state and a protective tariff against foreign goods, until an internationally competitive domestic industry could be developed.

List continued to promote his ideas in the German context, arguing that the liberal tariffs established by the Zollverein in 1834 had primarily promoted Prussian interests within Germany, and that the greater German economy should establish an &quot;educational&quot; tariff to counter the superior productivity of England. In 1844, the Zollverein set moderate protective tariffs focused on iron and yarn, stimulating economic development for a time but allowing technology transfers and the importation of necessary finished goods from England.

===Later years: 1841–1846===
In 1841, the Württemberg government restored List&#x27;s &quot;civic honor&quot;, though his hopes of a position in the southern German states was not fulfilled. He continued to argue for protective tariffs, but became increasingly withdrawn due to ill health. In 1841, he declined an offer to edit the &quot;Rheinische Zeitung&quot;, a new liberal Cologne newspaper, and the role went to . Karl Marx eventually took the post. He also rejected an offer from Russian Minister of Finance Georg Ludwig Cancrin.

In 1843, he established the &quot;Zollvereinsblatt&quot; in Augsburg, a newspaper in which continued his advocacy for the enlargement of the Zollverein and the organization of a national commercial system. After a long lecture tour in 1844, he returned to Augsburg in 1845. As the Zollverein moved toward a policy of free trade and List&#x27;s ideas fell out of public interest, his publisher withdrew and he continued the &quot;Zollvereinsblatt&quot; at his own expense. He visited England with a view to forming a commercial alliance between that country and Germany but was unsuccessful.

In 1846, with his property lost in another American crisis and his health failing, List traveled to Tyrol and committed suicide in Kufstein on November 30 with a seven-inch travel pistol. Since the autopsy showed that List was &quot;afflicted with such a degree of melancholy that free thought and action was impossible&quot;, he was afforded a Christian burial.

In an obituary, List&#x27;s long-time opponent Altvater wrote:

== Views ==

===Nationalist view of political economy===

List&#x27;s theory of &quot;national economics&quot; differed from the doctrines of &quot;individual economics&quot; and &quot;cosmopolitan economics&quot; by Adam Smith and Jean-Baptiste Say. List argued that Smithian critiques of mercantilism were &quot;partly correct&quot;, but argued for the need for temporary tariff protection targeted to protect specific infant industries that were critical to economic growth.

List contrasted the economic behaviour of an individual with that of a nation. An individual promotes only his own personal interests but a state fosters the welfare of all its citizens. An individual may prosper from activities which harm the interests of a nation. &quot;Slavery may be a public calamity for a country, nevertheless some people may do very well in carrying on the slave trade and in holding slaves.&quot; Likewise, activities beneficial to society may injure the interests of certain individuals. &quot;Canals and railroads may do great good to a nation, but all waggoners will complain of this improvement. Every new invention has some inconvenience for a number of individuals, and is nevertheless a public blessing&quot;. List argued that although some government action was essential to stimulate the economy, an overzealous government might do more harm than good. &quot;It is bad policy to regulate everything and to promote everything by employing social powers, where things may better regulate themselves and can be better promoted by private exertions; but it is no less bad policy to let those things alone which can only be promoted by interfering social power.&quot;

Due to the &quot;universal union&quot; that nations have with their populace, List stated that &quot;from this political union originates their commercial union, and it is in consequence of the perpetual peace thus maintained that commercial union has become so beneficial to them. ... The result of a general free trade would not be a universal republic, but, on the contrary, a universal subjection of the less advanced nations to the predominant manufacturing, commercial and naval power, is a conclusion for which the reasons are very strong. ... A universal republic ... , i.e. a union of the nations of the earth whereby they recognise the same conditions of right among themselves and renounce self-redress, can only be realised if a large number of nationalities attain to as nearly the same degree as possible of industry and civilisation, political cultivation and power. Only with the gradual formation of this union can free trade be developed; only as a result of this union can it confer on all nations the same great advantages which are now experienced by those provinces and states which are politically united. The system of protection, inasmuch as it forms the only means of placing those nations which are far behind in civilisation on equal terms with the one predominating nation, appears to be the most efficient means of furthering the final union of nations, and hence also of promoting true freedom of trade.&quot;

In his seventh letter List repeated his assertion that economists should realise that since the human race is divided into independent states, &quot;a nation would act unwisely to endeavour to promote the welfare of the whole human race at the expense of its particular strength, welfare, and independence. It is a dictate of the law of self-preservation to make its particular advancement in power and strength the first principles of its policy&quot;. A country should not count the cost of defending the overseas trade of its merchants. And &quot;the manufacturing and agricultural interest must be promoted and protected even by sacrifices of the majority of the individuals, if it can be proved that the nation would never acquire the necessary perfection ... without such protective measures.&quot;

List argued that international trade reduced the security of the states who took part in it.

List argued that statesmen had two responsibilities: &quot;one to contemporary society and one to future generations&quot;. Normally, the attention of most leaders is occupied by urgent matters, leaving little time to consider future problems. But when a country had reached a turning point in its development, its leaders were morally obliged to deal with issues that would affect the next generation. &quot;On the threshold of a new phase in the development of their country, statesmen should be prepared to take the long view, despite the need to deal also with matters of immediate urgency.&quot;

List&#x27;s fundamental doctrine was that a nation&#x27;s true wealth is the full and many-sided development of its productive power, rather than its current exchange values. For example, its economic education should be more important than immediate production of value, and it might be right that one generation should sacrifice its gain and enjoyment to secure the strength and skill of the future. Under normal conditions, an economically mature nation should also develop agriculture, manufacture and commerce. However, the last two factors were more important since they better influenced the nation&#x27;s culture and independence and were especially connected to navigation, railways and high technology, and a purely-agricultural state tended to stagnate

However, List claimed that only countries in temperate regions were adapted to grow higher forms of industry. On the other hand, tropical regions had a natural monopoly in the production of certain raw materials. Thus, there were a spontaneous division of labor and a confederation of powers between both groups of countries.

List contended that Smith&#x27;s economic system is not an industrial system but a mercantile system, and he called it &quot;the exchange-value system&quot;. Contrary to Smith, he argued that the immediate private interest of individuals would not lead to the highest good of society. The nation stood between the individual and humanity, and was defined by its language, manners, historical development, culture and constitution. The unity must be the first condition of the security, well-being, progress and civilization of the individual. Private economic interests, like all others, must be subordinated to the maintenance, completion and strengthening of the nation.

===Stages of economic development===
List theorised that nations of the temperate zone (which are furnished with all the necessary conditions) naturally pass through stages of economic development in advancing to their normal economic state. These are:
# Pastoral life
# Agriculture
# Agriculture united with manufactures
# Agriculture, manufactures and commerce are combined

The progress of the nation through these stages is the task of the state, which must create the required conditions for the progress by using legislation and administrative action. This view leads to List&#x27;s scheme of industrial politics. Every nation should begin with free trade, stimulating and improving its agriculture by trade with richer and more cultivated nations, importing foreign manufactures and exporting raw products. When it is economically so far advanced that it can manufacture for itself, then protection should be used to allow the home industries to develop, and save them from being overpowered by the competition of stronger foreign industries in the home market. When the national industries have grown strong enough that this competition is not a threat, then the highest stage of progress has been reached; free trade should again become the rule, and the nation be thus thoroughly incorporated with the universal industrial union. What a nation loses in exchange during the protective period, it more than gains in the long run in productive power. The temporary expenditure is analogous to the cost of the industrial education of the individual.

In a thousand cases the power of the State is compelled to impose restrictions on private industry. It prevents the ship owner from taking on board slaves on the west coast of Africa, and taking them over to America. It imposes regulations as to the building of steamers and the rules of navigation at sea, in order that passengers and sailors may not be sacrificed to the avarice and caprice of the captains. [...] Everywhere does the State consider it to be its duty to guard the public against danger and loss, as in the sale of the necessaries of life, so also in the sale of medicines, etc.

===Railways===
List was the leading promoter of railways in Germany. His proposals on how to start up a system were widely adopted. He summed up the advantages to be derived from the development of the railway system in 1841:
# It is a means of national defence: it facilitates the concentration, distribution and direction of the army.
# It is a means to the improvement of the culture of the nation. It brings talent, knowledge and skill of every kind readily to market.
# It secures the community against dearth and famine, and against excessive fluctuation in the prices of the necessaries of life.
# It promotes the spirit of the nation, as it has a tendency to destroy the Philistine spirit arising from isolation and provincial prejudice and vanity. It binds nations by ligaments, and promotes an interchange of food and of commodities, thus making it feel to be a unit. The iron rails become a nerve system, which, on the one hand, strengthens public opinion, and, on the other hand, strengthens the power of the state for police and governmental purposes.

List drew up proposals for a national railway network before the first steam locomotive ran between Nuremberg and Fürth. He suggested construction of a railway between Leipzig and Dresden which would soon become Germany&#x27;s first long distance railway. He is honored for his early promotion of the importance of railways with a bust in Leipzig main station as well as several streets named after him adjacent to railway stations (e.g. Friedrich-List-Platz). When the Swiss-German architect :de:Martin Mächler first proposed what is today Berlin main station in 1917, he suggested the new central interchange station of the German rail network be named in honor of List.

===Britain and world trade===
While List once had urged Germany to join other &#x27;manufacturing nations of the second rank&#x27; to check Britain&#x27;s &#x27;insular supremacy&#x27;, by 1841 he considered that the United States and Russia would become the most powerful countries—a view also expressed by Alexis de Tocqueville the previous year. List hoped to persuade political leaders in England to co-operate with Germany to ward off this danger. His proposal was perhaps not so far-fetched as might appear at first sight. In 1844, the writer of an article in a leading review had declared that &#x27;in every point of view, whether politically or commercially, we can have no better alliance than that of the German nation, spreading as it does, its 42 millions of souls without interruption over the surface of central Europe&#x27;.

The practical conclusion which List drew for Germany was that it needed for its economic progress an extended and conveniently bounded territory reaching to the seacoast both on north and south, and a vigorous expansion of manufacture and trade, and that the way to the latter lay through judicious protective legislation with a customs union comprising all German lands, and a German marine with a Navigation Act. The national German spirit, striving after independence and power through union, and the national industry, awaking from its lethargy and eager to recover lost ground, were favorable to the success of List&#x27;s book, and it produced a great sensation. He ably represented the tendencies and demands of his time in his own country; his work had the effect of fixing the attention, not merely of the speculative and official classes, but of practical men generally, on questions of political economy; and his ideas were undoubtedly the economic foundation of modern Germany as applied by the practical genius of Bismarck.

List considered that Napoleon&#x27;s &#x27;Continental System&#x27;, aimed just at damaging Britain during a bitter long-term war, had in fact been quite good for German industry. This was the direct opposite of what was believed by the followers of Adam Smith. As List put it: I perceived that the popular theory took no account of nations, but simply of the entire human race on the one hand, or of the single individual on the other. I saw clearly that free competition between two nations which are highly civilised can only be mutually beneficial in case both of them are in a nearly equal position of industrial development, and that any nation which owing to misfortunes is behind others in industry, commerce, and navigation ... must first of all strengthen her own individual powers, in order to fit herself to enter into free competition with more advanced nations. In a word, I perceived the distinction between cosmopolitical and political economy.

List&#x27;s argument was that Germany should follow actual English practice rather than the abstractions of Smith&#x27;s doctrines:

Had the English left everything to itself—&#x27;Laissez faire, laissez aller&#x27;, as the popular economical school recommends—the [German] merchants of the Steelyard would be still carrying on their trade in London, the Belgians would be still manufacturing cloth for the English, England would have still continued to be the sheep-farm of the Hansards, just as Portugal became the vineyard of England, and has remained so till our days, owing to the stratagem of a cunning diplomatist. Indeed, it is more than probable that without her [highly protectionist] commercial policy England would never have attained to such a large measure of municipal and individual freedom as she now possesses, for such freedom is the daughter of industry and wealth.

===Influences===
List&#x27;s hostility to free trade was first decisively shaped by the ideas of his friend Adolphe Thiers and other liberal protectionists in France. He was also later influenced by Alexander Hamilton and the American School rooted in Hamilton&#x27;s economic principles, including Daniel Raymond, but also by the general mode of thinking of America&#x27;s first Treasury Secretary, and by his strictures on the doctrine of Adam Smith. He opposed the cosmopolitan principle in the contemporary economical system and the absolute doctrine of free trade which was in harmony with that principle, and instead developed the infant industry argument, to which he had been exposed by Hamilton and Raymond. He gave prominence to the national idea and insisted on the special requirements of each nation according to its circumstances and especially to the degree of its development. He famously doubted the sincerity of calls to free trade from developed nations, in particular Britain: Any nation which by means of protective duties and restrictions on navigation has raised her manufacturing power and her navigation to such a degree of development that no other nation can sustain free competition with her, can do nothing wiser than to throw away these ladders of her greatness, to preach to other nations the benefits of free trade, and to declare in penitent tones that she has hitherto wandered in the paths of error, and has now for the first time succeeded in discovering the truth.

His idea of productive powers was influenced by the philosophy of productivity of Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling. He was acquainted with Robert Schumann and Heinrich Heine.

==Personal life==
During his time as a professor in Tübingen, List married the widow Karoline Neidhard, daughter of the poet and sister of the writer and editor Ludwig Georg Friedrich Seybold and Major General (1777–1833) in Wertheim on February 19, 1818. List received permission from the ruler and dispensation from the University of Tübingen to marry in Baden.
List had three children: 
* Emilie (born on December 10, 1818), who served as his secretary from 1833;
* Oskar (born on February 23, 1820); 
* Elise (born July 1, 1822) and
* Karoline, known as &quot;Lina&quot; (born January 20, 1829), who married history painter on March 5, 1855.

Emilie List was a close friend of Clara Schumann following their meeting in Paris in 1833, and they exchanged letters for the remainder of their lives. Elise List was a singer who performed under Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy and planned a concert tour with Franz Liszt which did not come to fruition.

== Legacy ==

List&#x27;s principal work is entitled &quot;Das Nationale System der Politischen Ökonomie&quot; (1841) and was translated into English as &quot;The National System of Political Economy&quot;.

Before 1914, List and Marx were the two best-known German economists and theorists of development, although Marx, unlike List, devised no policies to promote economic development.

This book has been more frequently translated than the works of any other German economist, except Karl Marx.

In Ireland he influenced Arthur Griffith of Sinn Féin and these theories were used by the Fianna Fáil government in the 1930s to instigate protectionism with a view to developing Irish industry.

Among others he strongly influenced was Sergei Witte, the Imperial Russian Minister of Finance, 1892–1903. Witte&#x27;s plan for rapid industrialisation was centred around railroad construction (the Trans-Siberian railroad for example) and a policy of protectionism. At the time, it was largely considered that Russia was a backward country with an underdeveloped economy. The boom which was seen during the 1890s was largely credited to Witte&#x27;s policy.

Angus Maddison noted that: As Marx was not interested in the survival of the capitalist system, he was not really concerned with economic policy, except in so far as the labour movement was involved. There, his argument was concentrated on measures to limit the length of the working day, and to strengthen trade union bargaining power. His analysis was also largely confined to the situation in the leading capitalist country of his day—the UK—and he did not consider the policy problems of other Western countries in catching up with the lead country (as Friedrich List did). In so far as Marx was concerned with other countries, it was mainly with poor countries which were victims of Western imperialism in the merchant capitalist era.
Heterodox economists, such as South Korean Ha-Joon Chang and Norwegian Erik Reinert, refer to List often explicitly when writing about suitable economic policies for developing countries. List&#x27;s influence among developing nations has been considerable. Japan has followed his model.

The international economic policy of Meiji Japan was a combination of Hideyoshi&#x27;s mercantilism and Friedrich List&#x27;s Nationale System der Politischen Ökonomie.

It has also been argued that Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s post-Mao policies were inspired by List, as well as recent policies in India.

China, under Deng, took on the clear features of a &#x27;developmental dictatorship under single-party auspices.&#x27; The PRC would then belong to a class of regimes familiar to the 20th century that have their ideological sources in classical Marxism, but better reflect the developmental, nationalist views of Friedrich List.

A 1943 German film &quot;The Endless Road&quot; portrayed List&#x27;s life and achievements. He was played by Eugen Klöpfer.

North Korea with its Juche ideology has likewise been considered by Dieter Senghaas to follow an &quot;unequaled&quot; model of development inspired by List&#x27;s &quot;production of productive forces.&quot;

<text>Swiftlets are birds from the four genera &quot;Aerodramus&quot;, &quot;Collocalia&quot;, &quot;Hydrochous&quot; and &quot;Schoutedenapus&quot;, which form the tribe Collocaliini within the swift family Apodidae. The group contains around thirty species mostly confined to southern Asia, south Pacific islands, and northeastern Australia, all within the tropical and subtropical regions. They are in many respects typical members of the Apodidae, having narrow wings for fast flight, with a wide gape and small reduced beak surrounded by bristles for catching insects in flight. What distinguishes many but not all species from other swifts and indeed almost all other birds is their ability to use a simple but effective form of echolocation to navigate in total darkness through the chasms and shafts of the caves where they roost at night and breed.

The nests of some species are built entirely from solidified threads of their saliva, which are edible and thus collected for human consumption as the famous Chinese delicacy, the bird&#x27;s nest soup.

== Description and ecology ==
The swift family remains one of the more complicated groups of birds in taxonomic research, but the swiftlet tribe is a rather well-defined group. Its internal systematics is confusing; the plumage is usually dull, with shades of black, brown, and gray; from their outward appearance, most species are very similar. Swiftlets have four toes, except the Papuan swiftlet which lacks the hallux (back toe). Their legs are very short, preventing the birds from perching, but allowing them to cling to vertical surfaces. Flight is mainly gliding due to very long primary feathers and small breast muscles. The larger &quot;Aerodramus&quot; swiftlets weigh about 14 grams and are 10 cm long.

Swiftlets are insectivores; hymenopterans and dipterans being the most abundant prey. Typically, they leave the cave during the day to forage and return to their roost at night. Males and females look similar; as usual in such cases, these birds are monogamous and both partners take part in caring for the nestlings. Males perform aerial displays to attract females and mating occurs at the nest. The breeding season overlaps the wet season, which corresponds to an increased insect population. Clutch size depends on the location and the food source, but it is generally not large; &quot;Aerodramus&quot; swiftlets lay 1 to 2 eggs. The eggs are a dull white color and are laid every other day. Many if not all species are colonial nesters; some build their nests in high, dark corners on cave walls. Swiftlets in temperate zones do migrate, but most &quot;Aerodramus&quot; swiftlets live in the tropical Indo-Pacific region and do not migrate. These birds usually remain in one cave or other roosting/nesting site. Some examples of caves include the Niah Caves at Niah National Park &amp; Gunung Mulu National Park which are all located in Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo.

The genus &quot;Aerodramus&quot; is of special interest due to its use of echolocation and its intricately constructed saliva nests which in some species contain no other material such as feathers, moss or twigs and are collected, selling at extremely high prices (see Bird&#x27;s nest soup). It has been argued that the high demand for these nests could have had an adverse effect on their populations, but other authorities have shown that modern techniques of nest farming have increased the bird population.

The use of echolocation was once used to separate &quot;Aerodramus&quot; from the non-echolocating genera &quot;Collocalia&quot; and &quot;Hydrochous&quot; (virtually nothing is known about &quot;Schoutedenapus&quot;). But recently, the pygmy swiftlet &quot;Collocalia troglodytes&quot; was discovered making similar clicking noises in and outside its cave. Characteristics of behavior, such as what materials other than saliva the nests contain, can be used to differentiate between certain species of &quot;Aerodramus&quot;.

== Echolocation ==
The genus &quot;Aerodramus&quot; was thought to be the only echolocating swiftlets. These birds use echolocation to locate their roost in dark caves. Unlike a bat&#x27;s echolocation, &quot;Aerodramus&quot; swiftlets make clicking noises that are well within the human range of hearing. The clicks consist of two broad band pulses (3–10 kHz) separated by a slight pause (1–3 milliseconds). The interpulse periods (IPPs) are varied depending on the level of light; in darker situations the bird emits shorter IPPs, as obstacles become harder to see, and longer IPPs are observed when the bird nears the exit of the cave. This behavior is similar to that of bats as they approach targets. The birds also emit a series of low clicks followed by a call when approaching the nests; presumably to warn nearby birds out of their way. It is thought that the double clicks are used to discriminate between individual birds. &quot;Aerodramus sawtelli&quot;, the Atiu swiftlet, and &quot;Aerodramus maximus&quot;, the black-nest swiftlet are the only known species which emit single clicks. The single click is thought be used to avoid voice overlap during echolocation. The use of a single click might be associated with an evolutionary shift in eastern Pacific swiftlets; determining how many clicks the Marquesan swiftlet emits could shed light on this. It was also discovered that both the Atiu swiftlet and the Papuan swiftlet emit clicks while foraging outside at dusk; the latter possibly only in these circumstances, considering that it might not nest in caves at all. Such behavior is not known to occur in other species, but quite possibly does, given that the Papuan and Atiu swiftlets are not closely related. However, it has recently been determined that the echolocation vocalizations do not agree with evolutionary relationship between swiftlet species as suggested by DNA sequence comparison. This suggests that as in bats, echolocation sounds, once present, adapt rapidly and independently to the particular species&#x27; acoustic environment.

Three hypotheses are considered to describe how echolocation evolved in the genus &quot;Aerodramus&quot; and, as determined more recently, other taxa in the Apodidae. One hypothesis states that echolocation evolved from an ancestral species of swiftlets and was lost in the genera which lack echolocation. A second hypothesis is that echolocation evolved independently several times. The third scenario involves a combination of the first two, i.e. a gain-loss-regain scenario.

Several functional subunits (like vocal muscles and brain areas) are needed to produce the echolocating system. Past studies have thought that the loss of one of these subunits was more likely to occur than acquiring all the traits needed to echolocate. Yet a recent study suggests that the echolocation subunits were mainly located in the central nervous system, while the subunits in the vocal apparatus were already present and capable of use before echolocation even evolved. This study supports the second hypothesis of independent evolution of echolocation in &quot;Aerodramus&quot; and &quot;Collocalia&quot;, with the subsequent evolution of complex behavior needed to complement the physical echolocation system, or even the third approach, as the vocal apparatus-parts of the echolocation system might even be inherited from some prehistoric nocturnal ancestor.

== Culinary use ==
Authentic bird&#x27;s-nest soup is made from nests of some species of swiftlet, mainly the edible-nest (or white-nest) swiftlet (&quot;Aerodramus fuciphagus&quot;) and the black-nest swiftlet. Instead of twigs, feathers and straw, these swiftlets make their nest only from strands of their gummy saliva, which hardens when exposed to air. Once the nests are harvested, they are cleaned and sold to restaurants. Eating swiftlet nest material is believed to help maintain skin tone, balance &quot;qi&quot; (&quot;life energy&quot;) and reinforce the immune system. It is also believed to strengthen the lungs and prevent coughs, improve the constitution and prolong life. The nutritional value of 100 g of dry nest includes 49.9 g of water-soluble protein (including amido nitrogen, monoamine nitrogen, non-amino nitrogen, arginine, humin, histidine, lysine and cysteine), 30.6 g carbohydrate (glycoprotein and mucin), 4.9 g iron, 2.5 g inorganic salt (including potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, phosphorus, silica and other trace elements), and 1.4 g fiber (Dictionary of Traditional Chinese Medicine, The History of Chinese Medicine and the Nutrition Table).

The energy contained in 100 g of swiftlet nest is 345 kcal. The nests are often served simmered in chicken broth.

Authentic bird&#x27;s-nest soup is quite popular throughout Asia. It is also extremely expensive; many western restaurants serve a less expensive version consisting of soup with noodles shaped to resemble a bird&#x27;s nest.

== Cave ecology ==
Guano from both the swiftlets and the many bats that inhabit the caves supports a huge array of specialized animals that feed on the dung. There are yet other creatures that have evolved to feed on these dung eaters as well as on the bats and the swiftlets themselves, including snakes that can climb the sheer walls to snatch a passing meal and huge carnivorous crickets that prey on chicks and bat pups. This cave fauna ecosystem is self-sustaining, the only link with the outside being the birds and the bats that bring the nutrients into the caves in the first place.

The Philippine municipality of El Nido in Palawan, known for its limestone cliffs and pristine beaches, is home to a thriving bird&#x27;s-nest market. The name El Nido is the Spanish term for literally &quot;The Nest&quot;. Many locals still practice manual climbing of the limestone caves to gather swiftlet nests.

== Species ==
The Papuan swiftlet is apparently closer to the waterfall swift than to the other &quot;Aerodramus&quot; species and probably best placed in a separate genus, whereas Thomassen &quot;et al.&quot; (2005) advocate reuniting all swiftlets in &quot;Collocalia&quot;. &quot;Schoutedenapus&quot; is one of the least-known genera of birds.

<text>The Hokuriku Main Line () is a railway line owned by the West Japan Railway Company (JR West) connecting Maibara Station in Maibara, Shiga, with Tsuruga Station in Tsuruga, Fukui. The line formerly extended as far as Naoetsu Station in Joetsu, Niigata; however, the section between Tsuruga Station and Naoetsu Station is now operated by several third-sector railway companies. The line links the Hokuriku region on the northern central coast of Honshu, the largest island of Japan, to the regions of Kansai, Tōkai, Kantō, and Tōhoku.

The Hokuriku Shinkansen was opened on 14 March 2015 between and , resulting in the section between Kanazawa Station and Naoetsu Station being transferred to a third-sector railway company. Narrow-gauge limited expresses such as the &quot;Thunderbird&quot; and &quot;Shirasagi&quot; are common sights along the line. A further extension of the Hokuriku Shinkansen from Kanazawa to Tsuruga opened on 16 March 2024, resulting in this section of the Hokuriku Main Line being transferred from JR West to the third-sector companies Hapi-Line Fukui and the IR Ishikawa Railway. Of the line&#x27;s original between Naoetsu and Maibara, just remains under the aegis of JR West.

The Hokuriku Main Line is double tracked and completely electrified: the section from Maibara to Tsuruga use 1,500 V DC power, while the section from Tsuruga to Kanazawa uses 20 kV AC, 60 Hz power.

JR Freight operated a small branch line for freight from Tsuruga Station to a container facility at the port of Tsuruga, but the services ceased in 2009.

==History==

The entire line was built by the Japanese Government Railway, with the first section opened being from Nagahama, on the shore of Lake Biwa to Tsuruga in 1882. The Maibara to Nagahama section opened in 1889, and the line was then opened progressively to Fukui (in 1896), Kanazawa (in 1898), and Toyama (in 1899). The next extension opened to Uozu in 1908, and to Tomari in 1910. At the northeastern end, the Naoetsu to Nadachi section opened in 1911, and was extended to Itoigawa the following year. The final section opened in 1913, completing the line.

On 14 March 2015 the name of Terai Station was changed to Nomi-Neagari Station.

===Double-tracking and realignments===
The initial section double-tracked was between Kanazawa and Tsubata in 1938, with the Maibara to Tsuruga section duplicated between 1957 and 1958. The rest of the line was double-tracked in stages between 1960 and 1969.

There have been three major line deviations. The first between Kinomoto and Tsuruga involving the Fukasaka tunnel opened in 1957 as a new line, with the original line remaining in service until the second new line opened in 1965, including the Shin-fukasaka tunnel at 5,173 m and a spiral section partially in tunnels to ease the ruling grade on the climb from Tsuruga to Biwako.

The second major deviation, between Tsuruga and Imajo opened in 1962 as a dual track line including the Hokuriku tunnel, providing a significantly straighter and faster line as well as avoiding numerous coastal sections vulnerable to disruption during severe weather events.

The third major deviation, the section between Uramoto and Arimagawa stations, was completed in 1969 as a dual track line, including the Kubiki tunnel, being the final section to be duplicated.

===Electrification===
The Tsuruga to Tamura section was electrified in 1957 at 20 kV AC. As Maibara was electrified at 1,500 V DC, steam locomotives hauled trains over the non-electrified section until it was electrified (at 1,500 V DC, with dual-voltage EMUs being used) in 1962, the year the 20 kV AC electrification was extended to Fukui, extending progressively to Kanazawa (in 1963), Toyama (in 1964), and Itoigawa (in 1965).

The Itoigawa to Naoetsu section was electrified at 1,500 V DC in 1969. DC was used in order to match the already-electrified Shin&#x27;etsu Main Line, which the Hokuriku Main Line joined at Naoetsu.

In 1991, in order to allow through-running with DC trains from the Tōkaidō Main Line at Maibara, the Tamura to Nagahama section was converted to 1,500 V DC, and the conversion was extended to Tsuruga in 2006.

===Former connecting lines===
* Tsuruga Station: The freight-only line to Tsuruga-minato Port was taken out of service in 2009. The ~300m section of track from the former junction to the Maizakicho level crossing has since been removed to facilitate construction of the Hokuriku Shinkansen extension from Kanazawa to Tsuruga. This line utilised a Token system for safeworking.
* Takefu Station: The Takeoka Light Railway opened a 7 km gauge line to Gobuichi in 1914, converting the line to gauge in 1924, and extending it 7 km to Tono-guchi. In 1941, the company merged with the Fukui Railway, which electrified the line at 600 V DC in 1948. The last 5 km closed in 1971, and the rest of the line closed in 1981.
* Sabae Station: The Ura Electric Railway opened a 20 km line, electrified at 600 V DC, to Oda between 1926 and 1929. The line also connected to the Fukubu Line at Mizuochi. The company merged with the Fukui Railway in 1945. As a result of double-tracking work on the Hokuriku Line at Sabae, the section to Mizuochi closed in 1962, with the rest of the line closing in 1973.
* Maruoka Station: The Maruoka Railway opened a 4 km 762 mm gauge line to Shin-Maruoka in 1915. In 1930, it was regauged to 1,067 mm and electrified at 600 V DC in conjunction with the opening of the Eiheiji Line to Shin-Maruoka from Arawa Onsen. The following year, a 3 km electrified line was opened from Maruoka to Nishi Nagata on the Mikuni Awara Line. The company merged with the Keifuku Railway in 1944, and the entire 7 km line closed in 1968.
* Awara Onsen Station:
An 8 km line to Mikuni on the Mikuni Awara Line operated between 1911 and 1972.

The Eiheiji Railway Co. opened a 25 km line to its namesake town in 1929, connecting with the Katsuyama Eiheiji Line at Higashi-Furuichi. The company merged with the Keifuku Electric Railway Co. in 1944. The Arawa Onsen - Higashi-Furuichi section closed in 1969, and the section to Eijeihi closed in 2002 after a fatal head-on collision resulted in services being suspended and subsequently never resumed.

* Daishoji Station: A 9 km gauge horse-drawn tramway opened to Yamanaka between 1898 and 1900. In 1913, the line was converted to 1,067 mm gauge and electrified. The line closed in 1971. The Hokuriku Railway Co. operated an 11 km line (known as the Contact Line) from Awazu Onsen (see Awazu station below) connected to the Uwano Line and this line between 1911 and 1963.
* Iburihashi Station: The Hokuriku Railway had two separate lines connecting here:
On the western side of the line, the 3 km line to Katayamazu opened in 1914 as a 915 mm gauge horse-drawn tramway. It was converted to 1,067 mm gauge and electrified in 1922, and closed in 1965.

On the eastern side, the 3 km electrified line to Uwano operated between 1911 and 1971.

* Awazu Station: The Awazu Onsen Railway opened a 4 km 762 mm gauge line to Awazu Onsen in 1911, converting the line to 1,067 mm gauge and electrifying it in 1916. The line closed in 1962.
* Komatsu Station: 
A 17 km 762 mm gauge line opened to the Ogoya copper mine between 1919 and 1920. The Meitetsu Railway took over management of the line in 1962, renaming the terminus Ogoya Onsen. The copper mine closed in 1971, and the line closed in 1977.

A 6 km horse-drawn tramway opened in 1906 to serve the Yusenji copper mine. Steam locomotion was introduced the following year, and the mine and line closed in 1918. In 1929, the line was regauged to 1,067 mm, electrified and reopened by the Hakusen Electric Railway, but it was declared bankrupt the following year. The Komatsu Electric Railway purchased the line at the receiver&#x27;s auction in 1935, and merged with the Hokuriku Railway in 1945. Patronage declined from 2,126,000 in 1967 to 623,000 in 1983, and as a result the line closed in 1986.

* Terai Station (present-day Nomi-Neagari Station): The Nomi Electric Railway opened a 17 km line, electrified at 600 V DC to Tsurugi on the Hokuriku Railroad Ishikawa Line in 1927. Flooding destroyed the Tedorigawa bridge in 1934, which was replaced nine months later. The company merged with the Hokuriku Railway in 1942. Freight services ceased in 1968, and the line closed in 1980.
* Matto station: In 1904, the 8 km, 915 mm gauge Matsukane horse-drawn tramway opened to Nomachi on the Hokuriku Railroad Ishikawa Line, and also connected with Nonoichi station on the same line (not the current JR West station of the same name, which opened in 1968), 3 km before the terminus. In 1916, the line was converted to 1,067 mm gauge and electrified at 600 V DC. The line was acquired by the Kanazawa Electric Railway in 1920, which merged with the Hokuriku Railway in 1942. The 3 km Nonoichi to Nomachi section closed in 1944, and the remaining 5 km line closed in 1955.
* Kanazawa Station: The 5 km 762 mm gauge Jinshi horse-drawn tramway opened in 1898, being converted to 1,067 mm gauge and electrified at 600 V DC in 1914. In 1920, the line was extended to Ono Port, and a further 2 km to Ono Minato in 1923. A 400m branch to Ryokuchi Park opened in 1930, passenger services on the branch ceasing in 1945 though the line remained to service a paper mill. The entire system closed in 1970.
* Isurugi Station: The Tonami Railway opened a 7 km line to Tsuzawa in 1915, and merged with the Kaetsu Railway in 1919, which extended the line 13 km to Shogawa-Cho in 1922, including a connection to the Johana Line at Fukuno. The line closed in 1972.
* Kurobe Station: The Toyo Aluminium Company planned to build Japan&#x27;s first aluminium refinery near Kurobe, and in 1922 opened a line electrified at 600 V DC to the proposed refinery site. The refinery did not proceed, so the company extended the line to Ishida Minato to serve an Onsen. The line closed in 1940.

== Hokuriku Shinkansen ==
The Hokuriku Shinkansen extension, from to , approximately parallels the route of the Hokuriku Main Line. With the opening of the Hokuriku Shinkansen, control of local passenger services on the sections of the Hokuriku Main Line running through Ishikawa, Toyama, and Niigata prefectures was transferred to the following three third-sector operating companies owned by the respective prefectures. An additional extension running between Kanazawa and Tsuruga opened on 16 March 2024.

* Hapi-Line Fukui (, Tsuruga - Daishoji)
* IR Ishikawa Railway (, - )
** IR Ishikawa Railway overtook an additional section of the Hokuriku Main Line between Kanazawa and Daishoji on 16 March 2024.
* Ainokaze Toyama Railway (, Kurikara - )
* Echigo Tokimeki Railway Company Nihonkai Hisui Line (, Ichiburi - )

<text>Area studies, also known as regional studies, is an interdisciplinary field of research and scholarship pertaining to particular geographical, national/federal, or cultural regions. The term exists primarily as a general description for what are, in the practice of scholarship, many heterogeneous fields of research, encompassing both the social sciences and the humanities. Typical area study programs involve international relations, strategic studies, history, political science, political economy, cultural studies, languages, geography, literature, and other related disciplines. In contrast to cultural studies, area studies often include diaspora and emigration from the area.

==History==
While area studies had been taught at the Seminar for Oriental Languages of the Friedrich-Wilhelm University Berlin (now Humboldt-University) since 1887, interdisciplinary area studies became increasingly common in the United States and in Western scholarship after World War II. Before that war American universities had just a few faculty who taught or conducted research on the non-Western world. Foreign-area studies were virtually nonexistent. After the war, liberals and conservatives alike were concerned about the U.S. ability to respond effectively to perceived external threats from the Soviet Union and China in the context of the emerging Cold War, as well as to the fall-out from the decolonization of Africa and Asia.

Area studies programs originated within the U.S. Office of Strategic Services, the predecessor agency to the CIA.

In this context, the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Carnegie Corporation of New York convened a series of meetings producing a broad consensus that to address this knowledge deficit, the U.S. must invest in international studies. Participants argued that a large brain trust of internationally oriented political scientists and economists was an urgent national priority. There was a central tension, however, between those who felt strongly that, instead of applying Western models, social scientists should develop culturally and historically contextualized knowledge of various parts of the world by working closely with humanists, and those who thought social scientists should seek to develop overarching macrohistorial theories that could draw connections between patterns of change and development across different geographies. The former became area-studies advocates, the latter proponents of modernization theory.

The Ford Foundation would eventually become the dominant player in shaping the area studies program in the U.S. In 1950, the foundation established the prestigious Foreign Area Fellowship Program (FAFP), the first large-scale national competition in support of area-studies training in the U.S. From 1953 to 1966, it contributed $270 million to 34 universities for area and language studies. Also during this period, it poured millions of dollars into the committees run jointly by the Social Science Research Council and the American Council of Learned Societies for field-development workshops, conferences, and publication programs. Eventually, the SSRC-ACLS joint committees would take over the administration of FAFP.

Other large and important programs followed Ford&#x27;s. Most notably, the National Defense Education Act of 1957, renamed the Higher Education Act in 1965, allocated funding for some 125 university-based area-studies units known as National Resource Center programs at U.S. universities, as well as for Foreign Language and Area Studies scholarships for undergraduate students and fellowships for graduate students.

Meanwhile, area studies were also developed in the Soviet Union.

==Controversy within the field==
Since their inception, area studies have been subject to criticism—including by area specialists themselves. Many of them alleged that because area studies were connected to the Cold War agendas of the CIA, the FBI, and other intelligence and military agencies, participating in such programs was tantamount to serving as an agent of the state. Some argue that there is the notion that U.S. concerns and research priorities will define the intellectual terrain of area studies. Others insisted, however, that once they were established on university campuses, area studies began to encompass a much broader and deeper intellectual agenda than the one foreseen by government agencies, thus not American centric.

Arguably, one of the greatest threats to the area studies project was the rise of rational choice theory in political science and economics. To mock one of the most outspoken rational choice theory critics, Japan scholar Chalmers Johnson asked: Why do you need to know Japanese or anything about Japan&#x27;s history and culture if the methods of rational choice will explain why Japanese politicians and bureaucrats do the things they do?

Following the demise of the Soviet Union, philanthropic foundations and scientific bureaucracies moved to attenuate their support for area studies, emphasizing instead interregional themes like &quot;development and democracy&quot;. When the Social Science Research Council and the American Council of Learned Societies, which had long served as the national for raising and administering funds for area studies, underwent their first major restructuring in thirty years, closing down their area committees, scholars interpreted this as a massive signal about the changing research environment.

==Institutions==

Some entire institutions of higher education (tertiary education) are devoted solely to area studies such as School of Oriental and African Studies or the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies in Japan. 

An institution which exclusively deals with Area Studies is the German Institute of Global and Area Studies in Germany.

<doc id="489095" wikidata="Q950589" url="?curid=489095" title="Douglas C-133 Cargomaster">
<text>The Douglas C-133 Cargomaster is an American large turboprop cargo aircraft built between 1956 and 1961 by the Douglas Aircraft Company for use with the United States Air Force. The C-133 was the USAF&#x27;s only production turboprop-powered strategic airlifter, entering service shortly after the Lockheed C-130 Hercules, which is designated a tactical airlifter. It provided airlift services in a wide range of applications, being replaced by the C-5 Galaxy in the early 1970s.

==Design and development==
The C-133 was designed to meet the requirements for the USAF&#x27;s Logistic Carrier Support System SS402L for a new strategic transport. The aircraft differed considerably from the C-74 Globemaster and C-124 Globemaster IIs that had preceded it. A high-mounted wing, external blister fairings on each side for the landing gear, and rear-loading and side-loading doors ensured that access to, and the volume of, the large cargo compartment were not compromised by these structures. The cargo compartment (90 ft/27 m in length and 12 ft/3.7 m high) was pressurized, heated, and ventilated.

The Cargomasters went directly into production as C-133A; no prototypes were built. The first Cargomaster flew on 23 April 1956. The first C-133As were delivered to the Military Air Transport Service (MATS) in August 1957 and began flying MATS air routes throughout the world. Two C-133s established transatlantic speed records for transport aircraft on their first flights to Europe. The fleet of 50 aircraft proved itself invaluable during the Vietnam War. The Cargomaster soldiered on until the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy entered service in the early 1970s. The C-133 was then retired and most airplanes were cut up within months of being delivered to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Tucson, Arizona, after their final flights in 1971.

Fifty aircraft (35 C-133A and 15 C-133B) were constructed and put into service with the USAF. A single C-133A and a C-133B were built and kept at Douglas Long Beach as &quot;test articles&quot;. They had no construction numbers or USAF tail numbers.

The C-133 had large tail doors and side doors and a large, open cargo area. The C-133A carried many large and heavy loads, including Atlas and Titan ICBMs, although it was not designed specifically to transport ICBMs. It may, indeed, have been the reverse. The C-133 design was frozen by 1955 in order to build the airplanes that first flew in April 1956. The designs of both the Atlas and Titan were not firm until after 1955, when their contracts were signed. With the C-133B, the rear cargo doors were modified to open to the side (petal doors), making ICBM loading much easier. Air transporting the ballistic missiles such as the Atlas, Titan and Minuteman was much less expensive, safer and faster than road transport. Several hundred Minuteman and other ICBMs were airlifted to and from their operational bases by C-133s. The C-133 also transported Atlas, Saturn and Titan rockets to Cape Canaveral for use as launch boosters in the Gemini, Mercury and Apollo space programs. After the Apollo capsules splashed down, they were airlifted in C-133s from Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia, or Hickam AFB, Hawaii, to Ellington AFB, Texas, or to California.

==Operational history==

The C-133 was for many years the only USAF aircraft capable of hauling very large or very heavy cargo. Despite the Douglas C-124 Globemaster II&#x27;s capabilities, there was much cargo that it could not carry because of its configuration with a cargo deck 13 ft (4 m) off the ground and its lower, though substantial, engine power. The C-133 continued in service after the formation of the USAFs Military Airlift Command on 1 January 1966.

By 1971, shortly before the introduction of the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, the Cargomaster was obsolete as well as being worn out, and all were withdrawn from service. The C-133 had a 10,000-hour airframe that was life-extended to 19,000 hours. Severe vibration caused critical stress corrosion of the airframes to the point that the aircraft were beyond economical operation. The Air Force managed to keep as many of the C-133 fleet in service as possible until the C-5 entered squadron service.

C-133s set a number of unofficial records, including records for military transport aircraft on trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific routes. Among the longest were non-stop flights from Tachikawa Airfield, Japan, to Travis Air Force Base, California (17:20 hours on 22 May 1959, 5,150 mi/8,288 km, 297.2 mph/478.3 km/h), and Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii, to Dover Air Force Base, Delaware, in about 16 hours (4,850 mi/7,805 km 303.1 mph/487.8 km/h). The only FAI officially sanctioned record was in December 1958, when C-133A 62008 lifted a payload of 117,900 lb (53,480 kg) to an altitude of 10,000 ft (3,048 m) at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware.

==Accidents and incidents==
Early in its life-cycle the airplane developed a reputation of crashing. Crew members referred to it as a &quot;widowmaker&quot;. Some would not fly in the C-133, since the cause of the crashes was unknown. Several issues were discovered after crash investigations. The first issue was with the auto-pitch controller on the propellers. A time delay was added to relieve stress on the nose casing. The second issue was that the stall characteristics gave little warning to the crew. The left wing was found to stall before the right wing. The fix was simple, a small strip of metal was attached to the right wing causing it to stall simultaneously with the left wing. As the aircraft neared the end of its 10,000-hour life-cycle the last C-133B crash occurred on 6 February 1970. It was determined the airframe split at the cargo door. The final fix was a band around the airframe to strengthen; the end of the C-133 was near. The C-5A Galaxy debuted in 1971 and marked the end of the C-133. Of 50 aircraft built, nine were lost in crashes and one was destroyed in a ground fire.

This aircraft had previously been at the Strategic Air Command Museum at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska for many years and was donated to the AMC Museum when the SAC Museum moved from its on base location in the late 1990s to its new location near Ashland, Nebraska.
;C-133A AF Ser. No. 56-1999: N199AB, previously owned by Cargomaster Corporation, was never certificated by the Federal Aviation Administration for civilian operation, and could only be flown as a government aircraft, mostly for the State of Alaska. N199AB was based at ANC and was flown as a transport until 2004, carrying cargo, such as pipeline sections. It also flew frontend loader trash trucks and heavy equipment to the Alaskan bush, i.e., Point Hope, Point Lay, Wainright, Barrow, Deadhorse, Barter Island, and Anatovich Pass in April 2006. In August 2008, it flew its last flight to the Jimmy Doolittle Air &amp; Space Museum at Travis Air Force Base, Fairfield, California, where it has been restored to USAF markings and maintained on static display.
* Not on display:Two C-133As have been in storage at Mojave Air and Space Port, California, since the 1970s. They are N201AR (ex-AF Ser. No. 56-2001) and N136AR (ex- AF Ser. No.54-0136). They are owned by Cargomaster Corporation, based at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, Alaska.

<text>The was a limited express train operated by the West Japan Railway Company (JR West) between and in Japan until March 2011, using portions of the Tōkaidō Main Line, Kosei Line, and Hokuriku Main Line.

The characters literally mean &quot;thunder/lightning&quot; and &quot;bird&quot; in Japanese, but the compound word 雷鳥 (&quot;raichō&quot;) is the name of &quot;Lagopus muta&quot;, the rock ptarmigan. The &quot;raichō&quot; bird inhabits the Tateyama Mountain Range and is the prefectural bird of Toyama, Nagano, and Gifu Prefectures.

==History==
The &quot;Raichō&quot; service was first introduced on 25 December 1964 as a limited express operating between Osaka and Toyama.

From 11 March 1989, &quot;Super Raichō&quot; services were introduced, operating between Kobe/Osaka and Toyama/Wakura Onsen.

From the start of the 20 April 1995 timetable revision, new 681 series EMUs were introduced on Osaka to Toyama services, named &quot;Super Raichō (Thunderbird)&quot;. These became simply &quot;Thunderbird&quot; from March 1997.

JR West introduced a &quot;women-only&quot; section in the reserved-seating cars of &quot;Raichō&quot; and &quot;Thunderbird&quot; trains from October 2007 following the rape of a female passenger by a man in a train toilet while travelling on a &quot;Thunderbird&quot; service in August 2006.

The last remaining &quot;Raichō&quot; service was discontinued from the start of the 12 March 2011 timetable revision, with all trains subsequently using the &quot;Thunderbird&quot; name.

==History==
From the start of the 20 April 1995 timetable revision, new 681 series EMUs were introduced on Osaka to Toyama services, named &quot;Super Raichō (Thunderbird)&quot;. These became simply &quot;Thunderbird&quot; from March 1997.

The last remaining &quot;Raichō&quot; service was discontinued from the start of the 12 March 2011 timetable revision, with all trains subsequently using the &quot;Thunderbird&quot; name.

From the start of the revised timetable on 14 March 2015, with the opening of the Hokuriku Shinkansen, all &quot;Thunderbird&quot; services were shortened for the first time to run between Osaka, Kanazawa and Wakura-Onsen.

From the start of the revised timetable on 16 March 2024, all &quot;Thunderbird&quot; services were shortened for the second time to run between Osaka and Tsuruga with the opening of the extension of the Hokuriku Shinkansen between Kanazawa and Tsuruga. With effect from the same date, all non-reserved seating was discontinued on all &quot;Thunderbird&quot; services.

==Incidents==
On 3 August 2006, a woman was raped by a 36-year-old man in a train toilet while travelling on the &quot;Thunderbird&quot; 50 service (just after Fukui Station), despite the car being occupied by approximately 40 other passengers. As a result, JR West introduced a &quot;women-only&quot; section in the reserved-seating cars of &quot;Raichō&quot; and &quot;Thunderbird&quot; trains from October 2007, and JR East added prominent &quot;SOS&quot; stickers inside all of its trains in June 2007. On 17 January 2008, the district court in Otsu sentenced the man to 18 years in prison.

==Future developments==
All of the 681 and 683 series trainsets used on &quot;Thunderbird&quot; limited express services are scheduled to undergo a programme of refurbishment from autumn 2015 until the end of fiscal 2018.

<doc id="489119" wikidata="Q392770" url="?curid=489119" title="Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States">
<text>The Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS; French: &quot;Organisation des États de la Caraïbe orientale&quot;, OECO) is an inter-governmental organisation dedicated to economic harmonisation and integration, protection of human and legal rights, and the encouragement of good governance between countries and territories in the Eastern Caribbean. It also performs the role of spreading responsibility and liability in the event of natural disaster.

The administrative body of the OECS is the Commission, which is based in Castries, the capital of Saint Lucia.

OECS operates an economic union within the larger CARICOM economic union. Eight members operate as a currency union - the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union, using the Eastern Caribbean dollar.

== History ==
OECS was created on 18 June 1981, with the Treaty of Basseterre, which was named after the capital city of St. Kitts and Nevis. OECS is the successor of the Leewards Islands&#x27; political organisation known as the West Indies Associated States (WISA).

One prominent aspect of OECS economic bloc has been the accelerated pace of trans-national integration among its member states.

The seven protocol members of the OECS, as well as two of the four associate members—Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands—are either full or associate members of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and were among the second group of countries that joined the CARICOM Single Market and Economy (CSME). Martinique is currently negotiating to become an associate member of the Caribbean Community.

==Projects==
===Passport===
A common OECS Passport was originally planned for January 1, 2003 but its introduction was delayed. At the 38th OECS Authority Meeting in January 2004, the Secretariat was mandated to have the two companies expressing an interest in producing the common passport (De La Rue Identity Systems and the Canadian Banknote Company) make presentations at the next (39th) Authority Meeting. At the 39th Meeting the critical issue of the relationship between the OECS passport and the CARICOM passport was discussed and at the 40th OECS Authority Meeting in November 2004, the OECS Heads of Government agreed to give CARICOM a further 6 months (until May 2005) to introduce a CARICOM Passport. Failure to introduce the CARICOM Passport by that time would have resulted in the OECS moving ahead with its plans to introduce the OECS Passport. As the CARICOM Passport was first introduced in January 2005 (by Suriname) then the idea of the OECS Passport was abandoned. Had the passport been introduced however it would not have been issued to Economic Citizens within the OECS states.

It would also be unknown if the islands under British sovereignty would join the scheme.

===Economic union===
The decision to establish an economic union was taken by OECS Heads of Government at the 34th meeting of the Authority held in Dominica in July 2001. At the 35th meeting of the Authority in Anguilla in January 2002, the main elements of an economic union implementation project were endorsed. The project was expected to be implemented over a two-year period with seven of the nine OECS member states (i.e. Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines) participating in the economic union initiative. The remaining two member states, Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands, would not have participated immediately, but would have requested time to consider the issue further. In 2003, work had been initiated on the central issue of the creation of new Treaty arrangements to replace the Treaty of Basseterre which established the OECS. Among the elements of the project was the creation of a technical committee for a draft OECS Economic Union Treaty. This technical committee was inaugurated on May 4, 2004 and began designing the draft Treaty.

==== OECS Economic Treaty ====
The new OECS Economic Union Treaty was finally presented at the 43rd OECS Meeting in St. Kitts on June 21, 2006. The Authority requested changes to allow a role for national parliamentary representatives (both government and opposition) of the Member States in the form of a regional Assembly of Parliamentarians. This body, it was felt, was necessary to act as a legislative filter to the Authority in its law making capacity. The Heads further directed that the Treaty be reviewed by a meeting of members of the Task Force, Attorneys General, the draftsperson for the Treaty and representatives of the OECS Secretariat.

The presentation of the Treaty at the Meeting was followed by the signing of a Declaration of Intent to implement the Treaty by the Heads of Government or their representatives (except that of the British Virgin Islands). It was agreed in the Declaration, that implementation of the Treaty would occur only after a year of public consultation, through a mass national and regional education programme with strong political leadership and direction. According to the Declaration, the Treaty was to be signed, and the Economic Union was to be established by July 1, 2007.

==== Revised treaty ====
This intended deadline was missed, however, and after the signing of the &quot;Revised Treaty of Basseterre Establishing the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States Economic Union&quot; on June 18, 2010, the newest target date of January 21, 2011 was met when five of the six independent signatory Member States ratified the Treaty. These were Antigua and Barbuda (December 30, 2010), St. Vincent and the Grenadines (January 12, 2011), St. Kitts and Nevis (January 20, 2011), Grenada (January 20, 2011) and Dominica (January 21, 2011). In order for the Treaty to have entered into force at least four of the independent Member States must have ratified it by January 21, 2011. Montserrat had received entrustments from the United Kingdom to sign the Treaty but is unlikely to be in a position ratify the Treaty before a new constitution comes into force in the territory. Following the need of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank to temporarily assume control of two indigenous commercial banks in Anguilla, the Chief Minister of Anguilla, Hubert Hughes, announced on August 12, 2013 that Anguilla will seek to join the OECS Economic Union as soon possible in order to fully participate in the strategy of growth conceived by the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (which was crafted within the context of the Economic Union). He was supported in his position by St. Lucia&#x27;s Prime Minister, Dr. Kenny Anthony, who also called on Anguilla to join the Economic Union to complement its membership of the Currency Union.

==== Provisions of the Treaty ====
The provisions of the Economic Union Treaty prior to its ratification were expected to include: 
* The free circulation of goods and trade in services within the OECS
* Free movement of labour by December 2007
* The free movement of capital (via support of the money and capital market programme of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank)
* A regional Assembly of Parliamentarians
* A common external tariff

Some of these provisions would already have been covered to some extent by the CSME, but some, such as the Assembly of Parliamentarians, would be unique to the OECS. Although some of the provisions would seem to duplicate efforts by the CSME, the Declaration of Intent and statements by some OECS leaders, acknowledge the CSME and give assurance that the OECS Economic Union would not run counter to CARICOM integration but that it would become seamlessly integrated into the CSME. To this end, the OECS Heads of Government agreed that steps should be taken to ensure that the OECS Economic Union Treaty would be recognised under the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas, just as the original Treaty of Chaguaramas had recognised the Treaty of Basseterre. 
This was achieved in 2013 at the Twenty-Fourth Inter-Sessional Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government of CARICOM held in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, from 18–19 February 2013. At that conference CARICOM leaders adopted the OECS’ Revised Treaty of Basseterre into CARICOM’s Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas, which St. Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister, Ralph Gonsalves said would effectively give CARICOM member states the opportunity of integrating initially with the OECS and taking a seemingly quicker path to integration. In order to achieve this the Conference agreed that the Inter-Governmental Task Force (IGTF) revising the Treaty of Chaguaramas would recognise the provisions of the Treaty establishing the Economic Union of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS). The IGTF was mandated to refer back to the Conference at its next meeting on this issue.

The Economic Union Treaty&#x27;s provisions are now expected to establish a Single Financial and Economic Space within which goods, people and capital move freely; harmonize monetary and fiscal policies Member States are expected continue to adopt a common approach to trade, health, education and environment, as well as to the development of such critical sectors as agriculture, tourism and energy. The Economic Union Treaty (or Revised Treaty as it is sometimes known) will also create two new organs for governing the OCES; The Regional Assembly (consisting of members of parliaments/legislatures) and The Commission (a strengthened Secretariat). The free movement of OECS nationals within the subregion is expected to commence in August 2011 after a commitment towards that goal by the Heads of Government at their meeting in May 2011.

This was achieved on schedule with the six independent OECS members and later Montserrat with nationals being allowed to enter the participating Member States without hindrance and remain for an indefinite period in order to work, establish businesses; provide services or to reside. The free movement of OECS nationals throughout the Economic Union is underpinned by legislation and is facilitated by administrative mechanisms This is achieved by OECS nationals entering the special immigration lines for CARICOM nationals when traveling throughout the Economic Union and presenting a valid photo ID and completed Entry/Departure form whereupon the immigration officer shall grant the national entry for an indefinite period save where the national presents a security risk or where there exists some other legal basis for prohibiting entry.

== Membership ==
OECS currently has eleven members which together form a continuous archipelago across the Leeward Islands and Windward Islands. Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, Guadeloupe and Martinique are only associate members of OECS. Diplomatic missions of the OECS do not represent the associate members. For all other purposes, associate members are treated as equals of full members.

Six of the members were formerly colonies of the United Kingdom. Three others, Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, and Montserrat remain overseas territories of the UK while Martinique and Guadeloupe are French departments and regions of France. Eight of the eleven members are constitutional monarchies with King Charles III as their current monarch (Dominica is a republic with a President). There is no requirement for the members to have been British colonies; however, the close historical, cultural and economic relationship fostered by almost all of them having been British colonies is as much a factor in the membership of the OECS as their geographical proximity.

All seven full members are also the founding members of the OECS, having been a part of the organisation since its founding on 18 June 1981. The British Virgin Islands was the first associate member, joining on 22 November 1984 and Anguilla was the second, joining in 1995. Martinique became an associate member on April 12, 2016 becoming the first non-British or formerly British territory to join the OECS. Guadeloupe joined as an associate member of the OECS on March 14, 2019 at a Special Meeting of the OECS Authority held on that island on March 14–15, 2019. In 2019 the OECS Authority agreed to approve the transition of Saint-Martin from observer status to associate membership by the end of December 2019.

The list of full and associate members of the OECS is as follows:

Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, and Montserrat are British Overseas Territories. Thus, foreign relations are the responsibility of the UK government.
Guadeloupe and Martinique are Republic of France Overseas departments and regions. Thusly foreign relations are the responsibility of the French government.

=== Possible future memberships ===
Although almost all of the current full and associate members are past or present British dependencies, other islands in the region have expressed interest in becoming associate members of the OECS. The first was the United States Virgin Islands, which applied for associate membership in February 1990 and requested that US Federal Government allow the territory to participate as such. At that time, it was felt by the US government that it was not an appropriate time to make such a request. However, the US Virgin Islands remained interested in the OECS and, as of 2002, stated that it would revisit the issue with the US government at a later date. In 2001, Saba, an island of the Netherlands Antilles, decided to seek membership in the OECS. Saba&#x27;s Island Council had passed a motion on May 30, 2001 calling for Saba&#x27;s membership in the organisation and subsequently on June 7, 2001, the Executive Council of Saba decided in favour of membership. Saba&#x27;s senator in the Netherlands Antilles parliament was then asked to present a motion requesting the Antillean parliament to support Saba&#x27;s quest for membership. In addition to the support from the Antillean parliament, Saba also required a dispensation from the government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to become an associate member of the OECS. Saba&#x27;s bid for membership was reportedly supported by St. Kitts and Nevis and discussed at the 34th meeting of OECS leaders in Dominica in July. Also in 2001, Sint Maarten, another part of the Netherlands Antilles, explored the possibility of joining the OECS. After learning of Saba&#x27;s intentions to join, St. Maarten suggested exploring ways in which Saba and St. Maarten could support each other in their pursuit of membership.

None of the prospective members have become associate members as yet, but Saba, St. Eustatius and St. Maarten do participate in the meetings of the Council of Tourism Ministers (as the Forum of Tourism Ministers of the Eastern Caribbean, along with representatives of Saint-Martin, Saint Barthélemy, Martinique and Guadeloupe).

===Political union with Trinidad and Tobago===
On 13 August 2008 the leaders of Trinidad &amp; Tobago, Grenada, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent &amp; the Grenadines announced their intention to pursue a sub-regional political union within CARICOM.
As part of the preliminary discussions the Heads of Government for the involved states announced that 2011 would see their states entering into an economic union. This was however derailed by a change of government in Trinidad and Tobago in 2010.

===Venezuela seeking membership===
In 2008 the heads of the OECS also received a request from Venezuela to join the grouping.

The OECS Director General at the time Len Ishmael confirmed Venezuela&#x27;s application was discussed at the 48th Meeting of the OECS Authority held in Montserrat. But she said OECS decision-makers within the region were yet to determine whether membership should be granted for Venezuela. Since that application, Membership was not granted as it has been limited to the Eastern Caribbean archipelago.


== Composite &amp; Organs ==
===Secretariat===

The functions of the Organisation are set out in the Treaty of Basseterre and are coordinated by the Secretariat under the direction and management of the Director General.

The OECS functions in a rapidly changing international economic environment, characterised by globalisation and trade liberalisation which are posing serious challenges to the economic and social stability of their small island members.
It is the purpose of the Organisation to assist its Members to respond to these multi-faceted challenges by identifying scope for joint or coordinated action towards the economic and social advancement of their countries.
The restructuring of the Secretariat was informed by considerations of cost effectiveness in the context of the need to respond to the increasing challenges placed on it, taking into account the limited fiscal capacities of its members. The Secretariat consists of four main Divisions responsible for: External Relations, Functional Cooperation, Corporate Services and Economic Affairs. These four Divisions oversee the work of a number of specialised institutions, work units or projects located in six countries: Antigua/Barbuda, Commonwealth of Dominica, St Lucia, Belgium, Canada, and the United States of America.

In carrying out its mission, the OECS works along with a number of sub-regional and regional agencies and institutions. These include the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB); the Caribbean Community (Caricom) Secretariat; the Caribbean Regional Negotiating Machinery (RNM) and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB).

=== Director General ===
The authority within the OECS Secretariat is led by the Director General. The current Director General of the OECS is Dr. Didacus Jules (Registrar and Chief Executive Officer of the Barbados-based Caribbean Examinations Council), who took his new position on 1 of May 2014. The former Dr. Len Ishmael demitted the office at the end of December 2013.

== Central Bank ==
Many of the OECS member-states are participants in the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) monetary authority. The regional central bank oversees financial and banking integrity for the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States economic bloc of states. Part of the bank&#x27;s oversight is maintaining the financial integrity of the East Caribbean dollar (XCD). Of all OECS member-states, only the British Virgin Islands, Guadeloupe and Martinique do not use the East Caribbean dollar as their de facto native currency.

All other members belong to the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union.

==Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court==
The Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court (ECSC), which was created during the era of WISA, today handles the judicial matters in the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States. When a trial surpasses the stage of High Court in an OECS member state, it can then be passed on to the ECSC at the level of Supreme court. Cases appealed from the stage of ECSC Supreme Court will then be referred to the jurisdiction of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The Caribbean Court of Justice (CCJ) was established in 2003, but constitutional changes need to be put in place before the CCJ becomes the final Court of Appeal.

===Other agencies===
* Eastern Caribbean Civil Aviation Authority

==Security==
The OECS sub-region has a military support unit known as the Regional Security System (RSS). It is made up of the independent countries of the OECS along with Barbados and Guyana. The unit is based in the island of Barbados and receives funding and training from various countries including the United States, Canada and the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

== Foreign missions ==
==Health – Pharmaceutical Procurement Service==
The Pharmaceutical Procurement Service, also known as the Eastern Caribbean Drug Service, procures medicines and allied health equipment on behalf of the member States. It has an 840 item product portfolio based on the regional formulary. it is said to generate savings of $5 million a year.

==Symbols, flag and logo==
The flag and logo of the OECS consists of a complex pattern of concentric design elements on a pale green field, focused on a circle of nine inwardly pointed orange triangles and nine outwardly pointed white triangles. It was adopted June 21, 2006, and first raised on that day at Basseterre, St. Kitts and Nevis.

<text>The Detroit People Mover (DPM) is a elevated automated people mover system in Detroit, Michigan, United States. The system operates in a one-way loop on a single track encircling downtown Detroit, using Intermediate Capacity Transit System linear induction motor technology developed by the Urban Transportation Development Corporation. In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

The People Mover is supplemented by the QLINE streetcar, which connects the system with Midtown, New Center, and the Detroit Amtrak station. The system also connects to DDOT and SMART bus routes as part of a comprehensive network of transportation in metropolitan Detroit.

== History ==

=== Background ===
In 1964 the creation of the federal Urban Mass Transportation Administration (UMTA) allowed stronger investment into cities&#x27; declining transit systems. By the late 1960s there was gaining momentum for exploring new forms of transit to improve the quality of urban life, and UMTA&#x27;s scope was expanded for development of such systems. In the early 1970s two automated guideway transit (AGT) demonstrators were sponsored; a &quot;group rapid transit&quot; concept, the Vought Airtrans, at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport; and a &quot;personal rapid transit&quot; concept, Morgantown Personal Rapid Transit, at the University of West Virginia. Additionally, four companies would receive grants to develop automated systems to be demonstrated at Transpo &#x27;72. While these AGT systems ended up being popular with zoos, airports, and abroad, they failed to attract popularity among municipalities and planning organizations.

=== Planning ===
In the early 1970s pressure was mounting for a high-capacity rapid transit network for Detroit. In early 1972 Southeastern Michigan Transportation Authority (SEMTA) and Southeast Michigan Council of Governments (SEMCOG) commenced a study of such a network. During the study, it became apparent that automated people movers were useful in complimenting transit services, recommending systems for Downtown, Medical Center &amp; Wayne State, Fairlane Town Center, Southfield, and Metro Airport. The study, released in 1974, would ultimately see realization as the QLine.

In 1975, following the failure to produce any large-scale development from the AGT program and increased pressure to show results, UMTA created the Downtown People Mover Program (DPM) and sponsored a nationwide competition that offered federal funds to cover much of the cost of planning and construction of such a system. UMTA reviewed thirty-five full proposals. From these, they selected proposals from Cleveland, Houston, Los Angeles, and St. Paul. In addition, UMTA decided they would approve proposals from Baltimore, Detroit, and Miami to develop People Mover systems if they could do so with existing grant commitments. Of the seven cities with UMTA approval for their People Mover proposals, only Detroit and Miami persevered to build and operate systems.

The Ford Motor Company was involved in one of the designs of the People Mover and had hired AlScott Service Company to design and build a room size working model of the system. This model was used for Ford&#x27;s proposals in their attempt to build the system. Ford previously developed the ACT, a rubber-tired monorail, which was exhibited at Transpo &#x27;72; a production version of the system ran at Fairlane Town Center in nearby Dearborn from 1976 to 1988.

The People Mover was intended to be the downtown distributor for a proposed city and metro-wide light rail transit system for Detroit in the early 1980s; however, funding was scaled back. President Gerald Ford had promised $600 million in federal funds. Plans included a subway line along Woodward Avenue that would turn into a street level train at McNichols and eventually go all the way to Pontiac, with additional rail lines running along Gratiot and a commuter line between Detroit and Port Huron. Inability of local leaders to come to an agreement led to the $600 million commitment being withdrawn by the Reagan administration, though plans for the People Mover still moved forward. At the time of planning, the system was projected to have a ridership of 67,700 daily.

During construction, the system was initially owned by the Southeastern Michigan Transportation Authority (SEMTA). It was acquired by the Detroit Transportation Corporation (DTC) on October 4, 1985. DTC was incorporated in 1985 as a Michigan Public Body Corporate for the purpose of acquiring, owning, constructing, furnishing, equipping, completing, operating, improving, enlarging, and/or disposing of the Central Automated Transit Systems (CATS). DTC was created by the City of Detroit, Michigan pursuant to Act 7 of Public Acts of 1967 and is a component unit of the City of Detroit and accounts its activity as per proprietary funds.

=== Opening ===

The Downtown People Mover opened on July 31, 1987. A ceremony was held the Financial District station, with appearances by Mayor Coleman Young and People Mover supporter Max Fisher. After opening speeches and awards, Young and Fisher cut a five-foot-long cake shaped like a People Mover car, and boarded the inaugural run. The train broke through a green ribbon accompanied by the simultaneous release of 10,000 balloons, also shaped like a People Mover car. A block party was hosted below on Larned Street, and the service was open to the public by 1:30pm. That weekend trains were usually packed, with passengers waiting around 20 minutes to board at some stations. Transit officials controlled crowds, encouraging only taking one round-trip to let others ride. The system carried an estimated 2,000 passengers per hour on Friday and Saturday. Rides were free for the first week, with a $0.50 fare going into effect on August 8.

In the first year, an average of 11,000 riders used the People Mover each day; the one-day record was 54,648. Originally, the People Mover System was operated and maintained by UTDC on a month-to-month basis; DTC took over operations and maintenance on November 18, 1988.

=== Service disruptions from construction ===
On October 24, 1998, the implosion of the J. L. Hudson Department Store damaged part of the nearby People Mover track and forced the system to shut down. Limited service resumed on January 23, 1999 with the system split into two lines: a &quot;red line&quot; running between Times Square &amp; Millender Center, and a &quot;green line&quot; between Greektown and Cobo Center. Both lines were shortened by one stop in August of that year. In November 1999, the loop was restored, and Times Square station reopened.

However, Grand Circus Park and Greektown remained closed to accommodate construction of Greektown Casino and the closure of the David Whitney Building.

Greektown station reopened in January 2000, following the casino&#x27;s completion. In April 2001, Grand Circus Park reopened, restoring service to whole system.

During construction of Compuware World Headquarters, the Cadillac Center station was temporarily closed as part of the parking structure was built around it. The station remained largely untouched and unmodified, although the entrance was slightly expanded, and a walkway to the garage was added.

In 2002, the original Renaissance Center station was closed and demolished. This was part of a multi-year renovation of the Renaissance Center, in which concrete berms in front of the complex were removed to make it more inviting to the rest of downtown. The system ran limited service due to the gap in the track during construction, leading to a drop in ridership, before the new station and track opened on September 3, 2004. The original station&#x27;s tile artwork was destroyed in the demolition, though its creator, George Woodman, designed a replacement work for the new station.
The Grand Circus Park station closed for renovations on August 16, 2014, as part of renovation work in the David Whitney Building. A new station lobby was added with a direct entrance to the building, and an elevator was added to provide step-free access. Trains continued to operate in a one-way loop, bypassing Grand Circus Park, for most of the station&#x27;s closure, though the line was briefly split into two segments (with transfers at Millender Center) while part of the track was closed. The Grand Circus Park station officially reopened on June 13, 2015. A connecting QLine station was added shortly thereafter, opening with the system in May 2017.

=== Changes in direction ===

The system originally ran counter-clockwise. It changed directions to run clockwise in August 2008, following a short closure to replace sections of the track. This change in direction was intended to reduce the time needed to connect between more popular destinations. The switch to clockwise also reduced the time required to complete the loop, as the route, run clockwise, has one short, relatively steep uphill climb, and then coasts downhill for most of the route, allowing trains to use gravity to accelerate.

In late December 2019, the People Mover tested counter-clockwise operation. The system began running counter-clockwise on weekends in February 2020, and then returned to counter-clockwise operation full-time on March 1.

=== COVID-19 shutdown and reopening ===
The People Mover shut down on March 30, 2020, due to reduced ridership amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

After a planned 2021 reopening was postponed, the system resumed limited service on May 20, 2022, running six days a week, stopping at only six of the 13 stations (Michigan Avenue, Huntington Place, West Riverfront, Millender Center, Greektown, Grand Circus Park). Broadway and Financial District reopened thirteen days later on June 2, followed by Renaissance Center and Fort/Cass on September 14, Bricktown on November 21, Cadillac Center on May 23, 2023, and Times Square on June 26, 2023.

To attract riders, fares were initially waived from reopening day through August, and later extended through October 2022.

In October 2023, DTC announced that its administrative headquarters would move from the Buhl Building to the nearby Guardian Building.

=== System upgrades and free service pilot ===
In December 2023, DTC&#x27;s board of directors approved a one-year pilot program to eliminate fares on the People Mover, supported by a large donation from a corporate sponsor. The program commenced on January 2, 2024, and following an evaluation of the program, in which it was found to have increased system ridership, it was extended through the end of 2025. Priority Waste, a waste management company based in nearby Clinton Township, was announced as the presenting sponsor in March 2024.

Also in December 2023, DTC announced plans to acquire railcars and other surplus equipment from the Toronto Transit Commission, following the decommissioning of the Scarborough RT, a similar system, the prior July.

The system&#x27;s communication infrastructure was upgraded in early 2024, in preparation for expected large crowds during the 2024 NFL draft. Realtime tracking was added, and each station received upgraded public address and video surveillance systems, plus new passenger information displays and interactive kiosks. Color-changing lights were installed on guideway support columns along Larned Street and Grand Circus Park, and five stations received large exterior murals as part of the Detroit City Walls public art program.

== Fares ==

The People Mover is currently free to ride, with no fares charged from January 2024 until at least the end of 2025, as part of a sponsored pilot program.

When fares were charged, the regular fare was $0.75 per trip, raised from $0.50 in November 2011. Fares were paid at turnstiles with quarters, or with tokens dispensed by vending machines in the stations. Children aged five and under were allowed to ride for free with a paying adult. Monthly and annual passes were sold for $10 and $100 respectively, available on the People Mover&#x27;s website or at the agency&#x27;s administrative office. Discounted tokens and passes were available for seniors and disabled riders.

== Cost-effectiveness and use ==
In 2006, it was reported that the People Mover cost $8.3 million annually in city and state subsidies to run, and the system has drawn criticism for its cost-effectiveness. In every year between 1997 and 2006, the cost per passenger mile exceeded $3, and was $4.28 in 2009, compared with Detroit bus routes that operated at $0.82 (for comparison, the New York City Subway operates at $0.30 per passenger mile). Edward Glaeser, in his 2011 book, &quot;Triumph of the City&quot;, referring to high cost of maintenance, calls the Mover &quot;perhaps the most absurd public transit project in the country&quot;.

The Mackinac Center for Public Policy reported that according to a 2004 survey, fewer than 30% of the riders were Detroit residents and that Saturday ridership (likely out-of-town residents) dwarfed that of weekday usage.

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the People Mover generated about $1 million to $1.5 million in revenue annually from fares, conventions, and advertising space. In 2019, about 50% to 60% of riders were office workers in the downtown area, while others included weekend social riders, area residents, tourists, and convention-goers.

== Expansion proposals ==
There have been proposals to extend the People Mover northward to the New Center and neighborhoods not within walking distance of the city&#x27;s downtown. A proposal was put forward by Marsden Burger, former manager of the People Mover, to double the length of the route by extending the People Mover along Woodward Avenue to West Grand Boulevard and into the New Center area. New stops would have included the Amtrak station, Wayne State University, the Detroit Medical Center, and Henry Ford Hospital. The plan was proposed at a tentative cost of $150–200 million, and would have been paid for by a combination of public and private financing.

Much of the proposed route to the New Center was ultimately adopted by the QLine streetcar, which opened in 2017.

== Rolling stock ==
The People Mover&#x27;s fleet consists of twelve automated Intermediate Capacity Transit System Mark I cars, built by the Urban Transportation Development Corporation in Kingston, Ontario. The model is also used on the SkyTrain in Vancouver, and was also operated on the now-decommissioned Scarborough RT in Toronto.

The trains originally bore a white livery with green and yellow stripes. Beginning in the early 2000s, the cars began to be wrapped with advertisements; by the 2010s, every car was adorned with an ad wrap. They usually operate in two-car trains, but are not in married pairs, and are capable of operation as single cars.

=== Replacement ===
DTC plans to replace the existing fleet with twelve used railcars of the same model from the Toronto Transit Commission. These railcars operated on the Scarborough RT until its closure, and were extensively refurbished and upgraded in the 2010s, allowing them a longer service lifespan than the People Mover&#x27;s existing cars, despite being of similar age.

The purchase of these railcars was first announced in December 2023, and also includes surplus parts to repair the People Mover&#x27;s existing vehicles in the interim. Delivery and integration of the newly purchased cars is expected to take 18 months, with the first of them slated to enter service in late 2025 or early 2026.

== Operations and maintenance ==
The People Mover&#x27;s operations and maintenance facility is located at the Times Square station. Cars enter the garage via a siding, which branches off from the main line to a second platform at Times Square. This siding allows the system to be used in a two-way bypass manner when part of the circular track is closed. Maintenance equipment is lifted up to track level by crane, but not stored with the DPM cars.

== Governance ==
The People Mover is owned and operated by the Detroit Transportation Corporation (DTC), a public body corporate funded primarily by, but independent of, the Detroit city government.

The agency is currently headquartered on the 29th floor of the Guardian Building, near the Financial District station. It is governed by a six-member Board of Directors, which appoints an executive General Manager to oversee day-to-day operations. The Board consists of four officers from the Mayor of Detroit&#x27;s cabinet, the president of the Detroit City Council, and the chair of the board of directors of SMART.

=== Transit Police and security ===

The People Mover is patrolled by its own dedicated police agency, the Detroit Transit Police, operating as a division of DTC, independent of the Detroit Police Department.

From 2014 to 2024, the Transit Police were the primary law enforcement agency serving DDOT, providing police services on the agency&#x27;s buses and at its transit centers. This contracted arrangement began in March 2014 in response to rising crime on buses, and a shortage of Detroit Police Department officers amid the Detroit bankruptcy. The Detroit Police took over DDOT police duties on July 1, 2024, with a newly formed division dedicated to transit operations.

The Transit Police also provided police services on the QLINE from the system&#x27;s opening in 2017 until February 1, 2024, when those services were also transferred to the Detroit Police.

From 2022 to 2024, regular security patrols on the People Mover were conducted by private security guards, as the Transit Police were primarily dedicated to DDOT and the QLINE. DTC initially hired Detroit-based City Shield Security Services for the People Mover, before switching to Securitas in April 2023.

=== Labor relations ===
Some DTC employees are represented by Teamsters Local 214.

== Ridership ==
The system was designed to move up to 15 million riders a year. In 2008 it served approximately 2 million riders. This meant the system averaged about 7,500 people per day, about 2.5 percent of its daily peak capacity of 288,000. In 2006, the Mover filled less than 10 percent of its seats.

Among the busiest periods was the five days around the 2006 Super Bowl XL, when 215,910 patrons used the service. In addition to major downtown concerts and sporting events, other high ridership times include the week of the annual North American International Auto Show in January and the Youmacon anime convention at the end of October, ever since the convention expanded in 2012 to use Huntington Place in addition to the Renaissance Center. The system had 92,384 riders during the 2014 extended con weekend.


== Incidents ==
In 1990, a train derailed at Cadillac Center after a manhole cover fell onto the track.

On January 22, 2015, at approximately 10:10 PM, one of the cars jumped a rail, hitting the platform at Times Square. No injuries were reported, and the system was shut down for 17 hours for an investigation. According to a DTC press release, a bracket beneath the train dislodged and caught underneath the rear car, causing the train to disengage from the track. A door was dislodged upon impact.

=== 2016 accident ===
On May 15, 2016, 53-year-old Michael Whyte fell onto the track between the cars of a stopped train at Times Square. The train then departed automatically as normal, dragging Whyte along the track to his death. Following the incident, bollards were added to the system&#x27;s platforms, preventing passengers from falling into the space between the cars. Whyte&#x27;s family filed a lawsuit, alleging negligence on the part of DTC. Whyte&#x27;s death is, to date, the only fatal accident in the People Mover&#x27;s history.

== Stations ==

The network has 13 stations. As the system runs in a one-way loop with a single track, each station only has one side platform, except for Times Square, which has a siding leading to the system&#x27;s garage and an island platform.

=== Public art ===
Originally, the 13 stations were not planned to have any distinctive features. However, in 1984, after construction had recently begun, Irene Walt assembled a volunteer committee to persuade the project agency to include artwork in each station. Called the Downtown Detroit People Mover Art Commission (later known as Art in the Stations), they raised $2 million to finance the project. As a result, there are 18 new original pieces of art spread throughout the stations, plus a piece from 1903 that had previously been in storage, on permanent loan from the Detroit Institute of Arts.

The commission&#x27;s efforts and art installation were documented in a 30-minute film, &quot;Art in the Stations,&quot; by Sue Marx and Pamela Conn, who had recently won an Academy Award for the short documentary Young at Heart. &quot;Art in the Stations&quot; premiered at the Detroit Institute of Arts in 1989. In 2004, a coffee table book by Walt, also titled &quot;Art in the Stations&quot;, was published, with photographs by Balthazar Korab and information on all the station artwork and the artists who created them.

<doc id="489124" wikidata="Q2409661" url="?curid=489124" title="National Revolutionary Front for the Liberation and Reconstruction of Haiti">
<text>The National Revolutionary Front for the Liberation and Reconstruction of Haiti () was a rebel group in Haiti that controlled most of the country following the 2004 Haitian coup d&#x27;état. It was briefly known as the &quot;Revolutionary Artibonite Resistance Front&quot;, after the country&#x27;s central Artibonite region, before being renamed on February 19, 2004, to emphasize its national scope.

The group can be considered an alliance between two elements within the coup: armed anti-government gangs and former soldiers of the disbanded Haitian army. The most prominent of the gangs was the one based in Gonaïves, formerly known as the &quot;Cannibal Army&quot;, who had once supported Lavalasian-party President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide but later turned against him. The coup initiated with the Cannibal Army&#x27;s capture of Gonaïves on February 5, 2004. It has been led by Buteur Metayer since the murder (allegedly on Aristide&#x27;s orders) of Buteur&#x27;s brother, Amiot Metayer, in late 2003.

The group’s name had been used a fear-tactic to spread intimidation who aimed to “eat the spoils of the Lavalasian state”, were not &quot;actual&quot; cannibals.

Following the capture of Gonaïves, the rebels quickly moved into several neighboring towns, expelling the police from them. Some of these, such as Saint-Marc, were retaken by the police and pro-Aristide militants within days. However. On February 14, the rebels were reinforced by opponents of the government who had returned from exile in the Dominican Republic: 20 former soldiers, led by Louis-Jodel Chamblain, a former militia leader who headed army death squads in 1987 and a militia known as the Front for the Advancement and Progress of Haïti (FRAPH), which killed and maimed at least 4,000 people, and raped and tortured thousands more in the early 1990s. By February 17, the rebel forces had captured the central town of Hinche, near the Dominican border. According to reports, this attack was led by Chamblain. The rebels also controlled most of the roads connecting the central Artibonite province with the north and south of the country.

It has been alleged that, from 2001 to 2004, the United States Government funded and implemented training operations for a group of 600 anti-Aristide paramilitary soldiers, with the approval of the Dominican Republic&#x27;s president, Hipolito Mejia. This training was allegedly carried out by roughly 200 members of the US Special Forces. Among the soldiers trained during this operation were known human-rights violators, Guy Philippe and Louis-Jodel Chamblain. 

On February 4, 2004, the paramilitary groups led by Buteur Metayer, Guy Philippe, and Louis-Jodel Chamblain began marching on the capital of Haiti, Port-au-Prince. On February 22, the rebels captured the country&#x27;s second-largest city, Cap-Haïtien. By February 25, nearly the entire north was in rebel hands, and the rebels were threatening to attack the capital, Port-au-Prince. On February 29, Aristide resigned under intense pressure from the United States Government and an impending attack from rebel groups, including the National Revolutionary Front for the Liberation of Haiti. Aristide was Haiti&#x27;s first democratically elected president. April 24, 2004, Louis-Jodel Chamblain surrendered to Haitian authorities after being convicted in absentia of the slaughter of dozens in Haiti in 1999.

<text>Canadian Pacific Hotels (CPH) was a division of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) that primarily operated hotels across Canada, since passenger revenue made a significant contribution to early railway profitability. CPR restructured the division as a subsidiary in 1963. In 1988, CPR purchased the Canadian National Hotels chain, making Canadian Pacific Hotels and Resorts the nation&#x27;s largest hotel owner. In 1998, all CPH properties were branded as either Fairmont or Delta.

In 2006, Kingdom Hotels International and Colony Capital purchased Fairmont, consolidating their hotel brands to form Fairmont Raffles Hotels International (FRHI), which in turn became a subsidiary of AccorHotels in 2016. In 2007, BC Investment Management Corp. bought Delta Hotels, which was purchased by Marriott International in 2015.
==Early hotels==
Since passenger revenue made a significant contribution to railway profitability, facilities, such as hotels, were essential for attracting passenger traffic. The three earliest locations (Mount Stephen House, Glacier House and North Bend) were initially only dining stops, necessary because steep railway grades made hauling a dining car uneconomical. Thomas Sorby&#x27;s design for these three hotels was inspired by Swiss Chalets.
 
Hotels were established mainly at locations that connected with other passenger rail or ferry routes, but some rural locations, especially in the Canadian Rockies/Selkirk Mountains, became tourist destinations in their own right. After the success of the original Banff Springs Hotel, described as a &quot;Tudor chalet in wood&quot;, CPR lobbied the government to create Banff National Park, the first in Canada. Indisputably, national parks protected CPH&#x27;s commercial interests in such localities. The opportunity to participate in mountaineering excursions, led by professional Swiss guides, featured in CPH&#x27;s promotion of the respective accommodation. Scenic images, often including a hotel, illustrated the CPH publicity brochures.

Urban and township land sales financed the construction of the early hotels. In the late-19th to early-20th century, CPH commonly adopted a châteauesque architectural style for building, or enlarging, significant hotels. The earliest example was Château Frontenac. Notable features included steeply pitched copper roofs, blue-green from oxidation, ornate gables, dormer windows, and an irregular placement of towers and turrets.

The visual appeal of this design prompted other railway companies to imitate it. CPR, or its later competitors, Canadian Northern Railway and Grand Trunk Pacific Railway that became Canadian National Railway (CN), built grandiose railway hotels in every major Canadian city. However, CPR quickly reverted to a simpler style of a flat roof and limited ornamental features when designing most city hotels.

With growing automobile traffic, and tourists seeking cheaper accommodation, CPH retained only the more profitable urban and destination hotels. The resort hotels opened in summer only. Year round opening began in 1969 for Banff Springs Hotel, and in 1974 for Chateau Lake Louise.

CPR restructured the division as a subsidiary in 1963.

==Bungalow camps &amp; tea houses==
Each bungalow camp, comprising a group of cabins with a communal lodge, was in a relatively remote forest area, reached by hiking or horseback. Although initially catering to an elite, mainly American, tourist, they ultimately attracted a broader audience. The log cabin at Lake Louise (1891–1893) was perhaps a forerunner to this concept. The subsequent adoption of the log design not only created a pioneer appearance, but also provided the necessary insulation for a cold mountainous region. CN copied the concept at Jasper Park Lodge. Despite the rustic cabin exteriors, the interiors contained the modern comforts of the period. Presented as more adventurous than a hotel stay, it was scarcely roughing it. Although primarily in the west, Ontario also had three camps.

The CPH rest structures and teahouses, at scenic locations along nearby trails, similarly adopted a rustic design. Teahouses existed at Summit Lake, Twin Falls, Natural Bridge, Lake Agnes and the Plain of Six Glaciers, the latter two still operating. Most rest houses were one-storey cabins at lower elevations.

CPH initially encouraged automobile travel by building camps along the Banff-Windermere Highway, which opened in 1923. In the 1930s, the term &quot;bungalow&quot; disappeared from the Canadian lexicon. When automobile vacationers switched to inexpensive campgrounds at this time, CPH disposed of the least profitable bungalow camps, followed by the remainder in the 1950s.

==Later hotels==
After a 24-year break in building or acquiring properties, CPH constructed a series of hotels and motels during 1955–1999. The larger ones mostly adopted the &quot;Chateau&quot; prefix. Several international properties were operated, before exiting that market.

==Chains acquired==
In 1988, CPR purchased the Canadian National Hotels chain, making Canadian Pacific Hotels and Resorts the nation&#x27;s largest hotel owner. In 1998, CPR purchased the Canadian Delta Hotels chain and the international Princess Hotels chain. The following year, San Francisco-based Fairmont Hotels and Resorts chain was acquired. Minority shareholders were Kingdom Hotels (USA) Ltd. and Maritz Wolff &amp; Co, each holding a 16.5 per cent interest. All CPH properties were branded as either Fairmont or Delta. In 2001, CPH was renamed Fairmont Hotels and Resorts. Later that year, Canadian Pacific Limited spun off all of its subsidiaries into separately traded companies, which included Fairmont Hotels and Resorts.

In 2006, Kingdom Hotels International and Colony Capital, which also owned the Raffles and Swissôtel chains, bought Fairmont. The following year, BC Investment Management Corp. bought Delta Hotels. In 2015, AccorHotels acquired a controlling interest in FRHI, adding the Fairmont, Raffles, and Swissôtel chains to its Luxury Hotel Brands portfolio. That year Marriott International bought the Delta chain.

<text>Tzniut ( , , ; &quot;modesty&quot; or &quot;privacy&quot;; ) describes the character trait of modesty and discretion, as well as a group of Jewish laws pertaining to conduct. The concept is most important within Orthodox Judaism.

==Description==
&quot;Tzniut&quot; includes a group of Jewish laws concerned with modesty of both dress and behavior. In the Babylonian Talmud, Rabbi Elazar Bar Tzadok interprets the injunction at Micah 6:8 to &quot;go discreetly with your God&quot; as referring to discretion in conducting funerals and weddings. The Talmud then extends his interpretation: &quot;If in matters that are generally performed in public, such as funerals and weddings, the Torah instructed us to go discreetly, matters that by their very nature should be performed discreetly, such as giving charity to a poor person, how much more so must one take care to do them discreetly, without publicity and fanfare&quot;.

In the legal dimension of Orthodox Judaism, the issue of &quot;tzniut&quot; is discussed in more technical terms: how much skin may a person expose, and so on. These details underscore the concept of &quot;tzniut&quot; as a code of conduct, character, and awareness, which in practice is more noticeable among women than men.

==Dress==
===Gender-specific garb===
Originating from the Biblical pair of commands (Deut. 22:5) regarding &quot;male and female garb.&quot; Aside from pants and zippers, there is also the matter of buttons on clothing. Classic clothing has the button on the left side for women and on the right side for men. Some Jews reverse that, with men buttoning right on the left as part of Tzniut. The principal guiding point of &quot;tzniut&quot; regarding dress is that a Jew should not dress in ways that attract undue attention. That does not mean dressing poorly but means neither men nor women should dress in a way that overly emphasizes their physical appearance or attracts undue attention. There are many different interpretations of &quot;tzniut&quot; and so people from different communities dress differently.

===Community-specific garb===
Orthodox Judaism requires both men and women to substantially cover their bodies. According to many opinions, that involves covering the elbows and knees.

In Haredi communities, men wear long trousers and usually long-sleeved shirts; most will not wear short sleeves at all. Haredi Ashkenazi practice discourages sandals without socks both inside and outside the synagogue, but Haredi Sefardi communities tend to permit sandals at least outside of synagogue. Dress inside a synagogue and, according to many, in public should be comparable to that worn by the community when it meets royalty or the government.

Haredi women wear blouses covering the elbow and collarbone and skirts covering the knees while standing and sitting. The ideal sleeve and skirt length varies by community. Some women try not to follow fashion, but others wear fashionable but modest clothing. Haredi women avoid skirts with slits but prefer kick pleats. They also avoid overly eye-catching colors, especially red, as well as tight clothing. The prohibition on wearing red is Ashkenazic, originally formulated by Joseph Colon Trabotto, Moses Isserles, and Shabtai HaKohen. In modern interpretation, Moshe Feinstein restricts the prohibition to women, but many other authorities apply it to both genders. Many will wear only closed-toe shoes and always wear stockings or tights, the thickness of which varies by community.

Modern Orthodox women also usually adhere to &quot;tzniut&quot; and dress in a modest fashion (as compared to general society), but their communal definition does not necessarily include covering their elbows, collarbones, or knees, and may allow for wearing pants although most Modern Orthodox women will, when in front of men or in public, wear skirts that cover their knees, preferably loose ones, and cover their shoulders and cleavage.

Modern Orthodox men&#x27;s dress is often indistinguishable from their non-Orthodox peers, apart from them wearing a skullcap. They may wear short-sleeved shirts, and sometimes even shorts. Sandals without socks are generally not worn in a synagogue but are usually accepted in Modern Orthodox and Religious Zionist communities in Israel for daily dress for both men and women.

Conservative Judaism formally encourages modest dress. While day-to-day dress often simply reflects trends in wider society, many Conservative synagogues expect somewhat more modest dress (although not necessarily as stringent as in Orthodox Judaism) for synagogue attendance, and may have specific dress requirements to receive synagogue honors (such as being called for a Torah reading).

Reform Judaism has no religious dress requirements.

The style of dress also involves cultural considerations aside from religious requirements. Members of Conservative and Reform synagogues may abide by dress codes generally ranging from business casual to informal. There are many Orthodox synagogues (especially in Israel) in which dress, while meeting religious modesty requirements, is quite casual. Many Haredi and Hasidic communities have special customs and styles of dress that serve to identify members of their communities but regard those special dress features as more customary to their particular communities than a general religious requirement expected of all observant Jews.

Further cultural considerations include the increasing use of modest dress as an act of female empowerment and self-actualization, which are not directly related to religious observance.

==Head covering==
Jewish law governing &quot;tzniut&quot; requires married women to cover their hair in the presence of men other than their husband or close family members. Such covering (known as the &quot;tichel&quot; or &quot;mitpachat&quot;) is common practice among Orthodox Jewish women.

During the time of Moses, the Bible records that it was normative for women to wear a head covering (cf. ). In Numbers 5:18, the sotah (meaning &quot;one who goes astray&quot;) ritual, in which the head of a woman accused of adultery is uncovered (made &quot;parua&quot;), is explicated, implying that normally a woman&#x27;s head is covered; the Talmud thus teaches that the Torah (Pentateuch) commands women to go out in public with their heads covered. This headcovering worn during biblical times was a veil or headscarf.

In the Old Testament&#x27;s Book of Daniel, Susanna wore a headcovering and wicked men demanded that it be removed so that they might lust after her (cf. ). records that Rebecca, while traveling to meet Isaac, &quot;did not flaunt her physical beauty&quot; but &quot;veiled herself, increasing her allure through an outward display of modesty.&quot; The removal of a woman&#x27;s veil in the passage of is linked with nakedness and shame. The biblical book Song of Songs records &quot;the erotic nature of hair from the verse, &#x27;Your hair is as a flock of goats&#x27; (&quot;Song of Songs&quot;, 4:1), i.e., from a verse praising her beauty.&quot; Jewish law has stipulated that a married woman who uncovered her hair in public evidenced her infidelity.

==Female singing voice==
===Orthodox Judaism===
In Orthodox Judaism, men are generally not allowed to hear women sing, a prohibition called &quot;kol isha&quot; (literally &quot;a woman&#x27;s voice&quot;). The Talmud classifies that as &quot;ervah&quot; (literally &quot;nakedness&quot;). The majority view of halakhic authorities is that the prohibition applies at all times and forbids a man from praying or studying the Torah in the presence of a woman who is singing; it is similar to other prohibitions classified as &quot;ervah&quot;. A minority view holds that the prohibition of praying or studying in the presence of &quot;kol isha&quot; applies only while the Shema Yisrael prayer is being recited.

There is a debate between &quot;poskim&quot; whether the prohibition applies to a recorded female voice if the singer cannot be seen, the woman is not known to the man who is listening, and he has never seen her or a picture of her. There are also opinions, following Samson Raphael Hirsch and Azriel Hildesheimer, that exclude singing in mixed groups from this prohibition, such as synagogue prayer or dinner-table &quot;zemirot&quot;, based on the idea that the female voice is not distinctly heard as separate from the group in those cases.

Yehiel Yaakov Weinberg and Rabbi David Bigman of Yeshivat Ma&#x27;ale Gilboa hold that the &quot;kol isha&quot; prohibition does not apply to women singing &quot;zemirot&quot;, songs to children, and lamentations for the dead because in those contexts, men do not derive sexual pleasure from the woman&#x27;s voice. Rabbi Mosheh Lichtenstein of Yeshivat Har Etzion also rules this way.

===Other denominations===
Conservative Judaism interprets the relevant passage of the Talmud as expressing a rabbi&#x27;s opinion, rather than imposing a requirement.

Reform Judaism fundamentally reconsidered the status of women within Judaism in a series of synods from 1837 onward in both Europe and the United States and formally abolished most distinctions between men and women in the observance of Jewish life, particularly concerning dress and public participation. It no longer regards that law as applicable to modern times.

==Touch==

In Orthodox Judaism, men and women who are not married and not closely related are generally forbidden to touch each other sensually. A person who refrains from touching the opposite sex is said to be &quot;shomer negiah&quot;. Any touching but especially in an affectionate manner (&quot;b&#x27;derech chiba&quot;) is prohibited.

Opinions are divided regarding a quick handshake in a business setting: some authorities (mainly of Modern Orthodox background) permit it, but other people (nearly all Haredim, and many other Orthodox Jews) prohibit it. The question is, &quot;What is sensual?&quot; One may, however, touch certain relatives (parents, children, grandparents, grandchildren) to whom one is presumed not to be sexually attracted. Whether or not children adopted at a young age are included in the prohibition is a matter of dispute and varies from case to case. One may touch one&#x27;s spouse outside the niddah period, but any married couples will also not publicly touch one another.

Conservative and Reform Judaism do not follow those laws.

==Yichud==

In Orthodox Judaism, men and women who are not married to each other and are not immediate blood relatives are forbidden to enter into a secluded situation (&quot;yichud&quot;) in a room or area that is locked and private. That measure is taken to prevent the possibility of sexual relations, which are prohibited outside of marriage. According to some authorities, it applies even between adoptive parents and adoptive children over the age of maturity, but others are more lenient with children adopted from a young age. Seclusion does not consist of merely being alone in a room together, and it is only if the situation is private, with no one else expected to enter, that the restriction applies. Originally, the prohibition applied only to married women who were secluded with men other than their husbands, but it was later extended to include single women. According to the Talmud, the extension occurred in the time of King David, when his son Amnon raped his other son Absalom&#x27;s sister, Tamar. On the issue of elevators, opinions vary; some allow &quot;yichud&quot; in an elevator for a time of no more than 30 seconds, but others forbid it under all circumstances, partly because of the possibility of an elevator getting stuck. The laws concerning &quot;yichud&quot; are complicated and detailed, and especially so for women in modern contexts, promoting the suggestion to reread them as a nonspecific mandate for personal space at a time that society can generally acknowledge the darkest aspects of the human sexual psyche in today&#x27;s social interactions.

Conservative and Reform Judaism do not regard those rules as applicable.

==Synagogue services==

In Orthodox Judaism, men and women are not allowed to mingle during prayer services, and Orthodox synagogues generally include a divider, a &quot;mechitza&quot;, to create separate men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s sections. The idea comes from the old Jewish practice when the Temple in Jerusalem stood: there was a women&#x27;s balcony in the &quot;Ezrat Nashim&quot; to separate male and female spectators at the special Sukkot celebrations. There is also a prophecy in Zechariah (12:12) that mentions men and women mourning separately. The Talmud took that account and inferred that if men and women should be separate in times of mourning, they certainly should be separate in times of happiness.

&quot;Mechitzot&quot; are usually seen in Orthodox synagogues but never in Reform ones. Original German Reform synagogues had balconies although in modified form. While many Conservative synagogues also had balconies or separate seating for women in the past, most of them have switched to &quot;family seating&quot; (mixed seating of relatives) in the 1960s. Today, the Conservative movement puts a strong emphasis on egalitarianism so that men and women have equal roles in prayer services. However, non-egalitarian services, separate seating, and the use of a &quot;mechitza&quot; are still considered valid options for Conservative congregations.

==Dancing==
Orthodox Jews following the laws on &quot;negiah&quot; do not participate in mixed dancing, as it entails sensual touch and may also be considered immodest even if there is no physical contact.

In 2013, the Rabbinical Court of the Ashkenazi Community in the Haredi city of Beitar Illit ruled against Zumba (a type of dance fitness) classes although they were held with a female instructor and all-female participants. It stated: &quot;Both in form and manner, the activity [Zumba] is entirely at odds with both the ways of the Torah and the holiness of Israel, as are the songs associated with it.&quot;

==Observance==
There are several levels to the observance of physical and personal &quot;tzniut&quot; according to Orthodox Judaism, as derived from various sources in &quot;halakha&quot;. Observance of the rules varies from aspirational to mandatory to routine across the spectrum of Orthodox stricture and observance.

* Not dwelling on lascivious or immoral thoughts.
* Not staring at members of the opposite sex, particularly any part of the opposite sex&#x27;s &quot;private&quot; anatomy.
* Keeping the majority of one&#x27;s body covered in respectable clothing at all times.
* Avoiding the company of uncouth individuals or situations if an atmosphere of levity and depravity prevails.
* Avoiding pictures or scenes that are likely to be sexually arousing.
* Refraining from touching a person of the opposite sex.
* Not looking at animals copulating.
* Not hugging or kissing one&#x27;s spouse in public; among Haredim, all physical contact is avoided between spouses in public. The primary reason is not to arouse jealousy and hence the evil eye in those without a partner. That is a law between men, and not primarily between man and God.
* Not talking to a member of the opposite sex unnecessarily.

<text>Christopher Finney, (born 23 May 1984) is a former British soldier of the Blues and Royals who was awarded the George Cross for bravery under friendly fire during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

Finney grew up in Marple, near Stockport, before moving to Dorset. He joined the British Army in September 2000. His first operational deployment came in the Iraq War. On 28 March 2003, the Scimitar armoured vehicle he was driving came under attack from a pair of American ground attack aircraft in a friendly fire incident. Finney rescued several of his comrades despite being hit by the attacking aircraft. For his valour he was awarded the George Cross: the highest award for acts of conspicuous gallantry performed when not in the face of the enemy, becoming the youngest serviceman in the British Armed Forces to receive it.

==Early life==
Finney grew up in Marple, near Stockport, later moving to Wimborne, Dorset.

==Army career==
Finney joined the British Army in September 2000, at the age of 15 years and 9 months. Initially he joined the Coldstream Guards before moving to the Blues and Royals after being persuaded by his section commander during his training. At the age of 16 he attended the a year-long course for junior soldiers attending the Army Foundation College in Harrogate. He joined up with the Household Cavalry Regiment at Windsor in January 2002, after completing his initial training. Finney left the UK for Iraq, along with his squadron.

===Iraq War and George Cross===

On 28 March 2003 the Scimitar armoured vehicle Finney was driving near the Shatt al-Arab waterway north of Basra came under attack from a pair of American ground attack aircraft in a friendly fire incident. Finney escaped from the burning vehicle, but returned to it when he realised that his gunner was trapped in the turret, and succeeded in rescuing him. Realising that his comrades were all injured, Finney returned to the vehicle a second time to inform his headquarters of the situation. He then proceeded to help the wounded gunner to safety even while the two aircraft carried out a second attack, hitting Finney in the lower back and legs. Finally, he returned to the scene of the attack a third time to attempt to rescue the injured driver of another burning vehicle. The citation concludes with: &quot;During these attacks and their horrifying aftermath, Trooper Finney displayed clearheaded courage and devotion to his comrades which was out of all proportion to his age and experience. Acting with complete disregard for his own safety even when wounded, his bravery was of the highest order throughout.&quot;

On 31 October 2003, Finney was awarded the George Cross (GC) — the highest award for acts of conspicuous gallantry performed when not in the face of the enemy, becoming the youngest serviceman in the British Armed Forces to receive it, and only the 154th direct recipient since its inception in 1940 (a number of recipients of other medals had their award converted to a GC). Lance-Corporal of Horse Mick Flynn, also of the Blues and Royals, was awarded the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross for the same action. Sergeant Andrew Sindall of the Royal Engineers, who was attached to D Squadron, was also awarded the Queen&#x27;s Gallantry Medal. The award was presented to Finney at Buckingham Palace on 25 February 2004 by Queen Elizabeth II.

It had been suggested that Trooper Finney was to be nominated for the Victoria Cross, the highest military award of the British military, but the suggestion was rejected because the Victoria Cross is for acts of valour &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot;, and as Trooper Finney and his comrades were under attack from American forces, he did not qualify for the medal.

Finney was awarded a special award at the Pride of Britain Awards in 2004 in recognition of his bravery. He also received an engraved gold watch from &quot;the citizens of Marple&quot; to congratulate him on his &quot;deed of heroism&quot;. After he returned from medical leave, Finney continued to serve in the army. He was promoted to lance-corporal of horse. In January 2005, he became part of the regimental information team that travels around the country at schools and recruiting fairs.

==Post-army career==
After leaving the army, Finney took a course in fibre optics and copper cable installation but was unable to find employment. He found work in a call centre in Poole, Dorset. After giving an interview in a national newspaper that criticised the government and the situation he now found himself in, Finney was offered a job by Joe Calzaghe Enterprises as a corporate ambassador. He was employed to promote a testimonial dinner for the charity Help for Heroes.

Finney lives with his wife, Liz, and their daughters in Cornwall where they run Goonhavern Garden Centre and Chacewater Garden Centre. In 2022 he took over as Chairman of the Victoria Cross and George Cross Association.

Finney took part in the coronation of King Charles III. As chair of the VCGCA, he had been selected as the &quot;representative of those who serve the Crown&quot;. He was one of four persons to present the king to those gathered in Westminster Abbey as part of the first element of the service titled the Recognition.

<doc id="489133" wikidata="Q639425" url="?curid=489133" title="Sweden during World War II">
<text>Sweden maintained its policy of neutrality during World War II. When the war began on 1 September 1939, the fate of Sweden was unclear. But by a combination of its geopolitical location in the Scandinavian Peninsula, &quot;realpolitik&quot; maneuvering during an unpredictable course of events, and a dedicated military build-up after 1942, Sweden kept its official neutrality status throughout the war. 
At the outbreak of hostilities, Sweden had held a neutral stance in international relations for more than a century, since the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1814 and the invasion of Norway.

At the outbreak of war in September 1939, twenty European nations were neutral. Sweden was one of only nine of these nations to maintain this stance for the remainder of the war, along with Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, and the microstates of Andorra, Liechtenstein, Vatican City, and San Marino. The Swedish Government made a few concessions, and sometimes breached the nation&#x27;s neutrality in favor of both Germany and, later, the Western Allies.

During the German invasion of the Soviet Union (June–July 1941), Sweden allowed the Wehrmacht to use Swedish railways to transport the German 163rd Infantry Division along with heavy weapons from Norway to Finland. Until 1943, German soldiers traveling on leave between Norway and Germany were allowed passage through Sweden—the so-called &quot;permittenttrafik&quot;. Iron ore was sold to Germany throughout the war and Germany owned several mines in Sweden that had been bought by German companies before the outbreak of the war. These mines were called &quot;Tyskgruvorna&quot; (&quot;German mines&quot;). For the Allies, Sweden shared military intelligence and helped to train soldier refugees from Denmark and Norway, to be used in the liberation of their home countries. It also allowed the Allies to use Swedish airbases between 1944 and 1945.

Swedish neutrality remains a subject of debate. Proponents argue that during the war, Sweden softened its policy against accepting refugees, admitting thousands of Jews and political dissenters from Norway and Denmark. Conversely, opponents such as Winston Churchill suggest that Sweden &quot;ignored the greater moral issues of the war and played both sides for profit.&quot;

==Background==
===Political===
Between 1523 and Sweden&#x27;s final war with the Russian Empire in 1809, a state of war had existed between these two countries for 67 out of those 286 years. Russia was seen as the historical hereditary enemy of Sweden. In the peace that followed the Finnish War in 1809, all of Finland had been ceded to Russia and Sweden was reduced to two thirds of its former size.

As the end of the 19th century approached, and the beginning of the 20th began, Sweden, like many other nations, became beset by strikes and public disorder. Appalling working conditions were no longer tolerated and the working class was rising against the state. In 1908 alone, there were about 300 strikes in Sweden. By 1917, Sweden&#x27;s need for a new political system was apparent from these riots. Sweden had remained neutral during World War One but with a tendency to side with the Central Powers. Since the 1880s, the socialist movement in Sweden had been divided into two opposing groups: the revolutionary socialists, a communist movement; and the reformists, a social democratic movement – the latter of which being the larger of the two. In 1917, the rules of democracy were changed in Sweden, the electorate&#x27;s size grew and in 1921, women were also allowed to vote.

But even these reforms were seen as far too radical by some conservatives. Some wanted strong leadership and did not believe in democracy. In the 1920s and 1930s, confrontations between employers and employees in Sweden continued. In 1931, this culminated with the Ådalen shootings, an incident where the military opened fire on a protest march. In the same year, a secret right-wing militia, the Munckska kåren, was exposed. It had recruited about 2000 men and had access to heavy weaponry. It was disbanded the next year.

At the other end of the political spectrum, following the Russian Civil War the Russian Empire had become the Soviet Union and many Swedish communists were cooperating with this new Soviet regime, seeking to realize a world revolution. Compromise and a parliamentary system were thought to stand in the way of a more equal and just society.

A new cabinet led by the social democrats with Per Albin Hansson as Prime Minister took control in 1932. A policy of cooperation and consensus was pursued, which led to a furthering of the divide between the two socialist factions: the communists and the Reformist Left. The distance between these two, at least at the ideological level, became so great that the communists often referred to the social democrats as &quot;the social fascists&quot;. Apart from a period termed &quot;the vacation government&quot; (Sw: semesterregeringen) between 19 June and 28 September 1936, Per Albin Hansson was to be the Prime Minister of Sweden until his death in 1946.

===Military===
Sweden had very few tanks in the inter-war era. For a time, the entire armoured corps consisted of ten Stridsvagn mf/21s. This was a design based upon a German First World War tank and had been secretly purchased by Sweden in the form of tractor assembly kits.

In the Defence Act of 1936, it was decided to form two tank battalions. Captain Fale Burman, chief of Army Procurement (&quot;Arméns utrustningsdetalj&quot;) in 1937, commented:

To make sure training at the battalion level would be possible, machine gun–equipped tanks were purchased as well. By 1939, Sweden had 48 Czechoslovakian-built tanks with machine gun armament and about 20 Stridsvagn L-60 tanks armed with a 20 mm main gun.

The Swedish Army had been organized into four divisions since the 1890s, with the regiments of northern Norrland and Gotland standing as separate units. This was outdated, and in 1942, a new military organization was adopted.

===Pre-war trade===
During World War II, Swedish industry had to supply an increased share of its own domestic goods owing to the British naval blockade of the North Sea, whilst satisfying the vastly increased demand for armaments. Before the war, the annual production of armaments was typically measured in tens of millions of Swedish kronor, but during the war, output exceeded SEK 1 billion (US$240 million).
===Military balance===
Sweden&#x27;s long-standing policy of neutrality was tested on many occasions during the 1930s. The challenges came from a strongly rejuvenated, nationalistic Germany. From 1919 until 1935, Sweden had been an active supporter of the League of Nations and most of Sweden&#x27;s political energy in the international arena had been directed towards the League&#x27;s preservation.

The Swedish non-aligned policy during this period was founded on the assumption that there were two opposing powers in the Baltic Sea region, Germany and the Soviet Union; because these two powers needed to guard against each other, the hope was that they would only ever be able to deploy minor forces against Sweden or other non-aligned countries. It was this expectation which made the defence of a small country feasible. The Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, signed at the end of August 1939 between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, upset this balance. 

===Pre-war preparations===
In 1936, the Swedish government started to heighten its military preparedness as the international situation worsened. Military spending in Sweden went from US$37 million in 1936, to $50 million in 1937, to $58.6 million in 1938, and then increased over fivefold to $322.3 million in 1939. During World War II itself, military spending peaked at $527.6 million in 1942.

Not only was the Swedish government buying material to strengthen its defences, it began drafting conscripts. On 6 May 1938, the government called up all those aged 15 for short periods of training. In addition to this, the Swedish Cabinet ordered that one quarter of those conscripted in 1938 should be retained for further training.

In 1940, the Home Guard was created. Its units were small groups of former soldiers who were equipped with rifles, machine guns, ammunition, medicine and uniforms. They had the option to buy additional materials such as skis, sweaters and marching boots. The Swedish Women&#x27;s Voluntary Defence Organization had already been in existence since 1924.

While arming itself, Sweden felt that it was necessary to articulate and enforce its policy of neutrality. Per Albin Hansson&#x27;s statement shortly before World War II began:

Georg Homin, a captain on the General Staff, stated:

==War==

When, in September 1939, Germany attacked Poland and both France and Britain declared war on Nazi Germany, Sweden declared itself a neutral country in regard to this escalating situation. An example illustrating this situation may be the failed Allied attempt to release Polish submarines (ORP &quot;Ryś&quot;, ORP &quot;Żbik&quot;, ORP &quot;Sęp&quot;) which were interned after they reached Swedish ports (requiring repairs of battle damage, unable to break the German blockade and sail to Britain).

On the outbreak of the Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union in November 1939, Sweden declared itself to be &quot;non-belligerent&quot; in regard to this particular conflict, actively siding with Finland. This allowed Sweden to aid Finland economically, and with armaments. Sweden and Finland also jointly laid minefields in the Sea of Åland to deter Soviet submarines from entering the Gulf of Bothnia.

===Foreign trade===
Sweden was not directly attacked during World War II. It was, however, subject to British and German naval blockades and accidental bombings from the Soviets on some cities (e.g. Strängnäs), which led to problems with the supply of food and fuels. When Germany invaded Denmark and Norway in April 1940, coupled with a German blockade of the North Sea, every shipment had to be negotiated with both British and German authorities, which drastically reduced the volume of trade. Between 1938 and 1944, the Swedish import of petroleum products and coal decreased by 88% and 53% respectively, which led to severe shortages. Other critical items were natural rubber, alloy metals and food. This situation led to extensive rationing of fuels and food in Sweden and substitutes were developed and produced. Wood gas was used as a fuel for motor vehicles and shale oil as a substitute for bunker oil.

At the beginning of the war, agreements had been signed between Sweden and the United Kingdom and Nazi Germany in order to sustain vital trade; but in spite of this, and the fact that Sweden had declared itself a neutral country, Swedish shipping came under attack. Sweden&#x27;s trade with Britain was cut by a total of 70%. Within the North Sea blockade, trade with Germany increased, until 37% of Sweden&#x27;s exports were shipped to Germany. For very important goods such as ball bearings from SKF for the British aircraft industry, delivery was made by blockade runners, using rebuilt Motor Gun Boats, which could use winter darkness and high speed to penetrate the German blockade of the Skagerrak straits between Norway and the northern tip of Denmark.

Before the outbreak of the war, the Swedish Ministry of defence (Royal Swedish Air Force Materiel Administration) had ordered some 300 combat aircraft from the United States, primarily Seversky P-35s and P-66 Vanguards. In 1940, however, the US administration halted these exports. Only about 60 aircraft had been delivered. Sweden succeeded subsequently in buying 200 aircraft from Italy, a fascist ally of Germany at the time; these aircraft were primarily Fiat CR.42 Falcos, Reggiane Re.2000s, and Caproni Ca.313s.

===Measures to protect against air raids===

Beginning in the autumn of 1938, efforts were made to protect cities and towns from air raids. In order to decrease the risk of large fires breaking out the attics of all buildings were cleared in the larger towns. After the outbreak of war all windows in towns were to be covered quickly in the event of an air raid. Historic buildings such as medieval churches were in many cases protected by moving valuable objects or covering external ornaments. The vast sculpture group &quot;Saint George and the Dragon,&quot; located in Storkyrkan in Stockholm, was disassembled and evacuated to an underground space in April 1940.

===Winter War===
====Impact on domestic politics====
War broke out between Finland and the Soviet Union in November 1939. In Sweden, the Liberal, Conservative and Agrarian parties were concerned about a perceived threat from the Soviet Union. The Social Democrats were in the main equally concerned. Leading social democrats like Rickard Sandler and Torsten Nilsson played a prominent role in mustering support for Finland. The Communists were openly loyal to the Soviet Union and supported its Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact with Germany. However, when Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, they swung around to a pro-Allied view.

====Defence of Finland====
When the Soviet Union attacked Finland in November 1939, many Swedes favored some sort of involvement in the conflict, both on a humanitarian and on a military basis. Sweden&#x27;s interest in Finland lay in the fact that Finland had been an integrated part of Sweden for more than six hundred years, with Sweden losing control of its eastern provinces in 1809. Despite several pleas from the Finnish government, the Swedish government declined to engage militarily with the Red Army as it advanced during the Winter War. However, Sweden declared itself &quot;non-belligerent&quot; rather than neutral during the conflict and as many as 8,000 Swedes voluntarily went to Finland to fight. The Swedish government and public also sent food, clothing, medicine, weapons and ammunition to aid the Finns during this conflict. This military aid included:

* 135,402 rifles, 347 machine guns, and 450 light machine guns with 50,013,300 rounds of small arms ammunition
* 144 field guns, 100 anti-aircraft guns and 92 anti-tank guns with 301,846 shells
* 300 naval mines and 500 depth charges
* 17 fighter aircraft, five light bombers, one DC-2 transport aircraft turned into a bomber, and three reconnaissance aircraft

Twelve of Sweden&#x27;s most modern fighter aircraft, British Gloster Gladiators, were flown by volunteer Swedish pilots under Finnish insignia. These aircraft constituted one third of Sweden&#x27;s fighter force at the time. In addition, Sweden received some 70,000 Finnish children who were sent to Sweden to find safety during the 1940s.

In addition to the military aid sent to Finland, the Swedish government secretly facilitated the delivery of aircraft that Finland had purchased or received as donations from other countries. A total of 157 planes were assembled in volunteering Swedish factories, while Finnish pilots collected an additional 35 planes in Sweden after they were flown in from abroad. The Royal Swedish Air Force Materiel Administration and the Swedish Air Force provided logistical support for these operations, with discreet approval from the Swedish government to avoid provoking significant protests from the Soviet Union.

On 21 February 1940, seven Soviet bombers accidentally dropped around 150 bombs over Pajala in Norrbotten County. Six buildings caught fire and two people were injured. The event sparked further debate on whether Sweden should send aid to the Finns.

====Possible Allied invasion====


German industry was heavily dependent on Swedish iron ore. The Allies had intended to use the Soviet attack on Finland in November 1939 as cover for seizing the important Swedish iron ore deposits in the north, in addition to the Norwegian harbours through which this ore was shipped to Germany. The plan was to get Norwegian and Swedish permission to send an expeditionary force to Finland across northern Norway and Sweden, ostensibly to help the Finns. But once in place, they were to proceed to take control of the harbours and the iron ore mines, occupying cities such as Gävle and Luleå and denying German access to the Swedish iron ore. In this way, an unsuspecting Norway and Sweden would be presented with a &quot;fait accompli&quot;. Realizing this danger, however, and the consequent possibility of Allied or German occupation and of the war being waged on their territory, both the Swedes and the Norwegians refused to allow this proposal.

Meanwhile, the Germans, having suspected an Allied threat, were making their own plans for an invasion of Norway in order to protect their strategic supply lines. The Altmark Incident of 16 February 1940 convinced Hitler that the Allies would not respect Norwegian neutrality, so he ordered plans for an invasion.

Scandinavian reluctance to allow Allied troops onto their territory had halted the original Allied plan for using aid to Finland as a pretext for moving in troops, but on 12 March 1940, the Allies decided to try a &quot;semi-peaceful&quot; invasion nonetheless. Troops were to be landed in Norway, and proceed into Sweden to capture the Swedish iron ore mines. However, if serious military resistance was encountered, they were not to press the issue. The plan was abandoned with the ending of the Winter War on 13 March. The Germans were partly aware of these Allied intentions, as they had intercepted radio traffic showing that Allied transport groups were being readied. A few days later, they also intercepted messages confirming that the Allies had abandoned their plan and were to redeploy their forces.

German plans for an invasion of Norway continued, since Hitler feared that the Allies were nonetheless intent upon launching their own invasion. 9 April was set as the date of Operation Weserübung, the German attack on Norway.

Hitler was correct about Allied intentions. The Allied plan had two parts, Operation Wilfred and Plan R 4. Operation Wilfred was to take place on 5 April (it was in fact delayed until 8 April) when Norwegian territorial waters were to be mined, violating Norwegian neutrality. This would force the ships carrying ore to Germany to travel outside the protection of Norwegian territorial waters and thus become legitimate targets for the Royal Navy. It was hoped that this would provoke a German military reaction. As soon as the Germans reacted, under &quot;Plan R 4&quot;, 18,000 Allied troops were to land in Narvik, closing the rail link to Sweden. Other cities that the Allies hoped to capture were Trondheim and Bergen.

The first ship carrying Allied troops was to start its journey a few hours after the mine-laying. On 8 April, a Royal Naval detachment led by mined Norwegian waters as a part of Operation Wilfred, but German troops were already on their way and &quot;Plan R 4&quot; was quickly made obsolete.

===Occupation of Denmark and Norway===


On 9 April 1940, Germany launched &quot;Operation Weserübung&quot;, an operation with the objective of simultaneously occupying Denmark and Norway, and to stage a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; in Norway.
This move had several far-reaching consequences for Sweden. Sweden was in effect cut off from trade with the western world and therefore more dependent on German goodwill, ultimately leading to permittenttrafik. But it also lessened the immediate risk that Sweden would become a theater of war between the Axis and the Allies.

When Germany invaded both Denmark and Norway on 9 April 1940, the 100,000 Swedish soldiers who had been deployed along the Finnish border in northern Sweden were in the process of being demobilized, owing to the end of the Winter War there. Before the outbreak of hostilities, Sweden had had no plans for defending Norway or any defence strategy against a German invasion from the direction of Norway. Moreover, an agreement from the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905 stated that no fortification was allowed along this border. One of Germany&#x27;s demands on Sweden, as Germany&#x27;s invasion progressed, was that Sweden was not to mobilize. However, Sweden re-organized its system of mobilization to allow for personal order by letter to be made possible as an alternative to official proclamation, so that 320,000 men were able to be raised in a few weeks. This was called &quot;The Organization&quot; and was barely different from a full mobilization when completed. Sweden also started to build fortifications at the Norwegian border and along the coast of Scania.

During its invasion of Norway, Germany demanded access to the Swedish telephone and telegraph lines between Germany and Norway. Sweden allowed this, but tapped the lines. In the early summer of 1940, the Swedish mathematician Arne Beurling succeeded in deciphering and discovering the source codes of the &quot;Geheimfernschreiber&quot; cypher machine that Germany used, which afforded the Swedes advance knowledge of Germany&#x27;s military intentions. Although the British Plan R 4 had not been able to be carried out, Allied troops were swiftly sent to Norway and were able to fight alongside the Norwegians unsuccessfully against the German invaders. However, the success of the German campaign against France and the occupation of the Low Countries led to a British troop re-deployment and by 8 June 1940, British troops had been evacuated from Norway.

In his book &quot;Blodsporet&quot; (&quot;The Blood Track&quot;), Espen Eidum detailed how, at the request of Adolf Hitler, Nazi Germany sent three trains with 30 to 40 sealed carriages through Sweden to the battle of Narvik. These trains ostensibly transported medical personnel and food for the wounded German soldiers in Narvik. However, in reality there were 17 soldiers for every medical officer or orderly. Sweden knew that the trains were being used to transport troops because a Swedish representative in Berlin reported that he had watched them board. The trains also transported heavy artillery, anti-aircraft guns, ammunition, and communications and supply equipment.

===Midsummer Crisis===

At the start of the German invasion of the Soviet Union in the early summer of 1941, codenamed Operation Barbarossa, the Germans asked Sweden to allow the transportation of armed German troops, the 163rd Infantry Division, commanded by General Erwin Engelbrecht, along with all its military equipment, through Swedish territory by train from Norway to the eastern front in Finland. Finland also insisted on the transfer of the division.

The Swedish government granted this permission after two days of internal debate. In Sweden, the political deliberations surrounding this are known as the &quot;Midsummer Crisis&quot;; however, according to research by Carl-Gustaf Scott there never was a &quot;crisis&quot;, he argues that &quot;the crisis was created in historical hindsight in order to protect the political legacy of the Social Democratic Party and its leader Per Albin Hansson&quot;. Dick Harryson explains that there was a risk of the coalition government falling apart if the Social Democrats, for which Per Albin Hansson was the leader, voted no to the transfer and the right wing parties voted yes. Per Albin Hansson did not want a government in crisis and recommended to vote yes. Ernst Wigforss convinced the Social Democrats to vote no with a large majority by stating that this was about choosing sides in the war. Per Albin Hansson then asked for a second vote on how the Social Democrats would react to the right wing voting yes. The opinion was split, but the majority would rather accept the transfer than bring down the government.
Since Sweden was not neutral in relation to Finland during the Winter War but non-belligerent, it is debatable if the transfer constituted a violation of neutrality even if the transfer occurred after the Soviet Union attacked Finland starting the Continuation War and Sweden was yet to take a stance in this conflict.
===1943 onward===
From late 1942 and into 1943, Germany began to meet with a series of military reverses after its losses at the Second Battle of El Alamein, the Battle of Stalingrad and elsewhere. Germany was forced into a more defensive position as the Allied forces achieved success on the battlefield. It was becoming increasingly apparent to Sweden that Germany was unlikely to win the war. Prior to 1943, Sweden&#x27;s policy of neutrality had been largely under the close scrutiny of Germany. After August and September 1943, however, Sweden was increasingly able to resist German demands and to soften its stance to Allied pressure. However, despite Germany&#x27;s new, defensive posture, Sweden&#x27;s constant fear was that the unexpected would happen, an attitude that continued until the very end of the war. With Germany&#x27;s weakening position came stronger demands from the Allies. They pushed for Sweden to abandon its trade with Germany and to stop all German troop movements over Swedish soil. Sweden accepted payments from the Allies to compensate for this loss of income through reduced trade with Germany, but continued to sell steel and machine parts to Nazi Germany at inflated &quot;smugglers&#x27; rates&quot;.

===Training of Norwegian and Danish troops===

During the war, more than 50,000 Norwegians fled to Sweden. These refugees were sent to camps at Öreryd in Småland and Kjesäter in Södermanland. From the summer of 1943 onward, the military training of Norwegian troops was carried out in Sweden, in cooperation with the Swedish government and the Norwegian government-in-exile in London. To prevent protests from Nazi Germany, this training was ostensibly for the Norwegian police. From the start, the recruits only had light infantry weapons, but later they were able to train with artillery. Military exercises were held in Dalarna in December 1944 and in Hälsingland in spring 1945. Eight thousand men took part in this latter exercise.

In all, around 15,000 men were trained and organized into ten battalions and at the end of the war, eight of these battalions, about 13,500 men, were ready for action. They entered Norway on 8 May 1945. The number of Danish refugees had been much lower than the 50,000 Norwegians, but a brigade of about 3,600 Danish men was also trained and they were transferred to Denmark on 5 May 1945.

===The Bäckebo rocket===

On 13 June 1944, a V-2 rocket under test by the Germans (test rocket V-89, serial number 4089) from Peenemünde crashed in Sweden after the rocket had flown into cumulus clouds which had strayed into the controller&#x27;s line of sight. It was supposed to crash in the sea outside Bornholm in occupied Denmark. V-89 contained a FuG 230 &quot;Straßburg&quot; radio control receiver unit, normally commanded by a remote FuG 203 &quot;Kehl&quot; joystick-equipped radio control transmitter set that had also been meant for use with the Wasserfall anti-aircraft missile (code named Burgund), as a development of the same FuG 203/230 equipment pairing used to guide both the Fritz X gravity-propulsion guided ordnance and the Henschel Hs 293 glide bomb. The ground controller appeared to have no trouble manoeuvring the rocket until it disappeared into the high cloud layer.

A captured German prisoner later explained to the British that the controller was an expert at steering glider bombs from aircraft, but that the spectacle of a rocket launch had caused him to incorrectly operate the control lever in his astonishment. Peenemünde guidance and control expert Ernst Steinhoff explained that the excited operator applied a set of planned corrections (such as that for the Earth&#x27;s rotation) in the opposite direction from the way he had been instructed. The rocket subsequently exploded in an air burst (a common V-2 malfunction) about 1500 metres above the county of Bäckebo, mainly over a farm, causing no injuries, and the valuable wreckage was exchanged with Britain by the Swedes for Supermarine Spitfires.

On 31 July 1944, experts at the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough in Hampshire, England, began an attempt to reconstruct the missile. U.S. military scientists subsequently received some of the recovered parts from the British. The American rocket pioneer Robert H. Goddard examined those components as part of his work aiding the U.S. military, and Goddard is reported to have inferred that his brainchild had been turned into a weapon.

===Soviet bombings of Sweden===

The Soviet Union dropped more than a hundred bombs on Swedish cities and villages during World War II, though no one was killed in these strikes. The first time on 14 January 1940, when Soviet aircraft attacked Swedish airspace and dropped about 10 bombs in northern Sweden, close to the port of Luleå. On their return flight, the three DB-3 aircraft ran out of fuel and were forced to land in Finland, where they were captured by Finnish troops. On 21 February, seven Soviet bomber planes appeared in the village Pajala, 10 kilometres from the border to Finland. Pajala was hit by more than 130 bombs, causing damage to local buildings. A bomb hit the local school gym, where the Norrland Dragoon Regiment were stationed at the time, but did not detonate. There were two injuries during the bombing of Pajala.

On 22 February, Stockholm was bombed by four Soviet bombers, a 100 kg bomb destroying a newly opened theatre, injuring two Swedish soldiers. Sweden concluded that this instance was by mistake, but the Soviet Union refused to acknowledge the involvement of its bombers in the raid when requested to clarify. Though the event remains unclear, a theory developed that it was a deliberate attack in response to Sweden rejecting Soviet appeals for Vasily Sidorenko, who had been arrested for espionage, to be released.

== Humanitarian effort ==

Before the war, thousands of European Jews sought temporary refuge in Sweden, and were denied. As the war began to shift in favor of the Allies, the Swedes changed their strategy with regard to aiding the precariously situated European Jews, who up to that point had been refused refuge in Sweden. The first shift in Sweden&#x27;s stance towards Jews occurred in 1942. When the Germans began their campaign of persecution against the Jews of Norway, the Swedish government accepted 900 Jewish refugees, slightly more than half of Norway&#x27;s Jewish population.

In 1943, Sweden received nearly all of Denmark&#x27;s 8,000 Jews (along with 9,000 Danish Christians who were seeking refuge from conditions of war). With the dissolution of the Danish government in the summer of 1943, the German authorities had decided to deport Denmark&#x27;s Jewish population to concentration camps. However, the Danes successfully ferried all but 450 of the Danish Jews across the straits between Copenhagen and the Swedish mainland, across waters that were patrolled by German Schnellboots, in an unprecedented rescue effort. Once in Sweden, the Danish Jews were granted asylum and taken in by Swedish families. Many stayed in Sweden after the war. Sweden also received refugees from Finland and Norway, including some of Norway&#x27;s Jews. All this, as well as the protection of Sweden&#x27;s own Jewish population, was made possible by Sweden&#x27;s neutrality. A daily newspaper in Sweden, the &quot;Svenska Dagbladet&quot; said that Sweden did more to assist and save Jews than any other country.

Neutrality also allowed Sweden to have physical access to Germany, which was not only useful to Swedish intelligence but to Allied intelligence as well. Employees at Asea, LM Ericsson and the Swedish Match Factory (Svenska Tändsticksfabriken) acted as couriers for the Polish resistance. King Gustav V of Sweden attempted to use his diplomatic connections with German leaders to convince them to treat Jews more humanely, as evidenced through his correspondence, although to little effect. Count Folke Bernadotte, a relative of the Swedish royal family, was able to communicate with the German government and relay information back to Sweden, as did other diplomats. He also contributed in saving 15,000 prisoners from concentration camps, as did Valdemar Langlet and the famous diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, who may have saved up to 100,000 Hungarian Jews.

==Press freedom==

The Swedish public&#x27;s sentiments were widely published in the Swedish press, causing many protests from the German government and prompting the Swedish government to censor some areas of the press on a limited basis. In Sweden during this time, the press fell under the control of several authorities, despite contemporary claims that the Swedish press was free. The Swedish Government Information Board determined what military information could be released and what information should remain secret. The Swedish Press Council served as a self-regulatory body, promoting &quot;good relations between the press and the public authorities and to serve as an instrument of self-discipline for the press&quot;. The Swedish Press Council issued warnings, both public and confidential, to those whom it considered to be abusing the freedom of the press.

The Swedish government was concerned that its neutrality might be compromised should the press become too vocal in its opinions. Both the Swedish Press Council and the Information Board issued advice such as: &quot;As far as the received material permits, attempts should be made not to give prominence to the reports of one side at the expense of the other&quot;, or: &quot;Headlines, whether on the billboards or in the newspapers, should be worded in such a way as to avoid favoring one side or the other&quot;, and: &quot;Editorials and surveys as well as articles discussing military events or the military situation, should be strictly objective.&quot;

During World War II, six newspapers were de facto banned from distribution: Ture Nerman&#x27;s &quot;Trots Allt!&quot;, the Nazi publication &quot;Sverige Fritt&quot; and &quot;Ny Dag&quot;, &quot;Arbetar-Tidningen&quot;, &quot;Norrskensflamman&quot; and &quot;Sydsvenska Kuriren&quot; (the last four were organs of the Communist Party of Sweden). A ban on the transport of these newspapers was imposed, since the printing of newspapers was protected in the Swedish constitution. There were indications that the bans imposed on the communist newspapers had served their political purposes by impressing the Germans, whilst at the same time not really restricting the work of the media.

==Concessions==
===To Nazi Germany===
Perhaps the most important aspect of Sweden&#x27;s concessions to Germany during the Second World War was the extensive export of iron ore for use in the German weapons industry, reaching ten million tons per year. As Germany&#x27;s preparations for war became more apparent and the risk of another war became obvious, international interest in Swedish iron ore increased. At the time, British intelligence had estimated that German industry relied heavily on Swedish iron ore and a decrease or halt in Swedish ore exports could have a disastrous effect on Germany&#x27;s military efforts. Sir Ralph Glyn, a British Member of Parliament, claimed that a cessation of Swedish iron ore exports would bring the war to an end within months. Winston Churchill himself said the following about the Swedish ore exports in an internal memo to the cabinet discussing the Norwegian trade route with shipments of Swedish iron ore.

Given that Britain had been unable to prevent the successful invasion by Nazi Germany of both France and Norway, the Swedish government was not convinced that the British could protect them and opted to continue exports. The iron ore provided much needed gold bullion, food and coal from Germany. The iron ore was transported by sea from the Norwegian town of Narvik and from Luleå in northern Sweden. These shipments were subject to attacks from British aircraft and submarines in the Atlantic and North Sea and by Soviet submarines in the Baltic Sea. About 70 vessels were sunk and 200 sailors killed during the war.

Responding to German appeals for volunteers to fight the Soviet Union, approximately 270 Swedes enlisted in Germany&#x27;s Waffen-SS, and saw combat against Soviet troops on the Eastern Front. This was a choice made by individual Swedish citizens, contrary to Swedish government policy. Their number was small compared to occupied countries, in which officials encouraged enlisting for the Eastern Front (Norway 6,000; Denmark 6,000; France 11,000; Netherlands 20,000). Roughly 50 Swedish Waffen-SS men were killed or went missing in action. Most of the veterans were classified as security risks and spied on by Swedish intelligence for the rest of their lives. Security Police&#x27;s archives showed that some of the men were implicated as direct participants in the killings of Jews. No Swedes stood trial for serving in the Waffen-SS, albeit some of them were prosecuted for espionage or desertion.

With a blockade of the Skagerrak straits between Norway and the northern tip of Denmark, the Swedish merchant navy found itself physically divided. The vessels that were inside the Baltic Sea traded goods with Germany during the war, whilst the greater number of vessels was leased to the Allies for convoy shipping. Approximately 1,500 Swedish sailors perished during the war, mostly victims of mines and U-boat attacks. German merchant raiders, too, would stop and capture or destroy Swedish vessels carrying cargoes for allies. For example, this was the fate of MVs &quot;Trolleholm&quot; and &quot;Sir Ernest Cassel&quot;, both destroyed by the German auxiliary cruiser &quot;Thor&quot;; the same &quot;Thor&quot; also accidentally collided with HM &quot;Bothnia&quot; in the fog while carrying cargoes for Germany causing it to sink. In the meantime, other German merchant raiders would masquerade as Swedish merchant vessels.

===To the Allies===
Sweden made efforts to help the Allied Forces. From May 1940, a large part of the Swedish merchant navy that found itself outside the Baltic Sea region, totalling about 8,000 seamen, was leased to Britain. 300 Swedes traveled to Norway to fight the German invasion. German telegraph traffic to occupied Oslo went through Swedish-leased cables which the Swedes intercepted. The traffic was encrypted with Germany&#x27;s Geheimschreiber device, but the cypher code was broken by Swedish mathematics professor Arne Beurling in early summer 1940 and the results from this espionage were sent to the Allies through the Polish resistance movement. When the German battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot; embarked on her voyage to attack the Atlantic convoys, Swedish intelligence informed the British of her departure from port. Swedish businessmen and diplomats were also actively spying for the Allies, in Berlin and in the occupied territories.

In 1945, as the Allies were planning to liberate Denmark and Norway, the United States wanted Sweden to co-operate in this action. Sweden began preparing for (Operation Save Denmark), in which Sweden was to invade Zealand from Scania. After Denmark had been liberated, Sweden was to assist the Allies in the invasion of Norway. This proved to be unnecessary, but US planes were allowed to use Swedish military bases during the liberation of Norway, from spring 1944 to 1945, and the Allies were also collaborating with the Swedish Military Intelligence and Security Service. Sweden allowed Allied spies to listen to German radio signals from a station on Öland. A radio beacon was also established in Malmö for the British military to guide bombing of Germany. Additionally, from 1943 onward, Norwegian and Danish soldiers () were trained at Swedish military bases. Sweden had also set up a series of training camps along the Norwegian border for the Norwegian resistance movement. Toward the end of the war Swedish intelligence cooperated with US air transport in relief efforts directed toward areas liberated by the Red Army.

==Aftermath==
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom during World War II, Winston Churchill, accused Sweden of ignoring the greater moral issues and playing both sides for profit during the conflict, including its supply of steel and machine parts to Nazi Germany throughout the war. Such claims, however, use a different definition of the word &quot;neutral&quot; from that defined in the 1907 Hague convention, which set out the rights and duties of belligerents and neutral countries.

=== Forced refoulement to the Soviet Union ===

In January 1946, Sweden forcibly transferred to the Soviet Union over 146 Baltic Waffen-SS and 2,364 German soldiers who had been interned in Swedish prison camps. At least seven of the internees committed suicide at their camp in the village of Rinkaby, rather than allow themselves to be handed over to the Soviet Union.

In 1970, film director Johan Bergenstråhle made a documentary, (English title: &quot;A Baltic Tragedy&quot;), about the Latvian soldiers who were given to the Soviets to be sentenced to hard labor in prison camps.
