<text>HMS &quot;Hampshire&quot; was a destroyer of the Royal Navy. Laid down, in March 1959 a couple of weeks behind the class leader , she was classified as a guided missile destroyer, as the Sea Lords regarded the concept of the cruiser and big gun ship as discredited by the perceived failure of the and the obsolescence of the heavy gun. The description of guided missile destroyer seemed more likely to win approval from the Treasury and Government for an adequate number of warships the size of small cruisers, which could play many traditional cruiser flagship and command functions, but had no armour around its gun and missile magazine.

==Construction and design==
&quot;Hampshire&quot; was one of two County-class destroyers ordered under the British Admiralty&#x27;s 1955–56 shipbuilding programme. She was laid down at John Brown &amp; Company&#x27;s Clydebank shipyard on 26 March 1959 and launched by Princess Margaret on 16 March 1961. The ship was completed on 15 March 1963, and was the fifth ship of that name to serve with the Royal Navy.

&quot;Hampshire&quot; was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was normal and deep load. The ship was propelled by a combination of steam turbines and gas turbines in a Combined steam and gas (COSAG) arrangement, driving two propeller shafts. Each shaft could by driven by a single steam turbine (fed with steam at and ) from Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers) and two Metrovick G6 gas turbines (each rated at ), with the gas turbines being used for high speeds and to allow a quick departure from ports without waiting for steam to be raised. Maximum speed was and the ship had a range of at .

A twin launcher for the Seaslug anti-aircraft missile was fitted aft. The Seaslug GWS1 was a beam riding missile which had an effective range of about . Up to 39 Seaslugs could be carried horizontally in a magazine that ran much of the length of the ship. Close-in anti-aircraft protection was provided by a pair of Seacat (missile) launchers, while two twin QF 4.5 inch Mark V gun mounts were fitted forward. A helicopter deck and hangar allowed a single Westland Wessex helicopter to be operated.

A Type 965 long-range air-search radar and a Type 278 height-finding radar was fitted on the ship&#x27;s mainmast, with a Type 992Q navigation radar and an array of ESM aerials were mounted on the ship&#x27;s foremast. Type 901 fire control radar for the Seaslug missile was mounted aft. Type 184 sonar was fitted.

==Operational service==
On 18 June 1963, &quot;Hampshire&quot; interrupted trials, to host the burial at sea of Admiral Cunningham, off the Nab Tower, near the Isle of Wight. In March 1964, as part of efforts to reinforce British forces in the Far East in response to the escalating Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation, &quot;Hampshire&quot; left Britain, arriving at Singapore on 13 April.

From her third Commission in 1967 &quot;Hampshire&quot; flew the flag of the Flag Officer, Western Fleet (United Kingdom). In July 1969 she was present at Torbay for the Royal Review and presentation of a new colour to the Western Fleet (United Kingdom).

==Decommissioning and disposal==
In the late 1960s there were plans to upgrade &quot;Hampshire&quot; and sister destroyers armed with Seaslug Mk 1, with Seaslug Mk 2 and a digital combat system being fitted, but the upgrade of &quot;Hampshire&quot; and &quot;Devonshire&quot; was cancelled on 31 March 1967 because of the amount of the time the ships would be out of the operational fleet, with the remaining two upgrades cancelled in 1968.

In 1976 she was the first of the County-class destroyers to be decommissioned. This was at a time the Labour Government was making severe defence cuts under pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). She was cannibalised for spares to service her sister ships and subsequently sold for scrap in 1979, being broken up at Briton Ferry by Thos. W. Ward.

==Commanding officers==

Notable commanding officers include R A Trowbridge from 1967-1969 and R P Clayton between 1969 and 1970.

==In media==
The &quot;Hampshire&quot; appears in the &quot;UFO&quot; episode &quot;Destruction&quot;, as it is used to secretly place sealed tanks filled with lethal gas from an unnamed war under water.

<doc id="497281" wikidata="Q5632983" url="?curid=497281" title="HMS Kent (D12)">
<text>HMS &quot;Kent&quot; was a batch-1 destroyer of the Royal Navy. She and her sisters were equipped with the Sea Slug Mk-1 medium-range surface-to-air missile SAM system, along with the short-range Sea Cat SAM, two twin 4.5-inch gun turrets, two single 20mm cannon, ASW torpedo tubes, and a platform and hangar that allowed her to operate one Wessex helicopter. The County class were large ships, with good seakeeping abilities and long range, and were ideal blue-water ships for their time.

==Construction and design==
&quot;Kent&quot; was one of two County-class destroyers ordered under the British Admiralty&#x27;s 1956–57 shipbuilding programme. She was laid down at Harland &amp; Wolff&#x27;s Belfast shipyard on 1 March 1960 and launched by Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent on 27 September 1961. The ship was completed on 15 August 1963.

&quot;Kent&quot; was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was normal and deep load. The ship was propelled by a combination of steam turbines and gas turbines in a Combined steam and gas (COSAG) arrangement, driving two propeller shafts. Each shaft could by driven by a single steam turbine (fed with steam at and ) from Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers) and two Metrovick G6 gas turbines (each rated at ), with the gas turbines being used for high speeds and to allow a quick departure from ports without waiting for steam to be raised. Maximum speed was and the ship had a range of at .

A twin launcher for the Seaslug anti-aircraft missile was fitted aft. The Seaslug GWS1 was a beam riding missile which had an effective range of about . Up to 39 Seaslugs could be carried horizontally in a magazine that ran much of the length of the ship. Close-in anti-aircraft protection was provided by a pair of Seacat missile launchers, while two twin QF 4.5 inch Mark V gun mounts were fitted forward. A helicopter deck and hangar allowed a single Westland Wessex helicopter to be operated.

A Type 965 long-range air-search radar and a Type 278 height-finding radar was fitted on the ship&#x27;s mainmast, with a Type 992 surface/low level air search and target indication radar and an array of ESM aerials were mounted on the ship&#x27;s foremast. Type 901 fire control radar for the Seaslug missile was mounted aft. Type 184 sonar was fitted.

==Operational service==
After her commissioning and work-up, &quot;Kent&quot; spent the balance of her career as an escort to the Royal Navy&#x27;s aircraft carrier fleet. She deployed at various times with , , and in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans. She was hard worked throughout the 1960s, along with her batch-1 County sister ships, as they were the only guided missile-armed destroyers in the fleet until the latter half of the 1960s.

One role was as host ship for the &quot;Withdrawal from Empire&quot; negotiations in Gibraltar (citation needed). She suffered a fire during refitting in 1976 but was soon repaired and was present for the Silver Jubilee fleet review of 1977.

In the late 1960s all four of the batch-1 County-class vessels were planned to be upgraded with the superior Sea Slug Mk-2 system, but the upgrades were cancelled in 1967–68 because the amount of time the ships would be out of the operational fleet while being refitted. However, some batch-2 improvements were made during mid life refits, including upgrading the Seacat system from GWS21 to GWS22 and fitting Type 992Q target indicator radar instead of Type 992. &quot;Kent&quot; was refitted from June 1969 to December 1972.

==Decommissioning and harbour service==
&quot;Kent&quot; was decommissioned in the summer of 1980, after only 17 years of active service and became the replacement for and Fleet Training Ship (FTS), moored to the lower end of Whale Island outboard of the defunct support ship opposite Fountain Lake, Portsmouth Naval Base. At the beginning of the Falklands War, she was surveyed for possible recommissioning (her large size, helicopter deck and four 4.5-inch guns would have made her a good command and shore bombardment ship), but her two years of neglect left her in such a state that extensive repairs would be necessary to render her seaworthy, and no work was started.

She spent 1982 through to 1984 as a live asset for artificer and mechanic training supporting and , her machinery largely in serviceable condition.

In 1984 she also became a harbour training ship for the Sea Cadet Corps. She was paid off from this in 1987 and became a training hulk at Portsmouth until stricken in 1993, though she lingered on, tied up to the same pier at Portsmouth Naval Base until 1996.

&quot;Kent&quot; was sold for scrap, and in 1998 she was towed to India to be broken up.

==Commanding officers==
Notable commanding officers include Iwan Raikes in 1968, Richard P Clayton between 1968 and 1969 and Jock Slater in 1976–1977.

Type 901 fire control radar for the Seaslug missile was mounted aft. Type 184 sonar was fitted.

==Royal Navy service==
===Early service===
&quot;London&quot; commissioned at Swan Hunter&#x27;s yard in Wallsend on 14 November 1963 under Captain J.C. Bartosik and was initially fully employed setting her armament to work, successfully firing her Sea Slug surface-to-air missile for the first time off Aberporth in April 1964. After working up, during which she entertained the Duke of Edinburgh on board, she crossed the Atlantic in September 1964. She visited Bermuda and Houston before joining a special squadron led by Vice-Admiral Sir Fitzroy Talbot on a round of visits to the South American part of his command. Passing through Panama, she visited Peru, Chile, Uruguay and Brazil before proceeding via Tristan da Cunha to Simonstown, where she spent Christmas. New Year&#x27;s was spent at sea &quot;en route&quot; to Mauritius, where the ship&#x27;s helicopter was used to build a TV mast. She then deployed to the Far East, visiting Hong Kong, Bangkok, Subic, Singapore and ports in Malaya. During this time she was part of a powerful fleet whose presence acted as a deterrent to President Sukarno of Indonesia&#x27;s attempt to intimidate the infant Federation of Malaysia through &#x27;Confrontation&#x27;. She then returned to the UK via Aden and assisted the &quot;Adrian Augusta&quot; adrift in the Red Sea before entering Suez, proceeding to Gibraltar, then Portsmouth and took part in Navy Days at Portsmouth in 1965.

===More world travel===
On Easter Monday 1969 &quot;London&quot; sailed for the Far East; she had onboard Admiral of the Fleet Sir Varyl Begg GCB., DSO., DSC. who was taking passage to take up his appointment as Governor and C-in-C Gibraltar. The ship sailed into Gibraltar on 17 April flying the flag of an Admiral of the Fleet. After that, she continued her passage, calling in at Simonstown and then onto Beira Patrol before heading for Gan and Singapore. She accordingly spent the period from June to late September in the South China Sea visiting Hong Kong, Manila and Subic Bay as well as spending two weeks in Japan as well as spells in her base port of Singapore. In September, she sailed in company with , into New Zealand visiting Auckland, Gisborne where she led a group of ships celebrating Captain Cook&#x27;s first landing in New Zealand in October 1769. After three days of exceptional hospitality, &quot;London&quot; sailed for Wellington and Lyttelton. She then crossed the Tasman Sea to Hobart and after that up to Melbourne, where the ship&#x27;s company were pleased to experience the Gold Cup.

The ship spent two weeks in Sydney before steaming back to Singapore for Christmas and the New Year. She subsequently sailed across the Indian Ocean to carry out a short stint of Beira patrol; she then sailed round the Cape of Good Hope and on across the Atlantic to carry out Sea Slug missile firings in a tactical setting with the US Navy. A short visit to St Vincent and Puerto Rico allowed the ship&#x27;s company a few days ashore before &quot;London&quot; headed back to Portsmouth, having completed an extremely busy 12 months. There ensued docking and repairing defects in Portsmouth before carrying out workup in October and visits to Greenock before Christmas leave, prior to sailing in early February 1971 for a nine-month tour of duty in the Mediterranean. This period allowed for a wonderful opportunity for cultural visits in Leghorn (for Pisa and Florence, Civitia Vecchia for Rome and Pompeii and Naples as well as Trieste from where a visit to Venice was possible). The ship called in at Crete for the 30th anniversary of the battle in May 1941. She also called in at Cyprus and Istanbul from where a trip round the Black Sea included a visit to Samsun. The ship gave station leave in Gibraltar and Naples; returning to Portsmouth in early November 1971. In 31 months she had carried out two deployments lasting 21 months, had spent six weeks working up between deployments as well as visits to Scotland and missile firing practice at Aberforth.

===&#x27;Lasts and decommissioning===

&quot;London&quot; was chosen to represent Great Britain for the celebrations in New York City for the American Bicentennial celebrations in July 1976. The crew went to great lengths to make the ship clean and &#x27;ship-shape&#x27; for the visit, and &quot;London&quot; hosted several diplomatic and social functions while she was there. Her crew enjoyed an extended liberty period out on the town.

&quot;London&quot; was the last ship to leave Malta when the Maltese government closed the base. She attended the 1977 Silver Jubilee Fleet Review off Spithead when she was part of the First Flotilla.

The ship was the last RN vessel capable of firing Mark 1 Sea Slug missiles, firing the last 17 Mk 1 seaslugs on 9 December 1981 as targets for HMS Cardiff and Glasgows Sea Darts and 4.5 shells as targets for HMS Brilliant. Seawolf and on the 10 December 1981, the ship had the distinction of being the ship that carried out the Navy&#x27;s final twin turret broadside when all four of her 4.5 inch guns were fired at once 

&quot;London&quot; was decommissioned in late December 1981 after completing a three-month deployment to the West Indies as Belize Guardship, during which her crew were involved in the granting of independence to Antigua.

==Pakistan naval service==

&quot;London&quot; was sold to Pakistan on 23 March 1982 and recommissioned &quot;Babur&quot; under Captain Mukhtar Azam. &quot;Babur&quot; was decommissioned from Pakistani service in 1993 and sold for scrap in 1995.

==Commanding officers==
Notable commanding officers include J C Bartosik between 1963-1966 and Ronald Forrest during 1970-1972.

<text>The flag of the U.S. state of Vermont displays the state&#x27;s coat of arms and motto (&quot;Freedom and Unity&quot;) on a rectangular blue background. The Vermont General Assembly adopted the flag on June 1, 1923.

Vermont has had three official state flags. Prior to a state flag, the flag of the Green Mountain Boys was used as an unofficial flag. Vermont adopted its first state flag that looked similar to the flag of the United States, with red and white stripes and a blue canton. It was later changed to be dissimilar to avoid confusion. Proposals have been considered to revert the flag to the Green Mountain Boys&#x27; design, but none have succeeded.

==Symbolism==
The flag consists of the state&#x27;s coat of arms and motto on a field of azure. While the pine needle supporters of the coat of arms are represented throughout New England and symbolizes the small pine branches worn at the Battle of Plattsburgh near the end of the War of 1812, the pine tree in the middle of the coat of arms represents the Vermont forests. The cow and three sheaves of wheat represent the dairy and agriculture industries. The deer head on top represents Vermont&#x27;s wildlife. The Green Mountains are in the background as well. The motto, &quot;Freedom and Unity&quot;, is also used. The motto balances two different ideals, the freedom of the individual citizen, and the welfare of the common good.

==History==

There is no extant record of a design for an official Vermont flag prior to 1804, although Ira Allen&#x27;s design—common to both the Great Seal of Vermont and the coat of arms of Vermont—dates to 1778. While an official government flag might not have existed prior to 1804, the Vermont militia—known as the Green Mountain Boys—was formed in 1770, and remaining accounts record use of the flag of the Green Mountain Boys as far back as 1777.

On May 1, 1804, the number of U.S. states rose to seventeen, and it was expected that the U.S. flag would change to 17 stars and 17 stripes. In anticipation, Vermont adopted the expected new U.S. flag design with the addition of the name &quot;VERMONT&quot; embroidered along the top. The U.S. flag did not add any stripes, resulting in the Vermont flag having more stripes than the national flag.

On October 20, 1837, Vermont changed its flag to a design based on the 13-stripe U.S. flag, but with the multiple stars of the blue canton replaced with a single large star surrounding Vermont&#x27;s coat of arms. The flags based on these specifications varied in the number of points on the star (five and eight, with eight slightly more common), and the exact details of the center of the star (with either the Great Seal or the coat of arms being used).

During the Mexican-American War Vermont sent troops that carried similar flags to the second state flag but with the name of the regiment on it. One of the flags was described as: &quot;It is of silk, the regular thirteen stripes, but in the place of the field of stars in the coat of arms of Vermont, in a five pointed star. Beneath runs the motto, &quot;Freedom and Unity,&quot; and on the sides of the star is emblazoned &quot;27th Regiment.&quot;

During the American Civil War, the Spanish–American War and World War I, the Vermont militia fought under a banner composed of the coat of arms of Vermont surrounded by a white circle with a gold, blue and white outline on a blue field. This was essentially the same as the Vermont governor&#x27;s flag which would later become the current state flag.

Because of confusion between the striped Vermont state flag and the U.S. flag, the design of the Vermont governor&#x27;s flag was adopted as the official state flag on June 1, 1923.

Proposals have been considered to make the flag of the Green Mountain Boys&#x27; the state flag of Vermont, but none have succeeded.

<text>Oliwa forests (; ) is a forest located in the southern part of the Tricity Landscape Park in Gdańsk in northern Poland. The total area is 60 km2.

The forests belonged to the Cistercian monastery in Oliwa since the establishment of the monastery in 1188. Just after the First Partition of Poland, on November 1, 1772, the King of Prussia took over the forests. Today, the forest is managed by &quot;Nadleśnictwo Gdańsk&quot; (Gdańsk forestry), part of the Regional Directorate of State Forests in Gdańsk.

<text>Eastern Connecticut State University (Eastern, Eastern Connecticut, Eastern Connecticut State, or ECSU) is a public university in Willimantic, Connecticut. Founded in 1889, it is the second-oldest campus in the Connecticut State University System and third-oldest public university in the state. Eastern is located on Windham Street in Willimantic, Connecticut, on 30 minutes from Hartford, lying midway between New York City and Boston. Although the majority of courses are held on the main campus, select classes take place at Manchester Community College, Capital Community College, and a satellite center in Groton.

Eastern Connecticut State University is a member of the Connecticut State Colleges &amp; Universities.

==History==
The Connecticut General Assembly established the Willimantic State Normal School in 1889. As a normal school, the institution trained schoolteachers. The first class was of thirteen female students, who attended classes on the third floor of the Willimantic Savings Institute. The first male student entered in 1893.

In 1890, the Town of Windham deeded to the State of Connecticut for the construction of a new campus for the school. The larger campus was completed in 1895. The first dormitory, Burr Hall, opened in September 1921. The institution was renamed Willimantic State Teachers College in 1937, after it began granting bachelor&#x27;s degrees. The original Normal School building was destroyed in a fire and replaced by Shafer Hall, which was dedicated in 1946.

The State College created its first graduate program (in education) in 1953. After expanding its programs and campus, it became Eastern Connecticut State College in 1967, and Eastern Connecticut State University in 1983.

==Academics==
Academically, the university is organized into three schools, the School of Arts and Sciences, the School of Education and Professional Studies, and the School of Continuing Education. Graduate study programs offered through the School of Education and Professional Studies include Education, Teacher Certification, and Organizational Management.
==Rankings==

For 2024, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Eastern tied for #69 out of 178 Regional Universities North, tied for #23 in Regional Universities North Top Public Schools, and #23 in Regional Universities North Best Value Schools.

==Undergraduate admissions==


In 2024, the university accepted 73.8% of undergraduate applicants, with those admitted having an average 3.4 GPA. The university does not require submission of standardized test scores, Eastern being a test optional school. Those submitting test scores had an average 980-1190 SAT score (62% submitting scores) or average 16-28 ACT score (2% submitting scores).
==Institute for Sustainable Energy==
The Institute for Sustainable Energy was opened in 2001 and focuses on sustainable energy education, serving as a source for sustainable energy information, assistance in sustainable energy policy making, and assistance in implementing sustainable energy solutions. The institute is located at 182 High Street. The current director is William Leahy.

In 2012 Eastern had a stationary phosphoric acid fuel cell, known as the PureCell System Model 400, installed on the west side of its Science Building. Eastern will use 100 percent of the energy produced by the fuel cell system to provide a majority of the power required for the Science Building, while maximizing the use of the heat output available. Under a 10-year Energy Services Agreement (ESA) with ClearEdge Power, the installation was made possible by a federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) grant through CEFIA.

==Housing==
87 percent of first-year students, and 60 percent of all full-time undergraduates live in college housing. The campus is separated into first-year halls and upperclassman halls. All students with sophomore status and higher are eligible to live in upperclassman halls. There are six first-year halls, five upperclassman halls and two sets of apartments.

==Student organizations==
Eastern offers more than 80 student organizations in which students can participate, including athletic, political, cultural, artistic and communication clubs. The campus newscast is ETV. The Student Government Association is the liaison between the student body and university administration and each residence hall has a student council that plans events and trips for hall residents.

==Athletics==

Eastern&#x27;s sports teams are known as the &quot;Warriors&quot; and are represented by a logo depicting a shield superior to two crossed swords. The university is a member of the NCAA Division III, the Little East Conference and the Eastern College Athletic Conference. Men&#x27;s varsity sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, lacrosse, soccer, and indoor and outdoor track and field.

<text>Top Secret is an espionage-themed tabletop role-playing game written by Merle M. Rasmussen and first published in 1980 by TSR, Inc.

==&quot;Top Secret&quot; (original edition)==

The original version of &quot;Top Secret&quot; was designed by Merle M. Rasmussen, and allows players and gamemasters to build their own espionage story settings. The original boxed set of the game included a 64-page rule book and a sample adventure, &quot;Operation: Sprechenhaltestelle&quot;. The TSR Product Code for the original boxed set is TSR-7006. The game was developed over a period of two years by Rasmussen and TSR editor Allen Hammack. As part of the playtesting for the game, a note about an imaginary assassination plot written on TSR stationery caused the FBI to come to investigate the offices of TSR Hobbies.

The &quot;Top Secret&quot; game is based exclusively on 10-sided dice. All character attributes and other statistics are percentiles; some scores are rolled, and some are derived from combinations of two or more other scores. &quot;Top Secret&quot; also features &quot;Areas of Knowledge&quot;, which function similarly to skills in more modern RPGs. Characters gain experience points and progress upward in level. The levels had relatively limited in-game effects (most significantly, gained experience points were divided by the character&#x27;s level but the base mission pay was multiplied by the character&#x27;s level). Characters could also improve statistics by spending experience points. &quot;Top Secret&quot; also featured &quot;Fame and Fortune&quot; points. These were the first game mechanics that players could use to alter game results, a concept that continues in many “storytelling” roleplaying games, such as &quot;Fate&quot;.

&quot;Top Secret&quot; characters are employed in specific bureaus—Assassination (Killing), Confiscation (Theft), or Investigation (Research)—all in the structure of an unspecified espionage agency. Despite a character&#x27;s primary vocation, he may be called on to perform any type of mission. The in-game effect of a character&#x27;s bureau was a 100-point experience bonus for mission objectives which fall within that bureau as well as bonus mission pay for those actions specific to the chosen bureau. An appendix in the rule book lists dozens of historical and fictional espionage organizations which could serve as employers or adversaries for missions.

An expansion to the game, &quot;The Top Secret Companion,&quot; introduced enhancements to many game components. It included additional character classes and missions, as well as new Areas of Knowledge and abilities. A revised combat system was introduced that sped up and provided more variety to combat results. New equipment and weapons were introduced as well.

==&quot;Top Secret/S.I.&quot; edition==

In 1987, TSR published &quot;Top Secret/S.I.&quot; (&quot;Special Intelligence&quot;), a revised edition designed by Douglas Niles. The TSR Product Code for the revised boxed set is TSR-7620. &quot;S.I.&quot; introduced a more structured gaming environment in which players worked as agents for secret intelligence agency ORION against its evil adversary, WEB. Later source books in the product line introduce both supernatural (&quot;Agent 13&quot;) and futuristic (&quot;F.R.E.E.Lancers&quot;) adventure settings. These settings introduced several recurring characters such as Sebastian Cord and Agent 13.

The &quot;Top Secret&quot; brand ceased production in 1992. TSR was purchased by Wizards of the Coast in 1997, which in turn was purchased by Hasbro in 1999.

===Combat system===
&quot;Top Secret/S.I.&quot; uses a fast, simple, unified combat system based upon a percentage roll.

The original &quot;Top Secret&quot; uses separate systems for Hand-to-Hand Combat (rock-paper-scissors) and Projectile Combat (two, ten-sided dice).

Combat is divided into 5 second rounds. If necessary, rounds are subdivided into 1 second “phases.” In each round, Weapon Possession and then Hand-to-Hand Combat are resolved first. In each phase, character movement follows Projectile Combat. Characters may move up to 15’ per phase. Weapon firing order is determined by each weapon’s speed and five categories of twenty eight condition modifiers (Drawing, Shooter’s Movement, Wounds, Aiming, and, for the initial round, Surprise Factor).

For Projectile Combat, a character&#x27;s stats, skills, bonuses and penalties; their projectile weapon&#x27;s properties; and the current combat conditions give the character a percentage chance of hitting a target. For each projectile fired, the shooting player rolls two ten-sided dice to give a number from one to one hundred (the first die result indicates the 
&quot;tens,&quot; the second the &quot;ones&quot;). A result equal to or lower than the chance of hitting the target succeeds. The shooting player then rolls additional two ten-sided dice for each success to determine the target hit location. Finally, the shooting player rolls two ten-sided dice to determine damage for each success. With a damage roll, the first die indicates the type of wound (from &quot;abrasion&quot; to &quot;internal damage&quot;) and the second indicates the seriousness of the wound (modified by the type of wound, resulting in one to twelve points of damage to the target&#x27;s general hit points).

For Hand-to-Hand Combat, each combatant in each round chooses from seven combat types (weapon Possession, Untrained, Knife Fighting, Boxing, Sword Play, Judo, and Martial Arts). Each combat type allows the player to choose from a total of up to three attacks and defenses (combined). A combatant may only choose a combat type allowed by their Physical Education or Military Science Knowledge Level. Each combatant secretly chooses their attack(s) and defense(s) from their preferred combat type for that round. The combatants then simultaneously reveal their choices. The gamemaster interprets the combatants&#x27; attack and defense choices, looks up the result on the attack combat types&#x27; tables, and modifies the result by any object used as a hand-to-hand weapon (e.g., purse, boot, tape recorder, bolt cutter). On the martial arts table alone, there are twenty eight attack choices and fifteen defense choices.

===Character sheets===
Character sheets in &quot;Top Secret/S.I.&quot; resemble agent dossiers, and are intended to provide quick and easy reference to all a player&#x27;s stats and skills. They also provide a detailed map of the ten possible hit spots of a character&#x27;s body, and a blank portrait area for drawing or attaching a depiction of the character.

* &quot;Agent 13: The Midnight Avenger&quot; by Flint Dille, David Marconi, and Dan Spiegle 
* &quot;Agent 13: Acolytes of Darkness&quot; (loosely based on the novel)

====Agent 13====
TSR published eight issues of &quot;13: Assassin&quot; comic that featured stories set in the &quot;Agent 13&quot; campaign setting bringing the story to a more modern era (1990s). The first six issues had a back-up story set in the &quot;Top Secret/S.I.&quot; setting (&quot;ORION vs. WEB&quot;) which seemed to take place at the end of the agency&#x27;s covert war. Each issue also contained a miniature game and some issues included character stats for the role-playing game.

====Warhawks====
&quot;Warhawks&quot; was a four issue comic/module series that took the &quot;Top Secret/S.I.&quot; game to a time traveling setting where characters derive powers from tattoos. The four issues featured character stats and served as a campaign book in addition to the comic book adventures.

==&quot;Top Secret: New World Order&quot;==

In June 2017, Merle Rasmussen announced the release of a reboot entitled &quot;Top Secret: New World Order&quot;, a completely new iteration in the series. He had been running the game at conventions and events for two years prior to the release, adjusting the rules and user experience in real-time. The game has an updated rules system to appeal to more modern role-playing gamers.

The Kickstarter page for &quot;Top Secret: New World Order&quot; went live on June 27, 2017. The game began shipping to backers in March 2018.

==Reception==
In Issue 29 of &quot;Space Gamer&quot;, Jerry Epperson reviewed &quot;Top Secret&quot; and commented &quot;I liked the game, despite its faults. The system is new enough that the situations will not become blase (as with other role-playing games) for months or years. And it would be a sound investment for any fans of the James Bond, Executioner, or Avenger stories. Others would be wise to stick with fantasy, if they cannot associate with the heroes of the present.&quot;

In Issue 67 of &quot;The Space Gamer&quot;, W.G. Armintrout compared &quot;Top Secret&quot; to rival spy role-playing games &quot;Espionage!&quot;, and &quot;Mercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes&quot; and commented &quot;&quot;Top Secret&quot; is a good game, though I think both of the newer games slightly eclipse it. It has the best combat system of the three — being neither too simple nor too complicated — and the widest variety of &#x27;fun&#x27; devices. Adventures are readily available for it. On the other hand, &quot;Top Secret&quot; is pretty lame when it comes to non-combat situations. If I were TSR, I&#x27;d be thinking about a new edition of the game to stay competitive.&quot;

Thomas M. Kane reviewed &quot;Top Secret/S.I.&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #9 (1988), rating it a 7 out of 10 (8 if there were no original &quot;Top Secret&quot;) and stated that &quot;The &quot;Top Secret/S.I.&quot; game would be marvelous for anyone new to modern era role-playing and &quot;Top Secret&quot; veterans should also consider it, though not at the cost of ruining and established campaign. The game&#x27;s few flaws can be corrected by an astute GM.&quot;

In his 1990 book &quot;The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games&quot;, game critic Rick Swan called &quot;Top Secret&quot; &quot;The first espionage RPG of any consequence&quot; and thought the game &quot;holds up amazingly well even a decade after its release.&quot; Swan admitted that most of the character generation system had been borrowed from &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, but thought this was overshadowed by the &quot;gadgets galore&quot; as well as &quot;a first-rate combat system.&quot; Swan concluded by giving &quot;Top Secret&quot; a solid rating of 3 out of 4. 

In the same book, Swan also reviewed &quot;Top Secret/S.I.&quot; and liked it even more than its predecessor, calling it &quot;not only an improvement in every respect, it&#x27;s also the best espionage RPG on the market, a masterful integration of elegant mechanics, evocative atmosphere, and sleek graphics.&quot; Swan concluded by giving &quot;Top Secret/S.I.&quot; a top grade of 4 out of 4, saying, &quot;Beautifully packaged, meticulously organized, and thoroughly entertaining, &quot;Top Secret/S.I&quot; is a near-flawless balance of playability and realism. This is secret-agent role-playing at its streamlined best.&quot;

In a 1996 reader survey conducted by British games magazine &quot;Arcane&quot; to determine the top 50 role-playing games, &quot;Top Secret/S.I.&quot; was ranked 38th. Editor Paul Pettengale commented: &quot;&quot;Top Secret&quot; is inspired more by &quot;The Man From U.N.C.L.E.&quot; and the lighter James Bond movies than real life. Players belong to an organisation of &#x27;good guys&#x27; pitted against the &#x27;bad guys&#x27; — a thinly veiled analogy of the Eastern Bloc. Gadgets and manners are more important than combat skills, and there are rarely nasty deaths.&quot;

<text>The state flag of Washington consists of the state seal, displaying an image of its namesake George Washington, on a field of dark green with gold fringe being optional. It is the only U.S. state flag with a field of green as well as the only state flag with the likeness of a U.S. president. The secretary of state regulates flag protocol related to the state flag, as well approving replica flags for commercial sale and other standards related to the flag.

The flag was officially adopted on March 5, 1923, and has been a symbol of Washington ever since. Washington had achieved statehood in 1889, but did not have an official flag at the time. The Washington chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution designed the flag in 1915 and campaigned for its adoption by the Washington State Legislature in the early 1920s. The state flag has undergone minor revisions since its adoption, including the use of standardized colors in 1955 and a modernized seal in 1967.

==History==
Washington adopted its seal during the state constitutional convention on August 21, 1889, months prior to official admission as a U.S. state on November 11, 1889. While the new state did not have an official flag, a military flag displaying a gold profile of George Washington, the state&#x27;s namesake, on blue bunting was used across the state at the turn of the 20th century and was first carried by the Washington Volunteer Infantry during the Philippine–American War in 1899. Another popular design was a purple or green flag bearing the state seal in gold.

In 1913, representative William J. Hughes of Whatcom County proposed the formation of a commission to adopt the state flag, consisting of the governor, secretary of state, and adjutant general. Governor Ernest Lister became a supporter of the idea, issuing a call for designs from the state&#x27;s citizens and city organizations. The campaign for a state flag, however, was opposed by patriotic groups like the Sons of the American Revolution and Sons of Veterans, finding the use of a state flag to be detrimental to the national flag. Hughes&#x27; bill was passed 69–20 in the state House of Representatives, but did not make it to the floor in the state senate.

The Washington chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) began a campaign to adopt an official state flag during the Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition of 1909, a world&#x27;s fair hosted in Seattle. In 1914, the national DAR requested that the Washington chapter send a state flag to be displayed in the DAR Memorial Continental Hall in Washington, D.C. Upon discovering that the state lacked a suitable flag, the DAR formed a design committee, led by Emma Chadwick (wife of Washington Supreme Court justice Stephen J. Chadwick), to design a state flag. The DAR&#x27;s flag, adopted in 1915, consisted of a green background with the state seal in the center. The flag was manufactured in Washington, D.C., at a cost of $48 (), and displayed by the national DAR until 1916. The flag was returned to the Washington chapter for their April 1916 general meeting in Everett, where DAR State Regent Elizabeth Bowden called on the chapter to ask the legislature to accept the flag as an official state symbol.

A 1917 issue of &quot;National Geographic Magazine&quot; on U.S. state flags featured an unofficial flag of Washington similar to the DAR&#x27;s design, a green background and the state seal in gold, sourced from &quot;military authorities&quot;. Another major flag proposal emerged in 1920 from the short-lived Washington State Nautical School, where secretary-treasurer Grover C. Gaier designed a green flag with the state seal and fringe in gold. The flag would fly aboard the , representing the state nautical school during a voyage along the West Coast and to Hawaii.
The DAR renewed its lobbying for a state flag in 1922, having gained the approval of the Sons of the American Revolution and other civic organizations. A bill adopting the state flag was introduced in the 1923 legislative session and passed unanimously in the Senate by February, and the House of Representatives on March 5, 1923. The governor&#x27;s approval was not required and the bill became law, formally adopting the state flag. The law took effect on June 7, 1923, and an unofficial flag was unfurled on Flag Day by the DAR. At the time of its adoption, Washington was one of four states lacking an official state flag. The first official state flag, manufactured by Willis Bloom of the secretary of state&#x27;s office, was unveiled on July 23, 1924. The new flag was celebrated with a &quot;State Flag Waltz&quot; performed at the Inaugural Ball on January 15, 1925, following the inauguration of Governor Roland H. Hartley.

During the 1925–26 session, the state legislature approved a change to the state flag that replaced the green fringe with a gold to match the state seal. The gold-fringed flag made its official debut on June 27, 1927, flying on the official automobile of the governor during a tour of Fort Lewis. In 1929, the DAR presented a state flag to Governor Hartley, who received it on behalf of the state for display in the Washington State Capitol.

The Washington Secretary of State issued standardized colors for the state flag in 1955, including the modern colors used in the state seal. The state seal itself was redesigned by Dick Nelms at the request of the secretary of state in 1967, using Gilbert Stuart&#x27;s famous portrait painting of George Washington. The new state seal was approved by the state legislature in April 1967, placing it on the updated state flag with immediate effect.

===Proposed redesign===
As part of the United States Bicentennial in 1976, the Santa Barbara Museum of Art held a nationwide contest for new flags for American states, cities, and other entities. A panel of judges selected 25 of the best designs to be displayed at various exhibitions around the United States, including at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Among the selected designs was a proposed flag for Washington, designed by Seattle designer Terrence A. Geiger, that featured green and yellow triangles in a repeated pattern.

A bill to form a redesign committee to produce a new state flag was proposed by a state legislator in 2025. The committee would include a bipartisan set of lawmakers, the Washington Secretary of State, the director of the Washington Arts Commission, historians, cultural leaders, tribal members, and citizens. A new design would be recommended by July 1, 2028 and require a referendum to be officially adopted as the state flag. The bill is in response to a wave of state flag redesigns that had been adopted or proposed in the 2020s.

==Design==

The flag of Washington consists of a dark green field with the seal of Washington, a portrait of George Washington inside a ring with the words &quot;The Seal of the State of Washington 1889&quot;, in the center. The flag may also have an optional gold fringe. It is the only U.S. state flag to feature a green background, as well as the only one to feature the likeness of an identifiable historic person. The flag has an aspect ratio of 1:1.6 (equivalent to 5:8), with the exception of two alternate flag sizes: and . The size of the seal is proportional to the length of the flag, with a ratio of 1:3 between the seal diameter and length of the flag. On a flag, the seal has a diameter of .

The flag&#x27;s colors follow both the Standard Color Reference of America, and the Pantone Matching System. According to Senator Guy B. Groff, sponsor of the 1923 bill that adopted the flag, the flag&#x27;s green field represented the &quot;verdant fields&quot; of Western Washington, while the gold seal represented the &quot;wheat areas&quot; of Eastern Washington.

In 2001, the North American Vexillological Association surveyed its members and other flag enthusiasts on the designs of the 72 U.S. state, U.S. territorial, and Canadian provincial flags. Members ranked the Washington state flag 47th out of the 72 flags surveyed, with a score of 4.53 points out of 10. Washington&#x27;s flag was criticized for its complicated seal, use of lettering, and similarities to other U.S. state flags that used seals on solid colors.


==Usage and protocol==
The Washington Secretary of State regulates flag protocol as well as the distribution and sale of the state flag. Replica flags made for commercial sale are required to be approved by the secretary of state. The state seal on the flag must be stitched on both sides with the profile of George Washington facing the same direction, making the Washington state flag among the most expensive U.S. state flags to manufacture.

When flown within the state of Washington, the state flag occupies the highest position of honor after the U.S. flag and the flags of foreign sovereign states. When flown alongside other U.S. state flags, the Washington state flag is placed 42nd, the order in which it ratified the U.S. Constitution and became a state. A section of the &quot;Revised Code of Washington&quot; also requires that the state flag and the U.S. flag &quot;shall be prominently installed, displayed and maintained in schools, court rooms and state buildings.&quot; The state flag and U.S. flag are also required to be prominently displayed by code cities and displayed on certain holidays by all cities, towns, and counties.

The lowering of the state and U.S. flags to half-mast is left at the discretion of local entities, but may be ordered by the Governor of Washington during the observance of memorial days, as well as in the event of the death of prominent government officials, state employees, public safety servants in the line of duty, and members of the United States Armed Forces from Washington.

<text>The Computer Science Network (CSNET) was a computer network that began operation in 1981 in the United States. Its purpose was to extend networking benefits, for computer science departments at academic and research institutions that could not be directly connected to ARPANET, due to funding or authorization limitations. It played a significant role in spreading awareness of, and access to, national networking and was a major milestone on the path to development of the global Internet. CSNET was funded by the National Science Foundation for an initial three-year period from 1981 to 1984.

==History==

Lawrence Landweber at the University of Wisconsin–Madison prepared the original CSNET proposal, on behalf of a consortium of universities (Georgia Tech, University of Minnesota, University of New Mexico, University of Oklahoma, Purdue University, University of California, Berkeley, University of Utah, University of Virginia, University of Washington, University of Wisconsin, and Yale University). The US National Science Foundation (NSF) requested a review from David J. Farber at the University of Delaware. Farber assigned the task to his graduate student Dave Crocker who was already active in the development of electronic mail. The project was deemed interesting but in need of significant refinement. The proposal eventually gained the support of Vinton Cerf and DARPA. In 1980, the NSF awarded $5 million to launch the network. It was an unusually large project for the NSF at the time.
A stipulation for the award of the contract was that the network needed to become self-sufficient by 1986.

The first management team consisted of Landweber (University of Wisconsin), Farber (University of Delaware), Peter J. Denning (Purdue University), Anthony C. Hearn (RAND Corporation), and Bill Kern from the NSF. Once CSNET was fully operational, the systems and ongoing network operations were transferred to a team led by Richard Edmiston at Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN) of Cambridge, Massachusetts by 1984.

The Purdue team, consisting of Peter Denning, Douglas Comer, and Paul McNabb, was responsible for designing and building the kernel interfaces that would allow sites outside of the ARPANET infrastructure to connect via public X.25 networks, such as Telenet. The mechanism allowed systems with TCP/IP network stacks to use an X.25 network device, with IP datagrams being sent through dynamically allocated X.25 sessions. Purdue and other sites with ARPANET access would act as gateways into the ARPANET, allowing non-ARPANet sites to have email, telnet, ftp, and other forms of network access directly into the ARPANET.

By 1981, three sites were connected: University of Delaware, Princeton University, and Purdue University. By 1982, 24 sites were connected expanding to 84 sites by 1984, including one in Israel. Soon thereafter, connections were established to computer science departments in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Korea, and Japan. CSNET eventually connected more than 180 institutions.

One of the earliest experiments in free software distribution on a network, netlib, was available on CSNET.

CSNET was a forerunner of the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNet) which eventually became a backbone of the Internet. CSNET operated autonomously until 1989, when it merged with Bitnet to form the Corporation for Research and Educational Networking (CREN). By 1991, the success of the NSFNET and NSF-sponsored regional networks had rendered the CSNET services redundant, and the CSNET network was shut down in October 1991.

==Components==
The CSNET project had three primary components: an email relaying service (Delaware and RAND), a name service (Wisconsin), and TCP/IP-over-X.25 tunnelling technology (Purdue). Initial access was with email relaying, through gateways at Delaware and RAND, over dial-up telephone or X.29/X.25 terminal emulation. Eventually CSNET access added TCP/IP, including running over X.25.

The email relaying service was called Phonenet, after the telephone-specific channel of the MMDF software developed by Crocker. The CSNET name service allowed manual and automated email address lookup based on various user attributes, such as name, title, or institution. The X.25 tunneling allowed an institution to connect directly to the ARPANET via a commercial X.25 service (Telenet), by which the institution&#x27;s TCP/IP traffic would be tunneled to a CSNET computer that acted as a relay between the ARPANET and the commercial X.25 networks. CSNET also developed dialup-on-demand (Dialup IP) software to automatically initiate or disconnect SLIP sessions as needed to remote locations. CSNET was developed on Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) VAX-11 systems using BSD Unix, but it grew to support a variety of hardware and operating system platforms.

==Recognition==
At the July 2009 Internet Engineering Task Force meeting in Stockholm, Sweden, the Internet Society recognized the pioneering contribution of CSNET by honoring it with the Jonathan B. Postel Service Award. Crocker accepted the award on behalf of Landweber and the other principal investigators. A recording of the award presentation and acceptance is available.

<text>The state flag of the U.S. state of West Virginia was officially adopted by the West Virginia Legislature on March 7, 1929. The present flag consists of a pure white field bordered by a blue stripe with the coat of arms of West Virginia in the center, wreathed by &quot;Rhododendron maximum&quot; and topped by an unfurled red ribbon reading, &quot;State of West Virginia.&quot; It is the only state flag to bear crossing rifles, meant to illustrate the importance of the state&#x27;s fight for liberty during the American Civil War as the southern unionist 35th state.

The first flags to represent West Virginia following statehood were battle flags utilized by West Virginia regiments during the American Civil War. West Virginia&#x27;s first official state flag was adopted in 1905, based upon the flag designed and used by the West Virginia State Commission at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in 1904. This flag was altered in 1907 for the Jamestown Exposition and featured the coat of arms on the obverse and a sprig of &quot;Rhododendron maximum&quot; on the reverse. In order to reproduce the flag more inexpensively, the West Virginia Legislature ratified the current flag with the state&#x27;s coat of arms integrated with the rhododendron, which appears on both the obverse and the reverse. The &quot;Pledge of Allegiance to the West Virginia State Flag&quot; was unanimously adopted by the office of the Secretary of State of West Virginia in 1977.

== Design ==

The current state flag of West Virginia consists of a pure white field bordered on four sides by a stripe of blue. The white of the field symbolizes purity, while the blue border represents the Union. The center of the state flag is emblazoned with the state&#x27;s coat of arms, a stylized version of the Great Seal of West Virginia. The lower half of the state flag is wreathed by two tethered swags of &quot;Rhododendron maximum&quot;, the state flower of West Virginia. Across the top of the state flag is an unfurled red ribbon with the constitutional designation &quot;State of West Virginia&quot;, and across the bottom of the state flag is a tied red ribbon with the state&#x27;s Latin motto &quot;Montani Semper Liberi&quot; (English: &quot;mountaineers are always free&quot;).

The state&#x27;s coat of arms in the center of the flag symbolizes the principal pursuits and resources of West Virginia. In the center is an ivy-draped boulder that has been inscribed &quot;June 20, 1863,&quot; the date of West Virginia&#x27;s admission to the Union as a state. In front of the boulder lie two crossed hunting rifles and a Phrygian cap (or &quot;Cap of Liberty&quot;) to illustrate the importance of the state&#x27;s fight for liberty. Two men, a farmer and a miner, stand on either side of the boulder and represent agriculture and industry. The farmer stands on the left with an ax and plow before a cornstalk and a sheaf of wheat. The miner stands on the right with a pickaxe and, behind him, two barrels, an anvil and sledge hammer.

The state flag&#x27;s proportions are identical to those of the flag of the United States. When utilized for parade purposes, all but the staff side of the state flag are to be trimmed with gold fringe. When used concurrently with the flag of the United States during ceremonial occasions, the state flag is trimmed and mounted like the United States flag with regard to fringe, cord, tassels, and mounting.

== History ==

Prior to the adoption of the current state flag of West Virginia, the state had been represented by a number of flags since attaining statehood in 1863, all of which proved impractical. The first West Virginia Legislature commissioned Joseph H. Diss Debar of Doddridge County to design the Great Seal of West Virginia in 1863. On September 26, 1863, the West Virginia Legislature officially adopted the seal designed by Diss Debar, a stylized version of which was also designated the state&#x27;s coat of arms. Despite the adoption of an official seal, the state did not decide upon an official state flag until 1905.

=== American Civil War ===

Prior to West Virginia&#x27;s separation from Virginia on June 20, 1863, pro-Union supporters in western Virginia created unique flags to show their support for the Union cause. In January 1861, the residents of Kingwood erected a flagpole measuring about in height, and on it they hoisted a handmade streamer with the word &quot;UNION&quot; prior to Virginia&#x27;s secession. During the war, western Virginia regiments in the Union Army carried flags handmade by supportive women, as was the case with the Fifth Regiment Virginia Volunteer Infantry who carried a flag bearing the legend &quot;5th Va. Regiment&quot; in 1861.
In January 1864, the West Virginia Legislature approved a flag for the Fourth Regiment West Virginia Volunteer Infantry to acknowledge the regiment&#x27;s battles at Charleston, Vicksburg, Jackson, and Missionary Ridge, all four of which were listed on the flag. This was the first among many battle flags to represent West Virginia after statehood which were utilized by soldiers of West Virginia regiments throughout the war. State battle flags were presented to each of West Virginia&#x27;s Union regiments during the course of the war. These early state flags were squares of silk cloth measuring , and were dark blue and trimmed with golden fringe. The obverse side of these flags were painted with the state&#x27;s newly minted seal within an oval, along with the name of the respective West Virginia regiment and the names and dates of the battles in which they had participated. On the reverse side, the United States national emblem was painted and consisted of a bald eagle with its wings outstretched, clutching a bundle of 13 arrows in its right talon and an olive branch in its left, and a tricolor shield placed across its breast. In its beak, the eagle clutched a scroll with the national Latin motto &quot;E pluribus unum&quot; (English: &quot;Out of Many, One&quot;). Following the conclusion of the American Civil War, the state of West Virginia had no official flag, and the matter was not taken up until the early 20th century.

=== 1905 flag ===

The need for an official state flag arose in 1904 when the West Virginia State Commission to the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis reported that the state required a flag or ensign to represent and distinguish itself among the other U.S. states at the exposition. In lieu of an official state flag, the commission adopted and used a state flag of its own design at the West Virginia building at the exposition, which was a &quot;sprig of mountain laurel upon an immaculate white field with a pale blue border&quot;.

In its report to the West Virginia Legislature, the West Virginia State Commission recommended the adoption of their flag design as the official state flag. On February 24, 1905, the West Virginia Legislature ratified the commission&#x27;s flag design following its passage of Joint Resolution Number 16 during the gubernatorial administration of Albert B. White. The legislature adopted the commission&#x27;s flag design, with the addition of a fringe or border of carmine red. The state flag was approved by the legislature to be employed on occasions where a special display of the state&#x27;s individuality was necessary or regarded as appropriate. According to the 1905 joint resolution:

Following its formal adoption by the legislature, schools and other institutions throughout West Virginia began flying the new state flag. The teachers and students at the schools in Ronceverte purchased the new state flag in June 1906, which measured in length, and used it along with the United States flag for salutes and patriotic exercises.

=== 1907 flag ===
By 1907, the West Virginia Legislature found the 1905 state flag design to be completely unfeasible due to the lettering on one side reading toward the staff, and the differing colors on each respective side showing through the opposite side of the flag&#x27;s white field of cloth. The state legislature found that this destroyed &quot;the distinctive features of the banner and leaving the state without a prescribed official flag&quot;. The West Virginia Legislature sought to remedy the state flag&#x27;s design flaws in 1907 so that the state could be properly represented at the Jamestown Exposition in Norfolk. On February 25, 1907, during the administration of Governor William M. O. Dawson, the West Virginia Legislature passed Joint Resolution 2, which amended the flag by removing the seal and motto from the reverse side and changing the color of the bordering fringe from carmine red to old gold. Instead of the seal and motto, the reverse of the flag was changed to consist of &quot;a spring or sprig of the rhododendron maximum&quot;. According to the 1907 joint resolution:

=== 1929 flag ===
The flag design ratified in 1907 remained the state&#x27;s official flag until 1929. The state of West Virginia sought a flag design that could be produced inexpensively so that the state flag could be mass-produced for the state&#x27;s public schools. The 1907 flag proved to be more costly to reproduce due to the two different symbols on each side of the banner, the state&#x27;s coat of arms on the obverse and the state&#x27;s flower on the reverse. The West Virginia Legislature decided the state flag should be stamped with a design that would integrate both the coat of arms and the state flower on both sides. The design of the present state flag was officially adopted by the West Virginia Legislature on March 7, 1929, by West Virginia Senate Joint Resolution Number 18. According to the joint resolution:

In 2001, the North American Vexillological Association surveyed its members and other flag enthusiasts on the designs of the 72 U.S. state, U.S. territorial, and Canadian provincial flags. Members ranked the West Virginia state flag at 51 out of the 72 flags surveyed. U.S. state flags with state seals on solid-color fields, like the West Virginia state flag, proved unpopular in the survey.

== Usage and protocol ==

The West Virginia Legislature has passed a series of laws in the West Virginia Code governing the usage of the West Virginia state flag. The state flag is not permitted to be placed above, or if on the same level, to the right of the United States flag. Both the United States and West Virginia state flags are to be flown over the West Virginia State Capitol building year-round. Any United States or West Virginia state flag purchased with state funds must be manufactured in the United States; and West Virginia county boards of education must only purchase state flags manufactured in the United States if board building funds are used. To honor the death of law-enforcement officers within the state, the West Virginia Code permits the draping of the state flag over the coffin at no cost, upon the request of the next-of-kin.

===Half-mast protocol===
Effective July 18, 2013, the office of West Virginia Governor Earl Ray Tomblin established guidelines in accordance with the United States Code and West Virginia precedent and customs regarding the half-mast display of United States and West Virginia state flags on West Virginia state properties. Both the United States and West Virginia state flags are to be hoisted to full-mast, before being lowered to the half-mast position; likewise both flags are to be hoisted full-mast prior to being lowered for the day. Both flags are only to be displayed in the half-mast position in accordance with Federal law on the following occasions:
* Memorial Day (the last Monday in May): flags are displayed at half-mast from sunrise until noon, then raised to full-mast.
* Peace Officers Memorial Day (May 15): flags are displayed at half-mast for the entire day, unless that day is also Armed Forces Day (the third Saturday in May).
* Patriot Day (September 11): flags are displayed at half-mast for the entire day.
* National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day (December 7): flags are displayed at half-mast for the entire day.
* Flags are displayed at half-mast for 30 days following the day of death of either a current or former President of the United States.
* Flags are displayed at half-mast for ten days following the day of death of the Vice President of the United States, the Chief Justice or retired Chief Justice of the United States, or the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives.
* Flags are displayed at half-mast from the day of death until the day of interment of a former vice president, an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, a Secretary of an executive or military department of the United States, or a Governor of a U.S. state, territory, or possession.
* Flags are displayed at half-mast on the day of death and the following day for a member of the United States Congress.
* Flags displayed at half-mast on state properties following a proclamation by the Governor of West Virginia during other unique instances outlined in the 2013 guidelines.

=== Desecration ===

According to West Virginia state law, the desecration of either the flag of the United States or the West Virginia state flag is an offense punishable as a misdemeanor and upon conviction, a guilty verdict can result in a fine &quot;not less than five nor more than one hundred dollars,&quot; or confinement in jail &quot;for a period not exceeding thirty days&quot; at &quot;the discretion of the court or justice trying the case.&quot;

However, such laws are unenforceable as the United States Supreme Court in &quot;Texas v. Johnson&quot;, , and reaffirmed in &quot;U.S. v. Eichman&quot;, , has ruled that due to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, it is unconstitutional for a government (whether federal, state, or municipality) to prohibit the desecration of a flag, due to its status as &quot;symbolic speech.&quot;

== Pledge of allegiance ==
On February 8, 1977, the office of the Secretary of State of West Virginia unanimously adopted the &quot;Pledge of Allegiance to the West Virginia State Flag.&quot; The motion to adopt the pledge was made by Charles S. Smith and seconded by Carol J. Calvert. The pledge reads as follows:

<text>The Macau (Yat Yuen) Canidrome Club (), located in Nossa Senhora de Fátima, Macau, was a greyhound racing stadium in Asia. Around 120 dogs took part in 16 races five days per week. It had two grandstands, several private boxes and a VIP lounge. It shared the venue with Lin Fong Sports Centre, a sport complex.

== History ==

The Canidrome opened in 1932 but was closed in 1938 due to the Second Sino-Japanese War. It reopened in 1963.

On 21 July 2016, the Gaming and Inspection Bureau (DICJ) of Macau, Paulo Martins Chan, met with representatives of the Canidrome. It was later announced that the government presented the greyhound racing facility with an ultimatum: close down or move to another site in two years.

The Canidrome closed on 21 July 2018. After negotiations with the track&#x27;s owner and intense fundraising by an international group of volunteer-run, greyhound adoption organizations led by Anima, 517 greyhounds received veterinary medical care and were shuttled out to be adopted in Europe, North America, Australia, and, for a few, locally in Macau.

==Future use==
In August 2018, the Land, Public Works and Transport Bureau (DSSOPT) revealed that around two-thirds of the total area would continue to be used for sports activities, including the expansion of the existing Lin Fong Sports Centre, another 20% of the space would host education facilities, it was also revealed that an underground stormwater storage tank would be built below the sports facilities. This was included in the plan so as to mitigate the risk of flooding. There will also be a parking lot with a minimum capacity of 400 parking spaces. However, in July 2019, the &quot;Macau Daily Times&quot; found the land plot in a state of neglect and decay.

<doc id="497303" wikidata="Q1083894" url="?curid=497303" title="Digital terrestrial television">
<text>Digital terrestrial television (DTTV, DTT, or DTTB) is a technology for terrestrial television, in which television stations broadcast television content in a digital format. Digital terrestrial television is a major technological advancement over analog television, and has largely replaced analog television broadcasting, which was previously in common use since the middle of the 20th century.

Test broadcasts began in 1998, and the changeover to digital television began in 2006 and is now complete in many countries. The advantages of digital terrestrial television are similar to those obtained by digitizing platforms such as cable TV, satellite, and telecommunications: more efficient use of radio spectrum bandwidth, the ability to broadcast more channels than analog, better quality images, and potentially lower operating costs for broadcasters.

Different countries have adopted different digital broadcasting standards. Some of the major ones are:
* ATSC DTV – Advanced Television Standards Committee (System A)
* ATSC-M/H – Advanced Television Systems Committee Mobile and Handheld
* DTMB, DMB-T/H
* DVB-H – Digital Video Broadcasting Handheld
* DVB-T/DVB-T2 – Digital Video Broadcasting Terrestrial (System B)
* ISDB-T – Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Terrestrial (System C)* 
* ISDB-Tsb – Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting-Terrestrial Sound Broadcasting – (System F)
* FLO – Forward Link Only (System M)

== Transmission ==
Digital terrestrial television is transmitted using radio frequencies through terrestrial space in the same way as the former analog television systems, with the primary difference being the use of multiplex transmitters to allow reception of multiple services (TV, radio stations or data) on a single frequency (such as a UHF or VHF channel).

The amount of data that can be transmitted (and therefore the number of channels) is directly affected by channel capacity and the modulation method of the transmission.

North America and South Korea use the ATSC standard with 8VSB modulation, which has similar characteristics to the vestigial sideband modulation used for analog television. This provides considerably more immunity to interference, but it is not immune to multipath distortion, and also does not provide for single-frequency network operation (which is in any case not a requirement in the United States).

The modulation method used in DVB-T is COFDM, with either 64 or 16-state Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM). In general, 64QAM is capable of transmitting at a greater bit rate, but it is more susceptible to interference. 16 and 64QAM constellations can be combined in a single multiplex, providing a controllable degradation for more important program streams. This is called hierarchical modulation. DVB-T (and even more so DVB-T2) are tolerant of multipath distortion and are designed to work in single-frequency networks.

Developments in video compression have resulted in improvements on the original discrete cosine transform (DCT) based H.262 MPEG-2 video coding format, which has been surpassed by H.264/MPEG-4 AVC and more recently H.265 HEVC. H.264 enables three high-definition television services to be coded into a 24 Mbit/s DVB-T European terrestrial transmission channel. DVB-T2 increases this channel capacity to typically 40 Mbit/s, allowing even more services.

== Reception ==

Digital terrestrial television is received either via a digital set-top box (STB), TV gateway, or more usually now, an integrated tuner in a television set, that operates on the signal received via a television antenna. These devices often now include digital video recorder (DVR) functionality.

Due to frequency planning issues, an aerial capable of receiving different channel groups, like a wideband antenna, may be required if the digital signal multiplexes lie outside the reception capabilities of the originally installed aerial. Indoor aerials are more likely to be affected by these issues.

== Digital terrestrial television around the world ==

== Asia ==
=== Afghanistan ===

Afghanistan officially launched digital transmissions in Kabul using DVB-T2/MPEG-4 on Sunday, 31 August 2014. Test transmissions had commenced on 4 UHF channels at the start of June 2014. Transmitters were provided by GatesAir.

=== Bangladesh ===

Bangladesh had its first DTT service DVB-T2/MPEG-4 on 28 April 2016 launched by the GS Group. The service is called RealVU.

It was done in partnership with Beximco. GS Group acts as a supplier and integrator of its in-house hardware and software solutions for the operator&#x27;s functioning in accordance with the modern standards of digital television. RealVu provides more than 100 TV channels in SD and HD quality.

The digital TV set-top boxes developed by GS Group offer such functions as PVR and time-shift, along with an EPG.

=== India ===

India adopted the DVB-T system for digital television in July 1999. The first DVB-T transmission was started on 26 January 2003 in the four major metropolitan cities by Doordarshan. Currently the terrestrial transmission is available in both digital and analog formats. Four high-power DVB-T transmitters were set up in the top 4 cities, which were later upgraded to DVB-T2 + MPEG-4 and DVB-H standards. An additional 190 high-power and 400 low-power DVB-T2 transmitters have been approved for Tier I, II, and III cities of the country by 2017. The Indian telecom regulator, TRAI, had recommended the I&amp;B to allow private broadcast companies to use the DTT technology, in 2005. So far, the Indian I&amp;B ministry only permits private broadcast companies to use satellite, cable, and IPTV-based systems. The government&#x27;s broadcasting organisation Doordarshan started the free TV service over DVB-T2 to mobile phone users from 25 February onwards and extended it to cover 16 cities including the four metros from 5 April 2016.

=== Israel ===

Israel started digital transmissions in MPEG-4 on Sunday, 2 August 2009, and analogue transmissions ended on 31 March 2011. Israel was the first nation in the Middle East and the first non-European nation to shut down its analogue TV distribution system. The new service which is operated by The Second Authority for Television and Radio in Israel currently offers 6 SD TV channels, 2 HD TV channels from IPBC - Israel Public Broadcasting Corporation (Kan 11 and Makan 33) and 30 national and regional (private) radio services.

According to government decisions, the system will expand to include two additional multiplexes that will carry new channels and HD versions of the existing channels. There is a proposition by the Ministry of Finance to run a tender in order to hand over the maintenance of the system to a private company that, in return, will receive an extended license and will be able to offer pay TV channels. In this matter, nothing has been decided upon until the end of 2012. Eventually, there were no further moves in this direction (updated in August 2023).

On 20 March 2013, it was announced that Thomson Broadcast had won a major contract with The Second Authority for Television and Radio for the extension of its nationwide DVB-T/DVB-T2 network. The Second Authority&#x27;s order for new infrastructure includes two new multiplexes on thirty sites including three single-frequency areas. This major deal incorporates a three-year service agreement for the global transmission system.

Sixty-three high and medium-power transmitters from Thomson&#x27;s GreenPower range have been ordered together with installation and commissioning services, in a deal that follows on from the company&#x27;s earlier deployment of DVB-T multiplexes over thirty transmission and sixty-two repeater sites. Equipped with dualcast-ready digital exciters, the GreenPower range offers the ability to smoothly migrate from DVB-T to DVB-T2 and to easily offer additional HDTV content. Ranging from low- to high-power, the range covers all the power requirements of The Second Authority. Thomson will also deploy its user-friendly centralized Network Management System to control and monitor the overall transmission system from a single facility.

The deal includes a new service level agreement providing The Second Authority with a high level of local services to keep its currently operating DTV transmission equipment running 24/7, 365 days a year.

=== Japan ===

The Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications and DPA (The Association for Promotion of Digital Broadcasting-Japan) jointly set the specification and announced a guideline for &quot;simplified DTT tuners&quot; with price under 5,000 Japanese yen on 25 December 2007. MIAC officially solicited manufacturers to put it on the market by the end of March 2010 (end of fiscal year 2009). MIAC is estimating that 14 million, at maximum, traditional non-digital TV sets remain and need the &quot;simplified DTT tuner&quot; to be adapted even after the complete transition to DTT after July 2011; it is aiming to avoid the disposal of large numbers of useless TV sets without such a tuner at one time.

On 20 December 2007, the Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association published rules for Digital Rights Management for DTT broadcasting under the name &quot;Dubbing 10&quot;. Despite the name, consumers were allowed to use Blu-ray Disc and other recorders to &quot;dub&quot; or copy the video and audio of entire TV programs up to 9 times, with 1 final &quot;move&quot; permitted.

Broadcasting with &quot;Dubbing 10&quot; was supposed to start at about 4:00 a.m. on 2 June 2008, but was postponed after lengthy talks with the Japanese Society for Rights of Authors, Composers and Publishers. It finally started about 4:00 a.m. on 4 July 2008. The manufacturers of DVD and DTT recorders were to make units conforming to the &quot;Dubbing 10&quot; rules, and some manufacturers announced plans for create firmware downloads to allow users to update their existing recorders.

On 3 April 2008, DPA announced that a total of 32.71 million of DTT (ISDB-T) TV sets capable of DTT reception (excepting 1seg receivers) had been installed in Japan as of the end of March 2008. On 8 April 2008, DPA also announced guidelines for manufacturers of DTT receiving, record and replay unit which operate with personal computers. These add-on units operate on USB or PCI BUS, and went on sale on a reservation basis from late April, appearing in retail store in mid-May 2008.

On 8 May 2008, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications announced that 43.7% of homes had DTT (ISDB-T) capable TVs and/or tuners with DVD recorder by end of March 2008. It had been 27.8% one year before, and the ministry was expecting 100% penetration by April 2011. On 27 April 2009, National Association of Commercial Broadcasters in Japan (NAB) a new official mascot, Chidejika, to replace Tsuyoshi Kusanagi after he was arrested on suspicion of public indecency.

On 3 September 2009, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications announced the procurement by tender of 5,000-8,000 sets of &quot;simplified DTT tuners&quot; with remote control for the citywide test transition from analogue to digital in Suzu, Ishikawa. The sets should be delivered by end November 2009. The program is aiming to examine the transition problem at individuals&#x27; home in country wide such as senior and non-technical families. Based on this rehearsal plan, analog TV transmission was interrupted in Suzu and parts of Noto for 48 hours, between noon on 2010/01/22 and noon on 2010/01/24.

On 4 September 2009, ÆON announced the low cost &quot;simplified DTT tuners&quot; with remote control for ISDB-T to sell at JUSCO from 19 September 2009. The tuner is produced by Pixela Corporation, and met the retail price of under 5,000 Japanese yen, which is the target price to industry by DPA (). The tuner connects to an old fashioned TV though an RCA connector with SDTV quality and some other minimal functions.

On 7 September 2009, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications appointed two manufacturers I-O Data and Melco among 12 bids for minimal functioning &quot;simplified DTT tuners&quot; with remote control for ISDB-T of free supply to Japanese Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. Tuner connects to old fashion TV though RCA connector with SDTV quality and some other minimal function. On 24 July 2010, at noon, analog TV transmission officially stopped in Suzu and parts of Noto (approximately 8,800 homes) as the rehearsal plan that took place one year ahead of the nationwide shutdown, which is scheduled on 24 July 2011. Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications shall watch what type of problem arise in transition to DTT which might apply to the nationwide shutdown.
On 20 April 2011, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications confirmed, and made the resolution by the House of Councillors on 8 June 2011, that the analog terrestrial TV close down schedule on 24 July 2011 will be unchanged, with the exception being the close down having to be postponed by a maximum one year. Analog television shut down on 31 March 2012, in Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures, which were heavily damaged in the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami and the nuclear accidents that followed it. Analog television stations are required to cease normal programming at noon and shut down their signals at midnight.

=== Malaysia ===

Digital television in Malaysia was first rolled out in January 2014. By June 2015, free digital television was provided by MYTV Broadcasting. In the first phase, there would be around 15 digital television stations nationwide with further stations will be added in the next phase. By November 2016, MYTV set top box also available for sale in electronics store nationwide. Malaysia government officiated the launching of digital television in the country on 6 June 2017 with an estimate of 4.2 million digital television decoders freely distributed to the country citizens, including recipients of the government aid of 1Malaysia People&#x27;s Aid (BR1M).

The government has planned for a full shutdown of analogue television broadcasting by September 2019 with a full introduction of digital television will be available to public by October. Langkawi become the first area of analogue television switch off that were executed on 21 July at 02:30 (UTC+8). Further on 6 August, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Ministry released a complete list of transition date on the remaining areas with central and southern West Malaysia to be commenced on 19 August, northern West Malaysia on 2 September, eastern coast West Malaysia on 17 September and entire East Malaysia on 30 September. The switch over in West Malaysia was fully completed on 16 October at 12:30am (UTC+8), while the final switch over in East Malaysia was completed on 31 October also at 12:30am (UTC+8) as scheduled.

=== Maldives ===

The Maldives has chosen the Japanese-Brazilian standard ISDB-Tb.

=== Philippines ===

On 11 June 2010, National Telecommunications Commission of the Philippines announced that the country will use the Japanese ISDB-T International standard. The first fully operational digital TV channel is Channel 49 of the religious group Iglesia ni Cristo.

However, in October 2012, DZCE-TV (which occupies the channel) reopened the analog signal to relaunch as INC TV; therefore, channel 49 can only transmit digitally during off-air hours of the analog channel 49.

This was followed by the state-owned television network PTV which conducted its test transmission on UHF Channel 48.

On 11 February 2015, the major TV network ABS-CBN commercially launched the digital TV box called ABS-CBN TV Plus also known as &quot;Mahiwagang Blackbox&quot;. Seven years before the commercial launch, the network initially applied for a license from NTC on digital free TV. The digital TV box was given away as a prize for the loyal viewers and listeners of ABS-CBN channel 2, DZMM (AM radio station of ABS-CBN) and DZMM TeleRadyo (TV-radio cable channel of ABS-CBN) after the initial application.

Digital television transition began on 28 February 2017, with ZOE Broadcasting Network&#x27;s DZOZ-TV as the country&#x27;s first station to permanently shut down analog terrestrial transmissions without any test simulcast with its digital signal, and is expected to be finished by 2023.

On 25 May 2018, Solar Entertainment Corp began a new digital TV service called Easy TV where most of its channels are offered to consumers through Easy TV&#x27;s proprietary set-top box.

In October 2020, with the 70th anniversary of GMA Network released their newest product, GMA Affordabox, a digital TV box to engage the audience to switch to digital television viewing while watching GMA and GMA News TV. Before the launch of the said TV box, the network released two new sub-channels, the Heart of Asia Channel (launched in June 2020 featuring GMA&#x27;s acquired Asian dramas and locally produced dramas) and Hallypop (which airs acquired programs from Jungo TV featuring Asian pop culture and international music events.)

On 10 September 2021, TV5 Network, Inc. formally launched its newest product, Sulit TV, a digital TV box to engage the audience to switch to digital television viewing while watching TV5 and One Sports and later RPTV.

=== Singapore ===

Singapore adopted the DVB-T2 standard in 2012, with monopoly Free-to-air broadcaster Mediacorp offering all seven of its services via DTT in 2013. Mediacorp ended analogue television service shortly after midnight on 2 January 2019.

=== Sri Lanka ===

Sri Lanka has chosen the Japanese-Brazilian standard ISDB-Tb.

=== Thailand ===

In 2005, the Ministry of Information announced its plan to digitalise nationwide free-to-air TV broadcasts led by MCOT Public Company Limited (MCOT). Trial broadcasts were undertaken, involving one thousand households in the Bangkok Metropolitan Area from December 2000 until May 2001. According to the then-Deputy Minister of Information, the trial received &quot;very positive&quot; feedback, i.e. &quot;more than 60 percent said the quality of the signal ranged from good to very good. Over 88 percent said the picture quality improved, while 70 percent said the sound quality was better.&quot;

According to Information Minister, Sontaya Kunplome, MCOT is expected to fully complete its digitalization in 2012 as part of its three-year restructuring process. Each household, once equipped with the necessary equipment (set-top box or iDTV set) is expected to receive up to 19 channels, seven of which fall under MCOT and the rest for private broadcasters such as TERO Entertainment (formerly BEC-TERO) which owns its channels such as Channel 3. Thus far, besides simulcasting Modernine TV and Television of Thailand, MCOT is test-airing MCOT 1, MCOT 2 and MCOT 3 exclusively on the digital TV platform, transmitted at UHF channel 44, modulated at 64QAM. MCOT was also expected to launch regional channels for each province and/or territory in Thailand, making it 80 MCOT television channels. BEC-TERO was expected to commence trials in March 2009.

Thailand and the rest of ASEAN countries (with the exception of the Philippines; see above) have selected DVB-T as the final DTV standard, and are expected to switch off analogue broadcasts completely by 2015. In June 2008, participants of the 6th ASEAN Digital Broadcast Meeting from seven south-east Asian countries (including Thailand) agreed to finalise the specifications of the DTV set-top box for use within ASEAN, and also set up an ASEAN HD Centre to provide training on HDTV content to broadcasters in the region.

Even though MCOT&#x27;s trial was a success, the future of the digital terrestrial television transition has become uncertain, especially after the end of Somchai Wongsawat&#x27;s tenure as the prime minister and the beginning of successor Abhisit Vejjajiva&#x27;s reign in favor of his concept.

In March 2011, MCOT announced that it is also possible that MCOT may be planning to switch to DVB-T2 some time in the future to replace DVB-T.

In 2018, five analogue channels had been off-air since June 16, 2018 (Thai PBS &amp; CH7HD), June 21 (TV5 HD) and July 16 (9MCOT HD &amp; NBT)

In 2020, the final analogue channel had been completed since 26 March 2020. (CH3 HD)

== Oceania ==
=== Australia ===

Australia uses DVB-T. The transition to digital television and the phaseout of analogue television was completed on 10 December 2013.

=== New Zealand ===

New Zealand uses DVB-T. The transition to digital television and the shutdown of analogue transmissions was completed on 1 December 2013

== Europe ==
=== European Union ===
As of 2001, two countries had introduced DTT: Sweden and Spain. Their total TV viewership market shares were 2.3%, and 3.5% respectively.

The EU recommended in May 2005 that its Member States cease all analogue television transmissions by 1 January 2012. Some EU member states decided to complete the transition as early as 2006 for Luxembourg and the Netherlands, and 2007 for Finland. Latvia stopped broadcasting analogue television from 1 June 2010. Poland completed the transition on 23 July 2013 and Bulgaria completed the transition on 30 September 2013. Malta switched on 1 November 2011. ASO was mostly completed in Europe in 2013 though small hilly underpopulated isolated terrain areas awaited DTT rollout beyond that date.

Many television viewers&#x27; equipment in Europe might experience interference and blocking because of 800 MHz broadband usage.

As of 2018, DTT is the main TV reception for 27.7 percent of the EU27 countries. Croatia, Greece, Italy, and Spain all have DTT penetration over 50 percent of total TV reception.

==== Bulgaria ====

Bulgaria launched a free-to-air platform in the Sofia region starting in November 2004. The standards chosen are DVB-T and MPEG4 AVC/H.264 compression format. DVB-T2 will not be used at this time. The Communications Regulatory Commission (CRC) has said that it received 6 bids for the licence to build and operate Bulgaria&#x27;s two nationwide DTT networks. A second licence tender for the operation of 3 DTT multiplexes was open until 27 May 2009. Following the closing of this process, Hannu Pro, part of Silicon Group, and with Baltic Operations has secured the license to operate three DTT multiplexes in Bulgaria by the country&#x27;s Communications Regulatory Commission (CRC) Bulgaria officially completed the transition to digital broadcasting on Monday, 30 September 2013.

==== Belgium ====

Flanders has no free-to-air television, as Dutch-language public broadcaster VRT shut off its DVB-T service on 1 December 2018 citing minimal usage. VRT cited that only 1 percent of Flemish households made use of the terrestrial signal and that it was not worth the €1 million to upgrade to DVB-T2. After some outcry over the loss of terrestrial coverage, VRT&#x27;s channels were added to TV Vlaanderen&#x27;s subscription DVB-T2 package called Antenne TV alongside all major Dutch-language commercial channels.

French-language public broadcaster RTBF remains available in Brussels and Wallonia via DVB-T transmissions.

95 percent of Belgium is covered by cable, well above the EU28 average of 45.1 percent, which can explain the low terrestrial usage in the country.

==== Denmark ====

DTT had its technical launch in Denmark in March 2006 after some years of public trials. The official launch was at midnight on 1 November 2009 when the analogue broadcasts shut down nationwide.

As of June 2020, five national multiplexes are available, broadcasting several channels in both SD and HD via DVB-T2, all using the MPEG-4 codec.

MUX 1 is Free-to-air and operated by I/S DIGI-TV, a joint-venture between DR and TV 2.

MUX 2, 3, 4, and 5 are operated by Boxer, and are for pay television only.

==== Finland ====

Finland launched DTT in 2001 and terminated analogue transmissions nationwide on 1 September 2007. Finland has successfully launched a mixture of pay and free-to-air DTT services. Digita operates the DTT and Mobile Terrestrial networks and rents capacity to broadcasters on its network on a neutral market basis. Digita is owned by TDF (France). The pay-DTT service provider Boxer has acquired a majority stake in the leading Finnish pay DTT operator PlusTV which offers several commercial channels for a subscription. It started in October 2006. Boxer already provides pay-DTT services in Sweden and Denmark.

Three nationwide multiplexes are granted to DNA and Anvia for DVB-T2 for high-definition and standard-definition channel (MPEG4).

==== France ====

France&#x27;s &quot;télévision numérique terrestre&quot; (TNT) offers 26 free national channels and 9 pay channels, plus up to 4 local free channels. An 89% DTT penetration rate is expected by December 2008. Free-to-view satellite services offering the same DTT offer were made available in June 2007.
Since 12 December 2012, TNT has delivered ten free HD channels (TF1 HD, France2 HD, M6 HD, Arte HD, HD1, L&#x27;Équipe 21, 6ter, Numéro 23, RMC Découverte HD, Chérie 25) and one pay TNT HD channel (Canal+ HD) using the MPEG4 AVC/H.264 compression format. French consumer technology magazine &quot;Les Numériques&quot; gave the picture quality of TNT&#x27;s previous 1440x1080i service a score of 8/10, compared to 10/10 for Blu-ray 1080p.

Typically:
* free TNT channels are broadcast 720×576 MPEG-2 with a VBR of 3.9 Mbits (2.1 to 6.8 as measured) or a CBR of 4.6 Mbits
* pay TNT channels are broadcast 720×576 MPEG4 AVC/H.264 with a VBR of 3.0 Mbits (1.1 to 6.0 as measured)
* free TNT-HD and pay TNT-HD are broadcast 1920×1080 (1080i50) MPEG4 AVC/H.264 with a VBR of 7.6 Mbits (3 to max 15M), but were previously broadcast at the lower definition of 1440×1080

For the audio part AC3 and AAC are used in 192 kbits for 2.0 and 384 kbits for 5.1.
Typically up to four audio part can be used:French 5.1VO (original language) 5.1French 2.0Audivision 5.1

Prime Minister François Fillon confirmed that the final analogue switch-off date would be 30 November 2011. DTT coverage had to reach 91% of a given &quot;&quot; before analogue transmissions could be switched off. CSA announced a call to tender for more local DTT licences on 15 June 2009 and 66 new DTT sites went up since May 2009 to expand coverage to cover low population areas.

Freesat began broadcasts from the Eutelsat Atlantic Bird 3 satellite from June 2009 as Fransat, providing for those unable to receive DTT signals for terrain reasons in preparation for ASO in 2011. Eighteen channels were broadcast initially and although free to watch, viewers needed to buy a set-top box with a smart card for €99 according to DVB.org article.

The end dates of analogue shutdown were: 2 February 2010: Alsace, 9 March 2010: Lower Normandy, 18 May 2010: Pays de la Loire, 8 June 2010: Bretagne, 28 September 2010: Lorraine and Champagne-Ardenne, 19 October 2010: Poitou-Charentes and the middle of the country, November 2010: Franche-Comté and Bourgogne, 7 December 2010: North of the country, First quarter 2011: Picardie and Haute-Normandie, Île-de-France, Aquitaine and Limousin, Auvergne, Côte d&#x27;Azur and Corsica, Rhône, Second quarter 2011 (before 30 November): Provence, Alpes, Midi-Pyrénées, Languedoc-Roussillon.

==== Germany ====

Germany launched a free-to-air platform region-by-region, starting in Berlin in November 2002. The analogue broadcasts were planned to cease soon after digital transmissions were started. Berlin became completely digital on 4 August 2003 with other regions completing between then and 2008. Digital switchover has been completed throughout Germany as of 2 December 2008 and services are now available to 100% of the population following the update of infill for the remaining 10% of transmitters by Media Broadcast who set up broadcast antennas at 79 transmission sites and installed 283 new transmitter stations. More services are to be launched on DTT and some pay DTT channels are or have been launched in various areas such as Stuttgart and soon Leipzig.

==== Hungary ====

Experimental DTT broadcast has started in December 2008. The program of Duna Televízió was broadcast during the trials. Originally analog television was planned to be shut down on 1 January 2012, but this deadline was first pushed out to 2014 and then brought forward to 2013. Analogue broadcast was terminated at 12:30pm, on 31 July 2013 in the central part of Hungary, and October 2013 in the rest of the country. M1, M2, Duna TV, Duna World, RTL Klub, TV2 and Euronews are available as free-view. M1, M2, and Duna TV are also available in HD.

On both of the 2013 shutoff dates, all analog channels ceased normal programming at 12:30pm and showed a silent ASO information screen that had a phone number to call for help. It was kept on for a few days, after which the analog transmitters were permanently shut down.

==== Ireland ====

In Ireland, DTT has been somewhat problematic. Responsibility for DTT, based on plans of Raidió Teilifís Éireann, was divided between two government Departments with differing views on its running. This delayed the project, took away its momentum and the economic situation deteriorated so that the opportunity to launch in good conditions was lost. When legislation finally arrived after two years to enable DTT to proceed, a private sector model was envisaged similar to the UK. A company trading as &quot;It&#x27;s TV&quot; was the sole applicant for a digital terrestrial television license under the provisions of the Irish Broadcasting Act 2001. The &quot;It&#x27;s TV&quot; proposed a triple play deployment with Broadband, TV, and Digital Radio services, but the on-air return channel (DVB-RCT system) for &quot;interactive&quot; use while tens of Mbps per mast, would per user only have been 300 to 2400bit/s at peak times, they never got approval to run an Internet service. RTÉ was to have a minority stake in its network and sell its majority share. However legislative delays and economic changes made it financially difficult for RTÉ to get a good price for the network stake. &quot;It&#x27;s TV&quot; plans raise the necessary funding failed due to the lack of approval for Internet aspect and infeasible Internet access model. Other DTT deployments in operation around that time also went bust, most particularly in the UK, Spain, and Portugal. &quot;It&#x27;s TV&quot; failed to get its license conditions varied or to get a time extension for securing funding. Its license was either never awarded (as they could not demonstrate a viable business plan &amp; funding) or was eventually withdrawn for non-performance.

Under subsequent legislation in May 2007, RTÉ, the spectrum regulator (ComReg) and the broadcasting regulator BCI (now BAI), were mandated to invite applications during 2008 under the Broadcasting (Amendment) Act 2007. RTÉ and the BCI received licenses from ComReg for spectrum to establish DTT. The BAI advertised and invited multiplex submissions by 2 May 2008. RTÉ Networks was required to broadcast in digital terrestrial TV (aerial TV) and received an automatic license through the RTÉ Authority. It expanded and upgraded its transmission network to digital terrestrial during 2009 which culminated in 98% coverage by 31 December 2011 with analog switchover beginning in Summer 2012 in concert with Northern Ireland, under the MOU signed with the UK and Irish Governments.

It also planned on making this network available to the commercial multiplex winner for rental of capacity once negotiations had concluded, rental agreed and a security bond received. It was testing the BAI multiplexes from November 2009 across the network, which is publicly receivable with the correct DTT receivers. 1 Mux (a group of broadcast channels) would have provided the services of the public service broadcaster and have had 98% population coverage by 31 December 2011. The other three multiplexes would have had between 90% and 92% population coverage. Following Analogue Switchover one additional PSB mux and one or more commercial muxes was made available for DTT, mobile television, broadband, and other services.

The BCI (now BAI) received three conditional applications to operate the three muxes which were presented to the public on 12 May 2008. It decided in principle to allocate the license to Boxer DTT Ltd, a consortium made up of the Swedish pay-DTT operator Boxer and the media group Communicorp at its board meeting on 21 July 2008.

On 20 April 2009, the BCI revealed that Boxer had withdrawn their license, and it was instead given to the runner-up applicant OneVision. At the end of April 2010 the negotiations with Onevision ended and they also decided to return the license. On 29 April 2010, the contract was offered to the only remaining applicant, Easy TV. The Easy TV consortium informed the BAI on 12 May 2010 that it was declining their offer to pursue negotiations regarding the Commercial DTT Multiplex Licence.

A Houses of the Oireachtas Channel (reportedly shelved in December 2008) and the Irish Film Channel (whose status is unclear though a company was formed to provide the channel) were enabled for establishment as public service broadcasters on Irish DTT.

The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland replaced the Broadcasting Complaints Commission, the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, and the RTÉ Authority. The BAI includes Awards and Advisory Committees under statutory instrument 389 that gave effect to the provisions of the Broadcasting Act 2009. This legislation dissolved the BCI, vesting it and new responsibilities, assets, and liabilities in a new Broadcasting Authority of Ireland on 1 October 2009. This Act also dealt with analogue switchover.

A DTT Information Campaign was announced by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, to launch in March 2009 ahead of the September 2009 launch of Irish DTT. The Information Campaign was undertaken by the BAI, with the support of the department.

On 30 October 2010, FTA DTT, which is known as Saorview, was launched following a direction from the Minister for Communications, Energy &amp; Natural Resources, to RTÉ and the signing of the &quot;RTÉ (National Television Multiplex) Order 2010 (S.I. No. 85 of 2010)&quot; on 26 February 2010. The rollout of FTA Saorview DTT then proceeded, and a commercial DTT competition was deferred.

On 1 July 2010, RTÉ announced that Mary Curtis, RTÉ&#x27;s deputy head of TV programming, would take on the role of Director of Digital Switchover (DSO).

In May 2011, RTÉ launched Saorview, which was officially opened by Minister Rabbitte.

On 14 October 2011, Minister Rabbitte announced that analogue terrestrial television broadcast would be switched off on 24 October 2012. This date was chosen in consultation with the UK on its Northern Ireland analogue switchover date so that both jurisdictions on the island would switch over at roughly the same time. This was done to make it straightforward for citizens on both sides of the border, referring citizens to both Saorview&#x27;s website and the Department&#x27;s Digital Switchover Website.

On 24 October 2012, all analogue television transmission in Ireland ended, leaving Saorview as the primary source of broadcast television in Ireland.

==== Italy ====

The switch-off of the analogue terrestrial network progressed region–by–region. It started on Wednesday 15 October 2008, and was completed on Wednesday 4 July 2012.
The selected broadcasting standard is DVB-T with MPEG2 video for SD and H.264 video for HD, audio is usually MPEG1. The whole frequency spectrum has been allocated with SFN in mind.
Along the original analog free to air channels that switched to digital, a few new pay per view platforms came around with the advent of DTT.
Worth mentioning is the addition of an experimental free to air HD 1080i channel from RAI which is set to broadcast important sport events like the Olympic Games or the FIFA World Cup.

==== Luxembourg ====

Luxembourg launched DTT services in April 2006. The national service launched in June 2006. On 1 September 2006, Luxembourg became the first European country to transition completely to DTT. Luxe TV, a niche theme based station, soon began broadcasting on the Luxembourg DTT platform, transmitted from the Dudelange transmitter. The aim was to reach audiences in some parts of Germany as well as in Luxembourg.

==== Netherlands ====

The Netherlands launched its DTT service 23 April 2003, and terminated analogue transmissions nationwide on 11 December 2006. KPN owns Digitenne which provides a mix of FTA public channels and paid DTT services. KPN started to switch its digital terrestrial television platform Digitenne to the DVB-T2 HEVC standard in October 2018, this transition completed on 9 July 2019.

==== Poland ====

DTT launch in Poland was scheduled for Autumn 2009. Regulatory disagreements delayed its tender and approach until resolved and the multiplexes available for DTT were reduced to 3 and the 2nd was licensed in the Autumn of 2009. The reduction from 5 to 3 enabled mobile TV and broadband to get more spectrum allocation. Muxes 2 and 3 therefore had limited coverage until ASO. Polsat, TVN, TV4, and TV Puls have officially applied to reserve space on the country&#x27;s first multiplex set to start in September. Wirtualne Media is given as the source of the story. The public broadcaster&#x27;s three main channels TVP1, TVP2, and TVP Info had already been allocated capacity on the multiplex.

Poland ended its television broadcast in analogue on 23 July 2013. A mobile TV license has also been awarded in Poland to Info TV FM to use DVB-H standard.

==== Portugal ====

Portugal launched its DTT service on 29 April 2009, available to around 20% of the Portuguese population and Portugal Telecom expected to reach 80% of the population by the end of 2009. Airplus TV Portugal which was set up to compete for a licence to manage Portugal&#x27;s pay-TV DTT multiplexes, dissolved as it did not get the license and a Portuguese court ruled not to suspend the process for the awarding of a licence to Portugal Telecom, based on a complaint submitted by Airplus TV Portugal. After Airplus TV Portugal was dissolved, Portugal Telecom informed that will not honour the pay-TV DTT multiplexes licence obligations. ANACOM, the Portuguese communications authority, accepted. Portugal thus has only one active multiplexer.

==== Romania ====

In Romania, broadcasting regulations have been amended so that DTT service providers have only a single licence rather than the two previously required by the National Audiovisual Council (CNA). DTT services were launched in December 2009 using the MPEG-4 (H.264 AVC) compression format following the Ministry of Communications publication of a strategic plan for the transition to digital broadcasting. According to Media Express, it envisaged a maximum of five national UHF multiplexes, a national VHF multiplex and a multiplex allocated to regional and local services, all in accordance with the ITU Geneva Conference RRC-06 reports BroadbandTVNews.

The Ministry of Communications (MCSI) estimated that 49% of Romania&#x27;s 7.5 million households got TV from cable and 27% from DTH services in Romania while terrestrial TV was used by 18% of the TV households. 6% are reported as not able to receive TV transmissions. Subsidies were offered for those below a certain income to assist switchover for them. Switchover was scheduled for January 2012.

Romkatel, the local representative of Kathrein, has since been awarded the commercial Romanian DTT services license. ZF reported that Romkatel has signed a 12-month contract worth €710,420, having beaten off a challenge from France&#x27;s TDF. The tender was organised by Romania&#x27;s National Society for Radiocommunications (SNR).
Meanwhile, the National Audiovisual Council, in charge of the public service broadcasting sector has awarded digital licences to the public channels TVR1 and TVR2.

According to Media Express, this followed a short debate at the National Audiovisual Council (CNA) about whether to also award licences to the nine remaining public channels, one of which transmits in HD and five are regional.

The National Authority in Communications (ANCOM), will most probably award the transmission network contract for this to the national transmission company Radiocommunicatii.

In June 2013, the Romanian Government issued a Strategy to shift from analogue terrestrial to digital terrestrial that pushes ahead the until the date stopped the process. According to the Strategy one of the five planned digital terrestrial multiplexes will be de facto granted to Radiocom, the state company involved in terrestrial carrying the public television signals, way before a selection for the muxes operators will be organized by ANCOM, selection with the deadline of 17 June 2015. The government is describing the Radiocom multiplex with the terms &quot;pilot project&quot; and &quot;experiment&quot;. The minimum technical requirements for this project are: broadcast standard DVB-T2, ensuring the coverage of up to 40% of the population until 1 July 2014, and 70% of the population up to 17 June 2015, and the possibility of using the broadcasting premises that belongs to Radiocom.

On 17 June 2015, Romania shut down analog broadcasting and started broadcasting with DVB-T2 technology, but with very low coverage, and a very reduced number of broadcasts available. Because of low coverage, Romania stopped broadcasting TVR 1 in analog format on VHF on 31 December 2015. However, since the analog shut down, many people who were receiving TV on terrestrial changed to a cable or DTH provider. On 31 December 2016, Romania has successfully switched to DVB-T2. After 2016, the channels received on DVB-T2 continued getting lower and lower after people switched to cable or satellite since DVB-T was delayed a lot of times before. Kanal D left terrestrial platform on 2 July 2015, and Antena 3 as well. Only Antena 1 was the only Antena Group channel to be available on terrestrial but only until around 2010. However, people still use terrestrial TV for foreign channels. Although many TV sellers are marking their TV as being compatible with digital terrestrial television in Romania, by highlighting this feature with a sticker on the TV, buyers are mainly interested if the TV has DVB-C or DVB-C, however, TV sets without DVB-T2 continue to be sold with only DVB-T/C and sometimes S2, as cable and satellite compatibility presents most of the interest.

As of 2022, only TVR channels still broadcast in DVB-T, as every other channel in Romania has switched to DVB-C or DVB-S.

==== Spain ====

In Spain most multiplexes closed after the failure of Quiero TV, the country&#x27;s original pay DTT platform. DTT was relaunched on 30 November 2005, with 20 free-to-air national TV services as well as numerous regional and local services. Nearly 11 million DTT receivers had been sold as of July 2008. Positive approval for pay DTT services have reportedly been given by Spain&#x27;s Ministry of Industry in a surprise move on 17 June of the Advisory Council on Telecommunications and the Information Society (Catsi). IT will now be included in a Royal Decree. A number of leading Spanish media players including Sogecable, Telefónica, Ono, Orange and Vodafone have apparently criticised that as according to Prisa, Sogecable&#x27;s owner, &quot;it caps a series of policy changes that benefits only a few audiovisual operators, those of terrestrial TV, to the detriment of satellite operators, cable and DSL.&quot; There may be appeals lodged against the government&#x27;s decision.

==== Sweden ====

In Sweden, DTT was launched in 1999 solely as a paid service. As of 2007, there are 38 channels in 5 MUXs. 11 of those are free-to-air channels from a number of different broadcasters. Switch-off of the analogue TV service started on 19 September 2005 and finished on 29 October 2007. Boxer began the deployment of MPEG-4 receivers to new subscribers. Over the next six years from 2008, Sweden will gradually migrate from MPEG-2 visual coding to using MPEG-4, H.264.
The Swedish Radio and TV Authority (RTVV) recently announced eight new national channels that will broadcast in the MPEG-4 format.
From 1 April 2008, Boxer is also responsible for approving devices to use on the network, will no longer accept MPEG-2 receivers for test and approval. Set Top Boxes must be backward compatible so that they can decode both MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 coded transmissions.

==== Switzerland ====

Switzerland introduced DTT in 2007. Switzerland later become the first country to eliminate broadcast terrestrial television entirely when public broadcaster SRG SSR, which runs the country&#x27;s only terrestrial channels, shut down its DVB-T transmitter network in June 2019. SRG SSR estimated that less than two percent of households relied on its DVB-T network, the large majority of which used it only for reception on secondary devices, making continued operation not economically viable. Its programing will remain on IPTV services, cable, and free-to-air satellite. SRG SSR recommended consumers to switch to satellite. As the satellite signals are free but encrypted to restrict reception to Swiss residents, there is now one privately owned DVB-T transmitter on Hoher Kasten in Appenzell to feed the channels of SRF to cable systems in Vorarlberg, Austria.

=== North Macedonia ===

DTT was successfully launched in November 2009. It uses MPEG-2 for 4K UHD and MPEG-4 for HD. The service was launched by ONE, and the platform is called BoomTV. It offers 42 channels including all national networks and it is available to 95% of the population.

=== Russia ===

In Russia, digital television appeared in the summer of 2009. The first multiplex consisted of the following channels: &quot;Channel One Russia&quot;, &quot;Russia-1&quot;, &quot;Russia-2&quot; (now &quot;Match-TV&quot;), &quot;NTV&quot;, &quot;Petersburg 5th channel&quot;, &quot;Russia-Culture&quot;, &quot;Russia-24&quot;, &quot;Bibigon&quot; (later - &quot;Carousel&quot;). In the spring of 2013, two more channels were added to the first multiplex: &quot;OTR&quot; and &quot;TV-Center&quot;.

On 19 March 2012, DVB-T was replaced in favor of DVB-T2.

On 14 December 2012, a second DTV multiplex begun airing. REN TV, TV Center (from 2013 - Spas), STS, Domashniy, Sport (from 2013 - TV-3), NTV Plus Sport Plus (from 2015 onwards - Pyatnica!), Zvezda, Mir, TNT and Muz-TV were in that multiplex.

In 2014, the third and fourth multiplex appeared in the Crimea. They were created after the annexation of Crimea into Russia.

On 15 January 2015, a third multiplex went live in Moscow and the Moscow region, broadcasting some satellite-only channels (for example, on 22 channel 2х2 at 12am and in the 11:59am, My planet (Moya Planeta) in the noon-6pm, and in the 6pm-12am - Science 2.0 (Nauka 2.0).

On 30 November 2018, the Ministry of digital development, communications and mass communications of the Russian Federation proposed turning off analog broadcasting in four stages (on 11 February, 15 April, 3 June and 14 October).

On 3 December 2018, the first region completed its switch from analogue broadcasting to digital broadcasting.

On 14 October 2019, Russia has entirely switched from analog television to digital television. Some channels are still being aired as analog TV. (Namely, &quot;Che&quot;)

On 22 October 2020, aired channel list on the second multiplex was changed. Channels aired in the multiplex now are &quot;Che&quot;, &quot;STS Love&quot;, &quot;STS Kids&quot;, &quot;TNT4&quot;, &quot;TNT Music&quot;, &quot;2x2&quot;, &quot;Super&quot;, &quot;U&quot;, &quot;Channel Disney&quot;, and &quot;Match Strana&quot;.

=== Turkey ===

DTT was trialed in Turkey in 2006 using DVB-T, but the public rollout did not occur, only the analogue transmission was switched off in favour of HD satellite broadcast. In 2011 preparations were made for the introduction of DTT, with channel licenses later allocated. However, in 2014 the allocations were voided by the Supreme Court citing irregularities in awarding the licenses. The uncertainty led to reluctance of broadcasters to invest in a DTT network, particularly with satellite TV having a dominant penetration. The DTT project was revived in 2016 with the construction of a multi-purpose 100 m transmitter in Çanakkale DVB-T2 test broadcasts commenced with the opening of Çamlıca Tower. Broadcasting license only given to state owned TRT in Marmara region.

=== United Kingdom ===

The United Kingdom (1998), Sweden (1999), and Spain (2000) were the first to launch DTT with platforms heavily reliant on pay television. All platforms experienced many starter problems, in particular the British and Spanish platforms which failed financially (mainly due to their encryption being compromised). Nevertheless, Boxer, the Swedish pay platform which started in October 1999, proved to be very successful.

DTT in the United Kingdom was launched in November 1998 as a primarily subscription service branded as ONdigital, a joint venture between Granada Television and Carlton Communications, with only a few channels being available free to air. ONdigital soon ran into financial difficulties with subscriber numbers below expectations, and in order to attempt to reverse their fortunes, it was decided that the ITV and ONdigital brands should align, and the service was rebranded ITV Digital in 2001. Despite an expensive advertising campaign, ITV Digital struggled to attract sufficient new subscribers and in 2002 closed the service. After commercial failure of the Pay TV proposition it was relaunched as the free-to-air Freeview platform in 2002. Top Up TV, a &quot;lite&quot; pay DTT service, became available in 2004 when Inview launched the first DTT (Freeview) EPG service.

On 30 March 2005, the older analogue signals began to be phased out on a region-by-region basis (a process known as the Digital switchover, or DSO), beginning with a technical trial at the Ferryside television relay station. The first full transmitter to switch to digital-only transmission was the Whitehaven transmitter in Cumbria, which completed its transition on Wednesday 17 October 2007. The switchover to digital-only broadcasting was completed on 24 October 2012 when the transmitters in Northern Ireland turned off their analogue broadcasts (which coincided with the transition in the Republic of Ireland).

The additional transmission frequencies freed up by the shutdown of analogue signals have (among other things, such as the introduction of 4G mobile internet) allowed for the creation of a single DVB-T2 multiplex used to carry high-definition programming. There are also plans to use one frequency to launch local television services.

== North America ==
=== Bahamas ===

On 14 December 2011, national public broadcaster ZNS-TV announced it would be upgrading to ATSC digital television with mobile DTV capabilities, in line with its neighbours, the United States and Puerto Rico.

=== Bermuda ===

Bermuda has plans to convert its three broadcast stations to ATSC digital terrestrial television in the future.

=== Canada ===

In Canada, analogue switch-off was mandated by regulatory authorities for all provincial capital cities and all multi-station markets. Analogue would continue in single-station markets and remote areas. With an exception, analogue switch-off in the mandated areas took place on 31 August 2011. The CBC was granted an exception in many smaller multi-station markets, due to the cost of conversion, otherwise the CBC services would have gone dark in many such markets. Most network stations are already broadcasting high-definition digital signals in Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Regina, and Vancouver. Most networks had been concerned about the August 2011 deadline as not all parts of the country were equipped to receive DTTV by the scheduled date.

=== Mexico ===

In Mexico, the digital transition is completed. Digital signals are available in all cities, thus providing national coverage. Analog transmission were turned off based on population size. Tijuana was the first city to turn off analog signals and the nationwide turn-off was completed on 31 December 2015. On 27 October 2016, Mexico relocated all of its channels. This made Azteca 13 (now Azteca Uno) on virtual channel 1.1 nationwide, Canal de Las Estrellas (now Las Estrellas) on virtual channel 2.1 and Imagen Television on virtual channel 3.1. Border cities were not affected due signal issues across the United States. For example, in the Tijuana-San Diego area, channel 2.1&#x27;s signal comes from KCBS-TV, a CBS owned-and-operated station in Los Angeles, and can affect television users in portions of San Diego County. Thus, Las Estrellas is on virtual channel 19.1.

=== United States ===

In the United States on 12 June 2009, all full-power U.S. television broadcasts became exclusively digital, under the Digital Television and Public Safety Act of 2005. Furthermore, since 1 March 2007, new television sets that receive signals over the air, including pocket-sized portable televisions, must include ATSC digital tuners for digital broadcasts. Prior to 12 June 2009, most U.S. broadcasters were transmitting in both analog and digital formats; a few were digital only. Most U.S. stations were not permitted to shut down their analog transmissions prior to 16 February 2009 unless doing so was required in order to complete work on a station&#x27;s permanent digital facilities. In 2009, the FCC finished auctioning channels 52–59 (the lower half of the 700 MHz band) for other communications services, completing the reallocation of broadcast channels 52–69 that began in the late 1990s.

The analog switch-off rendered all non-digital television sets unable to receive most over-the-air television channels without an external converter box; however, low-power television stations and cable TV systems were not required to convert to digital until 1 September 2015. Beginning 1 January 2008, consumers could request coupons to help cover most of the cost of these converters by calling a toll-free number or via a website. Some television stations had also been licensed to operate &quot;nightlights&quot;, analog signals which consisted only of a brief repeated announcement advising remaining analog viewers how to switch to digital reception.

=== Brazil ===

In Brazil, the government chose a modified version of the Japanese ISDB-T standard, called ISDB-Tb (or SBTVD) in June 2006. Digital broadcasts started on 2 December 2007 in São Paulo and now it is under expansion all over the country. As of 15 September 2009, metro areas of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, Brasília, Goiânia, Curitiba, Porto Alegre, Salvador, Campinas, Vitória, Florianópolis, Uberlândia, São José do Rio Preto, Teresina, Santos, Campo Grande, Fortaleza, Recife, João Pessoa, Sorocaba, Manaus, Belém, Aracaju, Ribeirão Preto, Boa Vista, Macapá, Porto Velho, Rio Branco, São Carlos, São José do Rio Preto, São Luís, Pirassununga, São José dos Campos, Taubaté, Ituiutaba, Araraquara, Feira de Santana, Itapetininga, Sorocaba, Presidente Prudente, Bauru, Campos dos Goytacazes, Londrina, Juiz de Fora, Campina Grande, Caxias do Sul, Franca, Rio Claro and Cuiabá have digital terrestrial broadcasting. By 2013 the digital signal was available in the whole country. Analogue shutdown is scheduled for 2023.

=== Chile ===

On 14 September 2009, President Michelle Bachelet announced that the government had finally decided on a digital television standard. Chile adopted the ISDB-T Japanese standard (with the custom modifications made by Brazil). Simulcasting began in 2010, with a projected analog switch-off in 2017.

=== Colombia ===

Colombia has chosen the European DVB-T standard on 28 August 2008. However, in 2012, Colombia adopted DVB-T2 as the national standard for terrestrial television, replacing DVB-T, the previously selected standard for digital TV.

On 28 December 2010, private networks Caracol TV and RCN TV officially started digital broadcasts for Bogotá, Medellín and surrounding areas on channels 14 and 15 UHF, respectively. State-run Señal Colombia and Canal Institucional had started test digital broadcasts earlier in 2010.

The current coverage of DVB-T2 can be consulted on the website of the organization &quot;Tdt para Todos&quot; which is the entity responsible for facilitating its adoption.

=== Ecuador ===

Ecuador chose Japanese-Brazilian standard ISDB-T as 6th country on 26 March 2010.

=== Paraguay ===

Paraguay chose Japanese-Brazilian standard ISDB-T on 1 June 2010.

=== Peru ===

On 23 April 2009, Peru chose the Brazilian variant of the Japanese digital television standard ISDB-T. The Peruvian government signed an agreement with its Japanese counterpart in order for the latter to fund the implementation of the DTT platform in the country. The first network to be launched on digital terrestrial television was TV Perú on 30 March 2010, using the ISDB-Tb standard. Currently, all the major stations in Lima are broadcasting on DTT in high-definition. ATV was the first television channel in the country to do digital test broadcasts on 19 June 2007 using either ATSC, DVB-T and ISDB-T in order to see which of them was better. Eventually, ATV chose ISDB-Tb and officially started broadcasting in HD; its first live TV show to be aired in high-definition was Magaly TV on 30 August 2010. Frecuencia Latina also began broadcasting on DTT on 14 September 2010 with a match of the Peru women&#x27;s national volleyball team in the 2010 FIVB Women&#x27;s Volleyball World Championship. Shortly after these events, América Televisión started broadcasting on DTT.

=== Suriname ===

Suriname is currently transitioning from analogue NTSC broadcasts to digital ATSC and DVB-T broadcasts. Channel ATV started with ATSC broadcasts in the Paramaribo area in June 2014, which was followed by ATSC broadcasts from stations in Brokopondo, Wageningen and Albina. The stations in Brokopondo, Wageningen and Albina broadcast both the channels of ATV (i.e. ATV and TV2) and STVS, while the station in Paramaribo currently only broadcasts the ATV channels. The Telecommunication Authority of Suriname was originally aiming at a full digital transition by June 2015, but this was criticized by broadcasters as being unfeasible. However, the ITU has documented both DVB-T and ATSC are in use.

=== Uruguay ===

Uruguay chose the European DVB-T standard in August 2007, however disproved it and decided to adopt ISDB-T on 27 December 2010 to follow neighbouring countries.

=== Venezuela ===

In Venezuela, tests are being performed with full deployment to start 2008–2009. DTT will coexist with analogue standard television for some time until full deployment of the system on a nationwide level is accomplished. 30 September 2009, decided to employ Japanese ISDB-T system under cooperation with Japan, and officially be agreed with Japan in early October 2009.

On 6 October 2009, Venezuela officially adopted ISDB-T with Brazilian modifications. Transition from analog to digital is expected to take place in the next 10 years.

In March 2012, Venezuela signed a $50M agreement to purchase 300,000 decoders from Argentina to implement TDT in Caracas and later this year in some of the most important cities, but only in the Government-controlled TV Stations. NTSC and TDT will coexist. The Government hopes to reach TDT the whole country&#x27;s population in 2 years.

As of 2019, due to the Venezuelan crisis, the digital television transition is paralysed and DTT development has been frozen.

== Africa ==
The majority of countries in Africa have adopted the DVB-T2 standard, including Algeria, Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

=== Angola ===

Angola has chosen the Japanese-Brazilian standard ISDB-Tb.

=== Botswana ===

Botswana has chosen the Japanese-Brazilian standard ISDB-Tb.

=== Nigeria ===

In March 2015, Inview Technology (a UK digital switch-off company based in Cheshire and with local operations in Nigeria) was appointed by Nigeria&#x27;s government-run National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to enable digital switchover from analogue throughout the country and provide a Conditional Access System, set-top box software and services including full EPG, Push Video-On-Demand, a range of broadcasting applications such as news, public service information and audience measurement services over the digital terrestrial and satellite networks in Nigeria.

Inview Nigeria and NCB will:

# create a free digital TV service called FreeTV (based on Freeview in the UK), rather than pay TV subscriptions
# subsidise the FreeTV STB down to an affordable retail price of N1500 ($7.50)
# fund subsidies and digital infrastructure costs through the sale of spectrum and the introduction of a BBC style licence fee (called &#x27;digital access fee&#x27;) of N1000 ($5) pa which is payable on all digital STBs including pay TV operators. The Nigerian Government will receive a digital dividend of c.$1 billion from the sale of spectrum, ensuring that the whole DSO programme is self-funding

FreeTV will carry up to 30 free channels: the best of Nigeria TV and international channels across news, movies, kids, music and general entertainment &quot;genres&quot;.

A national standard set-top box specification has been set which incorporates a common operating system created by Inview. All boxes will require this specification to view the channels and access value-added services such as interactive news, programme recording, internet applications, and video on demand.

As of March 2016, FreeTV is being operated by Inview and is an open platform that enables any content or pay TV provider to broadcast their content so that Nigerian consumers only have to buy one box to view all the content. Only manufacturers licensed in Nigeria will receive the Inview operating system required to access the channels and services, which will protect domestic manufacturers and consumers from illegal grey imports.

=== South Africa ===

On 14 January 2011, the South African Department of Communications and Digital Technologies chose the European standard DVB-T2 as the digital television standard in South Africa, following the trend in this direction of several African nations.

Department of Communication has decided to switch off analogue to digital migration date on 31 July 2023 by Sentech Tower migration to Go Digital Terrestrial Television to migration to digital already started with SABC channels on other province of South Africa.

MultiChoice and M-Net and community service network (CSN) launching GOtv South Africa Terrestrial as pay TV service analogue subscribers on 5 September 2011.

Platco Digital OpenView HD and eMedia Investments groups launch it first free to air satellite decoder on onces off fee to purchase Set-top box on 15 October 2013 and channels e.tv and SABC of terrestrial channel to direct-to-home (DTH) Satellite openview HD.
Along with (DTT) Terrestrial migration go digital decoder on 1 October 2015. Qualifying households should visit their local post office as soon as possible to apply for a free government-subsidised decoder among the poor population in South Africa.

The two-step approach puts forward 31 July 2023 as the date for switching off all analogue broadcasting services above 694 MHz, with 31 December 2024 as the end of the dual-illumination period and the switch-off of the remaining analogue services below 694 MHz.

There are 9 provinces in south africa, switch-off is Free State, Limpopo, Mpumalanga, Northern Cape, North West and the delay is crucial for households in Gauteng, the Western Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, and the Eastern Cape, which together represent more than half of South Africa’s population. If these areas lose their analogue TV signals, residents may find themselves cut off from essential news and information until 31 March 2025 Deadline.

=== Tunisia ===

To follow the transition from analog to digital in the field of terrestrial television broadcasting, and to keep pace with these technological international innovations, Tunisia through the Office of National Broadcasting has planned the following phases to digitize its terrestrial broadcasting networks:

==== First phase ====
Deployment, since 2001, of an experimental digital TV broadcasting unit using DVB-T system, and MPEG-2 compression, implemented in Boukornine site, to insure the coverage of Great Tunis (25% of population). This experimental project highlighted the benefits of digitization which are : -Better quality of Video and audio signals, -Increasing the capacity of distribution networks through the transmission of a digital TV package (bouquet): a layer of digital distribution network enables the transmission of 4 to 6 programs TV instead of a single TV program in the case of an analog network -The economics of radio spectrum and the energy consumption. -Introduction of new multimedia services. In the preparatory phase, ONT has prepared the frequency plan for digital terrestrial TV networks of and has signed the final acts of the Regional Radio Communication Conference 2006 in Geneva organized by the International Telecommunication Union, which recommends to switch off analog broadcasting services around 2015 and their replacement by digital broadcasting systems.

==== Second phase ====
This phase includes the completion of the two following projects:

1- First part: Digitization of the transmission network between production studios and different broadcasting stations. The network consists of 41 transmission stations spread throughout the country. This step represents the first part of the Digital Terrestrial TV network, and its deployment is completed during the period 2008–2009. The cost of this project is 27 million dinars TTC.

2- Second part: National digital terrestrial TV broadcasting Network to viewers, which consists of 17 DTTV stations spread throughout the country and will be conducted under a contract including a vendor financing agreement with the Thomson Grass Valley (France) company. The project came into force in August 2009 and will be conducted during 2009–2010. Its cost is 13 million dinars TTC.

== Analogue to digital transition by countries ==

The broadcasting of digital terrestrial transmissions has led to many countries planning to phase out existing analogue broadcasts. This table shows the launches of DTT and the closing down of analogue television in several countries.
* Official launch: The official launch date of digital terrestrial television in the country, not the start for trial broadcasts.
* Start of closedown: The date for the first major closedown of analogue transmitters.
* End of closedown: The date when analogue television is definitely closed down.
* System: Transmission system, e. g. DVB-T, ATSC or ISDB-T.
* Interactive: System used for interactive services, such as MHP and MHEG-5.
* Compression: Video compression standard used. Most systems use MPEG-2, but the more efficient H.264/MPEG-4 AVC has become increasingly popular among networks launching later on. Some countries use both MPEG-2 and H.264, for example France which uses MPEG-2 for standard definition free content but MPEG-4 for HD broadcasts and pay services.

<text>The flag of Wyoming was officially adopted to represent the U.S. state of Wyoming on January 31, 1917. The flag consists of the silhouette of an American bison, a symbol of fidelity, justice and virility. The bison also represents the local fauna; the intricate state seal on it is not of such bold design. The red symbolizes both the Native Americans and the blood of pioneers who gave their lives. Thoroughout white is a symbol of purity and uprightness; the blue is the color of the skies and distant mountains. 

==History==

In 1916 the Wyoming Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) ran a contest inviting the public to submit possible designs for a Wyoming flag. A prize of $20 () was offered to the winner, and the DAR received a total of 37 entries. They chose a drawing by Verna Keays, a recent graduate of the Art Institute of Chicago. On January 31, 1917, Governor Robert D. Carey signed the state flag bill into law and the bison flag was officially adopted.

DAR regent Grace Raymond Hebard, a professor at the University of Wyoming, suffragist and scholar, contributed suggestions for changes after the design had been accepted. In Keays&#x27; original design, the one approved by Wyoming&#x27;s legislature, the bison faces toward the fly, symbolizing its former freedom to roam the plains of Wyoming. Hebard thought that if the bison were to face toward the hoist, the design would be more balanced (animals generally face the hoist on flags, as they would the wind). In the end, all Wyoming flags from the first batch produced onward showed the bison facing the hoist, although this change was never officially adopted by the Wyoming legislature.

It is one of nine U.S. state flags to feature an eagle, alongside those of Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, New York, North Dakota, Oregon and Pennsylvania.

<doc id="497308" wikidata="Q2944394" url="?curid=497308" title="Central Bedeque">
<text>Central Bedeque is a former municipality that previously held community status in the Canadian province of Prince Edward Island. It was dissolved through its amalgamation with the Community of Bedeque on November 17, 2014, to create the Community of Bedeque and Area. It is located north of Borden-Carleton within Lot 26, Prince County. Its primary industry is agriculture.

==History==
The name, Central Bedeque, was first adopted in 1925, and was confirmed in 1944. It was established as a village in 1966. Its former names were the Strong&#x27;s Corner, and the Weatherbie&#x27;s Corner until the name was changed to Central Bedeque when it was incorporated.
==Geography==
Central Bedeque is located northwest of Borden-Carleton in the central part of the province on the south shore (fronting the Northumberland Strait), and is on the Dunk River.

Central Bedeque traces its name to neighbouring Bedeque (which it also shares with neighbouring North Bedeque and Lower Bedeque). The name &quot;Bedeque&quot; may be a corruption of a term used by the Mi&#x27;kmaq Nation with several meanings such as &quot;sunny camping place&quot; or &quot;the hot place&quot;.

<text>Cayenne (; ; ) is the prefecture of French Guiana, an overseas region and department of France located in South America and its capital city. The city stands on a former island at the mouth of the Cayenne River on the Atlantic coast. The city&#x27;s motto is &quot;fert aurum industria&quot;, which means &quot;work brings wealth&quot;. Cayenne is the largest Francophone city of the South American continent.

In the 2021 census, there were 151,103 inhabitants in the metropolitan area of Cayenne (as defined by INSEE), 63,468 of whom lived in the city (commune) of Cayenne proper.

==History==

Ignored by Spanish explorers who found the region too hot and poor to be claimed, the region was not colonized until 1604, when the French founded a settlement. However, it was soon destroyed by the Portuguese, determined to enforce the Treaty of Tordesillas. French colonists returned in 1643 and founded Cayenne, but were forced to leave once more following the Amerindian attacks. In 1664, France finally established a permanent settlement at Cayenne. Over the next decade the colony changed hands between the French, Dutch, and English, before being restored to France. It was captured by an Anglo-Portuguese force in 1809 and administered from Brazil until 1814, when it was returned to French control. It was used as a French penal colony from 1854 to 1938.

The city&#x27;s population has grown dramatically over time, owing to high levels of immigration (chiefly from the West Indies and Brazil) as well as a high birth rate.

==Geography==

Cayenne is located on the estuary of the Cayenne River on the Atlantic Ocean. The city occupies part of Cayenne Island. It is from Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni and from Kourou.

==Administration==
Cayenne is a commune of the French Republic and as such, administered by a mayor and a municipal council. The current mayor is Sandra Trochimara, who was 1st deputy mayor under the former mayor Marie-Laure Phinéra-Horth, and succeeded her as mayor of Cayenne in October 2020 after Phinéra-Horth won the local Senate race the month before (under French law, members of the French Senate cannot exercise the mandate of mayor). Marie-Laure Phinéra-Horth, a former member of the Guianese Socialist Party, daughter of a former president of the General Council of French Guiana, Stéphan Phinéra-Horth, from the Guianese Socialist Party, who governed the department of French Guiana from 1994 to 1998, was supported by various left-wing parties and had been mayor of Cayenne since 2010.

As in the rest of France, the small size of the commune of Cayenne does not cover the entire urban area of Cayenne. This has led to the creation of an intercommunal authority which groups Cayenne and five suburban communes: the communauté d&#x27;agglomération du Centre Littoral. The current president of the intercommunal authority of Centre Littoral since November 2020 has been Serge Smock, mayor of Matoury, who ran on a centrist platform affiliated with Emmanuel Macron&#x27;s LREM party and defeated Sandra Trochimara, successor of Marie-Laure Phinéra-Horth as mayor of Cayenne, who was also trying to succeed her as president of the intercommunal authority with the support of an array of Left-wing parties. It is the first time since 2001 that the intercommunal authority is not presided by the mayor of Cayenne. Marie-Laure Phinéra-Horthwas was president of the intercommunal authority of Centre Littoral from 2014 to 2020, and did not run for reelection due to her election to the French Senate in September 2020.

The intercommunal authority of Centre Littoral, which levies its own taxes, is in charge of refuse collection, water supply and sewage treatment, urban planning, and public transport for the of Cayenne and its suburbs.

Until 2015, the commune of Cayenne was divided into six cantons, but these were abolished in 2015 when the department and the region of French Guiana were abolished and replaced by the French Guiana Territorial Collectivity.

===Health===
Health conditions in Cayenne and French Guiana are generally good. The principal illnesses that cause mortality are circulatory, infectious and parasitic diseases, as well as cancer. A branch of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, located in Cayenne, conducts research on tropical and endemic local diseases and is renowned throughout Latin America. Life expectancy averages about 76 years for men and 83 years for women. The main hospital of the city is the Andrée-Rosemon Hospital which opened in 1992.

==Economy==

Cayenne is an important seaport in South America. The major port of Dégrad des Cannes is on the estuary of the river Mahury, replacing Larivot and the Îles du Salut. Timber, rosewood essence, rum, and gold are exported in small quantities. In the mid-1960s sugarcane and pineapple were planted around the city, and a pineapple cannery and a shrimp-processing plant were later built. A seafront avenue links Cayenne with the suburbs of Chaton and Montabo, where the French Institute of Tropical America and the Pasteur Institute are located. Historic landmarks include the Church of the Holy Saviour and a prefecture on the Place d&#x27;Armes. The Félix Eboué International Airport is the only international airport serving Cayenne.

==Climate==
Under the Köppen climate classification, Cayenne has a tropical monsoon climate (&quot;Am&quot;) bordering on an equatorial climate (&quot;Af&quot;). Average high and low temperatures are nearly identical throughout the course of the year, averaging about and respectively, although temperatures are somewhat cooler in the wet season than in the dry season. Cayenne sees copious precipitation during the year, with its weather being more strongly affected by the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) than the trade winds. The city experiences a very lengthy wet season and a very short dry season – the dry season covers only August to October, while the wet season covers the remainder of the year. Some precipitation is seen even during the dry season, a trait common in tropical climates. Cayenne averages roughly of rain each year.

== Heritage ==
=== Saint-Sauveur Cathedral ===
In 1823 Father Nicolas Guiller and Baron , administrator of French Guiana, decided to replace the old church of Saint Nicolas on the current . Work began in 1825 and ended in 1833. The church was inaugurated in 1861 and is registered as a French monument historique.

The high altar, the pulpit, and the confessional of the penitentiary chapel on the Îlet la Mère were transferred to the cathedral in 1876.

In 1933, the church was declared a cathedral. It was consecrated in November 1934 by monseigneur , the first bishop of Guyana. In 1952, construction workers discovered a lead case containing 21 coins, the oldest of which dated to the Napoleonic period, and 20 seals from the reign of Charles X.

Between 1952 and 1954, the ceiling, the windows, and the floors of the tribunal were replaced. The bell tower was renovated in 2000–01.

===Fort Cépérou===
Fort Cépérou, originally known as Fort Saint-Michel, is a 17th-century fortification on Mount Cépérou, named for the Amerindian chief who in 1643 sold the rock on which it stands to the Frenchman Charles Poncet de Brétigny, governor of Cayenne in 1644–1645.

=== Historic houses ===
In recent years the city has renovated a number of historic Creole houses in the city center.

=== Place des Palmistes ===
Initially it was a plaza to aerate the city after the demolition of the city walls in 1810. It was named Place de la Savane (&quot;Savanna Square&quot;) after the grasses that grew there. Later some royal palms from the area of Guisanbourg were planted there, and the plaza was renamed Place des Palmistes (&quot;Royal Palms&#x27; Square&quot;). In 1880, a bronze column was erected bearing the bust of the Marianne, commemorating the seizure of the Bastille. Governor Gaston Gerville-Reache transformed the plaza into an English garden, with artificial hills, masses of flowers and ornamental plants. Because it regularly flooded in the rain, Governor Marc Chanel in 1925 bordered it with a network of cemented canals, still there to this day. A statue of Félix Éboué, an illustrious Guianan, stands at the Merlet fountain. Today it is a lively place where the residents meet. In the evening, food carts sell French fries, sandwiches, local juices and other street food, and bami and lassi (Javanese delicacies brought in by way of Suriname).

=== Botanical garden ===

In 1786, Louis XVI had a garden that served as a storehouse and nursery for various plants and trees from various locations. Louis Claude Richard, director of the garden, brought from India nutmeg trees, rattan, cardamom and black pepper vines. At this period, it was called King&#x27;s Garden. In 1821 a house was built for the botanist. In 1879, the park changed its name and became the Botanical Garden, a floral park in the city center. It covers an area of three hectares. A statue of Gaston Monnerville stands in the garden&#x27;s center.

=== Market and Place du Coq ===

These two adjoining buildings are located near the old port of Cayenne. As early as 1703, a Place du Port appears on a map of the city of Cayenne. It then became Place du Marché in 1842. In 1888, a covered market and a public garden were built there. In 1907 the municipal council led by mayor Eugène Gobert decided to remove the garden and build a new covered market, the one we know today. In 1920 the war memorial of the First World War was inaugurated on the site of the old market, surmounted by a rooster, which gave the place its current name.

=== Village Chinois ===
The &quot;village chionois&quot; (Chinese Village) in Cayenne is located on the edge of the city&#x27;s center along the Cayenne River. Colloquially known as &quot;la&quot; &quot;Crique&quot; or &quot;Chikago&quot;, the neighborhood is reportedly a top destination for internal migration from elsewhere in French Guiana.

== Culture ==
=== Carnival of Cayenne ===
The carnival is one of the major events of the capital. It takes place between Epiphany in early January and Ash Wednesday in February or March.

==== Description and origin ====

This festival is part of the Guianan Creole culture. It was originally a carnival as practiced in Europe. In early colonial times, the settlers held the carnival, but it was forbidden to slaves. Braving the ban, slaves Held clandestine festivals to regain some freedom, celebrate Africans, fertility and harvest, and make fun of the settlers.

The fat days close the carnival: 
*Fat Sunday: day of the grand parade, the biggest carnival parade, where groups compete for prizes for their performance.
*Fat Monday: burlesque marriages; men dress up as brides and women as grooms.
*Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday): carnival goers parade as Diab rouj (red devils), everyone dressed in red and black.
*Ash Wednesday: she-devils dressed all in black and white bury Vaval, the king of the carnival.

==== Carnival of the streets ====
Groups disguised according to the theme of the year march to the rhythm of drums and brass in a parade around decorated floats. These groups prepare for months for to parade in front of thousands of spectators massed on the sidewalks and the stands erected for the occasion.

The best-known groups are:
* Kassialata
* Reno Band
* OsBand
* les Belles de la Madeleine

Brazilian bands just like to those at the Rio Carnival are also appreciated for their alluring rhythms and costumes, and Asian community of Cayenne brings dragons to the parade as well.

==== Masked balls ====

Nightclubs, called &quot;universities&quot; in this context, organize masked balls in which men come to dance with Touloulous at soirées held on Friday and Saturday nights. This tradition is peculiar to French Guiana, and does not exist anywhere else.

The carnival dances are the polka, mazurka, biguine and . The Touloulou invite the men to dance, and the men cannot refuse. Only Touloulous have the right to dance, and if a undisguised woman tries to dance, the orchestra stops playing.

Since the 1990s, tololo parties have been held where men disguise themselves and play the role of the Touloulous, inviting undisguised women to dance. These evenings are more and more popular and take place several times during the carnival.

The family carnival

Families gather every week to eat king cake, a European tradition observed throughout the carnival. The cake can be frangipane, cream, coconut or guava.

After the abolition of slavery in 1848, the economy of French Guiana was devastated, and much of the population lived by working the land in “habitations”. People farmed and knew the value of working together. The tradition of the king cake was born in the Guiana of this period, or more precisely, “rend le bouquet”. One couple organized the meal and celebration, and at its end designated the couple who would organize the following gathering by handing them the bouquet.

==Main sights==
Cayenne centres on its main commercial street, the Avenue Général de Gaulle. At the east end of the avenue near the coast is the Place des Palmistes and the Place de Grenoble (also known as the Place Léopold Héder). Most of the official buildings are located in this area: the Hôtel de Ville (the town hall) built by Jesuits in the 1890s, the Post Office, the Préfecture, residence of French Guiana&#x27;s Préfect, and the Musée Départmental Franconie. To the west of this area lies Fort Cépérou, built in the 17th century, though now mostly in ruins. To the south lie the Place du Coq and Place Victor Schoelcher (named in honour of the anti-slavery activist) and a market.

To the south of this compact region is the &quot;Village Chinois&quot; (known as Chicago), separated from the rest of Cayenne by the Canal Laussat. It has a reputation for being a dangerous area.

Other buildings in the city include Cayenne Cathedral, municipal library, the municipal museum and a museum of French Guianese Culture (Musée des Cultures Guyanaise) and a scientific research institute (IRD or Institut de recherche pour le développement, formerly Orstom). The Jardin botanique de Cayenne is the city&#x27;s botanical garden.

==Transport==
Cayenne is served by the Cayenne – Félix Eboué Airport, which is located in the neighbouring commune of Matoury.

French Guiana&#x27;s main seaport is the port of Dégrad des Cannes, located on the estuary of the Mahury River, in the commune of Remire-Montjoly, a south-eastern suburb of Cayenne. Almost all of French Guiana&#x27;s imports and exports pass through the port of Dégrad des Cannes. Built in 1974, it replaced the old harbour of Cayenne which was congested and could not cope with modern traffic.

Cayenne is connected to Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni via the Route nationale 1, and to Saint-Georges via the Route nationale 2.

==Education==
Cayenne is home to the University of French Guiana, formerly a campus of the University of the French West Indies until a strike concerning university funding led to the creation of a separate institution in 2014.

==In popular culture==

In The Hardy Boys #12: &quot;Footprints Under the Window&quot;, the Hardys&#x27; investigations take them to Cayenne.

The 1955 film &quot;We&#x27;re No Angels&quot; involves three prisoners who escaped from Devil&#x27;s Island and settled incognito into a family store in Cayenne.

<text>Eschersheim is a city district of Frankfurt am Main, Germany. It is part of the &quot;Ortsbezirk Mitte-Nord&quot; and is subdivided into the &quot;Stadtbezirke&quot; Eschersheim-Nord and Eschersheim-Süd.

Eschersheim, with a historical record beginning around 1000, is a district in the north of Frankfurt. It sits above the Nidda River and on the opposite bank from Heddernheim. The old part of Eschersheim, &quot;Alt-Eschersheim&quot;, is situated between the railroad and the public swimming pool. The patronage was held since 1467 by the Benedictine monastery Seligenstadt. Ecclesiastical Middle Authority was the Archdeacon of the provost of St. Peter in Mainz.

Around 1900 Eschersheim, previously a rural village without industry, became a wealthy residential area; it was incorporated into Frankfurt in 1910. In the twenties and thirties Walter Gropius built the new settlement &quot;Am Lindenbaum,&quot; around the water tower in the southern part of the district. In the fifties, more living complexes were built.

One of Eschersheim&#x27;s oldest landmarks is an ancient lime tree planted sometime shortly after 1648 to mark the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

==Notable people==
* Friedrich Wöhler (1800–1882) chemist, known especially for his synthesis of urea, was born in Eschersheim.

<text>Dawid Markelowicz Janowski (25 May 1868 – 15 January 1927; often spelled &quot;David&quot;) was a Polish chess player. Several opening variations are named after Janowski.

== Biography ==
Born into a Jewish-Polish family in Wołkowysk, Russian Empire (now Belarus), he settled in Paris around 1890 and began his professional chess career in 1894. He won tournaments in Monte Carlo 1901, Hanover 1902 and tied for first at Vienna 1902. 

Janowski was devastating against the older masters such as Wilhelm Steinitz (+5−2), Mikhail Chigorin (+17−4=4) and Joseph Henry Blackburne (+6−2=2). He had minus scores, however, against newer players such as Siegbert Tarrasch (+5−9=3), Frank Marshall (+28−34=18), Akiba Rubinstein (+3−5), Géza Maróczy (+5−10=5) and Carl Schlechter (+13−20=13). He was outclassed by world champions Emanuel Lasker (+4−25=7) and José Raúl Capablanca (+1−9=1), but scored respectably against Alexander Alekhine (+2−4=2). In particular, he was able to beat at least once each of the first four world champions, a feat shared with Siegbert Tarrasch alone.

Janowski played three matches against Emanuel Lasker: two friendly matches in 1909 (+2−2 and +1−7=2) and one match for the world chess championship in 1910 (−8=3). The longer 1909 match has sometimes been called a world championship match, but research by Edward Winter indicates that the title was not at stake.

In July–August 1914, he was playing an international chess tournament, the 19th DSB Congress (German Chess Federation Congress) in Mannheim, Germany, with four wins, four draws and three losses (seventh place), when World War I broke out.
Players at Mannheim representing countries now at war with Germany were interned. He, as well as Alexander Alekhine, was interned but released to Switzerland after a short internment.
In 1915, he left Europe for the United States and spent the next nine years there before returning to Paris. At New York 1916, in the final, he shared second place with Oscar Chajes, after José Raúl Capablanca. He won at Atlantic City 1921 (the eighth American Chess Congress) and took third place at Lake Hopatcong 1923 (the ninth ACC).

He died in France on 15 January 1927 of tuberculosis.

== Playing style ==
Janowski played very quickly and was known as a sharp tactician who was devastating with the bishop pair. Capablanca annotated some Janowski games with great admiration, and said, &quot;when in form [he] is one of the most feared opponents who can exist&quot;. Capablanca noted that Janowski&#x27;s greatest weakness as a player was in the endgame, and Janowski reportedly told him, &quot;I detest the endgame.&quot; American champion Frank Marshall remembered Janowski&#x27;s talent and his stubbornness. In &quot;Marshall&#x27;s Best Games of Chess&quot; he wrote that Janowski &quot;could follow the wrong path with greater determination than any man I ever met!&quot; Reuben Fine remembered Janowski as a player of considerable talent, but a &quot;master of the alibi&quot; with respect to his defeats. Fine said that his losses invariably occurred because it was too hot, or too cold, or the windows were open too far, or not far enough. He also noted that Janowski was sometimes unpopular with his colleagues because of his predilection for doggedly playing on even in an obviously lost position, hoping his opponent might blunder. Edward Lasker in his book &quot;Chess Secrets I Learned from the Masters&quot; recalled that Janowski was an inveterate but undisciplined gambler who would often lose all of his chess winnings at the roulette wheel.

== Legacy ==

Several openings variations carry Janowski&#x27;s name.

<text>No Substance is the tenth full-length album by the punk rock band Bad Religion. It was the band&#x27;s third (or fourth, if the reissue of &quot;Recipe for Hate&quot; is counted) release on Atlantic Records, and their second studio album since guitarist Brett Gurewitz&#x27;s departure.

&quot;No Substance&quot; was anticipated by both music critics and fans as a result of the band&#x27;s previous worldwide successes with their 1994 major label debut &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot; and its 1996 follow up &quot;The Gray Race&quot;. The album has been met with mixed reviews and was not as successful as band&#x27;s past releases. The album was re-released by Epitaph Records on September 15, 2008. No songs of the album would turn into live staples; &quot;Raise Your Voice&quot; is occasionally played live in Germany due to Die Toten Hosen singer Campino&#x27;s guest vocals.

==Reception==

Author Dave Thompson, in his book &quot;Alternative Rock&quot; (2000), wrote that the shared songwriting credits make this the band&#x27;s &quot;most eclectic album ever, eagerly exploring new sounds and styles... ah, &quot;Into the Unknown II&quot;! Only better.&quot;

<text>Julius Leopold Korngold (24 December 1860 – 25 September 1945) was an Austrian music critic. He was the leading critic in early twentieth century Vienna, serving as chief music critic of the &quot;Neue Freie Presse&quot; from 1904 to 1934. His son was the composer Erich Wolfgang Korngold, whom he named after Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, one of his favorite composers.

==Life and career==
He was the father of composer Erich Wolfgang Korngold. He co-wrote the libretto of the opera &quot;Die tote Stadt&quot; with his son (under the collective pseudonym Paul Schott). He died in Hollywood, California on 25 September 1945.

In his time, he was known as the &quot;dean of European music critics&quot;. He is most notable for championing the works of Gustav Mahler at a time when many did not think much of him.

<text>Louis Godin (28 February 1704 – 11 September 1760) was a French astronomer and member of the French Academy of Sciences. He worked in Peru, Spain, Portugal and France.

==Biography==
Godin was born in Paris; his parents were François Godin and Elisabeth Charron. He was graduated at the College of Louis le Grand, and studied astronomy under Joseph-Nicolas Delisle. His astronomical tables (1724) gave him reputation, and the French Academy of Sciences elected him a pensionary member. He was commissioned to write a continuation of the history of the academy, left uncompleted by Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle, and was also authorized to submit to the minister, Cardinal André-Hercule de Fleury, the best means of discovering the truth in regard to the figure of the Earth, and proposed sending expeditions to the equator and the polar sea. The minister approved the plan and appropriated the necessary means, the academy designating Charles Marie de La Condamine, Pierre Bouguer, and Godin to go to Peru in 1734.

The expedition sailed from La Rochelle on 16 May 1735, touched at Cadiz to take two naval lieutenants, Jorge Juan y Santacilia and Antonio de Ulloa, whom Philip V had ordered to accompany it, and proceeded to Santo Domingo, where they remained six months to take observations. They arrived in Quito in February 1736, immediately crossed the Andes to establish their stations in the interior, and remained two years.

When they had finished their task in 1738, at the invitation of the Viceroy of Peru, Godin accepted the professorship in mathematics in Lima, where he also established a course of astronomical lectures. When the 1746 Lima–Callao earthquake destroyed the greater part of Lima, he took valuable seismological observations, assisted the sufferers, and made plans by the use of which the new buildings would be less exposed to danger from renewed shocks.

In 1751 he returned to Europe, but found that he had been nearly forgotten, and superseded as pensioner of the academy; and, as his fortune had been lost in unfortunate speculations, he accepted the presidency of the college for midshipmen in Cádiz in Spain in 1752. During the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, which was distinctly felt at Cádiz, he took observations and did much to allay the apprehensions of the public, for which he was ennobled by the king of Spain. In 1759 he was called to Paris and reinstated as pensionary member of the academy, but he died on his return to Cádiz.

<doc id="497333" wikidata="Q1606520" url="?curid=497333" title="Plan of Iguala">
<text>The Plan of Iguala, also known as the Plan of the Three Guarantees (&quot;Plan Trigarante&quot;) or Act of Independence of North America, was a revolutionary proclamation promulgated on 24 February 1821, in the final stage of the Mexican War of Independence from Spain. The Plan stated that Mexico was to become a constitutional monarchy, whose sole official religion would be Roman Catholicism, in which both the &quot;Peninsulares&quot; (people born in Spain and residing in Mexico) and the &quot;Americanos&quot; (people born in Mexico, that is, the Americas) would enjoy equal political and social rights. It took its name from the city of Iguala in the modern-day state of Guerrero.

The two main figures behind the Plan were Agustín de Iturbide (who would become Emperor of Mexico) and Vicente Guerrero, revolutionary rebel leader and later President of Mexico. The Army of the Three Guarantees was formed by the unified forces of Iturbide and Guerrero to defend the ideals of the Plan of Iguala. On 24 August 1821, Iturbide and Spanish viceroy Juan O&#x27;Donojú signed the Treaty of Córdoba in Córdoba, Veracruz, ratifying the Plan of Iguala, and thus confirming Mexico&#x27;s independence.

The Plan, a compromise, introduced new ideas and preserved others. For example, it established a new army, but it preserved the constitutional right of all males to vote regardless of place of birth, ethnic origin, or economic condition, which had been enshrined in the Constitution of 1812 and which was in force at the time of the Plan.

==Three Guarantees==

The Plan of Iguala established three central principles for the nascent Mexican state: the primacy of Roman Catholicism, the absolute political independence of Mexico, and full social equality for all social and ethnic groups in the new country. These are the &quot;Three Guarantees&quot; by which the Plan is sometimes known, summarized as &quot;Religion, Independence and Unity&quot; (&quot;Religión, Independencia y Unión&quot;). The tricolor flag of the Army of Three Guarantees is a symbolic representation of the three guarantees, and is the colour scheme for the post-independence red, green, and white Mexican flag.

The document explicitly includes all residents of Mexico&#x27;s geographic territory among its citizens: the preamble refers to &quot;Americans, under which term are included not only those born in America, but Europeans, Africans and Asians who reside in it,&quot; and Article 12 states: &quot;All the inhabitants of the Mexican Empire, without any other distinction besides merit and virtue, are suitable citizens to apply for any employment,&quot; or &quot;All the inhabitants of New Spain, without any distinction between Europeans, Africans, nor Indians, are citizens of this Monarchy with option to all employment depending on their merit and virtues,&quot; depending on the copy.

==Aftermath==
Although the Spanish Viceroy had ratified the Treaty of Córdoba, the Spanish Congress meeting in Madrid on 13 February 1822 repudiated the Treaty as &quot;illegal, null, and void.&quot; The Mexican government, however, insisted upon O&#x27;Donojú&#x27;s acceptance of the Plan as legally establishing the country&#x27;s independence and sovereignty. Spain responded with a series of efforts to reconquer Mexico over the following decade. It eventually recognized Mexico&#x27;s independence on 28 December 1836 by the Santa María–Calatrava Treaty, signed in Madrid by the Mexican Commissioner, Miguel Santa Maria, and the Spanish state minister, Jose Maria Calatrava.

Following the fall of Iturbide&#x27;s empire, the Mexican Congress abrogated both the Plan of Iguala and the Treaty of Córdoba as the basis for the government on 8 April 1823. Instead, a new constitutional convention was called which led to the adoption of the 1824 Constitution of Mexico on 4 October 1824.

<text>Chevington is a cow&#x27;s milk cheese, made in Northumberland, England, by the Northumberland Cheese Company. It was first developed by John W. Annett of Chevington West Farm, Northumberland in 1895 before being revived in 2003 as a slightly modified version of the original recipe that was found in public records. It is a semi-soft cheese, made from mould-ripened Jersey milk.

<doc id="497335" wikidata="Q320017" url="?curid=497335" title="Carl Schlechter">
<text>Carl Schlechter (2 March 1874 – 27 December 1918) was a leading Austro-Hungarian chess master and theoretician at the turn of the 20th century. He is best known for drawing a World Chess Championship match with Emanuel Lasker.

==Early life==
Schlechter was born into a Catholic family in Vienna. He is sometimes deemed to be Jewish, although others dispute this. He began playing chess at the age of 13. His first and only teacher was an Austria-Hungarian chess problemist, Dr. Samuel Gold.

From 1893 onwards, he played in over 50 international chess tournaments. He won or shared first at Munich 1900 (the 12th DSB Congress), Coburg 1904 (the 14th DSB Congress), Ostend 1906, Stockholm 1906, Vienna 1908, Prague 1908, Hamburg 1910 (the 17th DSB Congress), and thrice in the Trebitsch Memorial in Vienna (1911, 1912, 1913).

Schlechter played several matches. He drew with Georg Marco (+0−0=10) in 1893, drew with Marco and Adolf Zinkl both (+4−4=3) in 1894, drew with Dawid Janowski (+2−2=3) in 1896, drew with Simon Alapin (+1−1=4) in 1899, beat Janowski (+6−1=3) in 1902, drew with Richard Teichmann (+1−1=1) in 1904, and drew with Siegbert Tarrasch (+3−3=10) in 1911.

==Lasker–Schlechter match==
In 1910, Schlechter played a match against Emanuel Lasker for the World Chess Championship (in Vienna and Berlin). Schlechter was leading by one point going into the tenth and final game of the match. In the tenth game tragedy struck: after first achieving a won game, Schlechter blundered into a clearly drawn position and then blundered again which led to his loss of the game. The match ended tied at 5–5 (+1 −1 =8) and Lasker retained his title. It is disputed as to whether Schlechter needed to score +2 to win the match and thus needed to win the tenth game. No contract for the match has ever been found and no evidence supporting this rumor has ever been produced. (For match details see World Chess Championship 1910.) Schlechter distinguished himself as the first player in 16 years to seriously challenge Lasker&#x27;s world title.

==Later life==
Schlechter&#x27;s final years were strugglesome as it was becoming increasingly difficult to make ends meet as a chess professional. During World War I, he thrice won Trebitsch Memorial in Vienna. In the last year of his life, he took third in Vienna, lost a match to Akiba Rubinstein (+1−2=3), took second place in Berlin (&quot;Quadrangular&quot;, Milan Vidmar won), tied for third place in Kaschau, and took third place in Berlin (&quot;Quadrangular&quot;, Emanuel Lasker won). Schlechter died of pneumonia and starvation on 27 December 1918 and was buried in Budapest on 31 December 1918.

==Assessment==
The Carl Schlechter–Arthur Kaufmann–Hugo Fähndrich trio propagated the Viennese chess school, founded by Max Weiss in the 19th century.

Schlechter prepared the eighth and final edition of the famous &quot;Handbuch des Schachspiels&quot; openings treatise. Published in eleven parts between 1912 and 1916, it totaled 1,040 pages and included contributions by Rudolf Spielmann, Siegbert Tarrasch, and Richard Teichmann. International Master William Hartston called it &quot;a superb work, perhaps the last to encase successfully the whole of chess knowledge within a single volume.&quot;

He was a typical example of a gentleman chess player of old, offering courteous draws to opponents who felt unwell. If his opponent arrived late for a game, Schlechter would inconspicuously subtract an equal amount of time from his own clock. He also mentored many of his rivals, including Oldřich Duras.

==List of opening variations named after Schlechter==

There are several &quot;Schlechter Variations&quot; in the chess openings:
*Schlechter Gambit in the Bird&#x27;s Opening: 1.f4 e5 2.fxe5 Nc6
*Schlechter Variation of the French Defence: 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Bd3
*Schlechter Variation of the Slav Defence: 1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nf3 Nf6 4.e3 g6 (or via a Grünfeld move order, 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5 4.e3 c6)
*Schlechter Variation of the Danish Gambit: 1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.c3 dxc3 4.Bc4 cxb2 5.Bxb2 d5

==Notable games==
*Fried vs. Schlechter, Vienna 1894, From&#x27;s Gambit (A02), 0–1 A breezy 14-move win by Schlechter, who sacrifices his queen and mates his opponent&#x27;s king in the middle of the board.
*Bernhard Fleissig vs. Schlechter, Vienna 1893 (friendly), Polish Opening: General (A00), 0–1 One of Schlechter&#x27;s most famous games, Black sacrifices both his rooks and bishops.
*Schlechter vs. Steinitz, Cologne 1898, Vienna Game (C28), 1–0 Schlechter routs the former World Champion in 24 moves.
*Schlechter vs. Meitner, Vienna 1899, Italian Game: Classical Variation. Greco Gambit Moeller–Therkatz Attack (C54), 1–0 A combination in the endgame: White sacrifices his queen then makes a quiet move with his king, and Black is unable to prevent a mate in two moves.

==In popular culture==
The central character of the 1998 novel &quot;Carl Haffner&#x27;s Love of the Draw&quot; by Thomas Glavinic is closely based on Schlechter. The book presents a fictionalised account of his 1910 World Chess Championship match with Lasker.

<doc id="497338" wikidata="Q57310" url="?curid=497338" title="Efim Bogoljubow">
<text>Efim Bogoljubow, also known as Efim Dimitrijewitsch Bogoljubow (April 14, 1889 – June 18, 1952), was a Russian-born German chess grandmaster.

==Early career==
Bogoljubow learned how to play chess at 15 years old, and developed a serious interest at the age of 18. His father was a priest. Originally he wanted to become a priest too, and studied theology in Kiev, but he decided otherwise and enrolled in the Polytechnical Institute to study agriculture. He did not finish his studies and instead focused on chess.

In 1911, Bogoljubow tied for first place in the Kiev championships, and finished 9–10th in the Saint Petersburg (All-Russian Amateur) Tournament, won by Stepan Levitsky. In 1912, he took second place, behind Karel Hromádka, in Vilna (Vilnius) (&quot;Hauptturnier&quot;). In 1913/14, Bogoljubow finished eighth in Saint Petersburg (All Russian Masters&#x27; Tournament – eighth Russian championship; Alexander Alekhine and Aron Nimzowitsch came joint first).

==World War I: Interned in Germany==
In July/August 1914, Bogoljubow played in the Mannheim tournament (the 19th DSB Congress), and tied for 8–9th in that event, which was interrupted by World War I. After the declaration of war against Russia, eleven &quot;Russian players&quot; (Alekhine, Bogoljubow, Fedor Bogatyrchuk, Alexander Flamberg, N. Koppelman, Boris Maliutin, Ilya Rabinovich, Peter Romanovsky, Peter Petrovich Saburov, Alexey Selezniev, Samuil Weinstein) from the Mannheim tournament were interned by Germany. In September 1914, four of the internees (Alekhine, Bogatyrchuk, Saburov, and Koppelman) were allowed to return home via Switzerland. The remaining Russian internees played eight tournaments, the first held in Baden-Baden (1914) and all the others in Triberg im Schwarzwald (1914–1917). Bogoljubow took second place (behind Alexander Flamberg) in Baden-Baden, and won five times in Triberg (1914–1916). During this time he met Frieda Kaltenbach, daughter of a schoolteacher. They married in 1920 and had two daughters. Bogoljubow spent most of the rest of his life in Germany.

==Successes and world championship matches==

After the war, Bogoljubow won many international tournaments; at Berlin 1919, Stockholm 1919, Kiel 1921, and Pistyan (Pieštany) 1922. He tied for 1st–3rd at Karlsbad (Karlovy Vary) 1923. He sent his winnings from Pistyan to Triberg, where his wife used them to buy a house. The Bogoljubows made an income by renting rooms to tourists and visitors.

In 1924, Bogoljubow briefly returned to Russia, which had since become the Soviet Union, and won consecutive Soviet championships in 1924 and 1925. He also won at Breslau (Wrocław) 1925, and in Moscow, ahead of a field which included Emanuel Lasker and José Raúl Capablanca. This made him the only player to ever become both German and Soviet champion in the same year.

In the Soviet Union, Bogoljubow was not allowed to play tournaments without permission from Nikolai Krylenko. Thus in 1926, Bogoljubow emigrated to Germany, and thereafter became a &quot;non-person&quot; in the Soviet Union: mention of his name was forbidden. He won ahead of Akiba Rubinstein that year at Berlin. At Kissingen 1928, Bogoljubow triumphed (+6−1=4) over a field which included Capablanca, Nimzowitsch and Savielly Tartakower, et al. Bogoljubow won two matches against Max Euwe (both 5½–4½) in 1928 and 1928/29 in the Netherlands. He played matches for the World Chess Championship twice against Alekhine, losing 15½–9½ in 1929, and 15½–10½ in 1934.

Bogoljubow represented Germany at first board in the 4th Chess Olympiad at Prague 1931, winning the individual silver medal (+9−1=7).

In 1930, Bogoljubow twice tied for 2nd–3rd with Nimzowitsch, after Alekhine, in Sanremo; then with Gösta Stoltz, behind Isaac Kashdan, in Stockholm. In 1931, he tied for 1st–2nd in Swinemünde (27th DSB Congress). In 1933, Bogoljubow won in Bad Pyrmont (1st GER-ch). In 1935, he won at Bad Nauheim, and Bad Saarow. Bogoljubow tied for 1st–2nd at Berlin 1935, Bad Elster 1936, Bad Elster 1937. Bogoljubow won at Bremen 1937, Bad Elster 1938, and Stuttgart 1939 (the 1st &quot;Europaturnier&quot;).

When the Nazis came to power in 1933, Bogoljubow was no longer allowed to play for the German national team or in German championships. His situation was not helped even after he joined the Nazi party in 1938, so that his daughters would be allowed to study at university. Nonetheless, he coached the German national team for the 1936 (unofficial) and 1939 Chess Olympiads.

Accounts of Bogoljubow&#x27;s opinion of the Nazis differ between sources. Hans Kmoch claims that he insisted to play with the swastika flag at Zandvoort 1936, but Fedor Bogatyrchuk claimed that he did not like to wear it, and that Bogoljubow was &quot;only formally&quot; a member of the Nazi party. Bogatyrchuk is quoted by Bogoljubow&#x27;s biographer, Sergei Soloviov, as saying: &quot;It was not a secret at all that E.D. [Bogoljubow] did not like the Bolsheviks, but I think only a few people knew that he was treating Hitler&#x27;s wild ideas with at least equal revulsion and contempt.&quot;

==World War II and after==

Hans Frank, who enjoyed meeting top players and playing consultation games against them, invited Bogoljubow to move to Krakow to work as a chess player and translator. During World War II, Bogoljubow lost a match to Euwe (+2−5=3) at Krefeld 1941, and drew a mini-match with Alekhine (+2−2=0) at Warsaw 1943. He also played in numerous tournaments held in Germany and the General Government throughout the war. In 1940, Bogoljubow won in Berlin, and tied for 1st–2nd with Anton Kohler in Kraków/Krynica/ Warsaw (the 1st GG-ch). In 1941, he took fourth in Munich (the second &quot;Europaturnier&quot;; Stoltz won), and finished third, behind Alekhine and Paul Felix Schmidt, in Kraków/Warsaw (the 2nd GG-ch). In 1942, Bogoljubow finished fifth in Salzburg Grandmasters&#x27; tournament (Alekhine won), tied for third–fifth in Munich (1st European Championship – &quot;Europameisterschaft&quot;; Alekhine won), took third in Warsaw /Lublin/ Kraków (the 3rd GG-ch; Alekhine won). In 1943, he took fourth in Salzburg (Paul Keres and Alekhine won), and tied for second–third in Krynica (the 4th GG-ch; Josef Lokvenc won). In 1944, Bogoljubow won, ahead of Fedor Bogatyrchuk, in Radom (the 5th GG-ch). Bogoljubow trained Klaus Junge, Wolfgang Unzicker, and Klaus Darga.

After the war, Bogoljubow lived in West Germany, and was once again allowed to play in German championships. While his level of play had declined significantly by this time, nevertheless, in 1947, he won in Lüneburg, and Kassel. In 1949, Bogoljubow won in Bad Pyrmont (third West GER-ch), and tied for first–second with Elmārs Zemgalis in Oldenburg. In 1951, he won in Augsburg, and Saarbrücken.

The World Chess Federation (FIDE) did not award Bogoljubow the title International Grandmaster in 1950, as he was then considered politically compromised: pressure from the Soviet chess federation played a part in this decision. However, following outrage from the West, FIDE awarded him the title in 1951.

Bogoljubow died in his sleep in 1952, aged 63. He was posthumously rehabilitated in the Soviet Union after the beginning of perestroika.

==Legacy==

The opening known as the Bogo-Indian Defence (1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 Bb4+) is named after Bogoljubow.

== Quotations ==
* &quot;When I am White I win because I am White. When I am Black I win because I am Bogoljubow.&quot;
* &quot;To have a knight planted in your game at K6 (e3/e6) is worse than a rusty nail in your knee.&quot;

<text>A single-player video game is a video game where input from only one player is expected throughout the gameplay. Video games in general can feature several game modes, including single-player modes designed to be played by a single player in addition to multi-player modes.

Most modern console games and arcade games are designed so that they can be played by a single player; although many of these games have modes that allow two or more players to play (not necessarily simultaneously), very few actually require more than one player for the game to be played. The &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; series is one example of such.

==History==

The earliest video games, such as &quot;Tennis for Two&quot; (1958), &quot;Spacewar!&quot; (1962), and &quot;Pong&quot; (1972), were symmetrical games designed to be played by two players. Single-player games gained popularity only after this, with early titles such as &quot;Speed Race&quot; (1974) and &quot;Space Invaders&quot; (1978).

The reason for this, according to Raph Koster, is down to a combination of several factors: increasingly sophisticated computers and interfaces that enabled asymmetric gameplay, cooperative gameplay and story delivery within a gaming framework, coupled with the fact that the majority of early games players had introverted personality types (according to the Myers-Briggs personality type indicator).

Although most modern games incorporate a single-player element either as the core or as one of several game modes, single-player gaming had been viewed by the video game industry as peripheral to the future of gaming, with Electronic Arts vice president Frank Gibeau stating in 2012 that he had not approved one game to be developed as a single-player experience.

The question of the financial viability of single-player AAA games was raised following the closure of Visceral Games by Electronic Arts (EA) in October 2017. Visceral had been a studio that established itself on a strong narrative single-player focus with &quot;Dead Space&quot;, and had been working on a single-player, linear narrative &quot;Star Wars&quot; game at the time of the closure; EA announced following this that they would be taking the game in a different direction, specifically &quot;a broader experience that allows for more variety and player agency&quot;. Many commentators felt that EA made the change as they did not have confidence that a studio with an AAA-scale budget could produce a viable single-player game based on the popular &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise. Alongside this, as well as relatively poor sales of games in the year prior that were principally AAA single-player games (&quot;Resident Evil 7&quot;, &quot;Prey&quot;, &quot;Dishonored 2&quot;, and &quot;Deus Ex: Mankind Divided&quot;) against financially successful multiplayer games and those offer a games-as-a-service model (&quot;Overwatch&quot;, &quot;Destiny 2&quot;, and &quot;Star Wars Battlefront 2&quot;), were indicators to many that the single-player model for AAA was waning. Manveer Heir, who had left EA after finishing his gameplay design work for &quot;Mass Effect Andromeda&quot;, acknowledged that the culture within EA was against the development of single-player games, and with Visceral&#x27;s closure, &quot;that the linear single-player triple-A game at EA is dead for the time being&quot;. Bethesda on December 7, 2017, decided to collaborate with Lynda Carter to launch a Public Safety Announcement to save single-player gaming.

A few years later in 2021, EA was reported to have revived interest in single-player games, following the successful launch of &quot;Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order&quot; in 2020. The company still planned on releasing live service games with multiplayer components, but began evaluating its IP catalog for more single-player titles to revive, such as a remake of the &quot;Dead Space&quot; franchise. Around the same time, head of Xbox Game Studios Phil Spencer said that they still see a place for narrative-driven single-player games even though the financial drivers of the market tended to be live service games. Spencer said that developing such games with AAA-scale budgets can be risky, but with availability of services like cloud gaming and subscription services, they can gauge audience reaction to these games early on and reduce the risk involved before releases.

==Game elements==
As the narrative and conflict in single-player gameplay is created by a computer rather than a human opponent, single-player games are able to deliver certain gaming experiences that are typically absent—or de-emphasised—in multiplayer games.

===Story===

Single-player games rely more heavily on compelling stories to draw the player into the experience and to create a sense of investment. Humans are unpredictable, so human players - allies or enemies - cannot be relied upon to carry a narrative in a particular direction, and so multiplayer games tend not to focus heavily on a linear narrative. By contrast, many single-player games are built around a compelling story.

===Characters===
While a multiplayer game relies upon human-human interaction for its conflict, and often for its sense of camaraderie, a single-player game must build these things artificially. As such, single-player games require deeper characterisation of their non-player characters in order to create connections between the player and the sympathetic characters and to develop deeper antipathy towards the game&#x27;s antagonists. This is typically true of role-playing games (RPGs), such as &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; and the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, which are primarily character-driven and have a different setting.

===Exceptions===
These game elements are not firm, fixed rules; single-player puzzle games such as &quot;Tetris&quot; or racing games focus squarely on gameplay.

<doc id="497348" wikidata="Q4896096" url="?curid=497348" title="Beryl the Peril">
<text>Beryl the Peril (or simply Beryl) is a fictional character created by David Law, the creator of Dennis the Menace, for issue 1 of &quot;The Topper&quot; comic (dated 7 February 1953) published by DC Thomson &amp; Co. Limited. Like Dennis, she had black and red apparel, and devilishly tormented her parents and other members of her community. Despite not having quite as many appearances as other DC Thomson characters such as Dennis the Menace or Desperate Dan, Beryl is still considered one of the classic characters which define the popularity of British comics.

==Publication history==
===Creation and concept===
Beryl the Peril first appeared in the first issue of &quot;The Topper&quot; in 1953. She was created to be a female equivalent to &quot;The Beano&quot;&#x27;s Dennis the Menace. Davey Law, her artist and creator, drew inspiration from his daughter, who would often pull faces during her tantrums. The strips were similar in concept to the Dennis the Menace ones in that she would cause chaos through menacing her neighbours, parents and school teachers. In 1958, Beryl was chosen as one of the few of D.C. Thomson&#x27;s characters to earn an annual all to herself, consisting solely from reprints in past years.

===Retirement of Law and rise in popularity===
When Law retired in 1970 her strip was taken over by Bob McGrath and later John Dallas. Her costume changed at some point in the mid-1980s from her red top underneath a black dress to a blue and white striped jumper underneath a red dress. In 1986 she became &quot;The Topper&quot;&#x27;s front page star, replacing Tricky Dicky. Her dog Pearl was also introduced shortly before that time, although before that she had a pet turkey called Gobbler. The same year, Robert Nixon took over, a cartoonist who followed in the steps of noted cartoonist Ken Reid, and her overall look became smoother and fuller. She also appeared far less like Dennis the Menace and seemed far more individual as a character. She remained with the comic when &quot;The Topper&quot; merged with &quot;The Beezer&quot; in 1990.

===Move to &quot;The Dandy&quot;===
&quot;The Beezer and Topper&quot; was cancelled in August 1993, and Beryl joined &quot;The Dandy&quot; comic. Notably, she was the only Beezer and Topper character to transfer to &quot;The Dandy&quot; as soon as the former comic folded. (The following refugee, Potsworth &amp; Co., did not make the transition until about a month later when &quot;The Dandy&quot; went full colour, and later strips to make the transition were often retooled in the case of Blinky.)

===Karl Dixon&#x27;s Revamp===
In 1999, the strip was taken over by Ollie Fliptrik artist Karl Dixon as Nixon had to go into semi-retirement due to health problems. It was around this time where the scripts began to take more of a domestic approach, and started to revolve more around Beryl&#x27;s relationship with her dad. This formula had previously been used on another &quot;Dandy&quot; character, Dinah Mo, who had been dropped from the comic after the death of her last artist, Pete Moonie. The following year, Beryl&#x27;s appearance was revamped. She reverted to her black and red clothes and her hairstyle became much more like that of Dennis the Menace – but her pigtails remained. She regained many of her Dennis-influenced traits as well such as the famous &quot;behind the nose&quot; grin and constant scowl. Beryl also attended Dennis the Menace&#x27;s 50th birthday party, although she was a latecomer so she didn&#x27;t actually participate in any of the party games or fights prior.

Beryl disappeared for a while after the October 2004 &quot;Dandy&quot; relaunch. Apart from one appearance in December that year, she returned from issue 3302, dated 12 March 2005.

From &quot;The Dandy&quot; issue dated 3 March 2006, Steve Bright took over Beryl as artist and her appearance reverted to how she had been drawn by David Law She went through another costume change – a baggy green and red T-shirt with baggy black jeans and trainers. However, she disappeared when &quot;The Dandy&quot; was relaunched in August 2007. She later re-appeared for four issues, but as reprints from the Nixon era.

===Pass the Peril===
In 2010, &quot;The Dandy&quot; was relaunched, dropping the &quot;Xtreme&quot; from its title and focusing far more on comics. Despite not immediately returning as a strip, Beryl made several cameo appearances in the revamped Dandy. In a segment entitled &quot;What&#x27;s in Cheryl&#x27;s hair,&quot; a menacing-looking girl with pigtails is seen peeking out. This was labelled Beryl Cole and so is therefore not deemed an official appearance. However, she did make a return digitally via the social networking site Facebook. She was involved in an artist event called &quot;Pass the Peril&quot; in which four different artists were to draw four different strips based on the character and the website. The first was drawn by Steve Beckett and saw Beryl informing her father that her adventures would now continue via Facebook in which she, very much in character, smashed her father&#x27;s face with a book. The second, drawn by Andy Fanton, shows Beryl mocking how it is fine to &quot;write on a Wall&quot; on Facebook but is considered deviant in real life, revealing that she has been tagging all over Dandy town. The third was illustrated by Nik Holmes and consisted of Beryl contacting old friends through Facebook and featured cameos of past Dandy and Topper characters such as Tricky Dicky, Mickey the Monkey and Smasher. The final strip was drawn by Nigel Auchterlounie and finished with Beryl deciding to un-Like her father on Facebook. This causes a chain effect in which other famous characters from &quot;The Dandy&quot; – including Korky the Cat, Desperate Dan and Bananaman – also unfriend her father, much to his dismay.

Beryl made her first appearance in the revamped &quot;Dandy&quot; comic in a Justin Beaver strip. She, alongside Minnie the Minx and Toots, appeared in the comic&#x27;s title card chasing after Justin. She made yet another appearance in a &quot;Harry and his Hippo&quot; strip, drawn by Andy Fanton. In this strip, she is enjoying the &quot;Dandy&quot; swimming pool alongside other famous past &quot;Dandy&quot; characters.

Pass the Peril returned to Facebook mid-2011, this time focusing on Beryl attempting to make her own film. Also, the character returned in the 2012 &quot;Dandy Annual&quot;, once again drawn by Karl Dixon.

Beryl returned to the main &quot;Dandy&quot; in February 2012 as reprints from the mid-80s from The Topper. In mid-2012, Beryl came out of reprints and new strips were printed in the comic for 12 weeks by Steve Bright. Later in 2012, Beryl returned once more but this time back in reprints by Steve Bright from 2006–2007. Beryl also appeared in the 75th anniversary special of &quot;The Dandy&quot;, coming in at No. 8 by Nigel Parkinson in the style of Steve Bright.

==Personality traits==
Although Beryl is often perceived as a troublemaker similar to Dennis the Menace and Minnie the Minx, her personality changed several times. In the David Law strips, she is quite mischievous but also fun-loving and rather clumsy, whereas she became a more malicious character after John Dallas took over. However, after Robert Nixon took over, she became a much less menacing character, while the stories in the Karl Dixon era largely focused on the relationship between Beryl and her Dad. In the Karl Dixon stories, she shows little respect to her father, often referring to him as &#x27;Beak-Boy&#x27; due to his abnormally large nose.

<doc id="497351" wikidata="Q2353357" url="?curid=497351" title="M-60 (Michigan highway)">
<text>M-60 is an east–west state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan. It runs from the Niles area at a junction with US Highway 12 (US 12) to the Jackson area where it ends at Interstate 94 (I-94). The trunkline passes through a mix of farm fields and woodlands, crosses or runs along several rivers and connects several small towns of the southern area of the state. The westernmost segment runs along divided highway while the easternmost section is a full freeway bypass of Jackson.

M-60 was originally designed in 1919 with the rest of the state highway system in Michigan. It ran roughly along its current route connecting downtown Niles to downtown Jackson. In the mid-1920s, the western end was extended to New Buffalo; since then several bypasses of the smaller towns along the highway were added. One of these bypasses resulted in the creation of an alternate route (Alternate M-60, Alt. M-60) through Concord; that route has since been decommissioned. When Niles was bypassed in the 1950s, a business loop (Business M-60, Bus. M-60) was created through town. After the western end was truncated to its current location, that business loop was converted to a business spur.

==Route description==

M-60 starts at an interchange along US 12 southeast of Niles in southwestern Cass County. From this interchange, the highway runs northeasterly along the divided highway on Detroit Road to an intersection with Bus. M-60 (Yankee Road). There, the main highway turns due east along the shore of Barron Lake. The trunkline continues through mixed farm fields and woodlands, running northeastward to Cassopolis and rounding Stone Lake on the southern approach to town. M-60 runs north–south through town on Broadway Street, merging with M-62 to run concurrently into downtown Cassopolis. M-60 turns eastward on State Street, separating from M-62, and leaves town while crossing a line of the Canadian National Railway.

East of Cassopolis, M-60 runs past Diamond Lake and through farm fields. At Vandalia, the highway passes Donnell Lake before meeting M-40 north of Bair Lake in Jones. East of Jones, the trunkline crosses into St. Joseph County and meets US 131 on the south side of Three Rivers. The two highways run concurrently northward through a retail business corridor to an intersection with Michigan Avenue. M-60 turns east along Michigan Avenue following Bus. US 131 into downtown. The business loop turns north at the same intersection where M-60 meets M-86 near the Rocky River crossing. Continuing eastward, M-60 passes the high school and Three Rivers Municipal Dr. Haines Airport while running along the St. Joseph River. The trunkline turns north, runs by Fishers Lake and continues out of town through farm fields. Near Mendon, the highway runs along the river again. East of town, M-60 meets M-66, and the two run east and northeast through Leonidas into the extreme northwest corner of Branch County.

South of Athens, M-66 turns northward and M-60 continues around Union City and into southern Calhoun County. The road runs through Burlington on Leroy Street. At Marshall Street. M-60 meets the southern end of M-311 which runs north to the Battle Creek area. M-60 continues east through farm fields to Tekonsha where it meets Interstate 69 (I-69) northwest of town. Continuing to Homer, the highway runs along Lehigh Street in town; M-99 merges into M-60 after the intersection with Hillsdale Street. East of town, the highway widens into a four-lane divided highway; M-99 turns north along this short section of roadway and M-60 reverts to a two-lane highway again. The trunkline crosses the Kalamazoo River at Concord before it crosses into Jackson County. At Spring Arbor, M-60 passes the campus of Spring Arbor University. Outside of Jackson, the highway widens out to a full freeway bypass around the west side of the city. This bypass has one interchange with Michigan Avenue near Jackson County Airport. North of this interchange, the highway picks up the Business Loop I-94 and crosses the Norfolk Southern Railway line in the area. The freeway ends at a trumpet interchange with I-94 northwest of Jackson.

M-60 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like other state highways. Among these responsibilities, the department tracks the level of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. This is expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic (AADT), which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. According to MDOT&#x27;s surveys in 2009, the highest traffic counts were 12,547 cars and 999 trucks along the freeway immediately south of I-94 near Jackson; the lowest AADT was the 2601 cars and 384 trucks west of Union City. Only two sections of M-60 have been listed on the National Highway System (NHS): along the US 131 concurrency in Three Rivers and on the BL I-94 concurrency near Jackson. The NHS is a network of roads important to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility.

==History==
M-60 was designated with the rest of the original state highway system by July 1, 1919, on a series of roads running between Niles and Jackson by way of Cassopolis, Three Rivers and Tekonsha. By the end of 1927, the western end was extended to terminate at US 12 at New Buffalo. In the early to mid-1930s, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) realigned the New Buffalo–Niles section to bypass Galien and Buchanan, and the department extended US 112 concurrently along M-60 to New Buffalo. M-60 was rerouted around Concord in 1933, Tekonsha was bypassed by the MSHD in late 1936, and the highway was routed around Union City in 1937. The MSHD continued to improve the highway through the end of the 1930s. The last segment between Tekonsha and Homer was paved in 1940, making all of M-60 a hard-surfaced roadway.

In late 1949 or early 1950, the MSHD shifted M-60 through the Jones area to straighten the roadway. The US 131 bypass of Three Rivers opened in 1953; the US 131/M-60 concurrency became a Bus. US 131/M-60 concurrency through town as a result. On December 1, 1956, the highway department opened the first of a new four-lane divided highway around the south side of Niles, with the final of the bypass opening early the next year. Consequently, they converted the former route through town into a business loop. Bus. M-60 connected the bypass into downtown where it continued along Bus. US 112 back to US 112/M-60. At the end of the 1950s, M-60 was moved to a freeway bypass along the west side of Jackson; the final mile was also designated Bus. US 12 as both highways connected to the I-94/US 12 freeway north of the city. The western end was redesignated as a part of US 12 in the late 1961, and the M-60 designation was truncated off this roadway in 1966. M-60&#x27;s routing has remained unchanged since.
==Major intersections==






==Special routes==
There have been two different special routes of M-60. Business M-60 (Bus. M-60) in Niles is still in existence, while Alternate M-60 (Alt. M-60) in Concord has been decommissioned.

===Business M-60===

Business M-60 (Bus. M-60) is a state business spur running through the city of Niles and adjacent townships. The spur starts at the intersection with M-51 (Main Street, 11th Street) and runs eastward along a former routing of M-60 on Oak Street through a residential section of town. Near the Berrien–Cass county line, the highway passes south of the Jerry Tyler Memorial Airport. East of the airport, the street name changes from Oak Street to Yankee Road, and Bus. M-60 runs to its terminus at M-60 (Detroit Road). The total length is , and 5,284–7,984 cars and 333 trucks use the route each day.

The business route was a loop route, continuing through downtown along Bus. US 112 when the designation was created in late 1956 or early 1957. M-60 was truncated west of Niles in 1966; at the same time, Bus. M-60 was truncated at its junction with Bus. US 12/M-51 near downtown.
===Alternate M-60===
Alternate M-60 (Alt. M-60) was an alternate loop route running through Concord. It acted as a &quot;business route&quot; into downtown Concord during its short lifetime after a bypass of town along M-60 was built. Its appearance predated the development of business routes in Michigan. Concord was bypassed in 1933, resulting in the creation of the alternate route. That route was turned over to local control the next year, decommissioning the designation.

<text>Vladimir Akopian (, ; born December 7, 1971) is an Armenian-American chess Grandmaster.

==Career==

Akopian was born in Baku, Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, Soviet Union. He won the World Under-16 Championship in 1986 at the age of 14 and the World Under-18 Championship at 16. In 1991, he won the World Junior Chess Championship.

He won the Armenian Chess Championship in 1996 and 1997. In 1999 he made his way through to the final of the FIDE knockout World Chess Championship, but lost to Alexander Khalifman by 3.5-2.5.

At the Russia vs the Rest of the World 2002, Akopian defeated FIDE #1 ranked Garry Kasparov in 25 moves in the final eighth round.

Akopian defeated World Champion Vladimir Kramnik in the first round of the Corus chess tournament 2004 and was in the lead for the beginning of the tournament. He finished the contest in tenth place.

He made it to the quarterfinals in the FIDE World Chess Championship 2004, where he lost to eventual tournament runner-up Michael Adams.

In 2005, he tied for 1st–5th with Emil Sutovsky, Andrei Kharlov, Vassily Ivanchuk and Alexander Motylev at the Aeroflot Open in Moscow. Akopian had a score of 6.5 at the Aeroflot Open 2005 and took part in a five-way tie. After the tiebreaker, he came in fifth.

It was reported that Akopian had to withdraw from the 2005 Dubai Open when he was arrested at Dubai airport, having been mistaken for an individual of the same name wanted by Interpol for murder.

Early in 2007, Akopian won the Gibtelecom Masters in Gibraltar with a score of 7.5/9 ahead of a group of players tied at 7/9 including Michael Adams.

Akopian came in third place at the Fourth FIDE Grand Prix in April 2009 with a score of 7.5/13, one point behind compatriot Levon Aronian. He lost to Peter Leko, who had the same score, in a tiebreaker.

In December 2009, he was awarded the title of &quot;Honoured Master of Sport of the Republic of Armenia&quot;.

On the May 2013 FIDE list, he has an Elo rating of 2705, making him number 39 in the world and Armenia&#x27;s number two player, behind Levon Aronian.

In 2021, Akopian switched federations to represent the United States of America.

==Team competitions==
The Armenia national chess team made its Chess Olympiad debut at the 30th Chess Olympiad in 1992 and won bronze. Akopian played on board two for the Olympiad, behind Rafael Vaganian.

Akopian was one of the contributing players on the Armenian chess team which won gold at the 2006 Chess Olympiad ahead of second placed China and third placed United States. Akopian played on board two for the Olympiad.

Akopian won the 38th Chess Olympiad in Dresden (2008) with the Armenia national Chess team, winning gold for the second time in a row at a Chess Olympiad. Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan attended the Olympiad to support the team. After the Olympiad, they flew back to Armenia with him on the presidential plane, Air Force Armenia One.

Armenia and Akopian regained their Olympiad title at the 40th Chess Olympiad (2012). This was the third time Armenia won gold at the Olympiad. Akopian played on board two at the previous two and board three for the latest. As the players were awarded their gold medals, the Armenian national anthem &quot;Mer Hayrenik&quot; was played and the Armenian flag was raised in Istanbul. Levon Aronian was holding an Armenian flag up as he and his team were standing on the first place podium. Upon returning to Yerevan, the players were welcomed back with a ceremony by many people in the city the moment their airplane touched down in Zvartnots Airport.

Akopian revealed after the 40th Olympiad that he is unsure if he will ever compete at the Chess Olympiads again.

He was a member of the gold medal-winning Armenian team at the World Team Chess Championship in 2011. It was the first time that the Armenian team won this tournament. Akopian played on board three.

<doc id="497367" wikidata="Q190271" url="?curid=497367" title="Prague Metro">
<text>The Prague Metro () is the rapid transit network of Prague, Czech Republic. Founded in 1974, the system consists of three lines (A, B and C) serving 61 stations (predominantly with island platforms), and is long. The system served 568 million passengers in 2021 (about 1.55 million daily).

Two types of rolling stock are used on the Metro: the 81-71M (a completely modernized variant of the original 81-717/714.1), and the Metro M1. All the lines are controlled automatically from the central dispatching, near I.P. Pavlova station. The Metro is operated by the Prague Public Transit Company (, DPP), and integrated in the Prague Integrated Transport (&quot;Pražská integrovaná doprava&quot;, PID) system.

==Basic information==
The Prague Metro has three lines and one &quot;Line D&quot; under construction, each represented by its own colour on the maps and signs: Line A (green, 17 stations, ), Line B (yellow, 24 stations, ) and Line C (red, 20 stations, ). There are 58 stations in total (three of which are transfer stations) connected by nearly 66 kilometres of mostly underground railways. Service operates from 4–5 am until midnight, with two- to three-minute intervals between trains during rush hours and four to ten minutes between trains at other times. Nearly 600 million passengers use the Prague Metro every year (about 1.6 million daily).

The system is run by the Prague Public Transit Company Co. Inc. (Czech: &quot;&quot;, DPP), which also manages the other means of public transport around the city, including the trams, buses, five ferries, the funicular to Petřín Hill, and the chairlift inside the Prague Zoo.

Since 1993, the system has been connected to commuter trains and buses, and also to &quot;park-and-ride&quot; parking lots. Together, they form an extensive public transportation network reaching further from the city, called Prague Integrated Transport (Czech: &quot;Pražská integrovaná doprava&quot;, PID). Whilst the large system is zonally priced, the Metro is entirely inside the central zone.

Many stations are quite large, with several entrances spaced relatively far apart. This can often lead to confusion for those unfamiliar with the system, especially at the central hubs such as Můstek or Muzeum. In general the stations are well signposted even for those unfamiliar with the Czech language.

==System layout and stations==


The Prague Metro system is radial, with each line running through the city centre from termini in the outskirts; however, the lines do not meet at a single central station. Rather, the three lines form a triangle in the centre of the city, with three interchange stations at the vertices of the triangle: Florenc, Můstek, and Muzeum. Each interchange station has two halls, one hall for each line. 

The depth of the stations (and the connecting lines) varies considerably. The deepest station is Náměstí Míru, located under the ground. Parts of the tracks in the city centre were mostly bored using a tunnelling shield. Outer parts were dug by a cut-and-cover method, and these stations are only a few metres under the surface. Part of Line B runs in a glassed-in tunnel above the ground.

Most stations have a single island platform in the centre of the station hall (tunnel) serving both directions. The sub-surface stations have a straight ceiling sometimes supported by columns, while the deep-level stations are larger tunnels with the track tunnels on each side. The walls of many stations are decorated using coloured aluminium panels; each station has its own colour. Some stations are considered among the finest in Europe.

==Rolling stock==

===Metro M1===
Metro M1 trains have operated on Line C since 2000; they completely replaced older cars on this line in 2003. DPP owns 265 of these cars, which form 53 five-car trains. These cars were developed specially for Prague, and were manufactured there between 2000 and 2003 by a consortium consisting of ČKD Praha, ADtranz and Siemens (during the contract, Siemens acquired ČKD Praha). The total length of the train is , the acceleration is , and the total capacity of the train is 1,464 people (224 sitting, 1,240 standing). This unit was also adapted for use in Venezuela on the Maracaibo Metro.

===81-71M===
81-71M trains are a modernized variant of the old Soviet 81-717 trains with new traction motors, technical equipment, interiors, and exteriors. They have operated on Lines A and B since 1996. The modernization was conducted by Škoda Transportation and ČKD between 1996 and 2011. DPP owns 465 81-71M cars, which form 93 five-car trains. The total length of the train is , and the acceleration is identical to that of the Metro M1 cars, at . Similar reconstructions were also made on the Tbilisi Metro and Yerevan Metro, as well as a near-identical version exported to Kyiv from Metrowagonmash as part of the Slavutich project, designated 81-553.1, 81–554.1 and 81-555.1.

===Previously in service===

* 81-71, old Soviet trains manufactured by Metrovagonmash were gradually phased out and replaced by the modernized versions. Their service ended on 2 July 2009. One vehicle is stored in the Museum of Prague public transport, while one fully-operational train of five cars stays in the Zličín (B) depot for special occasions.
* Ečs, Soviet trains manufactured by Metrovagonmash, that ran on Line C, in service from 1974 to 1997. One vehicle is also stored in the Museum of Prague public transport, while one fully-operational train of three cars is stored in the Zličín (B) depot.

==History==

Although the Prague Metro system is relatively new, the idea of underground transport in Prague dates back many years. The first proposal to build a sub-surface railway was made by Ladislav Rott in 1898. He encouraged the city council to take advantage of the fact that parts of the central city were already being dug up for sewer work. Rott wanted them to start digging tunnels for the railway at the same time. However, the plan was denied by the city authorities. Another proposal in 1926, by Bohumil Belada and Vladimír List, was the first to use the term &quot;Metro&quot;, and though it was not accepted either, it served as an impulse for moving towards a real solution of the rapidly developing transport in Prague.

In the 1930s and 1940s, intensive projection and planning works took place, taking into account two possible solutions: an underground tramway (regular rolling stock going underground in the city center, nowadays described as a &quot;premetro&quot;, &quot;Stadtbahn&quot; or &quot;subway-surface&quot;) and a &quot;true&quot; metro having its own independent system of railways. After World War II, all work was stopped due to the poor economic situation of the country, although the three lines, A, B and C, had been almost fully designed.

In the early 1960s the concept of the sub-surface tramway was finally accepted and on 9 August 1967 the building of the first station (Hlavní nádraží) started. However, in the same year, a substantial change in the concept came, as the government, under the influence of Soviet advisers, decided to build a true metro system instead of an underground tramway. Thus, during the first years, the construction continued while the whole project was conceptually transformed. During the construction of the metro, a Czech rolling stock manufacturer, ČKD Tatra Smíchov, was charged with designing the trains. Two prototype two-car units under the name R1 were constructed in 1970 and 1971 and were used for field testing. However, the then-Czechoslovakian government decided instead to order the trains for the underground from the Soviet Union (which would soon become Ečs, part of the Soviet &quot;E&quot; series, standing for &quot;E Czechoslovak&quot;). The R1 rolling stock would later be scrapped in the 1980s, near the end of the Cold War. Regular service on the first section of Line C began on 9 May 1974 between Sokolovská (now Florenc) and Kačerov stations.

Since then, many extensions have been built and the number of lines has risen to three.

On 22 February 1990, 13 station names reflecting mostly communist ideology were changed to be politically neutral. For example, Leninova station, which contained a giant bust of Vladimir Lenin before the Velvet Revolution, was renamed Dejvická after a nearby street and surrounding neighbourhood. Other changes were: Dukelská – Nové Butovice, Švermova – Jinonice, Moskevská – Anděl, Sokolovská – Florenc, Fučíkova – Nádraží Holešovice, Gottwaldova – Vyšehrad, Mládežnická – Pankrác, Primátora Vacka – Roztyly, Budovatelů – Chodov, Družby – Opatov, Kosmonautů – Háje.

In August 2002, the system suffered disastrous flooding that struck parts of Bohemia and other areas in Central Europe (see 2002 European flood). 19 stations were flooded, causing a partial collapse of the transport system in Prague; the damage to the Metro has been estimated at approximately 7 billion CZK (over US$225 million in exchange rate at that time). The affected sections of the Metro stayed out of service for several months; the last station (Křižíkova, located in the most-damaged area – Karlín) reopened in March 2003. Small gold plates have been placed at some stations to show the highest water level of the flood.
Service was suspended between:
* Radlická and Kolbenova on Line B
* Malostranská and Náměstí Míru on Line A
* Hlavní nádraží and Nádraží Holešovice on Line C (before the extension to Ládví in 2004 and to Letňany in 2008)

A number of stations were closed due to flooding in June 2013. Replacement trams ran between Dejvická and Muzeum on Line A and Českomoravská and Smíchovské nádraží on Line B, and replacement buses between Kobylisy and Muzeum on Line C due to closed sections of the track.

==Extensions==

After regular service on the first section of Line C began in 1974 between Florenc and Kačerov, building of extensions continued quite rapidly. In 1978, Line A was opened, and Line B opened in 1985, thus forming the triangle with three crossing points. Since then, the lines have been extended outwards from the center.

In 1980 and 1990, Line A was extended eastward from Náměstí Míru to Želivského and Skalka. Line B was extended from Nové Butovice to Zličín in 1994 and from Českomoravská to Černý Most in 1998, and the Kolbenova and Hloubětín stations were opened in 2001. Expansion of Line C was carried out in 1980 (Kačerov – Háje) and 1984 (Florenc – Nádraží Holešovice).

A northern extension of Line C was opened on 26 June 2004, with two more stations, Kobylisy and Ládví. New tunnels were built under the Vltava river using a unique &quot;ejecting-tunnels&quot; technology. First, a trench was excavated in the riverbed and the concrete tunnels constructed in dry docks on the riverbank. Then the docks were flooded, and the floating tunnels were moved as a rigid complex to their final position, sunk, anchored, and covered.

Line A was extended to the east on 26 May 2006, when a new terminus, Depo Hostivař, opened. The station was constructed within the railway depot.

Line C was extended to the northeast to connect the city center to the housing blocks at Prosek and a large shopping center at Letňany. Three stations (Střížkov, Prosek, and Letňany) opened on 8 May 2008.

In April 2015, Line A was extended westward from Dejvická to Nemocnice Motol with four new stations: Bořislavka, Nádraží Veleslavín, Petřiny, and Nemocnice Motol. The Nádraží Veleslavín station is also the new terminus of the 119 bus to Václav Havel Airport.

Plans for an extension to the airport have been proposed, but never put into action. According to estimates from 2018 the project would cost about 26.8 billion crowns and take 11 years to complete.

==Future plans==
Another phase of the extension of Line A was planned from Nemocnice Motol to the Václav Havel Airport, but it is very likely that this extension will not be built and the airport will be serviced by a new railway instead.

===Line D===

There are plans to build a new line, Line D (blue), which will connect the city centre to southern parts of the city. According to current plans, the line will run for 11 kilometers and start in the city center and lead to Vršovice, Krč, Libuš, and Písnice. There will be 10 stations: Náměstí Míru (transfer to Line A), Náměstí bratří Synků, Pankrác (transfer to Line C), Olbrachtova, Nádraží Krč, Nemocnice Krč, Nové Dvory, Libuš, Písnice and Depo Písnice. Line D is very important for improving the traffic situation in the southern and southeastern part of the city. In the second stage it is planned to extend this line from Pankrác to Náměstí Míru (Peace Square). The first part of Line D is planned to be built between 2022 and 2029.

=== Line E ===
There are also plans for Line E, which will probably be circular. The exact route has not yet been determined. In the beginning of the 21st century, there were discussions regarding it in the connection with plans to organise the Summer Olympic Games in Prague, which were however canceled. The &quot;Praha sobě&quot; list endorsed the idea of a circular metro line during the run-up to the 2022 Prague municipal election.

==Features==
The name of the Můstek station means &quot;little bridge&quot; and refers to the area around the station. The origin of the area&#x27;s name was not known until remains of a medieval bridge were discovered during construction of the station. The remains were incorporated into the station and can be seen near the northwestern exit of the station.

The escalators at Náměstí Míru (Peace Square) station in Vinohrady are the longest escalators in the European Union (length 87 m, vertical span 43.5 m, 533 steps, taking 2 minutes and 15 seconds to ascend). Náměstí Míru is also the deepest station in the European Union, at 53 metres.

Between I. P. Pavlova and Vyšehrad stations, Line C runs inside the box structure of the large Nusle Bridge over a steep valley.

The terminal station Depo Hostivař was constructed within the buildings of an existing railway depot. The extension is the first segment of the system to be built above ground and not through a tunnel. There are no reversing tracks in the terminus; trains depart from the same track on which they arrive.

Anděl station was known as Moskevská (Moscow station) until 1990. It opened on the same day in 1985 as the Prazhskaya (Prague) station on the Moscow Metro. It contains several pieces of art promoting Soviet-Czechoslovak friendship. Anděl station, like the Smíchov train station, contains some of the best-preserved examples of Communist-era art remaining in Prague. Works were carried out from 2014-15 to make the station accessible for wheelchair users.

The entrance hall of the Hradčanská station still features the coat of arms of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and the motto &quot;Všechna moc v Československé socialistické republice patří pracujícímu lidu&quot; (&quot;All the power in the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic belongs to the working people&quot;), which were parts of the station&#x27;s original socialist-realist design.

During the communist period, rumours circulated that large &quot;survival chambers&quot; were being built for high officials of the government in case of a nuclear attack. After the fall of communism such areas were shown indeed to exist, but not on the scale envisioned nor fitted out in luxury.

==Tickets==

The Prague Metro operates on a proof-of-payment system, as does the rest of the PID network. Passengers must buy and validate a ticket before entering a station&#x27;s paid area. There are uniformed and plainclothes fare inspectors who randomly check passengers&#x27; tickets within the paid area.

Basic single tickets cost 40 CZK (as of 1 August 2021) for a 90-minute ride or 30 CZK for a 30-minute ride. In November 2007 SMS purchase for basic single transfer tickets and day tickets was introduced (available only from Czech mobile phones).

Short-term tourist passes are available for periods of 24 hours (120 CZK) and 3 days (330 CZK). As of 2019, single tickets and short term passes can be purchased online using the PID Lítačka smartphone app. Since April 2019 single and 24hour tickets can be also bought on board of every tram and in all metro stations, using contactless payment, including payment apps like Google Pay or Apple Pay. Such tickets are already validated from the time of purchase.

Longer-term season tickets can be bought on the smart ticketing system Lítačka card, for periods of one month (550 CZK), three months (1480 CZK) or the annual pass for 3650 CZK (10 CZK/day). Students studying in the Czech republic with a valid student license ISIC, children under 18 years old, and seniors over 60 years of age can buy season tickets at reduced prices. Reduced ticket prices are: 130 CZK for 30 days, 360 CZK for 90 days, and 1280 CZK for a year.

Senior citizens aged 65 or older and children up to 14 years old can ride for free.

The tickets are the same for all means of transport in Prague (metro, trams, buses, funiculars and ferries).

==Announcements==

The announcement made through the public address system when the doors are closing, &quot;Ukončete, prosím, výstup a nástup, dveře se zavírají&quot; (&quot;Please finish exiting and boarding, the doors are closing&quot;) has become a symbol of Prague for many tourists, and is possibly the first clear Czech phrase many travelers hear. The announcement has changed little since 1974, when the first line was opened; the original version did not include the word &quot;please&quot;. The announcements are voiced by on Line A, by on Line B, and by on Line C.

Other announcements include: &quot;Vystupujte vpravo ve směru jízdy&quot; (&quot;Exit on the right side in the direction of travel&quot;), &quot;Konečná stanice, prosíme, vystupte&quot; (&quot;Terminal station, please exit the train&quot;), and &quot;Přestup na linky S a další vlakové spoje&quot; (&quot;Transfer to S lines and other railway connections&quot;).

<text>Matthias &quot;Matt&quot; Frei (born 26 November 1963) is a British-German television news journalist and writer, formerly the Washington, D.C. correspondent for &quot;Channel 4 News&quot;. he is the channel&#x27;s Europe editor and a presenter of the main &quot;Channel 4 News&quot; at 7pm.

==Personal life==
Frei was born in 1963 in Essen, West Germany, his parents having settled there after leaving Silesia before it became part of Poland. In 1973 the family moved to the United Kingdom, where Frei&#x27;s father became a London correspondent for radio broadcaster Deutschlandfunk.

Frei was educated at Westminster School, then read history and Spanish at St Peter&#x27;s College, University of Oxford, graduating in 1986.

Frei lives in Wandsworth, London with his wife Penny and their four children. He is a member of the Garrick Club.

==Career==

===BBC===
Frei joined the BBC and spent a year in the German section of the World Service, before he moved to English language current affairs, where he worked for another year.

In 1989, working as a stringer, he reported on the First Intifada in Jerusalem, then on the Persian Gulf War as London foreign affairs correspondent. He took up the post of Bonn correspondent in Germany on the same day as the fall of the Berlin Wall.

In 1990, Frei took a holiday in Zimbabwe and persuaded aid worker friend Katty Kay to become a journalist.

From 1992 to 1996, he worked as a Southern Europe correspondent, based in Rome, and covered events in Bosnia, Kosovo, North Africa and various Mafia-related stories.

After working as a Southern Europe correspondent, he worked as an Asia correspondent from 1997 to 2003, based in Hong Kong (taking up his post just before the handover to China) and later in Singapore.

From 2002, he was the BBC&#x27;s Washington, DC correspondent. In 2005, Frei reported from the centre of New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. On 1 October 2007, Frei became the first presenter of the BBC World News one-hour Washington-based news broadcast, &quot;BBC World News America&quot;, supported by correspondent Katty Kay.

For a week in July 2008, Frei presented the London-based &quot;BBC News at Six&quot; on a relief basis. A year later on 27 July 2009, Frei returned to London again to present the evening bulletin (again as a relief presenter). In January 2011, Frei presented the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; as a relief presenter.

Frei presented his own BBC documentary on the life and times of the German capital, Berlin. It ran from 14 November 2009.

As part of his brief as the BBC&#x27;s Washington correspondent, Frei presented a weekly Radio 4 programme titled &quot;Americana&quot;, which offers listeners slices of life in all of the country&#x27;s 50 states, and political news from Washington. Frei&#x27;s last &quot;Americana&quot; episode was broadcast in May 2011.

===Channel 4===
It was announced in May 2011 that Frei would be switching from the BBC to Channel 4 later in the year. Frei would serve as the broadcaster&#x27;s Washington correspondent for &quot;Channel 4 News&quot;, as well as reporting for the channel&#x27;s other news programmes. He has since returned often from Washington and has become a semi-regular presenter on Channel 4&#x27;s evening news slot.

In October 2012, Frei headed Channel 4&#x27;s coverage of the US presidential election, including making documentary &quot;The American Road Trip: Obama&#x27;s story&quot;, in which he visited middle-class voters in communities in the mid-west, including Minneapolis, Northwood, Ohio and Gary, Indiana.

===LBC===

On 24 September 2016, he started presenting the 10:00 am show, occasional Saturdays on LBC radio. In the prelude to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine Frei reported from Kyiv, Ukraine.

<doc id="497373" wikidata="Q1647023" url="?curid=497373" title="Scotties Tournament of Hearts">
<text>The Scotties Tournament of Hearts (&#x27;; commonly referred to asthe Scotties) is the annual Canadian women&#x27;s curling championship, sanctioned by Curling Canada, formerly called the Canadian Curling Association. The winner goes on to represent Canada at the women&#x27;s world curling championships. Since 1985, the winner also gets to return to the following year&#x27;s tournament as &quot;Team Canada&quot;. It is formally known as the &quot;Canadian Women&#x27;s Curling Championship&quot;.

Since 1982, the tournament has been sponsored by Kruger Products, which was formerly known as Scott Paper Limited when it was a Canadian subsidiary of Scott Paper Company, therefore, the tournament was formerly known as the Scott Tournament of Hearts. When Kimberly-Clark merged with Scott, the Canadian arm was sold to the Quebec-based Kruger Inc. – while Kruger was granted a licence to use several Scott brands in Canada until June 2007, it was given a long-term licence to the Scotties brand because Kimberly-Clark already owned Kleenex. As such, the tournament was officially renamed the Scotties Tournament of Hearts in 2007.

Until 2018, the format was a round robin of 12 teams. Starting with the 2015 Scotties Tournament of Hearts there have been more than twelve eligible teams; therefore a pre-qualification tournament was held to trim the field to twelve. In 2021, a new 18-team format was introduced, in which all 14 member associations of Curling Canada field a team in a main draw of two pools, alongside the defending champions, and the three highest-ranked teams on the Canadian Team Ranking System standings that did not win their provincial championships. The teams are separated into two pools of nine, each playing a round-robin within their pool, with the top three teams in each pool advancing to a second round to determine the final four teams.

At the end of the second round, playoffs occur to determine the championship winner. The system used is known as the Page playoff system.

==History==
===Pre-history===
1913 marked a significant point in women&#x27;s curling when both the Manitoba Bonspiel and the Ontario Curling Association began holding women&#x27;s curling events. Other provinces would later add provincial women&#x27;s championships, but it wasn&#x27;t until the 1950s that a higher level of women&#x27;s curling began to occur. At this time there was a Western Canada Women&#x27;s Curling Championship (sponsored by the T. Eaton Company) but no tournament existed for the eastern provinces. By 1959, Eaton&#x27;s pulled their sponsorship, giving the organizers of the Western championships an initiative to have a national championship.

In 1960, the Canadian Ladies&#x27; Curling Association was created with Dominion Stores Ltd. seeking to sponsor a national championship. That year, an eastern championship occurred so that the winner could play the winner of the western championship in an invitational event. In this event, Ruth Smith and her team from Lacolle, Quebec faced off against Joyce McKee&#x27;s team from Saskatchewan (consisting of Sylvia Fedoruk, Donna Belding and Muriel Coben) with McKee winning the best-of-three series two games to none. The games between the two teams were played in Oshawa, Ontario. 

The following year a tournament was organized with the same format as the Brier and was held in Ottawa. McKee won again, with a new front end of Barbara MacNevin and Rosa McFee.

===Early history===
In 1967, Dominion Stores were unable to reach a compromise with the organizers of the tournament, and their sponsorship fell. The Canadian Ladies&#x27; Curling Association ran the tournament by themselves with no main sponsor.

Sylvia Fedoruk, after assuming the presidency of the Canadian Ladies&#x27; Curling Association found a title sponsor in the Macdonald Tobacco Company, the same sponsor as the Brier. Their sponsorship began in 1972 with the tournament being called the &quot;Macdonald Lassie&quot; championship, after the company&#x27;s trademark.

In 1979, under increasing pressure from the anti-tobacco policies of the Canadian Government, the Macdonald Tobacco Company pulled their sponsorship from both the Brier and the Women&#x27;s championship. The Canadian Ladies&#x27; Curling Association ran the tournament without a main sponsor again for the next couple of years. 1979 also marked the first year of the Women&#x27;s World Curling Championship, where the national champion would play. Also, the 1979 event was the first tournament to feature a playoff. Before then, the championship team was the one with the best round robin record.

===Tournament of Hearts===
Robin Wilson, a member of the 1979 championship team, and a former employee of Scott Paper led an effort to get the company to sponsor the championships. It was successful, and in 1982 the first Scott Tournament of Hearts was held.

The Scott Tournament of Hearts would last 25 years, and saw the likes of many great teams. The first Tournament of Hearts was won by Colleen Jones and her Nova Scotia team. It would take her 17 years to win another, but she would cap it off with another four championships for a grand total of six championships. In 2018, Colleen Jones&#x27; feat of six championships was equaled by Manitoba&#x27;s Jennifer Jones. Other great curlers at the Hearts have been Kerri Einarson and Connie Laliberte of Manitoba, Heather Houston, Marilyn Bodogh and Rachel Homan of Ontario, Vera Pezer and Sandra Schmirler of Saskatchewan, Cathy Borst, Shannon Kleibrink and Chelsea Carey of Alberta and Lindsay Sparkes and Kelly Scott of British Columbia.

The new sponsorship made the tournament popular when it began to be televised. Today, TSN covers the entire tournament. CBC had covered the semi-finals and the finals up until the 2007–08 season. In 2013, Sportsnet and Citytv began to offer coverage of the finals of the provincial playdowns in Manitoba, Ontario, and Alberta as well.

As a Tournament of Hearts tradition, the members of the winning team receive gold rings in the four-heart design of the Tournament of Hearts logo, set with a .25-carat diamond. The runners-up receive the same rings, with rubies instead of diamonds, and the third-place team receives gold rings set with emeralds.

Starting with the 2024 tournament, the first all-star team was entitled the Robin Wilson First All-Star Team.

In 2025, Scotties ceased their sponsorship of the provincial playdowns and stopped awarding jewellery to participants, but continued to award jewellery for teams that reach the podium. At the same time, Red Rose Tea began its status as a &quot;prestige sponsor&quot; of the event.

<text>Throughout history, various groups of people have considered themselves to be the chosen people of a deity, for a particular purpose. The phenomenon of &quot;chosen people&quot; is well known among the Israelites and Jews, where the term () originally referred to the Israelites as being selected by Yahweh to worship only him and to fulfill the mission of proclaiming his truth throughout the world. Some claims of chosenness are based on parallel claims of Israelite ancestry, as is the case for the Christian Identity and Black Hebrew sects—both which claim themselves (and not Jews) to be the &quot;true Israel&quot;. Others claim that the concept is spiritual, where individuals who genuinely believe in God are considered to be the &quot;true&quot; chosen people. This view is common among most Christian denominations, who historically believed that the church replaced Israel as the people of God.

Anthropologists commonly regard claims of chosenness as a form of ethnocentrism.

==Judaism==

In Judaism, &quot;chosenness&quot; is the belief that the Jews, via descent from the ancient Israelites, are the chosen people, i.e., chosen to be in a covenant with God. The idea of the Israelites being chosen by God is found most directly in the Book of Deuteronomy, where it is applied to Israel at Mount Sinai upon the condition of their acceptance of the Mosaic covenant between themselves and God. The decalogue immediately follows, and the seventh day sabbath is given as the sign of the covenant, with a requirement that Israel keep it, or else be cut off. The verb &#x27; (), and is alluded to elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible using other terms such as &quot;holy people&quot;. Much is written about these topics in rabbinic literature. The three largest Jewish denominations—Orthodox Judaism, Conservative Judaism and Reform Judaism—maintain the belief that the Jews have been chosen by God for a purpose. Sometimes this choice is seen as charging the Jewish people with a specific mission—to be a light unto the nations, and to exemplify the covenant with God as described in the Torah. This is first prominently outlined in Genesis 12:2.

While the concept of &quot;choseness&quot; may be understood by some to connote ethnic supremacy, Conservative Judaism denies this, as it claims that as a result of being chosen, Jews also bear the greatest responsibility, which incurs the most severe punishment upon disobedience. &quot;Few beliefs have been subject to as much misunderstanding as the &#x27;Chosen People&#x27; doctrine. The Torah and the Prophets clearly stated that this does not imply any innate Jewish superiority. In the words of Amos (3:2) &#x27;You alone have I singled out of all the families of the earth—that is why I will call you to account for your iniquities.&#x27; The Torah tells us that we are to be &quot;a kingdom of priests and a holy nation&quot; with obligations and duties which flowed from our willingness to accept this status. Far from being a license for special privilege, it entailed additional responsibilities not only toward God but to our fellow human beings. As expressed in the blessing at the reading of the Torah, our people have always felt it to be a privilege to be selected for such a purpose. For the modern traditional Jew, the doctrine of the election and the covenant of Israel offers a purpose for Jewish existence which transcends its own self interests. It suggests that because of our special history and unique heritage we are in a position to demonstrate that a people that takes seriously the idea of being covenanted with God can not only thrive in the face of oppression, but can be a source of blessing to its children and its neighbors. It obligates us to build a just and compassionate society throughout the world and especially in the land of Israel where we may teach by example what it means to be a &#x27;covenant people, a light unto the nations.&#x27;&quot;Likewise, Rabbi Lord Immanuel Jakobovits views the concept of &quot;choseness&quot; as God choosing different nations, and by extension individuals, to perform unique contributions to the world, similar to the concept of division of labor. &quot;Yes, I do believe that the chosen people concept as affirmed by Judaism in its holy writ, its prayers, and its millennial tradition. In fact, I believe that every people—and indeed, in a more limited way, every individual—is &quot;chosen&quot; or destined for some distinct purpose in advancing the designs of Providence. Only, some fulfill their mission and others do not. Maybe the Greeks were chosen for their unique contributions to art and philosophy, the Romans for their pioneering services in law and government, the British for bringing parliamentary rule into the world, and the Americans for piloting democracy in a pluralistic society. The Jews were chosen by God to be &#x27;peculiar unto Me&#x27; as the pioneers of religion and morality; that was and is their national purpose.&quot;

==Christianity and derivatives==
===Seventh-day Adventism===
===Mormonism===

In Mormonism, all Latter Day Saints are viewed as covenant, or chosen, people because they have accepted the name of Jesus Christ through the ordinance of baptism. In contrast to supersessionism, Latter Day Saints do not dispute the &quot;chosen&quot; status of the Jewish people. Most practicing Mormons receive a patriarchal blessing that reveals their lineage in the House of Israel. This lineage may be blood related or through &quot;adoption;&quot; therefore, a child may not necessarily share the lineage of her parents (but will still be a member of the tribes of Israel). It is a widely held belief that most members of the faith are in the tribe of Ephraim or the tribe of Manasseh.

===Christian Identity===

Christian Identity is a belief which holds the view that only either Germanic, Anglo-Saxon, Celtic, Nordic, or Aryan people and those of kindred blood are the descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and hence the descendants of the ancient Israelites.

Independently practiced by individuals, independent congregations, and some prison gangs, it is not an organized religion, nor is it connected with specific Christian denominations. Its theology promotes a racial interpretation of Christianity. Christian Identity beliefs were primarily developed and promoted by American authors who regarded Europeans as the &quot;chosen people&quot; and Jews as the cursed offspring of Cain, the &quot;serpent hybrid&quot; or serpent seed, a belief known as the two-seedline doctrine. White supremacist sects and gangs later adopted many of these teachings.

Christian Identity holds that all non-whites (people not of wholly European descent) will either be exterminated or enslaved in order to serve the white race in the new Heavenly Kingdom on Earth under the reign of Jesus Christ. Its doctrine states that only &quot;Adamic&quot; (white) people can achieve salvation and paradise.

==Mandaeism==
Mandaeans formally refer to themselves as &quot;Nasurai&quot; (Nasoraeans) meaning guardians or possessors of secret rites and knowledge. Another early self-appellation is &quot;bhiri zidqa&quot; meaning &#x27;elect of righteousness&#x27; or &#x27;the chosen righteous&#x27;, a term found in the Book of Enoch and Genesis Apocryphon II, 4.

==Rastafari==

Based on Jewish biblical tradition and Ethiopian legend via Kebra Nagast, Rastas believe that Israel&#x27;s King Solomon, together with Ethiopian Queen of Sheba, conceived a child which began the Solomonic line of kings in Ethiopia, rendering the Ethiopian people as the true children of Israel, and thereby chosen. Reinforcement of this belief occurred when Beta Israel, Ethiopia&#x27;s ancient Israelite First Temple community, were rescued from Sudanese famine and brought to Israel during Operation Moses in 1985.

==Unification Church==

Sun Myung Moon taught that Korea is the chosen nation, selected to serve a divine mission and was &quot;chosen by God to be the birthplace of the leading figure of the age&quot; and was the birthplace of &quot;Heavenly Tradition&quot;, ushering in God&#x27;s kingdom.

==Maasai religion==
The traditional religion of the Maasai people from East Africa maintains that the Supreme God Ngai has chosen them to herd all cattle in the world, and this belief has been used to justify stealing from other tribes.

<text>Annie Gosfield (born September 11, 1960, in Philadelphia) is a New-York-based composer who works on the boundaries between notated and improvised music, electronic and acoustic sounds, refined timbres and noise. She composes for others and performs with her own group, taking her music to festivals, factories, clubs, art spaces and concert halls. Much of her work combines acoustic instruments with electronic sounds, incorporating unusual sources such as satellite sounds, machine sounds, detuned or out-of-tune samples and industrial noises. Her work often contains improvisation and frequently uses extended techniques and/or altered musical instruments. She won a 2012 Berlin Prize.

==Work==
Gosfield&#x27;s work includes large-scale compositions, opera, orchestral work, chamber music, electronic music, video projects, and music for dance. She uses traditional notation, improvisation and extended techniques to explore relationships between music and noise. Her music is often inspired by non-musical sounds, such as machines, destroyed pianos, warped 78 rpm records, and detuned radios. She often collaborated with musicians to emphasize their unique qualities.

Gosfield&#x27;s compositions have been performed internationally by The Bang on a Can Allstars, Agon Orchestra, Joan Jeanrenaud, Fred Frith, Felix Fan, Roger Kleier, Blair McMillen, William Winant, the FLUX Quartet, the Miami String Quartet, The Silesian String Quartet, So Percussion, Talujon Percussion, Newband (on the Harry Partch instruments) and many others, at festivals including Warsaw Autumn, ISCM World Music Days, Bang on a Can Marathon, Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival, Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival, Festival Musique Actuelle, Wien Modern, OtherMinds, Spoleto Festival USA, Company Week, Taktlos, and three &quot;Radical New Jewish Culture&quot; festivals curated by John Zorn.

In November, 2017, The Los Angeles Philharmonic presented Gosfield&#x27;s first opera, an original setting of Orson Welles&#x27;s &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, adapted and directed by Yuval Sharon, simultaneously performed inside Walt Disney Concert Hall and on the streets of Los Angeles, using three repurposed air raid sirens to broadcast the music to the public in satellite performances in parking lots in Downtown Los Angeles.

Gosfield has composed a site-specific work for a factory in Germany, collaborated on installations with artist Manuel Ocampo, and created a video for an imaginary orchestra of destroyed instruments. She has worked with many choreographers, including Karole Armitage, Pam Tanowitz, and Susan Marshall. Her music for dance has been featured at the Venice Biennale, the Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM), Teatro Olimpico (Rome), The Joyce Theater, Jacob&#x27;s Pillow, and the Duke Theater on 42nd Street.
Her uncle was actor Maurice Gosfield.

Her large-scale compositions include &quot;Daughters of the Industrial Revolution&quot;, a concert-length piece inspired by her grandparents’ immigrant experiences in New York City during the Industrial Revolution, commissioned by the MAP Fund and premiered at The Kitchen in 2011; the signature piece &quot;EWA7&quot;, a site-specific work created during a residency in the industrial environments of Nuremberg, Germany; and &quot;Floating Messages and Fading Frequencies,&quot; which incorporated coding systems used by the Resistance in WWII, conducted by Pierre-André Valade and performed by the Athelas Sinfonietta, with Gosfield&#x27;s electronic trio in a four-city U.K. tour that included the 2011 Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival.

Her work has been profiled in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, The New Yorker, on National Public Radio, and in articles in The Wire (magazine), Contemporary Music Review, Avant Magazine, Strings Magazine, MusikTexte, and in the book “Music and the Creative Spirit”. She received a 2008 Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award, and has received recent fellowships from the McKnight Foundation, New York Foundation for the Arts, and the Siemens Foundation.

Her music is featured on four solo CDs on Tzadik Records. Her 2012 release, &quot;Almost Truths and Open Deceptions&quot;, features a chamber cello concerto, a piece for piano and broken shortwave radio, and compositions inspired by warped 78 rpm records, baseball, and the industrial revolution, performed by the Annie Gosfield Ensemble, Felix Fan, the Flux Quartet, Real Quiet, Blair McMillen, David Cossin, and the Pearls Before Swine Experience. Her third release, &quot;Lost Signals and Drifting Satellites&quot;, features work scored for solo violin accompanied by satellite transmissions, and solo and chamber works performed by Joan Jeanrenaud and the Flux Quartet. Her previous Tzadik CD, &quot;Flying Sparks and Heavy Machinery,&quot; features two pieces inspired by her 1999 residency in the factories of Nuremberg, Germany. &quot;Burnt Ivory and Loose Wires&quot;, her first solo release for Tzadik, focuses on her work for detuned piano.

Gosfield taught composition as a visiting lecturer at Columbia University from 2019 to 2021. She was the Milhaud Professor of composition at Mills College in 2003 and 2005, visiting lecturer at Princeton University in 2007, and a visiting artist at Cal Arts in 1999. She also taught composition at the University of Texas Austin in 2019 and Indiana University in 2022.

Gosfield&#x27;s writing on music has been featured in four essays published by &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; &quot;TimeSelect&quot;, and her essay &quot;Fiddling with Sputnik&quot; was published in &quot;Arcana II&quot;, edited by John Zorn. 
She is a periodic contributor to &quot;The Score&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; blog where composers discuss their work and the issues involved in creating music in the 21st century.

== Honors and appointments ==
Gosfield received a 2021 Music Award from the Academy of Arts and Letters, and a 2017 Guggenheim Fellowship in music composition. She received the Berlin Prize in music composition, and was made a Fellow at the American Academy in Berlin in spring 2012.

<text>Curling Canada (formerly the Canadian Curling Association (CCA)) is a sanctioning body for the sport of curling in Canada. It is associated with more than a dozen provincial and territorial curling associations across the country, and organizes Canada&#x27;s national championships in the sport. It was formed in 1990 by the merger of the two previous sanctioning bodies, Curl Canada (men&#x27;s) and the Canadian Ladies&#x27; Curling Association (women&#x27;s).

==History==
The CCA was created in 1990 when Curl Canada and the Canadian Ladies&#x27; Curling Association amalgamated. From its creation until 2007, Dave Parkes was the general manager and then chief executive officer (CEO).

Greg Stremlaw was the CEO until 2015 when he took over as head of sports at CBC Sports Katherine Henderson became CEO in 2016 and continued to be in that role until August 2023, when she became CEO of Hockey Canada. Danny Lamoureux took over as interim CEO as her replacement. Nolan Thiessen was appointed CEO in January 2024.

On February 27, 2015, the organization rebranded as Curling Canada.

<text>Daniel Richler (born 1957) is a Canadian arts and pop culture broadcaster and writer.

==Biography==
Richler was born in London, England. His biological father is screenwriter Stanley Mann. His mother, Florence Wood, divorced Mann when Daniel was two years old, and married Mordecai Richler in 1960. The family moved back to Montreal, Quebec — the hometown of both Florence and Mordecai — in 1972 when Daniel was 15.

He became a punk rocker as a teenager and was lead singer of the punk rock band Alpha Jerks. He also joined the Ontario biker gang The New Hegelians as an honorary member, despite not actually owning a motorcycle.

==Career==
From 1977 through the early 1980s, Richler was a deejay, presenter and critic on a variety of major market radio stations including CHOM-FM in Montreal, and CJCL and CFNY-FM in Toronto. In his early radio career, he used his birth name, Daniel Mann, to avoid trading on his stepfather&#x27;s fame. He also joined the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, where he was a cultural commentator on CBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Morningside&quot; with Peter Gzowski.

He moved to CITY-TV in 1985, becoming co-host and eventually producer of &quot;The NewMusic&quot;, the internationally syndicated, pioneering weekly rockumentary show that pre-dated MTV and later gave rise to MuchMusic. The show fused international field journalism and in-depth interviews with rock videos to create an occasionally tough rockumentary newsmagazine geared at 15- to 30-year-olds. Items and documentaries included those on Band-Aid, post-revolutionary music in Zimbabwe, the Japanese pop industry, Andy Warhol&#x27;s art video work, William Burroughs, Frank Zappa at the Parents Music Resource Center hearings in Washington, the death and legacy of Bob Marley, Yoko Ono post-John, and Malcolm McLaren&#x27;s manufacture and manipulation of the Sex Pistols.

In 1987 and 1988 Richler was chief arts correspondent on &quot;The Journal&quot;, CBC&#x27;s national news program. His international profiles and docs included those on Anthony Burgess, Keith Richards, Art Spiegelman, Pat Nixon and numerous others. He subsequently moved to TVOntario where he became creative head of arts programming, and launched the long-running literary program &quot;Imprint&quot;, which he later served as host and executive producer. At that time Richler also oversaw the schedule, acquisitions, commissioning and original programming of the channel&#x27;s arts sector. He developed and launched &quot;Prisoners of Gravity&quot; with Mark Askwith and host/comedian Rick Green, and commissioned Peter Vronsky&#x27;s 1991 feature documentary film &quot;Mondo Moscow&quot;.

He published a novel, &quot;Kicking Tomorrow&quot;, in 1991. The book was named one of &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot;&#x27;s Best Books of 1992.

In the mid-to-late 1990s he was producer, director and presenter of the counterculture show &quot;Big Life&quot; on CBC Newsworld. Subjects included trepanation, anti-genetically modified food activism, digital downloading, auto-erotic asphyxiation, the Furries, anti-G8 anarchism, Burning Man, Genesis P-Orridge, the true nature and history of ecstasy, turntablism, etc. In 1998, he won the Gemini Award for Best Host in a Lifestyle, Variety, or Performing Arts Program or Series for his work on &quot;Big Life&quot;.

In 2001 he moved back to ChumCity as editor-in-chief and executive producer of its new literary specialty channel BookTelevision, which launched on September 1, 2001 as a digital service across Canada. There he conceived and developed the channel format, oversaw development of its schedule, budget of original in-house programming, acquisition selection and overall design. He served as executive producer and/or director for &quot;The Word News&quot;, &quot;The Word This Week&quot;, &quot;Richler, Ink.&quot;, &quot;Writers on the Road&quot;, &quot;Authors at Harbourfront&quot;, &quot;Lust&quot;, &quot;The Electric Archive&quot; and a variety of full-length documentaries.

He left BookTelevision in 2004 to move to London, after his wife Jill Offman accepted a senior position with Discovery Channel UK. In the United Kingdom, he has been a writer and director of television documentaries, including &quot;How Do They Do It?&quot; and &quot;Real Vampires&quot;, and has continued as an occasional contributor of feature journalism to Canadian newspapers such as the &quot;National Post&quot; and &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;. He returned to Canadian broadcasting in 2015 with a week-long stint as a guest host of CBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Q&quot;.

<text>Prisoners of Gravity was a Canadian television news magazine program. Produced by TVOntario, the show was created by Mark Askwith and Daniel Richler, and was hosted by Rick Green. The series aired 139 episodes over five seasons from 1989 to 1994.

The series explored speculative fiction—science fiction, fantasy, horror, comic books—and its relation to various thematic and social issues.

==Format==

As established through a comic-strip montage opening sequence drawn by Ty Templeton, the premise held that Rick, a fan of speculative fiction, becomes disturbed by news broadcasts describing the alarming state of the world and decides that he must escape the Earth. He broadcasts his show each week, with help from his computer companion Nan-Cy (short for NANo-CYbernetic 3000), from an orbiting space station. The show&#x27;s presentation was fully wrapped in its quirky premise, featuring on-screen graphics and background sounds to simulate a space station atmosphere, &quot;using active, innovative cinematography to ease the visual boredom that often accompanies interviews with talking head(s).&quot;

The week&#x27;s topic was introduced with a few opening thoughts before launching into various interview clips. In each episode, Rick would interview a number of authors and artists, along with filmmakers, animators, and the occasional futurist. Topics that were discussed ran the gamut: censorship, superheroes, humour, religion, fairy tales, Mars, cyberpunk, war, overpopulation, and sex. Episodes were 30 minutes in length (having no commercial breaks on public television) and typically showcased six to fourteen interviewed creators alongside bridging commentary from Rick. Roughly six hundred interviews were conducted and aired by the time the show&#x27;s run came to an end.

==Production==

The series was produced by TV Ontario, a public broadcasting station.

The interviews were conducted at science fiction and comic book conventions by production team members Mark Askwith, Shirley Brady, and Gregg Thurlbeck. The majority of the shows were edited by Brian Karn. The series was produced and directed by Jamie Mandelkau (season 1) and by Gregg Thurlbeck (seasons 2 through 5).

==Episodes==
==Interviews==

During its run, the list of authors interviewed became increasingly prestigious, including Clive Barker, George R.R. Martin, Ray Bradbury, David Brin, Charles de Lint, Harlan Ellison, Douglas Adams, William Gibson, Frederik Pohl, Terry Pratchett, Anne Rice, Spider Robinson, and Robert J. Sawyer, who was the most frequent guest on the program. Among the many interviewed comic book creators were Chris Claremont, Will Eisner, Neil Gaiman (who was twice selected as the fan-favourite guest in a viewership mail-in vote), Bob Kane, Jack Kirby, Stan Lee, Daniel Clowes, Fabian Nicieza, Walt Simonson, Scott McCloud, Frank Miller, and Alan Moore. Other notable guests included &quot;Star Trek&quot; creator Gene Roddenberry and actor Michael Dorn, film directors James Cameron and David Cronenberg, award-winning CGI animator Steve &#x27;Spaz&#x27; Williams, and renowned palaeontologist Richard Leakey.

==Awards==
The program was critically successful and won several awards, including the following:

# Two Prix Aurora Awards
# A Broadcast Media Award from the International Reading Association
# A Silver Medal from the New York Festivals of Television
# Two Gemini nominations.
# An Honourable Mention from the Columbus International Film &amp; Video Festival

==Cancellation==

The show was cancelled in 1994 for unspecified reasons, possibly relating to TVOntario&#x27;s intended programming diversification. According to Rick Green, the signature chair from the space station sat in his garage until &quot;raccoons pooed all over it...&quot; and it was discarded.

==Availability==

In the 1990s, the series premiered with select episodes from Season 2 onward being broadcast in the United States on PBS, and in Canada on the sci-fi specialty channel Space (which producer Mark Askwith had gone on to develop and continues to helm) and on Discovery Channel Canada.

Due to contractual restrictions made with interviewees at the time of the show&#x27;s production, there is no commercial release on video or DVD. In 2011, TVOntario posted several episodes from the series in a lower resolution in their public archives. In addition, many episodes (bar the first series) are available for viewing by appointment at The Merril Collection of Science Fiction, Speculation and Fantasy public library located in downtown Toronto, Canada. The Merril Collection&#x27;s tapes are reputed to be Askwith&#x27;s own, donated to the collection for preservation. Interview clips from the show are also included with the CD-ROM in newer editions of The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction by John Clute.

<doc id="497406" wikidata="Q3016111" url="?curid=497406" title="Six Flags Darien Lake">
<text>Six Flags Darien Lake (also known as Six Flags Darien Lake Resort and formerly known as Darien Lake Fun Country, Darien Lake, and Darien Lake Theme Park Resort) is a 1,200-acre (4.86 km2) amusement park and resort located in Darien, New York, off of Interstate 90 between Buffalo and Rochester. Six Flags Darien Lake features a theme park, water park, campground and lodging. It is owned by EPR Properties and operated by Six Flags.

==History==
===Darien Lake Fun Country===
In 1954, Darien Lake was excavated and filled. The lake was a popular swimming destination for many years. In 1964, investor Paul Snyder acquired a 164-acre (66.37 ha) parcel of land bordering the lake and opened a small 23-site campground and picnic area. Snyder continued acquiring more land eventually increasing his holdings to almost 1,000 acres (4.05 km2) of land which included seven lakes, the largest of which was Darien Lake. He stocked one of the smaller lakes, Trout Pond, with fish, increased the number of campsites and added activities for resort guests such as a small petting zoo, horseback and pony rides, paddleboats, skateboarding, tennis courts and miniature golf. From the late 70s and into the early 80s, Snyder added more attractions, including a set of water slides on a hill near the park&#x27;s entrance called Rainbow Mountain, creating an amusement park he named Darien Lake Fun Country. Snyder made a deal with HUSS Park Attractions, turning Darien Lake into the North American showcase for the German manufacturer&#x27;s new rides. Through this deal, the park acquired rides such as the Pirate, Ranger, Thrillbilly and the Corn Popper, for use in the park and to give HUSS a location to display them to potential US and Canadian buyers. In 1982, the newly merged Arrow Huss built and opened the park&#x27;s first major roller coaster, Viper.

===Funtime Parks===
In 1983, Snyder sold a 50% stake in the park to Funtime Inc., which also owned Geauga Lake and Wyandot Lake Park. The Fun Country was dropped from the name, and Funtime brought in some major improvements. Funtime&#x27;s first purchase was the Vekoma-built Giant Wheel Ferris wheel, the showcase of the 1982 World&#x27;s Fair in Knoxville, Tennessee, and the largest in the United States at the time, which was permanently installed in the park&#x27;s center. At one point the largest in the country, the Giant Wheel was in operation until its closing during the 2021 season. Entertainment was also added to the park, with the construction of the Tops Jubilee Theater (now the Grande Theatre), the Lakeside Amphitheater, a large-scale concert stage on the south side of the main lake, presenting big-name acts including The Who, Alice Cooper, and Black Sabbath and Cinema 2000, a wide-angle movie theatre in the back of the park. In the mid-to late 1980s, there was Splashmania, a water skiing show located on Fun Lake. The improvements continued throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, with the addition of a themed kids area, Adventure Land for Kids in 1988 and in 1989 Grizzly Run replaced a kids ride area that was located where a skatepark was. In 1990, six new slides were added to the back of the water slide complex and the area became known as Barracuda Bay and an extra charge was added to the waterpark as well a new locker area, food complex, shopping area and changing rooms. Following the success of a new wooden rollercoaster at Geauga Lake in 1988, Funtime contracted Dinn &amp; Summers to build a new wooden coaster for Darien. The Predator roller coaster opened in May 1990. Around this time, Paul Snyder, sold his remaining share of the park to Funtime, turning over all control to them. In 1992, a new style of entertainment debuted on the midway between Barracuda Bay and the Giant Wheel, a laser light show called &quot;Laser Light Fantasy&quot; (now called &quot;Ignite the Night&quot;), which included laser graphics and fireworks. The show was permanently installed in the Lakeside Amphitheater the following year, while concert events were moved to the new Darien Lake Performing Arts Center, which could hold nearly four times as many guests. In 1994, the old Rainbow Mountain waterslides were replaced with a new set called &#x27;Cuda Falls and waterpark became included with park admission.

===Premier Parks/Six Flags===
In 1995, growing regional park chain Premier Parks bought Funtime, Inc. and its three parks. Premier dove right into changes and additions. In 1995, Skycoaster opened located over Fun Lake. In 1996, Adventure Land was replaced by Popeye&#x27;s Seaport with all new kiddie rides like a Ferris wheel made to look like barrels, a hand-cranked train ride, a submarine ride, a ship themed play place (removed in 2004), children&#x27;s shows Popeye&#x27;s Magic Show and Olive Oyl&#x27;s Circus that featured audience volunteers, and a food stand and restrooms in the then new kiddie area in an area that was occupied by miniature golf course. A new miniature golf course opened behind the then-new kiddie area near Viper which replaced the old golf course. Also a waterpark expansion with new attractions took place in 1996 and 1997 with Hook&#x27;s Lagoon (opened in 1996) the Crocodile Isle wave pool (opened in 1997) took over Adventure Land&#x27;s old location by Elk Lake with new changing rooms and a food stand were built, and a bridge was built to connect the Barracuda Bay slides with the then new water park area and a boat tag game was added to the midway. Three of the old Adventure Land rides were moved to another part of the park as the Tiny Trio in 1997. From 1996-1999, Premier would also install a new roller coaster each year, Nightmare at Phantom Cave in 1996, Mind Eraser in 1997, in 1998 and Superman Ride of Steel in 1999. Nightmare was removed in 1998 and relocated to sister park The Great Escape. In 1998, Premier purchased Six Flags Theme Parks and began to rebrand its own parks as Six Flags. In May 1999, Six Flags Darien Lake opened under its new name, with a few major changes. Premier brought Six Flags&#x27; own character base, Looney Tunes and DC Comics, into the parks, renaming Popeye&#x27;s Seaport to Looney Tunes Seaport, added a show in the vacant former Nightmare at Phantom Cave building called the Batman Thrill Spectacular and Hydro Force, Pipeline Plunge, Riptide Run and Torpedo Rapids were removed from Barracuda Bay and Scrambler replaced Cinema 2000. The midway stage was added to replace the boat tag game and The Emporium gift shop opened in Lasso&#x27;s old location, Crazy Quilt was removed and replaced with Lasso. Premier Parks formed in 2000, assuming the name &quot;Six Flags Inc.&quot; and adding new attractions. The next major attractions installed the Twister in 2000 and Shipwreck Falls in 2002, replacing the old Cascade Canyon water slides on the east side of Barracuda Bay as well as Slingshot behind the &#x27;Cuda Falls water slides; and the Tornado in 2005.

====Troubled times====
2006 was a year of turmoil for Six Flags and its parks. For the 2006 season, Six Flags moved the Big Kahuna, a family-sized waterslide, from Six Flags AstroWorld to Darien Lake and also moved the Batman The Escape roller coaster from Astroworld into storage at Darien Lake, with possible plans to build it. They also added an opportunity to meet with the entire Justice League at the park. Only a month into the season, however, Six Flags began pulling back the Justice League from Darien Lake and announced Darien Lake, along with eight other parks, was being considered for sale. Many parks throughout the chain, not just those for sale, also experienced numerous changes and cutbacks throughout the summer. In October 2006, after shortened operating hours and seasons, Six Flags officially announced the parks were being offered for sale as a package. Paul Snyder stated in a radio interview he would have considered purchasing Darien Lake from Six Flags if they allowed the parks to be sold individually. In January 2007, Six Flags announced a potential sale of seven of the parks to a new company, PARC 7F (officially called PARC Management). Six Flags chose to retain two parks it had originally considered for sale.

===PARC Management/CNL Lifestyle (2007-2010)===
In April 2007, Six Flags completed the sale of Darien Lake and six other parks to PARC Management. Upon completion of the sale, PARC entered into a fifty-year contract with CNL Income Properties, under which CNL purchased the properties from and lease them back to PARC for operation. Because of the timing of the final sale with respect to the park&#x27;s opening, PARC was unable to make any major changes for the 2007 season. The biggest changes for the season were the addition of an all-new show, Le Grande Cirque, which replaced the Batman Thrill Spectacular, and the removal of all Six Flags-, Looney Tunes- and DC Comics-themed signage and references. In 2008, the park debuted the Orange County Choppers MotoCoaster, its first launched rollercoaster. A Zamperla Motocoaster coaster, it was the prototype that had been running outside Zamperla&#x27;s factory in Italy. PARC pledged to lower admission prices that had risen under Six Flags ownership. Floodgate Falls was closed. In March 2010, Darien Lake expanded its current waterpark to Six Flags Hurricane Harbor (Darien Lake) (featuring several new attractions and a repaint of the &#x27;Cuda Falls waterslide complex in Barracuda Bay), a new lazy river called Flotation Station, Swirl City slide complex (with four new slides) and a kiddie wave pool called Lazy Days Lagoon. 2010 also brought about some minor park changes such as Viper being repainted with a black track, The Predator getting new trains and the addition of the Critter Chase in Adventure Isle replacing Raft Adventure. CNL subsequently announced that it had reached an agreement to terminate PARC&#x27;s lease of Darien Lake and up to 17 other locations. The move was made after, according to their 2010 SEC filings, PARC defaulted on their lease obligations.

===Herschend Family Entertainment/CNL Lifestyle (2011-2014)===
In 2011, Herschend Family Entertainment assumed day-to-day operation and management of Darien Lake and Elitch Gardens. Rowdy&#x27;s Ridge opened in 2012 with several family rides. For the 2013 season, Blast Off was placed in the newly rethemed Waterfront Boardwalk area, which included major renovations to rides like the Grand Carousel and the Giant Wheel, along with some new dining options. Laserblast received new improvements and was rebranded &quot;Ignite the Night.&quot; UFO and the &#x27;Cuda Falls waterslides were closed and removed. The Scrambler ride returned after two years in storage.

===Premier Parks, LLC (2014-2018)===
Herschend Family Entertainment&#x27;s lease ended after the 2014 season and was taken over by Premier Parks, LLC. New rides installed during this period include Rolling Thunder, a 72-foot Larson 22M Giant Loop; Brain Drain, a set of two body slides that drops riders through a trapdoor at high speeds; and Ripcurl Racer, a six-lane Proslide Kracken Racer. Following the 2016 season, CNL Lifestyle sold Darien Lake and 14 other amusement parks to EPR Properties. The park continued to be leased and operated by Premier Parks, with no immediate change in operations or staffing. Tantrum, a Gerstlauer Euro-Fighter coaster, opened for the 2018 season.

===Six Flags/EPR Properties (2018-present)===
In May 2018, Six Flags Entertainment Corporation acquired lease rights to operate the park, with the park remaining under the ownership of EPR Properties. Six Flags SkyScreamer, a Funtime Star Flyer, opened for the 2019 season. During this season, the park reverted to the Six Flags Darien Lake branding. For the 2020 season, it was announced that Wahoo Wave, a ProSlide waterslide, would be added to the newly re-named and re-themed Hurricane Harbor WaterPark.

However, the park was temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic (except for the campgrounds and Darien Square), with no timeframe from the state of New York on when theme parks can open. Despite this, the park announced on September 11, 2020, the park would remain closed and all season passes and tickets would be carried over to the 2021 season.

==Current rides and attractions==
===Roller coasters===
===Thrill rides===
===Family rides===
Many of the rides manufactured by Huss Park Attractions were installed as part of a deal with Huss to use Six Flags Darien Lake as a North American showcase for Huss&#x27;s new rides in the early 1980s.
===Kids rides===
Adventure Land for Kids contained all kiddie rides from 1988 through 1996 when it was replaced by Beaver Brothers Bay (previously called Popeye&#x27;s Seaport, Looney Tunes Seaport and Adventure Isle) with all new rides, exclusively from Zamperla. The Tiny Trio was a set of older kiddie rides from Adventure Land located near Mind Eraser. In 2012, the trio was expanded into Rowdy&#x27;s Ridge. The Bay is located on an island surrounded by the midway originally formed by Treasure Island Mini-Golf.
===Water park rides===
==Entertainment==
All show venues listed here are included with price of admission.
===Fright Fest===
The original Six Flags Fright Fest was an annual event held at the end of the operating season (Weekends in October, typically) from 1998 to 2006, which celebrated Halloween. Fright Fest added new areas to the park (Bloodstone Hollow, a free haunted graveyard and town; and Brutal Planet, an upcharge haunted house) and different shows than the regular season (Dead Man&#x27;s Party in The Grande Theater and Laser Spooktacular at the Lakeside Amphitheatre.) When the park was sold to PARC Management in 2007, the event was rebranded as &quot;Fall Family Fun Fest,&quot; adding family oriented areas such as hay mazes and pumpkin painting in addition to the haunted house. During this event, admission to the park was free, with individual charges for each ride and attraction. A re-branded FrightFest returned in 2008 with similar elements to the former Six Flags Fright Fest and additional new elements such as the Fright Night Field Trip, a bus ride through the haunted campgrounds. (However, the event&#x27;s name had a lack of space between the words &quot;Fright&quot; and &quot;Fest&quot; in order to steer clear of any legal conflict with Six Flags.) The Haunted House and the Trick or Treat Trail also returned from previous years. Fright Fest was removed from Darien Lake in 2015 and replaced by Harvest Fest. The Halloween-themed event returned to Darien Lake in 2018 under the Six Flags branding.

===Magic of Lights===
In August 2021, the park unveiled a new Christmas lights display that would be taking place at the park during the upcoming 2021 holiday season. It ran from November 19, 2021, through January 2, 2022. It is a 1.25-mile drive-thru holiday light display extravaganza running through the park. This event was free to all current Season Pass Holders and Members. It did not return in 2022 or beyond based on the website.

===Harvest Fest===

In 2015, Darien Lake replaced their fall events with a more family-friendly event named Harvest Fest. Although this idea was attempted before with Fall Family Fun Fest, here rides were included with admission and less focus was put on scary attractions. Instead of upcharge haunts, hay rides and crafts for children were included with admission. Food trucks, craft beers and other vendors were made available to offset lower staffing during the offseason. Also, the schedule of the season was shortened to end in September, rather than the end of October. In 2018 and 2019 the season was extended through October, this event took place on weekends in September until Fright Fest started. This event didn’t take place during the 2021 or beyond seasons.

<doc id="497407" wikidata="Q2893695" url="?curid=497407" title="Cohen–Macaulay ring">
<text>In mathematics, a Cohen–Macaulay ring is a commutative ring with some of the algebro-geometric properties of a smooth variety, such as local equidimensionality. Under mild assumptions, a local ring is Cohen–Macaulay exactly when it is a finitely generated free module over a regular local subring. Cohen–Macaulay rings play a central role in commutative algebra: they form a very broad class, and yet they are well understood in many ways.

They are named for , who proved the unmixedness theorem for polynomial rings, and for , who proved the unmixedness theorem for formal power series rings. All Cohen–Macaulay rings have the unmixedness property.

For Noetherian local rings, there is the following chain of inclusions.
==Definition==
For a commutative Noetherian local ring &quot;R&quot;, a finite (i.e. finitely generated) &quot;R&quot;-module formula_1 is a &quot;Cohen-Macaulay module&quot; if formula_2 (in general we have: formula_3, see Auslander–Buchsbaum formula for the relation between depth and dim of a certain kind of modules). On the other hand, formula_4 is a module on itself, so we call formula_4 a &quot;Cohen-Macaulay ring&quot; if it is a Cohen-Macaulay module as an formula_4-module. A &quot;maximal&quot; Cohen-Macaulay module is a Cohen-Macaulay module &quot;M&quot; such that formula_7.

The above definition was for a Noetherian local rings. But we can expand the definition for a more general Noetherian ring: If formula_4 is a commutative Noetherian ring, then an &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;M&quot; is called Cohen–Macaulay module if formula_9 is a Cohen-Macaulay module for all maximal ideals formula_10. (This is a kind of circular definition unless we define zero modules as Cohen-Macaulay. So we define zero modules as Cohen-Macaulay modules in this definition.) Now, to define &quot;maximal&quot; Cohen-Macaulay modules for these rings, we require that formula_9 to be such an formula_12-module for each maximal ideal formula_13 of &quot;R&quot;. As in the local case, &quot;R&quot; is a &quot;Cohen-Macaulay ring&quot; if it is a Cohen-Macaulay module (as an formula_4-module on itself).

==Examples==
Noetherian rings of the following types are Cohen–Macaulay.
* Any regular local ring. This leads to various examples of Cohen–Macaulay rings, such as the integers formula_15, or a polynomial ring formula_16 over a field &quot;K&quot;, or a power series ring formula_17 . In geometric terms, every regular scheme, for example a smooth variety over a field, is Cohen–Macaulay.
* Any 0-dimensional ring (or equivalently, any Artinian ring).
* Any 1-dimensional reduced ring, for example any 1-dimensional domain.
* Any 2-dimensional normal ring.
* Any Gorenstein ring. In particular, any complete intersection ring.
* The ring of invariants formula_18 when &quot;R&quot; is a Cohen–Macaulay algebra over a field of characteristic zero and &quot;G&quot; is a finite group (or more generally, a linear algebraic group whose identity component is reductive). This is the Hochster–Roberts theorem.
* Any determinantal ring. That is, let &quot;R&quot; be the quotient of a regular local ring &quot;S&quot; by the ideal &quot;I&quot; generated by the &quot;r&quot; × &quot;r&quot; minors of some &quot;p&quot; × &quot;q&quot; matrix of elements of &quot;S&quot;. If the codimension (or height) of &quot;I&quot; is equal to the &quot;expected&quot; codimension (&quot;p&quot;−&quot;r&quot;+1)(&quot;q&quot;−&quot;r&quot;+1), &quot;R&quot; is called a determinantal ring. In that case, &quot;R&quot; is Cohen−Macaulay. Similarly, coordinate rings of determinantal varieties are Cohen-Macaulay.

Some more examples:
# The ring &quot;K&quot;[&quot;x&quot;]/(&quot;x&quot;²) has dimension 0 and hence is Cohen–Macaulay, but it is not reduced and therefore not regular.
# The subring &quot;K&quot;[&quot;t&quot;2, &quot;t&quot;3] of the polynomial ring &quot;K&quot;[&quot;t&quot;], or its localization or completion at &quot;t&quot;=0, is a 1-dimensional domain which is Gorenstein, and hence Cohen–Macaulay, but not regular. This ring can also be described as the coordinate ring of the cuspidal cubic curve &quot;y&quot;2 = &quot;x&quot;3 over &quot;K&quot;.
# The subring &quot;K&quot;[&quot;t&quot;3, &quot;t&quot;4, &quot;t&quot;5] of the polynomial ring &quot;K&quot;[&quot;t&quot;], or its localization or completion at &quot;t&quot;=0, is a 1-dimensional domain which is Cohen–Macaulay but not Gorenstein.

Rational singularities over a field of characteristic zero are Cohen–Macaulay. Toric varieties over any field are Cohen–Macaulay. The minimal model program makes prominent use of varieties with klt (Kawamata log terminal) singularities; in characteristic zero, these are rational singularities and hence are Cohen–Macaulay, One successful analog of rational singularities in positive characteristic is the notion of F-rational singularities; again, such singularities are Cohen–Macaulay.

Let &quot;X&quot; be a projective variety of dimension &quot;n&quot; ≥ 1 over a field, and let &quot;L&quot; be an ample line bundle on &quot;X&quot;. Then the section ring of &quot;L&quot;
:formula_19
is Cohen–Macaulay if and only if the cohomology group &quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;L&quot;&quot;j&quot;) is zero for all 1 ≤ &quot;i&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot;−1 and all integers &quot;j&quot;. It follows, for example, that the affine cone Spec &quot;R&quot; over an abelian variety &quot;X&quot; is Cohen–Macaulay when &quot;X&quot; has dimension 1, but not when &quot;X&quot; has dimension at least 2 (because &quot;H&quot;1(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;O&quot;) is not zero). See also Generalized Cohen–Macaulay ring.

==Cohen–Macaulay schemes==
We say that a locally Noetherian scheme formula_20 is Cohen–Macaulay if at each point formula_21 the local ring formula_22 is Cohen–Macaulay.

===Cohen–Macaulay curves===
Cohen–Macaulay curves are a special case of Cohen–Macaulay schemes, but are useful for compactifying moduli spaces of curves where the boundary of the smooth locus formula_23 is of Cohen–Macaulay curves. There is a useful criterion for deciding whether or not curves are Cohen–Macaulay. Schemes of dimension formula_24 are Cohen–Macaulay if and only if they have no embedded primes. The singularities present in Cohen–Macaulay curves can be classified completely by looking at the plane curve case.

==== Non-examples ====
Using the criterion, there are easy examples of non-Cohen–Macaulay curves from constructing curves with embedded points. For example, the scheme
:formula_25
has the decomposition into prime ideals formula_26. Geometrically it is the formula_27-axis with an embedded point at the origin, which can be thought of as a &quot;fat point&quot;. Given a smooth projective plane curve formula_28, a curve with an embedded point can be constructed using the same technique: find the ideal formula_29 of a point in formula_30 and multiply it with the ideal formula_31 of formula_32. Then
:formula_33
is a curve with an embedded point at formula_34.

===Intersection theory===
Cohen–Macaulay schemes have a special relation with intersection theory. Precisely, let &quot;X&quot; be a smooth variety and &quot;V&quot;, &quot;W&quot; closed subschemes of pure dimension. Let &quot;Z&quot; be a proper component of the scheme-theoretic intersection formula_35, that is, an irreducible component of expected dimension. If the local ring &quot;A&quot; of formula_35 at the generic point of &quot;Z&quot; is Cohen-Macaulay, then the intersection multiplicity of &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot; along &quot;Z&quot; is given as the length of &quot;A&quot;:

:formula_37.

In general, that multiplicity is given as a length essentially characterizes Cohen–Macaulay ring; see #Properties. Multiplicity one criterion, on the other hand, roughly characterizes a regular local ring as a local ring of multiplicity one.

===Example===
For a simple example, if we take the intersection of a parabola with a line tangent to it, the local ring at the intersection point is isomorphic to
:formula_38
which is Cohen–Macaulay of length two, hence the intersection multiplicity is two, as expected.

==Miracle flatness or Hironaka&#x27;s criterion==
There is a remarkable characterization of Cohen–Macaulay rings, sometimes called miracle flatness or Hironaka&#x27;s criterion. Let &quot;R&quot; be a local ring which is finitely generated as a module over some regular local ring &quot;A&quot; contained in &quot;R&quot;. Such a subring exists for any localization &quot;R&quot; at a prime ideal of a finitely generated algebra over a field, by the Noether normalization lemma; it also exists when &quot;R&quot; is complete and contains a field, or when &quot;R&quot; is a complete domain. Then &quot;R&quot; is Cohen–Macaulay if and only if it is flat as an &quot;A&quot;-module; it is also equivalent to say that &quot;R&quot; is free as an &quot;A&quot;-module.

A geometric reformulation is as follows. Let &quot;X&quot; be a connected affine scheme of finite type over a field &quot;K&quot; (for example, an affine variety). Let &quot;n&quot; be the dimension of &quot;X&quot;. By Noether normalization, there is a finite morphism &quot;f&quot; from &quot;X&quot; to affine space &quot;A&quot;&quot;n&quot; over &quot;K&quot;. Then &quot;X&quot; is Cohen–Macaulay if and only if all fibers of &quot;f&quot; have the same degree. It is striking that this property is independent of the choice of &quot;f&quot;.

Finally, there is a version of Miracle Flatness for graded rings. Let &quot;R&quot; be a finitely generated commutative graded algebra over a field &quot;K&quot;,
:formula_39
There is always a graded polynomial subring &quot;A&quot; ⊂ &quot;R&quot; (with generators in various degrees) such that &quot;R&quot; is finitely generated as an &quot;A&quot;-module. Then &quot;R&quot; is Cohen–Macaulay if and only if &quot;R&quot; is free as a graded &quot;A&quot;-module. Again, it follows that this freeness is independent of the choice of the polynomial subring &quot;A&quot;.

==Properties==
*A Noetherian local ring is Cohen–Macaulay if and only if its completion is Cohen–Macaulay.
*If &quot;R&quot; is a Cohen–Macaulay ring, then the polynomial ring &quot;R&quot;[&quot;x&quot;] and the power series ring &quot;R&quot;&quot;x&quot; are Cohen–Macaulay.
*For a non-zero-divisor &quot;u&quot; in the maximal ideal of a Noetherian local ring &quot;R&quot;, &quot;R&quot; is Cohen–Macaulay if and only if &quot;R&quot;/(&quot;u&quot;) is Cohen–Macaulay.
*The quotient of a Cohen–Macaulay ring by any ideal is universally catenary.
*If &quot;R&quot; is a quotient of a Cohen–Macaulay ring, then the locus { &quot;p&quot; ∈ Spec &quot;R&quot; | &quot;R&quot;&quot;p&quot; is Cohen–Macaulay } is an open subset of Spec &quot;R&quot;.
*Let (&quot;R&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;k&quot;) be a Noetherian local ring of embedding codimension &quot;c&quot;, meaning that &quot;c&quot; = dim&quot;k&quot;(&quot;m&quot;/&quot;m&quot;2) − dim(&quot;R&quot;). In geometric terms, this holds for a local ring of a subscheme of codimension &quot;c&quot; in a regular scheme. For &quot;c&quot;=1, &quot;R&quot; is Cohen–Macaulay if and only if it is a hypersurface ring. There is also a structure theorem for Cohen–Macaulay rings of codimension 2, the Hilbert–Burch theorem: they are all determinantal rings, defined by the &quot;r&quot; × &quot;r&quot; minors of an (&quot;r&quot;+1) × &quot;r&quot; matrix for some &quot;r&quot;.
*For a Noetherian local ring (&quot;R&quot;, &quot;m&quot;), the following are equivalent:
*#&quot;R&quot; is Cohen–Macaulay.
*#For every parameter ideal &quot;Q&quot; (an ideal generated by a system of parameters),
*#:formula_40 := the Hilbert–Samuel multiplicity of &quot;Q&quot;.
*#For some parameter ideal &quot;Q&quot;, formula_40.
:(See Generalized Cohen–Macaulay ring as well as Buchsbaum ring for rings that generalize this characterization.)

==The unmixedness theorem==
An ideal &quot;I&quot; of a Noetherian ring &quot;A&quot; is called unmixed in height if the height of &quot;I&quot; is equal to the height of every associated prime &quot;P&quot; of &quot;A&quot;/&quot;I&quot;. (This is stronger than saying that &quot;A&quot;/&quot;I&quot; is equidimensional; see below.)

The unmixedness theorem is said to hold for the ring &quot;A&quot; if every ideal &quot;I&quot; generated by a number of elements equal to its height is unmixed. A Noetherian ring is Cohen–Macaulay if and only if the unmixedness theorem holds for it.

The unmixed theorem applies in particular to the zero ideal (an ideal generated by zero elements) and thus it says a Cohen–Macaulay ring is an equidimensional ring; in fact, in the strong sense: there is no embedded component and each component has the same codimension.

See also: quasi-unmixed ring (a ring in which the unmixed theorem holds for integral closure of an ideal).

==Counterexamples==
# If &quot;K&quot; is a field, then the ring &quot;R&quot; = &quot;K&quot;[&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;]/(&quot;x&quot;2,&quot;xy&quot;) (the coordinate ring of a line with an embedded point) is not Cohen–Macaulay. This follows, for example, by Miracle Flatness: &quot;R&quot; is finite over the polynomial ring &quot;A&quot; = &quot;K&quot;[&quot;y&quot;], with degree 1 over points of the affine line Spec &quot;A&quot; with &quot;y&quot; ≠ 0, but with degree 2 over the point &quot;y&quot; = 0 (because the &quot;K&quot;-vector space &quot;K&quot;[&quot;x&quot;]/(&quot;x&quot;2) has dimension 2).
# If &quot;K&quot; is a field, then the ring &quot;K&quot;[&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;]/(&quot;xy&quot;,&quot;xz&quot;) (the coordinate ring of the union of a line and a plane) is reduced, but not equidimensional, and hence not Cohen–Macaulay. Taking the quotient by the non-zero-divisor &quot;x&quot;−&quot;z&quot; gives the previous example.
# If &quot;K&quot; is a field, then the ring &quot;R&quot; = &quot;K&quot;[&quot;w&quot;,&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;]/(&quot;wy&quot;,&quot;wz&quot;,&quot;xy&quot;,&quot;xz&quot;) (the coordinate ring of the union of two planes meeting in a point) is reduced and equidimensional, but not Cohen–Macaulay. To prove that, one can use Hartshorne&#x27;s connectedness theorem: if &quot;R&quot; is a Cohen–Macaulay local ring of dimension at least 2, then Spec &quot;R&quot; minus its closed point is connected.

The Segre product of two Cohen-Macaulay rings need not be Cohen-Macaulay.

==Grothendieck duality==
One meaning of the Cohen–Macaulay condition can be seen in coherent duality theory. A variety or scheme &quot;X&quot; is Cohen–Macaulay if the &quot;dualizing complex&quot;, which &quot;a priori&quot; lies in the derived category of sheaves on &quot;X&quot;, is represented by a single sheaf. The stronger property of being Gorenstein means that this sheaf is a line bundle. In particular, every regular scheme is Gorenstein. Thus the statements of duality theorems such as Serre duality or Grothendieck local duality for Gorenstein or Cohen–Macaulay schemes retain some of the simplicity of what happens for regular schemes or smooth varieties.

<doc id="497411" wikidata="Q6635450" url="?curid=497411" title="List of proposed amendments to the Constitution of the United States">
<text>Hundreds of proposed amendments to the United States Constitution are introduced during each session of the United States Congress. From 1789 through January 3, 2019, approximately 11,770 measures have been proposed to amend the United States Constitution. Collectively, members of the House and Senate typically propose around 200 amendments during each two-year term of Congress. Most, however, never get out of the Congressional committees in which they were proposed. Only a fraction of those actually receive enough support to win Congressional approval to go through the constitutional ratification process. Some proposed amendments are introduced over and over again in different sessions of Congress. It is also common for a number of identical resolutions to be offered on issues that have widespread public and congressional support.

Since 1789, Congress has sent 33 constitutional amendments to the states for ratification. Of these, 27 have been ratified. The framers of the Constitution, recognizing the difference between regular legislation and constitutional matters, intended that it be difficult to change the Constitution; but not so difficult as to render it an inflexible instrument of government, as the amendment mechanism in the Articles of Confederation, which required a unanimous vote of thirteen states for ratification, had proven to be. Therefore, a less stringent process for amending the Constitution was established in Article V.

== Amending process ==

Amending the United States Constitution is a two-step process. Proposals to amend it must be properly &quot;adopted&quot; and &quot;ratified&quot; before becoming operative. A proposed amendment may be adopted and sent to the states for ratification by either:
* The United States Congress, whenever a two-thirds majority in both the Senate and the House deem it necessary;
:or
* A national convention, called by Congress for this purpose, on the application of the legislatures of two thirds (presently 34) of the states.
The latter procedure has never been used. To become part of the Constitution, an adopted amendment must be ratified by either:
* The legislatures of three-fourths (presently 38) of the states; 
:or
* State ratifying conventions in three-fourths (presently 38) of the states.
The decision of which ratification method will be used for any given amendment is Congress&#x27; alone to make. Only for the 21st amendment was the latter procedure invoked and followed. Upon being properly ratified, an amendment becomes an operative addition to the Constitution.

== 19th century ==

Constitutional amendment proposals considered in but not approved by Congress during the 19th century included:
* The Dueling Ban Amendment, proposed in 1838 after Representative William Graves killed another Representative, Jonathan Cilley, in a duel, would have prohibited any person involved in a duel from holding federal office.
* Shortly before his death during the congressional debates leading to the Compromise of 1850, John C. Calhoun proposed constitutional amendments requiring an equal number of slave states and free states and creating two co-Presidents from the North and the South which would have to concur on all legislation. A similar amendment to eliminate the presidency so as to have two elected officials in its place, was proposed by Virginia Representative Albert Jenkins in 1860 shortly before sectional tensions escalated into the American Civil War. Jenkins saw the amendment as a way for both the Northern and the Southern states to be represented equally in the government at a given time.
* The Christian Amendment, first proposed in February 1863, would have added acknowledgment of the Christian God in the Preamble to the Constitution. Similar amendments were proposed in 1874, 1896, and 1910 with none passing. The last attempt, in 1954, did not come to a vote.
* The Blaine Amendment, proposed in 1875, would have banned public funds from going to religious purposes, in order to prevent Catholics from taking advantage of such funds. Though it failed to pass, many states adopted such provisions.
* An amendment allowing property-owning unmarried women to vote was proposed by Representative William Mason. The underlying logic behind this amendment was that these single women did not have husbands to represent their interests via the vote. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, a suffragist at the time, stated in her testimony before the U.S. Senate Committee on Woman Suffrage: &quot;Though my coadjutors all believe in universal suffrage, yet I think we should be willing to let you start with spinsters and widows who are householder. Having homes of their own it is fair to suppose that they are industrious, common-sense women, ... women who love their country (having no husbands to love) better than themselves.&quot; The Nineteenth Amendment would later establish women&#x27;s suffrage irrespective of marital status or property in 1920.
* Representative Lucas M. Miller proposed a constitutional amendment to change the country&#x27;s name to &quot;the United States of the Earth.&quot;

== 20th century ==

Constitutional amendment proposals considered in but not approved by Congress during the 20th century included the following:
* An amendment abolishing the Senate was proposed by Representative Victor Berger in 1911, due to his belief that it was corrupt as well as useless to the country as a whole. The amendment would have also shielded the unicameral House of Representatives&#x27; legislation from presidential veto and judicial review. At the time, Senators were still elected by state legislatures. The year after Berger proposed his amendment, Congress passed an amendment mandating popular election of Senators which was duly ratified by the several states.
* An anti-miscegenation amendment was proposed by Representative Seaborn Roddenbery, a Southern Democrat from Georgia, in 1912 to forbid interracial marriages nationwide. This was spurred when black boxer Jack Johnson garnered much publicity when he married a white woman, Lucille Cameron. Similar amendments were proposed by Congressman Andrew King, a Missourian Democrat, in 1871 and by Senator Coleman Blease, a South Carolinian Democrat, in 1928. None were passed by Congress, although numerous state legislatures passed laws prohibiting interracial marriage before they were ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court&#x27;s 1967 &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot; decision.
* An anti-polygamy amendment was proposed by Representative Frederick Gillett, a Massachusetts Republican, on January 24, 1914, and supported by former U.S. Senator from Utah, Frank J. Cannon, and by the National Reform Association. Utah was dominated by the LDS Church, which permitted multiple marriages until 1890.
* The Ludlow Amendment was proposed by Representative Louis Ludlow in 1937. This amendment would have heavily reduced America&#x27;s ability to be involved in war, requiring a national referendum to confirm any declaration of war. Public support for the amendment was very robust through the 1930s, a period when isolationism was the prevailing mood in the United States. 
* A maximum wage amendment that no person should accumulate more than $1 million was proposed by Representative Wesley Lloyd in 1933. In the wake of the Wall Street Crash and the beginnings of the Great Depression many Americans believed that personal wealth should be limited to avoid such an issue from happening again.
* An amendment to limit investment income was proposed by Representative J. Buell Snyder in 1933.
* Multiple attempts to repeal the 21st Amendment ending Prohibition were proposed by Representative Morris Sheppard, introducer of the 18th Amendment originally banning alcoholic beverages, from 1935 to 1938, followed by attempt to outlaw drunkenness after his first proposals failed.
* The Bricker Amendment, proposed in 1951 by Ohio Senator John W. Bricker, would have limited the federal government&#x27;s treaty-making power by prohibiting treaties from violating the U.S. Constitution and limiting executive agreements. Opposed by President Dwight Eisenhower, it failed twice to reach the threshold of two-thirds of voting members necessary for passage, the first time by eight votes and the second time by a single vote.
* A repeal of the Twenty-second Amendment would eliminate term limits for presidents. Presidents Harry S. Truman, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump all expressed support for some sort of repeal. The first efforts in Congress to repeal the 22nd Amendment were undertaken in 1956, only five years after its ratification. According to the Congressional Research Service, over the ensuing half-century (through 2008) 54 joint resolutions seeking to repeal the two-term presidential election limit were introduced; none were given serious consideration. The most recent attempt was launched by Democratic Representative for New York, José Serrano, in 2013, during the 113th Congress.
* A School Prayer Amendment to establish that &quot;the people retain the right to pray and to recognize their religious beliefs, heritage, and traditions on public property, including schools&quot; was proposed by Robert Byrd of West Virginia in 1962, 1973, 1979, 1982, 1993, 1995, 1997, and 2006. Representative Ernest Istook, a Republican from Oklahoma&#x27;s 5th congressional district, proposed the amendment in the House on May 8, 1997. In March 1998, the House Judiciary Committee passed the bill by a 16–11 vote. On June 4, 1998, the full House voted on the amendment, 224–203 in favor. The vote was 61 short of the required two-thirds majority.
* A Flag Desecration Amendment was first proposed in 1995 to give Congress the power to make acts such as flag burning illegal, seeking to supersede the 1990 Supreme Court case &quot;Texas v. Johnson,&quot; which ruled that such laws were unconstitutional. During each term of Congress from 1995 to 2005, the proposed amendment was passed by the House of Representatives, but never by the Senate, coming closest during voting on June 27, 2006, with 66 in support and 34 opposed (one vote short).
* The Bayh–Celler amendment was the closest the United States has come to passing an Electoral College abolition amendment. The amendment would have replaced the current Electoral College with a simpler two-round system modeled after French presidential elections. It was proposed during the 91st Congress (1969–1971). The House Judiciary Committee voted 28–6 to approve the proposal and was eventually passed by the full House with bipartisan support on September 18, 1969, by a vote of 339 to 70. The Senate commenced openly debating the proposal and the proposal was quickly filibustered. On September 17, 1970, a motion for cloture, which would have ended the filibuster, received 54 votes to 36 for cloture, failing to receive the then required a two-thirds majority of senators voting. Other proposals were made in 2005, 2009, and 2016, none of which were voted on by committee.
* The Human Life Amendment, first proposed in 1973, would overturn the &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; court ruling and prohibit abortion. A total of 330 proposals using varying texts have been proposed with almost all dying in committee. The only version that reached a formal floor vote, the Hatch–Eagleton Amendment, was rejected by 18 votes in the Senate on June 28, 1983. The &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; ruling was later overturned by the Supreme Court in &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot; (2022), leaving individual states to regulate abortion.
* A balanced budget amendment, in which Congress and the President are forced to balance the budget every year, has been introduced many times, dating back to the 1930s. No measure passed either body of Congress until 1982, when the Senate took 11 days to consider it and gained the necessary two-thirds majority. The first and only time the House gave two-thirds approval to a balanced budget amendment was in 1995, when Members of the House of Representatives elected in the Republican Revolution voted for the Contract with America. That was also the last time the House held a floor or committee vote.
* Various proposed amendments for congressional term limits have been made since Supreme Court ruled state term limits on federal officials to be unconstitutional in the &quot;U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton&quot; decision in 1995.
* The single subject amendment, an amendment first proposed in 1996, would introduce a single-subject rule blocking members of Congress from adding riders to bills.

== 21st century ==

Constitutional amendment proposals considered in but not approved by Congress thus far in the 21st century have included:
* The Equal Opportunity to Govern Amendment, proposed in July 2003 by Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), would repeal the Constitution&#x27;s natural born citizen clause, thus allowing naturalized citizenswho have been U.S. citizens for at least twenty yearsto become President of the United States or Vice President. It was widely seen as an attempt to make California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger (born in Austria and naturalized in 1983) eligible for the presidency and is sometimes nicknamed the &quot;Arnold Amendment&quot; or &quot;Amend for Arnold&quot;.
* The Federal Marriage Amendment has been introduced in the United States Congress four times: in 2003, 2004, 2005/2006, and 2008 by multiple members of Congress. It would define marriage and prohibit same-sex marriage, even at the state level. The last Congressional vote on the proposed amendment occurred in the House of Representatives on July 18, 2006, when the motion failed 236–187, falling short of the 290 votes required for passage in that body. The Senate has voted only on cloture motions with regard to the proposed amendment, the last of which was on June 7, 2006, when the motion failed 49 to 48, falling short of the 60 votes required to allow the Senate to proceed to consideration of the proposal and the 67 votes required to send the proposed amendment to the states for ratification.
* Various campaign finance reform amendments have been introduced in Congress since the United States Supreme Court&#x27;s 2010 &quot;Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission&quot; ruling declaring that the First Amendment&#x27;s free speech clause prohibits the federal government from restricting independent expenditures for communications by nonprofit corporations, for-profit corporations, labor unions, and other associations. The most recent version of the amendment was introduced in the 118th Congress by Representative Pramila Jayapal.
* Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Steven Palazzo proposed constitutional amendments barring the government from imposing taxes on refusal to purchase goods and services. The amendment would have invalidated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requiring legal persons to purchase health insurance. 
* Representative Randy Neugebauer introduced an amendment requiring a two-thirds majority for Congress to raise the debt ceiling. 
* Various proposals have been made for a constitutional amendment abolishing birthright citizenship for children of foreign nationals as a deterrent against illegal immigration. President Donald Trump endorsed a similar proposal during the 2016 presidential election.
* Representative Steve King introduced an amendment repealing the Sixteenth Amendment and abolishing the federal income tax.
* Representative John Culberson introduced an amendment altering Article V to limit any national convention convoked by the states to amend the Constitution to a single amendment and requiring Congress to authorize such as a convention. This amendment, sometimes called the &quot;Madison Amendment&quot;, would prevent a &quot;runaway convention&quot; from drastically altering or replacing the U.S. Constitution.
* Various proposals were made by Republican members of Congress to base congressional apportionments on the number of citizens in a state rather than residents following the &quot;Evenwel v. Abbott&quot; decision in 2016. 
* Representative Al Green in 2017 introduced an amendment prohibiting the President of the United States from issuing a pardon for themselves.
*Representative Eliot Engel introduced an amendment prohibiting barriers to voting for adult Americans including &quot;undue burden of proof of identity or citizenship&quot;, prohibiting foreign interference in elections and &quot;undue or anonymous influence from any person&quot;, guaranteeing that electoral districts must be composed of geographically compact and contiguous territory, and designating Election Day as a national holiday unable to be altered by the government. The amendment was proposed after the &quot;Shelby County v. Holder&quot; case overruled parts of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and in light of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Many key aspects of the amendment were incorporated into the proposed For the People Act, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives.
* Representative Cedric Richmond introduced an amendment in the 116th Congress to repeal the penal exception clause from the Thirteenth Amendment, prohibiting unfree labor from being used as a punishment.
* Representative Tom Marino introduced an amendment to amend Article 1, Section 2 of the Constitution to change the terms of Representatives from two years to four (with elections to be held in non-presidential years), but then resigned afterward. Proposals for extending the terms of House members date back to a similar proposal by Lyndon B. Johnson for 4-year terms, renewable in presidential years, in his 1966 State of the Union Address. 
* In response to revived advocacy among progressive activists for expansion of the Supreme Court beyond the customary nine members (as the Constitution does not specify how many justices should sit on the court), Democratic Representative Collin Peterson and Republican Representative Denver Riggleman filed a proposed amendment in the 116th Congress to limit the Supreme Court membership to nine members maximum. A group of Republican congressmembers including Senators Ted Cruz and Thom Tillis proposed an identical amendment a few weeks later, in an entirely separate effort from that of Peterson and Riggleman.
* Parental Rights Amendment to the United States Constitution. The amendment&#x27;s advocates say that it will allow parents&#x27; rights to direct the upbringing of their children, protected from federal interference, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Amendment was first proposed during the 110th Congress as House Joint Resolution 97 in July 2008, but no action was taken during that Congress.
* President Joe Biden proposed an amendment, known as the No One Is Above the Law Amendment, to supersede the 2024 Supreme Court decision &quot;Trump v. United States&quot;, which granted presidents immunity for &quot;official acts&quot;. The amendment would eliminate all &quot;immunity for crimes a former president committed while in office&quot;. On July 25, Representative Joseph Morelle (D-NY) proposed a constitutional amendment to reverse the ruling, with the support of more than forty other members of Congress.

<doc id="497413" wikidata="Q494995" url="?curid=497413" title="Riemann–Hurwitz formula">
<text>In mathematics, the Riemann–Hurwitz formula, named after Bernhard Riemann and Adolf Hurwitz, describes the relationship of the Euler characteristics of two surfaces when one is a &quot;ramified covering&quot; of the other. It therefore connects ramification with algebraic topology, in this case. It is a prototype result for many others, and is often applied in the theory of Riemann surfaces (which is its origin) and algebraic curves.

== Statement ==
For a compact, connected, orientable surface formula_1, the Euler characteristic formula_2 is

:formula_3,

where &quot;g&quot; is the genus (the &quot;number of handles&quot;). This follows, as the Betti numbers are formula_4.

For the case of an (&quot;unramified&quot;) covering map of surfaces

:formula_5

that is surjective and of degree formula_6, we have the formula

:formula_7

That is because each simplex of formula_1 should be covered by exactly formula_6 in formula_10, at least if we use a fine enough triangulation of formula_1, as we are entitled to do since the Euler characteristic is a topological invariant. What the Riemann–Hurwitz formula does is to add in a correction to allow for ramification (&quot;sheets coming together&quot;).

Now assume that formula_1 and formula_10 are Riemann surfaces, and that the map formula_14 is complex analytic. The map formula_14 is said to be &quot;ramified&quot; at a point &quot;P&quot; in &quot;S&quot;′ if there exist analytic coordinates near &quot;P&quot; and π(&quot;P&quot;) such that π takes the form π(&quot;z&quot;) = &quot;z&quot;&quot;n&quot;, and &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1. An equivalent way of thinking about this is that there exists a small neighborhood &quot;U&quot; of &quot;P&quot; such that π(&quot;P&quot;) has exactly one preimage in &quot;U&quot;, but the image of any other point in &quot;U&quot; has exactly &quot;n&quot; preimages in &quot;U&quot;. The number &quot;n&quot; is called the &quot;ramification index at P&quot; and is denoted by &quot;e&quot;&quot;P&quot;. In calculating the Euler characteristic of &quot;S&quot;′ we notice the loss of &quot;eP&quot; − 1 copies of &quot;P&quot; above π(&quot;P&quot;) (that is, in the inverse image of π(&quot;P&quot;)). Now let us choose triangulations of &quot;S&quot; and &quot;S′&quot; with vertices at the branch and ramification points, respectively, and use these to compute the Euler characteristics. Then &quot;S′&quot; will have the same number of &quot;d&quot;-dimensional faces for &quot;d&quot; different from zero, but fewer than expected vertices. Therefore, we find a &quot;corrected&quot; formula

:formula_16
or as it is also commonly written, using that formula_17 and multiplying through by &quot;-1&quot;:
:formula_18

(all but finitely many &quot;P&quot; have &quot;eP&quot; = 1, so this is quite safe). This formula is known as the &quot;Riemann–Hurwitz formula&quot; and also as Hurwitz&#x27;s theorem.

Another useful form of the formula is:
:formula_19
where &quot;b&quot; is the number of branch points in &quot;S&quot; (images of ramification points) and b&#x27; is the size of the union of the fibers of branch points (this contains all ramification points and perhaps some non-ramified points). Indeed, to obtain this formula, remove disjoint disc neighborhoods of the branch points from &quot;S&quot; and their preimages in &quot;S&quot;&#x27; so that the restriction of formula_20 is a covering. Removing a disc from a surface lowers its Euler characteristic by 1 by the formula for connected sum, so we finish by the formula for a non-ramified covering. 

We can also see that this formula is equivalent to the usual form, 
as we have
:formula_21 
since for any formula_22 we have formula_23

== Examples ==
The Weierstrass formula_24-function, considered as a meromorphic function with values in the Riemann sphere, yields a map from an elliptic curve (genus 1) to the projective line (genus 0). It is a double cover (&quot;N&quot; = 2), with ramification at four points only, at which &quot;e&quot; = 2. The Riemann–Hurwitz formula then reads

:formula_25

with the summation taken over four ramification points.

The formula may also be used to calculate the genus of hyperelliptic curves.

As another example, the Riemann sphere maps to itself by the function &quot;z&quot;&quot;n&quot;, which has ramification index &quot;n&quot; at 0, for any integer &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1. There can only be other ramification at the point at infinity. In order to balance the equation

:formula_26

we must have ramification index &quot;n&quot; at infinity, also.

== Consequences ==
Several results in algebraic topology and complex analysis follow.

Firstly, there are no ramified covering maps from a curve of lower genus to a curve of higher genus – and thus, since non-constant meromorphic maps of curves are ramified covering spaces, there are no non-constant meromorphic maps from a curve of lower genus to a curve of higher genus.

As another example, it shows immediately that a curve of genus 0 has no cover with &quot;N&quot; &gt; 1 that is unramified everywhere: because that would give rise to an Euler characteristic &gt; 2.

== Generalizations ==
For a correspondence of curves, there is a more general formula, Zeuthen&#x27;s theorem, which gives the ramification correction to the first approximation that the Euler characteristics are in the inverse ratio to the degrees of the correspondence.

An orbifold covering of degree N between orbifold surfaces S&#x27; and S is a branched covering, so the Riemann–Hurwitz formula implies the usual formula for coverings
:formula_27
denoting with formula_28 the orbifold Euler characteristic.

<text>At the Mountains of Madness is a science-fiction horror novella by the American author H. P. Lovecraft, written in February/March 1931. Rejected that year by &quot;Weird Tales&quot; editor Farnsworth Wright on the grounds of its length, it was originally serialized in the February, March, and April 1936 issues of &quot;Astounding Stories&quot;. It has been reproduced in numerous collections.

The story details the events of a disastrous expedition to Antarctica in September 1930, and what is found there by a group of explorers led by the narrator, Dr. William Dyer of Miskatonic University. Throughout the story, Dyer details a series of previously untold events in the hope of deterring another group of explorers who wish to return to the continent. These events include the discovery of an ancient civilization older than the human race, and realization of Earth&#x27;s past told through various sculptures and murals.

The story was inspired by Lovecraft&#x27;s interest in Antarctic exploration; the continent was still not fully explored in the 1930s. Lovecraft explicitly draws from Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s novel &quot;The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket&quot;, and he may have used other stories for inspiration. Many story elements, such as the formless &quot;shoggoth&quot;, recur in other Lovecraft works. The story has been adapted and used for graphic novels, video games, and musical works.

==Plot==
The story is narrated in a first-person perspective by the geologist William Dyer, a professor at Miskatonic University in Arkham, Massachusetts, aiming to prevent an important and much-publicized scientific expedition to Antarctica. Throughout the course of his explanation, Dyer relates how he led a group of scholars from the university on a previous expedition to Antarctica, during which they discovered ancient ruins and a dangerous secret beyond a range of mountains higher than the Himalayas.

A small advance group, led by Professor Lake, discovers the remains of fourteen prehistoric lifeforms previously unknown to science, and also unidentifiable as either plants or animals. Six of the specimens have been badly damaged, while another eight have been preserved in pristine condition. The specimens&#x27; stratum places them far too early on the geologic time scale for the features of the specimens to have evolved. Some fossils of Cambrian age show signs of the use of tools to carve a specimen for food.

When the main expedition loses contact with Lake&#x27;s party, Dyer and a graduate student named Danforth investigate. Lake&#x27;s camp is devastated, with the majority of men and dogs slaughtered, while a man named Gedney and one of the dogs are absent. Near the expedition&#x27;s campsite, they find six star-shaped snow mounds with one specimen under each. They also discover that the better-preserved lifeforms have vanished, and that some form of dissection experiment has been done on both an unnamed man and a dog. Gedney is suspected of having gone insane and killed and mutilated the others.
Dyer and Danforth fly an aeroplane across the &quot;mountains&quot;, soon revealed to be the outer walls of a vast, abandoned stone city, alien to any human architecture. For their resemblance to creatures of myth mentioned in the &quot;Necronomicon&quot;, the builders of this lost civilization are dubbed the &quot;Elder Things.&quot; By exploring these fantastic structures, the explorers learn through hieroglyphic murals that the Elder Things first came to Earth shortly after the Moon took form and built their cities with the help of &quot;shoggoths&quot;—biological entities created to perform any task, assume any form and reflect any thought. There is a hint that all Earthly life evolved from cellular material left over from the creation of the shoggoths.

As more buildings are explored, the explorers learn about the Elder Things&#x27; conflict with both the Star-spawn of Cthulhu and the Mi-Go, who arrived on Earth shortly afterwards. The images also reflect a degradation of their civilization once the shoggoths gained independence. As more resources are applied in maintaining order, the etchings become haphazard and primitive. The murals also allude to an unnamed evil lurking within an even larger mountain range located beyond the city. This mountain range rose in one night and certain phenomena and incidents deterred the Elder Things from exploring it. When Antarctica became uninhabitable, even for the Elder Things, they soon migrated into a large, subterranean ocean.
Dyer and Danforth eventually realize that the Elder Things missing from the advance party&#x27;s camp had somehow returned to life and, after killing the party, have returned to their city. They also discover traces of the Elder Things&#x27; earlier exploration, as well as sleds containing the corpses of both Gedney and his missing dog. Both are ultimately drawn towards the entrance of a tunnel, into the subterranean region depicted in the murals. Here, they find evidence of various Elder Things killed in a brutal struggle and blind six-foot-tall penguins wandering placidly, apparently used as livestock. They are then confronted by a black, bubbling mass, which they identify as a shoggoth, and escape. Aboard the plane, high above the plateau, Danforth looks back and sees something which causes him to go insane, implied to be the unnamed evil itself.

Dyer concludes the Elder Things are survivors of a bygone era, who slaughtered Lake&#x27;s group only in self-defense or scientific curiosity. Their civilization was eventually destroyed by the shoggoths, which now prey on the enormous penguins. He warns the planners of the proposed expedition to stay away from the site. Danforth continues to experience manic episodes, whispering of &quot;bizarre conceptions&quot; which Dyer attributes to his being one of the few to have completely read through Miskatonic&#x27;s copy of the &quot;Necronomicon&quot;.

==Connections to other Lovecraft stories==
&quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot; has numerous connections to other Lovecraft stories. A few include:
* The formless Shoggoths later appeared in &quot;The Shadow over Innsmouth&quot; (1931), &quot;The Thing on the Doorstep&quot; (1933), and &quot;The Haunter of the Dark&quot; (1935)
* The star-headed Elder Things also appear in &quot;The Dreams in the Witch House&quot; (1933), when the main character, Walter Gilman, visits a city of theirs in one of his dreams, and &quot;The Shadow Out of Time&quot;, in which an Elder Thing is kept as a fellow prisoner.
* Dyer is mentioned in &quot;The Shadow Out of Time&quot; as accompanying Nathaniel Wingate Peaslee&#x27;s expedition to Australia&#x27;s Great Sandy Desert.
* The expedition is sponsored by the Nathaniel Derby Pickman Foundation, combining two major names in Lovecraft&#x27;s fiction: Derby and Pickman. Richard Upton Pickman is the main character in Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;Pickman&#x27;s Model&quot;, while Edward Pickman Derby is the protagonist of his &quot;The Thing on the Doorstep&quot;, and also one of his literary alter-egos.
* The Elder Things record the coming of Cthulhu to Earth and the sinking of R&#x27;lyeh, events referred to in &quot;The Call of Cthulhu&quot; (1928).
* The Elder Things&#x27; city is identified with the Plateau of Leng first mentioned in Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;Celephaïs&quot; (1920).
* Some members of the expedition have read Miskatonic University&#x27;s copy of the &quot;Necronomicon&quot;.
* Dyer mentions &quot;Kadath in the Cold Waste&quot; while referring to a massive mountain range which even the Elder Things &quot;shunned as vaguely and namelessly evil.&quot;
* At the very end of the story, Danforth links the horror beyond the forbidden mountain range to Yog-Sothoth and &quot;The Colour Out of Space&quot;.
* The Mi-Go are the focus of &quot;The Whisperer in Darkness&quot;. Several times throughout, Dyer also makes reference to Albert Wilmarth, the main character of &quot;The Whisperer in Darkness&quot;.

==Inspiration==

Lovecraft had a lifelong interest in Antarctic exploration. &quot;Lovecraft had been fascinated with the Antarctic continent since he was at least 12 years old, when he had written several small treatises on early Antarctic explorers,&quot; the biographer S. T. Joshi wrote. At about the age of 9, inspired by W. Clark Russell&#x27;s 1887 book &quot;The Frozen Pirate&quot;, Lovecraft had written &quot;several yarns&quot; set in Antarctica.

By the 1920s, Antarctica was &quot;one of the last &quot;unexplored&quot; regions of the Earth in which large stretches of territory had never seen the tread of human feet. Contemporary maps of the continent show a number of provocative blanks, and Lovecraft could exercise his imagination in filling them in... with little fear of immediate contradiction.&quot; However, Lovecraft was basically accurate in presenting the geographic knowledge of Antarctica as it was known at the time, and he referred to continental drift, a theory which was then not widely accepted.

The first expedition of Richard E. Byrd took place between 1928 and 1930, just before the novella was written, and Lovecraft mentioned the explorer repeatedly in his letters and remarked at one point on &quot;geologists of the Byrd expedition having found many fossils indicating a tropical past.&quot; In fact, Miskatonic University&#x27;s expedition was modelled after that of Byrd.

In &quot;Lovecraft: A Look Behind the Cthulhu Mythos&quot; Lin Carter suggests that one inspiration for &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot; was Lovecraft&#x27;s own hypersensitivity to cold, as evidenced by an incident in which the writer &quot;collapsed in the street and was carried unconscious into a drug store&quot; because the temperature dropped from 60 degrees to 30 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees to -1 degree Celsius). &quot;The loathing and horror that extreme cold evoked in him was carried over into his writing,&quot; Carter wrote, &quot;and the pages of &quot;Madness&quot; convey the blighting, blasting, stifling sensation caused by sub-zero temperatures in a way that even Poe could not suggest.&quot; S. T. Joshi called the theory &quot;facile.&quot;

Joshi further cites Lovecraft&#x27;s most obvious literary source for &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot; as Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s only novel, &quot;The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket&quot;, whose concluding section is set in Antarctica. Lovecraft twice cites Poe&#x27;s &quot;disturbing and enigmatic&quot; story in his text and explicitly borrows the mysterious cry &quot;Tekeli-li&quot; or &quot;Takkeli&quot; from Poe&#x27;s work. In a letter to August Derleth, Lovecraft wrote that he was trying to achieve with his ending an effect similar to what Poe accomplished in &quot;Pym&quot;.

Another proposed inspiration for &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot; is Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27;s &quot;At the Earth&#x27;s Core&quot; (1914), a novel that posits a highly intelligent reptilian race, the Mahar, living in a hollow Earth. &quot;Consider the similarity of Burroughs&#x27; Mahar to Lovecraft&#x27;s Old Ones, both of whom are presented sympathetically despite their ill-treatment of man,&quot; wrote the critic William Fulwiler. &quot;[B]oth are winged, web-footed, dominant races; both are scientific scholarly races with a talent for genetics, engineering, and architecture; and both races use men as cattle.&quot; Both stories, Fulwiler points out, involve radical new drilling techniques. In both stories, humans are vivisected by nonhuman scientists. Burroughs&#x27; Mahar even employ a species of servants known as Sagoths, possibly the source of Lovecraft&#x27;s Shoggoth.

Other possible sources include A. Merritt&#x27;s &quot;The People of the Pit,&quot; whose description of an underground city in the Yukon bears some resemblance to that of Lovecraft&#x27;s Elder Things, and Katharine Metcalf Roof&#x27;s &quot;A Million Years After,&quot; a story about dinosaurs hatching from eggs millions of years old that appeared in the November 1930 edition &quot;Weird Tales&quot;. In a letter to Frank Belknap Long, Lovecraft declared Metcalf Roof&#x27;s story to be a &quot;rotten,&quot; &quot;cheap,&quot; and &quot;puerile&quot; version of an idea he had years earlier, and his dissatisfaction may have provoked him to write his own tale of &quot;the awakening of entities from the dim reaches of Earth&#x27;s history.&quot;

Edward Guimont has argued that &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot; was inspired by contemporary discourse around life on Mars, including Mars-set fictional works and the claims of Martian canals made by Percival Lowell (whom Lovecraft met in 1907). Guimont has also proposed other influences, including contemporary theories about the decline of the Norse Greenlanders and claims of survival of woolly mammoths in Alaska and particularly plot details being inspired by the 1930 discovery of the remains of Andrée&#x27;s Arctic balloon expedition.

&quot;An H.P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia&quot; suggest that the long scope of history recounted in the story may have been inspired by Oswald Spengler&#x27;s &quot;The Decline of the West&quot;. Some details of the story may also have been taken from M. P. Shiel&#x27;s 1901 Arctic exploration novel &quot;The Purple Cloud&quot;, which was republished in 1930.

The title is derived from a line in Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany&#x27;s short story &quot;The Hashish Man&quot;: &quot;And we came at last to those ivory hills that are named the Mountains of Madness...&quot;.

Lovecraft&#x27;s own &quot;The Nameless City&quot; (1921), which also deals with the exploration of an ancient underground city that is apparently abandoned by its nonhuman builders, sets a precedent for &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot;. In both stories, the explorers use the nonhumans&#x27; artwork to deduce the history of their species. Lovecraft had also used that device in &quot;The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath&quot; (1927)

As for details of the Antarctic setting, the author&#x27;s description of some of the scenery is in part inspired by the Asian paintings of Nicholas Roerich and the illustrations of Gustave Doré, both of whom are referenced by the story&#x27;s narrator multiple times.

==Publication==

Lovecraft submitted the story to &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, but it was rejected by the editor Farnsworth Wright in July 1931. Lovecraft took the rejection badly and put the story to one side. It was eventually submitted by Lovecraft&#x27;s literary agent Julius Schwartz in 1935 to F. Orlin Tremaine, the editor of &quot;Astounding Stories&quot;.

The novella was serialized in the February, March, and April 1936 issues, and Lovecraft received $315 ()—the most he had ever received for a story. The story, however, was harshly edited, with alterations to spellings, punctuation, and paragraphing, and the end of the story had several lengthy passages omitted. Lovecraft was outraged and called Tremaine &quot;that god-damn&#x27;d dung of a &quot;. Lovecraft&#x27;s own hand-corrected copies of &quot;Astounding Stories&quot; formed the basis for the first Arkham House edition, but this still contained over a thousand errors, and a fully restored text was not published until 1985.

==Reception== 
The novella was received negatively during Lovecraft&#x27;s lifetime; Lovecraft stated that its hostile reception had done &quot;more than anything to end my effective fictional career.&quot; Theodore Sturgeon described the novella as &quot;perfect Lovecraft&quot; and &quot;a good deal more lucid than much of the master&#x27;s work&quot;, as well as &quot;first-water, true-blue science fiction.&quot; The story popularized ancient astronaut theories, as well as Antarctica&#x27;s place in the &quot;ancient astronaut mythology&quot;. Edward Guimont has argued that &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot;, despite its terrestrial setting, helped influence later hard science fiction depictions of planetary expeditions and the Big Dumb Object trope, particularly those of Arthur C. Clarke, whose 1940 parody &quot;At the Mountains of Murkiness&quot; was one of his first works of fiction.

==Adaptations==
* &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot; was adapted into a graphic novel created by I. N. J. Culbard and published in 2010 by SelfMadeHero as part of their Eye Classics line (). The book was named &quot;The Observer&quot; Graphic Novel of the Month.
* Japanese artist Gou Tanabe created a two-volume graphic novel with the same name, translated into English by Dark Horse Manga in 2019.
* &quot;The Mountains of Madness&quot; is an audiovisual musical adaptation of the works of H. P. Lovecraft by Tiger Lillies, Danielle de Picciotto and Alexander Hacke.
* On July 28, 2010, director Guillermo del Toro announced that he would direct a film adaptation of H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot; for Universal Pictures, with James Cameron producing. Cameron suggested casting Tom Cruise in the lead role and releasing the film in 3-D. On October 28, 2010, del Toro said that the adaptation probably would not happen at all. He stated, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t look like I can do it. It&#x27;s very difficult for the studios to take the step of doing a period-set, R-rated, tentpole movie with a tough ending and no love story. Lovecraft has a readership as big as any best-seller, but it&#x27;s tough to quantify because his works are in the public domain.&quot; Cameron and del Toro put forward the idea to Universal, who greenlit it. In 2012, del Toro posted that, due to the resemblance in premise with the Ridley Scott film &quot;Prometheus&quot;, the project would probably face a &quot;long pause—if not demise.&quot; However, in 2021 del Toro announced that he was again revisiting the concept and revising the script for an animation approach, saying, &quot;... it would be ideal to do &quot;Mountains of Madness&quot; as stop-motion.&quot;

==Unofficial sequels and other inspired works==
* David A. McIntee noted similarities between the first half of the 1979 science fiction horror film &quot;Alien&quot;, particularly in early versions of the script, to &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot;, &quot;not in storyline, but in dread-building mystery&quot;, and calls the finished film &quot;the best Lovecraftian movie ever made, without being a Lovecraft adaptation&quot;, due to its similarities in tone and atmosphere to Lovecraft&#x27;s works. In 2009, &quot;Alien&quot; writer Dan O&#x27;Bannon said the film was &quot;strongly influenced, tone-wise, by Lovecraft, and one of the things it proved is that you can&#x27;t adapt Lovecraft effectively without an extremely strong visual style ... What you need is a cinematic equivalent of Lovecraft&#x27;s prose.&quot; The 2004 &quot;Alien&quot; sequel, &quot;Alien vs. Predator&quot; borrows its plot liberally from &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot;.
* The 1995 &quot;Prisoner of Ice&quot; video game by Infogrames Multimedia is loosely based on &quot;At The Mountains of Madness,&quot; particularly the introduction where it involves a group of people discovering two mysterious cargo crates in Antarctica that contain Lovecraftian creatures called &quot;the Prisoners.&quot;
* Chaosium Games released a campaign book titled &quot;Beyond the Mountains of Madness&quot; for their &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; role-playing game in 1999. This book details the Starkweather-Moore expedition return to the ice to discover the truth about the Miskatonic Expedition. The book incorporates many of the aspects of the original Lovecraft story, including references to the Poe story, &quot;The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket&quot;, Nicholas Roerich, Danforth and Dyer. This book won the Origins Award for &quot;Best Role-Playing Adventure&quot; in 2000.
*&quot;Call of Cthulhu: Beyond the Mountains of Madness&quot; was a cancelled video game adaptation by Headfirst Productions. It was announced in 2002 as a planned sequel to then-upcoming &quot;Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth&quot; (a long-delayed video game based on Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;The Shadow over Innsmouth&quot;, eventually released in 2006).
* Charles Stross&#x27; 2000 novelette &quot;A Colder War&quot; is a direct sequel to Lovecraft&#x27;s story. Set in the 1980s, it presents an alternate history of the Cold War where the threat of mutual annihilation is not nuclear, but occult, the US and USSR being locked in an arms race based on technologies found by subsequent expeditions to the alien city.
* &quot;Edge of Nowhere&quot;, a 2016 video game developed by Insomniac Games, is set in 1952, 20 years after the expedition, and involves Victor Howard (Robin Atkin Downes) as he ventures into the site to locate his fiancée, who was on an expedition down a similar path.

<text>List of types of malnutrition or list of nutritional disorders include diseases that results from excessive or inadequate intake of food and nutrients.

==Overnutrition==
=== Metabolic ===

Obesity is caused by eating too many calories compared to the amount of exercise the individual is performing, causing a distorted energy balance. It can lead to diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Obesity is a condition in which the natural energy reserve, stored in the fatty tissue of humans and other mammals, is increased to a point where it is associated with certain health conditions or increased mortality.

The low-cost food that is generally affordable to the poor in affluent nations is low in nutritional value and high in fats, sugars and additives. In rich countries, therefore, obesity is often a sign of poverty and malnutrition while in poorer countries obesity is more associated with wealth and good nutrition. Other non-nutritional causes for obesity included: sleep deprivation, stress, lack of exercise, and heredity.

Acute overeating can also be a symptom of an eating disorder.

Goitrogenic foods can cause goitres by interfering with iodine uptake.

=== Vitamins and micronutrients ===

Vitamin poisoning is the condition of overly high storage levels of vitamins, which can lead to toxic symptoms. The medical names of the different conditions are derived from the vitamin involved: an excess of vitamin A, for example, is called &quot;hypervitaminosis A&quot;.

Iron overload disorders are diseases caused by the overaccumulation of iron in the body. Organs commonly affected are the liver, heart and endocrine glands in the mouth.

==Deficiencies==

===Proteins/fats/carbohydrates===
* Protein malnutrition
** Kwashiorkor
** Marasmus

===Dietary minerals===
* Calcium
** Osteoporosis
** Rickets
** Tetany
* Iodine deficiency
** Goiter
* Selenium deficiency
** Keshan disease
* Iron deficiency
** Iron deficiency anemia
* Zinc 
** Growth retardation
===Dietary vitamins===
* Thiamine (Vitamin B1)
** Beriberi
* Niacin (Vitamin B3)
** Pellagra
*Cobalamin (Vitamin B12)
**Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia, and irreversible neurological changes
* Vitamin C
** Scurvy
* Vitamin D
** Osteoporosis
** Rickets
* Vitamin A
** Night Blindness 
* Vitamin K
** Haemophilia</text><links>

<doc id="497430" wikidata="Q1663719" url="?curid=497430" title="NESSIE">
<text>NESSIE (New European Schemes for Signatures, Integrity and Encryption) was a European research project funded from 2000 to 2003 to identify secure cryptographic primitives. The project was comparable to the NIST AES process and the Japanese Government-sponsored CRYPTREC project, but with notable differences from both. In particular, there is both overlap and disagreement between the selections and recommendations from NESSIE and CRYPTREC (as of the August 2003 draft report). The NESSIE participants include some of the foremost active cryptographers in the world, as does the CRYPTREC project.

NESSIE was intended to identify and evaluate quality cryptographic designs in several categories, and to that end issued a public call for submissions in March 2000. Forty-two were received, and in February 2003 twelve of the submissions were selected. In addition, five algorithms already publicly known, but not explicitly submitted to the project, were chosen as &quot;selectees&quot;. The project has publicly announced that &quot;no weaknesses were found in the selected designs&quot;.

==Selected algorithms==
The selected algorithms and their submitters or developers are listed below. The five already publicly known, but not formally submitted to the project, are marked with a &quot;*&quot;. Most may be used by anyone for any purpose without needing to seek a patent license from anyone; a license agreement is needed for those marked with a &quot;#&quot;, but the licensors of those have committed to &quot;reasonable non-discriminatory license terms for all interested&quot;, according to a NESSIE project press release.

None of the six stream ciphers submitted to NESSIE were selected because every one fell to cryptanalysis. This surprising result led to the eSTREAM project.

===Block ciphers===
*MISTY1: Mitsubishi Electric
*AES*: (Advanced Encryption Standard) (NIST, FIPS Pub 197) (aka Rijndael)
*Camellia: Nippon Telegraph and Telephone and Mitsubishi Electric
*SHACAL-2: Gemplus

===Collision-Resistant Hash Functions===
*WHIRLPOOL: Scopus Tecnologia S.A. and K.U.Leuven
*SHA-256*, SHA-384* and SHA-512*: NSA, (US FIPS 180-2)

===Message Authentication Codes===
*UMAC: Intel Corp, Univ. of Nevada at Reno, IBM Research Laboratory, Technion Institute, and Univ. of California at Davis
*Two-Track-MAC: Katholieke Universiteit Leuven and debis AG
*EMAC: Berendschot et al.
*HMAC*: (ISO/IEC 9797-1);

===Asymmetric encryption schemes===
*PSEC-KEM: Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp
*RSA-KEM*: RSA key exchange mechanism (draft of ISO/IEC 18033-2)
*ACE Encrypt#: IBM Zurich Research Laboratory

===Digital signature algorithms===
*RSA-PSS: RSA Laboratories
*ECDSA: Certicom Corp
*SFLASH: Schlumberger Corp (SFLASH was broken in 2007 and should not be used anymore).

===Asymmetric Identification Schemes===
*GPS-auth: Ecole Normale Supérieure, France Télécom, and La Poste

==Other entrants==

Entrants that did not get past the first stage of the contest include Noekeon, Q, Nimbus, NUSH, Grand Cru, Anubis, Hierocrypt, SC2000, and LILI-128.

==Project contractors==
The contractors and their representatives in the project were:

* Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (Prime contractor): Bart Preneel, Alex Biryukov, Antoon Bosselaers, Christophe de Cannière, Bart Van Rompay
* École Normale Supérieure: Jacques Stern, Louis Granboulan, Gwenaëlle Martinet
* Royal Holloway, University of London: Sean Murphy, Alex Dent, Rachel Shipsey, Christine Swart, Juliette White
* Siemens AG: Markus Dichtl, Marcus Schafheutle
* Technion Institute of Technology: Eli Biham, Orr Dunkelman, Vladimir Furman
* Université catholique de Louvain: Jean-Jacques Quisquater, Mathieu Ciet, Francesco Sica
* Universitetet i Bergen: Lars Knudsen, Håvard Raddum

<text>The Patria AMV (Armoured Modular Vehicle) is an 8×8 multi-role military vehicle produced by the Finnish defence industry company Patria.

The main feature of the AMV is its modular design, which allows the incorporation of different turrets, weapons, sensors, or communications systems on the same carriage. Designs exist for different APC (armoured personnel carrier) vehicles and IFV (infantry fighting vehicle) versions, communications versions, ambulances and different fire-support versions, armed with large-caliber mortar and gun systems.

The vehicle has a very good level of mine protection and can withstand explosions of up to TNT. The AMV has protection levels up to 30 mm APFSDS frontal arc. Another important feature is the very good mobility, combining speed, agility, and crew comfort in rough terrain, enabled by the sophisticated but rugged hydropneumatic suspension adjusting each wheel individually.

==History==
The AMV stems from a 1995 investigation by the Finnish Army HQ into different armored vehicle concepts. In 1996, Patria Vehicles began to develop different concept vehicles and found the 8×8 one to be most suitable as a replacement for the 6×6 Sisu Pasi. The Finnish Defence Forces (FDF) ordered a concept study in 1999, which was ready by 2000. Patria continued to develop the vehicle and the first AMV prototype was ready for testing in November 2001. Two evaluation samples were ordered by the FDF in December 2001, and were delivered in 2003.

Later in 2003, the FDF ordered 24 AMOS-equipped Patria AMVs for delivery 2006–09. The FDF also said that they were looking to order some 100 units, equipped with remote-controlled weapon stations, later placing an order for 62. In December 2002, the Polish Defence Ministry placed an order for 690 vehicles, making Patria the leading manufacturer of IFV in the 15–27 tonne range in Europe. Subsequent deals were made all over Europe, as well as in South Africa and the United Arab Emirates—in many places being locally produced. In 2004, the AMV became the first 4th generation combat vehicle of its kind to enter serial production.

The design was based on experience gained from building the Pasi and on customer feedback on that vehicle. It was entirely designed in 3D virtual environments before construction, and successful testing of the prototype showed that it fulfilled all expectations.

The vehicle was initially designed in 6×6, 8×8 and 10×10 variants, but the 10×10 variant was later dropped.

==Variants ==


===Patria AMV (first version)===
The AMV is offered in three main variants: a basic platform, a high roof platform and a heavy weapon platform.

* The AMV basic platform includes APC, IFV, C2, ambulance, reconnaissance, mortar carrier, FCV, ATGM and MGS vehicles. The basic platform can also be provided as an extended Basic L platform with increased internal volume.
* The AMV high roof platform features a larger and higher rear compartment, which allows more space-requiring work to be done inside the vehicle. The AMV SP is suitable for C3, large ambulance and workshop vehicles.
* The AMV heavy weapon platform features a stronger structure, enabling the fitting of heavy weapon systems e.g. Patria AMOS 120 mm mortar turret or Mobile Gun System.

===Patria AMVXP===
In 2013 Patria launched a new upgraded version of AMV. In June 2014 Patria announced the name of its next generation 8×8 armoured vehicles, Patria AMVXP, which stands for Extra Payload, Extra Performance and Extra Protection.

===Lockheed Patria Havoc AMV (United States)===
Patria and Lockheed Martin agreed to cooperate in the competition for the US Marines MPC (Marine Personnel Carrier) program that was set to replace the LAV-25. The USMC planned to obtain 600 MPC vehicles. Patria was to deliver the AMV 8×8 vehicle. Lockheed Martin Systems Integration was responsible for the MPC offer, as well as system integration, survivability systems, the US production line, and networking and logistics. In August 2012, the Marines gave Lockheed a developmental contract for their vehicle, called the Havoc.

For protection against mine attacks, the Havoc would have used a subframe rather than a V-hull. In April 2013, the Havoc successfully completed amphibious testing as part of its evaluation for the MPC program.

The Marine Personnel Carrier was put on hold in June 2013, restarted in February 2014, and then restructured as Phase 1 of the Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) program, which included the previous MPC competitor entries.

During the summer of 2013, the Havoc successfully completed protection systems testing during a series of blast tests. The vehicle completed all threshold and objective protection system testing, with instrumentation indicating that no disabling injuries would have resulted to any of the three crew members and nine dismounted Marines. Lockheed delivered a report demonstrating the high degree of commonality between the Havoc and other Marine Corps vehicles, aimed at reducing cost, training requirements, and logistics needs.

The Lockheed Havoc AMV completed the Nevada Automotive Test Center&#x27;s Butte Mountain Trail course in September 2014. Lockheed planned to offer the Havoc in the Marine Corps&#x27; ACV Phase 1 program, and give them 16 vehicles to test once a Request for Proposals (RFP) was released in early 2015. In July 2015 partnership between Patria and Lockheed Martin came to an end, and Havoc was not offered to the Amphibious Combat Vehicle program.

===Other variants===

*The Slovenian variant &quot;SKOV Svarun 8x8&quot; uses a specially designed hydraulic door. The new door features additional carrying space for ammunition, two RPG-type anti-tank weapons and a general purpose machinegun. Another Slovenian variant &quot;Patria Mangart 25 RCT&quot; is a modification of SKOV Svarun by adding a Mangart 25mm autocannon turret (RCT = Remote Controlled Turret) developed by Slovenian company Valhalla.
*The South African &quot;Badger&quot; variant, equipped with an underfloor armour package from Land Mobility Technologies (LMT) and Denel Land Systems&#x27;s Modular Combat Turret (MCT). Offered in Section, Fire Support, Mortar, Command and Missile sub-variants. Due to various factors, e.g. mismanagement of the project and involvement by the Guptas brothers and associates , it is yet to enter South African service.
*Slovak variant &quot;BOV 8x8 VYDRA&quot; it is armed with a 30mm GTS 30 cannon mounted in a TURRA 30 with fire control system and ammunition containers.
*The UAE variant is slightly lengthened (0.4 m longer) to allow fitting of the more spacious BMP-3 turret and the same number of soldiers as the original AMV model.
*BAE partnered with Patria to offer the &quot;AMV35&quot;, a version of the AMV with an E35 turret from the CV9035 to create a combat reconnaissance vehicle for the Australian Army&#x27;s Land 400 Phase 2 mounted combat reconnaissance requirement.
*Patria made an AMV featuring the CMI Defense CT-CV 105HP turret. The turret features an autoloader, laser warning system, and capabilities for a barrel launched guided missile.

==Service==

===Polish service===
The Polish Army has ordered 690 vehicles in 2003, including 313 AMVs with the Italian Oto Melara 30 mm Hitfist-30P turret and 377 AMVs in &quot;base&quot; configuration to by converted in Poland to other various configurations be delivered between 2004 and 2013. Some of the Polish vehicles were deployed in Afghanistan. The Polish vehicles are known as KTO Rosomak (&quot;wolverine&quot;) in Polish Army service. In 2013 the Polish army ordered 307 more vehicles, including 122 AMVs and 80 mortars, totaling 997 units making Poland the largest operator by a fair margin. The Vehicles are built in Poland under licence. In 2017 Polish Ministry of Defence said that production of KTO Rosomak is now 100% based in Poland.

===Finnish service===
The Finnish Army has ordered 24 AMVs fitted with the AMOS mortar system and 62 AMVs fitted with Protector (RWS) remote weapon system for the 12.7 mm M2HB QCB heavy machine gun or the GMG grenade machine gun. The standard version is known as &quot;XA-360&quot; in Finnish Army service, while the AMOS version is known as &quot;XA-361&quot;.

===Slovenian service===
In June 2006, the Slovenian Ministry of Defence declared that the Patria AMV would be the new armoured fighting vehicle of the Slovenian Armed Forces. Patria will supply 135 vehicles, some equipped with the NEMO mortar, some with Elbit 30 mm remote controlled weapon station and the rest with Kongsberg Protector turrets. Allegations in the Finnish media that Patria used bribery to secure the Slovenian contract led to a scandal and a criminal investigation in Finland and may have contributed to the defeat of Prime Minister Janez Janša in the 2008 Slovenian parliamentary elections. Due to the financial crisis, the defence budget was cut several times. At first, the contract to supply 135 vehicles should have been amended to have less vehicles with better armament. Later on, the defence ministry suffered from even bigger financial cuts. In 2012, the Defence Minister announced the termination of the contract, by which time 30 vehicles had been received.

===South African service===
In May 2007, the South African Denel Land Systems was awarded a contract to build an improved version of the AMV, with a high level of ballistic and mine protection for the South African National Defence Force (SANDF). The AMV will replace South-African Ratels as part of the &quot;Project Hoefyster&quot; (Horseshoe). Five different versions are included: Command, Mortar, Missile, Section and Fire Support vehicles. In November 2013, Denel Land Systems and Patria announced an agreement regarding Patria AMV 8×8 armoured wheeled vehicle serial production and delivery to South Africa. The agreement includes 238 vehicles, with 5 pre-series vehicles delivered during the development phase. In 2023, the SANDF was still in possession of 4 of the 5 original pre-production vehicles, but had not actually accepted them into service. The remainder of the order remained unfilled due to Denel&#x27;s financial difficulties.

===Croatian service===
In July 2007, the Croatian Ministry of Defence selected the Patria AMV as the new armoured fighting vehicle of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia in their first international tender in its history. 84 AMVs will be supplied. Initially, the plan called for 84 8×8 vehicles and 42 6×6 vehicles. The Croatian Ministry of Defence has approved the purchase of 84 Patria AMV 8×8 vehicles. The 6×6 configuration idea was scrapped, and the remaining 42 vehicles were decided to be 8×8s. The purchase of the remaining 42 AMVs was made in December 2008. Due to the financial crisis, the contract was slightly amended in April 2010. There was an initial plan of shelving the order by a half, 64 vehicles were mentioned, but it was decided that the total of 126 units would remain on order. In order to somewhat decrease the cost of the deal, the most expensive variants like the NEMO or engineering units will probably be replaced by less costly APC variants. On the other hand, the production will be sped up and all vehicles are to be delivered by the end of 2012.

===North Macedonian service===
The government of the Republic of North Macedonia announced in 2006 that it would procure the same type that the Croatian military chooses after test trials in 2007—as this would be a less expensive than conducting trials of their own. The configuration of Patria vehicles that eventually win the competition will be similar to those in Slovenian service, but probably in smaller numbers. Any contract has not been published.

===UAE service===
In January 2008, Patria announced that the United Arab Emirates armed forces had ordered the AMV, equipped with the BMP-3 turret. The number of vehicles is yet to be announced.

===Czech service===
In January 2008, Patria offered to deliver 30 AMVs within four months of ordering, if the Czech Army chose the AMV as its next APC. The Czech army had earlier chosen the Austrian Steyr Pandur as their next APC, but the Czech government withdrew from the deal at the end of last year, citing Steyr&#x27;s failure to fulfill the commitments ensuing from the contract.

===Swedish service===
In August 2010, Patria sold 113 AMVs to Sweden in a deal worth 250 million Euros. The deal included an option for another 113 vehicles in the future.

==Combat history==
;War in Afghanistan (2001–2014):
*The Polish Land Forces contingent, which was a part of the International Security Assistance Force, operated 35 (later raised to 128) KTO Rosomak vehicles (including 5 medevac) in Afghanistan since 2007. The APCs were equipped with additional steel-composite armour. In early 2008, a Polish Rosomak serving in Afghanistan (the version with upgraded armour) was attacked by Taliban rebels. The vehicle was hit with RPG-7 rockets but it managed to fire back and returned to base without any help required. In June 2008, a Rosomak was attacked by Taliban and was hit in its frontal armour with an RPG which did not penetrate the armour. In 2009, the first soldier was reported killed while traveling in a Rosomak after an IED exploded under the vehicle causing it to roll over and crushing the gunner who had been standing in the open turret. Similar explosions caused by mines and IEDs have occurred before though they have failed to inflict casualties.
*In October 2010, a platoon of Svarun vehicles was sent to Afghanistan to support the Slovenian OMLT.

;European Union mission in Chad (2008–2009)
:European Union Force Chad/CAR used 16 KTO Rosomak (including 2 medevac).

;Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates-led intervention in Yemen (2015–present)
:United Arab Emirates Army used 8×8 Patria AMVs fitted with remotely operated turrets in an offensive along the west coast of Yemen.

;Russo-Ukrainian War
The Polish-made Patria AMVs have been used by the Armed Forces of Ukraine during the Russian invasion of Ukraine since autumn 2023. On 24 September, three vehicles were lost during failed attack by the Ukrainian Armed Forces near Andriivka.

; (30 in service, 106 on order):
*2006-2012 order: 30 Patria AMV vehicles (local designation SKOV Svarun 8x8) that had already been delivered (full delivery of original order did not happen due to economic and legal questions). Some later modified into Patria Mangart 25 RCT variant by adding a Slovenian 25mm cannon turret.
*2024 order: On 11 July 2024, Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob announced that Slovenia will buy 106 Patria AMVXP vehicles after a competition between four contenders. The vehicles will be used to create a medium battalion battle group and later a scout battalion.

; (113): Sweden made an order for 113 vehicles, and had an option for the same number of vehicles, but a Swedish court ordered the competition to be re-done. In August 2010 the new competition ended in the same result as the original competition with Sweden ordering 113 vehicles from Patria. The first vehicles were delivered in March 2013.

; (55): The United Arab Emirates Army ordered an initial evaluation batch of 15 vehicles. These vehicles will be equipped with BMP-3 turrets and have therefore been slightly modified, including a somewhat longer hull. In January 2016, the General Headquarters of the UAE armed forces ordered 40 Patria AMV hulls with the option of 50 more. The vehicles were shipped in June 2016 from Patria&#x27;s Polish production line. The Patrias are used in Yemen in combat operations.

===Future operators===

; (82 ordered, 810 planned in total)
: It was reported in December 2020, that two Patria AMVXP 8×8 vehicles are being sent to Japan from Finland for field tests to participate in the Next Wheeled Armored Vehicle project under the Japanese Ministry of Defense. In December 2021, the MOD started field tests to asertain the vehicle and an unnamed armored vehicle made by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. In December 2022, the Japanese Ministry of Defense awarded a contract for the AMV through Patria Japan. A first batch of 140 is expected. 140 engines were ordered by Japan from Scania for this vehicle. In August 2023, Patria and Japan Steel Works Ltd. (JSW) signed a license agreement on manufacturing for vehicles in Japan. The agreement enables local production in accordance with Japan Ground Self-Defense Force&#x27;s Wheeled Armored Personnel Carrier (WAPC) programme. The final number of vehicles is unknown as of 2024.
: Orders: 
:* 28 planned with the 2025 budget (¥ 22.5 billion)
:* 28 vehicles with the 2024 budget (¥ 20.0 billion)
:* 26 vehicles with the 2023 budget (¥ 13.6 billion)

; (238): 238 units on order. Designated &quot;Badger&quot;. There will be five versions: a standard infantry carrier, a command car, fire support variant, mortar carrier and tank hunter. Licensed production in South Africa by Denel was scheduled to commence in 2012, but this was delayed to 2017 and subsequently to 2023 due to the company&#x27;s financial difficulties. As of November 2023, no production Badgers had been delivered. The South African army was in possession of 4 pre-production models supplied by Denel for trials purposes, but these were not formally accepted into service.

; (200)
: In April 2023, Ukraine ordered 100 vehicles from the Polish production line. The vehicles will be paid by funds allocated by the EU and USA. Later, in an interview, president Zelensky said that there would be 200 vehicles, 100 now, 100 later. The deal would include mortar carriers.

=== Failed bids ===
: BAE Systems Australia and Land 400 bid partner Patria were confirmed as one of two tenders selected to take part in the 12-month Risk Mitigation Activity for the Australian Army&#x27;s Land 400 Phase 2 combat reconnaissance vehicle program. The other tender was the German-Dutch BOXER IFV. The German BOXER was announced as the winner in March 2018.
: The Patria AMV and more recently (as of 2017) Patria AMVXP is a strong contender for the order in the new Bulgarian project for a new type of wheeled IFV. The project initially called for a total of 238 vehicles in different variants (of them 100 in combat variant, the rest in combat support (reconnaissance, combat engineer etc.) and combat service support variants (MedEvac etc.)). In the end of 2016 the Bulgarian Ministry of Defence re-examined the conditions and out of budget considerations reduced the number of combat vehicles to 90. The requirement that the combat, CS and CSS variants should be of one standard platform was dropped. The new baseline of the project calls for 90 combat vehicles and 108 supporting vehicles for a total cost of 1.22 billion BGN or about €600 million. RfI-letters have been sent to General Dynamics Land Systems – MOWAG (for the Piranha V and the Pandur II), Nexter Systems (for the VBCI), Patria Oy (for the Patria AMV and Patria AMVXP, both have been demonstrated in the country), Rheinmetall Defence AG (for the Boxer), Textron (a joint offer together with Rheinmetall Defence AG for the Boxer in the combat role and Commando Select assembled in Bulgaria in the combat support and combat service support roles. Textron offered its own 6x6 prototype in the combat role, but due to its still unproven status it is considered the weakest alternative), Iveco-Leonardo Defence System (for the B1 Centauro in the updated 120mm B2 version) and Krauss Maffei Wegman GmbH (also for the Boxer). In the beginning of 2017 the defence minister in the Gerdzhikov caretaker government decided, that RfI-letters should be sent to 7 additional companies. Only Otokar (for the Arma), FNSS (for the Pars) and WMZ (for the KTO Rosomak) were credible contenders. The forerunners in the competition at the end of 2017 were the Piranha V, the Patria AMVXP and the Otokar Arma. Patria Group has expressed willingness to involve Bulgarian defence sector companies as subcontractors in the production not only of eventual Bulgarian vehicles, but also for export markets.

<doc id="497433" wikidata="Q4745674" url="?curid=497433" title="Americentrism">
<text>Americentrism, also known as American-centrism or US-centrism, is a tendency to assume the culture of the United States is more important than those of other countries or to judge foreign cultures based on American cultural standards. It refers to the practice of viewing the world from an overly US-focused perspective, with an implied belief, either consciously or subconsciously, in the preeminence of American culture.

The term is not to be confused with American exceptionalism, which is the assertion that the United States is qualitatively different from other nations and is often accompanied by the notion that the United States has superiority over every other nation.

== History ==
Scholarship of Americentrism traces the ideological system&#x27;s origins, historically, to the late 1700s following the established independence of the United States. Americentrism is presented as a shift from Eurocentrism that idolizes the newly founded United States&#x27; ideals of freedom and democracy. 

Such scholarship itself was initially built on Jim Blaut&#x27;s 1980s scholarship of Eurocentrism by Geographer Richard Peet whom coined the term in his 2005 journal, &quot;From Eurocentrism to Americanism&quot;. 

== In the media ==
American television networks have been perceived to contain an Americentric bias in the selection of their material.

Another instance of Americentrism is in the high focus companies have on US markets in relation to others. Often, products produced and developed outside the US are still marketed as typically American.

According to the European Commission, internet governance (in particular that related to the NSA) is too Americentric. It criticized the major role of American company ICANN in its administration.

The English Wikipedia has been criticized for having an Americentric systemic bias with regards to its occasional preference towards US English sources, language, and spelling.

== Criticism ==

=== Social justice ===
Critics of Americentrism denote the ideology in fear of misunderstandings between peoples or nations, and in some cases, escalating into severe racial conflicts or even wars. They claim that distorted Americentrism has the potential to foster racism, create chaos, or ignite armed conflicts.

Critics of American policies utilise the term in a negative context to highlight a deliberate, nationalistic ignorance displayed by the American government towards its own faults, warning of the possible distortion of international relations possible by followers of the ideology.

=== Education ===

Educators have brought attention to the usage of Americentric views in American educational policy and scholarship. Critics have noted the usage of Americentric views specifically in the United States&#x27; public school systems&#x27; educational policy in world history. Sources claim that schools in the United States often tend to prioritise the detailed teaching of the history of Europe and the United States in their World History curriculum, while providing only brief coverage of events in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

In terms of scholarship, it has been noted by various observers that the field of psychological research is predominantly influenced by Americans. It has been asserted that Americans hold the highest share as producers of psychological research, with a significant focus on studying Americans themselves. Therefore there have been criticisms of theories and principles derived from such research in if it is universally applicable to all human beings. Jeffrey Arnett, a professor of psychology at Clark University supports the idea, writing of scholarship, to his critique, disregarding the diversity of human experiences and contexts.

<text>Worry dolls (also named trouble dolls; Spanish Muñecas quitapenas) are small, mostly hand-made dolls that originate from the highland indigenous people of Guatemala.

== Description and material ==

Worry dolls are mostly hand-made. In Guatemala, they are made of wire, wool and colorful textile leftovers. The dolls are then dressed in traditional Mayan style. The size of the doll can vary between ½ inch and 2.0 inches. In western culture, the dolls are mostly made of pressed paper, adhesive tape, paper, and colorful wool. In Guatemala, the dolls can be remarkably larger in size.

== Function ==
In the dolls&#x27; original Guatemalan tradition, a local legend about the origin of the &quot;Muñeca quitapena&quot; refers to a Maya princess named &quot;Ixmucane&quot;. The princess received a special gift from the sun god which would allow her to solve any problem a human could worry about.

In traditional and modern times, worry dolls are given or lent to brooding, anxious, or sorrowful children. They would tell their doll about their sorrows, fears and worries, then hide the doll under their pillow before going to sleep at night. It is said that the child relinquishes their worries to the dolls during the night and by the next morning, all sorrows are said to have been taken away by the worry doll and they can move forward refreshed the next day.

Worry dolls have also played a role in modern pediatrics and child psychiatry. During a psychological interview with children, some counselors have offered a worry doll to the child as some kind of imaginary, but trustworthy &quot;listener&quot;, &quot;allayer&quot; and &quot;contact person&quot;. The doll, in turn, will work for psychiatrists, psychologists, educators and parents as some kind of &quot;agent&quot; and &quot;troubleshooter&quot; between child and adult.

Today, worry dolls are sold in huge quantity in Guatemala and Mexico. Nuns and poor children sell them to tourists as souvenirs. The dolls are quite popular since they are so small and thus easy to carry around.

<doc id="497442" wikidata="Q865162" url="?curid=497442" title="Biretta">
<text>The biretta () is a square cap with three or four peaks or horns, sometimes surmounted by a tuft. Traditionally the three-peaked biretta is worn by Christian clergy, especially Roman Catholic clergy, as well as some Lutheran and Anglican clergy. A four-peaked biretta is worn as academic dress (but not liturgically) by those holding a doctoral degree from a pontifical faculty or pontifical university or faculty. Occasionally the biretta is worn by legal professionals, for instance advocates in the Channel Islands or judges in some Polish courts. 

==Origins==

The origins of the biretta are uncertain. It is mentioned as early as the tenth century. One possible origin is the academic cap of the high Middle Ages, which was soft and square. This is also the ancestor of the modern mortarboard used today in secular universities. The biretta seems to have become more widely used as an ecclesiastical vestment after the synod of Bergamo, 1311, ordered the clergy to wear the &quot;bireta on their heads after the manner of laymen.&quot; The tuft or pom sometimes seen on the biretta was added later; the earliest forms of the biretta (the cap) did not bear the device.

== Liturgical biretta ==

===Catholic use===

The biretta may be used by all ranks of the Latin Church clergy, including cardinals and other bishops to priests, deacons, and even seminarians (who are not clergy, since they are no longer tonsured). Those worn by cardinals are scarlet red and made of silk. After the Second Vatican Council the ceremony of giving the galero to cardinals was replaced with giving the biretta. The biretta of a bishop is amaranth in color, while those worn by priests, deacons, and seminarians are black. The pope does not make use of the biretta.

The Tridentine Roman Missal rubrics on low Mass require the priest to wear the biretta while proceeding to the altar, to hand it to the server on arrival and to resume it when leaving. At solemn Mass the sacred ministers wear it also when seated.

====Appearance====

Cardinals bear no tuft or &quot;pom&quot; (they are given their birettas and zucchetti by the Pope who elevated them in a ceremony named a consistory – they will form a line, and kneel before him when receiving them), bishops bear a purple pom, priests who have been appointed as prelates to certain positions within the Vatican wear a black biretta with red pom, diocesan priests and deacons wear a black biretta with or without a black pom. It is often asserted that seminarians are only entitled to wear a biretta without a pom-pom, but there would seem to be no formal ruling on this point. Priests in monastic and mendicant religious orders that have their own habits (Benedictines, Franciscans, Dominicans, etc.) do not generally wear birettas: in most circumstances, even liturgical, the monastic hood took the place of the biretta. Canons Regular generally do—for instance the canons of the Order of Prémontré wear a white biretta. Clerks Regular (that is, post-Renaissance religious orders primarily dedicated to priestly ministry, for instance the Jesuits and Redemptorists) generally wear a black biretta with no tuft. Other priests who belong to various forms of community life, as the Congregation of the Oratory of St. Philip Neri for instance, generally also wear birettas, but without a pom. The Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest uses black birettas with a blue pom.

The liturgical biretta has three peaks (four peaks however are the norm in Germany and the Netherlands), with the &quot;peak-less&quot; corner worn on the left side of the head. According to the 1913 &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, &quot;It was formerly the rule that a priest should always wear it in giving absolution in confession, and it is probable that the ancient usage which requires an English judge assume the &#x27;black cap&#x27; in pronouncing sentence of death is of identical origin.&quot;

The use of the biretta has not been abolished as a result of changes in the regulation of clerical dress and vesture following the Second Vatican Council and still remains the correct liturgical headgear for those in Holy Orders whilst &quot;in choir&quot;, but its use has been made optional. Its use is prevalent among bishops and cardinals, and less so among other clergy. Some priests wear it during outdoor services such as burials or processions and, as is intended, during the celebration of Mass and other liturgical services. The biretta is also worn by a priest, deacon, subdeacon, and bishop in attendance at a Mass offered according to the rubrics for the Roman Missal of 1962.

=== Anglican use ===
Birettas are also occasionally worn by Anglo-Catholic Anglican clergy, though it is generally considered a Romanism. Canons and deans could wear a black biretta with a red pom.

&quot;Biretta Belt&quot; is a slang term for regions where Anglo-Catholic clergy were historically noticeable and more commonly donned birettas (such as the Episcopal Dioceses of Fond du Lac, Eau Claire, and Milwaukee in Wisconsin, Quincy, Chicago and Springfield in Illinois, Northern Indiana, and Marquette in Michigan).

The Canterbury cap, which like the biretta, evolved from the medieval cap, although seldom used since the early 20th century, has been considered a more authentically Anglican alternative to the biretta. The Canterbury cap has a soft, square top rather than the rigid horns that developed on the biretta.

=== Lutheran use ===
Birettas may also be worn by Lutheran clergy, primarily those affiliated with an Evangelical Catholic churchmanship.

== Academic biretta ==
===Doctoral degrees===

====Use in medieval universities====
In the medieval university, the ceremony by which a new master or doctor received his degree included the birretatio, or imposition of the biretta. This was often given with a token book in recognition of the person&#x27;s scholarship. The academic biretta developed into various styles of academic headgear on the European continent and in the British Isles. Today some secular universities still use the term, if not the actual biretta, to name their academic cap.

====Use by pontifical universities====

For those holding doctoral degrees from a pontifical university or faculty, whether ordained or lay, &quot;the principal mark of a Doctor&#x27;s dignity is the four horned biretta.&quot; In commencement ceremonies and other academic settings, doctors of the four ecclesiastical disciplines (Philosophy, Theology, Canon Law, and Sacred Scriptures) from pontifical faculties and universities have a canonical right to wear the doctoral biretta as stated in the Codex Iuris Canonici, 1917, can. 1378, and explained in commentary 262 of the Commentarium Codicis Iuris Canonici as follows: &quot;262. Doctoratus ac Scentiae effectus canonici sic recensentur can. 1378...doctoribus seu gradum academicum in una ex quatuor supradictis facultatibus «vide 261: philosophia, theologia, ius canonicum, Sacra Scriptura» supremum obtinentibus, rite creatis, seu promotis regulariter post examen, iuxta &quot;statuta a Sede Apostolica probata&quot; (can. 1376, § 2) saltem quoad usum validum &quot;facultatis ab eadem Aplca. Sede concessae&quot; (can. 1377, § 1), deferendi, extra sacras functiones, (quarum nomine ad hunc eflectum non-venit ex usu sacra praedicatio), nisi aliunde amplietur eis hoc ius quoad a) annulum etiam cum gemma &quot;ipsis a iure huius canonis concessum&quot; (can. 136, § 2), b) et biretum doctorale, (idest: cum quatuor apicibus) utpote insigne huius gradus ac diverso colore ornatum pro Facultate.:

The sections concerning the 1917 edition of Canon Law in relation to the academic biretta were abrogated by the updated edition in the 1983 Code of Canon Law. Nevertheless, the use of the academic biretta has continued to this day despite official recognition in the 1983 Code on the grounds that the new code did not intend to suppress its use but simply to divest itself of concern for academic regalia. Moreover, as it became socially acceptable for Catholic priests to study for post-ordination degrees at Protestant seminaries or secular universities, the four horned academic biretta with appropriately colored piping has similarly been employed by such priests earning doctoral degrees from even non-pontifical institutions.

====Colors of doctoral birettas====

The color of the doctoral biretta given by ecclesiastical universities and faculties is normally black, with colored piping corresponding to the faculty of study in which the degree was granted:

* Theology (S.T.D.): Red
* Canon Law (J.C.D.): Green
* Philosophy (Ph.D.): Blue
*Social Sciences (H.E.D., S.I.C.D, etc.): Orange

At one time, different universities had different practices concerning the color and style of the biretta itself. One author, nearly a century ago, reports that in his day the Roman universities gave a doctoral biretta in black silk, Louvain gave a biretta with a colored tuft according to the academic discipline in which the doctorate was awarded, and the Catholic University of America gave a velvet biretta with red tuft and trim to doctors of theology. The &#x27;traditional&#x27; biretta at the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, &quot;Angelicum&quot;, is white, to correspond to the white Dominican habit. Also, the academic senate of the &quot;Angelicum&quot; in its May 2011 meeting indicated that the black biretta may be used with trim and pom in the color of the particular faculty.

A three-peaked black biretta with appropriately colored piping may be similarly used by those receiving the licentiate degree (S.T.L., Ph.L.).

====Depictions in art in Catholicism====

The doctoral biretta is sometimes seen in depictions of St. Teresa of Ávila, because she was declared a doctor by the University of Salamanca. This recognition is distinct from her status as a Doctor of the Church. The doctoral biretta has been borrowed for depictions of another doctor of the Church, St. Thérèse de Lisieux.

===Use by women===

The biretta was considered as possible headwear for female barristers in England and Wales. In 1922, immediately prior to the first lady being called to the Bar, there was discussion among the senior judges about what she should wear on her head. Darling J and Horridge J suggested the biretta, but were outvoted by the other nine judges present. As a result, female barristers wear the same unpowdered men&#x27;s wig as male barristers, which completely covers the hair.

<doc id="497453" wikidata="Q776344" url="?curid=497453" title="Galton Bridge">
<text>The Galton Bridge is a cast-iron bridge in Smethwick, near Birmingham, in the West Midlands of England. Opened in 1829 as a road bridge, the structure has been pedestrianised since the 1970s. It was built by Thomas Telford to carry a road across the new main line of the Birmingham Canal, which was built in a deep cutting. The bridge is above the canal, making it reputedly the highest single-span arch bridge in the world when it was built, wide, and long. The iron components were fabricated at the nearby Horseley Ironworks and assembled atop the masonry abutments. The design includes decorative lamp-posts and X-shaped bracing in the spandrels.

In the 1840s, a railway bridge was built from one of the abutments, with a parapet in keeping with the original. The Galton Bridge carried traffic for over 140 years until it was bypassed by a new road, named Telford Way, in the 1970s, and now carries only pedestrians and cyclists. The bridge is one of six built by Telford that share common design features and the only one still standing without modification. It underwent minor repair work in the 1980s, after which it was repainted from its original black into a colour scheme intended to enhance its features. It is maintained by the Canal and River Trust and lends its name to the nearby Smethwick Galton Bridge railway station. It is a gradeI listed building.

==Background==
The original Birmingham Canal was built from the late 1760s along a meandering route, connecting Birmingham to Wolverhampton via the Black Country coalfields in the modern-day West Midlands. One of the major obstacles on the route was a patch of high ground at Smethwick, roughly north-west of Birmingham. The engineers had originally planned to tunnel through, but discovered that the ground conditions were not suitable. Thus, the canal was carried over the hill by a flight of locks.

By the 1820s canal traffic had grown enormously and its narrowness was causing congestion. The summit at Smethwick was short and bordered by locks at each end; as a result, it was common for long queues of boats to form at either end and fights often broke out among boat crews. Improvements had been mooted for years, though the immediate catalyst for investment was a proposal for a railway connecting Birmingham to Liverpool via Wolverhampton. The canal proprietors consulted Thomas Telford, the most eminent canal engineer of the day, and he designed a new, straighter route (known as the New Main Line, the original canal becoming the Old Main Line) which significantly reduced the length of the canal. This scheme involved the excavation of an artificial valley through the high ground in Smethwick. The bridge was named after Samuel Tertius Galton, a local businessman and major investor in the Birmingham Canal Company.

Three local roads were severed by the work, two of which were replaced with traditional masonry bridges, but Roebuck Lane was to cross the cutting at its widest and deepest point. Like all the bridges on the new route, it needed to span the canal without obstructing the waterway or the towpaths. Hence, Telford considered a lighter structure was necessary. Telford was a pioneer in the use of cast iron and became famed for his bridges and aqueducts using the material, which he discovered could be used to create wider spans than had previously been possible using brick or stone. Cast iron is brittle under tension but strong under compression; in bridge construction, it tended to be used in arch form. The world&#x27;s first iron bridge opened in Shropshire fifty years before the Galton Bridge. Engineers including Telford spent the rest of the 18th century and much of the 19th refining the construction methods.

==Design==
The bridge is a single span of , wide and above the canal. It consists of six cast-iron ribs, each made of seven segments, bolted together. The bridge is supported by tall brick abutments built into the valley sides. The deck plate is supported by X-shaped bracing in the spandrels. Telford added a decorative parapet and lamp-posts, also in cast iron. When built, it was believed to be the longest bridge over a canal and the highest single-span arch bridge in the world; Telford wrote in his memoirs &quot;At the place of greatest excavation is erected the largest canal bridge in the world; it is made of iron.&quot; All the ironwork was cast by Horseley Ironworks at its canal-side factory in nearby Tipton. The name &quot;Galton Bridge&quot; is cast into the centre of the structure, below the parapet, on both sides and &quot;Horseley Iron Works 1829&quot; is cast below both spandrels on both sides.

In his memoirs, published posthumously, Telford described the Galton Bridge as an &quot;extraordinary span&quot;. He explained that his decision to build such a high bridge and to build it in cast iron, then still a novel material, was one of &quot;safety, combined with economy&quot;. A masonry bridge tall enough to reach the top of the banks of the cutting would require substantial abutments which risked the stonework becoming waterlogged and bulging during heavy rain, whereas an iron span was lighter and required smaller abutments. Telford wrote that &quot;the proportion of masonry is small, and produces variety by its appearance of lightness, which agreeably strikes every spectator.&quot;

The Galton Bridge is the last of a series of six cast-iron arch bridges built by Telford to a similar design. The first was at Bonar Bridge in the Scottish Highlands, built in 1810, which became the prototype. Others include the Mythe Bridge at Tewkesbury, built three years before the Galton Bridge, and the Holt Fleet Bridge in Worcestershire, completed in 1828. The Galton Bridge is the only one of the six surviving without later modification; Bonar Bridge was washed away in a flood and Mythe and Holt Fleet bridges were both strengthened with modern materials in the 20th century. The others are Craigellachie Bridge (1814) in north-eastern Scotland, and Waterloo Bridge (1816) in Betws-y-Coed, North Wales, both also strengthened in the 20th century.

The Galton Bridge originally held commanding views of the valley on either side, but these are now obstructed. The bridge is hemmed in between the Smethwick Station Bridge, a railway bridge built in the 1860s, on the west (Wolverhampton) side, and a partial infill of the cutting where a 1970s road scheme crosses the canal on the east (Birmingham) side.

==History==
Construction work on the cutting began in 1827. It and the bridge opened in December 1829. Isambard Kingdom Brunel, then a young engineer, visited it the following year and described it as &quot;prodigious&quot;. In the 1840s to 1850s, the Stour Valley Railway built its Wolverhampton–Birmingham line along a route mostly parallel to the new main line canal. The railway company built an adjacent bridge to take its tracks under the road using one of the abutments from the canal bridge. The span is a masonry arch but the railway company built an iron parapet in keeping with the Galton Bridge.

The bridge carried increasingly heavy vehicles for almost 150 years until the 1970s, when Roebuck Lane (the road which crosses the Galton Bridge and the adjacent Summit Bridge) was bypassed by a road improvement scheme. A much wider road (the A4252) was built and the Galton Bridge was closed to vehicles but continues to carry pedestrians and cyclists. Instead of constructing a new bridge, the 1970s engineers partly filled in the cutting and built a concrete tunnel for the canal, which was reduced in width. The new road, which runs parallel to the Galton Bridge, was named Telford Way and the canal tunnel named Galton Tunnel. The area around the bridge is sometimes known as the Galton Valley. The structure lends its name to the nearby Smethwick Galton Bridge railway station.

The bridge underwent minor structural repair work in 1987 and was repainted in colour to enhance its features; before this, it had always been painted black. An inspection using ropes to access the underside in the 2000s established that the bridge was in excellent condition and that the 1980s paint work had survived well. The bridge is the responsibility of the Canal and River Trust (formerly British Waterways). It has been a gradeI listed building, the highest of three grades, since 1971. Listed building status provides legal protection from demolition or modification. The list entry explicitly includes the attached span across the railway.

<doc id="497457" wikidata="Q182798" url="?curid=497457" title="2012 Summer Paralympics">
<text>The 2012 Summer Paralympics, branded as the London 2012 Paralympic Games, were an international multi-sport parasports event held from 29 August to 9 September 2012 in London, England, United Kingdom. They were the 14th Summer Paralympic Games as organised by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC).

These Games were the first Summer Paralympics to be hosted by London, and the first hosted solely by Great Britain; the English village of Stoke Mandeville co-hosted the 1984 Games with Long Island, New York after its original host, the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, withdrew due to financial issues. In 1948, the village hosted the Stoke Mandeville Games—the first organised sporting event for athletes with disabilities, and a precursor to the modern Paralympic Games—to coincide with the opening of the 1948 Olympics in London.

Because Parasports is a cultural factor of great impact in Great Britain, the organisers expected the Games to be the first Paralympics to achieve mass-market appeal, fuelled by continued enthusiasm over Great Britain&#x27;s performance during the Olympics, awareness of Great Britain&#x27;s role in the history of the Paralympics, the presence of the first global Paralympic star in history – the South African sprinter Oscar Pistorius (who had become the first double amputee to compete in the Summer Olympics alongside non-disabled athletes), and increasing media coverage and promotion of Paralympic sport (including the first developed major advertising campaign made by a local broadcaster). The Games ultimately met these expectations, breaking records for ticket sales, heightening the profile of the Paralympics in relation to the Olympics, and prompting IPC president Philip Craven to declare them the &quot;greatest Paralympic Games ever.&quot;

A total of 503 events in 20 sports were held during the Games; events for athletes with intellectual disabilities (ID) returned to the Paralympic programme after being suspended following the 2000 Summer Paralympics, The Games were contested by a record 4,302 athletes representing 164 National Paralympic Committees, with 14 countries making their Paralympic debut. For the third Summer Paralympics in a row, China won the most medals overall, with a total of 231 (95 of them being gold), followed by Russia and Great Britain.

==Bidding process==

As part of a formal agreement between the International Paralympic Committee and the International Olympic Committee established in 2001, the winner of the bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics was also to host the 2012 Summer Paralympics. At the 117th IOC Session in Singapore, the rights to host the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics were awarded to London.

==Development and preparation==

As with the Olympics, the 2012 Summer Paralympics were overseen by LOCOG and the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA). LOCOG was responsible for overseeing the staging of the games, while the ODA dealt with infrastructure and venues.

The Government Olympic Executive (GOE) within the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) was the lead Government body for co-ordinating the London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics. The GOE reported through the DCMS Permanent Secretary to the Minister for Sports and the Olympics Hugh Robertson. It focused on oversight of the Games, cross-programme management and the London 2012 Olympic Legacy.

England&#x27;s role in the history of the Paralympics was emphasised as part of the Games: an event known as the Stoke Mandeville Games were hosted by the village of Stoke Mandeville—site of the National Spinal Injuries Centre—to coincide with the opening of the 1948 Summer Olympics in London. Contested between British veterans of the Second World War, it was the first organised sporting event for athletes with disabilities, and served as a precursor to the modern Paralympic Games.

===Venues and infrastructure===
The 2012 Summer Paralympics used many of the same venues as the 2012 Summer Olympics, along with two exclusive venues ( Eton Manor for wheelchair tennis and Brands Hatch circuit for road cycling. All the London&#x27;s purpose-built Olympic venues and facilities, including the Olympic Village, were designed and planned to be accessible as possible so they could easily accommodate the Paralympics. Some older venues also contained additional accessible seating areas during the Paralympics.

===Public transport===

Transport for London (TfL) operated the Paralympic Route Network (a downsized version of the Olympic Route Network operated during the Summer Olympics) to facilitate road traffic between venues and facilities. The network provided of lanes specifically reserved for Paralympic athletes and officials. TfL continued to operate its &quot;Get Ahead of the Games&quot; website during the Paralympics, which provided updates and advice for commuters during the Games. Prior to the Games, concerns were raised by TfL commissioner Peter Hendy that London&#x27;s transportation system might not be able to handle the Paralympics adequately. He feared that the end of the school summer holiday (which fell during the Games) would result in increased traffic, and that commuters might not heed traffic warnings or change their travel behaviour as they had during the Olympics.

Sevenoaks railway station was designated as the preferred station for spectators travelling to watch the cycling at Brands Hatch. Organisers chose Sevenoaks over the closer Swanley railway station because of its &quot;existing step-free access and excellent transport links&quot;, and because Swanley did not yet have a wheelchair lift. Whilst organisers did not believe that Swanley would be able to have wheelchair lifts installed by the start of the Paralympics, the station finished their installation by early August 2012.

===Lead-up and promotion===
====Handover ceremony====
The formal handover occurred during the closing ceremony of the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, when Mayor of London Boris Johnson received the Paralympic Flag from Mayor of Beijing Guo Jinlong. This was followed by a cultural presentation by Britain, which was a which was a sequel to the presentation during the Antwerp Ceremony during the Olympics closing ceremonies. It featured urban dance group ZooNation, the Royal Ballet, and Candoco, a physically integrated dance group, all dressed as London commuters and waiting for a bus by a zebra crossing. A double-decker bus drove around the stadium, guided by Ade Adepitan, to music composed by Philip Sheppard. The top of the bus was open and folded down to show a privet hedge featuring London landmarks such as Tower Bridge, The Gherkin and the London Eye. Cherisse Osei, drummer for Mika, and Sam Hegedus then performed, before the top of the bus folded up into its original form,sporting multi-coloured Paralympic livery. Both the Paralympic and Olympic flags were formally raised outside of London&#x27;s City Hall on 26 September 2008. British Paralympians Helene Raynsford and Chris Holmes raised the Paralympic flag.

====Paralympic Day and Super Saturday====

On 8 September 2011 Trafalgar Square staged &quot;International Paralympic Day&quot;, hosted by Rick Edwards, Ade Adepitan and Iwan Thomas, to coincide with a visit to London by representatives of the IPC. The event featured showcases and demonstrations of the 20 sports that would feature during the Games, with some sessions also made inclusive to people with hearing disabilities. It also included appearances by Paralympic athletes Oscar Pistorius, Ellie Simmonds and Sascha Kindred, and the unveiling of a bronze statue of Pistorius by Ben Dearnley. British Prime Minister David Cameron and London&#x27;s mayor Boris Johnson also appeared.

Two days later on 10 September, supermarket chain Sainsbury&#x27;s and Channel 4 presented &quot;Sainsbury&#x27;s Super Saturday&quot;, a family event at Clapham Common. The event featured showcases of Paralympic sports, and a concert featuring pop music acts including Nicola Roberts, Olly Murs, The Wanted, Will Young, Pixie Lott, Dappy, Sugababes, The Saturdays, Chipmunk and Taio Cruz.

====Channel 4 promotional campaign ====
Channel 4 the new local broadcaster of the 2012 Summer Paralympics in the United Kingdom—held a multi-platform advertising campaign to promote its coverage. The broadcaster sought to change the public perception of the Paralympics, encouraging viewers to see them as an &quot;event in its own right&quot;, rather than as an afterthought to the Olympics. The campaign included television adverts, online content, and billboard advertising, some of which carrying the infamous slogan &quot;Thanks for the warm-up&quot;.

As part of the campaign, Channel 4 produced a two-minute-long trailer for its coverage entitled &quot;Meet the Superhumans&quot;, which was directed by Tom Tagholm with input from Deborah Poulton, 2012 Paralympic Project Leader and Alison Walsh, Editorial Manager of Disability, both at Channel 4. The trailer, set to Public Enemy&#x27;s song &quot;Harder Than You Think&quot;, focused on the competitive and &quot;superhuman&quot; aspects of Paralympic sport, while acknowledging the personal events and struggles that reflected every athlete&#x27;s participation in the Games. &quot;Meet the Superhumans&quot; premiered on 17 July 2012, airing simultaneously on 78 different commercial television channels in the UK (which included rival commercial channels ITV and Sky1).

The advert was met with critical acclaim: &quot;Adweek&quot; Tim Nudd declared it &quot;the summer&#x27;s most stunning sports commercial&quot;, while Simon Usborne of &quot;The Independent&quot; felt it was &quot;an act of branding genius&quot; and &quot;a clear bid to bring the Paralympics from the sporting wings to centre stage.&quot; The advert was seen by an estimated audience of 10 million viewers; Channel 4&#x27;s marketing and 
communications chief Dan Brooke estimated that reaction to the advert through social media was double that of the première of the BBC&#x27;s trailer for its Olympics coverage.

&quot;Meet the Superhumans&quot; won a Golden Lion award at the Cannes Lions Festival in June 2013, losing the overall award to the railway safety PSA &quot;Dumb Ways to Die&quot;. Sir John Hegarty, the jury president said of it: &quot;When you&#x27;ve got some really outstanding work it is tragic in some ways it can&#x27;t get a bigger award, but there can only be one grand prix&quot;, while jury member Carlo Cavallone added &quot;[Meet the Superhumans] is an amazing campaign, one of the golds that went through [the judging process] immediately ... Everyone felt it had the highest level of craft. It puts an issue that was really important before London 2012 to raise awareness of the Paralympics [and] they were hyper successful … &quot;Dumb Ways to Die&quot; was a tough contender.&quot;

====Royal Mail stamps and gold post boxes====
In August 2009, Royal Mail unveiled a series of 30 stamps (reflecting the 30th Olympiad) in honour of the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, released in batches of ten between 2009 and July 2011. Each stamp featured an Olympic or Paralympic sport and the London 2012 logo.

As it had done during the Olympics, Royal Mail honoured Britain&#x27;s Paralympic gold medallists by painting a post box gold in each of their home towns (along with an additional post box outside the National Spinal Injuries Centre in Stoke Mandeville, in honour of its role in the Games&#x27; history), and featured them on commemorative stamps released throughout the Games. Royal Mail originally planned only to release a series of six stamps with group portraits of Britain&#x27;s medallists; however, the decision was met with backlash from critics, who argued that the organisation was discriminating against Paralympians by not granting them the same individual recognition as their Olympian counterparts. Olympic shadow minister Tessa Jowell was also critical of Royal Mail&#x27;s plan, saying that the stamps were a symbolic aspect of Britain&#x27;s celebration of the Olympics and that &quot;it would be a shame if this important symbol was not offered to our Paralympian heroes as well.&quot;

Royal Mail initially defended its decision, arguing that it would have been &quot;logistically and practically impossible&quot; to issue individual stamps for each gold medallist, since it expected the British team to meet or exceed its performance at Beijing of 42 gold medals. As a result of the criticism, Royal Mail announced on 15 August 2012 that it would release individual stamps for each British gold medallist during the Paralympics.

====Test events====

Several Paralympics-specific events were held during the London Prepares series of test events for the Olympic and Paralympic Games; these included the London International Goalball Tournament, and the London Disability Grand Prix—which was also the first Paralympic event to be held at London&#x27;s Olympic Stadium.

===Torch relay===
The Paralympic torch relay began on 22 August, when groups of integrated scouts kindled four Paralympic flames on the highest peaks of each Home Nation: Scafell Pike in England, Ben Nevis in Scotland, Slieve Donard in Northern Ireland, and Snowdon in Wales. On 24 August the four flames were used to light ceremonial cauldrons in London, Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff during special &quot;Flame Festival&quot; events; smaller &quot;Flame Celebration&quot; events were also held in various communities over the bank holiday weekend.

On 28 August the four flames were united during a ceremony at Stoke Mandeville Stadium. The flame then travelled a route to Olympic Stadium in a 24-hour relay, with 580 torchbearers working in teams of five. After a two-hour weather delay, a backup flame was taken straight to the stadium as a contingency, and the relay route was modified. However, as the opening ceremony&#x27;s parade of nations took longer than expected, the flame was able to reach the external area of Olympic Stadium in time.

===Ticketing===
2.7 million tickets were offered in total, including event-specific tickets and those granting access solely to the Olympic Park, along with multi-event passes offered for ExCeL London and Olympic Park that were intended to allow spectators to discover a variety of Paralympic events. Unlike previous Paralympics, tickets were in extremely high demand, and the ticket allocation was increased from the originally planned 2.5 million. Whilst the period during the Olympics has historically been the busiest for Paralympic sales, 1.4 million tickets were already sold before the start of the Summer Olympics, already surpassing the total number sold in Sydney. The high demand resulted in the Ticketmaster-operated website crashing under the load.

Organisers expected the first ever sell-out in the history of the Paralympics; LOCOG&#x27;s chief executive Paul Deighton remarked that &quot;the interest in attending the Paralympics has been extraordinary from the start.&quot; This success was attributed to the enthusiasm surrounding Great Britain&#x27;s performance during the Olympics, fan interest in South African sprinter Oscar Pistorius—who had become the first ever double amputee to compete in the Olympics alongside non-disabled athletes, and affordable prices.

On 8 August, LOCOG announced that 2.1 million tickets had been sold (600,000 in the previous month alone), breaking the record of 1.8 million set in Beijing (1.6 million tickets were also distributed by the Chinese government). IPC president Philip Craven congratulated London for this achievement, crediting it to &quot;the insatiable appetite the public has for top class elite sport&quot;, and noted it would be fitting for a Paralympics held in its spiritual birthplace to have filled venues. By the opening ceremony, 2.4 million had been sold, with the remaining 100,000 sold during the Games; 10,000 were offered each day. The last 800 tickets to the Opening Ceremony were distributed to police and the military, while Mayor Boris Johnson arranged for the distribution of 1,100 to members of London&#x27;s youth athletics clubs. Due to popular demand, a further 100,000 contingency tickets were released on 6 September (which included multi-event passes, and event tickets given up by sponsors and partners), along with 100,000 giving access solely to the Olympic Park.

===Logo===

The 2012 Summer Paralympics used an emblem sharing a common design with that of the Summer Olympicsthe first time this had ever been done. The logo, designed by Wolff Olins, was unveiled on 4 June 2007, and is a representation of the number 2012. The Paralympic version has its own distinct colour scheme, and substitutes the Olympic Rings with the Paralympic &quot;agitos&quot;.

===Mascots===

The official mascot of the 2012 Summer Paralympic Games, Mandeville, was unveiled alongside its Olympic counterpart Wenlock on 19 May 2010. As characters, they are portrayed as drops of steel from a steelworks in Bolton, and feature singular camera eyes representing &quot;focus&quot; with the cameras capturing aspects of the Games. Mandeville is named in honour of Stoke Mandeville due to its significance in the origins of the Paralympics. Mandeville also wears a helmet emblazoned in the red, green, and blue colours of the Paralympic emblem.

===Opening ceremony===
The opening ceremony was held on 29 August at the Olympic Stadium. It was inspired by William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;The Tempest&quot; and themed around the concept of &quot;Enlightenment&quot;, with actors Ian McKellen and Nicola Miles-Wildin playing the roles of Prospero and Miranda. It featured appearances by theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking, and performances by British electronic music group Orbital, and the Graeae Theatre Company, who performed Ian Dury&#x27;s 1981 protest song &quot;Spasticus Autisticus&quot;.

The final bearers of the Paralympic flame represented several generations of Paralympic athletes. &quot;Future&quot; Paralympic athlete Joe Townsend, a Royal Marine who lost both of his legs after stepping on a land mine on duty in Afghanistan, delivered the flame to Olympic Stadium via a zipline from the ArcelorMittal &quot;Orbit&quot; tower. He passed the flame to long-time British Five-a-side football captain David Clarke, who then passed it to the lighter of the Paralympic cauldron, Margaret Maughan, who was the winner of Britain&#x27;s first gold medal at the first official Paralympics, in Rome.

===Closing ceremony===

The closing ceremony was held on 9 September at the Olympic Stadium. Entitled &quot;The Festival of the Flame&quot;, the ceremony was themed around the gathering of people in celebration, and was directed by Kim Gavin, who also directed the closing ceremony of the Summer Olympics just a few weeks prior. The artistic programme of the ceremony was set to live performances by the British rock band Coldplay. They were accompanied by guest performers such as the British Paraorchestra (who accompanied the band on &quot;Strawberry Swing&quot;, and also performed the Paralympic anthem), Barbadian singer Rihanna (who performed &quot;We Found Love&quot;, and her collaboration with Coldplay, &quot;Princess of China&quot;) and American rapper Jay-Z (who performed &quot;Run This Town&quot; with Rihanna and Coldplay, and joined in a reprise of &quot;Paradise&quot;).

During their closing remarks, LOCOG chief Sebastian Coe and IPC president Philip Craven both congratulated London for its successful hosting of the Paralympics; Coe was proud that both the Olympics and Paralympics in London could be labelled &quot;Made in Britain&quot;, while Sir Phillip felt that the Games were the &quot;greatest Paralympic Games ever.&quot; The Paralympic flag was handed over from Boris Johnson, Mayor of London to Eduardo Paes, Mayor of Rio de Janeiro, host of the 2016 Summer Paralympics. Ellie Simmonds and Jonnie Peacock shared the honour of extinguishing the Paralympic cauldron, sharing its last flame on torches to others throughout the stadium to represent its eternal spirit.

==The Games==

===Participating National Paralympic Committees===

London 2012 had the largest number of athletes and participating nations of any Paralympic Games before. A total of 4,302 athletes from 164 countries competed in the Games. This represented an increase of 291 athletes and 18 countries from the 2008 Games, which had 4,011 athletes from 146 countries.

Fourteen countries made their Paralympic debut: Antigua and Barbuda, Brunei, Cameroon, Comoros, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, the Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mozambique, North Korea, San Marino, the Solomon Islands and the US Virgin Islands. Trinidad and Tobago returned to the Games for the first time since 1988.

Andorra made its debut in the Summer Paralympics, having already made three appearances at the Winter Paralympics. Malawi, which would have been making its debut at the Games, and Botswana, were both due to send delegations but withdrew hours before the opening ceremony citing a lack of government funds.

The following National Paralympic Committees sent delegations to compete:

Events for athletes with intellectual disabilities (ID class) returned to the Paralympics in athletics, swimming, and table tennis for the first time since 2000. ID events had been suspended following the 2000 Summer Paralympics, after the Spanish basketball team was stripped of their gold medals when it was found that only 2 of their 12 team members actually had an intellectual disability. The IPC introduced a new procedure involving &quot;sports intelligence&quot; testing to better determine eligibility for the ID class.

Also beginning in 2012, sighted guides became eligible to receive medals in certain events; sighted goalkeepers in 5-a-side football, along with guides and pilots in athletics and cycling and boccia assistants were now able to receive medals for their contributions. Previously in the case of tandem cycling, where a visually-impaired rider takes the rear of the bike with a sighted pilot in front, only the visually-impaired rider actually received a medal.

===Calendar===
The official schedule was published on 25 August 2011.

===Medal count===

This table is based on the medal count of the International Paralympic Committee (IPC).

The ranking is sorted primarily by the number of gold medals earned by a National Paralympic Committee (NPC). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If countries are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by IPC Country Code.

==Broadcasting==
Broadcast rights to the 2012 Summer Paralympics were sold to local broadcasters by LOCOG, with production of the world feeds sub-contracted to Olympic Broadcasting Services (OBS). The Games saw a significant growth in media coverage for the Paralympics; LOCOG reached deals with over 36 broadcasters to televise the Games in over 100 countries. LOCOG chief Sebastian Coe stated that &quot;beyond how the commercial value of this package has raised the bar financially for the Paralympic movement, the fantastic broadcast coverage we have agreed will help us take advantage of this opportunity to inspire disabled people of all ages to take up sport and be a catalyst for continued change in public attitudes towards disability.&quot; LOCOG reached deals with broadcasters such as China Central Television, the Korean Broadcasting System, NHK, Rede Globo and SporTV in Brazil, the TV Pool (a consortium of free-to-air broadcasters in Thailand consisting of Channel 3, Channel 5, BBTV Channel 7, and Modernine TV), and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation to air coverage. The games were to be broadcast on television in the United Kingdom by Channel 4, replacing long-time Paralympic broadcaster BBC in a £9 million deal; the BBC still held radio rights, with coverage on BBC Radio 5 Live and 5 Live Sports Extra. The IPC webcast approximately 780 hours of its coverage through its YouTube channel, with four streams of coverage in English and one in Spanish.

Channel 4&#x27;s coverage of the Games was billed as the most extensive Paralympic coverage ever broadcast in the United Kingdom; it promised over 150 hours of live coverage throughout the Games on Channel 4 and sister channel More4, and additional coverage online and through special channels carried by Freesat, Sky and Virgin TV (in both standard and high definition). The broadcaster also invested around £600,000 towards training new on-air personalities with expertise in parasports, with many of them also having disabilities themselves. They would be joined by &quot;Channel 4 News&quot; anchor Jon Snow, and BBC Sport personality Clare Balding. Channel 4 also broadcast supplemental programming to lead towards the Games, such as Paralympic-focused documentaries, other IPC championships, and &quot;That Paralympic Show&quot;, a weekly program focusing on disability sports. During the Games, comedian Adam Hills (who himself was born without a right leg, and hosted the Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s coverage of the Beijing Paralympics) would host &quot;The Last Leg&quot;, a Paralympic-themed chat show that followed the conclusion of each night&#x27;s coverage. Channel 4&#x27;s coverage of the Games drew relatively high viewership; its coverage of the opening ceremony was seen by an average of 7.6 million viewers, a 40% share, and peaked at 11.2 million viewers—making it one of Channel 4&#x27;s most-watched programmes in network history. Primetime coverage saw an average of 3.3 million viewers nightly, while viewership peaked at 4.5 million viewers during the men&#x27;s T44 200m final where Alan Oliveira beat Oscar Pistorius for the gold medal. Its coverage of the closing ceremony peaked at 7.7 million viewers.

Similarly extensive coverage was televised by RTVE in Spain, with approximately 150 hours of live coverage on Teledeporte and TVE HD. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation aired over 100 hours of coverage across its networks during the Paralympics, with coverage on both ABC1 and ABC2. Coverage of the Games set viewership records for ABC, peaking at 1.6 million viewers on average (in comparison to 1.3 million in Beijing), while ABC2 peaked at a 4.7% viewership share, beating competing digital networks. ABC&#x27;s coverage was also nominated for a Logie Award for &quot;Most Popular Sports Program&quot;.

In the United States, NBC Sports, while not being certified as an official broadcaster, purchased and provided five-and-a-half hours of coverage in total, and no live coverage. Additionally, Pay TV channel NBC Sports Network aired one-hour highlight shows, and NBC broadcast a special recapping the Games on 16 September. The United States Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee provided extensive coverage through its own digital outlets. Critics and American athletes expressed disappointment at NBC for its decision not to broadcast any live coverage of the Games. In Canada, rights were held by Canada&#x27;s Olympic Broadcast Media Consortium; TSN (English) and RDS (French) produced daily hour-long highlight programs (some of which were aired by CTV Television), while tape-delayed airings of the opening ceremony were carried by Sportsnet One, TSN2, RDS, and RDS2. The coverage was simulcast with open audio descriptions by AMI-tv, a network which broadcasts programming with accommodations for those who are visually or hearing impaired. AMI-tv also broadcast supplemental programming, such as a daily news program from London and a documentary series focusing on Canadian athletes at the Paralympics.

===Paralympic Media Awards===
The Telegraph Media Group won the Best Written (print and online) award and Channel 4 won the best broadcast award. The best radio award went to BBC World Service and Larry Wong working for Edmonton Journal won the best photo prize for his image of Benoit Huot.

==Controversies==

===Atos involvement===

The role of IT company Atos as a technology provider and official sponsor of the Paralympic Games was criticised by disability-rights groups, due to its contract with Britain&#x27;s Department for Work and Pensions to carry out capability assessments that determine eligibility for disability benefits. They argued that Atos&#x27;s programme had lacked integrity and was intended to help cut government spending, since the assessments have resulted in many workers with disabilities being incorrectly judged as &quot;fit for work&quot; and denied benefits. Therefore, the groups considered it hypocritical for Atos to sponsor the Games, whilst simultaneously operating a programme that has negatively affected the lives of residents with disabilities. UK Uncut, a political group opposed to public-service budget cuts, held a series of protests dubbed &quot;The Atos Games&quot; to coincide with the start of the Paralympics, culminating with joint demonstrations with Disabled People Against Cuts outside the London headquarters of both Atos and the Department for Work and Pensions on 31 August 2012. Speaking at the protests, comedian Jeremy Hardy said that the programme&#x27;s intent to &quot;victimise people with disabilities&quot; was &quot;blatant and shameless.&quot;

During the opening ceremony some British athletes reportedly obscured the Atos logo on their accreditation passes in protest of their involvement. However, an official from the British Paralympic Association denied that this had been the case. LOCOG defended Atos&#x27;s involvement, stating that the company was &quot;a critical and valued member of [the companies] delivering these Games&quot;, due to the technologies it has provided, which included information systems for managing volunteers and distributing event results.

===Ticketing===
Controversy arose about seating rules for wheelchair users, after two mothers with disabilities accused LOCOG of having discriminatory policies. One claimed she had been told by a LOCOG staff member that spectators in a wheelchair area at the Velodrome could only be accompanied by one adult, and children could not attend without being accompanied by another non-disabled adult, while another was told that her ability to sit in a wheelchair area with her children at ExCeL London was &quot;not guaranteed&quot;. A petition for improved access for families with disabilities, started by one of the mothers on Change.org, quickly collected over 30,000 signatures. LOCOG denied having discriminatory policies, stating that parents with disabilities could steward their children in wheelchair seating areas at events with unreserved seats, but may not all be able to sit together at events with reserved seating.

LOCOG faced further criticism for how it handled the sale of tickets for the wheelchair areas within venues. In May 2012 the online sale of tickets for wheelchair areas was replaced by a dedicated telephone hotline. Organisers were criticised for their use of an 0844 revenue share number for this hotline, and for neglecting to mention on its ticketing website that calls would be charged by the minute. Former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe viewed this as discrimination against wheelchair users, and called upon LOCOG to compensate those who had used the hotline. LOCOG denied that it was receiving additional profits from the phone line, and claimed that a dedicated line was being used to allow customers to receive a service tailored to their individual accessibility needs.

A minor incident occurred involving blind Member of Parliament David Blunkett, who was attending the opening ceremony alongside a Channel 4 director. Blunkett was denied access to his seat at Olympic Stadium because there was no room for his guide dog, and had to watch the ceremony from seats in the stadium&#x27;s gantry instead. However, Blunkett noted that this was an isolated incident and chose not to make an issue of it, simply advising organisers to &quot;seek to find a solution rather than impose a preconceived notion of what is or is not possible.&quot;

===British television coverage===
British official broadcaster Channel 4 received some criticism for its coverage of the Paralympics. Users of Twitter complained that its coverage of the opening ceremony contained too many commercial breaks, drawing comparisons to similar complaints faced by NBC during the Olympics&#x27; opening ceremony; unlike the BBC, who televised the Olympics in the United Kingdom, both NBC and Channel 4 are supported by advertising. Complaints noted that Channel 4 had shown five ad breaks within the first hour of the ceremony, and that ironically, it had recently broadcast a six-hour long late-night dance music special with no adverts at all. Channel 4 defended the criticism by stating that it had broadcast &quot;significantly fewer&quot; commercials than normal for primetime programming during the ceremony, and that the ad breaks were needed in order to help the channel invest in broadcasting programming such as the Paralympics. Criticism was also made towards comments made by Jon Snow and Krishnan Guru-Murthy during the telecast; Snow was criticized for making comments about war-torn countries during the parade of nations, while Guru-Murthy received similar criticism for quipping that &quot;looking at the ages of these athletes, which have been helpfully provided to us, they&#x27;re really quite old.&quot;

Channel 4 was also accused of showing too many studio segments during the first few days of the Games rather than live events, and for missing several notable events involving British athletes, including a swimming heat where Eleanor Simmonds set a new personal best and almost beat the world record, Sarah Storey winning her eleventh Paralympic medal, and Great Britain&#x27;s opening wheelchair basketball game against Germany. Channel 4 noted that time was needed during the first few days to explain Paralympic events and the classification system to viewers, and that it was operating three additional channels&#x27; worth of live coverage throughout the Games. The broadcaster also stated that it had to make editorial decisions on which events to air during periods where a large number of events were in progress. The amount of live coverage was also affected by Olympic Broadcasting Services, who did not send cameras or provide official television coverage for sports such as cycling, the marathon, and shooting. Channel 4&#x27;s news department did send its own cameramen to film the affected events for highlights, but was unable to broadcast them live.

===American television coverage===
In the United States, NBC Sports held the broadcast rights to both the Olympics and Paralympics in 2012. NBC had been frequently criticised in past years by American athletes and IPC officials for its minimal coverage of past Paralympics, and it was speculated by critics that NBC&#x27;s history of inadequate coverage may have impacted New York City&#x27;s bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics. In 2008, it did not air any coverage while the Games were in progress (neither live or delayed), choosing to air a recap documentary on NBC in November 2008, followed by a week of highlights on Universal Sports. While relatively larger than its Beijing coverage, NBC produced only five-and-a-half hours of specials featuring tape delayed highlights of the Games; most of them aired on pay-TV channel NBCSN, while the last aired on NBC a week following the conclusion of the Games. No coverage of the opening and closing ceremonies, nor any live coverage, was provided. By contrast, some broadcasters (such as the host broadcasters, and broadcasters in Australia and Spain) planned to air at least 100 hours or more of coverage from London, and NBC itself had provided extensive coverage of the London Olympics, which was heavily viewed.

NBC&#x27;s lack of coverage drew the ire of American disability rights groups and IPC president Philip Craven, who expressed his disappointment for American athletes and viewers who were unable to fully experience the games on television. Craven remarked that &quot;some people think that North America always [leads] on everything, and on this they don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s about time they caught up.&quot; Following the closing ceremonies, Craven hinted that the IPC might exercise greater scrutiny on broadcasters at future Paralympics by stating that &quot;if we find our values don&#x27;t fit, we&#x27;ll have to go somewhere else.&quot; NBC acquired the rights to the 2014 and 2016 Paralympic Games in September 2013; the broadcaster vowed to air a relatively larger amount of Paralympic coverage from Sochi and Rio de Janeiro respectively—in particular, NBC and NBCSN were to air at least 66 hours from Rio. Craven praised NBC&#x27;s decision to devote a relatively larger amount of airtime to future Paralympics, sharing his hope that U.S. audiences would be &quot;as captivated and emotionally enthralled as the billions around the world who tuned in to London 2012 last summer.&quot;

===Women&#x27;s discus medals===

During the women&#x27;s class F35/36 discus competition, an error in scoring caused the wrong medals to be presented. In this combined class event, final standings were determined based on a points calculation. The calculation converted distances thrown into points, to account for the different functional impairments of the participating athletes. Due to an error in the scoring system, the gold medal in the event was originally awarded to Ukrainian athlete Mariia Pomazan. When the mistake was discovered, the recalculated points showed that Chinese athlete Wu Qing had finished first, with Pomazan in second place. A second medal ceremony was held, which Pomazan did not attend in protest. She was eventually required to return her gold medal.

<text>Cashmere wool, usually simply known as cashmere, is a fiber obtained from cashmere goats, pashmina goats, and some other breeds of goat. It has been used to make yarn, textiles and clothing for hundreds of years. Cashmere is closely associated with the Kashmir shawl, the word &quot;cashmere&quot; deriving from an anglicization of &quot;Kashmir&quot;, when the Kashmir shawl reached Europe in the 19th century. Both the soft undercoat and the guard hairs may be used; the softer hair is reserved for textiles, while the coarse guard hair is used for brushes and other non-apparel purposes. Cashmere is a hygroscopic fiber, absorbing and releasing water from the air based on the surrounding environment. This helps regulate the body in both warm and cool temperatures. 

A number of countries produce cashmere and have improved processing techniques over the years, but China and Mongolia are two of the leading producers as of 2019. Afghanistan is ranked third.

Some yarns and clothing marketed as containing cashmere have been found to contain little to no cashmere fiber, so more stringent testing has been requested to ensure items are fairly represented.
Poor land management and overgrazing to increase production of the valuable fiber has resulted in the decimation and transformation of grasslands into deserts in Asia, increasing local temperatures and causing air pollution which has traveled as far as Canada and the United States.

== Sources ==

Historically in the western scientific community, fine-haired Cashmere goats have been called Capra hircus, as if they were a subspecies of the domestic goat &quot;Capra hircus&quot;. However, they are now more commonly considered part of the domestic goat subspecies &quot;Capra aegagrus hircus&quot; or the alternate version &quot;Hircus Blythi Goat&quot;. Cashmere goats produce a double fleece that consists of a fine, soft undercoat or underdown of hair mingled with a straighter and much coarser outer coating of hair called guard hair. This undercoat is grown in the winter as a way to keep the goat warm in colder months. For the fine underdown to be sold and processed further, it must be de-haired. De-hairing is a mechanical process that separates the coarse hairs from the fine hair. After de-hairing, the resulting cashmere is ready to be dyed and converted into textile yarn, fabrics and garments. De-hairing is made slightly easier by removing the undercoat by hand, rather than shaving the entire coat. This process takes much longer to remove the cashmere, but produces a much finer, higher quality fiber.

== Gathering ==

Cashmere wool is collected during the spring moulting season when the goats naturally shed their winter coat. In the Northern Hemisphere, the goats moult as early as March and as late as May.

In some regions, the mixed mass of down and coarse hair is removed by hand with a coarse comb that pulls tufts of fiber from the animal as the comb is raked through the fleece. The collected fiber then has a higher yield of pure cashmere after the fiber has been washed and dehaired than produced by shearing. The long, coarse guard hair is then typically clipped from the animal and is often used for brushes, interfacings and other non-apparel uses. Animals in Iran, Afghanistan, New Zealand, and Australia are typically shorn of their fleece, resulting in a higher coarse hair content and lower pure cashmere yield. In America, the most popular method is combing. The process takes up to two weeks, but with a trained eye for when the fiber is releasing, it is possible to comb the fibers out in about a week. The term &quot;baby cashmere&quot; is used for fibres harvested from younger goats, and has a reputation of being softer.

== Production ==
China has become the largest producer of raw cashmere, estimated at 19,200 metric tons (in hair) per year (2016). Mongolia follows with 8,900 tons (in hair) as of 2016, while Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, Kyrgyzstan and other Central Asian republics produce lesser amounts. The annual world raw production is estimated to be between 15,000 and 20,000 tons (13,605 and 18,140 tonnes) (in hair). Pure cashmere, resulting from removing animal grease, dirt and coarse hairs from the fleece, is estimated at 6,500 tons (5,895 tonnes). Ultra-fine Cashmere or Pashmina is still produced by communities in Kashmir but its rarity and high price, along with political instability in the region, make it very hard to source and to regulate quality. It is estimated that the average yearly production per goat is .

Pure cashmere can be dyed and spun into yarns and knitted into jumpers (sweaters), hats, gloves, socks and other clothing, or woven into fabrics then cut and assembled into garments such as outer coats, jackets, trousers (pants), pajamas, scarves, blankets, and other items. Fabric and garment producers in Scotland, Italy, and Japan have long been known as market leaders. Cashmere may also be blended with other fibers to bring the garment cost down, or to gain their properties, such as elasticity from wool, or sheen from silk.

The town of Uxbridge, Massachusetts, in the United States was an incubator for the cashmere wool industry. It had the first power looms for woolens and the first manufacture of &quot;satinets&quot;. Capron Mill had the first power looms, in 1820. It burned on July 21, 2007, in the Bernat Mill fire.

In the United States, under the U.S. Wool Products Labeling Act of 1939, as amended, (15 U. S. Code Section 68b(a)(6)), a wool or textile product may be labelled as containing cashmere only if the following criteria are met:
* such wool product is the fine (dehaired) undercoat fibers produced by a cashmere goat (&quot;Capra hircus laniger&quot;);
* the average diameter of the fiber of such wool product does not exceed 19 microns; and
* such wool product does not contain more than 3 percent (by weight) of cashmere fibers with average diameters that exceed 30 microns.
* the average fiber diameter may be subject to a coefficient of variation around the mean that shall not exceed 24 percent.

== Types of fiber ==
* Raw – fiber that has not been processed and is essentially straight from the animal
* Processed – fiber that has been through the processes of de-hairing, washing, carding, and is ready either to spin or to knit/crochet/weave
* Virgin – new fiber made into yarns, fabrics or garments for the first time
* Recycled – fibers reclaimed from scraps or fabrics that were previously woven or felted and may or may not have been previously used by the consumer from various parts of the world.

== The world cashmere industry ==

Mongolia supplies 9,600 tons of raw cashmere per year to the world. 15% of the total raw cashmere supplied by Mongolia is being used to manufacture finished goods whereas the remaining 85% is being exported in semi processed form. 70% of the total raw material used to produce finished garments in Mongolia is being procured by Gobi Corporation with the remaining 30% being used by other producers in Mongolia.

The global fashion luxury cashmere clothing market is expected to reach US$4.2 billion in 2025, growing at an annual rate of 3.86% per year between 2018 and 2025.

== History ==
Cashmere has been manufactured in Mongolia, Nepal and Kashmir for thousands of years. The fiber is also known as &quot;pashm&quot; (Persian for &quot;wool&quot;) or &quot;pashmina&quot; (Persian/Urdu word derived from Pashm) for its use in the handmade shawls of Kashmir. References to woolen shawls appear in texts surviving from between the 3rd century BC and the 11th century AD. However, a popular notion in Kashmir is that it was the 15th-century ruler of Kashmir, Zain-ul-Abidin, who founded the local wool industry by bringing weavers from Turkestan. Another local tradition sees the founder of all Kashmiri crafts in the famous 14th century saint Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani who, tradition goes, brought 700 craftsmen from Persia to Kashmir. When Ali Hamadani visited Ladakh he discovered for the first time in history the warmth and fineness of Ladakh goat wool. He combed some goat wool and made a pair of socks with his own hands. Afterwards he gifted those socks to the king of Kashmir, Sultan Qutubdin (1374-89 AD). Sultan was amazed by their durability and fineness. Ali Hamadani brought some raw goat wool from Ladakh and suggested the king to start shawl weaving in Kashmir. That was the starting point of the usage of the cashmere wool.

Trading in commercial quantities of raw cashmere between Asia and Europe began with Valerie Audresset SA, Louviers, France, claiming to be the first European company to commercially spin cashmere. The down was imported from Tibet through Kazan, the capital of the Russian province of Volga, and was used in France to create imitation woven shawls. Unlike the Kashmir shawls, the French shawls had a different pattern on each side. The imported cashmere was spread out on large sieves and beaten with sticks to open the fibers and clear away the dirt. After opening, the cashmere was washed and children removed the coarse hair. The down was then carded and combed using the same methods used for worsted spinning.

In the 18th and early 19th centuries, Kashmir (then called cashmere by the British) had a thriving industry producing shawls from goat down imported from Tibet and Tartary through Ladakh. The down trade was controlled by treaties signed as a result of previous wars The Shawls were introduced into western Europe when General Napoleon Bonaparte sent one to Paris from his campaign in Ottoman Egypt. The shawl&#x27;s arrival is said to have created an immediate sensation and plans were put in place to start manufacturing the product in France.

In 1799 at his factory in Reims, William-Louis Ternaux, the leading woolens manufacturer in France under Napoleon, began to produce imitation India shawls (&quot;cachemires&quot;) using the wool of Spanish merino sheep. By 1811, with government assistance, Ternaux also began experimenting with the production of real India shawls using what he called &quot;laine de Perse&quot;, i.e., the down (&quot;duvet&quot;) of Tibetan-cashmere goats. In 1818, Ternaux resolved to help establish herds of cashmere goats in France. A famous expedition to Persia was organized, led by the orientalist and diplomat Pierre Amédée Jaubert, to be financed in part by the French government. Of the acquired herd of 1,500 animals, only 256 arrived safely in the spring of 1819 at Marseilles and Toulon via the Crimea. About 100 of the cashmere goats were then purchased by the French government (at 2,000 francs each) and sent to the royal sheep farm at Perpignan. The remainder, about 180 including new-borns, went to Ternaux&#x27;s property at Saint-Ouen outside Paris. Although Ternaux had little success getting small farmers to add cashmeres to their sheep herds, a few wealthy landowners were willing to experiment with the goats. For example, Ternaux&#x27;s herd was seen in 1823 by C.T.Tower of Weald Hall, Essex, England. Tower purchased two female and two male goats and took them back to England, wherein 1828 he was awarded a gold medal by the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce for rearing a herd of cashmeres. Also, a few of Ternaux&#x27;s goats were purchased for a model farm at Grignon, near Versailles, run by M. Polonceau. Polonceau crossbred the cashmeres with Angora goats to improve the down for spinning and weaving. This Cashmere-Angora herd was seen by William Riley of New South Wales in 1828, and again in 1831 when Riley purchased thirteen of the goats for trans-shipment to Australia. At the time, the average production of the Polonceau herd was 16 ounces (500 grams) of down. Ternaux&#x27;s herd at St. Ouen still numbered 150 when the famous industrialist died in 1833. The herd at Perpignan died out by 1829.

By 1830, weaving cashmere shawls with French-produced yarn had become an important Scottish industry. The Scottish Board of Trustees for the Encouragement of Arts and Manufactures offered a 300 pound sterling reward to the first person who could spin cashmere in Scotland based on the French system. Captain Charles Stuart Cochrane collected the required information while in Paris and received a Scottish patent for the process in 1831. In the autumn of 1831, he sold the patent to Henry Houldsworth and sons of Glasgow. In 1832 Henry Houldsworth and sons commenced the manufacture of yarn, and in 1833 received the reward.

Dawson International claim to have invented the first commercial dehairing machine in 1890, and from 1906 they purchased cashmere from China, but were restricted to purchasing fiber from Beijing and Tianjin until 1978. In 1978 trade was liberalised and Dawson International began buying cashmere from many provinces.

Many early textile centers developed as part of the American Industrial Revolution. Among them, the Blackstone Valley became a major contributor to the American Industrial Revolution. The town of Uxbridge, Massachusetts, became an early textile center in the Blackstone Valley which was known for the manufacture of cashmere wool and satinets.

Austrian Textile Manufacturer Bernhard Altmann is credited with bringing cashmere to the United States of America on a mass scale beginning in 1947.

Attempts to improve Afghanistan&#x27;s cashmere industry by importing Italian goats in the 2010s have been criticized as wasteful.

==Criticism of industry==

The production of cashmere wool has been criticized for the detrimental environmental effects directly resulting from raising the herds. The high demand for cashmere is causing grasslands in China and Mongolia to disappear, air pollution to increase and the herds to starve. Factories in Alashan are forced to close several days a week due to water rationing as the deserts there expand by 400 square miles per year. As of 2016, the degradation of 65% of the grasslands in the area has been linked to a four-degree Fahrenheit increase in the temperature of Mongolia, three degrees higher than temperatures in other areas of the world. With proper management, the grasslands could recover in the space of ten years. Mitigation efforts include changing trades, grazing bans, hand-feeding the goats, and attempting to convince Mongolian herders to raise yaks or camels instead of or in addition to fewer goats, as the hair from these animals is also valuable and their impact on grasslands is less.

Air pollution, caused by the combination of industrial heavy burning of coal creating atmospheric particulates, and the desert dust storms resulting from disappearing grasslands in China and Mongolia, crosses the Pacific Ocean to the Americas. Health officials in Canada, China, Mongolia and the US have had to issue air quality warnings to the public.

The demand for the fiber has caused some vendors, both knowingly and not, to sell yarns or textiles containing little to no cashmere representing themselves as being composed of cashmere. Wool and other fibers have been mixed in by unscrupulous manufacturers, deliberately selling mislabeled items to well-known department stores. Complaints of mislabeling after testing for cashmere content were reported by the Cashmere and Camel Hair Manufacturers Institute to the Federal Trade Commission, leading to more stringent examination of cashmere products.

As part of achieving Cradle to Cradle &quot;gold&quot; certification for its clothing, in January 2023, fashion brand Ralph Lauren announced it would provide shipping labels to return cashmere clothes of any brand to be recycled by Re-Verso in Tuscany.

<text>In statistics and social sciences, an antecedent variable is a variable that cannot help to explain the apparent relationship (or part of the relationship) between other variables that are nominally in a cause and effect relationship. In a regression analysis, an antecedent variable would be one that influences both the independent variable and the dependent variable.

<doc id="497465" wikidata="Q317312" url="?curid=497465" title="Kalamalka Lake">
<text>Kalamalka Lake ( &quot;Kal Lake&quot;) is a large lake in the interior plateau of southern central British Columbia, Canada, east of Okanagan Lake. The lake is located approximately south of the city of Vernon and is its main drinking water supply. The lake is named after the Okanagan (&quot;Okanogan&quot; U.S. spelling) First Nation chief who occupied its northern shores.

At different times of the year the colour of the lake can range from cyan to indigo, in different parts at the same time, earning the lake the moniker &quot;lake of a thousand colours&quot;. The colour of the water is derived from light scattering, caused by the precipitation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3).

==Hydrology==
Kalamalka Lake is an oligotrophic, monomictic marl lake with high alkalinity and hardness. From fall to spring the entire water column mixes and is thermally stratified in May through early November. During periods of warmer weather and increasing photosynthesis of phytoplankton, calcium, carbonate ions, and phosphorus in the water column precipitate, changing the colour of the water and increasing the turbidity. As a result, calcium carbonate on vegetation at the shore and Charophytes may be present.

The main inflow is from Wood Lake located to the south and connected by a canal at Oyama. The lake is drained by Vernon Creek which exits at the north end, passes through the city of Vernon, and flows into the Okanagan Lake.

==Tourism==

Kalamalka Lake has several beaches. Kal Beach and Cosens Bay Beach are in the heart of Kalamalka Lake Provincial Park. Some of the other beaches on this lake are Jade Bay Beach, Juniper Bay Beach, Kekuli Bay Beach, Kirkland Park Beach, and on the south end, Kaloya Regional Park Beach.

Two provincial parks are situated along Kalamalka Lake, Kalamalka Lake Provincial Park and Protected Area (4209 ha) and Kekuli Bay Provincial Park (57 ha).

There are many resorts on the lake including Tween Lakes Resort and Klub Kal. Kalamalka Lake receives very little fishing pressure and is used mostly for recreational boating and water skiing. Tween Lakes Resort is currently the only marina on the lake with a fuel dock.

<text>The Open University of Sri Lanka (OUSL; , ) is a national university in Sri Lanka. It is unique within the Sri Lankan national university system for being the only university to offer programs of study leading to certificate, diploma, degrees and postgraduate degrees up to PhD level through the Open and Distance Mode of Learning (ODL). The degrees awarded by the university are treated as equivalent to degrees awarded by any other Sri Lankan University under the preview of the University Grants Commission.

The OUSL Main Campus and Colombo regional centre (C010) is located in Colombo in Nawala, Nugegoda. There are 8 regional centers in addition to main campus at Nawala. They are:

The Open University of Sri Lanka is currently ranked as No.9 among Sri Lankan Universities and No. 6353 among international Universities.

==Establishment and history==
The concept of establishing the Open University of Sri Lanka was by Dr. Nissanka Wijeyeratne the Cabinet Minister of Education &amp; Higher Education at the time.

As Cabinet Minister of Education and Higher Education, Wijeyeratne introduced the Universities Act No 16 of 1978 to Parliament. The University of Ceylon was the only university in Ceylon from 1942 until 1978. As a result of this Act, it was separated into five independent universities: University of Colombo, University of Peradeniya, University of Sri Jayewardenepura, University of Kelaniya and University of Jaffna. He also proposed the establishment of the University of Ruhuna and the Open University of Sri Lanka .

The university was set up by the Government of Sri Lanka under the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978, for the purpose of providing higher educational opportunities to working adults – providing them the road to success, surpassing age, vocation, gender, race, ethnicity and religion. The OUSL has the same legal and academic status as any other national university in Sri Lanka.

The university policy on admission would enable a person to register at the lowest &#x27;Level&#x27; with mere basic literacy and then climb up to postgraduate level.

The concept of Distance Education at the OUSL functions through a dynamic network of regional and study centres, with knowledge imparted through multiple media. Therefore, students with work commitments are able to pursue studies since they interact with especially designed self-instructional materials where the materials function as a &quot;Tutor in Print&quot;. This method provides the distance learner with the best possible learning opportunity to enable a balancing of personal, work related and academic obligations.

==Admission==
The open university of Sri Lanka has unique admission procedure and criteria for various study programmes.

Any Sri Lankan citizen above 18 years 
Of age can apply for the university and there are no upper age limit.

The university as &quot; The peoples university&quot; provide opportunity to climb up certificate level to PhD level and multiple entry and multiple outing options at various study levels.

*Level 06 - Honours degree.
*Level 05 - General degree.
*Level 04 - Advanced diploma.
*Level 03 - Diploma.
*Level 02 - Advanced certificate.

For the degree progammes, the minimum requirement is three simple passes at G.C.E. advanced level examination. the university does not consider their Z scores or marks received at General common test. The open university of Sri Lanka accepts both Local and London AL results. In addition to ALs some professional degrees require recognized professional diploma for the admission. Several degree programmes started after a selection test while other programmes don&#x27;t.

People who are not carrying Advanced level qualifications, can join with their G.C.E. Ordinary level qualifications to an Advanced certificate programme (degree foundation programmes) at Study Level 02 which is equivalent to G.C.E Advanced levels
And SLQF level 02 .After successful completion of an advanced certificate programme, candidates can join with their desired degree or diploma programmes.

All students are Guided and supported by counselling sessions and orientation programmes before registration and throughout the programme. 70% -80% of course fee are sponsored by the government of Sri Lanka.

The university also offers certificate programmes at level 01 
And Short courses at level 0 in various fields.

There are unique educational courses called &quot;Continuous education courses (CE)&quot; where an individual can continue his or her studies further without registering for a regular degree or diploma programmes.

==Student activities==

===Students Unions===
&quot;Open University Students Unity&quot; to protect students rights.

==Studying at OUSL==

The distance learning methodology adopted by the OUSL may initially appear as a challenging task to students. In addition to gaining subject knowledge and skills, students develop many other life skills, including, self-organization, and time management. Regular lectures, a feature of face-to-face teaching at a conventional university, is minimal at the OUSL. Instead, students learn through with other forms of support that facilitate learning.

* Study package

The OUSL adopts a multimedia system for teaching with a strong emphasis on distance learning. The study system supports the students through printed course material, audio visual aids, discussions, day schools, tutor clinics, lab and field works, industry visits, web-based learning, etc. Continuous assessments and final examinations are also integral parts of the study system.

Printed course material is the center element in the study package. Improving reading skills is therefore essential to be successful as an OUSL student. Where applicable, students will also be provided with other supportive material applicable to a course, such as study guides, practical guides, audio visual material, etc. Printed course materials are carefully prepared to suit self study and independent learning. The printed course materials provide the students the subject knowledge of the course. The clearly outline the objectives of the course and what the student will be able to achieve by studying the course. Self-assessment questions and activities included in the course material will enable the learners to continuously assess themselves as they proceed. Printed course materials are normally provided at the time of registration for a programme/course.

==OUSL vocabulary==

Once become a student of the OUSL, student need to be familiar with the OUSL terminology. It is important that student understand these terms clearly and be vigilant of these, since most are related to student&#x27;s performance in studies.

A Programme of study consists of a combination of compulsory and optional courses, which leads to a certificates, certificate of advanced study, diploma, degree or a postgraduate degree.

A Stand Alone Course is a course which can be considered as a separate entity. These courses can be offered by any person who wishes to upgrade the knowledge in a particular subject area, without registering for a regular programme of study, such as a Degree/Certificate Programme. many courses of the Degree Programmes are offered as Stand Alone Courses.

Continuing education courses are offered for students registered for regular programmes of study who wish to widen their knowledge in areas of their choice These include support courses, such as Mathematics, English, Computer literacy, etc. A student can offer a limited number of continuing education courses, over and above the maximum workload allowed during an academic year.

Advanced certificate in Science (ACS) and Advanced certificate in Social sciences(ACSS) are courses offered for those who lack academic qualifications equivalent to that of G.C.E Advanced Level in Sri Lanka. Thus, these are particularly suited for students who lack direct entry requirements for the Degree Programme.it is two-year course equals to 12 &amp; 13 grades of G.C.E Advanced level classes .

===Credit Rating===

Programmes as well as courses carry a credit rating. The &#x27;Credit Rating&#x27; is the expression used in the OUSL to denote the &quot;Academic value&quot; of a course/programme. Please note that the word &quot;credit&quot; does not imply any measure of academic performance at an examination such as Credit Pass at G.C.E O/L or A/L Examination. The Credit rating gives a measure of the time expected to be spent on studying the course. At the OUSL, one credit is about 45 hours of study time. The time specified for a course involved, including reading and understanding course material, face-to-face sessions, continuous assessments, final examinations, consultation of reference materials, practical classes, etc.

The credit rating of a programme increases progressively, with Certificates usually being 36 credits, a Diploma 90 credits and Undergraduate Degrees comprising 150 or 177 credits, depending on whether degree is a three or four-year programme.

The credit rating of courses also vary. The minimum credit rating of courses presently offered by the Faculty of Natural Sciences is 3. Average total time expected to be spent on a 3 credit course is around 135 hours. In actual study time, this would mean a student is expected to spend 5 hours per week on average, for a 3 credit course that is offered during one year (30 weeks ).

The maximum workload a student may undertake in an academic year is 45 credits. A student may register for a maximum of 2 programmes in the OUSL. However, both programmes should be 45 credits, This corresponds approximately to the workload undertaken in an academic year by a full-time student in conventional university. Many students, who are either employed or with other commitments find it difficult to spend this much of time for their studies and handle this full workload. Students are therefore strongly advised not to register for more than 27 credits especially in their first year of study.

===Course Code===
Each course offered by the university is assigned a course code. This code includes certain components of identification that uniquely identifies the course. The particular subject area/discipline is one component of identification used when assigning course codes. The course code also informs the Program of Study for which the course is offered and the level of study at which it is offered. Courses for undergraduate degrees are offered at Levels 3,4,5, and 6, whilst Courses in Foundation are offered at Level 2. In assigning course codes, the program of study is identified by a &quot;letter&quot; and the level of study is by a &quot;digit&quot;.

Incorporating all of the above components, each course is assigned a course code consisting of 7 alphanumeric characters. The &quot;first three letters&quot; indicate the area of discipline and the program of study. The &quot;first digit&quot; reflects the level of study, the &quot;second digit&quot; multiplied by 3 will give the credit rating. the &quot;last two digits&quot; give a unique serial number for the course.

==Support for Learning through Personal Tutors==
Each student is assigned a personal tutor/counselor during the pre-registration orientation sessions of some programs. The Personal Tutor will guide the students and provide greater awareness about the university, the study system and other particulars regarding the program of study.

Students are also reminded that it is mandatory to get the registration forms certified by the Personal Tutor before coming for registration.

==Day Schools==
Day Schools are interactive sessions where the student will get the opportunity to meet the respective course teachers to clarify any difficulty they come across in their study material. Attendance at day schools is not compulsory. However, attending a day school well prepared will immensely help students perform well in the courses. Day schools are held almost at all Regional Centers and the students have the option of attending a Day school held at a center of their choice.
Study centres situated all over the island are facilitated to self - study and evaluation of OUSL students.

Tutor clinics are normally held just before the end of semester final exams as an additional help for students preparing for final exams.

==Online Support &amp; MyOUSL==
In order to give the students additional help and also to familiarize them with modern learning trends and tools, some courses are supplemented with an online component. The online activities could be accessed from home or from the National Online Distance Education Service Access Centers (NAC centers) located at centers specified in Regional centers. Once the student register for a course with an online component, student will be further advised on how to access and use it.

Through MyOUSL, the link , students may access online moodle courses, personal details, timetables, payment details, submit final exam applications, etc..

The university has the entire idea of Open and Distant Learning system. And surely Online Support and MyOUSL is very helpful for the students.

Centre for Gender Equity and Eaquality :

==Library==
The OUSL operates a network of libraries comprising the main library at Central Campus, Nawala and 5 other main regional centers. In addition, there are small libraries in each of the Study Centers. The Main library is open for students from 8.30 am to 6.30 pm on each day including week-ends except Full Moon Poya Days and University holidays. The regional center libraries are open during working hours each day, except on Sundays and Mondays.

The main library is well equipped with a substantial collection of books in a wide variety of subjects and many foreign and local journals. The main library is also operates a fully equipped Audio Visual Resource Center (AVRC) with a substantial collection of videos, audios, to supplement print material. The AVRC provides internet facilities for study purposes of students.

In-house photocopying facilities are also available at very nominal rates for the convenience of all library users. The facility of getting inter-library loan of books, journals, and video films is also available. The library has copies of past examination papers, which are also available on the university website. Students are advised to read the library information sheets available at all libraries for more details on the facilities provided and how to make use of them.

==Financial Assistant through Scholarships and Bursaries==
The Open University of Sri Lanka provides a limited number of bursaries administered by the university and Mahapola Scholarships administered under the Mahapola Trust. Both the Bursaries and Scholarships are offered under the two schemes – merit and need. The main criterion for a merit scholarship is the overall student performance at Final Exams. Guidelines for the Bursaries and Mahapola Scholarships and further information are available with the Assistant Registrar of the each Faculty.

<doc id="497468" wikidata="Q11223803" url="?curid=497468" title="IBM 8100">
<text>The IBM 8100 Information System, announced Oct. 3, 1978, was at one time IBM’s principal distributed processing engine, providing local processing capability under two incompatible operating systems (DPPX and DPCX) and was a follow-on to the IBM 3790.

The 8100, when used with the Distributed Processing Programming Executive (DPPX), was intended to provide turnkey distributed processing capabilities in a centrally controlled and managed network.

It never saw much success—one anonymous source, according to &quot;PC Magazine&quot;, called it a &quot;boat anchor&quot;—and became moribund when host-based networks went out of fashion.
This, coupled with IBM&#x27;s recognition that they had too many hardware and
software systems with similar processing power and function,
led to announcement in March 1986 that the 8100 line
would not be expanded and a new System/370 compatible processor line, ES/9370,
would be provided to replace it.
In March 1987, IBM announced that it intended to provide in 1989
a version of DPPX/SP that would run on the new ES/9370.
A formal announcement followed in March 1988
of DPPX/370, a version of DPPX that executed on the
ES/9370 family of processors.
DPPX/370 was made available to customers in December 1988.

DPCX (Distributed Processing Control eXecutive) was mainly to support a word processing system, &quot;Distributed Office Support Facility&quot; (DOSF).

==Architecture==
The 8100 was a 32-bit processor, but its instruction set
reveals its lineage as the culmination of a line of
so-called Universal Controller processors internally designated
UC0 (8-bit), UC.5 (16-bit) and UC1 (32-bit).
Each processor carried along the instruction set and architecture
of the smaller processors,
allowing programs written for a smaller processor to run on a larger one
without change.

The 8100 had another interesting distinction in being one of the first commercially available systems to have a network with characteristics of what we now call local area networks, in particular the mechanism of packet passing. It was called the &quot;8100 Loop&quot; or &quot;R-Loop&quot; and it supported various attached terminals (such as the 3104), printers (such as the free-standing 3268-1) and other devices. Topologically this arranged terminals in a ring, with redundant sets of wires which allowed for a break in the wire to be tolerated simply by &quot;turning back&quot; the data on each side of the break.

The 8100 also supported an &quot;intelligent&quot; terminal called the 8775 (which shared the same case as the 3279 colour display terminal for IBM&#x27;s mainframes and, like the 3279 was designed at IBM&#x27;s UK Development Lab at Hursley Park, England) which was the first to ship with the ability to download its functionality from the host computer to which it was attached.

==Product range==
*8130 (various models) - Processor unit
*8140 (various models) - Processor unit
*8150 (various models) - Processor unit
*8101 - External disk unit
*8809 - External tape unit

What was notable about the machines was that they were designed to be &quot;office-friendly&quot;, not requiring special power supplies or cooling systems, and running quietly. Their size also made them attractive in this environment.

==Post mortem==
In 1983, Computer Automation, Inc. offered a trade-in program for IBM 8100 users, in exchange for a CA-Syfa system. The offer was to accommodate those who purchased &quot;two or three&quot; 8100s for program development, and encountered too many obstacles.

Its central feature is a two-lane road that extends 444 miles (715 km) from Natchez, Mississippi, to Nashville, Tennessee. Access to the parkway is limited, with more than 50 access points in Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee. The southern end of the route is in Natchez at its intersection with Liberty Road, and the northern end is northeast of Fairview, Tennessee, in the suburban community of Pasquo, at an intersection with Tennessee State Route 100. In addition to Natchez and Nashville, larger cities along the route include Jackson and Tupelo, Mississippi, and Florence, Alabama.

== Maintenance ==
The road is maintained by the National Park Service and has been designated an All-American Road. Commercial traffic is prohibited along the entire route, and the speed limit is , except north of Leiper&#x27;s Fork, Tennessee, and Ridgeland, Mississippi, where the speed limit is reduced to . The total area of the parkway is , of which are federal and are not.

Unlike the older Blue Ridge Parkway in Virginia and North Carolina, the Natchez Trace Parkway does feature direct interchanges with Interstate Highways.

The parkway is headquartered in Tupelo and has nine district offices: Leipers Fork, Meriwether Lewis, Cherokee, Tupelo, Dancy, Kosciusko, Ridgeland, Port Gibson, and Natchez. The parkway also manages two battlefields: Brices Cross Roads National Battlefield Site and Tupelo National Battlefield.

==History==

===Footpath===
The gentle sloping and curving alignment of the current route closely follows the original foot passage. Its design harkens back to the way the original interweaving trails aligned as an ancient salt lick-to-grazing pasture migratory route of the American bison and other game that moved between grazing the pastures of central and western Mississippi and the salt and other mineral surface deposits of the Cumberland Plateau. The route generally traverses the tops of the low hills and ridges of the watershed divides from northeast to southwest.

Native Americans, following the &quot;traces&quot; of bison and other game, further improved this walking trail for foot-borne commerce between major villages located in central Mississippi and middle Tennessee. The route is locally circuitous, but by traversing this route, the bison, and later humans, avoided the endless, energy-taxing climbing and descending of the many hills along the way. Also avoided was the danger to a herd (or groups of human travelers) of being caught &quot;en masse&quot; at the bottom of a hollow or valley if attacked by predators. The nature of the route, to this day, affords good all-around visibility for those who travel it. At all times, the road is on the high ground of the ridge dividing the watersheds and provides a view to either see or catch the scent of danger, from a distance great enough to afford the time to flee to safety, if necessary.

By the time of European exploration and settlement, the route had become well known and established as the fastest means of communication between the Cumberland Plateau, the Mississippi River, and the Gulf of Mexico settlements of Pensacola, Mobile, and New Orleans. In the early post-American Revolutionary War period of America&#x27;s (south) westward expansion, the trace was the return route for American flat-boat commerce between the territories of the upper and lower Ohio, Tennessee, and Cumberland River valleys. The Americans constructed flat boats, loaded their commerce therein, and drifted upon those rivers, one-way south-southwestward to New Orleans, Louisiana. They would then sell their goods (including the salvageable logs of the flat boats and including enslaved people), and return home via the trace (for the middle section of their return trip), to as far away as Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Improved communications (steam boats, stagecoach lines, and railroads) and the development of ports along the rivers named above (e.g., Natchez; Memphis, Tennessee; Paducah, Kentucky; Nashville, Tennessee; and Louisville, Kentucky) made the route obsolete as a means of passenger and freight commerce. As a result, no major population centers developed along the trace, because of its alignment, between its termini in Nashville and Natchez. The two cities of note, near or on the trace&#x27;s alignment (Jackson and Tupelo, Mississippi), developed only as a result of their alignment along axes of communication different from the trace. Thus, the trace and its alignment are today almost entirely undeveloped and unspoiled along its whole route. Many sections of the original footpath are visible today for observing and hiking the parkway&#x27;s right-of-way.

The Natchez Trace National Scenic Trail includes five sections of hiking and horse-riding trails.

===Civilian Conservation Corps===

Construction of the parkway was begun by the federal government in the 1930s, one of the many projects of the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression. The road was the proposal of U.S. Congressman T. Jeff Busby of Mississippi, who proposed it as a way to give tribute to the original Natchez Trace. Inspired by the proposal, the Daughters of the American Revolution began planting markers and monuments along the trace. In 1934, the Franklin Delano Roosevelt administration ordered a survey. President Roosevelt signed the legislation to create the parkway on May 18, 1938. Construction on the Parkway began in 1939, and the route was to be overseen by the National Park Service. Its length includes more than 45,000 acres (182 km2) and the towering Natchez Trace Parkway Bridge in Williamson County, Tennessee, completed in 1994 and one of only two post-tensioned, segmental concrete-arch bridges in the world.

The Emergency Appropriations Act of June 19, 1934, allocated initial construction funds and established it as a parkway under National Park Service by the act of May 18, 1938.

===Gaps and completion===

For many years in the later 20th century, most of the trace had been complete, but owing to a lack of funds, two gaps remained, both in Mississippi. One was a several-mile-long bypass of Jackson, between Interstate 55 at Ridgeland and Interstate 20 at Clinton. The other was between Liberty Road in the city of Natchez and U.S. Highway 61 near Washington. These final two segments were finally completed and opened on May 21, 2005.

In 2013, a new law required the National Park Service (NPS) to convey about 67 acres of property in the Natchez Trace Parkway to the State of Mississippi. It also adjusted the boundaries of the parkway to include 10 additional acres. The two pieces of land in question originally belonged to Mississippi and were donated to the NPS when it was trying to determine where to end the Natchez Trace Parkway.

==Historical sites==
Numerous historical sites on the Parkway include the Meriwether Lewis Museum, the refurbished Mount Locust stand, Historic French Camp, MS, and the Mississippi Craft Center in Ridgeland, Mississippi, which focuses on promoting Mississippi&#x27;s native art. Between the Parkway and Old Port Gibson Road is the ghost town of Rocky Springs that thrived in the late 19th century. The old Rocky Springs Methodist Church, the cemetery, and several building sites still exist and are accessible from the parkway. Cypress Swamp is located at mile post 122. Also, several cascading waterfalls can be viewed; for access, some require a bit of hiking from the parkway. Besides, parts of the original trail are still accessible. The history of the Natchez Trace, including the parkway, is summarized at the Natchez Trace Visitor Center in Tupelo.

Emerald Mound, the second-largest Native American ceremonial mound in the United States, is located just west of the trace and north of Highway 61 near Natchez. It offers a unique look at the ingenuity and industry of native culture. Two smaller mounds rise from the top of the main mound and rise above treetops, offering a wide view. Travelers can reach Emerald Mound with a five-minute detour from the main trace highway. Emerald Mound measures by at the base and is in height. The mound was built by depositing earth along the sides of a natural hill, thus reshaping it and creating an enormous artificial plateau.

The Ackia Battleground National Monument (established August 27, 1935, and now called Chickasaw Village) and Meriwether Lewis Park (proclaimed as Meriwether Lewis National Monument February 6, 1925, and transferred from the War Department August 10, 1933) were added to the parkway by the act of August 10, 1961.

<doc id="497476" wikidata="Q2557460" url="?curid=497476" title="Welcome Interstate Managers">
<text>Welcome Interstate Managers is the third studio album by the American rock band Fountains of Wayne. It was released by S-Curve Records on June 10, 2003. The album contains the power pop single &quot;Stacy&#x27;s Mom,&quot; which reached number 21 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming the band&#x27;s highest-charting hit in the United States.

==Background==
Fountains of Wayne was at a low point following the under-performance of 1999&#x27;s &quot;Utopia Parkway&quot;, which led to them getting dropped by their then-label, Atlantic Records. The period when they were without a label was particularly hard on lead singer and co-songwriter Chris Collingwood. According to bassist and co-songwriter Adam Schlesinger in 2005, &quot;I think Chris felt especially bummed during that whole period. He just sort of felt that we worked for a really long time and it didn&#x27;t really add up to anything. And it didn&#x27;t seem like the future had much in the way of promise. Chris wasn&#x27;t writing a lot. I don&#x27;t know if it was the whole thing of being in between labels but more just the whole thing of putting all that time into it and feeling it tapering off.&quot;

Eventually Schlesinger convinced Collingwood to start writing and recording &quot;because it was the only way that I could get Chris to want to be a part of it. I was just like, &#x27;Hey look, let&#x27;s just go in and do like we have always done when we were 18. If we have a song we like, we&#x27;ll just record it and eventually we&#x27;ll see if we have an album&#x27;.&quot; By mid-2001, Fountains of Wayne had discussed plans for a new album.

Meanwhile, the band got in touch with several prospective labels, but balked at their insistence that the band record demos for consideration to be signed. According to Schlesinger, &quot;We talked to a bunch of record companies before we had anything recorded. And everybody was like, &#x27;Well we really like your band but we need to hear what you&#x27;re working on. Do you have any demos or anything?&#x27; And we didn&#x27;t want to make demos. We just found that kind of demeaning. But we were sort of at the point where we could have gone and made demos. And it was like, you know, for God&#x27;s sake we&#x27;ve been doing this so long, we&#x27;re not going to make a demo tape. We&#x27;re just gonna go make a record and that&#x27;s what we did.&quot;

==Recording==
Fountains of Wayne commenced recording their new album without any label support. According to drummer Brian Young, &quot;Adam put up the money to do the recording, we converged in a studio in upstate New York, and we didn’t know what to expect. We all showed up with basically nothing. I had a stick bag, and the engineer mentioned to me, &#x27;You know, it would’ve been a lot cooler if you showed up with nothing at all.&#x27; We were kind of going through the studio basement, looking for gear and taping stands together. It was funny.&quot;

Once the album was finished, Fountains of Wayne signed to S-Curve Records, whose executive vice president, Steve Yegelwel, had first signed the band when he was working as an A&amp;R at Atlantic Records. Prior to the album&#x27;s release, the band went on tour in November 2002 to road test the new material and build up fan anticipation for the new record.

==Release and reception==

The album was met with commercial success and favorable reviews, citing the album&#x27;s catchy song structures and well-crafted lyrics reflecting struggles of the middle class lifestyle in the American East Coast. The album is widely regarded as the band&#x27;s best effort and a prime example of early 2000s power pop. Review aggregating website Metacritic reports a weighted average score of 86 out of 100 based on 24 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

The lead single &quot;Stacy&#x27;s Mom&quot; was released on May 20, 2003 to popular and critical success.

&quot;Valley Winter Song&quot; was used in a 2008 L.L. Bean Commercial.

The album was first pressed to vinyl for Record Store Day Black Friday in a limited run in 2020.

==Covers==
In 2009, Katy Perry performed a cover of &quot;Hackensack&quot; on &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;, which was later released digitally.

In 2011, the band The Wonder Years performed a cover of &quot;Hey Julie&quot; for the charity compilation album, &quot;Vs. the Earthquake&quot;.

<text>The Martin Marietta Corporation was an American company founded in 1961 through the merger of Glenn L. Martin Company and American-Marietta Corporation. In 1995, it merged with Lockheed Corporation to form Lockheed Martin.

==History==
Martin Marietta formed in 1961 by the merger of the Glenn L. Martin Company and American-Marietta Corporation.

Martin, based in Baltimore, was primarily an aerospace concern with a recent focus on missiles, namely its Titan program. This program was established in 1955 when the company secured the U.S. Air Force contract to build the country&#x27;s second intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). American-Marietta was headquartered in Chicago and produced paints, dyes, metallurgical products, construction materials, and other goods.

In 1982, Martin Marietta was subject to a hostile takeover bid by the Bendix Corporation, headed by William Agee. Bendix bought the majority of Martin Marietta shares and in effect owned the company. However, Martin Marietta&#x27;s management used the short time separating ownership and control to sell non-core businesses and launch its own hostile takeover of Bendix (known as the Pac-Man defense). Thomas G. Pownall, CEO of Martin Marietta, was successful and the end of this extraordinarily bitter battle saw Martin Marietta survive; Bendix was bought by Allied Corporation.
