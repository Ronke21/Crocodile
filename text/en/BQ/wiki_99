<text>The Boston Brahmins, or Boston elite, are members of Boston&#x27;s historic upper class. From the late 19th century through the mid-20th century, they were often associated with a cultivated New England accent, Harvard University, Anglicanism, and traditional British-American customs and clothing. Descendants of the earliest English colonists are typically considered to be the most representative of the Boston Brahmins. They are considered White Anglo-Saxon Protestants (WASPs).

== Etymology ==

The phrase &quot;Brahmin Caste of New England&quot; was first coined by Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., a physician and writer, in a January 1860 article in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;. The term &quot;Brahmin&quot; refers to the privileged, priestly caste within the four castes in the Hindu caste system. By extension, it was applied in the United States to the old wealthy New England families of British Protestant origin that became influential in the development of American institutions and culture. The influence of the old American gentry has been reduced in modern times, but some vestiges remain, primarily in the institutions and the ideals that they championed in their heyday.

== Characteristics ==
The nature of the Brahmins is referenced in the doggerel &quot;Boston Toast&quot; by Holy Cross alumnus John Collins Bossidy:

Many 19th-century Brahmin families of large fortune were of common origin; fewer were of an aristocratic origin. The new families were often the first to seek, in typically British fashion, suitable marriage alliances with those old aristocratic New England families that were descended from land-owners in England to elevate and cement their social standing. The Winthrops, Dudleys, Saltonstalls, Winslows, and Lymans (descended from English magistrates, gentry, and aristocracy) were, by and large, happy with this arrangement. All of Boston&#x27;s &quot;Brahmin elite&quot;, therefore, maintained the received culture of the old English gentry, including cultivating the personal excellence that they imagined maintained the distinction between gentlemen and freemen, and between ladies and women. They saw it as their duty to maintain what they defined as high standards of excellence, duty, and restraint. Cultivated, urbane, and dignified, a Boston Brahmin was supposed to be the very essence of enlightened aristocracy. The ideal Brahmin was not only wealthy, but displayed what was considered suitable personal virtues and character traits.

The Brahmin were expected to maintain the customary English reserve in dress, manner, and deportment, and cultivate the arts, support charities such as hospitals and colleges, and assume the role of community leaders. Although the ideal called on him to transcend commonplace business values, in practice many found the thrill of economic success quite attractive. The Brahmins warned each other against avarice and insisted upon personal responsibility. Scandal and divorce were unacceptable. This culture was buttressed by the strong extended family ties present in Boston society. Young men attended the same prep schools, colleges, and private clubs, and heirs married heiresses. Family not only served as an economic asset, but also as a means of moral restraint.

Most belonged to the Unitarian or Episcopal churches, although some were Congregationalists or Methodists. Politically, they were successively Federalists, Whigs, and Republicans. They were marked by their manners and once distinctive elocution. Their distinctive Anglo-American manner of dress has been much imitated and is the foundation of the style now informally known as preppy. Many of the Brahmin families trace their ancestry back to the original 17th- and 18th-century colonial ruling class consisting of Massachusetts governors and magistrates, Harvard presidents, distinguished clergy, and fellows of the Royal Society of London, a leading scientific body, while others entered New England aristocratic society during the 19th century with their profits from commerce and trade, often marrying into established Brahmin families.

<text>The Volksbühne (&quot;People&#x27;s Theatre&quot;) is a theater in Berlin. Located in Berlin&#x27;s city center Mitte on Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz (Rosa Luxemburg Square) in what was the GDR&#x27;s capital. It has been called Berlin&#x27;s most iconic theatre.

== About ==
The Volksbühne was built during the years 1913 to 1914 and was designed by Oskar Kaufmann, with integrated sculpture by Franz Metzner, who had both previously collaborated on the Ufa-Pavillon am Nollendorfplatz cinema in 1912–1913. It opened on December 30, 1914 and has its origin in an organization known as the &quot;Freie Volksbühne&quot; (&quot;Free People&#x27;s Theater&quot;) founded in 1890 by Bruno Wille and Wilhelm Bölsche, which sketched out the vision for a theatre &quot;of the people&quot; in 1892. The goal of the organization was to promote the naturalist plays of the day at prices accessible to the common worker. The original slogan inscribed on the edifice was &quot;Die Kunst dem Volke&quot; (&quot;The art to the people&quot;). Two of the earlier artistic directors were the innovative Max Reinhardt from 1915 to 1918, and during the Weimar Republic the socio-political theatre reformer Erwin Piscator in 1924–1927.

During World War II, the theatre was heavily damaged like much of the rest of Berlin. From 1950 to 1954, it was rebuilt according to the designs of architect .

Frank Castorf became director in 1992. During his 25-year tenure, through mid 2017, the theater&#x27;s ambitious, experimental productions, brought it worldwide recognition as a leading European venue.

In 2015 the City of Berlin announced that Castorf would be replaced by Chris Dercon in 2017. The following September, left-wing activists occupied the theater, protesting the Volksbühne&#x27;s new programmatic direction. As a result, Dercon resigned in April 2018 after what was considered by many to have been a commercially and artistically weak period for the theater.

Afterward, Klaus Dörr temporarily took over the leadership of the Volksbühne, intending to serve for an interim period. On March 15, 2021, Berlin’s Senator for Culture, Klaus Lederer, and Klaus Dörr mutually agreed to end his tenure.

René Pollesch, a playwright and director considered to be one of the leading and most influential voices of post-dramatic theatre in Germany, assumed the position of Artistic Director of the Volksbühne in 2021. Pollesch passed away unexpectedly in February 2024.

After a year-long search, Berlin&#x27;s government announced Matthias Lilienthal as the Volksbühne&#x27;s new artistic director in February 2025, joined by an artistic board of choreographers Florentina Holzinger and Marlene Monteiro Freitas. Lilienthal, who worked as chief dramaturg at the Volksbühne between 1991 and 1998 under Frank Castorf, previously led the HAU - Hebbel am Ufer and the Münchner Kammerspiele. The new leadership team will begin their tenure in August 2026.

<text>The term amphibolism () is used to describe a biochemical pathway that involves both catabolism and anabolism. Catabolism is a degradative phase of metabolism in which large molecules are converted into smaller and simpler molecules, which involves two types of reactions. First, hydrolysis reactions, in which catabolism is the breaking apart of molecules into smaller molecules to release energy. Examples of catabolic reactions are digestion and cellular respiration, where sugars and fats are broken down for energy. Breaking down a protein into amino acids, or a triglyceride into fatty acids, or a disaccharide into monosaccharides are all hydrolysis or catabolic reactions. Second, oxidation reactions involve the removal of hydrogens and electrons from an organic molecule. Anabolism is the biosynthesis phase of metabolism in which smaller simple precursors are converted to large and complex molecules of the cell. Anabolism has two classes of reactions. The first are dehydration synthesis reactions; these involve the joining of smaller molecules together to form larger, more complex molecules. These include the formation of carbohydrates, proteins, lipids and nucleic acids. The second are reduction reactions, in which hydrogens and electrons are added to a molecule. Whenever that is done, molecules gain energy.

The term amphibolic was proposed by B. Davis in 1961 to emphasise the dual metabolic role of such pathways. These pathways are considered to be central metabolic pathways which provide, from catabolic sequences, the intermediates which form the substrate of the metabolic processes.

== Reactions exist as amphibolic pathway ==
All the reactions associated with synthesis of biomolecule converge into the following pathway, viz., glycolysis, the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain, exist as an amphibolic pathway, meaning that they can function anabolically as well as catabolically.

Other important amphibolic pathways are the Embden-Meyerhof pathway, the pentose phosphate pathway and the Entner–Doudoroff pathway.

=== Embden-Meyerhoff ===

The Embeden–Meyerhof pathway and the Krebs cycle are the centre of metabolism in nearly all bacteria and eukaryotes. They provide not only energy but also precursors for biosynthesis of macromolecules that make up living systems.

=== Citric acid cycle ===
The citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle) is a good example of an amphibolic pathway because it functions in both the degradative (carbohydrate, protein, and fatty acid) and biosynthetic processes. The citric acid cycle occurs on the cytosol of bacteria and within the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells. It provides electrons to the electron transport chain which is used to drive the production of ATP in oxidative phosphorylation. Intermediates in the citric acid cycle, such as oxaloacetate, are used to synthesize macromolecule constituents such as amino acids, e.g. glutamate and aspartate.

The first reaction of the cycle, in which oxaloacetate (a four-carbon compound) condenses with acetate (a two-carbon compound) to form citrate (a six-carbon compound) is typically anabolic. The next few reactions, which are intramolecular rearrangements, produce isocitrate. The following two reactions, namely the conversion of D-isocitrate to α-Ketoglutarate followed by its conversion to succinyl-CoA, are typically catabolic. Carbon dioxide is lost in each step and succinate (a four-carbon compound) is produced.

There is an interesting and critical difference in the coenzymes used in catabolic and anabolic pathways; in catabolism NAD+ serves as an oxidizing agent when it is reduced to NADH. Whereas in anabolism the coenzyme NADPH serves as the reducing agent and is converted to its oxidized form NADP+.

Citric acid cycle has two modes that play two roles, the first being energy production produced by the oxidative mode, as the acetyl group of acetyl-coA is fully oxidized to CO2. This produces most of the ATP in the metabolism of aerobic heterotrophic metabolism, as this energy conversion in the membrane structure (cytoplasmic membrane in bacteria and mitochondria in eukaryotes) by oxidative phosphorylation by moving electron from donor (NADH and FADH2) to the acceptor O2. Every cycle give 3 NADH, 1 FADH2, CO2 and GTP. The second role is biosynthetic, as citric acid cycle regenerate oxaloacetate when cycle intermediates are removed for biosynthesis.

=== Pentose phosphate pathway ===
The pentose phosphate pathway gets its name because it involves several intermediates that are phosphorylated five-carbon sugars (pentoses). This pathway provides monomers for many metabolic pathways by transforming glucose into the four-carbon sugar erythrose and the five-carbon sugar ribose; these are important monomers in many metabolic pathways. Many of the reactants in this pathway are similar to those in glycolysis, and both occur in cytosol. The ribose-5-phosphate can be transported into the nucleic acid metabolism, producing the basis of DNA and RNA monomers, the nucleotides. In meristematic cells, large amounts of DNA must be produced during the S-phase of a short cell cycle; this pathway is an extremely important part of the metabolism of these cells. In these cells, the pentose phosphate pathway is active and shifted in favor of ribose production.

=== Entner-Doudoroff pathway ===
The Entner-Doudoroff pathway is a glycolytic pathway that is considered the second pathway used for carbohydrates used by certain microbes. In this process, glucose-6-phosphate is oxidized through 6-phosphogluconate to pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, with the concomitant reduction of NADP. By conventional glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate oxidation to pyruvate, one NAD is reduced and a net one ATP is formed. In that pathway, for every glucose molecule there is an &quot;investment&quot; of one ATP molecule and a yield of two ATP and two pyruvate molecules and one NADH. The difference between the glycolytic used by humans and this pathway is that the latter requires one ATP to yield two ATP and two pyruvates as a net of only one NADPH produced and one ATP result (from substrate-level phosphorylation), and the former requires two ATP molecules to yield four ATP and two pyruvate molecules per glucose as a net of two ATP molecules.

== Regulation ==
The cell determines whether the amphibolic pathway will function as an anabolic or catabolic pathway by enzyme–mediated regulation at a transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. As many reactions in amphibolic pathways are freely reversible or can be bypassed, irreversible steps that facilitate their dual function are necessary. The pathway uses a different enzyme for each direction for the irreversible step in the pathway, allowing independent regulation of catabolism and anabolism. Due their inherent duality, amphibolic pathways represent the regulation modes of both anabolic by its negative feedback end product and catabolic by feedback by energy indicator sequences.

<doc id="509363" wikidata="Q5015847" url="?curid=509363" title="Cabrini–Green Homes">
<text>Cabrini–Green Homes are a Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) public housing project on the Near North Side of Chicago, Illinois. The Frances Cabrini Rowhouses and Extensions were south of Division Street, bordered by Larrabee Street to the west, Orleans Street to the east and Chicago Avenue to the south, with the William Green Homes to the northwest.

At its peak, Cabrini–Green was home to 15,000 people, mostly living in mid- and high-rise apartment buildings. Crime and neglect created hostile living conditions for many residents, and &quot;Cabrini–Green&quot; became a metonym for problems associated with public housing in the United States. In 1995, CHA began tearing down dilapidated mid- and high-rise buildings, with the last demolished in 2011. Today, only the original two-story rowhouses remain.

The area has seen major redevelopment due to its proximity to downtown, resulting in a combination of upscale high-rises and townhouses, with some units being CHA-owned, creating a mixed-income neighborhood.

==Layout and demographics==
The construction reflected the urban renewal approach to United States city planning in the mid-20th century. The extension buildings were known as the &quot;Reds&quot; for their red brick exteriors, while the Green Homes, with reinforced concrete exteriors, were known as the &quot;Whites&quot;. Many of the high-rise buildings originally had exterior porches (called &quot;open galleries&quot;). According to the CHA, the early residents of the Cabrini row houses were predominantly of Italian ancestry. By 1962, however, a majority of residents in the completed complex were African Americans.

==History==

In 1850 shanties were first built on low-lying land along Chicago River; the population was predominantly Swedish, then Irish. The area acquired the &quot;Little Hell&quot; nickname due to a nearby gas refinery, which produced shooting pillars of flame and various noxious fumes. By the 20th century, it was known as &quot;Little Sicily&quot; due to large numbers of Sicilian immigrants.
In 1929 Harvey Zorbaugh wrote &quot;The Gold Coast and the Slum: A Sociological Study of Chicago&#x27;s Near North Side&quot;, contrasting the widely varying social mores of the wealthy Gold Coast, the poor Little Sicily, and the transitional area in between. Marshall Field Garden Apartments, the first large-scale (although funded through private charity) low-income housing development in area, was completed.
In 1942 Frances Cabrini Homes (two-story rowhouses), with 586 units in 54 buildings by architects Holsman, Burmeister, et al., were completed. Initial regulations stipulated 75% White and 25% Black residents. (Named for Saint Frances Cabrini, an Italian-American nun who served the poor and was the first American to be canonized.)
In 1957 the Cabrini Homes Extension (red brick mid- and high-rises), with 1,925 units in 15 buildings by architects A. Epstein &amp; Sons, was completed.
In 1962 William Green Homes (1,096 units, north of Division Street) by architects Pace Associates was completed. (Named for William Green, longtime president of the American Federation of Labor.)
In 1966: &quot;Gautreaux et al. vs. Chicago Housing Authority&quot;, a lawsuit alleging that Chicago&#x27;s public housing program was conceived and executed in a racially discriminatory manner that perpetuated racial segregation within neighborhoods, was filed. CHA was found liable in 1969, and a consent decree with HUD was entered in 1981.
On February 8, 1974 the sitcom &quot;Good Times&quot;, ostensibly set in the Cabrini–Green projects (though the projects were never actually referred to as &quot;Cabrini-Green&quot; on camera), and featuring shots of the complex in the opening and closing credits, debuted on CBS. It ran for six seasons, until August 1, 1979.
From March 26 – April 19, 1981 Mayor Jane Byrne moved into Cabrini–Green to prove a point regarding Chicago&#x27;s high crime rate. The move is considered a publicity stunt, and she stayed just three weeks.
In 1992 the horror film &quot;Candyman&quot; was released, the story taking place at the housing project.
In 1994 Chicago received one of the first HOPE VI (Housing Opportunities for People Everywhere) grants to redevelop Cabrini–Green as a mixed-income neighborhood.
On September 27, 1995 demolition began.
In 1997 Chicago unveiled Near North Redevelopment Initiative, a master plan for development in the area. It recommends demolishing Green Homes and most of Cabrini Extension.
In 1999 Chicago Housing Authority announced Plan for Transformation, a plan to spend $1.5 billion over ten years to demolish 18,000 apartments and build and/or rehabilitate 25,000 apartments. Earlier redevelopment plans for Cabrini–Green are included in the Plan for Transformation. New library, rehabilitated Seward Park, and new shopping center open.
On December 9, 2010 the William Green Homes complex&#x27;s last standing building closed.
On March 30, 2011 the last high-rise building was demolished, with a public art presentation commemorating the event. The majority of Frances Cabrini Homes row houses remain intact, although in poor condition, with some having been abandoned.

==Overview ==

Cabrini–Green was composed of 10 sections built over a 20-year period: the Frances Cabrini Rowhouses (586 units in 1942), Cabrini Extension North and Cabrini Extension South (1,925 units in 1957), and the William Green Homes (1,096 units in 1962) (see Chronology below). As of May 3, 2011, all the high-rise buildings had been demolished. One hundred and fifty of the dilapidated Frances Cabrini Rowhouses (south of Oak Street, north of Chicago Avenue, west of Hudson Avenue, and east of Cambridge Street) have been renovated and remain inhabited.

== Crime and response ==

===Problems develop===
Poverty and organized crime have long been associated with the area: a 1931 &quot;map of Chicago&#x27;s gangland&quot; by Bruce-Roberts, Incorporated notes Oak Street and Milton Avenue (now Cleveland Avenue) as &quot;Death Corner&quot; (captioned &quot;50 murders: count &#x27;em&quot;). At first, the housing was integrated and many residents held jobs. This changed in the years after World War II, when the nearby factories that provided the neighborhood&#x27;s economic base closed and thousands were laid off. At the same time, the cash-strapped city began withdrawing crucial services like police patrols, transit services, and routine building maintenance.

Lawns were paved over to save on maintenance, failed lights were left for months, and apartments damaged by fire were simply boarded up instead of rehabilitated and reoccupied. Later phases of public housing development (such as the Green Homes, the newest of the Cabrini–Green buildings) were built on extremely tight budgets and suffered from maintenance problems due to the low quality of construction. As with the Robert Taylor Homes, low construction budgets, combined with a desire to fit the maximum possible number of units in the project led to design decisions that made the towers extremely unpleasant and unappealing places to live. Rather than interior hallways, units in many of the later-phase buildings were accessed via exterior walkways made of bare concrete and enclosed with chain-link fencing. This meant that residents would be exposed to the elements any time they left their units to go to other sections of the building, a dangerous prospect during Chicago&#x27;s severely cold winters.

Unlike many of the city&#x27;s other public housing projects such as Rockwell Gardens or Robert Taylor Homes, Cabrini-Green was situated in an affluent part of the city. The poverty-stricken projects were actually constructed at the meeting point of Chicago&#x27;s two wealthiest neighborhoods, Lincoln Park and the Gold Coast. Less than a mile to the east sat Michigan Avenue with its high-end shopping and expensive housing. Specific gangs controlled individual buildings, and residents felt pressure to ally with those gangs in order to protect themselves from escalating violence.

During the worst years of Cabrini-Green&#x27;s problems, vandalism increased substantially. Gang members and other vandals covered interior walls with graffiti and damaged doors, windows, and elevators. Rat and cockroach infestations were commonplace, rotting garbage stacked up in clogged trash chutes (it once piled up to the 15th floor), and basic utilities (water, electricity, etc.) often malfunctioned and were left in disrepair.

On the exterior, boarded-up windows, burned-out areas of the façade, and pavement instead of green space—all in the name of economizing on maintenance—created an atmosphere of decay and government neglect. The balconies were fenced in to prevent residents from emptying garbage cans into the yard, and from falling or being thrown to their deaths. This created the appearance of a large prison tier, or of animal cages, which further enraged community leaders of the residents.

===Brother Bill===

In the 1980s, a Catholic lay worker, William &quot;Brother Bill&quot; Tomes Jr., frequently visited Cabrini–Green in an effort to stop the violence. His efforts received national attention, and he was interviewed by &quot;Time&quot; magazine and several television networks.

===Tenant activism===
Residents organized over the years both to pressure the city for assistance and to protect and support each other. Community leader Marion Stamps was the most visible Cabrini tenant to organize strikes and protests against the Chicago Housing Authority, Mayor of Chicago and many others on behalf of Cabrini residents from the 1960s until her death in 1996. In 1996, the federal government mandated the destruction of 18,000 units of public housing in Chicago (along with tens of thousands of other units nationwide).

Some Cabrini–Green tenant activists organized to prevent themselves from becoming homeless and to protect what they and their supporters saw as a right to public housing for the city&#x27;s poorest residents. The activists succeeded in obtaining a consent decree guaranteeing that some buildings will remain standing while the new structures are built, so that tenants can remain in their homes until new ones are available. The document also guarantees displaced Cabrini residents a home in the new neighborhood.

In 2001, a tenants group sued the CHA over relocation plans for displaced residents of Cabrini–Green under the city&#x27;s Plan for Transformation, a $1.4 billion blueprint for public housing renewal. Richard Wheelock, an attorney representing the tenants, said the authority&#x27;s demolition program had outpaced its reconstruction program, thus leaving families with their own responsibilities to find options beyond equally dangerous and segregated areas elsewhere in the city, or simply to become homeless.

In 1997, the same year as the attack on Girl X, community leaders formed the Alliance for Community Peace for &quot;mentoring and recreation to area youth&quot; which later expanded citywide.

===Recent history and plans===
While Cabrini–Green was deteriorating during the postwar era, causing industry, investment, and residents to abandon its immediate surroundings, the rest of Chicago&#x27;s Near North Side underwent equally dramatic upward changes in socioeconomic status. First, downtown employment shifted dramatically from manufacturing to professional services, spurring increased demand for middle-income housing; the resulting gentrification spread north along the lakefront from the Gold Coast, then pushed west and eventually crossed the river.

Then, in the 1980s, the Lower North Side industrial area just across the river from the Loop, west of Michigan Avenue, and south of Near North Side&#x27;s Cabrini–Green was transformed into the &quot;River North&quot; neighborhood, a focus of arts and entertainment, now home to the city&#x27;s technology sector. By the 1990s, developers had converted thousands of acres of former industrial lands near the north branch of the Chicago River (and directly north, south, and west of the former Cabrini–Green projects) to lucrative office, retail, and housing developments.

Over time, Cabrini–Green&#x27;s location became increasingly desirable to private developers. Speculators began purchasing property immediately adjacent to the projects, with the expectation that the complex would eventually be demolished. Finally, in May 1995, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) took over management of the CHA and almost immediately began demolishing the first of the vacant &quot;Reds&quot; buildings in Cabrini Extension, intending to make Chicago a showpiece of a new, mixed-income approach to public housing. Shortly thereafter, in June 1996, the city of Chicago and the CHA unveiled the Near North Redevelopment Initiative, which called for new development on and around the Cabrini–Green site. Under a ten-year Plan for Transformation, which was officially enacted in 2000, the city plans to demolish almost all of its high-rise public housing, including much of Cabrini–Green, except for a few of the run-down row houses, which tentatively remain.

Demolition of Cabrini Extension was completed in 2002. Part of the site was added to Seward Park, and construction of new, mixed-income housing on the remainder of the site began in 2006. Subsidized development of mixed-income housing on vacant or underused parcels adjacent to Cabrini–Green, including a long-shuttered Oscar Mayer sausage factory, the former headquarters of Montgomery Ward, and an adjacent senior housing project named Orchard Park, began in 1994.

New market-rate housing now almost completely surrounds the remaining public housing. Cabrini–Green once housed 15,000 residents. New housing built on the Cabrini–Green site will include 30% public-housing replacement homes and 20% &quot;workforce affordable&quot; housing, while many adjacent developments (almost all targeted at luxury buyers) include 20% affordable housing, half targeted as public-housing replacement, with a goal of 505 replacement units built off-site.

In February 2006, a unique partnership between CHA, Holsten, Kimball Hill Urban Centers and the Cabrini–Green LAC Community Development Corporation began a 790-unit, $250-million redevelopment of the Cabrini Extension site, to be called Parkside at Old Town. Plans completed the demolition of Green Homes in 2011, while the majority of Cabrini&#x27;s dilapidated row houses are abandoned and slated for demolition and future redevelopment. The Plan for Transformation&#x27;s relocation process was the subject of a lawsuit, &quot;Wallace v. Chicago Housing Authority&quot;, which alleged that many residents were hastily forced into substandard, &quot;temporary&quot; housing in other slums, did not receive promised social services during or after the move, and were often denied the promised opportunity to return to the redeveloped sites.

The lawsuit was settled in June 2006, as the parties agreed to two relocation programs for current and former CHA residents: (1) CHA&#x27;s current relocation program, encouraging moves to racially integrated areas of metropolitan Chicago and providing for case-managed social services, would be applied to families initially moving from public housing; and (2) an agreed-upon modified program run by CHA&#x27;s voucher administrator, CHAC Inc., would encourage former CHA residents to relocate to economically and racially integrated communities as well as give them increased access to social services.

Some former CHA residents have moved out of Chicago to nearby south suburbs such as Harvey or to other housing developments in nearby cities. New residents have successfully moved into CHA replacement housing, and to date, residents of the mixed-income developments have reported fewer crime related problems. The last two families in Cabrini–Green were forced out by a federal judge&#x27;s decree on December 1, 2010.

Crime dramatically decreased in the area since the closure of Cabrini-Green; in the first half of 2006, only one murder occurred. Demolition of Cabrini–Green continued slowly and was completed in 2011. Plaintiffs in &quot;Wallace&quot; and others allege that CHA&#x27;s hasty removal of residents has exacerbated socioeconomic and racial segregation, homelessness, and other social ills that the Plan for Transformation aimed to address by forcing residents to less-visible but still impoverished neighborhoods, largely on the south and west sides of the city.

Retail chain Target has built on the site at Division and Larrabee Streets, formerly occupied by 1230 N. Larrabee Street and 624 W. Division Street high-rises of the Green Homes. The new address is at 1200 N. Larrabee, and it opened to the public in October 2013.

==Reputation==

Though Chicago has had a number of notorious public housing projects, including the Robert Taylor Homes and Stateway Gardens on the South Side, and Rockwell Gardens and the Henry Horner Homes on the West Side, Cabrini–Green&#x27;s name and its problems were the most publicized, especially beyond Chicago. Cabrini–Green often gained press coverage for its chaotic New Year&#x27;s Eve celebrations when gang members fired handguns into the air, causing police to block off nearby streets every year. Several infamous incidents contributed to Cabrini–Green&#x27;s reputation.

An unanticipated result of the steel fencing installed to secure the previously open gangways at Cabrini–Green was that it became difficult for Chicago police officers to see through the steel mesh from outside. On July 17, 1970, Chicago police patrolman Anthony N. Rizzato and Sergeant James Severin were shot and killed by gang members while patrolling community housing for an all-volunteer &quot;Walk and Talk&quot; project. As the officers proceeded across the Cabrini–Green baseball field, the assailants opened fire from an apartment window. The purpose of the shooting was to seal a pact between two rival gangs. Both officers were killed in the attack. Three adults and one juvenile were later charged with murder. The two shooters were sentenced to 100–199 years in prison for two counts of murder. In 1981, the gang killings of 11 made national attention.

In March 1981, in an effort to demonstrate a commitment to making the complex safer, then-Chicago Mayor Jane Byrne moved into a fourth-floor apartment in the 1160 N. Sedgwick Street building with her husband. Backed by a number of police officers and a substantial personal bodyguard presence, she stayed for only three weeks, and this incident contributed to public perception of Cabrini–Green as the worst of the worst of public housing. As a security measure, the rear entryway of the unit Byrne stayed in was welded shut. This had the impact of creating a fortification for gang members when Byrne left. Many other gangs copied this technique in other units.

On October 13, 1992, seven-year-old Dantrell Davis was shot in the head and killed by a sniper&#x27;s bullet while walking to Jenner Elementary School with his mother.

On January 9, 1997, a nine-year-old girl nicknamed &quot;Girl X&quot; was raped, poisoned, and strangled in a stairwell of the 1121 N. Larrabee Street building, leaving her permanently blind, paralyzed, and mute due to brain damage. The attacker used a marker to scrawl gang symbols on her abdomen in an attempt to mislead any investigation and left her for dead, face down in the snow, in the dangerously unlit corridor to be found by a janitor who quit the same day. Patrick Sykes, a neighboring 25-year-old male who was not a gang member, was later apprehended by police, gave a detailed confession, and was sentenced to the state maximum of 120 years in prison.

Two Chicago reporters soon indicted the Chicago community&#x27;s indifference to its living conditions and cited Girl X, and her case was contrasted with that of the white and affluent JonBenét Ramsey. Girl X testified in a court case four years after the attack. The judge, Joseph Urso, awarded the family a $3 million payment by the Chicago Housing Authority on the grounds of negligence of maintenance and security of the facility, with the money dedicated to the child&#x27;s long-term care.

Though many non-residents regarded Cabrini–Green with almost unalloyed horror, long-term residents interviewed by a &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reporter in 2004 described mixed feelings about the end of the Cabrini–Green era. They told the reporter that, in the face of their hardships living in such squalor, many residents had developed bonds of community and mutual support. They lamented the uprooting and scattering of that community, and worried about what would become of the residents who were being relocated to make way for urban redevelopment. Despite the terrible conditions in the complex, rents were extremely low and the site was close to the prosperous downtown and lakefront neighborhoods to the east, allowing very low income residents access to neighborhoods which would otherwise be impossible for them to afford. Local Little League baseball coach Daniel Coyle wrote a book &quot;Hardball: A Season in the Projects&quot; (1994), summarizing the blight and violence as &quot;That&#x27;s the story of Cabrini. A well-meaning person shows up three times a week. But nothing changes.&quot; The movie &quot;Hardball&quot;, released in 2001, was based on the book.

==Education==

Chicago Public Schools (CPS) operates public schools in the area around Cabrini-Green. Most of the Cabrini–Green teenagers attended William H. Wells High School, Waller High School (now known as Lincoln Park High School), also serves area students. Near North Career Metropolitan High School, located at Larrabee and Blackhawk, evolved from Cooley Vocational High School and served area students from 1979 until 2001.

At Cabrini–Green&#x27;s height when over 15,000 residents lived in the neighborhood, there were five neighborhood elementary schools operated by Chicago Public Schools serving the neighborhood: Richard E. Byrd Community Academy, Jenner Academy of the Arts, Manierre School, Schiller Community Academy, and Truth School.

In the 1970–1971 school year, there were 6,144 students attending five grade schools in Cabrini-Green: Cooley Upper Grade Center, and Byrd, Jenner, Manierre, and Schiller elementary schools. By 1997, Cooley Upper had closed, and by that year the combined enrollment of the remaining four schools was 2,361. Between the 1970s and 1997, two high-rise buildings were demolished, family sizes decreased, more apartment units became vacant, and the demographic makeup of residents became more proportionately of adults. As of 2008, only three of the schools remain in use. , only Manierre and Jenner remained as K–8 schools.

===K–8 schools===
Cabrini-Green is served by Ogden International School, which has its preschool and middle school campus in the Cabrini-Green area. Prior to 2018, the building housed the standalone K–8 school Jenner Academy of the Arts (K–8). In 2016, it had 239 students, 98% African-American and almost all low income; its building capacity was 1,060. Enrollment had declined after Cabrini-Green was demolished. Jenner began the process of merging into Ogden International.

In the 2010s, CPS considered merging Jenner and Manierre together, but concerns involving students crossing gang territorial lines meant that both schools remained open. Manierre is in &quot;Sedville&quot;, a gang territory area in Old Town. , it is considered a low performing school.

During the 2003–2004 school year, fifth-grade students from Room 405 at Richard E. Byrd Community Academy developed a comprehensive action plan to push the City of Chicago and the Chicago Board of Education to fulfill an old promise of building a new school for the community. They cited that their school had no lunchroom, no gym, and no auditorium. The heat often did not work and students were forced to wear hats, gloves, and coats in the classroom, among many other inadequacies. As they researched reasons for the decrepit and shameful conditions of their school, they examined issues related to equality in school funding.

To further their cause and implement their plan, the young activists wrote letters and emails, surveyed, petitioned, interviewed legislators, developed and produced a DVD, video documentaries, and a website in an effort to &quot;get the word out&quot; and garner support in hopes of seeing the new school built. Their fight for the new building garnered local and national attention. In 2004, Byrd students were rezoned to Jenner and Byrd closed. As of 2008, the school&#x27;s students have transferred to other schools in the Chicago area and the school has been left vacant.

Freidrich von Schiller School served the William Green Homes. Initially it occupied two buildings at 640 West Scott Street; one was built circa 1963 and the other was about one century old. In 1969, the city approved the site for the new Schiller. It was planned as a two-building campus on a plot of land, with an expected cost of $2.5 million. It was scheduled to open in September 1970. Initially the school was to designate one of its buildings as a &quot;Schome&quot; (meaning &quot;school-home&quot;) for preschool children while another building was to house elementary grades. The campus was scheduled to have a capacity of 1,635. In 2009, Schiller closed and students were redirected to Jenner. Skinner North, a selective enrollment (or &quot;test-in&quot;) school, occupies the building formerly held by Schiller Elementary.

==Parks and recreation==
The YMCA opened the New City YMCA in 1981. It was built windowless so it would not suffer from stray bullets, a product of crime in the neighborhood. The YMCA&#x27;s clientele included people in Cabrini-Green and in Lincoln Park. CBS Chicago 2 stated that the facility was &quot;once credited with breaking down a barrier between families from&quot; different socioeconomic communities. In 2007, the YMCA closed, with the land sold, as Cabrini Green&#x27;s impoverished community moved away. The YMCA shifted its focus and planned to open a new facility in Kelly Hall of the Mission of Our Lady of the Angels in Humboldt Park.

<text>Baron Vivian, of Glynn and of Truro in the County of Cornwall, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom and held by a branch of the Vivian family. It was created on 19 August 1841 for the soldier Sir Hussey Vivian, 1st Baronet. He had already been created a baronet, of Truro in the County of Cornwall, on 19 January 1828. His eldest legitimate son, the second Baron, represented Bodmin in the House of Commons and served as Lord Lieutenant of Cornwall. His son, the third Baron, served as British Ambassador to Italy from 1891 to 1893. The latter&#x27;s great-grandson, the sixth Baron, was a soldier and a Conservative member of the House of Lords. Lord Vivian was one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that were allowed to remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999. As of 2014 the titles are held by his only son, the seventh Baron, who succeeded in 2004.

Sir Robert Vivian, illegitimate son of the first Baron, was also a prominent soldier. Another member of the Vivian family was Henry Vivian, 1st Baron Swansea. He was the nephew of the first Baron. Lord Swansea&#x27;s younger brother was Sir Arthur Vivian.

The traditional residence of the Barons Vivian was Glynn House near Cardinham, Cornwall, purchased and first lived in by the 1st Baron Vivian.

A number of Vivian family graves with Celtic-style headstones can be found at the Parish Church of St Winnow.

<text>The U.S. state of Oregon is home to more than 200 breweries and brew pubs that produce a large variety of beer.

==History==
Many sources credit Swiss-born Henry Saxer and his Liberty Brewery as being Oregon&#x27;s first commercial brewery (supposedly opening in 1852); however, the first verifiable record of a brewery in Oregon is an advertisement in the August 5, 1854, issue of &quot;The Weekly Oregonian&quot; for Charles Barrett&#x27;s Portland Brewery and General Grocery Establishment.
* 1862 – After working at and later owning several smaller breweries, Henry Weinhard purchased and expanded Liberty Brewery which was later renamed City Brewery.
* 1914 – Five years before national prohibition was established, the voters of Oregon approved a statewide ban on the manufacture, sale or advertisement of intoxicating liquor.
* 1933 – Oregon and the nation ratified the 21st Amendment.
* 1985 – Oregon Legislature legalized brewpubs.

According to a 2014 report by the Beer Institute, Oregon had 208 breweries, a number exceeded by only three states – California (with 509 breweries), Washington (251), and Colorado (217). As of July 2015, Oregon was home to 234 brewing facilities operated by 194 brewing companies. There are also many nanobreweries in Oregon. Many breweries have won nationwide and international acclaim.

Alongside brewing, hops have a historical presence in Oregon. Hop production in Oregon began in 1867 when William Wells planted his first crop in Buena Vista, Oregon. This grew throughout the 20th century, when Oregon was dubbed the &quot;Hop Center of the World&quot; for its production around Independence, Oregon, in Polk County. Hop production later saw some decline due to mildew and mechanical picking technology; however, Oregon remains the second largest hop producing state in the US.

Oregon State University began planting and experimenting with hops as early as 1893. Dr. Alfred Haunold influenced modern and popular hop varieties through his work with food studies. The Fermentation Science Program established itself in 1995 and further aided the study of hops and brewing at Oregon State, followed by the creation of the Oregon Hops and Brewing Archives in 2013.

The Oregon Brewers Guild was established in 1992 to promote Oregon breweries; it is the second-oldest nonprofit brewer trade association in the United States.

==Breweries==
The following are some Oregon-based breweries. The list includes some large brewing companies that have regional or national distribution. Oregon also has many mid-size and small breweries. Most of them produce kegs of beer to be served on draft at taverns and restaurants. Many of them also package their beer in bottles or cans. Some production breweries have taprooms where patrons can drink the beer that is produced onsite. And some breweries are brewpubs – full-service restaurants that brew their own beer.

==Festivals==
The Oregon Brewers Festival the largest gathering of independent craft brewers in the United States.

The Gold Beach Brew &amp; Art Festival is always held the Saturday after Labor Day. It is the oldest brew festival in southern Oregon and on the Oregon Coast.

Oregon is host to several other beer oriented festivals throughout the year, each with their own unique focus and feel.

== Homebrewing ==
F.H. Steinbart is a homebrew supply store on SE 12th Avenue in Portland, Oregon. It is the oldest homebrew supply store in the country and helped nurture the vibrant Pacific Northwest craft-brewing scene. President Jimmy Carter signed HR 1337 into law in 1978, which legalized homebrewing at the federal level. In the years that followed, many commercial brewers began as homebrewer customers who were introduced to the company by buying supplies there – the Widmers and McMenamins brothers were customers.

Owner John DeBenedetti helped establish the Oregon Brew Crew in 1980; it is Oregon&#x27;s largest active homebrew club and meets monthly in the FH Steinbart warehouse.

<text>Bromus tectorum, known as downy brome, drooping brome or cheatgrass, is a winter annual grass native to Europe, southwestern Asia, and northern Africa, but has become invasive in many other areas. It now is present in most of Europe, southern Russia, Japan, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Iceland, Greenland, North America and western Central Asia. In the eastern US &quot;B. tectorum&quot; is common along roadsides and as a crop weed, but usually does not dominate an ecosystem. It has become a dominant species in the Intermountain West and parts of Canada, and displays especially invasive behavior in the sagebrush steppe ecosystems where it has been listed as noxious weed. &quot;B. tectorum&quot; often enters the site in an area that has been disturbed, and then quickly expands into the surrounding area through its rapid growth and prolific seed production.

The reduction of native plants and the increased fire frequency caused by &quot;B. tectorum&quot; prompted the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to examine if the greater sage-grouse needed to be listed as a threatened or endangered species due to habitat destruction. After the review was completed by the USFWS, Secretarial Order 3336 was signed with the goal of reducing the threat of rangeland fires and preserve habitat by reducing downy brome.

Research has shown that ecosystems with a healthy biological soil crust and native plant community will be resistant to &quot;B. tectorum&quot; invasion. In areas where &quot;B. tectorum&quot; is invasive treatments that are being researched/used by land managers to control &quot;B. tectorum&quot; include seeding of native plants and non-native bunch-grasses to out compete &quot;B. tectorum,&quot; herbicides, and prescribed burns. The effectiveness of these treatments is tightly linked to the timing of the water availability at the site. With precipitation shortly after herbicide and seeding treatments increasing the success, and overall high precipitation increases &quot;B. tectorum&quot; growth, causing the treatment effects to be statistically insignificant. 
==Description==
&quot;Bromus&quot; comes from a Greek word for a type of oat, and &quot;tectorum&quot; comes from &quot;tector&quot; which means overlaying and &quot;tectum&quot; which means roof. &quot;Bromus tectorum&quot; is a winter annual grass native to Eurasia usually germinating in autumn, overwintering as a seedling, then flowering in the spring or early summer. &quot;B. tectorum&quot; may be mistaken for a bunchgrass because it may send up shoots that give it the appearance of having a rosette. In areas where it is growing in dense stands the plants will not form this rosette like structures, but instead are single-culmed (stalked).

The stems are smooth (glabrous) and slender. The leaves are hairy (pubescent) and have sheaths that are separate except at the node where the leaf attaches to the stem. It typically reaches tall, though plants as small as may produce seed. The flowers of &quot;B. tectorum&quot; are arranged on a drooping panicle with approximately 30 spikelets with awns and five to eight flowers each. It is cleistogamous (self pollinating, non-opening flower) with no evident out-crossing. &quot;B. tectorum&quot; has a fibrous root system with few main roots that does not reach more than a foot into the soil, and has wide-spreading lateral roots that make it efficient at absorbing moisture from light precipitation episodes. A study showed that it had the capability to reduce soil moisture to the permanent wilting point (minimal soil moisture required for a plant not to wilt) to a depth of , reducing competition from other species.

===Seeds===
The seeds ripen and disperse in the late spring and early summer. They are dispersed by wind, small rodents, or attachment to animal fur, within a week of maturity. They are also moved as a contaminant in hay, grain, straw, and machinery. &quot;Bromus tectorum&quot; is an abundant seed producer, with a potential in excess of 300 seeds per plant; seed production per plant is dependent on plant density. Under optimal conditions, &quot;B. tectorum&quot; may produce 450 kg of seed per hectare (400 pounds per acre) with about 330,000 seeds/kg (150,000 seeds/pound). As the seed of &quot;B. tectorum&quot; ripen the plant goes from green to purple to straw-colored.

&quot;B. tectorum&quot; seeds demonstrate rapid germination as soon as the seed lands in appropriate conditions. If winter rainfall is limiting and germination is inhibited, but spring moisture is adequate, then seeds will germinate in the spring, and the plants will flower that summer. The seeds maintain high viability (ability to germinate under optimal conditions) in dry storage, lasting over 11 years. In the field, under buried conditions, seeds will lose their viability in 2–5 years. Seeds can withstand high soil temperatures, and the primary limit to germination is inadequate moisture. Germination is best in the dark or in diffuse light. They germinate most quickly when covered with soil, but do not need to be in contact with bare soil. Some leaf litter cover will generally improve germination and establishment of seedlings. Seedlings emerge rapidly from the top 2.5 cm (1&quot;) of soil, and a few plants emerge from depths of 8 cm (3&quot;), but not from seeds 10 cm (4&quot;) below the surface.

==Taxonomy==
The scientific name of &quot;Bromus tectorum&quot; was given to the species by Carl Linnaeus in &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; which was published in 1753. According to Plants of the World Online it has 57 synonyms including four that were reclassification into another genus. It has no accepted varieties.

==Habitat==
&quot;Bromus tectorum&quot; grows in many different climates. It is found primarily in the precipitation zone. It will grow in almost any type of soil, including B and C horizons of eroded areas and areas low in nitrogen. &quot;B. tectorum&quot; is quick to colonize disturbed areas. It is most often found on coarse-textured soils and does not grow well on heavy, dry, and/or saline soils. It grows in a relatively narrow range of soil temperatures; growth starts at and slows when temperatures exceed .

==Status as an exotic weed==

&quot;Bromus tectorum&quot; has been introduced to southern Russia, west central Asia, North America, Japan, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Iceland, and Greenland. It was first found in the United States (where it is known as downy brome or cheatgrass) in 1861 in New York and Pennsylvania, and by 1928 &quot;B. tectorum&quot; had spread to all parts of the United States (including Hawaii and Alaska), except for Florida and portions of Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. &quot;B. tectorum&quot; is most abundant in the Great Basin, Columbia Basin, and is part of the introduced species that replaced California native plants in the California Floristic Province&#x27;s grasslands and other habitats. In Canada &quot;B. tectorum&quot; has been identified as an invasive weed in all provinces, and is extremely prevalent in Alberta and British Columbia .

===Invasive species===
In the US, it grows on rangelands, pastures, prairies, fields, waste areas, eroded sites, and roadsides. It is much reviled by ranchers and land managers. &quot;B. tectorum&quot; seeds are also a critical portion of the diet of the chukar and grey partridge which have been introduced to the US. Intensive sheep browsing of &quot;B. tectorum&quot; in early spring has been used as a fire fuels reduction strategy in the hills adjacent to Carson City, Nevada. Because of rangeland fires and the invasion of &quot;Bromus tectorum&quot;, in 2010 the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) considered the possibility of extending the protections of the Endangered Species Act to the greater sage-grouse. The primary focus of Secretarial Order 3336, signed in 2015 in response to the USFWS status review, was to reduce threats to greater sage-grouse habitat by reducing the frequency and severity of rangeland fire. Specifically, Secretarial Order 3336 focused on how reducing &quot;B. tectorum&quot; could reduce the frequency and extent of rangeland fires. Since the review of the status of the greater sage-grouse by the USFWS in 2010 and the implementation Secretarial Order 3336 in 2015 the bulk of the research focusing on &quot;B. tectorum&quot; ecology and control has been completed. 

&quot;Bromus tectorum&quot; has demonstrated a quantitative and qualitative response to recent and near-term changes in the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Laboratory experiments have shown that above-ground biomass increased 1.5–2.7 gram per plant for every 10 part per million (ppm) increase above the 270 ppm pre-industrial baseline. On the qualitative side, rising carbon dioxide decreased the digestibility and potential decomposition of &quot;B. tectorum&quot;. In addition to stimulation of biomass, rising carbon dioxide may also increase the above ground retention of &quot;B. tectorum&quot; biomass by decreasing removal by animals or bacteria. Ongoing increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide may contribute significantly to &quot;B. tectorum&quot; productivity and fuel load with subsequent effects on wildfire frequency and intensity.

&quot;Bromus tectorum&quot; has been shown to benefit from endophytic colonization by morels (&quot;Morchella sextelata&quot;, &quot;M. snyderi&quot;) in western North America.    

=== Treatment options ===

==== Seeding ====
The availability of native seed will always be a limiting factor in restoration of sagebrush ecosystems after a rangeland fire. Little is understood about the germination requirements of native species. This lack of understanding is complicated by the episodic nature of establishment in arid grasslands. In response to the limited availability of native seed, land managers have been seeding &quot;Agropyron cristatum,&quot; a perennial bunchgrass native to Russia and Asia. The use of seeding another non-native to control an exotic, problem species is called assisted succession. &quot;A. cristatum&quot; is much easier to establish than the native perennials and has been shown to be a strong competitor of &quot;Bromus tectorum.&quot;

However, &quot;A. cristatum&quot; can exhibit invasive behavior and is a strong competitor of native perennials. The reason it is used, regardless of its invasive behavior, is because it restores some function to a perennial grassland.  &quot;A. cristatum&quot; is resistant to wildfire and it is suitable forage for cattle and wildlife. But the intensive control that would be needed to establish a native plant community in a  &quot;A. cristatum&quot; monoculture would cause disturbance that would also increase the invasive species it was planted to out compete. An alternative to using &quot;A. cristatum&quot; as a placeholder species in assisted succession is to establish it alongside foundation species like sagebrush. Adding sagebrush would diversify the ecosystem and provide habitat for sagebrush obligates. However, this would mean accepting the possibility that the native plant community may never establish.

==== Herbicides ====
A majority of research in 2011-2017 has focused on the use of herbicides to control &quot;B. tectorum&quot; and their effect on native plant communities. When using herbicides to suppress winter annual grasses the two most important factors that influence success are application timing and residual soil activity. Application timing is split into three main categories: pre-emergence in the fall before &quot;Bromus tectorum&quot; germinates, early post-emergence in early spring when &quot;B. tectorum&quot; is a seedling, and late post-emergence in late spring after &quot;B. tectorum&quot; is mature.

To be most effective post-emergence application needs to be done as late in the spring as possible to ensure that the herbicide treatment hits the majority of the &quot;B. tectorum&quot; population. However, the late application puts the native perennial vegetation at risk as they may be coming out of dormancy. Herbicides with no residual soil activity are not generally used because they are only effective in the year of application. If the herbicide has no residual soil activity the herbicide must be applied post-emergence in the early spring, but pre-emergence application is preferred because pre-emergence application is less likely to harm the native vegetation.

Studies have suggested that herbicide usage may select for warm season grasses and decrease the abundance of cool season grasses. There are five main herbicides used to control &quot;B. tectorum&quot;: imazapic, rimsulfuron, tebuthiuron, glyphosate, and indaziflam. However, the bulk of the recent research has been done on glyphosate, indaziflam, and imazapic.

Glyphosate has no residual soil activity and must be used post-emergence, which limits its control of &quot;B. tectorum&quot; to one year. For effective control it must be applied to the same area for more than five years to get ahead of seed production to prevent recolonization. Imazapic is the herbicide most widely used by land managers for &quot;B. tectorum&quot; control. Of the herbicides listed it is also the most commonly studied. Imazapic is preferred because it can be applied both pre and post-emergence, is approved for rangeland use, and has residual soil activity that allows for one to two year control. Indaziflam is one of the newest herbicides, licensed in 2010. It has a residual soil activity of 2–3 years and its also useful against many other invasive grasses. Not only does it reduce the abundance and biomass of &quot;B. tectorum&quot;, but it also reduces the highly flammable litter that &quot;B. tectorum&quot; produces. In early trials it has consistently out competed imazapic. As of 2017, indaziflam has not been approved for use outside of residential and commercial properties.

==== Prescribed burning ====
Prescribed burning alone reduces &quot;Bromus tectorum&quot; biomass for approximately two years. The goal of a prescribed burn in a &quot;B. tectorum&quot; invaded area is to remove the highly flammable plant litter in a controlled manner. The timing of prescribed burns can affect the variety and amount of returning vegetation. A study shows spring burns may result in a significant reduction of native vegetation, but fall burns have been shown to increase species richness. Fall burns may also promote select grasses and fire resilient plants. Another control for &quot;B. tectorum&quot; burns is consideration for the densities and fire adaptations of nearby foliage. In some cases, the existence of adjacent morchella can trigger mutual relationships like increased fiber and, by extension, fuels that nurture the return of cheatgrass. Similarly, when densely packed conifers begin infilling sagebrush communities the understory perennial vegetation is reduced; when these areas are prescribed burned the succession is dominated by &quot;B. tectorum&quot; in favor of taller grasses, making burns situationally inferior.

==== Water availability and treatment success ====
Water availably has a large impact on the success of &quot;Bromus tectorum&quot; treatments. In years of high precipitation, &quot;B. tectorum&quot; recruitment and biomass will increase and may render the treatment ineffective. In most long-term &quot;B. tectorum&quot; studies precipitation differences between years are speculated to be the cause of variation in effectiveness. However, well-timed precipitation after herbicide application can increase the amount of herbicide that makes it into the soil. When herbicide is applied to an area and there is &quot;B. tectorum&quot; litter on the ground, much of the herbicide will be absorbed into the litter and some will adhere to the litter. The litter creates a blanket that &quot;B. tectorum&quot; can germinate under even after herbicide application. But if it rains shortly after herbicide application, some of the herbicide that is trapped in the litter can be released and work into the soil. The rain may also allow native species to over come herbicide impacts. Increased precipitation in early spring may increase the success of seeding by increasing the germination rate of native grasses and remove &quot;B. tectorum&quot;’s competitive advantage.

=== Characteristics of a resistant native community ===
There is a positive correlation between native vegetation communities and biological soil crust (BSC). BSC is composed of cyanobacteria, algae, lichens, and mosses living on the soil. In arid regions BSCs colonize the spaces between plants, increase the biodiversity of the area, are often the dominant cover, and are vital in ecosystem function. In addition to providing erosion control, BSC is vital for nutrient cycling and carbon fixing. Fire and trampling by cattle are the major threats to the BSC communities, and once disturbed it can take decades to centuries for BSC to reform.  A decline in the health of the BSC community serves as an early warning indicator for &quot;Bromus tectorum&quot; invasion. If the BSC community is healthy then it will impede &quot;B. tectorum&quot; germination and reduce the likelihood of invasion. However, if there is a disturbance in the biological soil crust and &quot;B. tectorum&quot; is able to establish, then it will impede the recovery of the BSC community.

Native perennial grasses have roots that often reach four feet into the soil. These roots provide organic matter, which feeds the soil organisms that assist in water and nutrient cycling in arid ecosystems and improve soil quality&quot;. Bromus tectorum&quot; has a shallow, spreading root system, which makes it much more efficient at absorbing moisture from light precipitation episodes and disrupts nutrient cycling. Several studies have shown that native plant biomass, especially that of bunchgrasses, negatively affects &quot;B. tectorum&quot; cover and biomass, suggesting that a diverse native perennial community will be more resistant to &quot;B. tectorum&quot; invasion.

Studies have identified &quot;Poa secunda, Pseudoroegneria spicata,&quot; and &quot;Achnatherum thurberianum&quot; as key grasses for &quot;B. tectorum&quot; resistance. The life strategies of these three grasses differ in such a way that they provide constant interaction and competition with &quot;B. tectorum.&quot; &quot;P. spicata,&quot; and &quot;A. thurberianum&quot; are deep rooted and complete most of their growth in the late spring, and &quot;P. secunda&quot; is shallow rooted and completes most of its growth in the late winter and early spring. 

Perennial grass ecosystems are less prone to burning. &quot;B. tectorum&quot; has been historically thought to create a positive feedback loop. However, Taylor, et al. (2014), suggest that fire alone does not promote &quot;B. tectorum.&quot; If an area burns, the &quot;B. tectorum&quot; cover and biomass does not increase as was once thought, but recovers to previous levels. Increased fires, because of &quot;B. tectorum&quot;, may serve to maintain, not increase, the &quot;B. tectorum&quot; population by preventing the natives from establishing.

<doc id="509403" wikidata="Q1973927" url="?curid=509403" title="Punch (combat)">
<text>A punch is a striking blow with the fist. It is used in most martial arts and combat sports, most notably western boxing, where it is the only type of offensive technique allowed. In sports, hand wraps or other padding such as gloves may be used to protect athletes and practitioners from injuring themselves.

The use of punches varies between different martial arts and combat sports. Styles such as western boxing, Suntukan or Russian fist fighting use punches alone, while others such as kickboxing, Muay Thai, Lethwei or karate may use both punches and kicks. Others such as wrestling (excluding professional wrestling) and judo (punches and other striking techniques, atemi, are present in judo kata, but are forbidden in competitions) do not use punches at all. There are many types of punches and as a result, different styles encompass varying types of punching techniques.

== Basic types ==
This is not a comprehensive list of all punches and may need to be updated, due to the large diversity of schools of practice whose techniques, employing arm, shoulder, hip and leg work, may invariably differ.

== Styles ==

=== Boxing ===

In boxing, punches are classified according to the motion and direction of the strike; contact is always made with the knuckles. There are four primary punches in boxing: the jab, cross, hook, and uppercut. 
=== Karate ===
Punching techniques in karate are called &quot;tsuki&quot; or &quot;zuki&quot;. Contact is made with the first two knuckles (&quot;seiken&quot;). If any other part of the hand is used to strike with, such as the back of the fist (&quot;uraken&quot;) or the bottom of the fist (&quot;tetsui&quot;), then the blow is classified as a strike (uchi).

Karate punches include the thrust punch &quot;oi-zuki&quot; made using the lead-hand, straight punch &quot;choku-zuki&quot;, reverse punch &quot;gyaku-zuki&quot;, made from the opposite (lead) hand, and many other variations.

<doc id="509409" wikidata="Q116213" url="?curid=509409" title="Vacation">
<text>A vacation (American English) or holiday (British English) is either a leave of absence from a regular job or school or an instance of leisure travel away from home. People often take a vacation during specific holiday observances or for specific festivals or celebrations. Vacations are often spent with friends or family. Vacations may include a specific trip or journey, usually for the purpose of recreation or tourism.

A person may take a longer break from work, such as a sabbatical, gap year, Holiday entitlement or career break.

The concept of taking a vacation is a recent invention, and has developed through the last two centuries. Historically, the idea of travel for recreation was a luxury that only wealthy people could afford (see Grand Tour). In the Puritan culture of early America, taking a break from work for reasons other than weekly observance of the Sabbath was frowned upon. However, the modern concept of vacation was led by a later religious movement encouraging spiritual retreat and recreation. The notion of breaking from work periodically took root among the middle and working class.

== Etymology ==
In the United Kingdom, &quot;vacation&quot; once specifically referred to the long summer break taken by the law courts and then later the term was applied to universities. 

== Regional meaning ==
&quot;Vacation&quot;, in English-speaking North America, describes recreational travel, such as a short pleasure trip or a journey abroad. People in Commonwealth countries use the term &quot;holiday&quot; to describe absence from work as well as to describe a vacation or journey. Vacation can mean either staying home or going somewhere.

Canadians often use &quot;vacation&quot; and &quot;holiday&quot; interchangeably referring to a trip away from home or time off work. In Australia, New Zealand and the UK, &quot;holiday&quot; can refer to a vacation or a public holiday.

In the 1800s, New York City industrialists such as the Vanderbilts, Rockefellers, Carnegies, and Huntingtons built their own &quot;great camps&quot; in the Adirondack Mountains of upstate New York where they could spend time with their families in private luxury, declaring that they would &quot;vacate&quot; their city homes for their lakeside summer retreats; thus the term &quot;vacation&quot; replaced the British &quot;holiday&quot; in common parlance in the United States, with influence from guidebook author William Henry Harrison Murray.

In Hungarian, the word &quot;vakáció&quot; can mean both a recreational trip, an officially granted absence from work (generally in warmer months), and the summer (longest) school break. For absence from work, the word &quot;szabadság&quot; (freedom/liberty) can be used, possibly as &quot;betegszabadság&quot; (sickness freedom/sickness liberty) when the reason of absence is medical in nature.

== Family vacation ==
Family vacation refers to recreation taken together by the family. Family vacation can be ritual—for example, annually around the same time—or it can be a one-time event. It can involve travel to a far-flung spot or, for families on a tight budget, a stay-at-home staycation. Some examples of favorite family vacations might include family cruises, trips to popular theme parks, ski vacations, beach vacations, food vacations or similar types of family trips.

== Vacation research ==
Research on the effects of vacations on health, well-being and work performance started in the 1990s. The first meta-analysis on the effects of vacations was published in 2009. A 2013 literature review on the health and wellness benefits of travel experiences revealed beneficial effects of vacationing. More recent studies report on the positive effects of vacations as both a passive recovery process due to removal from job stress and as the active pursuit of relaxing, pleasurable and physical activities.

=== Anticipation effects ===
Anticipation effects of vacations refer to the changes that may occur in the time leading up to a vacation. Anticipation effects can be positive and negative. They can manifest in stress from workload or homeload (house work such as cleaning) leading up to a vacation. Research shows that health and well-being levels decrease from the second last week before vacation to the last week before vacation. This is explained by a higher workload leading up to vacation. Increasing homeload before vacation also explains a decrease in health and well-being prior to vacation, but only for women.

Moreover, research on Christmas holidays found that positive well-being effects such as enthusiasm rose in the weeks leading up to Christmas, whereas negative well-being effects such as nervousness decreased in the same time period. These effects can be explained by the pleasant expectations, called &quot;Vorfreude&quot; in German, that arise in the time leading up to the Christmas holidays.

=== Vacation effects ===
In a series of studies from 2010, 2012 and 2013, a team of researchers from the Radboud University Nijmegen analyzed the effects of vacations on subjective wellbeing in approximately 250 employees. The researchers examined employees before, during and after their vacation. Via telephone interviews during vacation, the researchers found that self-reported health and wellbeing improved during vacation. However, within the first week of returning to work, employee&#x27;s wellbeing lapsed to pre-vacation levels, irrespective of the duration or type of vacation. The research team also found that subjective vacation experiences, such as relaxation and control over one&#x27;s activities boost vacation effects. 

=== Creativity ===
According to a scientific study from 2014, vacations have an effect on an individual&#x27;s creativity. Researchers examined creativity by way of an idea-generation task (Guilford&#x27;s Alternate Uses) in 46 Dutch employees before and after a three-week summer vacation. Participants had to generate creative uses for common daily things such as a brick or piece of paper. The results showed that ideas were just as original after the vacation as they were before. However, employees did produce a wider range of ideas after a vacation as opposed to before, showing greater mental flexibility as a result from taking a vacation. Specifically, it seems that after a vacation employees consider a greater range of aspects of thoughts and avoid routine solutions as opposed to before going on vacation.

=== Romantic relationships ===
In a study from 2012, researchers found that a vacation may act as a relationship booster by offering the opportunity to increase interactions with a partner and by enhancing spouse support. This finding highlights the importance of high quality contact between partners during a vacation. Specifically, vacationers who conversed extensively and positively with one another felt more relaxed, derived more pleasure from vacation experiences and felt more detached from their work during their holiday trip. Another study found that satisfaction with vacations can explain couples&#x27; relationship commitment and suggests that vacation may serve as a means for strengthening relationships. Another team of researchers found that shared experiences during vacations, such as effective communication, showing affection, or experiencing new things together, were positively associated with couples&#x27; day-to-day functioning at home.

=== Vacation mechanisms: why vacations are beneficial ===
Leisure is an important ingredient for overall well-being. It provides people with freetime and possibilities to engage in non-obligatory activities. This helps people to recover from job stress. In 2007, researchers developed four measures for assessing how people recuperate and unwind from work during leisure time. This study showed that four recovery experiences help to lower stress and aid recovery from strain: psychological detachment from work, relaxation, mastery, and control. Meaning and affiliation were later added, leading to the DRAMMA-model: Detachment, Relaxation, Autonomy, Mastery, Meaning and Affiliation.

* Detachment refers to mental distancing from work-related tasks. Shifting focus and thinking about something other than work can be achieved by reading a book or engaging in physical activities, for example.
* Relaxation refers to low levels of physical and mental activation coupled with a positive mood. Relaxation activities calm the body and mind: for example progressive muscle relaxation, a massage, or taking a warm bath.
* Autonomy refers to a sense of being in control of your surroundings. This concerns, for example, being able to reserve certain periods of the day for enjoyable activities of your own choice.
* Mastery can be achieved by activities that challenge you and provide opportunities to improve skills and knowledge, giving a sense of accomplishment. This can involve learning new skills like playing an instrument or sports. improving existing skills, or gaining new knowledge.
* Meaning refers to leisure activities that give people a sense of making a difference in the world and contributing to a greater cause. Examples are volunteering, cultural activities or making art.
* Affiliation refers to the sense of belongingness and the sense of feeling connected to others. Activities that can lead to affiliation are for example going to parties with friends, playing games or cooking and eating together.

Each of these mechanisms serve as a mediating link between any form of leisure activities and subjective well-being. Autonomy, Mastery and Affiliation are similar to the core mechanisms in self-determination theory.

=== Methodology ===

Conducting research on vacations is challenging because vacationing concerns a process that stretches across longer time periods and people are often traveling and therefore hard to reach for research purposes. Randomized controlled trials in which people would be assigned to certain travel types are costly to realize and most people would probably not like to be assigned to a specific type of holiday. Accordingly, researchers have described a few important features of vacation research that help to generate reliable and valid results.

* Measures before, during and after vacation: Repeated measures in the same persons are required to study vacationing as a process that unfolds its effects over time.  
* On vacation measurements: It is important to not only use pre- and post-vacation measurements but to also obtain information during vacation. This is because post-vacation measurements are biased by work resumption and fade-out may already have begun. On vacation measures could be done via live phone calls/interviews or time-stamped assessments via smartphone apps. 
* Pre-vacation measurements: Research has shown that health and well-being slightly decrease shortly before vacation compared to two weeks before vacation. Therefore, vacation effects are defined as the difference between on-vacation measurements compared to pre-vacation measurements conducted at least two weeks prior to the holiday.  
* Fade-out measurements: It is also useful to compare several post-vacation measurements with pre-vacation measurements to determine whether and how fast vacation effects diminish.

== Vacation policy ==
In nearly all countries worldwide, there are minimum requirements as to the annual leave that must be afforded to an employee (see also List of minimum annual leave by country).

Even in the United States, where no federal requirements as to minimum annual leave exist, many large corporations have vacation policies, some allowing employees to take weeks off and some even allowing unlimited vacation. Unlimited vacation arrangements may nonetheless come with implicit expectations, for instance, it may be implied that an employee should not take more than about the average number of vacation days taken by others. They normally also have the consequence that employees who leave the company receive no monetary compensation for leave days not taken.

According to the U.S. Travel Association, Americans collectively did not use 662 million vacation days in 2016. More than half of all working people in the United States forfeited paid time off at the end of the year. Two-thirds of people still do work while they are on vacation.

=== Unlimited paid vacation policies ===
In order to go on a vacation in the first place, workers make use of paid time off granted by their employers. Recently, unlimited paid time off policies (UPTO) are rising in popularity. In a study from 2022, researchers propose two competing processes and boundary conditions when it comes to unlimited paid time off. These processes can at the same time &quot;unlock the best&quot; and &quot;unleash the beast&quot;. On the one hand, unlimited time paid time off can increase employees&#x27; feeling of control, accountability, and work engagement. On the other hand, unlimited paid time off may set detrimental social processes in motion which could also lead to self-endangering work behaviors, long working hours, and exhaustion. Workers may feel discouraged from taking time off, because they lack social norms on leave taking, feel insecure about taking leave or feel guilty towards their team when taking time off during busy periods at work. Absence of formal rules may lead to newly emerging informal rules which are not communicated and can increase social conflicts. The researchers also argue that leave changes from an individual trading good into a collective good under unlimited leave policies.

== Impact of digital communications ==

Recent developments in communication technology—such as internet, mobile, instant messaging, presence tracking—have begun to change the nature of vacation. Vacation today now could mean absence from the workplace rather than temporary cessation of work. For a minority subset of workers in North America and the United Kingdom, it is now the norm to carry on working or remain on call while on vacation rather than abandon work altogether. Some people do remote work while on vacation. Antithetically, workers may take time out of the office to go on vacation, but remain plugged-in to work-related communications networks. While remaining plugged-in over vacation may generate short-term business benefits, the long-term psychological impacts of these developments are only beginning to be understood.

=== Workcations ===
Since the pandemic started and working life became more flexible, working from various locations became more common. Specifically, workcations that combine aspects of work and travel can offer periods of detachment and relaxation in the same way vacations do, although those periods are shorter than during a traditional vacation.

A study published in 2020 regarding digital nomads explains how the borders between work and leisure disappear. Digital nomads can travel and work because they are not bound by normal work structures such as offices and 9-to-5 life. However, creating one&#x27;s own structures, routines and work communities can also be experienced as burdensome.

== In popular culture ==
Family vacation and vacation in general has become a common theme in many books and films. Writers often draw on common occurrences that take place during a vacation such as disasters and bonding.

<doc id="509435" wikidata="Q316861" url="?curid=509435" title="Alexei Yagudin">
<text>Alexei Konstantinovich Yagudin (; 18 March 1980) is a Russian former competitive figure skater. He is the 2002 Olympic champion, a four-time World champion (1998, 1999, 2000, 2002), a three-time European champion (1998, 1999, 2002), a two-time Grand Prix Final champion (1998–1999, 2001–2002), the 1996 World Junior champion, and a two-time World Professional champion (1998, 2002).

Yagudin is the only skater (all disciplines included) to have achieved a Golden Slam, a victory in all major championships (Olympic Games, World Championships, European Championships, Grand Prix assignments, Grand Prix Final) in the same season (2001–2002). In 2003, Yagudin was awarded with the Order of Merit for the Fatherland IV degree of the Russian Federation. In 2017, he was inducted into the World Figure Skating Hall of Fame.

After his retirement from eligible skating, Yagudin has toured as a professional skater and appeared as a show host, an actor and a figure skating commentator for Russian television networks. In 2019, he opened the Figure Skating Center Alexei Yagudin in Minsk, Belarus where he coaches.

==Early life==
Alexei Yagudin was born on 18 March 1980 in Leningrad, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union. When Yagudin was four, his father moved to Germany, severing all contact with his wife and son. His parents would officially divorce when he was 12. He graduated from the Lesgaft National State University of Physical Education, Sport and Health.

==Skating career overview==
===Early career===
Yagudin was introduced to skating at age four by his mother, Zoya, who saw the activity as a way to improve his health. He learned all his double jumps before age ten, the five triple jumps before age twelve, and the triple Axel jump before he turned thirteen. His first coach was Alexander Mayorov, and then he was introduced to the famous Russian coach Alexei Mishin when Mayorov moved to Sweden in 1992. Yagudin trained in Mishin&#x27;s group from 1992 to 1998. He began competing at the international level in 1994, and won the 1996 World Junior Championships. The famous rivalry with fellow Russian skater Evgeni Plushenko began when they trained in Mishin&#x27;s group, and intensified after Yagudin left.

===Senior career===

In 1997, Yagudin competed in the World Championships for the first time and won a bronze medal.

In 1998, Yagudin led a Russian sweep of the medals at the 1998 European Championships with Evgeni Plushenko in second and Alexander Abt in third. Later that year, he competed at the 1998 Nagano Winter Olympics despite a severe case of pneumonia, and finished in 5th place. A month later, he won the 1998 World Championships. He became the first Russian single skater from the post-Soviet era to win the World title. He was the second-youngest male World Champion at the age of 18 years and 15 days, 6 days older than Donald McPherson in 1963. About two months after the event, Yagudin left Mishin and joined Tatiana Tarasova, who would coach him until his retirement in 2003.

In the 1998–99 season, Yagudin won eleven out of the thirteen competitions in which he participated, which included the defeat of Kurt Browning in the World Professional Championships, and winning the Grand Prix Final. At the 2000 European Championships, he finished ahead of both Plushenko and former Olympic champion Alexei Urmanov to win his second continental title. He successfully defended his world title against Plushenko at the 2000 World Championships in Nice, France.

Yagudin struggled at the beginning of the 1999–2000 season. He withdrew from the 1999–2000 Grand Prix Final due to a knee injury, and then lost to Plushenko at the Russian Championships and 2000 European Championships. At the 2000 World Championships, he won his third consecutive world title.

Yagudin&#x27;s 2000–01 season was marred by injuries and inconsistency. He lost to Plushenko at the 2000–01 Grand Prix Final, Russian Championships, and the 2001 European Championships. He sustained a foot injury shortly before the 2001 World Championships in Vancouver, Canada. He stood in fifth place after the qualifying round and placed second in the short program, receiving a standing ovation and compliments of &#x27;It was all about heart and guts&#x27; for his performance of &quot;The Revolutionary Etude&quot;. He went on to win the silver medal after ranking second in the free skate.

Yagudin started the 2001–02 Olympic season with a bronze medal at the 2001 Goodwill Games in September. He altered his training regimen as a result, and then enjoyed the best season in his career. He defeated Plushenko at the 2001–02 Grand Prix Final and regained his European title. At the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Yagudin won the men&#x27;s event, receiving first-place votes from every judge throughout the competition, became one of the youngest male figure skating Olympic champions. He received four 6.0 scores for his free skate. Yagudin&#x27;s perfect marks are the most for an Olympic performance since Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean&#x27;s free dance in 1984 and set a record for a men&#x27;s skater in the Olympics. After the Olympics, Yagudin won his fourth World title, receiving six perfect 6.0s for his short program and another two for his free skating at the competition. He became the first singles skater to receive six perfect marks for the short program, including the first ever perfect mark for required elements. This record cannot be equaled or broken because the International Skating Union introduced the ISU Judging System after the 2002–03 season.

Yagudin was diagnosed with a congenital hip disorder after the Olympic season. He was advised by doctors to stay off the ice for several months. Yagudin chose not to follow this advice and competed at 2002 Skate America. He won the short program, but withdrew due to his injury before the next segment. He later announced his retirement from competitive skating. His final performance as an eligible skater came during a farewell gala at Skate Canada with a performance of a new program, &quot;Memorial&quot;, and his short program from the previous season, &quot;Racing&quot;.

Yagudin was awarded with the Order of Merit for the Fatherland IV degree of the Russian Federation in 2003. He never won the Russian Championships, losing mainly to Evgeni Plushenko.

===Professional career===
Yagudin then turned professional in 2003, touring with Stars on Ice and Ice Symphony in Russia.

In 2004, Yagudin toured with &quot;Stars on Ice&quot; for the second year in a row. He also worked with the French figure skater Brian Joubert as a consultant coach. In November he won two professional competitions with two new programs, &quot;The Feeling Begins&quot; (music by Peter Gabriel) and &quot;Moon Over Bourbon Street&quot; (music by Sting). The next year, he continued with the Stars on Ice tour and his &quot;Passion&quot; program was choreographed with a difficult acrobatic routine that took place seven meters up in the air. Since returning to his hometown of Saint Petersburg in 2005, Yagudin has skated in various Russian ice shows and took part in the Russian TV show &quot;Stars on Ice&quot;, later renamed &quot;Ice Age&quot;.

In 2006, after a full Olympic cycle since Salt Lake City, Yagudin performed his famous &quot;Winter&quot; program on tour and a new program &quot;Sway&quot; (music by Pussycat Dolls). In 2007, Yagudin first toured in the U.S. with the &quot;Stars on Ice&quot;, and then toured in Russia. He skated a comic number &quot;Blues for Klook&quot; and a flamenco number &quot;Legenda&quot;. In July 2007, Yagudin underwent surgery to have a titanium hip joint implanted. In August, Yagudin announced that he intended to return to eligible sports after more than four years of competing as a professional skater. His former coach Tatiana Tarasova and former choreographer Nikolai Morozov agreed to coach him should he return. However, Yagudin suffered another injury while on tour in November 2007. Afterward he stated that returning to competitive skating would be too difficult under the circumstances.

In June 2010, he skated in the &quot;Supermatch: Medalist on Ice&quot; show in Korea, performing &quot;Sway&quot; and &quot;Winter&quot;. On September 4, he participated in the &quot;Artistry on Ice&quot; show in Beijing. During the show, the wedding ceremony of the famous Chinese pair skaters Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo, the 2010 Olympic champions was held. As one of the invited guests he gave his blessing to the couple and performed &quot;Winter&quot; and &quot;Sway&quot; afterward. It was his first visit to China.

In 2011, Yagudin told an interviewer that due to the hip replacement surgery he had undergone, he is no longer able to do all his triple jumps. He continues to perform his popular &quot;Winter&quot; program in shows around the world.

In 2017, he was inducted into the World Figure Skating Hall of Fame.

In 2019, he opened the Figure Skating Center Alexei Yagudin in Minsk, Belarus.

==Acting and host career==
In Russia, Yagudin has worked as a show host, actor and a figure skating commentator for Russian television networks.

In fall of 2006, he took part in the Russian TV show &quot;Stars on Ice&quot; having a former gymnast, Oksana Viktorovna Pouchkina, as his partner. He later realized that a return to eligible skating would not be feasible, and continued his professional career, taking part in the Russian TV show again, which was renamed &quot;Ice Age&quot;. This time he was paired with a pop singer Victoria Dayneko with whom he also recorded a song &quot;Needle&quot;. In 2008, Yagudin finished the &quot;Ice Age&quot; tour and then made his debut as the title role of Vladimir Putin in the satirical play &quot;The President&#x27;s Vacation&quot;, written by Tatiana Chertova and Igor Kositsyn. It premiered at the Satire Theater in Moscow.

His career as an actor continued with getting one of the main roles in a Russian TV series about figure skating &quot;Hot Ice&quot; (2009). He also adventured into a popular TV show &quot;Good evening, Moscow!&quot; as a host in 2009. In 2010, he performed in the ice musical &quot;City Lights&quot;, written by Ilia Averbukh. That same year, he participated in the second season of &quot;Ice Age&quot; partnered with actress Valeria Lanskaya and would complete a third season of the show with her has his partner.

In 2013, he acted with Miroslava Karpovich at the Moscow Comedy Theater in the play &quot;Don&#x27;t Trust Your Eyes&quot;. In 2018, he acted in two comedic plays with Anna Gorshkova in St. Petersburg, Russia. He has appeared numerous times as a host on &quot;I Want to Know&quot;, a Russian television series where celebrities interview people to learn about their culture. Since 2019, he hosts his own television show called &quot;Ice is melting with Alexei Yagudin&quot; where he interviews athletes. In 2021, he was a jury member for the Russian talent show, &quot;I&#x27;m Almost Famous&quot;.

==Public image==
Yagudin published his autobiography, &quot;Alexei Yagudin: Overcome&quot;, in Japan in 2005. It was published in Russia in 2007 under the title, &quot;НаPRолом&quot;, with extra chapters and photos added to cover his recent life.

In 2011, Yagudin joined a Russian campaign to promote healthy lifestyles. He took part in free physical trainings held in Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Rostov-on-Don, Ekaterinburg, Samara, Kazan, and Novosibirsk. He stated, &quot;I would like to achieve through this campaign at least the understanding of people that 30 or 40 minutes of their day can improve their health now and in the future.&quot;

He was the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS ambassador for the 2019 European Games, saying, &quot;Sport, in all its varieties, unites millions of people around the world and, as a UNAIDS Ambassador, I am absolutely convinced that an HIV status should not affect either the attitude towards a person or his ability to pursue his life plans.&quot;

In 2020, Yagudin made controversial remarks about black transgender people in an Instagram story post, calling them &quot;mistakes of nature&quot; and wishing them to die. The post came in reaction to fellow figure skater and activist Adam Rippon making a donation to the Okra Project, a charity aimed at helping underprivileged black transgender people. Yagudin soon deleted the post and apologized for his comments the next day. Rippon criticized Yagudin for the comments and made another $1000 donation, this time in Yagudin&#x27;s name, to the same organization.

He spoke out against the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, posting an all-black image on his Instagram account with the message, &quot;Stop this nonsense!&quot;

==Personal life==
Yagudin moved to the United States in 1999 to train with Tatiana Tarasova. He lived in the United States for almost seven years before returning to Russia. In 1999, the Champions on Ice tour dismissed him because of his alleged excessive drinking. Yagudin underwent hip surgery in 2003 after touring with &quot;Stars on Ice&quot;. He assisted Tarasova with coaching over the summer and early fall until his arrest for driving while intoxicated in August 2003. On 2 June 2008, Yagudin&#x27;s car was stolen with one of his World Championships gold medals in it. The medal and car were never located.

In 2016, Yagudin married Olympic pair skating champion Tatiana Totmianina. She gave birth to their first child, a daughter named Elizaveta (&quot;Liza&quot;), on 20 November 2009. The couple stated they do not want Liza to become a competitive skater, and hope she will concentrate on studying and music as she grows up. On 2 October 2015, the couple&#x27;s second daughter, Michèle, was born. They also have a Yorkshire Terrier named Varia.

He identifies as an atheist. He admitted that he only wore a cross during his skating career because he found it beautiful and his children were not baptized. The Yagudin family resides in Moscow and France, where his daughters attended a French school.

<doc id="509436" wikidata="Q273665" url="?curid=509436" title="Caesaropapism">
<text>Caesaropapism is the idea of combining the social and political power of secular government with religious power, or of making secular authority superior to the spiritual authority of the Church, especially concerning the connection of the Church with government. Although Justus Henning Böhmer (1674–1749) may have originally coined the term &quot;&quot; (&quot;Cäseropapismus&quot;), it was Max Weber (1864–1920) who wrote that &quot;a secular, caesaropapist ruler ... exercises supreme authority in ecclesiastic matters by virtue of his autonomous legitimacy.&quot; According to Weber, caesaropapism entails &quot;the complete subordination of priests to secular power.&quot;

In an extreme form, caesaropapism is where the head of state, notably the emperor (&quot;Caesar&quot;, by extension a &quot;superior&quot; king), is also the supreme head of the church (pope or analogous religious leader). In this form, caesaropapism inverts theocracy (or hierocracy in Weber), in which institutions of the church control the state. Both caesaropapism and theocracy are systems in which there is no separation of church and state and in which the two form parts of a single power-structure.

==Eastern Church==

Caesaropapism&#x27;s chief example is the authority that the Byzantine (East Roman) Emperors had over the Church of Constantinople and Eastern Christianity from the 330 consecration of Constantinople through the tenth century. The Byzantine Emperor would typically protect the Eastern Church and manage its administration by presiding over ecumenical councils and appointing Patriarchs and setting territorial boundaries for their jurisdiction. The Emperor exercised a strong control over the ecclesiastical hierarchy, and the Patriarch of Constantinople could not hold office if he did not have the Emperor&#x27;s approval. Such Emperors as Basiliscus, Zeno, Justinian I, Heraclius, and Constans II published several strictly ecclesiastical edicts either on their own without the mediation of church councils, or they exercised their own political influence on the councils to issue the edicts. According to Metropolitan Kallistos Ware, the historical reality of caesaropapism stems from the confusion of the Byzantine Empire with the Kingdom of God and the zeal of the Byzantines &quot;to establish here on earth a living icon of God&#x27;s government in heaven.&quot;

However, Caesaropapism &quot;never became an accepted principle in Byzantium.&quot; Several Eastern churchmen such as John Chrysostom, Patriarch of Constantinople and Athanasius, Patriarch of Alexandria, strongly opposed imperial control over the Church, as did Western theologians like Hilary of Poitiers and Hosius, Bishop of Córdoba. Saints, such as Maximus the Confessor, resisted the imperial power as a consequence of their witness to orthodoxy. In addition, at several occasions imperial decrees had to be withdrawn as the people of the Church, both lay people, monks and priests, refused to accept inventions at variance with the Church&#x27;s customs and beliefs. These events show that power over the Church really was in the hands of the Church itself – not solely with the emperor.

During a speech at the St. Procopius Unionistic Congress in 1959, John Dvornik stated, &quot;...the attitude of all Orthodox Churches toward the State, especially the Russian Church is dictated by a very old tradition which has its roots in early Christian political philosophy... the Christian Emperor was regarded as the representative of God in the Christian commonwealth, whose duty was to watch not only over the material, but also the spiritual welfare of his Christian subjects. Because of that, his interference in Church affairs was regarded as his duty.&quot; The regional church was elevated by the rivals of the Byzantine Empire, namely the Serbian and Bulgarian empires, to patriarchate according to a prevailing theory during the time the status of the church had to be equal to the state.

Following the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, the Sultans of the Ottoman Empire took control of appointing the Patriarch of Constantinople and all Byzantine Rite Bishops within their dominions. According to historian Charles A. Frazee, the Greek Hierarchs appointed by the Sultan and his advisors were almost invariably opposed to the reunification decrees at the Council of Florence and rejected the authority of the Papacy.

At the same time, however, so great was the suffering of the Greek people under the Sultans that, in the February 14, 1908 Papal allocution &quot;Ringraziamo Vivamente&quot;, Pope Pius X accused the Greek Orthodox Church under Turkish rule of having preferred, &quot;a harsh yoke (that of Islam) to the tenderness of their mother.&quot;

Caesaropapism was most notorious in the Tsardom of Russia when Ivan IV the Terrible assumed the title Czar in 1547 and subordinated the Russian Orthodox Church to the state. In defiance of the Tsar&#x27;s absolute power, St. Philip, the Metropolitan of Moscow, preached sermons in Tsar Ivan&#x27;s presence that condemned his indiscriminate use of state terror against real and imagined traitors and their families by the Oprichnina. Metropolitan Philip also withheld the traditional blessing of the Tsar during the Divine Liturgy. In response, the Tsar convened a Church Council, whose bishops obediently declared Metropolitan Philip deposed on false charges of moral offenses and imprisoned him in a monastery. When the former Metropolitan refused a request from the Tsar to bless the 1570 Massacre of Novgorod, the Tsar allegedly sent Malyuta Skuratov to smother the former Bishop inside his cell. Metropolitan Philip was canonized in 1636 and is still commemorated within the Orthodox Church as a, &quot;pillar of orthodoxy, fighter for the truth, shepherd who laid down his life for his flock.&quot;

Tsar Ivan&#x27;s level of caesaropapism far exceeded that of the Byzantine Empire but was taken to a new level in 1721, when Peter the Great and Theophan Prokopovich, as part of their Church reforms, replaced the Patriarch of Moscow with a department of the civil service headed by an Ober-Procurator and called the Most Holy Synod, which oversaw the running of the church as an extension of the Tsar&#x27;s government.

The Patriarchate was only restored on November 10 (October 28 O.S.), 1917, 3 days after the Bolshevik Revolution, by decision of the All-Russian Local Council. On 5 November 1917, after his election by vote as one of the three candidates for the restored Patriarchate of Moscow, Metropolitan Vladimir of Kiev announced that Metropolitan Tikhon had been selected for the position after a drawing of lots as the new Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia.

Seeking to convince Soviet authorities to stop the campaign of terror and persecution against the Church, Metropolitan Sergius, acting as patriarchal &quot;locum tenens&quot;, tried to look for ways of peaceful reconciliation with the government. On July 29, 1927, he issued : an encyclical letter where he professed the absolute loyalty of the Russian Orthodox Church to the Soviet Union and to its government&#x27;s interests.

This declaration, sparked an immediate controversy among the Russian Eastern Orthodox, many of whom (including many notable and respected bishops in prisons and exile) broke communion with Sergius. This attitude of submission to the Soviet Government is sometimes derogatorily called &quot;Sergianism&quot;, after Met. Sergius and his declaration, and is to this day deemed by some Eastern Orthodox Christians, especially True Orthodox, as a heresy.

Later, some of these bishops reconciled with Sergius, but many still remained in opposition to the &quot;official Church&quot; until the election of Patriarch Alexius I in 1945.

==Western Church==


Justinian I conquered the Italian peninsula in the Gothic War (535–554) and appointed the next three popes, a practice that would be continued by his successors and would later be delegated to the Exarchate of Ravenna. The &quot;Byzantine Papacy&quot; was a period of Byzantine domination of the papacy from 537 to 752, when popes required the approval of the Byzantine Emperor for episcopal consecration, and many popes were chosen from the &quot;apocrisiarii&quot; (diplomatic envoys from the pope to the emperor) or from the inhabitants of Byzantine Greece, Byzantine Syria, or Byzantine Sicily.

In the Latin West, medieval secular rulers vied with the papacy for overall power, notably in the Investiture Controversy of the 11th and 12th centuries and in the struggles between Guelphs and Ghibellines from the 12th to the 14th centuries, but neither the German Kings nor the Holy Roman Emperors ever succeeded in establishing any long-term dominance over the Vatican. Emperors could at times exert influence over the election of Bishops of Rome,
they could claim the right () to veto a papal candidate (last exercised in 1903 by His Imperial and Royal Apostolic Majesty The Emperor of Austria, Apostolic King of Hungary), or they could support rival antipopes. &quot;Conquering kings&quot; (the Theophylacti between the 10th and 12th centuries, Napoleon I in 1809, Victor Emmanuel II in 1870, for example) could curb a Pope&#x27;s political rule, but they could not reliably control the Holy Father, and the papacy generally asserted and maintained its spiritual independence from secular control.

===Anglican Communion===

During the dispute between King Henry VIII of England and Pope Clement VII over Henry&#x27;s wish to have his marriage to Catherine of Aragon annulled, the English Parliament passed the Act in Restraint of Appeals (1533). It stated:

The next year Parliament passed the First Act of Supremacy (1534) that explicitly tied the head of church to the imperial crown of England:

The Crown of Ireland Act, passed by the Irish Parliament in 1541 (effective 1542), changed the traditional title used by the Monarchs of England for the reign over Ireland, from Lord of Ireland to King of Ireland and named Henry head of the Church of Ireland, for similar reasons.

During the rule of Queen Mary I of England (), the First Act of Supremacy was annulled, but during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I the Second Act of Supremacy, with similar wording to the First Act, was passed in 1559. During the English Interregnum of 1649 to 1660 the laws were annulled, but the acts which caused the laws to be in abeyance were themselves deemed null and void by the Parliaments of the English Restoration from 1660 onwards.

When Elizabeth I restored royal supremacy, she replaced the title &quot;Supreme Head&quot; with that of &quot;Supreme Governor&quot;, a conciliatory change designed to mollify English Catholics and the more radical of the English Protestants. 

According to Nicholas Sanders ( - 1581), however: &quot;The Queen lays down for her clergy a rule of life, outside of which they dare not move, not only in those things which Protestants call indifferent, but in all matters of Faith, discipline, and doctrine, in virtue of that supreme spiritual power with which she is invested: she suspends her bishops when she pleases, she grants a license to preach, either to those who are ordained according to her rite or to simple laymen, in the same way at her pleasure reduces those whom she will to silence. To show her authority in these things, she occasionally, from her closet, addresses her preacher, and interrupts him in the presence of a large congregation, in some such way as this: &#x27;Mr. Doctor, you are wandering from the text, and talking nonsense. Return to your subject.

Since 1559, the royal monarchs of England, of Great Britain, and of the United Kingdom have claimed the &quot;Supreme Governor&quot; status as well as the title of &quot;Defender of the Faith&quot; (which was originally bestowed on Henry VIII by Pope Leo X but later revoked by Pope Paul III, as that was originally an award for Henry VIII&#x27;s 1521 anti-Lutheran treatise &quot;Defence of the Seven Sacraments&quot;).

Despite his continued persecution of both Catholic Recusants and English Dissenters, King James I () preferred not to do anything else that might otherwise encourage factional strife within the Anglican Communion. His son and heir, King Charles I (), through his insistence upon promoting the High-Church reforms advocated by the Caroline Divines and by Archbishop William Laud, alienated opponents of Anglo-Catholicism and lost both his throne and his head in the course of the English Civil War of 1642-1651.

The 1688 overthrow of the House of Stuart was caused by the efforts of King James II () to partially annul the Act of Supremacy by granting Catholic Emancipation more than two hundred years before Daniel O&#x27;Connell. As many Anglicans saw James&#x27;s attempts as in violation of the King&#x27;s Coronation Oath, Parliament blocked every bill, which caused the King to simply order Catholic Emancipation into effect using his Royal Prerogative. In response, Parliament successfully invited the King&#x27;s son-in-law, William of Orange to invade England and to take the throne.

Even though King James II and his exiled heirs remained Catholics, their overthrow divided the Anglican Communion in what is now known as the Non-juring schism. Anglican Jacobites, or Non-Jurors, embraced the Anglo-Catholicism advanced by the Stuart monarchs between 1603 and 1688. During each of the Jacobite risings, Non-Juring Anglican chaplains accompanied the Jacobite armies. The schism faded following the 1788 death of Prince Charles Edward Stuart and the inheritance of his claim to the throne by his younger brother, Prince Henry Benedict Stuart, a Catholic priest and Cardinal.

==In popular culture==
* The Investiture Controversy between King John of the House of Plantagenet and Pope Innocent III, who is represented onstage by Cardinal Pandulf Verraccio is one of the main plotlines of William Shakespeare&#x27;s stage play &quot;The Life and Death of King John&quot;. The King and the Cardinal clash over both the appointment of Archbishop Stephen Langton to the Diocese of Canterbury and the King&#x27;s determination to completely dominate and control the internal affairs of the Catholic Church in England. This, in return, causes the Cardinal to Excommunicate the King and to covertly arrange a regime change war. Intriguingly, however, once a chastened and humiliated King John grudgingly accepts the independence of the English Church from the State and surrenders his Crown to Cardinal Pandulf, the latter immediately gives the crown back and then becomes a valuable ally in defending England against the very same invasion by Prince Louis of France he had previously arranged.
* The alleged careerism and subservience of Anglican clergy to multiple contradictory religious beliefs imposed upon their denomination by different English monarchs is satirized in the 17th-century ballad &quot;The Vicar of Bray&quot;.
* The conflict between Tsar Ivan the Terrible and Metropolitan Philip is shown onscreen in Sergei Eisenstein&#x27;s 1944 film &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot;.
* Robert Bolt&#x27;s play &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; centers around the efforts of King Henry VIII and Thomas Cromwell to coerce the former Lord Chancellor of England, Sir Thomas More, to express approval of the King&#x27;s claim to control the Catholic Church in England and Wales. The play has seen multiple revivals and was made into a multi–Academy Award–winning 1966 feature film starring Paul Scofield and a 1988 television movie starring Charlton Heston.
* In the BBC sitcom &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot;, the episode &quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Gambit&quot;, which first aired on 20 February 1986, satirizes the damage that the control wielded over the Church of England by politicians and the British civil service continues to have on who gets appointed to the Hierarchy.
* The conflict between Tsar Ivan the Terrible and Metropolitan Philip is the primary theme of Pavel Lungin&#x27;s 2009 film &quot;Tsar&quot;.
* The &quot;Kirchenkampf&quot;, or battle within German Protestantism between the German Christians, who embraced Nazi ideology, and the underground Confessing Church, which rejected it, is one of the major plotlines of the 2024 film &quot;Bonhoeffer&quot;, directed by Todd Komarnicki.

<text>Evgeni Viktorovich Plushenko (, born 3 November 1982) is a Russian former figure skater. He is a four-time Olympic medalist (2006 gold, 2014 team gold, 2002 &amp; 2010 silver), a three-time World champion (2001, 2003, 2004), a seven-time European champion (2000, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2010, 2012), a four-time Grand Prix Final champion (1999–2000, 2000–01, 2002–03, 2004–05), and a ten-time Russian national champion (1999–2002, 2004–2006, 2010, 2012–2013). Plushenko&#x27;s four Olympic medals once tied with Sweden&#x27;s Gillis Grafström&#x27;s record for most Olympic medals in figure skating, which has since been surpassed by Scott Moir and Tessa Virtue. He also won a record total of 22 titles on the Grand Prix circuit.

==Early life and education==
Plushenko was born on 3 November 1982 in , Solnechny District, Khabarovsk Krai, Soviet Union. His mother was originally from Volgograd, Russian SFSR, and his father, a carpenter, was born in Donetsk, Russia. He has an older sister. Plushenko lived in Volgograd before moving to Saint Petersburg in 1994. His mother died on 10 July 2015.

A 1998 graduate of school No. 91 in Petrogradsky District, he began studying at the in 2000, graduating in 2005, and at the Faculty of tourism and hospitality of the Saint Petersburg State University of Engineering and Economics in 2004.

His surname is most commonly romanized as &quot;Plushenko&quot; but other variations exist. The Cyrillic shcha (&quot;щ&quot;) may be transliterated as &#x27;shch&#x27; (scholarly šč), but the simplified variant &#x27;sh&#x27; is often used for convention. The letter &quot;ю&quot; is pronounced &quot;yu&quot;, so a more accurate transliteration would be &quot;Plyushchenko&quot;. His given name is romanized as Evgeni or Yevgeny.

==Skating career==
===Early career===
Since Plushenko frequently suffered from colds, his mother decided he needed exercise and enrolled him in figure skating lessons at age four. His first coach was Tatiana Skala. He trained in Volgograd, Russia until his ice rink closed when he was 11 years old. In 1994, his mother took him to Saint Petersburg to train under the guidance of Alexei Mishin.

Plushenko made quick progress on the international scene. He became the youngest ever World Junior Champion and World medalist at age 14, winning the 1997 World Junior Championships. The following year, at age 15, he won the bronze medal at the 1998 World Championships.

===1999–2001===
Plushenko developed a rivalry with Alexei Yagudin, with whom he trained under Mishin until Yagudin left in 1998. In 2000, Plushenko defeated Yagudin at the 2000 European Championships, but finished fourth at the 2000 World Championships.

Plushenko had a very successful 2000–01 season, winning every event he entered, including his first World title.

===2002–2006===
At the 2002 Winter Olympics, Plushenko and Yagudin were considered co-favorites. Plushenko finished 4th in the short program after falling on his quadruple toe loop, but skated a free skating to &quot;Carmen&quot; and pulled up to finish in 2nd place overall.

Plushenko won most of the competitions he entered in the following four years. He finished second only twice. The first time was to Emanuel Sandhu at the 2003–04 Grand Prix Final for misunderstanding the new ISU Judging System which was now in use. The second was the 2004 European Championships, where he lost to Brian Joubert. He had a difficult 2004–05 season. At the 2005 World Championships in Moscow, Russia, an injury forced him to withdraw after the short program. He eventually required groin surgery. He underwent surgery to correct the problem in Munich, Germany in spring 2005.

Going into the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, Plushenko was the overwhelming favorite because of his past success under the new judging system. Plushenko skated two solid programs and became the Olympic champion. He finished the short program ten points ahead of his closest rival, setting a new ISU record for the short program. His free skating was just as strong, and also set a new ISU record. Plushenko&#x27;s free skating music was specially arranged for him by violinist Edvin Marton.

===2006–2008: Hiatus===
Plushenko took a break from competitive skating following the 2006 Olympic season. He has said the off-season helped him rest and recover from past knee injuries he has battled.

After seeing the poor results of Russian skaters at the 2007 World Championships (the worst since 1960), Plushenko was worried about Russia losing its status as a dominant force in figure skating, and was also concerned that Russia might even lose confidence for its skaters for the 2010 Winter Olympics. He announced in April 2007 that he decided to return to competitive skating for the 2007–08 season to keep Russia at a competitive level with other countries until the next generation of Russian skaters could take over but a return to the ice did not materialize. Plushenko also stated that he planned to compete in the 2010 Winter Olympics.

In 2008, Plushenko, together with violinist Edvin Marton, accompanied Dima Bilan on stage as part of the winning Eurovision Song Contest performance &quot;Believe&quot; in Belgrade, Serbia. Plushenko skated on stage as part of the performance.

===2009–2010: Return to competition===
In March 2009, Plushenko announced that he had returned to training with longtime coach Alexei Mishin in order to prepare for the 2010 Olympics.

Plushenko led the short program in his return to skating at the 2009 Cup of Russia on 23 October 2009. He earned 82.25 points for the short, and won the free skating with a score of 158.40. Overall, he won the gold in his comeback with a total of 240.65 points.

In December 2009, Plushenko signed a partnership agreement with the international management agency FlashLight led by the sports agent Andreas Goller.

At the 2010 Russian Championships, Plushenko earned 100.09 points for his short program. He received 171.50 points in the free skating to win his eighth Russian Championship with 271.59 points.

At the 2010 European Championships, Plushenko set a new world record score in the short program by scoring 91.30 points, and went on to win the event for a sixth time with a total score of 255.39 points.

He skated at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and received a score of 90.85 for his short program performance, breaking the Olympic record and leading all competitors. Following his skate, Plushenko said &quot;Without a quad it&#x27;s not men&#x27;s figure skating. I will do the quad in any case. I believe that the quad is the future of figure skating. The quad is necessary, that is my opinion.&quot;

Plushenko finished second in the free skating and second overall, ultimately winning the silver medal with a total score of 256.36, 1.31 points behind the winner Evan Lysacek. In the free skating, he landed a quadruple toe loop-triple toe loop combination but left a planned double loop out of a combination jump. He and Lysacek received a similar total score for program components, but Plushenko had a lower total technical elements score than Lysacek. He said of the gold medal winner, Evan Lysacek, &quot;I think we need to change the judging system – a quad is a quad. If an Olympic champion doesn&#x27;t do a quad, well I don&#x27;t know...&quot; In an interview to Russian newspaper Izvestia, Plushenko brought attention to the fact that, following his short program, three judges placed him 21st and 22nd for skating skills. He said, &quot;Strangely, the computer did not drop any one of the three. But what it did instead was to drop those judges who awarded me first place. Under the current system, if this is the way judges&#x27; marks are awarded, you can win, and you can just as equally lose. Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I don&#x27;t want to criticize the new rules, they are not bad. But they do need further refinement.&quot; He also expressed dismay over the Russian Figure Skating Federation not standing up for one of their athletes. &quot;After the short program, I should have had at least a 5 point lead over my competitors. In the end, however, the gap amounted to a mere 0.55 to which our Federation did not react at all.&quot; Russian skating champion Irina Rodnina said that although she had hoped Plushenko would win, Lysacek had a stronger overall performance. At the same time, some well-known Russian skaters and coaches said they supported Plushenko and believe he deserved the gold medal. Among them were figure skater Elvis Stojko and the coaches Reinhardt Ketterer, Tatiana Tarasova, and Galina Zmievskaya. During the medal ceremony, Plushenko who felt that his free skate performance was strong enough for gold, stepped on the top level of the podium on his way to the runner-up level, considered by some to be unsportsmanlike. Plushenko&#x27;s website afterwards proclaimed &quot;Silver of Salt Lake&quot;, &quot;Gold of Torino&quot;, and &quot;Platinum of Vancouver&quot;, with the platinum medal claim being removed after ridicule by critics. Following the Olympic medal ceremony, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin sent Plushenko a telegram, congratulating him on the wonderful Olympic performance and saying his silver was worth gold. On March 24, 2010 Siberian jewelers decided to award Plushenko a special medal weighing more than half a kilo of pure gold.

Plushenko became the only living single skater to have won medals at three Olympics. He withdrew from the 2010 World Championships citing injury.

===Loss of eligibility and reinstatement===
Plushenko skated in exhibitions soon after his withdrawal from Worlds. On 28 June 2010, the International Skating Union announced that Plushenko had lost his eligibility due to participating in skating shows in March and April without the Russian figure skating federation&#x27;s authorization. He was given 21 days to appeal this decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which he did not do. As a result, his loss of eligibility became final as announced by the ISU on 23 August 2010. However, a request for reinstatement could be made in line with ISU regulations subject to a review and decision by the ISU Council. In September 2010, he stated his goal of competing at the 2014 Winter Olympics. In October 2010, he competed in the Japan Open 2010 as part of the European team. Each team was allowed to have an &quot;ineligible&quot; member. He placed third in the men&#x27;s event.

Plushenko skated in ice shows around the world while continuing to train for a possible return to competition by practicing quad Salchows and quad loops. In April 2011, he sent a letter to the Russian figure skating federation president, Aleksandr Gorshkov, seeking reinstatement. Plushenko said he hoped the ban was not a retaliation of his criticism of the judging at the Olympics and that he would like to return to competition with a clean slate. Although he said he would have liked to compete at the 2011 World Championships if the ban had been lifted, he did not feel he would have been ready due to lost training time as a result of injury. On 12 June 2011, it was announced that the ISU had reinstated him by a unanimous vote.

===2011–2012 season: Return to competition===
On 12 June 2011, Plushenko said that he had undergone knee surgery due to a meniscus problem but would be back on track within two weeks. Although his left knee continued bothering him, he resumed training in Mishin&#x27;s group, alongside Artur Gachinski, saying &quot;Competition is always good, remember there was a time when Alexei Urmanov, Alexei Yagudin and I all trained together. We pushed each other. With Artur in the group, I have a sparring partner. He does a quad and I have to do a quad as well.&quot; He declined an offer to skate in a 50-show tour in order to train.

In December 2011, Plushenko competed at the 2012 Russian Championships. He won the short program with a score of 88.24 and then won the free skating with a score of 171.43, to win his ninth national title. He was named to the Russian team for the 2012 European Championships, although he had not competed internationally recently enough to have the minimum technical elements scores (20 in the short program, 35 in the free). The Russian figure skating federation asked the ISU to allow him to compete, with Aleksandr Gorshkov saying that the minimum scores were designed to filter out weak skaters. In January 2012, the ISU released a statement confirming that Plushenko had been allowed to participate in the 2012 European Championships. On 26 January 2012, Plushenko confirmed that he would undergo additional surgery on his meniscus after the competition and would be unable to compete at the 2012 World Championships.

Plushenko competed at the 2012 European Championships, his first international competition since 2010. He earned a score of 84.71 for his short program and a personal-best score of 176.52 for free skating. His overall competition score of 261.23 points was also a personal best and earned him his seventh European title. He became only the third men&#x27;s skater to capture seven European titles and the only one to do so in modern history. He is surpassed only by two skaters from the early history of the sport, Sweden&#x27;s Ulrich Salchow, who won nine titles from 1898 to 1913, and Austria&#x27;s Karl Schafer, who won eight from 1929 to 1936. In a post-Europeans interview, Plushenko said that he had not planned to compete after 2010 but found he missed the adrenaline of competition. He underwent surgery on his left knee to clean up the meniscus and repair a cartilage on 23 February 2012 in Germany. In February 2012, Plushenko also mentioned a back problem due to spinal disc herniation. It was later determined that back surgery would not be necessary. Mishin clarified that Plushenko was in good health overall.

===2012–2013===
In April and July 2012, Plushenko worked with Italian choreographer Pasquale Camerlengo on a new short program. In late June 2012, he also worked with Japanese choreographer Kenji Miyamoto on his free skating for the following season. His work on quad Salchows and Lutzes aggravated his spinal problem and he flew to Munich, Germany for surgery, which involved searing a disk hernia with a liquid. Although doctors recommended he stay off the ice for a month, Plushenko returned in seven days, explaining &quot;I felt that I need to run fast in order to defend my position. I had the National Championships coming up, so, not only did I start to train too early, but I started to train too intensely.&quot; His decision led to complications and he received an injection, a block, in Saint Petersburg. He lost some of his jumps but got them back before the 2013 Russian Championships in Sochi, Russia. Plushenko won his 10th national title at the event. He said his plan was to compete at the 2013 European and World Championships if his health allowed him.

Plushenko withdrew from the 2013 European Championships after the short program due to his back problem. He underwent surgery on 31 January 2013 in Tel Aviv, Israel to replace a spinal disk with a synthetic one.

===2013–2014===
As part of his preparation for the 2013–2014 season, Plushenko planned summer training camps in Pinzolo, Italy and Tartu, Estonia, followed by training in Saint Petersburg and Sochi.

On 7 November 2013, Plushenko returned to competition at the 22nd Volvo Open Cup in Riga, Latvia where he won the gold medal with an overall score of 263.25 points. He landed a 4T, 3A, 3A-3T in the free skating and obtained the minimum TES needed to compete at the 2014 Winter Olympics. He had one Grand Prix assignment, the 2013 Rostelecom Cup, but withdrew due to a minor knee injury. At the 2014 Russian Championships, Plushenko placed first in the short program and second in the free skating. He finished second overall behind Maxim Kovtun, his first loss at Nationals since placing third in 1998.

On 22 January 2014, it was announced that Plushenko had been awarded Russia&#x27;s men&#x27;s spot for the 2014 Winter Olympics. It was his fourth Olympics appearance. Offered the opportunity to be Russia&#x27;s flagbearer, he said it was a great honor but he could not accept due to the competition schedule.

At the 2014 Winter Olympics, Plushenko competed in both the short and free skating segments of the team figure skating competition. He placed second in the short program with a personal best score of 91.39 behind Yuzuru Hanyu of Japan. He placed first in the free skating portion with a score of 168.20, garnering 19 points for his team. Russia won gold, ten points ahead of Canada who got silver. This was Plushenko&#x27;s second Olympic gold medal, giving him a total of four Olympic medals, and he became one of the oldest figure skating Olympic champions. This tied him with Sweden&#x27;s Gillis Grafström for the record of the most Olympic medals by a figure skater, since surpassed by the ice dance team of Scott Moir and Tessa Virtue. This was also Russia&#x27;s first gold at the games.

After struggling with a back injury during practice, Plushenko decided to withdraw from the men’s singles competition following his pre-short program warm up on 13 February 2014. Plushenko&#x27;s withdrawal was after the Sunday deadline to name a replacement which left Russia without an entry in men&#x27;s singles.

It was announced shortly after that Plushenko would be retiring from competitive skating, but was &quot;not ruling out&quot; the possibility of returning for the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea. On 2 March 2014, Plushenko announced that he was going to have another back surgery citing a snapped pin in his back, and ended any plans for a return to professional competition.

===After Sochi Olympics===
Plushenko expressed interest in coaching when he ended his skating career. After retiring officially from competition in March 2017, he opened his own skating school.

He was the coach of Adelina Sotnikova, Russia&#x27;s controversial 2014 Olympic champion, from April 2017 until she retired in 2020. He is also the coach of Stanislava Konstantinova and Ekaterina Ryabova.

== Records and achievements ==

Evgeni Plushenko has won four Olympic medals, which, at the time, tied with Gillis Grafström&#x27;s record for most Olympic medals in figure skating. Plushenko is known for his dynamic performances, and technical advancement of the sport.

Plushenko is the first male skater to perform the Biellmann spin in the senior competitions. At the 1999 NHK Trophy, he became the first skater to perform a 4T–3T–2Lo combination in competition. He has since landed the combination 26 times. Plushenko is also the first to land 4T–3T–3Lo and 3A-1Lo-3F in competition. He first landed the combination at the 2002 Cup of Russia and has since landed it four times. He is the first skater to complete the 3A-3F combination.

Plushenko is also the first to perform a 3T–3T–3Lo–2Lo combination, which he first did at the 2001 ARD Gala. At the 2006 Russian Championships, he landed a six jump combination (3T–3T–2Lo–2Lo–2Lo–2Lo) in his exhibition program. He performed a 3A-3T-3Lo combination at the exhibition finale of the 2006 Winter Olympics.

Plushenko has consistently landed 4T in competitions and landed a 4S in Samara, Russia during the 2004 Russian Cup series. It is estimated that he has landed a total of about 100 quads in competition.

Plushenko has worked on and landed 4Lo and 4Lz in practice, but has never completed any of them in competition. He has also worked on a 3A-4T combination.

At the age of 16, Plushenko became the youngest male skater to ever receive a perfect score of 6.0. He received a total of seventy five 6.0&#x27;s before the new Code of Points judging system was introduced. Under the Code of Points system, he has set 13 world record scores (5 in the short program, 4 in free skating, and 4 in the combined total).

===List of Plushenko&#x27;s world record scores===
Plushenko has broken 13 world records in his career:
==Advancement of skating competition==
Plushenko has taken a strong position opposing the current official ban on quad jumps in the women&#x27;s short program stating: “When Usain Bolt runs faster than everyone else, should he run with weights? Why should ladies skating be held back? It is not fair to them. There should be equality”, referring to men not being restricted as to the use of quad jumps in competition. Plushenko has advocated the position that both men and women should be equally allowed to use the quad jump in skating competition without gender discrimination.

==Political career==
In 2006, Plushenko joined the political party A Just Russia, and in March 2007, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Saint Petersburg. Following the 2010 Olympics, he announced his intention to quit politics. In April 2010, he gained public attention for poor attendance, having attended only 11 of 123 parliamentary sessions since his election. In December 2011, he announced he was leaving politics to train for the 2014 Olympics. He quit A Just Russia and said he had no plans to join another political party.

==Personal life==
On 18 June 2005, Plushenko married Maria Ermak, a sociology student at the Saint Petersburg State University, in a ceremony at the Hotel Astoria in Saint Petersburg. Their son, Egor Evgenievich (originally Kristian), was born on 15 June 2006. In February 2008, they were officially divorced. In August 2009, Plushenko announced his engagement to Yana Rudkovskaya, the record producer for Russian singer Dima Bilan. They were married on 12 September 2009. Their first son, Alexander, was born in January 2013 with their second, Arseniy, born in September 2020.

In March 2022, Plushenko published an Instagram video in which he endorsed Russia&#x27;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and called it an &quot;unavoidable special operation&quot;. In December 2022, the Ukrainian Parliament sanctioned Plushenko for his support of the war.

<text>Paul Delos Boyer (July 31, 1918 – June 2, 2018) was an American biochemist, analytical chemist, and a professor of chemistry at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He shared the 1997 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for research on the &quot;enzymatic mechanism underlying the biosynthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)&quot; (ATP synthase) with John E. Walker, making Boyer the first Utah-born Nobel laureate; the remainder of the Prize in that year was awarded to Danish chemist Jens Christian Skou for his discovery of the Na+/K+-ATPase.

==Birth and education==
Boyer was born in Provo, Utah, and grew up in a nonpracticing Mormon family of Dutch, German, French, and English descent. He attended Provo High School, where he was active in student government and the debating team. He was also his high schools valedictorian and played intramural basketball in high school and college. He received a B.S. in chemistry from Brigham Young University in 1939 and obtained a Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation Scholarship for graduate studies. Five days before leaving for Wisconsin, Paul married Lyda Whicker in 1939, and they remained married for nearly eighty years until his death in 2018, making him the longest-married Nobel laureate. The Boyers had three children.

Though the Boyers connected with the Mormon community in Wisconsin, they considered themselves &quot;on the wayward fringe&quot; and doubted the doctrinal beliefs of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). After experimenting with Unitarianism, Boyer eventually became an atheist. In 2003 he was one of 22 Nobel laureates who signed the Humanist Manifesto.

==Academic career==
After Boyer received his Ph.D. degree in biochemistry from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1943, he spent years at Stanford University on a war-related research project dedicated to stabilization of serum albumin for transfusions. He began his independent research career at the University of Minnesota and introduced kinetic, isotopic, and chemical methods for investigating enzyme mechanisms. In 1955, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship and worked with Professor Hugo Theorell on the mechanism of alcohol dehydrogenase. In 1956, he accepted a Hill Foundation Professorship and moved to the medical campus of the University of Minnesota. In 1959–1960, he served as Chairman of the Biochemistry Section of the American Chemical Society (ACS) and in 1969–1970 as President of the American Society of Biological Chemists.

Since 1963, he had been a professor in the department of chemistry and biochemistry at University of California, Los Angeles. In 1965, he became the founding director of the Molecular Biology Institute and spearheaded the construction of the building and the organization of an interdepartmental Ph.D. program. This institutional service did not diminish the creativity and originality of his research program, which led to three postulates for the binding mechanism for ATP synthesis—that energy input was not used primarily to form ATP but to promote the binding of phosphate and mostly the release of tightly bound ATP; that three identical catalytic sites went through compulsory, sequential binding changes; and that the binding changes of the catalytic subunits, circularly arranged on the periphery of the enzyme, were driven by the rotation of a smaller internal subunit.

Paul Boyer was editor or associate editor of the &quot;Annual Review of Biochemistry&quot; from 1963 to 1989. He was editor of the classic series, &quot;The Enzymes&quot;. When he worked on the series &quot;The Enzymes&quot;, he was helped by his wife Lyda as she was a professional editor at UCLA. In 1981, he was faculty research lecturer at UCLA. In that same year, he was awarded the prestigious Tolman Medal by the Southern California Section of the American Chemical Society.

==Death==
Boyer died of respiratory failure on June 2, 2018, at the age of 99, less than two months shy of his 100th birthday at his Los Angeles home.

<text>Alliaria petiolata, or garlic mustard, is a biennial flowering plant in the mustard family (Brassicaceae). It is native to Europe, western and central Asia, north-western Africa, Morocco, Iberia and the British Isles, north to northern Scandinavia, and east to northern Pakistan and Xinjiang in western China.

In the first year of growth, plants form clumps of round, slightly wrinkled leaves, that when crushed smell like garlic. The plants flower in spring of the next year, producing cross-shaped white flowers in dense clusters. As the flowering stems bloom they elongate into a spike-like shape. When flowering is complete, plants produce upright fruits that release seeds in mid-summer. Plants are often found growing along the margins of hedges, giving rise to the old British folk name of jack-by-the-hedge. Other common names include: garlic mustard, garlic root, hedge garlic, sauce-alone, jack-in-the-bush, penny hedge and poor man&#x27;s mustard. The genus name &quot;Alliaria&quot;, &quot;resembling &quot;Allium&quot;&quot;, refers to the garlic-like odour of the crushed foliage. All parts of the plant, including the roots, have this smell.

==Description==
It is an herbaceous biennial plant growing from a deeply growing, thin, whitish taproot scented like horseradish. In their first years, plants are rosettes of green leaves close to the ground; these rosettes remain green through the winter and develop into mature flowering plants the following spring. Second-year plants often grow from tall, rarely to tall. The leaves are stalked, triangular through heart-shaped, long (of which about half being the petiole) and broad, with coarsely toothed margins. The flowers are produced in spring and summer in small clusters. Each small flower has four white petals long and broad, arranged in a cross shape. The fruit is an erect, slender, four-sided capsule long, called a silique, green maturing to pale grey brown, containing two rows of small shiny black seeds which are released when a silique splits open. A single plant can produce hundreds of seeds, which often scatter several meters from the parent plant.

Depending upon conditions, garlic mustard flowers either self-fertilize or are cross-pollinated by a variety of insects.

Sixty-nine insect herbivores and seven fungi are associated with garlic mustard in Europe. The most important groups of natural enemies associated with garlic mustard were weevils (particularly the genus &quot;Ceutorhynchus&quot;), leaf beetles, butterflies, and moths, including the larvae of some moth species such as the garden carpet moth. The small white flowers have a rather unpleasant aroma which attracts midges and hoverflies, although the flowers usually pollinate themselves. In June the pale green caterpillar of the orange tip butterfly (&quot;Anthocharis cardamines&quot;) can be found feeding on the long green seed-pods from which it can hardly be distinguished.

== Invasiveness in North America ==
Garlic mustard was introduced to North America by European settlers in the 1800s for culinary and medicinal purposes. The species was recorded as being in Long Island in 1868. It has since spread all over North America, apart from the far south of the US and some prairie states and Canadian provinces. It is toxic or unpalatable to many native herbivores, as well as to some native Lepidoptera.

The plant is classified as an invasive species in North America. Since being brought to the United States by settlers, it has naturalized and expanded its range to include most of the Northeast and Midwest, as well as south-eastern Canada. It is one of the few invasive herbaceous species able to dominate the understory of North American forests and has thus reduced the biodiversity of many areas.

Of the many natural enemies it has in its native range, several have been tested for use as biological control agents. Five weevil species from the genus &quot;Ceutorhynchus&quot; and one flea beetle were selected as candidates for preliminary testing in the 1990s. Since that time, those studying the candidates have narrowed the list to two or three weevils. Despite the demonstrated effectiveness of &quot;C. scrobicollis&quot; and &quot;C. constrictus&quot; in field testing, the importation and release of biological control agents such as those has been repeatedly blocked by the USDA&#x27;s TAG (Technical Advisory Group). In particular, &quot;C. scrobicollis&quot;, which is monophagous and has been specifically studied since 2002, continues to be blocked, despite researchers&#x27; many petitions for approval. It is currently estimated that adequate control of garlic mustard can be achieved by the introduction of just two weevils, with &quot;C. scrobicollis&quot; being the most important of the two. None of the roughly 76 species that control this plant in its native range has been approved for introduction as of 2018 and federal agencies continue to use more traditional forms of control, such as chemical herbicides.

In North America, the plant offers very little wildlife benefits and is toxic to larvae of certain rarer butterfly species (e.g. &quot;Pieris oleracea&quot; and &quot;Pieris virginiensis&quot;) that lay eggs on the plants, as it is related to native mustards but creates chemicals that they are not adapted to. They have also been known to inhibit growth of ectomycorrhizal fungi. These fungi play many different roles in a forest ecosystem however inhibition by &quot;Alliaria petiolata,&quot; may impact tree seedlings in a given environment. Though this plant does have antimicrobial properties, it has an overall weak effect on bacterial communities found in soil, which only occurs under temporally specific conditions. 

Native species, including two stem-mining weevils, a stem-mining fly, a leaf-mining fly, a scale insect, two fungi, and aphids (taxonomic identification for all species is pending) were found attacking garlic mustard in North America. However, their attacks were of little consequence to plant performance or reproduction of garlic mustard.

== Toxicity ==
Young first-year garlic mustard plants contain up to 100ppm cyanide, a level which is toxic to many vertebrates. Once the plant is chopped up, the cyanide gas is eliminated.

== Cultivation and uses ==
Garlic mustard is one of the oldest spices used in Europe. Phytoliths in pottery of the Ertebølle and Funnelneck-Beaker culture in north-eastern Germany and Denmark, dating to 4100–3750 BCE, indicate its use in that era.

In the 17th-century Britain, it was recommended as a flavouring for salt fish. It can also be made into a sauce for eating with roast lamb or salad. Early European settlers brought the herb to the New World to use as a garlic-type flavouring. Its traditional medicinal purposes include use as a diuretic. The herb was also planted as a form of erosion control.

Today, the chopped leaves are used for flavouring in salads and sauces such as pesto, and sometimes the flowers and fruit are included as well. The leaves, best when young, taste of both garlic and mustard. The seeds are sometimes used in France to season food. Garlic mustard was once used medicinally as a disinfectant or diuretic, and was sometimes used to treat wounds.

<text>Fried rice is a dish of cooked rice that has been stir-fried in a wok or a frying pan and is usually mixed with other ingredients such as eggs, vegetables, seafood, or meat. It is often eaten by itself or as an accompaniment to another dish. Fried rice is a popular component of East Asian, Southeast Asian and certain South Asian cuisines, as well as a staple national dish of Indonesia. As a homemade dish, fried rice is typically made with ingredients left over from other dishes, leading to countless variations. Fried rice first developed during the Sui dynasty in China.

Many varieties of fried rice have their own specific list of ingredients. In China, common varieties include Yangzhou fried rice and Hokkien fried rice. Japanese chāhan is considered a Japanese Chinese dish, having derived from Chinese fried rice dishes. In Southeast Asia, similarly constructed Indonesian, Malaysian, and Singaporean &quot;nasi goreng&quot; and Thai &quot;khao phat&quot; are popular dishes. In the West, most restaurants catering to vegetarians have invented their own varieties of fried rice, including egg fried rice. Fried rice is also seen on the menus of non-Asian countries’ restaurants offering cuisines with no native tradition of the dish. Additionally, the cuisine of some Latin American countries includes variations on fried rice, including Ecuadorian &quot;chaulafan&quot;, Peruvian &quot;arroz chaufa&quot;, Cuban &quot;arroz frito&quot;, and Puerto Rican &quot;arroz mampostea(d)o&quot;.

Fried rice is a common street food in Asia and other parts of the world. In some Asian countries, small restaurants, street vendors and traveling hawkers specialise in serving fried rice. In Indonesian cities it is common to find fried rice street vendors stationing their food carts in busy streets or residential areas. Many Southeast Asian street food stands offer fried rice with a selection of optional garnishes and side dishes.

== Preparation ==

Cooked rice is the primary ingredient, with a wide variety of additional ingredients, such as vegetables, eggs, meat (chicken, beef, pork, lamb, mutton), preserved meat (bacon, ham, sausage), seafood (fish, shrimp, crab), and mushrooms. Aromatics such as onions, shallots, scallions, leeks, ginger and garlic are often added for extra flavor. Cooking oils such as vegetable oil, sesame oil, clarified butter, or lard can be used to grease the wok or frying pan to prevent sticking, as well as for flavor. Fried rice dishes can be seasoned with salt, different types of soy sauce, oyster sauce, teriyaki sauce and many other sauces and spices. Popular garnishes include chopped scallions, sliced chili, fried shallots, sprigs of parsley or coriander leaves, mint leaves, sliced boiled eggs, toasted sesame seeds, seaweed flakes (gim or nori), sliced cucumber, tomato, lime, or pickled vegetables.

Made of fresh rice can prevent it from frying properly, leading to an undesirably soft texture.

== History ==

The earliest record of fried rice is in the Sui dynasty (589–618 AD) in China.

<text>The Eastern United States, often abbreviated as simply the East, is a macroregion of the United States located to the east of the Mississippi River. It includes 17–26 states and Washington, D.C., the national capital.

As of 2011, the Eastern United States had an estimated population exceeding 179 million, representing the majority (over 58 percent) of the total U.S. population.

The three most populous cities in the Eastern United States are New York City, Chicago, and Philadelphia.

==Northeastern United States==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Northeastern United States comprises nine states, including (north to south): Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania.

The present-day Northeast is significantly smaller than the Northeastern Woodlands cultural area. The pre-Columbian Northeast had three major areas: the Coastal area, Saint Lawrence Lowlands, and Great Lakes-Riverine zones. The Coastal area includes the Atlantic Provinces of Canada and the Atlantic seaboard of the United States south to North Carolina. The Saint Lawrence Lowlands area includes parts of Southern Ontario, upstate New York, much of the Saint Lawrence River area, and the Susquehanna Valley. The Great Lakes-Riverine area includes the remaining inland areas of the Northeast, which were home to Central Algonquian and Siouan speakers. The Great Lakes region is sometimes considered a distinct cultural area due to its large concentration of Native American tribes.

===New England===

New England is a subregion of the northeastern U.S. that is bounded by the Atlantic Ocean, Canada, and the state of New York. It includes six states: Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut.

In one of the earliest British colonial settlements in the New World, Pilgrims from England first settled in New England in 1620 at Plymouth Colony in and around present-day Plymouth, Massachusetts. In the late 18th century, the New England colonies were among the first North American British colonies to support an escalation in the American Revolution against Britain, launching the Boston Tea Party on December 16, 1773, and later firing the first shots of the American Revolutionary War in the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775.

New England produced the first examples of American literature and philosophy and was home to the beginnings of free and public education. In the 19th century, the region played a prominent role in the movement to abolish slavery in the United States. It was the first region of the United States to be transformed by the Industrial Revolution.

As of 2023, New England is home to two of the top ten universities in the nation, according to 2022-23 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rankings, Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts (tied for third), and Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts (tied for third).

===Mid-Atlantic===

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Middle Atlantic is a subregion of the northeastern U.S. that includes three states: New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania.

The Middle Atlantic region includes New York City, the largest city in the U.S. and a global center of finance and culture, and Philadelphia, the nation&#x27;s sixth-largest city and first capital, where the Declaration of Independence was signed at Independence Hall in 1776, formally launching the American Revolutionary War, and later where the U.S. Constitution was drafted and ratified at Independence Hall in Philadelphia in 1789.

As of 2023, the Mid-Atlantic region is home to four of the top twenty-five universities in the nation, according to 2022-23 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rankings: Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey, Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, Columbia University in New York, New York, and the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

===East North Central States===

The East North Central area, which includes Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin, can also be classified as a subregion of the Northeastern United States, as these states are in the Great Lakes-Riverine area. As one of two subregional divisions used to categorize the modern Midwest, the East North Central region closely matches the area of the Northwest Territory, excluding a portion of Minnesota. The East North Central states form a large part of the Great Lakes region, although the latter also includes Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania and the Canadian province of Ontario.

Culturally, the East North Central region of the U.S. has been historically influenced by the British and the French; Anglo-American culture permeated states covering the region following the westward expansion of the United States. Religiously, the East North Central states have been and remain predominantly affiliated with Christianity. Altogether, the five states are majority Catholic, non- and inter-denominational, Methodist, Lutheran, and Baptist. The largest non-Christian religion has been Islam.

Chicago is the largest city in the region, followed by Columbus, Ohio and Indianapolis. Chicago has the largest metropolitan statistical area, followed by Detroit, and Minneapolis–Saint Paul. Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan is the oldest city in the region, founded by French missionaries and explorers in 1668.

As of 2023, the East North Central States are home to one of the top ten universities in the nation, according to 2022-23 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rankings: the University of Chicago, which is ranked the sixth-best in the nation.

==Southeastern United States==

The Southeastern United States is a large region of the country that includes a core of states that reaches north to Maryland and West Virginia, bordering the Ohio River and Mason–Dixon line, and stretches west to Arkansas and Louisiana.

Unlike the Northeast, there is no official U.S. government definition for the Southeast, and it is defined variably among agencies and organizations.

Its unique cultural and historic heritage includes the following aspects:
*Distinct Native American cultures (Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands)
*Early European settlements of English, Scotch-Irish, Scottish and German heritage
*Rejection of the Anglican Church as instituted by Great Britain and resorting to other denominations of Protestantism
*Helping partake in the American Revolutionary War
*Importation of hundreds of thousands of enslaved black Africans
*Growth of a large black population
*Reliance on slave labor from early 1600s to mid-1800s
*Southern yeoman farmers that differed from the planter class
*Legacy of the Confederacy after the Civil War
*Reconstruction Era
*Jim Crow era and Great Migration 
*Civil rights movement
*Emergence of the New South and New Great Migration

These aspects, among other things, led to &quot;the South&quot; developing distinctive customs, literature, musical styles, and varied cuisines that have profoundly shaped traditional American culture.

The shift from a mainly rural society to more cities and urbanized metropolitan areas picked up speed following World War II in the 1940s. Since the late 20th century, certain Southeastern states and areas have seen great economic growth. This growth has led to many migrants moving to Southeastern states. In 2020, Fortune 500 companies headquartered in southeastern states included: Virginia with 22, Georgia with 18, Florida with 18, North Carolina with 13, and Tennessee with 10.

===South Atlantic states===

The South Atlantic region of the United States is one of the nine Census Bureau Divisions of the country. This region corresponds to the Southern states/areas that were geographically part of the Thirteen Colonies, with the addition of Florida. It includes eight states and one federal district: Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. The South Atlantic is also a recognized geographical division used by the United States Geological Survey. All entities within the region apart from the District of Columbia and West Virginia border the Atlantic Ocean.

As of 2010, the South Atlantic states had a combined population of 61,774,970. The South Atlantic region covers . With the exception of West Virginia, the region has seen rapid population growth and economic development in recent decades.

As of 2023, the South Atlantic region is home to three of the top ten universities in the nation, according to 2022-23 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; rankings: Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., and Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, which is ranked the tenth-best in the nation.

===East South Central States===

The East South Central region constitutes one of the nine U.S. Census Bureau divisions. Four states make up the division: Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi and Alabama. Historically, the area has been colonized and influenced by the French, Spanish, British, early US, and Confederate governments. Distinct among these states, Alabama&#x27;s French culture has been preserved through the Alabama Creoles, and Kentucky&#x27;s French culture can be observed throughout Louisville. The East South Central states form the core of Old Dixie, one of the nine &quot;moral regions&quot; identified by James Patterson and Peter Kim in their acclaimed 1991 geopolitical best-seller, &quot;The Day America Told The Truth&quot;.

Politically and culturally, the East South Central is more conservative than the South Atlantic; Mississippi, Alabama, Kentucky, and Tennessee&#x27;s governments have been described during 2012 to 2023 as some of the most conservative. Religiously, conservative Evangelical Protestantism dominates the East South Central region as a central part of the Bible Belt.

As of 2020, the East South Central states had a combined population of 19,430,030. The East South Central region covers 183,401 square miles of land. Within the region, Tennessee is the largest state by population, though Alabama is the largest by land area; Tennessee was also the East South Central&#x27;s fastest growing state between 2010 and 2020, with Alabama second. Kentucky was the third-fastest growing state, and Mississippi experienced population decline; despite population decline, Mississippi did increase in diversity.

<text>Franco Petracchi (born September, 1937) is an Italian double bass soloist and teacher. He is a native of Pistoia, Tuscany, and the author of &quot;Simplified Higher Technique&quot;. In his method, he introduces some conventions to playing in the thumb-position. He uses names chromatic, semi-chromatic and diatonic for different hand positions. He plays a Gaetano Rossi bass, which is unusually large for a soloist.

<text>Southern Cross Broadcasting (Australia) Limited was a diversified Australian media company, that owned and operated a variety of media businesses, primarily in radio and television.

==History==
Tony Bell was managing director of the business between 1993 and 2007, when it was purchased to become Southern Cross Media Group, and retired from the subsequent company&#x27;s board of directors in 2014.

* September 1998 - Southern Cross Broadcasting announces it will purchase Adelaide&#x27;s Channel Nine station (NWS-9) for $98 million, which led to redundancies for nearly half of the station&#x27;s staff.
* May 2001 - It announced a $217 million bid for Telecasters Australia, owner of television stations in regional Queensland, northern New South Wales, Darwin and Remote/Central Australia markets.
* April 2002 - It purchased Spencer Gulf Telecasters, owner of regional South Australia&#x27;s GTS/BKN stations.
* 30 May 2007 - It announced its sale of Channel Nine Adelaide to WIN Corporation for A$105 million.
* 3 July 2007 - Southern Cross Broadcasting recommended Macquarie Media Group&#x27;s offer of A$1.35 billion, for a takeover of the corporation. The proposed Scheme is subject to approval by SCB shareholders at a Scheme Meeting expected to be held in October 2007.

* 3 July 2007 - If the sale to Macquarie Media Group is successful, MMG have a separate arrangement directly with Fairfax Media to on-sell to them Southern Cross Broadcasting&#x27;s radio assets, as well as the Southern Star Group, Satellite Music Australia and their digital media businesses. Only Southern Cross&#x27;s television stations would remain with Macquarie Media Group. Conversely, Fairfax&#x27;s radio assets would become part of Maquarie.
* 5 November 2007 - The company&#x27;s assets were officially acquired by the Macquarie Media Group.

<doc id="509494" wikidata="Q7883843" url="?curid=509494" title="Underwater (Delerium song)">
<text>&quot;Underwater&quot; is a single by Canadian electronic music group Delerium, featuring Australian singer Rani Kamal (daughter of Kamahl) on vocals. It was the second single released from the album, &quot;Poem&quot;, and reached number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play chart in the U.S.

==Song==
The album version of the song has a slow, ambient arrangement focused primarily on strings performances. Like nearly all Delerium singles to date since &quot;Silence&quot;, the single release put greater emphasis on a number of trance remixes commissioned by Nettwerk Music Group to promote the song through club play.

Notable remixers featured on the various releases of the single include Above &amp; Beyond, Rank 1, Hydrogen Rockers (an alias of Dirty Vegas), and Peter Luts (of Ian Van Dahl and Lasgo).

The music video for the song was directed by directors collective Twobigeyes. It was aired in two different edits, which were set to the Above &amp; Beyond remix (the more common version) and the Rank 1 remix.

<doc id="509495" wikidata="Q1071808" url="?curid=509495" title="Chicago-style pizza">
<text>Chicago-style pizza is pizza prepared according to several styles developed in Chicago. It can refer to both the well-known deep-dish or stuffed pizzas and the lesser-known thin-crust &quot;tavern-style&quot; pizzas. The pan in which deep-dish pizza is baked gives the pizza its characteristically high edge, which provides ample space for large amounts of cheese and a chunky tomato sauce. Chicago-style deep-dish pizza may be prepared either this way or stuffed. Chicago-style thin-crust pizza dough is rolled for a thinner, crispier crust than other thin-crust styles, and the pizza is cut in squares instead of slices.

==Deep-dish==
Chicago-style deep-dish pizza was invented at Pizzeria Uno in Chicago, founded by Ike Sewell and Richard Riccardo in 1943. Riccardo&#x27;s original recipe for a pizza cooked in a pie pan or cake tin was published in 1945 and included a dough made with scalded milk, butter, and sugar. The restaurant&#x27;s cook Alice Mae Redmond later adjusted the recipe to be made with water and olive oil and a &quot;secret dough conditioner&quot; to make it stretch better. In the 1960s and &#x27;70s the dough ball became larger to cover the full sides of the pan, with a higher fat percentage. Redmond later worked at Gino&#x27;s East, founded in 1966, where she made a fattier, biscuit-like dough.

Uno&#x27;s original pizza chef Rudy Malnati has also been credited for development of the recipe. Rudy&#x27;s sons Lou and Rudy Jr., who also worked at Pizzeria Uno, later respectively founded Lou Malnati&#x27;s Pizzeria in 1971 and Pizano&#x27;s in 1991, both also known for their deep-dish pizzas.

The thick pizza crust, sometimes made with cornmeal for texture, may be parbaked before the toppings are added to give it greater spring. In traditional recipes, the top of the crust is layered with meats and/or vegetables and mozzarella cheese while the sides rise to the top of the pan, and then a layer of crushed tomatoes is ladled over the top and the whole pizza is baked to completion.

==Stuffed pizza==

By the mid-1970s, two Chicago chains, Nancy&#x27;s Pizza, founded by Rocco Palese, and Giordano&#x27;s Pizzeria, operated by brothers Efren and Joseph Boglio, began experimenting with deep-dish pizza and created the stuffed pizza. Palese based his creation on his mother&#x27;s recipe for , an Italian Easter pie from his hometown of Potenza in Basilicata at the far southern end of the Italian Peninsula, more commonly known in Italy as pizza rustica Lucana. The primary differences between a stuffed pizza and a deep dish pizza are that stuffed pizzas are typically deeper, have another layer of dough covering the toppings, and have more cheese than deep dish pizza, while deep dish tends to have more sauce.

==Thin-crust or tavern-style pizza==

There is also a style of thin-crust pizza known as &quot;tavern style&quot;. Residents of two cities claim to have originated it in the 1940s: Milwaukee and Chicago.

This pizza has a crust firm enough to have a noticeable crunch and the slices are cut into squares, as opposed to wedges. The name &quot;tavern-style&quot; comes from the pizzas originally being served in taverns, often as an enticement to drink alcohol. This origin in taverns is also linked to the pizza&#x27;s shape, as the square shape of the slices made it possible for taverns that did not have plates to instead set them on napkins.

, according to Grubhub data and the company Chicago Pizza Tours, thin-crust outsells the more widely known deep-dish style among locals, with GrubHub stating that deep-dish comprises only 9% of its pizza deliveries. In response, Technomics food industry researcher Darren Tristano questioned GrubHub&#x27;s conclusion on the basis of the delivery service&#x27;s user demographics, saying that its younger users can not afford deep dish pizza, while NPR noted that the data would not include information on two particular deep-dish chains (though with just 20 restaurants in the city of 2.7million) that are not on GrubHub.

==Toppings==
The typical toppings commonly found on pizzas in most of North America (such as sausage, pepperoni, onions, and mushrooms) are also standards in Chicago-area pizzerias. A survey in 2013 indicated that while the most popular pizza topping in most of the United States is pepperoni, in Chicago the most popular topping is Italian sausage.

<doc id="509497" wikidata="Q707857" url="?curid=509497" title="Scott LaFaro">
<text>Rocco Scott LaFaro (April 3, 1936 – July 6, 1961) was an American jazz double bassist known for his work with the Bill Evans Trio. LaFaro broke new ground on the instrument, developing a countermelodic style of accompaniment rather than playing traditional walking basslines, as well as virtuosity that was practically unmatched by any of his contemporaries. Despite his short career and death at the age of 25, he remains one of the most influential jazz bassists, and was ranked number 16 on &quot;Bass Player&quot; magazine&#x27;s top 100 bass players of all time.

==Early life==
LaFaro was born in Newark, New Jersey, the son of a big band musician. He was five when his family moved to Geneva, New York. He started playing piano in elementary school, bass clarinet in middle school, and tenor saxophone when he entered high school. He took up double bass at 18 before entering college because learning a string instrument was required of music education majors. After three months at Ithaca College, he concentrated on bass. He played in groups at the College Spa and Joe&#x27;s Restaurant on State Street in downtown Ithaca.

==Career==
Beginning in 1955, he was a member of the Buddy Morrow big band. He left that organization to work in Los Angeles. LaFaro spent most of his days practicing his instrument. He practiced from sheet music for the higher-pitched clarinet to improve his facility with the upper register for bass. Fellow bassist Red Mitchell taught him how to pluck strings with both the index and middle fingers independently. For much of 1958, LaFaro was with pianist/vibraphonist Victor Feldman&#x27;s band.

In 1959, after working with trumpeter Chet Baker, bandleader Stan Kenton, vibraphonist Cal Tjader, and clarinetist Benny Goodman, LaFaro returned east and joined Bill Evans, who had recently left the Miles Davis Sextet. With Evans and drummer Paul Motian he developed the counter-melodic style that would come to characterize his playing. Evans, LaFaro, and Motian were committed to the idea of three equal voices in the trio, working together for a singular musical idea and often without any musician explicitly keeping time.

By late 1960, LaFaro was in demand as a bassist. He replaced Charlie Haden as Ornette Coleman&#x27;s bassist in January 1961. For a time, Haden and LaFaro shared an apartment. He also played in Stan Getz&#x27;s band between jobs with the Bill Evans trio. Around this time he received a greeting card from Miles Davis suggesting that Davis wanted to hire him.

In June 1961, the Bill Evans trio began two weeks of performances at the Village Vanguard in New York City. The trio attracted attention for its style. The last day was recorded for two albums, &quot;Sunday at the Village Vanguard&quot; and &quot;Waltz for Debby&quot;.

==Death==
LaFaro died in an automobile accident on July 6, 1961, in Seneca, New York, on U.S. Route 20 between Geneva and Canandaigua, four days after accompanying Stan Getz at the Newport Jazz Festival. According to Paul Motian, the death of LaFaro left Bill Evans &quot;numb with grief,&quot; &quot;in a state of shock,&quot; and &quot;like a ghost.&quot; Obsessively, he played &quot;I Loves You, Porgy,&quot; a tune that had become synonymous with him and LaFaro. Evans stopped performing for several months.

Evans said that LaFaro had been &quot;one of the most, if not &quot;the&quot; most outstanding talents in jazz.&quot; Legendary bassist Ray Brown added, &quot;This was one of the most talented youngsters I&#x27;ve seen come up in a long time. For his age, he really had it covered. ... It&#x27;s a shame, really a shame. It&#x27;s going to set the instrument back ten years.&quot; Motian noted, &quot;We were supposed to make a record date with Miles [Davis]: the trio, Bill, myself and Scott. ... We were talking to Miles about it, it was all set up, and then Scott got killed and the whole thing got forgotten.&quot;

==Instruments==
LaFaro started his professional career playing a German-made Mittenwald double bass, but it was stolen in the spring of 1958.

Shortly after, he acquired a bass made in 1825 in Concord, New Hampshire, by Abraham Prescott. The top of the instrument is a three-piece plate of slab-cut fir; the back is a two-piece plate of moderately flamed maple with an ebony inlay at the center joint; the sides are made of matching maple. It has rolled corners on the bottom and very sloped shoulders on the top, making it easier to get in and out of thumb position. LaFaro continued to play this bass until his death. The bass was badly damaged in the automobile accident that killed him, but was eventually restored and is sporadically used in performance to honor LaFaro.

Bill Evans said of LaFaro&#x27;s Prescott bass: &quot;It had a marvelous sustaining and resonating quality. He would be playing in the hotel room and hit a quadruple stop that was a harmonious sound, and then set the bass on its side and it seemed the sound just rang and rang for so long.&quot;

In 2008, Evans&#x27;s final bassist, Marc Johnson, played LaFaro&#x27;s bass on an Evans tribute album recorded by Johnson&#x27;s wife, Eliane Elias, titled &quot;Something for You: Eliane Elias Sings &amp; Plays Bill Evans.

== Posthumously released items ==
In 1988, Insights label of RVC Corporation in Japan released &quot;Memories for Scotty&quot;. The album included five tracks recorded in New York City during 1961 with pianist Don Friedman and drummer Pete LaRoca.

In 2009, Resonance Records reissued five tracks from &quot;Memories for Scotty&quot; on &quot;Pieces of Jade&quot;, together with twenty-two minutes of LaFaro and Bill Evans practising &quot;My Foolish Heart&quot; during a rehearsal in 1960.
Also in 2009, Helene LaFaro-Fernandez&#x27; biography of her brother Scott, titled &quot;Jade Visions&quot;, was published by the University of North Texas Press, with an extensive discography.

==Honors==
On March 5, 2014, the City Council of Geneva, New York approved making April 3 Scott LaFaro Day. On April 4, 2014, a ceremony to rename a downtown street Scott LaFaro Drive took place.

According to Joachim Berendt, LaFaro&#x27;s innovative approach to the bass caused &quot;emancipation,&quot; introducing &quot;so many diverse possibilities as would have been thought impossible for the bass only a short time before.&quot;

Bassist Charlie Haden recalled:

<doc id="509500" wikidata="Q1307337" url="?curid=509500" title="Social influence">
<text>Social influence comprises the ways in which individuals adjust their behavior to meet the demands of a social environment. It takes many forms and can be seen in conformity, socialization, peer pressure, obedience, leadership, persuasion, sales, and marketing. Typically social influence results from a specific action, command, or request, but people also alter their attitudes and behaviors in response to what they perceive others might do or think. In 1958, Harvard psychologist Herbert Kelman identified three broad varieties of social influence.

#[[Compliance (psychology)|Compliance]] is when people appear to agree with others but actually keep their dissenting opinions private.
#[[Identification (psychology)|Identification]] is when people are influenced by someone who is liked and respected, such as a famous celebrity.
#[[Internalisation (sociology)|Internalization]] is when people accept a belief or behavior and agree both publicly and privately.

Morton Deutsch and Harold Gerard described two psychological needs that lead humans to conform to the expectations of others. These include our need to be right (informational social influence) and our need to be liked (normative social influence). Informational influence (or &quot;social proof&quot;) is an influence to accept information from another as evidence about reality. Informational influence comes into play when people are uncertain, either from stimuli being intrinsically ambiguous or because of social disagreement. Normative influence is an influence to conform to the positive expectations of others. In terms of Kelman&#x27;s typology, normative influence leads to public compliance, whereas informational influence leads to private acceptance.

==Types==

Social influence is a broad term that relates to many different phenomena. Listed below are some major types of social influence that are being researched in the field of social psychology. For more information, follow the main article links provided.

===Kelman&#x27;s varieties===
There are three processes of attitude change as defined by Harvard psychologist Herbert Kelman in a 1958 paper published in the &quot;Journal of Conflict Resolution&quot;. The purpose of defining these processes was to help determine the effects of social influence: for example, to separate public conformity (behavior) from private acceptance (personal belief).

====Compliance====

Compliance is the act of responding favorably to an explicit or implicit request offered by others. Technically, compliance is a change in behavior but not necessarily in attitude; one can comply due to mere obedience or by otherwise opting to withhold private thoughts due to social pressures. According to Kelman&#x27;s 1958 paper, the satisfaction derived from compliance is due to the social effect of the accepting influence (i.e., people comply for an expected reward or punishment-aversion).

====Identification====

Identification is the changing of attitudes or behaviors due to the influence of someone who is admired. Advertisements that rely upon celebrity endorsements to market their products are taking advantage of this phenomenon. According to Kelman, the desired relationship that the identifier relates to the behavior or attitude change.

====Internalization====

Internalization is the process of acceptance of a set of norms established by people or groups that are influential to the individual. The individual accepts the influence because the content of the influence accepted is intrinsically rewarding. It is congruent with the individual&#x27;s value system, and according to Kelman the &quot;reward&quot; of internalization is &quot;the content of the new behavior&quot;.

===Conformity===

Conformity is a type of social influence involving a change in behavior, belief, or thinking to align with those of others or with normative standards. It is the most common and pervasive form of social influence. Social psychology research in conformity tends to distinguish between two varieties: informational conformity (also called &quot;social proof&quot;, or &quot;internalization&quot; in Kelman&#x27;s terms ) and normative conformity (&quot;compliance&quot; in Kelman&#x27;s terms).

===Minority influence===

Researchers have been studying social influence and minority influence for over thirty years. The first publication covering these topics was written by social psychologist Serge Moscovici and published in 1976. Minority influence takes place when a majority is influenced to accept the beliefs or behaviors of a minority. Minority influence can be affected by the sizes of majority and minority groups, the level of consistency of the minority group, and situational factors (such as the affluence or social importance of the minority). Minority influence most often operates through informational social influence (as opposed to normative social influence) because the majority may be indifferent to the liking of the minority.

===Self-fulfilling prophecy===

A self-fulfilling prophecy is a prediction that directly or indirectly causes itself to become true due to positive feedback between belief and behavior. A prophecy declared as truth (when it is actually false) may sufficiently influence people, either through fear or logical confusion, so that their reactions ultimately fulfill the once-false prophecy. This term is credited to sociologist Robert K. Merton from an article he published in 1948.

===Social contagion===

Social contagion involves the spontaneous spread of behaviors or emotions through a group, population or social network. Social contagion consists of two categories, behavioral contagion and emotional contagion. Unlike conformity, the emotion or behavior being adopted may not represent a social norm.

===Reactance===

Reactance is the adoption of a view contrary to the view that a person is being pressured to accept, perhaps due to a perceived threat to behavioral freedoms. This phenomenon has also been called &quot;anticonformity&quot;. While the results are the opposite of what the influencer intended, the reactive behavior is a result of social pressure. It is notable that anticonformity does not necessarily mean &quot;independence&quot;. In many studies, reactance manifests itself in a deliberate rejection of an influence, even if the influence is clearly correct.

===Obedience===

Obedience is a form of social influence that derives from an authority figure, based on order or command. The Milgram experiment, Zimbardo&#x27;s Stanford prison experiment, and the Hofling hospital experiment are three particularly well-known experiments on obedience, and they all conclude that humans are surprisingly obedient in the presence of perceived legitimate authority figures.

===Persuasion===

Persuasion is the process of guiding oneself or another toward the adoption of an attitude by rational or symbolic means. US psychologist Robert Cialdini defined six &quot;weapons of influence&quot;: reciprocity, commitment, social proof, authority, liking, and scarcity to bring about conformity by directed means. Persuasion can occur through appeals to reason or appeals to emotion.

===Psychological manipulation===

Psychological manipulation is a type of social influence that aims to change the behavior or perception of others through abusive, deceptive, or underhanded tactics. By advancing the interests of the manipulator, often at another&#x27;s expense, such methods could be considered exploitative, abusive, devious, and deceptive.
Social influence is not necessarily negative. For example, doctors can try to persuade patients to change unhealthy habits. Social influence is generally perceived to be harmless when it respects the right of the influenced to accept or reject it, and is not unduly coercive. Depending on the context and motivations, social influence may constitute underhanded manipulation.

===Abusive power and control===

Controlling abusers use various tactics to exert power and control over their victims. Tactics may include coercion and threats, intimidation, emotional abuse, isolation, and more. The goal of the abuser is to control and intimidate the victim or to influence them to feel that they do not have an equal voice in the relationship. Political entities may employ patterns of similar techniques in the exertion of abusive power and control over persons subject to them.

===Propaganda===

Propaganda is information that is not objective and is used primarily to influence an audience and further an agenda, often by presenting facts selectively to encourage a particular synthesis or perception, or using loaded language to produce an emotional rather than a rational response to the information that is presented.

===Hard power===

Hard power is the use of military and economic means to influence the behavior or interests of other political bodies. This form of political power is often aggressive (coercion), and is most effective when imposed by one political body upon another of lesser military and/or economic power. Hard power contrasts with soft power, which comes from diplomacy, culture and history.

== Antecedents ==
Many factors can affect the impact of social influence.

===Social impact theory===

Social impact theory was developed by Bibb Latané in 1981. This theory asserts that there are three factors which increase a person&#x27;s likelihood to respond to social influence:

*&quot;Strength&quot;: The importance of the influencing group to the individual
*&quot;Immediacy&quot;: Physical (and temporal) proximity of the influencing group to the individual at the time of the influence attempt
*&quot;Number&quot;: The number of people in the group

===Cialdini&#x27;s &quot;weapons of influence&quot;===
Robert Cialdini defines six &quot;weapons of influence&quot; that can contribute to an individual&#x27;s propensity to be influenced by a persuader:
*Reciprocity: People tend to return a favor.
*Commitment and consistency: People do not like to be self-contradictory. Once they commit to an idea or behavior, they are averse to changing their minds without good reason.
*Social proof: People will be more open to things that they see others doing. For example, seeing others compost their organic waste after finishing a meal may influence the subject to do so as well.
*Authority: People will tend to obey authority figures.
*Liking: People are more easily swayed by people they like.
*Scarcity: A perceived limitation of resources will generate demand.

===Unanimity===
Social Influence is strongest when the group perpetrating it is consistent and committed. Even a single instance of dissent can greatly wane the strength of an influence. For example, in Milgram&#x27;s first set of obedience experiments, 65% of participants complied with fake authority figures to administer &quot;maximum shocks&quot; to a confederate. In iterations of the Milgram experiment where three people administered shocks (two of whom were confederates), once one confederate disobeyed, only ten percent of subjects administered the maximum shocks.

=== Status ===
Those perceived as experts may exert social influence as a result of their perceived expertise. This involves credibility, a tool of social influence from which one draws upon the notion of trust. People believe an individual to be credible for a variety of reasons, such as perceived experience, attractiveness, knowledge, etc. Additionally, pressure to maintain one&#x27;s reputation and not be viewed as fringe may increase the tendency to agree with the group. This phenomenon is known as groupthink. Appeals to authority may especially effect norms of obedience. The compliance of normal humans to authority in the famous Milgram experiment demonstrate the power of perceived authority.

Those with access to the media may use this access in an attempt to influence the public. For example, a politician may use speeches to persuade the public to support issues that he or she does not have the power to impose on the public. This is often referred to as using the &quot;bully pulpit.&quot; Likewise, celebrities do not usually possess any political power, but they are familiar to many of the world&#x27;s citizens and, therefore, possess social status.

Power is one of the biggest reasons an individual feels the need to follow through with the suggestions of another. A person who possesses more authority (or is perceived as being more powerful) than others in a group is an icon or is most &quot;popular&quot; within a group. This person has the most influence over others. For example, in a child&#x27;s school life, people who seem to control the perceptions of the students at school are most powerful in having a social influence over other children.

=== Culture ===

Culture appears to play a role in the willingness of an individual to conform to the standards of a group. Stanley Milgram found that conformity was higher in Norway than in France. This has been attributed to Norway&#x27;s longstanding tradition of social responsibility, compared to France&#x27;s cultural focus on individualism. Japan likewise has a collectivist culture and thus a higher propensity to conformity. However, a 1970 Asch-style study found that when alienated, Japanese students were more susceptible to &quot;anticonformity&quot; (giving answers that were &quot;incorrect&quot; even when the group had collaborated on &quot;correct&quot; answers) one third of the time, significantly higher than has been seen in Asch studies in the past.

While gender does not significantly affect a person&#x27;s likelihood to conform, under certain conditions gender roles do affect such a likelihood. Studies from the 1950s and 1960s concluded that women were more likely to conform than men. But a 1971 study found that experimenter bias was involved; all of the researchers were male, while all of the research participants were female. Studies thereafter found that the likelihood to conform almost equal between the genders. Furthermore, men conformed more often when faced with traditionally feminine topics, and women conformed more often when presented with masculine topics. In other words, ignorance about a subject can lead a person to defer to &quot;social proof&quot;.

=== Emotions ===

Emotion and disposition may affect an individual&#x27;s likelihood of conformity or anticonformity. In 2009, a study concluded that fear increases the chance of agreeing with a group, while romance or lust increases the chance of going against the group.

== Social structure ==

===Social networks===

A social network is a social structure made up of nodes (representing individuals or organizations) which are connected (through &quot;ties&quot;, also called &quot;edges&quot;, &quot;connections&quot;, or &quot;links&quot;) by one or more types of interdependency (such as friendship, common interests or beliefs, sexual relations, or kinship). Social network analysis uses the lens of network theory to examine social relationships. Social network analysis as a field has become more prominent since the mid-20th century in determining the channels and effects of social influence. For example, Christakis and Fowler found that social networks transmit states and behaviors such as obesity, smoking, drinking and happiness.

However, important flaws have been identified in the contagion model for social influence which is assumed and used in many of the above studies. In order to address these flaws, causal inference methods have been proposed instead, to systematically disentangle social influence from other possible confounding causes when using observational data.

== Global approach to the phenomenon of influence ==

===Provisional introduction===

As described above, theoretical approaches are in the form of knowledge clusters. A global theory of influence is missing for an easy understanding and an education to protect from manipulators. A first tentative was published in 2012. The first pages of &quot;Influence &amp; Systems&quot; explain why a global approach is necessary.

<text>Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen (, 27 May 1946 – 19 April 2005), also known by his abbreviated nickname NHØP, was a Danish jazz double bassist.

==Biography==
Pedersen was born in Osted, near Roskilde, on the Danish island of Zealand, the son of a church organist. As a child, Ørsted Pedersen played piano, but from the age of 13, he started learning to play upright bass and at the age of 14, while studying, he began his professional jazz career in Denmark with his first band, Jazzkvintet 60 (Danish for Jazz Quintet 60). By the age of fifteen, he had the ability to accompany leading musicians at nightclubs, working regularly at Copenhagen&#x27;s Jazzhus Montmartre, after his debut there on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1961, when he was only 15. When seventeen, he had already turned down an offer to join the Count Basie orchestra, mainly because he was too young to get legal permission to live and work as a musician in the United States.

The Montmartre was a regular stop-off for touring American Jazz stars, and as a member of the house band, the young Ørsted Pedersen performed with saxophonists such as Booker Ervin, Sonny Rollins, Dexter Gordon, Rahsaan Roland Kirk and Stan Getz, and pianist Bill Evans, with whom he toured in Europe in 1965. During the 1960s, Pedersen played with a series of other important American jazzmen who were touring or resident in Denmark, including Ben Webster, Brew Moore, Bud Powell, Count Basie, Roy Eldridge, Dizzy Gillespie, Jackie McLean, and vocalist Ella Fitzgerald. 

He is perhaps best known for his extensive collaboration with Oscar Peterson from 1972 to 1987. His predecessor, Ray Brown, thought highly of the Dane and regarded him as the only upright bassist equal to the task of keeping up with the pianist. He was awarded Best Bass Player of the Year by &quot;DownBeat&quot; Critics&#x27; Poll in 1981.

Ørsted Pedersen worked in duo and trio arrangements with pianist Kenny Drew, recording over 50 albums together. He also worked with Stéphane Grappelli and Joe Pass and recorded extensively as a leader. His best known songs are &quot;My Little Anna&quot;, &quot;Jaywalkin&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;The Puzzle&quot;, as well as jazz arrangements of traditional Danish folk songs. A duo performance with Rune Gustafsson at Vossajazz 1980, concluded on the album &quot;Just The Way You Are&quot; on the label Sonet Gramofon, recorded half a year after this first meeting. He was awarded the Nordic Council Music Prize in 1991. 

Pedersen had a particular ability to interpret Danish songs and folk melodies. He often played within trio ensembles, partly collectively with the trumpeter Palle Mikkelborg and the keyboard player Kenneth Knudsen, and partly under his own name, usually with guitarists like Philip Catherine and Ulf Wakenius. In 1999, he co-led a duo with pianist Mulgrew Miller, touring Europe, Japan, Australia, and Korea. This format was later enlarged into a trio featuring drummer Alvin Queen. This trio remained intact until Pedersen&#x27;s death.

== Death ==

Ørsted Pedersen died of heart failure in 2005 at the age of 58 in Copenhagen, Denmark. He was survived by his wife, Solveig, and his three children.

<text>In photography and cinematography, perspective distortion is a warping or transformation of an object and its surrounding area that differs significantly from what the object would look like with a normal focal length, due to the relative scale of nearby and distant features. Perspective distortion is determined by the relative distances at which the image is captured and viewed, and is due to the angle of view of the image (as captured) being either wider or narrower than the angle of view at which the image is viewed, hence the apparent relative distances differing from what is expected. Related to this concept is axial magnification – the perceived depth of objects at a given magnification.

Perspective distortion takes two forms: &quot;extension distortion&quot; and &quot;compression distortion,&quot; also called &quot;wide-angle distortion&quot; and &quot;long-lens&quot; or &quot;telephoto distortion,&quot; when talking about images with the same field size. Extension or wide-angle distortion can be seen in images shot from close using a wide-angle lens (with an angle of view wider than a &quot;normal lens&quot;). Objects close to the lens appear abnormally large relative to more distant objects, and distant objects appear abnormally small and hence farther away – distances are extended. Compression, long-lens, or telephoto distortion can be seen in images shot from a distance using a long focus lens or the more common telephoto sub-type (with an angle of view narrower than a &quot;normal lens&quot;). Distant objects look approximately the same size – closer objects are abnormally small, and more distant objects are abnormally large, and hence the viewer cannot discern relative distances between distant objects – distances are compressed.

Note that linear perspective changes are caused by &quot;distance,&quot; not by the lens per se – two shots of the same scene from the same distance will exhibit identical perspective geometry, regardless of lens used. However, since wide-angle lenses have a wider field of view, they are generally used from closer, while telephoto lenses have a narrower field of view and are generally used from farther away. For example, if standing at a distance so that a normal lens captures someone&#x27;s face, a shot with a wide-angle lens or telephoto lens from the same distance will have exactly the same linear perspective geometry on the face, though the wide-angle lens may fit the entire body into the shot, while the telephoto lens captures only the nose. However, crops of these three images with the same coverage will yield the same perspective distortion – the nose will look the same in all three. Conversely, if all three lenses are used from distances such that the face fills the field, the wide-angle will be used from closer, making the nose larger compared to the rest of the photo, and the telephoto will be used from farther, making the nose smaller compared to the rest of the photo.

Outside photography, extension distortion is familiar to many through side-view mirrors (see &quot;objects in mirror are closer than they appear&quot;) and peepholes, though these often use a fisheye lens, exhibiting different distortion. Compression distortion is most familiar in looking through binoculars or telescopes, as in telescopic sights, while a similar effect is seen in fixed-slit strip photography, notably a photo finish, where all capture is parallel to the capture, completely eliminating perspective (a side view).

== History ==

The concept of perspective distortion has fascinated artists, architects, and scientists for centuries, evolving alongside the development of visual culture and optical theory. Perspective distortion refers to the manipulation of visual perception through deliberate techniques that create altered or exaggerated views of objects or scenes. This concept has not only shaped art and architecture but has also played a critical role in challenging and expanding the limits of human perception.

The roots of perspective distortion trace back to ancient civilizations, where early artists sought to represent three-dimensional objects on two-dimensional surfaces. Ancient Egyptian art and Mesopotamian art often featured composite perspectives, blending different viewpoints into a single scene to communicate symbolic or hierarchical meaning. This approach was less about realism and more about conveying importance, with objects or figures often distorted to fit a cultural or narrative framework.

The formalization of linear perspective in Renaissance Europe marked a turning point in the history of perspective distortion. Pioneered by figures like Filippo Brunelleschi and Leon Battista Alberti, linear perspective provided a systematic approach to creating the illusion of depth on flat surfaces. Artists like Leonardo da Vinci and Albrecht Dürer mastered this technique, but others began experimenting with its limits. Anamorphosis, a form of perspective distortion where an image appears distorted unless viewed from a specific angle, emerged during this period. Hans Holbein the Younger’s The Ambassadors (1533) famously employs this technique, featuring a distorted skull visible only when viewed obliquely, symbolizing the transient nature of life.

In the 20th century, perspective distortion expanded into photography and modern art, with wide-angle and telephoto lenses creating exaggerated or compressed views. Photographers like André Kertész used distortion to evoke emotional or psychological responses, while surrealists like Salvador Dalí distorted perspective to challenge reality itself. Fred Leeman’s Hidden Image: Games of Perception delves into how perspective distortion is used for “playful subversion,” encouraging viewers to question their visual assumptions and engage in the active process of interpretation.

== Optics ==

Consider an idealised Gaussian optical system, with the image and the object in the same medium. Thus, for an object in focus, the distance between the lens and image plane the distance between lens and the object and the focal length formula_1 are related by the thin-lens equation:

formula_2

The transverse magnification formula_3 is related by

formula_4

The &quot;axial magnification&quot; formula_5 of an object at formula_6 is the rate of change of the lens–image distance formula_7 as the lens–object distance formula_6 changes. For an object of finite depth, one can conceive of the axial magnification as the ratio of the depth of the image and the depth of the object:

formula_9

As the magnification increases, the ratio of axial to transverse magnification also increases. For example, if then and the image will be twice as tall and four times as deep as the object.

== Influencing factors ==

Perspective distortion is influenced by the relationship between two factors: the angle of view at which the image is captured by the camera and the angle of view at which the photograph of the subject is presented or viewed.

=== Angle of view of the capture ===

When photographs are viewed &quot;at the ordinary viewing distance&quot;, the angle of view at which the image is captured accounts completely for the appearance of perspective distortion. The general assumption that &quot;undoctored&quot; photos cannot distort a scene is incorrect. Perspective distortion is particularly noticeable in portraits taken with wide-angle lenses at short camera-to-subject distances. They generally give an unpleasant impression, making the nose appear too large with respect to the rest of the face, and distorting the facial expression. Framing the same subject identically while using a moderate telephoto or long focus lens (with a narrow angle of view) flattens the image to a more flattering perspective. It is for this reason that, for a 35 mm camera, lenses with focal lengths from about 85 through 135 mm are generally considered to be good portrait lenses. It does however make difference, whether the photograph is taken landscape or portrait. A 50 mm lens is suitable for photographing people when the orientation is landscape. Conversely, using lenses with much longer focal lengths for portraits results in more extreme flattening of facial features, which also may be objectionable to the viewer.

=== Photograph viewing distance ===

Photographs are ordinarily viewed at a distance approximately equal to their diagonal. When viewed at this distance, the distortion effects created by the angle of view of the capture are apparent. However, theoretically, if one views pictures exhibiting extension (wide angle) distortion at a closer distance, thus widening the angle of view of the presentation, then the phenomenon abates. Similarly, viewing pictures exhibiting compression (telephoto) distortion from a greater distance, thus narrowing the angle of view of the presentation, reduces the effect. In both cases, at some critical distance, the apparent distortion disappears completely.

=== Examples ===

Below, a series of three photos shows the same scene shot from the same position with three different lenses: a wide-angle lens, a normal lens, and a telephoto lens. Notice that because the proportions in the image do not change with the angle of view, if the photos made with the wide-angle lens and the normal lens were cropped to contain the same scene as the photo made with the telephoto lens, then the image content would be exactly the same. The apparent difference in proportions results solely from the content added around the edges of the frame in the normal lens photo and the wide-angle photo.

Below, a series of four photos shows an object framed as nearly the same as possible with four different lenses. As a result of the different angle of view of each lens, the photographer moved closer to the object with each photo. Note that the angle of view changes significantly (compare the background in each photo), and the distance between objects appears greater with each succeeding image. In the fourth image at the lower right, taken with the widest lens, the building behind the object appears much further away than in reality.

== Artistic uses ==
=== Technical background ===

Although perspective distortion is often annoying when unintended, it is also intentionally used for artistic purposes. Extension (wide angle) distortion is often implemented to emphasize some element of the scene by making it appear larger and spatially removed from the other elements. Compression (telephoto) distortion is often used to give the appearance of compressed distance between distant objects, such as buildings or automobiles in order to convey a feeling of congestion. Longer lenses magnify the subject more, apparently compressing distance and (when focused on the foreground) blurring the background because of their shallower depth of field. Wider lenses tend to magnify distance between objects while allowing greater depth of field.

Another result of using a wide-angle lens is a greater apparent perspective distortion when the camera is not aligned perpendicularly to the subject: parallel lines converge at the same rate as with a normal lens, but converge more due to the wider total field. For example, buildings appear to be falling backwards much more severely when the camera is pointed upward from ground level than they would if photographed with a normal lens at the same distance from the subject, because more of the subject building is visible in the wide-angle shot.

Because different lenses generally require a different camera–subject distance to preserve the size of a subject, changing the angle of view can indirectly distort perspective, changing the apparent relative size of the subject and background. If identical field size is maintained, wide-angle lenses make subjects appear larger by introducing size differences along with the converging lines mentioned above, and they make rooms and spaces around the subject appear more vast by increasing the distance between subject and background (expanded perspective).

=== Mood effect and famous uses ===

The mood effect of perspective distortion achieved by rectilinear extreme wide-angle lenses is that the resulting image looks grotesque and unsettling, while not looking as unrealistic as curvilinear fisheye lenses which display barrel distortion. The effect is especially noticeable the closer the camera is to the subject, as its amount increases the shorter the focal length is at the same field size.

One notable director that frequently employs rectilinear ultra wide angle lenses in order to achieve a distinctive signature style defined by extreme perspective distortion is Terry Gilliam. Also Stanley Kubrick (in &quot;Paths of Glory&quot;, and &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, among others) as well as Orson Welles (in &quot;The Trial&quot;, partly &quot;Orson Welles&#x27; London&quot;, segment &quot;Four Clubmen&quot;), Sam Peckinpah (in &quot;Straw Dogs&quot;), and Sidney Lumet (in &quot;The Offence&quot;) have occasionally done the same in the past, though mostly in moderation, for single shots or sequences only, while Gilliam hardly ever uses any lens longer than 14 mm, which has garnered lenses of that particular focal length the informal nickname &quot;The Gilliam&quot; among film-makers. Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro, two French filmmakers influenced by Gilliam, adopted his typical wide-angle photography in their two most &quot;Gilliamesque&quot; features, &quot;Delicatessen&quot; and &quot;The City of Lost Children&quot;. Orson Welles&#x27;s &quot;The Trial&quot; is notable for heavily influencing Gilliam&#x27;s signature style years before the American ex-patriate joined the Monty Python comedy troupe while only being a one-feature style for Welles.

Due to the grotesque, unsettling mood effect peculiar to wide-angle lenses, films making use of such perspective distortion can often be placed in one of two categories: Grotesque and surreal satire and fantasy, also to some extent black comedy (Gilliam, Jeunet &amp; Caro, Orson Welles, &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;) on the one hand, and serious, more realistic films with a particular edge for social criticism on the other, whereas social conventions, collective society, and/or the motives and acts of leaders are portrayed as grotesque and absurd, and often also feature tyrannical characters with conformist values who act out in an extremely hostile and prejudiced way towards individualism and outsiders (&quot;Paths of Glory&quot;, &quot;Straw Dogs&quot;, &quot;The Offence&quot;).

On the other end of the focal length spectre, Leni Riefenstahl used extreme telephoto lenses to compress large crowds in &quot;Triumph of the Will&quot; while the &quot;Führer&quot; Adolf Hitler is seen through normal lenses and often from a low angle to appear tall in comparison.

In cinematography, perspective distortion also has bearing on the in-camera special effect known as the dolly zoom, in which a zoom lens zooms out at the same time as the camera moves toward the subject, in such a way as to keep the subject the same size in the frame while the background &quot;changes size&quot; relative to the subject. This effect was made popular in the films &quot;Vertigo&quot; and &quot;Jaws&quot;. Another example of this can be seen in the first &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; film, just before the Black Rider comes down the road. The dolly zoom is used to create a compression effect in the road.

The photo below of the gondolas is an illustration of the use of extension distortion, and the photo of the buildings below it is an example of compression distortion.

<text>Abbott Lawrence Lowell (December 13, 1856 – January 6, 1943) was an American educator and legal scholar. He was president of Harvard University from 1909 to 1933.

With an &quot;aristocratic sense of mission and self-certainty,&quot; Lowell cut a large figure in American education and to some extent in public life as well. At Harvard University his years as president saw a remarkable expansion of the university in terms of the size of its physical infrastructure, its student body, and its endowment. His reform of undergraduate education established the system of majoring in a particular discipline that became the standard in American education.

His progressive reputation in education derived principally from his insistence on integrating social classes at Harvard and preventing students of wealthy backgrounds from living apart from their less wealthy peers, a position for which he was sometimes termed &quot;a traitor to his class.&quot; He also recognized the university&#x27;s obligation to serve the surrounding community, particularly in making college courses available to and putting college degrees within the reach of local schoolteachers. He took the progressive side on certain public issues as well. He demonstrated outspoken support for academic freedom during World War I and played a prominent role in urging the public to support American participation in the League of Nations following the war.

Yet his Harvard years saw two public disputes in which he argued for compromising basic principles of justice for the sake of his own personal vision of Harvard&#x27;s mission with respect to assimilating non-traditional students. In one instance, he tried to limit Jewish enrollment to 15% of the student body. In the other, he tried to ban African-American students from living in the Freshman Halls when all of Harvard&#x27;s new students were required to room there. In both cases the Harvard Board of Overseers insisted on the consistent application of liberal principles and overruled him.

One historian summarized his complex personality and legacy with these words: &quot;He played many characters—the rich man of simple tastes, the gentleman who loathed gentlemanly C&#x27;s, the passionate theorist of democracy whose personal conduct was suavely autocratic.&quot; The interplay of democratic and patrician instincts, and especially his insistence on defending his positions when others found them indefensible, made him hard for his contemporaries to grasp. As one historian posed the question: &quot;How could a consensus form around one who exasperated his friends as often as he confounded his enemies.&quot;

==Early years==
Lowell was born on December 13, 1856, in Boston, Massachusetts, the second son of Augustus Lowell and Katherine Bigelow Lowell. His mother was a cousin of architect Charles H. Bigelow. A member of the Brahmin Lowell family, his siblings included the poet Amy Lowell, the astronomer Percival Lowell, and Elizabeth Lowell Putnam, an early activist for prenatal care. They were the great-grandchildren of John Lowell and, on their mother&#x27;s side, the grandchildren of Abbott Lawrence.

Lowell graduated from Noble and Greenough School in 1873 and attended Harvard College where he presented a thesis for honors in mathematics that addressed using quaternions to treat quadrics and graduated in 1877. While at Harvard, he was a member of the Hasty Pudding. He graduated from Harvard Law School in 1880 and practiced law from 1880 to 1897 in partnership with his cousin, Francis Cabot Lowell, with whom he wrote &quot;Transfer of Stock in Corporations&quot;, which appeared in 1884. On June 19, 1879, while a law student, he married a distant cousin, Anna Parker Lowell in King&#x27;s Chapel in Boston and honeymooned in the Western U.S.

His first scholarly publications appeared before he undertook an academic career. &quot;Essays on Government&quot; appeared in 1889, designed to counter the arguments Woodrow Wilson made in his &quot;Congressional Government&quot;. The two volumes of &quot;Governments and Parties in Continental Europe&quot; followed in 1896. Lowell was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, joining his father and brother, in 1897. He became a trustee of MIT in 1897. In 1899 Lowell was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society. In 1909, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

==Harvard University==
In 1897, Lowell became lecturer, and in 1898, professor of government at Harvard. His publishing career continued with the appearance of &quot;Colonial Civil Service&quot; in 1900, and &quot;The Government of England&quot; in two volumes in 1908. In December 1901, Lowell and his wife donated funds anonymously to erect a building housing a large lecture hall, a facility the university lacked at the time. It became the New Lecture Hall (later renamed Lowell Lecture Hall), at the corner of Oxford and Kirkland Streets, and held a 928-seat auditorium as well as 8 meeting rooms. In the 1990s after being damaged , the hall was renovated and now has 352 seats in the main hall, and eight classrooms with capacity of 22-24 people.

From relatively early in his professional career, Lowell worried about the role of racial and ethnic minorities in American society. As early as 1887, he wrote of the Irish: &quot;What we need is not to dominate the Irish, but to absorb them ... We want them to become rich, and send their sons to our colleges, to share our prosperity and our sentiments. We do not want to feel that they are among us and yet not really part of us.&quot; He believed that only a homogeneous society could safeguard the achievements of American democracy. Sometime before 1906, he became an honorary vice-president of the Immigration Restriction League, an organization that promoted literacy tests and tightened enforcement of immigration laws. In 1910, he wrote approvingly in private of excluding Chinese immigrants entirely and of Southern states that denied the franchise to black citizens. Publicly he consistently adopted assimilation as the solution to absorbing other groups, limiting their numbers to levels he believed would allow American society to absorb them without being changed itself, a stance that &quot;fused liberal and racist ideas in making the case for exclusion.&quot;

He was an early member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In 1909, he became president of the American Political Science Association. That same year, he succeeded Charles William Eliot as president of Harvard University, a post he held for 24 years until his retirement in 1933.

Lowell received an honorary doctorate from the University of Leiden (the Netherlands) on 30 August 1919.

===Harvard reforms===
Lowell immediately embarked upon a series of reforms that were both academic and social in nature. Under his predecessor, Charles W. Eliot, Harvard had replaced the single standardized undergraduate course with a system that allowed students free choice of electives. That was a logical extension of the trend in U.S. education that had modeled the university on the German system, including the German principle of student freedom in choosing courses. So dominant was Harvard&#x27;s role in American education that all large American colleges and universities had adopted the elective system by 1904. It appealed to all student types, those intellectually curious and energetic as well as the lazy without intellectual ambition.

Lowell now implemented a second, equally revolutionary restructuring of undergraduate education. As early as his service on an ad hoc faculty Committee on Improving Instruction in 1903, he had determined that the elective system was a failure. Large numbers of students, lacking intellectual ambition, chose their courses with little concern for learning, more intent on the ease with which they could fulfill the course requirements, resulting in a course of study that was &quot;neither rigorous nor coherent.&quot; Lowell dismantled the elective system and in its place established concentration (what is commonly called a &quot;major&quot;) and distribution requirements that would soon become the new American model. Paired with the concentration requirement was a tutorial system in which every student had the guidance of a tutor to see he was prepared for examination in his area of concentration.

On admissions, Lowell continued Eliot&#x27;s attempts to broaden the backgrounds of the entering class. Eliot had abolished the requirement in Greek (1886) and Latin (1898) so that students from schools other than elite preparatory schools could gain entry. Lowell in 1909–10 added a new admission procedure that allowed students to qualify through a new examination process designed to admit &quot;the good scholar from a good school that does not habitually prepare for Harvard.&quot; The numbers of students from public schools grew steadily, forming a majority by 1913.

Educational practices were only one side of the crisis Lowell saw at Harvard. He analyzed the social divisions of the Harvard students in similar terms. As the admissions process changed over the years, Lowell recognized that the student body was divided sharply socially and by class, far from the cohesive body he remembered from a few decades earlier. Student living arrangements embodied and intensified the problem. As early as 1902, Lowell had decried the &quot;great danger of a snobbish separation of the students on lines of wealth,&quot; resulting in &quot;the loss of that democratic feeling which ought to lie at the basis of university life.&quot; Harvard had not built new dormitories even as the size of its undergraduate enrollment grew, so private capital constructed living quarters designed to serve as dormitory-like accommodations for those who afford it. That produced two classes, the underprivileged living in Harvard Yard in out-of-date buildings and the upper crust living on the &quot;Gold Coast&quot; of Mt. Auburn Street, the &quot;centre of social life.&quot;

Lowell&#x27;s long-term solution was a residential system that he only achieved with the opening of the residential houses in 1930. In the short term, Lowell raised funds and initiated construction projects that would permit the College to house all its freshmen together. The first Freshman Halls opened in 1914. In 1920, Harvard purchased the private dormitories on Mt. Auburn Street &quot;so that the student body may enjoy what was the privilege of the few.&quot;

===Lowell Institute and Harvard Extension School===
In 1900, Lowell succeeded his father as Trustee of the Lowell Institute, which Lowell&#x27;s great-grandfather founded to subsidize public lectures and popular education programs. Throughout the 40 years he headed the Institute, Lowell&#x27;s selection of topics and lecturers for the public series reflected his conservative tastes. Topics tended to history and government, with some science and music upon occasion. He ignored contemporary literature and current social trends. Typical were &quot;The War of 1812,&quot; &quot;The Development of Choral Music,&quot; &quot;The Migration of Birds,&quot; and &quot;American Orators and Oratory.&quot; A balanced series on &quot;Soviet Russia after Thirteen Years&quot; was an exception.

To the education programs Lowell brought his instinct for organization. He transformed the earlier variety of scientific courses into the School for Industrial Foremen at MIT, later called the Lowell Institute School, and focused its program on mechanical and electrical engineering. Stating that &quot;any popular education at the present day should be systematic,&quot; he hired Harvard professors to repeat their courses for an audience of adults in Boston in the late afternoon or evening, promising the same quality and examinations. When he became Harvard&#x27;s President, Lowell exploited his two positions to press further. In 1910, he led in the formation of a consortium of area schools, soon called the Commission on Extension Courses, that included Boston University, Boston College, MIT, Simmons, Tufts, Wellesley, and the Museum of Fine Arts. All agreed to provide similar courses and agreed to award the degree of Associate in Arts to students who completed the equivalent of a college program. He had earlier been approached by a committee of Boston schoolteachers, and he believed his extension program would &quot;put a college degree within the reach of schoolteachers.&quot; When the Harvard Overseers agreed in 1910 to appoint a dean for the Department of University Extension, the program&#x27;s 600 student were two-thirds female. Roughly a third of the students were teachers, a third office workers, and the remainder working at home. After 7 years, enrollment reached 1500.

When the schoolteachers asked why they were not entitled to the same bachelor&#x27;s degree as the Harvard College students, Lowell defended the distinction. Though courses were comparable, the programs and requirements were different, since the many specialized courses required of the College students could not be offered in the Extension Program. He meant the Associate in Arts degree to be distinctive. When Lowell learned in 1933 that other American schools had begun to award the Associate in Arts degree to students after the equivalent of just two years of work, he felt betrayed. He wrote: &quot;the name of Associate in Arts has been degraded, probably beyond recovery, by wicked, thievish, and otherwise disreputable institutions.&quot; Harvard responded with a new Adjunct in Arts.

===Academic freedom===

During World War I, when American universities were under great pressure to demonstrate their unambiguous commitment to the American war effort, Harvard under Lowell established a distinguished record of independence. &quot;The New York Times&quot; later wrote that Lowell &quot;steadfastly refused to accede to the demands of the hysterically patriotic that German subjects be dropped from the curriculum.&quot; When a Harvard alumnus threatened to withdraw a ten-million-dollar bequest unless a certain pro-German professor was dismissed, the Harvard Corporation refused to submit to his demand. Lowell&#x27;s uncompromising statement in support of academic freedom was a landmark event at a time when other universities were demanding compliant behavior from their faculty.

He similarly defended a student&#x27;s anti-German poem with a statement of principle in defense of free speech within the academic community. In 1915, Kuno Meyer a professor at the University of Berlin who was considering a temporary Harvard appointment, protested the publication of an undergraduate&#x27;s satirical poem in a college magazine. Lowell replied that freedom of speech played a different role in American universities than in their German counterparts. &quot;We have endeavored to maintain the right of all members of the university to express themselves freely, without censorship or supervision by the authorities of the university, and have applied this rule impartially to those who favor Germany and those who favor the Allies—to the former in the face of a pretty violent agitation for muzzling professors by alumni of the university and outsiders.&quot;

During the Boston police strike of 1919, Lowell called upon Harvard&#x27;s students &quot;to help in any way ... to maintain order and support the laws of the Commonwealth&quot; by providing security in place of the strikers. Harold Laski, a tutor in political science of socialist views and still too young to have a scholarly reputation, supported the strikers. Members of the University&#x27;s Board of Overseers began to talk of dismissing Laski, which provoked a threat from Lowell: &quot;If the Overseers ask for Laski&#x27;s resignation they will get mine!&quot;

Harvard&#x27;s Professor Zechariah Chafee paid tribute to Lowell&#x27;s defense of Harvard&#x27;s teachers and students by dedicating his 1920 study &quot;Free Speech in the United States&quot; to Lowell, &quot;whose wisdom and courage in the face of uneasy fears and stormy criticism made it unmistakably plain that so long as he was president no one could breathe the air of Harvard and not be free.&quot;

===Purge of homosexuals===
In 1920, the brother of a student who had recently died by suicide brought evidence of ongoing homosexual activity among the students to the College&#x27;s Acting Dean Chester N. Greenough. After consulting with Lowell and under his authority, the Dean convened an ad hoc tribunal of administrators to investigate the charges. It conducted more than 30 interviews behind closed doors and took action against eight students, a recent graduate, and an assistant professor. They were expelled or had their association with the university severed. Lowell proved particularly opposed to readmission for those who had been expelled only for associating too closely with those more directly involved. He eventually relented in two of four cases. The affair went unreported until 2002, when Harvard President Lawrence Summers called the affair &quot;part of a past that we have rightly left behind.&quot;

===Excluding African-Americans from the Freshman Halls===
African-American students had lived in Harvard&#x27;s dormitories for decades, until Lowell changed the policy. Freshmen were required to live in the Freshman Halls beginning in 1915. Two black students did live there during World War I without incident. When a few were excluded after the war they raised no protest.

The matter became the object of student protest in 1922, when six banned black freshmen, led by a recent alumnus who was studying at the Business School, protested their exclusion. Lowell wrote this explanation to Roscoe Conkling Bruce, himself an African American Harvard alumnus and the father of an incoming freshman: &quot;We have not thought it possible to compel men of different races to reside together.&quot; Bruce&#x27;s lengthy reply underscored the irony of Lowell&#x27;s position: &quot;The policy of compulsory residence in the Freshman Halls is costly indeed if it is the thing that constrains Harvard to enter open-eyed and brusque upon a policy of racial discrimination.&quot; Lowell stood his ground: &quot;It is not a departure from the past to refuse to compel white and colored men to room in the same building. We owe to the colored man the same opportunities for education that we do to the white man; but we do not owe it to him to force him and the white into social relations that are not, or may not be, mutually congenial.&quot; He accused Bruce of insisting on a change of policy and employed an argument about minority presence provoking prejudice that he also used about the same time in the Jewish quota dispute. &quot;For the colored man to claim that he is entitled to have the white man compelled to live with him is a very unfortunate innovation which, far from doing him good, would increase a prejudice which, as you and I will thoroughly agree, is most unfortunate and probably growing.&quot;

When their direct appeal to Lowell failed, the students organized public support from alumni and the press. Of those who wrote to Lowell, blacks saw his position as unqualified racism. Whites either saw it as a violation of Harvard&#x27;s traditions or applauded it in frankly racist terms. Most criticism saw Lowell&#x27;s stance as a submission to Southern prejudice. One called it &quot;the slaveholder&#x27;s prejudice&quot; and another called Lowell&#x27;s policy a &quot;surrender to the Bourbon South.&quot; One Wisconsin minister suggested Lowell allow the black students to live &quot;voluntarily&quot; in a segregated section of the Freshman Halls. Lowell replied that such a plan &quot;seems to me to be something like the Jim Crow car, an enforced seclusion which is, to me, very repulsive.&quot; A faculty committee called Lowell&#x27;s exclusion policy &quot;a dangerous surrender of traditional ideals,&quot; and in March 1923 the Harvard Board of Overseers unanimously overruled Lowell. One of them, Franklin D. Roosevelt, wrote: &quot;It seems to be a pity that the matter ever came up in this way. There were certainly many colored students in Cambridge when we were there and no question ever arose.&quot;

Despite an official policy of integration, what freshmen experienced thereafter is not entirely clear. Some black freshmen lived in the dormitories but believed that not all the Freshman Halls were open to them. One was granted permission to live outside the Freshman Halls even though he had not requested such a privilege. Harvard Dean Henry Aaron Yeomans, later Lowell&#x27;s biographer, frankly admitted that he and Lowell as administrators found a way to accommodate themselves to the Overseers&#x27; stated principle: &quot;The matter was settled in theory, and in practice no serious difficulties were encountered. The applicant who had raised the question decided to live elsewhere. A few others who applied at long intervals, were so skillfully located in the Halls that no susceptible feelings were hurt.&quot;

===Admissions and Jewish quota controversy===
Following Lowell&#x27;s earlier reform of Harvard&#x27;s admissions process to increase the admission of public school students, the Jewish proportion of the student body rose from 6% in 1908 to 22% in 1922, at a time when Jews constituted about 3% of the U.S. population. Lowell, continuing to focus on the cohesiveness of the student body, described a campus where antisemitism was growing and Jewish students were ever more likely to be isolated from the majority. He feared—and recent developments at Columbia University supported him—that the social elite would cease sending its sons to Harvard as Jewish enrollment increased. He cited what he saw as the parallel experience of hotels and clubs that lost their old membership when the proportion of Jewish members increased. He proposed limiting Jewish admissions to 15% of the entering class. His attempts to persuade members of the Harvard Board of Overseers to adopt his views were already failing when the plan was leaked to the &quot;Boston Post&quot; in May 1922. The idea was immediately denounced by Irish and black groups and by the American Federation of Labor.

Lowell continued to argue both in private correspondence and in public speeches that his rationale was the welfare of the Jewish students. &quot;It is the duty of Harvard,&quot; he said, &quot;to receive just as many boys who have come, or whose parents have come, to his country without our background as it can effectively educate.&quot; If higher Jewish enrollment provoked greater prejudice against them, he asked, &quot;How can we cause the Jews to feel and be regarded as an integral part of the student body?&quot; He also suggested that Harvard would not be facing this issue if other universities and colleges would admit Jews in similar numbers: &quot;If every college in the country would take a limited proportion of Jews, I suspect we should go a long way toward eliminating race feeling among the students.&quot;

The question was turned over to a faculty committee: the Committee on Methods of Sifting Candidates for Admission. In the course of the internal campaign to influence that group&#x27;s work, Lowell sought to exploit divisions within the Jewish community. Despite the basic divide between the older Jewish immigrants, usually of German origin, and the lower class of more recently arrived Eastern European Jews, Lowell found no ally there who would articulate his view of &quot;desirable&quot; and &quot;undesirable&quot; Jews. The faculty committee eventually rejected Lowell&#x27;s proposed quota. Instead, Harvard&#x27;s new guiding principle in admissions would be the top seventh rule. Harvard would reach out to youths in smaller cities and towns, even to rural communities, with the guideline that the student place in the top seventh of his class. It would seek &quot;to pick out the best pupils from good schools, here, there, and everywhere.&quot; Though some suspected this was nothing but a covert way to decrease Jewish enrollment, the policy had the opposite effect. The numbers of non-Jewish students attracted from the South and West could not match the larger numbers of Jews admitted from the Middle Atlantic and New England states. By 1925, Jews made up 28% of the entering class.

Lowell then found another way to accomplish his goal, this time less publicly. He first won approval from the Harvard Board of Overseers for a new policy that would, in addition to traditional academic criteria, use letters from teachers and interviews to assess an applicant&#x27;s &quot;aptitude and character,&quot; thus introducing discretion in the place of the strict top seventh rule. He even persuaded one doubtful Overseer that this would not support discrimination against Jews as a group, but merely &quot;careful discernment of differences among individuals.&quot; When Lowell gained final approval of these modifications in 1926 and appointed a compliant Admissions Committee, he had won his way. When Lowell left his position in 1933, Jews made up 10% of the undergraduate population.

== Public stances ==

===Opposition to Brandeis nomination===
In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson nominated Louis Brandeis, a private attorney renowned as a liberal opponent of monopolies and proponent of social reform legislation, to serve as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. As public opinion on the nomination divided along ideological lines, Lowell joined the Republican establishment, particularly that of his Boston Brahmin class, in opposition. He joined 54 others in signing a letter claiming that Brandeis lacked the requisite &quot;legal temperament and capacity.&quot; An editorial in the &quot;Harvard Alumni Bulletin&quot; criticized him for needlessly involving the university in a political dispute. Some students organized their own petition in favor of the nomination. Though some opposition to Brandeis was rooted in antisemitism, Brandeis himself viewed Lowell&#x27;s opposition as driven by social class prejudice. Writing in private in 1916, Brandeis described men like Lowell &quot;who have been blinded by privilege, who have no evil purpose, and many of whom have a distinct public spirit, but whose environment—or innate narrowness—have obscured all vision and sympathy with the masses.&quot;

===Internationalism and the League of Nations===
Following the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Lowell helped found a civic organization to promote international cooperation to prevent future wars. It was meant to be non-partisan but was inevitably drawn into partisan politics as the subject of American participation in the League of Nations dominated post-war politics. Lowell described himself as &quot;an inconsistent Republican&quot; or &quot;an independent of Republican antecedents.&quot; By the time the debate ended, many questioned that independence.

At a convention at Philadelphia&#x27;s Independence Hall on June 17, 1915, with former President William Howard Taft presiding, one hundred noteworthy Americans announced the formation of the League to Enforce Peace. They proposed an international agreement in which participating nations would agree to &quot;jointly use their economic and military force against any one of their number that goes to war or commits acts of hostility against another.&quot; The founders included Alexander Graham Bell, Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, James Cardinal Gibbons of Baltimore, and Edward Filene on behalf of the recently founded U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Lowell was elected to the Executive Committee.

The initial efforts of the League to Enforce Peace aimed at creating public awareness through magazine articles and speeches. Then-President Wilson&#x27;s specific proposal for the League of Nations met resistance from the Republican-controlled Senate and the opposition led by Senator Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts. Lowell watched the high-minded debate deteriorate until the ideal of international cooperation was &quot;sacrificed to party intrigue, personal antipathy, and pride of authorship.&quot; Lowell and the League to Enforce Peace tried to hold the middle ground. He cared little about Wilson&#x27;s specific plan or the details of the reservations or amendments Lodge wanted to attach for the Senate to give its assent. Lowell believed American participation was the greater goal, the exact nature of the organization secondary.

One of the most widely publicized confrontations saw Lowell debate Lodge, the League&#x27;s most prominent opponent, in Boston&#x27;s Symphony Hall on March 19, 1919, with Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge presiding. That debate proved gentlemanly, since Lowell believed that the resolution of the policy dispute required Wilson and Lodge to compromise. Lowell had sharper exchanges with the die-hard Republican isolationist Senator William Borah of Idaho. Lowell repeatedly argued that George Washington&#x27;s Farewell Address and its stricture against entangling alliances held no relevance for the present. Senator Borah saw a lack of patriotism: &quot;There are a vast number of people supporting the league of nations who never let an opportunity go by of belittling ... everything that is truly American: and Dr. Lowell is one of them.&quot; The Harvard president replied in kind:

I yield neither to Senator Borah nor to any other man in admiration of the Farewell Address and of the great Fathers of the Republic; but I would not use them as a cover for party politics. Never did I sneer at the Farewell Address; but I believe that the greatness of Washington was due to his looking the facts of his day in the face, and determining his conduct thereby, instead of by utterances, however wise of a hundred and fifty years before. I will trust the American people not to mistake short-sightedness for patriotism or narrow-mindedness for love of country.

In the summer of 1919, the League to Enforce Peace published a book of essays modeled on the Federalist Papers called &quot;The Covenanter: An American Exposition of the Covenant of the League of Nations&quot;. Lowell authored 13 of its 27 essays. The &quot;New York Times&quot; called it a &quot;masterly analysis&quot; and thought it perfectly suited for a broad public: &quot;This—thank Heaven—is a brochure for the lazy-minded!&quot;

As the election of 1920 approached, the Republican nominee, Warren Harding, campaigned on the domestic issues that united his party and sent confusing signals about his support for a League of Nations. With the election just weeks away, whole groups of League proponents chose different sides. One entire organization of independent voters chose James Cox, the Democratic candidate, who favored the League but showed no more flexibility than President Wilson. Lowell and many other prominent League supporters backed Harding, publishing a statement that became known as the &quot;Letter of the 31 Republicans&quot; on October 14, 1920. Lowell could not express his reasoning publicly. In his view, the League&#x27;s proponents, and especially the League&#x27;s Republican proponents, needed to control public perception of Harding&#x27;s victory, which everyone knew was certain. They could not allow the election to appear as a victory of anti-League Republicans over pro-League Democrats. If the League lost a referendum in that way, there would be no hope for its revival under the new administration.

The claim in the &quot;Statement of 31 Republicans&quot; that a Harding victory meant brighter prospects for the League of Nations was badly received by some League proponents. Lowell came in for attack precisely because of his earlier claims to independence. One Harvard graduate, who had just formed the New Hampshire committee to raise funds for the University&#x27;s endowment, wrote: &quot;One can understand a Republican partisan and respect him. One can understand a Democratic partisan and respect him. But how can any man explain this recent act of yours consistently with the dignity, gravity, high character and devotion to truth which should attach to the President of Harvard College?&quot; Charged with sacrificing his principles to expediency, Lowell admitted he had but provided his own definition of expediency: &quot;striving to find the most effective way of achieving a principle—refusing to beat one&#x27;s head uselessly against a wall to attack an entrenchment in face instead if taking it by a turning movement.&quot;

Harding as president disappointed proponents of the League, but Lowell never regretted his decision to endorse him. He did view the work of the League to Enforce Peace more critically. Its oratory had failed to engage the public at large, he thought, so public opinion remained &quot;indifferent&quot; to its call for muscular internationalism, leaving isolation or at least inaction to win the day.

===Advisory Committee on Sacco and Vanzetti trial===
In 1927, Massachusetts Governor Alvan T. Fuller was facing last minute appeals to grant clemency to Sacco and Vanzetti, whose case had attracted attention worldwide. He appointed Lowell to an Advisory Committee along with President Samuel Wesley Stratton of MIT and Probate Judge Robert Grant. They were tasked with reviewing the trial of Sacco and Vanzetti to determine whether the trial had been fair. Lowell&#x27;s appointment was generally well received, for though he had controversy in his past he had also at times demonstrated an independent streak. The defense attorneys considered resigning when they determined that the Committee was biased against the defendants, but some of the defendants&#x27; most prominent supporters, including Harvard Law Professor Felix Frankfurter and Judge Julian W. Mack of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, persuaded them to stay because Lowell &quot;was not entirely hopeless.&quot;

After two weeks of hearing witnesses and reviewing evidence, the trio produced a report largely authored by Lowell that criticized the judge in the case but deemed the trial fair. A defense attorney later noted ruefully that the release of the Committee&#x27;s report &quot;abruptly stilled the burgeoning doubts among the leaders of opinion in New England.&quot; Supporters of the convicted men denounced the Committee. Harold Laski said the decision represented Lowell&#x27;s &quot;loyalty to his class.&quot; The affair dogged Lowell for the rest of his life. In 1936, on the day when Harvard&#x27;s 300th anniversary was celebrated, 28 Harvard alumni attacked Lowell for his role in the case, including editor Malcolm Cowley, scholar Newton Arvin, and author John Dos Passos.

== Later years and death ==

Lowell&#x27;s health declined slowly and his lifelong hearing problems worsened. He resigned his position as Harvard&#x27;s president on November 21, 1932, and served through the following summer. During his years as president, enrollment at the College expanded from 3,000 to 8,000 and its endowment grew from $23 to $123 million. Lowell&#x27;s construction projects, some based on the Freshman Halls and the College system, but including Widener Library, the Memorial Church and many others, had transformed the university&#x27;s infrastructure. Also among the new campus buildings of Lowell&#x27;s tenure was the President&#x27;s House (later called Loeb House) at 17 Quincy Street, which Lowell commissioned from his cousin Guy Lowell. It remained the residence of succeeding Harvard Presidents until 1971.

Lowell is remembered as well for a donation of one million dollars to help found the Harvard Society of Fellows. Years before, he had given $10,500 to purchase a 13-inch telescope for his deceased brother Percival&#x27;s Lowell Observatory, which in 1930 gained fame as the Pluto Discovery Telescope.

Lowell&#x27;s wife of 51 years, Anna Parker Lowell, died in the spring of 1930.

In retirement from Harvard, he lived on Marlborough Street in Boston&#x27;s Back Bay and in Cotuit on Cape Cod. He owned Conaumet Neck along the shores of Mashpee Pond. In his will, he bequeathed land along the pond to The Trustees of Reservations, which maintains it as the Lowell Holly Reservation.

He headed the Boston Municipal Research Bureau and chaired a Committee on the Reform of Judicial Procedure under the auspices of the Boston Chamber of Commerce. He also became head of the Motion Picture Research Council, a group established to promote studies of the social values of motion pictures. He published frequently in such periodicals as &quot;The Atlantic&quot; and &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;.

Lowell was an honorary member of the Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati and was invested with the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor of France.

He died at home on Marlborough Street on January 6, 1943. Funeral services were held at Harvard&#x27;s Memorial Church.

<doc id="509548" wikidata="Q4816203" url="?curid=509548" title="Atlanta murders of 1979–1981">
<text>The Atlanta murders of 1979–1981, sometimes called the Atlanta child murders, are a series of murders committed in Atlanta, Georgia, between July 1979 and May 1981. Over the two-year period, at least 28 children, adolescents, and adults were killed. Wayne Williams, an Atlanta native who was 23 years old at the time of the last murder, was arrested, tried, and convicted of two of the adult murders and sentenced to two consecutive life terms.

Police subsequently have attributed a number of the child murders to Williams, although he has not been charged in any of those cases, and Williams himself maintains his innocence, notwithstanding the fact that the specific style and manner of the killings, which was by chokehold-strangulation, ceased after his arrest.

In March 2019, the Atlanta police, under the order of Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, reopened the cases in hopes that new technology will lead to a conviction for the murders that were never resolved. , no results have been made public.

==Timeline of murders==
===1979===
* In the middle of 1979, Edward Hope Smith (also known as &quot;Teddy&quot;), 14, and Alfred Evans (also known as &quot;Q&quot;), 13, disappeared four days apart. Their bodies were found on July 28 in a wooded area, Smith with a .22 caliber gunshot wound in his upper back. They were believed to be the first victims of the putative &quot;Atlanta Child Killer.&quot;
* On September 4, the next victim, 14-year-old Milton Harvey, disappeared while on an errand to the bank for his mother. He was riding a bike which was found a week later in a remote area of Atlanta. His body was not recovered until November of that year.
* On October 21, 9-year-old Yusuf Bell went to a store to buy Bruton snuff for a neighbor, Eula Birdsong, at Reese Grocery on McDaniel Street. A witness said she saw Yusuf near the intersection of McDaniel and Fulton getting into a blue car before he disappeared. His body was found on November 8 in the abandoned E. P. Johnson Elementary School by a school janitor who was looking for a place to urinate. Bell&#x27;s body was found clothed in the brown cut-off shorts he was last seen wearing, though they had a piece of masking tape stuck to them. He had been hit over the head twice, and the cause of death was strangulation. Police did not immediately link his disappearance to the previous killings.

===1980===
* On March 4, 1980, the first female victim, 12-year-old Angel Lenair, disappeared. She left her house around 4:00p.m. wearing a denim outfit, and was last seen at a friend&#x27;s house watching the television program &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;. Lenair&#x27;s body was found six days later, in a wooded vacant lot along Campbellton Road, wearing the same clothes in which she had left home. A pair of white underwear that did not belong to Lenair were stuffed in her mouth, and her hands were bound with an electrical cord. The cause of death was strangulation.
* On March 11, one week after Lenair&#x27;s disappearance, 11-year-old Jeffery Mathis disappeared while on an errand for his mother. He was wearing gray jogging pants, brown shoes, and a white and green shirt. Months later a girl said she saw him get into a blue car with a light-skinned man and a dark-skinned man. The body of Jeffrey Mathis was found in a &quot;briar-covered patch of woodlands,&quot; 11 months after he disappeared, by which time it was not possible to identify a cause of death.
* On May 18, 15-year-old Eric Middlebrooks disappeared. He was last seen answering the telephone at home and then leaving in a hurry on his bicycle, taking with him a hammer to repair the bicycle. His body was found the following day next to his bicycle in the rear garage of an Atlanta bar. The bar was located next door to what was then the Georgia Department of Offender Rehabilitation. His pockets were turned inside out, his chest and arms had slight stab wounds, and the cause of death was determined to be blunt force trauma to the head. A few weeks before he disappeared, Middlebrooks had testified against three juveniles in a robbery case.
* On June 9, 12-year-old Christopher Richardson went missing on his way to a local pool. He was last seen walking towards the DeKalb County&#x27;s Midway Recreation Center in Midway Park. He was wearing blue shorts, a light blue shirt and blue tennis shoes. His body was not found until the following January, clothed in unfamiliar swim trunks, along with the body of a later victim, Earl Terrell. The cause of Richardson&#x27;s death was not determined.
* On June 22, 7-year-old LaTonya Wilson disappeared from her parents&#x27; apartment. According to a witness, she appeared to have been abducted by two men, one of whom was seen climbing into the apartment window and then holding Wilson in his arms as he spoke to the other man in the parking lot. On October 18, Wilson&#x27;s body was found in a fenced-in area at the end of Verbena Street in Atlanta. By then, the body had skeletonized, and no cause of death could be established.
* The next day, June 23, 10-year-old Aaron Wyche disappeared after having been seen near a local grocery store, getting into a blue Chevrolet with either one or two black men. A female witness says she saw Wyche being led from Tanner&#x27;s Corner Grocery by a 6-foot-tall 180-pound black male, approximately 30 years old, with a mustache and goatee. The witness&#x27;s description of the car matched a description of a similar car implicated in the earlier Jeffrey Mathis disappearance. At 6:00p.m. Wyche was seen at a shopping center. The following day, Wyche&#x27;s body was found under a bridge; the official cause of death was asphyxiation from a broken neck suffered in a fall.
* In July 1980, two more children, 9-year-old Anthony Carter and 10-year-old Earl Terrell, were murdered.
* Clifford Jones, aged 13, disappeared on August 20. He was found dead from strangulation. His body was found on August 21 behind a dumpster in the rear of the former Hollywood Plaza shopping center.
* Darron Glass, aged 10, was reported missing on September 14. His body has not been recovered. 
* Charles Stephens, aged 12, was reported missing on October 9. His body was found the next day on Norman Berry Drive near the entrance to a trailer park. Stephens&#x27;s body was missing his t-shirt and one of his shoes, but he was still wearing his dark blue pants. Police determined that his cause of death was asphyxiation. Rub marks were also identified on his nose and mouth. Dog hairs and two Caucasian head hairs were found on the body along with two pubic hairs, which did not belong to Stephens or Williams and which were found on his boxers 950 feet away. The state considered this a &#x27;pattern case&#x27; in Williams&#x27;s trial.
* Aaron Jackson, aged 9, went missing on November 1. His body was discovered the next day strangled, lying face-up on a river bank.
* Patrick Rogers, aged 16, knew several of the previous victims. He went missing on November 30. His body was found on December 7 in the Chattahoochee river. Police speculated that he was dropped from the bridge above.

===1981===
* The murders continued into 1981. The first known victim in the new year was 14-year-old Lubie Geter, who disappeared on January 3. Geter&#x27;s body was found on February 5.
* Geter&#x27;s friend, 15-year-old Terry Pue went missing in January. An anonymous caller told the police where to find Pue&#x27;s body. Terry lived in the same apartment as Edward &quot;Teddy&quot; Smith, who was killed in 1979. 
* In February and March 1981, six more bodies were discovered, believed to be linked to the previous homicides. Among the deceased was the body of 21-year-old Eddie Duncan, the first adult victim.
* In April, 20-year-old Larry Rogers, 28-year-old John Porter, and 21-year-old Jimmy Ray Payne were murdered. Porter and Payne were ex-convicts and had just recently been released from Arrendale State Prison after serving time for burglary.
* On May 12, 1981, FBI agents found the body of 17-year-old William &quot;Billy Star&quot; Barrett on a curb in a wooded area near his home. A witness, 32-year-old Harold Wood, a custodian from Southwest High School, had run out of gas about a mile from the scene. Wood described a black man standing over and observing the location where the body was found before driving away in a white-over-blue Cadillac.
* During the end of May 1981, the last reported victim was added to the list: 27-year-old Nathaniel Cater. He was last seen by gardener Robert I. Henry at the entrance of the Rialto Theatre in Atlanta, reportedly holding hands with Wayne Williams. His body was discovered two days later.
Investigator Chet Dettlinger created a map of the victims&#x27; locations. Despite the difference in ages, the victims fell within the same geographic parameters. They were connected to Memorial Drive and 11 major streets in the area. Author Ginger Strand links the murders to freeway racism and Atlanta&#x27;s massive urban renewal program that disrupted African American neighborhoods.

==Capturing the suspect==
There were significant delays in beginning an investigation. During the murders, more than 100 agents were working on the investigation. The city of Atlanta imposed curfews, and parents in the city removed their children from school and forbade them from playing outside.

As the media coverage of the killings intensified, the FBI predicted that the killer might dump the next victim into a body of water to conceal any evidence. Police staked out nearly a dozen area bridges, including crossings of the Chattahoochee River. During a stakeout on May 22, 1981, detectives got their first major break when an officer heard a splash beneath a bridge. Another officer saw a white 1970 Chevrolet station wagon turn around and drive back across the bridge.Two police cars later stopped the suspect station wagon about a half-mile from the bridge. The driver was 23-year-old Wayne Bertram Williams, a supposed music promoter and freelance photographer. The Chevrolet wagon belonged to his parents. During questioning, Williams said he was on his way to audition a woman, Cheryl Johnson, as a singer. Williams claimed she lived in the nearby town of Smyrna. Police did not find any record of her or the appointment.

Two days later, on May 24, the nude body of Nathaniel Cater, 27, was found floating downriver a few miles from the bridge where police had seen the suspicious station wagon. Based on this evidence, including the police officer&#x27;s hearing of the splash, police believed that Williams had killed Cater and disposed of his body while the police were nearby.

Investigators who stopped Williams on the bridge noticed gloves and a 24-inch nylon cord sitting in the passenger seat. According to investigators, the cord looked similar to ligature marks found on Cater and other victims, but the cord was never taken into evidence for analysis. Adding to a growing list of suspicious circumstances, Williams had handed out flyers in predominantly black neighborhoods calling for young people ages 11–21 to audition for his new singing group that he called Gemini. Williams failed an FBI-administered polygraph examination, though polygraph results are not admissible as evidence in criminal courts.

Fibers from a carpet in the Williams residence were found to match those observed on two of the victims. Additional fibers from the Williams&#x27;s home, vehicles, and pet dog were later matched to fibers discovered on other victims. Furthermore, witness Robert Henry claimed to have seen Williams holding hands and walking with Nathaniel Cater on the night Cater is believed to have died.

On June 21, 1981, Williams was arrested. A grand jury indicted him for first-degree murder in the deaths of Nathaniel Cater and Jimmy Ray Payne, aged 22. The trial date was set for early 1982.

When the news of Williams&#x27;s arrest was officially released (his status as a suspect had previously been leaked to the media), FBI Agent John E. Douglas stated that, if it was Williams, then he was &quot;looking pretty good for a good percentage of the killings.&quot; Douglas had previously conducted an interview with &quot;People&quot; magazine about profiling the killer as a young black man. This was widely reported as the FBI effectively declaring Williams guilty, and Douglas was officially censured by the Director of the FBI.

==Trial==
Jury selection began on December 28, 1981, and it lasted six days. Nine women and three men comprised the jury, among which were eight African Americans and four Caucasians.

The trial officially began on January 6, 1982, with Judge Clarence Cooper presiding. The most important evidence against Williams was the fiber analysis between the victims he was indicted for murdering, Jimmy Ray Payne and Nathaniel Cater, and the 12 pattern-murder cases in which circumstantial evidence culminated in numerous links between the crimes. This evidence included witnesses who testified that they had seen Williams with the victims, and some witnesses suggested that he had solicited sexual favors.

The prosecution&#x27;s presentation of the case has been criticized, to the extent that in some jurisdictions it might have resulted in a mistrial. In particular, two separate FBI special agents testified that the chances of the victims not having come into contact with Williams was &quot;virtually impossible,&quot; based solely on the comparative rarity of the fibers which were found on the victims which seemed to match the fibers which were found in the suspect&#x27;s car and home. After reviewing the case, Georgia Supreme Court Justice George T. Smith deemed the evidence, or the lack thereof, inadmissible.

On February 27, 1982, after 11 hours of deliberation, the jury found Wayne Bertram Williams guilty of the two murders. He was sentenced to two consecutive life terms in Georgia&#x27;s Hancock State Prison in Sparta.

==Later developments==
In a September 1986 issue of American music magazine &quot;Spin&quot;, journalists Robert Keating and Barry Michael Cooper (the latter of whom would later find fame as a screenwriter) reported that the Georgia Bureau of Investigation – who had been conducting a secret investigation into potential involvement of the Ku Klux Klan in the crimes, in tandem to that of the Special Task Force on Missing and Murdered Children – discovered members of the group may have been involved in the murder of victim Lubie Geter, and may have been linked to the murders of fourteen others. Allegedly, a family of Klansmembers living outside of Atlanta had hoped to ignite a race war in Atlanta, and attempted to recruit others for this purpose. Charles T. Sanders, a narcotics dealer and recruiter for the group, was said to have told a criminal informant he intended to kill Geter several weeks before his body was found. After Geter had backed a go-cart into his car, Sanders allegedly told the informant &quot;I&#x27;m gonna kill that black bastard. I&#x27;m gonna strangle him with my dick.&quot; Shortly thereafter, Sanders&#x27; brother Don was recorded telling another Klan member he was going out to look for &quot;another little boy.&quot; Additionally, Charles Sanders was said to have a scar matching a description given by an eyewitness who reported seeing Geter enter the car of a White man with a &quot;jagged scar on his neck,&quot; and a dog with similar hair to that found on Geter&#x27;s and other victims&#x27; bodies. The article reported that, in 1981, members of the GBI and officials in other law enforcement agencies opted to close their investigation and seal their findings. However, a handwritten transcript of a conversation between Klansmembers regarding Geter&#x27;s murder was sent anonymously to Lynn Whatley in 1985, an attorney who was then representing Wayne Williams.

At a 1991 hearing on Williams&#x27; request for a new trial, wherein he was represented by attorneys Alan Dershowitz, William Kunstler, and Bobby Lee Cook, investigators from both Atlanta and Georgia law-enforcement agencies testified they had little or no knowledge of the GBI&#x27;s investigation. At the same hearing, an informant for the GBI reported that in 1981, Charles Sanders had admitted to killing Geter while Whitaker was wearing a concealed microphone.

In May 2004, about six months after becoming the DeKalb County Police Chief in November 2003, Louis Graham reopened the investigations into the deaths of the five DeKalb County victims: 10-year-old Aaron Wyche, 13-year-old Curtis Walker, 9-year-old Yusuf Bell, 17-year-old William Barrett, and 11-year-old Patrick Baltazar. Graham, one of the original investigators in these cases, said he doubted that Wayne Williams, the man convicted of two of the killings and blamed for 22 others, was guilty of all of them. On June 21, 2006, the DeKalb County Police dropped its reinvestigation of the Atlanta child murders. After resigning, Graham was replaced by the acting chief, Nick Marinelli, who said, &quot;We dredged up what we had, and nothing has panned out, so until something does or additional evidence comes our way, or there&#x27;s forensic feedback from existing evidence, we will continue to pursue the [other] cold cases that are [with]in our reach.&quot;

Criminal profiler John E. Douglas said that, while he believes that Williams committed many of the murders, he does not think that he committed them all. Douglas added that he believes that law enforcement authorities have some idea of who the other killers are, cryptically adding, &quot;It isn&#x27;t a single offender, and the truth isn&#x27;t pleasant.&quot;

On January 29, 2007, attorneys for the State of Georgia agreed to allow DNA testing of the dog hair that was used to help convict Williams. This decision was a response to a legal filing as a part of Williams&#x27; efforts to appeal his conviction and life sentences. Williams&#x27; lawyer, Jack Martin, asked a Fulton County Superior Court judge to allow DNA tests on canine and human hair and blood, stating the results might help Williams win a new trial. On June 26, 2007, the DNA test results showed that the hairs on the bodies contained the same mitochondrial DNA sequence as Williams&#x27; dog — a sequence that occurs in only about 1 out of 100 dogs. Dr. Elizabeth Wictum, director of the UC Davis laboratory that carried out the testing, told &quot;The Associated Press&quot; that while the results were &quot;fairly significant,&quot; they &quot;don&#x27;t conclusively point to Williams&#x27; dog as the source of the hair&quot; because the lab was able to test only for mitochondrial DNA, which, unlike nuclear DNA, cannot be shown to be unique to one dog.

Later in 2007, the FBI performed DNA tests on two human hairs found on one of the victims. The mitochondrial DNA sequence in the hairs would eliminate 99.5% of persons by not matching their DNA. The mitochondrial DNA sequence in the hairs would eliminate 98% of African American persons by not matching their DNA. However, they matched Williams&#x27; DNA and so did not eliminate the possibility that the hairs were his.

On March 21, 2019, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields announced that officials would re-test evidence from the murders, which will be gathered by the Atlanta Police Department, Fulton County District Attorney&#x27;s Office, and Georgia Bureau of Investigation. In a news conference, Mayor Bottoms said, &quot;It may be there is nothing left to be tested. But I do think history will judge us by our actions and we will be able to say we tried.&quot;

In July 2021, Bottoms announced that DNA had been identified and sampled in two cases that will be subjected to additional analysis by a private lab. Additionally, investigators combed through 40% of the original DNA evidence and had sent that to the same private lab for testing on June 21, 2021. As of December 2022, no results have been made public, despite requests from the victims&#x27; families.

As of 2019, Wayne Williams continued to maintain his innocence.

==Known victims==
==Media coverage and adaptations==
The first national media coverage of the case was in 1980, when a team from ABC News &quot;20/20&quot;, Stanhope Gould and Bill Lichtenstein, producer Steve Tello, and correspondent Bob Sirkin from the ABC Atlanta bureau looked into the case. They were assigned to the story after ABC News president Roone Arledge read a tiny story in the newspaper that said police had ruled out any connection between a daycare explosion, which turned out to be a faulty furnace, and the cases of lost and missing children, which had been previously unreported in the national media. In a week, the team reported on the dead and missing children, and they broke the story that the Atlanta Police Task Force was not writing down or following up on every lead they received through the police hotline that had been set up.

In 1981, British novelist Martin Amis published &quot;The Killings in Atlanta&quot; for &quot;The Observer&quot;, later compiled into &quot;The Moronic Inferno: And Other Visits to America&quot; (1986).

In 1982, writer Martin Pasko dedicated an issue of the comic book &quot;Saga of the Swamp Thing&quot; to &quot;the good people of Atlanta, that they may put the horror behind them...but not forget.&quot; The story revolved around a serial killer who targeted minority children in the fictional town of Pineboro, Arkansas, who is revealed to be a demon who had possessed TV host &quot;Uncle Barney&quot; (a thinly veiled parody of Fred Rogers). While the demon is ultimately vanquished, the story ends on an ominous note criticizing the social inequalities that made the non-white children such attractive targets, as well as children&#x27;s television shows that encourage blind trust of strangers.

In 1985, the television miniseries &quot;The Atlanta Child Murders&quot; was released. The film was centered around the murders and the arrest of the suspect. The film revolved mainly around the aftermath of the killings and the trials. The film starred Calvin Levels, Morgan Freeman, James Earl Jones, Rip Torn, Jason Robards, Martin Sheen, and Bill Paxton. Atlanta officials criticized the film, claiming that it distorted the facts of the case. After a series of negotiations, CBS executives agreed to insert a disclaimer alerting viewers that the film is based on fact but contains fictional elements.

Also in 1985, James Baldwin published &quot;The Evidence of Things Not Seen&quot;, a non-fiction examination not only of the case and Williams&#x27; trial, but also of race relations in Atlanta and, by extension, America. The book grew out of an assignment to write about the murders for &quot;Playboy&quot;, commissioned by then-editor Walter Lowe.

In 2000, Showtime released a drama film titled &quot;Who Killed Atlanta&#x27;s Children?&quot; starring James Belushi and Gregory Hines.

In 2002, Tayari Jones published the novel &quot;Leaving Atlanta&quot;. The book focuses on the lives and experiences of three fictional fifth graders at Oglethorpe Elementary School, Tasha Baxter, Rodney Green, and Octavia Fuller, during the murder spree. During the time of the murders, Jones attended Oglethorpe Elementary School and was classmates with two of the real-life victims, Yusuf Bell and Terry Pue.

On June 10, 2010, CNN broadcast a documentary, &quot;The Atlanta Child Murders&quot;, with interviews by Soledad O&#x27;Brien with some of the people involved, including Wayne Williams. The two-hour documentary invited viewers to weigh the evidence presented and then go to CNN.com to cast votes on whether Williams was guilty, whether he was innocent, or if the case was &quot;not proven.&quot; 68.6% of respondents said Williams was guilty, 4.3% said he was innocent, and 27.1% chose &quot;not proven.&quot;

In the 2016 song &quot;the ends&quot; by American rapper Travis Scott featuring American rapper André 3000, on the former&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight&quot;, Atlanta-native André 3000 raps about the killings.

In January 2018, documentary filmmaker Payne Lindsey began releasing a podcast called &quot;Atlanta Monster&quot;, covering the murders with interviews from family members of victims, law enforcement officials, individuals alive in the Atlanta area at the time of the murders, and Wayne Williams.

The second season of &quot;Mindhunter&quot; (released in August 2019) covers the murders. The series, which is focused on the history of the FBI&#x27;s Behavioral Science Unit (BSU) builds that dramatic arc of the series over the FBI&#x27;s two BSU agents who join the Atlanta investigation. In the series fictional treatment, Agent Ford has the role of insisting that the 13 murders (at the time of the series arc) they are investigating are the work of one single serial killer, and that to gain the victims&#x27; trust, he may be African-American himself. This line of deduction clashes with that of his colleague Agent Tench, the Atlanta Police Department, and the African-American community of Atlanta – many of whom believe, in light of Georgia&#x27;s history of hate crimes and racial violence, that the killings are the work of the Ku Klux Klan.

&quot;The Atlanta Child Murders&quot;, a three-part documentary series produced by Will Packer Productions, aired on Investigation Discovery in March 2019.

In April 2020, HBO released a 5-part documentary titled &quot;Atlanta&#x27;s Missing and Murdered: The Lost Children,&quot; directed by Sam Pollard and Maro Chermayeff.
HBO&#x27;s documentary revealed information that focused heavily on the appellate process of the case against Wayne Williams. Williams&#x27; attorneys filed a habeas corpus document and it was denied. Similarly, his request for a retrial was denied in 2004.

<doc id="509563" wikidata="Q1389574" url="?curid=509563" title="Harry J. Anslinger">
<text>Harry Jacob Anslinger (May 20, 1892 – November 14, 1975) was an American government official who served as the first commissioner of the U.S. Treasury Department&#x27;s Federal Bureau of Narcotics during the presidencies of Herbert Hoover, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and John F. Kennedy. He was a supporter of Prohibition, and of the criminalization of all drugs except for alcohol, - because supporting the prohibition against alcohol means he didn’t support the criminalization of alcohol - and spearheaded anti-drug policy campaigns.

Anslinger has been characterized as an early proponent of the war on drugs, as he zealously advocated for and pursued harsh drug penalties, in particular regarding cannabis. As a propagandist for the war on drugs, he focused on demonizing racial and immigrant groups.

Anslinger held office as commissioner for an unprecedented 32 years, until 1962. He then held office for two years as U.S. Representative to the United Nations Narcotics Commission. The responsibilities once held by Anslinger are now largely under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Office of National Drug Control Policy and the agency he ran was a predecessor of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).

==Early life==
Anslinger was born in Altoona, Pennsylvania, in 1892. His father, of Swiss German origin, was Robert J. Anslinger, a barber by trade, who was born in Bern, Switzerland. His mother, Rosa Christiana Fladt, was born in the Grand Duchy of Baden (today a part of Germany). The family emigrated to the United States in 1881. Robert Anslinger worked in New York for two years, then moved to Altoona, a town founded by the Pennsylvania Railroad. In 1892, the year Harry was born, Robert Anslinger went to work for the Pennsylvania Railroad, seeking more stable employment.

Harry Anslinger followed his father in going to work for the Pennsylvania Railroad. After completing the eighth grade, he began to work with his father at the railroad, while starting with his freshman year. Aged 14, he continued to attend morning sessions in the local high school, working afternoons and evenings for the railroad. Failing to receive a high school diploma, in 1909, Harry enrolled at Altoona Business College at the age of 17, and for the next two years received additional tutoring. In 1912, he was granted a furlough permitting him to enroll at Pennsylvania State College, where he studied in a two-year associate degree program in business and engineering, while working during weekends and vacation periods.

==Rise to prominence==
Anslinger gained notoriety early in his career. At the age of 23 (in 1915), while working as an investigator for the Pennsylvania Railroad, he performed a detailed investigation that found the $50,000 claim of a widower in a railroad accident to be fraudulent. He saved the company the payout and was promoted to captain of railroad police.

From 1917 to 1928, Anslinger worked for various military and police organizations on stopping international drug trafficking. His duties took him all over the world, from Germany to Venezuela to Japan. He is widely credited with shaping not only America&#x27;s domestic and international drug policies but influencing drug policies of other nations, particularly those that had not debated the issues internally.

By 1929, Anslinger returned from his international tour to absorb the duties of Levi G. Nutt as assistant commissioner for the Narcotics Division of the Bureau of Prohibition. At that time, corruption and scandal gripped prohibition and narcotics agencies, and Nutt was caught in the scandal surrounding the business relationship of his son to a gangster and bootlegger named Arnold Rothstein. The ensuing shake-ups and re-organizations set the stage for Anslinger, perceived as an honest and incorruptible figure, to advance not only in rank but in political stature. Anslinger also assumed all the duties of Nutt&#x27;s role as Secretary of the Federal Narcotics Control Board, which was dissolved less than a year later in June 1930.

In 1930, at age 38, Anslinger was appointed the founding commissioner of the Treasury&#x27;s Federal Bureau of Narcotics. The illegal trade in alcohol (then still under Prohibition) and illicit drugs was targeted by the Treasury, not primarily as social evils that fell under other government purview, but as losses of untaxed revenue. Appointed by department Secretary Andrew W. Mellon, who was his wife&#x27;s uncle, Anslinger was given a budget of $100,000 and wide scope.

==Campaign against cannabis (1930–1937)==
Restrictions on cannabis (&quot;cannabis sativa&quot;, often called &quot;Indian Hemp&quot; in documents before the 1940s) as a drug started in local laws in New York in 1860. That was followed by local laws in many other states, and by state laws in the 1910s and 1920s.| The federal Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 regulated the labeling of patent medicines that contained &quot;cannabis indica&quot;. In 1925, in the International Opium Convention, the United States supported regulation of &quot;Indian hemp&quot; in its use as a drug. Recommendations from the International Opium Convention inspired the work with the Uniform State Narcotic Act between 1925 and 1932.

Anslinger had not been active in that process until approximately 1930. Anslinger collected stories of cannabis causing crime and violence, and ignored evidence that allowed for other interpretations. Doctor Walter Bromberg pointed out that substance abuse and crime are heavily confounded and that none of a group of 2,216 criminal convictions he had examined was clearly connected to cannabis&#x27;s influence. He also ignored a discussion forwarded to him by the American Medical Association, in which 29 of 30 pharmacists and drug industry representatives objected to his proposals to ban cannabis. One such statement claimed that the proposal was &quot;Absolute rot. It is not necessary. I have never known of its misuse.&quot;. However, only the single dissenter (who noted he had once encountered a doctor who had been addicted to cannabis) was preserved in Bureau files.

As head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, Anslinger sought, and ultimately received, an increase of reports about smoking of cannabis in 1936 that continued to spread at an accelerated pace in 1937. Before that, the smoking of cannabis had been relatively slight and confined to the Southwest, particularly along the Mexican border.

===Promotion of cannabis as public harm=== 
The Bureau first prepared a legislative plan to seek a new law from Congress that would place cannabis and its distribution directly under federal control. Second, Anslinger ran a campaign against cannabis on radio and at major forums. His view was clear, ideological and judgmental:

By using the mass media as his forum, and receiving much support from yellow journalism publisher William Randolph Hearst, Anslinger propelled the anti-cannabis sentiment from state level to a national movement. He used what he called his &quot;Gore Files&quot; - a collection of quotes from police reports - to graphically depict offenses caused by drug users. They were written in the terse and concise language of a police report. His most infamous story in &quot;The American Magazine&quot; concerned Victor Licata, who killed his family:
This story was referenced in the 1937 anti-weed film &quot;Reefer Madness&quot;. It is one of 200 violent crimes which were documented in Anslinger&#x27;s &quot;Gore Files&quot; series. It has since been discovered that Licata murdered his family due to severe mental illness, which had been diagnosed early in his youth, and not because of cannabis use. Researchers have now proved that Anslinger wrongly attributed 198 of the &quot;Gore Files&quot; stories to cannabis usage, and the remaining &quot;two cases could not be disproved because no records existed concerning the crimes.&quot; During the 1937 Marihuana Tax Act hearings, Anslinger rehashed the 1933 Licata killings while giving testimony to Congress.

===Contemporary racial prejudice=== 
In the 1930s, Anslinger&#x27;s anti-cannabis articles often contained racist themes, to the point that contemporary conservative politicians at one point called for Anslinger to resign based solely on his open racist remarks:

Though these stories were often true (whatever the role of cannabis in them), Anslinger&#x27;s basic attitude was shown in remarks not related to any particular story, such as:

According to Johann Hari, the Federal Bureau of Narcotics under Anslinger targeted Billie Holiday in response to her 1939 song &quot;Strange Fruit,&quot; which criticized racist lynchings. Hari wrote that Anslinger assigned an agent to track her after she refused to stop speaking out about racism. According to Hari, Anslinger used the war on drugs as a pretext for the Federal Bureau of Narcotics who had little to do following the end of prohibition. Hari states that Anslinger hated addicts, Latinos, and African Americans and that Anslinger was &quot;so racist that he was regarded as a crazy racist in the 1920s.&quot; However, these allegations have been disputed, with historian Lewis Porter noting that &quot;there was no federal objection to the song “Strange Fruit,” nor was there any campaign to suppress it&quot; and Holiday was instead pursued by Bureau of Narcotics mainly for her history of drug use. Porter writes that Johann Hari&#x27;s 2015 book, &quot;Chasing the Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on Drugs&quot;, is where the allegation that Holiday was targeted for singing &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; originated and that this claim didn&#x27;t appear anywhere else before that.

In his 1964 book, &quot;The Protectors&quot;, Anslinger included a chapter called &quot;Jazz and Junk Don&#x27;t Mix&quot;, about black jazz musicians Billie Holiday, who had been handcuffed on her death bed due to suspicion of drug use and possession, and Charlie Parker, who both died after years of illegal heroin and alcohol abuse:

Anslinger hoped to orchestrate a nationwide dragnet of jazz musicians and kept a file called &quot;Marijuana and Musicians.&quot;

===Campaign assessment===
Some critics of Anslinger claim his campaign against cannabis had a hidden agenda rooted in commercial interests not societal welfare. One example of this is that the E. I. DuPont De Nemours and Company industrial firm, petrochemical interests and William Randolph Hearst conspired together to create the highly sensational anti-cannabis campaign so as to eliminate hemp as an industrial competitor to synthetic materials. However, the DuPont Company and industrial historians have dismissed any link between development of nylon and changes in the laws relating to hemp (cannabis); pointing out nylon was a huge success from the start. It was not until 1934, and his fourth year in office, that Anslinger considered cannabis to be a serious threat to American society (Wallace Carothers first synthesized nylon on February 28, 1935). This was part of a worldwide trend, unrelated to racial or industrial issues in America; The League of Nations had already implemented restrictions on cannabis in the beginning of the 1930s, and many states in the U.S. had started restricting it in the years before Anslinger was appointed. In 1935, both President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his attorney general publicly supported the campaign. Anslinger&#x27;s efforts were part of the government&#x27;s broader push to alarm the public about the danger of recreational drugs and to outlaw them. He did this with reference to his own agenda.

The La Guardia Committee, promoted in 1939 by New York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, was the first in-depth study into the effects of smoking cannabis. It systematically contradicted claims made by the U.S. Treasury Department that smoking cannabis resulted in insanity, and determined that &quot;the practice of smoking marihuana does not lead to addiction in the medical sense of the word.&quot; Released in 1944, the report infuriated Anslinger, who condemned it as unscientific.

==Later years==
Later in his career, Anslinger was scrutinized for insubordination for refusing to desist from an attempt to halt the ABA/AMA Joint Report on Narcotic Addiction, a publication edited by the sociology Professor Alfred R. Lindesmith of Indiana University. Among other works, Lindesmith wrote &quot;Opiate Addiction&quot; (1947), &quot;The Addict and the Law&quot; (1965), and a number of articles condemning the criminalization of addiction. Nearly everything Lindesmith did was critical of the War on Drugs, and he specifically condemned Anslinger&#x27;s role. The AMA/ABA controversy is sometimes credited with ending Anslinger&#x27;s position of Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics.
In his later years Anslinger also suffered a mental breakdown characterized by intense paranoia and irrational thoughts, such as believing that addiction was &#x27;contagious&#x27; and addicts had to be &#x27;quarantined&#x27; or talking about &#x27;secret plots&#x27; throughout the world; he was eventually hospitalized because of this breakdown.

Anslinger was surprised to be re-appointed by President John F. Kennedy in February 1961. The new president had a tendency to invigorate the government with more youthful civil servants and, by 1962, Anslinger was 70 years old, the mandatory age for retirement in his position. In addition, during the previous year, he had witnessed his wife Martha&#x27;s slow and agonizing death due to heart failure, and had lost some of his drive and ambition. On his 70th birthday, May 20, 1962, Anslinger submitted his resignation to Kennedy. Because Kennedy did not have a successor in place, however, Anslinger stayed on in his $18,500 a year ($145,733 when adjusted for inflation in 2014 dollars) position until later that year. He was succeeded by Henry Giordano in August. Following that, he was the United States&#x27; Representative to the United Nations Narcotics Commission for two years, after which he retired.

By 1973, Anslinger was completely blind, had a debilitatingly enlarged prostate gland, and suffered from angina. Ironically, when he died, Anslinger was being treated with regular doses of morphine, which had been prescribed for his angina.

Additionally, Anslinger provided morphine to Senator Joseph McCarthy, who was addicted to both alcohol and morphine. When Anslinger tried to persuade McCarthy to quit morphine, McCarthy reminded him of the potential for a public scandal. Anslinger relented and steadily supplied McCarthy with morphine that was paid for by the Bureau and obtained from a local drugstore. This arrangement continued until McCarthy&#x27;s death in 1957.

On November 14, 1975, at 1 p.m., Anslinger died of heart failure at the former Mercy Hospital (later known as Bon Secours Hospital Campus of the Altoona Regional Health System, now defunct) in Altoona, Pennsylvania. He was 83, and was buried at the Hollidaysburg Presbyterian Cemetery in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania.

He was survived by his son, Joseph Leet Anslinger, and a sister. According to John McWilliams&#x27;s 1990 book, &quot;The Protectors: Harry J.

<doc id="509577" wikidata="Q3832607" url="?curid=509577" title="Linda Johnson (poker player)">
<text>Linda Johnson (born October 14, 1953) is an American professional poker player, journalist and consultant, based in Las Vegas, Nevada. She was inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame in 2011.

==Early life==
Linda Johnson was born in Long Island, New York. Before becoming involved in poker, Johnson worked for the United States Postal Service and traveled to Las Vegas regularly to play blackjack. Her father, a career service member, convinced her that playing poker was the best way to gamble as it was not played against the house.

==Poker playing career==
Johnson began playing poker in 1974 and won a World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelet in 1997 in the $1,500 seven-card razz event.

She also appeared in the Poker Royale: Comedians vs. Pros series.

, her total live tournament winnings exceed $300,000.

==Other poker activities==

Johnson is known as &quot;The First Lady of Poker&quot;, a phrase coined by Mike Sexton due to her lengthy association with the game, in particular the World Poker Tour (WPT) as she explains in the Ladies Night episode of WPT Season 6.

She worked as the publisher of &quot;CardPlayer Magazine&quot; for eight years, before selling the company to Barry Shulman. However, she still writes articles for the magazine. She also set up the Tournament Directors Association (TDA), which sets common rules for tournaments such as the WPT. She continues to be involved with the TDA by serving on the Board of Directors.

Johnson was one of the founders of the World Poker Tour and was the announcer to the studio audience for its first six seasons. In addition, she is a partner in Card Player Cruises.

In 2009, Johnson helped found PokerGives.org, a nonprofit organization that makes it easier for poker players to donate to charity.

On Monday, February 27, 2017, the World Poker Tour awarded Ms. Linda Johnson with the inaugural WPT Honors Award, representing outstanding contributions to the WPT and the greater poker community. “We are proud to present Linda Johnson with the inaugural WPT Honors Award,” said Adam Pliska, CEO of the World Poker Tour. “The award represents WPT’s highest honor and will serve as a lasting tradition that allows us to recognize the most important people in our industry and in the WPT’s history. Linda played a unique role in helping shape the World Poker Tour, and she embodies all that the WPT stands for.&quot;

<doc id="509595" wikidata="Q195872" url="?curid=509595" title="Blocking (martial arts)">
<text>In martial arts, blocking is the act of stopping or deflecting an opponent&#x27;s attack for the purpose of preventing injurious contact with the body. A block usually consists of placing a limb across the line of the attack.

== Examples in specific arts ==
Styles and types of blocking, as well as terminology, vary widely among the various martial arts. In Japanese martial arts such as Karate, these techniques are referred to as &quot;uke waza&quot;. Examples include &quot;age uke&quot; (rising block) and &quot;shuto uke&quot; (knife hand guarding block). In Korean martial arts such as taekwondo, these techniques are referred to as (막기), with some examples being (rising block) and (knifehand guarding block). Some martial arts, such as Capoeira, reject blocking techniques completely as they consider them too inefficient. In Capoeira, they use evasion instead of blocking.

==Types of blocks==

=== Inside blocks ===
An inside block deflects a strike away from the defender and away from the attacker. For example, against a straight punch to the face, an inside forearm block would aim to meet the inside of the forearm of the attacker, pushing the punch outward, leaving the opponents facing each other which also helps in counterattack.

=== Outside blocks ===
An outside block deflects a strike away from the defender and across the attacker. For example, against a straight punch to the face, an outside forearm block would aim to meet the outside forearm of the attacker, pushing the punch outward, leaving the defender slightly to the side of the strike causing it to miss. Typically, because of the angles involved, inward blocks are used against attacks aimed at the torso.

=== High blocks ===

A high block deflects a downward strike such as a hammer fist, a stick or a face punch from a taller opponent. The chamber starts low with the hand in a relaxed fist across the abdomen with the palm facing inward and in high block, face punch should be blocked in diagonal shape

=== Low blocks ===
A low block deflects an inward strike directed at the stomach or ribs such as a roundhouse kick.

=== Parries ===

Parries are executed against the attacker by quickly pushing their arm or leg away to the right or left side( as it is considered as a block) and counterattacking when the procedure is done.

===Other types of blocks and alternatives===
More complex blocks include the circular block, X block, high X block, twin forearm guarding block, hooking block, and pole block.

Offensive techniques can also be used to block. For example, a kick or palm strike can be used to neutralize an incoming blow. It is also common to use the knee to block leg attacks from an opponent.

Blocks are considered by some to be the most direct and least subtle of defensive techniques. Other ways of avoiding attack include evasion, trapping, slipping and deflection of the oncoming attack; this approach is often referred to as the application of &#x27;soft&#x27; techniques (see hard and soft (martial arts)).

<doc id="509616" wikidata="Q1190945" url="?curid=509616" title="The Boy Who Cried Wolf">
<text>The Boy Who Cried Wolf is one of Aesop&#x27;s Fables, numbered 210 in the Perry Index. From it is derived the English idiom &quot;to cry wolf&quot;, defined as &quot;to give a false alarm&quot; in &quot;Brewer&#x27;s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable&quot; and glossed by the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; as meaning to make false claims, with the result that subsequent true claims are disbelieved.

==Fable==
The tale concerns a shepherd boy who repeatedly fools villagers into thinking a wolf is attacking his town&#x27;s flock. When an actual wolf appears and the boy calls for help, the villagers believe that it is another false alarm, and the sheep are eaten by the wolf. In a later English-language poetic version of the fable, the wolf also eats the boy. This happens in &quot;Fables for &quot; (1830) by John Hookham Frere, in William Ellery Leonard&#x27;s &quot;Aesop &amp; Hyssop&quot; (1912), and in Louis Untermeyer&#x27;s 1965 poem.

The moral stated at the end of the Greek version is, &quot;this shows how liars are rewarded: even if they tell the truth, no one believes them&quot;. It echoes a statement attributed to Aristotle by Diogenes Laërtius in his &quot;The Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers&quot;, in which the sage was asked what those who tell lies gain by it and he answered &quot;that when they speak truth they are not believed&quot;. William Caxton similarly closes his version with the remark that &quot;.

==History==
The story dates from Classical times, but, since it was recorded only in Greek and not translated into Latin until the 15th century, it only began to gain currency after it appeared in Heinrich Steinhöwel&#x27;s collection of the fables and so spread through the rest of Europe. For this reason, there was no agreed title for the story. Caxton titles it &quot;&quot; (1484), Hieronymus Osius &quot;The boy who lied&quot; (&quot;&quot;, 1574), Francis Barlow &quot;Of the herd boy and the farmers&quot; (&quot;&quot;, 1687), Roger L&#x27;Estrange &quot;A boy and false alarms&quot; (1692), and George Fyler Townsend &quot;The shepherd boy and the wolf&quot; (1867). It was under the final title that Edward Hughes set it as the first of ten &quot;Songs from Aesop&#x27;s Fables&quot; for children&#x27;s voices and piano, in a poetic version by Peter Westmore (1965). It also features as the second of &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables for narrator and band&quot; (1999) by Scott Watson (b. 1964)

Teachers have used the fable as a cautionary tale about telling the truth, but an educational experiment in the first decade of the 21st century suggested that reading &quot;The Boy Who Cried Wolf&quot; increased children&#x27;s likelihood of lying; reading about George Washington and the cherry tree, however, decreased this likelihood dramatically. The suggestibility and favourable outcome of the behaviour described, therefore, seems the key to moral instruction of the young. However, when dealing with the moral behaviour of adults, Samuel Croxall asks, referencing political alarmism, &quot;when we are alarmed with imaginary dangers in respect of the public, till the cry grows quite stale and threadbare, how can it be expected we should know when to guard ourselves against real ones?&quot;

<text>The Ripping Friends: The World&#x27;s Most Manly Men! (also known as The Ripping Friends) is a Canadian-American animated television series created by John Kricfalusi, creator of &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; on Nickelodeon. The series aired for one season on Fox Kids, premiering on September 22, 2001 and ending on January 26, 2002. The show was subsequently picked up for syndication by Adult Swim, where it reran from 2002 to 2004. The show occasionally airs in Canada on Teletoon. The show also aired briefly in the United Kingdom on the CNX channel and on ABC in Australia.

==History==
Kricfalusi and his long-time collaborator Jim Smith created the &quot;Ripping Friends&quot; before they created the similar superhero Powdered Toast Man for &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;. After Nickelodeon fired Kricfalusi from &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; in September 1992, he had plans to make a feature film starring the world&#x27;s &quot;manliest men&quot;. The feature film plan was scrapped, but the characters were used in &quot;The Ripping Friends&quot;. Also, as early as a 1987 story session for the &quot;Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures&quot;, Kricfalusi, who would go on to develop the concept for &quot;The Ripping Friends&quot; for around a decade, had proposed using a wad of gum as a character, an idea which was employed to create the first villain for the new series, the Indigestible Wad. &quot;The Ripping Friends&quot; was slated to premiere in September 2000 along with another Spümcø show on Fox Family, &quot;The Heartaches&quot;, which follows the adventures surrounding a girl band. The latter one never made it to television, and &quot;The Ripping Friends&quot; first aired a year later, after missing another premiere slated for May 2001, lasting for thirteen episodes. The budget was set to US$400,000 per episode. Because of production costs, the show was cancelled after one season and thirteen episodes.

Kricfalusi felt the show&#x27;s animation supervisors were doing away with the Spümcø style (primarily Jim Smith&#x27;s designs) and was displeased with the direction. He was not fully involved until halfway through production and considers the episodes with his involvement to be experimental. One of his contributions to the show was directing the voice actors, whom he &quot;really worked out&quot; so much that he was afraid he&#x27;d give one of them a heart attack, which resulted in re-casting the original voice of Crag, Harvey Atkin, with Mark Dailey. Although Kricfalusi directed the actors, he recorded for his characters separately at his home.

==Plot==
The show focused on a group of four ultra-masculine, massively muscular superhuman brothers who attempt to fight crime from their base, RIPCOT (the Really Impressive Prototype City Of (Next) Tuesday): Crag, Rip, Slab, and Chunk Nuggett, Crag being the leader. Friends of the four include Jimmy the Idiot Boy, a mentally-challenged drooling child, and their foster mother He-Mom. The villains range from the Indigestible Wad (a wad of gum who sucks moisture out of people), to the evil Euroslavian dictator Citracett, to Flathead (an invertebrate in search of a spine), to their own underpants.

Each episode was usually tagged with a short episode which Kricfalusi says was composed of &quot;left overs&quot;. These segments were called &quot;Rip Along with the Ripping Friends&quot; and usually portrayed the Ripping Friends solving the problems of fans. These included: addressing the fact that hot dogs come in packs of 12 and the buns in packs of 8; &quot;ripping&quot; the man who creates insane video game controllers and the man who writes the instructions for them; and finding out why toys no longer come in cereal boxes, among others. In each segment viewers (referred to as &quot;kids&quot;) are asked to &quot;rip along&quot; with the action by ripping pieces of paper up in front of the television when coaxed to.

==Characters==
* Crag (voiced by Harvey Atkin in the earlier appearances, Mark Dailey in later appearances) – The two-fisted scientist leader of the Ripping Friends.
* Slab (voiced by Merwin Mondesir) – African-American member of the Ripping Friends and Crag&#x27;s right-hand man.
* Chunk Nuggett (voiced by Michael Kerr) – The often childish &quot;kid brother&quot; member of the Ripping Friends.
* Rip (voiced by Mike MacDonald) – The Kirk Douglas-style hothead of the Ripping Friends.
* Jimmy the Idiot Boy (voiced by John Kricfalusi) – The Ripping Friends&#x27; loyal, simple-minded assistant who they created from their combined DNA.
* He-Mom – The Ripping Friends&#x27; tough little foster mother whose sadistically brutal training regime and the all-meat diet she feeds them gives the brothers their superior strength and incredibly high tolerance for pain (in fact they actually seem to enjoy it).
* Citracett (voiced by John Kricfalusi) – The fiendish little dictator of Euroslavia who is the recurring antagonist of the series, a lemon-emblemed evil genius who later renames himself Stinkybutt the Foul after gaining the ability to use his own flatulence as a weapon.
*Dr. Jean Poole – Smart and sexy scientist who becomes the Ripping Friends&#x27; shared polyandrous girlfriend (once He-Mom explained to them what a &quot;girl&quot; was).

==Episodes==
==Censorship ==
* In a segment where Rip is asked by a fan to find out why hot dogs come in packs of twelve and hot dog buns come in packs of eight, Rip beats up a male hot dog and a female bun and asks them to &quot;hug&quot;. The hot dog begins to slip inside the bun, and the segment immediately fades to black. The scene was restored when the episode ran on Adult Swim.
* The episodes &quot;The Infernal Wedding&quot; and &quot;Jimmy&#x27;s Kidnapped&quot; never aired on Fox Kids at all, with the former being skipped due to scenes considered to be offensive following the September 11 attack. Both episodes would subsequently air on Adult Swim during reruns.

==Merchandise==
Hearst Entertainment and Spümcø licensed Playmates Toys to create toys based on the show. However, these toys were never released. A video game based on the show developed by Creations was released by THQ for the Game Boy Advance, and consulted by John Kricfalusi.

==Telecast and home media==
In the U.S., the series was first premiered on September 22, 2001 on Fox Kids until the final episode&#x27;s airing on January 26, 2002. Adult Swim later picked up the show, which aired from October 6, 2002 to March 28, 2004. The show occasionally airs in Canada on Teletoon. The show also aired briefly in the United Kingdom on the CNX channel and on ABC in Australia.

Two videotapes with two episodes each were initially available with the two volumes later combined into a single DVD release with four episodes.

In Australia, the complete series was released on Region 4 DVD by Madman Entertainment.

<doc id="509620" wikidata="Q182473" url="?curid=509620" title="Intercontinental Cup (1960–2004)">
<text>The Intercontinental Cup, officially the European/South American Cup and known from 1980 as the Toyota Cup for sponsorship reasons, was an international football competition endorsed by UEFA (Europe) and CONMEBOL (South America), contested between representative clubs from these confederations, usually the winners of the UEFA Champions League and the South American Copa Libertadores. It ran from 1960 to 2004, when it was succeeded by the FIFA Club World Cup, although they both ran concurrently in 2000.

From its formation in 1960 to 1979, the competition was as a two-legged tie, with a play-off if necessary until 1968, and penalty kicks later. During the 1970s, European participation in the Intercontinental Cup became a running question due to controversial events in the 1969 match, and some European Cup-winning teams withdrew. From 1980, the competition was rebranded and contested as a single match played in Japan, regarded neutral territory for both contestants, and sponsored by multinational automaker Toyota, which offered a secondary trophy, the Toyota Cup. At that point, the Japan Football Association was involved at a logistical level as host, though it continued to be endorsed by UEFA and CONMEBOL.

The first winner of the cup was Spanish side Real Madrid, who beat Peñarol of Uruguay in 1960. The last winner was Portuguese side Porto, defeating Colombian side Once Caldas in a penalty shoot-out in 2004. The competition ended in 2004. Since 2017, past Intercontinental Cup winners have been recognised by FIFA as club world champions.

==History==

===Beginnings===
According to Brazilian newspaper &quot;Tribuna de Imprensa&quot; in 1958, the idea for the Intercontinental Cup rose in 1958 in a conversation between the then president of the Brazilian FA João Havelange and French journalist Jacques Goddet. The first mention of the creation of the Intercontinental Cup and the Copa Libertadores was published by Brazilian and Spanish newspapers on 9 October 1958, referring to Havelange&#x27;s announcement of the project to create such competitions, which he uttered during a UEFA meeting he attended as an invitee. Prior to this announcement, the reigning European champions, Real Madrid, played just one intercontinental club competition, the 1957 Tournoi de Paris (they also played the 1956 Pequeña Copa, but scheduled their participation in it before becoming European champions). According to a video record of the highlights of the final match of the 1957 Tournoi de Paris, a video published by &quot;Journal Les Actualités Françaises&quot; on 19 June 1957, that match, held between Real Madrid and Vasco da Gama, was the first match ever dubbed as &quot;the best team of Europe vs. the best team of South America&quot;, as Madrid was the European champions and Vasco was the &quot;Brazilian&quot; (in fact, Rio de Janeiro) champions, having this match been held at Parc des Princes, then managed by Jacques Goddet; moreover, the 1957 Paris match was the only defeat of Real Madrid to a non-European side since becoming European champions in 1956 and prior to the Intercontinental Cup in 1960, having Madrid&#x27;s then-president Santiago Bernabéu been one of the instigators of the Intercontinental Cup (see below); for these reasons, some sources have claimed that the 1957 match and the 1958 FIFA World Cup Brazilian victory have influenced the Europeans on the importance of South American football, and thus the idea in 1958 for the creation of the Intercontinental Cup (&quot;the Madrid team declined to participate in the 1958 Paris Tournoi for it was held just 5 days before the final of the 1957/1958 European Cup&quot;). The Madrid-Vasco 1957 match was described as &quot;being like a club world cup match&quot; by the Brazilian press, as was a June 1959 friendly between Real Madrid and Torneio Rio – São Paulo champions Santos, which Real Madrid won 5–3.

Created in 1960 at the initiative of the European confederation (UEFA), with CONMEBOL&#x27;s support, the &quot;European/South American Cup&quot;, known also as the Intercontinental Cup, was contested by the holders of the European Champion Clubs&#x27; Cup and the winners of its newly established South American equivalent, the Copa Libertadores. The competition was not endorsed by FIFA, and in 1961 FIFA refused to allow it to take place unless the participants gave it a &quot;private friendly match&quot; status. However, the competition went on regardless, with the endorsement of UEFA and CONMEBOL, both of whom include every edition of the competition in their records. It was the brainchild of UEFA president Henri Delaunay, who also helped Jules Rimet in the realisation of the inaugural FIFA World Cup in 1930. Initially played over two legs, with a third match if required in the early years (when goal difference did not count), the competition had a rather turbulent existence. The first winners of the competition were Spanish club Real Madrid. Real Madrid managed to hold Uruguayan side Peñarol 0–0 in Montevideo and trounce the South Americans 5–1 in Madrid to win.

After Real Madrid&#x27;s victory in the first Intercontinental Cup, Barcelona newspaper &quot;Mundo Deportivo&quot; hailed the Madrid team as the first world champion club; although they pointed out that the competition &quot;did not include Africans, Asians and other countries part to FIFA&quot;, they also expressed doubt that these regions presented football of the same quality as Europe and South America. The Spaniards titled themselves &quot;world champions&quot; until FIFA stepped in and objected; citing that the competition did not grant the right to attempt participation to any other champions from outside Europe and South America, FIFA stated that they can only claim to be intercontinental champions of a competition played between two continental organisations (&quot;in contrast to the Intercontinental Cup, the right to attempt participation at the FIFA World Cup, through FIFA invitation in 1930 and qualification process since 1934, was open to every FIFA member-country, regardless of the continent where it was located&quot;). Peñarol would appear again the following year and come out victorious after beating Portuguese club Benfica on the play-off; after a 1–0 win by the Europeans in Lisboa and a 5–0 trashing by the South Americans, a play-off at the Estadio Centenario saw the home side squeeze a 2–1 win to become the first South American side to win the competition.

In 1962 the tournament grew more in worldwide attention after it was swept through the sublime football of a Santos team led by Pelé, considered by some the best club team of all times. &quot;Os Santásticos&quot;, also known as &quot;O Balé Branco&quot; (&quot;The White Ballet&quot;), which dazzled the world during that time and containing stars such as Gilmar, Mauro, Mengálvio, Coutinho, and Pepe, won the title after defeating Benfica 3–2 in Rio de Janeiro and thrashing the Europeans 2–5 in their Estádio da Luz. Santos would successfully defend the title in 1963 after being pushed all the way by Milan. After each side won 4–2 at their respective home legs, a play-off match at the Maracanã saw Santos keep the title after a tight 1–0 victory. The competition attracted the interest of other continents. The North and Central American confederation, CONCACAF, was created, among other reasons, to attempt the participation of North and Central American clubs in the Copa Libertadores, and thus in the Intercontinental Cup. Milan&#x27;s fierce rivals, Inter Milan, would go on to win the 1964 and 1965 Intercontinental Cups, beating Argentine club Independiente on both occasions, in 1964 after a play-off match won at Santiago Bernabéu in extra time with a goal from Mario Corso, becoming the first European team to win two times in a row the competition. Peñarol gained revenge for their loss in 1960 by crushing Real Madrid 4–0 in aggregate in 1966.

===Rioplatense violence===
However, as a result of the violence often practised in the Copa Libertadores by Argentine and Uruguayan clubs during the 1960s, disagreements with CONMEBOL, the lack of financial incentives and the violent, brutal and controversial way the Brazilian national team was treated in the 1966 FIFA World Cup by European teams, Brazilian football—including its club sides—declined to participate in international competitions in the late 1960s, including the Copa Libertadores and consequently the Intercontinental Cup. During this time, the competition became dogged by foul play. Calendar problems, acts of brutality, even on the pitch, and boycotts tarnished its image, to the point of bringing into question the wisdom of organising it at all.

The 1967 games between Argentina&#x27;s Racing Club and Scotland&#x27;s Celtic were violent affairs, with the third decisive game being dubbed &quot;The Battle of Montevideo&quot; after three players from the Scottish side and two from the Argentine side were sent off. A fourth Celtic player was also dismissed near the end of the game, but amid the chaos he got away with staying on.
The following season, Argentine side Estudiantes de La Plata faced England&#x27;s Manchester United in which the return leg saw Estudiantes come out on top of a bad-tempered series. But it was the events of 1969 which damaged the competition&#x27;s integrity.
 After a 3–0 win at San Siro, Milan went to Buenos Aires to play Estudiantes at &quot;La Bombonera&quot;. Estudiantes&#x27; players booted balls at the Milan team as they warmed up and hot coffee was poured on the Italians as they emerged from the tunnel by Estudiantes&#x27; fans. Estudiantes resorted to inflicting elbows and allegedly even needles at the Milanese team in order to intimidate them. Pierino Prati was knocked unconscious and continued for a further 20 minutes despite suffering from a mild concussion. Estudiantes goalkeeper Alberto Poletti also punched Gianni Rivera, but the most vicious treatment was reserved for Néstor Combin, an Argentinean-born striker, who had faced accusations of being a traitor as he was on the opposite side of the intercontinental match.

Combin was kicked in the face by Poletti and later had his nose and cheekbone broken by the elbow of Ramón Aguirre Suárez. Bloodied and broken, Combin was asked to return to the pitch by the referee but fainted. While unconscious, Combin was arrested by Argentine police on a charge of draft dodging, having not undertaken military service in the country. The player was forced to spend a night in the cells, eventually being released after explaining he had fulfilled national service requirements as a French citizen. Estudiantes won the game 2–1 but Milan took the title on aggregate.

Italian newspaper &quot;Gazzetta dello Sport&quot; dubbed it &quot;Ninety minutes of a man-hunt&quot;. The Argentinean press responded with &quot;The English were right&quot; – a reference to Alf Ramsey&#x27;s famous description of the Argentina national football team as &quot;animals&quot; during the 1966 FIFA World Cup. The Argentinean Football Association (AFA), under heavy international pressure, took stern action. Argentina&#x27;s president, military dictator Juan Carlos Onganía, summoned Estudiantes delegate Oscar Ferrari and demanded &quot;the severest appropriate measures in defence of the good name of the national sport. [It was a] lamentable spectacle which breached most norms of sporting ethics&quot;. Poletti was banned from the sport for life, Suárez was banned for 30 games, and Eduardo Manera for 20 with the former and latter serving a month in jail.

===Degradation===
Due to the brutality in the 1967 match, FIFA was called into providing penalties and regulating the tournament. However, FIFA stated that it could not stipulate regulations in a competition that it did not organise. Though the competition was endorsed by UEFA and CONMEBOL, René Courte, FIFA&#x27;s General Sub-Secretary, wrote an article shortly afterwards (1967) stating that FIFA viewed the competition as a &quot;European-South American friendly match&quot;. Courte&#x27;s statement was endorsed by then-FIFA president Sir Stanley Rous, who then stated that FIFA saw the Intercontinental Cup as a friendly match. After these controversial statements, Madrid newspaper &quot;ABC&quot; then pointed out that, though the Intercontinental Cup was not endorsed by FIFA, it was endorsed by UEFA and CONMEBOL, therefore being an &quot;intercontinental jurisdiction&quot; cup. However, with the AFC and CONCACAF club competitions in place, FIFA opened the idea of supervising the Intercontinental Cup if it included those confederations, which was met with a negative response from its participating confederations, UEFA and CONMEBOL. According to Rous, CONCACAF and the Asian Football Confederation had requested in 1967 to participate in the Intercontinental Cup, which was rejected by UEFA and CONMEBOL. In 1970, the FIFA Executive Committee gathering put forward, unsuccessfully, a proposal for the expansion of the Intercontinental Cup into a Club World Cup with representative clubs of every existing continental confederation. Nevertheless, some European champions started to decline participation in the tournament after the events of 1969.
Estudiantes would face Dutch side Feyenoord the following season, which saw the Dutch side victorious. Oscar Malbernat ripped off Joop van Daele&#x27;s glasses and trampled on them claiming that he was &quot;not allowed to play with glasses&quot;. Dutch side Ajax, European champions of 1971, would decline to face Uruguay&#x27;s Nacional due to violence in previous matches, which resulted in European Cup runners-up, Greek side Panathinaikos, participating. Ajax fears about Nacional&#x27;s brutal game were confirmed. In the first game in Athens, Uruguayan striker Julio Morales broke the leg of Yiannis Tomaras with a brutal blow. According to the Greek press of the time, the sound of the fracture was heard up to the stands. The Greek defender collapsed on the ground and was transported unconscious out of the field. The medical diagnosis was a fracture of the tibia and fibula, an injury that effectively ended his career. Nacional won the series 3–2 on aggregate.
Ajax participated in 1972 against Independiente. The team&#x27;s arrival at Buenos Aires was extremely hostile: Johan Cruyff received several death threats from Independiente&#x27;s local fan firms. Due to the indifference from the Argentine police, Ajax manager Ştefan Kovács appointed an organised emergency security detail for the &quot;Nederlandse meester&quot;, headed by himself and team member Barry Hulshoff, described as a big and burly man. In the first leg, Cruyff opened the scoring in Avellaneda at the 5th minute. As a result, Dante Mircoli retaliated with a vicious tackle a couple of minutes later; Cruyff was too injured to continue and the Dutch team found themselves being assaulted with tackles and punches. Kovács had to convince his team to play on during half-time as his players wanted to withdraw. Ajax squeezed a 1–1 tie and followed up with a 3–0 trounce in Amsterdam to win the Cup. Although Ajax were the defending champions, they again declined to participate in the 1973 Intercontinental Cup after Independiente won the Copa Libertadores again, leaving it to Juventus, European Cup runners-up, to play a single-match final won by the Argentines.
Also in 1973, French newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot;, which helped to bring about the birth of the European Cup, volunteered to sponsor a Club World Cup contested by the champions of Europe, South America, North and Central America, and Africa, the only continental club tournaments in existence at the time; the competition was to potentially take place in Paris between September and October 1974 with an eventual final to be held at the Parc des Princes. The proposal, supported by CONMEBOL, was dismissed due to the negativity of the Europeans. In 1974, João Havelange was elected president of FIFA, having made the proposal, among others, of creating a multicontinental Club World Cup. In 1975, &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot; once again made its 1973 proposal, again to no avail.

West German club Bayern Munich also declined to play in 1974 as Independiente again qualified to participate. European Cup runners-up Atlético Madrid from Spain won the competition 2–1 on aggregate. Once again, Independiente qualified to participate in 1975; this time, both finalists of the European Cup declined to participate and the competition was not played. That same year, &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot; tried, once again, to create a Club World Cup, in which the participants would have been: the four semifinalists of the European Cup, both finalists of the Copa Libertadores, as well as the African and Asian champions. However, UEFA declined once again and the proposal failed.

In 1976, when Brazilian side Cruzeiro won the Copa Libertadores, the European champions Bayern Munich willingly participated, with the Bavarians winning 2–0 on aggregate. In an interview with &quot;Jornal do Brasil&quot;, Bayern&#x27;s manager Dettmar Cramer denied that Bayern&#x27;s refusal to dispute the 1974 and 1975 Intercontinental Cups were a result of the rivals being Argentine teams. He claimed it was a scheduling impossibility, rather, which kept the Germans from participating. He also stated that the competition was not economically rewarding due to the team&#x27;s fan base&#x27;s disinterest in the Cup. To cover the costs of playing the first leg in Munich&#x27;s Olympiastadion, the organisers needed to have a minimum of 25,000 spectators. However, due to heavy snow and cold weather, only 18,000 showed up. Because of this deficit, Cramer stated that if Bayern were to win the European Cup again, they would decline to participate as it held no assurances of income, and that a friendly match, as the one Bayern Munich had scheduled in Tel Aviv, would have been more financially rewarding to them.
Argentine side Boca Juniors qualified for the 1977 and 1978 matches, for which the European champions, English club Liverpool, declined to participate on both occasions. In 1977, Boca Juniors defeated European Cup runners-up, German club Borussia Mönchengladbach, 5–2 on aggregate. Boca Juniors declined to face Belgian club Brugge in 1978 leaving that year&#x27;s competition undisputed. Paraguay&#x27;s Olimpia won the 1979 match against European Cup runners-up, Swedish side Malmö FF, after winning both legs. However, the competition had greatly declined in prestige. After the 0–1 win of the South Americans in the first leg at Malmö, which saw fewer than 5,000 Swedish fans turn up, &quot;Mundo Deportivo&quot; called the Cup &quot;a dog without an owner&quot;.

According to Brazilian newspaper &quot;O Estado de São Paulo&quot;, the deal for the establishment of the Interamerican Cup was made in 1968 by CONMEBOL and CONCACAF, and established that the Interamerican Cup champion club would be entitled to represent the American continent in the Intercontinental Cup. According to the Mexican newspapers, after winning the 1977 and 1980 Interamerican Cup tournaments, Mexican clubs América and PUMAS Unam, and the Mexican Football Association, demanded, unsuccessfully, to participate in the Intercontinental Cup, either by representing the American continent against the European champions or by creating a UEFA-CONMEBOL-CONCACAF tournament.

===Rebirth in Japan===

Seeing the deterioration of the Intercontinental Cup, Japanese motor corporation Toyota took the competition under its wing, and created contractual obligations to have the Intercontinental Cup played in Japan once a year, with every club participating being obliged to participate or face legal consequences. This modern format breathed new air into the competition which saw a new trophy handed out along with the Intercontinental Cup, the Toyota Cup.

In order to protect themselves against the possibility of European withdrawals, Toyota, UEFA and every European Cup participant signed annual contracts requiring the eventual winners of the European Cup to participate in the Intercontinental Cup – this was added as a condition to those UEFA stipulated for clubs to participate in the European Cup – or face an international lawsuit from UEFA and Toyota. Barcelona, the winners of the 1991–92 European Cup, considered not participating in the Intercontinental Cup in 1992, and the aforementioned contractual obligation weighed in for their decision to play.
The first Toyota Cup was held in 1980, which saw Uruguay&#x27;s Nacional triumph over Nottingham Forest. The 1980s saw a domination by South American sides as Brazil&#x27;s Flamengo and Grêmio, Uruguay&#x27;s Nacional and Peñarol, Argentina&#x27;s Independiente and River Plate take the spoils once each after Nacional&#x27;s victory in 1980. Only Juventus, Porto and Milan managed to bring the trophy back to Europe.

In that decade, the English Football Association attempted to organise a Club World Cup sponsored by promoting company West Nally, only to be shot down by UEFA.

The 1990s proved to be a decade dominated by European teams, as Milan, Red Star Belgrade, Ajax, Juventus, Real Madrid, Manchester United, and newcomers Borussia Dortmund of Germany were fuelled to victory by their economic powers and heavy poaching of South American stars. Only three titles went to South America, as São Paulo and Argentina&#x27;s Vélez Sársfield came out the winners, each of them defeating Milan, with São Paulo&#x27;s inaugural win being over Barcelona.

The 2000s would see Boca Juniors win the competition twice for South America, while European victories came from Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, and Porto.

The 2004 Intercontinental Cup proved to be the last one, as the competition was merged with the FIFA Club World Cup.

==International participation==

All the winning teams from Intercontinental Cup were regarded as de facto &quot;world club champions&quot;. According to some texts on FIFA.com, due to the superiority at sporting level of the European and South American clubs to the rest of the world, reflected earlier in the tournament for national teams, the winning clubs of the Intercontinental Cup were named world champions and can claim to be symbolic World champions, in a &quot;symbolic&quot; club world championship, while the FIFA Club World Cup would have another dimension, as the &quot;true&quot; world club showdown, created because, with the passage of time and the development of football outside Europe and South America, it had become &quot;unrealistic&quot; to continue to confer the symbolic title of world champion upon the winners of the Intercontinental Cup, the idea to expand it being mentioned for the first time in 1967 by Stanley Rous as CONCACAF and the AFC had established their continental club competitions and requested the participation, an expansion that was to occur only in 2000 through the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship. Nevertheless, some European champions started to decline participation in the tournament after the events of 1969. Though &quot;symbolic&quot; or &quot;de facto&quot; as a club world championship, the Intercontinental Cup has always been an official title at interconfederation level, with both UEFA and CONMEBOL having always considered all editions of the competition as part of their honours.

==FIFA recognition==
Throughout the history of football, various attempts have been made to organise a tournament that identifies &quot;the best club team in the world&quot; – such as the Football World Championship, the Lipton Trophy, the Copa Rio, the Pequeña Copa del Mundo and the International Soccer League– due to FIFA&#x27;s lack of interest or inability to organise club competitions, – the Intercontinental Cup is considered by FIFA as the predecessor to the FIFA Club World Cup, which was held for the first time in 2000.

On 27 October 2017, the FIFA Council, while not promoting statistical unification between the Intercontinental Cup and the Club World Cup, in respect to the history of the two tournaments (which merged in 2005), has made official (&quot;de jure&quot;) the world title of the Intercontinental Cup, recognising all the winners as club world champions, with the same title of the FIFA Club World Cup winners, or &quot;FIFA Club World Champions&quot;.

FIFA recognises the Intercontinental Cup as the sole direct predecessor of the Club World Cup, and the champions of both competitions are the only ones uncontroversially officially recognised by FIFA as Club World Champions, as seen in the &quot;FIFA Club World Cup Statistical Kit&quot;, the official document of FIFA&#x27;s club competition.

==Trophy==
The competition trophy bears the words &quot;Coupe Européenne-Sudamericaine&quot; (&quot;European-South American Cup&quot;) at the top. At the base of the trophy, there is the round logo of UEFA and a map of South America in a circle.

During the sponsorship by Toyota, the competition awarded an additional trophy, entitled &quot;Toyota Cup&quot;, usually given to the winning team&#x27;s vice-captain.

==Cup format==
From 1960 to 1979, the Intercontinental Cup was played in two legs. Between 1960 and 1968, the cup was decided on points only, the same format used by CONMEBOL to determine the winner of the Copa Libertadores final through 1987. Because of this format, a third match was needed when both teams were equal on points. Commonly this match was host by the continent where the last game of the series was played. From 1969 through 1979, the competition adopted the European standard method of aggregate score, with away goals.

Starting in 1980, the final became a single match. Up until 2001, the matches were held at Tokyo&#x27;s National Stadium. Finals since 2002 were held at the Yokohama International Stadium, also the venue of the 2002 FIFA World Cup final.

<text>Gerard A. &quot;Gerry&quot; Salton (8 March 1927 – 28 August 1995) was a professor of Computer Science at Cornell University. Salton was perhaps the leading computer scientist working in the field of information retrieval during his time, and &quot;the father of Information Retrieval&quot;. His group at Cornell developed the SMART Information Retrieval System, which he initiated when he was at Harvard. It was the first system to use the now popular vector space model for information retrieval.

== Education and career ==
Salton was born Gerhard Anton Sahlmann in Nuremberg, Germany. He came to the United States in 1947 and was naturalized in 1952. He received a Bachelor&#x27;s (1950) and Master&#x27;s (1952) degree in mathematics from Brooklyn College, and a Ph.D. from Harvard in applied mathematics in 1958, the last of Howard Aiken&#x27;s doctoral students, and taught there until 1965, when he joined Cornell University and co-founded its department of Computer Science.

Salton was perhaps most well known for developing the now widely used vector space model for Information Retrieval. In this model, both documents and queries are represented as vectors of term counts, and the similarity between a document and a query is given by the cosine between the term vector and the document vector. In this paper, he also introduced TF-IDF, or term-frequency-inverse-document frequency, a model in which the score of a term in a document is the ratio of the number of terms in that document divided by the frequency of the number of documents in which that term occurs. (The concept of inverse document frequency, a measure of specificity, had been introduced in 1972 by Karen Sparck-Jones.) Later in life, he became interested in automatic text summarization and analysis, as well as automatic hypertext generation. He published over 150 research articles and 5 books during his life.

== Honors and awards ==
Salton was editor-in-chief of the Communications of the ACM and the Journal of the ACM, and chaired Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval (SIGIR). He was an associate editor of the ACM Transactions on Information Systems. He was an ACM Fellow (elected 1995), received the Award of Merit from the American Society for Information Science (1989), and was the first recipient of the SIGIR Award for outstanding contributions to study of Information Retrieval (1983) -- now called the Gerard Salton Award.

* &quot;The Most Influential Paper Gerard Salton Never Wrote.&quot; Dubin D. This 2004 &quot;Library Trends&quot; paper (2004;52(4):748-764) by David Dubin serves as a historical review of the metamorphosis of the term discrimination value model (TDV) into the vector space model as an information retrieval model (VSM as an IR model). This paper calls into question what the Information Retrieval research community believed Salton&#x27;s vector space model was originally intended to model. What much later became an information retrieval model was originally a data-centric mathematical–computational model used as an explanatory device. In addition, Dubin&#x27;s paper points out that a 1975 Salton paper oft cited does not exist but is probably a combination of two other papers, neither of which actually refers to the VSM as an IR model.</text><links>

<text>The SMART (System for the Mechanical Analysis and Retrieval of Text) Information Retrieval System is an information retrieval system developed at Cornell University in the 1960s. Many important concepts in information retrieval were developed as part of research on the SMART system, including the vector space model, relevance feedback, and Rocchio classification.

Gerard Salton led the group that developed SMART. Other contributors included Mike Lesk.

The SMART system also provides a set of corpora, queries and reference rankings, taken from different subjects, notably
* ADI: publications from information science reviews
* Computer science
* Cranfield collection: publications from aeronautic reviews
* Forensic science: library science
* MEDLARS collection: publications from medical reviews
* Time magazine collection: archives of the generalist review &quot;Time&quot; in 1963

To the legacy of the SMART system belongs the so-called SMART triple notation, a mnemonic scheme for denoting tf-idf weighting variants in the vector space model. The mnemonic for representing a combination of weights takes the form codice_1, where the first three letters represents the term weighting of the collection document vector and the second three letters represents the term weighting for the query document vector. For example, codice_2 represents the codice_3 weighting applied to a collection document and the codice_4 weighting applied to a query document.

The following tables establish the SMART notation:
The gray letters in the first, fifth, and ninth columns are the scheme used by Salton and Buckley in their 1988 paper. The bold letters in the second, sixth, and tenth columns are the scheme used in experiments reported thereafter.

<text>Thirst is the craving for potable fluids, resulting in the basic instinct of animals to drink. It is an essential mechanism involved in fluid balance. It arises from a lack of fluids or an increase in the concentration of certain osmolites, such as sodium. If the water volume of the body falls below a certain threshold or the osmolite concentration becomes too high, structures in the brain detect changes in blood constituents and signal thirst.

Continuous dehydration can cause acute and chronic diseases, but is most often associated with renal and neurological disorders. Excessive thirst, called polydipsia, along with excessive urination, known as polyuria, may be an indication of diabetes mellitus or diabetes insipidus.

There are receptors and other systems in the body that detect a decreased volume or an increased osmolite concentration. Some sources distinguish &quot;extracellular thirst&quot; from &quot;intracellular thirst&quot;, where extracellular thirst is thirst generated by decreased volume and intracellular thirst is thirst generated by increased osmolite concentration.

==Detection==
It is vital for organisms to be able to maintain their fluid levels in very narrow ranges. The goal is to keep the interstitial fluid, the fluid outside the cell, at the same concentration as the intracellular fluid, the fluid inside the cell. This condition is called isotonic and occurs when the same levels of solutes are present on either side of the cell membrane so that the net water movement is zero. If the interstitial fluid has a higher concentration of solutes (or a lower concentration of water) than the intracellular fluid, it will pull water out of the cell. This condition is called hypertonic and if enough water leaves the cell, it will not be able to perform essential chemical functions. The animal will then become thirsty in response to the demand for water in the cell. After the animal drinks water, the interstitial fluid becomes less concentrated of solutes (more concentrated of water) than the intracellular fluid and the cell will fill with water as it tries to equalize the concentrations. This condition is called hypotonic and can be dangerous because it can cause the cell to swell and rupture. One set of receptors responsible for thirst detects the concentration of interstitial fluid. The other set of receptors detects blood volume.

===Decreased volume===

This is one of two types of thirst and is defined as thirst caused by loss of blood volume (hypovolemia) without depleting the intracellular fluid. This can be caused by blood loss, vomiting, and diarrhea. This loss of volume is problematic because if the total blood volume falls too low the heart cannot circulate blood effectively and the eventual result is hypovolemic shock. The vascular system responds by constricting blood vessels thereby creating a smaller volume for the blood to fill. This mechanical solution, however, has definite limits and usually must be supplemented with increased volume. The loss of blood volume is detected by cells in the kidneys and triggers thirst for both water and salt via the renin-angiotensin system.

====Renin-angiotensin system====
Hypovolemia leads to activation of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) and is detected by cells in the kidney. When these cells detect decreased blood flow due to the low volume they secrete an enzyme called renin. Renin then enters the blood where it catalyzes a protein called angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is then almost immediately converted by an enzyme already present in the blood to the active form of the protein, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II then travels in the blood until it reaches the posterior pituitary gland and the adrenal cortex, where it causes a cascade effect of hormones that cause the kidneys to retain water and sodium, increasing blood pressure. It is also responsible for the initiation of drinking behavior and salt appetite via the subfornical organ.

====Others====
* Arterial baroreceptors sense a decreased arterial pressure, and signal to the central nervous system in the area postrema and nucleus tractus solitarii.
* Cardiopulmonary receptors sense a decreased blood volume, and signal to area postrema and nucleus tractus solitarii.

===Cellular dehydration and osmoreceptor stimulation===

Osmometric thirst occurs when the solute concentration of the interstitial fluid increases. This increase draws water out of the cells, and they shrink in volume. The solute concentration of the interstitial fluid increases by high intake of sodium in diet or by the drop in volume of extracellular fluids (such as blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid) due to loss of water through perspiration, respiration, urination and defecation. The increase in interstitial fluid solute concentration causes water to migrate from the cells of the body, through their membranes, to the extracellular compartment, by osmosis, thus causing cellular dehydration.

Clusters of cells (osmoreceptors) in the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT) and subfornical organ (SFO), which lie outside of the blood brain barrier can detect the concentration of blood plasma and the presence of angiotensin II in the blood. They can then activate the median preoptic nucleus which initiates water seeking and ingestive behavior. Destruction of this part of the hypothalamus in humans and other animals results in partial or total loss of desire to drink even with extremely high salt concentration in the extracellular fluids. In addition, there are visceral osmoreceptors which project to the area postrema and nucleus tractus solitarii in the brain.

===Salt craving ===
Because sodium is also lost from the plasma in hypovolemia, the body&#x27;s need for salt proportionately increases in addition to thirst in such cases. This is also a result of the renin-angiotensin system activation.

===Elderly===
In adults over the age of 50 years, the body&#x27;s thirst sensation reduces and continues diminishing with age, putting this population at increased risk of dehydration. Several studies have demonstrated that elderly persons have lower total water intakes than younger adults, and that women are particularly at risk of too low an intake.
In 2009, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) included water as a macronutrient in its dietary reference values for the first time. Recommended intake volumes in the elderly are the same as for younger adults (2.0 L/day for females and 2.5 L/day for males) as despite lower energy consumption, the water requirement of this group is increased due to a reduction in renal concentrating capacity.

==Thirst quenching==

According to preliminary research, quenching of thirst – the homeostatic mechanism to stop drinking – occurs via two neural phases: a &quot;preabsorptive&quot; phase which signals quenched thirst many minutes before fluid is absorbed from the stomach and distributed to the body via the circulation, and a &quot;postabsorptive&quot; phase which is regulated by brain structures sensing to terminate fluid ingestion. The preabsorptive phase relies on sensory inputs in the mouth, pharynx, esophagus, and upper gastrointestinal tract to anticipate the amount of fluid needed, providing rapid signals to the brain to terminate drinking when the assessed amount has been consumed. The postabsorptive phase occurs via blood monitoring for osmolality, fluid volume, and sodium balance, which are collectively sensed in brain circumventricular organs linked via neural networks to terminate thirst when fluid balance is established.

Thirst quenching varies among animal species, with dogs, camels, sheep, goats, and deer replacing fluid deficits quickly when water is available, whereas humans and horses may need hours to restore fluid balance.

==Neurophysiology==

The areas of the brain that contribute to the sense of thirst are mainly located in the midbrain and the hindbrain. Specifically, the hypothalamus appears to play a key role in the regulation of thirst.

The area postrema and nucleus tractus solitarii signal to the subfornical organ and to the lateral parabrachial nucleus. The latter signaling relies on the neurotransmitter serotonin. The signal from the lateral parabrachial nucleus is relayed to the median preoptic nucleus.

The median preoptic nucleus and the subfornical organ receive signals of decreased volume and increased osmolite concentration. Finally, the signals are received in cortex areas of the forebrain where thirst arises. The subfornical organ and the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis contribute to regulating the overall bodily fluid balance by signalling to the hypothalamus to form vasopressin, which is later released by the pituitary gland. :3

<text>The Northern United States, commonly referred to as the American North, the Northern States, or simply the North, is a geographical and historical region of the United States.

==History==
===Early history===

Before the 19th century westward expansion, the &quot;Northern United States&quot; corresponded to the present day New England region. By the 1830s it corresponded to the present day Northeast and Great Lakes region.

Before 1865, the North was distinguished from the South on the issue of slavery. In Southern states, slavery was legal until the ratification of the 13th Amendment in 1865. Northern states had all passed some form of legislation to abolish slavery by 1804. However, abolition did not mean freedom for some existing slaves. Due to gradual abolition laws, slaves would still appear in some Northern states as far as the 1840 United States census. New Jersey was the last Northern state to end slavery when the 13th Amendment was ratified in 1865.

===American Civil War===
During the American Civil War (1861–1865), the Northern states comprised the U.S. states that supported the United States of America, referred to as the Union. In this context, &quot;the North&quot; is synonymous with the Union, while &quot;the South&quot; refers to the states that seceded from the U.S. to form the Confederate States of America.

There is, however, some historical disagreement as to exactly which states comprised the North in the context of the Civil War as five slave-holding states largely remained with the Union: the southern border states of Missouri, Kentucky, West Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware, along with the disputed Indian Territory, though Missouri and Kentucky had dual competing Confederate and Unionist governments with the Confederate government of Kentucky and the Confederate government of Missouri and the Confederacy controlled more than half of Kentucky and the southern portion of Missouri early in the war. The Confederacy largely lost control in both states after 1862; depending on the source, some of these states and territories may be included in either region.

==Geography==
Geographically, the term includes the U.S. states and regions of the United States of America that are located across the northernmost part of the country. It includes states along the Canada–United States border.

===Census Bureau===
The United States Census Bureau divides some of the northernmost United States into the Midwest Region and the Northeast Region. The U.S. Census Bureau also includes the northernmost states of the Northwest, that are within the West Region.

===Urban centers===
Among the larger cities by population in the Northern United States are: New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston, Pittsburgh, Columbus, Indianapolis, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Omaha, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, St. Paul, Wichita, Buffalo, Milwaukee, Detroit, and Des Moines.

The Northern United States also comprises most of the Northeast megalopolis, which is the most populated and urbanized megalopolis in the United States. The Great Lakes megalopolis is also located in the Northern United States, largely in the Great Lakes region and Midwest.

===Climate===
The Northern United States has a humid continental climate. Most of the Northern states have warm to hot summers and significant snowfall during the winter.

<text>Justin Raimondo (born Dennis Raimondo; November 18, 1951 – June 27, 2019) was an American author and the editorial director of Antiwar.com. He described himself as a &quot;conservative-paleo-libertarian.&quot;

==Early life==
Born in White Plains, New York, Raimondo moved with his family to Yorktown Heights, New York when he was very young. Raimondo described himself as a &quot;bad kid&quot;; to deter himself from this path he spent one year at a Jesuit-run school in upstate New York.

Around this time he took an interest in Ayn Rand&#x27;s philosophy of Objectivism. Later he joined Young Americans for Freedom. In the 1970s, he became active in the Libertarian Party. He &quot;joined the party in 1974, and was active in Roger MacBride&#x27;s 1976 presidential campaign, the LP&#x27;s second White House bid.&quot; He came to the defense of the White Night riots, which followed manslaughter conviction of Dan White for the deaths of San Francisco supervisor Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone.

In 1983, after a schism in the Libertarian Party, Raimondo left the party and attempted to organize a libertarian faction in the Republican Party known as the Libertarian Republican Organizing Committee. After 1989, Raimondo again began working with Rothbard in the anti-war, paleoconservative John Randolph Club, part of the Rockford Institute.

==Career==
===Early activism===
In 1980, Raimondo ran for public office for the first time. Running as a Libertarian candidate for the 16th district seat in the California State Assembly, Raimondo received 4,730 votes or 7.7% of the vote. In 1982, Raimondo ran for California&#x27;s 5th district seat in the United States House of Representatives as a Libertarian, against Democratic incumbent Phillip Burton and Republican challenger Milton Marks. He received 14.2% of the vote.

In the 1996 U.S. congressional elections, Raimondo ran as a Republican candidate in California&#x27;s 8th district against Nancy Pelosi. While he championed conservative and libertarian causes in general, the main emphasis of his campaign was his opposition to the deployment of U.S. troops in the Balkans and, in particular, Pelosi&#x27;s vote to that effect. Raimondo received 25,739 votes for 12.4 percent of the vote while Pelosi got 84.3 percent.

During the 1992, 1996, and 2000 presidential elections, Raimondo supported the campaigns of Pat Buchanan, both as a Republican and in the Reform Party. As he was an out gay man, his support of the social conservative Buchanan attracted considerable attention. The idea he &quot;wants to round us all up and send us to concentration camps is just a bunch of crap. It&#x27;s a lie and a smear. He welcomes gay workers in his campaign. He does not think that homosexuality is all that great a thing. But I don&#x27;t need his approval. Why does any gay person need anyone&#x27;s benediction?&quot;

In 1994, Raimondo was the San Francisco coordinator for the &quot;Save our State&quot; Proposition 187, which would have barred taxpayer funding of non-emergency services to illegal aliens in California. The measure was passed by California voters, but was later stayed by a federal court.

===Antiwar.com and later activities===
Raimondo and Eric Garris launched Antiwar.com in 1995. In 1999, during the Clinton administration&#x27;s military intervention in the Kosovo war, the site became a full-time effort, providing a platform for the pair&#x27;s opposition to foreign intervention. Raimondo was a vocal critic of the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the ongoing occupation.

In the 2004 presidential election, he wrote approvingly of candidate Ralph Nader in an article published in &quot;The American Conservative&quot;. &quot;Nader’s distrust of bigness, either corporate or governmental, his fear of centralized power, his sharp critique of the managerial-bureaucratic mentality, all recall the distinctively American tradition of individualist populism&quot;, he wrote.

Raimondo wrote positively about Ron Paul&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign, but expressed support for Dennis Kucinich. Unlike Ron Paul and his son, Rand, however, Raimondo supported abortion: &quot;The libertarian position is unequivocal: the mother has the absolute right to abortion, period.&quot; He was critical of Barack Obama&#x27;s Cabinet choices as President along with the President himself. However, when Obama nominated former Nebraska U.S. Senator Chuck Hagel for U.S. Secretary of Defense to succeed Leon Panetta, Raimondo came out in support for Hagel.

In 2016, he voted for Donald Trump on the basis of his foreign policy.

==Opinions==
===Major ideas and recurring themes===
Raimondo argued in a 2003 Antiwar.com column that Israel exerts a dominant force in the formulation of American foreign policy. Raimondo also believed that the United States was led into World War II through lies by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and that the U.S. deliberately provoked a war with Japan through economic sanctions. Raimondo&#x27;s views were compared by Christopher Hitchens to those of Charles Lindbergh, whom Raimondo once described as an &quot;American hero sprung from the heartland.&quot; Raimondo also wrote that Israeli intelligence operating in the U.S. had advance knowledge of the September 11, 2001 attacks.

Raimondo believed that the government should refrain from adopting laws that would prohibit discrimination against homosexuals. &quot;I think gays should have the right to discriminate against straight people if they want&quot;, he said in 2003. He also opposed the legal recognition of same-sex marriage and instead favored marriage privatization. Raimondo debated the issue of same-sex marriage with journalist Jonathan Rauch, who supports it. He also argued that after years of persecution by the state, LGBT rights activists sought to &quot;use the battering ram of government power&quot; to actively intervene on behalf of homosexuals.

===Religious views===
Though raised a Catholic, Raimondo described himself as &quot;not a believer.&quot; Raimondo further described his early interactions with the Catholic Church and a local Jesuit seminary in Yorktown Heights as being influential in his development, despite rejecting the notion of God. He described being &quot;taken with their engagement with ideas&quot; and discussions of philosophy, which he was lacking in traditional schools or from classmates at the time.

==Death==
Raimondo died of stage IV lung cancer on June 27, 2019, in Sebastopol, California. He was survived by his husband, Yoshinori Abe, and two sisters.

<text>The VBK-Raduga capsule was a reentry capsule that was used for returning materials to Earth&#x27;s surface from the space station &quot;Mir&quot;. They were brought to &quot;Mir&quot; in the Progress-M cargo craft&#x27;s dry cargo compartment. For return, the capsule would be substituted for the Progress&#x27; docking probe before it left the space station, and then after the Progress-M performed its deorbit burn, the capsule was ejected at 120 km altitude to reenter the atmosphere independently. It would then parachute to a landing area in Russia.

Each Raduga was about 1.5 m long, 60 cm in diameter, and had an unloaded mass of about 350 kg. It could return about 150 kg of cargo back to Earth. Use of the Raduga reduced the Progress-M&#x27;s cargo capacity by about 100 kg, to a maximum of about 2400 kg.

The European Space Agency studied a very similar system called PARES (Payload Retrieval System), for use in combination with the Automated Transfer Vehicle.

<doc id="509648" wikidata="Q247649" url="?curid=509648" title="Perception management">
<text>Perception management is a term originated by the US military. The US Department of Defense (DOD) gives this definition:
&quot;Perception&quot; is defined as the &quot;process by which individuals select, organize, and interpret the input from their senses to give meaning and order to the world around them&quot;. This definition overlaps with the higher-order perceptual processes as defined biologically (the lower-order biological processes are not susceptible to management; these low-level processes include underlying perceptual categorization performed &quot;prior&quot; to conscious categorization.). Components of perception include the perceiver, target of perception, and the situation. 
Factors that influence the perceiver include:
* Schema: organization and interpretation of information based on past experiences and knowledge
* Motivational state: needs, values, and desires of a perceiver at the time of perception
* Mood: emotions of the perceiver at the time of perception
Factors that influence the target include:
* Ambiguity: a lack of clarity. If ambiguity increases, the perceiver may find it harder to form an accurate perception
* Social status: a person&#x27;s real or perceived position in society or in an organization
* Impression management: an attempt to control the perceptions or impressions of others. Targets are likely to use impression management tactics when interacting with perceivers who have power over them. Several impression management tactics include behavioral matching between the target of perception and the perceiver, self-promotion (presenting one&#x27;s self in a positive light), conforming to situational norms, appreciating others, or being consistent.

==History==
The phrase &quot;perception management&quot; has often functioned as a euphemism for &quot;an aspect of information warfare.&quot; A scholar in the field notes a distinction between &quot;perception management&quot; and public diplomacy, which &quot;does not, as a rule, involve falsehood and deception, whereas these are important ingredients of perception management; the purpose is to get the other side to believe what one wishes it to believe, &quot;whatever&quot; the truth may be.&quot;
The phrase &quot;perception management&quot; is filtering into common use as a synonym for &quot;persuasion.&quot; Public relations firms now offer &quot;perception management&quot; as one of their services. Similarly, public officials who are being accused of shading the truth are now frequently charged with engaging in &quot;perception management&quot; when disseminating information to media or to the general public.

Although perception management operations are typically carried out within the international arena between governments, and between governments and citizens, use of perception management techniques have become part of mainstream information management systems in many ways that do not concern military campaigns or government relations with citizenry. Businesses may even contract with other businesses to conduct perception management for them, or they may conduct it in-house with their public relations staff.

As Stan Moore has written, &quot;Just because truth has been omitted, does not mean that truth is not true. Just because reality has not been perceived, does not mean that it is not real.&quot;

==Strategies==
There are nine strategies for perception management. According to Carlo Kopp, these include:
# Preparation – Having clear goals and knowing the ideal position you want people to hold.
# Credibility – Make sure all of your information is consistent, often using prejudices or expectations to increase credibility.
# Multichannel support – Have multiple arguments and fabricated facts to reinforce your information.
# Centralized control – Employing entities such as propaganda ministries or bureaus.
# Security – The nature of the deception campaign is known by few.
# Flexibility – The deception campaign adapts and changes over time as needs change.
# Coordination – The organization or propaganda ministry is organized in a hierarchical pattern in order to maintain consistent and synchronized distribution of information.
# Concealment – Contradicting information is hidden.
# Untruthful statements – Fabricate the truth.

==Organizational==
Organizations use perception management in daily internal and external interactions as well as prior to major product/strategy introductions and following events of crisis. Life cycle models of organizational development suggest that the growth and ultimate survival of a firm is dependent on how effectively business leaders navigate crisis, or crisis-like, events through their life cycles. As suggested by studies, organizational perception management involves actions that are designed and carried out by organizational spokespersons to influence audiences&#x27; perceptions of the organization. This definition is based on the understanding of four unique components of organizational perception management: perception of the organization; actions or tactics; organizational spokespersons; and organizational audiences. The organizational perceptions is further classified into three major forms namely organizational images, organizational reputation, and organizational identities.

=== Events ===
Perception management is often used by an organization in the following major events:
#&quot;Dealing with perception-threatening events:&quot; Include such events as scandals, accidents, product failures, controversial identity changes, upcoming performance reviews, and introduction of new identity or vision.
# &quot;Dealing with perception-enhancing events:&quot; Include such events as positive/negative ranking or rating by industry groups, overcoming hardships, and achievement of desired goals.

Following are the examples of perception management in relation to specific organizations or communities:

==US government==
Beginning in the 1950s, news media and public information organizations and individuals carried out assignments to manage the public&#x27;s perception of the CIA, according to the &quot;New York Times&quot;. Carl Bernstein wrote in 1977 that &quot;The CIA in the 1950s, &#x27;60s, and even early 70s had concentrated its relationships with journalists in the most prominent sectors of the American press corps, including four or five of the largest newspaper in the country, the broadcast networks, and the two major weekly news magazines.&quot; David Atlee Phillips, a former CIA station chief in Mexico City, described the method of recruitment years later to Bernstein: &quot;Somebody from the Agency says, &#x27;I want you to sign a piece of paper before I tell you what it&#x27;s about.&#x27; I didn&#x27;t hesitate to sign, and a lot of newsmen didn&#x27;t hesitate over the next twenty years.&quot;

The term &quot;perception management&quot; is not new to the lexicon of government language. For years the FBI has listed foreign perception management as one of eight &quot;key issue threats&quot; to national security, including it with terrorism, attacks on critical US infrastructure, and weapons proliferation among others. The FBI clearly recognizes perception management as a threat when it is directed at the US by foreign governments.

=== Department of Defense ===
Deception and sleight of hand are important in gaining advantages in war, both to gain domestic support of the operations and for the military against the enemy. Although perception management is specifically defined as being limited to foreign audiences, critics of the DOD charge that it also engages in domestic perception management. An example cited is the prohibition of viewing or photographing the flag draped caskets of dead military as they are unloaded in bulk upon arrival in the U.S. for further distribution, a policy only recently implemented. The DOD also describes perception management as an intent to provoke the behavior one wants out of a given individual. During the Cold War, The Pentagon sent undercover US journalists to Russia and Eastern Europe to write pro-American articles for local media outlets. A similar situation occurred in Iraq in 2005 when the US military covertly paid Iraqi newspapers to print stories written by US soldiers; these stories were geared towards enhancing the appearance of the US mission in Iraq.

Domestically, during the Vietnam War, critics allege the Pentagon exaggerated communist threats to the United States in order to gain more public support for an increasingly bloody war. This was similarly seen in 2003 with accusations that the government embellished the threat and existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.

The US military has demonstrated using perception management multiple times in modern warfare, even though it has proven to take a hit to its credibility among the American people. In late 2001 after 9/11, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld created the Pentagon&#x27;s Office of Strategic Influence (OSI). When it came to light, the Pentagon was initially criticized for simply using a perception management office to influence foreign states. The OSI was dismantled less than five months after its creation when sources alleged to the press that one of its goals was domestic influence, similar to the Iran-Contra era Office of Public Diplomacy. Shortly after, the Office of Special Plans was created with a more focused goal of selective intelligence vetting outside the normal chartered intelligence apparatus, with foreign propaganda activities moved to the Office of Information Activities under the direction of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict. In fact, strategic influence, special plans, psychological operations, and perception management are all direct synonyms within the DoD.

More recently, the DOD has continued to pursue actively a course of perception management about the Iraq War. &quot;The Department of Defense is conscious that there is an increasingly widespread public perception that the U.S. military is becoming brutalized by the campaign in Iraq. Recognizing its vulnerability to information and media flows, the DoD has identified the information domain as its new &#x27;asymmetric flank.

The level of use of perception management is continuing to grow throughout the Army. Until recently specialists, known as psychological operations officers and civil affairs officers, whose only purpose is to decide how to present information to the media and to the people of the current country that they are in only held positions in high division levels of command. The Army has decided that it is now necessary that these specialists be included in the transformed brigades and deal with &quot;everything from analyzing the enemy&#x27;s propaganda leaflets to talking with natives to see what the Army can do to make them their friends&quot;, said 3rd Brigade&#x27;s Civil Affairs Officer Maj. Glenn Tolle.

==Business==
Businesses shape the perceptions of the public in order to get the desired behavior and purchase patterns from consumers.

=== Advertising ===
In terms of advertising and brand image, without a perception to manage, no other form of communication can happen. That highlights the importance of the brand image. However, some research indicates that just being a known brand dramatically affects how consumers perceive it. A consumer may rationalize that if they have heard of a brand, the company must be spending a fair sum on advertising. If it is spending a lot on advertising, then the company must be reasonably profitable which means that other consumers must be buying the product and they must be satisfied enough with its performance; therefore, the product must be of reasonable quality. Sometimes managing perception can simply just mean giving consumers a perception. Advertising, without even considering its message and quality, adds to consumer opinions in a positive light.

=== Brand management ===
Companies often use brand management in an attempt to change a potential customer&#x27;s perception of the product&#x27;s value. Through positive association, a brand manager can strengthen the company&#x27;s marketing and gain brand value. This is an important step in perception management because it aims at producing the most effective results. Brand management deals with competitors, promotions, costs, and satisfaction in order to earn trust from consumers and show positive feedback.

=== Leadership ===
People can use perception management as a way to positively enhance their leadership abilities. A person&#x27;s ability to manage perceptions is what sets great leaders apart. What people – followers – appraise as effectiveness and ability as a leader becomes their perception, which then becomes reality. Unmanaged perceptions of a person&#x27;s followers create a reality opposite to what was wanted.

=== Marketing ===
The best medium for businesses to affect the perceptions of the public is through marketing. To get people to buy products, marketers must identify a &quot;need&quot; and manage the perception of the public so that they feel the product will fulfill that need.

This is not the same thing as manipulation, where businesses create something people don&#x27;t need, and marketers convince them that they do need it. Good perception management is to the benefit of the consumer, as it fulfills more of the customer&#x27;s needs, and to the benefit of the business, as it increases their revenue.

In some marketing schemas, marketers create a need that was not present and then offer to fulfill that need. A good example of this is credit card companies. Credit card companies are companies that, like most other companies, started off by providing a convenience to the population.

Credit cards offer an alternative method of payment to cash or check and make life simpler for many people; however, today there are over 600 million credit cards issued in the United States alone and four major credit card companies. It is no longer even possible to buy a car, get a home loan, or rent an apartment from many companies without a positive credit score.

This fact has necessitated the need for almost every citizen to have a credit card. However, many credit cards companies manage their perception to make sure that people continue to need credit cards, and control their perception so that many people do not fully understand what they are getting into. However, the fact that the average household in the United States is in over fifteen thousand dollars worth of debt never reaches the widespread public. Instead, they publicize how they will help if a card gets stolen, or that they have the lowest interest percentage compared to the other major competitors. But no company tells their customers that the promoted interest rate more than doubles if they do not pay the minimum balance on time. For instance, Discover&#x27;s interest rate increases to 18.99% after the first minimum balance is not paid on time.

In short, though credit cards are convenient and fulfill a need, the companies often make no mention of the negative effects that they might have on many of their users.

=== Risk management ===

The decision-making process in relation to the future is an element of business that has a great effect on the company&#x27;s future. If the company is too risk-averse, this leads to underperformance and a missed opportunity. If the company takes too many risks, it is likely that there will be a large amount of losses. Ultimately if this amount of risk-taking leads the perception of the company to exceed the boundaries of logic and fact, the company will most likely fail based on their poor perception. Companies today cannot afford not to manage perceptions. Though not a substitute for a substantial product, it is useful in &quot;sustaining the offering&quot; for a length of time.

=== International communication ===
The communication gaps that exist in international business can lead to misunderstandings. Perception management helps to prevent the complex emotional characteristics of communication from changing the original interpretation of the message. Perception management also serves to change the original interpretation of the message in order to prevent complex emotional characteristics in communication.

== Food and nutrition ==
Food and beverage manufacturers can manage the perceptions of consumers by controlling information on food labels. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires a label on most food sold in grocery stores. However, the FDA does not regulate dietary supplements. Many chain restaurants also try to make their food appear to be healthier but serve too large of a portion. Fast food restaurants use advertising to make their food appear healthier when they have not changed anything about it either. Consumers have to consider where their health and nutrition information is coming from. When one gets nutrition information from the media, one is getting it from the food industry and companies that could benefit from customers purchasing their products. On labels and packaging there are many different perception management techniques they use.

Here are some deceptive practices:
* Distribute sugar amounts among many ingredients
* Include &quot;healthy&quot; ingredients to make it appear to be healthy
* Use scientific names of ingredients to mask their nutritional value
* Use advertising or catch phrases to sell their product
* Not including contaminants (heavy metal, toxic substances)
* Using phrases like &quot;zero grams of trans fat&quot; because there is less than one gram in the serving size. This means there can be more than a gram of trans fat in the product though.
* Saying that a product is &quot;packed in fiber&quot; when that fiber may not be whole grain fiber. That means the fiber is coming from a less nutritious or healthy source.
* Using doctor recommendations or seals of approval on products to sell them. Companies are not even required to have doctors say that to use it on their packaging.
* A product can be &quot;low fat&quot; but that does not mean it is low in calories. A product&#x27;s name can also be misleading. For instance, the food industry advertises high fructose corn syrup as being made from corn without artificial ingredients, having the same calories as sugar and acceptable when used in moderation. Despite its name, high fructose corn syrup is simply a sugar made from corn or an added sugar in the diet. It is not high in fructose as its name would suggest. High fructose corn syrup is composed of the same two simple sugars (fructose and glucose) as table sugar, honey and maple syrup.

Perception management is essentially a means for which an image or reputation can be created and maintained, whether it is true or not. On September 24, 2011, The American Dietetic Association announced it would change its name to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. In this case, the ADA is adjusting its name to more accurately describe the organization. According to Escott-Stump, &quot;The name Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics promotes the strong science background and academic expertise of our members.&quot; It is thought that by adding the word nutrition to its name, the organization is better able to communicate its ability to transfer nutritional science and research into healthy lifestyles and foods everyone can understand. Also, by keeping dietetics, it creates a connection between the new research and the history and reputation ADA has as a food and science-based profession. Escott-Stump reassured the public that although the name is changing, the organization&#x27;s mission will remain the same as it has been for nearly 100 years.

==Alcohol==
The Society for the Study of Addiction published a paper by researchers at the Deakin University School of Psychology, Australia, about a study of use of public relations companies by the alcohol industry. The study proposes that &quot;...alcohol industry &#x27;social aspects/public relations&#x27; organizations (SAPROs) serve the agenda of lending credibility to industry claims of corporate responsibility while promoting ineffective industry-friendly interventions (such as school-based education or TV advertising campaigns) and creating doubt about interventions which have a strong evidence base (such as higher taxes on alcoholic beverages).&quot;

The study concluded that Australian SAPRO Drinkwise &quot;has been used by the alcohol industry to create an impression of social responsibility while promoting interventions that maintain profits and campaigning against effective interventions such as higher taxes on alcohol&quot;.

==Fashion and design==
Perception management is a robust component in the fashion industry. Fashion stylists are responsible for providing perception management in the branding of products, and in creating the public persona of both individuals, businesses, and brands, through means of wardrobe, appearance, and communication skills. As with any product, perception management influences purchasing decisions. According to one analyst, &quot;In the external environment, the offerings of competitors, with which a customer compares a product or service will change, thus altering his perception of the best offer around. Another point is that the public opinion towards certain issues can change. This effect can reach from fashion trends to the public expectation of good corporate citizenship.&quot; Other effects of perception management in fashion include that &quot;a commonplace strategy to circumvent the loss of exclusivity associated with high market share is to leverage the brand by introducing new related brands. This is very efficient with fragrances or fashion brands.&quot;

==Celebrity==
Public relation firms are now offering services to celebrity clients in perception management or reputation repair. It is a new tool for public firms that lets large firms pour huge resources to the public through websites. The web helps public relations executives to reach out the news media and it offer ways to link the public relations people and news media. For example, firms provide direct email addresses of some business journalists.
A new trend in perception management is athletes signing with major public relation firms. Well-known agencies, such as William Morris and competitor Creative Artists Agency, recently started attracting huge sports stars. Alex Rodriguez joined the company after his alleged affair with Madonna, during the summer of 2008. He is following in the footsteps of Serena Williams, Kevin Garnett, and Vince Young, who are all represented by the William Morris agency.
In the case of Britney Spears, the media has tarnished and skewed the way she is perceived by the public. In a short January 2007 interview conducted by contactmusic.com, Spears exclaims, &quot;the media has had a lot of fun exaggerating my every move&quot;.
Another case of media skewing our interpretation of celebrities is in the case of Miley Cyrus. After her music video controversy, &quot;Can&#x27;t Be Tamed&quot;, her album sales declined to 72% less than her 2008 solo debut, &quot;Breakout&quot;.

==Technology and privacy==
Results from a survey conducted in Hamburg in 2006 suggest that closed-circuit television (CCTV) has little to do with manufacturing security/feelings of safety among people. It seems that preceding spatial perceptions have a greater impact on whether a certain space or place is regarded as being unsafe or not.

==Universities==
A research article in the journal &quot;Disability &amp; Society&quot; gives an account of students with hidden disabilities and their experience with the behavior of their peers when their disability is revealed. These students actively manage the perception of others because the awareness of their disability &quot;altered the behavior of others towards them&quot;.

==Foreign policy and terrorism==
Perception management has long been a key issue in the United States government. Beginning in the 1950s, the CIA contracted out several hundred different public information and news agencies for different &quot;assignments&quot;. This practice grew, and currently operates with several thousand initiatives helping to privately shape public opinion of the government. Indeed, the Department of Defense views perception management as a psychological operation aimed at eliciting the desired behavior by manipulating the opinions of both enemies and friends. Best put by the DOD directly, &quot;Perception management combines truth projection, operations security, cover and deception, and psychological operations.&quot;
Since the U.S. engaged in the War on Terror, perception management tactics have become vital to military success and relations with other countries.
Typical counter-terrorism (CT) thinking focuses on the violence, or its associated threat, to identify and exploit associated avenues for meaningful response and reaction.

==Politics==
Perception management in politics is referred to as &quot;political marketing strategy&quot;, or &quot;strategic political marketing&quot;. It originated from traditional business marketing strategies applied to politics, largely for the purpose of winning elections. Political parties and actors can choose between two fundamental methods: leading the market or following the market. Leading the market involves fulfilling underlying demands of principle, and a political actor would essentially assume the position of one who leads on their own ideas and principles. Following the market entails the political actor&#x27;s reliance on research such as public opinion surveys and adoption of those principles and ideas held by the majority of the people who the political actor wishes to influence.

Central to political marketing is the concept of strategic political postures—positions organizations assume to prompt the desired perceptions in a target group. Each strategic political posture relies on a different mix of leading and following, and includes four general types of postures:
* the political lightweight: neither leads nor follows very well; does not represent a posture easily sustained; is not confident in own ideals or particularly concerned with adapting to the needs and wants of constituents.
* the convinced ideologist: leads exceedingly well, holding its own opinions and endeavoring to convince others of their merit.
* the tactical populist: emphasizes following to achieve power; focuses on adopting political policies that appeal to a majority in order to attain the political power necessary to implement a party&#x27;s goals.
* the relationship builder: both leads and follows; has confidence in own ideas but able to adapt to the needs and wants of constituents.
Political market orientation (PMO) originated from commercial market orientation strategies applied to a political environment. Developed by Robert Ormrod, the comprehensive PMO model involves four attitudinal constructs and four behavioral methods:

Organizational attitudes include:
* Internal orientation: focuses on including and acknowledging the importance of other party members and their opinions
* Voter orientation: focuses on the importance of current and future voters and the awareness of their needs.
* Competitor orientation: focuses on awareness of competitors&#x27; positions and strengths, and acknowledges that cooperation with competing parties can advance the party&#x27;s long-term goals.
* External orientation: focuses on the importance of parties that are neither voters nor competitors, including media, interest groups, and lobbyists.

Organizational behaviors include:
* Information generation: focuses on gathering information about every party involved in a given issue.
* Information dissemination: focuses on receiving and communicating information, both formally and informally.
* Member participation: focuses on involving all party members, through vigorous discussion and debate, to create a consistent party strategy.
* Consistent Strategy Implementation: focuses on implementing consistent, established strategies through formal and informal channels.

== Journalism ==
Journalism is a field that organizations, companies, governments, and individuals will attempt to use to manage the public&#x27;s perception of that specific organization, company, government, or person. Perception management through journalism has been seen especially in regard to government propaganda and war. This becomes problematic when governments promote certain ideas that they want the public to believe through journalism, without the journalists and media properly attributing their sources.

Another issue in the journalism field is between the corporate business of keeping a news organization afloat versus the ethics of reporting and reporting the truth. Just as with any other major corporation or even small businesses there are conflicts between the reporters and the executives within a news organization. Reporters with strong ethics will want to run all stories that are &quot;newsworthy&quot;, but some of those stories may be censored by editors because the executives have sent a note down the chain specifying that a certain story may or may not run.

==Psychology==

In restaurants, the staff will frequently overestimate the wait time for a group of customers to be seated because when they are seated quicker, they experience increased satisfaction and perceive the restaurant in a more favorable manner. Psychology is important for perception management to be effective, because knowing the way the human mind functions and thinks is necessary to give the customers the satisfaction they want and expect.

==Athletics==
Baseball player Sammy Sosa used perception management after he was ejected from a game in 2003 when he was caught using a corked bat. His explanation was that he only uses the corked bat for batting practice so he can hit more home runs and put on a show for fans. He claimed picking up the corked bat for the game was an honest mistake and apologized to everybody. The perception of hitting home runs even with the corked bat could have helped Sammy Sosa hit future home runs without a corked bat because he knew what it felt like to hit a home run and he knew that he could do it, especially when he got away with using the corked bat in games.
Golfer Arnold Palmer used perception management as well. In the 1960 U.S. Open, Palmer saw the first hole at Cherry Hills as an eagle opportunity. He perceived that if he could simply drive the ball into the longer rough in order to slow it down before it rolled across the very fast green, he could make the putt for eagle. Many doubted Palmer when he spoke of doing so, but that did not stop him. Palmer did exactly what he perceived of doing, making the eagle, and later going on to win.
A study performed in June 2008 revealed that perception is closely correlated with performance. Nine different sized black circles were glued onto a white background. After a round of golf, forty-six golfers were asked which black circle was the size of the hole on the putting greens. The players with the overall better scores perceived the hole to be bigger than it actually is, so they chose the bigger black circles. The players with the worse scores perceived the hole as being smaller than it actually is.

=== Training ===

For many years people viewed concussions and big tackles in football games as athletes just &quot;getting their bell rung&quot; and coaches implored them to &quot;shake it off and get back in the game&quot;. However, a concussion is a traumatic brain injury that may temporarily interfere with the way the brain works and can affect memory, judgment, reflexes, speech, balance, coordination and sleep patterns. A study from the National Center for Injury Prevention found that 47 percent of high school football players say they suffer a concussion each season, with 37 percent of those reporting multiple concussions in a season. Serious injuries deserve appropriate attention to treatment and to prevention. With a concussion, function may be interrupted but there is no structural damage to the brain, so a physical examination often appears normal. The American College of Sports Medicine estimates that 85 percent of sports-related concussions go undiagnosed because athletes deny or fail to report symptoms and because subtle changes in brain function may not be obvious on a single examination. In May 2008, the CDC implemented new standards for concussion management, which required athletes who are involved in a play where a concussion was possible (a direct blow to the head) to be evaluated by a certified athletic trainer or a qualified physician if available. The standards go on to say that if the athlete has any signs of a concussion, they are not able to return to play for the rest of the game or practice. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, this seems like a good policy in theory, but with football season being over for a large majority of high schools (football having the highest risk of concussion), experts found that athletes have found ways to get around the standards, such as denying any concussion symptoms they are having, learning how to answer questions to hide any signs of concussion, or not saying anything about the possible concussion to the athletic trainer or physician working at the game. With these strategies, athletes put themselves at risk for the &quot;second concussion&quot;, which can leave permanent brain damage and can even lead to death. Although in theory these new standards for concussions are great for significantly reducing the risk of missing symptoms that appear after 24 hours and preventing any further brain damage, but with athletes now hiding possible concussions from athletic trainers and physicians, these standards may actually have a negative effect on concussion management.

=== Sponsorship ===
Perception management is the idea of using an image as a tool for identification of sponsorship opportunities. An effective sponsorship relationship outlines a good match between the image the company wants to promote and the image of the sponsored body, and if successful, elevates both. Perception management directs both behavior and communication activities as it works towards the establishment of a common vision of reality in a given social group.
In the case of Tiger Woods, the sales of his clothing brand, which is part of Nike Golf, have drastically declined since his scandal due to perception management.

=== Environmental impacts ===
Professional sports teams in the United States are beginning to engage in corporate pro-environmental behavior (CPEB). Many sports leagues and teams have pledged commitments to sustainability in areas such as their facilities, venues, and major events. Even events on a global scale such as the Olympic Games and FIFA World Cup, emphatically have endorsed the reduction of their environmental impacts. Not only can the teams benefit economically and ecologically, but &quot;for-profit businesses may also engage in CPEB in order to control its public image, reputation, and identity.&quot; They want to make sure they are in good standing with the public since they realize that many of them now relate to the &quot;green&quot; lifestyle. While fans act as the consumers of the teams product&#x27;s and events, non-fans can also &quot;have significant influence as voters on sport facility subsidization referendums&quot;. That being said, it is very important for the sports teams to maintain a positive image, and &quot;going green&quot; can do just that.

=== Signing ===

Conflicts of interest and consolidation in the sports agency industry arise through &quot;the fierce competition to sign and retain athletes&quot;.

The majority of literature regarding employee-organization relationships focus on perceived organizational support. More specifically, &quot;the primary purposes of this study were to: (a) examine the antecedents of POS; (b) examine the consequences of POS, including, affective commitment, job satisfaction, and turnover intention; and (c) assess gender differences in regard to these antecedents and consequences, and (d) develop and test a comprehensive model of POS, applicable to intercollegiate athletic administrators.&quot;

==Censorship in China==
The Propaganda and Information Leading Group is generally responsible for censorship and control of information. The unit is also one of the largest in the CCP leadership organ.

Chinese military scholars argue that their nation has a long history of conducting &quot;psychological operations&quot;, a phrase that connotes important aspects of strategic deception and, to a certain degree, what the US Department of Defense portrays as perception management. For example, several articles published by the PLA&#x27;s Academy of Military Science (AMS) journal &quot;Zhongguo Junshi Kexue&quot;, examine psychological warfare and psychological operations mainly as a deception-oriented function of military strategy.

The Chinese government has also used strategies to manage the perception of their country to the rest of the world. Facing criticisms about its questionable domestic human rights policies, the Chinese government successfully deflected international media&#x27;s attention during the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics to the apolitical Olympic ideals by creating intensive coverage of the positive feedback for the Olympics on paper, TV, and online, despite governmental officers&#x27; promises to improve their poor history of protecting human rights when Beijing was still competing for the right to host the game in 2001.
The images and video captured that night by Chinese media would display only the packed, patriotic crowds and nothing of the rest of the celebrants, who were largely occupied with taking photos of themselves with friends, family, and even security personnel. The Beijing games were also an opportunity for China to show its rapid development. The presence of a large contingent of foreign businessmen, media, and politicians necessitated a strict system of perception management before and during the Olympic Games. The government wanted to ensure that it could use this opportunity to portray China as positively as possible by showcasing its development and modernity rather than some of its more internationally disliked features such as its domestic human rights policies and frequent government protests. China looked at its opportunity to host the Olympic Games as &quot;a definitive demonstration of its status as a world partner comparable to any power in the Western world&quot;. They made certain that those who would be directly talking to the media had the &quot;right&quot; talking points; mostly these focused on promoting the stability and dominance of China&#x27;s economy. The government restructured the landscape of Beijing to portray a sense of modernity to foreigners. Three new buildings called the &quot;bird buildings&quot; were constructed at a high cost, forcing a large number of residents to relocate. A couple of new subway lines are also built to increase the convenience for foreigners to reach the Olympic village. The government also did whatever it could to make the opening ceremonies of the Beijing Olympics more impressive and extravagant than any before. An example of how they managed perceptions in this realm was the intentional substitution of a more attractive girl, Lin Miaoke, to lip-sync &quot;Ode to the Motherland&quot; instead of using the original singer. In their opinion of the officials in charge, the original singer wasn&#x27;t attractive enough to favorably represent China. Beijing&#x27;s security forces were also greatly increased before and during the Olympic Games to ensure that no large protests could be started and possibly caught on camera by the media. Re-education camps and imprisonment were possible punishments for Chinese citizens who made known a desire to protest around the Games. The government also announced a few days prior to the opening ceremonies that three &quot;demonstration parks&quot; would be opened for protests, requiring a written request form five days in advance, although none of the requests were granted. Promotional materials are also made as ideal as possible, for example the slogan &quot;One World, One Dream&quot; referring to a unifying ideal of &quot;love for all mankind&quot;. There was even the creation of a slogan (&quot;Beijing Welcomes You&quot;), and five stuffed animal mascots used to portray Beijing and China as harmonious and cordial.

==Books==
John Grisham&#x27;s book &quot;The Appeal&quot; is about a multimillion-dollar suit against a chemical company in Mississippi that dumped harmful chemicals in the water supply to save money. The chemical company tries to pay off a Supreme Court justice to get out of any punitive monetary damages or civil charges. Grisham gives details in his book about one of the executives for the chemical company hiring a &quot;government relations&quot; firm in order to get a political stance on their issue and turn the company&#x27;s image around.

David Baldacci&#x27;s book, &quot;The Whole Truth&quot;, involves a shady perception management firm that creates an anti-Russia campaign for one of the largest international arms dealers. This perception management company &quot;employs various strategies at a grassroots YouTube level, as well as selectively leaking information to the corporate media, that seek to blame Russia for a host of terrible atrocities.&quot; The main character&#x27;s fiancé is killed because she starts to suspect foul play with all of the anti-Russia campaigning.

==Movies==
People in the movie industry can also use perception management through the movies they choose to make. One movie, &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot;, changed many people&#x27;s minds in a study comparing watchers and non-watchers views on global warming. The study, conducted by Anthony Leiserowitz, asked both groups how concerned they were about global warming, and 83 percent of watchers said they were very concerned compared to 72 percent of non-watchers. They also asked the watchers whether the movie made them less or more worried about global warming and 49 percent said they were more worried after seeing the movie.
Perception management is also important in the movie industry in terms of celebrity image. For example, much of the controversy over the 2010 Oscar-winning &quot;Black Swan&quot; centers around the fact that Natalie Portman is said to have danced for most of the movie. However, her double, Sarah Lane, claims that the majority of the dancing was done by herself. When she mentioned this in interviews, Lane noted that she was quickly told to keep quiet. The movies&#x27; producers were worried that this information would reflect negatively on Portman and affect her chances of winning an Oscar. Lane noted in an interview with &quot;Glamour&quot; that &quot;They were trying to create this image, this facade, really, that Natalie had done something extraordinary. Something that is pretty much impossible ... to become a professional ballerina in a year and half&quot; (Katrandjian 1).

== Environment ==
In 2010, the Canadian government was accused of &quot;hiding the truth&quot; of global warming and cutting much needed funds to research and development programs. Graham Saul of Climate Action Network of Canada said, &quot;This government says they take climate change seriously but they do nothing and try to hide the truth about climate change.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated that 300,000 people die each year and 125 billion dollars are lost a year to gradual climate change caused by global warming. However, internal government documents showed that media coverage regarding global warming had been cut by 80 percent, and strict rules and regulations blocked scientists from talking to reporters. Several science research bases across Canada ran out of government funding and were forced to shut down. Funding for the Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmosphere Sciences, which researched the melting of polar ice and frequency of Arctic storms, was also drying up. Many climatology researchers across the globe believed that Canada is falling behind in climate science and because of this the world is not getting any information about what is happening in the Canadian Arctic. The Canadian government has admitted to eliminating government-funded climate research so there won&#x27;t be any &quot;bad news&quot; about what is happening.

==Social networking==
Social networking currently provides more information and features than original function of allowing individuals to connect with their peers. Social networking sites have a large amount of data and records from billions of people, and construct recommendations used by enterprises, small business, and individuals. For example, Facebook has a recommendation system that allows users to indicate what &quot;news articles, companies and celebrities they &#x27;like and &quot;shares data about those preferences with its Web partners&quot;, so &quot;when a Facebook user visits a Web site like Yelp or TripAdvisor, they are shown reviews from friends before they get to those from strangers.&quot;

Companies also use social networking to investigate candidates and employees. The results obtained from a potential employee&#x27;s immediate social network are often more relevant, significant, and factual than what the candidate presents about themselves during an interview. Therefore, it is necessary to manage how one wants to be perceived on one&#x27;s social network.

Mauldin served as executive producer for albums including &quot;JE Heartbreak II&quot; by Jagged Edge, &quot;Timeless&quot;, &quot;Uncovered/Covered&quot;, and &quot;Things That Lovers Do&quot; by Kenny Lattimore &amp; Chante&#x27; Moore, &quot;Comin&#x27; from Where I&#x27;m From: Live &amp; More&quot; by Anthony Hamilton, &quot;Beware of Dog (album)&quot;, &quot;Doggy Bag&quot;, and &quot;Heartthrobs Live&quot; by Bow Wow, &quot;Jump/Lil Boys in Da Hood&quot; by Kris Kross, Off the Hook by Xscape, &quot;12 Soulful Nights of Christmas&quot;, and &quot;Like Mike (soundtrack)&quot;. 

As President of Columbia Records, Mauldin directed the early careers of &quot;Destiny&#x27;s Child&quot; (adding &quot;Child&quot; to be used in their stage name) and &quot;Alicia Keys&quot; (adding &quot;Keys&quot; to Alicia&#x27;s stage name). Mauldin oversaw numerous multi-platinum releases from artists including Maxwell, Fugees, Lauryn Hill, Wyclef Jean, Nas, Men In Black soundtrack, Love Jones soundtrack and more.

In 2020, he served as an executive producer for &quot;Amplified&quot;; a digital entertainment show addressing the state of Black American Music; its foundation, preservation and innovation. And maneges two-time Grammy Award winner Arrested Development. Which means managing SPEECH and HEADLINER and working with Aerle Taree of the group. Arrested Development tv show with Ron Howard name is owned by his client SPEECH and his cousin Aerle Taree wrote PoeTaree The Jurisprudence of Life via Universal Music Publishing Group. Through Universal Music Publishing Group Aerle Taree published the tracks for Doja Cat planet her album while SPEECH created it as Eshe was the choreographer.

He is also the Managing Director for 2475 AtVille Entertainment, the owner of Air Control Music publishing, and the founder of Scream Nation, a concert tour launched in 2013 as a joint venture with Live Nation, which is known for its &quot;Scream Tour.&quot;

<doc id="509654" wikidata="Q24788421" url="?curid=509654" title="Flagellin">
<text>Flagellins are a family of proteins present in flagellated bacteria which arrange themselves in a hollow cylinder to form the filament in a bacterial flagellum. Flagellin has a mass on average of about 40,000 daltons. Flagellins are the principal component of bacterial flagella that have a crucial role in bacterial motility.

The gene that encodes for flagellin has a different name in different bacterial species such as &quot;flaA&quot; (&quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; for example), &quot;fliC&quot;, &quot;fljB&quot;.

== Structure ==

The structure of flagellin is responsible for the helical shape of the flagellar filament, which is important for its proper function. It is transported through the center of the filament to the tip where it polymerases spontaneously into a part of the filament. In &quot;E. coli&quot; it is unfolded by the flagellar secretion chaperone FliS () during transport. The filament is made up of eleven smaller &quot;protofilaments&quot;, nine of which contains flagellin in the L-type shape and the other two in the R-type shape.

The helical N- and C-termini of flagellin form the inner core of the flagellin protein, and is responsible for flagellin&#x27;s ability to polymerize into a filament. The middle residues make up the outer surface of the flagellar filament. While the termini of the protein are quite similar among all bacterial flagellins, the middle portion is wildly variable and can be absent in some species. The flagellin domains are numbered from the helical core (D0/D1) to the outside (D2, ...); when viewed from the amino-acid sequence, D0/D1 appears on the two termini. Flagellin-like structural proteins are found in other portions of the flagellum, such as the hook (flgE; ), the rod at the base, and the cap at the top.

The middle part of  &quot;E. coli&quot; (and related) flagellin, D3, displays a beta-folium fold and appears to maintain flagellar stability.

== Immune response ==

=== In mammals ===
Mammals often have acquired immune responses (T-cell and antibody responses) to flagellated bacterium, which occur frequently to flagellar antigens. Flagellin has also been shown to directly interact with TLR5 on T cells and TLR11. Some bacteria are able to switch between multiple flagellin genes in order to evade this response.

Flagellins contain a Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) epitope, a region recognized by the immune receptor TLR5. There are variations in the strength of flagellin binding and its ability to activate TLR5. Flagellins can be classified into three groups based on these characteristics: silent flagellins, evaders and stimulators. Silent flagellins bind to TLR5 but do not induce signaling. Evaders are incapable of binding and, consequently, do not trigger TLR5 activation. Stimulators exhibit variable binding capabilities to TLR5 yet possess the ability to activate TLR5.

The propensity of the immune response to flagellin may be explained by two facts:

* Flagellin is an extremely abundant protein in flagellated bacteria. 
* There exists a specific innate immune receptor that recognizes flagellin, Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5).

=== In plants ===
In addition, a 22-amino acid sequence (flg22) of the conserved N-terminal part of flagellin is known to activate plant defence mechanisms. Flagellin perception in &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; functions via the receptor-like-kinase FLS2 (FLAGELLIN SENSING 2). Upon flg22 detection, FLS2 quickly binds to BAK1 (BRI1-associated kinase 1) to initiate signalling by reciprocal transphosphorylation of their kinase domains. Both flagellin and UV-C act similarly to increase homologous recombination, as demonstrated by Molinier et al 2006. Beyond this somatic effect, they found this to extend to subsequent generations of the plant. Mitogen-activated-protein-kinases (MAPK) acts as downstream signalling compounds, leading ultimately to PAMP-triggered immunity in which more than 900 genes are up-/down-regulated upon flg22 treatment.

Pre-stimulation with a synthetic flg22-peptide led to enhanced resistance against bacterial invaders.

<doc id="509661" wikidata="Q419493" url="?curid=509661" title="Thermogenin">
<text>Thermogenin (called uncoupling protein by its discoverers and now known as uncoupling protein 1, or UCP1) is a mitochondrial carrier protein found in brown adipose tissue (BAT). It is used to generate heat by non-shivering thermogenesis, and makes a quantitatively important contribution to countering heat loss in babies which would otherwise occur due to their high surface area-volume ratio.

==Mechanism==

UCP1 belongs to the UCP family which are transmembrane proteins that decrease the proton gradient generated in oxidative phosphorylation. They do this by increasing the permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane, allowing protons that have been pumped into the intermembrane space to return to the mitochondrial matrix and hence dissipating the proton gradient. UCP1-mediated heat generation in brown fat uncouples the respiratory chain, allowing for fast substrate oxidation with a low rate of ATP production. UCP1 is related to other mitochondrial metabolite transporters such as the adenine nucleotide translocator, a proton channel in the mitochondrial inner membrane that permits the translocation of protons from the mitochondrial intermembrane space to the mitochondrial matrix. UCP1 is restricted to brown adipose tissue, where it provides a mechanism for the enormous heat-generating capacity of the tissue.

UCP1 is activated in the brown fat cell by fatty acids and inhibited by nucleotides. Fatty acids are released by the following signaling cascade: Sympathetic nervous system terminals release Norepinephrine onto a Beta-3 adrenergic receptor on the plasma membrane. This activates adenylyl cyclase, which catalyses the conversion of ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP). cAMP activates protein kinase A, causing its active C subunits to be freed from its regulatory R subunits. Active protein kinase A, in turn, phosphorylates triacylglycerol lipase, thereby activating it. The lipase converts triacylglycerols into free fatty acids, which activate UCP1, overriding the inhibition caused by purine nucleotides (GDP and ADP). During the termination of thermogenesis, thermogenin is inactivated and residual fatty acids are disposed of through oxidation, allowing the cell to resume its normal energy-conserving state.
UCP1 is very similar to the ATP/ADP Carrier protein, or Adenine Nucleotide Translocator (ANT). The proposed alternating access model for UCP1 is based on the similar ANT mechanism. The substrate comes in to the half open UCP1 protein from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, the protein closes the cytoplasmic side so the substrate is enclosed in the protein, and then the matrix side of the protein opens, allowing the substrate to be released into the mitochondrial matrix. The opening and closing of the protein is accomplished by the tightening and loosening of salt bridges at the membrane surface of the protein. Substantiation for this modelling of UCP1 on ANT is found in the many conserved residues between the two proteins that are actively involved in the transportation of substrate across the membrane. Both proteins are integral membrane proteins, localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane, and they have a similar pattern of salt bridges, proline residues, and hydrophobic or aromatic amino acids that can close or open when in the cytoplasmic or matrix state.

==Structure==

The atomic structure of human uncoupling protein 1 UCP1 has been solved by cryogenic-electron microscopy. The structure has the typical fold of a member of the SLC25 family. UCP1 is locked in a cytoplasmic-open state by guanosine triphosphate in a pH-dependent manner, preventing proton leak. 

==Evolution==
UCP1 is expressed in brown adipose tissue, which is functionally found only in eutherians. The UCP1, or thermogenin, gene likely arose in an ancestor of modern vertebrates, but did not initially allow for our vertebrate ancestor to use non-shivering thermogenesis for warmth. It wasn&#x27;t until heat generation was adaptively selected for in placental mammal descendants of this common ancestor that UCP1 evolved its current function in brown adipose tissue to provide additional warmth. While UCP1 plays a key thermogenic role in wide range placental mammals, particularly those with small body size and those that hibernate, the UCP1 gene has lost functionality in several large-bodied lineages (e.g. horses, elephants, sea cows, whales and hyraxes) and lineages with low metabolic rates (e.g. pangolins, armadillos, sloths and anteaters). Recent discoveries of non-heat-generating orthologues of UCP1 in fish and marsupials, other descendants of the ancestor of modern vertebrates, show that this gene was passed on to all modern vertebrates, but aside from placental mammals, none have heat producing capability. This further suggests that UCP1 had a different original purpose and in fact phylogenetic and sequence analyses indicate that UCP1 is likely a mutated form of a dicarboxylate carrier protein that adapted for thermogenesis in placental mammals.

==History==
Researchers in the 1960s investigating brown adipose tissue, found that in addition to producing more heat than typical of other tissues, brown adipose tissue seemed to short circuit, or uncouple, respiration coupling. Uncoupling protein 1 was discovered in 1976 by David G. Nicholls, Vibeke Bernson, and Gillian Heaton, and the discovery was published in 1978 and shown to be the protein responsible for this uncoupling effect. UCP1 was later purified for the first time in 1980 and was first cloned in 1988.

Uncoupling protein two (UCP2), a homolog of UCP1, was identified in 1997. UCP2 localizes to a wide variety of tissues, and is thought to be involved in regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS). In the past decade, three additional homologs of UCP1 have been identified, including UCP3, UCP4, and UCP5 (also known as BMCP1 or SLC25A14).

== Clinical relevance ==
Methods of delivering UCP1 to cells by gene transfer therapy or methods of its upregulation have been an important line of enquiry in research into the treatment of obesity, due to their ability to dissipate excess metabolic stores.

<text>Sinbad of the Seven Seas is a 1989 Italian fantasy film produced and directed by Enzo G. Castellari from a story by Luigi Cozzi, revolving around the adventures of Sinbad the Sailor. Sinbad must recover five magical stones to free the city of Basra from the evil spell cast by a wizard, which his journey takes him to mysterious islands and he must battle magical creatures in order to save the world.

==Plot==
The film is narrated by a mother who tells her daughter a bedtime story from a large book: In the city of Basra, the evil vizier Jaffar has clouded the caliph&#x27;s mind and imprisoned his daughter, Princess Alina in order to marry her. Jaffar has four of the town&#x27;s five sacred gems sent to dangerous and evil places where they will be carefully guarded by magical forces. Sinbad and his crew arrive at the caliph&#x27;s palace, only to be captured by the hypnotised soldiers. Jaffar sentences Sinbad&#x27;s crew to the torture chamber while the mighty sailor is to be locked in a pit full of snakes. Sinbad gets out of the snake pit using some snakes tied together into a rope and later rescues his companions from the torture chamber. As they flee the controlled Basra, Jaffar grants power from evil forces to help him kill Sinbad, this summons an evil cloud over Sinbad&#x27;s ship and the Legions of Darkness, undead warriors. Together with the help of his friends, Sinbad manages to defeat the undead and the leader.

Sinbad then heads to a mysterious island to seek the help of a wise Oracle, who tells them the location of the four sacred gems of Basra. Then, he sails to an island and finds the gem by himself, he destroys a towering rock monster and retrieves the gem. Jaffar is joined by another ally, Soukra, a sorceress, and they prepare Jaffar&#x27;s scheming plan. The second gem is on the island of the Amazons, the Amazons hypnotise Sinbad&#x27;s crew and their leader, Queen Farida takes Sinbad with her. The Bald Cook and Poochie the dwarf save Sinbad, and he retrieves the second gem, the Queen&#x27;s necklace. Next, Sinbad and his team head to the Isle of the Dead, where they battle Ghost Knights who have risen from the dead to fulfill their destiny. Sinbad goes for the Ghost King while his companions battle the Knights. Jaffar casts Sinbad&#x27;s ship and his crew in the middle of the sea, leaving the sailor alone on the Isle of the Dead. Jaffar gives life to the Ghost King using his evil powers, and it weakens Sinbad, but he resists and destroys the Ghost King with his own sword and takes the third sacred gem.

Later, Sinbad meets Kira, and her father, Nadir the wizard, two survivors on the Isle of the Dead who came there on a flying balloon. Sinbad agrees to help them get rid of the vicious monsters of the island and is aided by Kira, they encounter a group of ghouls, Sinbad fights them, but they capture Kira. Sinbad rescues Kira, but has to face a terrible monster known as the Lord of Darkness, which is able to fire bolts of energy from its wrists guarding the last sacred gem of Basra, Sinbad defeats the evil creature with the gems he has and retrieves the last one and they, along with Nadir, escape the island on a balloon.

Sinbad meets up with his companions and they go off to face Jaffar, Sinbad&#x27;s men face off with the soldiers while Sinbad battles Jaffar. The wizard creates an exact Sinbad clone to battle the sailor, but he manages to defeat it. Eventually, Jaffar is captured by Sinbad and Princess Alina is rescued. Peace has been restored to the world with the sacred gems.

==Cast==
==Production==

&quot;Sinbad of the Seven Seas&quot; claims to be based on Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s story &quot;The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Scheherazade,&quot; though no similarity can be found between its plot and the story. It borrows some elements and characters from the 1940 version of &quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot;. The film was made with a largely Italian cast and crew. Like most Italian movies of the era, it was filmed on location without sound equipment and all dialogue and sound effects were dubbed later.

Screenwriter Luigi Cozzi was originally going to direct the film back in 1986 but he was replaced at the last minute by the producers with Enzo G. Castellari. Castellari changed Cozzi&#x27;s script drastically and several million dollars later, wound up submitting three hours of non-releasable footage to the producer, who shelved the whole project. In 1989, Cozzi was hired back to try to fix up the picture via re-editing and shooting additional scenes, the producer spending an additional half million dollars finishing it.

==Reception and legacy==
The film&#x27;s low production values, over-the-top acting, and inept plot have made it a cult favorite among those who enjoy bad cinema for its unintentional humor. Lou Ferrigno has stated during an interview that &quot;Sinbad of the Seven Seas&quot; was one of his favourite films he made.

The film is listed in Golden Raspberry Award founder John Wilson&#x27;s book &quot;The Official Razzie Movie Guide&quot; as one of The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made.

<text>Tea Tree Gully (TTG) is a suburb in the greater Adelaide, South Australia area, under the City of Tea Tree Gully. Tea Tree Gully is in the City of Tea Tree Gully local government area, the South Australian House of Assembly electoral district of Newland and the Australian House of Representatives Division of Makin.

==History==
The suburb acquired its name from the white flowered &#x27;tea trees&#x27; (&quot;Leptospermum lanigerum&quot;) that grew in the gully. Their leaves were brewed as a tea substitute by early settlers. John Stevens originally purchased land in the area, subdividing it in 1850 and naming the settlement &quot;Steventon&quot;. By 1867 the settlement was known variously as Tea Tree Gully or Steventon, but Steventon had dropped from common usage by 1900. It was also sometimes known as &quot;Teatree Gully&quot;.

&quot;Steventon&quot; Post Office opened around January 1859, was renamed &quot;Tea Tree Gully&quot; in 1872, &quot;Teatree Gully&quot; in 1925, &quot;Tea Tree Gully&quot; again in 1966 and St Agnes in 1969.

The gully is a notable one, as it provided a gradient negotiable by bullock wagons travelling through the Mount Lofty Ranges and it had permanent springs which promoted the growth of tea tree.

The historic Highercombe Hotel in Perseverance Road and the Old Tea Tree Gully Council Chambers in Haines Road are listed on the South Australian Heritage Register.

===Highercombe Hotel===

The Highercombe Hotel was built in 1854. Its first licensee was William Haines, who served as District Clerk of Tea Tree Gully council for 37 years and Member of Parliament for 6 years. The State Government purchased the building in 1879 and it was used from 1880 to 1963 as a post and telegraph office. During this period part of the building was used as a school classroom, and accommodation for Headmasters&#x27; and the Postmasters&#x27; families. From 1963 to 1967 the Tea Tree Gully Council used it as an office and library. The National Trust took over the building in 1967 and their Tea Tree Gully branch restored it and converted it to a heritage museum.
