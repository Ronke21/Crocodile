<text>Sonic the Hedgehog is an American comic book series published by Archie Comics, in partnership with Sega. Although this continuity was based on Sega&#x27;s video game franchise, its nature had much more in common with the American 1993 animated series of the same name. After initially beginning with a four-issue miniseries from February to May 1993 (with issues appearing on newsstands three months earlier), the first full-length issue of the comic was published in July 1993. The series ran for 290 issues for over 20 years, earning a place in the 2008 &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; for being the &quot;longest-running comic series based on a video game&quot; in U.S. history. It became the longest-running franchise-based comic series in 2015 (surpassing Marvel Comics&#x27; 275 issues of &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot;) before it was confirmed cancelled in July 2017, following Sega and Archie Comics&#x27; decision to discontinue their business relationship. The series features a cast of hundreds of characters, consisting of both those derived from the &quot;Sonic&quot; games and those original to the comics, with stories focused on a crime-fighting organization called the Freedom Fighters, led by Sonic, as they face off against series antagonist Doctor Eggman alongside a variety of other villains.

While the series largely consists of its own continuity, certain issues implemented aspects of the &quot;Sonic&quot; video games into their plots and settings. Following a lawsuit in 2013 between Archie Comics and former writer Ken Penders, Archie rebooted the series, removing several characters from the comics&#x27; continuity and moving it closer to that of the Japanese games and media. Over its history, the series had a number of spin-off publications being created. These include &quot;Sonic Universe&quot;, which focuses on stories revolving around different side characters from the main series; &quot;Knuckles the Echidna&quot;, focusing on adventures involving Knuckles and his friends the Chaotix; &quot;Sonic X&quot;, a comic series based on the 2003 Japanese anime of the same name; and &quot;Sonic Boom&quot;, a comic series based on both the cartoon series and the video game series of the same name. In addition, the comic series had crossovers with Image Comics character Spawn, and Archie&#x27;s &quot;Mega Man&quot; comic-book series, based on the Mega Man video games from Capcom.

A succeeding series of &quot;Sonic&quot; comics by IDW Publishing began serialization from April 2018, following IDW&#x27;s acquisition of the &quot;SEGA&quot; license through SEGA of America. Ian Flynn, who formerly worked on the Archie series, was recruited by IDW to help with producing stories for the new series.

==Publication history==
The &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; comic debuted in the US as a four-part miniseries running from February to May 1993. The first issue (#0) was previewed in a free six-page &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; #¼, released November 1992. The miniseries was followed up two months later by the series &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; (July 1993 – December 2016). Numerous one-shot specials and several reprint series&#x27; followed.

==Synopsis==
The comics follow the adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog and his friends, called the Freedom Fighters, who battle against the evil Doctor Robotnik. Initially based on the plot of the 1993 animated series, the comic later incorporated elements from the games and other media. When Ken Penders, former head writer of the comic got sued by Archie Comics because he allegedly breached his contract with them, the comic led to a continuity reboot with all established characters created by Penders and other writers being removed, save those of current writer Ian Flynn, who penned the new continuity, and those created for assorted animated series, to which Sega retains the rights. The new continuity is a world much closer to the world depicted in Sega&#x27;s games.

The original universe, which remained canon until the comic&#x27;s 247th issue, is set on the planet Mobius, an alternate version of Earth where animals were mutated into the anthropomorphic Mobians. Dr. Robotnik is depicted as a tyrant, ruling from Robotropolis, following a coup d&#x27;état against the Kingdom of Acorn. A small band of heroes, the Freedom Fighters, fight back against his forces from the secluded village of Knothole. Amongst the group are Sonic, his best friend Miles &quot;Tails&quot; Prower, love interest and team leader Princess Sally Acorn, French-accented Antoine D’Coolette, cybernetic Bunnie Rabbot, technician Rotor the Walrus, and Sally&#x27;s handheld computer Nicole. Other allies like Knuckles the Echidna, Amy Rose, and Sonic&#x27;s Uncle Chuck join them in later chapters. Robotnik in turn is aided by his nephew Snively.

Robotnik meets his demise in the fiftieth issue, erased from existence by his own superweapon. An alternate version of Robotnik from a parallel world becomes the lead antagonist, first introduced as &quot;Robo-Robotnik&quot;, but later takes on the name of Dr. Eggman. New antagonists were introduced, including the evil sorcerer Ixis Naugus; Scourge the Hedgehog, Sonic&#x27;s evil counterpart from a parallel universe; and the Dark Egg Legion, a union of other factions like the Iron Dominion and the echidna-led Dark Legion. Game storylines like &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; and &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot; were adapted, introducing Shadow the Hedgehog as a recurring character.

The Xorda, an extraterrestrial race whose past actions led to the creation of Mobius and evolved anthropomorphic animals, try to destroy the planet. Sonic defeats them, only to end up lost in space, but returns home a year later. Sally&#x27;s father, King Maximillian, is poisoned by Antoine&#x27;s evil counterpart, Patch, and hands the throne over to his son Prince Elias. For a brief time, Snively defects to the Freedom Fighters only to betray them, bombing Knothole with the Egg Fleet. The citizens are imprisoned in the Egg Grapes, but Sonic frees them. Nicole uses nanites to create New Mobotropolis. Tails’ father Amadeus tries to bring democracy to the city against the monarchy, Sally preventing a civil war by establishing the Council of Acorn, consisting of royal and public officials.

Eggman suffers a massive mental breakdown due to Sonic foiling his plans for world domination one too many times and is temporarily institutionalized, allowing Snively and the Iron Queen, Regina Ferrum, to take over his empire in the interim, leading to a lengthy war against the Freedom Fighters. Naugus comes to rule New Mobotropolis as king, due to a deal Sally&#x27;s father made with him. Eggman returns to power and sanity, unleashing the Genesis Wave, altering Mobius, but Sonic reverses it. Sally sacrifices herself to stop Eggman&#x27;s superweapon, the World Roboticizer, and becomes a robot. The Freedom Fighters reform as Team Freedom, Team Fighters, and the Secret Freedom Fighters to combat Eggman and Naugus.

Eggman activates a second Genesis Wave, transporting himself, Sonic, and other characters into the world of Mega Man, leading to the crossover &quot;Worlds Collide&quot;. A second crossover &quot;Worlds Unite&quot; happened in 2015, featuring characters from other Sega and Capcom titles.

The original multiverse ceased to exist when Dr. Eggman launched the Super Genesis Wave in conjunction with Dr. Wily, causing the Prime Zone (Sonic&#x27;s World Dimension) to be irreversibly rewritten and the multiverse surrounding it to collapse in on itself, destroying every prior known reality (with the exception of the Special Zone and the Sol Zone, Blaze&#x27;s World Dimension, the latter due to the Jeweled Scepter) and creating new ones in their place.

In the new continuity, Sonic and Dr. Eggman retain their memories of everything they both knew before the Super Genesis Wave, which are later restored onto Nagus, Tails, Rotor, Antoine, Bunnie, Sally and Amy when they make contact with Nicole. However, Earth is split apart, awakening Dark Gaia, leading to the events of &quot;Sonic Unleashed&quot;. The comic also introduces Naugus&#x27; sister Wendy, a witch who pledges allegiance to Eggman and plots to gain the Cacophonic Conch.

==Spin-offs and other related series==
The series was originally published as a four issue mini-series, with the first issue labeled as &quot;issue 0&quot;. At the end of the fourth issue of the series, it was announced that &quot;Sonic&quot; would return in a regular series, and the next issue was published as &quot;issue 1&quot; of the regular series.

Alongside the main Sonic series, Archie Comics published various special issues. Longer than typical issues of the comic, these specials feature stories involving Sonic and other related characters. Several miniseries have also been published, featuring characters such as Sally Acorn, Tails and Knuckles.

Because of the popularity of the specials and Miniseries featuring Knuckles, in 1997, &quot;Knuckles the Echidna&quot; became an ongoing series. Knuckles&#x27; stories featured its own cast of characters, including the Chaotix. In 2000, the series was cancelled, but the stories were continued in the pages of &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; until it was phased out completely by &quot;Sonic&quot; issue 125. In this form, a typical issue of &quot;Sonic&quot; included a Sonic story and a second, shorter Knuckles story afterwards, though eventually this phased out as well.

To allow for stories that focused more on side characters than primarily on Sonic-most notably the other characters featured in the Sega games-the &quot;Sonic Universe&quot; comic line was introduced. This series has included a wide range of characters previously introduced in other comic issues, as well as allowing for the introduction of additional characters to the comic cast. Typically, the series is broken up into four-issue long story arcs focusing on a select character or group of characters, though one-issue stories have also been released.

Archie has also produced two Sonic series based on other branches of the Sonic franchise, namely the &quot;Sonic X&quot; anime and the &quot;Sonic Boom&quot; cartoon. The &quot;Sonic X&quot; series began in September 2005, and ended after forty issues in January 2009, the last of which featured a crossover story with the main &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series that served as a prequel to the first &quot;Sonic Universe&quot; issue. The &quot;Sonic Boom&quot; line began in October 2014, and was later incorporated into &quot;Worlds Unite&quot; before concluding with its eleventh issue in September 2015.

The Archie Sonic series has also produced several Free Comic Book Day issues, which typically feature either reprints of older issues or new stories that fit into the series continuity. Since 2013, these issues have served as a combination free comic special with the Mega Man series; a free Sonic issue serving as a prequel to &quot;Sonic Lost World&quot; was also released in 2013 for Halloween Comic Fest. Various compilations have also been put together, such as the &quot;Sonic Saga Series, Sonic Archives&quot; and &quot;Knuckles Archives, Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic Universe&quot; and standalone graphic novels, &quot;Sonic Legacy, Best of Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic Super Digest&quot; and &quot;Sonic Super Special Magazine.&quot; Following &quot;Worlds Collide&quot; the latter two series and the Free Comic Book Day issues began featuring stories in a series entitled &quot;Sonic Comic Origins&quot;, which detailed the histories of various characters in the post-reboot continuity.

A short, three-panel comic strip similar to those found in a newspaper at the end of some issues called &quot;Off-Panel&quot;. It was originally found in the main series of comics, and was later continued in the spinoff series &quot;Sonic Universe&quot;. Earlier strips involved fictional version of staff interacting with comic characters. While later strips removed this element, it always retains elements of comical gags relating to the issues main story, often containing fourth wall breaking.

==Characters==
The comic book has had a large cast of characters, primarily originating from the video games, the 1993 animated series, and other media. A number of characters were created by various writers including Ken Penders, Ian Flynn, Michael Gallagher, Karl Bollers, Scott Fulop, and Dan Slott. Following Archie Comics&#x27; lawsuit against former writer Ken Penders, the continuity of the comic was rebooted into a new timeline, removing most of the characters created by previous writers, save Flynn. Due to the large cast, only major and recurring characters are included in this section.

===Freedom Fighters===
The central protagonists of the comic, the Freedom Fighters are a resistance movement who battle against Dr. Eggman and various other antagonists for the freedom of their planet. The main faction are the Knothole Freedom Fighters, led by Sonic the Hedgehog and Princess Sally Acorn, who operate from the village of Knothole in the Great Forest.

* Sonic the Hedgehog: The main protagonist, a blue hedgehog capable of running at supersonic speeds. The leader of the Knothole Freedom Fighters, Sonic and his friends fight to protect their home from Dr. Eggman and other antagonists. He is characterized as being naturally heroic, cocky, free-spirited, loyal to his friends, and enjoys eating chili dogs. In the original continuity, he was the son of Jules and Bernadette Hedgehog, who were both roboticized. He is viewed as a legendary figure in his home dimension, and throughout the multiverse. In the &quot;Mobius: X Years Later&quot; arc, set in an alternate future, Sonic became King of Mobius, married to his love interest Sally Acorn, and had two children named Sonia and Manik (sharing their names with Sonic&#x27;s siblings in &quot;Sonic Underground&quot;). Sonic has shown an ability to transform into super forms, like Super Sonic, when using the power of the Chaos Emeralds and other magical devices.
* Princess Sally Acorn: A 16-year-old chipmunk who is the co-leader of the Freedom Fighters. She was Sonic&#x27;s main love interest in the old continuity. Sally is a mature, firm, kind, and tomboyish character. Taken to Knothole as a child during Dr. Robotnik&#x27;s coup d&#x27;état, she grew up to lead the Freedom Fighters against the Eggman Empire. In the original continuity, she was daughter of King Maximillian and Queen Alicia, and had an older brother, Prince Elias, who ascended the throne after her father&#x27;s abdication. Sally had an on-and-off relationship with Sonic, but also had romances with Geoffrey St. John and Monkey Khan. Sally sacrificed herself to protect the world from Eggman&#x27;s World Roboticizer, and was transformed into Mecha Sally. Following the second Genesis Wave, that created a new continuity, Sally is now the sole heir of King Nigel Acorn, and was never roboticized, regaining her memories of the original timeline. Due to the legal settlement after discharging Ken Penders from the ACP’s premises, the relationship between her and Sonic has explicitly changed as the two are now just friends.
* Miles &quot;Tails&quot; Prower: A young, technologically gifted, twin-tailed fox who is Sonic&#x27;s best friend. At first a supporting character, Tails later became a prominent member of the Freedom Fighters. He was the child of Amadeus and Rosemary Prower, two key figures in the Kingdom of Acorn&#x27;s government, but both were roboticized, and later rescued by the extraterrestrial species, the Bem. When Tails’ parents attempted to ignite a revolution against the Acorn monarchy, it put Tails in conflict with Sonic until the Republic of Acorn was formed thanks to Sally bringing peace. In &quot;Mobius: X Years Later&quot;, Tails married Mina Mongoose and had two children Melody and Skye. After the second Genesis Wave, Tails, regaining his memories of the first continuity, built the Sky Patrol aircraft and is aided by a robot named T-Pup.
* Bunnie Rabbot: An 18-year-old cyborg rabbit, Bunnie was partially roboticized as a child, though this was altered in the new continuity, where Uncle Chuck turned her into a cyborg to save her life from an injury. A courageous, good-natured character, Bunnie speaks with a Southern accent and has ambitions of being a hair stylist. Her mechanical limbs have had several abilities including extensions, rocket-powered flight, and could transform into weapons. In both continuities, Bunnie married Antoine D’Coolette. Her uncle, Beauregard &quot;The Baron&quot; Rabbot, was a member of Eggman&#x27;s Dark Egg Legion. In &quot;Mobius: X Years Later&quot;, Bunnie and Antoine had two children, Jacques and Belle.
* Antoine D&#x27;Coolette: A 19-year-old coyote who sports a French accent (starting with issue #10). Initially pompous and bumbling, Antoine hid behind a wall of bravado to hide his anxieties. He had a crush on Sally, but fell in love with and then married Bunnie. He is a skilled swordsman, and is shown to have developed his own take on Sonic&#x27;s signature Spin Dash manoeuvre. In the original continuity, his father was Armand D’Coolette, a former war general, who was roboticized and served as Dr. Robotnik&#x27;s High Sheriff in Mercia. He was restored to normal, but was later poisoned by Antoine&#x27;s evil counterpart Patch D&#x27;Coolette. Antoine was knocked into a coma after defending his friends from Metal Sonic, though in the rebooted continuity, his injury never occurred.
* Rotor the Walrus: A large, purple-coloured walrus, Rotor serves as the mechanic and inventor for the Freedom Fighters. Formerly nicknamed &quot;Boomer&quot;. Intelligent but laidback and a little lacking in self-confidence, Rotor acts as the muscle of the group. Though a main member of the Freedom Fighters, Rotor took an increasing backseat role as the comic continued, becoming a member of the Council of Acorn, but later become a member of Team Freedom alongside Cream the Rabbit, Big the Cat, and robots Heavy and Bomb. His spine was injured during the destruction of Knothole, leading him to wear a specially-designed suit that could help him in battle. In the rebooted continuity, he has gained a more muscular physique, and built the Sky Patrol with Tails. The reboot also introduced his estranged father Tundra the Walrus, who serves as one of Dr. Eggman&#x27;s sub-commanders. In 2009, &quot;The Sonic Stadium&quot; reported that Ken Penders had planned to reveal Rotor as gay in the &quot;Mobius: 25 Years Later&quot; storyline, but this idea was later dropped because of the gross underdevelopment of the character.
* Nicole: The artificial intelligence of Sally&#x27;s handheld computer who can appear as a holographic Mobian lynx. Nicole, at first, lacks a personality but developed one over the course of the comic. In the original continuity, Nicole was programmed by a version of Rotor from the future; while in the reboot, she was designed by scientist Dr. Ellidy, based on his deceased daughter Nikki. Nicole was given nanobots obtained from one of Dr. Eggman&#x27;s creations, allowing her to create and protect the city New Mobotropolis, making her a powerful character in the comic. However, she was brainwashed by the Iron Dominion and attacked the city, something that was later used by the newly crowned King Naugus to have her exiled. In the new continuity, Nicole regains her handheld form, and several characters who make physical contact with her regain their memories from the lost timeline.
* Amy Rose: A pre-teen hedgehog who has a long-standing crush on Sonic. Optimistic, cheerful, and tough, Amy began as a supporting character but evolved into a leading protagonist and a major member of the Freedom Fighters. Amy was introduced as a cousin to Rob O’the Hedge, being rather bratty, immature, and physically, had her character design as seen in &quot;Sonic CD&quot;. Wishing to become a Freedom Fighter, Amy used the magical Ring of Acorns to physically age herself, now resembling her modern appearance introduced in &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;. Amy wields the Pico Pico Hammer in battle, and occasionally, leads Team Rose, which consisted of herself, Cream the Rabbit, Big the Cat, and Blaze the Cat. She later joined Team Fighters alongside Sonic and Tails. Following the continuity reboot, Amy remains a member of the Knothole Freedom Fighters, regaining her memories of the original timeline by touching Nicole alongside Sally.
* Cream the Rabbit and Cheese the Chao: A young, six-year old rabbit and her Chao companion, Cream and Cheese lived an idyllic life with Cream&#x27;s mother Vanilla until Dr. Eggman invaded. Cream is sweet, kind, and considerate, befriending Amy Rose and the more volatile Blaze the Cat. They are members of Team Rose, and became a part of Team Freedom alongside Rotor, Big, and Chaotix members Heavy and Bomb.
* Big the Cat: A large, simple-minded fisherman cat who lives in the Mystic Ruins, accompanied by his best friend Froggy, who is a frog. Though a little dumb, Big is quite friendly, capable of using his great size and strength to aid the Freedom Fighters. He is a member of Team Rose, later Team Freedom, and then the Knothole Freedom Fighters following the second Genesis Wave.
* Dulcy the Dragon: A supporting member of the Freedom Fighters, Dulcy was one of the last Mobian dragons left unroboticized at the start of the comic&#x27;s story. She is ditzy, emotional, and clumsy, but loyal to her friends. Following the continuity reboot, Dulcy was given a new character design, and reimagined as a member of the Shijin Warriors in Yurashia.
*Lupe the Wolf: A Mobian wolf who is an ally to the Freedom Fighters, and a member of the reclusive Wolf Pack. A brave warrior, Lupe was inspired to oppose Dr. Eggman after meeting Sally, Sonic, and Antoine. In the original continuity, Lupe was chieftain of the Pack, leading them against the Eggman Empire, but when captured by a roboticized Uncle Chuck, she sacrificed herself to be his lone victim and spared her people from enslavement. This was later reversed by the Bem, and Lupe made peace with Chuck.
* Uncle Chuck: Sonic&#x27;s uncle, originally named Sir Charles Hedgehog and then Professor Charles the Hedgehog, Uncle Chuck played a key role in the rise of both Sonic and Dr. Eggman. The inventor of the original Roboticizer, Uncle Chuck designed it to heal people from life-threatening injuries, such as his brother Jules, only for the original Dr. Robotnik to steal the blueprints and use it to turn people into robotic slaves, known as Robians in the original continuity. Chuck evacuated the young Freedom Fighters during Robotnik&#x27;s coup d’état, later captured and roboticized himself. He was freed by Sonic&#x27;s efforts, becoming an ally to the Freedom Fighters as an inventor. Chuck is aided in the new continuity by Ben Muttski, who first existed as Sonic&#x27;s pet dog, before being reimagined as an anthropomorphic canine.

===Supporting protagonists===
* Knuckles the Echidna: An echidna who guards the floating Angel Island and the Master Emerald, Knuckles is a prominent character throughout the comic&#x27;s history, having his own spin-off comic that ran from 1997 to 1999. Knuckles is a single-minded character, focused on his duty protecting his home, but is stubborn, hot-headed, and gullible. His initial backstory differentiated from video game canonicity, the comic introduces a rich cast of characters, created by Ken Penders, most of whom were echidnas. Knuckles guarded the Master Emerald as taught to by his father Locke, but left occasionally to aid the Freedom Fighters and his own team, the Chaotix. He eventually gained a romantic interest, Julie-Su, and in &quot;Mobius: X Years Later&quot;, the couple has a daughter named Lara-Su, who would inherit her father&#x27;s role as guardian of Angel Island. In the new continuity, Knuckles is depicted as the last of his kind.
* Julie-Su (old continuity): Knuckles’ love interest prominently featured in the original continuity. A member of the Chaotix, Julie-Su was a tomboyish, tough character, just as stubborn and temperamental as Knuckles. Raised as a soldier of the echidna-based Dark Legion, Julie was abused by her half-sister Lien-Da, and eventually left to join Knuckles and the Chaotix. Julie-Su and all of the other echidnas were imprisoned in another dimension by Thrash the Tasmanian Devil, a writing decision introduced following Ken Penders’ lawsuit against Archie Comics, removing the character from the comic.
* Lara-Su (old continuity): The daughter of Knuckles and Julie-Su, Lara appeared in the &quot;Light Mobius&quot; timeline originating from &quot;Mobius: X Years Later&quot;. Lara wished to inherit her father&#x27;s role as guardian of the Master Emerald, though Knuckles at first refused her the role due to his own past upbringing. When the timeline was warped by Sonic to save the future, Lara fought to correct it by deposing Shadow the Hedgehog, who had become the new King of Mobius instead of Sonic. Lara eventually became the guardian of the Master Emerald, a role which lasted at least five years. An alternate version of Lara, named Jani-Ca, exists in the &quot;Dark Mobius&quot; timeline, leader of the Dark Freedom Fighters and sought to defeat Dark Enerjak, actually her father Knuckles, Lara then inheriting the mantle of Enerjak.
* The Chaotix: A group of Mobians formed by Knuckles to help the Freedom Fighters, but also work as a detective agency. The original line-up introduced in the comic consisted of Knuckles and Julie-Su; Vector the Crocodile, a detective who serves as the de facto leader; Espio the Chameleon, a quiet, focused ninja; the pacifistic traveller Mighty the Armadillo, and his best friend Ray the Flying Squirrel; hyperactive Charmy Bee, who was initially introduced as the runaway prince of the Golden Hive Colony; his girlfriend Saffron Bee; and the former Badniks, Heavy and Bomb. Julie-Su and Saffron were trapped into another dimension by Thrash the Devil, and following the continuity reboot, only Vector, Espio, and Charmy remain members of the Chaotix, though Knuckles, Mighty, and Ray have past connections to the group.
* Shadow the Hedgehog: A black and red hedgehog, Shadow is an immortal created through Project Shadow, created by Professor Gerald Robotnik, Dr. Eggman&#x27;s grandfather, and the evil alien Black Doom. Aloof, grumpy, and a lone wolf, Shadow&#x27;s backstory and role follow the plot introduced in &quot;Sonic Adventure 2&quot;. Shadow later became a recurring anti-hero, forming Team Dark alongside Rouge the Bat, E-123 Omega, and Hope Kintobor. Like Sonic, Shadow could transform into super forms using the Chaos Emeralds, such as Super Shadow. He has become a recurring protagonist in the &quot;Sonic Universe&quot; comic.
* Rouge the Bat: A bat who works as a secret agent for the United Federation and is a jewel thief. She is a member of Team Dark, and while good in nature, has had run-ins and allegiances to several antagonists such as Dr. Eggman. Flirtatious and cunning, Rouge maintains a love/hate relationship with Knuckles, but also has a close bond to Shadow and E-123 Omega.
* E-123 Omega: The third member of Team Dark, E-123 Omega was a robot designed by Dr. Eggman. In the old continuity, Omega tried to destroy the still alive E-102 Gamma only for Gamma to self destruct and upload his free will into him, Shadow the Hedgehog (who had been sent by G.U.N to recruit Gamma) then recruited Omega who then joined Team Dark. In the new continuity (which is more closer to the games) his story is just like that of his story from Sonic Heroes. He is a prideful, violent character with a love for destructive force, but remains loyal to his friends despite his chaotic nature.
* Hope Kintobor (old continuity): A human girl introduced in the original continuity, Hope was Dr. Eggman&#x27;s niece and Snively&#x27;s half-sister. She and her parents had travelled into space after the Great War to find a new home, but unlike other humans, referred to as Overlanders in the comics, Hope had no animosity towards Mobians. She eventually returned to Mobius, but her family were roboticized, and Hope was taken in by the Freedom Fighters. Hope reconciled with Snively, hoping he would turn over a new leaf, only for her brother to betray the Freedom Fighters and destroyed Knothole with the Egg Fleet. Hope left and eventually joined Team Dark as a support technician.
* Blaze the Cat: The princess of the Sol Dimension, Blaze is the guardian of the Sol Emeralds. Though she acts calm, collected, and reserved, Blaze has a short temper, which is emphasized by her destructive pyrokinesis. Her temper can make it difficult for her to think clearly, and she is distrustful towards others. Blaze has made several appearances in both the main series and the &quot;Sonic Universe&quot; spin-off. She has appeared as a member of Team Rose, being friends with Amy Rose and Cream.
* Silver the Hedgehog: A telekinetic hedgehog who lives two-hundred years in the future, Silver often travels back in time to avert threats that will affect his own world. Silver is driven by a strong sense of justice, but he is quite naïve, jumping to conclusions, and can be easily manipulated or fooled. In the original continuity, Silver went back in time to identify a supposed traitor in the Freedom Fighters whose betrayal would lead to the post-apocalyptic state of his own era. He misidentifies numerous characters as the traitor before learning Sally is the unintentional culprit upon her roboticization. When Naugus becomes King of New Mobotropolis, Silver is recruited into the Secret Freedom Fighters by spymaster Harvey Who, to quietly dismantle Naugus&#x27; regime. The other team members included Sally&#x27;s brother Elias, Leeta and Lyco Wolf, bad luck magnet Larry Lynx, and Shard, a reprogrammed model of Metallix the Metal Sonic. Following the continuity reboot, Silver&#x27;s future has altered and he combats the Genesis Portals, a side effect of Eggman&#x27;s Super Genesis Wave. He is aided by Gold the Tenrec, a telepathic member of the secretive Onyx council, and scientist Professor Von Schlemmer, based on a character introduced in &quot;Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;.
* King Acorn: Sally&#x27;s father and the King of Mobotropolis. The King&#x27;s personality, name, and character greatly differ before and after the continuity reboot. He was betrayed by Dr. Robotnik, his former adviser, and banished to the Special Zone alongside Naugus, who served as his court wizard. In the original continuity, he was King Maximillian Acorn, a troubled ruler whose experiences left him a shadow of his former self, further worsened when poisoned by Antoine&#x27;s evil counterpart Patch D’Coolette, leaving him wheelchair-bound. Following the second Genesis Wave, the King is reimagined as King Nigel Acorn, younger, jovial, and more considerate.
* Rob O&#x27;the Hedge (old continuity): A hedgehog based on Robin Hood, Rob was Amy Rose&#x27;s cousin and the King of Mercia, operating from Deerwood Forest. Leader of the Crazy Kritter Freedom Fighters, Rob was characterized with a &quot;ye olde&quot; English dialect and a charismatic personality. Like Robin Hood, he was a skilled archer, and worked as a representative of the downtrodden against Dr. Eggman&#x27;s forces. He married Mari-An, an echidna based on Maid Marian, and a son named Jon. Rob became King following the death of the original Dr. Robotnik, but went into hiding when Eggman&#x27;s forces targeted his son. He was replaced by Bow Sparrow, a character also heavily based on Robin Hood, leader of the Woodland Kingsmen.
* Geoffrey St. John (old continuity): A skunk who was a recurring member of the Freedom Fighters. Egotistical, self-righteous, and uncompromising, Geoffrey acted as a rival to Sonic, and a love interest towards Sally. He led the Rebel Underground against Dr. Robotnik, crossing paths with the Knothole Freedom Fighters, but became their ally until Robotnik&#x27;s defeat. He married Hershey the Cat, a long-time friend. He then led the Royal Secret Service on orders from Sally&#x27;s father King Acorn. Hershey disappeared while on a mission and was presumed dead. It was revealed that Geoffrey actually worked for Naugus as his apprentice, originally assigned to prepare the Kingdom of Acorn for Naugus’ rise to power as King, and he ensured his master&#x27;s succession to the throne occurred. However, upon seeing how evil Naugus was, Geoffrey tried to defect, only to be possessed by his master. As a creation of Ken Penders, Geoffrey was removed from the comic following the continuity reboot.
* Ken &quot;Monkey&quot; Khan (old continuity): A character heavily inspired by Sun Wukong, Monkey Khan was known as the &quot;King of the Free People&quot;, originating from the village Leung West. Captured by Dr. Robotnik and turned into a cyborg, Khan was sealed away for ten years when he proved to be uncontrollable. He was freed by Sally, and became an ally during the war against the Iron Dominion and their allies from the Dragon Kingdom. Being based on Sun Wukong, Khan fights with a quarterstaff and can summon a cloud for transport. He was also a rival of Sonic for Sally&#x27;s heart, but he stood down so she could mend her relationship with Sonic.
* Mina Mongoose (old continuity): A sixteen-year old musician and singer. Mina was gifted with the ability of super speed by Mammoth Mogul. Her mother Isabella was roboticized, but later freed and served on the Council of Acorn. Initially quiet and shy, Mina became more outspoken as the comic went on. She fell in love with Sonic, spending more time with him, but backed off when she realized he loved Sally. She formed the rock band &quot;Knothole Knuts&quot;, and later, the &quot;Forget-Me-Knots&quot;, named after Knothole following its destruction. She formed a romantic relationship with band manager Ash Mongoose. In &quot;Mobius: X Years Later&quot;, Mina was shown to have married Tails and had two children named Melody and Skye. Mina quietly fades from existence in the second Genesis Wave as Tails regained his memories of the original timeline.
* Nathaniel &quot;Nate&quot; Beauregard Morgan (old continuity): A black Overlander geochemist, Nate is named after a character mentioned in the production bible of the 1993 animated series. He had a long complex history with Dr. Robotnik, exiled from his homeland after an experiment was sabotaged by the latter. He invented the Power Rings, creating the Lake of Rings in what would become Knothole. He became a friend to Sally&#x27;s grandfather King Frederic, but went into self-exile when Naugus, fearful that technology would replace his influential magic, framed Nate as an Overlander spy. Nate lived in a mountainside castle, accompanied by Eddie the Yeti, a cybernetic mutate. He became an ally to the Freedom Fighters during their battles with Dr. Eggman and Naugus. He aided in the rescue of his people, only to be roboticized by Eggman, and later perished when Robotropolis was destroyed by a nuclear weapon. In the new continuity, a Mobian named Dr. Ellidy, a Mobian lynx, is inspired by Nate, designing the Power Rings and also Nicole, based on his late daughter Nikki.
* Tikal the Echidna: She is the spirit of an ancient Mobian echidna who long ago sealed herself and Chaos within the Master Emerald. The daughter of Knuckles Clan chief, Pachacamac, Tikal rejected her father&#x27;s warmongering ways to befriend Chaos and the Chao he protected. She is a devout pacifist and follows the teachings of her grandmother. Later, when Chaos was released by Dr. Eggman, she joined forces with Knuckles the Echidna and Sonic the Hedgehog to try and stop his rampage. After her success, Tikal returned to the Master Emerald with Chaos, though the two remained aware of evils afflicting their former home. (A history seen in both continuities and based on &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;.) Tikal and Chaos had emerged the shattered Master Emerald during the Super Genesis Wave. She came to the aid of Coral and Pearly to play the Mystic Melody to defeat the Dark Gaia minions.
* Chaos: A mutated Chao, which was responsible for all but wiping out the Knuckles Clan of echidnas. Imprisoned in the Master Emerald by Tikal, a girl from that tribe, Chaos remained trapped for centuries until he was released by the maniacal Dr. Eggman. After accumulating power from various Chaos Emeralds, he attacked Station Square only to be stopped by Super Sonic. Following this, Chaos and Tikal returned to their home within the Master Emerald. (A history seen in both continuities and based on &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot;.) Chaos and Tikal had emerged from the Master Emerald during the Super Genesis Wave. Chaos went down to Meropis to aid the defenders there, Sonic and Rotor and prevented the ocean from being drained and defeated the Dark Guardian.
* Razor the Shark (new continuity): A former pirate of the Pirates of the Setting Dawn who was rescued and was nursed back to health by Coral the Betta after being thrown overboard by some of his former crewmates, which included his sister Blade. He soon became Coral&#x27;s protector and the Eusebes Shrine defender after his rescue. He has a Chao companion named Crusher.
* Coral the Betta (new continuity): A young priestess of the Eusebes Temple who was chosen over Princess Undina, her childhood friend. At some point after she was chosen, she had to go through some training to officially become a priestess. She soon took Pearly in as her apprentice and trained her in the rites. During the Shattered World Crisis, she had lost her confidence since Queen Angelica and King Puff thought she had caused it. Tikal soon came to her and Pearly&#x27;s aid as soon as she was able to and proved she was the right priestess. She gained her confidence back as she was able to restore Aquarius and defeat the Dark Gaia minions. Queen Angelica and King Puff soon saw Coral as the right priestess after that.
* Pearly the Manta Ray (new continuity): A young priestess in training by Coral who also has a fear of Chao.
* Honey the Cat (new continuity): A sixteen-year old fashion designer, businesswoman, and CEO for her company, &quot;Honey Brand Clothing&quot;. She&#x27;s all about self promotion as seen in the Chaos Emerald Tournament. Yet unlike Breezie, she has good morals and is an ally of the Freedom Fighters. When something serious is at stake, she&#x27;s willing to step down to help. She competed in the Chaos Emerald Tournament only for self promotion. She&#x27;s an ally of the Freedom Fighters as she promised if she won, she&#x27;d give the Chaos Emerald to them. During the fight, she showed a devious side by taking out Tails by ambushing him using a multi-image trick in which he called her out for cheating. Later, she&#x27;s hired by Breezie to design uniforms for her robot employees. Honey takes this time to call her out for involving Metal Sonic and the Hooligans in the tournament for the sake of getting rich. Honey is a scrapped character from the game &quot;Sonic the Fighters&quot;, but was redesigned to simplify her complicated outfit. She is based on the character from &quot;Fighting Vipers&quot; with the same name.
* Relic the Pika (new continuity): An archaeologist and close friend of Knuckles the echidna. When she was able to explore Angel Island, she met Knuckles and convinced him to let her stay. Later, she discovered an ancient robot named Fixit who soon became her assistant.
* Professor &quot;Dillon&quot; Pickle (new continuity): An absent-minded professor from Spagonia, and a long-time friend to Charles Hedgehog. Pickle was kidnapped by Eggman following his research into the Gaia manuscripts, forcing the Freedom Fighters to mount a rescue operation. His research provides a path to save the Shattered World for good.
* Dr. Ellidy (new continuity): Nicole&#x27;s creator post-Genesis Wave. He has removed himself from normal society and lives by himself, using repurposed badniks for everyday chores.
* Master Moss (new continuity): A zen master sloth who, in the Post Genesis Wave universe, taught Mighty the Armadillo how to channel and hone his incredible strength. After Sonic&#x27;s Werehog form is unleashed, he helps the hedgehog learn how to control the dark transformation.
* Gemerl the Gizoid (new continuity): An ancient robot rebuilt by Eggman to serve as an enforcer, only to be re-reprogrammed by Tails into a bodyguard for Cream and Cheese. Introduced into the comic during the Worlds Unite crossover.
* Chip the Light Gaia (new continuity): He is an ancient spirit that restores the world whenever it shatters every ten thousandth year, the most recent time being the Shattered World Crisis. He is a close ally of the Freedom Fighters, Chaotix, Knuckles the Echidna, and Tikal the Echidna. His opposite counterpart is Dark Gaia.

===Antagonists===
* Doctor Eggman: The main antagonist of the series, Dr. Ivo Robotnik, nicknamed Dr. Eggman, wants to conquer the world under the banner of his Eggman Empire. He is a genius with an IQ of 300, commanding a vast army of robots. He often roboticizes his victims into mindless machines subservient to his will alone. Two versions of the character have existed in the comic. The first, formerly Julian Kintobor, based on the character&#x27;s incarnation from the 1993 animated series, was a power-hungry and misanthropic mad scientist who took over the Kingdom of Acorn after helping King Maximillian win the Great War against the Overlanders. Cruel, sadistic, but also insane, Robotnik grew obsessed with defeating his nemesis Sonic. He died in the comic&#x27;s fiftieth issue, vaporized by his weapon, the Ultimate Annihilator, its trajectory altered by his nephew Snively. The second character, introduced as &quot;Robo-Robotnik&quot;, hails from an alternate timeline where he roboticized himself. Following Dr. Robotnik&#x27;s death, his counterpart takes over his empire on Mobius Prime, adopting the alias as Dr. Eggman, physically capable of changing his robotic body. Following the continuity reboot, Eggman becomes the singular incarnation of the character, maintaining his memories of the original timeline.
* Snively: Dr. Eggman&#x27;s nephew and toady, Snively is a diminutive, bald, pointy-nosed human who helped his uncle overthrow King Acorn. However, he is often abused and mistreated by Eggman. Just as cunning and intelligent as Eggman, Snively is passive-aggressive and has a tendency to backstab his allies. Despite several attempts to defect or betray his uncle, Snively always returns to his side, destroying Knothole in one case. He became a member of the Iron Dominion, dating its leader Regina Ferrum. Following the Genesis Waves, Snively was reimagined as Dr. Julian Snively, now sporting glasses and a beard, works for G.U.N., and while unrelated to Eggman, he still assisted in his takeover of the Kingdom of Acorn.
* Metal Sonic: A robotic version of Sonic created by Dr. Eggman, Metallix has served as a recurring rival to Sonic and other characters throughout the comic. There have been several versions of the character. The original model, after being totally destroyed during an eruption of Mt. Mobius, leaving only its personality crystal which had gained free will after watching Sonic refuse to leave Tails behind, was reused by Uncle Chuck to create Shard, a member of the Secret Freedom Fighters, while another was sent to the Sol Zone and later reappeared as the pirate Captain Metal.
* The Hooligans: A trio of criminals who are occasionally employed by Dr. Eggman and other villains to collect bounties or interfere with the Freedom Fighters. The group consists of sniper and jewel thief Nack the Weasel, silent muscle Bark the Polar Bear, and psychotic bomb expert Bean the Dynamite Duck. They are often defeated by Sonic and company, but there are moments where they become dangerously close to killing or otherwise ruining Sonic.
* Walter Naugus: A major antagonist in the comic, Naugus is an evil sorcerer who wishes to conquer the Kingdom of Acorn. His backstory alters between the two continuities. He was banished to the Special Zone alongside King Acorn by a treacherous Dr. Eggman, but later escapes. In the original timeline, he was called Ixis Naugus, a member of the Order of Ixis, founded by Mammoth Mogul. He was created from a fusion of three wizards, the rhinoceros Agunus, the bat Nusgau, and the lobster Suguna, who all fought for mental supremacy, driving Naugus to madness. He recruited Geoffrey St. John as his apprentice to ensure his succession to the throne, later possessing the skunk when his own body began to mutate. Following the Genesis Waves, Naugus is renamed Walter Naugus, and is a troll. His attempt to conquer the Kingdom is thwarted when he regains his memories of his past life by touching Nicole and flees, meeting his sister Wendy Naugus, based on Witchcart from &quot;Tails&#x27; Skypatrol&quot;. He made several attempts to regain his magic (which was siphoned by the first Genesis Wave that happened in the new continuity during Sonic Advance 3), all that culminated into a battle over the Master Emerald with Knuckles. He was eventually defeated and imprisoned in the Kingdom.
* The Dark Legion (old continuity): A technocratic organization of echidnas who served as recurring antagonists towards Knuckles and, to a lesser extent, to the Freedom Fighters. They were formed after the echidnas of Angel Island denounced the empire&#x27;s advanced technology. All members have cybernetic implants. Notable members include Julie-Su&#x27;s half-siblings Lien-Da and Kragok, who were both quite abusive and hateful towards her, Kragok&#x27;s son Remington, and mad scientist Dr. Finitevus. The organization would later join forces with Dr. Eggman, becoming the Dark Egg Legion.
* Dr. Finitevus (old continuity): A mad scientist and former member of the Dark Legion. Once an ambitious scientist, Finitevus was transformed into an albino echidna after using his invention, the Chaos Siphon Suit, to drain Chaos Knuckles’ of his power and restore him to normality. Finitevus became a major antagonist shortly after, most notably bringing about the resurrection of the evil Enerjak using Knuckles as a host, hoping to use him to cleanse the world with fire and death. Deceptive, cunning, and intelligent above all else, Finitevus is known to subtly use his allies or others as pawns for his scheme, and would happily betray them or leave them to die the second he feels their usefulness has ended.
* Enerjak (old continuity): Enerjak was an evil demigod who lacked a physical form, his consciousness possessing several echidnas. He manifested as a villainous alter ego for his host, and harnessed destructive powers. His most notable host was Dimitri, a scientist from Angel Island, who fused with eleven of the Chaos Emeralds and became Enerjak. Losing his power to Mammoth Mogul, Dimitri gained a cybernetic body and changed his ways, uniting the echidna empire, but due to failing health, was reduced to a robotic head. Knuckles later became the fourth Enerjak in both the main continuity, and in the &quot;Dark Mobius&quot; timeline, the title later inherited by Lara-Su.
* Scourge the Hedgehog (old continuity): Sonic&#x27;s evil counterpart from the parallel world of Moebius. Introduced as Anti-Sonic, Scourge at first resembled Sonic but wore sunglasses and a leather jacket. He made himself King of Moebius after murdering his father, and led the Anti-Freedom Fighters, which consisted of evil versions of Sally, Tails, Rotor, Antoine, Bunnie, and Amy Rose. He gained his signature green fur after trying to trigger a super transformation using the Master Emerald. He later joined and led such groups like the Suppression Squad and the Destructix, accompanied by his girlfriend Fiona Fox, a former Freedom Fighter who betrayed the other members due to past grudges. The group were imprisoned within the Zone Jail by another of Sonic&#x27;s counterparts, Zonic the Zone Cop, but later escaped back to Moebius.
* Mammoth Mogul (old continuity): An ancient, immortal mammoth who is a talented sorcerer and criminal businessman. He received his intelligence and magical powers upon finding a Chaos Emerald, forming the Order of Ixis to rule over Mobius. Though egotistical and manipulative, he is charismatic, well-cultured, and patient thanks to his immortality. Mogul used his magic to give Mighty his superhuman strength, and Mina her super speed, cursing them with a post-hypnotic mark to forget their encounters and would serve as sleeper agents when needed. After multiple attempts to conquer the world and losing to the Freedom Fighters, Mogul became manager of the Casino Nights Zone, employing old Badniks as employees such as Scratch, Grounder, and Coconuts, waiting to play a long game to ensure his victory. In a possible dystopian future, he would take on Silver the Hedgehog as his ward, teaching him to master his telekinetic abilities and sending him to the past to destroy the traitor of the Freedom Fighters.
* The Iron Dominion (old continuity): A recurring organization who once served under Dr. Eggman&#x27;s regime until defecting to become their own faction. It was led by the &quot;Iron Queen&quot;, the human Regina Ferrum, and the &quot;Iron King&quot;, the Mobian ox warlord Jun Kun. Regina grew up in the Overland capital MegaCentral, living as part of a cult that studied technomagic, allowing her control electric impulses and machinery. After her cult&#x27;s ways were banned, Regina vowed to bring technomagic back to the world. She joined forces with Jun to conquer the Dragon Kingdom, waging war against the ruling clans of the kingdom. The Iron Dominion later joined forces with the Eggman Empire. Jun was defeated in battle, while Regina fell in love with Snively, plotting to take over the Eggman Empire together. However, Snively was secretly imprisoned by his uncle and replaced by a robotic clone to keep the Dominion in line.
* Black Arms: An extraterrestrial race introduced in &quot;Shadow the Hedgehog&quot;, the Black Arms traverse space on the Black Comet, and are led by the evil Black Doom. The events of &quot;Shadow the Hedgehog&quot; take place out of sight, Black Doom creates Shadow alongside Professor Gerald Robotnik, intending on using him as a weapon. The Black Comet was destroyed by Shadow. However, another branch of the Black Arms, led by Black Death, invaded Earth following the second Genesis Wave. A new Ultimate Lifeform, Eclipse the Darkling, was created by the Black Arms, but solely out of alien blood, giving him an inhuman appearance. Black Death was killed by Shadow and G.U.N., but Eclipse remains active.
* The Xorda (old continuity): A powerful extraterrestrial species, the Xorda resemble cycloptic cephalopods that communicate telepathically. They played a major role in shaping Mobius, bombing the planet with Gene Bombs, mutating life and creating the Mobians. They returned a millennia later to exterminate Mobians as they did with mankind, but were repelled by Sonic.
* Breezie the Hedgehog (new continuity): A greedy and devious businesswoman who runs the entire &quot;Breezie Media&quot;. During the Chaos Emerald Championship, she rigged the tournament by involving the Hooligans and Metal Sonic in the fights just for the sake of getting rich. After she hired Honey the Cat to design her employees’ uniforms, Honey had called her out for the rigged tournament and Breezie responded by saying &quot;she would soon see it her way&quot; and called Honey out for taking out Tails during the fight. Like Mammoth Mogul during the Pre-Super Genesis Wave, Breezie hired old Badniks as employees in Casino Park such as Scratch, Grounder, and Coconuts.
* Orbot and Cubot: Eggman&#x27;s two bumbling hench-bots built to be his right-hand men, taking Snively&#x27;s position after his betrayal and imprisonment.
* Tails Doll: A mysterious Badnik made in the form of a doll that resembles Tails. The Tails Doll is much more than it appears to be at first glance. Used by Eggman for stealthy infiltration and observation missions, it can transform into a monster-like form once its parameters are met. Used by Eggman to try and destroy the shield generator of New Mobotropolis, it finally managed to do so, and then attacked the city just as the second Genesis Wave happened. Following the Super Genesis Wave, it was defeated by Sonic and Tails during its destructive attempt to wreck Mobotropolis. Later repaired by Eggman, it snuck aboard the Sky Patrol and is feeding Eggman updates on the Freedom Fighters progress to obtain the Chaos Emeralds and Gaia Keys.
* Egg Army: The regional Egg Army leaders who lead different Egg Army regions. In the old continuity, the Egg Army (called the Dark Egg Legion) consisted of Sub-Bosses (or Grandmasters) who ran each Egg Army unit. They are Drago Wolf, Razorclaw, Beauregard &quot;The Baron&quot; Rabbot, Cmd. Hugo Brass, Lien-Da, Duck &quot;Bill&quot; Platypus, The Foreman, Lord Mordred Hood, Akhlut the Orca, Bride of the Conquering Storm, and Diesel the Bear. In the new continuity, the Egg Army consisted of Egg Bosses. They are Axel the Water Buffalo, Akhlut the Orca, Lord Mordred Hood, Maw the Thylacine, Nephthys the Vulture, Thunderbolt the Chinchilla, Tundra the Walrus, Battle Lord Kukku XV (he was the leader of the Battlebird Armada in the old continuity), Abyss the Squid, Conquering Storm the Lynx, and Clove and Cassia the Pronghorns (although Cassia was ranked as Co-Egg Boss), with Wendy Naugus later being conscripted as a twelfth Egg Boss following a failed attack on the Empire with her brother Walter. The only regional Egg Army leaders seen in both continuities are Mordred Hood, Akhlut, and Conquering Storm. Although they had redesigns for the reboot (except Mordred Hood).
* Dark Gaia Creatures (new continuity): A race of hostile supernatural monsters tied to a dark mutagenic energy created by Dark Gaia that emerged during the Shattered World Crisis.

==Bibliography==
==Development==
Shortly after Archie Comics acquired the rights to produce the comic series, editor Daryl Edelman approached writer Michael Gallagher (whom he worked with at the time on &quot;Betty and Veronica&quot;) via a phone call on July 23, 1992, to write stories for the comic. Edelman believed that Gallagher was well-suited writing for the comic for several reasons, among them his work over at Marvel Comics. After briefly discussing the series&#x27; concept and that the 4-issue miniseries would have 3 self-contained stories in each issue, Gallagher was told by Edelman to &quot;establish the characters quickly through strong exposition&quot; using &quot;visuals from the game&quot; (which would be faxed to him) and needed the first script in a week. After taking the job, he went to work and received a full page of &quot;Sonic Line Art&quot; (showing the character in various poses), 4 pages of model sheets showing illustrations of the characters, and 3 pages of character descriptions, locations, and the series&#x27; back story. He later recalled that the characters eventually became &quot;very familiar to him and began to suggest their own stories&quot;. After the miniseries, he ceased being the only writer of the issues, though he continued to contribute throughout its run.

== Legal issues ==

=== Ken Penders lawsuit ===
In January 2009, three years after leaving the comic, former head writer Ken Penders filed for copyright over every story and character that he had created for &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; and its spin-offs during his run at Archie Comics, with the U.S. Copyright Office approving his claims in 2010. Penders planned on continuing his &quot;Mobius 25 Years Later&quot; story independently, and declared that everything using his copyrighted works since issue #159 of the main comic was &quot;essentially unauthorised&quot;. He had been prompted to do so after fans contacted him asking if he had anything to do with the release of &quot;Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood&quot;, which he did not; Penders believed the game used concepts and characters similar to those he had written for the comic series. That same year, Archie Comics filed a lawsuit against Penders, aiming to retain copyright over its stories and characters; Archie alleged that Penders had violated his contract with them. However, Archie were unable to produce the original copy of their contract with Penders, nor those of any other artist who had ever worked on &quot;Sonic&quot;, opening them for future lawsuits.

In 2013, the lawsuit ended in prejudice, with Penders gaining the rights to an estimated over 200 characters from the comic in a confidential settlement with Archie Comics&quot;.&quot; He would later turn the &quot;Mobius 25 Years Later&quot; continuation project into &quot;The Lara Su Chronicles&quot;; Archie would initially write his characters out of future comics, rewriting issues mid-lawsuit to remove any references to them and not republishing stories involving them, before rebooting the canon entirely to retcon out not only his but any other former writers&#x27; original characters and concepts fully.

=== Scott Fulop lawsuit ===
In 2016, after seeing the success of the Penders lawsuit, former &quot;Sonic&quot; editor Scott Fulop filed suits against Archie Comics and Sega, claiming that he had made 15 characters for the comic series and was owed six figures in royalties. He cited the Penders case as justification for his claims, and gave nearly a thousand examples of times Archie had allegedly wrongly used his characters or reprinted stories involving them. Fulop, through his company Narrative Ark, sought damages for copyright infringement by both Archie and Sega, as they had apparently failed to compensate him for his works; he also sought to invalidate copyrights on his characters filed by Archie in 2011 in response to Penders&#x27;s own copyright filings. However, the suits were dismissed in the defendants&#x27; favour, as Narrative Ark provided insufficient evidence for their claims.

==Reception==
The comic has been received positively. Destructoid praised the comic series, especially the earlier issues during the 1990s, for adding more backstory and character interaction than was presented in the &quot;Sonic&quot; video games for the Sega Genesis.

<text>Angela Evelyn Bassett (born August 16, 1958) is an American actress. Known for her work in film and television since the 1980s, she has received various accolades, including a Primetime Emmy Award and two Golden Globe Awards, as well as nominations for two Academy Awards. In 2023, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world, and she received an Academy Honorary Award.

Bassett had her breakthrough portraying singer Tina Turner in the biopic &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It&quot; (1993), which won her a Golden Globe Award and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. She had success starring in &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot; (1991), &quot;Malcolm X&quot; (1992), &quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot; (1995), &quot;Vampire in Brooklyn&quot; (1995), &quot;How Stella Got Her Groove Back&quot; (1998), and &quot;Music of the Heart&quot; (1999). In the following decades, she took on supporting roles in the drama &quot;Notorious&quot; (2009), and the action films &quot;Green Lantern&quot; (2011), &quot;Olympus Has Fallen&quot; (2013), and &quot;London Has Fallen&quot; (2016). She also played Queen Ramonda in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films &quot;Black Panther&quot; (2018), &quot;&quot; (2019), and &quot;Black Panther: Wakanda Forever&quot; (2022). For the latter, she won another Golden Globe and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.

On television, Bassett has starred as Katherine Jackson in the miniseries &quot;The Jacksons: An American Dream&quot; (1992). Her portrayal of Rosa Parks in the television film &quot;The Rosa Parks Story&quot; (2002) gained her a nomination for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress. Her performances in two seasons of the FX horror anthology series &quot;American Horror Story&quot; earned her nominations for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in 2014 and 2015. 

In 2018, Bassett began producing and starring as an LAPD patrol sergeant, Athena Grant in the Fox drama series &quot;9-1-1&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Bassett was born in New York City, to Betty Jane (née Gilbert), a social worker and civil servant, the second wife of Daniel Benjamin Bassett, a preacher&#x27;s son. Bassett&#x27;s middle name was given to her in honor of her aunt Evelyn. Ten months after Bassett was born, her mother became pregnant and had a second child, Bassett&#x27;s sister D&#x27;nette. Bassett said the pregnancy &quot;only made things harder&quot;, leading her parents to send her to her father&#x27;s sister, Golden, in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. While her aunt did not have any children of her own, she &quot;loved children, and she was good with them.&quot;

At the age of four, Bassett was picked up by her mother after her parents divorced; her mother took her and her sister to St. Petersburg, Florida.

Bassett did not see her father again for several years, until she attended her grandmother&#x27;s funeral. There, Bassett met her father&#x27;s daughter Jean, from his first marriage, who was twelve years old, and several years older than Bassett.

After graduating from Jordan Park Elementary School, Bassett was bused to attend Disston Middle School for seventh grade. She began at that school in 1970, a year before the city of St. Petersburg formally established busing to integrate its public schools. After completing seventh grade, Bassett was bused to Azalea Middle School for eighth and ninth grades. Bassett&#x27;s mother became more involved in her daughters&#x27; studies and told the two that they would go to college.

In her younger years, Bassett was &quot;in love&quot; with the Jackson 5, and dreamed of marrying a member of the family group. She said her choice would probably be &quot;whoever had the cutest, roundest Afro at the time. In my imagination we would have children and live in a real house.&quot; As her interest in entertainment developed, Angela and her sister would often put on shows, reading poems or performing popular music for their family.

At Boca Ciega High School, Bassett was a cheerleader and a member of the Upward Bound college prep program, the debate team, student government, drama club and choir. An &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; student for the most part, Bassett got her first &quot;C&quot; in physical education. She tried to convince her mother not to be disappointed by the grade. Bassett called the grade the &quot;average,&quot; leading her mother to say she did not have &quot;average kids.&quot; As Bassett described, she developed a &quot;sense of pride&quot; and did not get another &quot;C&quot; until college. During high school, Bassett became the first African American in that school to be admitted to the National Honor Society. The Upward Bound program is an academic and cultural enrichment program for underprivileged students. Bassett says she and the other participants did not see themselves as underprivileged.

Bassett studied at Yale University and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in African American Studies in 1980. She studied acting at the Yale School of Drama and obtained a Master of Fine Arts in 1983. Her paternal aunt had warned her not to &quot;waste&quot; her &quot;Yale education on theater.&quot; She was the only member of Bassett&#x27;s family to have gone to both college and graduate school.

At Yale, Bassett met her future husband Courtney B. Vance, a 1986 graduate of the drama school. Bassett was also classmates with actor Charles S. Dutton.

==Career==

=== 1980s ===
After graduation, Bassett worked as a receptionist for a beauty salon and as a photo researcher to support herself while looking for acting work in the New York theater. One of her first New York performances came in 1985 when she appeared in J. E. Franklin&#x27;s &quot;Black Girl&quot; at Second Stage Theatre. She appeared in two August Wilson plays at the Yale Repertory Theatre under the direction of her long-time instructor Lloyd Richards; these were &quot;Ma Rainey&#x27;s Black Bottom&quot; (1984), and &quot;Joe Turner&#x27;s Come and Gone&quot; (1986). (Decades later in 2006, she had the opportunity to work on the Wilson canon again, starring in &quot;Fences&quot; alongside longtime collaborator Laurence Fishburne at the Pasadena Playhouse in California.)

In 1985, Bassett made her first television appearance, as a prostitute in the made-for-TV movie &quot;Doubletake&quot;. She made her film debut as a news reporter in &quot;F/X&quot; (1986), for which she was required to join the Screen Actors Guild (SAG).

Bassett moved to Los Angeles in 1988 for more acting jobs. She had early guest spots on &quot;A Man Called Hawk&quot; and &quot;227&quot; (both 1989).

===1990s===
Bassett earned industry attention and public recognition for her early performances in the films &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot; (1991) and &quot;Malcolm X&quot; (1992). For her portrayal of Betty Shabazz in the latter, she earned an NAACP Image Award. The movie received a mixed critical reception. One negative review, for example, judged that &quot;Malcolm X&quot; failed to &quot;capture&quot; the rage of Malcolm X&#x27;s autobiography. During production, director Spike Lee showed Bassett a tape of the exact moment when Malcolm X was shot, since they would be filming the scene. Bassett called the recording &quot;haunting,&quot; but noted that afterward she was &quot;able to grab hold of the pain and re-create the scene.&quot; Bassett felt it was important for her to get the assassination scene correct, and wondered how Betty &quot;found the strength to keep going, to raise her family, to educate, to sustain them.&quot; Bassett worried that after her role as Betty Shabazz in &quot;Malcolm X&quot;, she would not find another role &quot;as satisfying.&quot; At the time of the film&#x27;s release, she expressed her worry that she would not have such a role again. &quot;I think I have been incredibly blessed and it is probably just all downhill from here.&quot;

Bassett also starred as Katherine Jackson in &quot;The Jacksons: An American Dream&quot;, which premiered on ABC-TV in the same week as the theatrical release of &quot;Malcolm X&quot;. After returning to Los Angeles following completion of her work for &quot;Malcolm X&quot;, Bassett got a call to audition for a movie about Tina Turner, based on her memoir &quot;I, Tina&quot;. Bassett won the lead role over Halle Berry and Robin Givens, but had only one month to prepare before filming began. She met with Tina Turner twice, who advised her on details of her interpretation, from wigs and outfits to dancing styles. Turner also did Bassett&#x27;s make-up, leading Bassett to call her &quot;supportive&quot; and her &quot;biggest fan.&quot; In an interview with the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot;, Bassett described going to one of Turner&#x27;s concerts and, after realizing that she knew some of Turner&#x27;s dance moves, she cried and was &quot;almost a river of tears.&quot; Bassett&#x27;s performance as Turner in &quot;What&#x27;s Love Got to Do with It&quot; (1993) received strong reviews. Marc Bernardin of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that Bassett &quot;gave the performance of a lifetime&quot; portraying Turner in the biopic. Bassett won a Golden Globe for her portrayal, and was the first African American to win this Award for Best Actress. She was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Actress, but lost to Holly Hunter for &quot;The Piano&quot;. (Despite the acclaim, Bassett later said in a 2022 interview on &quot;Today with Hoda &amp; Jenna&quot;, that after portraying Turner, she did not receive acting calls for about a year and a half.)

Bassett starred in three movies in 1995, which received varying reviews: &quot;Vampire in Brooklyn&quot;, &quot;Strange Days&quot;, and &quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot;. (For the latter she worked with author Terry McMillan, who had written the book of the same title that was adapted for film). In &quot;Strange Days&quot;, Bassett played Lornette &quot;Mace&quot; Mason, a chauffeur and bodyguard. In &quot;Vampire in Brooklyn&quot;, she played Rita Veder, a tortured cop with a dark secret. She was excited to work with Eddie Murphy in &quot;Vampire in Brooklyn&quot;, and director Wes Craven. Bassett had previously worked with Craven on television shows. Bassett&#x27;s character in &quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot;, Bernadine Harris, was betrayed by her husband. In revenge she set fire to his entire wardrobe and vehicle, then sold what was left for one dollar. Bassett described the scene and her character in this film to the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot;: She said, &quot;The thing is that my character is thinking about how her husband has left her. I have a cigarette in one hand, and I&#x27;m drinking. Basically, the four of us are sitting there talking about men and having some fun.&quot;

In 1997, Bassett starred as the President&#x27;s advisor in &quot;Contact&quot;. Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; opined that Bassett was &quot;largely wasted as a Presidential assistant.&quot; In 1998, Bassett starred in &quot;How Stella Got Her Groove Back&quot;, once again collaborating with McMillan. She played Stella, a 40-year-old professional American woman who falls in love with a 20-year-old Jamaican man. She was praised for her performance by &quot;Variety&quot; and the &quot;Washington Post&quot;. Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said Bassett&#x27;s character was &quot;the best thing in the movie&quot; and wrote the actress &quot;portrays this high-strung superwoman with such intensity that she makes her almost believable.&quot; In 1999, Bassett starred in &quot;Music of the Heart&quot;, once again collaborating with horror director Wes Craven. Matthew Eng wrote of her &quot;terrifically specific chemistry&quot; with Meryl Streep.

===2000s===
In 2000, Bassett turned down the lead role in &quot;Monster&#x27;s Ball&quot; because of the script&#x27;s sexual content. Halle Berry won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in the role.

The first film Bassett appeared in that year was &quot;Supernova&quot;, where she played a medical officer. Her other two films released in 2000 were &quot;&quot; and &quot;Boesman and Lena&quot;, the latter adapted from the play of the same name by South African Athol Fugard. Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that in &quot;Boesman and Lena&quot; Bassett &quot;abandons her recently cultivated glamorous image to dig to the core of Lena&#x27;s fierce, probing, contentious, compassionate character.&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that Bassett captured all of her character&#x27;s &quot;mercurial mood swings&quot;, and both Bassett and her costar Danny Glover &quot;rise to the challenge of these larger-than-life roles, just as you would expect.&quot;

She appeared in the 2001 film &quot;The Score&quot;. Her character was in a relationship with Robert De Niro&#x27;s. She read the film&#x27;s script and became interested. She was telephoned by director Frank Oz, who told her Robert De Niro would &quot;like to meet with you&quot;. Bassett met with De Niro and later realized the conversation was meant to break the ice before they started filming. In addition to &quot;The Score&quot;, that year she also had a role in the television film &quot;Ruby&#x27;s Bucket of Blood&quot;.

The following year, in 2002, Bassett acted in &quot;Sunshine State&quot; and &quot;The Rosa Parks Story&quot;. In &quot;The Rosa Parks Story&quot;, Bassett was cast as Rosa Parks. Laura Fries of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that Bassett &quot;takes her physical strength and turns it inward to portray Parks&quot; and expressed her belief that &quot;lesser hands&quot; would allow for misinterpretation or gross underplay of Parks&#x27;s personality. In addition to positive reception of her role, Bassett was seen as the &quot;star&quot; of the film due to her performance and earned a nomination for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie for her performance.

In 2003, she read from the WPA slave narratives in &quot;Unchained Memories&quot;. In the 1930s, about 100,000 former enslaved African Americans were still alive. As part of the Federal Writers&#x27; Project during the Great Depression, writers interviewed some 2,300, capturing their memories of slavery times. The transcripts of the Slave Narratives collection of the Library of Congress is a record of slavery, bondage and misery. That year she also appeared in the film &quot;Masked and Anonymous&quot;, playing a mistress. Ann Hornaday noted her as among the &quot;endless parade of actors who show up even for the briefest of appearances&quot;.

In 2004, she had roles in the films &quot;The Lazarus Child&quot; and &quot;Mr. 3000&quot;. &quot;Mr. 3000&quot; was a comedy in which Bassett costarred with Bernie Mac. When asked if the film was easier to act in than the more intense roles she had in the past, Bassett said, &quot;This was much easier. This was a walk in the park. It was pretty easy compared to some of the roles I&#x27;ve done that call for so much emotion or physicality.&quot; At the time of the film&#x27;s release, she described both Bernie Mac and Laurence Fishburne, whom she had worked with in the past, her &quot;favorites&quot; and said the pair were both &quot;highly professional and extraordinarily talented.&quot; The only film she appeared in during the following year was &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Smith&quot; in an uncredited voice role.
In the 2006 film &quot;Akeelah and the Bee&quot;, Bassett portrayed Tanya Anderson, the mother of the film&#x27;s lead, Akeelah, played by Keke Palmer. Bassett said she loved the story, viewing the lead character as someone who &quot;could be anyone because each of us have had dreams and aspirations and wanting to be and needing to be supported and directed&quot;. She described working with Palmer as being &quot;really wonderful.&quot; According to Bassett, the two bonded and she said that Palmer was as good an actress as any adult she had worked with. Bassett appeared in the television film &quot;Time Bomb&quot; the same year. Her role was seen as an &quot;extended cameo&quot; by Brian Lowry of &quot;Variety&quot;.

Bassett provided her voice for the 2007 film &quot;Meet the Robinsons&quot;. When asked about her motives in taking on the role, Bassett said, &quot;For one, it was a character I had never played before, which is always important to me, to keep me sharp. But it was also the desire to be part of a well-written movie that has something really positive to say about families and about all the different ways there can be to make a family.&quot;

She appeared in the 2008 film &quot;Gospel Hill&quot;. Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Bassett&#x27;s &quot;fiery self-possession brings a spark of passion to her stick-figure character&quot;. She next appeared in &quot;Of Boys and Men&quot;, portraying Rieta Cole, the matriarch of a Chicago family who is killed in an accident in the beginning of the film; she appears in flashbacks for the remainder of the film. She and her costars Robert Townsend and Victoria Rowell were praised by Robert Gillard of &quot;LA Sentinel&quot; for &quot;capturing the emotions of a family stricken by grief.&quot; Bassett also had a role in Nothing But the Truth in 2008. Bassett joined the regular cast of &quot;ER&quot; for the show&#x27;s final season (2008–2009). She portrayed Dr. Catherine Banfield, an exacting Chief of the ER who was also working to recover from the death of a son and to bring another child into her family. Bassett&#x27;s husband Courtney Vance played her television husband on &quot;ER&quot; as Russell Banfield. Also in 2008, she played the character Brenda in the film &quot;Tyler Perry&#x27;s Meet the Browns.&quot;

In the 2009 film &quot;Notorious&quot;, Bassett portrayed Voletta Wallace, the mother of The Notorious B.I.G. To portray Wallace&#x27;s Jamaican accent, Bassett conversed with her on and off the film set, and she practiced her accent using tapes that Wallace made. Bassett said she jumped at the chance to be part of the film after reading the script. She felt it did a &quot;wonderful job of bringing&quot; The Notorious B.I.G.&#x27;s &quot;life to the page.&quot; Bassett earned positive reviews for her performance in the film, noted as being one of the more experienced actors involved.

===2010s===
In 2010, Bassett lent her voice to portray First Lady Michelle Obama on an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; titled &quot;Stealing First Base&quot;. Bassett was seen as a &quot;terrific&quot; fill in for Obama. Bassett was also cast in the superhero film &quot;Green Lantern&quot;, released in 2011, as notable DC Comics character Amanda Waller. Bassett said working on the film was &quot;a lot of fun&quot; and that she enjoyed being a part of it. Despite this, Bassett was taken &quot;out of her element&quot; with the arrangements made that accommodated the computer-generated effects. She called it her first time doing &quot;this kind of movie&quot; but expressed interest in seeing what her scenes looked like.
In 2010, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; reported that Bassett would have a role in &quot;One Police Plaza&quot;. In 2011, Bassett co-starred with Samuel L. Jackson in the play &quot;The Mountaintop&quot; a fictionalized depiction of the night before the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. (Jackson portrays MLK) while at the Lorraine Motel. The critically acclaimed play by Katori Hall originally debuted in London&#x27;s West End in 2009 and went on to win the Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Play. The production opened on Broadway on October 13, 2011. In March 2011, it was reported that Bassett had signed up for a lead role in the ABC pilot &quot;Identity&quot;.

She also appeared in the 2011 film &quot;Jumping the Broom&quot;, playing the matriarch of a wealthy family. Bassett had a good feeling about the film from &quot;the start&quot;, and believed her character had a &quot;real presence&quot; in the film and felt she was active in the plot. Bassett&#x27;s and Loretta Devine&#x27;s performances in the film were called &quot;in some ways too fierce for the room, offering nuances of hostility and hurt that the movie cannot really handle&quot; and contributing to the &quot;unevenness of the performances&quot; in the film. Bassett and Devine were noted as &quot;superb, distinguished actresses&quot; by Kirk Honeycutt of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, but were seen as having been &quot;asked to overdo every moment with permanent scowls and body language more suitable to &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;.&quot;
Despite this, her performance was given some positive attention, with Elizabeth Weitzman of &quot;New York Daily News&quot; saying Bassett &quot;makes the movie hers&quot;. The film was Bassett&#x27;s second time working with Devine, as the pair had worked together previously in &quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot;. Director Salim Akil said Bassett&#x27;s presence quietly makes a big difference.

Bassett was featured in the 2012 film &quot;This Means War&quot;, having been known to be attached to the film since two years prior. Tambay A. Obenson of IndieWire attributed Bassett&#x27;s lack of appearances in promotional material to her having a small role and her demographic not being targeted by the film. Bassett also appeared as herself in &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Scared Of You&quot;.

Bassett portrayed Coretta Scott King in the television film &quot;Betty and Coretta&quot;, which aired on February 2, 2013, continuing her trend of portraying real women. Bassett had previously played Shabazz in both &quot;Malcolm X&quot; and &quot;Panther&quot;, but instead played Coretta Scott King opposite to Mary J. Blige, who played Shabazz. Bassett was surprised to learn after researching that Coretta initially refused Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s &quot;advances&quot; and called Mrs. King a &quot;modern day iconic heroine.&quot; While being asked about what drew her to play real-life women, Bassett answered &quot;The respect that I have for their lives—their stories, vulnerabilities, strength, and resolve.&quot; Bassett began filming her scenes during the latter part of the previous year. Mary J. Blige, when asked about what kind of experience it was to work with Bassett, said that she was &quot;one of Angela&#x27;s biggest fans&quot; while calling her an &quot;amazing woman.&quot; The film received mixed reviews, including negative reactions from Ilyasah Shabazz and Bernice King, the daughters of Betty Shabazz and Coretta Scott King.

Bassett appeared as Secret Service director Lynne Jacobs in the action thriller &quot;Olympus Has Fallen&quot;, released on March 22, 2013. Bassett was reported to have a role in the film in June 2012, the month before filming began. In an interview with &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, Bassett noted that there had &quot;never been a female head of the Secret Service, much less a woman of color&quot;. She called the decision to have a female African-American Secret Service director &quot;a bold casting choice&quot;. Overall, Bassett viewed the film as authentic. Bassett described working with Morgan Freeman as wonderful, but she admitted to being intimidated by him. She was impressed with the preparation of director Antoine Fuqua, who she said &quot;was just preparation to the hilt&quot; and expressed her interest in working with him again. She appeared in the 2013 film &quot;Black Nativity&quot;. She sang and it was seen as contributing to the film&#x27;s &quot;blissful unreality&quot;. She was asked by the film&#x27;s director, Kasi Lemmons, if she could sing and Bassett admitted to lying to get the role. She joked to reporter Jennifer H. Cunningham, &quot;Yes, I can sing — you didn&#x27;t ask how well!&quot; Singing in a film was a new experience for Bassett, who had never had to sing before and had always lip-synced.

In 2013, Bassett appeared on FX TV show &quot;American Horror Story: Coven&quot; as Marie Laveau, a voodoo witch. Bassett praised the writers, calling them &quot;amazing&quot;. Her agent approached Ryan Murphy about her having a role in the series and he told the agent that she was the person he had in mind for Marie Laveau. Bassett watched the previous seasons of the series before meeting with Murphy and found the writing &quot;wonderful&quot; and the characters &quot;so realized&quot;. Bassett&#x27;s performance earned her a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie. She returned to the show for its fourth season &quot;American Horror Story: Freak Show&quot;, playing Desiree Dupree, a three-breasted woman. She received another nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie.

It was announced in May 2014 that Bassett would make her directorial debut with &quot;Whitney&quot;, a TV film based on the life of Whitney Houston, who Bassett had worked with previously. Bassett had previously expressed interest in directing the year before. It was announced in early June 2014 that Yaya DaCosta would play Houston in the film. Houston&#x27;s daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown, insulted Bassett on Twitter for not casting her as her mother in the film, to which Bassett admitted in an interview that she had never thought about casting Brown. On June 11, 2014, Ruby Dee died from natural causes. Bassett had previously worked with her on &quot;Betty and Coretta&quot; and was reported to attend the Riverside Church memorial for Dee on September 20, 2014.

In the 2015 film &quot;Survivor&quot;, Bassett portrayed United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom Maureen Crane. In a negative review of the film, Mark Kermode lamented Bassett &quot;appears from behind closed doors like a celebrity guest on &quot;Stars in Their Eyes&quot;.&quot;

Bassett also voiced the character Six in the first-person shooter game, &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six Siege&quot;.

In March 2016, Bassett appeared in &quot;London Has Fallen&quot;, reprising her role as Lynne Jacobs. Bassett noted it was &quot;the very first sequel I&#x27;ve ever done&quot; and that she had been excited at the prospect of another film after the initial success of &quot;Olympus Has Fallen&quot;.
In June 2016, the Human Rights Campaign released a video in tribute to the victims of the Orlando nightclub shooting; in the video, Bassett and others told the stories of the people killed there. Bassett appeared in &quot;American Horror Story: Roanoke&quot;. She also directed its sixth episode, which aired on October 19, 2016. The episode marks the third time a woman has directed the show. Co-creator Ryan Murphy praised Bassett in an interview with E! News, saying he told her she would {{&quot;&#x27;}}do this big, big episode and you&#x27;re going to knock it out of the park,&#x27; and she did. And I&#x27;ve seen it time and time again with these women that we brought into this directing world that they&#x27;re just killing it, and they&#x27;re working twice as hard because they know they have a lot to prove.&quot;

In March 2017, Bassett appeared in &quot;Ache&quot;, an episode of the television series &quot;Underground&quot;. Executive producer and director Anthony Hemingway said her character &quot;was written with Angela in mind&quot; and that the entire cast came to see Bassett the day she filmed her performance.
In May 2017, Bassett appeared in an episode of &quot;Master of None&quot;, portraying major character Denise&#x27;s mother Catherine. Lena Waithe wanted Bassett after being impressed by her previous work though was convinced she would turn down the role and said Bassett&#x27;s inclusion influenced the series drastically with &quot;another layer&quot; of tension. The writers of the series also favored Bassett for the role after seeing her performance in &quot;The Jacksons: An American Dream&quot; and related her character&#x27;s evolution in that feature to Catherine.

In January 2018, Bassett joined the Fox first responder procedural drama &quot;9–1–1&quot;, of which she is also an executive producer. She plays officer Athena Grant, wife to Robert Nash, and during the show&#x27;s fifth season in 2022, the character made an appearance in an episode of its spin-off, &quot;9-1-1: Lone Star&quot;.

In February 2018, Bassett starred in the acclaimed Marvel Cinematic Universe superhero film &quot;Black Panther&quot; as Queen Ramonda, mother of the titular character; she briefly reprised the role the following year in &quot;&quot;. In July 2018, she portrayed CIA Director Erika Sloane in the action spy film &quot;&quot;. In December 2018, she voiced the Decepticon villain &#x27;Shatter&#x27; from the Transformers live-action film &quot;Bumblebee&quot;. In 2019, she joined the cast of &quot;Gunpowder Milkshake&quot;.

In November 2022, she reprised her role as Ramonda in &quot;Black Panther: Wakanda Forever&quot;.

She then appeared alongside Millie Bobby Brown in the Netflix film &quot;Damsel&quot;, released in March 2024 to mixed reviews. Bassett will also be starring in &quot;&quot;, set for debut in 2025.

== Media image ==
Bassett is widely regarded as one of the finest actresses of her generation. Bassett has portrayed real-life African-American women who are usually strong and intelligent. Bassett said in 2001 that she liked those roles and added: &quot;That&#x27;s the image that I like to put out there, and those are the parts I&#x27;m attracted to. But not iron-fist kind of strong, just self-assured. I&#x27;m nice too.&quot; She has turned down roles which she viewed as demeaning to her image. &quot;This is a career about images. It&#x27;s celluloid; they last for ever. I&#x27;m a black woman from America. My people were slaves in America, and even though we&#x27;re free on paper and in law, I&#x27;m not going to allow you to enslave me on film, in celluloid, for all to see. And to cross the water, to countries where people will never meet people who look like me. So it becomes a bigger thing than me just becoming a movie star, and me just being on TV. So if you&#x27;re going to show every black woman as 400lb or every black woman as the prostitute on the street ... But I have always maintained that [the roles] I cannot do because of the way I&#x27;m made up, or because of the way I think, I don&#x27;t begrudge that there is someone else who has no issues with that.&quot;

In December 2022, she was named as part of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; {{&#x27;}}s Women in Entertainment Power 100. &quot;Time&quot; named her among its 2023 honorees for Women of the Year.

<text>Clarion is a commercial, proprietary, fourth-generation programming language (4GL), multi-paradigm, programming language and integrated development environment (IDE) from SoftVelocity used to program database applications. It is compatible with &quot;indexed sequential access method&quot; (ISAM), &quot;Structured Query Language&quot; (SQL), and &quot;ActiveX Data Objects&quot; (ADO) data access methods, reads and writes several flat file desktop database formats including ASCII, comma-separated values (CSV), DOS (binary), FoxPro, Clipper, dBase, and some relational databases via ODBC, Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase SQL Anywhere, and Oracle Database through the use of accelerated native database drivers, and XML, Clarion can be used to output to HTML, XML, plain text, and Portable Document Format (PDF), among others.

The Clarion development environment (IDE) runs on the Clarion language. The IDE provides code generation facilities via a system of templates which allow programmers to describe the program from an abstract level higher than code statements. The generator then turns this higher level into code, which in turn is then compiled and linked using a normal compiler and linker. This generation layer is sometimes referred to as 4GL programming. Using the generation layer is optional. It is possible to create programs fully at the code level (the so-called 3 Lager), bypassing all code generation facilities.

If the templates are used to generate code, then programmers are able to inject their own code into the generated code to alter, or extend, the functions offered by the template layer. This process of embedding code can be done while viewing the surrounding generated code. This mixing of template code and generated code allows the template settings to be updated, and the code regenerated, without loss of the embedded code.

The templates (from which the code is generated) are provided in source form and developers are free to create their own templates. Many templates have been written by various developers: some are offered as commercial add-ons, and some are free.

Three main Clarion products exist: Professional Edition, Enterprise Edition, and .NET.

==History==
The first release of the Clarion language was a DOS product named Clarion 1.0 and was first released in April 1986. Clarion was created by Bruce Barrington, one of the founders of healthcare firm &quot;HBO &amp; Company&quot; (later acquired by McKesson Corporation,) and a small team of developers. Barrington&#x27;s goal was to create a language that would be compact and expressive, and would maximize the use of the memory-mapped screen of the IBM PC by creating a screen designer. Version 1 produced pseudocode; the initial release included a screen designer, an interpreter, an editor, and a debugger. Initially it supported databases composed of DAT files which was Clarion’s proprietary ISAM file format. Bruce Barrington formed Barrington Systems and released version 1.0. 

In 1991 Barrington licensed compiler technology from a company named Jensen &amp; Partners International (JPI). JPI was founded in 1987 by Niels Jensen, who had earlier (1979 or 1981) been one of the founders of Borland. Philippe Kahn was the marketing person who built Borland around the $49 Turbo Pascal compiler. Niels and his team were working on a new compiler technology at Borland when Kahn decided to buy Wizard C, and name it Turbo C. Niels and several other developers left Borland and started JPI, where they continued to work on their compiler technology, named TopSpeed, which they bought from Borland for $1.7 million.

During this time the relationship between Clarion Software and JPI grew closer, and on April 30, 1992, Clarion merged with JPI to form an entity which would eventually be named TopSpeed Corporation. Employees at the TopSpeed Development Centre in London went to work on CDD and resolved many of the bugs.

Clarion 11.1 is the current release, build 13788, which was released in February 2022. 

As of August 2023, A Clarion 12 release is expected by the community, but so far there is no official comments on confirmed future features.
==Notability==

Clarion is historically known as being one of the first 4GL computer programming tools, first developed in the 1980s.

<text>Isaac René Guy Le Chapelier (12 June 1754 – 22 April 1794) was a French jurist and politician of the Revolutionary period.

==Biography==
Le Chapelier was born in Rennes in Brittany, where his father was &quot;bâtonnier&quot; of the corporation of lawyers, a title equivalent to President of the Bar. He entered the law profession, and was a noted orator. In 1775, Le Chapelier was initiated as a freemason at the Grand Orient de France.

In 1789 he was elected as a deputy to the Estates General by the Third Estate of the &quot;sénéchaussée&quot; of Rennes. He adopted radical opinions. His influence in the National Constituent Assembly was considerable: he served as president 3–17 August 1789, presiding over the famous all-night session of 4–5 August, during which feudalism was abolished in France, and in late September 1789 was added to the Constitutional Committee, where he drafted much of the Constitution of 1791.

Le Chapelier introduced a motion in the National Assembly which prohibited guilds, trade unions, and &quot;compagnonnage,&quot; and which also abolished the right to strike. The law did not &quot;abolish the right to strike&quot;, no right to not turn up for work and not be dismissed, had ever existed in French law, a &quot;right&quot; that did not exist, and had never existed, can not have been &quot;abolished&quot; by the law of 1791. Le Chapelier and other Jacobins interpreted demands by Paris workers for higher wages as contrary to the new principles of the Revolution. The measure was enacted law on 14 June 1791 in what became subsequently known as the &quot;Le Chapelier Law.&quot; The law effectively barred guilds and trade unions in France until 1864. There had been an effort, by Turgot, to abolish the compulsory guilds (producer cartels) in 1776 - but it did not go into effect. The Estates General proclaimed against the guilds on August 4, 1789 - but the end of these compulsory producer cartels did not come till 1791.

In May, 1789, when the Estates General were still meeting, Le Chapelier was one of the founders of the Breton Club, a collection of deputies initially all hailing from his home province of Brittany, but which in the weeks to come drew all sorts of deputies sharing a more radical ideology. After the October Days (5–6 October) and the National Assembly&#x27;s move to Paris, the Breton Club rented a Dominican monastery and became the Jacobin Club, of which Le Chapelier was the first president.
Like many radical deputies, Le Chapelier wished for the central role played by such popular societies early in the French Revolution to come to an end with the settling of the state and the pending promulgation of a new constitution. This conviction was increased by the Champs de Mars Massacre of 17 July 1791. Within days, Le Chapelier joined the mass exodus of moderate deputies abandoning the Jacobin club in favour of a new organisation, the Patriotic Society of 1789 and later the Feuillant club.

Le Chapelier, in his capacity as chairman of the Constitutional Committee, presented to the National Assembly in its final sessions a law restricting the rights of popular societies to undertake concerted political action, including the right to correspond with one another. It passed 30 September 1791. By the virtue of obeying this law, the moderate Feuillants embraced obsolescence; the radical Jacobins, by ignoring it, emerged as the most vital political force of the French Revolution. The popular society movement, largely founded by Le Chapelier, was thus inadvertently radicalised contrary to his original intentions.

During the Reign of Terror, as a suspect for having had links with the Feuillants, he temporarily emigrated to Great Britain, but returned to France in 1794, in an unsuccessful effort to prevent the confiscation of his assets. He was arrested, and guillotined in Paris on the same day as Guillaume-Chrétien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes.

==In popular culture==

He is a character in Rafael Sabatini&#x27;s historical novels &quot;Scaramouche&quot; (1921) and &quot;Scaramouche the King-Maker&quot; (1931).

<text>John Wingate Weeks (April 11, 1860July 12, 1926) was an American banker and politician from Massachusetts. A Republican, he served as Mayor of Newton from 1902 to 1903, a United States representative from 1905 to 1913, United States Senator from 1913 to 1919, and Secretary of War from 1921 to 1925.

==Life and career==

John Wingate Weeks was born and raised in Lancaster, New Hampshire. He received an appointment to the United States Naval Academy, graduating in 1881, and served for two years in the United States Navy. He married Martha Aroline Sinclair on October 7, 1885.

Weeks made a fortune in banking during the 1890s, after co-founding the Boston financial firm Hornblower &amp; Weeks in 1888. During the Spanish–American War, he returned to active duty with the U.S. Navy from April to October 1898 with the rank of lieutenant.

With his financial well-being assured, Weeks became active in politics, first at a local level in his then-home of Newton, Massachusetts, serving as alderman in 1899–1902 and as mayor in 1903–04. He then moved on to the national scene in 1905, when he was elected to serve the 12th congressional district of Massachusetts in the United States Congress.

As a member of the United States House of Representatives and United States Senate, Weeks made various contributions to important banking and conservation legislation. His most notable accomplishment as Congressman was the passage of the Weeks Act in 1911, his name-sake bill that enabled the creation of national forests in the eastern United States.

In the election of 1918, Weeks was defeated in his re-election campaign. Due to the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, this was the first time election to his U.S. Senate seat was decided by the voters rather than the state legislature. His defeat has been attributed to his refusal to support women&#x27;s suffrage, and his opposition to the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, a distinction he shared with Senator Willard Saulsbury Jr. of Delaware. Despite his defeat for re-election to the Senate in 1918, Weeks remained an active and influential participant in the national Republican Party. He was an early supporter of the nomination of Warren G. Harding for President in 1920, and when Harding became president, he named Weeks to his cabinet.

As Secretary of War, Weeks was a competent, honest, and respected administrator and adviser, who guided the Department of War through its post-World War I downsizing. Weeks&#x27;s hard work and long hours led to a stroke in April 1925, which led in turn to his resignation as Secretary in October of that year.
Weeks died several months later, at his summer home on Prospect Mountain in Lancaster, New Hampshire. His ashes were buried in Arlington National Cemetery near what is now known as Weeks Drive.

==Family==
Weeks&#x27;s son, Charles Sinclair Weeks, served as United States senator from Massachusetts, and was later Secretary of Commerce during the Eisenhower administration.

His great uncle, for whom he was named, John Wingate Weeks (1781–1853), was a major in the U.S. Army during the War of 1812 and served as a congressman from New Hampshire. Edgar Weeks congressman from Michigan was mis-attributed as a cousin of John Wingate Weeks in the past.

==Namesakes==
Weeks&#x27;s summer home where he died is now open for tours as part of the Weeks State Park. A nearby mountain within the White Mountain National Forest was named Mount Weeks in his honor.

The John W. Weeks Bridge, a footbridge over the Charles River on the campus of Harvard University in Boston and Cambridge, Massachusetts, was named for Weeks and opened in 1927.

The John Wingate Weeks Junior High School built in 1930 in Newton Centre, Massachusetts, was named for him.

During World War II, the U.S. Navy destroyer escort USS &quot;Weeks&quot; (DE-285) was named for Weeks. Her construction was cancelled in 1944.

The destroyer USS &quot;John W. Weeks&quot; (DD-701) then was named for Weeks. She was in commission from 1944 to 1970.

The investment banking and brokerage firm Hornblower and Weeks, founded in 1888, was named for Weeks and co-founder Henry Hornblower.

Weeks Field in Fairbanks, Alaska was named after him.

<doc id="508630" wikidata="Q4742845" url="?curid=508630" title="Second Australian Imperial Force">
<text>The Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF, or Second AIF) was the volunteer expeditionary force of the Australian Army in the Second World War. It was formed following the declaration of war on Nazi Germany, with an initial strength of one infantry division and related auxiliary components. After considerable expansion of this force, three divisions were sent to the Middle East and North Africa, while the 8th Division was sent to garrison British Malaya and Singapore.

Under the &quot;Defence Act 1903&quot;, neither the part-time Militia nor the full-time Permanent Military Force (PMF) could serve outside Australia or its territories unless they volunteered to do so. The Second AIF fought against Nazi Germany, Italy, Vichy France and Japan. After the war, Australia&#x27;s wartime military structures were demobilised and the 2nd AIF was disbanded, although a small cadre of its personnel became part of the Interim Army that was established in 1947, and from which the Australian Regular Army was formed in 1948.

== Formation ==
At the outset of World War II, there was controversy over whether Australia should concentrate on forming an expeditionary force for overseas service to fight Germany in Europe or a home defence force to fight Japan. Prime Minister Robert Menzies decided to do both, although the experience of the Great War indicated that Australia did not have the resources to do either.

===Conscription===
On 15 September 1939, Menzies announced the formation of the Second AIF, an expeditionary force of 20,000, to consist of one infantry division and any auxiliary units that the Australian Army could fit into it. On 15 November 1939, Menzies announced the reintroduction of conscription for home defence service effective 1 January 1940. Unmarried men turning 21 in the year ending 30 June 1940 would be drafted into the Militia. Because of this, the AIF could not accept personnel who were in reserved occupations.

===Public opinion and the Australian Militia===
Although the AIF had priority for scarce personnel and equipment over the Militia, many Militia commanders were reluctant to release any to the AIF. Although the government had hoped that half of the new force would be drawn from the Militia, it was soon clear that this would not be achieved. The public was torn between the dangers presented by Germany and Japan. After an initial rush, enlistments tapered off. For these reasons, the Second AIF possessed only one division, the 6th Division, for nearly a year.

===The fall of France===
The fall of France shocked both the government and the people into action. A huge surge of enlistments—48,496 in June 1940—provided enough personnel to fill not only the recently formed 7th Division, but also to form the 8th and 9th Divisions as well, and the government ordered units to the United Kingdom to assist in its defence.

==Organisation==
===Command===

Lieutenant General Thomas Blamey was given command of the Second AIF on 13 October 1939 and retained it throughout the war. As such, he was answerable directly to the Minister of Defence, rather than to the Military Board. He was given a charter based on that given to Major General William Throsby Bridges in 1914. Part of his charter required the Second AIF to be kept together, but a series of political and military crises resulted in the divisions rarely fighting together, with individual divisions, brigades and even battalions deployed in different sectors or even different theatres. This resulted in conflicts with British commanders, particularly the Commander-in-Chief Middle East, General Sir Claude Auchinleck, most notably over the relief of Tobruk.

The 6th and 7th Divisions departed for the Far East in January 1942, followed by the 9th Division in February 1943. The last AIF units, three forestry companies, returned via the United States in late 1943. All units of the Second AIF were thereafter deployed to the South West Pacific theatre, although some individuals remained in other theatres on exchange or liaison duty, such as Vernon Sturdee, who was head of the Australian Military Mission in Washington, D.C. from 1942 to 1944.

A controversial decision of the Menzies government was that senior commands in Blamey&#x27;s 6th Division would be restricted to Militia officers. This upset many PMF officers. However, when the 7th Division was formed in May 1940, a regular officer, Lieutenant General John Lavarack was appointed to command it. Blamey appointed two regulars, Major Generals Vernon Sturdee and Henry Wynter to command the 8th and 9th Divisions, but Wynter became ill and Sturdee was appointed Chief of the General Staff following the death of General Sir Brudenell White in the 1940 Canberra air disaster. The commands then went to two CMF soldiers, Major Generals Gordon Bennett and Leslie Morshead.

===Structure===
The Second AIF&#x27;s main strength consisted of a Corps Headquarters and five divisions:
*6th Division
*7th Division
*8th Division
*9th Division
*1st Armoured Division
Divisions numbered 1st to 5th were Militia divisions, which had been raised during the inter-war years and perpetuated the numerical designations of the First AIF units that had fought during the First World War. In addition, the 10th through 12th and the 2nd and 3rd Armoured Divisions were also Militia formations.
There were three brigades in each division. Brigades were numbered from 16 onwards so as not to be confused with extant Militia brigades. There were at first four infantry battalions per brigade but this was soon reduced to three.

Units of the Second AIF prefixed their numbers with a &#x27;2/&#x27; (pronounced &#x27;second&#x27;) to distinguish themselves from Militia units. Where such a unit did not exist in the First AIF or the Militia, the &#x27;2/&#x27; was not initially used, but later it was adopted as identifying a unit of the Second AIF.

After the war with Japan began, large numbers of experienced AIF officers were posted to Militia units. As a consequence, units in which more than 75% of their personnel were AIF volunteers were permitted to call themselves AIF units. By November 1944, 20 of the Militia&#x27;s 33 infantry battalions were entitled to call themselves AIF. At this time the Army was 423,000 strong, of whom 25,000 were women, and 307,000 were members of the AIF.

In the South West Pacific, the Army found that its force structure was unbalanced, with a preponderance of operational units and a grave shortage of logistical units. The Army was also faced with government requests to release manpower to industry, and later to discharge long-serving personnel. This was remedied by disbanding operational units.

From 1 May 1945, the Army&#x27;s monthly quota was 420 men and 925 women. As its wastage was greater than this, units were disbanded for reinforcements.

==Weaponry and equipment==

Unlike in 1914, Australia did not possess a stock of modern weapons and equipment at the outbreak of the war. As in 1914, the British Army was unable to help much in the initial stages, as it was preoccupied with its own mobilisation. The Treasury Department opposed the diversion of large numbers of men and women from industry, the conversion of industries to production of weapons, and the expenditure of large sums on defence. It took time for the Army to overcome its objections, and modern weapons, such as the 25 pounder, were soon coming off the assembly lines in Australia. In the meantime, the AIF, like the Militia, made do with the weapons that the First AIF had brought back from the Great War.

===Armour===
The 1st Armoured Division was formed at Puckapunyal in 1941 after the German blitzkrieg had demonstrated the value of armour in modern warfare.

==Personnel==

Personnel were required to be between 20 and 35 years old on enlistment, although there were many cases of this being evaded. A large number of personnel were aged 20 on enlistment, and many former members of the First AIF joined up, a practice encouraged by some unit commanders, who liked to have some old hands around.

===Pay===
Although volunteer militiamen were paid 8s per day, an unmarried private in the AIF was paid 5s per day in Australia, with an extra 2s per day after embarkation for overseas. This was less than the 8s 6d per day dole, not to mention the average basic wage of £2 16s.

===Serial numbers===
All members of the Second AIF were allocated a serial number. The first letter represented the state of enlistment: N – New South Wales; V – Victoria; Q – Queensland; S – South Australia; W – Western Australia; T – Tasmania; D (&quot;Darwin&quot;) – Northern Territory; P - Papua New Guinea. The serial numbers of female soldiers followed this with an F. AIF serial numbers then had an X. A low number indicated an early enlistment. General Blamey was VX1. Soldiers transferring from the Militia often kept their old number with 100,000 added, while PMF officers had 20,000 added.

===Women in the AIF===

From the first, women served with the AIF in the Australian Army Nursing Service. The Australian Army Medical Women&#x27;s Service was formed in 1942, and the Australian Women&#x27;s Army Service on 13 August 1941. The latter had a strength of 24,000. Some 35,000 women served in the Army, making up about 5% of the force.

==Uniforms and insignia==
===Shoulder patches===
Units wore the shoulder patch of the corresponding unit of the First AIF, with a grey border to distinguish the unit from the Militia unit wearing the same patch. The shape of the grey indicated the division, which sometimes differed from that of the coloured part. Later, AIF personnel in Militia units were authorised to wear the grey border, resulting in some units wearing the same patches. The 9th Division replaced all its patches with a new type in the shape of a &quot;T&quot;. As there were more units in the Second AIF than the First, many units wore patches of a new design.

==Operations==
The 6th Division, under Major General Iven Mackay fought in the Western Desert campaign at Bardia, Tobruk and Benghazi. It experienced many casualties in the Greek campaign, where 3,000 Australian soldiers were taken prisoner.

After refitting in Syria, the 6th Division was recalled to Australia to take part in the Pacific War in February 1942. Its 16th and 17th Infantry Brigades were temporarily diverted to garrison Ceylon. The 19th Infantry Brigade was sent to Darwin, except for its 2/11th Infantry Battalion, which went to Western Australia.

When the remainder of the 6th Division returned, it was committed to the fighting in New Guinea. The 16th Infantry Brigade participated in the fighting on the Kokoda Track and at Buna. The 17th Infantry Brigade fought in the Battle of Wau and the Salamaua campaign.
The 7th Division, under Major General Arthur Allen and other Australian units formed the body of the Allied invasion of Lebanon and Syria in 1941. The division&#x27;s 18th Infantry Brigade fought at Tobruk.

Following the outbreak of war in the Pacific, elements of the 7th Division were sent to the Dutch East Indies, reinforcing a few 8th Division units. The bulk of the 7th Division was deployed in support of Militia battalions engaged in a rearguard action on the Kokoda Track Campaign in New Guinea. With elements of the 1st Armoured Division and 6th Divisions, and Militia, it formed a large part of the Allied forces which destroyed the major Japanese beachhead in New Guinea, at the Battle of Buna-Gona.

Most of the 8th Division was sent to Malaya to strengthen the garrison prior to war with Japan, while the remaining battalions were deployed in the Dutch East Indies and New Guinea. Consequently, most of the division was lost at the Fall of Singapore in February 1942, where the division lost 1,789 killed and 1,306 wounded; another 15,395 were captured. The divisional commander, Major General Henry Gordon Bennett created an enduring controversy by escaping.

A small, lesser-known force known as Mission 204 was drawn from units in Malaya, including forty men of the 8th Division. It served in China, advising the Chinese Army, until it was withdrawn in October 1942.
The 23rd Infantry Brigade remained, but without battalions, as these had been lost when Ambon, Rabaul and Timor fell. It was filled up with Militia battalions, and it and other remaining elements of the 8th Division participated in the campaigns in the South West Pacific. The 8th Division was reformed after the war to process prisoners of the Japanese.

Australian prisoners of war, like other Allied prisoners of the Japanese, were often held in inhumane conditions, such as Changi Prison or in Japan. Some were subject to forced labour, including the Burma Railway or forced long distance marches, such as on Sandakan.

AIF Independent companies continued guerrilla operations in East Timor for many months until being evacuated in January 1943. Independent companies played an important part in the defence of New Guinea, initially occupying several locations to Australia&#x27;s north to provide an early warning capability in the months prior to the outbreak of the Pacific War, and then, after the fighting had started, fighting several delaying campaigns in Timor, New Guinea, and New Britain. Later in the war, these units were converted into &quot;commando&quot; units, subsequently fighting several campaigns in New Guinea, Bougainville and Borneo.

The 9th Division fought in the North African campaign under Major General Leslie Morshead and distinguished itself first at the Battle of Tobruk, where it became the first Allied unit to resist German &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; tactics. The Axis leader in North Africa, Lieutenant General Erwin Rommel, described the 9th Division at Tobruk as: &quot;immensely big and powerful men, who without question represented an elite formation of the British Empire, a fact that was also evident in battle.&quot;

The 9th also served with distinction at the First and Second Battles of El Alamein. It returned to Australia in early 1943 in a convoy operation designated Operation Pamphlet.

In 1943, the 6th, 7th and 9th Divisions were reunited on the Atherton Tableland.

General Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Allied Commander in the South West Pacific Area depended on the AIF as the spearhead of his land forces in 1942 and 1943. The 7th Division, now under Major General George Vasey, fought at Nadzab and in the Finisterre Range campaign. Meanwhile, the 9th Division, now under Major General George Wootten fought at Red Beach and then in the Huon Peninsula campaign.
MacArthur deployed the AIF divisions in secondary assignments during 1944–45, where they often fought what many considered to be pointless battles. A shortage of first operational units and then logistic units caused the 6th Division, now under Major General Jack Stevens to be committed to the Aitape-Wewak campaign despite MacArthur&#x27;s efforts. He employed the 7th and 9th Divisions in the Borneo Campaign (1945).

A planned invasion of the Japanese home island of Honshū in 1946, Operation Coronet, would almost certainly have included an &quot;Australian 10th Division&quot;, made up of experienced personnel from the three existing divisions. However, the Japanese surrendered before the invasion took place.

==Disbandment==
Most Second AIF personnel were demobilised by the end of 1946. The Second AIF ceased to exist on 30 June 1947. All Second AIF personnel still on full-time duty were transferred to the Interim Army on 1 July 1947; this force was used to form the foundation of the Australian Regular Army in 1948.

<text>Robert Alphonse Picardo (born October 27, 1953) is an American actor. He is best known for playing the Doctor on &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;.

He is a frequent collaborator with Joe Dante and is a member of The Planetary Society&#x27;s board of directors.

==Early life==
Picardo was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Joe Picardo. Robert is of Italian heritage, with his father&#x27;s family originating from Montecorvino Rovella, Salerno, and his mother&#x27;s parents originally from Bomba in Abruzzo. He graduated from William Penn Charter School in 1971 and originally entered Yale University as a pre-medical student, but opted to act, instead. He graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in drama from Yale.

Picardo is an accomplished singer. While he was at Yale University, he was a member of the Society of Orpheus and Bacchus, the second-longest running undergraduate &quot;a cappella&quot; group in the United States. Also, while at Yale, he had a major role in the 1973 European premiere production of Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;Mass&quot; in Vienna, conducted by John Mauceri. The production was televised by ORF and broadcast on PBS during the 1970s. His singing was also incorporated into his role in &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;.

After earning his degree, he enrolled at the Circle in the Square Professional Theater Workshop. He waited tables for a few years until his theatrical work started to take off around 1976. His first breaks were appearing in the David Mamet play &quot;Sexual Perversity in Chicago&quot;, and with Diane Keaton in &quot;The Primary English Class&quot;.

==Career==

<text>Claude-Carloman de Rulhière (or Rulhières) (12 June 173530 January 1791) was a French poet and historian.

==Biography==
He was born at Bondy, Seine-Saint-Denis. He became &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to Marshal Richelieu, whom he followed through the Hanoverian campaign of 1757 to his government at Bordeaux in 1758; and at the age of twenty-five he was sent to St Petersburg as secretary of legation. Here he witnessed the coup d&#x27;état which seated Catherine II of Russia on the throne, and thus obtained the facts noted in &quot;Anecdotes sur la révolution de Russie en 1762&quot;. Catherine made repeated efforts to secure the destruction of the manuscript, which remained unpublished until after the empress&#x27;s death.

Rulhière became secretary to the comte de Provence (afterwards Louis XVIII) in 1773, and he was admitted to the Académie Française in 1787. The later years of his life were spent chiefly in Paris, where he held an appointment in the Foreign Office and went much into society; but he visited Germany and Poland in 1776. His unfinished &quot;Histoire de l&#x27;anarchie de Pologne&quot; (4 vols., 1807) was published posthumously under the editorship of PCF Daunou. The only important historical work which he published during his lifetime was his &quot;Eclaircissements historiques sur les causes de la révocation de l&#x27;édit de Nantes ...&quot; (2 vols., 1788), undertaken in view of the restoration to the Protestants of their civil rights. Rulhière died at Bondy.

His short sketch of the Russian coup d&#x27;état of 1762 is justly ranked among the masterpieces of the kind in French. Of the larger &quot;Poland&quot; Thomas Carlyle, as justly, complains that its allowance of fact is too small in proportion to its bulk. The author was also a fertile writer of &quot;vers de société&quot; (&quot;[polite] society verses&quot;), short satires, epigrams, etc., and he had a considerable reputation among the witty and ill-natured group also containing Nicolas Chamfort, Antoine de Rivarol, Louis René de Champcenetz, etc. On the other hand, he has the credit of caring for Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his morose old age, until Rousseau as usual quarrelled with him.

Rulhière&#x27;s works were edited, with a notice by Pierre-René Auguis, in 1819 (Paris, 6 vols. in-8). &quot;The Russian Revolution&quot; may be found in the &quot;Chefs-d&#x27;œuvre historiques&quot; of the &quot;Collection Didot&quot;, and the Poland, with title altered to &quot;Révolutions de Pologne&quot;, in the same collection. See also a notice by Eugène Asse prefixed to an edition (1890) of Rulhière&#x27;s &quot;Anecdotes sur le Maréchal de Richelieu&quot;; Sainte-Beuve, &quot;Causeries du lundi&quot; (vol. iv.).

<text>The Royal Netherlands Marine Corps () is the elite naval infantry corps of the Royal Netherlands Navy, one of the four Armed Forces of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The marines trace their origins to the establishment of the on 10 December 1665, by the then grand pensionary of the Dutch Republic, Johan de Witt and famous Admiral Michiel de Ruyter. It is the second-oldest still-active marine corps in the world.

The present-day Corps is a rapid reaction force that can be deployed to any location in the world within a maximum of 48 hours. The marines are capable of operating in all environments and climates, specialising in expeditionary warfare, amphibious warfare, arctic warfare and mountain warfare. The core fighting element of the corps consists of two battalion-sized Marine Combat Groups (MCGs) which are supplemented by various combat support and combat service support squadrons. In addition, the Netherlands Maritime Special Operations Forces (NLMARSOF) are capable of conducting the full spectrum of special operations.

Throughout its history, the Marines have seen action in a number of major conflicts including the Anglo-Dutch Wars, the War of the Spanish Succession and World War II. In recent history the Marines have regularly been deployed in stabilisation roles such as the Bosnian War, the Iraq War, the War in Afghanistan and the Mali War. Additionally, the Corps conducts counterpiracy operations in the Gulf of Aden and provides Vessel Protection Detachments (VPDs) to Dutch merchant ships. The Netherlands Marine Corps uphold close international relations with the Royal Marines, the United States Marine Corps, the Sea Battalion () and the Special Operations Regiment.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
The corps was founded on 10 December 1665 during the Second Anglo-Dutch War by the then grand pensionary of the Dutch Republic, Johan de Witt, and Admiral Michiel de Ruyter as the . The first commander of the corps was Willem Joseph van Ghent. The Dutch had successfully used conventional troops embarked on ships during the First Anglo-Dutch War. The was the fifth European Marine unit formed, being preceded by Spain&#x27;s Infantería de Armada (1537), the Portuguese Marine Corps (1610), France&#x27;s Troupes de marine (1622) and the English Royal Marines (1664), although the Dutch Marines were the first in history to specialise in amphibious operations.

Like Britain, the Netherlands has had several periods during which its Marine Corps were disbanded. The French occupation of The Netherlands, which lasted from 1810 until 1813, is an example of such disbandments. A new Marine unit was raised on 20 March 1801 during the time of the Batavian Republic and on 14 August 1806 the was raised under King Louis Bonaparte. The modern dates back to 1814, receiving its current name in 1817.

In 1667, led by Admiral van Ghent, and their new commander, the Englishman Colonel Thomas Dolman, the Regiment de Marine played a prominent part in the Dutch raid on the Medway in Kent (10–14 June). The &#x27; battle honour &quot;Chatham&quot; is one of the few ever won on British soil by a foreign unit. The July 2nd attack on Landguard fort near Harwich, performed by 1,500 Mariniers after landing at Woodrich was defeated by the English.

The also fought in the Franco-Dutch War and Third Anglo-Dutch War. On 29 June 1672, after serving in the Battle of Solebay, two-thirds of the Marines were withdrawn from the Dutch States Navy and formed into a brigade in order to reinforce the Dutch States Army, which consisted largely of mercenaries, in anticipation of a potential English invasion. They returned to their ships in time to help prevent any such invasion by defeating an Anglo-French fleet at the Battle of Texel on 21 August 1673. Led by Gerolf van Isselmuyden, they served in the land battle of Seneffe against the French in 1674.

Dutch support for American independence led to the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War, where the served at Dogger Bank.

In 1704, Marines were part of a combined English-Dutch force under Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt that captured Gibraltar and defended it successfully shortly afterwards. The cooperation with the British was repeated once again during the Bombardment of Algiers in 1816.

The served in various colonial operations of the Dutch Empire in the Dutch East Indies. The gradual conquest of the colony and operations consolidating Dutch rule lasted from the 1850s until shortly before World War I. The battle honours from the Aceh War (1873–1913) and Bali are displayed on the Corps&#x27; colour.

=== World War II ===

During the Battle of the Netherlands in World War II, a unit in Rotterdam which was preparing to ship out to the Dutch East Indies successfully defended the bridges across the Maas, preventing German paratroopers in the centre of the city from rendez-vousing with conventional German infantry. The Germans ended the stalemate by bombing Rotterdam. The threat of an attack by Marines caused its German captain to scuttle the in Aruba in 1940.

When the Dutch capitulation was declared and the Marines abandoned their positions, the German commander was surprised to encounter only a handful of troops emerge in their black uniforms. The ordered his men to salute them out of respect for their bravery and labeled them (&quot;The Black Devils&quot;).

During the German occupation of the Netherlands, some joined the Princess Irene Brigade to fight against the Germans. They distinguished themselves in combat near the Dutch city of Tilburg in the autumn of 1944.

Starting in 1943, the United States Marine Corps trained and equipped a new brigade, the , of the at Camp Lejeune and Camp Davis in North Carolina in preparation for amphibious landings against the Japanese in the Dutch East Indies. The Japanese surrendered before such landings were needed, but the , fully trained and equipped, left North Carolina in six transports in 1945 and fought against Indonesian insurgents in the Indonesian War of Independence. The were part of the A Division, which was itself commanded by a officer. The brigade was disbanded in 1949.

The Dutch maintained control over Western New Guinea after the Indonesian War of Independence and the served there until 1962 when the colony in the course of the West New Guinea dispute was handed over to the United Nations Temporary Executive Authority.

=== Recent history ===
==== Terrorism during the 1970s ====
On 11 June 1977, the Bijzondere Bijstandseenheid Mariniers (BBE-M, Special Support Unit Marines) of the Dutch Marine Corps stormed a train that was being held hostage since 23 May by armed South Moluccan nationalists in the village of De Punt, in the province of Drenthe. Six Royal Netherlands Air Force F-104 Starfighters buzzed the train as a diversion just before the assault. Six terrorists and two hostages were killed during the assault.

==== Cambodia ====
From 18 February 1992 to 18 November 1993, three battalions of Marines and a Navy field hospital (FDS) were stationed in Cambodia as part of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC). The marines were deployed following the 1991 Paris peace treaty when the civil war was ended, they were tasked with providing safe passage to refugees, disarming rebel groups and organising fair elections.

==== Former Yugoslavia ====
Marines have deployed to Former Yugoslavia during multiple deployments, including in Bosnia, Kosovo and Macedonia. Marines of 1st Mortars Company were deployed near Sarajevo in 1995 with their MO-120 RT 120mm mortars in order to neutralise Serbian mortar and artillery positions. The Marines were part of multinational brigade. For example, Marine Special Forces were tasked with the arrest of Yugoslavian war criminals, other Marine units have deployed to accompany and protect refugee convoys in Kosovo.

==== Iraq ====
In 1991, 400 marines in addition 600 personnel of the Royal Netherlands Army were deployed to the Kurdistan Region of Iraq as part Operation Provide Comfort. The detachment of Marines consisted of a staff company, a support company and two infantry companies. The units constructed three refugee camps which were later transferred to civilian organisations. The last marines returned in July 1991.

In 2003 and 2004, two battalions of Marines were deployed to Iraq as part of the Stabilisation Force Iraq (SFIR). They were stationed in the province of Al-Muthanna where they operated under British command. Their main base was located at Camp Smitty in As Samawah. One company of marines was located at the village of Ar Rumaythah and one at the village of Al Khidr.

Since 2015, Marines have contributed to Operation Inherent Resolve by providing training to the Peshmerga and the Iraqi Special Operations Forces as part of the International military intervention against ISIL. A&amp;A teams cooperated with the by providing advice and assistance to Iraqi troops in the fight against ISIL.

==== Liberia ====
From 18 November 2003 until 19 February 2004, one platoon of Dutch Marines was deployed on board , a Landing platform dock (LPD) of the Royal Netherlands Navy to provide logistical support for United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL).

==== Congo ====
Between 2005 and 2006, Major General of the Marines Patrick Cammaert was appointed division commander of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) by UN secretary general Kofi Annan.

==== Afghanistan ====
From 11 January 2002 to July 2010, marines were deployed in Afghanistan as part of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). The second battalion and the field hospital were deployed in Mazar-e Sharif in 2005 to provide security during the elections. Marines and Navy personnel were also stationed in the Provincial Reconstruction Team in pol-e-Khomri, province of Baghlan. They took over from the Dutch Airforce and Army in 2005 and were relieved in October 2006 when Hungarian forces took over. Formerly Marines have served in Uruzgan as the NLD Operational Mentor and Liaisons Team, for recruiting and training new military personnel of the Afghan National Army in the Uruzgan province. Training took place at Kamp Holland, Tarin Kowt. A reinforced company was deployed in the Deh Rashan area of Uruzgan province. Two marines were killed on April 17 of 2010 when their Bv S10 Viking was hit by an IED. Teams of NLMARSOF cooperated with operators of the (KCT) in the Special Operations Task Groups Orange, Task Force Viper and Task Force 55 from 2006 until 2010.

C-Squadron of NLMARSOF has deployed to Afghanistan since 2018 as part of the Resolute Support Mission. Together with KCT operators they form the Special Operations Advisory Team (SOAT), which is tasked with providing training and assistance to the Afghan police tactical unit Afghan Territorial Force 888 (ATF-888) of the Afghan National Police.

==== Counterpiracy ====
Since 2008 marines have been deployed as boarding teams aboard naval ships of the Royal Netherlands Navy, tasked with conducting counterpiracy operations off the coast of East Africa. The Dutch marines received international attention following the Action of 5 April 2010, during which the container ship MV &quot;Taipan&quot; was liberated from Somali pirates by an NLMARSOF boarding team. The operation was filmed using a helmet-mounted camera and made public by the Ministry of Defence, consequently displayed by news media across the globe. Moreover, NLMARSOF frogmen have conducted extremely rare operational underwater operations, including the sabotage of pirate ships. Since 2011 the Corps has provided Vessel Protection Detachments (VPDs) to Dutch merchant vessels sailing through areas prone to piracy.

== Organisation ==
=== Structure ===

Each Combat Service Support Squadron consists of a Workshop Troop, a Transport Troop, an Equipment Support Troop, a Medical Support Troop, and a Communication and Information Systems Troop.

In 2014, 13e Raiding Squadron was the first unit to complete additional training to become certified maritime special operations capable (MARSOC). A MARSOC unit can support and conduct special operations with NLMARSOF.

==== Netherlands Maritime Special Operations Forces ====

The Netherlands Maritime Special Operations Forces (NLMARSOF) is the SOF element of the Corps. NLMARSOF consists of two operational squadrons, a training squadron, a logistic element and a support group. The Maritime Counter Terrorism Squadron (M-Squadron) consists of three troops and is tasked with combating large-scale and complex domestic terrorist threats. It operates as an integral element of the (DSI) of the National Police. The Conventional Squadron (C-Squadron) is tasked with conducting the full spectrum of special operations abroad. C-Squadron fields three troops; two frogman troops specialised in underwater operations and one mountain leader troop specialised in mountain warfare. C-Squadron can be deployed by submarine, parachute, various underwater transport and snowmobiles. The Training Squadron (T-Squadron) trains all aspiring MARSOF operators in addition to providing operational training. The Special Operations Forces Support Group (SOFSG) provides operational support while the Logistic Support Group (LSG) is responsible for the maintenance, acquisition and storage of all equipment.

NLMARSOF was founded in 2013 by merging the Mountain Leader Reconnaissance Platoon, the and the Special Forces Underwater Operator Platoon. The maritime SOF training takes about 40 weeks, and eligible marines are trained to become long-range reconnaissance SOF operators and counter-terrorism specialists, with an emphasis on maritime special operations. Those who wish to specialise as mountain leader or frogman can apply for these specialisations following the completion of training. NLMARSOF is modelled after the British Special Boat Squadron.

==== Surface Assault and Training Group ====

The Surface Assault and Training Group (SATG) provides the Marine Corps with maritime vessels. The Surface Assault and Training Group consists of 241 men; besides the staff it fields an Amphibious Support Group, a Landing Craft Utility (LCU) Troop, a Landing Craft Vehicle Personnel (LCVP) Troop, a Fast Raiding Interception and Special Forces Craft (FRISC) Squadron, a Landing Craft Control Team Light and a Landing Craft Control Team Heavy. The Amphibious Support Group provides logistical support for the SATG. The LCU Troop fields five Landing Craft Utility with their crews, while the LCVP Troop fields 12 LCVPs with their crews.

The FRISC Squadron fields three troops: a troop with Raiding Crafts for the Marine Combat Groups, a troop with Maritime Counter Terrorism Crafts (MCT) for the Maritime Counter Terrorism Squadron, and a troop with Special Operation and Interceptor Crafts for the Conventional Squadron of the Maritime Special Operations Forces. The two Landing Craft Control Teams consist of a staff, a Beach Recce Group, a Beach Control Group and a Heavy Vehicle Group. The Landing Craft Control Team Heavy is equipped with Leopard 1 BARV beach armoured recovery vehicles. Both Beach Recce Groups field a team of divers to clear mines, barriers and other obstacles from landing beaches.

==== Seabased Support Group ====
The Seabased Support Group (SSG) fields 98 men and coordinates maritime operational logistic support for Marine units embarked on one the Rotterdam-class amphibious transport docks. The Seabased Support Group fields an Equipment Support Troop, a Weapons and Ammo Troop, a Workshop and Transport Troop and a Communications and Information Systems (CIS) Troop.

==== 32nd Raiding Squadron (Dutch Caribbean Forces) ====
The 32nd Raiding Squadron (Dutch Caribbean Forces) consists of 153 personnel and is stationed in Aruba and is responsible for the defence of the Netherlands Antilles. The 32nd Raiding Squadron falls operationally under the command of the Naval Commander of the Caribbean (CZMCARIB). 32nd Raiding Squadron is stationed at the Barracks Savaneta (Aruba). Marines on Aruba also participate in anti-drug operations. The squadron is commanded by a Major and consists of a Headquarters, 3 Raiding troops, and the following supporting units a Fast Raiding, Interception and Special Forces Craft (FRISC) troop (with 12 boats), and a combat service support troop for transport, logistics, maintenance and medical care.

==== Marine Training Command ====
The Marine Training Command (MTC) is tasked with the validation, qualification and training of all operational units of the Corps. Furthermore, the command is responsible for maintaining adequate readiness and quality through the implementation of stringent training standards. Its training programs are adapted to the programs of its fleet equivalent, the Sea Training Command (STC), in order to maximise efficiency and interoperability of the marines and the fleet. The command is headed by a Colonel.

==== Marine Education Centre ====
The Marine Education Centre (, MOC) is tasked with the selection, training and education of new marine recruits. The MOC provides all marine basic training and is based at the Van Ghent Barracks in Rotterdam, headed by a Lieutenant Colonel.

=== Locations ===
The majority of the operational units are based at the in Doorn, in the province of Utrecht. These barracks are the headquarters of the Marine Combat Groups, Sea-based Support Group, and the staff and M-Squadron of NLMARSOF. Due to obsolescence of the location a new base is being constructed at near the city of Apeldoorn. The is based in the city of Rotterdam and provides the basic training and many other training courses within the Corps. The is based on the island of Texel and functions as a forward operating base for the Surface Assault and Training Group from which all sorts of amphibious training can be employed. Moreover, the Corps has multiple bases and auxiliary branches in the Dutch Caribbean. Below follows an overview of the Corps&#x27; bases:

* —Doorn, Utrecht
* —Rotterdam, South Holland
* —Texel, North Holland
* —Willemstad, Curaçao
* —Savaneta, Aruba
* —Curaçao
* —Sint Maarten

== Recruitment and training ==
The are known for their arduous training programmes, which are primarily focused around hardship. Due to its longstanding and close cooperation with its British counterpart, the Royal Marines, training programmes are highly similar for both organisations. Although women have been allowed to join the since the beginning of 2017, no woman has successfully completed basic training yet.

Depending on the educational background, there are two career possibilities to become a Dutch marine: enlisted marine and marine officer. An overview of marine training courses:
* EVO (: Initial training to become an enlisted marine in the Netherlands lasts about 33 weeks (8 months—roughly equivalent to that of the British Royal Marines). It is given at the (M.O.C.) at the in Rotterdam. It is rigorous and very demanding, both physically and mentally, and eventually 30% to 50% will pass. If successfully completed, the recruits receive their &quot;dark blue beret&quot;, and will be assigned to the operational units of Training Command (MTC).
* VVO (): Training to become a marine corporal lasts around 20 weeks. After 4–5 years of experience, marines who exhibit remarkable qualities can apply for this course, where they are being tested on leadership qualities and various military skills. Prior to the actual course, these marines will receive course segments, like marksman instructor, at an earlier stage. Only through experience can a marine corporal grow into sergeant.
* POTOM (—officer training): Initial training to become a marine officer in the Netherlands lasts a total of 22 months, starting with an intensive 11 months of practical marine officer&#x27;s training and followed by 11 months of theoretical background and practical courses. The training is regarded as one of the most demanding initial military training programmes globally, with usually more than 70% of prospective officers dropping out. This part of the initial training programme is modular, which means that it is made up of 4 phases. First, the prospective officers will learn the basic skills of every enlisted marine, which takes about 10 weeks. After phase one comes the second phase, commanding a raiding section of 14 marines. This module lasts for 8 weeks, and emphasizes nightly operations. After successfully completing the second phase the third phase commences, which is focused on commanding a raiding troop of 32 marines. The fourth phase centers around commanding a raiding troop in different domains (e.g. urban, maritime setting). The last two modules are the longest, and cross-training is provided by both the and the British Royal Marines officer training teams. When successfully completing the &#x27;POTOM&#x27;, candidates are required to complete another year of general officer&#x27;s training at the (Royal Dutch Naval Academy). Once this has been finished, the marine officer will be assigned to one of the operational units within the Marine Training Command (MTC).

=== Operational training ===
During operational training, there is more emphasis on various other tactics in amphibious warfare, and it will take about a year to become MARSOC (Maritime Special Operations Capable) certified, which will last for two years. SOCs are able to operate within any environment in the world, under any condition and circumstance. Therefore Dutch marines regularly train in arctic, jungle, desert, high-altitude, and urban conditions, and embark on various training missions throughout the world. In these two years SOCs will work closely with MARSOF platoons throughout the world, and can choose to enlist for further specialization.

=== Specialisation ===
Experienced marines are able to obtain various specialisations. It is common for marines to have multiple specialisations.
Popular specialisations include: weapons instructor, mortar, communications, or heavy weapons specialist, designated marksman, sniper, assault engineer, medic or free-fall para. Some of these specialisations require the rank of Corporal before being able to follow specialisation training, and must not exceed a maximum age.

== Equipment ==
== Tradition ==
=== Uniforms ===
The Corps has multiple distinctive uniforms. The Corps&#x27; standard combat uniform is based on the Battle Dress Uniform (BDU) in the woodland pattern, as opposed to the Disruptive Pattern Material (DPM)-based combat uniform of the other services of the Netherlands Armed Forces. This combat uniform is due to be replaced by new uniforms in the Netherlands Fractal Pattern from 2023 onwards. Operators of NLMARSOF and other selected units wear combat uniforms in the commercial MultiCam pattern.

The service dress uniform can be worn during everyday office, barracks and non-field duty purposes. The uniform consists of trousers with red pipings and a jacket (both in dark-blue fabric), a white dress shirt with a black necktie and headgear (beret or peaked cap). The uniform can be supplemented with brown leather gloves, decorations worn in Prussian arrangement and a belt with a holster.

The mess dress uniform is worn during formal occasions, such as a dinner or a ball and consists of a smoking, complemented with a peaked cap and miniature medals.

The full dress uniform consists of a dark-blue jacket with a red standing collar, dark-blue trousers with red pipings, orange sash (worn by officers), pith helmet, , white gloves and a sabre.

=== Colours ===

The Netherlands Marine Corps was granted a colour (Dutch: ) by Queen Wilhelmina on 16 September 1929 and was renewed in 1988. The colour forms the embodiment of the history and character of the Corps. In contrast to the functional use of colours in the past, during which they served as landmarks on the battlefield, the contemporary role has been greatly reduced. Nonetheless, the colour continues to play an important role during various military ceremonies. For example, soldiers swear the oath of enlistment while holding the colour. Moreover, the colour constitutes an important connection between the Corps and the Royal House of the Netherlands. Only the sovereign can grant a military unit a colour or standard, therefore the royal cypher of the monarch that granted the regiment its (original) colour is displayed. In addition, the colour is inscribed with (historical) battle honours. By prominently displaying them, the aim is to add to the &quot;esprit de corps&quot;, uphold the collective memory and serve as inspiration for future actions.

The colour of the is distinct from other Dutch colours by the display of blue anchors in the four corners. The lanyard of the Military William Order, which it was granted in 1946 for actions in World War II, is permanently attached to the colour as well. The battle honours as they appear on the colours are: Spanje - Algiers, West-Indië, Seneffe, Kijkduin - Doggersbank, Atjeh - Bali, Chatham, Rotterdam, Javazee, Java - Madoera, Nieuw-Guinea. In 2019, it was announced that the Corps was being granted a new battle honour for display on the colour for actions in Afghanistan; Helmand - Kandahar - Uruzgan.

== Ranks and insignia ==


== United Kingdom/Netherlands Amphibious Force (UK/NL AF) ==

Since 1972, units of the Netherlands Marine Corps have formed part of the British 3 Commando Brigade during exercises and real conflict situations. Also Mountain Warfare /Force Reconnaissance Troop of C Squadron NLMARSOF will be placed under UK operational command as part of C Squadron, UK Special Boat Service. Together, these form the UK/NL AF. Either the First or the Second Marine Combat Group can be assigned as the Dutch contribution to this force. UK/NL AF contributes to the European Multinational Maritime Force (EMMF).

The cooperation between the and the Royal Marines has led to extensive integration in the areas of operations, logistics and materials. Within NATO this is seen as a prime example of what can be achieved in military integration.

The NLMC and Royal Marines have a long history of cooperation. During combined actions by the British and Dutch navies during the War of the Spanish Succession (1702–1713), amphibious operations were carried out, the most notable being the Capture of Gibraltar in 1704. During this action, a successful attack was carried out against the fortress of Gibraltar by an 1800-strong brigade of Dutch and British Marines under the command of Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt. Both corps share this battle honour.

The British and Dutch armed forces share close relations. The Royal Marines and Netherlands Marine Corps are allied through a &#x27;Bond of friendship&#x27;.

The nickname of the Dutch Marines among their British Royal Marine counterparts is &quot;Cloggies,&quot; due to the stereotype that most or all Dutch wear clogs, instead of normal footwear.

<text>Gary Michael Louris (born March 10, 1955) is an American guitarist, singer, and songwriter of alternative country and pop music. He was a founding member of the Minneapolis-based band the Jayhawks and their principal songwriter and vocalist after the departure of Mark Olson. Louris is often credited with the band&#x27;s subsequent move from folk-country toward a more progressive, pop sound.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Gary Louris grew up in Toledo, Ohio, where he took piano lessons before becoming a guitarist as a teenager. He graduated from St. John&#x27;s Jesuit High School in 1973. Louris received a BA in Architecture from the University of Minnesota School of Architecture in 1977.

===1985–present: The Jayhawks===
The Jayhawks were formed in 1985 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Louris had formerly played guitar in a rockabilly band, Safety Last. On May 13, 2003, the Jayhawks appeared on &quot;The Late Show with David Letterman&quot; and performed &quot;Save It for a Rainy Day&quot;, from their &quot;Rainy Day Music&quot; CD. The Jayhawks recorded seven albums before going on indefinite hiatus in 2005.

In 2011 the Jayhawks reunited and recorded a new album, &quot;Mockingbird Time&quot;. The lineup consisted of Mark Olson, Gary Louris, Marc Perlman, Karen Grotberg, and Tim O&#x27;Reagan. At that time Louris said, &quot;Our goal is to make the best Jayhawks album that&#x27;s ever been done&quot;. Eighteen songs were recorded, 16 of them new, but only 12 were included on the record. The band toured in support of the album.

Olson left The Jayhawks again in late 2012 and the band went on another short hiatus. They reformed in early 2014 to support the reissues of three Jayhawks albums released between 1997 and 2003. After a year of touring with most of the 1997 lineup the band announced that they would be working on a new studio album, &quot;Paging Mr. Proust&quot;, which was released on April 29, 2016 on Thirty Tigers.

===2005–present: Solo career===
Louris is also a member of the intermittent Midwest musical collective Golden Smog; other members have included fellow Jayhawk Marc Perlman, Jeff Tweedy of Wilco, Dave Pirner and Dan Murphy from Soul Asylum, Kraig Johnson of Run Westy Run and Chris Mars of the Replacements.

In spring 2005, Louris and Olson toured together, billed as &quot;From the Jayhawks: An Evening with Mark Olson &amp; Gary Louris, Together Again.&quot;

He co-wrote the song &quot;Jealous of the Moon&quot; with Chris Thile in 2005, and it appeared on the Nickel Creek album &quot;Why Should the Fire Die?&quot;. Louris is also a songwriter on the 2006 Dixie Chicks album &quot;Taking the Long Way&quot;.

Louris wrote and performed &quot;Every Word,&quot; the theme song for the 2006 documentary &quot;Wordplay&quot;.

In 2008, Louris released his first solo album, &quot;Vagabonds&quot;. The album was produced by Black Crowes frontman Chris Robinson. Of &quot;Vagabonds&quot;, Louris said in an interview, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t my intention to recapture the &#x27;70s or anything, that&#x27;s just what comes out when I sing...Once we got the band together for the sessions, it actually reminded me of how the Jayhawks were when we started out. The music is new and exciting for them, and it was good for me to feed off of that.&quot; &quot;Vagabonds&quot; was recorded in Laurel Canyon, which is famous for being the center of the 1970s&#x27; singer-songwriter scene.

Robinson also produced a collaboration between Louris and his former Jayhawks bandmate Mark Olson. The album, &quot;Ready for the Flood&quot;, was released in November 2008 and January 2009 in the US.

Louris continued to play occasional solo shows even during periods of Jayhawks activity. In 2015, Louris formed a side project called Au Pair with Durham musician Django Haskins from the band The Old Ceremony. They released an album, &quot;One Armed Candy Bear&quot;, in November 2015 on Thirty Tigers followed by a handful of live shows.

===Personal life===
Louris married Stephanie Stevenson in October 2020.

==Equipment==
A 1967 Gibson SG guitar – shown in the picture – reputed to have been formerly owned by lead guitarist John King of the Litter is now owned and frequently used by Louris in the Jayhawks and Golden Smog. The guitar was owned from 1977 to 1986 by Kevin Waddick. Chris Osgood, at the time the guitarist of the punk trio the Suicide Commandos, suggested that Waddick buy the guitar and later informed Louris that it was for sale.

Louris also uses a Martin 00-18V acoustic guitar.

<doc id="508655" wikidata="Q2414244" url="?curid=508655" title="Masatoshi Shima">
<text>is a Japanese electronics engineer. He was one of the architects of the world&#x27;s first microprocessor, the Intel 4004. In 1968, Shima worked for Busicom in Japan, and did the logic design for a specialized CPU to be translated into three-chip custom chips. In 1969, he worked with Intel&#x27;s Ted Hoff and Stanley Mazor to reduce the three-chip Busicom proposal into a one-chip architecture. In 1970, that architecture was transformed into a silicon chip, the Intel 4004, by Federico Faggin, with Shima&#x27;s assistance in logic design.

He later joined Intel in 1972. There, he worked with Faggin to develop the Intel 8080, released in 1974. Shima then developed several Intel peripheral chips, some used in the IBM PC, such as the 8259 interrupt controller, 8255 programmable peripheral interface chip, 8253 timer chip, 8257 direct memory access (DMA) chip and 8251 serial communication USART chip. He then joined Zilog, where he worked with Faggin to develop the Zilog Z80 (1976) and Z8000 (1979).

==Early life and career==
He studied organic chemistry at Tohoku University in Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan. With poor prospects for employment in the field of chemistry, he went to work for Busicom, a business calculator manufacturer, joining in Spring 1967. There, he learned about software and digital logic design, from 1967 to 1968.

==Intel 4004==
After Busicom decided to use large-scale integration (LSI) circuits in their calculator products, they began work on what later became known as the &quot;Busicom Project&quot;, a chipset for the Busicom 141-PF calculator that led to creating the first microprocessor, the Intel 4004. In April 1968, Shima was asked to design the logic for what was intended to become a future chipset to be designed and produced by a semiconductor company. Shima designed a special-purpose LSI chipset, along with his supervisor Tadashi Tanba, in 1968. His design consisted of seven LSI chips, including a three-chip CPU. Shima&#x27;s initial design included arithmetic units (adders), multiplier units, registers, read-only memory, and a macro-instruction set to control a decimal computer system. Busicom wanted to produce a general-purpose LSI chipset, for not only desktop calculators, but also other equipment such as a teller machine, cash register and billing machine. Shima began work on a general-purpose LSI chipset in late 1968, and Busicom then approached the American companies Mostek and Intel for converting the logic into MOS circuits and the chip&#x27;s layout for manufacturing. The job was given to Intel, who back then was more of a memory company and had facilities to manufacture the high density silicon gate metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) chip Busicom required.

Shima went to Intel in June 1969 to present the proposal. Due to Intel lacking logic engineers to understand the logic schematics or circuit engineers to convert them, Intel asked Shima to simplify the logic. Intel wanted a one-chip CPU design, influenced by Sharp&#x27;s Tadashi Sasaki who had presented the concept to Intel in 1968. This was then formulated by Intel&#x27;s Marcian &quot;Ted&quot; Hoff in 1969, simplifying Shima&#x27;s initial design down to four chips, including a one-chip CPU. Due to Hoff&#x27;s formulation lacking key details, Shima came up with his own ideas to find solutions for its implementation. They both eventually realized the 4-bit microprocessor concept, with the help of Intel&#x27;s Stanley Mazor to interpret the ideas of Shima and Hoff. Shima was responsible for adding a 10-bit static shift register to make it useful as a printer&#x27;s buffer and keyboard interface, many improvements in the instruction set, making the random-access memory (RAM) organization suitable for a calculator, the memory address information transfer, the key program in an area of performance and program capacity, the functional specification, decimal computer idea, software, desktop calculator logic, real-time input/output (I/O) control, and data exchange instruction between the accumulator and general-purpose register. The specifications of the four chips were developed over a period of a few months in 1969, between an Intel team led by Hoff and a Busicom team led by Shima.

After Shima went back to Japan in late 1969 and then returned to Intel in early 1970, he found that no further work had been done on the 4004 since he left, and that Hoff was no longer working on the project. The project leader had become Federico Faggin, who had only joined Intel a week before Shima arrived. Faggin was hired from Fairchild Semiconductor, where he had developed the original MOS silicon gate technology, the only technology that could be used to design a chip of the complexity and speed of the 4004. Shima worked with him, assisting him with the logic design the 4004 processor He worked at the Intel offices for six months, from April until October 1970. His company then sold the rights to use the 4004 to Intel, with an exception for use in business calculators.

==Intel 8080 to Zilog Z8000==
After the 4004, Intel designed the 8008 (architecture by Computer Terminal Corporation, design by Federico Faggin and Hal Feeney). Shima then joined Intel in 1972. He was employed to implement the transistor-level logic of Intel&#x27;s next microprocessor, which became the Intel 8080 (conception and architecture by Federico Faggin), released in 1974. Shima then developed several Intel peripheral chips, some used in the IBM PC, such as the 8259 interrupt controller, 8255 parallel port chip, 8253 timer chip, 8257 DMA chip and 8251 serial communication USART chip. He was not involved in the creation of the Intel 8088 or 8086. 

Shima moved to Zilog in 1975 and, using only a few assistants, developed the transistor-level and physical implementation of the Zilog Z80, under the supervision of Faggin, who conceived and designed the Z80 architecture to be an instruction set compatible with the Intel 8080. This was followed by the same task for the 16-bit Z8000.

According to coworkers from Intel, Faggin&#x27;s method that Shima used was to design all logic at the transistor level, directly and manually, not at the gate and/or register level. The schematics were thus hard to read, but as transistors were drawn in such a way that they suggested a &quot;floorplan&quot; of the chip, it helped when making the physical chip layout. However, according to Shima, the logic was first tested on breadboards using transistor–transistor logic (TTL) chips, before being manually translated into MOS transistor equivalents.

After returning to Japan, Shima founded the Intel Japan Design Center in 1980, and VM Technology Corporation in 1986. At VM, he developed the 16-bit microprocessor VM860 and 32-bit microprocessor VM 8600 for the Japanese word processor market. He became a professor at the University of Aizu in 2000.

<doc id="508664" wikidata="Q3711002" url="?curid=508664" title="Exergonic reaction">
<text>In chemical thermodynamics, an exergonic reaction is a chemical reaction where the change in the free energy is negative (there is a net release of free energy). This indicates a spontaneous reaction if the system is closed and initial and final temperatures are the same. For processes that take place in a closed system at constant pressure and temperature, the Gibbs free energy is used, whereas the Helmholtz energy is relevant for processes that take place at constant volume and temperature. Any reaction occurring at constant temperature without input of electrical or photon energy is exergonic, according to the second law of thermodynamics. An example is cellular respiration.

Symbolically, the release of free energy, , in an exergonic reaction (at constant pressure and temperature) is denoted as

:formula_1

Although exergonic reactions are said to occur &quot;spontaneously&quot;, this does not imply that the reaction will take place at an observable rate. For instance, the disproportionation of hydrogen peroxide releases free energy but is very slow in the absence of a suitable catalyst. It has been suggested that &quot;eager&quot; would be a more intuitive term in this context.

More generally, the terms exergonic and endergonic relate to the free energy change in any process, not just chemical reactions. By contrast, the terms exothermic and endothermic relate to an enthalpy change in a closed system during a process, usually associated with the exchange of heat.

<text>OpenCores is a community developing digital open-source hardware through electronic design automation (EDA), with a similar ethos to the free software movement. OpenCores hopes to eliminate redundant design work and significantly reduce development costs. A number of companies have been reported as adopting OpenCores IP in chips, or as adjuncts to EDA tools. OpenCores is also sometimes cited as an example of open source in the electronics hardware community.

OpenCores has always been a commercially owned organization. In 2015, its core active users established the independent Free and Open Source Silicon Foundation (FOSSi Foundation), and created another directory on the librecores.org website as the basis for all future development, independent of commercial control. It has been shut down to redirect to a post on the FOSSi Foundation website seven years later in favor of a simple web search, reasoning that &quot;free and open source silicon is no longer a dream&quot;. 

==History ==
Damjan Lampret, one of the founders of OpenCores, stated on his website that it began in 1999. The new website and its objectives were reported publicly by &quot;EE Times&quot; in 2000 and CNET News in 2001. Through the following years it was supported by advertising and sponsorship, including by Flextronics.

In mid-2007 an appeal was put out for a new backer. That November, Swedish design house ORSoC AB agreed to take over maintenance of the OpenCores website.

&quot;EE Times&quot; reported in late 2008 that OpenCores had passed the 20,000 subscriber mark. In October 2010 it reached 95,000 registered users and had approximately 800 projects. In July 2012 it reached 150,000 registered users.

During 2015, ORSoC AB formed a joint venture with KNCMiner AB to develop bitcoin mining machines. As this became the primary focus of the business, they were able to spend less time with the opencores.org project. In response to the growing lack of commitment, the core OpenRISC development team set up the Free and Open Source Silicon Foundation (FOSSi), and registered the librecores.org website as the basis for all future development, independent of commercial control.

==Licensing==
In the absence of a widely accepted open source hardware license, the components produced by the OpenCores initiative use several different software licenses. The most common is the GNU LGPL, which states that any modifications to a component must be shared with the community, while one can still use it together with proprietary components. The less restrictive 3-clause BSD license is also used in some hardware projects, while the GNU GPL is often used for software components, such as models and firmware.

==The OpenCores library==
The library will consist of design elements from central processing units, memory controllers, peripherals, motherboards, and other components. Emerging semiconductor manufacturers could use the information and license designs for free.

The emphasis is on digital modules called &quot;cores&quot;, commonly known as IP Cores. The components are used for creating both custom integrated circuits (ASICs) and FPGAs.

The cores are implemented in the hardware description languages Verilog, VHDL or SystemC, which may be synthesized to either silicon or gate arrays.

The project aims at using a common non-proprietary system bus named Wishbone, and most components are nowadays adapted to this bus.

Among the components created by OpenCores contributors are:

* OpenRISC – a highly configurable RISC central processing unit
* Amber (processor core) – an ARM-compatible RISC central processing unit
* A Zilog Z80 clone
* USB 2.0 controller
* Tri Ethernet controller, 10/100/1000 Mbit
* Encryption units, for example DES, AES and RSA
* HyperTransport Tunnel
* A PIC16F84 core
* Zet – an x86 compatible core

==OpenRISC ASIC==
In April 2011 OpenCores opened donations for a new project to develop a complete system on a chip design based on the OpenRISC processor and implement it into an ASIC-component. OpenCores affiliated with OpenCores, for example OpenSPARC and LEON.

<text>Total cost of ownership (TCO) is a financial estimate intended to help buyers and owners determine the direct and indirect costs of a product or service. It is a management accounting concept that can be used in full cost accounting or even ecological economics where it includes social costs.

For manufacturing, as TCO is typically compared with doing business overseas, it goes beyond the initial manufacturing cycle time and cost to make parts. TCO includes a variety of cost of doing business items, for example, ship and re-ship, and opportunity costs, while it also considers incentives developed for an alternative approach. Incentives and other variables include tax credits, common language, expedited delivery, and customer-oriented supplier visits.

==Use of concept==
TCO, when incorporated in any financial benefit analysis, provides a cost basis for determining the total economic value of an investment. Examples include: return on investment, internal rate of return, economic value added, return on information technology, and rapid economic justification.

A TCO analysis includes total cost of acquisition and operating costs, as well as costs related to replacement or upgrades at the end of the life cycle. A TCO analysis is used to gauge the viability of any capital investment. An enterprise may use it as a product/process comparison tool. It is also used by credit markets and financing agencies. TCO directly relates to an enterprise&#x27;s asset and/or related systems total costs across all projects and processes, thus giving a picture of the profitability over time.

===Computer and software industries===
TCO analysis was popularized by the Gartner Group in 1987. The roots of this concept date at least back to the first quarter of the twentieth century. Many different methodologies and software tools have been developed to analyze TCO in various operational contexts.

TCO is applied to the analysis of information technology products, seeking to quantify the financial impact of deploying a product over its life cycle. These technologies include software and hardware, and training.

Technology deployment can include the following as part of TCO:

* Computer hardware and programs
** Network hardware and software
** Server hardware and software
** Workstation hardware and software
** Installation and integration of hardware and software
** Purchasing research
** Warranties and licenses
** License tracking/compliance
** Migration expenses
** Risks: susceptibility to vulnerabilities, availability of upgrades, patches and future licensing policies, etc.
* Operation expenses
** Infrastructure (floor space)
** Electricity (for related equipment, cooling, backup power)
** Testing costs
** Downtime, outage and failure expenses
** Diminished performance (i.e. users having to wait, diminished money-making ability)
** Security (including breaches, loss of reputation, recovery and prevention)
** Backup and recovery process
** Technology/user training
** Audit (internal and external)
** Insurance
** Information technology personnel
** Corporate management time
*Long term expenses
** Replacement
** Future upgrade or scalability expenses
** Decommissioning

In the case of comparing TCO of existing versus proposed solutions, consideration should be put toward costs required to maintain the existing solution that may not necessarily be required for a proposed solution. Examples include cost of manual processing that are only required to support lack of existing automation, and extended support personnel.

=== Facilities and built environment ===
Total cost of ownership can be applied to the structure and systems of a single building or a campus of buildings. Pioneered by Doug Christensen and the facilities department at Brigham Young University starting in the 1980s, the concept gained more traction in educational facilities in the early 21st century.

The application of TCO in facilities goes beyond the predictive cost analysis for a new building’s “first cost” (planning, construction and commissioning), to factor in a variety of critical requirements and costs over the life of the building:

* replacement of energy, utility, and safety systems;
* continual maintenance of the building exterior and interior and replacement of materials;
* updates to design and functionality;
* and recapitalization costs.

A key objective of planning, constructing, operating, and managing buildings via TCO principals is for building owners and facility professionals to predict needs and deliver data-driven results.  TCO can be applied any time during the life of a facility asset to manage cost inputs for the life of the structure or system into the future.

==== Developing standards for TCO in facilities ====
APPA, an ANSI Accredited Standards Developer, published &quot;APPA 1000-1 – Total Cost of Ownership for Facilities Asset Management (TCO) – Part 1: Key Principles&quot; as an American National Standard in December 2017. 

APPA 1000-1 provides financial officers, facility professionals, architects, planners, construction workforce, and operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) personnel the foundation of a standardized and holistic approach to implementing TCO key principles. Implementation of TCO key principles can improve decision making, maximizing financial strategies over the life of an asset, starting at the planning and design stage and extends to the end of the asset&#x27;s life.

APPA 1000-2, slated for publication in 2019, will focus on implementation and application of key TCO principals in facility management.

===Transportation===
The TCO concept is easily applicable to the transportation industry and to motor vehicle ownership, for example, the TCO defines the cost of owning an automobile from the time of purchase by the owner, through its operation and maintenance to the time it leaves the possession of the owner. Comparative TCO studies between various models help consumers choose a car to fit their needs and budget.

Some of the key elements incorporated in the cost of ownership for a vehicle include:
* Depreciation costs
* Fuel costs
* Insurance
* Financing
* Repairs
* Fees and taxes
* Maintenance costs
* Opportunity costs
* Downtime costs.

<text>WWEV-FM (91.5 MHz) is a non-commercial Christian radio station licensed to Cumming, Georgia, and serving the Northeast Atlanta metropolitan area. It is owned by RLN Global, Inc. and calls itself Victory 91.5. The station has a contemporary Christian format with some Christian talk and teaching programs. WWEV-FM funds its operations by asking for listener donations and holding periodic fundraising drives on the air.

The Victory 91.5 studios and offices are on Sawnee Drive in Cumming. The transmitter is off Tower Road on Sawnee Mountain.

==History==
===Early years===
The station signed on the air on December 15, 1981. It was originally owned by the Curriculum Development Foundation and broadcast at only 220 watts. It has always been a Christian radio station, but with different programming and music at its founding. In its early days, the radio station was totally automated. The music and announcers were pre-recorded. The tapes were shuttled back and forth to the transmitter site on Sawnee Mountain in Cumming. The operations were in a one-room portable building at the base of the tower on top of the mountain. Bad weather made changing the tapes dangerous and difficult.

Jim Pennington was the first General Manager and in the early years Bonnie Voss was the only on-air personality. The station hired Mike Fernandez as the afternoon announcer in 1983. His slot was called &quot;Heading Home with Mike.&quot; Fernandez was instrumental in bringing contemporary Christian music to the station. In 1984, Tim Bagley was hired to do fill in work but later started one of the longest running Christian rock shows in the United States, &quot;Powersource&quot;.

===Music===
In the early history of the station the music was different from the current style. Most of the playlist could be classified as inspirational with some southern gospel artists. The music included such artists as Doug Oldham, George Beverly Shea, The Continental Singers and The Haven of Rest Quartet.

The format was changed to all contemporary in 1985 when Barry Holt became the General Manager. The music aired on the station is selected for its message content. Music makes up most of the 24-hour day, targeted to young and middle-aged listeners, with special emphasis on youth on Saturday night. A couple of hours each day are set aside for Christian talk and teaching.

==Technology==
Victory 91.5 made the switch from https://victory915.com to https://victory.radio on May 9, 2017. The radio station was one of the first to have access to the EBU&#x27;s new gTLD.

<text>WCLK (91.9 FM) – branded as Jazz 91.9 – is a non-commercial jazz radio station licensed to serve Atlanta, Georgia. Owned by Clark Atlanta University, the station covers much of the Atlanta metropolitan area. The WCLK studios are located on the Clark University campus at the Robert W. Woodruff Library, while the station transmitter is located in Atlanta&#x27;s North Druid Hills section. In addition to a standard analog transmission, WCLK broadcasts in HD Radio. and is available online.

==History==
On April 10, 1974, WCLK signed on the air for the first time. Initially, it only broadcast at 54 watts, on a 340-foot tower. Its coverage area only extended a few miles around Clark University, a precursor to Clark Atlanta before its merger with Atlanta University in 1988. Over time, its power and antenna height were upgraded, giving the station a signal that covers all of Atlanta and its adjacent suburbs. WCLK was granted a Federal Communications Commission construction permit in early 2009 to downgrade its effective radiated power (ERP) from 6,000 watts to 480 watts, but its antenna height above average terrain was more than tripled, going to 991 feet from 308 feet, so its overall coverage area remained the same as before.

WCLK previously aired several NPR talk and information shows not heard on Atlanta&#x27;s primary NPR station, WABE, during the time that WABE&#x27;s schedule included daytime broadcasts of classical music. When WABE switched to news and talk for most of the day starting in 2014, WCLK dropped the NPR talk shows to air a schedule of mostly jazz music and related genres, but remains affiliated with NPR for some news and jazz programming.

WCLK collaborated with the City of Atlanta to create the &quot;Jazz of the City Atlanta&quot; portrait featuring over 100 jazz musicians surrounding Mayor Shirley Franklin in the Atlanta City Hall Atrium. The color photograph by Seve &quot;Obasina&quot; Adigun and Gregory Turner, taken in April 2007, mirrors the iconic, classic, black-and-white image, &quot;A Great Day in Harlem&quot; 1958 by Art Kane.

Nationally distributed shows produced at WCLK include &quot;Jazz in the New Millennium&quot; and &quot;The SOUL of Jazz&quot;. Both are distributed by the African-American Public Radio Consortium.

WCLK was relayed by two broadcast translators, whose ranges were entirely within its main broadcast area. Its former six-watt translator W250BC in Riverdale was sold for $100,000 to Extreme Media Group in November 2007, then to commercial broadcaster Cumulus Media in February 2009. WCLK was then relayed by W275BK in Decatur, which broadcast 170 watts on 102.9, owned by the Radio Assist Ministry.

WCLK currently has an FM translator, W209CG, 89.7 MHz in Tallapoosa, Georgia.

<text>WVFJ-FM (93.3 MHz, &quot;The JOY FM&quot;) is a non-commercial radio station licensed to Greenville, Georgia, and serving West-Central Georgia, including portions of Metro Atlanta and the Columbus-Auburn-Opelika area. It is owned by the Radio Training Network with studios and offices in Tyrone. WVFJ broadcasts a Contemporary Christian radio format. Its tower is located in Greenville, off Forest Road. The station broadcasts online and on a network of rebroadcasters and FM translators.

WVFJ-FM is a Class C0 station. It has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 38,000 watts. The tower has a height above average terrain (HAAT) of 491 meters (1,611 ft).

==History==
===WFDR-FM and WQCK===
The station&#x27;s original call sign was WFDR-FM, signing on the air in . It was the sister station to WFDR AM 1370 in Manchester. The call sign was a reference to former U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had his Little White House vacation home in nearby Warm Springs, Georgia.

On October 31, 1981, the station changed its call sign to WQCK. Two years later, it adopted its current call letters of WVFJ-FM on July 7, 1983.

===Christian radio===
On February 13, 1981, Atlanta businessman Bill Watkins and his wife Joyce founded Provident Broadcasting Company in order to create a radio ministry for the benefit of Christians and others seeking spiritual inspiration. WVFJ, which began using the moniker &quot;The JOY FM&quot;, was their first station. It operated as a commercial radio station, selling advertising to support its operations. In 1998, it moved its radio studios from the small community of Manchester into Atlanta radio market as Metro Atlanta&#x27;s first Contemporary Christian station. The transmitter was moved closer to Atlanta to Greenville.

Provident Broadcasting Company was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Watkins Associated Industries, Incorporated. The group&#x27;s stated mission was to provide wholesome family programming filled with joy, hope, and encouragement.

In March 2011, WVFJ became officially owned by Radio Training Network. One of the changes under new ownership was that after 30 years, WVFJ became a non-commercial, listener-supported station instead of selling advertising. In May, WVFJ added 11,000 watts to its effective radiated power.

WVFJ-FM is in a three-way competition for the Christian Contemporary audience in the Atlanta market. Tennessee-based Educational Media Foundation owns both of WVFJ&#x27;s competitors: 106.7 WAKL, part of the non-commercial K-Love network, and 104.7 WAIA, which broadcasts the company&#x27;s other Christian Contemporary network Air1.

===Tower collapse===
On January 12, 2023, WVFJ&#x27;s transmitter tower was destroyed by a tornado. A series of tornados in Georgia and Alabama resulted in seven fatalities and caused millions of dollars in damage.

Radio Training Network worked to restore the tower and get the station back on the air. While the tower was reconstructed, programming continues to be heard on line and on a series of rebroadcasters and FM translators in Georgia and Alabama.

In May 2024, construction of the new tower was completed at the same location as the previous tower, and the station returned to broadcast at full power.

===Translator network===
The station is retransmitted on W270AS 101.9 in Carrollton to the northwest and W231AO 94.1 in Columbus, all located southwest of Atlanta in Western Georgia. It is also listed as the primary station for multiple other translator applications filed by Edgewater Broadcasting in 2003, in what was called the &quot;Great Translator Invasion&quot;.

All of its translators are in Western Georgia and Eastern Alabama. Two translators rebroadcast WVFJ&#x27;s HD Radio digital subchannels, one airing Contemporary worship music and one airing Christian hip hop.

<text>William Wolcott Ellsworth (November 10, 1791 – January 15, 1868) was a Yale-educated attorney who served as the 30th governor of Connecticut, a three-term United States Congressman, a justice of the State Supreme Court.

==Biography==

Born in Windsor on November 10, 1791, Ellsworth was the son of Founding Father Oliver Ellsworth, and son-in-law of Noah Webster, who named Ellsworth executor of his will. His twin brother was Henry Leavitt Ellsworth, first Commissioner of the United States Patent Office. He completed preparatory studies, and graduated from Yale College in 1810. He studied law at Tapping Reeve&#x27;s Litchfield Law School in Litchfield, was afterwards admitted to the bar in 1811.

Among Ellsworth&#x27;s Yale classmates was Samuel F. B. Morse, whose idea of the telegraph would later be championed by Ellsworth&#x27;s twin brother Henry Leavitt Ellsworth during his term as the first Commissioner of the U.S. Patent Office.

On September 14, 1813, he was married to Emily S. Webster, eldest daughter of Rebecca Greenleaf and Noah Webster Jr., publisher of dictionaries. Noah Webster named Ellsworth as one of the executors of his will of 1843.

==Career==
Ellsworth was appointed professor of law at Trinity College in 1827, which position he held until his death. His law partner starting in 1817 was his brother-in-law Chief Justice of the Connecticut Supreme Court Thomas Scott Williams, who was elected to the U.S. Congress that year and sought a younger partner to manage his practice in his absence. (Judge Williams was married to Ellsworth&#x27;s sister.) Aged 26, Ellsworth took up the reins of Congressman Williams&#x27; law practice, the largest in the state.

As an Anti-Jacksonian Ellsworth was elected to the Twenty-first, Twenty-second, and Twenty-third United States Congresses and served from March 4, 1829, to July 8, 1834, when he resigned.

Ellsworth was elected governor of Connecticut 1838–1842. During his tenure, a progressive method for voter registration was constituted and a school commission was founded.

In 1847, Elsworth became judge of the Connecticut Supreme Court and served from 1847 to 1861, when, by the constitutional provision relative to age, he retired. He twice declined to accept the nomination to the United States Senate, and retired from public life.

==Death==
Ellsworth died in Hartford on January 15, 1868. The former Congressman and Governor is interred at the Old North Cemetery in Hartford.

The lawyer and orator Rufus Choate said of Ellsworth before the Massachusetts General Assembly: &quot;If the land of Shermans, Griswolds, Daggets and Williams, rich as she is in learning and virtue, has a sounder lawyer, a more upright magistrate, or an honester man in her public service, I know not his name.&quot;

<text>WSBB-FM (95.5 MHz) is a commercial radio station licensed to Doraville, Georgia, and serving Metro Atlanta. WSBB-FM and co-owned WSB (750 AM) simulcast a news/talk radio format. The stations are owned by the Cox Media Group and are among the highest-billing stations in the U.S. On the air, the two stations are referred to as &quot;95.5 WSB&quot;, only occasionally mentioning the FM station&#x27;s call sign or the AM station&#x27;s frequency.

The studios and offices are on West Peachtree Street NE in Atlanta, in the WSB-TV and Radio Group Building. WSBB-FM has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 100,000 watts, the maximum for most FM stations. The transmitter is on the WSB-FM broadcast tower in Edgewood, just east of Downtown Atlanta. WSBB-FM broadcasts in the HD Radio hybrid format.

==History==
===Early years===
The station first signed on the air on May 1, 1948, as WGAU-FM on 99.5 MHz in Athens, Georgia. It broadcast at 3,600 watts, simulcasting sister station WGAU, still owned by Cox. In 1956, when Channel 11 (now WXIA-TV) came on the air in Atlanta, WGAU-FM created a second harmonic at 199.0, on top of the video carrier of WXIA-TV at 199.25. That caused interference for WXIA-TV, so WGAU-FM got permission from the Federal Communications Commission to move to 102.5 MHz. In 1962, WGAU-FM began broadcasting each day in stereo for six hours, the second station in Georgia to devote a significant part of its day to playing music in stereo. In 1962, WGAU-FM moved to 95.5 FM.

=== Country (1968–1999) ===
In 1968, the station became WNGC, standing for &quot;North Georgia Country&quot;. It was North Georgia&#x27;s first full-time FM country music station and one of the first stand-alone FM country stations in the nation, not simply rebroadcasting a country AM station. WNGC went to a 24 hours a day schedule in 1976 and began broadcasting with an effective radiated power of 100,000 watts from the Neese Tower in Madison County.

===Rhythmic (1999–2010)===

In 1999, Clarke Broadcasting, long-time owner of WNGC and WGAU, wanted to sell its Athens properties. Cox Radio acquired the stations for $78 million. Cox decided to flip WNGC to Top 40, briefly using the WYAP call letters before settling on WBTS, using the moniker &quot;The Beat&quot;.

On September 25, 1999, the country format was dropped and the station began stunting with a loop of &quot;Wild Thing&quot; by Tone-Loc. When &quot;The Beat&quot; officially signed on September 27, its direction focused on mainstream pop, dance, and rock, even though it had a rhythmic lean. Under the direction of Program Director Dale O&#x27;Brian, it would drop all mainstream pop/rock and go rhythmic full-time. The rhythmic direction paid off in the Arbitron ratings, putting them among the top 10 stations in Atlanta. With this hip-hop bent, WBTS competed with WVEE and WHTA, while on the top-40 side it competed with WWWQ and WSTR. With the implementation of Portable People Meters in the Atlanta Arbitrons, WBTS had the second-most listened-to cume in the market behind WVEE.

In October 2005, the station switched its slogan from &quot;Atlanta&#x27;s New #1 Hit Music Station&quot; to &quot;Atlanta&#x27;s New #1 for Hip Hop&quot;. Despite the shift, Cox was still billing the station as rhythmic top 40 (as the station still added rhythmic-friendly pop artists like Pink to its playlist) and continued to report to &quot;R&amp;R&quot;&#x27;s rhythmic reporting panel. Also in 2005, Cox received FCC approval to change WBTS&#x27;s city of license from Athens, a city 40 miles from Atlanta, to Doraville, a suburb of Atlanta; the station&#x27;s studios and transmitter did not move with that change.
In August 2006, the station tapped on-air personality Murph Dawg from WHZT, a Cox station in Greenville to host a new morning show with 6-year Atlanta veteran Stacy C, billing it as &quot;Murph Dawg in the Morning with Stacy C&quot;. The alliance was short-lived, and after only a few months, Murph Dawg found himself solo. In May 2007, WBTS hired a member of WHTA&#x27;s &quot;The A-Team&quot; morning show, CJ. The newly created morning show &quot;Murph Dawg &amp; CJ in the Morning&quot; rose in the 18–34 demographics. In Spring 2008, WBTS hit its highest numbers in station history, with a 6.5 share in 18–34. &quot;Murph Dawg &amp; CJ in the Morning&quot; hit 5th place, with later dayparts reaching the Top 2 and Top 3 ranks. In August 2008, WBTS again pulled a personality from across the street at WHTA, tapping overnight jock and mixer Mami Chula to fill the Night Show position that had been vacant since former night host Austin left in November 2007 for a gig in Indianapolis.

Other personalities that made up the WBTS weekday lineup included K-Dubb in middays, and Maverick in afternoons. Kenny Hamilton, Traci Steele, Johnny D, and Mo Reilley rounded-out the weekend lineup with DJ Kidd handling the primary mix show duties. The station program director was Cagle with Maverick as the assistant program director/music director.

In 2009, WBTS gained another competitor, as Clear Channel&#x27;s WWVA-FM flipped from Spanish contemporary to rhythmic contemporary, becoming &quot;105-7 the Groove&quot;. (WWVA-FM later hired Mami Chula for nights and Maverick for middays and programming duties after WBTS left the rhythmic format.)

===News-talk (2010–present)===

On August 16, 2010, Cox abruptly flipped WBTS to a simulcast of WSB. Cox Radio officials said that the move was necessary to keep WSB, long the dominant radio station in Atlanta, relevant to younger listeners who did not usually listen to AM radio. WBTS&#x27;s DJs and sales staff were offered jobs at other stations in the Cox Atlanta cluster. The callsign was changed to WSBB-FM that October 1, a move made to adjust the callsign to parallel its AM parent (the heritage WSB-FM callsign remains at 98.5 FM).

On July 31, 2019, WSB and WSBB rebranded as &quot;95.5 WSB&quot;. While AM 750 remains the primary signal, all references to it were dropped aside from hourly legal station identification. WSBB-FM began broadcasting from its new transmitter location east of Atlanta on August 20, 2019. Besides a desire to reach younger listeners, WSBB-FM also serves to improve WSB&#x27;s coverage in areas where the AM side&#x27;s daytime signal has usually been weak. WSB&#x27;s daytime coverage area is not nearly as large as that of other 50,000-watt AM stations due to Georgia&#x27;s poor ground conductivity.

WSB&#x27;s Scott Slade hosted &quot;Atlanta&#x27;s Morning News&quot; until February 2023, when he stepped back from full-time hosting. He was succeeded by evening news anchor Chris Chandler, and remains semi-retired as a fill-in host. In April 2023, 31-year morning news host Marcy Williams retired from WSB. She calculated she wrote more than 300,000 radio news stories.

==Programming== 
WSB and WSBB-FM mostly air local news and talk shows. Weekdays begin with &quot;Atlanta&#x27;s Morning News&quot;, anchored by Chris Chandler, Judd Hickenbachem and Cheryl Castro. Airborne traffic reports and weather forecasts are featured every six minutes. Clark Howard provides consumer reports. Middays, afternoons and early evenings feature local talk programs. They include &quot;The Mark Arum Show, The Erick Erickson Show. The Von Haessler Doctrine&quot; hosted by Eric Von Haessler and &quot;The Shelley Wynter Show&quot;. A delayed broadcast of &quot;The Sean Hannity Show&quot; airs at 9 p.m., syndicated via Premiere Networks, with repeats of daytime shows heard overnight. 

Weekends feature shows on gardening, home repair, cars, real estate, health and money, some of which are paid brokered programming. Syndicated weekend shows include &quot;Bill Handel on the Law, The Kim Komando Show, Eye on Travel with Peter Greenberg&quot; and &quot;Face The Nation&quot;. WSB and WSBB-FM are affiliates of CBS News Radio. The stations have a news sharing agreement with WSB-TV. 

WSB and WSBB-FM serve as the flagship radio stations for the University of Georgia Bulldogs Radio Network, carrying all Bulldogs football and basketball games.

<text>A Kiel probe is a device for measuring stagnation pressure or stagnation temperature in fluid dynamics. It is a variation of a Pitot probe where the inlet is protected by a &quot;shroud&quot; or &quot;shield.&quot; Compared to the Pitot probe, it is less sensitive to changes in yaw angle, and is therefore useful when the probe&#x27;s alignment with the flow direction is variable or imprecise.

<text>In chemical thermodynamics, an endergonic reaction (; also called a heat absorbing nonspontaneous reaction or an unfavorable reaction) is a chemical reaction in which the standard change in free energy is positive, and an additional driving force is needed to perform this reaction. In layman&#x27;s terms, the total amount of useful energy is negative (it takes more energy to start the reaction than what is received out of it) so the total energy is a net negative result, as opposed to a net positive result in an exergonic reaction. Another way to phrase this is that useful energy must be absorbed from the surroundings into the workable system for the reaction to happen.

Under constant temperature and constant pressure conditions, this means that the change in the standard Gibbs free energy would be positive,

:formula_1

for the reaction at standard state (i.e. at standard pressure (1 bar), and standard concentrations (1 molar) of all the reagents).

In metabolism, an endergonic process is anabolic, meaning that energy is stored; in many such anabolic processes, energy is supplied by coupling the reaction to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and consequently resulting in a high energy, negatively charged organic phosphate and positive adenosine diphosphate.

== Equilibrium constant ==

The equilibrium constant for the reaction is related to Δ&quot;G&quot;° by the relation:

:formula_2

where &quot;T&quot; is the absolute temperature and &quot;R&quot; is the gas constant. A positive value of Δ&quot;G&quot;° therefore implies

:formula_3

so that starting from molar stoichiometric quantities such a reaction would move backwards toward equilibrium, not forwards.

Nevertheless, endergonic reactions are quite common in nature, especially in biochemistry and physiology. Examples of endergonic reactions in cells include protein synthesis, and the Na+/K+ pump which drives nerve conduction and muscle contraction.

==Gibbs free energy for endergonic reactions==
All physical and chemical systems in the universe follow the second law of thermodynamics and proceed in a downhill, i.e., &quot;exergonic&quot;, direction. Thus, left to itself, any physical or chemical system will proceed, according to the second law of thermodynamics, in a direction that tends to lower the free energy of the system, and thus to expend energy in the form of work. These reactions occur spontaneously.

A chemical reaction is endergonic when non spontaneous. Thus in this type of reaction the Gibbs free energy increases. The entropy is included in any change of the Gibbs free energy. This differs from an endothermic reaction where the entropy is not included. The Gibbs free energy is calculated with the Gibbs–Helmholtz equation:

: formula_4

where:

: = temperature in kelvins (K)
: = change in the Gibbs free energy
: = change in entropy (at 298 K) as formula_5
: = change in enthalpy (at 298 K) as formula_6

A chemical reaction progresses non spontaneously when the Gibbs free energy increases, in that case the is positive. In exergonic reactions the is negative and in endergonic reactions the is positive:

:formula_7 exergonic
:formula_8 endergonic

where formula_9 equals the change in the Gibbs free energy after completion of a chemical reaction.

== Making endergonic reactions happen ==

Endergonic reactions can be achieved if they are either &quot;pulled&quot; or &quot;pushed&quot; by an exergonic (stability increasing, negative change in free energy) process. Of course, in all cases the net reaction of the &quot;total&quot; system (the reaction under study plus the puller or pusher reaction) is exergonic.

=== Pull ===

Reagents can be &quot;pulled&quot; through an endergonic reaction, if the reaction products are cleared rapidly by a subsequent exergonic reaction. The concentration of the products of the endergonic reaction thus always remains low, so the reaction can proceed.

A classic example of this might be the first stage of a reaction which proceeds via a transition state. The process of getting to the top of the activation energy barrier to the transition state is endergonic. However, the reaction can proceed because having reached the transition state, it rapidly evolves via an exergonic process to the more stable final products.

=== Push ===

Endergonic reactions can be &quot;pushed&quot; by coupling them to another reaction which is strongly exergonic, through a shared intermediate.

This is often how biological reactions proceed. For example, on its own the reaction
:formula_10
may be too endergonic to occur. However it may be possible to make it occur by coupling it to a strongly exergonic reaction – such as, very often, the decomposition of ATP into ADP and inorganic phosphate ions, ATP → ADP + Pi, so that
:formula_11
:formula_12
This kind of reaction, with the ATP decomposition supplying the free energy needed to make an endergonic reaction occur, is so common in cell biochemistry that ATP is often called the &quot;universal energy currency&quot; of all living organisms.

<text>WSRV (97.1 FM) – branded 97.1 The River – is a commercial radio station licensed to Gainesville, Georgia, and serving Metro Atlanta. It is owned by the Cox Media Group. WSRV broadcasts a classic rock radio format. The studios and offices are in the Cox Television and Radio Facility on West Peachtree Street near the Brookwood neighborhood of Atlanta.

WSRV has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 100,000 watts. The transmitter tower is off Eagle Ranch Road in Braselton, at the northeastern edge of Metro Atlanta. WSRV uses the HD Radio technology. Its HD2 digital subchannel carries an alternative rock format known as &quot;The Other Side of The River.&quot; The HD3 subchannel simulcasts the talk format on WSB. The HD4 subchannel simulcasts the Latin Pop format on WCHK.

==History==
===Early years===
On November 1, 1965, the station signed on as WWQT. It was the FM counterpart to AM 1580 WLBA Gainesville (now WPGY Ellijay), and were owned by the Hall County Broadcasting Company. WWQT was powered at 100,000 watts but only using a 440-foot tower, so it wasn&#x27;t heard over much of Metro Atlanta.

In 1972, it was bought by Radio Athens, Inc., and would adopt the WFOX call sign. WFOX initially aired a Top 40 format, still targeting the Gainesville area of Northeastern Georgia. In 1983, the station was acquired by Shamrock Broadcasting, which had plans to make it a large market station.

===Move to metro Atlanta===
In 1985, Shamrock moved WFOX&#x27;s tower closer to the more lucrative Atlanta media market, flipped to adult contemporary, and increased their new tower height to 1,550 feet. In 1989, Shamrock was acquired by Chancellor Media. From January 1989 to January 2003, the station aired an oldies format as &quot;Fox 97.&quot;

In 2000, AMFM (the former Chancellor Media) was bought by Clear Channel Communications, which already owned several Atlanta stations. To meet federally mandated ownership limits, Cox Radio acquired the station.

===Cox Radio ownership===
On January 31, 2003, WFOX began stunting by simulcasting several of its sister stations from across the country, including WPYM in Miami, WAPE in Jacksonville, KCCN in Honolulu, KKBQ in Houston, KHPT in Houston, WBLI on Long Island, WHZT in Upstate South Carolina, KINE in Honolulu and WDYL in Richmond.

On February 3, 2003, WFOX switched to an uptempo Urban AC format as &quot;97.1 Jamz.&quot; At first, the station ran with no DJs. Because co-owned WALR-FM (&quot;Kiss 104.1&quot;) was so popular in the Atlanta market playing a more traditional Urban AC format, &quot;Jamz&quot; primarily aired &#x27;80s/&#x27;90s R&amp;B, hip-hop and current songs, targeting primarily 25- to 39-year-olds. The station&#x27;s main competitors were WVEE and WHTA, with whom it competed for the coveted 18 to 34 demographic, the same demo that rhythmic contemporary-formatted sister station WBTS targeted.

===Classic hits===
On January 1, 2006, the station flipped to &quot;97.1 The River,&quot; with a mix of classic hits and classic rock, targeting people ages 25–54. The playlist was familiar and hit-oriented, like most classic hits stations, but leaned towards primarily rock songs from the late 1960s, 70s and 80s, with no pop or dance music.

On April 17, 2006, WFOX changed its own call sign to WSRV, to match the &quot;River&quot; moniker, which is a nod to the Chattahoochee River. The WFOX call letters would move to another Cox Radio station, the former WEFX, in Norwalk, Connecticut.

===Classic rock===
WSRV would later move to a more standard classic rock playlist, even though it still identifies itself on the air as &quot;Classic Hits.&quot; In addition, WSRV plays a few 1990s titles but no 2000s music. &quot;Rock Blocks,&quot; which feature three songs in a row from the same artist/group, sometimes including deep cuts and live material, are featured during the day and on weekends.

On June 19, 2006, Lexie Kaye became the River&#x27;s first female, on-air personality doing mornings solo every weekday from 5:30 am–8:30 am. Lexie was the only live on-air personality for the River, doing all remote broadcasts and concert promotions. Chris Miller was the program director for WSRV - FM.

In October 2011, rock singer Eddie Money became the host of “Money in the Morning,” an experiment that lasted about three months.

In September 2013, WSRV upgraded to an interactive radio station. Listeners can control the music by like/dislike the songs, and record themselves then send it to be played on the air. Whatever song has the most likes when the previous one finishes is next to play.

WSRV is currently broadcasting digital radio using the HD Radio system, and features adult alternative rock on its HD-2 channel branded as &quot;The Other Side of The River&quot;. Both stations stream live via WSRV&#x27;s website.

==Signal==
WSRV&#x27;s city of license is Gainesville, Georgia, in Hall County. Its transmitter is in the southern tip of Hall County, just across the line from Braselton. WSRV can be considered a &quot;move-in&quot; station, since it originally concentrated on the Gainesville area. While still licensed to that city, its transmitter moved closer to Atlanta to target the larger Atlanta market.

WSRV&#x27;s broadcast range covers almost all of Northeast Georgia, even heard in a tiny portion of Upstate South Carolina. Other cities covered include Athens, Cartersville, Roswell and Toccoa. Depending on radio propagation conditions, with a good radio and antenna, the station can be picked up as far away as Knoxville, Tennessee, and at times, Greenville, South Carolina. Due to WSRV&#x27;s transmitter location, listeners may have some trouble picking up the signal in Atlanta suburbs south and west of the city. The station has asked the FCC to downgrade to Class C0 while moving its transmitter even closer to Atlanta.

==Broadcast translators==
WSRV&#x27;s HD2 digital subchannel carries &quot;The Other Side of the River,&quot; an alternative rock format. It feeds two FM translators: W249CK FM 97.7 in Duluth (transmitting with 75 watts), and W228CA FM 93.5 Suwanee, transmitting with 230 watts. The translators are heard mainly in Gwinnett and adjacent northeast metro counties.

WSRV was previously the primary station for W243CE 96.5 FM, a translator in Winder, Georgia. Licensed for just five watts of effective radiated power, it is owned by Davis Broadcasting of Atlanta. It was originally permitted in 2004 and started in 2007 by Radio Assist Ministry, a company that speculatively filed for thousands of translator stations and then rented or resold them for profit.

The station had a construction permit to move to the WSRV/WSBB radio tower, increase to the maximum translator power of 250 watts, and exponentially increase its height from 4 to . This would give it the broadcast range of a Class A station. Following a change in rules by the FCC, W243CE was instead moved all the way to Columbus, Georgia, in the west central part of the state, to give an FM signal to WOKS (AM 1340).

On April 16, 2018, WSRV-HD3 began simulcasting on translator W222AF 92.3 FM Marietta with an urban contemporary format, branded as &quot;Power 92.3 Jamz.&quot; Cox removed the W222AF programming in December 2018, due to a dispute with the programmer who was leasing the translator from its owner.

<text>Gallia Belgica (&quot;Belgic Gaul&quot;) was a province of the Roman Empire located in the north-eastern part of Roman Gaul, in what is today primarily northern France, Belgium, and Luxembourg, along with parts of the Netherlands and Germany.

Before the Roman province came into existence in about 50 BC, the region was conquered by Julius Caesar during his Gallic Wars. His report, the &quot;Commentarii de Bello Gallico&quot;, described Belgic Gaul as one of the three parts of Gaul (Tres Galliæ), the other two being Gallia Aquitania and Gallia Lugdunensis. Belgica stretched from the Marne and Seine rivers, which Caesar described as a cultural boundary between the Belgae and the Celtic Gauls. In the north and east it stretched all the way to the Rhine. The official Roman province of this name was later created by emperor Augustus in 22 BC, and named after the Belgae, as the largest tribal confederation in the area. However, it also included the territories of the Treveri, Mediomatrici, Leuci, Sequani, and others who Caesar did not explicitly designate as Belgic.

The province was re-organised several times, first increased and later decreased in size. Diocletian brought the northeastern Civitas Tungrorum into Germania Inferior, joining the Rhineland colonies. The remaining part of Gallia Belgica was divided into Belgica Prima (in the eastern area of the Treveri, Mediomatrici and Leuci, around Luxembourg and the Ardennes), and Belgica Secunda (between the English Channel and the upper Meuse).

The capital of Belgica Prima, Trier, became an important late western Roman capital.


==Roman conquest==

In 57 BC, Julius Caesar led the conquest of northern Gaul, and already specified that the part to the north of the Seine and Marne rivers was inhabited by a people or alliance known as the Belgae. This definition became the basis of the later Roman province of Belgica. Caesar said that the Belgae were separated from the Celtic Gauls to their south by &quot;language, custom and laws&quot; (&quot;lingua, institutis, legibus&quot;) but he did not go into detail, except to mention that he learnt from his contacts that the Belgae had some ancestry from east of the Rhine, which he referred to as Germania. Indeed, the Belgian tribes closest to the Rhine he distinguished as the Germani cisrhenani. (Strabo stated that the differences between the Celts and Belgae, in language, politics and way of life was a small one.) Modern historians interpret Caesar and the archaeological evidence as indicating that the core of the Belgian alliance was in the present-day northernmost corner of France; the Suessiones, Viromandui and Ambiani as well perhaps as some of their neighbours who lived in the area, Caesar identified as Belgium or Belgica. These were the leaders of the initial military alliance he confronted, and they were also more economically advanced (and therefore less &quot;Germanic&quot; according to Caesar&#x27;s way of seeing things) than many of their more northerly allies such as the Nervii and Germani Cisrhenani.

Apart from the southern Remi, all the Belgic tribes allied against the Romans, angry at the Roman decision to garrison legions in their territory during the winter. At the beginning of the conflict, Caesar reported the allies&#x27; combined strength at 288,000, led by the Suessione king, Galba. Due to the Belgic coalition&#x27;s size and reputation for uncommon bravery, Caesar avoided meeting the combined forces of the tribes in battle. Instead, he used cavalry to skirmish with smaller contingents of tribesmen. Only when Caesar managed to isolate one of the tribes did he risk conventional battle. The tribes fell in a piecemeal fashion and Caesar claimed to offer lenient terms to the defeated, including Roman protection from the threat of surrounding tribes. Most tribes agreed to the conditions. A series of uprisings followed the 57 BC conquest. The largest revolt was led by the Bellovaci in 52 BC, after the defeat of Vercingetorix. During this rebellion, it was the Belgae who avoided direct conflict. They harassed the Roman legions, led personally by Caesar, with cavalry detachments and archers. The rebellion was put down after a Bellovaci ambush of the Romans failed. The revolting party was slaughtered.

==Formation under Augustus==
Following a census of the region in 27 BC, Augustus ordered a restructuring of the provinces in Gaul. Therefore, in 22 BC, Marcus Agrippa split Gaul (or Gallia Comata) into three regions (Gallia Aquitania, Gallia Lugdunensis and Gallia Belgica). Agrippa made the divisions on what he perceived to be distinctions in language, race and community – Gallia Belgica was meant to be a mix of Celtic and Germanic peoples. The capital of this territory was Reims, according to the geographer Strabo, though later the capital moved to modern-day Trier. The date of this move is uncertain.

Modern historians however view the term &#x27;Gaul&#x27; and its subdivisions as a &quot;product of faulty ethnography&quot; and see the split of Gallia Comata into three provinces as an attempt to construct a more efficient government, as opposed to a cultural division. Successive Roman emperors struck a balance between Romanizing the people of Gallia Belgica and allowing pre-existing culture to survive.

The Romans divided the province into four &quot;civitates&quot;, corresponding generally to ancient tribal boundaries. The capital cities of these districts included modern Cassel (replaced by Tournai as Menapian &quot;civitas&quot;), Bavay (replaced by Cambrai as Nervian &quot;civitas&quot;), Thérouanne, Arras, Saint-Quentin, Soissons, Reims, Beauvais, Amiens, Tongeren, Trier, Toul and Metz. These &quot;civitates&quot; were in turn were divided into smaller units, pagi, a term that became the French word &quot;pays&quot;.

Roman government was run by Concilia in Reims or Trier. Additionally, local notables from Gallia Belgica were required to participate in a festival in Lugdunum (modern Lyon), which typically celebrated or worshipped the emperor&#x27;s genius. The gradual adoption of Romanized names by local elites and the Romanization of laws under local authority demonstrate the effectiveness of this concilium Galliarum. With that said, the concept and community of Gallia Belgica did not predate the Roman province, but developed from it.

==Under the emperors==

===Reform of Domitian (around 90)===
During the 1st century AD (estimated date 90 AD), the provinces of Gaul were restructured. Emperor Domitian reorganized the provinces in order to separate the militarized zones of the Rhine from the civilian populations of the region. The northeastern part of Gallia Belgica was split off and renamed Germania Inferior, later to be reorganized and renamed as Germania Secunda. This included the eastern part of modern Belgium, the southernmost part of the modern Netherlands, and a part of modern Germany. The eastern part was split off to become Germania Superior (parts of western Germany and eastern France) and the southern border of Gallia Belgica was extended to the south. The newer Gallia Belgica included the cities of &quot;Camaracum&quot; (Cambrai), &quot;Nemetacum&quot; (Arras), &quot;Samarobriva&quot; (Amiens), &quot;Durocortorum&quot; (Reims), &quot;Dividorum&quot; (Metz) and &quot;Augusta Treverorum&quot; (Trier).

===Attack by the Chauci (173)===
In 173, the later emperor Didius Julianus, then governor of Gallia Belgica, had to repel a serious invasion of the Chauci, a Germanic tribe that lived along the shores of the Wadden Sea at the respective northern and northwestern coast of present-day Netherlands and Germany. The attack occurred in the drainage basin of the river Scheldt (present-day Flanders and Hainaut). Archaeologists have found evidence that large farms near Tournai and the village Velzeke (near Ghent) had to be abandoned. Further the capitals in the areas of the former tribes of the Atrebates, Morini and the Nervians were either burnt down (Nemetacum (Arras)) or had to be rebuilt in the last quarter of the second century, Colonia Morinorum (Thérouanne) and Bagacum Nerviorum (Bavay).

===Crisis of the 3rd century and Gallic Empire===
With the Crisis of the Third Century and the partition of the Empire, Roman control over Gaul deteriorated in the 3rd century. In 260, Postumus became emperor of a breakaway Gallic Empire. He proved able to stop the incursions from the Franks. Only in 274 was Roman control restored by the new emperor Aurelian in the Battle of Châlons. The cost of this defeat in the long run proved very high indeed. With the Gallic army defeated and not returning to the Rhine border, the Franks overran the neighbouring province of Germania Inferior. The Rhineland (to the Ripuarian Franks) and the area between the Rhine and the main road between Boulogne and Cologne, present-day South Holland, Zeeland, Flanders, Brabant and Limburg, the last three in both the present-day Netherlands and Belgium (to the Salian Franks) were de facto lost forever for the Roman empire. This gave the Salian Franks a base from which they could expand some 130 years later, beginning after the disastrous Rhine crossing in 406, to conquer the whole area of the former province of Gallia Belgica and start the Merovingian kingdom.

===Reform of Diocletian (around 300)===
Emperor Diocletian restructured the provinces around 300, and split Belgica into two provinces: Belgica Prima and Belgica Secunda. Belgica Prima had &quot;Augusta Treverorum&quot; (Trier) as its main city, and consisted of the eastern part. The border between Belgica Prima and Belgica Secunda was approximately along the Meuse.

===Prosperous fourth century===
The eastern part of Gallia Belgica, especially the valley of the Moselle became very prosperous in the fourth century, particularly in the decades that &quot;Augusta Treverorum&quot; (Trier) was the capital of the Western Roman Empire. The Roman poet Ausonius wrote a famous poem on the Mosella.

==Germanic conquests (after 406)==
Around 350 Salian Franks who were already living in Batavia were settled in Texandria. Texandria was most likely for a large part overlapping with the area now known as the Kempen. 
Eventually, in 406, a large alliance among the Vandals, Alans and Suebi, under great pressure from the Huns, after first having been defeated by the Ripuarian Franks in the neighbourhood of Cologne in Germania Inferior, successfully crossed the Rhine in the neighbourhood of present-day Koblenz and entered Gallia Belgica by way of the Moselle valley. They subsequently destroyed large parts of Gallia Belgica, before eventually moving on to Hispania (present-day Spain). This invasion and the accompanying widespread destruction broke the backbone of Roman power in at least the northern part of Gallia Belgica. After this invasion the Franks were able to conquer valuable agricultural land south of the Via Belgica, the very important main road between Cologne and Boulogne, that had been the backbone of Roman defense strategy between 260 and 406.

In 452, a major battle was fought at the Catalaunian fields (between the Seine and the Moselle). A coalition of Romans, Visigoths and Franks fought an army led by the legendary Hunnic leader Attila. The outcome of this battle itself was inconclusive, but as a consequence of this battle the Huns and their allies left the area of Gallia Belgica, where they had plundered nearly all major cities, except Paris.

After the Western Roman Empire had already collapsed in Galla Belgica for some time the Gallo-Roman &quot;Kingdom of Soissons&quot; (457–486) managed to maintain control over the area around Soissons. The Franks however emerged victorious and Belgica Secunda in the 5th century became the center of Clovis&#x27; Merovingian kingdom. During the 8th century in the Carolingian Empire the former area of Gallia Belgica was split into Neustria (roughly Belgica Secunda, main cities Paris, Reims) and Austrasia (roughly Belgica Prima and Germania Inferior, main cities Trier, Metz, Cologne). After the death of Charlemagne&#x27;s son, Louis the Pious, the Carolingian Empire was divided by the Treaty of Verdun in 843. The three sons of Louis the Pious divided his territories into three kingdoms: East Francia (the forerunner of modern Germany), West Francia (west of the Scheldt river) a part of which (Ile de France), from the middle of the 10th century became the kernel of modern France, and Middle Francia which was succeeded by Lotharingia. Though often presented as the dissolution of the Frankish empire, it was in fact the continued adherence to Salic patrimony. Lotharingia was divided in 870 by the Treaty of Meerssen under West and East Francia.
==Legacy==
 
The name &quot;Belgica&quot; continued to be used in the Low Countries as the Latin language name of the entire territory until the modern period. In the 1500s, the Seventeen Provinces were then divided into the independent Belgica Foederata or the &quot;federal&quot; Dutch Republic and the Belgica Regia or the &quot;royal&quot; Southern Netherlands under the Habsburgian crown. &quot;Belgica Foederata&quot; continued to be used from 1581 up to the French Revolution. Even after that, the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, created in 1815 was still known as &quot;Royaume des Belgiques&quot;, and it was only with the 1831 separatist revolution in the south of the country and subsequent creation of modern Belgium and Dutch recognition of the new nation in the Treaty of London (1839) that the name became reserved for Belgium to the exclusion of the Netherlands.

<text>WUMJ (97.5 FM, &quot;Majic 107.5/97.5&quot;) is a radio station simulcasting an urban adult contemporary format with sister station WAMJ 107.5 FM. Licensed to the suburb of Fayetteville, Georgia, it serves the Atlanta metropolitan area. It first began broadcasting in 1978 under the call sign WKUE-FM. The station is currently owned by Radio One of Atlanta, through licensee Radio One Licenses, LLC. Since 1995, it has always been an urban station taking on three variations of the format due to frequency swaps in 2001 and 2009.

==History==
The station was originally assigned the WKUE-FM call sign on December 4, 1978 on 97.7 FM. On September 3, 1990, the call sign was changed to WQUL as &quot;Kool 97.7 FM&quot;.

===Mainstream urban (1995–2001)===
When Griffin, then-owner of the station, upgraded to a class C3 station on July 17, 1995, its tower was moved closer to Atlanta and moved down to the 97.5 FM frequency. The format was changed to Mainstream Urban with the new callsign, WHTA. At the launch, then-&quot;Hot 97.5&quot; was the first urban station in Atlanta to feature hip hop and rap music in regular rotation, given the fact that hip hop and rap music on radio was still a niche genre at the time for Atlanta in spite of its major African American presence in the audience and the music culture. WHTA became the second permanent urban competitor behind WALR to challenge heritage station WVEE, although that station was primarily R&amp;B/Soul-oriented until it incorporated hip hop full-time in 2000. (Former competitor WBTS did not compete directly with WHTA until 2001 when it gravitated its top 40 format from pop to rhythmic, two years after it launched.) Thus, it was the only pure hip hop and R&amp;B station based in Atlanta for the first five years on the air.

While the station was an initial moderate success among the young adult audience in the region (especially inner-city Atlanta), WHTA suffered a setback with its signal coverage. Due to the transmitter location being based in Tyrone and a smaller signal wattage, it was barely audible in the northern portions of Atlanta beyond the downtown area. When Radio One took over operations later on, there were plans to give WHTA a simulcast on 107.5 as WTHA until the new owners changed their minds instead and launched its adult urban format there as WAMJ. (This was the original incarnation of &quot;Majic 107.5&quot;.) This led morning show host Ryan Cameron (now hosting mornings at WVEE) to lobby for a frequency change for WHTA by putting together a petition from listeners at the risk of losing his job under Radio One&#x27;s management. It proved successful, and thus on November 1, 2001, owner Radio One finally moved the radio format and the WHTA call letters to the stronger 107.9 as &quot;Hot 107.9&quot; where it still airs today.

===Urban gospel (2001–2009)===
After WHTA relocated to 107.9, 97.5 FM relaunched as urban gospel station &quot;Praise 97.5&quot; with the call sign WEGF originally until December 5, 2001 when the call sign was again changed to WPZE. This was one of the earliest Radio One gospel stations marked with the &quot;Praise&quot; nickname which spread to its other stations over the course of the decade. In March 2007, WPZE began to carry the Yolanda Adams Morning Show based out of Houston via sister KROI-FM, although that station has since been moved to a subchannel of KMJQ in that same city. In 2008, WPZE went on to become the flagship for the locally based CoCo Brother Live Show, which airs in the early nighttime. CoCo Brother originally worked at WHTA before landing the show, and also hosts &quot;Lift Every Voice&quot; on BET. On February 16, 2009, the Praise branding moved to 102.5.

===Urban adult contemporary (2009–2016)===
After WPZE relocated to 102.5, the 97.5 frequency changed to a simulcast of Majic 107.5 with the new callsign WUMJ. This would also result in the end of smooth jazz music on 107.5 (then WJZZ) as the WAMJ call sign relocated back to that frequency to reincarnate the &quot;Majic&quot; branding there.

===Classic hip hop (2016)===
On January 10, 2016, WUMJ broke from the &quot;Majic&quot; simulcast and began simulcasting translator W275BK&#x27;s classic hip hop format as &quot;Boom 102.9/97.5&quot;. The change is coordinated with the debut of the syndicated Ed Lover Show in mornings starting on the 11th on Radio One&#x27;s classic hip-hop stations. The addition of WUMJ increases Boom&#x27;s coverage to the south of Atlanta, including the Peachtree City and Newnan areas. General Manager Tim Davies stated in a press release that most of Majic&#x27;s audience moved over to 107.5 following the upgrade of its signal three years ago, making 97.5 expendable.

===Urban adult contemporary (2016–present)===
On July 29, 2016 WUMJ returned to a simulcast of urban adult contemporary-formatted Majic 107.5.

<text>WNSY (100.1 FM) is a commercial radio station in northwest Georgia, licensed to Talking Rock. It is owned by Davis Broadcasting of Atlanta and it simulcasts WWWE on 1100 kHz in Hapeville. The two stations, along with an Atlanta FM translator station at 101.1 MHz, simulcast a smooth jazz radio format. The stations use the dial position of the translator, calling themselves &quot;101.1 WJZA.&quot;

WNSY&#x27;s transmitter is near Jasper, Georgia, about 50 miles north of metro Atlanta. Its broadcast range is most of northwest Georgia, but too far from Atlanta to be heard in the city and its close-in suburbs.

==History==
The station&#x27;s construction permit was applied for from the Federal Communications Commission in 1995. It went on the air as WCHK-FM in 1998. The original WCHK-FM 105.5 is now WBZY 105.7 and owned by iHeartMedia. The station at 100.1 became oldies Sunny 100 in 1999.

In January 2007, Davis Broadcasting of Columbus, Georgia, completed the purchase of WNSY and WCHK. WNSY, Sunny 100 went off the air on the morning of January 22, 2007, and returned on February 1 with the simulcast of WLKQ, carrying Regional Mexican programming.

Listeners to Sunny 100 were surprised by the loss of the station. For the next 14 months, only two FM stations in Northwest Georgia carried any sort of oldies genre: WATG &quot;95.7 The Ridge&quot; in Rome and WSRV &quot;97.1 The River&quot; in Atlanta, both under the classic hits format.

==The original WCHK-FM==
McClure owned the original WCHK-FM, which was located at 105.5 FM and broadcast a locally oriented format that was a mix of country and Southern Gospel music. It was a simulcast of WCHK AM 1290, the original station of Cherokee Broadcasting, named for Cherokee County, Georgia. The CHK in turn stands for Cherokee.

In 1991 the station received FCC approval to upgrade to a much stronger signal and move to the 105.7 frequency, allowing it to be heard throughout the metro Atlanta media market. This moved the station from its allotment on Bear Mountain near Waleska, to the new tower next to Interstate 575 in Holly Springs, Georgia. (It has since moved to Sweat Mountain, even closer to Atlanta.)

The station remained under local management for a little over a year, briefly as &quot;North Metro&#x27;s K-105&quot;, then with a revamped format as &quot;Atlanta&#x27;s Classic Country 105.7&quot;. In 1993 the frequency was leased by local marketing agreement (LMA) to Jacor (which would later merge with Clear Channel) and simulcasted WGST AM 640 under the WGST-FM callsign, especially since that station was extremely difficult to receive at night even locally. In 2000, Clear Channel abandoned the WGST simulcast, and the station became WMXV &quot;Mix 105.7&quot;.

In 2003, when then WFOX (now WSRV) FM 97.1 abandoned its oldies format, Clear Channel picked up the format, becoming WLCL &quot;Cool 105.7&quot;. For the next year, Cherokee Broadcasting was the legal owner of the licenses of two oldies stations in the same area, WNSY and WLCL (although Cherokee Broadcasting only operated WNSY). The 105.7 frequency was sold outright to Clear Channel in 2004, and oldies was abandoned on 105.7 in May 2005.

<text>WNNX (100.5 FM) is a commercial radio station licensed to College Park, Georgia, featuring a classic alternative format as &quot;99X&quot;. Owned by Cumulus Media, the station serves the Atlanta metropolitan area. WNNX&#x27;s studios are located in Sandy Springs, while the transmitter resides atop the Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel in Downtown Atlanta. In addition to a standard analog transmission, WNNX is available online.

==History==
===Moving from Alabama===
The 100.5 frequency has been in metro Atlanta, licensed to College Park, since early 2001. Before then, the station was licensed to Anniston, Alabama, as WHMA-FM. It started out as a simulcast of WHMA (1400 AM). WHMA-AM-FM were network affiliates of ABC. In the 1970s, WHMA-FM began airing its own country music format as &quot;Alabama 100.&quot; (After the move, that call sign shifted to another existing station in Alabama, becoming 95.3 WHMA-FM &quot;The Big 95&quot; in Alexandria.)

Interested in moving the station to the more lucrative Atlanta radio market, owner Robert Gammon proposed that WHMA-FM be re-licensed to Sandy Springs. It would remain at 100,000 watts effective radiated power (ERP) as a Class C station. An agreement had already been made with the nearest co-channel station, WSSL-FM in upstate South Carolina for it to move its transmitter a bit further from Atlanta. However that station was sold to Clear Channel Communications in the interim and the agreement was negated. Additionally, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruled that Sandy Springs was &quot;not a community&quot;, citing its unincorporated status and letters of support from local organizations in Sandy Springs that had &quot;Atlanta&quot; as their addresses. At that time, Sandy Springs was part of unincorporated Fulton County, before it became an incorporated city in 2006.

After exhausting his funds in pursuit of the reallocation, Gammon sold WHMA-FM to Susquehanna Radio. In a revised application before the FCC, Susquehanna proposed a different city of license, College Park. The FCC approved the application, mostly because the new application downgraded the class of the station from C (up to 100 kW at 600 meters or 1,968 feet) to C3 (up to 25 kW at 100 meters or 328 feet) to protect the licensed broadcast range of WSSL-FM. Susquehanna was also forced to slightly null the station&#x27;s signal away from the direction of WSSL-FM, to stay in compliance with spacing rules. When it went on the air in Atlanta, the station had an effective radiated power of 3,000 watts, using the Turner Broadcasting tower, which gave it a height above average terrain (HAAT) of less than 1,000 feet.

The move created spectrum space for two new radio stations in Alabama, but forced two low-power stations off the air: Southern Polytechnic State University low-power station WGHR and Georgia Public Broadcasting FM translator W264AE, both on 100.7 MHz.

===Q100 (2001–2008)===
The first format for 100.5 FM in Atlanta was Top 40 station WWWQ (&quot;Q100&quot;), which made its debut on January 23, 2001. It was the first mainstream Top 40 outlet in Atlanta since WAPW flipped to alternative as WNNX in October 1992, as well as a brief stint on WBTS when it debuted in 1999. Despite its 3,000 watt signal, Q100 often received higher Arbitron listenership ratings than several of its 100,000-watt competitors, including sister station 99X.

Susquehanna continued to pursue a larger signal for the station, eventually earning approval from the FCC to go from Class C3 to Class C2. The upgrade occurred on October 24, 2005 at 5:00 PM, when the station moved from the Turner Broadcasting tower to the Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel. WWWQ was now powered at 12,500 watts, using a tower that better covered the Atlanta market. In 2006, Cumulus Media acquired Susquehanna, including both 99X and Q100.

===Rock 100.5 (2008–2022)===

On January 11, 2008, Cumulus announced that Q100 would move to the 100,000-watt signal at 99.7 MHz, replacing &quot;99X&quot;, on January 25. The transition began on January 21, when WWWQ&#x27;s &quot;The Bert Show&quot; was simulcast on both stations. (99X&#x27;s morning show was cancelled the week before.) 99X signed off on 99.7 FM/HD1 and moved to 99.7-HD2, with Q100 moving to 99.7 FM/HD1, at 5:30 a.m. on January 25. On the same day, at 6 a.m., 100.5 began stunting, first with Beyoncé Knowles singing &quot;To the Left&quot; (from her song &quot;Irreplaceable&quot;) and morning show host Bert Weiss redirecting listeners to the new frequency. At 10 a.m., the stunting then switched to a loop where eight different formats were presented, with listeners having the option to call the station and vote on which was their favorite. On January 28, 2008, at 5:45 a.m., The Regular Guys announced the debut of &quot;Rock 100.5&quot;, carrying a radio format similar to their previous station WKLS (formerly &quot;96 Rock&quot;), which itself changed formats to active rock as &quot;Project 9-6-1&quot;. Rock 100.5&#x27;s first song was &quot;Baba O&#x27; Riley&quot; by The Who. WWWQ and WNNX swapped call signs the following day.

In 2010, WNNX became the FM flagship radio station of the Atlanta Braves for that season through 2013, along with WCNN, which continues carrying the team&#x27;s games to this day. The rights were moved to then-sister station WYAY starting with the 2014 season. After WYAY was sold to the Educational Media Foundation in 2019, WNNX resumed carrying Braves broadcasts. In 2022, WNNX once again dropped their Braves affiliation.

Throughout the station&#x27;s existence, WNNX has shifted among different genres of rock. When &quot;Rock 100.5&quot; first launched, the station aired a predominantly album-oriented rock format. In April 2009, the station began leaning towards adult album alternative. In 2010, the station shifted back to its broad-based AOR format, which lasted until late 2011, when the station shifted towards classic rock. Ratings for the station at that time were shaky, as the station usually pulled between a 1.5 and 2 share.

WNNX returned to a mainstream rock direction in 2012, following the flips of WKLS from active rock to Top 40/CHR and WZGC from adult album alternative to sports in the Fall of that year.

====Merger with &quot;98-9 The Bone&quot;====
On January 28, 2013, WNNX and sister station W255CJ (&quot;98-9 The Bone&quot;) began promoting changes to the two stations on their Facebook and Twitter pages, promoting a &quot;bigger and better change&quot; to come starting February 1. There were rumors that Cumulus&#x27; Atlanta management was planning a merger of the two formats on one frequency, presumably on 100.5.

The official change took place on that Friday, February 1, at Midnight, when 98.9 and 100.5 began simulcasting. At 10 AM, the official relaunch took place, as WNNX shifted to active rock. The first song after the relaunch was &quot;Chalk Outline&quot; by Three Days Grace. The simulcast lasted until February 4 at Noon, when 98.9 flipped to a new format, Christian country, under the name &quot;The Walk.&quot;

====&quot;Atlanta&#x27;s Classic Rock&quot;====
After broadcasting an active rock format for barely a year, the station shifted back to classic rock on January 3, 2014, now competing with Cox Media Group&#x27;s WSRV. WNNX&#x27;s playlist was similar to what it was in 2012, prior to its shift to active rock.

====&quot;Atlanta&#x27;s Rock Station&quot;====
The station&#x27;s next format adjustment began in mid-2016 with a slogan tweak to &quot;Atlanta&#x27;s Rock Station.&quot; No personnel changes were made, and the music was slightly updated to focusing more on chart topping rock hits between the 1980s, 1990s, and recurrent releases, including the grunge era of rock played more. This format direction helped increase the station&#x27;s ratings. On August 30, 2019, WNNX shifted back to an active rock lean in their mainstream rock format.

===99X on 100.5 (2022–present)===
On December 1, 2022, WNNX dropped &quot;Elliot in the Morning&quot; after eight months. The next day, at 5 p.m., after playing &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; by Metallica, WNNX dropped the rock format and began stunting with a loop of &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; by The Verve, with sweepers stating &quot;It&#x27;s coming, same as it ever was. Monday morning, 6 a.m.&quot; The stunt was likely an allusion to the anniversary of a stunt pulled by former 99X DJ Sean Demery in October 1997, when he garnered local attention after playing the song in a similar loop shortly after its release. At the promised time, WNNX flipped to classic alternative as &quot;99X”, marking the return of the 99X brand to a full powered signal for the first time since 2008. The first song on the revived &quot;99X&quot; was &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; by The Buggles, the same song that had launched the original incarnation 30 years prior. A letter on the station&#x27;s website and Twitter page declared that the station&#x27;s full-staffed launch had been set for January 3, 2023, effectively making the interim period a soft launch of the format; while there had been no official confirmation from Cumulus or the station at the time of launch, Cumulus hired several original station staffers for the station&#x27;s new incarnation, including Steve Barnes, Leslie Fram, Steve Craig, Will Pendarvis, Jill, and Matt ‘Organic’ Jones.

<text>WAIA (104.7 FM, &quot;Air1&quot;) is a non-commercial radio station licensed to Athens, Georgia, and serving Metro Atlanta. The station is owned by the Salem Media Group; a sale to the Educational Media Foundation (EMF) is pending. It airs EMF&#x27;s contemporary worship music network Air1.

The transmitter is on the tallest radio tower in Georgia, located off Piney Grove Road in Loganville, about east of Atlanta. The height above average terrain (HAAT) of this tower allows the station to better penetrate office buildings in Atlanta. The effective radiated power (ERP) is 24,000 watts, making it a class C1 station.

==History==

=== WDOL/WJSR ===
In January 1964, the station signed on as WDOL-FM. It was the FM counterpart of WDOL (1470 AM, now WXAG). Both stations were owned by James S. Rivers, who served as the president. Because WDOL was a daytimer, WDOL-FM simulcasted the AM station&#x27;s country music format during the day and continued on its own after sunset when WDOL had to be off the air. WDOL-FM was powered at only 3,500 watts, limiting its signal to Athens and adjacent communities, not hitting the larger Atlanta radio market.

In the 1970s, the station got a boost to 50,000 watts. As more people acquired FM radios, WDOL-FM switched its call sign to WJSR in 1974 and aired a progressive rock format, while co-owned WDOL continued as a country outlet.

=== WAGQ ===
In 1976, WJSR was acquired by Broadcast Properties, Inc. The station flipped to Top 40/CHR, as WAGQ, and became an affiliate of the ABC Contemporary Network. Even though the station had a 50,000 watt signal on a 230 foot tower, it was still limited to serving Athens and its surrounding towns.

In the mid-1980s, WAGQ asked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a construction permit to double its power to 100,000 watts and greatly increase its antenna height to over , using a tower closer to Atlanta. This would make WAGQ a &quot;move-in station&quot;, serving the more lucrative Atlanta market. The FCC granted the request, making WAGQ a Class C1 station.

=== WALR ===
In 1989, the station was sold to Ring Radio, Inc., which also owned WCNN. &quot;Music Radio 104.7&quot; debuted, with a hot adult contemporary format. The station switched its call sign to WALR in July 1990.

On October 8, 1990, WALR-FM was relaunched with an urban adult contemporary format as &quot;Love 104.7&quot;, then later on as &quot;Kiss 104.7&quot;. This was the second incarnation of the &quot;Kiss&quot; branding, after it was previously used in the mid-1980s on WEKS (the former call sign on 104.1). Under this format, it was the first permanent competitor to attempt to chip away at the African-American audience enjoyed by heritage urban station WVEE.

=== WFSH-FM ===
On August 30, 2000, WALR and its adult urban format moved to 104.1, now known as &quot;Kiss 104.1&quot;, to make room for Christian contemporary &quot;104.7 the Fish&quot;. The swap was part of an asset exchange between Cox Media Group and Salem Communications.

WFSH-FM hosted &quot;Celebrate Freedom Atlanta&quot; each year on Labor Day weekend. The free outdoor concert featured 15 to 20 artists and took place at Jim R. Miller Park in Marietta, Georgia. The concert had an attendance of 42,000 its first year in 2007.

=== WAIA ===
In December 2024, it was announced that WFSH-FM, along with all Salem Media-owned Christian Contemporary stations, was sold to Educational Media Foundation. A few weeks later, it was officially announced by EMF that the station would begin carrying the nationwide Air1 radio network, which would allow Atlanta to have access to Air1 as a full-powered station rather than a translator. Following the announcement, Salem made the relatively rare decision to allow the station and its personalties an entire month to say farewell to listeners. A final celebration for the 25-year-old station was held at Mount Paran Church in Atlanta and was attended by several hundred fans.

WFSH-FM signed off just before midnight on January 31, 2025, with &quot;Goodbye&quot; by Night Ranger being the final song played. &quot;Air1&quot; was then launched, with &quot;Praise&quot; by Elevation Worship being the first song played. In addition, the station&#x27;s callsign changed to WAIA.

==Programming==
WFSH-FM was one of three Christian contemporary stations serving Metro Atlanta, along with WAKL (a K-Love station that, like Air1, originates no local content) and WVFJ-FM. Unlike its competitors, which are run by non-profit organizations and seek donations, WFSH-FM was a commercial radio station. Salem used &quot;The Fish&quot; as the moniker for several of its Christian contemporary stations, including KFSH-FM in Los Angeles and WFHM-FM in Cleveland. The fish, called the Ichthys, was used as a symbol of the early Christian Church.

==Personalities==
WFSH-FM was unusual in having all weekday air shifts hosted by women DJs. The morning show was co-hosted by a man and a woman.
* Kevin &amp; Taylor mornings (since WFSH-FM&#x27;s debut)
* Kim Friz middays
* Beth Bacall afternoons
* Penny Faulkner evenings
* Uncle Buck, Margaret Cheeley, Parks Stamper(Mid-Day from WFSH-FM&#x27;s debut, until she retired in 2023), Mark Harp and Curt Zehner weekends

==Awards==

* 2002, 2003 and 2005 Georgia Association of Broadcasters &quot;Station of the Year&quot;
* Kevin and Taylor in the Morning, 2003 and 2004 &quot;Radio and Records&quot; &quot;Personalities of the Year&quot;

<doc id="508695" wikidata="Q3564184" url="?curid=508695" title="Geronimo (martyr)">
<text>The alleged finding of human remains, designated San Geronimo, in 1853 afforded striking confirmation of an incident recorded by a Spanish Benedictine named Diego de Haedo, who published a topography and history of Algiers in 1612. Haedo sets forth the legend that a young Arab who had embraced Christianity, and had been baptized with the name of Geronimo (&quot;Jerome&quot;), had been captured by a Moorish corsair in 1569 and taken to Algiers. 

The Arabs endeavoured to induce Geronimo to renounce Christianity, but as he steadfastly refused to do so, he was condemned to death. Bound hand and foot, he was thrown alive into a mould in which a block of concrete was about to be made. The block containing his body was built into an angle of the Fort of the Twenty-four Hours, then under construction. According to Samuel M. Zwemer, in 1853 the Fort of the Twenty-four Hours was demolished, and, in the very angle specified by Haedo, the skeleton of Geronimo was found. The bones were interred at St. Philippe, now the Ketchaoua Mosque. Liquid plaster of Paris was run into the mould left by the saint&#x27;s body, creating a perfect model showing the features of the youth, the cords which bound him, and even the texture of his clothing. This model was said to be held in the museum formerly at Parc du Galland, Mustapha Superior, Algiers.

<doc id="508696" wikidata="Q7954977" url="?curid=508696" title="WREK">
<text>WREK (91.1 FM &quot;Wreck&quot;, from the Ramblin&#x27; Wreck) is the radio station staffed by the students of the Georgia Institute of Technology. It is also located on channel 17 on the Georgia Tech cable TV network, GTCN. Starting as a 10-watt class D, WREK currently broadcasts a 100,000-watt ERP signal throughout the Atlanta metropolitan area, making it among the ten highest-powered college radio stations in the United States.

In 2007, WREK applied to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to increase its effective radiated power to the maximum power of 100,000 watts (from its former 40,000 watts) with a directional antenna pattern designed to avoid interference with specific distant stations (as required). This coverage increase was designed to greatly improve the radio station&#x27;s coverage to encompass more of the Atlanta metropolitan area. That application was subsequently approved, and the station built out the improved coverage by replacing its antenna system in the fall of 2011.

In March 2008, WREK replaced its then 20-year-old transmitter with a brand new unit capable of three times the signal power and providing HD Radio capability. The addition of an HD Radio broadcast has made WREK among the first student-run, student-funded stations in the nation to add digital broadcasting capability.

==Programming==
Programming is student-run and extremely diverse, including everything from heavy metal to world, hip-hop to blues, classical and jazz to industrial, noise, hyperpop and similarly diverse community programming (&quot;Church of the Subgenius&quot;).
WREK slogans include &quot;music you don&#x27;t hear on the radio&quot; and &quot;quality diverse radio.&quot;

===Sound blocks===
Regular rotation programming blocks take up most daytime broadcasts. Certain times focus on certain themes: mornings play Just Jazz and Classics while afternoons transmit RRR (Rock, Rhythm and Roll) and nights air Atmospherics and the notorious Overnight Alternatives. These time slots are staffed by various WREK student staff and feature a wide selection of music, contests, and PSAs. The WREK website maintains a two-week archive of all regular rotation shifts, available as 128 kbit/s and 24 kbit/s downloads.

===Specialty shows===
Specialty Shows feature shifts dedicated to a specific genre. They air for over 50 hours a week, mainly in the evenings. They range from
the &quot;Ramblin&#x27; Wreck Sports Show&quot;, a Georgia Tech sports talk show hosted by students to &quot;Destroy All Music&quot;, clatter-improv with pink noise freakouts. Other weekly shows include &quot;Electronic Sound System&quot;, an experimental electronic show featuring music and in-studio performances of new and established artists that run the electronic gamut; &quot;Velvet&quot;, featuring classic and contemporary R&amp;B and soul; &quot;Live@WREK&quot;, a live music show broadcasting local and touring artists and bands; &quot;Girl Rock!&quot;, highlighting the work of women and non-binary artists worldwide; and &quot;Slow Riot&quot;, technical, abstract math rock and atmospheric, swirling post-rock.

===Sports===
WREK also broadcasts play-by-play coverage of Georgia Tech intercollegiate athletics, including baseball, women&#x27;s basketball, and volleyball. In fall 2004, the station agreed to partner with ISP Sports to simulcast network coverage of selected Georgia Tech football and men&#x27;s basketball games to augment WQXI&#x27;s diminished AM nighttime coverage in metro Atlanta. That partnership ended following the 2007–08 season.

In December 2002, WREK broadcast the entire 50-disc &quot;Merzbox&quot; by the Japanese experimental music artist Merzbow. An article in &quot;Creative Loafing&quot; described the Merzbow Marathon as &quot;what may be the most obscure and counterintuitive move in the history of radio.&quot;

Continuing their tradition of unorthodox radio broadcasts, WREK chose to air the long-running heavy metal show &quot;WREKage&quot; for the entire 24-hour broadcast day on June 6, 2006 (6/6/6). Heavy metal was played in chronological order from midnight to midnight. As an extra nod to the mystic number &quot;666 (number)&quot;, Iron Maidens &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; was aired at 6:06 a.m. and p.m.

In the fall of 2007, the critics of Creative Loafing declared WREK to be the Best Overall Radio Station in the Atlanta metropolitan area. The article describing their reasoning declared WREK to be &quot;strange in a good way. The station&#x27;s format is noncommercial and nonconforming. Few stations in the city can compete with WREK&#x27;s eclectic playlist&quot;.
==Technical details==
WREK&#x27;s transmitter is a Harris HT/HD+ which outputs a 16.3 kW TPO signal into a high-gain 8-bay ERI (Electronics Research Inc) antenna, resulting in an effective radiated power of 100,000 Watts in the strongest direction. The antenna is located on a 300-foot (90-meter) self-supporting tower adjacent to the Undergraduate Living Center and Woodruff Hall on Georgia Tech&#x27;s west campus, connected to the studio in the Student Center via a wireless, 950.0 MHz studio-transmitter link, WQAQ311, and a digital, fiber-optic link.

==History==
Georgia Tech was the home of an early AM radio station, WBBF (later WGST, now WGKA AM 920), which began operation in January 1924. Much of this station&#x27;s initial equipment had been previously used by the &quot;Atlanta Constitution&#x27;s&quot; WGM, and was donated through the efforts of the newspaper&#x27;s editor, Clark Howell. In April 1930, the school made an agreement with the Southern Broadcasting Stations, Inc. to operate WGST as a commercial station, while still under the oversight of Georgia Tech. In 1973, the Georgia Board of Regents decided WGST was &quot;surplus property&quot;, and the next year it was sold for five million dollars to the Meredith Corporation, despite opposition from alumni groups, members of the Georgia General Assembly and even the Governor of Georgia. Proceeds from this sale were used to upgrade WREK.

WREK first signed on the air on March 25, 1968, broadcasting at 10 Watts from a 20-foot tower atop the Van Leer Electrical Engineering building on Georgia Tech&#x27;s campus. Barry James Folsom, then-student, started radio station WREK and was one of first DJs. The studio was located in the top floor of that building and included donated equipment from WSM-FM Nashville. Chief Engineer and then-student Geoff Mendenhall designed and built a 425W power amplifier which, once type certified by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in August 1968, brought WREK to 3,400W ERP. In 2013 Mendenhall retired from Harris Broadcast Communications (now GatesAir) as VP of Transmission Research and Technology.

In 1978 WREK&#x27;s tower and studio were relocated. A new, tower was built on the western edge of the Georgia Tech campus, and the studio moved to the former WGST studios in the annex of the Alexander Memorial Coliseum (now known as Hank McCamish Pavilion), where it would remain until 2004. Visitors to WREK&#x27;s Coliseum studios were often startled by its walls, which were covered by thick layers of posters, set lists, and other music memorabilia, as well as the giant electromechanical broadcast automation machines and other large racks of monitoring and control equipment. WREK&#x27;s studios relocated to the Student Center Commons (formerly the Georgia Tech Bookstore building) in August 2004.

After the renovation of the Wenn Student Center, WREK relocated from their temporary residence in the Office of Information Technology building to their new studio in the newly-renovated Student Center.

WREK began streaming its compressed (8-bit μ-law) broadcast over the Internet on November 7, 1994, making it one of the first Internet radio stations. The station now streams in MP3 format and features a two-week-long running archive of its broadcast on the schedule page of its website.

<text>WWPW (105.3 FM, &quot;Power 105.3&quot;) is an Atlanta radio station broadcasting a Top 40 (CHR) radio format. The station&#x27;s transmitter is located in Newnan, Georgia and targets metro Atlanta, also covering its city of license of Bowdon, Georgia. It is owned by iHeartMedia and operates from studios located in Atlanta&#x27;s Upper Westside district inside the Works ATL development.

==History==

===Country (1994–2002)===
The station began in May 1994 as country-music &quot;Y 105.5&quot; WYAI-FM, a class-A serving Carrollton to the west-southwest of metro Atlanta. Having co-channel RF interference with station WCHK-FM 105.5 in Canton, Georgia (north-northwest of Atlanta), both stations changed radio frequencies (the other station now being WBZY 105.7) and moved closer to Atlanta.

=== 1980s hits (2002–2004) ===
In late February 2002, the station upgraded to a class C1 as an Atlanta move-in. To create hype, the station stunted with classical music and comedy bits. 105.3 officially debuted as WMAX-FM &quot;105-3 The Max&quot;, playing all 1980s music, on February 18, 2002, with &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; by The Buggles being the first song played.

=== Hot talk (2004) ===
On January 30, 2004, at 6 p.m., after playing &quot;It&#x27;s The End of the World&quot; by R.E.M., WMAX-FM became a hot talk station known as &quot;Real Radio 105.3&quot; that aired talk on weekdays; 1980s music would remain on weekends. The WMAX-FM callsign now resides on another iHeartMedia station in Holland, Michigan, which is currently branded as “96.1 The Game.”

===Spanish music (2004–2005)===
On September 15, 2004, at 10 a.m., following &quot;The MJ Morning Show&quot;, the station began stunting with a heartbeat sound effect and Spanish-language liners promoting the upcoming launch of a new format. At 11 p.m. that evening, the station changed to Latin Top 40 as WWVA-FM &quot;Viva 105.3&quot;, as part of efforts by owner iHeartMedia (then Clear Channel Communications) to expand into Hispanic radio markets. During the last quarter of 2004, it was the second-top-rated radio station in Atlanta.

=== Alternative rock (2005–2006) ===
On May 5, 2005, WWVA-FM would begin simulcasting on 105.7 FM, displacing oldies-formatted &quot;Cool 105.7&quot;, as part of a frequency and format shuffle. After four days of simulcasting and a brief stunt of a loop directing listeners to the new frequency, WBZY&#x27;s alternative rock format would move from 96.7 to 105.3 as &quot;105.3 the Buzz&quot; (&quot;Viva&quot; would then also begin simulcasting on 96.7 FM on May 17, also after a brief simulcasting period). For two weeks, the calls of 105.3 were changed to WLCL, so the local media would not be able to predict the move. After the switch, the calls were changed to WBZY.

===Spanish music (2006–2020)===
On November 17, 2006, at 9 a.m., WBZY dropped the alternative format and &quot;Buzz&quot; branding. Some of the on-air staff were fired and others moved down the dial to sister station WKLS FM 96.1, which relaunched from &quot;96 Rock&quot; to &quot;Project 9-6-1&quot;. For several days, WBZY simulcast WKLS until it began a loop telling listeners to tune into the new station, as well as advertising the new format of the station. The 105.3 frequency debuted a new Regional Mexican format under the name &quot;El Patrón&quot; at 9 a.m. on November 28.

On October 19, 2009, sister station WWVA-FM (then known as Viva 105.7), who had been broadcasting a Spanish AC format, flipped to rhythmic AC as &quot;Groove 105.7&quot;, thus leaving WBZY as Atlanta&#x27;s only FM Spanish-language station. This move prompted Clear Channel to merge 105.7&#x27;s Spanish adult contemporary format with 105.3&#x27;s regional Mexican format. The &quot;Viva&quot; format has moved to El Patrón&#x27;s HD-2 channel.

At 5 p.m. on November 8, 2018, WBZY flipped to Spanish CHR, branded as &quot;Z105.3&quot;. In July of the following year, the branding changed slightly to &quot;105.3 La Z&quot;, though it would revert to the &quot;Z105.3&quot; branding the next year.

===Urban (2020–2024)===
On April 20, 2020, sister station WRDA assumed the format of WBZY, with both frequencies simulcasting as a means of transition for the &quot;Z&quot; format. At midnight on May 4, 2020, in the middle of &quot;Limbo&quot; by Daddy Yankee, WBZY dropped the simulcast and assumed the mainstream urban format of WRDG as &quot;105.3 The Beat&quot; (the first song on &quot;The Beat&quot; was &quot;High Fashion&quot; by one-time Atlanta native Roddy Ricch), as the 105.3 frequency had a much larger signal coverage (at 61,000 watts), albeit covering the Atlanta Metropolitan area from the southwestern portion of the market (roughly 80% of Fulton and DeKalb counties, a majority encompasses the city of Atlanta based on its primary signal coverage). Like the WRDA simulcast, this was a temporary simulcast; on May 18, WRDG switched to a simulcast of WBZY as WBZW. The WBZY call letters would move to 105.7 FM on May 11; in turn, the WRDA calls moved to 105.3 FM. A week later, 105.3 would adopt the WRDG call letters from 96.7.

===Top 40/CHR (2024–present)===
On April 16, 2024, at noon, WRDG began promoting a &quot;big announcement&quot; to take place at noon that day. At that time, after playing &quot;On Me&quot; by Lil&#x27; Baby, WRDG&#x27;s urban format and &quot;Beat&quot; branding moved to sister station WWPW as &quot;96.1 The Beat&quot;. After an hour of simulcasting, WRDG assumed WWPW&#x27;s Top 40/CHR format and &quot;Power&quot; branding as &quot;Power 105.3.&quot; The first song after the move was &quot;Lovin&#x27; On Me&quot; by Jack Harlow. The two stations would swap call letters on April 23.

<text>TBO was a long-running Spanish comic book magazine, published in Barcelona between 1917 and 1998.

TBO is pronounced in Spanish almost the same as &quot;te veo&quot;, &quot;I see you&quot;. It was so popular that &quot;tebeo&quot; is now a generic word for &quot;comic book&quot; in Spain.

&quot;TBO&quot; was far from modern influences in seventies when European comics started to influence Spanish comic magazines. It kept its own style with short stories and ingenuous humour.

In 2016, the Biblioteca de Catalunya, acquired 105 original drawings by different authors and subject, related to the publication. This fund includes, among others, drawings by , Antoni Batllori Jofre, Rino (Marí Benejam Ferrer), , Antoni Ayné Esbert, Juan Martínez Buendía, Aristide Perré, Nit (Joan Macias), and the most important series like and .

<text>WSTR (94.1 FM, &quot;Star 94&quot;) is an radio station licensed to Smyrna, Georgia, and serving the Atlanta metropolitan area. Owned by Audacy, Inc., it broadcasts a rhythmic adult contemporary format. Its studios are located at Colony Square in Midtown Atlanta, while the station transmitter resides in Atlanta&#x27;s Reynoldstown neighborhood.

==History==
===Early years===
The station signed on as WDJK on January 1, 1964, founded by WSMA (1550 AM) owner Mitchell Melof; WDJK operated as a simulcast of WSMA.

Jupiter Broadcasting of Georgia, then the owner of WQXI (790 AM), purchased WDJK in January 1965, with Kent Burkhart serving as vice president and general manager. WDJK&#x27;s call sign was changed to WKXI and a beautiful music format was installed, with studios at 2970 Peachtree Road NW in Atlanta. The Pacific and Southern Company, forerunners to the modern-day Gannett and Tegna Inc., purchased WQXI and WKXI in November 1967.

===WQXI-FM (1969–1989)===

In 1969, the station changed its call letters to WQXI-FM to match its AM sister station. In mid-1977, the station started calling itself &quot;94Q&quot; when WQXI&#x27;s contemporary hit radio format was moved to the FM station.

Around 1987, WQXI-FM&#x27;s audience share began to dwindle. Various tweaks were made to the music mix, followed by an outright change of direction in late 1988 that competed head-to-head with then-dominant Top 40 outlet WAPW (99.7 FM) as &quot;Atlanta&#x27;s Hit Music, 94Q&quot;. However, by the following summer, 94Q had been soundly beaten, and the station began to purge most of its management and on-air talent.

WQXI-FM notably carried a smooth jazz-themed program called &quot;Jazz Flavors&quot; during the 1980s, first airing on Sunday evenings before eventually expanding to weeknights. Despite the seeming incompatibility between it and contemporary hits, this program ran on WQXI-FM for several years, eventually serving as the genesis for the &quot;Jazz Flavors&quot; branding on WJZF (104.1 FM) when that station became the first one in the Atlanta market to adopt the format full-time. &quot;Jazz Flavors&quot; was reduced back to Sunday nights only in March 1989, when 94Q was experimenting with a mainstream CHR format.

===WSTR (1989–present)===
At midnight on November 15, &quot;94Q&quot; signed off after 12 years, with the final song being &quot;Imagine&quot; by John Lennon. 94.1 would then relaunch as &quot;Star 94&quot; with the call letters WSTR. The first song on &quot;Star 94&quot; was &quot;Oh Atlanta&quot; by Little Feat. The station&#x27;s format was a hybrid of hot AC and Top 40, best described as adult Top 40. The station initially avoided most hip-hop and rhythmic-oriented music hitting the Top 40 charts, though it added some rhythmic songs in the mid-1990s. Steve McCoy was brought in as morning show host and was paired with Vikki Locke; McCoy and Locke would helm the station&#x27;s morning show for the next 17 years.

After WAPW flipped to modern rock as WNNX in October 1992, WSTR was considered the &quot;default&quot; hit music station in Atlanta due to the lack of a mainstream Top 40 outlet. Outside of a brief stint as a Top 40 when WBTS launched in 1999, Atlanta gained a mainstream Top 40 station in 2001, when WWWQ (100.5 FM) signed on.

====Hot AC era (2010–2020)====

In September 2010, Nielsen BDS moved WSTR from the CHR/Top 40 panel to the adult Top 40 (hot AC) panel, as the station became more identified with a Hot AC playlist. WSTR changed its on-air slogan to &quot;Your Life...Your Music&quot;, to emphasize its shift to hot AC. In February 2011, WSTR began programming all-1990s weekends, called &quot;Big 90s Weekends&quot; in response to the all-1980s weekends on WSB-FM (98.5). However, in the Fall of 2011, the station dropped the All-90s weekends.

Jefferson-Pilot Communications (and later Lincoln Financial Media) had owned WSTR and WQXI since 1974. On December 8, 2014, Entercom announced its purchase of Lincoln Financial Media&#x27;s entire 15-station lineup, including WSTR and WQXI, for $106.5 million. The stations were operated under a local marketing agreement (LMA) until the sale was approved by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Entercom officially took over WSTR and WQXI on July 17, 2015; WQXI was spun off to Atlanta Radio Korea in 2016.

In November 2017, Entercom merged with CBS Radio, making WSTR co-owned with WZGC, WVEE-FM and WAOK.

In 2019, the station aired Christmas music during the holiday season for the first time.

====Rhythmic AC era (2020–present)====

On September 17, 2020, the station began teasing a &quot;big announcement&quot; to come at 3 pm; the use of the word &quot;big&quot; seemed to allude to previous reports the station was soon to flip to adult hits as &quot;Big 94&quot; (matching a similar recent format change on cross-country sister station WBGB in Boston). At that time, after playing &quot;Closing Time&quot; by Semisonic, WSTR instead relaunched with a rhythmic adult contemporary format, maintaining the &quot;Star&quot; branding while promoting the new focus as &quot;The NEW Star 94&quot; under the slogan &quot;The Rhythm of ATL&quot;, with the first song being &quot;Wanna Be Startin&#x27; Somethin&#x27;&quot; by Michael Jackson.

==Notable alumni==
Several influential air personalities have worked at the station, including Ryan Seacrest. Seacrest interned on the night show with Tom Sullivan, who also helped train him; Sullivan gave Ryan his first &quot;on air&quot; shift, and eventually he began working weekends, Ryan did this while still attending Dunwoody High School.

==HD Radio==
The HD2 digital subchannel formerly aired a classic hits format under the brand &quot;Star 94.1 HD2&quot;.

The HD3 channel formerly aired Audacy&#x27;s LGBTQ+ talk/dance format &quot;Channel Q&quot;. It has since moved to HD2 with the HD3 channel being turned off.

<text>Lampshade spiders, family Hypochilidae, are among the most primitive of araneomorph spiders. There are two genera and twelve species currently recognized. Like mygalomorphs, most hypochilids have two pairs of book lungs, but like araneomorphs they have intersecting fangs, with the exception of some species which have chelicerae in an angle that is neither orthognathous or labidognathous. These long-legged spiders build typical &quot;lampshade&quot; style webs under overhangs and in caves. In the United States the fauna is primarily associated with the Appalachian, Rocky and California Mountains. Ten of the known species are found in these ranges, all in the genus &quot;Hypochilus&quot;. The genus &quot;Ectatosticta&quot; is found in China.

In one analysis, the Hypochilidae are a sister clade to the Neocribellatae, which contains all other spider species in the Araneomorphae (Coddington &amp; Levi, 1991, p. 576). A more recent study groups them with the Haplogynae.

<text>Total benefits of ownership (TBO) is a calculation that tries to summarise the positive effects of the acquisition of a plan. It is an estimate of all the values that will affect a business.

TBO is a financial estimate intended to help buyers and owners determine the direct and indirect benefits of a product or system. It is used to determine potential return on investment (ROI). The usage of TBO may lead to an increase in efficiency and productivity of a business, improvements in decision-making, or improvements in the workforce. It helps to identify important areas which a business should be focusing on, as well as uncovering the hidden aspects of the decisions made by the firm.

== Use of concept ==
TBO goes beyond the initial purpose or implementation benefit to consider the full benefit of a decision or an asset over its useful life. A TBO analysis often shows there can be a large difference between the short-term benefit to the business and its long-term benefit. This can include

* operational cost savings, 
* productivity improvements
* enhancements to a business&#x27;s ability to compete
* greater employee retention
* increased brand equity
* expanding sales reach 

For example, a small company can now have access to worldwide markets without the costs of travel. The decisions made from TBO analysis help to add monetary profit into the company&#x27;s account.

== Importance ==
While many companies perform a total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis, TBO is considered to be as important as TCO. TCO aims to minimize the total cost of the business, whereas TBO targets the maximum value of the project. Enterprise decision-makers often use both methods to estimate the actual value of an investment or strategic venture.

When considering a business proposition, the enterprise decision-makers always consider other alternatives while deciding whether the original plan is the best. An advantage of using TBO is that it identifies the value of the short term and the long-term benefits of the propositions. This system helps the company to prioritize the importance of each decision. This analysis not only serves as a tool to reduce cost but also as a way to plan the future of the business, in a more detailed and sophisticated way.

For example, a company is considering whether to invest in a long-term project, such as infrastructure. TBO will consider whether the long-term benefit may outweigh the short-term benefits of opportunity cost; whether the money spent on investment may have a better alternate purpose, e.g. using the budget to improve training schemes for workers.

== Examples of different industries using total benefits of ownership ==

=== Retailing industry with the use of Internet ===
The TBO concept is widely used within the web industry. For example, TBO identifies the benefits of using the Internet in a business. These include the exclusion of fixed cost (i.e. rent), as well as the decreasing cost of online advertisement.

Some of the key elements are incorporated in the benefit of ownership within retailing industry. 
* Cheaper transportation cost
* Increase in global demand for products
* Decrease in variable cost ( i.e. cheaper wages)
* Benefits of outsourcing

=== Computer and software industries etc ===
* Software becomes more user-friendly
* Quicker data analysis
* Greater data storage space

<text>Julia O&#x27;Hara Stiles (born March 28, 1981) is an American actress. Stiles began acting at the age of 11 as part of New York&#x27;s La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club. Her film debut was a small role at age 15 in &quot;I Love You, I Love You Not&quot; (1996), followed by a lead role in &quot;Wicked&quot; (1998) for which she received the Karlovy Vary Film Festival Award for Best Actress. She rose to prominence with leading roles in teen films such as &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot; (1999), &quot;Down to You&quot; (2000), and &quot;Save the Last Dance&quot; (2001). Her accolades include a Teen Choice Award and two MTV Movie Awards, as well as nominations for a Golden Globe Award, and Primetime Emmy Award. 

Stiles added to her list of credits with films such as &quot;The Business of Strangers&quot; (2001), &quot;Mona Lisa Smile&quot; (2003), and &quot;The Omen&quot; (2006), and became known to audiences worldwide with her portrayal of Nicky Parsons in the &quot;Bourne&quot; franchise (2002–2016). Her other notable film credits include &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;State and Main&quot; (both 2000), &quot;O&quot; (2001), &quot;A Guy Thing&quot; (2002), &quot;Carolina&quot; (2003), &quot;The Prince &amp; Me&quot; (2004), &quot;Edmond&quot;, &quot;A Little Trip to Heaven&quot; (both 2005), &quot;The Cry of the Owl&quot; (2009), &quot;Silver Linings Playbook&quot; (2012), &quot;Out of the Dark&quot; (2014), &quot;Blackway&quot; (2015), &quot;11:55&quot; (2016), &quot;Hustlers&quot; (2019) and &quot;&quot; (2022).

Outside of film, Stiles played Lumen Pierce on the fifth season of &quot;Dexter&quot; (2010), earning nominations for the Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress and the Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actress. From 2012 to 2014 she appeared as the titular character in the web series &quot;Blue&quot;, for which she earned two IAWTV Awards for Best Actress. From 2017 to 2020 she starred as Georgina Ryland on the Sky Atlantic series &quot;Riviera&quot;. She starred in the Amazon series &quot;The Lake&quot; (2022–2023).

==Early life and education ==
Stiles was born in New York City to Judith Newcomb Stiles, a Greenwich Village artist, and John O&#x27;Hara, a businessman. She is the oldest of three children; her siblings are John Junior and Jane (also an actress). Stiles is of English, Irish, and Italian descent. She started acting at age 11, performing with New York&#x27;s La MaMa Theatre Company.

==Career==

===Film and television===
After finding an agent, Stiles began auditioning for television in 1993 and films in 1996. She made her acting debut in 1993 on the mystery show &quot;Ghostwriter&quot; as Erica Dansby.

Stiles&#x27;s first film role was in &quot;I Love You, I Love You Not&quot; (1996), with Claire Danes and Jude Law. She also had small roles as Harrison Ford&#x27;s character&#x27;s daughter in Alan J. Pakula&#x27;s &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Own&quot; (1997) and in M. Night Shyamalan&#x27;s &quot;Wide Awake&quot; (1998). Her first lead was in &quot;Wicked&quot; (1998), in which she played a teenage girl who might have murdered her mother so she could have her father all to herself. Critic Joe Baltake wrote she was &quot;the darling of the 1998 Sundance Film Festival.&quot; She next starred in the TV miniseries &quot;The &#x27;60s&quot; in 1999.

Stiles was cast at the age of 17 for the role of Kat Stratford, opposite Heath Ledger in Gil Junger&#x27;s &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot;, an adaptation of &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; set in a high school in Seattle. She won an MTV Movie Award for Breakthrough Female Performance for the role. The Chicago Film Critics voted her the most promising new actress of the year. Her next starring role was in &quot;Down to You&quot; (2000), which was panned by critics, but earned both her and her co-star Freddie Prinze, Jr. a Teen Choice Award nomination for their on-screen chemistry. She subsequently appeared in two more Shakespearean adaptations. The first was as Ophelia in Michael Almereyda&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; (2000), with Ethan Hawke in the lead. The second was in the Desdemona role, opposite Mekhi Phifer, in Tim Blake Nelson&#x27;s &quot;O&quot; (2001), a version of &quot;Othello&quot; set at a boarding school. Neither film was a great success; &quot;O&quot; was subject to many delays and a change of distributors, and &quot;Hamlet&quot; was an art house film shot on a minimal budget.

Stiles&#x27;s next commercial success was in &quot;Save the Last Dance&quot; (2001) as an aspiring ballerina forced to leave her small town in downstate Illinois to live with her struggling musician father in Chicago after her mother dies in a car accident. At her new, nearly all-black school, she falls in love with the character played by Sean Patrick Thomas who teaches her hip-hop dance steps that help get her into the Juilliard School. The role won her two more MTV awards for Best Kiss and Best Female Performance and a Teen Choice Award for best fight scene for her battle with Bianca Lawson. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named her &quot;the coolest co-ed&quot; and put her on the cover of its April 12, 2001, issue. She told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that she performed all her own dancing in the film, except for some closeups of the feet.

In David Mamet&#x27;s &quot;State and Main&quot; (2000), about a film shooting on location in a small town in Vermont, she played a teenage girl who seduces a film actor (Alec Baldwin) with a weakness for teen girls. Stiles also appeared opposite Stockard Channing in the dark art house film &quot;The Business of Strangers&quot; (2001) as a conniving, amoral secretary who exacts revenge on her boss. Channing was impressed by her co-star: &quot;In addition to her talent, she has a quality that is almost feral, something that can make people uneasy. She has an effect on people.&quot; Stiles later described the &quot;Bourne&quot; franchise as very important for her career, stating that it &quot;reinvented the action genre, especially for female characters&quot;. Her small role as Treadstone operative Nicolette &quot;Nicky&quot; Parsons in &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; (2002) grew in &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; (2004), then greatly expanded in &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot; (2007).

Between the &quot;Bourne&quot; films, she appeared in &quot;Mona Lisa Smile&quot; (2003) as Joan, a student at Wellesley College in 1953, whose art professor (Julia Roberts) encourages her to pursue a career in law rather than become a wife and mother. Critic Stephen Holden called her one of cinema&#x27;s &quot;brightest young stars&quot;, but the film met with generally unfavorable reviews. Stiles played a Wisconsin college student who is swept off her feet by a Danish prince, played by Luke Mably, in &quot;The Prince and Me&quot; (2004), directed by Martha Coolidge. Stiles told an interviewer that she was very similar to her character Paige Morgan. Critic Scott Foundas said she was &quot;irrepressibly engaging&quot; and the film was a &quot;strange career choice for Stiles&quot;. This echoed criticism in reviews of &quot;A Guy Thing&quot; (2003), a romantic comedy with Jason Lee and Selma Blair. Critic Dennis Harvey wrote that Stiles was &quot;wasted&quot; and Holden called her &quot;a serious actress from whom comedy does not seem to flow naturally&quot;. In 2006, Stiles starred opposite her &quot;Hamlet&quot; co-star Liev Schreiber in &quot;The Omen,&quot; a remake of the 1976 horror film. She returned to the &quot;Bourne&quot; series with a much larger role in &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot; (2007), her highest-grossing film to date.

Stiles acted in &quot;Between Us&quot; (2012) with Taye Diggs, David Harbour, and Melissa George. &quot;Between Us&quot; is the screen adaptation of the off-Broadway play of the same name by Joe Hortua. Stiles starred alongside David Cross and America Ferrera in the dark comedy &quot;It&#x27;s a Disaster&quot;. The film premiered at the 2012 Los Angeles Film Festival and was picked up by Oscilloscope Laboratories and received a limited release the next year. Stiles had a small but pivotal role as a reporter in the 2013 British-American film &quot;Closed Circuit&quot;. Stiles starred in the indie supernatural thriller &quot;Out of the Dark&quot; (2014) alongside Scott Speedman and Stephen Rea.

In 2015, Stiles signed on to reprise her role as Nicky Parsons in &quot;Jason Bourne&quot;, the fifth installment of the &quot;Bourne&quot; franchise. She also featured as Courtney, the wayward mother of Sophie Nélisse, in &quot;The Great Gilly Hopkins&quot; (2016). In 2019, Stiles appeared in the movie &quot;Hustlers&quot; as the journalist, Elizabeth. The film was a box office success.

===Stage===
While Stiles performed in a school play in fourth grade, Bob McGrath of Ridge Theater in Manhattan, a friend of her parents, needed an actor for a nonspeaking role. Stiles&#x27;s first theatrical roles were in works by author/composer John Moran at Ridge Theater from 1993 to 1998. In the summer of 2002, she performed on stage in Eve Ensler&#x27;s &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;, and appeared as Viola, the lead role in Shakespeare in the Park&#x27;s production of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; with Jimmy Smits.

In 2004, she made her West End stage debut opposite Aaron Eckhart in a revival of David Mamet&#x27;s play &quot;Oleanna&quot; at the Garrick Theatre. She reprised the role of Carol in a 2009 production of &quot;Oleanna&quot;, directed by Doug Hughes and co-starring Bill Pullman at the Mark Taper Forum. The production moved to Broadway&#x27;s John Golden Theatre.

Stiles was to play Jeannie in a production of Neil LaBute&#x27;s &quot;Fat Pig&quot; directed by the playwright beginning in spring 2011, but the show was postponed indefinitely.

===Other work===
Stiles appeared in the video for Cyndi Lauper&#x27;s single &quot;Sally&#x27;s Pigeons&quot; in 1993. In 2001, she hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and returned to parody as then-President George W. Bush&#x27;s daughter Jenna Bush in a skit that poked fun at the two first daughters for being arrested for underage drinking. MTV profiled her in its &quot;Diary&quot; series in 2003, and she was &quot;Punk&#x27;d&quot; by Ashton Kutcher at a Washington, D.C., museum in 2004.
In 2010, Stiles played a major role in 10 episodes of the Showtime series &quot;Dexter&quot; For this role, she received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film, as well as a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series.

In 2012, the web series &quot;Blue&quot; starred Stiles as a single mother with a 13-year-old son. She works at an office and also as a call girl to make ends meet on an otherwise meager income fighting to protect her son from the collision between her complicated past and tenuous present. For her work on &quot;Blue&quot;, Stiles won two IAWTV Awards, in 2013 and 2014. The actress during the recordings shared set with artists like Michelle Forbes, JC Gonzalez, and Uriah Shelton.

Stiles played Maisy-May in the Canadian Amazon Prime series &quot;The Lake&quot;. Maisy-May is the &quot;picture-perfect&quot; stepdaughter/stepsister who was given the family cottage by her stepfather, to the dismay of her stepbrother Justin. Season 1 premiered in summer 2022.

===Film director===
Stiles made her writing and directorial debut with &quot;Elle&quot; magazine&#x27;s short &quot;Raving&quot; starring Zooey Deschanel. It premiered at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival.

Stiles&#x27; first feature film as a director, &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, was released in January 2025.

==Personal life==
Stiles graduated from Columbia University with a degree in English literature in 2005. She almost turned down the first &quot;Bourne&quot; film because of college exams, and deferred a semester for the first two films. At Columbia she dated actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt and the two lived in John Jay Hall. She and actor David Harbour were in a relationship between 2011 and 2015. In 2010, she received a John Jay Award, an honorary award given annually to five alumni by the Columbia College Alumni Association for professional achievements.

Stiles has also worked for Habitat for Humanity, building housing in Costa Rica, and has worked with Amnesty International to raise awareness of the harsh conditions of immigration detention of unaccompanied juveniles. In January 2004, &quot;Marie Claire&quot; featured Stiles&#x27;s trip to witness conditions at the Berks County Youth Center in Leesport, Pennsylvania.

Stiles is a former vegan, occasionally eating red meat. She says she gave up veganism after she developed anemia and found it difficult to get proper nutrition while traveling.

She has described herself as a feminist and wrote about the subject in &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

She is a fan of baseball and the New York Mets. She threw the ceremonial first pitch before their May 29, 2006 game.

In September 2017 Stiles married camera assistant Preston J. Cook with whom she worked on &quot;Blackway&quot;. They have three children.

<text>WVEE (103.3 FM) – branded as &quot;V-103&quot; – is a commercial American radio station in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. It is owned by Audacy, Inc. and airs an urban contemporary radio format. WVEE is one of the highest-rated stations in the Atlanta radio market according to Nielsen Audio, reaching number one on many reports. Its studios and offices are located in Colony Square on Peachtree Street in Midtown Atlanta, along with its sister stations WAOK, WSTR and WZGC.

WVEE has an effective radiated power of 100,000 watts. It shares a tower off New Street NE, with WABE-TV, as well as with WSB-FM, which is owned by Cox Radio. The two radio stations&#x27; transmitters are diplexed together, so that they feed to the same antenna.

==History==

===1940s===
The station that became WVEE first signed on the air on . Its original call sign was WAGA-FM, simulcasting a country music radio format with WAGA (590 AM, now WDWD). They were owned by Storer Broadcasting, a company that owned several top stations in large American cities.

The following year, television station WAGA-TV was added as a CBS network affiliate and is now a Fox Television owned and operated station.

===1950s and 1960s===
In 1959, WAGA-AM-FM were acquired by Plough Broadcasting, a subsidiary of a pharmaceutical company that decided to invest in radio stations. Their call letters were switched to WPLO and WPLO-FM, and the two stations continued to simulcast WPLO&#x27;s successful country programming.

In the late 1960s, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) began requiring AM stations in larger cities to end full-time simulcasts, promoting new programming on FM stations. WPLO had Georgia State University students program and host a free form &quot;underground&quot; format, giving the students academic credit instead of pay. The arrangement allowed Plough to have an inexpensive FM presence in the years before FM came to dominate the radio spectrum. It created enough interest among the student body that the Georgia Board of Regents obtained a construction permit and license for its own station at the university, WRAS-FM.

Plough management believed the music programmed by the Georgia State students could become a profitable commercial format if presented professionally. By 1969, WPLO-FM was billing itself as &quot;Atlanta&#x27;s Alternative High&quot;, and described its 103.3 frequency as &quot;103-and-a-third&quot;. Program directors in this progressive rock era included Ed Shane, Steve Hosford, and Chris Morgan.

===1970s===
In 1974, as more listeners were switching from AM to FM for music listening, Plough-Shearing changed WPLO-FM&#x27;s format. Keeping the same call letters, WPLO-FM flipped to country music to build on the AM station&#x27;s popularity. The AM station continued to have more personality, with frequent news and weather updates, while the FM station went in a more-music, limited DJ chatter direction.

In October 1976, Schering-Plough recognized Atlanta&#x27;s growing middle-class African-American market by changing WPLO-FM to urban contemporary under the &quot;V-103&quot; moniker and new call sign WVEE. It briefly aired a disco music format in 1976.

When disco fever cooled, WVEE-FM returned to the urban contemporary, and became one of the Atlanta radio market&#x27;s top stations under the leadership of program director Scotty Andrews. As the first urban station on the FM dial in Metro Atlanta, the &quot;V-103&quot; brand eventually saw other stations around the U.S. follow its formula, including Baltimore sister station WXYV, also known as &quot;V-103&quot;, and a Chicago &quot;V-103&quot; (WVAZ, now owned by iHeartMedia).

===1980s-1990s===
In the early 1980s, DKM Broadcasting Corporation purchased WVEE-FM and WAOK. On January 1, 1988, WVEE-FM was sold, along with other DKM-owned properties in Baltimore, Denver, Springfield, Lincoln, Akron, Dayton, and Dallas, for $200 million to The Summit Communications Group, Inc. In March 1995, Summit sold its interests in WVEE FM and WAOK AM to Granum Communications, Inc., owned by Herbert W. McCord, Peter Ferrara, and Michael Weinstein.

In March 1996, Granum Communications sold both stations to Infinity Broadcasting, which was later folded into CBS Radio. Infinity already owned WZGC, which it owned since 1992, that made the three stations a trio-poly.

===2000s===
In 2000, &quot;V-103&quot;, after many years of operating as an urban contemporary station that only played R&amp;B and classic soul throughout the day and only played hip hop music during early evening hours, added hip-hop music full-time to compete with WHTA (&quot;Hot 97.5&quot;, now &quot;Hot 107.9&quot;) and WALR-FM (&quot;Kiss 104.7&quot;, now &quot;Kiss 104.1&quot;), and to appeal more to the 18-34 demographic alongside the original 25-54 demo. With the gain of more competition, WVEE was one of three adult urban stations between 1998 and 2000 when WAMJ (&quot;Majic 107.5&quot;) took to the air, although WVEE never called itself an urban AC station.

In 2003, &quot;V-103&quot; changed its longtime station slogan from &quot;The People&#x27;s Station&quot; to &quot;Atlanta&#x27;s BIG Station&quot; to signify its dominance of Atlanta urban radio. WVEE-FM was often #1 or #2 in the Arbitron ratings, along with WSB. In 2008, WVEE-FM reverted to the previous slogan &quot;The People&#x27;s Station&quot; to signify its commitment to the African-American community.

Since autumn 2006, WVEE had aired an HD Radio digital subchannel for playing urban adult contemporary (specifically neo-soul) music, with no branding other than &quot;V-103 HD-2&quot;. On February 28, 2020, WVEE-HD2 changed their format to international hits, branded as &quot;V-103 International&quot;. The HD3 channel is a simulcast of sister station WAOK.

On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. The merger was approved on November 9, and was consummated on the 17th.

==Programming==
V-103 has a playlist consisting of a balance of current R&amp;B, soul, and hip-hop songs along with throwbacks and recurrents during most parts of the day. During late night hours from Sunday through Thursday, the station airs slow jams from current and old school R&amp;B and soul songs during its &quot;Quiet Storm&quot; program. WVEE airs a Sunday morning gospel program the entire morning hours, and during the early morning hours on weekdays. On Saturday mornings and Sunday afternoons, the station airs a show dedicated exclusively to classic and contemporary soul music (particularly neo-soul).

WVEE-FM has maintained a strict balance of serving both younger adults and middle-aged listeners since its inception in 1976. This is rare among larger-market urban stations which serve either the mainstream urban or urban adult contemporary audience. Its programming puts it in direct competition with Urban AC stations WALR-FM and the simulcast of WAMJ/WUMJ, as well as mainstream urban stations WHTA-FM, W233BF, and WRDG. In recent years, the station occasionally spins hit crossover pop songs when they are hot on the Top 40 charts.

WVEE was the largest urban station under CBS Radio ownership, and the only CBS Radio urban outlet in the top 10 American radio markets. As of December 2014, WVEE was the only CBS Radio Urban property remaining. Two former CBS urban stations had shifted to Rhythmic Contemporary: WPGC-FM in Washington, D.C., an Urban-leaning Rhythmic, and WJHM in Orlando, which switched formats from Urban to Rhythmic Contemporary in February 2012 (and to top 40 as of February 2014). A third CBS urban station, WPEG Charlotte, was sold to the Beasley Broadcasting Group via a multi-market swap on December 1, 2014. Under Audacy ownership, WVEE is still considered the co-flagship urban station (along with WPGC-FM), but now the largest urban station as WPGC-FM Washington has shifted back to the urban format as of 2018.

==Morning shows==
From 1998 to 2012, WVEE had been home for &quot;Frank Ski and Wanda Smith in the Morning&quot; (originally named &quot;The Frank Ski Morning Show&quot;), when Ski took over the reins from Mike Roberts and Carol Blackmon, after Roberts retired and Blackmon left radio temporarily (now at WAMJ/WUMJ). It consistently maintained one of the highest ratings in the Atlanta region, often finishing as #1 or #2 among morning shows in Atlanta. While the show has almost always been local, it was briefly syndicated to Baltimore (Ski&#x27;s adopted hometown) on sister station WXYV, as well as in Charleston, South Carolina. Ski was a former host on WXYV (then known as V103) before relocating to Atlanta in 1998, after a two-year stint at rival Baltimore urban station WERQ.

In 2008, WVEE entered a partnership with WUPA to broadcast the &quot;Frank and Wanda Television Show&quot;, recapping highlights from &quot;Frank and Wanda in the Morning&quot; for television viewers each night. The theme song for both programs is performed by singer and Atlanta native Monica.

On December 13, 2012, Ski and Smith announced that they both would be leaving WVEE after 14 years. Both said they wanted to concentrate on other ventures. Ski wanted to focus more on family and continue to run his restaurant, while Smith wanted to return to stand up comedy. There were talks with CBS Radio on syndicating the show to other cities but WVEE wanted it to stay focused on Atlanta. The last &quot;Frank and Wanda in the Morning&quot; show aired on December 20, 2012.

On January 2, 2013, former afternoon host Ryan Cameron was chosen to replace them and assume duties as host of &quot;The Ryan Cameron Morning Show&quot;. In January 2014, Wanda Smith returned to the station to co-host the morning drive alongside Cameron. As for Frank Ski, he continues to reside in the Atlanta region although he returned to radio as afternoon host for Washington, D.C. station WHUR until August 2015. As of June 2016, Ski returned to WVEE to host weekend shows for the station. On February 2, 2018, Ryan Cameron left the station to pursue opportunities outside of radio.

On February 13, 2018, Frank Ski returned to host mornings alongside Wanda Smith and comedian Joe &quot;Miss Sophia&quot; McIntosh. In January 2019, Smith and McIntosh exited, and the morning drive show was renamed &quot;The Morning Culture&quot;, hosted by Frank Ski, Jade Novah, and J.R. in February 2019. In July 2020, Ski once again exited WVEE to return to hosting the afternoon drive on WHUR in Washington, D.C. On August 17, 2020, Big Tigger took over hosting the morning drive with the show titled &quot;The Big Tigger Morning Show&quot;.

==Awards==
In 1990, 1992, 1995 and 1998, the station was honored by the National Association of Broadcasters with the Marconi Award for &quot;Urban Station of the Year&quot;. In 2000, it tied for the honor with WUSL Philadelphia.

WVEE won the award on its own again in 2010 and in 2013.

<text>William Ellsworth &quot;Dummy&quot; Hoy (May 23, 1862 – December 15, 1961) was an American professional baseball center fielder in Major League Baseball (MLB) who played for several teams from 1888 to 1902, most notably the Cincinnati Reds and two Washington, D.C. franchises.

Hoy is the most accomplished deaf player in MLB history, and is credited by some sources with causing the establishment of signals for safe and out calls. He held the MLB record for games in center field (1,726) from 1889 to 1902, set records for career putouts (3,958) and total chances (4,625) as an outfielder, and retired among the leaders in outfield games (2nd; 1,795), assists (7th; 273), and double plays (3rd; 72).

He was an excellent baserunner, scoring over 100 runs nine times, and often finishing among the top base stealers. He is one of only 29 players to have played in four different Major Leagues. His 1,006 career walks put him second in MLB history behind Billy Hamilton when he retired. He ended his career ranking eighth in career games played (1,796).

== Career ==

Born in the small town of Houcktown, Ohio, Hoy became deaf after meningitis at age three. He graduated from the Ohio State School for the Deaf in Columbus as class valedictorian. He opened a shoe repair store in his hometown and played baseball on weekends, earning a professional contract in with an Oshkosh, Wisconsin, team which was managed by Frank Selee in 1887. In 1888, with the Washington Nationals of the National League, Hoy became the third deaf player in the major leagues, after pitcher Ed Dundon and pitcher Tom Lynch. In his rookie year he led the league in stolen bases (although the statistic was defined differently prior to 1898), and also finished second with 69 walks while batting .274. At 5&#x27;4&quot; and batting left-handed, he was able to gain numerous walks with a small strike zone, leading the league twice and compiling a .386 career on-base percentage.

Hoy&#x27;s speed was a great advantage in the outfield, and he was able to play shallow as a result. On June 19, 1889, he set an MLB record (which has since been tied twice) by throwing out three runners at home plate in one game, with catcher Connie Mack recording the outs. In 1890, he and Mack joined the Buffalo Bisons of the Players&#x27; League. In Hoy returned to the AA with the St. Louis Browns under player-manager Charles Comiskey for the league&#x27;s final season, leading the league with 119 walks and scoring a career-high 136 runs, second in the league. He returned to Washington for two years with the Washington Senators of the National League. He was traded to the Reds in December 1893, where he was reunited with Comiskey.

Hoy later joined the Louisville Colonels, where his teammates included Honus Wagner, Fred Clarke and Tommy Leach, who was his roommate. He hit .304 and .306 in his two seasons with the club. In he broke Mike Griffin&#x27;s Major League record of 1,459 games in center field. After playing for the Chicago White Sox in the American League during its last minor league season in 1900, where Comiskey was now the team owner, Hoy stayed with the team when the AL achieved major league status in 1901, helping them to the league&#x27;s (and his) first pennant.

In 1901, he broke Tom Brown&#x27;s record of 3,623 career outfield putouts, and led the league with 86 walks and 14 times hit by pitch. He finished fourth in runs (112) and on-base percentage (.407). He ended his Major League career with the Reds in 1902, batting .290 and breaking Brown&#x27;s record of 4,461 career total chances in the outfield. He played for Los Angeles in the Pacific Coast League in 1903. In May of his last season with the Reds, he batted against pitcher Dummy Taylor of the New York Giants in the first faceoff between deaf players in the Major Leagues. Hoy got two hits.

Hoy retired with a .288 batting average, 2,048 hits, 1,429 runs, 725 runs batted in, 248 doubles, 121 triples and 40 home runs. He had 488 stolen bases from 1888 through 1897, and 108 more after the statistic was redefined to its present meaning in 1898. His 1,795 games in the outfield ranked second to Jimmy Ryan (then at 1,829) in MLB history. Jesse Burkett broke his MLB record for career putouts in 1905, and Clarke topped his record for career total chances in 1909. His record for career games in center field was broken by Tris Speaker in 1920.

== Personal life ==
In Hoy&#x27;s time, the word &quot;dumb&quot; was used to describe someone who could not speak, rather than someone who was stupid. But since the ability to speak was often connected to one&#x27;s intelligence, the epithets &quot;dumb&quot; and &quot;dummy&quot; became interchangeable with stupidity. Hoy himself often corrected individuals who addressed him as William, and referred to himself as Dummy. Said to have been able to speak with a voice that resembled a squeak, he was one of the most intelligent players of his time.

He is sometimes credited with developing the hand signals used by umpires to this day, though this view is widely disputed. Cy Rigler is believed to have created signals for balls and strikes while working in the minor leagues. In the November 6, 1886 issue of &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, the deaf pitcher Ed Dundon is credited as using hand signals while umpiring a game in Mobile, Alabama on October 20, 1886. Bill Klem is credited with introducing those signals to the Major Leagues, in the early 20th century.

No articles printed during Hoy&#x27;s lifetime have been found to support the suggestion that he influenced the creation of signals, nor did he ever maintain that he had such a role. Nonetheless, due to the possibility that he may have played a role in the use of signals, as well as for his all-around play, there is a movement to support his election to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York.

In retirement, Hoy and his wife Anna Maria, who was also deaf, operated a dairy farm in Mount Healthy, Ohio, outside Cincinnati. Among their six children was Carson, an Ohio judge, and their grandson, Judson, became a member of the Ohio House of Representatives. They raised his nephew, Paul Hoy Helms, the founder of the Helms Athletic Foundation in Los Angeles. Hoy also worked as an executive with Goodyear after supervising hundreds of deaf workers during World War I.

In 1951 he was the first deaf athlete elected to membership in the American Athletic Association of the Deaf Hall of Fame. At the age of 99 and just two months before his death in Cincinnati following a stroke, the Reds brought him back to Crosley Field, built on the site of his former home field, to throw out the first ball before Game 3 of the 1961 World Series. He could see, if not hear, the standing ovation he received. Upon his death that December, his remains were cremated according to family tradition and were scattered at Lytle Park in Cincinnati.

== Legacy ==

Upon his death in 1961 at the age of 99, Hoy was the longest-lived former MLB player ever. In 1973, Ralph Miller broke Hoy&#x27;s record by becoming the first ex-major leaguer to reach the age of 100. Altogether, 25 former big league ballplayers have become centenarians, with one of the 25, Silas Simmons, becoming an supercentenarian, dying at the age of 111 in 2006.

At the time of his death, Dummy Hoy was the last surviving participant of both the American Association and the Players&#x27; League.

In the baseball field at Gallaudet University was named the William &quot;Dummy&quot; Hoy Baseball Field. He was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in . Hoy was inducted into the Baseball Reliquary&#x27;s Shrine of the Eternals in 2004.

The William &quot;Dummy&quot; Hoy Classic is a baseball game held every two years during Rochester, New York Deaf Awareness Week; it is contested between members of the Rochester Recreation Club of the Deaf and the Buffalo, New York Club of the Deaf, at a recreated 19th-century ballpark at Genesee Country Village and Museum.

In 2008, the aired the biography &quot;Dummy Hoy: A Deaf Hero&quot; (aka: &quot;I See the Crowd Roar&quot;). The documentary, using photographs of Hoy and actors to recreate certain events, chronicled the highlights of Hoy&#x27;s life and his contributions to baseball; Hoy was portrayed by Ryan Lane.

At least three picture books for children have been published: &quot;Silent Star: The Story of Deaf Major Leaguer William Hoy&quot; by Bill Wise (2012), &quot;The William Hoy Story: How a Deaf Baseball Player Changed the Game&quot; Nancy Churnin (2016)., and &quot;The Little-Known Heroes: William &#x27;Dummy&#x27; Hoy&quot; by Kaushay and Spencer Ford (2021).

The 2019 limited-release movie &quot;The Silent Natural&quot;, tells the story of Hoy, who is played by Miles Barbee, who is deaf in real life.

<text>WAKL (106.7 MHz, branded &quot;106.7 K-Love&quot;) is a non-commercial FM Christian contemporary radio station licensed to Gainesville, Georgia. Owned by the Educational Media Foundation, WAKL serves the Atlanta metropolitan area as the local affiliate for the national K-Love network. Besides a standard analog transmission, WAKL broadcasts in the HD Radio hybrid format.

WAKL is a Class C FM radio station, with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 77,000 watts. In 1985, the transmitter location was moved from the Gainesville area to a site off Piney Grove Road in Loganville, Georgia, bringing it about 30 miles closer to Intown Atlanta, though Gainesville remains as its city of license. WAKL programming is heard on an FM translator station, 19–watt W223BP, 92.5 MHz in Dallas, Georgia.

==History==

===Early years (1949–1984)===
On April 3, 1949, this facility first signed on as WDUN-FM. It was co-owned with WDUN (1400 AM; now at 550 AM). At first, it was only powered at 300 watts and it simulcast its AM sister station. In the 1960s, the station moved to 106.7 MHz and power was dramatically increased to 50,000 watts. It switched to an automated beautiful music format.

By late 1976, WDUN-FM was WWID &quot;Wide 107&quot;, continuing its easy listening format. Then it became WWLT &quot;Lite 106&quot; in early 1983, playing soft adult contemporary music.

===Country (1984–2008)===
WWLT was sold to Katz Broadcasting in 1984. On June 25, 1984, the call sign changed to WYAY, flipping to a country music format as &quot;Y106&quot;, a moniker it retained until 2000. From 1989 to 1994, Y106 was paired with a station known as &quot;Y104&quot;, on the opposite (southwest) side of metro Atlanta, broadcasting at 104.1 MHz. Y106 and Y104 simulcast their programming, except for advertisements. 104.1 FM became urban adult contemporary WALR-FM after it was sold to Cox Radio in late 1994.

In 1993, WYAY was bought by ABC Radio for $19 million. ABC kept the country format in place, with popular disc jockey Rhubarb Jones hosting mornings.

On September 1, 2000, at 3 p.m., the station changed to a classic country format as &quot;Eagle 106.7&quot;. The station still played some current music but mainly focused on the classics. The first song on the new &quot;Eagle&quot; was &quot;T-R-O-U-B-L-E&quot; by Marietta native Travis Tritt.

In late 2005, WYAY changed transmitter locations to a new tower in Loganville, that the station shares with Salem-owned WFSH-FM, which improved south metro coverage for the 106.7 signal. In 2007, ABC, under the ownership of The Walt Disney Company, decided to sell all of its radio stations to Citadel Media.

=== Oldies/classic hits (2008–2012) ===
On February 29, 2008, Citadel announced that WYAY would drop its country format for oldies. A majority of the on-air talent was released, including Rhubarb Jones, who had served at the station since 1985. This format change was triggered by Citadel&#x27;s financial hardships that occurred after the company&#x27;s purchase of ABC Radio. Jones had been the longest-running morning DJ on Atlanta radio. Dallas McCade and traffic reporter Greg Talmadge were the only on-air survivors of the switch to oldies. They later moved to co-owned country station WKHX. Jones died in 2017.

On March 9, 2008 at 12:56 p.m., WYAY played its last country song, &quot;Stealing Cinderella&quot; by Chuck Wicks. The station then aired a live NASCAR radio broadcast (the Kobalt Tools 500 from Atlanta Motor Speedway). Then at 7:00 p.m., just after the race had finished, the station switched to an oldies format, rebranding itself as &quot;True Oldies 106.7&quot;. The first song played was &quot;Revolution&quot; by The Beatles. The station featured the syndicated Imus in the Morning and ABC&#x27;s The True Oldies Channel all day, similar to a format flip that occurred on sister station WJZW in Washington, D.C., on February 29, 2008. The oldies format had been absent from the metro Atlanta area for several years. WYAY promoted a playlist of over 5,000 songs, while most oldies stations only play a fraction of that many titles.

On November 7, 2008, WYAY announced that it would not carry NASCAR races in 2009, and would become the new FM home of Georgia Tech football and men&#x27;s basketball.

On April 6, 2009, it was announced that Imus would move from WYAY to talk station WCFO. The &quot;Spiff &amp; Fred Show&quot;, hosted by former Fox 97 personality Spiff Carner with co-host Freddie Brooks, moved from afternoons to mornings to replace Imus.
On November 22, 2010, the station changed its branding to &quot;106.7 Atlanta&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;, dropping The True Oldies Channel network, and shifted its format to a mix of hit songs from the 1970s and 1980s, eliminating songs from the 1960s.

Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011.

===All news (2012–2014)===

On April 6, 2012, Cumulus registered the domain name AllNews1067.com. On April 27, Cumulus announced the switch to &quot;All News 106.7&quot; would be sometime in May. CNN Radio, based in Atlanta, had discontinued operations several months earlier, with WYAY hiring many former CNN Radio employees to staff the station, including Greg Black, Maria Boynton, Andy Rose, Andy Flick, Michelle Wright and Jackie Howard. The station also hired Marshall Adams, former program director for KDKA in Pittsburgh. WYAY also partnered with WAGA-TV for weather and traffic reports, as well as WCNN for sports updates.

In May 2012, an application was filed with the FCC to change the frequency from 106.7 to 106.5, change the city of license from Gainesville to Sandy Springs, and change class from C to C1, any of which would require a rulemaking proceeding to amend the FCC table of allotments. In addition, it would affect co-channel WSKZ in Chattanooga, also owned by Cumulus. That station would have to reduce its signal strength toward the south and southeast to prevent RF interference between the two. WYAY&#x27;s application lists the Inman Park tower east of downtown Atlanta as the proposed site. This was built for WUPA, although that station has since moved. However, in June 2012, the FCC denied the application.

On May 29, 2012 at 4:50 a.m., WYAY ended its classic hits format by playing &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot; by Queen, &quot;Last Dance&quot; by Donna Summer, and &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; by the Beatles. This would be followed by a 10 minute stunt montage of random song and movie soundclips, with a common theme of them being themed around news. At 5:00 a.m., the station began its all-news format. Ratings during this time were poor.

On October 21, 2013, Cumulus announced the first of two changes to the station&#x27;s programming, with former WGST host Kim Peterson, better known as &quot;The Kimmer&quot;, hosting a midday talk and interview program for WYAY known as &quot;Newsmakers&quot; beginning the following month. WYAY also became the flagship station for the Atlanta Braves Radio Network effective with the start of the 2014 season.

===News/talk (2014–2019)===

On May 12, 2014, WYAY relaunched with a news/talk format, branded as &quot;Newsradio 106.7&quot;. The station began to focus more on talk shows and slowly phased out its remaining all-news blocks. Over time, the only all-news block was weekday morning drive time. In January 2018, the station relaunched again as &quot;Talk 106.7&quot; with an emphasis on personality-driven programming, and no all-news blocks.

On February 13, 2019, Cumulus Media announced it would sell six stations, including WYAY, to the Educational Media Foundation for $103.5 million. Also included were stations in New York City, Washington, D.C., San Jose, Savannah and Syracuse. As a result of the impending format change, Atlanta Braves broadcasts would move back to WNNX and WCNN.

=== Christian music (2019–present) ===
On May 31, 2019, WYAY concluded its talk format. Throughout the day, the hosts allowed listeners to call in and share their thoughts about the end of the station. At 7:00 p.m. that evening, EMF officially took over the station and began airing K-Love programming. Upon taking over the station, EMF changed the station&#x27;s call letters to WAKL, a call sign previously held on the K-Love station in Flint, Michigan.

The Atlanta radio market is now served by three Contemporary Christian music stations: WAKL, sister station WAIA, which plays EMF&#x27;s nationally syndicated &quot;Air1&quot; network, and WVFJ-FM. All three stations are supported by listener contributions.

EMF turned on the HD signal on July 30, 2019, and has its sister networks &quot;Air1&quot; on 106.7-HD2, and Classic contemporary Christian Music &quot;K-Love Classics&quot; on 106.7-HD3.

<doc id="508734" wikidata="Q851576" url="?curid=508734" title="Nyala, South Darfur">
<text>Nyala (Daju: &quot;the place of chatting&quot;) is a city and the capital of the state of South Darfur in the south-west of Sudan, with an estimated population of 1,100,000 in 2024.

==History==
Nyala was the capital of the Daju Empire, which was established around Jebel Um-Kurdós. However, many sites of ancient antiquities, pottery, engraved pictures of battles, horses, animals and hunting are still awaiting further scientific archaeological work at Jebel Daju. The most important archaeological sites discovered yet are Nari, Kedingnyir, Dobo, Simiat Hills, Jebel Keima, Kalokitting, Jebel Wara, and Jebel Marra itself. 

When the United Kingdom conquered present-day Sudan, the British commander-in-chief met Sultan Adam Suleiman in 1932, seeking his advice for his knowledge of the best places in terms of availability of water sources and land topography in order to establish the British Administration Headquarters in Darfur. Sultan Adam Suleiman had chosen Nyala for that purpose. 

===Darfur conflict===
During the Darfur conflict, thousands of internally displaced persons have gathered near the city in the hopes of protection. The refugee camp in the southern portion of Nyala is Kalma. Around 90,000 people reside in the camp.

===Sudan war===
In April 2023, the east of the city and the airport were captured by the RSF during the Sudanese civil war. 
Afterwards, satellite images captured neighbouring villages destroyed by the militias, as well as parts of Nyala. According to local activists, over 600,000 people have been displaced from the region and are unable to receive humanitarian aid due to the fighting. While a ceasefire was declared, sporadic fighting occasionally broke out in the city throughout May. Later that year, on 26 October, reports stated that RSF took control of Nyala, as the conflict forced more than 670,000 people to flee their homes.

==Economy==

Local industries produce textiles, as well as processed food and leather goods. Nyala has terminus ends for both road and railway, and also has a domestic airport, Nyala Airport. Nyala serves as a trading place for gum arabic and has branches of the Agricultural Bank of Sudan and the People&#x27;s Cooperative Bank. Nyala is home to Nyala University, a public university.
== Water infrastructure ==

Nyala suffers from severe water infrastructure problems caused by droughts and poor water management, including poor source treatment and delivery methods. Most of the water used in and around Nyala is ground water; this is heavily contaminated due to human activity, bearing the consequences of inadequate waste management and lack of proper sanitation. Water resources in the city have tested to contain bacteria levels higher than permissible amounts, which in turn creates health issues. In many cases the water collected for distribution is not properly chlorinated, allowing further increase in bacteria levels.

== Education ==
The educational institutions in the country nearly doubled between the years of 2000 and 2010. In the year 2000 there were 135 primary schools and 58 secondary schools; in 2010 there were 308 primary schools and 106 secondary schools. The main concern with the educational system in the city is the quality of the education. The schools’ staff is underpaid and unqualified for adequate teaching in these institutions. The government often does not commit to their financial responsibility with the schools. This affects the schools’ operations and burdens the schools to invest from their resources. Also, many children do not attend school so they can work and add to their family’s income.

==Climate==
Despite receiving almost of rainfall annually, Nyala has a marginal hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;), just below a hot semi-desert climate (&quot;BSh&quot;), owing to the extremely high potential evapotranspiration.

== The Amel Center ==
Run by Mossaad Mohamed Ali Mossaad and former Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan, the Amel Center is a treatment and rehabilitation center in Nyala for victims of torture. The center has earned Mossaad and Annan the Olof Palme Prize. Mohammed Ahmed Abdallah served as director of the center until 2007, earning the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award for his work.

<text>Intracranial pressure (ICP) is the pressure exerted by fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inside the skull and on the brain tissue. ICP is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and at rest, is normally 7–15 mmHg for a supine adult. This equals to 9–20 cmH2O, which is a common scale used in lumbar punctures. The body has various mechanisms by which it keeps the ICP stable, with CSF pressures varying by about 1 mmHg in normal adults through shifts in production and absorption of CSF.

Changes in ICP are attributed to volume changes in one or more of the constituents contained in the cranium. CSF pressure has been shown to be influenced by abrupt changes in intrathoracic pressure during coughing (which is induced by contraction of the diaphragm and abdominal wall muscles, the latter of which also increases intra-abdominal pressure), the valsalva maneuver, and communication with the vasculature (venous and arterial systems).

Intracranial hypertension (IH), also called increased ICP (IICP) or raised intracranial pressure (RICP), refers to elevated pressure in the cranium. 20–25 mmHg is the upper limit of normal at which treatment is necessary, though it is common to use 15 mmHg as the threshold for beginning treatment.

==Signs and symptoms of raised intracranial pressure==
In general, symptoms and signs that suggest a rise in ICP include headache, vomiting without nausea, ocular palsies, altered level of consciousness, back pain and papilledema. If papilledema is protracted, it may lead to visual disturbances, optic atrophy, and eventually blindness. The headache is classically a morning headache that may wake the person up. The brain is relatively poorly supplied by oxygen as a result of mild hypoventilation during the sleeping hours leading to hypercapnia and vasodilation. Cerebral edema may worsen during the night due to the lying position. The headache is worse on coughing, sneezing, or bending, and progressively worsens over time. There may also be personality or behavioral changes.

In addition to the above, if mass effect is present with resulting displacement of brain tissue, additional signs may include pupillary dilatation, abducens palsies, and Cushing&#x27;s triad. Cushing&#x27;s triad involves an increased systolic blood pressure, a widened pulse pressure, bradycardia, and an abnormal respiratory pattern. In children, a low heart rate is especially suggestive of high ICP. Intracranial hypertension syndrome is characterized by an elevated ICP, papilledema, and headache with occasional abducens nerve paresis, absence of a space-occupying lesion or ventricular enlargement, and normal cerebrospinal fluid chemical and hematological constituents.

Irregular respirations occur when injury to parts of the brain interfere with the respiratory drive. Biot&#x27;s respiration, in which breathing is rapid for a period and then absent for a period, occurs because of injury to the cerebral hemispheres or diencephalon. Hyperventilation can occur when the brain stem or tegmentum is damaged.

As a rule, patients with normal blood pressure retain normal alertness with ICP of 25–40 mmHg (unless tissue shifts at the same time). Only when ICP exceeds 40–50 mmHg does CPP and cerebral perfusion decrease to a level that results in loss of consciousness. Any further elevations will lead to brain infarction and brain death.

In infants and small children, the effects of ICP differ because their cranial sutures have not closed. In infants, the fontanels (soft spots on the head where the skull bones have not yet fused) bulge when ICP gets too high. ICP correlates with intraocular pressure (IOP) but seems to lack the accuracy necessary for close management of intracranial pressure in the acute post-traumatic period.

Papilledema (swelling of the optic disc) can be a reliable sign of elevated ICP. Unlike other conditions that may result in the swelling of the optic disc, it is in the case of papilledema that vision may go largely unaffected.

==Causes of abnormal intracranial pressure==
===Increased ICP===
Causes of increased intracranial pressure can be classified by the mechanism in which ICP is increased:
* Mass effect such as brain tumor, infarction with edema, contusions, subdural or epidural hematoma, or abscesses all tend to deform the adjacent brain.
* Generalized brain swelling can occur in ischemic-anoxia states, acute liver failure, hypertensive encephalopathy, hypercarbia (hypercapnia), and Reye hepatocerebral syndrome. These conditions tend to decrease the cerebral perfusion pressure but with minimal tissue shifts.
* Increase in venous pressure can be due to venous sinus thrombosis, heart failure, or obstruction of superior mediastinal or jugular veins.
* Obstruction to CSF flow and/or absorption can occur in hydrocephalus (blockage in ventricles or subarachnoid space at base of brain, e.g., by Arnold–Chiari malformation), extensive meningeal disease (e.g., infection, carcinoma, granuloma, or hemorrhage), or obstruction in cerebral convexities and superior sagittal sinus (decreased absorption).
* Increased CSF production can occur in meningitis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or choroid plexus tumor.
* Idiopathic or unknown cause (idiopathic intracranial hypertension, a common cause in otherwise well people especially younger women)
* Craniosynostosis

One of the most damaging aspects of brain trauma and other conditions, directly correlated with poor outcome, is an elevated intracranial pressure. ICP is very likely to cause severe harm if it rises too high. Very high intracranial pressures are usually fatal if prolonged, but children can tolerate higher pressures for longer periods. An increase in pressure, most commonly due to head injury leading to intracranial hematoma or cerebral edema, can crush brain tissue, shift brain structures, contribute to hydrocephalus, cause brain herniation, and restrict blood supply to the brain. It is a cause of reflex bradycardia.

====Drug-induced intracranial hypertension====
Drug-induced intracranial hypertension (DIIH) or medication-induced intracranial hypertension is a condition of higher than normal intracranial pressure with the main cause being a drug. This condition is similar to idiopathic intracranial hypertension, however the etiology in this instance is a drug. The most frequent symptoms are headaches, pulsatile tinnitus, diplopia, and impairment of visual acuity. The only observable signs of the condition may be papilledema and bilateral sixth cranial nerve (abducens) palsies.

===Low ICP===

Spontaneous intracranial hypotension may occur as a result of an occult leak of CSF at the level of the spine, into another body cavity. More commonly, decreased ICP is the result of lumbar puncture or other medical procedure involving the spinal cord. Various medical imaging technologies exist to assist in identifying the cause of decreased ICP. Often, the syndrome is self-limiting, especially if it is the result of a medical procedure.

If persistent intracranial hypotension is the result of a lumbar puncture, a blood patch may be applied to seal the site of CSF leakage. Various medical treatments have been proposed; only the intravenous administration of caffeine and theophylline has shown to be particularly useful.

The International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) Third Edition diagnostic criteria for spontaneous intracranial hypotension includes any headache attributed to low CSF pressure (low CSF opening pressure) or CSF leakage (evidence of CSF leakage on imaging). Further, the headache must have a temporal relation to the low CSF pressure or leakage and the headache cannot be better explained by another ICHD diagnosis. The final criteria is that in the rare cases of spontaneous intracranial hypotension with no headache present, the neurologic symptoms that are present must be attributable to low CSF or explained by the diagnosis of spontaneous intracranial hypotension.

==Pathophysiology==
Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), the pressure of blood flowing to the brain, is normally fairly constant due to autoregulation, but for abnormal mean arterial pressure (MAP) or abnormal ICP the cerebral perfusion pressure is calculated by subtracting the intracranial pressure from the mean arterial pressure: CPP = MAP − ICP . One of the main dangers of increased ICP is that it can cause ischemia by decreasing CPP. Once the ICP approaches the level of the mean systemic pressure, cerebral perfusion falls. The body&#x27;s response to a fall in CPP is to raise systemic blood pressure and dilate cerebral blood vessels. This results in increased cerebral blood volume, which increases ICP, lowering CPP further and causing a vicious cycle. This results in widespread reduction in cerebral flow and perfusion, eventually leading to ischemia and brain infarction. Increased blood pressure can also make intracranial hemorrhages bleed faster, also increasing ICP.

Severely raised ICP, if caused by a unilateral space-occupying lesion (e.g. a hematoma) can result in midline shift, a dangerous sequela in which the brain moves toward one side as the result of massive swelling in a cerebral hemisphere. Midline shift can compress the ventricles and lead to hydrocephalus.

===Monro–Kellie hypothesis===
The pressure–volume relationship between ICP, volume of CSF, blood, and brain tissue, and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is known as the Monro–Kellie doctrine or hypothesis.

The Monro–Kellie hypothesis states that the cranial compartment is inelastic and that the volume inside the cranium is fixed. The cranium and its constituents (blood, CSF, and brain tissue) create a state of volume equilibrium, such that any increase in volume of one of the cranial constituents must be compensated by a decrease in volume of another. &quot;*This concept only applies to adults, as the presence of fontanelles and open suture lines in infants that have not yet fused means there is potential for a change in size and intracranial volume.&quot;

The principal buffers for increased volumes include CSF and, to a lesser extent, blood volume. These buffers respond to increases in volume of the remaining intracranial constituents. For example, an increase in lesion volume (e.g., epidural hematoma) will be compensated by the downward displacement of CSF and venous blood. Additionally, there is some evidence that brain tissue itself may provide an additional buffer for elevated ICP in circumstances of acute intracranial mass effect via cell volume regulation.

The Monro–Kellie hypothesis is named after Edinburgh doctors Alexander Monro and George Kellie.

==Diagnosis==
The most definitive way of measuring the intracranial pressure is with transducers placed within the brain. A catheter can be surgically inserted into one of the brain&#x27;s lateral ventricles and can be used to drain CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) in order to decrease ICPs. This type of drain is known as an external ventricular drain (EVD). This is rarely required outside brain injury and brain surgery settings.

In situations when only small amounts of CSF are to be drained to reduce ICP&#x27;s (e.g. in idiopathic intracranial hypertension), drainage of CSF via lumbar puncture can be used as a treatment. Non-invasive measurement of intracranial pressure is being studied.

==Treatment==
The treatment for ICP depends on the cause. In addition to management of the underlying causes, major considerations in acute treatment of increased ICP relates to the management of stroke and cerebral trauma.

For long-term or chronic forms of raised ICP, especially idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), a specific type of diuretic medication (acetazolamide) is used. In cases of confirmed brain neoplasm, dexamethasone is given to decrease ICP. Although the exact mechanism is unknown, current research shows that dexamethasone is capable of decreasing peritumoral water content and local tissue pressure to decrease ICP.

===Ventilation===
In people who have high ICP due to an acute injury, it is particularly important to ensure adequate airway, breathing, and oxygenation. Inadequate blood oxygen levels (hypoxia) or excessively high carbon dioxide levels (hypercapnia) cause cerebral blood vessels to dilate, increasing the flow of blood to the brain and causing the ICP to rise. Inadequate oxygenation also forces brain cells to produce energy using anaerobic metabolism, which produces lactic acid and lowers pH, also dilating blood vessels and exacerbating the problem. Conversely, blood vessels constrict when carbon dioxide levels are below normal, so hyperventilating a person with a ventilator or bag valve mask can temporarily reduce ICP. Hyperventilation was formerly a part of the standard treatment of traumatic brain injuries, but the induced constriction of blood vessels limits blood flow to the brain at a time when the brain may already be ischemic—hence it is no longer widely used. Furthermore, the brain adjusts to the new level of carbon dioxide after 48 to 72 hours of hyperventilation, which could cause the vessels to rapidly dilate if carbon-dioxide levels were returned to normal too quickly. Hyperventilation is still used if ICP is resistant to other methods of control, or there are signs of brain herniation, because the damage herniation can cause is so severe that it may be worthwhile to constrict blood vessels even if doing so reduces blood flow. ICP can also be lowered by raising the head of the bed, improving venous drainage. A side effect of this is that it could lower pressure of blood to the head, resulting in a reduced and possibly inadequate blood supply to the brain. Venous drainage may also be impeded by external factors such as hard collars to immobilize the neck in trauma patients, and this may also increase the ICP. Sandbags may be used to further limit neck movement.

===Medication===
In the hospital, the blood pressure can be increased in order to increase CPP, increase perfusion, oxygenate tissues, remove wastes, and thereby lessen swelling. Since hypertension is the body&#x27;s way of forcing blood into the brain, medical professionals do not normally interfere with it when it is found in a person with a head injury. When it is necessary to decrease cerebral blood flow, MAP can be lowered using common antihypertensive agents such as calcium channel blockers.

If there is an intact blood–brain barrier, osmotherapy (mannitol or hypertonic saline) may be used to decrease ICP.

It is unclear whether mannitol or hypertonic saline is superior, or if they improve outcomes.

Struggling, restlessness, and seizures can increase metabolic demands and oxygen consumption, as well as increasing blood pressure. Analgesia and sedation are used to reduce agitation and metabolic needs of the brain, but these medications may cause low blood pressure and other side effects. Thus if full sedation alone is ineffective, people may be paralyzed with drugs such as atracurium. Paralysis allows the cerebral veins to drain more easily, but can mask signs of seizures, and the drugs can have other harmful effects. Paralysing drugs are only introduced if patients are fully sedated (this is essentially the same as a general anaesthetic)

===Surgery===
Craniotomies are holes drilled in the skull with the help of cranial drills to remove intracranial hematomas or relieve pressure from parts of the brain. As raised ICP&#x27;s may be caused by the presence of a mass, removal of this via craniotomy will decrease raised ICP&#x27;s.

A drastic treatment for increased ICP is decompressive craniectomy, in which a part of the skull is removed and the dura mater is expanded to allow the brain to swell without crushing it or causing herniation. The section of bone removed, known as a bone flap, can be stored in the patient&#x27;s abdomen and resited back to complete the skull once the acute cause of raised ICP&#x27;s has resolved. Alternatively a synthetic material may be used to replace the removed bone section (see cranioplasty)

<text>WAMJ (107.5 FM, &quot;Majic 107.5/97.5&quot;) is a commercial radio station licensed to Roswell, Georgia, and serving Metro Atlanta. It airs an urban adult contemporary radio format, simulcasting with sister station 97.5 WUMJ in Fayetteville. The station is currently owned by Radio One, via licensee Radio One Licenses, LLC. The studios and offices are located inside the Centennial Tower building in downtown Atlanta.

WAMJ&#x27;s transmitter is on Goshen Springs Road in the Gwinnett Village section of Norcross, near Interstate 85. It has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 18,000 watts horizontal and 33,000 watts vertical, broadcasting from a tower at 185 meters (607 feet) in height above average terrain (HAAT). This gives WAMJ a good signal in Atlanta and its northern suburbs, but may not be received well south of Atlanta. To expand their coverage area, WAMJ simulcasts on WUMJ, with its tower located in Tyrone.

WAMJ broadcasts in HD Radio hybrid format. Its HD2 subchannel carries urban oldies music, known as &quot;Classix 102.9&quot;, and is rebroadcast on 125 watt FM translator W275BK at 102.9 MHz in Decatur.

==Programming==
Weekdays begin with the nationally syndicated &quot;Steve Harvey Morning Show.&quot; Maria Moore is heard middays, Ryan Cameron afternoons, Jerard J nights and Big Ray overnight.

==History==
===WTHA/first incarnation of WAMJ===
The station is the result of Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Docket 80-90, which reduced the required spacing between FM stations. That rule permitted a new FM station in the Atlanta area on 107.5 MHz. The original call sign was WTHA when the construction permit was issued at the beginning of October 1996. The original plan was to create a simulcast partner for 97.5 WHTA, with the new 107.5 using similar call letters.

By the time it signed on the air on February 6, 1998, it became &quot;Majic 107.5,&quot; broadcasting an R&amp;B format with the WAMJ call sign. This was the original incarnation of WAMJ and the &quot;Majic&quot; brand which, at first, lasted only three years.

===Smooth Jazz WJZZ-FM===
On June 27, 2001, that format and the WAMJ call sign were sent to also-new 102.5 FM as &quot;Grown Folks Radio.&quot; At the same time, 107.5 became WJZZ-FM &quot;Smooth Jazz 107.5&quot;. The WHTA call letters were moved to &quot;Hot 107.9&quot; a couple of months later, with all three stations owned by Radio One.

The on-air jingles heard on WJZZ-FM were similar to those heard on Clear Channel-owned smooth jazz stations, such as WSMJ Baltimore, WNUA Chicago, KKSF San Francisco, and WJJZ Philadelphia. However, the WJZZ-FM jingles used an opposite order of frequency and call letters. For WJZZ-FM, the frequency preceded the call sign.

The smooth jazz format enjoyed a surprisingly long era of success in the Atlanta radio market. Before smooth jazz came to 107.5 in 2001 for nine years, it had a six-year run on WJZF (now WALR-FM) from 1994 to 2000.

===Return of &quot;Majic 107.5&quot;===
On January 28, 2009, WJZZ dropped smooth jazz, and returned to an Urban AC format, resurrecting the original branding &quot;Majic 107.5.&quot; On February 16, 2009, the &quot;Praise 97.5&quot; format and WPZE call sign was moved to 102.5 FM. 97.5 FM then began simulcasting WJZZ-FM as &quot;Majic 107.5 | 97.5&quot; (and would adopt the WUMJ call letters).

After seven and a half years at 102.5, the WAMJ call sign returned to 107.5 on February 27, 2009. In light of the move, the old WAMJ moniker from its 102.5 days, &quot;Grown Folks Radio,&quot; was dropped.

===Atlanta&#x27;s Best Mix of R&amp;B===
The call letter switch to WAMJ also led to a change in slogans to &quot;Atlanta&#x27;s Best Mix of R&amp;B.&quot; This became the third incarnation of the urban AC format for WAMJ.

With the format shuffle, WAMJ incorporated more 1980s and 1990s R&amp;B into its playlist. This led competitor WALR-FM to adjust its Urban Oldies format to more recent adult music to maintain a competitive edge. WAMJ became the Atlanta home for the nationally syndicated &quot;Steve Harvey Morning Show&quot;; this was in contrast to most of Radio One&#x27;s Urban AC stations, which instead ran the &quot;Tom Joyner Morning Show.&quot;

WUMJ received a signal upgrade in 2013, going from 21,300 watts to 50,000 watts. The simulcast with 97.5 ended on January 10, 2016, as WUMJ&#x27;s signal now overlapped with WUMJ&#x27;s coverage area. However, WUMJ resumed its simulcast with WAMJ on July 29, 2016, when some listeners told management that they were not able to receive 107.5 MHz clearly.

<text>WHTA (107.9 FM) is a commercial radio station licensed to Hampton, Georgia, and serving the Atlanta metropolitan area. It is owned by Urban One mainstream urban radio format. The studios and offices are located inside the Centennial Tower building in downtown Atlanta.

The transmitter is off Swanson Road in Tyrone, Georgia, about 30 miles south southwest of Atlanta. At an effective radiated power (ERP) of 35,000 watts, the signal covers the city and its southern suburbs, and may not be easily received north of Atlanta.

==Programming==
The weekday on-air lineup includes the syndicated &quot;The Morning Hustle&quot;, which is based at WHTA. The station launched several careers, including rapper and actor Ludacris, when he was known as on-air personality &quot;Chris Lova Lova,&quot; as well as MTV VJs La La Anthony and K.K. Holiday.

==History==
===WCRY-FM Macon===
The station began as WCRY-FM in Macon, Georgia, about 85 miles south of Atlanta. It signed on the air on October 19, 1973, and was owned by Central Georgia Broadcasting. At first, it mostly simulcast its AM counterpart, WCRY at 900 kHz (now WYPZ). By the late 1970s, WCRY-FM was airing a beautiful music format. In 1981, it switched its call sign to WPEZ, playing easy listening music, powered at 100,000 watts. It later shifted to soft adult contemporary music as &quot;Lite Rock&quot; WPEZ. The station was later known as Z108 in the mid-1980s, which was one out of two stations using the &quot;Z&quot; name in the Macon market, with the other being WQBZ.

The station was acquired in 1996 by U.S. Broadcasting, which had plans to move it into the more lucrative Atlanta radio market. To gain Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approval, a few stations in Middle Georgia were relocated: WPEZ&#x27;s soft AC format was switched from 107.9 to an existing frequency at 93.7 in Jeffersonville, while the original Top 40 format on 93.7 was shifted to a new Macon-area station as WMGB at 95.1 MHz. U.S. Broadcasting petitioned the FCC to reallocate the broadcast license for 107.9 from Macon to Hampton.

With the FCC giving its OK, Radio One, a large minority-owned broadcasting company, paid $60 million for the new &quot;move in&quot; Atlanta-area station at 107.9. Radio One already owned a station in the Atlanta market, 97.5 WHTA, in Fayetteville, airing an urban contemporary format. WHTA had signed on as an urban station on July 17, 1995; Radio One had plans to put WHTA&#x27;s call letters and format on its new acquisition.

===WHTA Hot 107.9===
At first, Radio One did not want its competitors in Atlanta to figure out its game plan, so in September 2001, the new Atlanta-area 107.9 transmitter signed on as WEGF &quot;107.9 the End&quot; with a modern rock format. Stunting on its first day, it played &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; by Alien Ant Farm and &quot;Rollin&#x27;&quot; by Limp Bizkit continuously.

After several weeks with the rock format on 107.9 FM, &quot;Hot 97.5&quot; morning host Ryan Cameron made an announcement that &quot;Hot&quot; was moving to 107.9, revealing that the rock format was a publicity stunt. WHTA officially switched frequencies on November 1, 2001 and became &quot;Hot 107.9&quot;, while 97.5 became WPZE, playing urban gospel music. (WPZE later moved to 102.5 MHz in Mableton.)

WHTA&#x27;s move to 107.9 gave it a stronger signal over Intown Atlanta and surrounding suburbs, despite being considered a &quot;move-in&quot; station.

Residents in Tyrone near the station&#x27;s transmitter site complained to the FCC regarding electrical interference to personal devices, and Urban One increased the antenna&#x27;s height with FCC permission to address the issue, though some interference does remain.

===Digital Hip Hop===
On July 31, 2007, WHTA began using a new slogan, &quot;Hot 107.9, Your Digital Hip Hop Station&quot;.

In October 2008, WHTA became the Atlanta network affiliate of the &quot;Rickey Smiley Morning Show&quot;. It was originally based at co-owned KBFB in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex. In 2011, WHTA became the flagship station for the show.

In 2011, Radio One changed several of its Atlanta-area stations&#x27; formats and call signs; WAMJ moved from 102.5 to 107.5, and began simulcasting its Urban AC format on 97.5 as WUMJ, while WPZE&#x27;s urban gospel format moved from 97.5 to 102.5. That left WHTA as the only station in Radio One&#x27;s Atlanta cluster that was unaffected by the change.

Radio One was renamed Urban One on May 8, 2018.

==HD Radio==
On February 6, 2025, WHTA announced that it would simulcast WAGA-TV&#x27;s online streaming channel on its second HD Radio channel. The channel features live simulcasts of WAGA-TV&#x27;s news and sports programming, the talk show &quot;Portia&quot;, and replays of WAGA&#x27;s newscasts.

<doc id="508739" wikidata="Q900970" url="?curid=508739" title="Pyruvate kinase">
<text>Pyruvate kinase is the enzyme involved in the last step of glycolysis. It catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP), yielding one molecule of pyruvate and one molecule of ATP. Pyruvate kinase was inappropriately named (inconsistently with a conventional kinase) before it was recognized that it did not directly catalyze phosphorylation of pyruvate, which does not occur under physiological conditions. Pyruvate kinase is present in four distinct, tissue-specific isozymes in animals, each consisting of particular kinetic properties necessary to accommodate the variations in metabolic requirements of diverse tissues.

== Isozymes in vertebrates ==
Four isozymes of pyruvate kinase expressed in vertebrates: L (liver), R (erythrocytes), M1 (muscle and brain) and M2 (early fetal tissue and most adult tissues). The L and R isozymes are expressed by the gene PKLR, whereas the M1 and M2 isozymes are expressed by the gene PKM2. The R and L isozymes differ from M1 and M2 in that they are allosterically regulated. Kinetically, the R and L isozymes of pyruvate kinase have two distinct conformation states; one with a high substrate affinity and one with a low substrate affinity. The R-state, characterized by high substrate affinity, serves as the activated form of pyruvate kinase and is stabilized by PEP and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), promoting the glycolytic pathway. The T-state, characterized by low substrate affinity, serves as the inactivated form of pyruvate kinase, bound and stabilized by ATP and alanine, causing phosphorylation of pyruvate kinase and the inhibition of glycolysis. The M2 isozyme of pyruvate kinase can form tetramers or dimers. Tetramers have a high affinity for PEP, whereas, dimers have a low affinity for PEP. Enzymatic activity can be regulated by phosphorylating highly active tetramers of PKM2 into an inactive dimers.

The PKM gene consists of 12 exons and 11 introns. PKM1 and PKM2 are different splicing products of the M-gene (PKM1 contains exon 9 while PKM2 contains exon 10) and solely differ in 23 amino acids within a 56-amino acid stretch (aa 378-434) at their carboxy terminus. The PKM gene is regulated through heterogenous ribonucleotide proteins like hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2. Human PKM2 monomer has 531 amino acids and is a single chain divided into A, B and C domains. The difference in amino acid sequence between PKM1 and PKM2 allows PKM2 to be allosterically regulated by FBP and for it to form dimers and tetramers while PKM1 can only form tetramers.

== Isozymes in bacteria ==
Many Enterobacteriaceae, including &quot;E. coli&quot;, have two isoforms of pyruvate kinase, PykA and PykF, which are 37% identical in &quot;E. coli&quot; (Uniprot: PykA, PykF). They catalyze the same reaction as in eukaryotes, namely the generation of ATP from ADP and PEP, the last step in glycolysis, a step that is irreversible under physiological conditions. PykF is allosterically regulated by FBP which reflects the central position of PykF in cellular metabolism. PykF transcription in &quot;E. coli&quot; is regulated by the global transcriptional regulator, Cra (FruR). PfkB was shown to be inhibited by MgATP at low concentrations of Fru-6P, and this regulation is important for gluconeogenesis.

==Reaction==

=== Glycolysis ===
There are two steps in the pyruvate kinase reaction in glycolysis. First, PEP transfers a phosphate group to ADP, producing ATP and the enolate of pyruvate. Secondly, a proton must be added to the enolate of pyruvate to produce the functional form of pyruvate that the cell requires. Because the substrate for pyruvate kinase is a simple phospho-sugar, and the product is an ATP, pyruvate kinase is a possible foundation enzyme for the evolution of the glycolysis cycle, and may be one of the most ancient enzymes in all earth-based life. Phosphoenolpyruvate may have been present abiotically, and has been shown to be produced in high yield in a primitive triose glycolysis pathway.
In yeast cells, the interaction of yeast pyruvate kinase (YPK) with PEP and its allosteric effector Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP,) was found to be enhanced by the presence of Mg2+. Therefore, Mg2+ was concluded to be an important cofactor in the catalysis of PEP into pyruvate by pyruvate kinase. Furthermore, the metal ion Mn2+ was shown to have a similar, but stronger effect on YPK than Mg2+. The binding of metal ions to the metal binding sites on pyruvate kinase enhances the rate of this reaction. 
The reaction catalyzed by pyruvate kinase is the final step of glycolysis. It is one of three rate-limiting steps of this pathway. Rate-limiting steps are the slower, regulated steps of a pathway and thus determine the overall rate of the pathway. In glycolysis, the rate-limiting steps are coupled to either the hydrolysis of ATP or the phosphorylation of ADP, causing the pathway to be energetically favorable and essentially irreversible in cells. This final step is highly regulated and deliberately irreversible because pyruvate is a crucial intermediate building block for further metabolic pathways. Once pyruvate is produced, it either enters the TCA cycle for further production of ATP under aerobic conditions, or is converted to lactic acid or ethanol under anaerobic conditions.

=== Gluconeogenesis: the reverse reaction ===
Pyruvate kinase also serves as a regulatory enzyme for gluconeogenesis, a biochemical pathway in which the liver generates glucose from pyruvate and other substrates. Gluconeogenesis utilizes noncarbohydrate sources to provide glucose to the brain and red blood cells in times of starvation when direct glucose reserves are exhausted. During fasting state, pyruvate kinase is inhibited, thus preventing the &quot;leak-down&quot; of phosphoenolpyruvate from being converted into pyruvate; instead, phosphoenolpyruvate is converted into glucose via a cascade of gluconeogenesis reactions. Although it utilizes similar enzymes, gluconeogenesis is not the reverse of glycolysis. It is instead a pathway that circumvents the irreversible steps of glycolysis. Furthermore, gluconeogenesis and glycolysis do not occur concurrently in the cell at any given moment as they are reciprocally regulated by cell signaling. Once the gluconeogenesis pathway is complete, the glucose produced is expelled from the liver, providing energy for the vital tissues in the fasting state.

==Regulation==
Glycolysis is highly regulated at three of its catalytic steps: the phosphorylation of glucose by hexokinase, the phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate by phosphofructokinase, and the transfer of phosphate from PEP to ADP by pyruvate kinase. Under wild-type conditions, all three of these reactions are irreversible, have a large negative free energy and are responsible for the regulation of this pathway. Pyruvate kinase activity is most broadly regulated by allosteric effectors, covalent modifiers and hormonal control. However, the most significant pyruvate kinase regulator is fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), which serves as an allosteric effector for the enzyme.

=== Allosteric effectors ===
Allosteric regulation is the binding of an effector to a site on the protein other than the active site, causing a conformational change and altering the activity of that given protein or enzyme. Pyruvate kinase has been found to be allosterically activated by FBP and allosterically inactivated by ATP and alanine. Pyruvate Kinase tetramerization is promoted by FBP and Serine while tetramer dissociation is promoted by L-Cysteine.

==== Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate ====
FBP is the most significant source of regulation because it comes from within the glycolysis pathway. FBP is a glycolytic intermediate produced from the phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate. FBP binds to the allosteric binding site on domain C of pyruvate kinase and changes the conformation of the enzyme, causing the activation of pyruvate kinase activity. As an intermediate present within the glycolytic pathway, FBP provides feedforward stimulation because the higher the concentration of FBP, the greater the allosteric activation and magnitude of pyruvate kinase activity. Pyruvate kinase is most sensitive to the effects of FBP. As a result, the remainder of the regulatory mechanisms serve as secondary modification.

=== Covalent modifiers ===
Covalent modifiers serve as indirect regulators by controlling the phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, acetylation, succinylation and oxidation of enzymes, resulting in the activation and inhibition of enzymatic activity. In the liver, glucagon and epinephrine activate protein kinase A, which serves as a covalent modifier by phosphorylating and deactivating pyruvate kinase. In contrast, the secretion of insulin in response to blood sugar elevation activates phosphoprotein phosphatase I, causing the dephosphorylation and activation of pyruvate kinase to increase glycolysis. The same covalent modification has the opposite effect on gluconeogenesis enzymes. This regulation system is responsible for the avoidance of a futile cycle through the prevention of simultaneous activation of pyruvate kinase and enzymes that catalyze gluconeogenesis.

=== Hormonal control ===
In order to prevent a futile cycle, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis are heavily regulated in order to ensure that they are never operating in the cell at the same time. As a result, the inhibition of pyruvate kinase by glucagon, cyclic AMP and epinephrine, not only shuts down glycolysis, but also stimulates gluconeogenesis. Alternatively, insulin interferes with the effect of glucagon, cyclic AMP and epinephrine, causing pyruvate kinase to function normally and gluconeogenesis to be shut down. Furthermore, glucose was found to inhibit and disrupt gluconeogenesis, leaving pyruvate kinase activity and glycolysis unaffected. Overall, the interaction between hormones plays a key role in the functioning and regulation of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis in the cell.

==== Inhibitory effect of metformin ====
Metformin, or dimethylbiguanide, is the primary treatment used for type 2 diabetes. Metformin has been shown to indirectly affect pyruvate kinase through the inhibition of gluconeogenesis. Specifically, the addition of metformin is linked to a marked decrease in glucose flux and increase in lactate/pyruvate flux from various metabolic pathways. Although metformin does not directly affect pyruvate kinase activity, it causes a decrease in the concentration of ATP. Due to the allosteric inhibitory effects of ATP on pyruvate kinase, a decrease in ATP results in diminished inhibition and the subsequent stimulation of pyruvate kinase. Consequently, the increase in pyruvate kinase activity directs metabolic flux through glycolysis rather than gluconeogenesis.

=== Gene Regulation ===
Heterogenous ribonucleotide proteins (hnRNPs) can act on the PKM gene to regulate expression of M1 and M2 isoforms. PKM1 and PKM2 isoforms are splice variants of the PKM gene that differ by a single exon. Various types of hnRNPs such as hnRNPA1 and hnRNPA2 enter the nucleus during hypoxia conditions and modulate expression such that PKM2 is up-regulated. Hormones such as insulin up-regulate expression of PKM2 while hormones like tri-iodothyronine (T3) and glucagon aid in down-regulating PKM2.

==== Carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) ====
ChREBP is a transcription factor that regulates expression of the L isozyme of pyruvate kinase. A glucose-sensing module contains domains that are targets for regulatory phosphorylation based on the concentrations of glucose and cAMP, which then control its import into the nucleus. It may also be further activated by directly binding glucose-6-phosphate. Once in the nucleus, its DNA binding domains activate pyruvate kinase transcription. Therefore, high glucose and low cAMP causes dephosphorylation of ChREBP, which then upregulates expression of pyruvate kinase in the liver.

==Clinical applications==

=== Deficiency ===
Genetic defects of this enzyme cause the disease known as pyruvate kinase deficiency. In this condition, a lack of pyruvate kinase slows down the process of glycolysis. This effect is especially devastating in cells that lack mitochondria, because these cells must use anaerobic glycolysis as their sole source of energy because the TCA cycle is not available. For example, red blood cells, which in a state of pyruvate kinase deficiency, rapidly become deficient in ATP and can undergo hemolysis. Therefore, pyruvate kinase deficiency can cause chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (CNSHA).

==== PK-LR gene mutation ====
Pyruvate kinase deficiency is caused by an autosomal recessive trait. Mammals have two pyruvate kinase genes, PK-LR (which encodes for pyruvate kinase isozymes L and R) and PK-M (which encodes for pyruvate kinase isozyme M1), but only PKLR encodes for the red blood isozyme which effects pyruvate kinase deficiency. Over 250 PK-LR gene mutations have been identified and associated with pyruvate kinase deficiency. DNA testing has guided the discovery of the location of PKLR on chromosome 1 and the development of direct gene sequencing tests to molecularly diagnose pyruvate kinase deficiency.

=== Applications of pyruvate kinase inhibition ===

==== Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Inhibition ====
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are chemically reactive forms of oxygen. In human lung cells, ROS has been shown to inhibit the M2 isozyme of pyruvate kinase (PKM2). ROS achieves this inhibition by oxidizing Cys358 and inactivating PKM2. As a result of PKM2 inactivation, glucose flux is no longer converted into pyruvate, but is instead utilized in the pentose phosphate pathway, resulting in the reduction and detoxification of ROS. In this manner, the harmful effects of ROS are increased and cause greater oxidative stress on the lung cells, leading to potential tumor formation. This inhibitory mechanism is important because it may suggest that the regulatory mechanisms in PKM2 are responsible for aiding cancer cell resistance to oxidative stress and enhanced tumorigenesis.

==== Phenylalanine inhibition ====
Phenylalanine is found to function as a competitive inhibitor of pyruvate kinase in the brain. Although the degree of phenylalanine inhibitory activity is similar in both fetal and adult cells, the enzymes in the fetal brain cells are significantly more vulnerable to inhibition than those in adult brain cells. A study of PKM2 in babies with the genetic brain disease phenylketonurics (PKU), showed elevated levels of phenylalanine and decreased effectiveness of PKM2. This inhibitory mechanism provides insight into the role of pyruvate kinase in brain cell damage.

=== Pyruvate Kinase in Cancer ===
Cancer cells have characteristically accelerated metabolic machinery and Pyruvate Kinase is believed to have a role in cancer. When compared to healthy cells, cancer cells have elevated levels of the PKM2 isoform, specifically the low activity dimer. Therefore, PKM2 serum levels are used as markers for cancer. The low activity dimer allows for build-up of phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP), leaving large concentrations of glycolytic intermediates for synthesis of biomolecules that will eventually be used by cancer cells. Phosphorylation of PKM2 by Mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (ERK2) causes conformational changes that allow PKM2 to enter the nucleus and regulate glycolytic gene expression required for tumor development. Some studies state that there is a shift in expression from PKM1 to PKM2 during carcinogenesis. Tumor microenvironments like hypoxia activate transcription factors like the hypoxia-inducible factor to promote the transcription of PKM2, which forms a positive feedback loop to enhance its own transcription.

==Alternatives==
A reversible enzyme with a similar function, pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK), is found in some bacteria and has been transferred to a number of anaerobic eukaryote groups (for example, &quot;Streblomastix&quot;, &quot;Giardia&quot;, &quot;Entamoeba&quot;, and &quot;Trichomonas&quot;), it seems via horizontal gene transfer on two or more occasions. In some cases, the same organism will have both pyruvate kinase and PPDK.

<text>Nikolaus Alois Maria Vinzenz Negrelli, Ritter von Moldelbe (born Luigi Negrelli; 23 January 1799 – 1 October 1858) was a Tyrolean civil engineer and railroad pioneer mostly active in parts of the Austrian Empire, Switzerland, Germany and Italy.

==Biography==
Alois Negrelli was born Luigi Negrelli as the seventh of ten children to an Italian-speaking father and a German-speaking mother in Fiera di Primiero (German ) in the Dolomites. The village is situated in the Trentino (), once the south of the County of Tyrol (then with the Austrian Empire, today in northern Italy). Being in part of &quot;Welschtyrolean&quot; heritage (Romance-speaking southern Tyroleans), the father and one of his older sisters actively supported the Tyrolean Rebellion of 1809, led by Andreas Hofer against the occupation of their homeland by French and Bavarian troops. Alois&#x27;s father was held prisoner for years, finally returning home in 1814. The family, having lost a substantial part of their wealth, struggled at first to enable good education and safe livelihood for Alois and his siblings. This toil was facilitated by governmental authorities in recognition of their commitment. Alois Negrelli received an Austrian scholarship and went to secondary school in Feltre in 1812, together with his brothers. He later studied in Padua and Innsbruck in 1817, the capital of the Crownland of Tyrol.

===Civil engineering===
After beginning his career in 1818 as assistant to the Department of Construction in Innsbruck, Austria, he also worked in Vorarlberg from 1825 onwards residing in Bregenz. Negrelli constructed the &quot;Gschwendtobel-Brücke&quot; in Lingenau, a covered wooden bridge still in existence, and earned a reputation for taking part in the channelisation of the Alpenrhein and of the various Austrian and Swiss interests connected therewith. He moved to Switzerland in 1832 and took part in the erection of various constructions in the Canton of St. Gallen. In 1835, Negrelli was called to Zürich, where he continued with similar activity, notably working on the &quot;Münsterbrücke&quot; (Munster Bridge) crossing the Limmat together with Ferdinand Stadler, who was responsible for the carpentry. Stone bridges were still built over a wooden timber frame at this time. He also created the new &quot;Kornhaus&quot; (granary) in 1839 which later became the first &quot;Tonhalle&quot; (concert hall) of Zürich. In 1895 it was replaced by a newly constructed second building for this purpose.

===Railway construction===
Beginning in 1836 Negrelli started planning a first railway line in this country. The Swiss Northern Railway was built years later in 1846 from Zürich to Baden, Switzerland, under his supervision. At around this time he was also appointed to different governmental commissions, working for other cantons. During a journey to England, France and Belgium he, like many other engineers, studied recent advances in railway construction and subsequently published his ideas of adapting this technology to mountainous regions in papers, receiving wide attention in the industry. In 1837 he advocated the creation of the railway Innsbruck–Kufstein in Tyrol and made preliminary plans for it, upon which the project was later based.

Negrelli returned to working in Austria in 1840. He was chosen as inspector general for the private Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway, and the Northern State Railway in 1842. He was responsible for the construction of the railway lines from Vienna via Prague to the German border in direction of Dresden, and via Ostrava to the Polish border in direction of Kraków. Negrelli prepared the railway to the then Austrian Lviv and the extension to the Russian border further east. He led the construction of the Negrelli Viaduct between 1846 and 1849, a railway bridge crossing the Vltava (Moldau) river in Prague, with 1,110 m the longest bridge of its kind in Europe until 1910 Negrelli&#x27;s authority in railway matters was of particular relevance in the process of decisions to have the mountainous Semmering railway built by a fellow engineer, Carl von Ghega, in 1848 and his advice was requested for projects by various other states like the Kingdom of Württemberg and the Kingdom of Saxony in Germany. In 1849, Negrelli was to travel to the then Austrian Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia with the task to oversee work on public buildings, railways and telegraph lines, and heading a commission regulating traffic on the river Po. In 1850 he was awarded for his services and received a title of nobility with the designation &quot;Ritter von Moldelbe&quot;, chosen by himself in memory of his times working on the rivers Vltava/Moldau and Elbe. After arriving back in Vienna in 1855, Negrelli was appointed inspector general of the newly founded Imperial Royal Privileged Austrian State Railway Company until 1857. It would later become the &quot;Staats-Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft&quot; (State Railway Company), one of the biggest railway enterprises of the Austrian Empire.

===Channelisation projects in Egypt===
Negrelli, like many other engineers of his time, had thought about possibilities to build an artificial waterway to connect the Mediterranean Sea with the Red Sea from 1836 onwards. In 1846 he had been invited by Barthélemy Prosper Enfantin to the Société d&#x27;Études du Canal de Suez and took part in the exploration tour to the isthmus of Suez in 1847. Because of the outbreak of revolutions of 1848 and the following years, and other circumstances the had to cease activities, Negrelli himself being sent to Lombardy–Venetia at that time.

In 1855 Negrelli was invited by Ferdinand de Lesseps to participate again, now in the International Commission for the piercing of the isthmus of Suez (). Consisting of thirteen experts from seven countries who were to examine the plans made by Linant de Bellefonds it had to advise on the feasibility of and on the best route for a canal project. Negrelli formed part of the surveying group travelling to Egypt in late 1855 and early 1856. In the final deliberations of the commission in Paris at the end of June 1856, his principal ideas of a canal without locks and a northern entry further to the west prevailed. A comprehensive final report was produced, including plans and profiles, according to which the Suez Canal was later to be built by the Suez Canal Company, established in late 1858 by Lesseps.

The Suez Canal project, as the first of its kind in modern times, caused headlines. Since the had presented their report in 1856 critics were agitating against it to a great degree, among them Robert Stephenson, son of railway pioneer George Stephenson. Negrelli and others declared active support. The quarrel between defenders and repudiators went on for a time, this exchange was followed by publications throughout Europe, especially in France, Austria and the United Kingdom. Negrelli was prevented from travelling to Egypt another time and meeting with Lesseps, who went to London, in June 1858. Feeling unwell, he used his leave from work to stay in a health resort for recovery. On the way back, Negrelli was able to attend a congress on railway development held in Trieste before he arrived at home in Vienna. Already seriously ill by September, he managed to write one last reply on the comments of Stephenson. Negrelli&#x27;s response was published in the &quot;Oesterreichische Zeitung&quot; (&quot;Austrian Gazette&quot;) on 26 September 1858.

Alois Negrelli von Moldelbe died in the morning hours of 1 October 1858 at age 59, probably from food poisoning causing bacterial infection. His death occurred only weeks shy of witnessing the establishment of the Suez Canal Company, and just half a year before the works on the canal project were to officially begin.

In his book &quot;Transportation and Communication of Egypt&quot;, Negrelli wrote in 1856 about the Suez Canal:
The connection of the two seas by a maritime canal, shortening the route between Europe and the rich countries of the Old World located at the Indian Ocean, not only for the development of global trade but also for the increase of cabotage (domestical shipping) for Egypt, related to the prosperity of inbound welfare to this country so blessed, is an undeniable necessity.

<doc id="508742" wikidata="Q18409139" url="?curid=508742" title="College of San Mateo">
<text>College of San Mateo (CSM) is a public community college in San Mateo, California. It is part of the San Mateo County Community College District. College of San Mateo is located at the northern corridor of Silicon Valley and situated on a 153-acre site in the San Mateo hills. The college currently serves approximately 15,000 day, evening and weekend students. The college offers 69 A.A./A.S. degree majors and 81 certificate programs.

==History==
William L. Glascock, the principal of San Mateo High School, first proposed a junior college for San Mateo in the early 1920s as an alternative to the traditional four-year college. Tuition at four-year institutions cost up to per year at the time; at the junior college, students could instead live at home while earning credit equivalent to the freshman and sophomore years of a four-year school. The college was initially founded as the San Mateo Junior College (SMJC) after being approved by voters on March 31, 1922. The first classes started on August 22 of that year in a building shared with San Mateo High School. The first registered student was Marjorie Brace, who could not attend Stanford because of the high cost of tuition. She joined an initial class of 30 students, which would grow to 48 by the end of the academic year. The typical target for students graduating from the junior college was either Berkeley or Stanford; although the junior college was &quot;in a valley between two mountains of conceit—Stanford and the University of California&quot; as described by early faculty, the curriculum at San Mateo was designed to allow graduating students to continue studies at the larger four-year institutions.

The school colors of blue and white were chosen, according to anecdotes from early graduates, either from the colors of those two targets (white from Stanford, blue from Berkeley), or because those were the leftover ribbon colors from a student tasked with decorating a dance. The origins of the bulldog mascot are similarly murky: either all other animals had already been chosen by other colleges, or a local kennel which specialized in raising English bulldogs offered to have one of their animals, &quot;Rival Goldstone&quot;, appear at sporting events.

Second year students would haze incoming freshmen in one of the earliest traditions at SMJC, which required first year male students to carry decorated wooden paddles. Sophomore students would stop first-years so they could &quot;frequently and strenuously [apply the paddle] for any of a dozen real or imagined infractions.&quot; Hazing culminated in an all-day event held semi-annually called &quot;The Brawl&quot;, which was filmed by Fox Movietone News on February 19, 1928. Incoming dean Charles S. Morris ended physical hazing in 1931.

Dean Morris had a fatal heart attack in 1952, and students and faculty members began proposing a name change for SMJC. Proposed names included San Mateo College, San Mateo City College, and Peninsula College, but the name was finally changed to College of San Mateo on April 14, 1954, in part because the initials (CSM) would also honor the memory of Dean Morris.

===Enrollment===
Enrollment at SMJC grew rapidly from the initial class of 30 in 1922: 137 students enrolled in 1923, and the freshman class alone was 102 in 1924. SMJC reached enrollments of 430 students (250 freshmen) in 1926 and 480 students in 1927, when classes moved back to the Baldwin campus. It was the only junior college on the Peninsula until 1935 and attracted commuter students from San Francisco (who used San Francisco and San Mateo Electric Railway and/or Peninsula Commute trains), San Jose, and the East Bay. By 1935, enrollment had reached 1,500, but fell back to 1,000 when San Francisco Junior College opened that fall.

The first classes for workers to develop additional skills were offered in 1932, when a vocational class in aeronautics started. An Adult Program was introduced in 1936 for evening classes at the Baldwin campus, and 500 students signed up by the end of the first week. By 1943, 5,073 were enrolled in evening classes. During World War II, enrollment dropped as many potential students were serving in the military instead; SMJC shifted to teaching servicemen and radar courses. Unused land at Delaware was planted with crops as a victory garden. The college set up a Community Canning Center in June 1944 and had produced 108,000 cans by the end of the year. Enrollment rebounded after the war; although there were only 35 graduates in 1945, there were 1,800 students enrolled in 1946 and 2,400 in 1947, with 307 graduating in 1949. 5,621 attended classes on September 30, 1963, the first day of classes at the new College Heights campus.

As initially founded, SMJC served students matriculating from the San Mateo Union High School District; Jefferson Union and Half Moon Bay were added in 1937; Sequoia Union and South San Francisco followed in the 1960s; and the college served all San Mateo County residents by 1976, when the La Honda-Pescadero Unified School District joined.

===San Mateo Community College District===
By then, two more campuses had opened in what had become the San Mateo County Community College District alongside the College of San Mateo: Cañada College (1968, Redwood City) and Skyline College (1969, San Bruno). Julio Bortolazzo is credited with the expansion of what had become the College of San Mateo into the three-college District. In 1956, he formed a 27-member Citizens Committee to study potential sites for a new campus for CSM. The final report filed by the Committee concluded that San Mateo County needed more than one community college.

County voters overwhelmingly approved a $5.9 million bond issue in 1957 based on Committee recommendations, which provided funds to purchase the present-day College Heights campus for CSM as well as the site for Skyline College. In 1962, the parcel for Cañada College was purchased. Voters approved another bond of $12.8 million in March 1964, which provided funds to construct Cañada College (opened 1968) and Skyline College (opened 1969).
===Facilities===
Upon opening, San Mateo Junior College initially shared facilities with San Mateo High School at what was known as the Baldwin campus, at Baldwin Avenue and San Mateo Drive (then called Griffith Avenue) near downtown San Mateo. One year after opening, San Mateo Junior College moved to the mansion built for Charles Polhemus and later purchased by William Kohl in what is now Central Park. At the Kohl mansion, classes were held in parlors and bedrooms, the veranda was enclosed to serve as the library, assemblies were held in the grand dining room, the women&#x27;s gymnasium and locker room was created from the kitchen, and a student store opened in the former wine cellar in 1926. The Junior College soon outgrew the Kohl mansion, and temporary buildings (including tents) were erected in Central Park to hold classes.

In 1927, the high school moved to its present location at Delaware and Poplar, and the Junior College moved back to the Baldwin campus. However, enrollments rose rapidly, and by 1935, the Baldwin campus was hosting 1,500 students in a building designed for 500. Later that year, SMJC purchased at North Delaware and Peninsula which had previously been occupied by Pacific Studios, a silent film production lot, for .

In 1939, science classes started at new buildings on the Delaware campus to relieve overcrowding at the main Baldwin campus. However, after the start of World War II, work on the new campus was suspended. After the war, the college added a third location by leasing the training facility originally constructed for the United States Merchant Marine during World War II at Coyote Point. The Merchant Marines had vacated the Coyote Point facility by January 1947 due to budget cutbacks, and SMJC started offering courses there in September. Different subjects were taught at each of the three sites: science, mathematics, and shop courses at Delaware; art and business at Baldwin; other subjects at Coyote Point. The haste with which Coyote Point had been pressed into service soon became evident; steam pipes for heating developed leaks and airplane traffic to nearby San Francisco International Airport repeatedly interrupted instruction in classrooms built with inadequate insulation.

A bond issue in 1957 overwhelmingly passed by County voters allowed the college to consolidate into a single site, at what is now known as the College Heights campus. The parcel was purchased at a bargain price of $7,280 per acre with the help of an eminent domain lawsuit. Ground was broken at College Heights on October 21, 1960, and the new campus opened on September 30, 1963, one year behind schedule. CSM sold off the Delaware campus on February 21, 1963, for $2.3 million, and the last day at Coyote Point was September 6, 1963. Although classes at started at College Heights, work continued; the new library opened on November 15, and the new campus was dedicated on December 8 of that year. The new campus at College Heights cost nearly $19.5 million; it was refurbished in the 2000s funded by bond measures, including seismic upgrades and a new College Center.

== Academics ==
=== Accreditation ===
College of San Mateo is accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges.

=== Transfer programs ===
CSM offers transfer admission guarantees with seven of the nine UC campuses, nearly all of the CSU campuses and many private colleges in California.

=== Career and technical programs ===
The college offers more than 75 programs in career areas including multimedia, green technologies, cosmetology, nursing, broadcasting, accounting, computer and information science, fire technology and dental assisting.

=== High school programs ===
San Mateo Middle College is an alternative high school program serving grades 11 and 12 which operates on the CSM campus. Middle College students take three high school classes on campus with high school teachers and fill the remainder of their schedule with college courses. Middle College students come from the San Mateo Union High School District; students in the Cabrillo Unified School District may also be eligible to participate with approval of the Middle College principal.

In Fall 2016, another alternative high school program, Jumpstart was put on the CSM campus, allowing high school students to finish their credits on an online program, and to give them an opportunity to take classes on campus. This allows for students to receive credit for both their high school and college graduation requirements.

== Athletics ==
CSM&#x27;s championship intercollegiate athletic teams compete at the highest community college level, offering student athletes an opportunity to participate in a team experience. The college offers the following men&#x27;s sports: football, baseball, track &amp; field, cross country and swimming; and the following women&#x27;s sports: softball, basketball, track &amp; field, cross country, sand volleyball, indoor volleyball, water polo and swimming.

Pitcher Scott Feldman walked on to the school&#x27;s baseball team his freshman year. In two seasons, he went 25–2, with a 1.30 ERA and a strikeout-to-walk ratio of 8-to-1. &quot;When Feldman pitched&quot;, said Bulldogs coach Doug Williams, &quot;the game was 95% over.&quot; He earned Coast Conference Pitcher of the Year honors both as a freshman in 2002 and as a sophomore in 2003, and was also an All-American both years. &quot;He has a gift&quot;, Williams said.

=== Athletics Hall of Fame ===
In 2011, CSM established an Athletics Hall of Fame. Among the notable inductees are John Madden, former professional football coach, analyst and broadcaster; Archie Williams, 1936 Olympic gold medalist; and Bill Ring, former professional football player. Names of all of the inductees are on display in CSM&#x27;s Hall of Fame Plaza.

<doc id="508758" wikidata="Q2640482" url="?curid=508758" title="Sgùrr nan Gillean">
<text>Sgùrr nan Gillean is a peak in the northern part of the Cuillin mountains on the Isle of Skye in Scotland. With a height of , it is one of eleven Munros in the Cuillins. It is the Munro peak nearest to the settlement of Sligachan, and its impressive triangular profile makes it one of the most recognizable of the Cuillins.

==Routes==
The most popular route of ascent, known as the &quot;Tourist Route&quot;, follows a path leading south and west from Sligachan, crossing a burn known as the Allt Dearg Beag (small red burn). The route continues up into a corrie, the Coire Rhiabhach. The ascent of the coire headwall is on loose rock and scree. The continuation up the southeast ridge to the summit is exposed, and calls for scrambling ability. The path up is very narrow so calls for single file when a party ascends. The top is a ridge which must be traversed to reach the final summit, and like the climb, needs some scrambling ability. All sides are very exposed, and extra care is needed if mist descends. The small airy summit platform is surprisingly smooth and flat with outstanding views.

An alternative route is the north ridge, known as &quot;Pinnacle Ridge&quot;, which is a rock climb that requires a climber to have a rope and harness and be capable of abseiling, unless the third pinnacle is omitted by bypassing on the east side. While rope is a sensible option for the moderate climb up Gillean, it is not required for Knight&#x27;s Peak if the correct route is taken. To reach the base of the Pinnacle Ridge a climber starts in the same place as for the route described above but instead of crossing the burn continues up hill on the right hand side until just below the start of the Basteir gorge when the stream exiting the gorge is crossed to reach the base of the lowest pinnacle.

Another alternative route of ascent or descent is the West Ridge. It leads from the summit down to a bealach separating Sgùrr nan Gillean from Am Basteir. About two-thirds of the way down, there is a particularly narrow and exposed section, which forms the remains of a large upright rock, known as the &quot;Gendarme&quot; which broke away due to the effects of frost shatter during the winter of 1986/87, leaving only the base. The narrow section can be avoided by abseiling down (or climbing up) a gully, known as &quot;Nicholson&#x27;s Chimney&quot;, on the north side of the ridge.

==Name and classification==
In November 2013 it was found that Knight&#x27;s Peak is too short to be classified as a Munro Top (a satellite peak of a Munro being over but without significant height drop between the two peaks) and is now considered a Corbett Top. Knight&#x27;s Peak was named after W. Knight, who, with a guide, made the first recorded ascent in 1873.

<text>HMCS &quot;Toronto&quot; (FFH 333) is a that has served in the Canadian Forces since 1993. &quot;Toronto&quot; is the fourth ship in her class which is the name for the Canadian Patrol Frigate Project. She is the second RCN ship to be named for Canada&#x27;s largest city. When not on operations, she is assigned to Maritime Forces Atlantic (MARLANT) and is based at CFB Halifax. &quot;Toronto&quot; serves on MARLANT missions protecting Canada&#x27;s sovereignty in the Atlantic Ocean and enforcing Canadian laws in its territorial sea and exclusive economic zone.

==Description and design==
The &quot;Halifax&quot;-class frigate design of which &quot;Toronto&quot; belongs, was ordered by the Canadian Forces in 1977 as a replacement for the aging , , , and es of destroyer escorts, which were all tasked with anti-submarine warfare. In July 1983, the federal government approved the budget for the design and construction of the first batch of six new frigates of which &quot;Toronto&quot; was a part, out of twelve that were eventually built. To reflect the changing long term strategy of the Navy during the 1980s and 1990s, the &quot;Halifax&quot;-class frigates was designed as a general purpose warship with particular focus on anti-submarine capabilities.

As built, the &quot;Halifax&quot;-class vessels displaced and were long overall and between perpendiculars with a beam of and a draught of . That made them slightly larger than the &quot;Iroquois&quot;-class destroyers. The vessels are propelled by two shafts with Escher Wyss controllable pitch propellers driven by a CODOG system of two General Electric LM2500 gas turbines, generating and one SEMT Pielstick 20 PA6 V 280 diesel engine, generating .

This gives the frigates a maximum speed of and a range of at while using their diesel engines. Using their gas turbines, the ships have a range of at . The &quot;Halifax&quot; class have a complement of 198 naval personnel of which 17 are officers and 17 aircrew of which 8 are officers.

===Armament and aircraft===
As built the &quot;Halifax&quot;-class vessels deployed the CH-124 Sea King helicopter, which acted in concert with shipboard sensors to seek out and destroy submarines at long distances from the ships. The ships have a helicopter deck fitted with a &quot;bear trap&quot; system allowing the launch and recovery of helicopters in up to sea state 6. The &quot;Halifax&quot; class also carries a close-in anti-submarine weapon in the form of the Mark 46 torpedo, launched from twin Mark 32 Mod 9 torpedo tubes in launcher compartments either side of the forward end of the helicopter hangar.

As built, the anti-shipping role is supported by the RGM-84 Harpoon Block 1C surface-to-surface missile, mounted in two quadruple launch tubes at the main deck level between the funnel and the helicopter hangar. For anti-aircraft self-defence the ships are armed with the Sea Sparrow vertical launch surface-to-air missile in two Mk 48 Mod 0 eight-cell launchers placed to port and starboard of the funnel. The vessels carry 16 missiles. A Raytheon/General Dynamics Phalanx Mark 15 Mod 21 Close-In Weapon System (CIWS) is mounted on top of the helicopter hangar for &quot;last-ditch&quot; defence against targets that evade the Sea Sparrow.

As built, the main gun on the forecastle is a /70 calibre Mark 2 gun from Bofors. The gun is capable of firing shells at a rate of 220 rounds per minute at a range of more than .

===Countermeasures and sensors===
As built, the decoy system comprises Two BAE Systems Shield Mark 2 decoy launchers which fire chaff to and infrared rockets to in distraction, confusion and centroid seduction modes. The torpedo decoy is the AN/SLQ-25A Nixie towed acoustic decoy from Argon ST. The ship&#x27;s radar warning receiver, the CANEWS (Canadian Electronic Warfare System), SLQ-501, and the radar jammer, SLQ-505, were developed by Thorn and Lockheed Martin Canada.

Two Thales Nederland (formerly Signaal) SPG-503 (STIR 1.8) fire control radars are installed one on the roof of the bridge and one on the raised radar platform immediately forward of the helicopter hangar. The ship is also fitted with Raytheon AN/SPS-49(V)5 long-range active air search radar operating at C and D bands, Ericsson HC150 Sea Giraffe medium-range air and surface search radar operating at G and H bands, and Kelvin Hughes Type 1007 I-band navigation radar. The sonar suite includes the CANTASS Canadian Towed Array and GD-C AN/SQS-510 hull mounted sonar and incorporates an acoustic range prediction system. The sonobuoy processing system is the GD-C AN/UYS-503.

===Modernization===
The &quot;Halifax&quot; class underwent a modernization program, known as the Halifax Class Modernization (HCM) program, in order to update the frigates&#x27; capabilities in combatting modern smaller, faster and more mobile threats. This involved upgrading the command and control, radar, communications, electronic warfare and armament systems. Further improvements, such as modifying the vessel to accommodate the new Sikorsky CH-148 Cyclone helicopter and satellite links will be done separately from the main Frigate Equipment Life Extension (FELEX) program.

The FELEX program comprised upgrading the combat systems integration to CMS330. The SPS-49 2D long-range air search radar was replaced by the Thales Nederland SMART-S Mk 2 E/F-band 3D surveillance radar, and the two STIR 1.8 fire-control radars were replaced by a pair of Saab Ceros 200 recontrol radars. A Telephonics IFF Mode 5/S interrogator was installed and the Elisra NS9003A-V2HC ESM system replaced the SLQ-501 CANEWS. An IBM multi-link (Link 11, Link 16 and Link 22 enabled) datalink processing system was installed along with two Raytheon Anschütz Pathfinder Mk II navigation radars. Furthermore, Rheinmetall&#x27;s Multi Ammunition Softkill System (MASS), known as MASS DUERAS, was introduced to replace the Plessey Shield decoy system. The existing 57 mm Mk 2 guns were upgraded to the Mk 3 standard, the Harpoon missiles were improved to Block II levels, the Phalanx was upgraded to Block 1B, and the obsolete Sea Sparrow system was replaced by the Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile.

==Service history==
&quot;Toronto&quot; was laid down on 22 April 1989 by Saint John Shipbuilding Ltd. at Saint John, New Brunswick, and launched on 18 December 1990. The frigate was commissioned into the Canadian Forces on 29 July 1993 at Toronto, Ontario, and carries the hull classification symbol FFH 333.

In 1994, &quot;Toronto&quot; deployed to the Adriatic Sea in support of the NATO blockade of Yugoslavia. In 1995, with and , &quot;Toronto&quot; sailed to Europe making a series of port visits in commemoration of the end of the Second World War in Europe. The same year, the ship took part in the NATO naval exercise Linked Seas off Portugal. In 1996, &quot;Toronto&quot; sailed through the St. Lawrence Seaway and the Great Lakes making several port visits.

In 1998, &quot;Toronto&quot; joined the NATO fleet STANAVFORLANT in January. On 10 February, the ship was redeployed to the Persian Gulf to assist in the enforcement of sanctions against Iraq. During the ship&#x27;s deployment, the frigate served with a United States Navy fleet. The ship returned to Canada on 16 June. On 5 December, &quot;Toronto&quot; sailed to the Middle East as part of Operation Apollo in the War in Afghanistan. The ship returned to Canada on 27 May 2002. From January to July 2004, &quot;Toronto&quot; took part in Operation Altair, operating with the Carrier Strike Group as part of a U.S.-led coalition in Operation Enduring Freedom. In summer 2005, &quot;Toronto&quot; performed another tour of the Great Lakes.

On 6 September 2005, &quot;Toronto&quot;, with , and the Canadian Coast Guard vessel , were dispatched to the Gulf of Mexico to aid the United States in their response to the flooding of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina. In 2008, &quot;Toronto&quot; with and the Canadian Coast Guard vessel made an Arctic patrol through Frobisher Bay as part of Operation Nanook. In 2009, &quot;Toronto&quot; deployed to the Caribbean Sea to perform drug-smuggling interdiction duties as part of Operation Caribbe. The ship returned to the Caribbean in 2011 as part of Operation Caribbe.

&quot;Toronto&quot; participated in Operation Artemis, commencing her first rotation (ROTO 2) in January 2013 and finishing in February 2014 (which included a crew swap in July 2013 [the first crew swap in RCN history since 1991]).

While relieving in the Mediterranean Sea as part of Standing NATO Maritime Group 2, &quot;Toronto&quot; was reassigned to the Black Sea for Operation Reassurance in response to Russian intervention in Central and Eastern Europe. &quot;Toronto&quot; led Task Unit 2 (TU.02) and worked in concert with Spanish Navy frigate , and operated with Romanian Navy frigate &quot;Regele Ferdinand&quot; and United States Navy destroyer as well as other vessels from Bulgaria, Georgia, Turkey, and Ukraine.

On 8 September 2014, &quot;Toronto&quot; was circled by two Russian Su-24 attack aircraft and a Russian surveillance plane in a provocative manner. In November 2014, six members of the crew helped fight a fire while on shore leave in Antalya, Turkey. While in the Mediterranean Sea, &quot;Toronto&quot; suffered a fire in its auxiliary machinery room on 25 December 2014. The fire was extinguished and all personnel affected by the smoke were treated and released. During the frigate&#x27;s deployment, &quot;Toronto&quot; participated in three naval exercises and led Task Unit 2 while operating in the Black Sea. relieved the ship in January 2015.

&quot;Toronto&quot; was the last ship of the class to complete her FELEX refit, which was performed at Irving Shipyards in Halifax. The vessel was returned to the Royal Canadian Navy on 29 November 2016 to begin sea trials. The vessel was not expected to be operational until 2017–18. In January 2018, &quot;Toronto&quot; trained with the new Resolve-class auxiliary vessel, off the coast of Nova Scotia.

In October, &quot;Toronto&quot; was deployed to European waters. During a series of exercises in UK waters, the frigate developed a significant electrical problem that caused a loss of power to the ship. Power was later restored and &quot;Toronto&quot; was ordered to Belfast for repairs. As the frigate was docking in Belfast, a small fire began in the starboard gas turbine enclosure in the forward engine room, which was quickly extinguished by the crew. This marked the second such fire in days aboard &quot;Halifax&quot;-class frigates, the first aboard . The ship returned to Canada. On 19 January 2019, &quot;Toronto&quot; departed Halifax for the Mediterranean Sea as part of Operation Reassurance. The frigate sailed into the Black Sea and visited Odesa, Ukraine.

&quot;Toronto&quot; returned to Halifax on 4 August 2019. On 22 August 2019, a fire broke out aboard &quot;Toronto&quot; while the ship was at dock in Halifax undergoing routine maintenance. The fire broke out at roughly 6:50 pm and was extinguished within 20 minutes. No one was injured.

<doc id="508769" wikidata="Q4800913" url="?curid=508769" title="Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland">
<text>Article 2 and Article 3 of the Constitution of Ireland () were adopted with the Constitution of Ireland as a whole on 29 December 1937, but revised completely by means of the Nineteenth Amendment which became effective 2 December 1999. As amended, they grant the right to be &quot;part of the Irish Nation&quot; to all those people born on the island of Ireland; the articles also express a desire for the peaceful political unification of the island subject to the consent of the people of Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland. Before 1999, Articles 2 and 3 made the claim that the whole island formed one &quot;national territory&quot;.

==Current version==
The Irish Government was bound by the terms of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement to submit Articles 2 and 3 to amendment by referendum. As a result, the Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution was adopted during June of the same year by 94% of those voting. The new wording describes the Irish nation as a community of individuals with a common identity rather than as a territory, and is intended to reassure unionists that a united Ireland will not happen without the consent of a majority of the Northern Ireland electorate.

===Full text ===

====Article 2====

====Article 3====

===Article 2===

As amended, Article 2 provides that everyone born on the island of Ireland has the right to be a part of the &#x27;Irish Nation&#x27;. The apparent intention is partly to allow the people of Northern Ireland, if they wish, to feel included in the &#x27;nation&#x27; without making what might be perceived as a revanchist claim. However, it has been argued that &quot;the new Article 2 of the Irish constitution gave northern nationalists nothing&quot;. After all, Article 9 of the Constitution of Ireland governs Irish citizenship. It provides that the &quot;future loss and acquisition of Irish nationality and citizenship shall be determined in accordance with law&quot;. Since it was further amended during 2004, Article 9 now also provides that &quot;[n]otwithstanding any other provision of this Constitution, a person born in the island of Ireland, which includes its islands and seas, who does not have, at the time of the birth of that person, at least one parent who is an Irish citizen or entitled to be an Irish citizen is not entitled to Irish citizenship or nationality, unless provided for by law&quot;.

The changes to Article 2 represent a strictly qualified provision of the Belfast Agreement recognizing:

The qualification to that provision of the Belfast Agreement is contained in Annex 2 to the Belfast Agreement. That Annex specifies that the above-mentioned reference to &quot;the people of Northern Ireland&quot; only means &quot;all persons born in Northern Ireland and having, at the time of their birth, at least one parent who is a British citizen, an Irish citizen or is otherwise entitled to reside in Northern Ireland without any restriction on their period of residence.&quot; Accordingly, the Belfast Agreement did not bind either state to provide for any unqualified entitlement to birthright citizenship.

Article 2 further recognises the &quot;special affinity&quot; between the people of Ireland and the Irish diaspora.

A criticism of the new wording was that the logic of the constitution was disrupted by the new Articles 2 and 3, in particular as Article 9 already dealt with citizenship, and that the references to &quot;Irish nation&quot; in the new Articles do not have any practical meaning.

===Article 3===
As amended, Article 3, Section 1 expresses the &quot;firm will&quot; of the Irish nation to create a united Irish people, though not, explicitly, a united country. It stresses, however, that a united Ireland should respect the distinct cultural identity of Unionists and that it should only happen with the separate &quot;democratically expressed&quot; consent of the peoples of both parts of the island. This provision was intended to diminish the concerns of Unionists, that their rights would be ignored in a united Ireland, should that happen. By the Good Friday Agreement the people of Northern Ireland&#x27;s &quot;democratically expressed&quot; consent must be secured by referendum. For a provision that states the &quot;Irish Nation&quot;&#x27;s desire for unity, it adds an additional legal requirement for a referendum to be held not only in Northern Ireland but also in the Republic of Ireland before a united Ireland could be brought about. This has the effect of creating an extra hurdle to Irish acceptance of a cession of Northern Ireland&#x27;s territory from the UK which would not apply to a cession of any other territory.

Section 2 allows Ireland to participate in the cross-border &#x27;implementation&#x27; bodies established by the Agreement.

====Article 2====

====Article 3====

Note that is the Irish-language translation of &quot;Irish Free State&quot;, the name of the independent Irish state before 1937.

Speaking at the 1916 Easter Rising commemoration at Arbour Hill in Dublin during 1998, Bertie Ahern said:

Speaking to the Northern Ireland Forum on 17 April 1998 Ulster Unionist Party politician David Trimble said:

==History==
The drafters of the Constitution of Ireland during 1937 considered the partition of Ireland by the Government of Ireland Act 1920, and Northern Ireland&#x27;s &quot;Opt Out&quot; of the Free State by the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty, to be illegitimate. They desired the new constitution to proclaim the existence of a single &#x27;Irish nation&#x27;, and the &quot;theoretical right&quot; of the state to encompass the whole island, while for reasons of pragmatism recognising the reality of partition, which resulted in delicate wording.

The Constitution refers to two separate entities: a &quot;nation&quot;, encompassing the whole island of Ireland, and a &quot;state&quot;, extending, for the time being, only to the twenty-six counties of the &#x27;South&#x27;. In its 1937 form, Article 2 described the island of Ireland as the &quot;national territory&quot;. Article 3, however, stated that the laws of the southern state would apply only to the South. The purpose of Article 3 was to clarify that Article 2 was intended largely as a kind of declaration, rather than as a provision that would have actual force of law.

===Controversy===
Until their amendment during 1999 Articles 2 and 3 were the subject of some controversy, particularly among Unionists in Northern Ireland. To Northern Ireland Unionists the articles were a hostile claim upon their territory, and a declaration that they might be coerced into a united Ireland without their consent, and in violation of the sovereignty of the United Kingdom. Furthermore, they claimed, the articles constituted an extraterritorial claim to a part of a foreign nation and were therefore in violation of international law.

For many decades the correct interpretation of the articles also caused some controversy among Irish nationalists. Some considered the constitution as placing an enforceable legal obligation on the government of the Republic to use its influence to actively seek the unification of the island. Invoking Article 2, some Northern Ireland nationalists elected to the UK parliament requested, but were denied, the right to be recognised in the southern parliament (the Oireachtas) as TDs (members of Dáil Éireann). Before 1999, however, the Irish Supreme Court affirmed in consistent rulings that Article 2 created no rights or obligations that were actually enforceable in a court of law.

After the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985, unionist politicians Christopher and Michael McGimpsey brought a suit against the Irish government in the High Court arguing that the Agreement was unconstitutional by Articles 2 and 3, because it recognised that Northern Ireland was part of the United Kingdom. This argument was unusual coming from unionists because of the traditional unionist opposition to these two articles, but was done to discredit an agreement they opposed, albeit not for the reasons they opposed it. Their case failed in the High Court, and again on appeal to the Supreme Court.

Of the two main Unionist parties in Northern Ireland, the amended versions of Articles 2 and 3 were accepted by the Ulster Unionist Party but rejected by the Democratic Unionist Party as not representing an improvement on their predecessors. The DUP has, in recent elections, become the largest political party in Northern Ireland.

===Adoption of new versions of the Articles===
At midnight on 1 December 1999, the direct rule of the UK parliament ended in Northern Ireland when power was formally devolved to the new Northern Ireland Assembly. On 2 December 1999, power was devolved to the North/South Ministerial Council and the British–Irish Council when commencement orders for the British–Irish Agreement came into effect. However, Article 4(2) of the British–Irish Agreement (the Agreement between the British and Irish governments for the implementation of the Belfast Agreement) required the two governments to notify each other in writing of the completion of the requirements for the entry into force of the Belfast Agreement. Entry into force was to be upon the receipt of the later of the two notifications. The British government agreed to participate with a televised ceremony at Iveagh House in Dublin, the Irish department of foreign affairs. Peter Mandelson, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, attended early on 2 December 1999. He exchanged notifications with David Andrews, the Irish foreign minister. Soon after the ceremony, at 10.30 am, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the declaration formally amending Articles 2 and 3 of the Irish Constitution. He then announced to the Dáil that the British–Irish Agreement had become effective (including certain supplementary agreements concerning the Belfast Agreement).

===Citizenship law===

By granting an unqualified right to citizenship to all of those born on the island of Ireland, the new articles have also caused further controversy in the Republic. In January 2003, the Supreme Court ruled that it was constitutional for the Government to deport the parents of children who were Irish citizens. In October 2004 the European Court of Justice ruled (in the &quot;Chen&quot; case) that a mother who is neither a UK nor an Irish citizen, whose child was born in Northern Ireland and had subsequently (as was the child&#x27;s entitlement) acquired Irish citizenship, had the right to live with her child in the UK, since denying this would in effect deny residence to the child, in violation of her rights as a citizen. The ECJ ruling acknowledged that, under certain circumstances, a person born in part of the UK (i.e. Northern Ireland) could not gain citizenship of that nation state, but could gain Irish citizenship, without having ever set foot in the Republic of Ireland, or having any connection with it.

The Twenty-seventh Amendment was approved by referendum on 11 June 2004, and was enacted on 24 June. It inserted a new section in Article 9 of the constitution stating that, &quot;notwithstanding any other provision of [the] Constitution&quot;, no-one would be automatically entitled to Irish citizenship unless they had at least one parent who was (or was entitled to be) an Irish citizen. The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2004 amended citizenship law to remove the entitlement to citizenship from those born on the island of Ireland who did not have an Irish-citizen parent, or whose parents had not lived in Ireland for three of the previous four years. This law was commenced on 1 January 2005.

<doc id="508777" wikidata="Q305364" url="?curid=508777" title="Thiophene">
<text>Thiophene is a heterocyclic compound with the formula C4H4S. Consisting of a planar five-membered ring, it is aromatic as indicated by its extensive substitution reactions. It is a colorless liquid with a benzene-like odor. In most of its reactions, it resembles benzene. Compounds analogous to thiophene include furan (C4H4O), selenophene (C4H4Se) and pyrrole (C4H4NH), which each vary by the heteroatom in the ring.

==Isolation and occurrence==
Thiophene was discovered by Viktor Meyer in 1882 as a contaminant in benzene. It was observed that isatin (an indole) forms a blue dye if it is mixed with sulfuric acid and crude benzene. The formation of the blue indophenin had long been believed to be a reaction of benzene itself. Viktor Meyer was able to isolate thiophene as the actual substance responsible for this reaction.

Thiophene and especially its derivatives occur in petroleum, sometimes in concentrations up to 1–3%. The thiophenic content of oil and coal is removed via the hydrodesulfurization (HDS) process. 

===On Mars===
Thiophene derivatives have been detected at nanomole levels in 3.5 billions year old Martian soil sediments (Murray Formation, Pahrump Hills) by the rover &quot;Curiosity&quot; at Gale crater (Mars) between 2012 and 2017.

==Synthesis and production==
Reflecting their high stabilities, thiophenes arise from many reactions involving sulfur sources and hydrocarbons, especially unsaturated ones. The first synthesis of thiophene by Meyer, reported the same year that he made his discovery, involves acetylene and elemental sulfur. Thiophenes are classically prepared by the reaction of 1,4-diketones, diesters, or dicarboxylates with sulfidizing reagents such as P4S10 such as in the Paal-Knorr thiophene synthesis. Specialized thiophenes can be synthesized similarly using Lawesson&#x27;s reagent as the sulfidizing agent, or via the Gewald reaction, which involves the condensation of two esters in the presence of elemental sulfur. Another method is the Volhard–Erdmann cyclization.

Thiophene is produced on a modest scale of around 2,000 metric tons per year worldwide. Production involves the vapor phase reaction of a sulfur source, typically carbon disulfide, and a C-4 source, typically butanol. These reagents are contacted with an oxide catalyst at 500–550 °C.

==Properties and structure==
At room temperature, thiophene is a colorless liquid with which thiophene shares some similarities. The high reactivity of thiophene toward sulfonation is the basis for the separation of thiophene from benzene, which are difficult to separate by distillation due to their similar boiling points (4 °C difference at ambient pressure). Like benzene, thiophene forms an azeotrope with ethanol.

The molecule is flat; the bond angle at the sulfur is around 93°, the C–C–S angle is around 109°, and the other two carbons have a bond angle around 114°. The C–C bonds to the carbons adjacent to the sulfur are about 1.34 Å, the C–S bond length is around 1.70 Å, and the other C–C bond is about 1.41 Å.

==Reactivity==
Thiophene is considered to be aromatic, although theoretical calculations suggest that the degree of aromaticity is less than that of benzene. The &quot;electron pairs&quot; on sulfur are significantly delocalized in the pi electron system. As a consequence of its aromaticity, thiophene does not exhibit the properties seen for conventional sulfides. For example, the sulfur atom resists alkylation and oxidation.

===Oxidation===
Oxidation can occur both at sulfur, giving a thiophene &quot;S&quot;-oxide, as well as at the 2,3-double bond, giving the thiophene 2,3-epoxide, followed by subsequent NIH shift rearrangement. Oxidation of thiophene by trifluoroperacetic acid also demonstrates both reaction pathways. The major pathway forms the &quot;S&quot;-oxide as an intermediate, which undergoes subsequent Diels-Alder-type dimerisation and further oxidation, forming a mixture of sulfoxide and sulfone products with a combined yield of 83% (based on NMR evidence):

In the minor reaction pathway, a Prilezhaev epoxidation results in the formation of thiophene-2,3-epoxide that rapidly rearranges to the isomer thiophene-2-one. Trapping experiments demonstrate that this pathway is not a side reaction from the &quot;S&quot;-oxide intermediate, while isotopic labeling with deuterium confirm that a 1,2-hydride shift occurs and thus that a cationic intermediate is involved. If the reaction mixture is not anhydrous, this minor reaction pathway is suppressed as water acts as a competing base.

Oxidation of thiophenes may be relevant to the metabolic activation of various thiophene-containing drugs, such as tienilic acid and the investigational anticancer drug OSI-930.

===Alkylation===
Although the sulfur atom is relatively unreactive, the flanking carbon centers, the 2- and 5-positions, are highly susceptible to attack by electrophiles. Halogens give initially 2-halo derivatives followed by 2,5-dihalothiophenes; perhalogenation is easily accomplished to give C4X4S (X = Cl, Br, I). Thiophene brominates 107 times faster than does benzene. Acetylation occurs readily to give 2-acetylthiophene, precursor to thiophene-2-carboxylic acid and thiophene-2-acetic acid.

Chloromethylation and chloroethylation occur readily at the 2,5-positions. Reduction of the chloromethyl product gives 2-methylthiophene. Hydrolysis followed by dehydration of the chloroethyl species gives 2-vinylthiophene.

===Desulfurization===
Desulfurization of thiophene with Raney nickel affords butane. When coupled with the easy 2,5-difunctionalization of thiophene, desulfurization provides a route to 1,4-disubstituted butanes.

===Polymerization===
The polymer formed by linking thiophene through its 2,5 positions is called polythiophene. Polymerization is conducted by oxidation using electrochemical methods (electropolymerization) or electron-transfer reagents. An idealized equation is shown:
:n C4H4S → (C4H2S)n + 2n H+ + 2n e−

Polythiophene itself has poor processing properties and so is little studied. More useful are polymers derived from thiophenes substituted at the 3- and 3- and 4- positions, such as EDOT (ethylenedioxythiophene). Polythiophenes become electrically conductive upon partial oxidation, i.e. they obtain some of the characteristics typically observed in metals.

===Coordination chemistry===
Thiophene exhibits little sulfide-like character, but it does serve as a pi-ligand forming piano stool complexes such as Cr(&quot;η&quot;5-C4H4S)(CO)3.

==Thiophene derivatives==
===Thienyl===
Upon deprotonation, thiophene converts to the thienyl group, C4H3S−. Although the anion per se does not exist, the organolithium derivatives do. Thus reaction of thiophene with butyl lithium gives 2-lithiothiophene, also called 2-thienyllithium. This reagent reacts with electrophiles to give thienyl derivatives, such as the thiol. Oxidation of thienyllithium gives 2,2&#x27;-dithienyl, (C4H3S)2. Thienyl lithium is employed in the preparation of higher order mixed cuprates. Coupling of thienyl anion equivalents gives dithienyl, an analogue of biphenyl.

===Ring-fused thiophenes===
Fusion of thiophene with a benzene ring gives benzothiophene. Fusion with two benzene rings gives either dibenzothiophene (DBT) or naphthothiophene. Fusion of a pair of thiophene rings gives isomers of thienothiophene.

==Uses==
Thiophenes are important heterocyclic compounds that are widely used as building blocks in many agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals. The benzene ring of a biologically active compound may often be replaced by a thiophene without loss of activity. This is seen in examples such as the NSAID lornoxicam, the thiophene analog of piroxicam, and sufentanil, the thiophene analog of fentanyl.

<text>Port Harcourt (Pidgin: &quot;Po-ta-kot or Pi-ta-kwa)&quot; is the capital and largest city of Rivers State in Nigeria. It is the fifth most populous city in Nigeria after Lagos, Kano, Ibadan and Benin. It lies along the Bonny River and is located in the oil rich Niger Delta region. As of 2023, Port Harcourt&#x27;s urban population is approximately 3,480,000. The population of the metropolitan area of Port Harcourt is almost twice its urban area population with a 2015 United Nations estimate of 2,344,000. In 1950, the population of Port Harcourt was 59,752. Port Harcourt has grown by 150,844 since 2015, which represents a 4.99% annual change.

The colonial administration of Nigeria created the port to export coal from the collieries of Enugu located north of Port Harcourt, to which it was linked by a railway called the Eastern Line, also built by the British.

Port Harcourt&#x27;s economy turned to petroleum when the first shipment of Nigerian crude oil was exported through the city in 1958. Through the benefits of the Nigerian petroleum industry, Port Harcourt was further developed, with aspects of modernization such as overpasses, city blocks, and taller and more substantial buildings. Oil firms that currently have offices in the city include Shell and Chevron.

With Agip company. There are several public and private tertiary institutions in Port Harcourt. These institutions include Rivers State University, University of Port Harcourt, Captain Elechi Amadi Polytechnic, Ignatius Ajuru University, Rivers State College of Health Science and Technology, Madonna University, PAMO University of Medical Sciences, National Open University of Nigeria. The current mayor is Ezebunwo Ichemati. Port Harcourt&#x27;s primary airport is Port Harcourt International Airport,(Omagwa) located on the outskirts of the city; the NAF base is the location of the only other airport and is used by commercial airlines Aero Contractors and Air Nigeria for domestic flights.

==Etymology==
The port was built in 1912, but not given a name until August 1913, when the then Governor of Nigeria, Sir Frederick Lugard, named it &quot;Port Harcourt&quot; in honor of Lewis Harcourt, 1st Viscount Harcourt, then the Secretary of State for the Colonies. The Okrika word for the city is &quot;Hakoti Kiri&quot; or &quot;Parakot&quot;. The native Obulom name for the city is , .

==History==
Port Harcourt was founded in 1912 by Frederick Lugard, governor of both the Northern Nigeria Protectorate and the Southern Nigeria Protectorate. Its purpose was to export the coal that geologist Albert Ernest Kitson had discovered in Enugu in 1909. The colonial government caused the people of Diobu to cede their land, and in 1912 the building of a port-town was started. Other villages that were later absorbed into the city included Oroworukwo, Oromeruezimgbu, Nkpogu, and Rumuomasi; In the creeks to the south of the original port were the fishing camps and grounds of the Wakirike-Ijaw group.

During the First World War, Port Harcourt was used as a point for military operations against the Central Powers in German Kamerun. After the discovery of crude oil in Oloibiri in 1956, Port Harcourt exported the first shipload from Nigeria in 1958. Port Harcourt became the center of the Nigerian oil economy and it subsequently reaped benefits of its associations with the petroleum industry by undergoing modernization and urbanization. Port Harcourt&#x27;s growth is further due to its position as the commercial center and foremost industrial city of the former Eastern Region; its position in the Niger Delta; and its importance as the center of social and economic life in Rivers State. After the Republic of Biafra seceded from Nigeria in 1967 Port Harcourt fell to Nigerian forces on 19 May 1968. From an area of in 1914, Port Harcourt grew uncontrolled to an area of in the 1980s.

==Geography==

The main city of Port Harcourt is the Port Harcourt City in the Port Harcourt local government area, consisting of the former European quarters now called Old GRA and New Layout areas. The urban area (Port Harcourt metropolis), on the other hand, is made up of the local government area itself and parts of Obio-Akpor and Eleme accordingly. Port Harcourt, which is the current capital of Rivers State, is highly congested as it is the only major city of the state. In 2009, a law was passed by the Rivers State House of Assembly and Governor Amaechi&#x27;s administration to spread development to the surrounding communities as part of the effort to decongest the Port Harcourt metropolis. The Greater Port Harcourt region, spans eight local government areas that include Port Harcourt, Okrika, Obio-Akpor, Ikwerre, Oyigbo, Ogu–Bolo, Etche and Eleme. Its total population was estimated at 2,000,000 as of 2009, making it one of the largest metropolitan areas in Nigeria. But that number has greatly increased according to recent studies.

===Location===
===Climate===
Port Harcourt features a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen: &quot;Am&quot;) with lengthy and heavy rainy seasons and very short dry seasons. Only the months of December to February truly qualify as dry season months in the city. The harmattan, which climatically influences many cities in West Africa, is less pronounced in Port Harcourt. Port Harcourt&#x27;s heaviest precipitation occurs during September with an average of of rain. December on average is the driest month of the year, with an average rainfall of . Temperatures throughout the year in the city are relatively constant, showing little variation throughout the course of the year. Average temperatures are typically between in the city.

The yearly temperature in Port Harcourt is 26.55 °C (79.79 °F) and it is -2.91% lower than Nigeria&#x27;s averages. Rivers typically receive about 330.36 millimeters (13.01 inches) of precipitation and has 304.91 rainy days (83.54% of the time) annually.

==Environmental concerns==

===Air Pollution===

Residents of the city have been experiencing particle (soot) pollution since the last quarter of 2016. Residents state their clothes and everything outside is covered with a layer of black soot. Official PM2.5 information from the state&#x27;s environmental commissioner, Roseline Konya, states a high reading of 270 micrograms per cubic meter for air pollution in the city from a 2016 sampling. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s (EPA) index air quality index (AQI), a reading of 0 – 50 is good, readings between 200 – 300 which Port Harcourt falls under is considered unhealthy for everyone and E.P.A advises residents of such areas to avoid heavy and prolonged exertion, and move activities indoors. &quot;For a 15-month period ending in June [2018] ... air quality was in the unhealthy range on 240 days, with 85 days ranking very unhealthy, and 13 days as hazardous.&quot;

The increased deterioration of ambient air quality led to a state protest in February 2017. There were experiences of black soot settling in nostrils, on cars, floors, roofs, windows, bathtubs, bathrooms, kitchen sinks and household furniture surfaces resulting in frequent cleaning of affected surfaces and places. potable, domestic and rainwater were equally affected. Abuloma, Iwofe, Rupokwu, Okrika, and Woji were mostly affected with other areas such as Rumuigbo, Eleme, and Oyigbo Local Government Councils, as well as Ogoni.

The covering of the haze of soot in most parts of the city has resulted in visibility impairment by PM2.5, soil, and water deposition, and disruption in ecosystem diversity. This also made the city dwellers spend more time indoors than outdoors. Residents in cities such as Rumosi and Rumuodumanya in Obio/Akpor Council have relocated to other safe cities leading to a decline in business activities.

The Ministry of Environment took action by analysing air samples from various sites in the city and found out to be 11 times higher than WHO specifications for PM2.5 and PM10. This non-compliance was tackled by shutting down the Chinese Government Company (CGC), H&amp;H Engineering Company, and AUC Asphalt Company located in the Aluu community, found to be the location of high volume discharge of emissions thereby contravening environmental regulations. Illegal refineries, burning of tires, gas flaring, liquefied natural gas (LNG) operations and processes, petro-chemical companies and refineries were other suspected sources of soot pollution.

<text>Kano (Ajami: كَنُواْ) is a city in northern Nigeria and the capital of Kano State. It is the second largest city in Nigeria after Lagos, with over four million citizens living within . Located in the savanna, south of the Sahel, Kano is a major route of the trans-Saharan trade, having been a trade and human settlement for millennia. It is the traditional state of the Dabo dynasty who have ruled as emirs over the city-state since the 19th century. Kano Emirate Council is the current traditional institution inside the city boundaries of Kano, and under the authority of the Government of Kano State.

The city is one of the seven medieval Hausa kingdoms. The principal inhabitants of the city are the Hausa and Fulani people. Centuries before British colonization, Kano was strongly cosmopolitan with settled populations of Arab, Tuareg, Kanuri and remains so with the Hausa language spoken as a lingua-franca by over 70 million speakers in the region.

Islam arrived in the city in the 11th century or earlier primarily through the trans-Saharan trade. As a result, Kano became wealthy and the commercial nerve centre of the region and Northern Nigeria, and is still associated as the &quot;centre of commerce&quot;.

== Etymology ==
Kano was originally known as Dala, after the hill, and was referred to as such until the end of the 15th century and the beginning of the 16th by Bornoan sources.

== History ==
=== Founding and Bagauda dynasty ===
In the 7th century, Dala Hill, a residual hill in Kano, was the site of a hunting and gathering community that engaged in iron work (Nok culture); it is unknown whether these were Hausa people or speakers of Niger–Congo languages. The Kano Chronicle identifies Barbushe, a warrior priest of Dala Hill and a female spirit deity known as Tsumburbura. Barbushe was from the lineage of the hunter family (&quot;maparauta&quot;) who were the Maguzawa and the city&#x27;s first settlers. They worshipped the deity Tsumburbura (Elizabeth Isichei notes that the description of Barbushe is similar to those of Sao people). While small chiefdoms were previously present in the area, according to the Kano Chronicle, Bagauda son of Bawo and grandson of the mythical hero Bayajidda, became the first king of Kano in 999, reigning until 1063. His grandson Gijimasu (1095–1134), the third king, began building city walls (badala/ganuwa) at the foot of Dala Hill. His own son, Tsaraki (1136–1194), the fifth king, completed them during his reign.

=== Middle Ages: spread of Islam and trade ===
In the 12th century, Ali Yaji from Kudawa lineage as King of Kano renounced his allegiance to the cult of Tsumburbura, converted to Islam and proclaimed the Sultanate that was to last until its fall in the 19th century. The reign of Yaji ensued an era of expansionism that saw Kano becoming the capital of a pseudo Habe Empire.

In 1463, Muhammad Rumfa (reigned 1463–1499) ascended the throne. During his reign, political pressure from the rising Songhai Empire forced him to take Auwa, the daughter of Askiyah the Great as his wife. She was to later become the first female Madaki of Kano.

Rumfa was a rich and flamboyant king. Luxurious clothing and expensive ostrich feather shoes were common among government officials. The kakaki (a kind of trumpet) was also first used during his reign. His wealth is owed to Kano&#x27;s commercial prosperity during this period. Kano arguably achieved the height of its reputation as an important trading center of the trans-Saharan trade in the Middle Ages during his reign. Leo Africanus&#x27;s description of Kano is believed to be that of Rumfa&#x27;s era. He described the locals as &quot;wealthy merchants and skilled craftsmen&quot; and commended the cavalry of the Sultan&#x27;s army. He also noted the abundance of rice, corn, cotton and citrus fruits.

Rumfa reformed the city, expanded the Sahelian Gidan Rumfa (Emir&#x27;s Palace), and played a role in the further Islamization of the city, as he urged prominent residents to convert and invited many prominent scholars to the city. He also built the walls of the city and the Kurmi market. The Kano Chronicle attributes a total of twelve &quot;innovations&quot; to Rumfa. According to the Kano Chronicle, the thirty-seventh Sarkin Kano (King of Kano) was Mohammed Sharef (1703–1731). His successor, Kumbari dan Sharefa (1731–1743), engaged in major battles with Sokoto as a longterm rivalry.

=== Fulani rule ===

At the beginning of the 19th century, Fulani Islamic leader Usman dan Fodio led a jihad affecting much of central Sudan which demolished the Habe kingdom, leading to the emergence of the Sokoto Caliphate. In 1805 the last sultan of Kano was defeated by the Jobe Clan of the Fulani, and Kano became an Emirate of the Caliphate. Kano was already the largest and most prosperous province of the empire.

The city suffered famines from 1807 to 1810, in the 1830s, 1847, 1855, 1863, 1873, 1884, and from 1889 until 1890.

During the 19th century when Kano came under the suzerainty of the Sokoto Caliphate, Kano prospered as the center of commercial activity. Weaving, dyeing and leatherwork were traded as far north as Morocco and thereafter to Europe. Its cotton cloth traded as far as Tripoli, Lake Chad, and Timbuktu.

In 1851, Heinrich Barth (a German scholar who spent several years in northern Nigeria in the 1850s) mentioned that Kano had a 10-mile long 30 ft high clay walls with a population of 30,000 with commerce and manufacturing abundant. He mentioned that &quot;its huge market was a labyrinth of narrow alleys with everything sold from vegetables to slaves&quot;. He also called Kano the greatest emporium of central Africa and estimated the percentage of slaves in Kano to be at least 50%, most of whom lived in slave villages. This was one of the last major slave societies, with high percentages of enslaved population long after the Atlantic slave trade had been cut off.

From 1893 until 1895, two rival claimants to the throne fought a civil war, or &quot;Basasa&quot;. With the help of royal slaves, Yusufu was victorious over his brother Tukur and claimed the title of emir.

=== British colony, indirect rule, and independence ===

In March 1903, the city-state was absorbed into the British Empire after the Battle of Kano, the Fort of Kano was captured by the British, It quickly replaced Lokoja as the administrative centre of Northern Nigeria. It was replaced as the centre of government by Zungeru and later Kaduna, and only regained administrative significance with the creation of Kano State following Nigerian independence.

From 1913 to 1914, as the peanut business was expanding, Kano suffered a major drought, which caused a famine. Other famines during British rule occurred in 1908, 1920, 1927, 1943, 1951, 1956, and 1958. By 1922, groundnut trader Alhassan Dantata had become the richest businessman in the Kano Emirate, surpassing fellow merchants Umaru Sharubutu Koki and Maikano Agogo.

In May 1953, an inter-ethnic riot arose due to southern newspapers misreporting on the nature of a disagreement between northern and southern politicians in the House of Representatives. Thousands of Nigerians of southern origin died as a result a politically sparked riot.Ado Bayero became emir of Kano in 1963. Kano state was created in 1967 from the then Northern Nigeria by the Federal military government. The first military police commissioner, Audu Bako, is credited with building a solid foundation for the progress of a modern society. He started a lot of development projects—network of roads, a reliable urban water supply. He was a keen farmer himself and funded construction of number of dams to provide irrigation. Thanks to his policies, Kano produced all types of produce and export it to the neighbouring states. The first civilian governor was Abubakar Rimi.

In December 1980, radical preacher Mohammed Marwa Maitatsine led a riot. He was killed by security forces, but his followers later started uprisings in other northern cities.

==== 21st century ====
After the introduction of sharia law in Kano State in the early 2000s, many Christians left the city. 100 people were killed in riots over the sharia issue during October 2001.

In November 2007, political violence broke out in the city after the People&#x27;s Democratic Party (PDP) accused the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) of rigging the November 17 local government elections. (The ANPP won in 36 of the state&#x27;s 44 local Government Areas.) Hundreds of youths took to the streets, over 300 of whom were arrested; at least 25 people were killed. Buildings set on fire include a sharia police station, an Islamic centre, and a council secretariat. 280 federal soldiers were deployed around the city.In January 2012, a series of bomb attacks killed up to 162 people. Four police stations, the State Security Service headquarters, passport offices and immigration centres were attacked. Jihadist insurgents Boko Haram claimed responsibility. After the bombings, Kano was placed under curfew. The Boko Haram insurgency continued with mass murders in March 2013, November 2014 and February 2015.

On 6 June 2014, Emir Ado Bayero who reigned as Emir of Kano for over five decades died, and a succession crisis loomed amongst the royal family. On 8 June 2014, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi a grandson of former Emir Muhammadu Sanusi I emerged as the new Emir of Kano. His accession led to widespread protests from supporters of Sanusi Ado Bayero the Chiroman Kano (Crown Prince) and son of the late Emir Ado Bayero, with allegations that Governor Rabiu Kwankwaso interfered with the king-making process.

In 2019, Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje balkanized the traditional Kano Emirate into four new emirates; Bichi, Rano, Gaya and Karaye. This unprecedented move was criticized by elders. According to the law, out of the 44 local government areas in the state, Sanusi as Emir of Kano will preside over just 10 local government areas; with the remainder carved up amongst the new emirates. On 9 March 2020, Sanusi was dethroned by Governor Abdullahi Ganduje. The emir was immediately moved to detention under heavy security escort to an apartment in awe, Nasarawa state. It took the intervention of the federal high court in Abuja to order his release from detention in Nasarawa.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
The city lies south of the Sahara Desert in the Sudanian Savanna region that stretches across the south of the Sahel. The city lies near where the Kano and Challawa rivers flowing from the southwest converge to form the Hadejia River, which eventually flows into Lake Chad to the east.

=== Climate ===
Kano is above sea level. Kano has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen &quot;Aw&quot;). The city has on average about of precipitation per year, the large majority of which falls from June through September. Like the vast majority of Nigeria, Kano is very hot for most of the year, peaking in April. From December through February, the city is less hot, with morning temperatures during the months of December, January and February averaging between .

=== LGAs ===
Metropolitan Kano has eight local governments:

== Economy ==
The economic history of Kano dates back to the Middle Ages when the city served as the southernmost point of the famous trans-Sahara trade routes. Kano was well connected with many cities in North Africa and some cities in southern Europe. By 1851, the city of Kano produced 10 million pairs of sandals and 5 million tanned hides annually for export, with other products including textile materials, leather and grains. Kano was connected with trans-Atlantic trade in 1911 when a railway line reached Kano. Kano is a major centre for the production and export of agricultural products like hides, skins, peanuts, and cotton.

The city maintains its economy and business even in the 21st century, with it producing the richest man in Africa—Aliko Dangote—whose great-grandfather Alhassan Dantata was the richest West African in the mid 20th century. Over the years, inconsistent government policies and sporadic electricity supply hampered manufacturing and industry, so that Kano&#x27;s economy relies primarily on trade, retail and services. There are plans to establish an information technology park in the city.

== Culture ==

=== Equestrianism ===

Kano is traditionally an equestrian society and this is manifested during the annual Durbar festival to mark and celebrate the two annual Muslim festivals Eid al-Fitr (to mark the end of the Holy Month of Ramadan) and Eid al-Adha (to mark the Hajj Holy Pilgrimage). Kano Durbar Festival is the Nigeria&#x27;s Most Spectacular Horseparade that marks a celebration of northern Nigeria&#x27;s cultural treasure. The festival begins with skilled horsemen from the royal court and aristocrats being accompanied by musicians, artillerymen, and traditional circus in a procession of highly rich and colorful style through the city on the way to the emir&#x27;s palace. Once assembled near the palace, the horsemen separate into their respective groups, each under the banner of district head (hakimai) or a titled nobleman from the emir&#x27;s court (masarauta), take it in turns to charge toward the emir, pulling up just feet in front of the seated dignitaries to offer their respect and allegiance. During the festival, the emir makes a beautiful appearance in different colors dressed and adorned with the attire of a king.

For the first time in 200 years, the durban horse festival was cancelled in 2012 due to the bad health condition of the Emir of Kano. Some analysts suggested that the cancellation could also be attributed to the rising deadly Boko haram attacks in the northern part of Nigeria at that time.

=== Architecture ===
Kano&#x27;s architecture over the years has seen wide variations, especially from the traditional architecture to modern architecture. The city is a leading axis of Sudano-Sahelian architecture, developing the local Tubali style which manifested in mosques, walls, common compounds, and gates.

The design exteriorization of building façades was and is still widely used in Kano architecture, with the city harboring several skilled artisans.

== Landmarks ==
=== Old City ===
Formerly walled, most of the gates to the Old City survive. The Old City houses the vast Kurmi Market, known for its crafts, while old dye pits—still in use—lie nearby. In the Old City are the Emir&#x27;s Palace, the Great Mosque, and the Gidan Makama Museum.

=== Places of worship ===
Among the places of worship, they are predominantly Muslims mosques.

There are also Christian churches for several denominations including :

* Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion);
* Roman Catholic Diocese of Kano (Catholic Church);
* Nigerian Baptist Convention (Baptist World Alliance);
* Presbyterian Church of Nigeria (World Communion of Reformed Churches);
* Pentecostal megachurches including; Assemblies of God, Living Faith Church Worldwide; Redeemed Christian Church of God

=== Fortifications ===
The Ancient Kano City Walls were built as a defensive wall with the construction of the foundation laid by Sarki Gijimasu (r. 1095–1134), the third king of the Kingdom of Kano in the Kano Chronicle. In the mid 14th century during the reign of Zamnagawa, the wall was completed before it was further expanded during the 16th century. According to historians, the then General-Governor of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria, Fredrick Lugard, wrote in a 1903 report about the Kano Walls that he had &quot;never seen anything like it in Africa&quot; after capturing the ancient city of Kano along with British forces.

=== Old palaces and residences ===
Many old royal residences have also survived to this day, mainly within the old city and its surroundings. Such private houses include the Gidan Chiroma, Filin Chiranchi, and others. Larger palaces, include the Gidan Rumfa, Gidan Makama, and winter retreat for the emir.

It became a federal university in 1977, and remains an important institution of learning today.

== Transport ==
Kano houses a railway station with trains to Lagos routed through Kaduna, while Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport lies nearby. The city is supplied with water by the nearby Challawa Gorge Dam, which is being considered as a source of hydro power. Because Kano is north of the rail junction at Kaduna, it has equal access to the seaports at Lagos and Port Harcourt.

The airline Kabo Air had its head office in the city. Kano was also headquarters of Azman Airlines and is the headquarters city of Max Air and various independent travel agencies.
After a hiatus of many years, the railway line from Kano to Lagos was rehabilitated by 2013. The train trip to Lagos takes 30 hours and costs the equivalent of US$12, only a quarter of the equivalent bus fare.

In 2014, a new double track, standard gauge line is under construction from Lagos.

In 2017, a 74-km, four-line light rail network was announced by the Kano State Ministry of Works, Housing &amp; Transport; with a US$1.8 billion contract signed with China Railway Construction Corporation.

Two trans-African automobile routes pass through Kano:
* Algiers-Lagos Highway

* Dakar-Ndjamena Highway

From 2006 to 2015, backed by high oil prices, major highways, overhead bridges and other transportation infrastructure were built by the state government. The most notable of these are the Silver Jubilee flyover bridge at Kofar Nassarawa, the Kofar Kabuga underpass and various 6-lane highways in the city. In 2020, the Vice president of Nigeria Yemi Osibanjo was in Kano to commission the Alhassan Dantata flyover along Murtala Muhammad Way and Tijjani Hashim underpass way, Kofar Ruwa.

<text>Baird&#x27;s sparrow (Centronyx bairdii) is a species of North American birds in the family Passerellidae of order Passeriformes. It is a migratory bird native to the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

==Taxonomy==
The Baird&#x27;s sparrow was first described in North Dakota in 1843 by John James Audubon, and another record of this species was not made for 29 years following its discovery. It was named after the American naturalist Spencer Fullerton Baird.

==Description==
The Baird&#x27;s sparrow can be identified as a small brown streaked sparrow. Their faces are a yellow-brown color featuring subtle black markings. These birds have a narrow band of brown streaks on their chests. This species can be distinguished from others by its unique broad ochre central crown stripe. Juveniles exhibit similar coloration but often have more streaking. Adult size is comparable for both males and females, no sexual dimorphism is exhibited. Adults are generally about 12 cm (5&quot;) and weigh 17–21 g (½ to ¾ oz); their wingspan is usually around 23 cm (9&quot;).

They are larger than LeConte&#x27;s sparrow and do not exhibit orange coloration on their faces. They exhibit very similar coloration and patterning to Henslow&#x27;s sparrow but do not have green coloration on their faces. The Savannah sparrow is more heavily streaked and has an extra white marking on its head.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Baird&#x27;s sparrow migrates from its summer breeding habitat, the tall grass prairies of north central United States and South Central Canada, to spend winters in northern Mexico and the southern tip of the United States near Texas. Due to this migratory behavior, they may be spotted all across the Midwest portion of the United States during migratory seasons, but most frequently can be found in North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Montana, and Canada during the summer.

This species of sparrow resides in grassland habitats. These birds rely on the (now diminishing) tallgrass prairies, mixed grass prairies, and moister fescue prairies of northern United States and southern Canada. The dwindling status of this habitat puts many animals whose lifestyles rely on these ecosystems in peril. Land featuring woody vegetation and cultivated land is generally not a suitable environment for Baird&#x27;s sparrows to thrive in.

==Diet==

Baird&#x27;s sparrow feed on the ground, picking up insects and grass seeds.

==Conservation status and threats==

There is some concern about the conservation status of Baird&#x27;s sparrows; their numbers are reduced compared to historic numbers. This species is listed under the IUCN Red List under the category of &quot;least concern&quot;. Maintaining the original habitat is important for this species because artificial habitat recreation is not suitable for these birds. Fragmentation can lead to adverse conditions for Baird&#x27;s sparrows, including increased nest parasitism.

==Reproduction/life cycle==

Baird&#x27;s sparrows nest on the ground in either depressions or tufts of grass. These nests are usually made out of grass and consist of two layers, with finer material on the inside. These birds nest in small loose colonies. A normal clutch size is usually two to six white-gray eggs with brown spots. These birds are altricial, and rely on parental care for survival after hatching.

Breeding populations of Baird&#x27;s sparrow fluctuate from year to year. This is most likely the result of a variable environment including factors like wildfires, drought, and the movement of American bison herds. When confronted with danger or a potential predator, Baird&#x27;s sparrows may evade their foes by running on foot rather than flying away.

<text>Dónde Están los Ladrones? (, ) is the fourth studio album by Colombian singer-songwriter Shakira, released on 29 September 1998 by Sony Music Colombia. After attaining success in Latin America with her major-label debut, &quot;Pies Descalzos&quot; (1995), Shakira met producer Emilio Estefan, who identified her potential to break into the US Latin market and became her manager. As co-producer, Shakira enlisted previous collaborator Luis Fernando Ochoa along with Pablo Flores, Javier Garza, Lester Mendez, and Estefan, who served as executive producers. &quot;Dónde Están los Ladrones?&quot; incorporates Latin pop styles, with influences of rock en español and Middle Eastern music.

Upon its release, &quot;Dónde Están los Ladrones?&quot; received positive reviews from music critics, who praised its sound and lyrics, with one reviewer comparing Shakira to Alanis Morissette. Commercially, the album was a success, selling over one million copies within its first month of release. Additionally, the album peaked at number 131 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and topped the Top Latin and Latin Pop Albums charts. The album received numerous record certifications in various countries, including a platinum certification in the United States and a triple-platinum certification in Shakira&#x27;s native Colombia. &quot;Dónde Están los Ladrones?&quot; won several accolades, and was nominated for Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Performance at the 41st Grammy Awards. In 2020, it was ranked number 496 on Rolling Stone&#x27;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

Six singles were released from &quot;Dónde Están los Ladrones?&quot;. Its lead single, &quot;Ciega, Sordomuda&quot;, reached the top of both &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot Latin and Latin Pop Songs component charts, and also reached number one on charts of countries in Central America and Venezuela. Follow-up singles &quot;Tú&quot;, &quot;Inevitable&quot;, &quot;No Creo&quot;, &quot;Ojos Así&quot; and &quot;Moscas en la Casa&quot; peaked within the top thirty and top ten of the charts, respectively. The album was promoted through several televised performances, including her debut on American television through &quot;The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot;. In order to continue promoting it, along with her next release, &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;, Shakira embarked on the Tour Anfibio, which visited North and South America throughout 2000.

==Background and development==

After she rose to prominence with the success of her major-label debut &quot;Pies Descalzos&quot; (1995), Shakira was introduced to Emilio Estefan, the most important producer in the Hispanic market at the time, by her promoter and longtime friend, Jairo Martínez. Estefan was renowned for launching the careers of several Hispanic singers, including Enrique Iglesias, Thalía, and his wife Gloria Estefan. He decided to work with Shakira as he identified her potential to break into the US Latin market. One of Shakira&#x27;s concerns about working with Estefan was creative control over her music. Before signing their contract, the roles and duties were defined: Estefan would be her manager and executive producer, but she would be in charge of all material and arrangements and have final approval over her records. She later stated about Estefan, &quot;He had a great respect for me as an artist and trusted me totally on this project&quot;. Since then, they started working at Estefan&#x27;s Crescent Moon Studios in Miami.

Shakira was mindful of the many who would judge her fourth album, because of the &quot;phenomenon&quot; label recently applied to her. She knew that some would say that &quot;she had changed too much&quot; and others would reproach her if she remained the same. &quot;All I could do was to be myself. I understood that all I had to do was write the music I knew how to write and to write from the heart when I was compelled to. In that way, everything developed naturally, more so than I could have imagined&quot;, she said. In addition, Shakira insisted on perfection, working on the material to the point of exhaustion. &quot;I made two or three demos of each song. I became a human being so demanding of myself that until the song made my hair stand on end, I wouldn&#x27;t stop&quot;. Equipment for the recording of &quot;Dónde Están los Ladrones?&quot; included old amplifiers to achieve a better sound, a 40-year-old German microphone, and several innovations in the instrumental mixes. &quot;Dónde Están los Ladrones?&quot; took nine months to produce, more than her previous records since more people worked on this album. Shakira commented, &quot;To me it&#x27;s a normal time, the gestation period for a baby. But many people wag their finger and tell me that the next one cannot take so long...&quot;

==Title and artwork==

The album&#x27;s title was inspired by one of Shakira&#x27;s trips to the capital of her native country, Colombia. At the El Dorado International Airport in Bogotá, after finishing her Tour Pies Descalzos, part of her luggage was stolen, including a briefcase that contained all the lyrics Shakira had been working on for the album. Shakira commented, &quot;The worst part about the whole thing was that I couldn&#x27;t remember them because of the mental block that can be caused by such a traumatic experience as the robbery of such a personal item&quot;. Feelings of impotence and emptiness overcame Shakira with such violence that for a couple of days and nights she thought of nothing but the people who had taken her material. She could not stop thinking about them: &quot;Who are they? What are they looking for? Where are they?&quot;. She searched for a reason behind the theft of her songs. &quot;I came to the conclusion that there are all types of thieves. A thief is not just a person who takes a physical object that doesn&#x27;t belong to him or her. There are thieves who steal feelings, space, time, dreams, rights&quot;, she explained.

The album&#x27;s title also evolves into a reference to the political corruption and general social mistrust pervading contemporary Colombian society. The album cover features a photo of her, soot-covered palms up, caught with her hands dirty. Shakira explained the cover, saying, &quot;[f]rom that point of view, we all have stolen at one time or another, myself included. The dirty hands [on the cover of her album] represent the shared guilt. No one is completely clean, in the end we are all accomplices&quot;. In keeping with her increasingly rocker sound, for this album she left her hair loose and messy and filled it up with little colorful braids, looking like a &quot;modern Medusa&quot; according to biographer Ximena Diego. Following the album&#x27;s commercial success, girls from several countries were copying Shakira&#x27;s style, colorfully braiding their hair and wearing friendship bracelets.

==Composition==
&quot;Dónde Están los Ladrones?&quot; consists of Latin pop and rock en español styles. The album opens with &quot;Ciega, Sordomuda&quot;, which is musically filled by typical Mexican trumpets over a disco dance loop and an electric guitar. Second track &quot;Si Te Vas&quot; lyrically depicts an angry Shakira who tells her lover &quot;&quot;. The next song, &quot;Moscas en la Casa&quot;, was inspired by the singer&#x27;s troubled relationship with Puerto Rican actor Osvaldo Ríos. Shakira lyrically expresses the sadness that she feels after a broken relationship. &quot;&quot;, she sings. In the next track &quot;No Creo&quot;, the singer expresses how she believes in nothing and nobody except her lover. The song references popular socially accepted or non-accepted norms such as herself, luck, Karl Marx, Jean-Paul Sartre, Venus and Mars, and Brian Weiss. The fifth song on &quot;Dónde Están los Ladrones?&quot; is &quot;Inevitable&quot;. Lyrically, in the hard rock ballad, Shakira confesses that she does not know how to prepare coffee, does not understand football, that she must have been unfaithful at some point and that she never wears a watch. The next track &quot;Octavo Día&quot; is a rock-oriented song that refers to God coming to Earth after finishing his work and discovering everything to be in ruins, and decides to quit his job and become a normal man. She also namechecks Bill Clinton and Michael Jackson.
Seventh song &quot;Que Vuelvas&quot; is another song inspired by her relationship with Ríos. It was musically compared to Shakira&#x27;s past single &quot;Estoy Aquí&quot; (1996). The following track, &quot;Tú&quot;, lyrically expresses the sweetness of love, with Shakira singing: &quot; and &quot;. The ninth song is &quot;Dónde Están los Ladrones?&quot;, a guitar-driven song which criticizes the politic and social reality in South American nations at the time of the album&#x27;s release. She sings, &quot;. Finally, she sentences the aristocracy singing, &quot;. The following track on &quot;Dónde Están los Ladrones?&quot; is &quot;Sombra de Ti&quot;. During the song, Shakira remembers a past love, singing, &quot;&quot;. The album&#x27;s closing song &quot;Ojos Así&quot; is accompanied by a &quot;Lambadalike middle eastern rhythm&quot;. Containing a verse in Arabic, lyrically Shakira laments that even though she has traveled from Bahrain to Beirut, she has never found eyes like her lover has.

==Singles==
&quot;Ciega, Sordomuda&quot; was released on 7 September 1998 as the album&#x27;s lead single. It reached number one in Shakira&#x27;s native Colombia less than a week after its release, becoming the fastest pop song to do so there. It also reached number one on charts of countries in Central America, Venezuela and the United States. The music video for the song was directed by Gustavo Garzón. In it, Shakira is arrested along with many other people, and escapes with the help of her love interest who later dresses as a policeman. Shakira hides in a wig store, pretending to be a mannequin, and drives a car blindfolded while the whole city searches for her, blindfolded as well. It was nominated for a Lo Nuestro Award for Video of the Year in 1999. &quot;Tú&quot; was selected as the second single from the album. It repeated the success of the previous single, reaching the top positions on both the US Latin Pop Songs and Hot Latin Songs charts. The black-and-white music video for the single was directed by Emilio Estefan in Orlando, Florida. &quot;Inevitable&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s third single. In the music video directed by Garzón, Shakira sings the song to an audience in a circular stage. The single was also a success, reaching numbers two and three on the US Latin Pop Songs and Hot Latin Songs charts.

&quot;No Creo&quot; was released as the fourth single from &quot;Dónde Están los Ladrones?&quot;, and was also a commercial success, reaching numbers two and nine on the US Latin Pop Songs and Hot Latin Songs charts, respectively. The song received two music videos: the first was the performance from the &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; album and the second was also directed by Gustavo Garzón. &quot;Ojos Así&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s fifth single. The track reached numbers nine and twenty-two on the US Latin Pop Songs and Hot Latin Songs component charts, respectively. The music video for &quot;Ojos Así&quot; features Shakira performing the song for a crowd, with a giant neon eye in the background, which shoots out sparks and catches fire towards the end of the video. There are also scenes of Shakira belly dancing in front of a dark purple background, with snakes painted down her arms and red lines painted on her head. The video won the International Viewer&#x27;s Choice Award (North) at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards, while it was also nominated for the same award in the South category and for a Latin Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video. &quot;Moscas en la Casa&quot; was released as the sixth single from &quot;Dónde Están los Ladrones?&quot; It peaked at numbers ten and twenty-five on the US Latin Pop Songs and Hot Latin Songs charts, respectively. Several promotional single also released in select countries such &quot;Octavo Día&quot; (1998), &quot;Si Te Vas&quot; (1999), and &quot;Dónde Están los Ladrones?&quot; (2000).

==Critical reception==

&quot;Dónde Están los Ladrones?&quot; received critical acclaim from music critics. Alex Henderson from AllMusic gave the album five stars out of five, saying that the album was &quot;arguably the finest and most essential album that she recorded in the 1990s&quot; and also stated that besides its lyrics, the album would impress even non-Spanish-speaking listeners with its &quot;attractive melodies and the emotion that the artist brings to her songs&quot;. He finished his review saying, &quot;if you&#x27;re acquiring your first Shakira release, this would be the ideal choice&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine was also positive and called it a &quot;like-minded set brimming with forlorn, lovesick testimonials set to a mainstream pop/rock sound laced occasionally with edgy guitar and vocal interludes&quot;, picking the song &quot;Ojos Así&quot; as the &quot;most satisfying&quot; track on the album. Christopher John Farley, while reviewing positively &quot;Dónde Están los Ladrones?&quot; in his &quot;Time&quot; magazine review, said that the buzz around Shakira was justified. &quot;On her latest CD she charges Latin pop with rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll to thrilling effect. Even when her music gets loud, Shakira&#x27;s vibrant contralto remains sweet and expressive. [...] Missing out on this collection would be at least a misdemeanor&quot;, he completed. Mark Kemp, writing for the book &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, said that the album mined a familiar territory in Shakira&#x27;s music, but it &quot;holds together with stronger songs, a beefier sound, and more confident vocals&quot;. He finished his review by saying that it was &quot;hard to imagine a singer barely into her 20s having written and recorded such an inventive set of songs&quot;, while complimenting Estefan&#x27;s production, calling it &quot;surprisingly tasteful and evenhanded&quot;.

A reviewer from MTV said that &quot;Latin pop innovator Shakira represents the kind of eventuality for which Alanis Morissette, Bob Dylan and Beck are all precedents&quot;, but also noted that &quot;Those expecting polite recreations of Latin styles past will be sorely disappointed, but listeners for whom crossover is the norm will find a wealth of satisfaction in Donde Estan los Ladrones, whether or not they understand the words&quot;. Leila Cobo Hanlon from &quot;Miami Herald&quot; was positive, saying that the album &quot;retains Shakira&#x27;s trademark sound — rock-laced pop melodies backed by acoustic guitars — as well as her deeply personal approach to music-making&quot;, but also noting that &quot;ironically, the album&#x27;s only failures occur when it looks too closely at its predecessor&quot;. Sputnikmusic website gave a positive review saying &quot;¿Dónde Están Los Ladrones? is the gem of Shakira&#x27;s discography, and one of the best Spanish pop releases of the past decade&quot;, although criticized its &quot;slight lack of variety&quot;. Franz Reynold from &quot;Latin Beat Magazine&quot; noted that &quot;while many of the cuts on this collection are definitely chart-bound, that is due more to the fact that she doesn&#x27;t stray too far from the previous formula, than it does to any hope that success provides room for expansion&quot;, but complimented tracks like &quot;Inevitable&quot; and &quot;Tú&quot;. Rubens Herbst from Brazilian newspaper &quot;A Notícia&quot; gave a mixed review, writing that the album was &quot;homogenous, well-produced and full of potential hits&quot;, but &quot;empty and forgettable, like every FM pop — and the fact of singing in Spanish doesn&#x27;t take Shakira away from the label&quot;. In July 2017, the album ranked at number 95 on the list for the 150 greatest female albums of all time by the National Public Radio.

In Shakira&#x27;s native Colombia, it was certified triple-platinum by the Asociación Colombiana de Productores de Fonogramas (ASINCOL) after selling 180,000 copies within the country. The album was also certified triple-platinum in Chile and Venezuela, double-platinum in Mexico and Uruguay, quadruple-platinum in Argentina, and platinum in Spain. &quot;Dónde Están los Ladrones?&quot; sold over 4 million copies worldwide.

== Legacy ==

According to music journalist Sebastián Peña from &quot;Shock&quot; magazine, the record was intended to surpass the success, quality and attention that Shakira had achieved with her previous album, something that she undoubtedly achieved. He added that Shakira dared to do something that very few artists of that time they had done for the fear of not playing on the radio, saying many things, criticizing the corrupt and those who live their lives superficially, achieving in several words to be revolutionary for that decade. Back then, when a new stream of Latin artists were taking off like Carolina Sabino, none managed to transcend with a well-established fan base, something that Shakira did. The singer was also credited with opening new doors for women in the industry and showed to people that she could become a &quot;superhero&quot; for men and women, despite the fact that female artists always had them in the background. She was seen by the media as the Latin Alanis Morissette due to their similarity in their way of expressing themselves and their visual proposal, and thanks to this album Shakira managed to give greater strength and visibility to the international female boom at the end of the first millennium. The album led Shakira to be dubbed by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as &quot;The princess of rock&quot; and to be described as &quot;The Colombian Artist of the millennium&quot; in her country.

According to Ximena Diego&#x27;s book &quot;Shakira: Mujer Full of Grace&quot;, Shakira&#x27;s style on her album and more specifically the video &quot;Ciega, Sordomuda&quot; became a trend in several young women of the time; various teenage girls imitated the outfit and accessories that the singer used during the time, thousands of letters reached her from fans, her music sounded in different children&#x27;s toys around the country even establishing the bases to take Latin music to totally foreign cultures such as European and Asian. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; credits Shakira with redefining Latin music with her first two albums, being &quot;Dónde Están los Ladrones?&quot; the album that changed the rules of rock en español, laying the foundation for future Latin rockers also introduced her to the American public and made her a household name in Latin rock. According to the same magazine, female artists such as Francisca Valenzuela and Jessie Reyez explained in interviews about the lyrics of love and heartbreak that in their words this album inspired a whole generation of women to write their own songs without &quot;apologizing&quot;. It was also considered the most influential album among women and the LGBT community according to a survey.

&quot;Dónde Están los Ladrones?&quot; is considered a benchmark for a whole generation of young Latin artists. Sebastián Yatra, Francisca Valenzuela and Camilo all have cited it as a point of inspiration for their musical works. In 2020, it was selected as one of the 500 greatest albums of all time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, being one of the few Latin and the only rock in Spanish on the list. In July 2017, the album ranked at number 95 on the list for the 150 greatest female albums of all time by the National Public Radio. &quot;Dónde Están los Ladrones?&quot; was included as one of the &quot;1000 Recordings You Must Hear Before You Die&quot; by Sony Music. In 2024, a group of various music journalists from all over Latin America made a consensus where they ranked the album in position 18 on their list &quot;The 600 essential albums for the history of Latin America.&quot; In 2024, Rolling Stone magazine placed it at number 82 on its list &quot;100 Greatest Album Covers of All Time.&quot;

==Promotion==

Promotion for &quot;Dónde Están los Ladrones?&quot; began when Shakira performed its lead single &quot;Ciega, Sordomuda&quot; on the &quot;Con T de Tarde&quot; show in Spain, in September 1998. In October, Shakira traveled to Brazil and was featured in many TV programs, including &quot;Domingo Legal&quot; on SBT, which she appeared twice. On 28 January 1999, Shakira made her debut on American television by appearing on &quot;The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot;. Gloria Estefan introduced and interviewed the singer instead of O&#x27;Donnell, before she performed an English version of &quot;Inevitable&quot;, which she sang while suffering from fever due to nervousness. In February 1999, she went to Peru to perform on &quot;Laura&quot; TV show. Shakira also sang &quot;Inevitable&quot; in a medley with &quot;Come to My Window&quot; with singer Melissa Etheridge on the ALMA Awards on 6 March 1999. During a promotional tour she returned to Brazil in March 1999, and performed on several TV shows such as &quot;Domingão do Faustão&quot;. In May, she returned to the United States to perform at the Premio Lo Nuestro 1999 in Miami, and at the Cinco de Mayo Festival in Los Angeles. In November, Shakira sang at the Premios Amigo in Spain, while she also performed on the Miss Colombia 1999 election, closing the event. Shakira performed &quot;Ojos Así&quot; on the first-ever Latin Grammy Awards on September 13, 2000, giving a &quot;wildly&quot; choreographed performance against a backdrop of tiki torches and images of water as she writhed about in a red pantsuit.

In order to promote the album and &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;, Shakira embarked on the Tour Anfibio which began on 17 March 2000 in Panama City, Panama, and ended on 12 May 2000 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It was sponsored by Nokia. The name &quot;anfibio&quot; was chosen by Shakira for its resemblance with her: earthy, viscerally connected to the water element, capable of adapting and willing to undergo metamorphosis. Shakira said about the tour&#x27;s name: &quot;You&#x27;ll have to find out. It&#x27;s an invitation for you to watch the show and find out. It has nothing to do with past performances. You&#x27;ll see an evolved and renewed Shakira. It&#x27;s a spectacle of many transformations that will prevent the public from getting bored&quot;. The tour&#x27;s setlist consisted of songs from her albums &quot;Pies Descalzos&quot; and &quot;Dónde Están los Ladrones?&quot; In addition, she included an a capella song, &quot;Alfonsina y el Mar&quot;, originally by Argentine folk singer Mercedes Sosa. Criticism of the tour included the high ticket prices, overselling of tickets in Guatemala, which according to the press could have caused a tragedy, the long delays at the start of the show and its short duration, and the accusation of the use of pre-recorded music in Puerto Rico. Despite the criticism, the tour was a financial success, earning Shakira a position in the list of Top 50 Tours published in the summer of 2000 by &quot;Pollstar&quot; magazine.

==English version==
The success of &quot;Dónde Están los Ladrones?&quot; prompted American singer Gloria Estefan, Emilio Estefan&#x27;s wife, to persuade Shakira to record the album in English and attempt to cross over into the mainstream pop industry. However, Shakira was initially hesitant to record songs in English as it was not her first language, so she offered to translate &quot;Ojos Así&quot; into English in order to show her that &quot;it could translate well&quot;. Shakira then began translating the song herself and showed it to Gloria Estefan, and would say, &quot;Quite honestly, I can&#x27;t do this better!.&quot; As Shakira wanted to have full control over her recordings, she decided to learn English better to enable her to write her own songs. She was supposed to return to studio to record an English version of the album in January 1999. It did not came to fruition, and a new album titled &quot;Laundry Service&quot; was released instead as her first crossover album.
