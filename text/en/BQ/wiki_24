<text>The M60, officially the Machine Gun, Caliber 7.62 mm, M60, is a family of American general-purpose machine guns firing 7.62×51mm NATO cartridges from a disintegrating belt of M13 links. There are several types of ammunition approved for use in the M60, including ball, tracer, and armor-piercing rounds.

It was adopted in 1960 and issued to units beginning in 1960. It has served with every branch of the U.S. military and still serves with the armed forces of other nations. Its manufacture and continued upgrade for military and commercial purchase continues into the 21st century, although it has been replaced or supplemented in most roles by other designs, most notably the M240 machine gun in U.S. service.

==Overview==

The M60 is a belt-fed machine gun that fires the 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge (similar to .308 Winchester), which is commonly used in larger rifles, such as the M14. It is generally used as a crew-served weapon and operated by a team of two or three individuals. The team consists of the gunner, the assistant gunner (AG), and the ammunition bearer. The gun&#x27;s weight and the amount of ammunition it can consume when fired make it difficult for a single soldier to carry and operate. The gunner carries the weapon and between 200 and 1,000 rounds of ammunition depending on strength and stamina. The assistant carries a spare barrel and extra ammunition and reloads and spots targets for the gunner. The ammunition bearer carries additional ammunition and the tripod with associated traversing and elevation mechanism, if issued, and fetches more ammunition as needed during firing.
The M60 can be accurately fired at short ranges from the shoulder thanks to its design. This was an initial requirement for the design and a hold-over in concept from the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle. It may also be fired from the integral bipod, M122 tripod, and some other mounts.

M60 ammunition comes in a cloth bandolier containing a cardboard box of 100 pre-linked rounds. The M60 uses the M13 ammunition link, a change from the older M1 link system with which it was not compatible. The cloth bandolier is reinforced to allow it to be hung from the current version of the feed tray. Historically, units in Vietnam used B3A cans from C-rations packs locked into the ammunition box attachment system to roll the ammunition belts over for a straighter and smoother feed to the loading port to enhance reliability of feed. The later models changed the ammunition box attachment point and made this adaptation unnecessary.

The M60 has been adopted by various military agencies around the world. It also has been updated and modernized throughout the years to meet modern military requirements.

==History==

The M60 machine gun began development in the late 1940s as a program for a new, lighter 7.62 mm machine gun. It was partly derived from German guns of World War II (most notably the FG 42 and the MG 42), but it contained American innovations as well. The final evaluation version was designated the T161E3. It was intended to replace the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle and M1919A6 Browning machine gun in the squad automatic weapon role, and in the medium machine gun role. One of the weapons tested against it during its procurement process was the FN MAG.

The U.S. Army adopted the T161E3 as the M60 in 1957. The decision to adopt the M60 instead of foreign designs, like modified versions of the proven German MG 42 or the still-unproven FN MAG, was largely due to Congressional requirements that preference be given to the designs of U.S. arms manufacturers primarily to avoid licensing fees, but also to support U.S. firms.

=== Vietnam War ===
Many U.S. units used the M60 during the Vietnam War as a squad automatic weapon. Every soldier in the rifle squad would carry an additional 200 linked rounds of ammunition for the M60, a spare barrel, or both. The up-gunned M113 armored personnel carrier added two M60 gunners beside the main .50-caliber machine gun while the Patrol Boat, River had one in addition to two .50-cal mounts.

The M60 received the nickname &quot;The Pig&quot; due to its bulky size and appetite for ammunition. Vietnam&#x27;s tropical climate harshly affected weapons, and the M60 was no exception. Its light weight led to it being easily damaged and critical parts like the bolt and operating rod wore out quickly. Even so, soldiers appreciated the gun&#x27;s handling, mechanical simplicity, and effective operation from a variety of firing positions. United States Navy SEALs used M60s with shorter barrels and no front sights to reduce weight. Some SEALs had feed chutes from backpacks to have a belt of hundreds of rounds ready to fire without needing to reload.

Many incidents demonstrated the effectiveness of the M60 in combat. In 1966, Medal of Honor recipient Lance Corporal Richard Pittman, a Marine with 1/5 (1st Battalion/5th Marine Regiment), used the M60 to engage superior elements of the 324th North Vietnamese Army (NVA) Division, defeating two enemy machine gun positions and suppressing enemies in his immediate vicinity, then advancing another 50 meters into the face of more attacking NVA.
In the 1980s, the Army partially replaced the M60 by the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon within infantry squads. Their new doctrine reduced the general-purpose machine gun role in favor of portability and a greater volume of fire. However, many disliked the M249, which was less reliable, accurate, and long-ranged, and fired a 5.56 mm round that was lighter than the M60&#x27;s 7.62 mm round. The M60 was retained in the vehicle-mounted and the general-purpose roles due to its greater power and range.

The U.S. Marine Corps, which became concerned about the M60&#x27;s reliability, weight, and the high round counts, adopted the M60E3 to replace most original M60s in infantry units. The M60E3 was five pounds lighter than the original M60. It included a forward pistol grip and had the bipod mounted to the receiver rather than the barrel. The weapon still was not durable and its performance was reduced.

In the early 1990s, Saco Defense addressed Navy Special Warfare requirements to develop a retrofit parts package for the machine gun. Called the M60E4, it was more reliable and durable than the M60E3, had a &quot;duckbill&quot; flash suppressor, and a shorter and thicker positive lock gas cylinder extension. The first NAVSPECWAR units received it in late 1994, when it was designated the Mk 43 Mod 0.
In January 1994, the U.S. Army began the Medium Machine Gun Upgrade Kit program. The only two competitors were M60 and M240 versions. Saco offered an &quot;enhanced&quot; M60E3 with improved parts, and FN offered the M240 variant of its MAG; both weapons were upgrade kits of weapons already in service. Eighteen guns of each were tested until December 1995. There were two main performance areas: mean rounds between stoppages (MRBS-jams) and mean rounds between failures (MRBF-parts breaking). 50,000 rounds were fired through both guns. The M240 had 2,962 MRBS and 6,442 MRBF, compared to the M60&#x27;s 846 MRBS and 1,669 MRBF. As a result, the M240 was declared the winner and accepted into infantry service. Although the M60 was lighter, had better balance, was more controllable, and there were many in the inventory, it did not work reliably enough. Starting with Ranger battalions, the U.S. Army began adopting and modifying M240 variants to replace their remaining M60s in the early 1990s.

The M60, though largely phased out, continued to be used in the 21st century by U.S. Navy SEALs. It was the main 7.62 mm machine gun used by some U.S. special operations forces to the late 1990s. As of 2005 it was used by the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Navy, and some reserve units.

In 2015, the Danish Army adopted an M60E6 variant from U.S. Ordnance to replace their aging MG3s in infantry roles.

==Design==

The M60 is a gas-operated, air-cooled, belt-fed, automatic machine gun that fires from the open-bolt position and is chambered in 7.62×51mm NATO. It has a cyclic rate of fire of around 500–650 rounds per minute (RPM). Ammunition is usually fed into the weapon from a 100 or 250-round disintegrating, metallic split-link belt.
The design drew on many common concepts in firearms manufacture of the period, such as stamped sheet metal construction, belt feed (a modified mechanism for belt feed from the MG 42 with a single pawl), quick barrel replacement, a pistol grip and stock, and a semi bullpup design similar to the FG 42 (much of the action occupies the weapon&#x27;s stock). The M60&#x27;s operating system of an operating rod turning a rotating bolt was inspired by the FG 42, which was based on the much earlier Lewis Gun. The M60 was even constructed with a secondary assisting firing pin spring that is used in the FG 42 in semi-automatic mode even though it is actually unnecessary in the M60, which operates only in full automatic mode. The M60&#x27;s gas operation is unique, and drew on technical advances of the period, particularly the White &quot;gas expansion and cutoff&quot; principle also exploited by the M14 rifle. The M60&#x27;s gas system was simpler than other gas systems and easier to clean.

The M60 was designed for mass production, like the MG 42 it was based on. While the M1919 required much machining for its large, recoil-operated internal mechanisms, the M60&#x27;s stamped sheet receiver had a gas-operated, carrier-cammed bolt mechanism; the same type of mechanism was used on the Lewis machine gun. The straight-line layout allowed the operating rod and buffer to run directly back into the buttstock and reduce the overall length of the weapon.
As with all such weapons, it can be fired from the shoulder, hip, or underarm position. However, to achieve the maximum effective range, it is recommended that a bipod-steadied position or a tripod-mounted position be used, and the gun fired in bursts of 3–5 rounds. The weapon is heavy and difficult to aim when firing without support, though the weight helps reduce the felt recoil. The large grip also allowed the weapon to be conveniently carried at the hip. The gun can be stripped using a live round of ammunition as a tool.

The M60 is often used with its own integrated bipod or with the M122 tripod. The M60 is considered effective up to 1,100 meters when firing at an area target and mounted on a tripod; up to 800 meters when firing at an area target using the integral bipod; up to 600 meters when firing at a point target; and up to 200 meters when firing at a moving point target. United States Marine Corps doctrine holds that the M60 and other weapons in its class are capable of suppressive fire on area targets out to 1,500 meters if the gunner is sufficiently skilled.

Originally, an experimental M91 tripod was developed for the M60, but an updated M2 tripod design, which became the M122, was selected over it. The M122 was replaced in the 2000s (decade) by a new mount, in time for the M60 to also be used with it.

===Ammunition===
The M60 family of weapons are capable of firing standard NATO rounds of the appropriate caliber. Most common in U.S. use are M61 armor-piercing, M62 tracer, and M80 Ball. For training purposes, M63 Dummy and M82 blanks are used. Newer tungsten-cored M993 Armor-piercing rounds may also be fired in the M60, though they did not enter the inventory until after the M60 was withdrawn from service in active-duty units.

When firing blanks, the M13 or M13A1 blank-firing adaptor (BFA) is necessary in order to produce enough gas pressure to cycle the weapon with blanks. All ammunition must be fixed in a NATO standard M13 disintegrating metallic split-link belt to feed into the weapon.

The standard combat ammunition mix for the M60 consists of sequences of four ball (M80) cartridges and one tracer (M62) in belts of 100 rounds. The four-to-one ratio theoretically allows the gunner to accurately &quot;walk&quot; the fire into the enemy. Tracer bullets do not fly quite the same trajectory as ball, and the weapon&#x27;s sights must be used for accurate fire—particularly at ranges in excess of 800 meters, where 7.62×51mm NATO tracer bullets usually burn out and are no longer visible. This is a problem for all weapons in this caliber using this tracer round.

===Design flaws===
At the time of the M60&#x27;s development, other designs, like the Belgian FN MAG and the German Rheinmetall MG 3 (MG42 derivative), had yet to enter production. In Army tests, the M60 proved fairly effective, but in the jungles of Southeast Asia, it displayed a number of troubling issues.

A common complaint was the weapon&#x27;s weight; though the M60 was among the lightest 7.62 mm machine guns of the era, the weapon was poorly balanced and thus awkward to carry for long periods. The single most common complaint was that the M60 was unreliable in extreme conditions and prone to jamming and other malfunctions during heavy firing, especially when it was dirty. Sometimes spent casings would fail to extract and stay stuck inside the chamber, forcing a barrel change before it could be fired again.

Due to the rotating bolt design, the M60 required stoning of burrs or roughness on the lugs, which could increase headspace, occasionally causing cartridge case stretching and head separation. This required replacement of the bolt. The M60 sometimes (depending on the version) tore off the rims from fired cartridge cases during the extraction cycle, causing a jam that required a cleaning rod to be rammed down the barrel to extract the torn cartridge, a potentially deadly procedure while under fire in combat. The barrel latch mechanism (a swinging lever) could catch on the gunner&#x27;s equipment and accidentally unlatch, causing the barrel to fall out of the gun. On new M60s, the lever was replaced with a push button mechanism that was less likely to be accidentally released, but few of the older M60s were modified due to expense, with many of the extant weapons still bearing them.

The grip/trigger housing assembly is held in place with a rather fragile leaf spring clip instead of the captive pins used in other designs. The spring clip has been known to be prone to breakage since the first trials at Aberdeen Proving Ground. Duct tape and cable ties have been seen on M60s in the field, placed there by their crews in case the spring clip breaks. The sear in the trigger mechanism gained a reputation for wearing down, and a malfunction could cause the gun to &quot;run away&quot;. A second sear notch was eventually added to the operating rod to reduce the chance of this happening.

==Variants==


The nomenclature &quot;M60&quot; describes either the first adopted variant or, generically, the family of weapons were derived from it. Major variations include the M60E1 (an improved variant that did not enter production), the M60E2 (a variant designed to be used from fixed mounts as a co-axial for armored vehicles or in helicopter armament systems), the M60E3 (a lightweight variant) and the M60E4 (another improved variant, designated as the Mk 43 Mod 0 by the U.S. Navy).

The M60C was adopted for use on fixed mounts on aircraft. It was characterized by the use of an electric solenoid to operate the trigger and a hydraulic system to charge the weapon. The M60D differed from the base model by employing spade grips, a different sighting system, and lacking a forearm. It was typically employed as a door gun on helicopters or as a pintle-mounted weapon as on the Type 88 K1 tank.

There are many smaller variants among each type, between makers of the firearm, and over time.

===Variant summary===
*T161: The M60&#x27;s developmental designation before it was type-classified in the 1950s.
*M60: The basic model, type-classified in 1957.
*M60E1: An improved variant that did not enter production. The primary difference was the handle fixed to the barrel and the removal of the gas cylinder and bipod from the barrel assembly.
*M60E2: Used in vehicles as a coaxial machine gun; electrically fired.
*M60B: Used in helicopters in the 1960s and 1970s; unmounted.
*M60C: Used in fixed mounts in aircraft in the 1960s and 1970s; electrically fired and hydraulically charged.
*M60D: Replaced the M60B; a pintle-mounted variant used especially in armament subsystem for helicopters, but also some other roles.
*M60E3: An updated, lightweight variant adopted in the 1980s.
*M60E4 (Mk 43 Mod 0/1): An improved variant of the 1990s that looks similar to the M60E3, but has many improvements. It has subvariants of its own and is also used by the U.S. Navy (as the Mk 43 Mod 0/1). The Mk 43 Mod 1 is a specialized variant with additions such as extra rails for mounting accessories.
*M60E6: A lightened and improved variant of the M60E4.

===M60===


The initial variant was officially adopted by the U.S. Army in the late 1950s, though at this time it was only intended for the infantry. It was known as the T161 before it was adopted (specifically the T161E3) and was chosen over the competing T52 during testing in the 1950s. They both used a similar feed and were both gas-operated, but the T161 was easier to produce and its different internals performed better. The model that won the competition was the T161E3.

The model was type-classified in 1957 and entered production. It saw its first heavy use in the 1960s. The basic design has undergone some smaller changes and has been produced by different manufacturers.

===M60E1===
The M60E1 was the first major variant of the original M60. It did not go into full-scale production, though many of its features were included in the later E3 and E4 variants. Some of its features were also incorporated into the existing M60 production. This mainly changed how the gas cylinder, the barrel, and the bipod were connected in the first iteration. The M60 and the M60E1 are two different versions. Opinions vary on whether the M60E1 was officially adopted.

One of the more noticeable changes on the M60E1 is that the bipod attachment point was moved to the gas tube rather than the barrel (like on the later M60E3). It did not, however, have a forward pistol grip, as was added on the E3 variant.

===M60E2===
The M60E2 is used on armored fighting vehicles, such as the M48A5, later M60 Patton tanks and the K1 Type 88. It lacks many of the external components of the standard M60, including stock and grips. The M60E2 was electrically fired, but had a manual trigger as a backup, as well as a metal loop at the back for charging. The gas tube below the barrel was extended to the full length of the weapon to vent the gas outside the vehicle. This version achieved a mean time between failures of 1,669 during testing in the 1970s.

The M60E2 is used on the South Korea&#x27;s K1 Type 88 tank as a co-axial weapon, along with an M60D on a pintle mount.

===M60B===
The M60B was a short-lived variant designed to be fired from helicopters, with limited deployment made in the 1960s and 1970s. Nicknamed the &quot;Free Gun&quot; by aircrew door gunners, it was not mounted, just held, and was soon replaced by the pintle-mounted M60D. The &#x27;B&#x27; model differed most noticeably in that it had no bipod and featured a different rear stock than the regular model. It still had a pistol grip (as opposed to spade grips). The M60B&#x27;s advantage over pintle-mounted variants was that it had a wider and much less restricted field of fire.

An unusual arrangement of the M60B was done by HA(L)-3 squadron aircrew by removing the sights, shortening the barrel inline to the gas block, removing the stock to shorten the receiver as the shorter buffer spring increased the rate of fire, an improvised side mounted grip was installed on the handguard. This arrangement allowed the door gunners easier movement of the weapon as well as firing sideways improved the belt feed performance.

===M60C===
The M60C is a variant of the standard M60 for aircraft mounting, such as in helicopter armament subsystems. It lacks things like the bipod, pistol grip, and iron sights. The main difference between the standard M60 and the &quot;C&quot; variant is the electronic control system and the hydraulic swivel system used. It could be fired from the cockpit by the pilot or co-pilot. It is an electronically controlled, hydraulic-powered, air-cooled, gas-operated, belt-fed weapon system. It used the M2, M6, and M16 armament subsystems and was mounted on the OH-13 Sioux, the OH-23 Raven, the UH-1B Huey, and comprised the standard fixed armament of the OV-10 Bronco. M60C production was on the order of several hundred. It was also used in the XM19 gun pod.

===M60D===
The M60D is a mounted variant of the standard M60. It can be mounted on boats, vehicles and as a pintle-mounted door gun in helicopters. When used in aircraft, it differs from the M60C in that it is not controlled by the pilot—rather, it is mounted in a door and operated by a member of the crew. Like the rest of the M60 family, it is an air-cooled, gas-operated, belt-fed weapon. Unlike other models, however, the M60D normally has spade grips and an aircraft ring-type sight or similar, as well as an improved ammunition feed system. A canvas bag is also affixed to the gun to capture ejected casings and links, preventing them from being sucked into the rotor blades or into an engine intake. The M60D was equipped on the UH-1B Huey (using the M23, XM29, M59, and the Sagami mounts), the CH-47 Chinook (using the M24 and M41 mounts) in both door and ramp locations, the ACH-47A &quot;Guns-A-Go-Go&quot; variant of the Chinook (using the XM32 and XM33 mounts), and on the UH-60 Black Hawk (using the M144 mount). The M60D is also used by the British on Royal Air Force Chinooks. In US service, the M60D has been primarily replaced by the M240H. The M60D is still manufactured by U.S. Ordnance and still used on the SH-60 Seahawk.

===M60E3===
The M60E3 was fielded c. 1986 in an attempt to remedy problems with earlier versions of the M60 for infantry use. It is a lightweight, &quot;improved&quot; variant intended to reduce the load carried by the gunner. Unlike its predecessors, the M60E3 has several updated modern features. It has a bipod (attached to the receiver) for improved stability, ambidextrous safety, universal sling attachments, a carrying handle on the barrel, and a simplified gas system. However, these features also caused almost as many problems for the weapon as they fixed. There were different types of barrels used, but the lightweight barrel was not as safe for sustained fire at 200 rounds per minute as heavier types. Despite this, some personnel claim to have witnessed successful prolonged firing of the weapon. The stellite superalloy barrel liner makes it possible, but the excessive heat generated by this process may quickly render the gun unusable. There were two main barrels, a lightweight barrel and another heavier type—the former for when lighter weight was desired, and the latter for situations where more sustained fire was required.
The reduced-weight components also reduced the durability of the weapon, making it more prone to rapid wear and parts breakage than the original. Most infantry units in the U.S. Army and Marine Corps have now switched over to the M240 as their general-purpose machine gun, which is more reliable (particularly when dirty) and seems to be well liked by the troops for its ruggedness, despite the fact that it weighs 27.6 lb (12.5 kg) compared to the standard M60 at 23.15 lb (10.5 kg).

U.S. Navy SEALs continued to use the &quot;CAR-60&quot; (M60E3) version due to its lighter weight and slower rate of fire, which allows a more effective duration of fire with allowable levels of ammunition carried.

The U.S. Air Force Security Forces received the M60E3 from 1988 to 1989. All USAF M60E3s were withdrawn from general issue by 1990, because it did not meet the vehicle mount requirements of the Cadillac Gage Ranger and due to overheating problems. The M60E3 did remain in the Air Force as weapons converted back to M60 configuration with the E3 X-stamped via locally installed kits issued from depot. The Air Force cut the barrel change times, sustained fire 100 rounds per minute change barrel every 10 minutes (M60) to five minutes (M60E3), and rapid fire 200 rounds per minute change barrel every five minutes to two minutes.

===M60E4/Mk 43 Mod 0/1===
The M60E4 or Mk 43 is a 7.62×51mm NATO general-purpose machine gun. Evolved from the M60 machine gun series, it has several improvements over the originals. The M60E4/Mk 43 series includes the Mod 0 and Mod 1 configurations.

It is the primary light machine gun used in some NATO countries and other U.S. Government export-approved countries. The Mk 43 machine gun currently is manufactured solely by U.S. Ordnance (USORD). USORD has produced it since 2000.

The M60E4/Mk 43 is one of the modernized variants in the generations of the old M60 family and incorporates a number of improvements over past versions. Externally, it looks somewhat like the M60E3, but it has many internal changes and improvements that modernize the effectiveness and reliability of this weapon. In general it is a more reliable weapon than all previous M60s. Externally, it features a different forward grip, iron sights, butt stock and bipod. The M60E4/Mk 43 has higher pull for the belt, and is available in a variety of configurations. Older M60 models can be upgraded with a conversion kit manufactured by U.S. Ordnance to the M60E4/Mk 43. The M60E4/Mk 43 were primarily developed in the 1990s and have continued to be redeveloped in the 2000s (decade). Early Mk 43s had some distinct differences from the E4 (such as a duckbill flash suppressor), though by the 2000s these distinctions seemed to have ended.
The Navy has designated this weapon as the Mk 43 Mod 0. It was developed for the U.S. Navy SEALs to replace their existing stock of M60E3 machine guns fitted with shorter &quot;assault barrels&quot;. These weapons are identical to standard M60E4s, with the exception of the barrel length, and can be used either as suppressive fire or direct fire weapons. The Mk 43 Mod 1 adds significantly more rail attachment points to the weapon&#x27;s receiver cover and handguard.

U.S. Ordnance&#x27;s website states in their FAQ, as of 2005, that the &quot;M60E4 and the Mk 43 are the same weapon system&quot;. The M60E4 and Mk 43 variants in the past were roughly similar, although they are part of the same family. While it might be fair to say that the Mk 43s are a type of M60E4, there are technical differences between any given M60E4 model. Early Mk 43s have certain differences over M60E4 from the same period, the most obvious being the duck-bill flash hider and different handguard. This difference is no longer seen on the current Mk 43s still manufactured by U.S. Ordnance.

In Army trials during the 1990s the M60E4 produced by Saco Defense was pitted against the M240E4 (then called) produced by FN for a new medium machine gun to be used by the infantry. The competition was to replace the decades-old M60s. The M240E4 won, and was then classified as the M240B. While the M240B had been more reliable in the tests, it was noted to be a heavier weapon than the M60E4.

The M60E4/Mk 43 is a modern update to the entire series, such that it is also available in many of the previous configurations, such as a co-axial weapon. Kits are offered to convert older models to the E4 standard.

====Design details====
The M60E4/Mk 43 is a gas-operated, disintegrating-link, belt-fed, air-cooled machine gun that fires from an open bolt. It is the newest, upgraded variant of the M60 series machine guns. It fires a 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge, which offers accuracy, reliability, and stopping power. It fires at a cyclic rate of around 500 to 600 rounds per minute, with an effective distance of 1200 yards (1100 meters). The weapon&#x27;s controllable, yet lethal, rate of fire allows for accurate firing in the standing, kneeling and prone positions.

The M60E4/Mk 43 is ambidextrous, and shares its parts with all previous M60 configurations, including vehicle mounts. The adjustable front sight allows for zeroing of the primary and spare barrel, the chrome and induction hardening lengthens service life, and the ammunition is now mounted on the receiver, preventing damage, and thereby feed failure. The machine gun&#x27;s light weight—20 to 21 pounds (9 to 10 kilograms)—and compact design make it easy to carry long distances and maneuver in tight spaces. It also allows for the weapon to be fired from the shoulder accurately.

The M60E4/Mk 43 Mod 0, typically used as an infantry machine gun, features an injection-molded composite handguard. The weapon system&#x27;s quick-change barrel is crucial for safety and efficiency, particularly when the operator is under fire. With the lightweight bipod mounted to the receiver, the barrel can be changed without removing the bipod.

The M60E4/Mk 43 Mod 1 has multiple M1913 rail mounting points for mounting optics, aiming lasers, and accessories for around-the-clock capability. It mounts directly or adapts to all standard NATO tripod and vehicle mounts.

Barrels are stellite lined for sustained fire and extended barrel life. They are available in short, long and heavy fluted configurations for use in various applications. All major components of the M60E4/Mk 43 directly interchange with other M60 configurations. U.S. Ordnance manufactures a conversion kit that upgrades older M60s to its M60E4/Mk 43 model.

===M60E6===
The M60E6 is an improvement on the M60E4 and the latest M60 variant. It won against the HK121 in the Danish Army&#x27;s GPMG replacement program to replace the M/62 in March 2014. The weight has been reduced to , lighter than the M/62. Its rate of fire of around 500–650 rounds per minute (RPM) is significantly less than the Danish M/62&#x27;s 1,200 RPM, but it allows for better control, greater accuracy, more conservation of ammunition, more versatile firing positions, and less risk of collateral damage from losing control while shooting. The M60E6 features a redesigned quick-change barrel assembly with an offset barrel handle, which is also used to carry the weapon and allows for the replacement of a hot barrel without using protective gloves. Changes to the rail system and bipod have been made, and a significant number of internal improvements have also increased reliability.

==== Danish C79 LMG Optic ====
The Danish military uses a 3.4×28 optical sight mounted on top of the receiver which can be set from in increments on their M/60E6. What sets the Danish C79 LMG Optic designated as M/98 apart from the standard C79 optical sight is its unique reticle of a chevron with a height of 12,5 TS and two TS line left and right with a length of 7,5 TS beginning 2,5 TS away from the tip of the chevron. The sight is designated as M/99 also available in a night vision configuration.

===Civilian variants===
A number of semi-automatic only variants have been produced for the civilian market in the United States. The internals have been extensively modified to make it essentially impossible to convert them to fire in fully automatic. If the design is approved by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE), they are treated as belt-fed semi-automatic rifles; however, individual state and local regulations still apply.

The U.S. Ordnance company is the current maker authorized by Saco to produce mil-spec M60s and M60 parts. The company had charged $8,000 for a new semi-automatic M60.

The Desert Ordnance company is a current maker of M60s and M60 parts. The company charges between $13,000–$14,000 for a new semi-automatic M60, depending on the model.

There are a variety of M60 models, some that have been upgraded to the current M60E4 configuration, on the market as well, but they are heavily regulated and restricted by the National Firearms Act, and they cost over $40,000, with some models, such as a Maremont/SACO upgraded to M60E6 configuration costing as much as $65,000.

<text>The Black War was a period of violent conflict between British colonists and Aboriginal Tasmanians in Tasmania from the mid-1820s to 1832 that precipitated the near-extermination of the indigenous population. The conflict was fought largely as a guerrilla war by both sides; some 600 to 900 Aboriginal people and more than 200 British colonists died.

When a British penal settlement was established in Tasmania (then called Van Diemen&#x27;s Land) in 1803, the Aboriginal population was 3,000 to 7,000 people. Until the 1820s, the British and Aboriginal people coexisted with only sporadic violence, often caused by settlers kidnapping Aboriginal women and children. Conflict intensified from 1824, as Aboriginal warriors resisted the rapid expansion of British settlement over their land. In 1828, the British declared martial law and in 1830 they unsuccessfully attempted to force hostile Aboriginal nations from the settled districts in a military operation called &quot;the Black Line&quot;. In a series of &quot;Friendly Missions&quot; in 1830 and 1831, George Augustus Robinson and his Aboriginal negotiators secured the surrender of the Aboriginal belligerents. Martial law was revoked in January 1832.

Almost all of the remaining Aboriginal people were removed from mainland Tasmania from 1832 to 1835, and the 220 survivors were eventually relocated to the Wybalenna Aboriginal Mission on Flinders Island. Infectious diseases and a low birth rate cut the Aboriginal population at Wybalenna to 46 when the mission was closed in 1847.

The frequent mass killings and near-destruction of the Aboriginal Tasmanians are regarded by some contemporary historians as genocide by the colonists. Others, however, argue that the colonial authorities did not intend to destroy the Aboriginal population.

==Etymology==
The terms &quot;Black War&quot; and &quot;Black Line&quot; were coined by journalist Henry Melville in 1835. In the early 21st century, historian Lyndall Ryan has argued that the conflict should be known as the &quot;Tasmanian War&quot;. She has also called for a public memorial to be commissioned to honour the dead on both sides of the war.

== Early conflict ==
Although commercial sealing on Van Diemen&#x27;s Land had begun in late 1798, the first significant European presence on the island came in September 1803 with the establishment of a small British military outpost at Risdon Cove on the Derwent River near present-day Hobart.

The British had several hostile encounters with Aboriginal clans over the next five months, with shots fired and an Aboriginal boy abducted. David Collins arrived as the colony&#x27;s first lieutenant governor in February 1804 with instructions from London that any acts of violence against the Aboriginal people were to be punished. But he failed to publish those instructions, leaving an unclear legal framework for dealing with any violent conflict.

On 3 May 1804, soldiers, settlers and convicts from Risdon Cove fired on a hunting party of 100 to 300 Aboriginal people. The British commanding officer stated that he thought the Aboriginal group was hostile. Witnesses to the massacre stated that between three and 50 Aboriginal men, women and children had died. A boy whose parents were killed in the massacre was taken and given the name Robert Hobart May. This boy became the first Indigenous Tasmanian to have extended contact with the British colonial society.

By 1806, the British had founded two main penal settlements on the sites of modern Hobart and Launceston. Violence increased during a drought in 1806–7 as tribes in the south of the island killed or wounded several colonists in six incidents mostly sparked by competition for game. There were only three hostile encounters recorded in the northern settlements before 1819, although John Oxley stated in 1810 that convict bushrangers inflicted &quot;many atrocious cruelties&quot; on Aboriginal people which led to Aboriginal attacks on solitary white hunters.

The Tasmanian settlements grew slowly up to 1815, with the population reaching 1,933 people that year. Growth was mainly through the arrival of 600 colonists from Norfolk Island between 1805 and 1813, and 149 male convicts from England in 1812. Former convicts and the Norfolk Islander settlers were given small grants of land. By 1814, of land was under cultivation, with 5,000 cattle and 38,000 sheep. Conflict with Aboriginal people increased, mainly due to sporadic murders and colonists hunting game and kidnapping Aboriginal women and children for domestic work and sexual purposes.

Between 1815 and 1830, the colony expanded rapidly. The British population grew from 2,000 to 24,000, the number of sheep increased to 680,000 and cattle to 100,000. The settled districtsmainly in the midlands, eastern coast and northwestern region of the islandaccounted for almost 30 per cent of its land area. The expansion of the colony over Aboriginal hunting grounds led to increased conflict which, according to Nicholas Clements, developed into an Aboriginal resistance movement. Aboriginal attacks on colonists averaged 1.7 per year over the 18031823 period, but increased to 18 per year over 18241826.

Particularly from the late 1820s, the Aboriginal people were also driven by hunger to plunder settlers&#x27; homes for food as their hunting grounds shrank, native game disappeared, and the dangers of hunting on open ground grew.

Clements states that the main reasons for frontier violence against Aboriginal people were revenge, killing for sport, sexual desire for women and children, and suppression of the native threat. Male colonists outnumbered females six to one in 1822 and Clements argues that a &quot;voracious appetite&quot; for Aboriginal women was the most important immediate trigger for the Black War. However, after 1828 settler violence was mainly motivated by fear of Aboriginal attacks and a growing conviction among those on the frontier that extermination of the Aboriginal population was the only means by which peace could be secured.

== Crisis years (1825–1831) ==
From 1825 to 1828, the number of Aboriginal attacks on colonists and their property more than doubled each year. Clements states that although the colonists knew they were fighting a war, &quot;this was not a conventional war, and the enemy could not be combated by conventional means. The blacks were not one people, but rather a number of disparate tribes. They had no home base and no recognisable command structure.&quot;

George Arthur, governor of the colony since May 1824, had issued a proclamation on his arrival that placed Aboriginal people under the protection of British law and threatened prosecution for anyone who murdered them. Two Aboriginal men were hanged in September 1826 for the murder of three colonists and Arthur hoped that this would deter further attacks on colonists. But between September and November 1826 six more colonists were murdered, taking the number of colonists killed in the conflict to 36 since 1823. The &quot;Colonial Times&quot; newspaper advocated the removal of all Aboriginal people from the settled districts to an island in the Bass Strait, warning: &quot;if not, they will be hunted down like wild beasts, and destroyed!&quot;

On 29 November 1826, Arthur issued a notice authorising settlers to treat hostile Aboriginal groups as open enemies and to use arms to force them from the settled districts. He also deployed additional soldiers and police to these areas. The &quot;Colonial Times&quot; saw this as a declaration of war on Aboriginal people in the settled districts. Historian Lyndall Ryan argues that Arthur intended to force the surrender of the hostile Aboriginal tribes. Clements states that the November proclamation failed to clarify when it was legal for settlers to kill Aboriginal people.

Over the summer of 1826–27, warriors from the Big River, Oyster Bay and North Midlands nations killed a number of stock-keepers on farms. The colonists responded with reprisal raids, in which many Aboriginal people were killed. On 8 December 1826, a group led by Kickerterpoller threatened a farm overseer at Bank Hill farm at Orielton, near Richmond; the following day soldiers from the 40th Regiment killed 14 Oyster Bay people and captured another nine, including Kickerterpoller.

In April 1827, two shepherds were killed at a farm at Mount Augusta, south of Launceston, and a pursuit party launched a reprisal attack at dawn on an Aboriginal camp, killing up to 40 Aboriginal men, women and children. In May 1827, a group of Oyster Bay Aboriginal people killed a stock-keeper at Great Swanport near Swansea. A pursuit party of soldiers, police and civilians later attacked an Aboriginal camp killing at least six people.In June 1827, at least 80 to 100 members of the Pallittorre clan from the North nation were killed in reprisals for the killing of three stockmen. From December 1826 to July 1827, at least 140 Aboriginal people were killed, and Ryan suggests that the figure might be over 200 for their killing of 15 colonists.

In September 1827, Arthur appointed another 26 field police and deployed another 55 soldiers into the settled districts to deal with the rising conflict. Between September 1827 and the following March, at least 70 Aboriginal attacks were reported on the frontier, taking the lives of 20 colonists. By March 1828 the death toll in the settled districts for the 16 months since Arthur&#x27;s November 1826 official notice had risen to 43 colonists and up to 350 Aboriginal people.

Although Arthur received reports that Aboriginal people were more interested in plundering huts for food than in killing colonists, settlers also reported Aboriginal warriors shouting, &quot;Go away, go away!&quot;, burning crops and huts, and stating that they intended to kill every white man on the island. Clements states that much of the Aboriginal violence in the early stages of the war was targeted revenge for killings and abductions by the colonists, but that the arson and killing of livestock were clearly acts of resistance.

Arthur reported to the Colonial Office secretary in London that the Aboriginal people &quot;already complain that the white people have taken possession of their country, encroached upon their hunting grounds, and destroyed their natural food, the kangaroo&quot;. In January 1828, he proposed settling the Aboriginal people &quot;in some remote quarter of the island, which should be reserved strictly for them, and to supply them with food and clothing, and afford them protection ... on condition of their confining themselves peaceably to certain limits&quot;. His preferred location for the reserve was Tasmania&#x27;s north-east coast and he suggested they remain there &quot;until their habits shall become more civilised&quot;.

On 19 April 1828, Arthur issued a &quot;Proclamation Separating the Aborigines from the White Inhabitants&quot;. The proclamation aimed to remove Aboriginal Tasmanians from the settled districts of eastern, central and north-western Tasmania as a precursor to negotiations with them for a reserve in the north-east region which was largely uncolonised and was traditionally visited by many Aboriginal groups for its abundant native game and other foods. The proclamation authorised colonists to use violence to expel Aboriginal people from the settled districts in defined circumstances. However, the restrictions on violence were unclear and difficult to enforce and the settled districts were not well defined. Historian James Boyce states that in practice: &quot;Any Aborigine could now be legally killed for doing no more than crossing an unmarked border that the government did not even bother to define.&quot;

Arthur admitted that the British were &quot;the first aggressors&quot; but thought continued violence could only be prevented by enforcing the ban on Aboriginal people entering the settled areas. He deployed almost 300 troops from the 40th and 57th Regiments at 14 military posts along the frontier and within the settled districts. This measure appeared to deter Aboriginal attacks. Through the winter of 1828, few Aboriginal people appeared in the settled districts, and those that did were driven back by military parties. Among them were at least 16 Oyster Bay people who were killed in July at their encampment in the Eastern Tiers by a detachment of the 40th Regiment.

=== Martial law (November 1828) ===
Violence escalated from August to October 1828, with the Oyster Bay, Big River, Ben Lomond and Northern peoples launching raids on stock huts during which 15 colonists were killed in 39 attacks. From early October, Oyster Bay warriors also began killing white women and children. On 1 November, Arthur declared martial law against the Aboriginal people in the settled districts, who were now &quot;open enemies of the King&quot;. Arthur&#x27;s move was effectively a declaration of war. Soldiers were authorised to arrest any Aboriginal person in the settled districts without warrant and to shoot those who resisted. However, the proclamation also stated: Martial law would remain in force for more than three years, the longest period in Australian history. Although the proclamation authorised only the military to shoot Aboriginal people in the settled districts on sight, in practice other colonists did so with impunity. Only one colonist was ever prosecuted for killing an Aboriginal person.

About 500 Aboriginal people from five clan groups were still operating in the settled districts when martial law was declared and Arthur&#x27;s first action was to encourage civilian parties to capture them. On 7 November, a party operating from Richmond captured Umarrah — a leader of the North Midlands nation — and four others including his wife and a child. Umarrah remained defiant and was jailed for over a year.

Arthur established military patrols from the 39th, 40th and 63rd Regiments that scoured the settled districts for Aboriginal people, whom they should capture or shoot. By March 1829, about 400 troops were deployed in the settled districts and about 200 soldiers patrolled the area in 23 parties of eight to 10 men. Patrols usually included convict police who were familiar with the area and sometimes included Aboriginal guides from outside the settled areas. Settlers also formed patrols whose official role was to capture Aboriginal people.

The main tactic of the military and settler patrols was to execute dawn raids on Aboriginal camps and there are many reported massacres of six or more Aboriginal people in these raids. The patrols reportedly killed 60 Aboriginal people and captured from 20 to 30 in the two years from November 1828. Ryan, however, estimates the Aboriginal death toll was at least 200 by March 1830.

In the first six months of 1829, the Oyster Bay people killed eight convict workers in the Pitt Water district. This was followed by a lull in fighting before a wave of attacks in the spring and summer. Overall, 33 colonists were kill in 1829 compared with 27 the previous year.

In mid-1829 Arthur estimated that there were 2,000 Aboriginal people in the colony. Other estimates by the colonists ranged from 500 to 5,000. Settlers reported that the Oyster Bay people were moving in considerably smaller groups, but sightings of the Big River people in groups of 100 or more continued. It is likely that the massacres, privation and a falling birth rate had reduced the Aboriginal population to under 1,000 and that less than 300 remained in southeastern Tasmania.

Arthur also pursued conciliation. In March 1829, he established an Aboriginal mission on Bruny Island in the hope it would attract Aboriginal people from the settled districts. He also commissioned &quot;proclamation boards&quot; with drawings meant to show Aboriginal people the benefits of living peacefully with the colonists under an ideal British justice in which whites would be hanged for killing blacks and blacks hanged for killing whites.

Violence, however, did not abate. There were 60 Aboriginal attacks on colonists from November 1829 to March 1830, most of them in the Clyde, Oatlands and Richmond police districts. Settlers reported arson attacks on buildings and crops which threatened the viability of their farms. In late 1829, one police magistrate informed Arthur that he needed three times his allocation of soldiers to protect local settlers. In February 1830, settlers and the press launched a campaign for increased military protection on the frontier and the removal of hostile tribes to the Bass Strait islands.

The predominant mood among colonists on the frontier was fear and panic mixed with anger and a desire for revenge. Although by the end of 1829 the number of Aboriginal people in the war zone had greatly diminished, this was not widely known and the threat that the remaining hostile Aboriginal groups posed to frontier farms was real.

in November 1829, Arthur established an Aborigines Committee to inquire into the causes of the Aboriginal violence and make policy recommendations. The following February, he introduced a bounty of £5 for every captured Aboriginal adult and £2 for each child. He also sought the help of other colonies in increasing the military presence in Van Diemen&#x27;s Land but without success.

=== The Aborigines Committee ===
In March 1830, Arthur appointed Anglican Archdeacon William Broughton as chairman of the seven-man Aborigines Committee inquiring into the conflict. Since the declaration of martial law in November 1828 there had been 120 Aboriginal attacks on colonists, resulting in about 50 colonists dead and over 60 wounded. The inquiry was conducted in the context of a further escalation in hostilities: in February there were 30 separate incidents in which seven Europeans were killed.

Among submissions it received were suggestions to set up decoy huts containing poisoned flour and sugar, that Aboriginal people be rooted out with bloodhounds and that Māori warriors be brought to Tasmania to capture the Aboriginal people for removal to New Zealand as slaves. Settlers and soldiers gave evidence of killings and atrocities on both sides, but the committee was also told that despite the attacks, some settlers believed very few Aboriginal people now remained in the settled districts.

In its report, published in March 1830, the committee stated that the Aboriginal people had lost their sense of superiority of white men, no longer feared British guns, and were now on a systematic plan of attacking the colonists and their possessions. The committee&#x27;s report supported the bounty system, recommended more mounted police, and urged settlers to remain well armed and alert.

Arthur forwarded their report to Secretary of State for War and the Colonies Sir George Murray, blaming convicts for mistreating the Aboriginal people but adding, &quot;it is increasingly apparent the Aboriginal natives of this colony are, and have ever been, a most treacherous race; and that the kindness and humanity which they have always experienced from the free settlers has not tended to civilize them to any degree.&quot; Murray stated in response that the Aboriginal people could become extinct in the near future and that any British conduct with that aim would &quot;leave an indelible stain upon the character of the British Government.&quot;

Arthur accepted most of the committee&#x27;s recommendations but only deployed a small number of additional mounted police due to the expense and a shortage of horses in the colony. He also advised London that an increase in the convict population in remote frontier areas would help protect settlers and asked that all convict transport ships be diverted to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land.

The war continued. In April, the military and colonists killed at least 12 Big River and Pallittorre people in separate encounters. From April to early August, there were 22 Aboriginal attacks in the Clyde district in which three colonists were killed and nine wounded. Arthur, however, had heard that two of his emissaries, George Augustus Robinson and Captain Welsh, had established friendly contacts with Aboriginal groups outside the settled districts. On 19 August, he issued a notice informing settlers of this success and advising them not to harm or capture any non-hostile Aboriginal person in search of food. He also warned settlers that the bounty would not be paid to colonists who captured friendly Aboriginal people and that anyone killing them would be prosecuted.

Following the killing of a prominent settler on 22 August, a group of settlers wrote to Arthur protesting against his change in policy. The Aborigines Committee and Executive Council also advised him that stronger measures were required to subdue the hostile Oyster Bay and Big River nations. In response, Arthur extended martial law to the whole of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land on 1 October. He also ordered every able-bodied male colonist to assemble on 7 October at one of seven designated places to join a massive drive to sweep the hostile Aboriginal people from the settled districts in a military campaign which became known as the Black Line. The news was greeted enthusiastically by the colonist press. The &quot;Hobart Town Courier&quot; said that it doubted settlers would need persuading &quot;to accomplish the one grand and glorious object now before them&quot;.

=== Northwestern conflict ===
The Aboriginal people of northwestern Tasmania had sporadic and sometimes violent encounters with the British before the region was colonised in 1826. The colonists were servants of the Van Diemen&#x27;s Land Company which had been granted land for grazing sheep and cattle. An escalating cycle of violence broke out in 1827 after company shepherds killed an Aboriginal man and abducted Aboriginal women for sex. A shepherd was speared and more than 100 sheep killed in retribution, and colonists responded with a dawn attack on an Aboriginal campsite, killing 12. The conflict led to the Cape Grim massacre of 10 February 1828 in which shepherds armed with muskets ambushed up to 30 Aboriginal people as they collected shellfish at the foot of a cliff.

On 21 August 1829, four company servants killed an Aboriginal woman at Emu Bay, near present-day Burnie. An investigation was launched but no one was prosecuted. Three company men were fatally speared in July and October 1831 and there were heavy losses inflicted on sheep and oxen. There were 16 recorded acts of violence against Aboriginal people in the conflict, but the number of Aboriginal deaths is unknown. Company employees stated that they believed killing Aboriginal people was justified to protect livestock.

The population of the northwestern clans fell from an estimated 400-700 at the time of colonisation to about 100 by 1835. The population of the neighbouring northern Aboriginal people fell from 400 in 1826 to fewer than 60 by mid-1830. Violence in the northwest ceased in 1834 but resumed between September 1839 and February 1842 when Aboriginal people made at least 18 attacks on company men and property.

=== Military strategy and tactics ===
Aboriginal warriors conducted a guerrilla war against the British. They mostly used three weapons: spears, rocks and waddies. They almost always attacked during the day in war parties of 10 to 20 men. Although they favoured ambushes and hit-and-run raids against isolated shepherds and settler huts, sieges of huts for up to a day were not uncommon. Warriors often lit fires or used women to lure colonists out of their huts and into an ambush. They quickly learned that muskets could only be fired about once every 30 seconds, so they often encouraged colonists to fire then closed in for an attack. War parties would sometimes divide into separate diversionary and main attack groups and then disperse after an attack to make pursuit more difficult. Attacks on livestock and arson of buildings and crops were also common but were not used systematically as a major war strategy.

The main British military response involved official pursuit parties and roving parties. Pursuit parties mostly consisted of soldiers and convicts whose task was to track down Aboriginal groups presumed to be responsible for a particular attack. They were usually in the field for 12 to 48 hours. Roving parties were groups of soldiers, convicts and authorised civilians who patrolled the frontier for 12 to 18 days at a time with the aim of dispersing hostile Aboriginal groups. The main tactic of the official parties was to attack at night after campfires had revealed the position of the Aboriginal groups. Although their instructions were to capture hostile Aboriginal people where possible, in practice a successful ambush of a campsite almost always led to lethal violence. The main weapons used in ambushes were the Brown Bess musket, bayonets and clubs.

Vigilante groups mainly consisted of convicts but settlers and their employees were often involved. They generally used the same weapons and tactics as the official parties but probably inflicted more deaths on Aboriginal groups.

== Black Line, October–November 1830 ==
The Black Line of October to November 1830 consisted of 2,200 men: about 550 soldiers, 738 convict servants and 912 civilians. Arthur, who maintained overall control, placed Major Sholto Douglas of the 63rd Regiment in command of the forces. Separated into three divisions and aided by Aboriginal guides, they formed a staggered front more than 300 km long that began pushing south and east across the Settled Districts from 7 October. The intention was to form a pincer movement to push members of four of the nine Aboriginal nations across the Forestier Peninsula to East Bay Neck and into the Tasman Peninsula, which Arthur intended to declare an Aboriginal reserve.

The campaign was hampered by severe weather, difficult terrain, inadequate maps and poor supply lines. Although two of the divisions met in mid-October, the difficult terrain soon resulted in the cordon being broken, leaving many wide gaps through which the Aboriginal people were able to easily pass. Many of the colonists, by then barefoot and their clothes tattered, deserted the line and returned home. The campaign&#x27;s single success was a dawn ambush on 25 October in which two Aboriginal people were captured and two killed. The Black Line was disbanded on 26 November.

When the Black Line commenced, about 300 members of the hostile Big River, Oyster Bay, Ben Lomond and North Midlands nations were still alive and about 100 to 200 of these were within the line&#x27;s field of operations. They launched at least 50 attacks on colonists—both in front of and behind the line—during the campaign, often plundering huts for food.

== Surrender and removal ==
=== Surrender in the settled districts ===
Following the Black Line campaign, there were probably only about 100 hostile Aboriginal people in the settled districts, although the colonists believed the figure was at least 500. Hopes of peace rose over the summer of 1830-31 as Aboriginal attacks fell to a low level. The &quot;Colonial Times&quot; newspaper speculated that their enemy had either been wiped out or frightened into inaction. However, there was a new wave of attacks in late January and March in which several colonists were killed, and many men on the frontier refused to go out to work.

In February 1831, the Aborigines Committee issued a report recommending that settlers should remain vigilant and that parties of armed men should be stationed in the most remote stock huts. In response, up to 150 stock huts were turned into ambush locations, military posts were established on native migratory routes and new barracks were built at Spring Bay, Richmond and Break O&#x27;Day Plains. There was an increased military presence at farms, and military parties of 50 to 90 men sometimes went out in pursuit of hostile Aboriginal groups.

The committee, however, also endorsed the government&#x27;s attempts to conciliate the hostile Aboriginal clans. In March 1829, George Augustus Robinson had been appointed the head of the Aboriginal Mission on Bruny Island where about 20 survivors of the southeastern Aboriginal people were accommodated. From January to September 1830, Robinson and 19 Aboriginal negotiators had carried out a &quot;Friendly Mission&quot; to establish contacts with the Aboriginal clans of southwestern, western and northwestern Tasmania. In October that year, he reported to Arthur that his mission had been a partial success and the governor authorised him to seek conciliation with the northeastern clans.

By January 1831, Robinson&#x27;s party had contacted more than fifty Aboriginal people and had moved them temporarily to Swan Island in Bass Strait. Those moved to the island included the resistance leader Mannalargenna, whose group had killed a number of colonists. In February, Arthur appointed Robinson to head an Aboriginal Establishment on the Furneaux Islands and authorised him to negotiate the surrender of the remaining Big River and Oyster Bay people. In March, the 53 Aboriginal Tasmanians under Robinson&#x27;s care were transferred to a settlement on Gun Carriage Island (now Vansittart Island).

In June, Robinson and a party of Aboriginal negotiators set off to locate a resistance group led by Umarrah which had conducted a series of raids killing several colonists. The public mood, however, swung further against Arthur&#x27;s conciliatory approach after an Aboriginal group led by Montpelliatta conducted further raids in the Great Western Tiers culminating in the death of two prominent settlers in August. The &quot;Launceston Advertiser&quot; declared that only &quot;utter annihilation&quot; could subdue the Aboriginal people.

Several weeks later, an Aboriginal group robbed huts at Great Swansea and, in late October, 100 armed settlers formed a cordon across the narrow part of Freycinet Peninsula in an attempt to capture several dozen Aboriginal people who had entered the peninsula. The cordon was abandoned four days later after the Aboriginal people slipped through and escaped at night.

Robinson&#x27;s efforts at conciliation were more successful. In September, he and Mannalargenna persuaded Umarrah and his group to suspend hostilities. The following month, Robinson and Mannalargenna met Arthur to discuss the terms of a surrender. Robinson, Mannalargenna and Umarrah then set off for the interior to locate and negotiate with the remaining hostile Big River and Oyster Bay groups. On 31 December, they made contact with a party of 26 Big River and Oyster Bay people led by Montpelliatta and Tongerlongeter. Umarrah&#x27;s wife, Woolaytopinnyer, persuaded them to surrender.

Robinson led the 26 Aboriginal people to Hobart where they surrendered to governor Arthur on 7 January 1832. Ten days later, the groups led by Montpelliatta, Tongerlongeter and Umarrah were sent to Flinders island where the Aboriginal Establishment had been relocated the previous November.

The December surrender effectively ended the Black War, and martial law was revoked in January 1832. There had been 70 Aboriginal attacks on colonists in 1831, in which 33 colonists were killed or wounded. But the number of attacks had been well below the 250 recorded in 1830, and it was now clear that the remnants of the hostile Aboriginal clans had been exhausted, hungry and desperate throughout 1831.

There were no further reports of Aboriginal attacks in the eastern settled districts from December 1831, although isolated acts of violence continued in the north until 1834 and in the northwest until 1842. The death toll from 1832 to 1834 was ten colonists and 40 Aboriginal people.

=== Removal of western Aboriginal nations ===
Arthur authorised Robinson to negotiate the surrender of the remaining southwestern and western Aboriginal clans and their removal to Flinders Island, believing that this would be the only way of saving them from extermination at the hands of settlers while providing them with the benefits of British civilisation and Christianity. In February 1832, Robinson and his Aboriginal negotiators embarked on the first of several expeditions to the west and north-west of Tasmania. His party persuaded several small groups to seek refuge on Flinders Island, warning them that they faced violent hostility without protection.

However, after a hostile encounter with a group of 29 Tarkiner people at Arthur River in September, Robinson resolved to use force if necessary to secure the removal of the remaining Aboriginal people. Hunter Island, at Tasmania&#x27;s northwestern tip, and penal stations in Macquarie Harbour, on the western coast, were used to hold captured Aboriginal people until their transfer to Flinders Island, but many succumbed quickly to disease and the mortality rate reached 75 percent.

=== Aftermath ===
By early 1835 almost 300 people had surrendered to Robinson, who reported to the colonial secretary that the entire Aboriginal population had been removed to Flinders Island. However, a family was discovered near Cradle Mountain in 1836 and they eventually surrendered in 1842. Aboriginal women also continued to live with sealers on the Bass Strait islands and small Aboriginal groups remained in the Great Western Tiers.

In February 1833, the Aboriginal Establishment was moved to a more suitable location on Flinders Island and renamed Wybalenna. Children attended school, men were expected to work in the garden, build roads, erect fences and shear sheep, while women were required to cook, wash clothes, sew and attend evening school. All were expected to attend Scripture classes and wear European clothes and many were given European names. However, convicts were assigned to do most of the labour and the Aboriginal people were free to roam the island where they hunted and gathered food and performed traditional ceremonies. Despite the presence of a resident doctor, a high rate of respiratory disease cut the population from about 220 in 1833 to 46 in 1847.

== Population and death toll ==

=== Deaths ===

Historians acknowledge that recorded killings in the Black War are minimum figures because most killings of Aboriginal people went unreported. Nevertheless, Clements concludes that even if only reported deaths are considered, annual deaths per head of population were over 600 per 10,000, making the Black War one of the deadliest in history.

Ryan, based on a contemporary newspaper estimate, states that there were 1,200 Aboriginal people in the settled districts in 1826. She estimates that 838 Aboriginal people were killed in eastern Tasmania from November 1823 to January 1832 and that 40 more were killed in the following period to August 1834.

Clements states that the recorded Aboriginal death toll in the conflict was 260. He estimates, however, that only 100 Aboriginal people survived the eastern conflict from a pre-war population of 1,000, and he therefore concludes that 900 died from 1824 to 1831. He surmises that about one-third may have died through internecine conflict, disease and natural deaths, leaving an estimated 600 deaths from frontier violence. However, he states: &quot;The true figure might be as low as 400 or as high as 1,000.&quot; Johnson and McFarlane argue that at least 400 Aboriginal deaths in the northwestern conflict should be added to this figure, giving over 1,000 Aboriginal deaths in the conflict across Tasmania.

Ryan states that there were 191 recorded deaths of colonists in the conflict from November 1823 to January 1834, and another 10 deaths after this. Clements, who studied a wider range of sources, states that there were 450 casualties among colonists, including 219 recorded deaths, in the eastern conflict from 1824 to 1831. However, the number killed or wounded was probably under-reported due to administrative inefficiency and because the colonists did not want to discourage British investment in, and emigration to, the colony.

=== Aboriginal population decline ===
Estimates of Tasmania&#x27;s Aboriginal population in 1803, the year of British settlement, range from 3,000 to 7,000. Lydall Ryan, citing studies by N.J.B Plomley, Rhys Jones, Colin Pardoe and Harry Lourandos, reaches a figure of 7,000 spread throughout the island&#x27;s nine nations. Nicholas Clements, however, also citing Plomley, Jones and others, estimates the population at 3,000 to 4,000. Johnson and McFarlane state that the consensus figure is 4,500 to 5,000.

Historians also disagree over the extent and causes of Aboriginal population decline before the Black War. Ryan argues that the population of some clans near the two main British settlements probably declined from 1803 to 1807 due to settler violence, although other clans possibly prospered from the introduction of hunting dogs. She states that by 1819 the Aboriginal and British population reached parity with about 5,000 of each, although among the colonists men outnumbered women four to one. At that stage both population groups enjoyed good health, with infectious diseases not taking hold until the late 1820s. She therefore concludes that settler violence was the main cause of Aboriginal population decline before the Black War.

Clements, however, believes that frontier violence does not explain population decline in the first 20 years of British settlement as there were few colonists in the interior. He argues that reduced fertility caused by venereal diseases was probably a significant cause of early population decline. He also states that although the health of the Aboriginal population was generally good, at least one southern Aboriginal clan was decimated by other introduced diseases before the Black War.

Boyce also argues that the impact of violence and disease on the Aboriginal population was moderate up to 1816 and that there is no evidence of low numbers of children and elderly people nor critically low numbers of women. Johnson and McFarlane, however, argue that kidnapping of Aboriginal women by sealers was a key factor in the population decline of Aboriginal clans in the northern and southern coastal regions.

== Historiography ==

=== Conflict and depopulation ===
Writing in 2002, Keith Windschuttle argued that the Aboriginal population in 1803 was only about 2,000, that only 118 Aboriginal people were killed in the conflict with British settlers, and that the conflict was an outbreak of criminality rather than a war. His arguments have been challenged by numerous authors including James Boyce, Henry Reynolds, Lyndall Ryan and Nicholas Clements who conclude that the conflict was an Aboriginal war of liberation in which 600 to 900 Aboriginal Tasmanians were killed.

Geoffrey Blainey and Josephine Flood argue that although Aboriginal deaths in the conflict were devastating, the major cause of Aboriginal depopulation was disease. Ryan and Boyce, however, argue that the Aboriginal death rate from disease was low before 1820 and that Aboriginal Tasmanians were more likely to die from disease after they had surrendered to the British.

=== Academic discussion of genocide ===

The near-destruction of Tasmania&#x27;s Aboriginal population has been described as an act of genocide by historians and genocide scholars including Robert Hughes, James Boyce, Lyndall Ryan, Tom Lawson, Mohamed Adhikari, Benjamin Madley, Ashley Riley Sousa, Rebe Taylor, and Tony Barta. The author of the concept of genocide, Raphael Lemkin, considered Tasmania the site of one of the world&#x27;s clear cases of genocide and Hughes has described the loss of Aboriginal Tasmanians as &quot;the only true genocide in English colonial history&quot;. However, other historiansincluding Henry Reynolds, Richard Broome, and Nicholas Clementsdo not agree that the colonial authorities pursued a policy of destroying the Indigenous population, although they do acknowledge that some settlers supported extermination.

Boyce has claimed that the April 1828 &quot;Proclamation Separating the Aborigines from the White Inhabitants&quot; sanctioned force against Aboriginal people &quot;for no other reason than that they were Aboriginal&quot;. However, as Reynolds, Broome and Clements point out, there was open warfare at the time. Boyce describes the decision to remove all Aboriginal Tasmanians after 1832—by which time they had given up their fight against white colonists—as an extreme policy position. He concludes: &quot;The colonial government from 1832 to 1838 ethnically cleansed the western half of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land and then callously left the exiled people to their fate.&quot;

As early as 1852 John West&#x27;s &quot;History of Tasmania&quot; portrayed the obliteration of Tasmania&#x27;s Aboriginal people as an example of &quot;systematic massacre&quot; and in the 1979 High Court case of Coe v Commonwealth of Australia, judge Lionel Murphy observed that Aboriginal people did not give up their land peacefully and that they were killed or forcibly removed from their land &quot;in what amounted to attempted (and in Tasmania almost complete) genocide&quot;.

Historian Henry Reynolds says that there was a widespread call from settlers during the frontier wars for the &quot;extirpation&quot; or &quot;extermination&quot; of the Aboriginal people. But he has contended that the British government acted as a source of restraint on settlers&#x27; actions. Reynolds says there is no evidence the British government deliberately planned the wholesale destruction of indigenous Tasmanians—a November 1830 letter to Arthur by Sir George Murray warned that the extinction of the race would leave &quot;an indelible stain upon the character of the British Government&quot;—and therefore what eventuated does not meet the definition of genocide codified in the 1948 United Nations convention. He says that Arthur was determined to defeat the Aboriginal people and take their land, but believes that there is little evidence that he had aims beyond that objective and wished to destroy the Tasmanian race. In contrast to Reynolds&#x27; argument, historian Lyndall Ryan, based on a sample of massacres taking place in the Meander River region in June 1827, concludes that massacres of Aboriginal Tasmanians by white settlers were likely part of an organised process and were sanctioned by government authorities.

Clements accepts Reynolds&#x27; argument but also exonerates the colonists themselves of the charge of genocide. He says that, unlike genocidal determinations by Nazis against Jews in World War II, Hutus against Tutsis in Rwanda and Ottomans against Armenians in present-day Turkey which were carried out for ideological reasons, Tasmanian settlers participated in violence largely out of revenge and self-preservation. He adds: &quot;Even those who were motivated by sex or morbid thrillseeking lacked any ideological impetus to exterminate the natives.&quot; He also argues that while genocides are inflicted on defeated, captive or otherwise vulnerable minorities, Tasmanian natives appeared as a &quot;capable and terrifying enemy&quot; to colonists and were killed in the context of a war in which both sides killed noncombatants.

Lawson, in a critique of Reynolds&#x27; stand, argues that genocide was the inevitable outcome of a set of British policies to colonise Van Diemen&#x27;s Land. He says that the British government endorsed the use of partitioning and &quot;absolute force&quot; against Tasmanians, approved Robinson&#x27;s &quot;Friendly Mission&quot; and colluded in transforming that mission into a campaign of ethnic cleansing from 1832. He says that once on Flinders Island, the indigenous peoples were taught to both farm land like Europeans and worship God like Europeans and concludes: &quot;The campaign of transformation enacted on Flinders Island amounted to cultural genocide.&quot;

Writing in 2023, historian Rebe Taylor points to the arguments of Windschuttle as being a minority opinion among historians who generally accept the Black War as a case of genocide.

<text>A resident minister, or resident for short, is a government official required to take up permanent residence in another country. A representative of his government, he officially has diplomatic functions which are often seen as a form of indirect rule.

A resident usually heads an administrative area called a residency. &quot;Resident&quot; may also refer to resident spy, the chief of an espionage operations base.

==Resident ministers==
This full style occurred commonly as a diplomatic rank for the head of a mission ranking just below envoy, usually reflecting the relatively low status of the states of origin and/or residency or else difficult relations.

On occasion, the resident minister&#x27;s role could become extremely important, as when in 1806 the Bourbon king Ferdinand IV fled his Kingdom of Naples, and Lord William Bentinck, the British Resident, authored (1812) a new and relatively liberal constitution.

Residents could also be posted to nations that had significant foreign influence. For instance, the British sent residents to the Mameluk Beys who ruled Baghdad province as an autonomous state (17041831) in the north of present-day Iraq, until the Ottoman sultans reasserted control over it (1831) and its Wali (governor). After the Congress of Vienna restored the Grand Duchy of Tuscany in 1815, the British posted a resident to Florence to handle their affairs there.

As international relations developed, it became customary to give the highest title of diplomatic rank – ambassador – to the head of all permanent missions in any country, except as a temporary expression of down-graded relations or where representation was merely an interim arrangement.

==Pseudo-colonial residents==
Some official representatives of European colonial powers, while in theory diplomats, in practice exercised a degree of indirect control. Some such residents were former military officers, rather than career diplomats, who resided in smaller self-governing protectorates and tributary states and acted as political advisors to the ruler. A trusted resident could even become the &quot;de facto&quot; prime minister to a native ruler. In other respects, they acted as an ambassador of the government of the country they were posted to, but at a lower level, since they were protectorates or tributaries of Western nations. Instead of being a representative to a single ruler, a resident could be posted to more than one native state, or to a grouping of states which the European power decided for its convenience. This could create an artificial geographical unit, as in Residency X in some parts of the Indian Empire. Similar positions could carry alternative titles, such as political agent and resident commissioner.

In some cases, the intertwining of the European power with the traditional native establishment went so far that members of the native princely houses became residents, either in other states or even within their state, provided that they were unlikely ever to succeed as rulers of the state. A resident&#x27;s real role varied enormously, depending upon the underlying relationship between the two parties and even upon the personalities of the Resident and the ruler. Some residents were little more than observers and diplomats, others were seen as unwanted interlopers and were treated with hostility, while some won enough trust from the ruler that they were able to exercise great influence. In French protectorates, such as those of Morocco and Tunisia, the resident or resident general was the effective ruler of the territory. In 1887, when both Boers and gold prospectors of all nationalities were overrunning his country, the Swazi paramount chief Umbandine asked for a British resident, seeing this as a desirable and effective form of protection. His request was refused.

===British and dominion residents===
The residents of the governments of the United Kingdom and the dominions to a variety of protectorates include:

* In the Sultanate of Zanzibar, the second &#x27;homeland&#x27; of the Omani dynasty, since 1913. From 1913 to 1961 the Residents were also the Sultan&#x27;s vizier. There were Consuls and Consuls-general until 1963.
* In present-day Kenya, in the Sultanate of Witu, after the British took over the protectorate from the German Empire, which had itself posted a Resident.
* In British Cameroon (part of the former German Kamerun), since 1916, in 1949 restyled Special Resident (superior to the new two provinces) for Edward John Gibbons (b. 1906 – d. 1990), who stayed on in October 1954 as the first Commissioner when it became an autonomous part of Nigeria.
* in Southern Africa:
** when the military party sent from Cape Colony to occupy Port Natal on behalf of Great Britain was recalled in 1839, a British Resident was appointed among the Fingo and other tribes in Kaffraria until the definite establishment of British rule in Natal and its 1845 organization as an administrative entity, when the incumbent Shepstone was made Agent for the native tribes.
** In KwaZulu, which since 1843 was under a British protectorate, after it became the Zulu &quot;Native&quot; Reserve or Zululand Province on 1 September 1879: two British Residents (William Douglas Wheelwright, 8 September 1879 to January 1880, then Sir Melmoth Osborn until 22 December 1882). Thereafter there were Resident Commissioners until Zululand was incorporated into the crown colony of Natal as British Zululand on 1 December 1897.
** in 1845 the resident &#x27;north of the Orange River chose his residency at Bloemfontein, which became the capital of the Orange River Sovereignty in 1848. In 1854 the British abandoned the Sovereignty, and the independent Boer republic of the Orange Free State was established
** in the Boer Republic of Transvaal at Pretoria
** with the Matabele chief at Bulawayo
* in Ghana, with the rulers of the Asanteman Confederation (established in 1701), since it became 1896 a British protectorate; on 23 June 1900 the Confederation was dissolved by UK protectorate authority, and on 26 September 1901 turned into Ashanti Colony, so since 1902 his place was taken by a Chief Commissioner at Kumasi
* in various parts of the Northern Nigeria Protectorate, and Southern Nigeria Protectorate and after their joining Nigeria protectorate, notably in Edo state at Benin City (first to the British-installed ruling council of chiefs, later to the restored Oba), with the Emir of and in Bauchi, to the jointly ruling bale and Balogun of Ibadan (a vassal state in Yorubaland), with the Emir of Illorin, with the Emir of and in Muri (Nigeria), with the Emir of Nupe

====Residents in Asia====


British residents were posted in various princely states – in major states or groups of states—in the days of British India. Often they were appointed to a single state, as with the Resident in Lucknow, the capital of Oudh; to the Maharaja Gaekwad of Baroda; to the Maharaja Sindhia of Gwalior; to the Nizam al-Mulk of Hyderabad; to the Maharaja of Jhalawar; to the restored Maharaja of Mysore, after the fall of Tipu Sultan; to the Maharaja Sena Sahib Subah of the Mahratta state of Nagpur; to the (Maha)Raja of Manipur; to the (Maha)Raja of Travancore; to the Maharana of Mewar in Udaipur.
Even when Lord Lake had broken the Maratha power in 1803, and the Mughal emperor was taken under the protection of the East India Company, the districts of Delhi and Hisar were assigned for the maintenance of the royal family, and were administered by a British Resident, until in 1832 the whole area was annexed to 
British Residents were also posted in major states considered to be connected with India, neighbouring or on the sea route to it, notably:
* in Aden (while subordinated to the Bombay Presidency), the only part of present-day Yemen made a colony in full British possession. The last of three British Political Agents since 1939 stayed on as first Resident since 1859, the last again staying on in 1932 as first Chief Commissioner; he was the only diplomatic representative to the various Arabian rulers who over time accepted British protectorate, but since the 1935 legal separation from British India was followed in 1937 by a reorganisation into an Eastern and a Western Aden Protectorate (based at Mukallah and Lahej; together covering all Yemen), the British Representatives in each were styled British Political officers
* in Afghanistan, a kingdom entitled to a gun salute of 21 guns (the highest rank among princely states, not then among Sovereign monarchs): the first British Residents were Sir Alexander Burnes (1837 – 2 November 1841); William Hay McNaghten (7 August 1839 – 23 December 1841); Eldred Pottinger (December 1841 – 6 January 1842). After that, four native &quot;Vakil&quot;s acted on behalf of the British government: Nawab Foujdar Khan (1856 – April 1859), Ghulam Husain Khan Allizai (April 1859 – 1865), Bukhiar Khan (February 1864 – January 1868, acting), Attah Muhammad Khan Khagwani (January 1868 – 1878); then there were two more British Residents Louis Napoleon Cavagnari (24 July 1879 – 3 September 1879), Henry Lepel-Griffin (1880); next came two Military Commanders (8 October 1879 – 11 August 1880) and until 1919 ten native British Agents, one of whom served two non-consecutive terms.
* Capt. Hiram Cox (died 1799) was the first British Resident to the King of independent Burma (October 1796 – July 1797), and there were more discontinuous postings to that court, in the 19th century, never satisfactory to either party; after the Third Anglo-Burmese War there were two separate British Residents in a border zone of that country: in the Northern Shan States and the Southern Shan States (each several tribal states, usually ruled by a Saopha=Sawbwa) in 1945–1948 (each group had been under a Superintendent from 1887/88 till 1922, then both jointly under a Resident Commissioner till the 1942 Japanese occupation)
* after five military governors since the East India Company started chasing the Dutch out of Ceylon in August 1795 and occupying the island (completed on 16 February 1796), their only Resident there was Robert Andrews, 12 February 1796 – 12 October 1798, who was subordinate to the presidency of Madras (see British India), afterward the HEIC appointed Governors as it was made a separate colony
* to the Sultan of the Maldives archipelago since he formally accepted British protection on 16 December 1887 (informally since 1796, after the British took over Ceylon from the Dutch), but this office was filled &quot;ex officio&quot; by the colonial Governors until 4 February 1948, abolished on 26 July 1965
* in Nepal since 1802, accredited to the Hindu kings (title Maharajadhiraja), since 15 March 1816 exercising a de facto protectorate—the last staying on 1920 as Envoy till the 1923 emancipation
* with the Imam/Sultan of Oman, 1800–1804, 1805–1810, and 1840 (so twice interrupted by vacancy), then located with the African branch of the dynasty on the island of Unguja, since 1862 his role was handed over to a Political Agent

And elsewhere:
* in Transjordan (present Jordan) from April 1921 – 17 June 1946 four incumbents accredited to the Hashemite Emir/King

Even in overseas territories occupied (&#x27;preventively&#x27; or conquered) to keep the French out of strategic trade and waters, residencies could be established, e.g. at Laye on Sumatra, an island returned to the Dutch East Indies

====Residents in (British) European protectorates====
Since on 5 November 1815, the United States of the Ionian Islands became a federal republic of seven islands (Corfu, Cephalonia, Zante, Santa Maura, Ithaca, Cerigo, and Paxos), as a protectorate (nominally of the allied Powers; de facto UK protectorate; the highest office was the always-British Lord High Commissioner), until its 1 June 1864 incorporation into independent Greece, there were British residents, each posted with a local Prefect, on seven individual islands, notably: Cephalonia (Kephalonia), Cerigo (Kythira), Ithaca, Paxos, Santa Maura (Leucada/Lefkada) and Zante (Zakynthos)

====Residents on (British and dominion) ocean island states====

* in the period before British sovereignty was declared over New Zealand and a lieutenant-governor was appointed, James Busby from 10 May 1833 till 28 January 1840. 
* at Rarotonga since the 1888 establishment of the British protectorate over the Cook Islands; the third and last incumbent stayed on as first Resident Commissioner since 1901, at the incorporation in the British Western Pacific Territories (under a single High Commissioner, till its 1976 dissolution, in Suva or Honiara), until the abolition of the post at the 1965 self-government grant as a territory in free association with New Zealand, having its cabinet (still under the British Crown, which after 1976 appoints a special King&#x27;s/Queen&#x27;s Representative, as well as a High Commissioner).

====Residents in protectorates of decolonised Commonwealth states====
* Sikkim, where the Maharaja had been under a British protectorate (1861 – 15 August 1947; the crown representative was styled Political Agent), became immediately afterward a protectorate of newly independent India (formally from 5 December 1950; in the meantime, the Indian representative was again styled Political Agent, the first incumbent being the former British Political Agent—India was a dominion, still under the British crown, till 26 January 1950) until 16 May 1975, it was annexed as a constituent state of India.

===Dutch colonial residents===

In the Dutch East Indies, Dutch residents and lower ranks such as assistant residents were posted alongside a number of the many native princes in present Indonesia, compared to Regentschap.

For example, in Sumatra, there were Dutch residents at Palembang, at Medan in Deli sultanate; another was posted with the Sultan of and on Ternate, and one in Bali.

===French colonial residents===
France also maintained residents, the French word being &quot;résident&quot;.

However the &#x27;Jacobin&#x27; tradition of strict state authority didn&#x27;t agree well with indirect rule, so often direct rule was preferred.

Many were part of a white colonial hierarchy, rather than truly posted with a native ruler or chieftain.

====Style &quot;résident&quot;====
* A single post of resident was also created in &quot;Côte d&#x27;Ivoire&quot;, i.e. Ivory Coast (from 1881 subordinated to the Superior Commandant of Gabon and the Gulf of Guinea Settlements; from 1886 subordinated to the Lieutenant Governors of Guinea), where in 1842 France had declared protectorates over the Kingdoms of Nzima and Sanwi (posts at Assinié 1843–1870, and Grand Bassam, Fort Dabou 1853–1872, part of the Colony of Gorée and Dependencies in Senegal]):
** 1871–1885 Arthur Verdier (to 1878 Warden of the French Flag) (b. 1835 – d. 1898)
** 1885–1886 Charles Bour -Commandant-particular
** 1886 – 9 March 1890 Marcel Treich Leplène (b. 1860 – d. 1890)

** 1892 – 12 November 1892 Julien Voisin (acting)
** 12 November 1892 – 10 March 1893 Paul Alphonse Frédéric Heckman; thereafter it had its Governors
* On the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, several Residents were posted with the various native sultanates on major islands; they were all three subordinated to the French administrators of the Mayotte island protectorate (itself constituting the native Maore or Mawuti sultanate):
** On Ngazidja (Grande Comore island, divided into eleven sultanates, some of which on occasion had the superior title of Sultani tribe): November 1886 – 1912
** On Ndzuwani (Anjouan island) with the Phany (sole Sultan): only two incumbents 188x–189x
** On Mwali (Mohéli island) from 1886; then 1889–1912 filled by the above residents of Anjouan
* On Wallis and Futuna, after a single French Representative styled &quot;chargé de mission&quot; (7 April 1887 – 26 June 1888, Maurice Antoine Chauvot), there was a long list of Residents from 7 April 1887; since 3 October 1961, when both islands were joined as the Wallis &amp; Futuna overseas territory, their successors were styled &quot;Administrateur supérieur&quot; &#x27;Administrator-superior&#x27;, but the native dynasties remain; they represented the French government by the protectorate treaties with the Tui (ruler) of &#x27;Uvea (Wallis island, 5 April 1887; 27 November 1887 administratively attached to New Caledonia) and on 16 February 1888 with the two kingdoms on Futuna—Tu`a (also called Alo) and Sigave

====&quot;Résident supérieur&quot;====
This French title, meaning &quot;Superior&quot; (i.e. Senior) Resident, indicates that he had junior Residents under him.
*In Upper Volta (present Burkina Faso), which has had its own Lieutenant governor (before) or Governor (after) and intermediately has been part of one or (carved up) more neighbouring French colonies, there has been one Résident-Superieur of &quot;Upper Ivory Coast&quot;, 1 January 1938 – 29 July 1940, while it was part of the Ivory Coast colony: Edmond Louveau
*In Cambodia, where the local royal government was theoretically maintained, the resident at Phnom-Penh was the Resident-Superior, over the various Residents posted throughout Cambodia. The Resident-Superior of Cambodia answered to the Governor-General of Indochina, however.

===German colonial residents===
In the German colonies, the title was also Resident; the post was called &quot;Residentur&quot;.

* in Wituland: Ahmed ibn Fumo Bakari, the first mfalume (sultan) of Witu (on the Kenyan coast), ceded of territory on 8 April 1885 to the brothers Clemens and Gustav Denhardt&#x27;s &quot;Tana Company&quot;, and the remainder of the Wituland became the German &quot;Schutzgebiet&quot; (Protectorate) of Wituland (&quot;Deutsch-Witu&quot;) on 27 May 1885. The Reich was represented there by the German Residents: Gustav Denhardt (b. 1856 – d. 1917; in office 8 April 1885 – 1 July 1890) and his deputy Clemens Andreas Denhardt (b. 1852 – d. 1928) until 1 July 1890 imperial Germany renounces its protectorate, ceding the Wituland to Great Britain which had on 18 June 1890 declared it a British protectorate).

* In the Fort of São João Baptista de Ajudá (in present Benin), a country that was named Dahomey until 1975, civil residents served from 1911 (withdrawal of the Portuguese military garrison) until 31 July 1961 (invasion of the fort by the Dahomey military forces)

==Residents-general (and their subordinate residents)==

===British resident (-general)===

====British Malay states and possessions====
At the &quot;national&quot; level of British Malaya, after the post of High Commissioner had been filled (1 July 1896 – 1 April 1946) by the governors of the Straits Settlements (see Singapore), Britain appointed the following residents-general:
* 1 July 1896 – 1901 Frank Athelstane Swettenham (b. 1850 – d. 1946; from 1897, Sir Frank Athelstane Swettenham)
* 1901–1904 William Hood Treacher (b. 1849 – d. 1919)
* 1904–1910 Sir William Thomas Taylor (b. 1848 – d. 1931)
* 1910–1911 Arthur Henderson Young (b. 1854 – d. 1938)

Then there were various British chief secretaries 1911–1936 and two federal secretaries until 31 January 1942; after three Japanese military governors, the British Governor (1 April 1946 – 1 February 1948) stayed on as first of four High Commissioners as de facto governor-general of the Federation of Malaya until independence on 31 August 1957 saw the creation of an elective federal paramount ruler styled Yang Dipertuan Agong (since 16 September 1961 with the addition &quot;bagi Malaysia&quot;).

There were specific residents accredited in most constituent Malay states:
* 1885–1911 British Residents were appointed to the Sultans (until 1886 styled Maharaja) of Johore, an confederated state until 1946; thereafter the British crown was represented by General Advisers until the Japanese occupation, and finally by Commissioners 1945–1948
* 1888–1941 to the Yang Di Pertuan Besar (state&#x27;s elective ruler) of the nine member-confederation Negeri Sembilan, which accepted a British protectorate in 1888 and acceded in 1896 to the Federation; again British Commissioners after the Japanese occupation
** 1883–1895 additional British Residents were appointed to the Yang Di-Pertuan Muda (ruler) of Jelebu, a major member principality

* 1875–1941 British Residents to the Sultans of Selangor during the Klang War, a year after accepting British protectorate (never under Thailand), 1 July 1896 part of Federated Malay States; after the Japanese occupation British Commissioners

A similar position, under another title, was held in the other Malay states:
* 1909–41 British Advisers replaced the Thai king&#x27;s Advisers in the sultanate of Kedah, an unfederated state; after Japanese and Thai occupation, British Commissioners were appointed
* 1903–41 British Advisers replaced Thai ones in the sultanate of Kelantan, an confederated state; after Japanese and Thai occupation, British Commissioners were appointed
* 1909–1941 British Advisers replaced Thai ones with the Rajas of Perlis, since the acceptance of British protectorate as an confederated state instead of the Thai sovereignty (since the secession from Kedah) and were appointed again after Japanese and Thai occupation, until 1 April 1946 it joins the Malay Union (from 16 September 1963, Malaysia)
* 1904–25 British Agents were appointed to the Sultans of Terengganu, i.e. even before the 9 July 1909 exchange of Thai sovereignty for a British protectorate as unfederated Malay state, then Advisers 1919–1941 (overlap merely both titles for the same incumbent); after Japanese and Thai occupation, British Commissioners were appointed.

In the Straits Settlements, under direct British rule:
* in Singapore, after two separate British Residents (7 February 1819 – December 1822 William Farquhar, then John Crawfurd), the Governors of the Straits Settlements filled the post 1826 – 15 February 1942; after four Japanese Military Administrators and two Japanese Mayors, a British Military Administrator 12 September 1945 – 1 April 1946, then four British Governors and the second incumbent stayed on as first of two gubernatorial &#x27;Heads of state&#x27; styled yang di-pertuan negara, his Malay successor also becoming the first President after independence
* In Malacca (Melaka), a former Dutch colony, seven consecutive British Residents were in office 1795–1818, followed by three Dutch governors; after the final inclusion in the British Strait Settlements, 1826, most were titled Resident Councillor, except the period 1910–1920 reverting to the style Resident; after the Japanese occupation, Resident Commissioners took their place until the 1957 independence installed Malaysian Governors and Chief Ministers
* In Penang (Pinang), after three Superintendents for the British East India Company (1786–1799; only Prince of Wales Island had yet been ceded to the British by the Sultan of Kedah), then two Lieutenant-governors (in 1801 Province Wellesley on the mainland was added) and many Governors after 1805 (since 1826 as part of the Strait Settlements), only Resident Councillors were in office 1849–1941 (name Penang assumed in 1867); after four Japanese and since 1945 two British military governors, four Resident Commissioners 1946–1957, since then Malaysian-appointed &quot;heads of state&quot;.

On Northern Borneo, contrary to the Malay peninsula, no such officials were appointed, in Sarawak and Sabah as there were white rulers or governors; but to the still sovereign Sultans of Brunei, lying between those larger states, British Residents were appointed 1906–1959 (interrupted by Japanese commander Masao Baba 6 January 1942 – 14 June 1945), afterwards only High Commissioners for the matters not transferred under autonomy (and 1971 self-government) until full independence went in force 1 January 1984. The administrative head of Sarawak&#x27;s geographical Divisions was, however, titled as Resident.

===French===

===Belgian===
(Belgium mainly used French in the colonies; the word in its other official language, Dutch, is &quot;Resident-generaal&quot;)
* Ruanda-Urundi (cfr. German above; there were Belgian Residents ): 1960 – 1 July 1962 Jean-Paul Harroy (b. 1909 – d. 1995), staying on after being its Belgian last Governor (and Deputy Governor-General of the Belgian Congo)

===Japanese (original title)===
In the protectorate Korea, accredited to the Choson Monarch (rendered as King or Emperor) 21 Dec 1905 – 1 Oct 1910 three incumbents (including Hirobumi Ito the former Prime Minister of Japan), all Japanese peers (new western-type styles, rendered as: Marquess/Duke or Viscount); the last stayed on as the first Governor-General after full annexation to Japan. See: List of Japanese Residents-General of Korea

==Postcolonial residents==
On occasion, residents were maintained, notably by former colonial powers, in territories in a transitional process to a new constitutional status, such as full independence. Such function could also be performed under another title, such as Commissioner or High Commissioner.

Thus after World War I, there were residents in some mandate territories:
* after the French and British occupation of the former German colony Kamerun (since 26 September 1914), Britain started appointing a long line of residents (some were district officer or senior district officer, others deputy resident or senior resident) in its zone from 1916, even before the 28 June 1919 formal division into French and British Cameroons and the 20 July 1920 British Cameroons, League of Nations mandate; they continued in the 13 December 1946 created British Cameroons United Nations trust territory, until 31 December 1949; next a single special resident was appointed (although in 1949 Southern Cameroons was divided into two provinces: Bamenda, capital Bamenda, and Southern, capital Buea) until 1 October 1954 when British Cameroons became an autonomous part of Nigeria; next two commissioners were appointed instead, until on 1 October 1961 Southern British Cameroons was incorporated into the Republic of Cameroon (the former French Cameroun), the northern part was already united with Nigeria on 1 June 1961.
* Present Jordan was part since 12 May 1920 of the British mandate of Palestine (under a British high commissioner), but in August 1920 the British create autonomous local administrations in Ajlun, Salt, and Karak—with limited success; 11 April 1921 the Emirate of Transjordan (under British mandate); 26 May 1923 Transjordan formally separated from Palestine; 28 Feb 1928 Britain recognizes Transjordan mandate as independent, but maintains military and some financial control; 25 May 1946 proclamation of the Hashemite Kingdom (style Malik) of Transjordan (present Jordan); the 17 June 1946 formal independence from Britain finally ends the term of the last of four British Residents:
** April 1921 – 21 November 1921 Albert Abramson (b. 1876 – d. 19..)
** 21 November 1921 – April 1924 Harry St. John Bridger Philby (b. 1885 – d. 1960)
** August 1924 – March 1939 Henry Cox (from 1937, Charles Henry Cox) (b. 1880 – d. 1953)
** March 1939 – 17 June 1946 Alec Seath Kirkbride (b. 1897 – d. 1978)

Also after World War II, and not only in former mandate territories; e.g. in parts of Libya, a former Italian colony, put under UN administration since 1946 prior to their unification as a Libyan kingdom, Britain maintained a Resident in Tripolitania April 1949 – 24 December 1951 and another in Cyrenaica 17 September 1949 – 24 December 1951, and France one in Fezzan 1950 – 24 December 1951.

In a later phase a former colony could itself appoint such Residents, as India did 5 December 1950 – 16 May 1975 in its Himalayan protectorate Sikkim, then still an independent monarchy (afterwards absorbed into India as an additional constitutive state) where Britain had obtained a protectorate over the Maharaja in 1861, see above.

==Government residents in Australia==
===Western Australia===
In the Colony of Western Australia, colonial administration and local government were sometimes controlled at the regional level, by government residents, under the direction of the Colonial Secretary (i.e. the &quot;Governor in Council&quot;).

The main responsibility of a government resident was the role of Resident Magistrate, and the two titles were often used interchangeably. However, they also often directed the day-to-day activities of police, explorers, surveyors, customs officers and other public servants.
Government residents were appointed (at various times), at Augusta, Busselton, Carnarvon (Gascoyne District), Champion Bay (Geraldton), Derby (Kimberley District, later West Kimberley), Fremantle, Guildford, King George&#x27;s Sound (Albany), Newcastle (Toodyay), the North District (Camden Harbour/Roebourne), Port Leschenault (Bunbury), Wyndham (East Kimberley) and York.

===Northern Territory===
In the Northern Territory, government residents were appointed by the Government of South Australia from the establishment of the territory in 1864 until its transfer to the Australian Government on 1 January 1911. The last incumbent stayed on as first of six administrators; then again 1 February 1927 Robert Hunter Weddell was Government Resident for North Australia, until from 12 June 1931. Administrators were (and still are) appointed, even after 1978 when self-government was granted.

===Central Australia===
1 March 1927 – 12 June 1931, while the Northern Territory was split, there were two consecutive incumbents for Central Australia.

<text>Vice-Admiral Peter Jansen Wessel Tordenskiold (28 October 1690 – 12 November 1720) was a Royal Dano-Norwegian Navy officer. Born in Trondheim, he travelled to Copenhagen in 1704 and eventually join the Dano-Norwegian navy, rising to the rank of vice-admiral for his actions during the Great Northern War. He won a name for himself through audacity and courage and was ennobled as &quot;Peter Tordenskiold&quot; by Frederick IV of Denmark in 1716. His greatest exploit came later that year, as he destroyed a supply fleet of the Swedish Navy at the Battle of Dynekilen, ensuring the siege of Fredriksten would end in failure. In 1720, he was killed in a duel. He ranks among the most famous naval captains in Denmark and Norway. He experienced an unusually rapid rise in rank and died when he was only 30 years old.

==Name==
His birth name was Peter Jansen Wessel. His name occurs with spellings as &quot;Peder&quot; and &quot;Pitter&quot;. Upon his ennoblement in 1716, he received the name meaning &#x27;thunder shield&#x27;. This was also the orthographical form which he used. In newer times, the form has become usual.

==Biography==
Born in Trondheim in Norway, he was the tenth child of alderman Jan Wessel and the brother of later Rear-Admiral . Peter Wessel was a wild, unruly lad who gave his pious parents much trouble, eventually stowing away on a ship heading for Copenhagen in 1704. In Copenhagen, he unsuccessfully sought to become a navy cadet. He befriended the king&#x27;s chaplain, Peder Jespersen, who sent Wessel on a voyage to the West Indies and finally procured a vacant cadetship for him. After further voyages, this time to the East Indies, Wessel was appointed second lieutenant in the Royal Danish-Norwegian Navy on 7 July 1711 and went on to serve on the frigate &quot;Postillion&quot;. While on &quot;Postillion&quot;, he befriended Norwegian admiral baron Waldemar Løvendal, who was the first to recognize the young man&#x27;s potential as a naval officer. Løvendal soon made Peter Wessel the captain of the four-gun sloop &quot;Ormen&quot; ().

===Early service===
Wessel started his navy service during the Great Northern War against Sweden, cruising about the Swedish coast in &quot;Ormen&quot; picking up useful information about the enemy. In June 1712, Løvendal promoted him to the 18-gun warship , against the advice of the Danish admiralty, who considered Wessel unreliable. After officially complaining about his dreary commanding officer in Norway, Wessel was transferred to the Baltic Sea command of Ulrik Christian Gyldenløve, who appreciated and utilized Wessel&#x27;s courage. Wessel was already renowned for two things: the audacity with which he attacked any Swedish vessels he came across regardless of the odds and his unique seamanship, which always enabled him to evade capture.

The Great Northern War had now entered its later stage when Sweden, beset on every side by foes, employed her fleet principally to transport troops and stores to the distressed Swedish Pomerania provinces. The audacity of Wessel impeded her at every point. He was continually snapping up transports, dashing into the fjords where her vessels lay concealed and holding up her detached frigates. He was a part of Gyldenløve&#x27;s fleet which succeeded in destroying a large number of Swedish transport ships at Rügen on 29 September 1712, and was promoted from second lieutenant to captain lieutenant. His successes compelled the Swedes to post a reward for his capture, while his free and easy ways also won him enemies in the Danish navy, who deplored his almost privateer-like conduct.

===Court-martial===
In June 1714, Wessel, commanding &quot;Løvendals Galei&quot;, began cruising off the Norwegian coast in search of a Swedish privateer spotted near Bergen. Unable to locate the privateer, Wessel sailed southwards to intercept Swedish privateers in the North Sea bound for Gothenburg. On 26 July at 2pm, &quot;Løvendals Galei&quot;, flying a Dutch ensign, encountered a frigate flying a British ensign off Lindesnes. The two ships saluted each other and sailed away before the other ship abruptly turned and fired two shots at &quot;Løvendals Galei&quot;. Wessel quickly ordered his crew to raise the Dano-Norwegian ensign and fire three shots at the unknown ship, which had raised a Swedish ensign. The unknown ship, which was the 28-gun Swedish privateer &quot;Olbing Galley&quot; (purchased in England and captained by Irishman Samuel Blackman) fired a broadside at &quot;Løvendals Galei&quot;, initiating a full-scale engagement.

At roughly 9:15pm, after over seven hours of combat, &quot;Olbing Galley&quot; raised her sails and attempted to flee, with &quot;Løvendals Galei&quot; in hot pursuit. By 10:30pm, the skirmish resumed, but ceased at 11:45pm due to nightfall. At 6:00am on 27 July, the two ships met again and another skirmish ensued until 9:30am. By now, both ships were severely damaged and running low on ammunition. Wessel sent an envoy to &quot;Olbing Galley&quot;, thanking her crew for a good duel and requesting more ammunition to continue the fight. His request was denied and Wessel and Bactmann drank a toast to each other&#x27;s health before parting.

When he heard about the incident, an infuriated Frederick IV of Denmark ordered the Admiralty to court-martial Wessel. In November 1714, Wessel stood trial, accused of disclosing vital military information (his lack of ammunition) to the enemy, as well as endangering a ship of the Crown by engaging a superior warship. Wessel defended himself vigorously and blamed his comrades, impressing Frederick IV; arguing that a section of the naval code mandated attacking fleeing enemy ships no matter their size, he was acquitted on 15 December. Wessel subsequently requested a promotion from the King and was made captain on 28 December.

===Greatest exploits===

When, in 1715, the return of King Charles XII of Sweden from Turkey to Stralsund put new life into the dispirited Swedish forces, Wessel distinguished himself in numerous engagements off the coast of Swedish Pomerania, under the command of Admiral . He did the enemy considerable damage by cutting out their frigates and destroying their transports. During a battle at Kolberg on 24 April 1715, Wessel captured the Swedish Rear-Admiral Hans Wachtmeister, as well as the frigate &quot;Hvita Örn&quot; (&quot;White Eagle&quot;), which he was granted as his new flagship under the name &quot;Hvide Ørn&quot;. He then transferred to the main fleet under the command of Peter Raben.

On returning to Denmark at the beginning of 1716, he was ennobled by Frederick IV under the name of &quot;Tordenskiold&quot;. In 1716, Charles XII invaded Norway and laid siege to the fortress of Fredrikshald. Tordenskiold compelled Charles to raise the siege and retire to Sweden. Tordenskiold did so by pouncing upon the Swedish transport fleet, laden with ammunition and other military stores, which rode at anchor in the narrow and dangerous Dynekil Fjord. With two frigates and five smaller ships, he conquered or destroyed around 30 Swedish ships, with minor damage to himself during the Battle of Dynekilen on 8 July 1716.

For this his greatest exploit, he was promoted to the rank of post-captain, commanding the Kattegat squadron – but at the same time incurred the enmity of Christian Carl Gabel, whom he had failed to take into his confidence. Tordenskiold&#x27;s first important command was the squadron with which he was entrusted at the beginning of 1717 to destroy the Swedish Gothenburg Squadron, which interrupted the communications between Denmark and Norway. Owing to the disloyalty of certain of his officers who resented serving under the young adventurer, Tordenskjold failed to do all that was expected of him. His enemies were not slow to take advantage of his partial failure. The old charge of criminal recklessness was revived against him at a second court-martial before which he was summoned in 1718. Nevertheless, his old patron Ulrik Christian Gyldenløve intervened energetically on his behalf, and the charge was quashed.

In December 1718, Tordenskiold brought Frederick IV the welcome news of the death of Charles XII and was, in turn, made Rear-Admiral. Tordenskiold captured the Swedish fortress of Carlsten at Marstrand in 1719.
 The last feat of arms during the Great Northern War was Tordenskiold&#x27;s partial destruction and partial capture of the Gothenburg Squadron, which had so long eluded him, on 26 September 1719. He was rewarded with the rank of vice-admiral.

===Death===
Tordenskiold did not long survive the termination of the war. On 12 November 1720, at the age of 30, he was killed in a duel by Livonian colonel . During a trip to Hannover, Tordenskiold got in a fight with von Holstein, who had been in Swedish military service. The confrontation ended in a duel on the Sehlwiese in Gleidingen near Hildesheim, in which the sword of von Holstein ran through Tordenskiold. The circumstances around the death of Tordenskiold were set in a conspiratorial light, as summed up in the contemporary three-volume Tordenskiold biography (1747–1750) by C. P. Rothe.

The duel was encouraged by a dispute with von Holstein, whom Tordenskiold offended by labeling him as a cheat at gambling. At a dinner party, Tordenskiold told of a friend who had been cheated while gambling with a man who claimed to own a Hydra, to which von Holstein announced he was the owner of the said creature and took offence at being called a cheat. This dispute turned into a fight, in which von Holstein unsuccessfully tried to pull a sword, after which Tordenskiold used the pommel of his own sword to beat him up. von Holstein demanded satisfaction through a duel. The details of the duel – besides its ending with Tordenskiold&#x27;s death by a single wound by von Holstein&#x27;s sword – are not well known.

Tordenskiold&#x27;s corpse was brought to Copenhagen to the Holmen Church without much ceremony, as duelling was not allowed according to Danish law. In 1819, he was buried in a sarcophagus.

==Legacy==

Although – Dynekilen excepted – Tordenskiold&#x27;s individual victories were of less importance than Christen Thomesen Sehested&#x27;s at the Siege of Stralsund and Ulrich Christian Gyldenløve&#x27;s at Rügen, he is seen as the most heroic figure of the Great Northern War, after Charles XII. He is mentioned by name both in the Danish national anthem &quot;&quot;Kong Christian stod ved højen mast&quot; from 1778 and the Norwegian national anthem &quot;Ja, vi elsker dette landet&quot;&quot; from 1864.

Statues of him have been erected in Copenhagen (1876), Trondheim, Stavern, Oslo and Haakonsvern. In the United States, Tordenskjold Township in the state of Minnesota was settled in 1871 by Danish brothers who named it after him. The coat of arms of Holmestrand included his ship until the municipal merger in 2020, after which a new coat of arms was introduced.

The Royal Danish Navy has named several ships after him, including an early 20th century coastal defence ship. The Niels Juel class corvette , served from around 1980 to August 2009. The Royal Norwegian Navy has also named ships after him, such as the coastal defence ship &quot;Tordenskjold&quot;, and the Royal Norwegian Naval Training Establishment in Bergen is named KNM Tordenskjold.

The Danish city of Frederikshavn has hosted an annual summer festival in his memory since 1998. Tordenskiold was stationed there and wrote 67 letters from there between 1717 and 1719. In 2008, the Festival attracted more than 30,000 visitors. In 2009, the Days of Tordenskiold were celebrated on 26, 27, and 28 June.

Several Danish and Norwegian cities have streets named Tordenskjoldsgade (Tordenskjold Street) after him.

The most popular brand of matches in Denmark is called Tordenskjold. In the late 1800s, Sweden had a large export production of matches, so a Danish manufacturer put Tordenskiold&#x27;s portrait on his matchbox in 1882, in the hope he could once more strike at the Swedish (). The Tordenskjold brand was bought by a Swedish company in 1972.

===In fiction===
Though his victories were not decisive during the war, he eventually attained mythic status as one of the most successful Dano-Norwegian military commanders. As the Danish-Norwegian Union ended in 1814 with the Treaty of Kiel and Denmark consigned itself to the status of a minor power following the Napoleonic Wars, Tordenskiold was revived as both a Danish and Norwegian national symbol. He was portrayed as the little guy outsmarting his far more powerful adversaries, and his exploits were enhanced by mixing in myths and fiction.

A comprehensive fictionalized account was collected in the 1858 popular song &quot;Jeg vil sjunge om en Helt&quot;, and a great number of fictional plays and novels were subsequently published. These accounts served as background for the 1910 Danish film &quot;&quot;Peter Tordenskjold&quot;, based on a Carit Etlar play, and the 1942 film &quot;Tordenskjold går i land&quot;&quot;. In 1993, the two-act musical &quot;Tordenskjold&quot; opened, a mix of fact and fiction, with Øystein Wiik as Peter Wessel. The musical was performed in Gladsaxe and Aarhus. The 2016 film &quot;Satisfaction 1720&quot; is another mix of fact, fiction, and speculation about Tordenskjold after the Great Northern War and the duel that ended his life.

One of the myths about Tordenskjold has entered the Danish and Norwegian languages. During the negotiations for Marstrand&#x27;s surrender in 1719, it is told that Tordenskjold&#x27;s men moved from block to block as he walked the Marstrand commander through his positions, thus convincing the commander that his strength was much greater than it was. This gave birth to the idiom &quot;Tordenskjold&#x27;s soldiers&quot; (), denoting the same group of people (feeling compelled to) repeatedly taking charge and fill multiple roles.

<doc id="491493" wikidata="Q7792602" url="?curid=491493" title="Thomas Muir of Huntershill">
<text>Thomas Muir (24 August 1765 – 25 January 1799), also known as Thomas Muir the Younger of Huntershill, was a Scottish political reformer and lawyer. Muir graduated from Edinburgh University and was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1787, aged 22. Muir was a leader of the Society of the Friends of the People.
He is included in the Political Martyrs&#x27; Monument in Edinburgh. 

In 1793 Muir was sentenced to transportation to Botany Bay Australia for sedition. Two years later in 1796, Muir escaped from Botany Bay on the American ship &quot;Otter&quot;. The &quot;Otter&quot; reached Nootka Sound, Vancouver Island in June 1796. From there Muir travelled to Mexico City, where he asked to be allowed to travel to California. He was later imprisoned in Havana, Cuba and taken by Spanish ship to Cádiz, Spain. In September 1797, the Spanish Government released Muir. Muir made his way to France. In November 1797, he arrived in Bordeaux, where he was hailed as a &#x27;Hero of the French Republic.&#x27; Muir then traveled to Paris. Muir&#x27;s confidant in 1798 was Dr Robert Watson and Muir learned of the United Scotsmen, which replaced the Friends of the People. In November 1798, Muir moved to the Île-de-France village of Chantilly. He died there on 25 January 1799. Shortly before his death, he said, &quot;we have achieved a great duty in these critical times. After the destruction of so many years, we have been the first to revive the spirit of our country and give it a National Existence.&quot;

== Early years ==
Thomas Muir was born above his father&#x27;s grocers shop on the High Street of Glasgow. His father, James Muir, was the son of the &#x27;bonnet laird&#x27; of Birdston in Milton of Campsie, he married Margaret Smith and they had two children Thomas and Janet. As a younger son James Muir had little prospect of inheriting his father&#x27;s property. His family, however, had in Maidstone, Kent, relations who were prosperous hop-growers and it was towards this branch of trade that young James was persuaded to direct his energies. In this business venture he achieved considerable success and by the time of his marriage in 1764 he was firmly established as a hop-merchant in the High Street of Glasgow. Here, in the heart of the town&#x27;s ancient University quarter, he settled with his wife, living in a little flat above his shop.

By all accounts Muir senior was a man of some education, whose interest in commerce extended far beyond that of his fellow businessmen, for he has been credited with the authorship of a pamphlet on &#x27;England&#x27;s Foreign Trade&#x27;. In the 1780s he purchased the property of Huntershill House, together with adjoining lands. Of Muir&#x27;s mother, Margaret Smith, nothing of a biographical nature has been recorded. However, it is known that both Muir&#x27;s parents were orthodox Presbyterians, consequently young Thomas&#x27;s early upbringing was very much within the confines of the rigid moral and social ethic of ‘Auld Licht’ Calvinism. Early accounts described him as &#x27;a pious child of modest, reserved nature&#x27;.

==Education==

Muir&#x27;s education began at the age of five when his father hired William Barclay, a local schoolmaster, as a private tutor. In 1775, at the early age of 10, he was admitted to the &quot;gowned classes&quot; of Glasgow University. After five sessions he matriculated (1777) and took up divinity: like his parents he supported the Auld Licht or popular party in Kirk politics.

==Graduation==

In 1782, at the age of 17, Muir graduated with an M.A. Influenced by the teachings of John Millar, he abandoned his studies for the Church. At the beginning of the 1783–4 term he was accepted as a student in Millar&#x27;s classes on Law and Government. His target was Scottish political conservatism in the form of the Faculty of Advocates and he recruited young Whig advocates imbued with a due reverence for the law. Muir joined students&#x27; clubs and societies in which the major topics of the day (American Independence, Patronage, and Burgh Reform) were debated.

==Expelled from university==
In May 1784, a dispute occurred between Professor John Anderson and other members of the Faculty, including Principal William Leechman and Professors Richardson and Taylor. Senior students issued a pamphlet &quot;A Statement of Fact&quot; against Leechman and the Faculty. After Anderson had departed for London, disciplinary proceedings were launched. Muir, McIndoe, Humphries and ten others were named as ringleaders; a ban was enforced on their attendance at lectures awaiting the result of hearings. Muir and his fellow students requested legal representation, but this request was rejected. Muir gave notice of his voluntary self-expulsion from the university.

At the beginning of the new academic year Muir, with the assistance of Millar, obtained a place at Edinburgh University under the Whig Professor of Law, John Wylde. Here he completed his studies and having passed his Bar examinations was admitted to the Faculty of Advocates in 1787 at the age of 22.

==Tribune of the people==

An Elder of the Church of Scotland for his home parish of Cadder, Muir became embroiled at the beginning of 1790 in a dispute with the local landlords led by James Dunlop of Garnkirk, a rich owner. Muir acting on behalf of the elders challenged the attempt of the landlords or heritors to pack the selection committee for a new minister with &quot;Parchment Barons&quot;. Upon the case being referred to the Synod at Glasgow, Muir was appointed as Counsel for the congregation and fought a protracted case on their behalf all the way to the General Assembly. In the event the case of the landlords was thrown out, and Muir and his party emerged victorious.

Muir acquired a reputation as a man of principle. His outspoken conviction that many existing laws were biased against the poor, won him the respect of younger advocates who nicknamed him &quot;the Chancellor&quot;. His views on law reform were, however, unacceptable to members of the High Court: Lord Braxfield and Robert Dundas.

==Revolution in France==
The French Revolution of 1789 revived the hopes of all members of the Whig party in Scotland and England, in their campaign for burgh and county reform. Foxite Whigs in Parliament and the Lords inaugurated in April 1792 the London Association of the Friends of the People. Led by the Scots Lords, Lauderdale and Buchan, this society enjoyed widespread initial support from leading Whigs throughout Britain.

Since 1789, many clubs and societies had sprung up in the principal towns and villages of Scotland in support of the Revolution and its principles. In June 1792, the members of these societies and, in particular, those at Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and Perth, began a regular correspondence with the object of forming a Scottish counterpart to the London Association. By the end of June 1792, a plan of organisation, principally drawn up by Muir and William Skirving, a Fife farmer, was set in motion. In distinct contrast to the London Association, which was deliberately exclusive, Muir and his associates, taking into consideration the vital educational differential between the working people of Scotland and England, opted for a nationwide association of reform clubs unlimited to any social class. After some initial difficulties due to the entrenched opposition of Henry Erskine, the Dean of the Faculty and leading Scottish Whig, the Scottish Association of the Friends of the People was formed at Edinburgh on 26 July 1792. Supported by two new publications, the &quot;Edinburgh Gazeteer&quot; and the &quot;Caledonian Chronicle&quot;, plus James Tytler&#x27;s &quot;Historical Register&quot;, the new movement rapidly expanded.

Muir travelled to meet with the leaders of the Friends of the People in London. Sharing their concern that the execution of Louis XVI would be a disaster for the reform movements in the British Isles, Muir agreed to go to France and join Tom Paine in his attempts to persuade the leaders of the revolution to spare the life of the King. Muir had talks with the Girondist leaders, but their influence was waning. 

==The Edinburgh Convention and the United Irish address==
Muir returned to Scotland on 23 August 1792. At the beginning of October he helped form Glasgow Society of Friends of the People and undertook a propaganda tour of Stirlingshire, Dunbartonshire, and Renfrewshire from which emerged new societies in Kirkintilloch, Birdston, Lennoxtown, Campsie and Paisley. On 21 November, Muir, having been elected vice-president of the movement at the Edinburgh monthly meeting, called for a General Convention of the popular reform societies in Great Britain to be held there in December.

On 8 December, as the first of the delegates were arriving in the capital, an &quot;Address of Fraternity&quot; from the United Irishmen arrived at Muir&#x27;s lodgings in Carrubers Close. Drawn up by William Drennan, its appeal to the republican and independent spirit of the Scottish people were entirely to Muir&#x27;s satisfaction. However, he appears to have unwisely circulated a copy of it among the delegates prior to the first sitting of the convention. Although &quot;there was much in the address that was attractive to the delegates, many objected to the &#x27;intemperate and dangerous nationalistic language&quot;. 

As Muir rose in the first session Muir to present the Address he was vigorously opposed by a powerful unionist section among the delegates led by Col. William Dalrymple, Lord Daer and Richard Fowler. The Address contained &quot;Treason or Misprison of Treason against the Union with England&quot;. Although the Address &#x27;in its original form&#x27; was ultimately rejected, Muir was able to read it out and to declare: &quot;We do not, we cannot, consider ourselves as mowed and melted down into another country. Have we not distinct Courts, Judges, Juries, Laws, etc.?&quot;. 

==Charged, convicted and transported for sedition==
Muir spent the days following the Convention preparing a defence brief for James Tytler, arrested on a charge of sedition the previous month. Robert Dundas the Lord Advocate initiated an investigation of Muir&#x27;s movements during the previous three months. Muir, on his way to Edinburgh on the morning of 2 January 1793 to attend Tytler&#x27;s trial, was himself arrested on a charge of sedition and brought under guard to Edinburgh. After interrogation before the Sheriff and refusing to answer any questions, Muir was released on bail.

On 8 January Muir set out for London, to tell the Reformers there of the plight of the Scottish Association. The trial of the French King had changed attitudes. Both Charles Gray and Lord Lauderdale were now considering giving up the campaign for Parliamentary reform. Muir went to France, hoping vainly to persuade the French leaders to spare the life of the King. He met personalities of the National Convention including Condorcet, Brissot, Mirabeau and Madame Roland. While in Paris he also met Thomas Paine and Dr William Maxwell of Kirkconnel, the future doctor and associate of Robert Burns.

With the outbreak of war with France the anti-reform party in Scotland became increasingly militant, and Dundas advanced the date of Muir&#x27;s trial from April to 11 February. Learning this, Muir drafted an open letter stating his intention to return as soon as passport difficulties would admit. Dundas set in motion legal steps to ensure Muir&#x27;s outlawry for non-appearance on 25 February 1793, when Lord Braxfield pronounced him a fugitive from justice.

On 6 March 1793, Henry Erskine convened a meeting of the Faculty of Advocates at which Muir, with no one to speak in his defence, was unanimously expelled and his name struck from the register. At the end of June Muir obtained a passage from Havre de Grace in an American ship, &quot;The Hope of Boston&quot;. 

Disembarking at Belfast, he made his way south to Dublin where he was feted by William Drennan and other leading United Irishmen, and taking Drennan&#x27;s membership test was inducted into their society. Urged on by the secretary of the society, Archibald Hamilton Rowan, Muir decided to ignore his father&#x27;s advice to remain in exile, and to return to Scotland to face down his accusers. He travelled back via Belfast where he was hosted by the publisher of the United Irish paper, the &quot;Northern Star&quot;, Samuel Neilson.

Landing in Portpatrick on 24 August 1793, he was immediately arrested. Brought under guard to Edinburgh and incarcerated in the Tolbooth prison, on 30 and 31 August he was brought before Braxfield, to answer charges &quot;seditious speeches, circulating seditious publications, e.g. The Rights of Man, and reading a seditious document in public, viz. the United Irishmen&#x27;s address&quot;. The judge seized on Muir&#x27;s connection to the &quot;ferocious&quot; Mr. Rowan (Rowan had challenged Robert Dundas, the Lord Advocate of Scotland, to a duel) and on the United Irishmen papers found in his possession. 

Muir was sentenced to 14 years transportation. The reform movement then stiffened their resistance to Government coercion. Muir was removed to an armed cutter, the &quot;Royal George&quot;, at Leith Roads. There he was soon joined by Thomas Fyshe Palmer, who had received a sentence of 7 years transportation in similar circumstances at Perth. Skirving resolved to convene a new Convention, better organised and more representative than its predecessors. Dundas reacted by ordering the immediate removal of Muir and Palmer to the Hulks at Woolwich, ahead of their departure for Botany Bay.

==The third Convention==
The third Convention of the Friends of the People and its successor the &#x27;British Convention&#x27; were, like their predecessors, largely dominated by the delegates of the Edinburgh Societies. Moreover, by means of arrests and desertions, the Scottish movement had been deprived of most of its articulate leadership. Into this vacuum stepped three English delegates: Maurice Margarot, a merchant with a university education, Joseph Gerrald, friend and correspondent of William Godwin and an orator of flawless eloquence, and Matthew Campbell Browne, an actor turned reformer. After the early departure of Lord Daer, who was already suffering from the tuberculosis which led to his death the following year, these three men came to dominate the convention and its proceedings.

Only they and Muir realised the true nature of the extraordinary organisational differences existing between the reform movements in England and Scotland. Where the English societies remained psychologically and geographically divided, the Scots had an unprecedented degree of national unity backed by the general sympathy of the common people. Finding themselves almost by accident at the head of such an organisation, they threw all discretion to the winds. Urged on by Campbell Browne&#x27;s wild histrionics, the movement&#x27;s covert aims now became an open secret. Aping the Convention at Paris, the terms Citizen President, Secretary General, etc. were now introduced into its published reports, while the convention was rechristened the &#x27;British Convention&#x27;.

What Muir thought of this reckless exposure to destruction of the organisation which he and William Skirving had so carefully nurtured is revealed by his description of it in 1797 as &#x27;a miserable plaything of the English Government&#x27;. Ultimately it was a motion of Charles Sinclair, delegate from the Society for Constitutional Information (London), which gave Dundas his much sought-for excuse to disperse the convention.

Commenting upon the Convention Bill recently passed in Ireland as a means of suppressing public assemblies, Sinclair moved that a secret committee of four, together with the Secretary, be invested with the power to fix the meeting of a Convention of Emergency. This convention would, if necessary, declare itself permanent and resist attempts to disperse it. When the diligent spy, &#x27;J.B.&#x27;, duly delivered his report of this discussion, the authorities moved swiftly. Early on the morning of 5 December arrest warrants were issued and served by armed bailiffs upon Skirving, Margarot, Gerrald, Sinclair and Matthew Campbell Browne. In the trials which followed, Skirving, Margarot and Gerrald were each respectively given sentences of 14 years transportation. While these events were occurring, Muir and Palmer were being held in the prison hulks by night and being forced to labour in a chain gang on the banks of the Thames by day. An attempt to ship them out to Botany Bay in the convict transport &quot;Ye Canada&quot; had failed, when in true &#x27;coffin-ship&#x27; tradition, her timbers were found to be rotten. After spending some time in Newgate Jail where they were joined by the newly convicted associates, Palmer, Skirving and Margarot, they were removed by coach to Portsmouth and placed aboard a new transport &quot;Surprize&quot;. In spite of belated and somewhat reluctant attempts on behalf of the Whigs in Parliament and the Lords to obtain a pardon for the radicals, they were abruptly shipped out for Botany Bay on the morning of 24 May.

==Journey and arrival in Australia==

On the first of May 1794, the &quot;Surprise&quot;, convict transport, sailed from Spithead (St. Helen&#x27;s) for Sydney with Muir, Palmer, Skirving, and Margarot on board. The French Admiralty, by order of the Comite du Salut Public, sent out frigates to attempt their rescue; but the &quot;Surprise&quot; sailed with a strong convoy of East Indiamen and some of His Majesty&#x27;s ships, and it does not appear they ever sighted the French frigates. The &quot;Surprise&quot; reached Sydney on 25 October 1794.

During the long voyage out to Australia an attempt was made (with or without official connivance) to discredit Muir, Skirving and Palmer by implicating them in an alleged mutiny led by the first mate. This affair, however, was so badly bungled that, in spite of having to endure much harsh and brutal treatment at the hands of the captain, the reformers had little difficulty in refuting the evidence against them upon arrival at Port Jackson.

==Confinement at Sydney Cove==

Muir&#x27;s term of confinement at the penal colony appears to have been fairly uneventful. As political prisoners, and men of talent and education, Muir and his associates were accorded far greater freedom of movement than ordinary convicts. Prior to their departure from Portsmouth, each had received a considerable sum of money raised as a subscription on their behalf among the wealthy London Whigs. By this means they were able to sustain themselves without recourse to the official colonial stores, and thereby keep free of the compulsory manual labour normally demanded from all dependents.

In November, Judge Advocate Collins records that:

By December all four had spent the bulk of their remaining cash in purchasing plots of land. Skirving and Muir both seem to have acquired the services of some time-served convicts as servants. Palmer purchased of land for £84, and was soon waxing eloquent about his new occupation as a farmer. Unlike his companions, or indeed his father, Muir had little or no taste for farming and with an eye to ultimate escape from the settlement, he purchased a small hut and several acres of land on the opposite side of the bay. Muir&#x27;s farm was located in the area that is now Jeffrey Street in Kirribilli.

By this means he was able to remove himself from the direct observation of the Governor and his soldiers and at the same time was provided with a legitimate excuse for keeping a small boat.

Early in 1796 with the assistance of Pierre François Péron, a French sailor, he succeeded in arranging his escape from the settlement on board the American maritime fur trade ship , of Boston.

Some accounts state that Muir&#x27;s rescue or flight was not the first of such escapes may be judged from a remark of William Robert Broughton, Royal Navy, who sailed from Port Jackson in , 13 Oct 1795, &quot;We abstained from following the example of other ships that have touched at this colony, by not taking away any of the convicts, a practice very general in merchant ships gay&quot;.

The captain of &quot;Otter&quot;, Ebenezer Dorr, had, however, made it a precondition of his part in the escape plan that Muir and any who chose to go with him should effect their own escape from the harbour at Port Jackson, as this was carefully guarded by a blockading frigate. Muir swiftly contacted his fellow prisoners. However, in the event, none but himself was able to go. Skirving who had suffered from a recent bout of yellow fever was too weak, and would shortly be dead. Gerrald who had recently arrived in the settlement was in the final stages of acute tuberculosis and the Revd Palmer, who was nursing him, refused to leave his charge. Only Margarot might have availed himself of Muir&#x27;s plan; however he was absent at a farm deep in the hills at Parramatta, and in any case he had been sent to Coventry (i.e. exiled) by his former colleagues because of his part in supporting the mutiny allegations.

==Escape to America==

On the evening of 17 February 1796, Muir, together with two convict servants, loaded up his small boat with one day&#x27;s provisions and stealthily rowed their way out of harbour. Hugging close to the shore, they successfully eluded detection by the watch on the frigate, and navigated their way towards their prearranged point of rendezvous. About 12 am. on the following day, wet and exhausted, they were hauled aboard &quot;Otter&quot;. Muir, who had been unable to bring with him any of his personal property, left behind a note giving his books and papers to Palmer, with whom he also left a letter for the Governor thanking him for his tolerance and stating his intention of practising law at the American Bar. After a highly adventurous voyage across the as yet largely uncharted Pacific Ocean to Vancouver Island, &quot;Otter&quot; finally dropped anchor in Nootka Sound on 22 June 1796.

The chronicles of Pierre François Péron describe Muir&#x27;s escape and the voyage across the Pacific and as far as Monterey, California.

In conversation with the Portuguese José Tovar, the &quot;piloto&quot; (master) of the &quot;Sutil&quot;, a Spanish vessel at anchor in the bay, Muir learned to his dismay of the presence in neighbouring waters of , a British sloop-of-war under William Robert Broughton. This vessel had visited Port Jackson shortly before Muir&#x27;s escape and, since he had almost certainly become acquainted with the captain or members of the crew, his life was now in real danger. To be captured while under sentence of transportation meant immediate execution. Once again Muir&#x27;s extraordinary luck held out. While a student at Glasgow, he had acquired a fluent command of Spanish and he was now able to persuade Tovar to break his regulations regarding the admission of foreigners into Spanish territory. Changing vessels he sailed with Tovar down the coast of California to the port of Monterey, California. On arrival at this important Spanish outpost, Muir was introduced to the Governor, Don Diego Borica, who was favourably impressed by his character and intelligence, and allocated him accommodation along with his own family in the Presidio.

However, when Borica in due course submitted a report on Muir to his superior, the Viceroy at Mexico City, matters took a turn for the worse. Ignoring Muir&#x27;s request to pass through Spanish territory to the United States, the Viceroy, instead, ordered the severe disciplining of Tovar for violating his orders. Muir&#x27;s use of Washington&#x27;s name and his claims of friendship with many of the leading personalities of the French Revolution, had rendered him highly suspicious to the Spanish authorities. Accordingly, Borica was directed to have Muir conducted with all haste to the capital &#x27;without open sign of his being under arrest&#x27;. Accompanied by two officers detached from the Governor&#x27;s staff, Muir, after a gruelling and often dangerous trek across the mountains, reached Mexico City on 12 October. For some days he was held in detention and closely questioned as to his purpose in entering California. It is evident, however, that his explanations were disbelieved by the sceptical Viceroy, who resolved to ship him out to Spain as a suspected spy. Under heavy guard, Muir was now dispatched on the road for the port of Vera Cruz where he arrived on 22 October. In spite of his demands to be put on board an American ship, he was now shipped out to Havana, Cuba to await the departure of a convoy for Spain.

==Return to Europe==
For some time, Muir appears to have regained his liberty in Havana, for he spoke to several American merchants explaining his plight. He also appears to have attempted an escape, only to be recaptured and imprisoned for three months in the dungeons of the La Principia Fortress. However Muir was nothing if not resourceful and it was while he was in La Principia that he succeeded by some means in contacting Victor Hughes, the French Agent for the Windward Islands. On learning of Muir&#x27;s situation Hughes wrote to the Directory in France, thus providing them with the first concrete news of Muir&#x27;s escape and survival. He also wrote an indignant letter to the Governor of Cuba protesting bitterly at Muir&#x27;s harsh treatment and demanding his release. However, by the time this letter arrived in Havana, Muir had already sailed for Spain.

Whatever misgivings or fears Muir may have had for his safety at the hands of his Spanish jailers, there was one danger which had not occurred to him – that of confrontation with a British fleet. On the morning of 26 April 1797 as Muir&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Ninfa&quot;, approached the entrance to Cadiz Harbour, he was confronted by several Royal Navy Men o&#x27; War who for some weeks had been blockading the port. Seeing at once that a conflict was inevitable, Muir approached the captain and asked to be put ashore as he was unwilling to bear arms against a ship which almost certainly contained some of his fellow countrymen. The captain, however, faced with the likely destruction of his vessel, had no time to consider the feelings of a prisoner. Turning about, the &quot;Ninfa&quot; and her sister ship the &quot;Santa Elena&quot; headed up the coast, hotly pursued by the British ships. After a chase of some three hours duration, the &quot;Ninfa&quot; and the &quot;Santa Elena&quot; were engaged in battle opposite Conil de la Frontera. In the action which followed, the &quot;Ninfa&quot; was seriously damaged, while the &quot;Santa Elena&quot;, reputedly a rich bullion ship, was deliberately scuttled by her captain. During the last few moments of the engagement, Muir received a glancing blow to the face from a piece of shrapnel which smashed his left cheek bone and seriously injured both his eyes. One of the crew under interrogation appears to have revealed the fact of Muir&#x27;s presence on board, and a careful search was made for his body. However, the Spanish captain insisted that Muir was among the dead and in the event he was so badly disfigured that his would-be captors failed to identify him, and he was sent ashore with the wounded. Now began a long and painful recovery, while the French and Spanish authorities, from Consular to Ambassadorial and ultimately at Ministerial level, indulged in a bitter diplomatic wrangle over Muir&#x27;s release.

==The last days in France==

Finally on 16 September 1797, the Spanish Government relented and decreed Muir&#x27;s release and perpetual banishment from Spanish territories. Still weak and emaciated from his sufferings, Muir made his way to France by way of Madrid and San Sebastian, aided and assisted by a young officer from the French Consulate at Cadiz.
In early November 1797, he arrived exhausted at Bordeaux, where he was hailed publicly as a &#x27;Hero of the French Republic&#x27; and a &#x27;Martyr of Liberty&#x27;. Feted by the civic authorities and literary societies, his last portrait, commissioned for display in public buildings, shows him with a large black patch over his left eye. The loss of his left cheekbone had caused that side of his face to droop, revealing the teeth in a perpetual grimace. Muir, weak and half blind, slowly made his way north to Paris where he arrived on 4 February 1798.

Muir&#x27;s arrival in the capital was heralded by a great outburst of popular adulation. David, the great French artist and propagandist was officially appointed to welcome him to the city, in a front page eulogy in the Government journal &quot;Le Moniteur&quot;. From the very outset, however, Muir made it abundantly clear to his benefactors that, flattered though he was by their attentions towards him, it was their intentions on behalf of his suffering countrymen which were now to be his chief concern. He associated with Thomas Paine and James Napper Tandy of the United Irishmen, from whom he learned the exciting news of the near-insurrection in Scotland over the Militia Act. During 1798 he submitted many letters and memoranda to the Directory urging them to intervene militarily on behalf of the people and thus aid them in establishing a Scottish Republic.

Muir&#x27;s chief confidant and informant during 1798 was Dr Robert Watson of Elgin, emissary to France on behalf of the United Englishmen. From him he learned for the first time details of the strength and extent of the United Scotsmen, the new revolutionary association which had replaced the Friends of the People. From Watson he also learned of the impending arrival in Paris of James Kennedy of Paisley and Angus Cameron of Blair Atholl as delegates of the new movement. Since Muir was by this time the principal intermediary between the Directory and the various republican refugees in Paris he was aware that his movements were under scrutiny by Pitt&#x27;s agents. Accordingly, in his last known communication with the Directory in October 1798, he requested permission to leave Paris for somewhere less conspicuous, where his crucial negotiations with the Scots emissaries could be conducted in safety.

Thus it was that sometime in the middle of November 1798, Muir moved incognito to the little Île-de-France village of Chantilly to await the arrival of his Scots compatriots. The only surviving documentation of his death is the record in the Chantilly town register, pictured on the right. The record, in French, is dated 7 pluviôse VII, the 26th of January 1799 in the Gregorian calendar. It states that Muir was found dead at half past six on the morning of the previous day, the 25th of January, by a boy of around twelve years old named Labussière. Muir&#x27;s name was known only by word of mouth and because a man named as Citoyen Lepauve brought him personally addressed newspapers. 

When several days later the news of Muir&#x27;s passing finally reached Paris, a brief obituary notice was inserted in l&quot;e Moniteur universel&quot; to the effect that he had died from a recurrence of his old wounds. Shortly before his death, he said:

==The Political Martyrs==

Thomas Muir was the most important of the group of two Scotsmen and three Englishmen commemorated at the Political Martyrs&#x27; Monument the others being Thomas Fyshe Palmer, William Skirving, Maurice Margarot. and Joseph Gerrald). In 1793 these men were also sentenced to transportation to Australia for sedition and for writing and publishing pamphlets on parliamentary reform.

==William Muir==

William Muir the Campsie Poet was a relative of Thomas Muir&#x27;s.

Thomas MUIR was also a cousin of William MUIR (1767–1843) a shipowner and merchant living in 1798, in Altona, Denmark (now part of Hamburg, Germany). Thomas wrote, asking William to remember him to his (Thomas&#x27;) parents, who lived in Bishopbriggs. The letter was kept by William MUIR and found in the loft of his &#x27;William MUIR, Bond 9 Distillery&#x27;, about 1815, in Leith, Scotland, where Wm. MUIRl had relocated. (ref. Christina BEWLEY, Muir of Huntershill, pg. 175)

Thomas MUIR was buried, not in the Old Chantilly Burial Ground, but outside the graveyard of the church in town, as he was not Catholic. As of 1971, this graveyard had been covered over by a parking lot. (source: Groundskeeper of Old Chantilly Burial Ground, who said people often came looking for Thomas MUIR. He knew all the people in his graveyard, and MUIR was not one of them, but had died alone,&quot;comme clochard&quot;. Site visited by Janet WHITE, 1971, a descendant of William MUIR)

==Honours==

After the Reform Act of 1832, Charles Tennant, chemical manufacturer in Glasgow, started the campaign to mark the work of Thomas Muir and his fellow reformers. After years of searching for a site to celebrate them, two large obelisks were funded by public subscription raised by the radical MP Joseph Hume and others. The first was in Edinburgh and the second in Nunhead Cemetery in South East London, unveiled in 1851.

The obelisk in the Old Calton Cemetery in Edinburgh was designed in 1844 by architect Thomas Hamilton (1784–1858) and stands high.

The monument speaks for itself:

To The Memory of Thomas Muir, Thomas Fyshe Palmer, William Skirving, Maurice Margarot and Joseph Gerrald. Erected by the Friends of Parliamentary Reform in England and Scotland, 1844.

It includes the following two quotations, the first by Muir, and the second by Skirving:

And:

The Nunhead obelisk was erected in 1837 and stands high.

A Cairn and Martyrs Gate were erected at Huntershill Village by John S. L. Watson of Huntershill and partly funded by the East Dunbartonshire Council.

John Watson and Thomas Muir Coffee Shop commissioned Bishopbriggs local artist John Spinelli to paint a series of watercolours, depicting Thomas Muir&#x27;s dramatic escape from Botany Bay and his adventures that led him to France. They&#x27;re displayed throughout the coffee shop.

There is a permanent exhibition to Thomas Muir at Bishopbriggs library, which includes a specially commissioned bust of Thomas Muir by celebrated Scottish artist Alexander Stoddart. Thomas Muir Street in Greenock is named after him. A school in Bishopbriggs, the Thomas Muir High School which opened in 1981, was named after him. It was merged with another school in 2003 to form Bishopbriggs Academy.

A mural of Thomas Muir was painted by graffiti artist ‘Rogue One’ in 2022 in the Trongate area of Glasgow.

Robert Burns wrote &quot;Scots Wha Hae&quot; on the day Muir&#x27;s trial started. The letter he wrote to George Hamilton (about 30 August 1793) with the first draft made it clear who he had in mind; Wallace was an allegory for the real hero*...

So may God defend the cause of TRUTH and LIBERTY, as he did that day! – Amen!

P.S. I shewed the air to Urbani, who was highly please with it, &amp; begged me to make soft verses for it; but I had no idea of giving myself any trouble on the subject, till the accidental recollection of that same struggle for Freedom, associated with the glowing idea&#x27;s of some other struggles of the same nature, not quite so ancient*, roused my rhyming Mania. –Clarke&#x27;s set of the tune, with his bass, you will find in the Museum; though I am afraid that the air is not what will entitle it to a place in your elegant selection. – However, I am so pleased with my verses, or more properly, the subject of my verses, that although Johnson has already given the tune a place, yet it shall appear again, set to this song, in his next &amp; last Volume.-

<doc id="491494" wikidata="Q52849" url="?curid=491494" title="Ankylosing spondylitis">
<text>Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a type of arthritis from the disease spectrum of axial spondyloarthritis. It is characterized by long-term inflammation of the joints of the spine, typically where the spine joins the pelvis. With AS, eye and bowel problems—as well as back pain—may occur. Joint mobility in the affected areas sometimes worsens over time.
Ankylosing spondylitis is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. More than 90% of people affected in the UK have a specific human leukocyte antigen known as the HLA-B27 antigen. The underlying mechanism is believed to be autoimmune or autoinflammatory. Diagnosis is based on symptoms with support from medical imaging and blood tests. AS is a type of seronegative spondyloarthropathy, meaning that tests show no presence of rheumatoid factor (RF) antibodies.

There is no cure for AS. Treatments may include medication, physical therapy, and surgery. Medication therapy focuses on relieving the pain and other symptoms of AS, as well as stopping disease progression by counteracting long-term inflammatory processes. Commonly used medications include NSAIDs, TNF inhibitors, IL-17 antagonists, and DMARDs. Glucocorticoid injections are often used for acute and localized flare-ups.

About 0.1% to 0.8% of the population are affected, with onset typically occurring in young adults. While men and women are equally affected with AS, women are more likely to experience inflammation rather than fusion.

==Signs and symptoms==

The signs and symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis often appear gradually, with peak onset between 20 and 30 years of age. Initial symptoms are usually a chronic dull pain in the lower back or gluteal region combined with stiffness of the lower back. Individuals often experience pain and stiffness that awakens them in the early morning hours.

As the disease progresses, loss of spinal mobility and chest expansion, with a limitation of anterior flexion, lateral flexion, and extension of the lumbar spine are seen. Systemic features are common with weight loss, fever, or fatigue often present. Pain is often severe at rest but may improve with physical activity. Inflammation and pain may recur to varying degrees regardless of rest and movement.

AS can occur in any part of the spine or the entire spine, often with pain localized to either buttock or the back of the thigh from the sacroiliac joint. Arthritis in the hips and shoulders may also occur. When the condition presents before the age of 18, AS is more likely to cause pain and swelling of large lower limb joints, such as the knees. In prepubescent cases, pain and swelling may also manifest in the ankles and feet where heel pain and enthesopathy commonly develop. Less common occurrences include ectasia of the sacral nerve root sheaths.

About 30% of people with AS will also experience anterior uveitis causing eye pain, redness, and blurred vision. This is thought to be due to the association that both AS and uveitis have with the presence of the HLA-B27 antigen. Cardiovascular involvement may include inflammation of the aorta, aortic valve insufficiency or disturbances of the heart&#x27;s electrical conduction system. Lung involvement is characterized by progressive fibrosis of the upper portion of the lung.

==Pathophysiology==

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a systemic rheumatic disease, meaning it affects the entire body. 1–2% of individuals with the HLA-B27 genotype develop the disease. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF α) and interleukin 1 (IL-1) are also implicated in ankylosing spondylitis. Autoantibodies specific for AS have not been identified. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) are associated with AS, but do not correlate with disease severity.

Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) A/G variant rs10440635 is close to the &quot;PTGER4&quot; gene on human chromosome 5 has been associated with an increased number of cases of AS in a population recruited from the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada. The &quot;PTGER4&quot; gene codes for the prostaglandin EP4 receptor, one of four receptors for prostaglandin E2. Activation of EP4 promotes bone remodeling and deposition (see ) and EP4 is highly expressed at vertebral column sites involved in AS. These findings suggest that excessive EP4 activation contributes to pathological bone remodeling and deposition in AS and that the A/G variant rs10440635a of &quot;PTGER4&quot; predisposes individuals to this disease, possibly by influencing EP4&#x27;s production or expression pattern.

The association of AS with HLA-B27 suggests the condition involves CD8 T cells, which interact with HLA-B. This interaction is not proven to involve a self-antigen, and at least in the related reactive arthritis, which follows infections, the antigens involved are likely to be derived from intracellular microorganisms. There is, however, a possibility that CD4+ T lymphocytes are involved in an aberrant way, since HLA-B27 appears to have a number of unusual properties, including possibly an ability to interact with T cell receptors in association with CD4 (usually CD8+ cytotoxic T cell with HLAB antigen as it is a MHC class 1 antigen).

&quot;Bamboo spine&quot; develops when the outer fibers of the fibrous ring (&quot;anulus fibrosus disci intervertebralis&quot;) of the intervertebral discs ossify, which results in the formation of marginal syndesmophytes between adjoining vertebrae.

==Diagnosis==

Ankylosing spondylitis is a member of the more broadly defined disease axial spondyloarthritis. Axial spondyloarthritis can be divided into two categories: radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (which is a synonym for ankylosing spondylitis) and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (which include less severe forms and early stages of ankylosing spondylitis).

While AS can be diagnosed through the description of radiological changes in the sacroiliac joints and spine, there are currently no direct tests (blood or imaging) to unambiguously diagnose early forms of ankylosing spondylitis (non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis). Diagnosis of non-radiologic axial spondyloarthritis is therefore more difficult and is based on the presence of several typical disease features.

These diagnostic criteria include:
* Inflammatory back pain:&lt;br&gt;Chronic, inflammatory back pain is defined when at least four out of five of the following parameters are present: (1) Age of onset below 40 years old, (2) insidious onset, (3) improvement with exercise, (4) no improvement with rest, and (5) pain at night (with improvement upon getting up). Pain often subsides as the day progresses with movement being of importance to alleviate the joint stiffness. 
* Past history of inflammation in the joints, heels, or tendon-bone attachments
* Family history for axial spondyloarthritis or other associated rheumatic/autoimmune conditions
* Positive for the biomarker HLA-B27
* Good response to treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
* Signs of elevated inflammation (C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate)
* Manifestation of psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, or inflammation of the eye (uveitis)

If these criteria still do not give a compelling diagnosis magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be useful. MRI can show inflammation of the sacroiliac joint.

===Imaging===
====X-rays====
The earliest changes demonstrable by plain X-ray shows erosions and sclerosis in sacroiliac joints. Progression of the erosions leads to widening of the joint space and bony sclerosis. X-ray spine can reveal squaring of vertebrae with bony spur formation called syndesmophyte. This causes the bamboo spine appearance. A drawback of X-ray diagnosis is the signs and symptoms of AS have usually been established as long as 7–10 years prior to X-ray-evident changes occurring on a plain film X-ray, which means a delay of as long as 10 years before adequate therapies can be introduced.

Options for earlier diagnosis are tomography and MRI of the sacroiliac joints, but the reliability of these tests is still unclear.

===Blood parameters===
During acute inflammatory periods, people with AS may show an increase in the blood concentration of CRP and an increase in the ESR, but there are many with AS whose CRP and ESR rates do not increase, so normal CRP and ESR results do not always correspond with the amount of inflammation that is actually present. In other words, some people with AS have normal levels of CRP and ESR, despite experiencing a significant amount of inflammation in their bodies.

===Genetic testing===
Variations of the HLA-B gene increase the risk of developing ankylosing spondylitis, although it is not a diagnostic test. Those with the HLA-B27 variant are at a higher risk than the general population of developing the disorder. HLA-B27, demonstrated in a blood test, can occasionally help with diagnosis, but in itself is not diagnostic of AS in a person with back pain. Over 85% of people that have been diagnosed with AS are HLA-B27 positive, although this ratio varies from population to population (about 50% of African Americans with AS possess HLA-B27 in contrast to the figure of 80% among those with AS who are of Mediterranean descent).

===BASDAI===
The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), developed in Bath (UK), is an index designed to detect the inflammatory burden of active disease. The BASDAI can help to establish a diagnosis of AS in the presence of other factors such as HLA-B27 positivity, persistent buttock pain which resolves with exercise, and X-ray or MRI-evident involvement of the sacroiliac joints. It can be easily calculated and accurately assesses the need for additional therapy; a person with AS with a score of four out of a possible 10 points while on adequate NSAID therapy is usually considered a good candidate for biologic therapy.

The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) is a functional index which can accurately assess functional impairment due to the disease, as well as improvements following therapy. The BASFI is not usually used as a diagnostic tool, but rather as a tool to establish a current baseline and subsequent response to therapy.

=== Children ===
Juvenile ankylosing spondylitis (JAS) is a rare form of the disease which differs from the more common adult form. Enthesophathy and arthritis of large joints of the lower extremities is more common than the characteristic early-morning back pain seen in adult AS. Ankylosing tarsitis of the ankle is a common feature, as is the more classical findings of seronegative ANA and RF as well as presence of the HLA-B27 allele. Primary engagement of the appendicular joints may explain delayed diagnosis; however, other common symptoms of AS such as uveitis, diarrhea, pulmonary disease and heart valve disease may lead suspicion away from other juvenile spondyloarthropathies.

===Schober&#x27;s test===
The Schober&#x27;s test is a useful clinical measure of flexion of the lumbar spine performed during the physical examination.

==Treatment==
There is no cure for AS, but treatments and medications can reduce symptoms and pain.

===Medication===
Medications for AS may be broadly considered either &quot;disease-modifying&quot; or &quot;non-disease-modifying&quot;. Disease-modifying medications for ankylosing spondylitis aim to slow disease progression and include drugs like tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. Non-disease-modifying medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), primarily address symptoms like pain and inflammation but do not alter the course of the disease.

==== NSAIDs ====
Unless otherwise contraindicated, all people with AS are recommended to take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The dose, frequency, and specific drug may depend on the individual and the symptoms they experience. NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, are used to alleviate pain, reduce inflammation, and improve joint stiffness associated with AS. These medications work by inhibiting the activity of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which are involved in the production of inflammatory prostaglandins. By reducing the levels of prostaglandins, NSAIDs help mitigate the inflammatory response and relieve symptoms in individuals with ankylosing spondylitis.

==== TNF inhibitors ====
Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) are a class of biologic drugs used in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis. TNFi drugs, such as etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, and golimumab, target the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). TNF-alpha plays a key role in the inflammatory process in ankylosing spondylitis. By blocking TNF-alpha, TNFi drugs help reduce inflammation, pain, and stiffness associated with AS, and may also slow down the progression of spinal damage.

==== Non-TNFi biologics ====
Non-TNFi &quot;biologic&quot; drugs used in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis include drugs that target different pathways involved in the inflammatory process. Two of the most important drugs in this class target IL-17, an important part of the inflammatory system: secukinumab and ixekizumab. They are often considered in cases where TNFi drugs are not effective or cause too many side effects. Additionally, they may sometimes be used as an adjunct to a TNFi when symptoms persist, but improve, while the patient is on the TNFi. The choice of a specific non-TNFi biologic depends on various factors, including the patient&#x27;s medical history, preferences, and the recommendations of the healthcare provider.

Ustekinumab has frequently been used as a second-line therapy for AS, but it has recently been scrutinized for a lack of efficacy, and is no longer recommended.

==== Biosimilar drugs ====
Biosimilar drugs are biological products that are highly similar to an already approved biologic drug, with few or no clinically meaningful differences in terms of safety, purity, and potency. These drugs are developed to be equivalent to the reference biologic, often at a lower cost, providing alternative treatment options. In the context of ankylosing spondylitis, biosimilars are typically used as alternatives to the original biologic drugs. Biosimilars for ankylosing spondylitis may include versions of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors or other biologics commonly used in the treatment of the condition. When possible, physicians are recommended to use the original drugs over the biosimilar versions. Even biosimilars with perfect replication of the quality, composition, and other properties of the original drug are susceptible to nocebo effects.

==== csARDs ====
Conventional synthetic antirheumatic drugs (csARDs) are a class of disease-modifying medications. Unlike biologics or targeted synthetic drugs, which act on specific pathways in the immune system, csARDs have a broader effect on the immune system and are often considered traditional or conventional treatments. The most common drugs in this class are methotrexate and sulfasalazine. These medications are only used when others fail, or when certain specific conditions are met, and are often discontinued if a patient&#x27;s symptoms become manageable with just a TNFi or other medication. Conventional DMARDs such as leflunomide are also considered to be part of this class.

Concerns exist about a possible lack of efficacy of some drugs in this class.

==== Corticosteroids ====
Glucocorticoids, such as prednisone or methylprednisolone, are sometimes used in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis to manage acute flares and provide short-term relief from inflammation and symptoms. They are powerful anti-inflammatory medications that can help reduce pain, swelling, and stiffness associated with AS. However, glucocorticoids are generally not recommended for long-term use. They are more commonly used as localized injections when someone with AS has a temporary pain flare in a particular joint or area.

===Surgery===
In severe cases of AS, surgery can be an option in the form of joint replacements, particularly in the knees and hips. Surgical correction is also possible for those with severe flexion deformities (severe downward curvature) of the spine, particularly in the neck, although this procedure is considered very risky. In addition, AS can have some manifestations that make anesthesia more complex. Changes in the upper airway can lead to difficulties in intubating the airway, spinal and epidural anesthesia may be difficult owing to calcification of ligaments, and a small number of people have aortic insufficiency. The stiffness of the thoracic ribs results in ventilation being mainly diaphragm-driven, so there may also be a decrease in pulmonary function.

===Physical therapy===
Though physical therapy remedies have been scarcely documented, some therapeutic exercises are used to help manage lower back, neck, knee, and shoulder pain. There is moderate quality evidence that therapeutic exercise programs help reduce pain and improve function. Therapeutic exercises include:
* Exercise programs, either at home or supervised
* Low intensity aerobic exercise, e.g. Pilates
* Spa-exercise therapy
* Aquatic physical therapy
* Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF)
* Heat therapy
* Cryotherapy in conjunction with exercise

===Diet===
Research by Alan Ebringer at King&#x27;s College in London, beginning in the 1980s, implicates overgrowth of the bacterium &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot; in the symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis. The body produces antibodies that attack &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot;. Enzymes made by the bacterium resemble human proteins, including three types of collagen (I, III, IV) and the HLA-B27 complex of glycoproteins. The antibodies therefore attack these human proteins, producing the symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis. Ebringer and others recommend low-starch or no-starch diets.

==Prognosis==

Prognosis is related to disease severity. AS can range from mild to progressively debilitating and from medically controlled to refractory. Some cases may have times of active inflammation followed by times of remission resulting in minimal disability while others never have times of remission and have acute inflammation and pain, leading to significant disability. As the disease progresses, it can cause the vertebrae and the lumbosacral joint to ossify, resulting in the fusion of the spine. This places the spine in a vulnerable state because it becomes one bone, which causes it to lose its range of motion as well as putting it at risk for spinal fractures. This not only limits mobility but reduces the affected person&#x27;s quality of life. Complete fusion of the spine can lead to a reduced range of motion and increased pain, as well as total joint destruction which could lead to a joint replacement.

Osteoporosis is common in ankylosing spondylitis, both from chronic systemic inflammation and decreased mobility resulting from AS. Over a long-term period, osteopenia or osteoporosis of the AP spine may occur, causing eventual compression fractures and a back &quot;hump&quot;. Hyperkyphosis from ankylosing spondylitis can also lead to impairment in mobility and balance, as well as impaired peripheral vision, which increases the risk of falls which can cause fracture of already-fragile vertebrae. Typical signs of progressed AS are the visible formation of syndesmophytes on X-rays and abnormal bone outgrowths similar to osteophytes affecting the spine. In compression fractures of the vertebrae, paresthesia is a complication due to the inflammation of the tissue surrounding nerves.

Organs commonly affected by AS, other than the axial spine and other joints, are the heart, lungs, eyes, colon, and kidneys. Other complications are aortic regurgitation, Achilles tendinitis, AV node block, and amyloidosis. Owing to lung fibrosis, chest X-rays may show apical fibrosis, while pulmonary function testing may reveal a restrictive lung defect. Very rare complications involve neurologic conditions such as the cauda equina syndrome.

===Mortality===
Mortality is increased in people with AS and circulatory disease is the most frequent cause of death. People with AS have an increased risk of 60% for cerebrovascular mortality, and an overall increased risk of 50% for vascular mortality. About one third of those with ankylosing spondylitis have severe disease, which reduces life expectancy.

As increased mortality in ankylosing spondylitis is related to disease severity, factors negatively affecting outcomes include:
* Male sex
* Plus three of the following in the first two years of disease:
** Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) &gt;30 mm/h
** Unresponsive to NSAIDs
** Limitation of lumbar spine range of motion
** Sausage-like fingers or toes
** Oligoarthritis
** Onset &lt;16 years old

===Gait===
The hunched position that often results from complete spinal fusion can have an effect on a person&#x27;s gait. Increased spinal kyphosis will lead to a forward and downward shift in center of mass (COM). This shift in COM has been shown to be compensated by increased knee flexion and ankle dorsiflexion. The gait of someone with ankylosing spondylitis often has a cautious pattern because they have decreased ability to absorb shock, and they cannot see the horizon.

==Epidemiology==
Between 0.1% and 0.8% of people are affected. The disease is most common in Northern European countries, and seen least in people of Afro-Caribbean descent. Although the ratio of male to female disease is reportedly 3:1, many rheumatologists believe the number of women with AS is underdiagnosed, as most women tend to experience milder cases of the disease. The majority of people with AS, including 95 per cent of people of European descent with the disease, express the HLA-B27 antigen and high levels of immunoglobulin A (IgA) in the blood. In 2007, a team of researchers discovered two genes that may contribute to the cause of AS: ARTS-1 and IL23R. Together with HLA-B27, these two genes account for roughly 70 percent of the overall number of cases of the disease.

==History==

Ankylosing spondylitis was distinguished from rheumatoid arthritis by Galen as early as the 2nd century AD. Skeletal evidence of the disease (ossification of joints and entheses primarily of the axial skeleton, known as &quot;bamboo spine&quot;) was thought to be found in the skeletal remains of a 5000-year-old Egyptian mummy with evidence of bamboo spine. However, a subsequent report found that this was not the case.

The anatomist and surgeon Realdo Colombo described what could have been the disease in 1559, and the first account of pathologic changes to a skeleton possibly associated with AS was published in 1691 by Bernard Connor. In 1818, Benjamin Brodie became the first physician to document a person believed to have active AS who also had accompanying iritis.

In 1858, David Tucker published a small booklet which clearly described the case of Leonard Trask, who had severe spinal deformity subsequent to AS. In 1833, Trask fell from a horse, exacerbating the condition and resulting in severe deformity. Tucker reported:

The account of Trask became the first documented case of AS in the United States, owing to its indisputable description of inflammatory disease characteristics of AS and the hallmark of deforming injury in AS.

In the late nineteenth century, the neurophysiologist Vladimir Bekhterev of Russia in 1893, Adolf Strümpell of Germany in 1897, and Pierre Marie of France in 1898 were the first to give adequate descriptions which permitted an accurate diagnosis of AS prior to severe spinal deformity. For this reason, AS is also known as Bekhterev disease, Bechterew&#x27;s disease or Marie–Strümpell disease.

The word is from Greek &quot;ankylos&quot; meaning crooked, curved or rounded, &quot;spondylos&quot; meaning vertebra, and &quot;-itis&quot; meaning inflammation.

Sackville-West was the fourth son of George Sackville-West, 5th Earl De La Warr and Elizabeth Sackville-West, Countess De La Warr and 1st Baroness Buckhurst, younger daughter and co-heir of John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset. On the death of the latter&#x27;s cousin, Charles Sackville-Germain, 5th Duke of Dorset, in 1845, the dukedom and its subsidiary titles became extinct and the Sackville estates passed through Elizabeth to the West family who assumed the additional surname of Sackville by Royal licence. By arrangement, Mortimer Sackville-West succeeded to a substantial part of the estates, including Knole in Kent, which is still the seat of the Barons Sackville.

He was succeeded in the barony according to the special remainder by his brother Lionel, who became the second Baron. He had no legitimate male issue and, on his death, the title passed to his nephew, the third Baron. He was the son of the aforementioned William Edward. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Baron. He was a major-general in the army. On his death the title passed to his son, the fifth Baron, and then to the latter&#x27;s cousin, the sixth Baron. He was the eldest son of the Hon. Bertrand George Sackville-West, youngest brother of the fourth Baron. the title is held by his nephew, the seventh Baron, who succeeded in 2004. He is the son of Hugh Rosslyn Inigo Sackville-West, younger brother of the sixth Baron.

The poet Vita Sackville-West was the daughter of the third Baron and his wife Victoria Sackville-West, daughter of the second Baron.

<doc id="491503" wikidata="Q2466903" url="?curid=491503" title="Hannibal Sehested (governor)">
<text>Hannibal Sehested (1609 – 23 September 1666) was a Dano-Norwegian statesman and son-in-law of King Christian IV. He served as Governor-general of Norway from 1642 to 1651. He fought in the Torstenson War against Sweden and implemented many reforms in Norway. After a fall from grace leading to his resignation as Governor-general in 1651, he regained the trust of Frederick III in 1660 and negotiated the Treaty of Copenhagen. He worked as lord treasurer and councillor of state until his death in 1666.

==Early life==
Sehested was born at Arensborg Castle on Øsel, in Danish Estonia, as the son of Claus Maltesen Sehested (1558–1612) and Anne Nielsdatter Lykke (1568–1645). He was named after his maternal uncle Hannibal Mogensen Gyldenstjerne of Restrup. He attended the Sorø Academy from 1626 to 1629, and then studied abroad in Germany, Holland, France and England from 1629 to 1639. After completing his education abroad, he returned to Denmark and was attached to the court of King Christian IV. In 1639 he was granted the fiefdom of Tranekær, and in 1640 he received the far more lucrative Båhus fiefdom in Norway and was also appointed member of the Danish National Council.

In 1640 and 1641 he was sent to Wismar to negotiate a treaty with the Swedish chancellor, Axel Oxenstierna, and, if possible, to bring about the marriage of Christian&#x27;s son Frederick and Gustavus Adolphus&#x27;s daughter Christina. Though failing in both particulars, he retained the favor of the king, who had marked him out as a son-in-law, one of seven by whose influence he hoped to increase the influence of the crown. Accordingly, in 1636 he was betrothed to one of the daughters, the countess Christine, then aged nine, whom he married in 1642.

In May 1640, Sehested became a member of the Rigsråd in Denmark. He believed that the proper field for the exercise of his talents was diplomacy, and he openly aspired to be minister of foreign affairs. Despite a successful embassy to Spain in 1640–1641, he did not obtain the coveted post, but was appointed Governor-General of Norway.

==Governor-general of Norway under Christian IV==
In April 1642 he was appointed Governor-General of Norway, where he served until 1651. He now had the opportunity of displaying his administrative and organizing abilities, united with a remarkable zeal for reform. He made it his main objective to develop Norway&#x27;s material resources, reorganize the army, fortifications and fiscal system; and he aimed at giving the country a more independent position in the union with Denmark.

=== The Hannibal War===
During Christian IV&#x27;s second war with Sweden (1643–1645), Sehested, as Governor-general of Norway, assisted his father-in-law materially. He invaded Sweden four times; successfully defended Norway from attack; and, though without any particular military talent, won an engagement at Nysaker in 1644. The war was unpopular with Norway and was referred to in Norway as the Hannibal war. Concerns centered around high taxes required to support the army and the concern that Sweden would be induced to invade Norway. Although Norwegian forces suffered no defeats, as part of the peace settlement, Jemtland and Herjedalen, both Norwegian provinces, were ceded to Sweden by Denmark-Norway with Sehested&#x27;s acquiescence.

After the war he renewed his reforming efforts, and during the years 1646–1647 strove to withdraw his governorship from the benumbing influence of the central administration at Copenhagen, and succeeded with the help of Christian IV in creating a separate defensive fleet for Norway and giving her partial control of her own finances. He was considerably assisted in his endeavours by the fact that Norway was regarded as the hereditary possession of the Kings of Denmark-Norway.
 As Governor-general of Norway, he was the virtual ruler of Norway during the two months which elapsed between the death of Christian IV and the election of Frederick III (6 July 1648).

===Fall from favor===
At the same time, Sehested freely used his immense wealth and official position to accumulate for himself property and privileges of all sorts. His successes finally excited the envy and disapprobation of the Danish Rigsraad, especially of his rival, Korfits Ulfeldt, also one of the king&#x27;s sons-in-law. The quarrel became acute when Sehested&#x27;s semi-independent administration of the finances of Norway infringed upon Ulfeldt&#x27;s functions as lord treasurer of the whole realm. In November 1647, Ulfeldt carried his point, and a decree was issued that henceforth the Norwegian leaders should send their rents and taxes direct to Copenhagen.

==Governor-general of Norway under Frederick III ==
On the accession of Frederick III (1648) to the throne, Sehested strove hard to win his favor, but an investigation into his accounts as governor conducted by his enemies brought to light such wholesale embezzlement and peculation that he was summoned to appear before a &quot;herredag&quot;, or assembly of notables in May 1651 to give an account of his whole administration. Unable to meet the charges brought against him, he compromised matters by resigning his governorship and his senatorship, and surrendering all his private property in Norway to the crown.

==After the fall==
Throughout his trial, Sehested had shown prudence. He gave back three times what he had embezzled. Calculating on the sympathy of Frederick III for a man of his monarchical tendencies, he had nothing to do with the projects of revenge which were the ruin of Korfits Ulfeldt. From 1651 to 1660, he lived abroad. At the end of 1655, he met the exiled Charles II of England at Cologne and lived a part of the following year with him in the Spanish Netherlands.
In the summer of 1657, he returned to Denmark, but Frederick III refused to receive him, and he hastily quit Copenhagen. During the crisis of the Second Northern War of 1658, he was at the headquarters of Charles X of Sweden. In seeking the help and protection of the worst enemy of his country, Sehested approached the very verge of treason, but he never quite went beyond it. When, at last, it seemed probable that the war would not result in the annihilation of Denmark-Norway, Sehested strained every nerve to secure his own future by working in the interests of his native land while still residing in Sweden.

==The final years==
In April 1660, he obtained permission from Frederick III to come to Copenhagen and was finally instructed by him to negotiate with the Swedes. The Treaty of Copenhagen, which saved the honour of Denmark-Norway and brought her repose, was very largely Sehested&#x27;s work. He was one of the willing abettors of Frederick III during the emergency of 1660, when he re-entered the Danish-Norwegian service as lord treasurer and councilor of state. Both at home and on his frequent foreign missions, he displayed all his old ability. Politically, he played a major role in those years within the queen Sophie Amalie&#x27;s party, which included men like Jacob Petersen. He was challenged by new rivals like Kristoffer Gabel and his influence seems to have been somewhat fading during his last years but he remained in office until his death. As a diplomat, he in some ways anticipated the views of Peter, count Griffenfeldt, supporting the policy of friendship with Sweden and a French alliance. He died suddenly in Paris, where he was conducting important negotiations. His political testament is perhaps the best testimony to his liberal and statesmanlike views.

<text>George Mealmaker (10 February 1768 – 30 March 1808) was a Scottish radical organiser and writer, born in Dundee, Scotland. Like his father before him he was a weaver by trade.

==Liberty==
He was born in the Seagate district of Dundee in 1768 the son of a handloom weaver and became a weaver himself around 1780.

In the late 1780s Mealmaker, along with Thomas Fyshe Palmer formed the &quot;Dundee Friends of Liberty&quot; group, Mealmaker becoming head of the group from 1796. In 1793 Mealmaker wrote &quot;Dundee Address to the Friends of Liberty&quot; in which he criticised the British government, for which Palmer was arrested as being the writer. Despite Mealmaker admitting that it was he, and not Palmer who had written the pamphlet the court found Palmer guilty on the grounds that he had prepared the text for publication and circulated it, and sentenced him to 14 years penal transportation.

Other persons arrested in relations to the political activities of the Edinburgh Society of the Friends of the People and associated groups like The Dundee Friends of Liberty were Thomas Muir, William Skirving, Maurice Margarot and Joseph Gerrald. These five were transported to Australia in 1794 and 1795 and were collectively known as the Scottish Martyrs to Liberty.

==Transported==
Mealmaker continued his radical activities and became involved in the Society of the United Scotsmen. He continued to write treatises critical of the government and in 1797 he wrote &quot;The Moral and Political Catechism of Man&quot; for which he was arrested. Tried at the High Court of Justiciary in Edinburgh by David Rae, Lord Eskgrove on 10/11 January 1798 for sedition and found guilty, he was transported for 14 years to Australia.

This ended a short married life with Marjory Thoms (died c. 1843) of Dundee, whom he had married in 1795 and by whom he had two daughters.

Mealmaker&#x27;s skills were needed in the colony, and he was put in charge of a weaving factory in Parramatta by Governor King. For several years he did well, and was granted a conditional pardon and other rewards. The next Governor, William Bligh, did not place the same value on developing weaving, a fire partly destroyed the factory in 1807, and Mealmaker died destitute in 1808, of alcoholic suffocation.

==Outlook==
Mealmaker&#x27;s &quot;political ideology and outlook, which were formed from an amalgam of Paineite republicanism, radical Presbyterianism, and a commitment to religious freedom and democratic parliamentary reform, distanced him from the mainstream of Scottish radicalism of this period.&quot;

<text>Baron Strathspey, of Strathspey in the Counties of Inverness and Moray, is a title that has been created twice, both times in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. On both occasions, the barony was created for an Earl of Seafield.

==History==
===Barons Strathspey, first creation (1858)===
It was created for the first time on 14 August 1858 for John Ogilvy-Grant, 7th Earl of Seafield (see the Earl of Seafield for earlier history of this title). This creation became extinct on the death of his son, the eighth Earl and second Baron, in 1884.

===Barons Strathspey, second creation (1884)===
The barony was revived only a few months after it first became extinct in favour of the late Earl&#x27;s uncle, James Ogilvy-Grant, 9th Earl of Seafield (who had also succeeded him in the baronetcy of Colquhoun; see Colquhoun baronets for earlier history of this title). The barony and baronetcy remained subsidiary titles of the earldom until the death of the ninth Earl&#x27;s grandson, the eleventh Earl, in 1915. The earldom, which could be passed on to female heirs, was inherited by the Earl&#x27;s daughter and only child, the twelfth Countess (see the Earl of Seafield for later history of the earldom).

The baronetcy and barony of Strathspey, which could only be inherited by males, were passed on to the Earl&#x27;s brother, the fourth Baron. His son, the fifth Baron, was confirmed in the surname of Grant of Grant by decree of the Lord Lyon in 1950. the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s younger son, the seventh Baron, who succeeded in 2023.

<text>Baron St Levan, of St Michael&#x27;s Mount in the County of Cornwall, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 4 July 1887 for the former Member of Parliament Sir John St Aubyn, 2nd Baronet, becoming John St Aubyn, 1st Baron St Levan. He had previously represented Cornwall West in House of Commons as a Liberal and St Ives as a Liberal Unionist. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Baron, who was a Colonel and Honorary Brigadier-General in the Grenadier Guards. On his death the titles passed to his nephew, the third Baron, the son of the Hon. Sir Arthur James Dudley Stuart St Aubyn (1867–1897), second son of the first Baron. The third baron was succeeded in 1978 by his eldest son, the fourth baron, who had served with the Royal Navy at Dunkirk and in a minesweeper in Arctic Convoys during World War II and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC). As of 2014, the titles are held by the fourth Baron&#x27;s nephew, the fifth Baron, who succeeded in 2013.

The St Aubyn Baronetcy, of St Michael&#x27;s Mount in the County of Cornwall, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom in 1866 for the first Baron&#x27;s father, Edward St Aubyn. He was the illegitimate son of Sir John St Aubyn, 5th Baronet, of Clowance, on whose death in 1839 the St Aubyn baronetcy of Clowance, created in the Baronetage of England in 1671, had become extinct (see St Aubyn Baronets).

The family seat is St Michael&#x27;s Mount, Cornwall.

<text>Baron Sinha, of Raipur in the Presidency of Bengal, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1919 for Sir Satyendra Prasanna Sinha, a distinguished barrister and &quot;zamindar&quot; who was the first (and only) Indian ever to be elevated to the hereditary peerage.

==History==
A distinguished Calcutta (now Kolkata) barrister, the 1st Baron Sinha was the first Indian to be appointed Advocate-General of Bengal in 1905. Four years later, he became the first Indian to be appointed to the Viceroy&#x27;s Executive Council. In 1917, he became an assistant to the then-Secretary of State for India, Edwin Montagu, at the Imperial War Conference. He was raised to the peerage two years later, in part due to the perceived need for an Indian representative to steer India-related legislation through the House of Lords. There was controversy over the succession on his death in 1928. He ought to have been succeeded in his title by his first son, Arun Kumar Sinha. However, Arun Kumar had been born at a time when there was no system of registration of births and marriages in India, so he was unable to prove his claim to the title to the satisfaction of the House of Lords at that time.

In 1936, Arun Kumar Sinha, 2nd Baron Sinha, presented a petition for a writ of summons to the House of Lords. The petition was referred to the Committee for Privileges on 27 June 1938, and a Commission was appointed to take evidence in Calcutta, on this birth and marriage. Ultimately, on 25 July 1939, the Committee for Privileges decided that Lord Sinha had succeeded in his claim. The decision remarks that the decision was not precedent for a peer who had legally married two wives (at the same time), and that there is no British law on heirship in the case of a polygamous marriage; but in this case that difficulty did not arise - and in fact the first Lord Sinha had belonged to the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj, a variety of Hinduism which required monogamy. Having fully established his claim, Arun Kumar, now confirmed as the second Lord Sinha, was subsequently issued a writ of summons directing him to take his seat in the House of Lords. Owing to the Second World War, however, he was unable to attend Parliament until 1 August 1945, when he was finally sworn in and signed the Register of Peers. More controversy followed in the early 1950s, when he was refused a British passport: eventually, in 1955, he was issued with a passport which described him as a British subject. He continued to regularly attend sessions and speak in the House of Lords until his death in 1967.

Upon the death of the 2nd baron, the title passed to his elder son, Sudhindra Prasanna Sinha, who took his seat in the House of Lords as the 3rd Baron Sinha on 18 June 1969. The 3rd Baron Sinha, who unlike his father and grandfather pursued a business career, only infrequently attended sessions of the Lords as he served as chairman of general merchants and holding company Macneill &amp; Barry (now post its acquisition Williamson Magor) and as a director of several Kolkata-based firms, including the &quot;Statesman&quot;. Reportedly, he and his son and heir, Susanta Prasanna Sinha, only spoke English and not Bengali.

In the early morning of 28 November 1978, a mysterious fire broke out in the 24-room Sinha family mansion at 7 Lord Sinha Road in Kolkata; it took about two hours for a police constable in the neighbouring barracks to see the flames and alert the Sinha family and emergency personnel. When the fire brigade arrived, they discovered the burnt corpses of Shane Patrick Sinha, the four-year old heir presumptive to the peerage, and his three-year-old sister Sharon. Both were the younger children of the heir to the peerage, the Susanta Prasanna Sinha. Then aged 25, Susanta had been a keyboards player in a Kolkata cafe&#x27; during his teens before becoming a tea broker. In 1972, he married Patricia Orchard, an Anglo-Indian from a working-class family in Kolkata. The marriage reportedly met with strong disapproval from the Sinha family, and they never accepted Patricia or the three children she had with Sushanta as members of their family. Patricia soon alleged her husband to be a drug addict and pyromaniac who made at least three attempts to set fires at his place of work, at a hotel where the couple had once stayed and at their flat. In February 1978, the couple separated, with Patricia returning to her parents&#x27; home with their eldest child and daughter. The remaining two children continued to live with their father and his family, though Patricia later alleged they &quot;led a dog&#x27;s life,&quot; reportedly never being allowed to sleep in a bed, only on the floor of a room. Investigators and emergency personnel who arrived at the Sinha mansion after the fire were struck by the surviving family&#x27;s apparent indifference to the fire or to the deaths of the two children. Although the Sinhas alleged the blaze had been caused by a short circuit, a fire investigator&#x27;s report noted the heat of the blaze had been &quot;most intense&quot; at the spot where the two bodies were found, and that the fire had most likely originated there; the report further noted the victims of the fire had apparently not made any attempt to escape. As a result, on 6 December 1978 the Kolkata police charged both Susanta Prasanna Sinha and his sister Manjula Dorje Sinha with murder by arson and tampering with evidence. Both siblings however were acquitted in the subsequent trial, with the fire controversially deemed to have been accidental.

Following the tragedy and scandal, and having retired in 1977, the 3rd baron retreated into a quiet life with his wife and their children. In reduced circumstances by 1988 and being forced to rent out the lower two floors of the family mansion, he granted an interview that year to a journalist from the &quot;Illustrated Weekly of India&quot;, during which he described the modern Kolkata and India as &quot;absolutely alien to anything I&#x27;ve ever known.&quot; He further noted his peerage had little relevance for a republican Indian government, which &quot;didn&#x27;t particularly wish for an Indian representative in the House of Lords&quot; who would not be working in tandem with the Indian government, and that India had its own representation in the United Kingdom through its High Commission.

The 3rd baron died the following year, in 1989. He was succeeded by his son Susanta Prasanna Sinha as the 4th Baron Sinha, though the latter did not file a formal claim to the peerage. The 4th baron died young and without male issue three years later, upon which the direct male line failed.

The 4th baron was succeeded in the barony by his uncle Aninda Kumar Sinha as the 5th baron Sinha, a retired sales manager and the younger son of the second baron. Prior to the death of the 4th baron, however, it was thought that his uncle, the heir presumptive, had predeceased his nephew, possibly without heirs. Desiring to keep his new status a secret, the new Lord Sinha did not register his claim with the British authorities. In 1996, the 4th baron&#x27;s sister Anjana Lahiri notified the British press that her uncle was still alive and resident in the UK. He was duly recognized as the 5th Baron Sinha, but continued to refuse his claim to the peerage.

On the death of the 5th baron in 1999, the rights to the title passed to his elder son Arup Kumar Sinha, &quot;de jure&quot; the present 6th Baron Sinha. The said Arup Kumar Sinha is a British citizen and was brought up in Britain. He inherited the right to sit in the House of Lords on 18 January 1999 but lost it on 11 November 1999 as a result of the House of Lords Act 1999. He however does not appear on the Roll of the Peerage; as a result, he may not use the title in an official capacity until he registers with the College of Arms and provides the necessary documentation to be listed on the roll. The 6th baron Sinha continues to claim the title as of 2015.

As of 2005, the 6th Baron Sinha was working as a travel agent.

<text>A pandiagonal magic square or panmagic square (also diabolic square, diabolical square or diabolical magic square) is a magic square with the additional property that the broken diagonals, i.e. the diagonals that wrap round at the edges of the square, also add up to the magic constant.

A pandiagonal magic square remains pandiagonally magic not only under rotation or reflection, but also if a row or column is moved from one side of the square to the opposite side. As such, an formula_1 pandiagonal magic square can be regarded as having formula_2 orientations.

==3×3 pandiagonal magic squares==
It can be shown that non-trivial pandiagonal magic squares of order 3 do not exist. Suppose the square
:formula_3
is pandiagonally magic with magic constant . Adding sums and results in . Subtracting and we get . 
However, if we move the third column in front and perform the same argument, we obtain . In fact, using the symmetries of 3 × 3 magic squares, all cells must equal . Therefore, all 3 × 3 pandiagonal magic squares must be trivial.

However, if the magic square concept is generalized to include geometric shapes instead of numbers – the geometric magic squares discovered by Lee Sallows – a 3 × 3 pandiagonal magic square does exist.

==4×4 pandiagonal magic squares==
The smallest non-trivial pandiagonal magic squares are 4 × 4 squares. All 4 × 4 pandiagonal magic squares must be translationally symmetric to the form

Since each 2 × 2 subsquare sums to the magic constant, 4 × 4 pandiagonal magic squares are most-perfect magic squares. In addition, the two numbers at the opposite corners of any 3 × 3 square add up to half the magic constant. Consequently, all 4 × 4 pandiagonal magic squares that are associative must have duplicate cells.

All 4 × 4 pandiagonal magic squares using numbers 1-16 without duplicates are obtained by letting equal 1; letting , , , and equal 1, 2, 4, and 8 in some order; and applying some translation. For example, with , , , and , we have the magic square

The number of 4 × 4 pandiagonal magic squares using numbers 1-16 without duplicates is 384 (16 times 24, where 16 accounts for the translation and 24 accounts for the 4! ways to assign 1, 2, 4, and 8 to , , , and ).

==5×5 pandiagonal magic squares==
There are many 5 × 5 pandiagonal magic squares. Unlike 4 × 4 pandiagonal magic squares, these can be associative. The following is a 5 × 5 associative pandiagonal magic square:

In addition to the rows, columns, and diagonals, a 5 × 5 pandiagonal magic square also shows its magic constant in four &quot;quincunx&quot; patterns, which in the above example are:

: 17+25+13+1+9 = 65 (center plus adjacent row and column squares)
: 21+7+13+19+5 = 65 (center plus the remaining row and column squares)
: 4+10+13+16+22 = 65 (center plus diagonally adjacent squares)
: 20+2+13+24+6 = 65 (center plus the remaining squares on its diagonals)

Each of these quincunxes can be translated to other positions in the square by cyclic permutation of the rows and columns (wrapping around), which in a pandiagonal magic square does not affect the equality of the magic constants. This leads to 100 quincunx sums, including broken quincunxes analogous to broken diagonals.

The quincunx sums can be proved by taking linear combinations of the row, column, and diagonal sums. Consider the pandiagonal magic square
:formula_4
with magic constant . To prove the quincunx sum formula_5 (corresponding to the 20+2+13+24+6 = 65 example given above), we can add together the following:
: 3 times each of the diagonal sums formula_6 and formula_7,
: The diagonal sums formula_8, formula_9, formula_10, and formula_11,
: The row sums formula_12 and formula_13.
From this sum, subtract the following:
: The row sums formula_14 and formula_15,
: The column sum formula_16,
: Twice each of the column sums formula_17 and formula_18.

The net result is formula_19, which divided by 5 gives the quincunx sum. Similar linear combinations can be constructed for the other quincunx patterns formula_20, formula_21, and formula_22.

== (4&quot;n&quot;+2)×(4&quot;n&quot;+2) pandiagonal magic squares with nonconsecutive elements ==
No pandiagonal magic square exists of order formula_23 if consecutive integers are used. But certain sequences of nonconsecutive integers do admit order-(formula_23) pandiagonal magic squares.

Consider the sum 1+2+3+5+6+7 = 24. This sum can be divided in half by taking the appropriate groups of three addends, or in thirds using groups of two addends:

: 1+5+6 = 2+3+7 = 12

: 1+7 = 2+6 = 3+5 = 8

An additional equal partitioning of the sum of squares guarantees the semi-bimagic property noted below:

: 12 + 52 + 62 = 22 + 32 + 72 = 62

Note that the consecutive integer sum 1+2+3+4+5+6 = 21, an odd sum, lacks the half-partitioning.

With both equal partitions available, the numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 can be arranged into 6 × 6 pandigonal patterns and , respectively given by:

Then formula_25 (where is the magic square with 1 for all cells) gives the nonconsecutive pandiagonal 6 × 6 square:

with a maximum element of 49 and a pandiagonal magic constant of 150.
This square is pandiagonal and semi-bimagic, that means that 
rows, columns, main diagonals and broken diagonals have a sum of 150 and, if we square all the numbers in the square, only the rows and the columns are magic and have a sum of 5150.

For 10th order a similar construction is possible using the equal partitionings of the sum 1+2+3+4+5+9+10+11+12+13 = 70:

: 1+3+9+10+12 = 2+4+5+11+13 = 35

: 1+13 = 2+12 = 3+11 = 4+10 = 5+9 = 14

: 12 + 32 + 92 + 102 + 122 = 22 + 42 + 52 + 112 + 132 = 335 (equal partitioning of squares; semi-bimagic property)

This leads to squares having a maximum element of 169 and a pandiagonal magic constant of 850, which are also semi-bimagic with each row or column sum of squares equal to 102,850.

==(6&quot;n&quot;±1)×(6&quot;n&quot;±1) pandiagonal magic squares==

A formula_26 pandiagonal magic square can be built by the following algorithm.
==4&quot;n&quot;×4&quot;n&quot; pandiagonal magic squares==

A formula_27 pandiagonal magic square can be built by the following algorithm.

If we build a formula_27 pandiagonal magic square with this algorithm then every formula_29 square in the formula_27 square will have the same sum. Therefore, many symmetric patterns of formula_31 cells have the same sum as any row and any column of the formula_27 square. Especially each formula_33 and each formula_34 rectangle will have the same sum as any row and any column of the formula_27 square. The formula_27 square is also a most-perfect magic square.

== (6&quot;n&quot;+3)×(6&quot;n&quot;+3) pandiagonal magic squares ==
A formula_37 pandiagonal magic square can be built by the following algorithm.

<doc id="491530" wikidata="Q3362997" url="?curid=491530" title="Trilby">
<text>A trilby is a narrow-brimmed type of hat. The trilby was once viewed as the rich man&#x27;s favored hat; it is sometimes called the &quot;brown trilby&quot; in Britain and was frequently seen at the horse races. 

The traditional London hat company Lock and Co. describes the trilby as having a &quot;shorter brim which is angled down at the front and slightly turned up at the back&quot; compared to the fedora&#x27;s &quot;wider brim which is more level&quot;. The trilby also has a slightly shorter crown than a typical fedora design.

==History==
The hat&#x27;s name derives from the stage adaptation of George du Maurier&#x27;s 1894 novel &quot;Trilby&quot;. A hat of this style was worn in the first London production of the play, and promptly came to be called &quot;a &quot;Trilby&quot; hat&quot;. 
Its shape somewhat resembles the Tyrolean hat.

 Traditionally it was made from rabbit hair felt, but now is usually made from other materials, such as tweed, straw, heavyweight cotton, wool and wool/nylon blends. 

The hat reached its zenith of popularity in the late 1950s and early 1960s; the lower head clearance in post-war American automobiles made it impractical to wear a hat with a tall crown while driving, while also blending in better with the sleeker Italian-inspired tailoring of the time. It remained a common item until about 1970 when men&#x27;s headwear went out of fashion and men&#x27;s fashion focused on highly maintained hairstyles instead.

The hat saw a resurgence in popularity at several times in the 1980s, being marketed to both men and women in an attempt to capitalise on a retro fashion trend.

As the use of hats became more of a limited pursuit in the 1990s and 2000s, the trilby became a favored garment of the hipster subculture, briefly resurfacing as a fashionable item in the late 2000s and early 2010s.

==In popular culture==
Frank Sinatra was identified with trilby hats, and there is a signature design trilby bearing his name. The reggae poet Linton Kwesi Johnson often wears a trilby during his performances. Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau wore a Herbert Johnson trilby in Blake Edwards&#x27;s &quot;A Shot in the Dark&quot; (1964), the second of his &quot;Pink Panther&quot; series; the felt trilby gave way to a tweed one in later films. The cartoon character Inspector Gadget wears a trilby hat.

In the Series 1 episode &quot;The Think Tank&quot; of the program &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;, the Grace Brothers store policy is revealed to include a hierarchical order for hats male personnel wear: bowlers for departmental heads and above, homburgs for senior floor staff and trilbys or caps for junior floor staff.

<text>Baron Selsdon, of Croydon in the County of Surrey, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 14 January 1932 for the Conservative politician Sir William Mitchell-Thomson, 2nd Baronet. His son, the second Baron, was a successful racing driver, winning the 1949 24 Hours of Le Mans in the first Ferrari (although his codriver, Luigi Chinetti, actually drove for all but one half-hour). The titles were then held by the second Baron&#x27;s only son, the third Baron, who succeeded in 1963. He was one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that remain in the House of Lords after the House of Lords Act of 1999, till 2021, when he was removed due to non-attendance, under the provisions of the House of Lords Reform Act 2014. Lord Selsdon sat on the Conservative benches. Since 2024, the titles are held by the third Baron&#x27;s only son, the fourth Baron. The Mitchell-Thomson Baronetcy, of Polmood in the County of Peebles, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 26 September 1900 for the first Baron&#x27;s father, Sir Mitchell Mitchell-Thomson, Lord Provost of Edinburgh from 1897 to 1900.

In 1673 he was appointed as Chancellor of Denmark, elevated to count, the highest aristocratic rank in Denmark-Norway, and received the Order of the Elephant, the country&#x27;s highest order. At the behest of his enemies at court, Griffenfeld was arrested in early 1676 and convicted of treason, a charge that historians agree was false. He was imprisoned for 22 years, mainly at Munkholmen in Norway.

==Early years==

Born at Copenhagen into a wealthy trading family connected with the leading civic, clerical and learned circles in the Danish capital, he was prepared for university (at the age of ten) by
Jens Vorde. Vorde praises his extraordinary gifts, his mastery of the classical languages and his unnerving diligence. The brilliance he showed in his preliminary examination won him the friendship of the examiner, Bishop Jesper Brochmand, at whose palace he first met King Frederick III of Denmark. The king was struck with Schumacher; and Brokman, proud of his pupil, made him translate a chapter from a Hebrew Bible first into Latin and then into Danish, for the entertainment of the scholarly monarch.

In 1654 young Schumacher went abroad for eight years, to complete his education. From Germany he proceeded to the Netherlands, staying at Leiden, Utrecht and Amsterdam, and passing in 1657 to Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, where he spent three years. The epoch-making events that occurred in England while he was at Oxford profoundly interested him. Coinciding with the Revolution in Denmark, which threw open a career to the middle classes, it convinced him that his future was in politics. In the autumn of 1660 Schumacher visited Paris, shortly after Mazarin&#x27;s death, when the young Louis XIV of France first seized the reins of power. Schumacher seems to have been profoundly impressed by the administrative superiority of a strong centralised monarchy in the hands of an energetic monarch who knew his own mind; and, in politics, as in manners, France ever afterwards was his model. The last year of his travels was spent in Spain, where he obtained a thorough knowledge of the Castilian language and literature. He is said to have brought home easy morals as well as exquisite manners.

==Career==

On his return to Copenhagen, in 1662, Schumacher found the monarchy established on the ruins of the aristocracy, and eager to buy the services of every man of the middle classes who had superior talents to offer. The young adventurer contrived to secure the protection of Kristoffer Gabel, the king&#x27;s confidant, and in 1663 was appointed the royal librarian. A romantic friendship with the king&#x27;s natural son, Count Ulric Frederick Gyldenløve, consolidated his position. In 1665 Schumacher obtained his first political post as the king&#x27;s secretary, and the same year composed the memorable King&#x27;s Law (Lex Regia). He was now a personage at court, where he won many over by his amiability and gaiety; and in political matters also his influence was beginning to be felt. During these years, he had a notorious love affair with Mette Trolle

On the death of Frederick III (9 February 1670) Schumacher was the most trusted of all the royal counsellors. He alone was aware of the existence of the new throne of walrus ivory embellished with three silver life-size lions, and of the new regalia, both of which treasures he had, by the king&#x27;s command, concealed in a vault beneath the royal castle. Frederick III had also confided to him a sealed packet containing the King&#x27;s Law, which was to be delivered to his successor alone. Schumacher had been recommended to his son by Frederick III on his death-bed. &quot;Make him a great man, but do it slowly,&quot; said Frederick, who thoroughly understood the characters of his son and of his minister. Christian V was, moreover, deeply impressed by the confidence which his father had ever shown to Schumacher. When, on 9 February 1670, Schumacher delivered the King&#x27;s Law to Christian V, the king bade all those about him withdraw, and after being closeted a good hour with Schumacher appointed him his &quot;Obergeheimesekreter&quot; (principal private secretary).

His promotion was rapid. In May 1670 he received the titles of excellency and privy councillor; in July of the same year he was ennobled under the name of Griffenfeld, deriving his title from the gold griffin with outspread wings which surmounted his escutcheon; in November 1673 the title of count was bestowed upon him and he also became a knight of the Order of the Elephant and, finally, imperial chancellor. In the course of the next few months he gathered into his hands every branch of the government: he had reached the apogee of his short-lived greatness.

He had captivated the accomplished Frederick III by his literary graces and ingenious speculations; he won over fun-loving Christian V by saving him trouble and by acting and thinking for him, and whilst making him believe that he was thinking and acting for himself. Moreover, his commanding qualities were coupled with an organizing talent which made itself felt in every department of the state, and with a marvellous adaptability which made him a great diplomat.

On 25 May 1671 the dignities of count and baron were introduced into Denmark-Norway; a few months later the Order of the Dannebrog was instituted as a fresh means of winning adherents by marks of favour. 
Griffenfeld was the originator of these new institutions. To him monarchy was the ideal form of government. But he had also a political object. The aristocracy of birth, despite its reverses, still remained the elite of society; and Griffenfeld, the son of a burgess, was its most determined enemy. The new baronies and countships, owing their existence entirely to the crown, introduced a strong solvent into aristocratic circles. Griffenfeld saw that, in future, the first at court would be the first everywhere. Much was also done to promote trade and industry, notably by the revival of the Kammer Kollegium, or board of trade, and the abolition of some of the most harmful monopolies. Both the higher and the provincial administrations were thoroughly reformed with the view of 

making them more centralized and efficient; and the positions and duties of the various magistrates, who now also received fixed salaries, were for the first time exactly defined. But what Griffenfeld could create, Griffenfeld could dispense with, and it was not long before he began to encroach upon the jurisdiction of the new departments of state by private conferences with their chiefs. Nevertheless, it is indisputable that, under the single direction of this mastermind, the Danish state was now able, for a time, to utilize all its resources as it had never done before.

In the last three years of his administration, Griffenfeld gave himself entirely to the conduct of the foreign policy of Denmark-Norway. It is difficult to form a clear idea of this, first, because his influence was perpetually traversed by opposite tendencies; in the second place, because the force of circumstances compelled him, again and again, to shift his standpoint; and finally because personal considerations largely intermingled with his foreign policy, and made it more elusive and ambiguous than it need have been. Briefly, Griffenfeld aimed at restoring Denmark to the rank of a great power. He proposed to accomplish this by carefully nursing its resources, and in the meantime securing and enriching the country through alliances, which would bring in large subsidies while imposing a minimum of obligations. Such a conditional and tentative policy, in a period of universal tension and turmoil, was most difficult; but Griffenfeld did not regard it as impossible.

The first demand of such a policy was peace, especially peace with Denmark-Norway&#x27;s most dangerous neighbour, Sweden. The second postulate was a sound financial basis, which he expected the wealth of France to supply in the shape of subsidies to be spent on armaments. Above all things Denmark-Norway was to beware of making enemies of France and Sweden at the same time. An alliance, on fairly equal terms, between the three powers, would, in these circumstances, be the consummation of Griffenfeld&#x27;s system; an alliance with France to the exclusion of Sweden would be the next best policy; but an alliance between France and Sweden, without the admission of Denmark, was to be avoided at all hazards. Had Griffenfeld&#x27;s policy succeeded, Denmark might have recovered her ancient possessions to the south and east comparatively cheaply. But again and again he was overruled. Despite his open protests and subterraneous counter-mining, war was actually declared against Sweden in 1675, and his subsequent policy seemed so obscure and hazardous to those who did not possess the clue to the perhaps purposely tangled skein, that the numerous enemies whom his arrogance and superciliousness had raised up against him, resolved to destroy him.

==Trial==

On 11 March 1676, while on his way to the royal apartments, Griffenfeld was arrested in the king&#x27;s name and taken to the citadel, a prisoner of state. A minute scrutiny of his papers, lasting nearly six weeks, revealed nothing treasonable; but it provided the enemies of the fallen statesman with a deadly weapon against him in the shape of an entry in his private diary, in which he had imprudently noted that on one occasion Christian V in a conversation with a foreign ambassador had spoken like a child. On 3 May, Griffenfeld was tried not by the customary tribunal, in such cases the &quot;Højesteret&quot;, or supreme court, but by an extraordinary tribunal of 10 dignitaries, none of whom was particularly well disposed towards the accused. Griffenfeld, who was charged with simony, bribery, oath-breaking, malversation and &quot;lèse-majesté&quot;, conducted his own defence under every imaginable difficulty.

For forty-six days before his trial he had been closely confined in a dungeon, without lights, books or writing materials. Every legal assistance was illegally denied him. Nevertheless, he proved more than a match for the prosecution. Finally, he was condemned to degradation and decapitation; though one of the ten judges not only refused to sign the sentence, but remonstrated in private with the king against its injustice. The primary offence of the ex-chancellor was the taking of bribes, which no twisting of the law could convert into a capital offence, while the charge of treason had not been substantiated.

Griffenfeld was pardoned on the scaffold, at the very moment when the axe was about to descend. On hearing that the sentence was commuted to lifelong imprisonment, he declared that the pardon was harder than the punishment, and vainly petitioned for leave to serve his king for the rest of his life as a common soldier. For the next twenty-two years Denmark-Norways&#x27;s greatest statesman was a lonely prisoner, first in the fortress of Copenhagen, in Denmark and finally at Munkholmen in Trondheim Fjord, in Norway, where he died. Griffenfeld had married Kitty Nansen, the granddaughter of the great Burgomaster Hans Nansen, who brought him half a million rixdollars. She died in 1672, after bearing him a daughter. Griffenfeld and his wife are both buried at Vær Kirke in Århus Diocese

Griffenfeldsgade, a street in Nørrebro, Copenhagen, as well as Griffenfeld Island in Southeast Greenland, were named after him.

<text>Strouds Run State Park is a public recreation area abutting the city of Athens in Athens County, Ohio, in the United States. The state park is located primarily in Canaan Township, with a small part in Ames Township. Park boundaries coincide with Athens city limits in several places. The park comprises , and includes Dow Lake, a artificial lake. The park is named after William Stroud who was a share-holder in the Ohio Company of Associates.

== History ==
The original land for the park was purchased for the Athens State Forest in the 1940s and 1950s. In the late 1950s, construction was started on the Dow Lake Dam, which was completed in 1960, at which point the land became Strouds Run State Park in its entirety.

A large area on the west side of the park was formerly land of the Gillett family (Samuel and Charlotte Beach Gillett and their descendants). The family owned well over a thousand acres at one time. The old farmstead seen on the Trace Trail and the &quot;Pioneer Cemetery&quot; are both remnant from the Gillett occupancy of the land. Two of the adjacent nature preserves, both owned by the Athens Conservancy (Blair Preserve and Tucker Run Preserve) are also both on former Gillett family land.

One of the most recently purchased areas of the park was acquired in 1953 from the Crumley family, heirs to Dr. John Jackson Crumley, who purchased the land almost a century ago as an experimental tree farm. Dr. Crumley was a classical scholar who also was one of Ohio&#x27;s early state foresters, who managed the purchase of the original land for Zaleski State Forest and Hocking State Forest, and who wrote one of the earliest practical handbooks on forestry.

A large part of the upper east side of the part was owned by the Cone family, last owned by Charles Cone and Lucille Gillett Cone (a descendant of Samuel Gillett above.) Adjacent to the Cone farm was a large, one-room school house that was dismantled when the lake was built. Some of the materials from the school house were then used to construct the Strouds Run Community Church just up the road from the park, as well as a new barn for Charles Cone who lost his previous one to the park&#x27;s construction. The church was eventually converted into a private residence, and was subsequently completely destroyed in a fire a few years later.

The area from the old school house, up past where the church was constructed and beyond was briefly known as Marchmont. From 1893 to 1901, there was an inn and post office for the Marchmont area that was located at the base of what was then known as Tucker Hill. This was on the same portion of land that remained in the Cone family after the park&#x27;s construction, and currently remains with descendants of Charles Cone.

In addition to Gillett and Cone, some other notable family names affected by the park&#x27;s construction were Cain, Finsterwald, Weiss, and Stalder. Many of those families came to this country with Baron deSteiguer. The Baron purchased the lands from the heirs of John Paul Jones as most of the area land was once owned by the Revolutionary War admiral.

== Natural history ==

Strouds Run is located within the unglaciated Allegheny Plateau. The park consists of mostly narrow valleys, narrow ridges, and steep hillsides. Bluffs and rock shelters are common throughout the park, formed by the Connellsville sandstone. There are a few springs in the park out of the Ames limestone, including Linscott Spring (which has an historic springhouse). Normal pool elevation of Dow Lake is about 665 feet above sea level, while the highest point in the park is about 1022 feet above sea level. The park is almost entirely within the Strouds Run watershed, although it does not include the entire watershed.

The forest in some areas of the park is over a century old without significant disturbance. The Riddle State Nature Preserve is nearby, including Hawk Woods, which is one of Ohio&#x27;s very few genuine old-growth forests.

Common birds in the park include both black and turkey vultures, Canada geese, red-winged blackbirds, red-tailed hawks, red-shouldered hawks, and barn swallows.

Beavers and white-tailed deer are common in the park. Bobcats are known to be in the area, but none are known within the park itself.

== Facilities and usage ==
Facilities include a campground (pit toilets, no shower), swimming beach, boat dock, boat and canoe rentals, pistol, picnic grounds and shelters, and hiking trails. Hunting is permitted in season. Shooting ranges are no longer available for the public.

Significant areas of the park are pine plantations (white and red) from the mid-twentieth century, when the land was purchased, originally as the Athens State Forest. There is also one small baldcypress plantation within the park. However, most of the area is mature hardwood forest. The park features many bluffs and rock outcrops of sandstone. Several beaver ponds are within the park boundaries.

Many of the trails are open to mountain bikes.

The lake is used by Ohio University for aquatic sports such as crew. The lake is also a very common destination of Ohio University students to enjoy the weather on sunny spring or summer days.

The lake is stocked on an annual basis with several kinds of fish, including rainbow trout, which cannot survive the winters.

== Adjacent public lands ==
The park borders on the city&#x27;s Strouds Ridge Preserve Project, which includes the Riddle State Nature Preserve, and with the Athens Conservancy&#x27;s 75 acre (0.3 km2) Blair Preserve.

In addition, the Baker Tract, managed by the Athens Conservancy, is a short drive away, with a public access trailhead on Ohio State Route 690.

<text>Rose Bay is a harbourside eastern suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Rose Bay is located seven kilometres east of the Sydney central business district, in the local government areas of Municipality of Woollahra (on its western side towards the bay) and Waverley Council (east of Old South Head Road).

== Geography ==

Rose Bay has views of both the Sydney Opera House and the Sydney Harbour Bridge together. Lyne Park abuts Sydney Harbour on its west. Shark Island is located in Sydney Harbour, just north of Rose Bay.

==History==

The original name of the land now known as Rose Bay is Banarung, Dharag Language. 
Rose Bay was named after the Right Honourable George Rose, who was joint Secretary to the British Treasury with Thomas Steele, after whom Steel(e) Point at Nielsen Park was named. The name Rose Bay was used as early as 1788 by Captain John Hunter.
HMAS &quot;Tingira&quot;, named after an Aboriginal word for &#x27;open sea&#x27; was moored in Rose Bay from 1912 to 1927. It was used to train over 3,000 Australian sailors, many for service in World War I. There is a small park on the Rose Bay waterfront which commemorates &quot;Tingira&quot;.

From 1938, seaplane flights to and from London began and terminated in Sydney Harbour on Rose Bay, making it Sydney&#x27;s first international airport, and what is now Rose Bay Water Airport. On 14 September 1945, nine Catalina flying boats landed and moored at the Rose Bay wharf, repatriating Australian prisoners of war who were survivors of Japanese camps. Sydneysiders looked on in silence, aghast at the emaciated state of the returning soldiers.

The Wintergarden Cinema was a landmark building which housed the Sydney Film Festival from 1968 to 1973, but which was demolished to make way for exclusive apartments in the late 1980s.

== Heritage listings ==
Rose Bay has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* 3-4 Fernleigh Gardens: Site of Ficus superba var. henneana tree
* New South Head Road: Rose Bay Sea Wall
* 1-7 Salisbury Road: &quot;Salisbury Court&quot; (Rose Bay)

===Rose Bay Cottage===
&quot;Rose Bay Cottage&quot; and also known as &quot;Salisbury Court&quot;, located in Salisbury Road, was built in 1834 by the important colonial architect, John Verge, for James Holt who, at the time, managed the &#x27;Cooper Estate&#x27;. When built, it was the only house on the &#x27;Estate&#x27;, with the possible exception of Henrietta Villa, Captain Piper&#x27;s previous home on Point Piper. The house was built as a single-storey residence of about with a verandah, over a similar sized stone cellar. Adjacent to it was an earlier structure (s) which was apparently adopted as a kitchen. The house was significantly enlarged by sympathetic additions between 1837 and 1850 and the kitchen wing was joined to the main house forming a courtyard. By the end of this period the house had more than doubled in size. From 1861 until 1911, the house was usually known as Rose Bay Lodge; it has also been known as Salisbury Court. It was surrounded by extensive gardens embellished by five working fountains fed from a water source above on the slopes of Bellevue Hill which later fed &quot;Woollahra House&quot;, built in 1883 on Point Piper. One of the fountains still remains. Prominent occupiers of the house included Sir Daniel Cooper, Walter Lamb and John Hay – they were all noted businessmen and parliamentarians. In 1911, the property, then of , was sub-divided and surrounded by other houses. During the next fifty years the old house suffered extensive unsympathetic additions including a second storey over the original Verge cottage which converted the house to twelve flats. It has subsequently been restored according to strict conservation standards and the unsympathetic additions removed. The house is listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register.

===&quot;Fernleigh Castle&quot;===

&quot;Fernleigh Castle&quot; was built in 1892,&lt;ref name=&quot;Australia, Macmillan Company 1981, p. 2/134&quot;&gt;&quot;The Heritage of Australia&quot;, Macmillan Company, 1981, p. 2/134&lt;/ref&gt; incorporating part of a sandstone cottage that dated back to 1874. Aptly named, it resembles a castle with its turrets, castellated towers and square Norman tower. Its sandstone structure contains thirty rooms and a number of stained-glass windows. &quot;Fernleigh Castle&quot; is on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate.

A fig tree, &quot;Ficus superba var. henneana&quot;, planted in , located in the former castle grounds is listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register.

===Rose Bay Police Station===
This police station originally started life as the gatekeeper&#x27;s lodge in the estate of Woollahra House, a nineteenth-century mansion that has long gone. The surviving building was designed in a Victorian Classical Revival style which is attributed to &#x27;Hilly and Mansfield&#x27; and which probably tells us what Woollahra House looked like. It was built in 1871 and features rendered walls punctuated with pilasters. Sympathetically restored, it is now on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate.

==Educational facilities and history==

Rose Bay is home to two independent schools: Kambala (1887), an Anglican, day and boarding school for girls from Pre-school to Year 12; and Kincoppal – Rose Bay (1882), a Catholic, day and boarding school with a co-educational primary school and girls-only high school. Kincoppal – Rose Bay was originally Rose Bay Convent but amalgamated with Kincoppal Elizabeth Bay in the late 1970s to become &quot;Kincoppal – Rose Bay School of the Sacred Heart&quot;. The prep school campus of Cranbrook School (1918) is also located in the suburb. McAuley Primary School is a Catholic school for Kindergarten to Year 6. It was opened in 1967 on the site that had been a Christian Brothers High School from 1935 to 1966.
Public schools in the suburb are Rose Bay Secondary College (2004) and Rose Bay Public School (1891). Rose Bay Secondary College was formed by the amalgamation of Vaucluse High School and Dover Heights High School. Originally these schools were known as Vaucluse Boys High, Dover Heights Boys High and Dover Heights Girls High. The cost of improving the public school facilities at Rose Bay was linked to the sale of the campus at Vaucluse. Despite a surge in enrolments and an unmet demand for public high school places in the area, the Vaucluse campus was sold in February 2007 by the Government of New South Wales for $30M to become a seniors community development site.

The Convent of the Sacred Heart overlooks the bay and can be seen from many vantage points around Sydney Harbour. The site was originally occupied by a house called Claremont, which was built in 1852. The convent incorporated this house when it was built in 1888. Designed by John Horbury Hunt, the new building was of five storeys in height and made of sandstone that was quarried at the site. It included a Gothic Revival Chapel and is regarded as one of Hunt&#x27;s most successful creations. It now houses the Kincoppal-Rose Bay school for girls. The building has a Federal heritage listing.

==Transport==
The Rose Bay ferry wharf provides access to the Watsons Bay ferry services. There are frequent Transdev John Holland buses to and from the centre of Sydney via Kings Cross as well as other points and out to Watsons Bay and the coast. Seaplane operators offer scenic flights over Sydney itself as well as a number of excursions along the coast as well as some scheduled services to Newcastle with aircraft operating out of the seaplane terminal near Rose Bay ferry terminal.

==Sport and recreation==

In 1902 a reserve named in honour of Sir William Lyne was reclaimed from tidal sand flats at Rose Bay. In 1904 harbour baths were built in a design by the architect Thomas Tidswell. The baths have since been removed.

Since 1908, Rose Bay has been represented in one of Australia&#x27;s most popular sporting competitions, the National Rugby League, by the Sydney Roosters, officially known as the Eastern Suburbs District Rugby League Football Club.

There are two golf courses located in Rose Bay. Woollahra Golf Club is a public 9-hole course and Royal Sydney Golf Club is a private 27-hole championship course, not open to the public.

The 3rd Rose Bay Rovers group is an active Rovers group based in the Scouts Hall located in Vickery Avenue, opposite Woollahra Sailing Club.

Rose Bay is home to the Waverley Amateur Radio Society, Australia&#x27;s longest continuously licensed amateur radio club. The club meets on a regular basis at the Scouts Hall located in Vickery Avenue.

Rose Bay beach (also known locally as Dog Beach) is at the far eastern end of the bay and as the name suggests is a popular beach for dog owners. Despite its popularity, Rose Bay beach is not always safe to swim at due to the pollution issues surrounding the beach.

<text>The Hong Kong Museum of Art (HKMoA) is the first and main art museum of Hong Kong, located in Salisbury Road, Tsim Sha Tsui. It is a public museum managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department of the Hong Kong Government. HKMoA has an art collection of over 17,000 items. Admission is free for permanent exhibitions. Its rival is the non-government-managed Hong Kong Arts Centre. These two museums are considered to be the top two art museums in Hong Kong that dictate the discourse of art in Hong Kong.

It has an extended branch, the Flagstaff House Museum of Tea Ware, at the Hong Kong Park in Central.

==History==
The museum was established as the City Hall Museum and Art Gallery in the City Hall in Central by the Urban Council on 2 March 1962. This was split into the Hong Kong Museum of History and the Hong Kong Museum of Art in July 1975.

The Museum of History moved to Kowloon Park in 1983. Before leaving City Hall in 1991, the art museum occupied the 8th (rear portion), 9th, 10th, and 11th storeys of the High Block. These floors now house a public library. In 1991, it was moved to the present premises at 10 Salisbury Road, near the Hong Kong Cultural Centre and the Hong Kong Space Museum, in Tsim Sha Tsui.

The new museum was formally inaugurated by Governor Chris Patten on 11 September 1992.

The museum closed on 3 August 2015 for a $400 million expansion and renovation. It reopened on 30 November 2019.

==Exhibitions==
The museum changes its displays regularly. The exhibitions in the museum are mainly of paintings, calligraphy and sculpture from Hong Kong, China and other parts of the world. It has cooperated with other museums as well.

From 25 May to 4 July 1962, the museum (then still named the Hong Kong City Hall Museum and Art Gallery) held the major exhibition, &quot;Hong Kong Art Today&quot;. It was significant as the first exhibition with Hong Kong art as its theme. The exhibition also reflected how naturalism in art had become passé and that abstract art was favoured at that moment in time.

Since 1975, the museum has hosted the Hong Kong Art Biennial Exhibition featuring the work of contemporary Hong Kong artists. It was renamed the Hong Kong Contemporary Art Biennial Awards in 2009.

==Transportation==
The museum is within walking distance of both East Tsim Sha Tsui station and Tsim Sha Tsui station of the Mass Transit Railway (MTR). It is even closer to the Tsim Sha Tsui Ferry Pier, with services to Wan Chai and Central.

<text>Hans Nansen (28 November 1598 – 12 November 1667) was a Danish statesman.

==Biography==

The son of a burgher, Evert Nansen, he was born at Flensburg. He made several voyages to the White Sea and to places in northern Russia, and in 1621 entered the service of the thriving Danish Icelandic Company. For many years the whole trade of Iceland, which he frequently visited, passed through his hands, and he soon became equally well known at Glückstadt, the centre of the Iceland trade, and at Copenhagen.

In February 1644, at the express desire of King Christian IV, the Copenhagen burgesses elected him burgomaster. During his northern voyages he had learned Russian, and was employed as interpreter at court whenever Muscovite embassies visited Copenhagen. His travels had begotten in him a love of geography, and he published in 1633 a &quot;Kosmografi&quot;, previously revised by the astronomer Longomontanus.

During the siege of Copenhagen by the Swedes in 1658 Nansen became prominent. At the meeting between the king and the citizens to arrange for the defence of the capital, he urged the necessity of an obstinate defence. It was he who obtained privileges for the burgesses of Copenhagen which placed them on a footing of equality with the nobility; and he was the life and soul of the garrison till the arrival of the Dutch fleet practically saved the city. These eighteen months of crisis established his influence in the capital once for all and at the same time knitted him closely to Frederick III, who recognized in Nansen a man after his own heart, and made the great burgomaster his chief instrument in carrying through the anti-aristocratic Revolution of 1660. Nansen used all the arts of the agitator with extraordinary energy and success.

His greatest feat was the impassioned speech by which, on 8 October, he induced the burgesses to accede to the proposal of the magistracy of Copenhagen to offer Frederick III the realm of Denmark-Norway as a purely hereditary state. How far Nansen was content with the result of the Revolution—absolute monarchy—it is impossible to say. It appears certain that, at the beginning he did not want absolutism. Whether he subsequently regarded the victory of the monarchy and its corollary, the admittance of the middle classes to all offices and dignities, as a satisfactory equivalent for his original demands; or whether he was so overcome by royal favour as to sacrifice cheerfully the political liberties of his country, is a matter for conjecture.

After the Revolution Nansen continued in high honour, but he chiefly occupied himself with commerce, and less with politics.

<doc id="491556" wikidata="Q13627582" url="?curid=491556" title="Apportionment paradox">
<text>An apportionment paradox is a situation where an apportionment—a rule for dividing discrete objects according to some proportional relationship—produces results that violate notions of common sense or fairness.

Certain quantities, like milk, can be divided in any proportion whatsoever; others, such as horses, cannot—only whole numbers will do. In the latter case, there is an inherent tension between the desire to obey the rule of proportion as closely as possible and the constraint restricting the size of each portion to discrete values.

Several paradoxes related to apportionment and fair division have been identified. In some cases, simple adjustments to an apportionment methodology can resolve observed paradoxes. However, as shown by the Balinski–Young theorem, it is not always possible to provide a perfectly fair resolution to that satisfies all competing fairness criteria.

==History==
An example of the apportionment paradox known as &quot;the Alabama paradox&quot; was discovered in the context of United States congressional apportionment in 1880, when census calculations found that if the total number of seats in the House of Representatives were hypothetically increased, this would decrease Alabama&#x27;s seats from 8 to 7. An actual impact was observed in 1900, when Virginia lost a seat to Maine, even though Virginia&#x27;s population was growing more rapidly: this is an example of the population paradox. In 1907, when Oklahoma became a state, New York lost a seat to Maine, thus the name &quot;the new state paradox&quot;.

The method for apportionment used during this period, originally put forth by Alexander Hamilton, but vetoed by George Washington and not adopted until 1852, was as follows:

* First, the fair share of each state is computed, i.e. the proportional share of seats that each state would get if fractional values were allowed. 
* Second, each state receives as many seats as the whole number portion of its fair share.
* Third, any state whose fair share is less than one receives one seat, regardless of population, as required by the United States Constitution.
* Fourth, any remaining seats are distributed, one each, to the states whose fair shares have the highest fractional parts.

The Hamilton method replaced a rounding method proposed by Thomas Jefferson, and was itself replaced by the Huntington–Hill method in 1941.

==Examples of paradoxes==

===Alabama paradox===
The Alabama paradox was the first of the apportionment paradoxes to be discovered. The US House of Representatives is constitutionally required to allocate seats based on population counts, which are required every 10 years. The size of the House is set by statute.

After the 1880 census, C. W. Seaton, chief clerk of the United States Census Bureau, computed apportionments for all House sizes between 275 and 350, and discovered that Alabama would get eight seats with a House size of 299 but only seven with a House size of 300. In general the term &quot;Alabama paradox&quot; refers to any apportionment scenario where increasing the total number of items would decrease one of the shares. A similar exercise by the Census Bureau after the 1900 census computed apportionments for all House sizes between 350 and 400: Colorado would have received three seats in all cases, except with a House size of 357 in which case it would have received two.

The following is a simplified example (following the largest remainder method) with three states and 10 seats and 11 seats.

Observe that state C&#x27;s share decreases from 2 to 1 with the added seat.

In this example of a 10% increase in the number of seats, each state&#x27;s share increases by 10%. However, increasing the number of seats by a fixed % increases the fair share more for larger numbers (i.e., large states more than small states). In particular, large A and B had their fair share increase faster than small C. Therefore, the fractional parts for A and B increased faster than those for C. In fact, they overtook C&#x27;s fraction, causing C to lose its seat, since the Hamilton method allocates according to which states have the largest fractional remainder.

The Alabama paradox gave rise to the axiom known as house monotonicity, which says that, when the house size increases, the allocations of all states should weakly increase.

===Population paradox===

The population paradox is a counterintuitive result of some procedures for apportionment. When two states have populations increasing at different rates, a small state with rapid growth can lose a legislative seat to a big state with slower growth.

Some of the earlier Congressional apportionment methods, such as Hamilton, could exhibit the population paradox. In 1900, Virginia lost a seat to Maine, even though Virginia&#x27;s population was growing more rapidly. However, divisor methods such as the current method do not.

===New states paradox===

Given a fixed number of total representatives (as determined by the United States House of Representatives), adding a new state would in theory &quot;reduce&quot; the number of representatives for existing states, as under the United States Constitution each state is entitled to at least one representative regardless of its population. Also, even if the number of members in the House of Representatives is increased by the number of Representatives in the new state, a pre-existing state could lose a seat because of how the particular apportionment rules deal with rounding methods. In 1907, when Oklahoma became a state, it was given a fair share of seats and the total number of seats increased by that number. The House increased from 386 to 391 members. A recomputation of apportionment affected the number of seats because of other states: New York lost a seat while Maine gained one.

The Alabama paradox gave rise to the axiom known as coherence, which says that, whenever an apportionment rule is activated on a subset of the states, with the subset of seats allocated to them, the outcome should be the same as in the grand solution.

==Balinski–Young theorem==
In 1983, two mathematicians, Michel Balinski and Peyton Young, proved that any method of apportionment that does not violate the quota rule will result in paradoxes whenever there are four or more parties (or states, regions, etc.). More precisely, their theorem states that there is no apportionment system that has the following properties for more than three states (as the example we take the division of seats between parties in a system of proportional representation):
* It avoids violations of the quota rule: Each of the parties gets one of the two numbers closest to its fair share of seats. For example, if a party&#x27;s fair share is 7.34 seats, it must get either 7 or 8 seats to avoid a violation; any other number will violate the rule.
* It does not have the population paradox: If party A gets more votes and party B gets fewer votes, no seat will be transferred from A to B.

It is of note that any method of apportionment free of the Population Paradox will always be free of Alabama Paradox. The converse is not true, however. Webster&#x27;s method can be free of incoherence and maintain quota when there are three states. All sensible methods satisfy both criteria in the trivial two-state case.

They show a proof of impossibility: apportionment methods may have a subset of these properties, but cannot have all of them:
* A method may be free of both the Alabama paradox and the population paradox. These methods are divisor methods, and Huntington–Hill, the method currently used to apportion House of Representatives seats, is one of them. However, these methods will necessarily fail to always follow quota in other circumstances.
* No method may always follow quota and be free of the population paradox. 

The division of seats in an election is a prominent cultural concern. In 1876, the United States presidential election turned on the method by which the remaining fraction was calculated. Rutherford Hayes received 185 electoral college votes, and Samuel Tilden received 184. Tilden won the popular vote. With a different rounding method the final electoral college tally would have reversed. However, many mathematically analogous situations arise in which quantities are to be divided into discrete equal chunks. The Balinski–Young theorem applies in these situations: it indicates that although very reasonable approximations can be made, there is no mathematically rigorous way to reconcile the small remaining fraction while complying with all the competing fairness elements. In general, the response from mathematicians has been to abandon the quota rule as the less-important property, accepting that apportionment errors may sometimes slightly exceed one seat.

A method may follow quota and be free of the Alabama paradox. Balinski and Young constructed a method that does so, although it is not in common political use.

<text>USS &quot;Marlin&quot; (SS-205), a &quot;Mackerel&quot;-class submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the marlin, a large game fish. &quot;Marlin&quot; and her near-sister &quot;Mackerel&quot; (designed and built by the Electric Boat Company) were prototype small submarines, which the Navy was exploring to replace the aging S-class submarines. References differ as to whether &quot;Marlin&quot; had a direct drive propulsion system or diesel-electric drive.

Her keel was laid down by Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine, on 23 May 1940. She was launched on 29 January 1941 sponsored by Mrs. John D. Wainwright, and commissioned on 1 August 1941.

After service in the Atlantic Fleet out of Submarine Base New London, Connecticut, for half a year, &quot;Marlin&quot; departed New London 21 March 1942 for Casco Bay, Maine. She arrived the next day for duty with TG 27.1, training new escort vessels in antisubmarine warfare. She returned to New London 18 April, and operated in Long Island Sound through 1942.

On 7 January 1943 the submarine arrived in Casco Bay for further duty with TG 27.1 until 16 January. She then spent the next 2½ years patrolling and training ships off New London and Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

On 26 July 1945, while making a submerged practice approach on , she collided with &quot;SC-642&quot; with slight damage to both ships. In September &quot;Marlin&quot; kept company with on one of her trips from Portsmouth, reaching New London 10 September.

On 20 October 1945 &quot;Marlin&quot; departed New London with for Bridgeport, Connecticut, arriving that day. Five days later she continued on to Boston, Mass, arriving 31 October. She was decommissioned at the Boston Navy Yard on 9 November 1945. &quot;Marlin&quot; was sold 29 March 1946 to the Boston Metals Company of Baltimore, Maryland, for scrapping.

&quot;Marlin&quot; is the submarine prominently featured as the fictional &quot;Corsair&quot; in the 1943 movie &quot;Crash Dive&quot;, filmed at Submarine Base New London. Her sail at the time of the movie resembled &quot;Mackerel&quot;&#x27;s; the forward portion was later cut back for a 20 mm Oerlikon gun platform.

<text>Capulin Volcano National Monument is a U.S. National Monument located in northeastern New Mexico that protects and interprets an extinct cinder cone volcano and is part of the Raton-Clayton volcanic field. A paved road spirals gradually around the volcano and visitors can drive up to a parking lot at the rim of the extinct volcano. Hiking trails circle the rim and lead down into the mouth of the volcano. The monument was designated on August 9, 1916, and is administered by the National Park Service. The volcano is located north of the village of Capulin.

The visitor center features exhibits about the volcano and the area&#x27;s geology, natural and cultural history, and offers educational programs about volcanoes. There is also a video presentation about the volcano. The name &quot;capulin&quot; comes from a type of choke cherry, &quot;Prunus virginiana&quot;, that is native to North America.

Apollo 16&#x27;s John Young and Charlie Duke did some of their geologic training here in May 1971. William R. Muehlberger was one of the geology instructors.

==Description==
From the National Park Service:


== Horseshoe Crater ==

Capulin volcano is near many other extinct volcanoes. One of these is Horseshoe Crater, a mountain created likely due to volcanic depression or a meteorite explosion in the area. It is much older than Capulin, being 440,000 years old, and has been exposed to erosion to appear more rounded and shorter than its original height. The crater appears in a U-shape, which gives the crater its name. Other extinct volcanoes around it include Baby Capulin, Mount Taylor, and Jose Butte.

== Visitor activities ==

The two mile road that winds from the bottom of the volcano all the way to the top is popular with visitors. Once the top is reached, views of the surrounding volcano field, Sangre De Cristo mountains, the flora and fauna are visible. From late June to early August a phenomenon called hilltopping can be seen on the Crater Rim trail; thousands upon thousands of ladybugs cover trees and bushes at the top of the volcano. Capulin is also International Dark-Sky Association Gold Tier Certified, which means it has one of the darkest night skies in the entire country. Due to low levels of light pollution incredible views of the Milky Way and constellations are evident.

Visitors can hike a variety of different trails located throughout the park. The Lava Flow trail is a mile long loop that runs along the southern portion of the park. The Boca Trail is a 1.7 mile long loop that runs along the western base of the volcano, hikers can view the collapsed lava tubes that were created thousands of years ago at the foundation of the volcano. There are two different trails accessible from the top of the volcano: the Crater Rim trail which is a one-mile loop that goes around the entirety of the rim of the volcano and the Crater Vent trail which goes 200 yards into the crater itself.

== History ==
According to the National Park Service, on January 16, 1891, Capulin Mountain was

...withdrawn from settlement, entry or other disposition under any of the public land laws, until such time as Congress may see fit to take action touching the same or until otherwise ordered by competent authority...

On August 9, 1916, President Woodrow Wilson set Capulin aside as a U.S. National Monument by Presidential Proclamation No. 1340, to preserve &quot;...a striking example of recent extinct volcanoes ... which ...is of great scientific and especially geologic interest...&quot;

Jessie Foote Jack and other local ranchers highly valued Capulin Volcano during this time period as it was considered prime grazing land. In order to ensure sole rights to graze cattle on the volcano, Jessie used her husband&#x27;s political connections to secure the position of custodian for the monument. Serving from 1916 to 1921, Jessie Foote Jack was the first custodian for Capulin Volcano, as well as the first female custodian in the National Park Service.

In 1921, Homer Farr would unofficially become the custodian of the monument at the request of Mrs. Jack. Later, in 1923, Farr would officially take over the position serving the National Park Service until 1955. His enthusiasm for the volcano brought numerous changes to the monument. During his tenure, Farr was credited with building the monument&#x27;s infrastructure which includes the road to the rim, procuring funding in economically difficult times, and garnering a Civil Works Project during the Great Depression to stabilize the road and build retaining walls.

Public Law 87-635, 87th Congress, S.2973, September 5, 1962, amended the proclamation to &quot;...preserve the scenic and scientific integrity of Capulin Mountain National Monument...&quot; because of the significance of Capulin Volcano.

On December 31, 1987, Congress changed the Monument&#x27;s name from Capulin Mountain National Monument to Capulin Volcano National Monument by Public Law 100-225 (101 Stat. 1547).

== Ecology ==
Although Capulin is primarily known for its volcanic geology, the park boasts a rich diversity of plant and animal life. The grasslands of the Great Plains and the forests of the Rocky Mountains combine at Capulin to form a unique ecotone which provides habitat for 73 species of birds in addition to numerous other animals. Songbirds such as the spotted towhee, Bullock&#x27;s oriole, mountain bluebird, and Steller&#x27;s jay all call Capulin Volcano home. Larger birds such as the wild turkey, osprey, red-tailed hawk, as well as New Mexico&#x27;s state bird, the roadrunner, also live within the park. There are five different species of hummingbird that migrate through Capulin during the summer months.

Some of the larger mammals that frequent the park include the American black bear, cougar, pronghorn, elk, and the most numerous of larger mammals, the mule deer. Smaller mammals such as the American badger, Mexican free-tailed bat, ring-tailed cat, desert cottontail, and North American porcupine also inhabit Capulin Volcano National Monument. The unique landscape and flora create a habitat that allows a large and diverse group of animals to co-exist in a relatively small area. The abundance of diversity is not contained to just warm blooded animals however, Capulin also has a large group of cold blooded reptiles as well. The prairie rattlesnake and bullsnake are seen throughout the park. Western fence lizards and horned lizards can be seen on hiking trails. The tiger salamander is found in pools of water that sometimes collect around the park.

&quot;Solidago capulinensis&quot;, known as the Capulin goldenrod, is a rare plant endemic to Capulin Volcano National Monument. It is the only known rare vascular plant species in the monument.

<text>Boston Lyric Opera (BLO) is an American opera company based in Boston, Massachusetts, founded in 1976. BLO is the largest and longest-lived opera company in New England. BLO employs nearly 350 artists and creative professionals annually—vocalists, artisans, stagehands, costumers, and scenic designers—many of whom are members of the Boston community. 
==Productions==
Each season, BLO produces four mainstage productions in the Greater-Boston area, one of which is a featured new work. BLO receives partial funding from a grant from the Massachusetts Cultural Council. BLO regularly invests in co-productions with other U.S. companies including New York City Opera, the Opera Theatre of St. Louis, Houston Grand Opera, and Glimmerglass Opera.

BLO&#x27;s community work has included participation in the &quot;Egypt in Boston&quot; thematic season that celebrated Egypt at several of Boston&#x27;s leading cultural institutions in 1999–2000. In the summer of 2002, BLO produced &quot;Carmen on the Common&quot;, a community-outreach initiative of a summer-long education series which culminated in two free, fully staged outdoor performances of Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; on Boston Common. Similar plans were scheduled for Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot; in the 2005–2006 season, but were cancelled because of insufficient financial support.

==Creative personnel==
The conductor John Balme served as general director from 1979 to 1989. Janice Mancini Del Sesto was general director of BLO from 1992 to 2008, while Stephen Lord was BLO music director from 1991 to 2008. During that time, the company&#x27;s budget grew from $800,000 (USD) to $6 million (USD). Since 2008, BLO&#x27;s general and artistic director of BLO is Esther Nelson. In June 2010, BLO announced the appointment of David Angus as the company&#x27;s next music director, as of the 2010–2011 season, and he continues to lead musically the company.

In 2009, John Conklin joined BLO as an artistic advisor and in 2012 Julia Noulin-Mérat joined as the associate producer. As of 2019, John Conklin has set designed 15 productions and Julia Noulin-Mérat has set designed 10 productions.

In 2010, BLO commissioned a work from composer Richard Beaudoin to precede its February 2011 performances of Viktor Ullmann&#x27;s &quot;Der Kaiser von Atlantis&quot;. Beaudoin responded with a 20-minute work for singers and chamber ensemble.

In 2021, Esther Nelson and Julia Noulin-Mérat departed from Boston Lyric Opera.

<text>Tur Abdin (; ; ; or ) is a hilly region situated in southeast Turkey, including the eastern half of the Mardin Province, and Şırnak Province west of the Tigris, on the border with Syria and famed since Late Antiquity for its Christian monasteries on the border of the Roman Empire and the Sasanian Empire. The area is a low plateau in the Anti-Taurus Mountains stretching from Mardin in the west to the Tigris in the east and delimited by the Mesopotamian plains to the south. The Tur Abdin is populated by more than 80 villages and nearly 70 monastery buildings and was mostly Syriac Orthodox until the early 20th century. The earliest surviving Christian buildings date from the 6th century.

The name &quot;Tur Abdin&quot; is . Tur Abdin is of great importance to the Syriac Orthodox, for whom the region used to be a monastic and cultural heartland. The Assyrian community of Tur Abdin call themselves &quot;Suryoye&quot;, and traditionally speak a central Neo-Aramaic dialect called Turoyo.

== Geography ==
=== Settlements ===
The town of Midyat and the villages of Hah, Bequsyone, Dayro da-Slibo, Saleh (with the old monastery of Mor Yaqub), Iwardo (with Mor Huschabo), Anhel, Kafro, Arkah (Harabale, with Dayro Mor Malke), Beth Sbirino, Miden (Middo), Kerburan, Binkelbe with Mor Samun Zayte and Beth Zabday (Azech) were all important Syriac Orthodox settlements among with countless other villages. Hah, today called Anıtlı, has the ancient &#x27;Idto d&#x27;Yoldath-Aloho, the Church of the Mother of God.

== History ==
===Antiquity===
The Assyrian king Adad-nirari II, who came to throne in the late 10th century BCE, removed the Arameans from political power in the Kashiari mountains (Tur Abdin). In the 9th century BCE the Assyrian King Ashurnasirpal II described crossing the plateau of Tur Abdin (which he calls &quot;Kashyari&quot;) on his way to attack the region of Nairi, more than once. He erected a monument in Matiate, modern-day Midyat in Tur Abdin, which remains to be found. His successor, the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III, also crossed Tur Abdin.

Most ancient monuments in Tur Abdin are Christian, but as attested by the Assyrian king Ashurnasirpal II, the area has a pre-Christian history. Older names of the area indicate that the people living here worshipped Assyrian deities. Arches on the north side of the churches in Zaz and Saleh suggest pre-Christian buildings originally stood on the sites. Ancient Assyro-Babylonian religion is believed to have survived in the region until as late as the 18th century.

In 586 B.C. the prophet Ezekiel mentions the famed wine of Izlo, on the southern edge of the plateau of Tur Abdin, in his prophecy against Tyre.

The Mor Gabriel Monastery, the oldest Syriac Orthodox church in the world, was founded in 397 by the ascetic Mor Shmu&#x27;el (Samuel) and his student Mor Shem&#x27;un (Simon). According to tradition, Shem&#x27;un had a dream in which an Angel commanded him to build a House of Prayer in a location marked with three large stone blocks. When Shem&#x27;un awoke, he took his teacher to the place and found the stone the angel had placed. At this spot Mor Gabriel Monastery was built.

In Late Antiquity, the area was part of the Roman Empire&#x27;s province of Mesopotamia and an important centre of Roman Christianity, called in or . The Tur Abdin was fortified by the emperor Constantius II (), who constructed the fortress of Rhabdion to defend it during the Roman–Persian Wars. After the failure of Julian&#x27;s Persian War in 363, the Tur Abdin became part of the Sasanian Empire along with the remaining territory of the five Transtigritine provinces and the nearby strongholds of Nisibis and Bezabde. The numerous monasteries of the Tur Abdin eventually became part of the Church of the East organized at the Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon in 410. They mainly took the Miaphysite position of non-Chalcedonian Christianity after the Council of Chalcedon of 451. After a period of persecution by the Chalcedonian state church of the Roman Empire and during the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628, the monasteries of the Tur Abdin enjoyed a particular prosperity under Arab rule in the latter 7th century.

The fortress of Rhabdion was mentioned by the 6th-century Greek historian Procopius, while the 6th-century &quot;Notitia Antiochena&quot; and the work of the 7th-century Greek geographer George of Cyprus both attest that Turabdium was an episcopal see. The bishop of Turabdium&#x27;s seat was probably the village of Hah, in which were, besides the functioning 6th-century monastery, several ruined churches including the cathedral. The Tur Abdin became part of the Rashidun Caliphate in 640, during the Muslim conquest of the Levant. The Syriac Orthodox communities flourished under early Islamic rule; nearly 30 structures are known to have been wholly built or rebuilt in the following 150 years, during which most of the villages&#x27; churches were built.

After the Council of Chalcedon in 451 AD, the Syriac Orthodox Church split from the Greek-speaking Byzantine mainstream. They were then &quot;severely persecuted as heretical Monophysites by the Byzantine Emperors&quot;, according to William Dalrymple, which led the Syrian Orthodox Church hierarchy to retreat to the &quot;inaccessible shelter of the barren hills of the Tur Abdin.&quot;

===Modern===
Gaunt has estimated the Assyrian population at between 500,000 and 600,000 just before the outbreak of World War I, significantly higher than reported on Ottoman census figures. Midyat, in Diyarbekir vilayet, was the only town in the Ottoman Empire with an Assyrian majority, although divided between Syriac Orthodox, Chaldeans, and Protestants. Syriac Orthodox Christians were concentrated in the hilly rural areas around Midyat, known as Tur Abdin, where they populated almost 100 villages and worked in agriculture or crafts. Syriac Orthodox culture was centered in two monasteries near Mardin (west of Tur Abdin), Mor Gabriel and Deyrulzafaran. Outside of the area of core Syriac settlement, there were also sizable populations in the towns of Diyarbakır, Urfa, Harput, and Adiyaman as well as villages. Unlike the Syriac population of Tur Abdin, many of these Syriacs spoke other languages.
During World War I, 300,000 Assyrian Christians were killed in the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s Genocide in Syriac called &quot;Sayfo&quot;, or &#x27;the sword&#x27;). In the last few decades, caught between Turkish assimilation policies against Kurds, and Kurdish resistance, many Assyrians have fled the region or been killed. Today there are only 5,000, a quarter of the Christian population thirty years ago. Most have fled to Syria (where the city of Qamishli was built by them), Europe (particularly Sweden, Germany, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands), Australia and the United States. In the past few years, a few families have returned to Tur Abdin.

Due to migration, the Syriacs&#x27; main residential area in Turkey today is Istanbul, where around 20,000 lives there.

As of 2019, an estimated between 2,000 and 3,000 of the country&#x27;s 25,000 Assyrians live in Tur Abdin, and they are spread among 30 villages, hamlets, and towns. Some of these locations are dominated by Syriacs while others are dominated by the Kurds. As part of a return movement, some Syriac Orthodox Christians returned to Tur Abdin villages from Germany, Sweden and Switzerland. Prominent diaspora communities exist in these countries, and often advocate a Syriac-Aramean identity affiliated with the Syriac Orthodox Church

===Christian resistance in Tur Abdin during WW1===

The Syriacs of Diyarbekir Vilayet made significant resistance. Their strongest stand was at the villages of Azakh, Iwardo, and Basibrin. For months, Kurdish tribes and Turkish soldiers commanded by Ömer Naci Bey were unable to subdue the mostly Syriac Orthodox and Syriac Catholic villagers who were joined by Armenian and other refugees from surrounding villages. The leaders of the Azakh fedayeen swore We all have to die sometime, do not die in shame and humiliation and lived up to their fighting words.

=== Recent conflicts ===
On 10 February 2006 and the following day, large demonstrations took place in the city of Midyat in Tur Abdin. Muslims angry about the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons gathered in Estel, the new part of the city, and started to march towards the old part of Midyat (6 kilometers away), where the Assyrians live. The mob was stopped by the police before reaching old Midyat.

In 2008 a series of legal challenges were made against the monastery of Mor Gabriel. Some local Kurdish villages sought to claim land on which the monastery had paid taxes since the 1930s as belonging to the villages, and made other accusations against the monastery. This led to considerable diplomatic and human rights action throughout Europe and within Turkey.

== Monasteries ==


The most important Syriac Orthodox centre in Tur Abdin is the monastery of Dayro d-Mor Hananyo, 6 km south east of Mardin, in the west of the region. Built from yellow rock, the monastery is affectionately known as Dayro d Kurkmo in Syriac, Dayr al-Zafaran in Arabic, or Deyrülzafarân in Turkish: the &quot;Safron Monastery&quot;. Founded in AD 493, the monastery was the residence of the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch from 1160 to 1932. Although the patriarch now lives in Damascus the monastery still contains the patriarchal throne and tombs of seven patriarchs and metropolitans. Today the monastery is led by a bishop and a monk and some lay assistants, and is a school for orphans. The bishop of Mor Hananyo is also the patriarchal vicar of Mardin. His goal is to rebuild the monastery and to preserve the history of the Syriac Orthodox church. The Dayro d-Mor Hananyo is part of the UNESCO world cultural heritage and was visited by numerous celebrities including the UK&#x27;s King Charles III, when Prince of Wales.

In the centre of the Tur Abdin region, a few miles south of Midyat, is Dayro d-Mor Gabriel. Built in AD 397, &quot;Mor Gabriel monastery&quot;, is the oldest functioning Syriac Orthodox monastery on earth. It is the residence of the Metropolitan Bishop of Tur Abdin, seven nuns, four monks and a host of guests, assistants and students. The monastery is charged with keeping the flame of Syriac Orthodox faith alive in Tur Abdin, for which it is as much a fortress as a church.

The Saffron and Mor Gabriel monasteries are the most important of the region, existing along with six or seven other active monasteries:
* The Mor Augin Monastery, located on the southern slope of Mt. Izla, has only been recently revived. It has a historical significance to the region. As evidence of that, a Syriac Orthodox bishop in the Netherlands took the name Augin in respect for the founder of the monastery.
* The Mor Abroham Monastery is located less than a mile east of Midyat, and it is known for having a large amount of farmland, some of which they donated to house Syrian refugees. Directly adjacent to the monastery lies the Turabdin Hotel and winery, which uses the monasteries vineyards to produce unique Syriac wines endemic to the region.
* The St. Meryemana (Mary) Monastery, located next to the village of Anıtlı, functions as the religious center for the remaining Christians of the village, and has a school for Syriac children.
* The Mor Yakup (Jacob) Monastery is located next to the village of Baristepe, and, like the St Mary Monastery, functions as the religious center for the remaining Christians of the village.
*A second Mor Yakup Monastery is located in the village of Dibek (Syriac Badibe), having been rebuilt and occupied in 2013.
* The Mor Malke Monastery is located on the northern slope of Mount Izla and is a few miles south of the village of Üçköy; it is connected by road to the village. Mor Malke is one of the newer monasteries of the region in terms of architecture, as it was rebuilt in the 30s. The monastery has a school, a church, and some farmlands.
* One Monastery known as Mor Aho Monastery was abandoned during the 1900s, but was later turned into a small walled village, when two dozen or so Syriac villagers built houses in the courtyard of the Monastery because its high walls allowed for better security and defense than what their nearby village provided. The Monastery has one nun, but as it has no monks or consistent liturgy held in its church it is technically not a monastery.

The remains of several other monasteries exist in the region, such as that of the Mor Loʿozor Monastery, though these are uninhabited and mostly neglected due to the loss of Christian population in the region but also due to the expropriation and seizures of monasteries.

<text>Christen Sørensen Longomontanus (also as Longberg or Severin) (4 October 1562 – 8 October 1647) was a Danish astronomer.

The name Longomontanus was a Latinized form of the name of the village of Lomborg, Jutland, Denmark, where he was born. His father, a laborer called Søren, or Severin, died when Christen was eight years old. An uncle took charge of the child, and had him educated at Lemvig; but after three years sent him back to his mother, who needed his help to work the fields. She agreed that he could study during the winter months with the clergyman of the parish; this arrangement continued until 1577, when the ill-will of some of his relatives and his own desire for knowledge caused him to run away to Viborg.

There he attended the grammar school, working as a labourer to pay his expenses, and in 1588 went to Copenhagen with a high reputation for learning and ability. Engaged by Tycho Brahe in 1589 as his assistant in his great astronomical observatory of Uraniborg, he rendered invaluable service for eight years. He held Tycho Brahe in the highest regard and always supported his system and tried to improve upon it throughout his life. However, he did disagree with the Tycho Brahe&#x27;s system in some regards, he believed that the earth rotated unlike his master&#x27;s theory that it was immobile. During this time, Kepler joined the two in trying to come up with a theory on how to predict longitude at oppositions with complete accuracy. Longomontanus used Mars as a model for this. Having left the island of Hven with his master, he obtained his discharge at Copenhagen on 1 June 1597, in order to study at some German universities. He rejoined Tycho at Prague in January 1600, and having completed the Tychonic lunar theory, turned homeward again in August. Soon after this, Tycho Brahe&#x27;s untimely demise happened. After Tycho managed to become a mathematician that served the Emperor Rudolph II, he died in October 1601. The Emperor had to appoint a new Mathematician. When doing so, the expected choice would have been Longomontanus since he was Tycho&#x27;s preferred choice. However, Longomontanus was gone during this time in Denmark and Johannes Kepler was there, so he was anointed.  

He visited Frauenburg, where Copernicus had made his observations, took a master&#x27;s degree at Rostock, and at Copenhagen found a patron in Christian Friis, chancellor of Denmark, who employed him in his household. Appointed in 1603 rector of the school of Viborg, he was elected two years later to a professorship in the University of Copenhagen, and his promotion to the chair of mathematics ensued in 1607. This post was held by Longomontanus till his death in 1647.

Longomontanus was not an advanced thinker. He adhered to Tycho&#x27;s erroneous views about refraction, believed that comets were messengers of evil, and imagined that he had squared the circle. He found that the circle whose diameter is 43 has for its circumference the square root of 18252 which gives 3.14185... for the value of π. John Pell and others tried in vain to convince him of his error. In 1632 he started the construction of the &quot;Rundetårn&quot; (a stately astronomical tower in Copenhagen), but did not live to witness its completion. King Christian IV of Denmark, to whom he dedicated his &quot;Astronomia Danica&quot;, an exposition of the Tychonic system of the universe, conferred upon him the canonry of Lunden in Schleswig.

Longomontanus&#x27;s major contribution to science was to develop Tycho&#x27;s geoheliocentric model of the universe empirically and publicly to common acceptance. When Tycho died in 1601, his program for the restoration of astronomy was unfinished. The observational aspects were complete, but two important tasks remained, namely the selection and integration of the data into accounts of the motions of the planets, and the presentation of the results on the entire program in the form of a systematic treatise. Longomontanus assumed the responsibility and fulfilled both tasks in his voluminous &quot;Astronomia Danica&quot; (1622). Regarded as the testament of Tycho, the work was eagerly received in seventeenth-century astronomical literature. The book was highly accredited and many famous owners included Christopher Wren, Christiaan Huygens as well as the Royal Greenwich Observatory in England. The book mainly compared the three world systems of the time, these included the Copernicus, Tycho Brahe and Ptolemy schools of thought. But unlike Tycho&#x27;s, the geoheliocentric model of Longomontanus gave the Earth a proper daily rotation (as in the models of Ursus and Roslin). It is therefore sometimes called the &#x27;semi-Tychonic&#x27; system. The book was reprinted in 1640 and 1663, which indicates its popularity and the interest in the semi-Tychonic system in this period.

Having originally worked on calculating the Martian orbit for Tycho with Kepler, he had already modelled its orbit in his geoheliocentric model to an error in longitude of under 2 arcminutes when Kepler had still only achieved 8 arcminutes error in his heliocentric system, as he had not yet used elliptical orbits.

Some historians claim Kepler&#x27;s 1627 &quot;Rudolphine Tables&quot;, based on Tycho Brahe&#x27;s observations, were more accurate than any previous tables. But nobody has ever demonstrated they were more accurate than Longomontanus&#x27;s 1622 &quot;Danish Astronomy&quot; tables, also based upon Tycho&#x27;s observations.

<text>John Pell (1 March 1611 – 12 December 1685) was an English mathematician and political agent abroad. He was made Royal Chair of Mathematics at Orange College by the Prince of Orange, and was under the patronage of Sir Charles Cavendish. He was also a compeer and correspondent of René Descartes and Thomas Hobbes.

==Early life==
He was born at Southwick in West Sussex, England. His father, also named John Pell, was from Southwick, and his mother was Mary Holland, from Halden in Kent. The second of two sons, Pell&#x27;s older brother was Thomas Pell. By the time he was six, they were orphans, their father dying in 1616 and their mother the following year. John Pell the elder had a fine library, which proved valuable to the young Pell as he grew up. He was educated at Steyning Grammar School and entered Trinity College, Cambridge, at the age of 13. 

During his university career he became an accomplished linguist; even before taking a B.A. degree in 1629, he corresponded with Henry Briggs and other mathematicians. He was promoted by seniority to M.A. in 1630 and taught in the short-lived Chichester Academy set up by Samuel Hartlib. On 3 July 1632 he married Ithamaria Reginald (also rendered as Ithamara or Ithumaria, with the surname Reginolles), sister of the writer and polymath Bathsua Makin. They had four sons and four daughters. Ithumaria died in 1661. Some time before 1669 Pell remarried.

Pell spent much of the 1630s working under Hartlib&#x27;s influence, on topics in the area of pedagogy, encyclopedism and pansophy, combinatorics, and the legacy of Trithemius. By 1638 he had formulated a proposal for a universal language. In mathematics, he concentrated on expanding the scope of algebra in the theory of equations, and on mathematical tables. As part of a joint lobbying effort with Hartlib to find himself support to continue as a researcher, he had his short &quot;Idea of Mathematics&quot; printed in October 1638. It brought interested responses from Johann Moriaen and Marin Mersenne.

==Academic and diplomat==
His reputation and the influence of Sir William Boswell, the English resident, with the States-General procured his election in 1644 to the chair of mathematics in Amsterdam, after an earlier attempt immediately after Martin van den Hove left for Leiden had failed. From 1644 he worked on a polemical work, against Longomontanus. For this he put in a large effort soliciting help and testimonials: from Bonaventura Cavalieri, his patron Sir Charles Cavendish, René Descartes, Thomas Hobbes, Mersenne, Claude Mydorge, and Gilles de Roberval. It finally appeared as &quot;Controversy with Longomontanus concerning the Quadrature of the Circle&quot; (1647).

In 1646, on the invitation of Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, Pell accepted a professorship at the new Orange College at Breda, where he taught until 1652. He realised that war between the English and the Dutch was imminent and that he would be in an extremely difficult position in Breda, so returned to England before the outbreak of the First Anglo-Dutch War in July 1652. After his return, Oliver Cromwell appointed Pell to a post teaching mathematics in London.

From 1654 to 1658 Pell acted as Cromwell&#x27;s political agent in Zürich to the Protestant cantons of Switzerland; he cooperated with Samuel Morland, the English resident at Geneva. Pell was described in Zürich by the English traveller Sir John Reresby in about 1656 as &quot;a strange unknown person, not unsuiting the people he was sent to, nor the master [Cromwell] he came from. They are here so strict in their religion, they suffer not the Venetian ambassador to hear mass in his own house.&quot; Cromwell wanted to split the Protestant cantons of Switzerland off to join a Protestant League, with England at its head. However Pell&#x27;s negotiations were long drawn out and he returned to England to deliver his report only shortly before Cromwell&#x27;s death. He was unable to report as he waited in vain for an audience with the ailing Cromwell.
A mathematical pupil and disciple in Switzerland, from 1657, was Johann Heinrich Rahn, known as Rhonius. Rahn is credited with the invention of the division sign () from one of the classic symbols for Obelus; it has also been attributed to Pell, who taught Rahn a three-column spreadsheet-style technique of tabulation of calculations, and acted as editor for Rahn&#x27;s 1659 book &quot;Teutsche Algebra&quot; in which it appeared. This book by Rahn also contained what would become known as the &quot;Pell equation&quot;. Diophantine equations was a favourite subject with Pell; he lectured on them at Amsterdam. He is now best remembered, if perhaps erroneously, for the indeterminate equation

:formula_1

which is known as &quot;Pell&#x27;s equation&quot;. This problem was in fact proposed by Pierre de Fermat first to Bernard Frénicle de Bessy, and in 1657 to all mathematicians. Pell&#x27;s connection with the problem is through Rahn. It consisted of publication of the solutions of John Wallis and Lord Brouncker in his edition of Thomas Branker&#x27;s &quot;Translation of Rhonius&#x27;s Algebra&quot; (1668); added to his earlier editorial contributions, whatever they were, to the 1659 algebra book written by Rahn (i.e. Rhonius). This new edition by Pell of what was essentially Rahn&#x27;s work included a great deal of additional material on number theory, amounting to a reply to the 1657 book &quot;Exercitationes mathematicae&quot; by Frans van Schooten. It is also notable for its inclusion of a &quot;Table of Incomposits&quot;, an early large factor table.

==After the Restoration==
After his return to England, Pell took orders and in 1661 became rector of Fobbing in Essex. In 1663 he was given an honorary D. D. (Lambeth degree) and was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. At the same time he was presented by Bishop Gilbert Sheldon to the rectory of Laindon, Essex; Sheldon expected him to treat the positions as sinecures. He spent time visiting William Brereton, 3rd Baron Brereton, at Brereton Hall in Cheshire, having taught him mathematics at Breda, and after Brereton died in 1680 John Aubrey reported a very close friendship between the two men.

In 1673 Pell met Leibniz in London, and was able to inform him that some of his mathematical work had been anticipated by François Regnaud and Gabriel Mouton. His devotion to mathematics seems to have interfered with his advancement in the Church and with his private life. For a time he was confined as a debtor in the King&#x27;s Bench Prison. He lived, on the invitation of Dr Daniel Whistler, for a short time in 1682 at the College of Physicians, but died at the house of Mr Cothorne, reader of the church of St Giles-in-the Fields.

==Works==
Many of Pell&#x27;s manuscripts fell into the hands of Richard Busby, master of Westminster School, and afterwards came into the possession of the Royal Society; they are still preserved in nearly forty folio volumes in the British Library, which contain, not only Pell&#x27;s own memoirs, but much of his correspondence with the mathematicians of his time.

His chief works are:
*&quot;Astronomical History of Observations of Heavenly Motions and Appearances&quot; (1634)
*&quot;Ecliptica prognostica&quot; (1634)
*&quot;An Idea of Mathematicks&quot; (1638)
*&quot;Controversy with Longomontanus concerning the Quadrature of the Circle&quot; (1646?)
*&quot;A Table of Ten Thousand Square Numbers&quot; (fol.; 1672).

The &quot;Idea&quot; was a short manifesto. It made three suggestions: a mathematical encyclopedia and bibliography; a complete mathematics research library and collection of instruments, with state sponsorship; and a three-volume comprehensive set of mathematical textbooks, able to convey the state of the art to any scholar.

==Family==
John Pell&#x27;s brother, Thomas Pell (1612/3–1669), was a physician who emigrated to New England in the 1630s. In 1654, Thomas Pell signed a treaty with Chief Wampage and other Siwanoy Indian tribal members that granted him of tribal land, including all or part of the Bronx and land to the west along Long Island Sound in what is now Westchester County, extending west to the Hutchinson River and north to Mamaroneck. Having no children, he left his estate to his nephew Sir John Pell (1643–1702), one of the mathematician&#x27;s four sons, who travelled from England to New York and took up residence there as the first Lord of the Manor of Pelham. His descendants have continued to be prominent in American polity, including Ambassador and U.S. Representative Herbert Pell and U.S. Senator Claiborne Pell. Philip Pell II built Pelhamdale at Pelham Manor, New York about 1750, and another descendant, Stephen Hyatt Pell, restored Fort Ticonderoga, New York in 1909 and formally opened it to the public. (William Ferris Pell had bought the Fort and surrounding lands in 1820, and used the property as a summer retreat.)

Yet another of John Pell&#x27;s American descendants, Morris Birkbeck Pell, graduated as senior wrangler in mathematics at Cambridge University in 1849 and emigrated to Australia in 1852 to become the first professor of mathematics and natural philosophy at the newly inaugurated University of Sydney.

<text>Opera Boston was an opera company in Boston, Massachusetts. It specialized in less-frequently heard repertoire as well as modern works or opera premieres, along with opera education and outreach programs designed to bring opera education to children both in schools and after-school programs throughout the Boston area.

After eight years, it was announced on 23 December 2011 that Opera Boston would cease operations on 1 January 2012. Board chairman Winifred Gray and president Gregory Bulger cited &quot;an insurmountable budget deficit&quot; as the reason.

Its home base was the Cutler Majestic Theatre, a 1903 Beaux-Arts opera house designed by architect John Galen Howard.

In addition to its regular season the company mounted an &quot;Opera Unlimited Festival&quot; which presented 20th and 21st century chamber opera in an outdoor setting, free of charge. The Festival also commissioned new works.

<doc id="491577" wikidata="Q694558" url="?curid=491577" title="Wettin, Saxony-Anhalt">
<text>Wettin is a small town belonging to the municipality of Wettin-Löbejün in the Saale District of Saxony-Anhalt (&quot;Saxony-Ascania&quot;), in east-central Germany. It is situated on the River Saale, just north of Halle. It is known for Wettin Castle, the ancestral seat of the House of Wettin, the former ruling dynasty of Saxony, Poland, the United Kingdom, Belgium, and Bulgaria. The town and its name are of Slavic origin.

==Geography==
Wettin lies in the Saalekreis (Saale District) of the eastern German federal state of Saxony-Anhalt, on the river Saale, which flows into the Elbe further north. Wettin belongs to the municipality of Wettin-Löbejün which borders Saxony-Anhalt&#x27;s most populous city of Halle-on-the-Saale in the southeast. It further borders Petersberg and Salzatal in the Saale District, Gerbstedt in the district of Mansfeld-Südharz (&quot;Mansfield-Southern Harz&quot;), Könnern in the Salzlandkreis (&quot;Saltland District&quot;), and Südliches Anhalt in the district of Anhalt-Bitterfeld (&quot;Ascania-Bitterfield&quot;). The Saale District, which Wettin-Löbejün is a part of, surrounds the city of Halle. The nearest international airport is Leipzig/Halle Airport in Schkeuditz, southeast of Halle. The municipality of Wettin-Löbejün further consists of the villages of Brachwitz, Döblitz, Domnitz, Gimritz, Löbejün, Nauendorf, Neutz-Lettewitz, Plötz, and Rothenburg. Most of these villages are of Slavic origin.
==History==

Wettin was first documented as &quot;Vitin civitas&quot; in a 961 deed issued by German king Otto I. The settlement thereafter was a burgward within the Saxon Eastern March, held by Dietrich I von Wettin, the progenitor of the dynasty. His descendants became Margraves of Lusatia in 1032 and of Meissen in 1123. In 1288 Wettin was acquired by the Magdeburg archbishop Eric of Brandenburg. In 1680, it was annexed by the Electorate of Brandenburg and made part of the Duchy of Magdeburg.

Under Nazi Germany, it was the location of a forced labour subcamp of the prison in Halle (Saale).

;Mücheln: The small village of Mücheln (not to be confused with the larger Mücheln near Merseburg) became part of Wettin and includes the restored old chapel of the Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon (Knights Templar).

;Lützkendorf: As bombing targets of the Oil Campaign of World War II, the Lützkendorf oil facilities 2 miles east of Mücheln included
:*a small Wintershall AG crude oil refinery (100,000 tons/yr), 
:*a Bergius process hydrogenation unit (125,000 tons/yr) for blending gasolines, 
:*a Fischer-Tropsch plant (80,000 tons/yr) to process heavier gasoline cuts from synthesized oil, and 
:*tankage for about 75,000 metric tons.
:The Lützkendorf Grube supplied lignite from the south end of the mine to the two interconnected plants (&quot;Lutzkendorf&quot; and &quot;Lutzkendorf-Mücheln&quot;) at , and the facility also used tar for Low Temperature Carbonization.

<text>Counterfactual conditionals (also &quot;contrafactual&quot;, &quot;subjunctive&quot; or &quot;X-marked&quot;) are conditional sentences which discuss what would have been true under different circumstances, e.g. &quot;If Peter believed in ghosts, he would be afraid to be here.&quot; Counterfactuals are contrasted with indicatives, which are generally restricted to discussing open possibilities. Counterfactuals are characterized grammatically by their use of fake tense morphology, which some languages use in combination with other kinds of morphology including aspect and mood.

Counterfactuals are one of the most studied phenomena in philosophical logic, formal semantics, and philosophy of language. They were first discussed as a problem for the material conditional analysis of conditionals, which treats them all as trivially true. Starting in the 1960s, philosophers and linguists developed the now-classic possible world approach, in which a counterfactual&#x27;s truth hinges on its consequent holding at certain possible worlds where its antecedent holds. More recent formal analyses have treated them using tools such as causal models and dynamic semantics. Other research has addressed their metaphysical, psychological, and grammatical underpinnings, while applying some of the resultant insights to fields including history, marketing, and epidemiology.

==Overview==

=== Examples ===

An example of the difference between indicative and counterfactual conditionals is the following English minimal pair:

* Indicative conditional: If Sally &quot;owns&quot; a donkey, then she &quot;rides&quot; it. 
* Simple past counterfactual: If Sally &quot;owned&quot; a donkey, she &quot;would ride&quot; it.

These conditionals differ in both form and meaning. The indicative conditional uses the present tense form &quot;owns&quot; and therefore conveys that the speaker is agnostic about whether Sally in fact owns a donkey. The counterfactual example uses the fake tense form &quot;owned&quot; in the &quot;if&quot; clause and the past-inflected modal &quot;would&quot; in the &quot;then&quot; clause. As a result, it conveys that Sally does not in fact own a donkey. English has several other grammatical forms whose meanings are sometimes included under the umbrella of counterfactuality. One is the past perfect counterfactual, which contrasts with indicatives and simple past counterfactuals in its use of pluperfect morphology:

* Past perfect counterfactual: If it &quot;had been raining&quot; yesterday, then Sally &quot;would have been&quot; inside.

Another kind of conditional uses the form &quot;were&quot;, generally referred to as the &quot;irrealis&quot; or subjunctive form.

* &quot;Irrealis&quot; counterfactual: If it &quot;were raining&quot; right now, then Sally &quot;would be&quot; inside.

Past perfect and irrealis counterfactuals can undergo &quot;conditional inversion&quot;:

* Had it rained, Sally would have been inside.
* Were it raining, Sally would be inside.

=== Terminology ===

The term &quot;counterfactual conditional&quot; is widely used as an umbrella term for the kinds of sentences shown above. However, not all conditionals of this sort express contrary-to-fact meanings. For instance, the classic example known as the &quot;Anderson Case&quot; has the characteristic grammatical form of a counterfactual conditional, but does not convey that its antecedent is false or unlikely.
* Anderson Case: If Jones had taken arsenic, he would have shown just exactly those symptoms which he does in fact show.

Such conditionals are also widely referred to as &quot;subjunctive conditionals&quot;, though this term is likewise acknowledged as a misnomer even by those who use it. Many languages do not have a morphological subjunctive (e.g. Danish and Dutch) and many that do have it do not use it for this sort of conditional (e.g. French, Swahili, all Indo-Aryan languages that have a subjunctive). Moreover, languages that do use the subjunctive for such conditionals only do so if they have a specific past subjunctive form. Thus, subjunctive marking is neither necessary nor sufficient for membership in this class of conditionals.

The terms &quot;counterfactual&quot; and &quot;subjunctive&quot; have sometimes been repurposed for more specific uses. For instance, the term &quot;counterfactual&quot; is sometimes applied to conditionals that express a contrary-to-fact meaning, regardless of their grammatical structure. Along similar lines, the term &quot;subjunctive&quot; is sometimes used to refer to conditionals that bear fake past or irrealis marking, regardless of the meaning they convey.

Recently the term &quot;X-Marked&quot; has been proposed as a replacement, evoking the &quot;ex&quot;tra marking that these conditionals bear. Those adopting this terminology refer to indicative conditionals as &quot;O-Marked&quot; conditionals, reflecting their marking.

The &quot;antecedent&quot; of a conditional is sometimes referred to as its &quot;&quot;if&quot;-clause&quot; or &quot;protasis&quot;. The &quot;consequent&quot; of a conditional is sometimes referred to as a &quot;then&quot;-clause or as an apodosis.

==Logic and semantics==

Counterfactuals were first discussed by Nelson Goodman as a problem for the material conditional used in classical logic. Because of these problems, early work such as that of W.V. Quine held that counterfactuals are not strictly logical, and do not make true or false claims about the world. However, in the 1960s and 1970s, work by Robert Stalnaker and David Lewis showed that these problems are surmountable given an appropriate intensional logical framework. Work since then in formal semantics, philosophical logic, philosophy of language, and cognitive science has built on this insight, taking it in a variety of different directions.

===Classic puzzles===

====The problem of counterfactuals====

According to the material conditional analysis, a natural language conditional, a statement of the form &quot;if P then Q&quot;, is true whenever its antecedent, P, is false. Since counterfactual conditionals are those whose antecedents are false, this analysis would wrongly predict that all counterfactuals are vacuously true. Goodman illustrates this point using the following pair in a context where it is understood that the piece of butter under discussion had not been heated. 
# If that piece of butter had been heated to 150°, it would have melted.
# If that piece of butter had been heated to 150°, it would not have melted.

More generally, such examples show that counterfactuals are not truth-functional. In other words, knowing whether the antecedent and consequent are actually true is not sufficient to determine whether the counterfactual itself is true.

====Context dependence and vagueness====

Counterfactuals are &quot;context dependent&quot; and &quot;vague&quot;. For example, either of the following statements can be reasonably held true, though not at the same time:

# If Caesar had been in command in Korea, he would have used the atom bomb.
# If Caesar had been in command in Korea, he would have used catapults.

====Non-monotonicity====

Counterfactuals are &quot;non-monotonic&quot; in the sense that their truth values can be changed by adding extra material to their antecedents. This fact is illustrated by &quot;Sobel sequences&quot; such as the following:

# If Hannah had drunk coffee, she would be happy.
# If Hannah had drunk coffee and the coffee had gasoline in it, she would be sad.
# If Hannah had drunk coffee and the coffee had gasoline in it and Hannah were a gasoline-drinking robot, she would be happy.

One way of formalizing this fact is to say that the principle of &quot;Antecedent Strengthening&quot; should not hold for any connective &gt; intended as a formalization of natural language conditionals.

* Antecedent Strengthening: formula_1

=== Possible worlds accounts ===

The most common logical accounts of counterfactuals are couched in the possible world semantics. Broadly speaking, these approaches have in common that they treat a counterfactual &quot;A&quot; &gt; &quot;B&quot; as true if &quot;B&quot; holds across some set of possible worlds where A is true. They vary mainly in how they identify the set of relevant A-worlds.

David Lewis&#x27;s &quot;variably strict conditional&quot; is considered the classic analysis within philosophy. The closely related &quot;premise semantics&quot; proposed by Angelika Kratzer is often taken as the standard within linguistics. However, there are numerous possible worlds approaches on the market, including dynamic variants of the &quot;strict conditional&quot; analysis originally dismissed by Lewis.

====Strict conditional====

The strict conditional analysis treats natural language counterfactuals as being equivalent to the modal logic formula formula_2. In this formula, formula_3 expresses necessity and formula_4 is understood as material implication. This approach was first proposed in 1912 by C.I. Lewis as part of his axiomatic approach to modal logic. In modern relational semantics, this means that the strict conditional is true at &quot;w&quot; iff the corresponding material conditional is true throughout the worlds accessible from &quot;w&quot;. More formally:

* Given a model formula_5, we have that formula_6 iff formula_7 for all formula_8 such that formula_9

Unlike the material conditional, the strict conditional is not vacuously true when its antecedent is false. To see why, observe that both formula_10 and formula_2 will be false at formula_12 if there is some accessible world formula_8 where formula_10 is true and formula_15 is not. The strict conditional is also context-dependent, at least when given a relational semantics (or something similar). In the relational framework, accessibility relations are parameters of evaluation which encode the range of possibilities which are treated as &quot;live&quot; in the context. Since the truth of a strict conditional can depend on the accessibility relation used to evaluate it, this feature of the strict conditional can be used to capture context-dependence.

The strict conditional analysis encounters many known problems, notably monotonicity. In the classical relational framework, when using a standard notion of entailment, the strict conditional is monotonic, i.e. it validates &quot;Antecedent Strengthening&quot;. To see why, observe that if formula_16 holds at every world accessible from formula_12, the monotonicity of the material conditional guarantees that formula_18 will be too. Thus, we will have that formula_19.

This fact led to widespread abandonment of the strict conditional, in particular in favor of Lewis&#x27;s variably strict analysis. However, subsequent work has revived the strict conditional analysis by appealing to context sensitivity. This approach was pioneered by Warmbrōd (1981), who argued that &quot;Sobel sequences&quot; do not demand a &quot;non-monotonic&quot; logic, but in fact can rather be explained by speakers switching to more permissive accessibility relations as the sequence proceeds. In his system, a counterfactual like &quot;If Hannah had drunk coffee, she would be happy&quot; would normally be evaluated using a model where Hannah&#x27;s coffee is gasoline-free in all accessible worlds. If this same model were used to evaluate a subsequent utterance of &quot;If Hannah had drunk coffee and the coffee had gasoline in it...&quot;, this second conditional would come out as trivially true, since there are no accessible worlds where its antecedent holds. Warmbrōd&#x27;s idea was that speakers will switch to a model with a more permissive accessibility relation in order to avoid this triviality.

Subsequent work by Kai von Fintel (2001), Thony Gillies (2007), and Malte Willer (2019) has formalized this idea in the framework of dynamic semantics, and given a number of linguistic arguments in favor. One argument is that conditional antecedents license negative polarity items, which are thought to be licensed only by monotonic operators.

# If Hannah had drunk any coffee, she would be happy.

Another argument in favor of the strict conditional comes from Irene Heim&#x27;s observation that Sobel Sequences are generally infelicitous (i.e. sound strange) in reverse.

# If Hannah had drunk coffee with gasoline in it, she would not be happy. But if she had drunk coffee, she would be happy.

Sarah Moss (2012) and Karen Lewis (2018) have responded to these arguments, showing that a version of the variably strict analysis can account for these patterns, and arguing that such an account is preferable since it can also account for apparent exceptions. As of 2020, this debate continues in the literature, with accounts such as Willer (2019) arguing that a strict conditional account can cover these exceptions as well.

====Variably strict conditional====

In the variably strict approach, the semantics of a conditional &quot;A&quot; &gt; &quot;B&quot; is given by some function on the relative closeness of worlds where A is true and B is true, on the one hand, and worlds where A is true but B is not, on the other.

On Lewis&#x27;s account, A &gt; C is (a) vacuously true if and only if there are no worlds where A is true (for example, if A is logically or metaphysically impossible); (b) non-vacuously true if and only if, among the worlds where A is true, some worlds where C is true are closer to the actual world than any world where C is not true; or (c) false otherwise. Although in Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Counterfactuals&quot; it was unclear what he meant by &#x27;closeness&#x27;, in later writings, Lewis made it clear that he did &quot;not&quot; intend the metric of &#x27;closeness&#x27; to be simply our ordinary notion of overall similarity.

Example:
:If he had eaten more at breakfast, he would not have been hungry at 11 am.
On Lewis&#x27;s account, the truth of this statement consists in the fact that, among possible worlds where he ate more for breakfast, there is at least one world where he is not hungry at 11 am and which is closer to our world than any world where he ate more for breakfast but is still hungry at 11 am.

Stalnaker&#x27;s account differs from Lewis&#x27;s most notably in his acceptance of the &quot;limit&quot; and &quot;uniqueness assumptions&quot;. The uniqueness assumption is the thesis that, for any antecedent A, among the possible worlds where A is true, there is a single (&quot;unique&quot;) one that is &quot;closest&quot; to the actual world. The limit assumption is the thesis that, for a given antecedent A, if there is a chain of possible worlds where A is true, each closer to the actual world than its predecessor, then the chain has a &quot;limit&quot;: a possible world where A is true that is closer to the actual worlds than all worlds in the chain. (The uniqueness assumption entails the limit assumption, but the limit assumption does not entail the uniqueness assumption.) On Stalnaker&#x27;s account, A &gt; C is non-vacuously true if and only if, at the closest world where A is true, C is true. So, the above example is true just in case at the single, closest world where he ate more breakfast, he does not feel hungry at 11 am. Although it is controversial, Lewis rejected the limit assumption (and therefore the uniqueness assumption) because it rules out the possibility that there might be worlds that get closer and closer to the actual world without limit. For example, there might be an infinite series of worlds, each with a coffee cup a smaller fraction of an inch to the left of its actual position, but none of which is uniquely the closest. (See Lewis 1973: 20.)

One consequence of Stalnaker&#x27;s acceptance of the uniqueness assumption is that, if the law of excluded middle is true, then all instances of the formula (A &gt; C) ∨ (A &gt; ¬C) are true. The law of excluded middle is the thesis that for all propositions p, p ∨ ¬p is true. If the uniqueness assumption is true, then for every antecedent A, there is a uniquely closest world where A is true. If the law of excluded middle is true, any consequent C is either true or false at that world where A is true. So for every counterfactual A &gt; C, either A &gt; C or A &gt; ¬C is true. This is called conditional excluded middle (CEM). Example:

:(1) If the fair coin had been flipped, it would have landed heads.
:(2) If the fair coin had been flipped, it would have landed tails (i.e. not heads).
On Stalnaker&#x27;s analysis, there is a closest world where the fair coin mentioned in (1) and (2) is flipped and at that world either it lands heads or it lands tails. So either (1) is true and (2) is false or (1) is false and (2) true. On Lewis&#x27;s analysis, however, both (1) and (2) are false, for the worlds where the fair coin lands heads are no more or less close than the worlds where they land tails. For Lewis, &quot;If the coin had been flipped, it would have landed heads or tails&quot; is true, but this does not entail that &quot;If the coin had been flipped, it would have landed heads, or: If the coin had been flipped it would have landed tails.&quot;

=== Other accounts ===

====Causal models====

The &quot;causal models framework&quot; analyzes counterfactuals in terms of systems of structural equations. In a system of equations, each variable is assigned a value that is an explicit function of other variables in the system. Given such a model, the sentence &quot;&quot;Y&quot; would be &quot;y&quot; had &quot;X&quot; been &quot;x&quot;&quot; (formally, &quot;X = x&quot; &gt; &quot;Y = y&quot; ) is defined as the assertion: If we replace the equation currently determining &quot;X&quot; with a constant &quot;X = x&quot;, and solve the set of equations for variable &quot;Y&quot;, the solution obtained will be &quot;Y = y&quot;. This definition has been shown to be compatible with the axioms of possible world semantics and forms the basis for causal inference in the natural and social sciences, since each structural equation in those domains corresponds to a familiar causal mechanism that can be meaningfully reasoned about by investigators. This approach was developed by Judea Pearl (2000) as a means of encoding fine-grained intuitions about causal relations which are difficult to capture in other proposed systems.

====Belief revision====


In the belief revision framework, counterfactuals are treated using a formal implementation of the &quot;Ramsey test&quot;. In these systems, a counterfactual &quot;A&quot; &gt; &quot;B&quot; holds if and only if the addition of &quot;A&quot; to the current body of knowledge has &quot;B&quot; as a consequence. This condition relates counterfactual conditionals to belief revision, as the evaluation of &quot;A&quot; &gt; &quot;B&quot; can be done by first revising the current knowledge with &quot;A&quot; and then checking whether &quot;B&quot; is true in what results. Revising is easy when &quot;A&quot; is consistent with the current beliefs, but can be hard otherwise. Every semantics for belief revision can be used for evaluating conditional statements. Conversely, every method for evaluating conditionals can be seen as a way for performing revision.

====Ginsberg====

Ginsberg (1986) has proposed a semantics for conditionals which assumes that the current beliefs form a set of propositional formulae, considering the maximal sets of these formulae that are consistent with &quot;A&quot;, and adding &quot;A&quot; to each. The rationale is that each of these maximal sets represents a possible state of belief in which &quot;A&quot; is true that is as similar as possible to the original one. The conditional statement &quot;A&quot; &gt; &quot;B&quot; therefore holds if and only if &quot;B&quot; is true in all such sets.

== The grammar of counterfactuality ==
Languages use different strategies for expressing counterfactuality. Some have a dedicated counterfactual morphemes, while others recruit morphemes which otherwise express tense, aspect, mood, or a combination thereof. Since the early 2000s, linguists, philosophers of language, and philosophical logicians have intensely studied the nature of this grammatical marking, and it continues to be an active area of study.

=== Fake tense ===

==== Description ====

In many languages, counterfactuality is marked by past tense morphology. Since these uses of the past tense do not convey their typical temporal meaning, they are called &quot;fake past&quot; or &quot;fake tense&quot;. English is one language which uses fake past to mark counterfactuality, as shown in the following minimal pair. In the indicative example, the bolded words are present tense forms. In the counterfactual example, both words take their past tense form. This use of the past tense cannot have its ordinary temporal meaning, since it can be used with the adverb &quot;tomorrow&quot; without creating a contradiction.

# Indicative: If Natalia leaves tomorrow, she will arrive on time.
# Counterfactual: If Natalia left tomorrow, she would arrive on time.

Modern Hebrew is another language where counterfactuality is marked with a fake past morpheme:

Palestinian Arabic is another:

Fake past is extremely prevalent cross-linguistically, either on its own or in combination with other morphemes. Moreover, theoretical linguists and philosophers of language have argued that other languages&#x27; strategies for marking counterfactuality are actually realizations of fake tense along with other morphemes. For this reason, fake tense has often been treated as the locus of the counterfactual meaning itself.

==== Formal analyses ====

In formal semantics and philosophical logic, fake past is regarded as a puzzle, since it is not obvious why so many unrelated languages would repurpose a tense morpheme to mark counterfactuality. Proposed solutions to this puzzle divide into two camps: &quot;past as modal&quot; and &quot;past as past&quot;. These approaches differ in whether or not they take the past tense&#x27;s core meaning to be about time.

In the &quot;past as modal approach&quot;, the denotation of the past tense is not fundamentally about time. Rather, it is an underspecified skeleton which can apply either to modal or temporal content. For instance, the particular past as modal proposal of Iatridou (2000), the past tense&#x27;s core meaning is what is shown schematically below:

# The topic &quot;x&quot; is not the contextually-provided &quot;x&quot;

Depending on how this denotation composes, &quot;x&quot; can be a time interval or a possible world. When &quot;x&quot; is a time, the past tense will convey that the sentence is talking about non-current times, i.e. the past. When &quot;x&quot; is a world, it will convey that the sentence is talking about a potentially non-actual possibility. The latter is what allows for a counterfactual meaning.

The &quot;past as past approach&quot; treats the past tense as having an inherently temporal denotation. On this approach, so-called fake tense is not actually fake. It differs from &quot;real&quot; tense only in how it takes scope, i.e. which component of the sentence&#x27;s meaning is shifted to an earlier time. When a sentence has &quot;real&quot; past marking, it discusses something that happened at an earlier time; when a sentence has so-called fake past marking, it discusses possibilities that were accessible at an earlier time but may no longer be.

=== Fake aspect ===

&quot;Fake aspect&quot; often accompanies fake tense in languages that mark aspect. In some languages (e.g. Modern Greek, Zulu, and the Romance languages) this fake aspect is imperfective. In other languages (e.g. Palestinian Arabic) it is perfective. However, in other languages including Russian and Polish, counterfactuals can have either perfective or imperfective aspect.

Fake imperfective aspect is demonstrated by the two Modern Greek sentences below. These examples form a minimal pair, since they are identical except that the first uses past imperfective marking where the second uses past perfective marking. As a result of this morphological difference, the first has a counterfactual meaning, while the second does not.


This imperfective marking has been argued to be fake on the grounds that it is compatible with &quot;completive adverbials&quot; such as &quot;in one month&quot;:

In ordinary non-conditional sentences, such adverbials are compatible with perfective aspect but not with imperfective aspect:


==Psychology==
People engage in counterfactual thinking frequently. Experimental evidence indicates that people&#x27;s thoughts about counterfactual conditionals differ in important ways from their thoughts about indicative conditionals.

===Comprehension===
Participants in experiments were asked to read sentences, including counterfactual conditionals, e.g., &quot;If Mark had left home early, he would have caught the train&quot;. Afterwards, they were asked to identify which sentences they had been shown. They often mistakenly believed they had been shown sentences corresponding to the presupposed facts, e.g., &quot;Mark did not leave home early&quot; and &quot;Mark did not catch the train&quot;. In other experiments, participants were asked to read short stories that contained counterfactual conditionals, e.g., &quot;If there had been roses in the flower shop then there would have been lilies&quot;. Later in the story, they read sentences corresponding to the presupposed facts, e.g., &quot;there were no roses and there were no lilies&quot;. The counterfactual conditional primed them to read the sentence corresponding to the presupposed facts very rapidly; no such priming effect occurred for indicative conditionals. They spent different amounts of time &#x27;updating&#x27; a story that contains a counterfactual conditional compared to one that contains factual information and focused on different parts of counterfactual conditionals.

===Reasoning===

Experiments have compared the inferences people make from counterfactual conditionals and indicative conditionals. Given a counterfactual conditional, e.g., &quot;If there had been a circle on the blackboard then there would have been a triangle&quot;, and the subsequent information &quot;in fact there was no triangle&quot;, participants make the modus tollens inference &quot;there was no circle&quot; more often than they do from an indicative conditional. Given the counterfactual conditional and the subsequent information &quot;in fact there was a circle&quot;, participants make the modus ponens inference as often as they do from an indicative conditional.

===Psychological accounts===
Byrne argues that people construct mental representations that encompass two possibilities when they understand, and reason from, a counterfactual conditional, e.g., &quot;if Oswald had not shot Kennedy, then someone else would have&quot;. They envisage the conjecture &quot;Oswald did not shoot Kennedy and someone else did&quot; and they also think about the presupposed facts &quot;Oswald did shoot Kennedy and someone else did not&quot;. According to the mental model theory of reasoning, they construct mental models of the alternative possibilities.

<doc id="491582" wikidata="Q2915273" url="?curid=491582" title="Wisconsin State Capitol">
<text>The Wisconsin State Capitol, located in Madison, Wisconsin, houses both chambers of the Wisconsin Legislature along with the Wisconsin Supreme Court and the Office of the Governor. Completed in 1917, the building is the fifth to serve as the Wisconsin capitol since the first territorial legislature convened in 1836 and the third building since Wisconsin was granted statehood in 1848. The Wisconsin State Capitol is the tallest building in Madison, a distinction that has been preserved by legislation that prohibits buildings taller than the columns surrounding the dome. The Capitol is located at the southwestern end of the Madison Isthmus in downtown Madison, bordered by streets that make up the Capitol Square.

==History==
The first capitol was a prefabricated wood-frame council house without heat or water that had been sent hastily to Belmont. Legislators met there for 42 days after Belmont was designated the capital of Wisconsin Territory. The session chose Madison as the site of the capitol, and Burlington, Iowa, as the site of further legislative sessions until Madison could be ready. The council house and an associated lodging house still stand and are operated by the Wisconsin Historical Society as the First Capitol Historic Site.

The second capitol was constructed in 1837 in Madison of stone cut from Maple Bluff and oak cut locally. Located on the site of the present capitol, it was a small but typical frontier capitol that cost $60,000 to build . Growing government needs forced the state to construct a new capitol on the same site. This structure, with a similar U.S. Capitol-inspired dome, was designed by Madison architects August Kutzbock and Samuel Hunter Donnell and built between 1857 and 1869. During 1882, it was expanded at a cost of $900,000, with two wings to the north and south. In 1903, however, a commission began researching replacement of the structure.

On the night of February 26, 1904, a gas jet ignited a newly varnished ceiling in the third capitol building. Although the building had an advanced fire-fighting system, the nearby University of Wisconsin–Madison&#x27;s reservoir, which supplied the capitol, was empty, allowing the fire to spread substantially before the switch to alternative city water supplies could be made. Madison firefighters could not handle the blaze on their own, so additional men and equipment had to be brought from Milwaukee. The effectiveness of the reinforcements was initially hampered by very cold temperatures; by the time they reached Madison, their equipment had frozen and needed to be thawed. As a result, the entire structure, except the north wing, burned to the ground. Numerous records, books, and historical artifacts were lost, including the mount of Old Abe, a Civil War mascot. However, through the efforts of university students, much of the state law library was saved. The fire occurred just after the state legislature had voted to cancel the capitol&#x27;s fire insurance policy.

==Construction and design==
Construction of the present capitol, the fourth building and the third in Madison, began in late 1906 and was completed in 1917 at a cost of $7.25 million. The architect was George B. Post &amp; Sons from New York. He made the Capitol look the same on every side so that none of the businesses on the Square felt like they were on the back side. Because of financial limitations and the need for immediate office space to house state government employees, the construction of the new building was extended over several years and emphasized building one wing at a time.

The Capitol is 284 feet, 5 inches tall from the ground floor to the top of the &quot;Wisconsin&quot; statue on the dome. The &quot;Wisconsin&quot; statue on the dome was sculpted in 1920 by Daniel Chester French of New York. Its left hand holds a globe surmounted by an eagle and her right arm is outstretched to symbolize the state motto, &quot;Forward&quot;. It wears a helmet with the state animal, the badger, on top. It is made of hollow bronze covered with gold leaf. &quot;Wisconsin&quot; is 15 feet, 5 inches tall and weighs three tons. The statue is commonly misidentified as &quot;Lady Forward&quot; or &quot;Miss Forward&quot;, which is the name of another statue on the capitol grounds.

The capitol ceiling, visible from the center of the building, features &quot;Resources of Wisconsin&quot;, a mural by Edwin Howland Blashfield. Due to the domed shape of the ceiling, the mural was painted in pieces and was assembled similarly to a jigsaw puzzle. It features a woman sitting on a throne of clouds, representing Wisconsin. Wisconsin is surrounded by other women, wrapped in a large American Flag, who are reaching for goods such as tobacco, lead, and fruits.

The capitol was constructed of 43 types of stone from six countries and eight states. The exterior stone is Bethel white granite from Vermont, making the exterior dome the largest granite dome in the world. The corridor floors, walls and columns are of marble from the states of Tennessee, Missouri, Vermont, Georgia, New York, and Maryland; granite from the states of Wisconsin and Minnesota; and limestone from the states of Minnesota and Illinois. Marble from the countries of France, Italy, Greece, Algeria and Germany, and syenite from Norway are also represented. Other Wisconsin granites are located throughout the public hallways on the ground, first, and second floors.

The building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2001. A 1990 state law prevents any building within one mile of the capitol from being taller than the base of the columns surrounding and supporting its dome.

===Restoration===
From 1988 to 2002, the capitol underwent a renovation and restoration project costing $158.8 million. The project was performed wing by wing, the same as the original construction of the capitol. The purpose of the project was to convert the capitol into a modern working building, while restoring and preserving its original 1917 appearance. Remodeling projects of the 1960s and 70s had introduced features out of character with the architecture of the building, such as dropped ceilings, movable partitions and fluorescent light fixtures, and many original decorative stencils were painted over. The restoration project returned public spaces to their original appearance. Original decorative stencils were repaired. Stairs, which had been sealed during the 1970s, were uncovered. The exterior granite was cleaned and repaired by workers who rappelled down from the dome. The renovation plan also included integrating modern technology into the original architecture. Electrical, mechanical (such as plumbing and heating), and communications systems were upgraded; asbestos was removed, and air conditioning was added. The capitol basement floor was lowered two feet to provide additional usable office space. Legislative offices were rebuilt as two-room suites (originally legislators did not have offices in the capitol, only their desks in the Senate and Assembly chambers). Modern office furniture was designed to look like the original oak furniture.

==Sculpture program==
Architect Post planned an elaborate sculpture program for the building. Initially the commission for the statue of &quot;Wisconsin&quot; on the top of the dome was promised to Helen Farnsworth Mears but when Daniel Chester French agreed to produce the finial figure, the commission was switched to him. This work, often referred to as the &quot;Golden Lady&quot;, consists of an allegorical figure reminiscent of Athena, dressed in Greek garb, and wearing a helmet topped by a badger, the Wisconsin state totem. In the left hand it holds a globe with an eagle perched on top. Across its chest is a large W, for Wisconsin.

Post&#x27;s original concept for the building required four small domes to be placed at the base of the large one, but the plans were changed and the domes were replaced by four sculptural groups by Karl Bitter. These groups (again, in Greek clothing) symbolized &quot;Faith&quot;, &quot;Strength&quot;, &quot;Prosperity and Abundance&quot; and &quot;Knowledge&quot;.

Each of the four wings of the building is fronted by a pediment whose figures relate to the principal activities that were to occur within. Thus the east wing, housing the Supreme Court, features a pediment by Bitter entitled &quot;Law&quot;; the south has Adolph Alexander Weinman&#x27;s &quot;Virtues and Traits of Character&quot;, for the wing containing the State Senate. Bitter&#x27;s other pediment, the west, is &quot;Agriculture&quot;, while Attilio Piccirilli&#x27;s &quot;Wisdom and Learning of the World&quot; adorns the north pediment. The carving of all these sculptures is attributed to the Piccirilli Brothers.

==Fossils==
Naturally occurring fossils are found throughout the capitol:

* Starfish: North wing, left grand stairs, 1st to 2nd floor, fourth step from bottom
* Coral: West wing, second floor, railing overlooking central corridor, outside of Assembly chamber
* Nautiloid: North wing, second floor, left of north hearing room entrance
* Gastropod: West wing, left grand stairs; 1st to 2nd floor railing, above 9th step from top
* Ammonoid: North wing, second floor, north hearing room
* Bryozoan: South wing, second floor, left grand stairs, top step
* Burrows: Northwest, second floor, wall to right room 225 NW
* Brachiopods: East wing, ground floor, pillars near entrance

<text>William Gates (born December 28, 1971) is an American former college basketball player. Gates and Arthur Agee are the two subjects of the 1994 documentary film &quot;Hoop Dreams&quot;.

==Early life and education ==
Gates was a young man from the Cabrini–Green housing projects. He and Arthur Agee hoped to have their basketball talent turned into professional careers with the NBA. The documentary &quot;Hoop Dreams&quot; followed them through their recruitment by St. Joseph High School in Westchester, Illinois. During high school, he worked hard to improve his basketball skills and his academics to the best of his ability, but he initially struggled with a low reading level. He struggled to get the required score of 18 on the ACT exam needed to earn a basketball scholarship at Marquette University and eventually managed a 17.5 aggregate score, which was rounded to 18. At St. Joseph, Gates suffered a knee injury that limited his playing and recruitment offers. He played three seasons for Marquette from 1991 to 1995. He appeared in 80 games, making 29 starts and scoring 399 points. He graduated from Marquette in 1995 with a communications degree.

==Life after college ==
In 2001, Gates worked out with NBA star Michael Jordan in preparation for Jordan&#x27;s comeback and was offered a tryout with the Washington Wizards but injured his foot. His brother, Curtis Gates, also seen in the film, was murdered on September 10, 2001, after being caught in a love triangle.

After the end of his basketball career, Gates got a Bible degree at Moody Bible Institute in Chicago and became pastor at Living Faith Community Center in Cabrini-Green, a position he held until July 2012, when his family moved to the San Antonio, Texas area. Gates&#x27; eldest son (William Gates Jr.) followed in his father&#x27;s basketball footsteps, averaging 23.5 points a game his senior season at Samuel Clemens High School in Schertz, Texas, and receiving a full scholarship to Furman University in South Carolina. He spent his freshman season and the first half of his sophomore season at Furman. He was named to the Southern Conference All-Freshman Team while with the Paladins. After one season, Gates Jr. transferred to Houston Baptist University, where he played his next three seasons.

In 2021 Gates connected with his &quot;Hoop Dreams&quot; co-star Arthur Agee and producer Matt Hoffar to launch &quot;Hoop Dreams The Podcast&quot; in partnership with the Unlearning Network, a Vancouver-based media company.

<doc id="491585" wikidata="Q185089" url="?curid=491585" title="Acidosis">
<text>Acidosis is a biological process producing hydrogen ions and increasing their concentration in blood or body fluids. pH is the negative log of hydrogen ion concentration and so it is decreased by a process of acidosis.

== Acidemia ==

The term acidemia describes the state of low blood pH, when arterial pH falls below 7.35 (except in the fetus – see below) while &quot;acidosis&quot; is used to describe the processes leading to these states. The use of acidosis for a low pH creates an ambiguity in its meaning. The difference is important where a patient has factors causing both acidosis and alkalosis, wherein the relative severity of both determines whether the result is a high, low, or normal pH.

Alkalemia occurs at a pH over 7.45. Arterial blood gas analysis and other tests are required to separate the main causes. In certain situations the main cause is clear. For instance, a diabetic with ketoacidosis is a recognizable case where the main cause of acidemia is essentially obvious.

The rate of cellular metabolic activity affects and, at the same time, is affected by the pH of the body fluids. In mammals, the normal pH of arterial blood lies between 7.35 and 7.50 depending on the species (e.g., healthy human-arterial blood pH varies between 7.35 and 7.45).

==Signs and symptoms==

Nervous system involvement may be seen with acidosis and occurs more often with respiratory acidosis than with metabolic acidosis. Signs and symptoms that may be seen in acidosis include headaches, confusion, feeling tired, tremors, sleepiness, flapping tremor, and dysfunction of the cerebrum of the brain which may progress to coma if there is no intervention.

==Metabolic acidosis==
Metabolic acidosis may result from either increased production of metabolic acids, such as lactic acid, or disturbances in the ability to excrete acid via the kidneys, such as either renal tubular acidosis or the acidosis of kidney failure, which is associated with an accumulation of urea and creatinine as well as metabolic acid residues of protein catabolism.

Lactic acidosis occurs whenever the demand for oxygen by tissues exceeds the supply and the more efficient aerobic metabolism is supplemented by anaerobic metabolism that produces lactate.
Increased demand occurs, for example, with high intensity exercise such as sprinting.
Inadequate supply occurs, for example, with hypoperfusion as occurs in hemorrhagic shock.

A rise in lactate out of proportion to the level of pyruvate, e.g., in mixed venous blood, is termed &quot;excess lactate&quot;, and is an indicator of anaerobic glycolysis occurring in muscle cells, as seen during strenuous exercise.
Once oxygenation is restored, the acidosis clears quickly. Another example of increased production of acids occurs in starvation and diabetic ketoacidosis. It is due to the accumulation of ketoacids (via excessive ketosis) and reflects a severe shift from glycolysis to lipolysis for energy needs.

Acid consumption from poisoning such as methanol ingestion, elevated levels of iron in the blood, and chronically decreased production of bicarbonate may also produce metabolic acidosis.

Metabolic acidosis is compensated for in the lungs, as increased exhalation of carbon dioxide promptly shifts the buffering equation to reduce metabolic acid. This is a result of stimulation to chemoreceptors, which increases alveolar ventilation, leading to respiratory compensation, otherwise known as Kussmaul breathing (a specific type of hyperventilation). Should this situation persist, the patient is at risk of exhaustion leading to respiratory failure.

Mutations to the V-ATPase &#x27;a4&#x27; or &#x27;B1&#x27; isoforms result in distal renal tubular acidosis, a condition that leads to metabolic acidosis, in some cases with sensorineural deafness.

Arterial blood gases will indicate low pH, low blood HCO3, and normal or low PaCO2.
In addition to arterial blood gas, an anion gap can also differentiate between possible causes.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is useful for calculating blood pH, because blood is a buffer solution. In the clinical setting, this equation is usually used to calculate HCO3 from measurements of pH and PaCO2 in arterial blood gases. The amount of metabolic acid accumulating can also be quantitated by using buffer base deviation, a derivative estimate of the metabolic as opposed to the respiratory component. In hypovolemic shock for example, approximately 50% of the metabolic acid accumulation is lactic acid, which disappears as blood flow and oxygen debt are corrected.

===Treatment===

Treatment of uncompensated metabolic acidosis is focused upon correcting the underlying problem. When metabolic acidosis is severe and can no longer be compensated for adequately by the lungs or kidneys, neutralizing the acidosis with infusions of bicarbonate may be required.

===Fetal metabolic acidemia===
In the fetus, the normal range differs based on which umbilical vessel is sampled (umbilical vein pH is normally 7.25 to 7.45; umbilical artery pH is normally 7.18 to 7.38). Fetal metabolic acidemia is defined as an umbilical vessel pH of less than 7.20 and a base excess of less than −8.

==Respiratory acidosis==

Respiratory acidosis results from a build-up of carbon dioxide in the blood (hypercapnia) due to hypoventilation. It is most often caused by pulmonary problems, although head injuries, drugs (especially anaesthetics and sedatives), and brain tumors can cause this acidemia. Pneumothorax, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, asthma, severe pneumonia, and aspiration are among the most frequent causes. It can also occur as a compensatory response to chronic metabolic alkalosis.

One key to distinguish between respiratory and metabolic acidosis is that in respiratory acidosis, the CO2 is increased while the bicarbonate is either normal (uncompensated) or increased (compensated). Compensation occurs if respiratory acidosis is present, and a chronic phase is entered with partial buffering of the acidosis through renal bicarbonate retention.

However, in cases where chronic illnesses that compromise pulmonary function persist, such as late-stage emphysema and certain types of muscular dystrophy, compensatory mechanisms will be unable to reverse this acidotic condition. As metabolic bicarbonate production becomes exhausted, and extraneous bicarbonate infusion can no longer reverse the extreme buildup of carbon dioxide associated with uncompensated respiratory acidosis, mechanical ventilation will usually be applied.

===Fetal respiratory acidemia===
In the fetus, the normal range differs based on which umbilical vessel is sampled (umbilical vein pH is normally 7.25 to 7.45; umbilical artery pH is normally 7.20 to 7.38). In the fetus, the lungs are not used for ventilation. Instead, the placenta performs ventilatory functions (gas exchange). Fetal respiratory acidemia is defined as an umbilical vessel pH of less than 7.20 and an umbilical artery PCO2 of 66 or higher or umbilical vein PCO2 of 50 or higher.

<text>Alkalosis is the result of a process reducing hydrogen ion concentration of arterial blood plasma (alkalemia). In contrast to acidemia (serum pH 7.35 or lower), alkalemia occurs when the serum pH is higher than normal (7.45 or higher). Alkalosis is usually divided into the categories of respiratory alkalosis and metabolic alkalosis or a combined respiratory/metabolic alkalosis.

==Signs and symptoms==
Metabolic alkalosis is usually accompanied by low blood potassium concentration, causing, e.g., muscular weakness, muscle pain, and muscle cramps (from disturbed function of the skeletal muscles), and muscle spasms (from disturbed function of smooth muscles).

It may also cause low blood calcium concentration. As the blood pH increases, blood transport proteins, such as albumin, become more ionized into anions. This causes the free calcium present in blood to bind more strongly with albumin. If severe, it may cause tetany.

==Causes==
Respiratory alkalosis is caused by hyperventilation, resulting in a loss of carbon dioxide. Compensatory mechanisms for this include release of hydrogen ion from tissue buffers and excretion of bicarbonate in the kidneys, both of which lower blood pH. Hyperventilation-induced alkalosis can be seen in several deadly central nervous system diseases such as strokes or Rett syndrome.

In McArdle disease (glycogen storage disease type V), the inability to utilize muscle glycogen leads to a shortage of ATP during exercise and subsequent exercise-induced premature muscle fatigue, muscle cramps, muscle pain (myalgia), inappropriate rapid heart rate response to exercise (tachycardia), rapid depletion of phosphocreatine, insufficient ATP production, increased ADP and AMP, increased rise in venous ammonia (from the purine nucleotide cycle), increased epinephrine (adrenaline), increased plasma free fatty acids (lipolysis), increased venous pH (alkalosis), rapid (tachypnea) and commonly (approx. 50%) also heavy breathing (hyperpnea), that is exercise hyperventilation. During exercise, due to the inability to utilize muscle glycogen as a substrate for ATP synthesis, plasma lactate does not significantly rise (and may fall below) compared to resting levels; consequently, McArdle disease individuals do not experience lactic acidosis. The rise in venous pH (alkalosis), may be due to increased ammonia production, increased epinephrine, and/or increased oxygen demand for oxidative phosphorylation of blood borne substrates (free fatty acids and blood glucose).

Metabolic alkalosis can be caused by repeated vomiting, resulting in a loss of hydrochloric acid in the stomach contents. Severe dehydration, and the consumption of alkali, are other causes. It can also be caused by administration of diuretics and endocrine disorders such as Cushing&#x27;s syndrome. Compensatory mechanism for metabolic alkalosis involve slowed breathing by the lungs to increase serum carbon dioxide, a condition leaning toward respiratory acidosis. As respiratory acidosis often accompanies the compensation for metabolic alkalosis, and vice versa, a delicate balance is created between these two conditions.

<doc id="491593" wikidata="Q863569" url="?curid=491593" title="Zero-width non-joiner">
<text>The zero-width non-joiner (ZWNJ, ; rendered: ; HTML entity: or ) is a non-printing character used in the computerization of writing systems that make use of ligatures. For example, in writing systems that feature initial, medial and final letter-forms, such as the Persian alphabet, when a ZWNJ is placed between two characters that would otherwise be joined into a ligature, it instead prevents the ligature and causes them to be printed in their final and initial forms, respectively. This is also an effect of a space character, but a ZWNJ is used when it is desirable to keep the characters closer together or to connect a word with its morpheme.

The ZWNJ is encoded in Unicode as .

== Use of ZWNJ for correct typography ==
In certain languages, the ZWNJ is necessary for unambiguously specifying the correct typographic form of a character sequence.
The picture shows how the code looks when it is &quot;rendered&quot; correctly, and in every row the correct and incorrect pictures should be different. On a system which not configured to display the Unicode correctly, the correct display and the incorrect one may look the same, or either of them may be significantly different from the corresponding picture.

In this Biblical Hebrew example, the placement of the to the left of the is correct, which has a sign written as two vertical dots to denote short vowel. If a were placed to the left of , it would be erroneous. In Modern Hebrew, there is no reason to use the for spoken language, so it is rarely used in Modern Hebrew typesetting.

In German typography, ligatures may not cross the constituent boundaries within compounds. Thus, in the first German example, the prefix is separated from the rest of the word to prohibit the ligature &quot;fl&quot;. Similarly, in English, some argue ligatures should not cross morpheme boundaries. For example, in some words &quot;fly&quot; and &quot;fish&quot; are morphemes but in others they&#x27;re not; therefore, by their reasoning, words like &#x27; and &#x27; (here shown with the non-joiner) should not have ligatures (respectively of fl and fi) while &quot;dayfly&quot; and &quot;catfish&quot; should have them.

Persian uses this character extensively for certain prefixes, suffixes and compound words. It is necessary for disambiguating compounds from non-compound words, which use a full space.

In the Jawi script of Malay, ZWNJ is used whenever more than one consonants are written at the end of any phrase (, Malay for &#x27;science&#x27; or in Latin script, pronounced /ˈsa.ɪns/.) It is used to signify that there are no vowels (specifically &#x27;a&#x27; or &#x27;ə&#x27;) in between the two consonant letters as would otherwise be pronounced either /ˈsa.ɪnas/ or /ˈsa.ɪnəs/. A space would separate the phrase into different words, where phrases such as would now mean &#x27;to sign the Arabic letter sin&#x27; ( in Latin script.)

== Use of ZWNJ to display alternative forms ==

In Indic scripts, insertion of a ZWNJ after a consonant either with a halant or before a dependent vowel prevents the characters from being joined properly:

In Devanagari, the characters and typically combine to form , but when a ZWNJ is inserted between them, (code: codice_1) is seen instead.

In Kannada, the characters ನ್ and ನ combine to form ನ್ನ, but when a ZWNJ is inserted between them, ನ್‌ನ is displayed. That style is typically used to write foreign words in Kannada script: &quot;Facebook&quot; is written as ಫೇಸ್‌ಬುಕ್, though it can be written as ಫೇಸ್ಬುಕ್. ರಾಜ್‌ಕುಮಾರ್ and ರಾಮ್‌ಗೊಪಾಲ್ are examples of other proper nouns that need ZWNJ.

To insert a ZWNJ in Kannada, use Shift-V on Linux (iBus, InScript). On Windows (InScript), you can produce a ZWNJ with Ctrl+Shift+2 or Alt+0157. For the LipikaIME on Mac, the caret returns a ZWNJ.

In Bengali, when the Bengali letter য occurs at the end of a consonant cluster—i.e., য preceded by a ◌্ (&quot;hôsôntô&quot;)—it appears in a special shape, , known as the য-ফলা (&quot;ja-phala&quot;), such as in ক্য (ক ্ য). Thus, when we want to write উদ্‌যাপন (correct Bengali spelling for celebration), it becomes উদ্যাপন (which is incorrect). Here ZWNJ works. If we want to write উদ্‌যাপন, we have to write in the following sequence (code: codice_2&amp;zwnj;codice_3), then we will get the proper rendering and the correct spelling. In Bengali, the &quot;hôsôntô&quot; is used for making any conjuncts and falas (such as ra-fala, ba-fala etc)&quot;.&quot; Where the &quot;hôsôntô&quot; needs to be displayed explicitly, it is required to insert ZWNJ after the &quot;hôsôntô&quot;.

Also in Bengali, when the Bengali letter র occurs at the beginning of a consonant cluster—i.e., র succeeded by a hôsôntô—it appears in a special shape, known as the রেফ (reph). Thus, the sequence র ্ য is rendered by default as র্য. When the য-ফলা shape needs to be retained rather than the রেফ shape, the ZWJ is inserted right after র, i.e., র&amp;zwj;্য to render র‍্য. র‍্য is commonly used for loanwords from English such as র‍্যাম (RAM), র‍্যান্ডম (random) etc.

== Symbol ==

The symbol to be used on keyboards which enable the input of the ZWNJ directly is standardized in Amendment 1 (2012) of ISO/IEC 9995-7:2009 &quot;Information technology – Keyboard layouts for text and office systems – Symbols used to represent functions&quot; as symbol number 81, and in IEC 60417 &quot;Graphical Symbols for use on Equipment&quot; as symbol no. IEC 60417-6177-2.

<doc id="491605" wikidata="Q125555724" url="?curid=491605" title="Temple Bar, London">
<text>Temple Bar was the principal ceremonial entrance to the City of London from the City of Westminster. In the Middle Ages, London expanded city jurisdiction beyond its walls to gates, called &#x27;bars&#x27;, which were erected across thoroughfares. To the west of the City of London, the bar was located adjacent to the area known as the Temple. Temple Bar was situated on the historic royal ceremonial route from the Palace of the Tower of London to the old Palace of Westminster, the two chief residences of the medieval English monarchs, and from Westminster to St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. The road east of the bar within the city was Fleet Street, while the road to the west, in Westminster, was The Strand.

At the bar, the Corporation of the City of London erected a barrier to regulate trade into the city. The 19th century Royal Courts of Justice are located to its north, having been moved from Westminster Hall. To its south is Temple Church, along with the Inner Temple and Middle Temple Inns of Court. As the most important entrance to the City of London from Westminster, it was formerly long the custom for the monarch to halt at the Temple Bar before entering the City of London, in order for the Lord Mayor to offer the corporation&#x27;s pearl-encrusted Sword of State as a token of loyalty.

&#x27;Temple Bar&#x27; strictly refers to a notional bar or barrier across the route near The Temple precinct, but it is also used to refer to the 17th-century ornamental, English Baroque arched gateway building attributed to Christopher Wren, which spanned the roadway at the bar for two centuries. After Wren&#x27;s gateway was removed in 1878, the Temple Bar Memorial topped by a dragon symbol of London, and containing statues of Queen Victoria and Edward VII, was erected to mark the location. Wren&#x27;s archway was preserved and was re-erected in 2004 within the City of London, in a redeveloped Paternoster Square next to St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. In September 2022, the preserved Wren gateway and an adjacent building were officially opened by the Duke of Gloucester as the home of the Worshipful Company of Chartered Architects.

==Background==
In the Middle Ages, the authority of the City of London Corporation reached beyond the city&#x27;s ancient defensive walls in several places, known as the Liberties of London. To regulate trade into the city, barriers were erected on the major entrance routes wherever the true boundary was a substantial distance from the nearest ancient gatehouse in the walls. Temple Bar was the most used of these, since traffic between the City of London (England&#x27;s prime commercial centre) and the Palace of Westminster (the political centre) passed through it. It was located where Fleet Street now meets The Strand, which is outside London&#x27;s old boundary wall.

Its name derives from the Temple Church, adjoining to the south, which has given its name to a wider area south of Fleet Street, the Temple, once belonging to the Knights Templar but now home to two of the legal profession&#x27;s Inns of Court, and within the city&#x27;s ancient boundaries.

The historic ceremony of the monarch halting at Temple Bar and being met by the Lord Mayor has often featured in art and literature. It is commented on in televised coverage of modern-day royal ceremonial processions.

==History==
===City jurisdiction and The Temple===
A City bar at The Temple is first mentioned in 1293 and was probably only a chain or bar between a row of posts. More substantial structures with arches followed. After the Battle of Evesham of 1265, Prince Edward punished the rebellious Londoners, who had befriended Simon de Montfort, by taking away all their street chains and bars, and storing them in the Tower of London. By 1351, a timber archway had been built housing a small prison above it. The earliest known documentary and historical notice of Temple Bar is in 1327, concerning a hearing before the mayor regarding a right of way in the area. In 1384, Richard II granted a licence for paving the Strand Street from Temple Bar to the Savoy, and collecting tolls to cover the expense.

On 5 November 1422, the corpse of Henry V was borne to Westminster Abbey by the chief citizens and nobles, and every doorway from Southwark to Temple Bar had a torch-bearer. In 1503 the hearse of Elizabeth of York, queen of Henry VII, halted at Temple Bar, on its way from the Tower to Westminster, and at the Bar the Abbots of Westminster and Bermondsey blessed the corpse, and the Earl of Derby and a large company of nobles joined the funeral procession. Anne Boleyn passed through the Bar on 31 May 1534, the day before her coronation, on her way to the Tower. On that occasion Temple Bar was new painted and repaired, and near it stood singing men and children—the Fleet Street conduit all the time running claret.

In 1554, Thomas Wyatt led an uprising in opposition to Queen Mary I&#x27;s proposed marriage to Philip II of Spain. When he had fought his way down Piccadilly to The Strand, Temple Bar was thrown open to him, or forced open by him; but when he had been repulsed at Ludgate he was hemmed in by cavalry at Temple Bar, where he surrendered. This revolt persuaded the government to go through with the execution of Lady Jane Grey.

The notable Scottish bookseller Andrew Millar owned his first London shop at Temple Bar, taken over from the ownership of James McEuen in 1728, to whom Millar had been apprenticed.

===Wren&#x27;s Temple Bar Gate===

Although the then existing Bar Gate at the Temple escaped damage by the Great Fire of London of 1666, it was decided to rebuild it as part of the general improvement works made throughout the city after that devastating event. Commissioned by King Charles II, and attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, the fine arch of Portland stone was constructed between 1669 and 1672, by Thomas Knight, the City Mason, and Joshua Marshall, Master of the Mason&#x27;s Company and King&#x27;s Master Mason, while John Bushnell carved the statues.

Rusticated, it is a two-story structure consisting of one wide central arch for the road traffic, flanked on both sides by narrower arches for pedestrians. On the upper part, four statues celebrate the 1660 Restoration of the Stuart monarchy: in its original setting, on the west side King Charles II is shown with his father King Charles I whose parents King James I and Anne of Denmark are depicted on the east side.
During the 18th century the heads of convicted traitors were frequently mounted on pikes and exhibited on the roof, as was the case on London Bridge. The other seven principal gateways to London, (Ludgate, Newgate, Aldersgate, Cripplegate, Moorgate, Bishopsgate and Aldgate) were all demolished in the 1760s, but Temple Bar remained despite its impediment to the ever-growing traffic. The upper-storey room was leased to the neighbouring banking house of Child &amp; Co for storage of records.

In the 1853 novel, &quot;Bleak House&quot;, Charles Dickens described it as &quot;that leaden-headed old obstruction, appropriate ornament for the threshold of a leaden-headed old corporation&quot; (the City of London corporation). It was also the subject of jokes, &quot;Why is Temple Bar like a lady&#x27;s veil? Both must be raised (razed) for &quot;busses&quot; (&#x27;buses). It was noted in jest &quot;as a weak spot in our defences&quot;, since one could walk through the adjoining barbershop where one door opened on to the city and the other in the area of Westminster.

In 1874 it was discovered that the keystones had dropped and the arches were propped up with timbers. The steady increase in horse and cart traffic led to complaints that Temple Bar was becoming a bottleneck, holding back the City trade. In 1878 the City of London Corporation, eager to widen the road but unwilling to destroy so historic a monument, dismantled it piece-by-piece over an 11-day period and stored its 2,700 stones carefully. In 1880 the brewer Henry Meux, at the instigation of his wife Valerie Susan Meux, bought the stones and re-erected the arch as the facade of a new gatehouse in the park of his mansion house Theobalds Park in Hertfordshire, the site of a former substantial prodigy house of James VI and I. There it remained, positioned in a woodland clearing, until 2003. A plaque now marks the Hertfordshire site.

===The Gate&#x27;s present location===
In March 1938 Theobalds Park was sold by Sir Hedworth Meux to Middlesex County Council, but Wren&#x27;s Temple Bar Gatehouse was excluded from the sale and retained by the Meux trustees in the park. In 1984 it was bought by the Temple Bar Trust from the Meux Trust for the sum of £1. In December 2001 the city&#x27;s Court of Common Council resolved to contribute funds for the return of Temple Bar Gate to the city. On 13 October 2003 the first stone was dismantled at Theobalds Park and all were placed on 500 pallets for storage. In 2004 it was returned to the City of London where it was painstakingly re-erected as an entrance to the Paternoster Square redevelopment immediately north of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, opening to the public on 10 November 2004. The total cost of the project was over £3 million, funded mainly by the City of London, with donations from the Temple Bar Trust and several City Livery Companies.

In September 2022, Temple Bar London, consisting of the gateway and an adjacent building (Paternoster Lodge), was officially reopened by the Duke of Gloucester and the Lord Mayor of London Vincent Keaveny as the home of a livery company, the Worshipful Company of Chartered Architects, providing space for meetings and dining and an education centre funded by the Corporation of London&#x27;s CIL Neighbourhood fund.

The top of one of the gates was offered for sale by Dreweatts Auctioneers in a London sale of surplus stock from LASSCO on 15 June 2013.

===Temple Bar Memorial===
Following the removal of Wren&#x27;s gate, Horace Jones, Architect and Surveyor to the City of London, designed a memorial to mark Temple Bar, which was unveiled in 1880. The Temple Bar Memorial stands in the street in front of the Royal Courts of Justice.

The elaborate pedestal in a neo-Renaissance style serves as the base for a sculpture by Charles Bell Birch of a dragon supporter (sometimes erroneously referred to as a griffin) bearing a shield of the arms of the City of London. The pedestal is decorated with statues by Joseph Boehm of Queen Victoria and her son the then Prince of Wales, the last royals to have entered the City through Wren&#x27;s gate, which event is depicted in one of the reliefs which also decorate the structure.

In the 1960s, similar but smaller and more subdued dragon sculptures were set at other entry points to the city. Two were originally created in 1849 by J. B. Bunning for the entrance to the Coal Exchange (and were relocated to Victoria Embankment following that building&#x27;s demolition in 1962), while the others are smaller-scale versions of Bunning&#x27;s design.

==In fiction==

Charles Dickens mentioned Temple Bar in &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; (Book II, Chapter I), noting its proximity to the fictional Tellson&#x27;s Bank on Fleet Street. This was in fact Child &amp; Co., which used the upper rooms of Temple Bar as storage space. Whilst critiquing the moral poverty of late 18th-century London, Dickens wrote that in matters of crime and punishment, &quot;putting to death was a recipe much in vogue&quot;, and illustrated the horror caused by severed heads &quot;exposed on Temple Bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity&quot;.

In Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;The Paradise of Bachelors and the Tartarus of Maids&quot;, he contrasts the beauty of the Temple Bar gateway at the highest point on the road leading to the hellish paper factory, which he calls a &quot;Dantean Gateway&quot; (in his &quot;Inferno&quot;, Dante describes the gateway to Hell, over which are written the words, &quot;Abandon all hope, ye who enter here&quot;).

The dragon on top of the Temple Bar monument comes to life in Charlie Fletcher&#x27;s children&#x27;s book about London, &quot;Stoneheart&quot;.

The dragon also features in Virginia Woolf&#x27;s &quot;The Years&quot;, in which one of the main characters, Martin, points &quot;at the splayed-out figure at Temple Bar; it looked as ridiculous as usual – something between a serpent and a fowl.&quot;

<doc id="491611" wikidata="Q2279426" url="?curid=491611" title="Jean Charles Dominique de Lacretelle">
<text>Jean Charles Dominique de Lacretelle, (3 September 1766 – 26 March 1855), was a French historian and journalist.

Called Lacretelle le jeune to distinguish him from his elder brother, Pierre Louis de Lacretelle. He was born at Metz. He was called to Paris by his brother in 1787, and during the French Revolution belonged, like Pierre, to the party of the Feuillants. He was for some time secretary to the duc de la Rochefoucauld-Liancourt, the famous philanthropist, and afterwards joined the staff of the &quot;Journal de Paris&quot;, then managed by Suard, and where he had as colleagues André Chénier and Jean-Antoine Roucher. He made no attempt to hide his monarchist sympathies, and these, together with the way in which he reported the trial and death of King Louis XVI of France, put him in danger of his life; to avoid this danger he enlisted in the army, but after Thermidor he returned to Paris and to his newspaper work.

He was involved in the royalist movement of the 13th Vendmiaire, and condemned to deportation after the 18th Fructidor; but, thanks to powerful influence, he was left forgotten in prison till after the 18th Brumaire, when he was set at liberty by Joseph Fouché. Under the Empire he was appointed a professor of history in the Faculté des lettres of Paris (1809), and elected as a member of the Académie française (1811). In 1827 he was prime mover in the protest made by the Académie française against the minister Peyronnet&#x27;s law on the press, which led to the failure of that measure, but this step cost him, as it did Abel-François Villemain, his post as &quot;censeur&quot; royal.

Under Louis Philippe Lacretelle devoted himself entirely to his teaching and literary work. In 1848 he retired to Mâcon; but there, as in Paris, he was the centre of a brilliant circle, for he was a wonderful &quot;causeur&quot;, and an equally good listener, and had many interesting experiences to recall. His son Pierre Henri (1815-1899) was a humorous writer and politician of purely contemporary interest.

== Works ==

JC Lacretelle&#x27;s chief work is a series of histories of the 18th century, the Revolution and its sequel:
*&quot;Précis historique de la Revolution française&quot;, appended to the history of Rabaud St Etienne, and partly written in the prison of La Force (5 vols., 1801-1806)
*&quot;Histoire de France pendant le XVIIIe siècle&quot; (6 vols., 1808)
*&quot;Histoire de l&#x27;Assemblée Constituante&quot; (2 vols., 1821)
*&quot;L&#x27;Assemblée Legislative&quot; (1822)
*&quot;La Convention Nationale&quot; (3 vols., 1824-1825)
*&quot;Histoire de France depuis la restauration&quot; (1829-1835)
*&quot;Histoire du consulat et de l&#x27;empire&quot; (4 vols., 1846)
The author was a moderate and fair-minded man, but possessed neither great powers of style, nor striking historical insight, nor the special historian&#x27;s power of writing minute accuracy of detail with breadth of view. Carlyle&#x27;s sarcastic remark on Lacretelle&#x27;s history of the Revolution, that it exists, but does not profit much, is partly true of all his books. He had been an eye-witness of and an actor in the events which he describes, but his testimony must be accepted with caution.

<text>The Tank, Infantry, Mk III, Valentine was an infantry tank produced in the United Kingdom during World War II. More than 8,000 Valentines were produced in eleven marks, plus specialised variants, accounting for about a quarter of wartime British tank production. The variants included riveted and welded construction, petrol and diesel engines and increases in armament. It was supplied in large numbers to the USSR and built under licence in Canada. It was used by the British in the North African campaign. Developed by Vickers, it proved to be strong and reliable.

==Name==
There are several proposed explanations for the name &quot;Valentine&quot;. According to the most popular one, the design was presented to the War Office on St Valentine&#x27;s Day, 14 February 1940, although some sources say that the design was submitted on Valentine&#x27;s Day 1938 or 10 February 1938. White notes that &quot;incidentally&quot; Valentine was the middle name of Sir John Carden, the man responsible for many tank designs including that of the Valentine&#x27;s predecessors, the A10 and A11. Another version says that Valentine is an acronym for Vickers-Armstrongs Limited Elswick &amp; (Newcastle-upon) Tyne. The &quot;most prosaic&quot; explanation according to author David Fletcher is that it was just an in-house codeword of Vickers with no other significance.

==Development==
The Valentine started as a proposal based on Vickers&#x27; experience with the A9 and A10 specification cruiser tanks and the A11 (Infantry Tank Mk I). As a private design by Vickers-Armstrongs, it did not receive a General Staff &quot;A&quot; designation; it was submitted to the War Office on 10 February 1938. The development team tried to match the lower weight of a cruiser tank, allowing the suspension and transmission parts of the A10 heavy cruiser to be used, with the greater armour of an infantry tank, working to a specification for a armour basis (the same as the A.11).

The tank was to carry a 2-pounder gun in a two-man turret (the A.11 was armed only with a heavy machine gun), a lower silhouette and be as light as possible, resulting in a very compact vehicle with a cramped interior. Compared to the earlier Infantry Tank Mk II &quot;Matilda&quot;, the Valentine had somewhat weaker armour and almost the same top speed. By using components already proven on the A9 and A10, the new design was easier to produce and much less expensive.

The War Office was initially deterred by the size of the turret, since they considered a turret crew of three necessary, to free the vehicle commander from direct involvement in operating the gun. Concerned by the situation in Europe, it finally approved the design in April 1939 and placed the first order in July for deliveries in May 1940. At the start of the war, Vickers were instructed to give priority to the production of tanks. The vehicle reached trials in May 1940, which coincided with the loss of much of the army&#x27;s equipment in France, during Operation Dynamo, the evacuation from Dunkirk. The trials were successful and the vehicle was rushed into production as &quot;Tank, Infantry, Mark III&quot;; no pilot models were required as much of the mechanics had been proven on the A10, and 109 had been built by the end of September. During late 1940 and early 1941, Valentines were used in the cruiser tank role in British-based armoured divisions, and they were supplied to tank brigades of the Eighth Army in North Africa from June 1941.

==Production==
Metropolitan-Cammell Carriage &amp; Wagon—an associate company of Vickers—and Birmingham Railway Carriage &amp; Wagon Company (BRCW) were contracted to produce the Valentine. Metropolitan and the BRCW had built small numbers of the A10, their production runs were just finishing and they delivered their first Valentines in mid-1940. Metropolitan used two sites, with Wednesbury joined by their Midland site in production of the Valentine. Vickers output started at ten per month rising to 45 per month in a year and peaking at 20 per week in 1943, before production was slowed and then production of the Valentine and derivatives stopped in 1945. Vickers-Armstrong produced 2,515 vehicles and Metropolitan 2,135; total UK production was 6,855 tanks, with 2,394 exported from Britain to the Soviet Union under lend-lease.

To develop its own tank forces, Canada had established tank production facilities. An order was placed in 1940 with Canadian Pacific and after modifications to the Valentine design to use local standards and materials, the production prototype was finished in 1941. Canadian production was mainly at CPR Angus Shops in Montreal and 1,420 were produced in Canada, of which 1,388 were sent to the Soviet-Union. They formed the main Commonwealth export to the Soviet Union under lend-lease. The remaining 32 were retained for training. The use of local GMC Detroit Diesel two-stroke engines in Canadian production was a success and the engine was adopted for British production. British and Canadian production totalled 8,275, making the Valentine the most produced British tank design of the war.

==Vehicle layout==

The Valentine was of conventional layout, divided internally into three compartments; from front to back the driver&#x27;s position, the fighting compartment with the turret and then the engine and transmission driving the tracks through rear sprockets. The driver&#x27;s area contained only the driver and the driving controls. The driver sat on hull centre line, entering through either of two angled hatches over the seat, though there was an emergency exit hatch beneath his seat. The driver had a direct vision port—cut in what was one of the hull cross members—in front of him and two periscopes in the roof over his head. Driving was by clutch and brake steering through levers, whose control rods ran the length of the hull to the transmission at the rear.

Behind the driver was a bulkhead that formed another hull cross-member and separated him from the fighting compartment. The first tanks had a two-man turret, the gunner on the left of the gun and the commander acting also as the loader on the right. When three-man turrets were introduced, the commander sat to the rear of the turret. The turret was made up of a cast front and a cast rear riveted to the side plates which were of rolled steel. All tanks carried the radio in the turret rear. Early tanks used the Wireless set No. 11 with a Tannoy for the crew; later tanks had Wireless Set No. 19, which included crew communications with long and short range networks.
Turret rotation was by electric motor controlled by the gunner, with a hand-wheel for manual backup. The restrictions that the two-man turret placed on the commander, made more so if they were a troop commander and responsible for directing the actions of two other tanks besides their own, were addressed by enlarging the turret for the Mark III so that a loader for the main armament could be carried. The turret ring diameter was not changed, so the extra space was found by moving the gun mounting forward in an extended front plate and increasing the bulge in the rear of the turret. This increased weight by half a ton on the two-man turret.

A bulkhead separated the fighting compartment from the engine compartment. The engine, clutch and gearbox were bolted together to form a single unit. The first Valentines used a petrol engine and the diesel engine which distinguished the Mark II—at the time Tank Infantry Mark III*— from the Mark I, was based on the AEC Comet, a commercial road vehicle engine. The Mark IV used a GMC Detroit Diesel; these were the majority of those used in the desert campaigns. The gearbox was a 5-speed, 1-reverse Meadows connected to the multiplate steering clutches which then fed epicyclic reduction gearboxes on the sides of the tanks. The brakes themselves were on the outside of the drive sprockets. The suspension was made up of two units on either side; each unit made up of a single diameter wheel and two wheels. Improved tracks were added to later marks.

== Combat history ==
===North Africa===

The Valentine was extensively used in the North African Campaign, earning a reputation as a reliable and well-protected vehicle. The first Valentines went into action in December 1941 with the 8th Royal Tank Regiment in Operation Crusader. The tank first served in Operation Crusader in the North African desert, when it began to replace the Matilda Tank. Due to a lack of cruisers, it was issued to armoured regiments in the UK from mid-1941. The Valentine was better armed and faster than the Cruiser Mk II. During the pursuit from El Alamein in late 1942, some tanks had driven more than by the time the Eighth Army reached Tunisia.
The Valentine shared the common weakness of the British tanks of the period in that its 2-pounder gun lacked high-explosive (anti-personnel) ammunition and soon became outdated as an anti-tank weapon. Introduction of the 6-pounder in British service was delayed until the loss of equipment in France had been made good, so the 2-pounder was retained longer.

The small size of the turret and of the turret ring meant that producing mountings for larger guns proved a difficult task. Although versions with the 6-pounder and then with the Ordnance QF 75 mm gun were developed, by the time they were available in significant numbers, better tanks had reached the battlefield. Another weakness was the small crew compartment and the two-man turret. A larger turret, with a loader position added, was used in some of the 2-pounder versions but the position had to be removed again in variants with larger guns. Its relatively low height was an advantage in a battlefield with little cover, allowing it to take up a &quot;good hull-down position in any convenient fold in the ground&quot;.

===Madagascar===
Six Valentines of &#x27;B&#x27; Special Service Squadron of the Royal Armoured Corps took part in the 1942 Battle of Madagascar with six Tetrarchs of &#x27;C&#x27; Special Service Squadron.

===Northwest Europe===
By 1944, the Valentine had been almost replaced in front-line units of the European theatre by the Churchill tank (the Infantry Tank Mark IV) and the US-made M4 Sherman tank. A few were used for special purposes or as command vehicles for units equipped with the Archer self-propelled gun. The Royal Artillery used the Valentine XI (with 75 mm gun) as an OP command tank until the end of the war.

===Pacific===
In the Pacific War, 25 Valentine Mk III and nine Valentine Mk IIICS tanks were employed by the 3rd New Zealand Division in the Solomon Islands campaign. Trials in New Zealand had found that the locally developed 2 pounder HE shell lacked power, especially compared to the 18-pounder shell of the 3-inch howitzer, so 18 Valentine Mk III were converted to Valentine Mk IIICS standard by having their main armament replaced by the QF 3-inch howitzer taken from Matilda Mk IVCS tanks, surplus to New Zealand requirements. Other modifications to the nine Valentine Mk IIICS tanks deploying to the Pacific included Infantry telephones (a means for infantry to talk to the tank commander). The converted tanks carried 21 HE and 14 smoke shells. The other nine 3-inch armed tanks and 16 normal Valentines (with 2-pounder guns) remained in New Zealand for training. The Valentine was retired from New Zealand service in 1960.

===Eastern Front===
Valentines, of all Marks except the Mark I, were sent to the USSR from 1941. The creation of Valentines tanks destined for use by the Soviet Union was a part of a campaign known as Aid to Russia Fund, headed by Clementine Churchill and heavily supported by the Communist Party of Great Britain. In Soviet service, the Valentine was used from the Battle of Moscow until the end of the war, mainly in the second line. Although criticised for its low speed and the 2-pounder gun, the Valentine was liked due to its small size, reliability and good armour protection. Initially the tracks gave some problems in winter; from freezing down to minus 20, snow packed into the tracks, though at below minus 20 it was not a problem. The problem was later solved.
Soviet Supreme Command asked for its production until the end of the war. In August 1945, as part of the Soviet invasion of Manchuria, the 267th Tank Regiment (40 Valentine III and IX) of the 59th Cavalry Division Red Army, together with the 65th T-34-85 43rd Tank Brigade, passed from Eastern Gobi across the mountains Greater Khingan to Kalgan in China.

===Cyprus===
The last use of a Valentine in combat is thought to have occurred during the Cyprus crisis of 1963–64. A turretless Valentine from a quarry was used by Greek militia, fitted with an improvised armoured casemate from which a gunner could fire a Bren gun. The vehicle is owned by the Cypriot National Guard, who intend to place it in a proposed new military museum.

==Variants==

Valentine I (Tank, Infantry, Mk III): (308)
: The first model of the Valentine; production was by Vickers, Metro-Cammell and Birmingham Railway The tank had a riveted hull, was powered by AEC A189 135 hp petrol engine and equipped with a 2-pounder gun and a coaxial Besa machine gun. Its two-man turret forced the commander to act as the loader.
Valentine II (Tank, Infantry, Mk III*): (700)
: Until the Valentine name adopted in June 1941, known as &quot;Tank, Infantry, Mark III*&quot;. This model used AEC A190 131 hp 6-cylinder diesel engine. To increase its range in the desert, an auxiliary jettisonable external fuel tank was installed to the left of the engine compartment.

Valentine III
: Modifications to the turret design – moving the front turret plate forward and a larger rear bulge – gave room for a loader to ease the duties of the commander. The side armour was reduced from to to save weight.
Valentine IIICS (&quot;Close Support&quot;)
: New Zealand modification of 18 Valentine III carried out by replacing the 2 pounder with a 3&quot; Howitzer from Matilda IVCS tanks. They were used in Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands (see Battle of the Green Islands), and remained in service into the 1950s.
Valentine IV
: A Mark II using an American 138 hp GMC 6004 diesel engine and US-made transmission. Though it had slightly shorter range, it was quieter and highly reliable.
Valentine V
: As the Valentine III but with the GMC 6004 diesel and US-made transmission.
Valentine VI
: Canadian-built version of Mk IV; initially known as Tank, Infantry Mark III***. It used some Canadian and American mechanical parts and a GMC diesel engine. Late production vehicles had cast glacis detail, along with more use of cast sections instead of fabricated ones. The first fifteen were produced with a 7.92 mm Besa coaxial machine-gun, thereafter replaced by a coaxial 0.30-inch Browning machine-gun.

Valentine VII
: Another Canadian version, it was essentially the VI with internal changes and No. 19 Wireless replaced the No. 11 radio set.
Valentine VIIA
: Mark VII with jettisonable fuel tanks, new studded tracks, oil cooler and protected headlights.
Valentine VIII
: AEC diesel engine and turret modification to take 6-pounder gun; meant the loss of the coaxial machine-gun. Never built due to being inferior to Mk IX.
Valentine IX
: A V upgraded to the 6-pounder gun as VIII. Similar armour reduction as on the Mk VIII; on late production units an upgraded, 165 hp version of the GMC 6004 diesel was installed, somewhat improving mobility.

Valentine X(135)
: New turret design so that a Besa coaxial machine-gun could be mounted again. Welded construction; the 165 hp engine was used in place of the 130 hp engine in some production.
Valentine XI
:An X upgraded with the OQF 75 mm gun and 210 hp version of the GMC 6004 diesel; welded construction. The Canadian cast nose introduced into British production, only used as a command tank.

Valentine DD
: Valentine Mk V, IX and Mk XI, made amphibious by the use of Nicholas Straussler&#x27;s &quot;Duplex Drive&quot;. Conversions by Metro-Cammell of 625 tanks delivered in 1943–1944. Used by crews training for the M4 Sherman DD tanks for the Normandy Landings as well as training in Italy and India. A few were used in Italy in 1945.
Valentine OP / Command
: Artillery Observation Post and Command Vehicle; extra radios, to give more space inside, the gun was removed and a dummy barrel fitted to the front of the turret. Used by battery commanders and observation post for Archer units.
Valentine CDL
: Continuation of Canal Defence Light experiments; conventional turret replaced with one containing a searchlight.
Valentine Scorpion II
: Mine flail; turretless vehicle with flail attachment never used operationally.
Valentine AMRA Mk Ib
: Armoured Mine Roller Attachment, a few used on the beaches of Normandy during D-Day.
Valentine Snake
: Mine exploder; using &quot;Snake&quot; mine-clearing line charge equipment; a few used operationally.
Valentine Bridgelayer
: Armoured bridgelaying vehicle; a turretless Mk II fitted with long by wide Class 30 (capable of bearing ) scissors bridge. 192 were produced, 25 of them supplied to the USSR. Used in action in Italy, Burma, north-west Europe and Manchuria.
Valentine with 6-pounder anti-tank mounting
: Experimental vehicle built by Vickers-Armstrong to examine the possibility of producing a simple tank destroyer by mounting the 6-pounder in its field carriage on the hull in place of the turret. Trials only, 1942 not required since the Valentine could be fitted with a 6-pounder in a turret.
Valentine flame-throwers
: Two Valentine tanks were modified to carry flame-throwers and were tested by the Petroleum Warfare Department to determine which system was best for a tank-mounted flame projector. One used a projector pressurised by slow burning cordite charges (designed by the Ministry of Supply) and one designed by AEC with the PWD using a projector operated by compressed hydrogen gas. Both carried the flame-thrower fuel in a trailer and the flame projector was mounted on the hull front. Trials started in 1942 and showed that the gas-operated system was better. From this test installation was developed the Crocodile equipment for the Churchill Crocodile flame-thrower used in the North West Europe campaign in 1944–45.
Valentine 9.75-inch flame mortar
: Experimental vehicle with the turret replaced by fixed heavy mortar intended to fire 25 lb TNT incendiary shells to demolish concrete emplacements. Trials only by the Petroleum Warfare Dept, 1943–45. Effective range was (maximum range ). Few used in Normandy on D-Day to help clear buildings.
Burmark
: &quot;Ark&quot; design using Valentine hull for a light ramp tank to be used in Far East. The end of the war precluded further development.
Gap Jumping Tank
: Experiments with rockets late in the war to propel a Valentine tank across an obstacle such as a minefield.

==Surviving tanks==

Around forty Valentine tanks and vehicles based on the Valentine chassis survive. Tanks in running condition are at the Bovington Tank Museum (Mark IX) and in private hands in New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The Bovington collection has a Mark II and a Valentine Scissors Bridgelayer. Other examples are displayed at the Imperial War Museum Duxford in the UK; the Royal Military Museum in Brussels, Belgium; the Musée des Blindés, Saumur, France and the Kubinka Tank Museum, Russia; the South African National Museum of Military History. In the United States, the Military Vehicle Technology Foundation and the Virginia Museum of Military Vehicles own Valentines.

The Cavalry Tank Museum Ahmednagar, India have a Valentine Tank and a Valentine Bridgelayer.

A number of Valentine hulls are in private ownership in Australia, including one in the Australian Armour and Artillery Museum. These were sent there after the war for use as agricultural vehicles.

Two Canadian-built Valentines survive. Valentine Tank Mk VIIA, no. 838, built May 1943, was a Lend-Lease tank shipped to the Soviet Union. It fell through the ice of a boggy river near Telepyne, Ukraine (Russian: Telepino), during a Soviet counter-offensive on 25 January 1944. In 1990 a 74-year-old villager helped locate the tank and it was recovered and offered as a Glasnost-era gift to Canada. It was presented to the Canadian War Museum by independent Ukraine in 1992 and stands on display in the LeBreton Gallery. A Valentine built by Canadian Pacific resides at the Base Borden Military Museum in Barrie, Ontario.

A notable survivor is the only intact DD Valentine. This has been restored to running condition and is in the United Kingdom, privately owned by John Pearson. A number of DD Valentines that sank during training lie off the British coast; several have been located and are regularly visited by recreational divers. Two Valentines lie in the Moray Firth in Scotland and two lie out of Poole Bay in Dorset. These tanks lie apart in of water. A further tank is known to lie in around of water in Bracklesham Bay, south of Chichester in West Sussex; the hull and turret are clearly recognisable as it sits on a gravel mound.

In October 2012, a Valentine Mk IX tank that fell through ice while crossing a river in western Poland during the Soviet Army&#x27;s march to Berlin was recovered. This, the only surviving Valentine Mk IX to have actually seen combat, is reportedly well preserved and could possibly be restored to operational condition.

<text>The V-boats were a group of nine United States Navy submarines built between World War I and World War II from 1921 to 1934 under authorization as the &quot;fleet boat&quot; program.

The term &quot;V-boats&quot; as used includes five separate classes of submarines: large, fast fleet submarines (&quot;V-1&quot; through &quot;V-3&quot;), large long-range submarines (the minelayer &quot;V-4&quot; and two submarine cruisers &quot;V-5&quot; and &quot;V-6&quot;) and three medium-sized submarines (&quot;V-7&quot; through &quot;V-9&quot;).

The successful fleet submarines of World War II ( through ) were descended from the last three, especially &quot;V-7&quot;, though somewhat larger with pure diesel-electric propulsion systems.

Originally called USS &quot;V-1&quot; through &quot;V-9&quot; (SS-163 through SS-171), in 1931 the nine submarines were renamed , , , , , , , , and , respectively. All served in World War II, six of them on war patrols in the central Pacific. &quot;Argonaut&quot; was lost to enemy action.

==Background==
In the early 1910s, only 12 years after inaugurated the Navy&#x27;s undersea force, naval strategists had already begun to wish for submarines that could operate in closer collaboration with the surface fleet than the Navy&#x27;s existing classes, which had been designed primarily for coastal defense. These notional &quot;fleet&quot; submarines would necessarily be larger and better armed, but primarily, they would need a surface speed of some to be able to maneuver with the 21-knot battleships around which the battle fleet was built. This was the designed speed of the and later battleships, including the standard-type battleships that were under construction and proposed in 1913.

In the summer of 1913, Electric Boat&#x27;s chief naval architect, former naval constructor Lawrence Y. Spear, proposed two preliminary fleet-boat designs for consideration in the Navy&#x27;s 1914 program. In the ensuing authorization of eight submarines, Congress specified that one should &quot;be of a seagoing type to have a surface speed of not less than twenty knots&quot;. This first fleet boat, laid down in June 1916, was named USS &quot;Schley&quot; after Spanish–American War hero Winfield Scott Schley. With a displacement of surfaced, submerged, on a length of , &quot;Schley&quot; (later &quot;AA-1&quot;, and finally &quot;T-1&quot;) was twice as large as any previous U.S. submarine. To achieve the required surface speed, two tandem diesel engines on each shaft drove twin screws, and a separate diesel generator was provided for charging batteries. Although &quot;Schley&quot; and two sisters authorized in 1915— (originally &quot;AA-2&quot;), and (originally &quot;AA-3&quot;)—all made their design speed of , insoluble torsional vibration problems with their tandem engines made them very troublesome ships, and they were decommissioned in 1922-1923 after a service life of only a few years. As the engines were clutched together, perfectly synchronizing operation of the engines was impossible.

In 1916, well before the T class debacle transpired, Congress authorized 58 coastal submarines and nine additional &quot;fleet&quot; boats. Three of the larger coastal boats eventually became competing prototypes for the long-lived, 51-member S class. The nine &quot;fleet boats&quot; became the &quot;V-boats&quot;, built between 1921 and 1934, and in fact, they were the only U.S. submarines produced in that period. Although &quot;V-4&quot;, &quot;V-5&quot;, and &quot;V-6&quot; were the largest US non-nuclear submarines ever built, only &quot;V-1&quot; through &quot;V-3&quot; were designed to reach a speed of 21 knots.

==&quot;V-1&quot; through &quot;V-3&quot;—the &quot;Barracuda&quot;s==
The first three V-boats were funded in fiscal year 1919, laid down at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in October and November 1921, and commissioned somewhat less than a year apart between 1924 and 1926. Significantly, &quot;V-1&quot;, &quot;V-2&quot;, and &quot;V-3&quot; were the only members of the class designed to satisfy the Navy&#x27;s original &quot;fleet boat&quot; requirement for high surface speed. These were large and powerfully engined submarines, displacing surfaced and submerged on a length of . The propulsion plant was divided between two separate engine rooms—forward and aft of the control room—with two main-propulsion direct-drive diesels aft, and two independent diesel generators forward. The latter were primarily for charging batteries, but to reach maximum surface speed, they could augment the mechanically coupled main-propulsion engines by driving the electric motors in parallel. This partial diesel-electric propulsion system foreshadowed the later successful all-diesel-electric submarines, although nearly 10 years of development were required before it was reliable. The three boats were partially double-hulled and fitted forward with buoyancy tanks inside a bulbous bow for better surface sea-keeping. They were armed with six 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes, four forward and two aft with 12 torpedoes, plus a 5-inch (127 mm)/51 caliber deck gun.

Unfortunately, the first three V-boats had poor operational performance. Designed for on the surface, they only made , and also failed to make their submerged design speed of . As built, they were somewhat too heavy forward, which made them poor sea boats, even after replacing the original deck guns with smaller 3-inch (76 mm)/50 caliber models to save weight in 1928. Moreover, both the main propulsion diesel engines and their original electric motors were notoriously unreliable, and full-power availability was rare. Renamed &quot;Barracuda&quot;, &quot;Bass&quot;, and &quot;Bonita&quot; in 1931, they were decommissioned in 1937, and only the imminence of World War II provided a reprieve, in preparation for which they were recommissioned in September 1940. Just before Pearl Harbor, the three boats were transferred to Coco Solo, Panama Canal Zone, and each made a number of defensive war patrols (without seeing any action) off the approaches to the Panama Canal.

All three boats were overhauled in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in late 1942 and early 1943, and converted to cargo submarines by removing both torpedo tubes and main engines, thereby leaving them solely dependent on their diesel generators for propulsion. Because this rendered the boats severely underpowered, they apparently never served operationally in their cargo-carrying role, but instead were relegated to training duties at New London until just before the end of the war in 1945. After decommissioning, &quot;Barracuda&quot; and &quot;Bonita&quot; were scrapped, and &quot;Bass&quot; was scuttled as a sonar target near Block Island, Rhode Island.

==&quot;V-4&quot;—&quot;Argonaut&quot;==
Displacing , submerged, &quot;V-4&quot;—later —was both the largest submarine the Navy ever built before the advent of nuclear power and the only U.S. submarine specifically designed as a minelayer. Her configuration, and that of the following &quot;V-5&quot; and &quot;V-6&quot;, resulted from an evolving strategic concept that increasingly emphasized the possibility of a naval war with Japan in the far western Pacific. This factor, and the implications of the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, suggested the need for long-range submarine &quot;cruisers&quot;, or &quot;strategic scouts&quot;, as well as long-range minelayers, for which long endurance, not high speed, was most important. The design was possibly influenced by the German &quot;U-cruisers&quot; of the Type U-139 and Type U-151 U-boat classes, although &quot;V-4&quot;, &quot;V-5&quot;, and &quot;V-6&quot; were all larger than these. Funded in fiscal year 1925, laid down at Portsmouth in May of that year, and commissioned in April 1928, &quot;V-4&quot; was long overall and carried four 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes forward and two mine-laying chutes and their associated mechanical handling equipment aft. Two 6-inch (152 mm)/53 caliber deck guns were equipped, the largest deck guns ever on a US submarine. Considerable engine room volume was sacrificed to achieve an internal payload of 60 specially designed Mark XI moored mines, and consequently, the main propulsion diesels were limited to a total of , yielding only on the surface.

The &quot;V-4&quot; was a significant boat in that it was the first submarine in the USN to incorporate welding in its construction. All submarines prior to &quot;V-4&quot; were of all-riveted construction. Engineers at Portsmouth Navy Yard, led by Navy welding expert James W. Owens, experimented with welding for the first time during her construction. Welding was used in non-critical areas such as the superstructure, piping brackets, and support framing. The rest of the &quot;V-4&quot;&#x27;s construction, including the pressure hull, was riveted or bolted. The rest of the V-class, to some extent, incorporated welding into their construction.

An over-large, under-powered, and one-of-a-kind submarine, &quot;Argonaut&quot; was never particularly successful, but stayed in commission all through the 1930s. Early in World War II, she was re-engined at Mare Island to increase her main propulsion output to , and additionally received two external stern torpedo tubes and two stern deck stowage tubes. Despite having never laid a mine in anger, her mine-laying gear was stripped out at this time to prepare for conversion to a troop-carrying submarine. Then, at Pearl Harbor, the conversion was completed. In that guise, and accompanied by &quot;Nautilus&quot;, she participated in the US Marine assault on Japanese-held Makin Atoll by Carlson&#x27;s Raiders in August 1942. In transferring to Brisbane, Australia, late that year, &quot;Argonaut&quot; was diverted to a war patrol near Bougainville in the northern Solomon Islands, and was lost with all hands on 10 January 1943 after attacking a heavily defended Japanese convoy.

==&quot;V-5&quot; and &quot;V-6&quot;—&quot;Narwhal&quot; and &quot;Nautilus&quot;==
In their overall appearance and dimensions, &quot;V-5&quot;, later &quot;Narwhal&quot; and &quot;V-6&quot;, later &quot;Nautilus&quot; were similar to &quot;Argonaut&quot; and constituted &quot;submarine cruiser&quot; counterparts at least partially inspired by German success with long-range submarine commerce raiders of the Type U-139 and Type U-151 U-boat classes in World War I. Endurance, sea-keeping, increased torpedo capacity, and large deck guns were emphasized at the cost of high speed; and originally, a small scouting seaplane was to be carried in a water-tight hangar abaft the conning tower. The Navy had experimented with seaplanes on submarines with a prototype hangar installation on during the mid-1920s. However, the resulting increase in scouting capability was significantly offset by several additional dangers to the host submarine, and the initiative was dropped.

The two double-hulled boats displaced on the surface and submerged on a length of . They displayed prominent &quot;surface-ship&quot; characteristics, notably high freeboard and an expansive deck structure. Each was powered by two 10-cylinder, two-stroke, MAN diesel engines (designed by the German firm that built engines that powered many German U-boats of World War I, the rights to which the U.S. Navy purchased to build domestically for their own submarines). They also had a pair of smaller diesel-powered generators for charging batteries or augmenting the main propulsion engines on the surface. On trials, the two boats achieved nearly surfaced and submerged, and their claimed endurance was at . In addition to the customary torpedo tubes—four forward and two aft with 24 torpedoes (eight external)—they (and &quot;Argonaut&quot;) carried two 6-inch (152 mm)/53 caliber deck guns, the largest ever mounted on U.S. submarines.

Funded in 1926 and commissioned in 1930, &quot;V-5&quot; and &quot;V-6&quot; emerged as too large and unwieldy for fully successful operation: slow to dive, hard to maneuver, and easy to detect. Nonetheless, as &quot;Narwhal&quot; and &quot;Nautilus&quot;, they served usefully in the 1930s, and just before World War II &quot;Nautilus&quot; was modified to carry of aviation gasoline for refueling seaplanes at sea. Early in the war, each was re-fitted with four General Motors diesels and four additional external torpedo tubes (two bow and two stern), and despite their age and inherent design flaws, they went on to compile enviable war records.

&quot;Narwhal&quot; completed 15 successful war patrols and &quot;Nautilus&quot; 14, and between them, they are credited with sinking 13 enemy ships for a total of 35,000 tons. Somewhat more serendipitously, their large size made them useful for carrying both troops and cargo on covert missions. Thus, &quot;Nautilus&quot; joined with &quot;Argonaut&quot; in transporting Carlson&#x27;s Raiders to Makin Atoll, and then with &quot;Narwhal&quot;, landed a strong detachment of the US Army&#x27;s Alaskan Scouts on Attu in the Aleutian Islands, preparatory to the main landing that regained that island from the Japanese in May 1943. For the final two years of the war, the two boats were devoted almost exclusively to clandestine insertion and retrieval operations behind enemy lines, particularly in preparation for the U.S. campaign to retake the Philippines.

With the end of the war in sight, &quot;Narwhal&quot; and &quot;Nautilus&quot; were withdrawn from service in April and June 1945, respectively, and sold for breaking up soon thereafter. &quot;Narwhal&quot;&#x27;s 6-inch (152 mm) guns are retained as a memorial at the Naval Submarine Base New London, Connecticut.

==&quot;V-7&quot;—&quot;Dolphin&quot;==
The penultimate design in the V-boat series was laid down at Portsmouth in June 1930 as &quot;V-7&quot; and was launched as two years later. With her name changed while she was still on the building slip, she never officially carried the name &quot;V-7&quot; during her commissioned life. With a length of and a displacement only a little more than half that of her three predecessors ( surfaced, submerged), &quot;Dolphin&quot; was clearly an attempt to strike a happy medium between those latter ships and earlier S-class submarines, which were little more than large coastal boats. The general arrangement of propulsion machinery was identical to that of &quot;V-5&quot; and &quot;V-6&quot;, but even with a surface displacement of only 1,718 tons, &quot;Dolphin&#x27;&quot;s scaled-down main engines—rated at each—could only just deliver the surface speed of the larger ships, and her endurance and torpedo load-out were much reduced. The torpedo armament was six 21-inch (533 mm) tubes (4 bow, 2 stern), with 18 torpedoes. A 4-inch (102 mm)/50 caliber deck gun was equipped. &quot;Dolphin&quot;&#x27;s size and weight were nearly ideal for the range and duration of the war patrols that became customary in the Pacific during World War II, and the war-time &quot;Gato&quot;, &quot;Balao&quot;, and &quot;Tench&quot; classes had similar dimensions. Portsmouth continued the experiments with welding that were begun on &quot;V-4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, and &quot;6&quot;, and expanded it to include portions of the internal framing, tanks, and outer hull.

Early in the war, &quot;Dolphin&quot; made three patrols from Pearl Harbor without notable distinction, and her deteriorating material condition soon restricted her to training duties, first in Hawaii, and then at New London, Connecticut, for the duration of the war. She was decommissioned in October 1945 and sold for scrapping a year later.

==&quot;V-8&quot; and &quot;V-9&quot;—&quot;Cachalot&quot; and &quot;Cuttlefish&quot;==
Even before &quot;V-5&quot; and &quot;V-6&quot; had been completed and &quot;V-7&quot; laid down, submarine officer opinion had begun to shift in favor of smaller boats similar to Germany&#x27;s 1,200-ton design from World War I. Then, when the London Naval Treaty of 1930 for the first time imposed international limits on total submarine tonnage, the incentive to build smaller ships became especially compelling. The restrictions of the London Naval Treaty were a factor in the disposal in 1930 of &quot;T-1&quot;, &quot;T-2&quot;, and &quot;T-3&quot;, which had been laid up for nearly a decade. By special agreement, &quot;Argonaut&quot;, &quot;Narwhal&quot;, and &quot;Nautilus&quot; were exempted from the treaty limitations.

An extensive study was conducted to determine the optimum submarine size under the treaty restrictions, factoring in total force, endurance, and percentage of the force that could be maintained on station far from a base, as in a Pacific war scenario. The result was the two smallest V-boats, &quot;Cachalot&quot; (originally &quot;V-8&quot;) and &quot;Cuttlefish&quot; (originally &quot;V-9&quot;), funded in fiscal year 1932. At overall and only surface displacement, &quot;Cachalot&quot; and &quot;Cuttlefish&quot; were even smaller than the &quot;T&quot;-boats of 15 years earlier. The engineering plant consisted of two innovative, compact &quot;Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-Nürnberg&quot; (MAN)-designed, BuEng-built main diesels, supposedly capable of delivering each, plus a single diesel generator rated at . Although the boats approached on trials, the new MAN engines failed repeatedly from excessive vibration and were replaced in 1938 by General Motors diesels with reduction gearing. The armament was similar to &quot;Dolphin&quot;: six 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes (4 bow, 2 stern), with 16 torpedoes. A 3-inch (76 mm)/50 caliber deck gun was equipped, a decrease in gun caliber that would persist through early World War II. In the 1930s it was felt that a larger gun would encourage submarine captains to fight on the surface against superior anti-submarine ships, but eventually war experience showed that a larger gun was needed.

The Navy assigned &quot;Cuttlefish&quot; to the Electric Boat Company, the first submarine contract award to a private yard since the last of the &quot;S&quot;-class in 1918. Accordingly, &quot;Cuttlefish&quot; differed from her Portsmouth-built sister, &quot;Cachalot&quot;, in many respects, including more spacious internal arrangements, and the first installation of air conditioning on a U.S. submarine. Electric Boat expanded on the use of welding with their boat, with much of the outer hull being welded, but with the internal pressure hull still riveted. Moreover, &quot;Cachalot&quot; and &quot;Cuttlefish&quot; served as the first test beds for the Mark I Torpedo Data Computer that revolutionized underwater fire control in the mid-1930s.

Unfortunately, because small size severely limited their speed, endurance, and weapons load, neither boat was successful under the conditions of the Pacific War. Each did three scoreless war patrols in the central and western Pacific, and &quot;Cachalot&quot; did one in Alaskan waters, but by late 1942, it was clear both were out-classed and worn out, and they finished the war at New London as training ships. The two were decommissioned in October 1945 and broken up several years later.

==Submarines==

In 1920, the Navy adopted a hull number scheme that distinguished between coastal and general purpose boats, designated &quot;SS&quot;; and fleet boats, designated &quot;SF.&quot; Accordingly, &quot;T-1&quot; through &quot;T-3&quot; were originally designated SF-1 through SF-3, and &quot;V-1&quot; through &quot;V-7&quot; were designated SF-4 through SF-10. The system was changed to designate V-boats as &quot;SC&quot; (cruiser submarines) before &quot;V-8&quot; and &quot;V-9&quot; were ordered. In 1931 all received names, and all except &quot;V-4&quot; were redesignated in the &quot;SS&quot; series. &quot;V-4&quot; was also designated SM-1 at one time, as a &quot;submarine mine-layer&quot;.

<text>Jean-Antoine Roucher (February 22, 1745 - July 25, 1794), was a French poet.

Roucher was born in Montpellier, the son of a tailor. His epithalamium on Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette won him the favour of Turgot, and a salt-tax collectorship. His poem, entitled &quot;Les Mois&quot;, appeared in 1779, was praised in manuscript, but critically lambasted until the 19th century. The malicious wit of Antoine de Rivarol&#x27;s &quot;mot&quot; on the critical failure of the poem, &quot;Cest le plus beau naufrage du siècle,&quot; reflects the fact that one of the most elaborate passages describes a shipwreck.

Roucher was a disciple of Voltaire, and a friend of the French Revolution, but he remained moderate in his opinions. He presided over an anti-Jacobin club, and denounced the tyranny of the popular demagogues in supplements published with the &quot;Journal de Paris&quot; in 1792. He was arrested on October 4, 1793, and, accused of being the leader of a conspiracy among the prisoners at Saint-Lazare. He was sent to the guillotine on the same tumbril as his friend André Chénier, on July 25, 1794.

In 1790, Roucher had translated Adam Smith&#x27;s &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot;. His letters from prison were edited by his son-in-law under the title of &quot;Consolations de ma captivité&quot; (1797), and his death was made the subject of an 1834 tragedy by his playwright brother Claude Roucher-Deratte, a voluminous writer.

==Honours==
In 1847, botanist Planch. named a genus of flowering plants from Nicaragua to southern Tropical America, in the family Linaceae, &quot;Roucheria&quot; in his honour.
Then in 1921, botanist Hallier f., named a genus of flowering plants from Cambodia, Vietnam and Borneo, (also in the family Linaceae) &quot;Indorouchera&quot; in his honour, with the &#x27;Indo&#x27; prefix.

<text>Akiba Kiwelowicz Rubinstein (1 December 1880 – 14 March 1961) was a Polish chess player. He is considered to have been one of the greatest players never to have become World Chess Champion. Rubinstein was granted the title International Grandmaster in 1950, at its inauguration.

In his youth, he defeated top players José Raúl Capablanca and Carl Schlechter and was scheduled to play a match with Emanuel Lasker for the World Chess Championship in 1914, but it was cancelled due to the outbreak of World War I. He was unable to re-create consistently the same form after the war, and his later life was plagued by mental illness.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Akiba Kiwelowicz Rubinstein was born in Stawiski, Congress Poland, to a Jewish family. He was the youngest of 12 children, but only one sister survived to adulthood. Rubinstein learned to play chess at the relatively late age of 14, and his family had planned for him to become a rabbi. He trained with and played against the strong master Gersz Salwe in Łódź and in 1903, after finishing fifth in a tournament in Kiev, Rubinstein decided to abandon his rabbinical studies and devote himself entirely to chess.

===Chess career===

Between 1907 and 1912, Rubinstein established himself as one of the strongest players in the world. In 1907, he won the Carlsbad tournament and the All-Russian Masters&#x27; tournament, and shared first at Saint Petersburg. In 1912 he had a record string of wins, finishing first in five consecutive major tournaments: San Sebastián, Pöstyén, Breslau, Warsaw and Vilna (All-Russian Masters&#x27; tournament), although none of these events included Lasker or Capablanca. Some sources believe that he was stronger than World Champion Emanuel Lasker at this time. Ratings from Chessmetrics support this conclusion, placing him as world No. 1 between mid-1912 and mid-1914.

During the first decade of the 20th century, the playing field for competitive chess was relatively thin. Wilhelm Steinitz, the first universally recognized world champion, died in 1900 after having been largely retired from chess for several years, Russian master Mikhail Chigorin was nearing the end of his life, while American master Frank Marshall lived on the other side of the Atlantic, far from the center of chess activity in Europe. Another promising American master, Harry Nelson Pillsbury, had died in 1906 at just 33. In the pre-FIDE era, the reigning world champion handpicked his challenger, and Emanuel Lasker demanded a high sum of money that Rubinstein could not produce. In the St. Petersburg tournament in 1909, he had tied with Lasker and won his individual encounter with him. However, he had a poor showing at the 1914 St. Petersburg tournament, not placing in the top five. A match with Lasker was arranged for October 1914, but it did not take place because of the outbreak of World War I.

Rubinstein&#x27;s peak as a player is generally considered to have been between 1907 and 1914. During World War I, he was confined to Poland, although he played in a few organized chess events there and traveled to Berlin in early 1918 for a tournament. His playing after the war never regained the same consistency as it had pre-1914. He and his family moved to Sweden following the Armistice in November 1918, where they stayed until 1922, and then moved to Germany. Rubinstein won at Vienna in 1922, ahead of future World Champion Alexander Alekhine, and was the leader of the Polish team that won the 1930 Chess Olympiad at Hamburg with a record of thirteen wins and four draws. He also won an Olympic silver at the 1931 Chess Olympiad, again leading the Polish team.

Rubinstein came in fourth place in the London 1922 tournament, after which the new world champion Jose Raul Capablanca offered to play him in a match if he could raise the money, which once again he was unable to do. At Hastings 1922, he came in second place, followed by a fifth-place finish at Teplitz-Schönau late in the year, and then won in Vienna brilliantly. This triumph, however, was soured when Austrian border guards impounded most of the prize money he had won. Rubinstein closed out 1922 with another appearance at Hastings, which he won, but his tournament record during 1923 was disappointing as he came in just twelfth place at Carlsbad and tenth at Maehrisch-Ostrau.

His first tournament of 1924, at Meran, saw him come in third. He attempted to participate in the New York tournament that spring but was excluded from the event due to a limited number of available slots, all of which were filled. Rubinstein&#x27;s 1925 tournament record was reasonably good, but his year-end appearance in Moscow saw him come in 14th. His record in 1926 was fair but not outstanding. That year, the Rubinstein family moved to Belgium permanently.

In 1927, Rubinstein visited his birthplace in Poland, where he won the Polish Championship in Łódź. He embarked on an exhibition tour of the United States in early 1928; although a match with reigning US chess champion Frank Marshall was proposed along with an international tournament, it never materialized. He tied third with Max Euwe at Bad Kissingen and then delivered a poor performance in Berlin. Rubinstein had his best post-WWI showing during 1929, when he dominated the Ramsgate tournament in Britain and had excellent showings at Carlsbad and Budapest. He won Rogaška-Slatina.

As the 1930s started, Rubinstein contested the San Remo tournament, coming in fourth. He played well in a few Belgian events that year, and then third place at Scarborough. His performance at Liege was weak, possibly due to exhaustion. He skipped Bled 1931 despite an invitation, played well at Antwerp, but came in dead last at Rotterdam. This was the last major chess event he participated in.

===Mental health problems and later life===

After 1932 he withdrew from tournament play as his noted anthropophobia showed traces of schizophrenia during a mental health breakdown. In one period, after making a chess move he would go and hide in the corner of the tournament hall while awaiting his opponent&#x27;s reply. Regardless, his former strength was recognized by FIDE when he was one of 27 players awarded the inaugural Grandmaster title in 1950.

It is not clear how Rubinstein, who was Jewish, survived World War II in Nazi-occupied Belgium. Chess historian Edward Winter has written on the subject. Citing a number of Rubinstein&#x27;s peers in the chess world and people who were close to him, it seems that Rubinstein spent the war in a sanatorium. He cites a story about Rubinstein that has, since the war, been published in various books and articles, with varying details: &quot;Nazi investigators once descended on the place and asked Rubinstein, &quot;Are you happy here?&quot; &quot;Not at all&quot;, Rubinstein replied. &quot;Would you prefer to go to Germany and work for the Wehrmacht?&quot; &quot;I&#x27;d be delighted to&quot;, Rubinstein replied. &quot;Then he really must be barmy&quot;, the Nazis decided&quot;, but Winter quotes Rubinstein&#x27;s biographers as saying &quot;Most stories concerning Rubinstein are at best half truths, which have become so embellished over time that they bear little resemblance to what actually transpired&quot;, before adding &quot;That is indisputable.&quot;

Rubinstein was also a well-known coffee drinker, and was known to consume the hot beverage in large quantities before important matches. Unlike many other top grandmasters, he left no literary legacy, which has been attributed to his mental health problems. He spent the last 29 years of his life living at home with his family and in a sanatorium because of his severe mental illness. Rubinstein is a tragic, mentally ill character in the novel &quot;The Lüneburg Variation&quot; about chess masters, obsession and revenge, by Italian writer Paolo Maurensig.
However, while in the mental clinic Rubinstein was visited by Alberic O&#x27;Kelly on a number of occasions and he provided the latter with some chess guidance.

==Legacy==

He was one of the earliest chess players to take the endgame into account when choosing and playing the opening. He was exceptionally talented in the endgame, particularly in rook endings, where he broke new ground in knowledge. Jeremy Silman ranked him as one of the five best endgame players of all time, and a master of rook endgames.

He originated the Rubinstein System against the Tarrasch Defense variation of the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined: 1.d4 d5 2.Nf3 c5 3.c4 e6 4.cxd5 exd5 5.Nc3 Nc6 6.g3 Nf6 7.Bg2 (Rubinstein–Tarrasch, 1912). He is also credited with inventing the Meran Variation, which stems from the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined but reaches a position of the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Accepted with an extra move for Black.

Many opening variations are named for him. According to Grandmaster Boris Gelfand, &quot;Most of the modern openings are based on Rubinstein.&quot; The &quot;Rubinstein Attack&quot; often refers to 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Be7 5.e3 0-0 6.Nf3 Nbd7 7.Qc2. The Rubinstein Variation of the French Defence arises after 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 (or 3.Nd2) dxe4 4.Nxe4. Apart from 4.Qc2, the Rubinstein Variation of the Nimzo-Indian: 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e3. There are also the Rubinstein Variation of the Four Knights Game, which arises after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bb5 Nd4, and the Rubinstein Variation of the Symmetrical English, 1.c4 c5 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.g3 d5 4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.Bg2 Nc7, a complex system that is very popular at the grandmaster level.

The Rubinstein Trap, an opening trap in the Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined that loses at least a pawn for Black, is named for him because he fell into it twice. One version of it runs 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.cxd5 exd5 5.Bg5 Be7 6.e3 0-0 7.Nf3 Nbd7 8.Bd3 c6 10.0-0 Re8 11.Rc1 h6 12. Bf4 Nh5? 13. Nxd5! Now 13...cxd5?? is met by 14.Bc7, winning the queen, while 13...Nxf4 14.Nxf4 leaves White a pawn ahead.

The Rubinstein Memorial tournament in his honour has been held annually since 1963 in Polanica Zdrój, with a glittering list of top-flight winners. Boris Gelfand has named Rubinstein as his favourite player, and once said, &quot;what I like in chess ... comes from Akiba.&quot;

==Notable games==
*Hermanis Mattison vs. Akiba Rubinstein, Carlsbad 1929, (C68), 0–1 This game contains a rook and pawn ending that seemed &quot;hopelessly drawn&quot; but was won by Rubinstein. The editor of the tournament book said that if this game had been played 300 years earlier, Rubinstein would have been burned at the stake for dealing with evil spirits.
*George Rotlewi vs. Akiba Rubinstein, Lodz 1907, Tarrasch Defense: Symmetrical Variation (D02), 0–1 This game contains an attacking combination that was called &quot;perhaps the most magnificent ... of all time&quot; by Carl Schlechter.
*Akiba Rubinstein vs. Emanuel Lasker, St.Petersburg 1909, Queen&#x27;s Gambit Declined: Orthodox Variation (D30), 1–0 This game ends in a position where Lasker has no good moves (zugzwang).

*Akiba Rubinstein vs. Karel Hromádka, Moravská Ostrava 1923, King&#x27;s Gambit Declined: Classical Variation (C30), 1–0 A game full of tactics and pieces in which Rubinstein beat former Czech champion Karel Hromádka.
*Akiba Rubinstein vs. Carl Schlechter, San Sebastian 1912, 1–0 Capablanca called this game &quot;a monument of magnificent precision&quot;.
*Akiba Rubinstein vs. Milan Vidmar Sr., Berlin 1908, 0–1 This game was the sensation of the tournament, in that Vidmar defeated Rubinstein, the winner of six previous tournaments. Vidmar employed the then novel Budapest Gambit. The game featured a spectacular King hunt, with the White King fleeing from e1 to h5. White resigned on move 24, one move shy of checkmate.

==Personal life==

In 1917, Rubinstein married Eugénie Lew. They had two sons, Jonas in 1918 and Sammy in 1927. For a time, they lived above the restaurant that Eugénie operated. After she died in 1954, Rubinstein lived in an old-people&#x27;s home until his death in 1961 at the age of 80. He reportedly still followed chess in his final years; his sons recalled going over the games of the 1954 Botvinnik–Smyslov world championship match with him.

<doc id="491622" wikidata="Q5170190" url="?curid=491622" title="Damasio's theory of consciousness">
<text>Developed in his (1999) book, &quot;The Feeling of What Happens&quot;, Antonio Damasio&#x27;s theory of consciousness proposes that consciousness arises from the interactions between the brain, the body, and the environment. According to this theory, consciousness is not a unitary experience, but rather emerges from the dynamic interplay between different brain regions and their corresponding bodily states. Damasio argues that our conscious experiences are influenced by the emotional responses that are generated by our body&#x27;s interactions with the environment, and that these emotional responses play a crucial role in shaping our conscious experience. This theory emphasizes the importance of the body and its physiological processes in the emergence of consciousness.

Damasio&#x27;s three layered theory is based on a hierarchy of stages, with each stage building upon the last. The most basic representation of the organism is referred to as the Protoself, Core Consciousness, and Extended Consciousness. Damasio&#x27;s approach to explaining the development of consciousness relies on three notions: emotion, feeling, and feeling a feeling. Emotions are a collection of unconscious neural responses that give rise to feelings. Emotions are complex reactions to stimuli that cause observable external changes in the organism. A feeling arises when the organism becomes aware of the changes it is experiencing as a result of external or internal stimuli. Antonio Damasio’s work on consciousness :

1. Holistic Approach: Damasio argues that consciousness isn’t just a brain function but involves the entire body. He suggests that the brain works in tandem with older biological systems like the endocrine and immune systems, emphasizing a holistic view of consciousness .

2. Homeostasis as Central: Damasio’s theory places homeostasis at the core of consciousness, proposing that consciousness evolved to help organisms maintain internal stability, which is crucial for survival .

3. Microbiome Influence: Damasio highlights the role of the gut microbiome in influencing brain function and emotional states, suggesting that our consciousness is affected by the microbial environment within our bodies .

4. Dual Mind Registers: He distinguishes between two mental registers: one for cognitive functions like reasoning, and another for emotions and feelings, which are tied to the body’s state .

==Protoself==

According to Damasio&#x27;s theory of consciousness, the protoself is the first stage in the hierarchical process of consciousness generation. Shared by many species, the protoself is the most basic representation of the organism, and it arises from the brain&#x27;s constant interaction with the body. The protoself is an unconscious process that creates a &quot;map&quot; of the body&#x27;s physiological state, which is then used by the brain to generate conscious experience. This &quot;map&quot; is constantly updated as the brain receives new stimuli from the body, and it forms the foundation for the development of more complex forms of consciousness.

Damasio asserts that the protoself is signified by a collection of neural patterns that are representative of the body&#x27;s internal state. The function of this &#x27;self&#x27; is to constantly detect and record, moment by moment, the internal physical changes that affect the homeostasis of the organism. Protoself does not represent a traditional sense of self; rather, it is a pre-conscious state, which provides a reference for the core self and autobiographical self to build from. As Damasio puts it, &quot;Protoself is a coherent collection of neural patterns, which map moment-by-moment the state of the physical structure of the organism&quot; (Damasio 1999).

Multiple brain areas are required for the protoself to function. Namely, the hypothalamus, which controls the general homeostasis of the organism, the brain stem, whose nuclei map body signals, and the insular cortex, whose function is linked to emotion. These brain areas work together to keep up with the constant process of collecting neural patterns to map the current status of the body&#x27;s responses to environmental changes. The protoself does not require language in order to function; moreover, it is a direct report of one&#x27;s experience. In this state, emotion begins to manifest itself as second-order neural patterns located in subcortical areas of the brain. Emotion acts as a neural object, from which a physical reaction can be drawn. This reaction causes the organism to become aware of the changes that are affecting it. From this realization, springs Damasio&#x27;s notion of “feeling”. This occurs when the patterns contributing to emotion manifest as mental images, or brain movies. When the body is modified by these neural objects, the second layer of self emerges. This is known as core consciousness.

==Core consciousness==

Sufficiently more evolved is the second layer of Damasio&#x27;s theory, Core Consciousness. This emergent process occurs when an organism becomes consciously aware of feelings associated with changes occurring to its internal bodily state; it is able to recognize that its thoughts are its own, and that they are formulated in its own perspective. It develops a momentary sense of self, as the brain continuously builds representative images, based on communications received from the Protoself. This level of consciousness is not exclusive to human beings and remains consistent and stable throughout the lifetime of the organism The image is a result of mental patterns which are caused by an interaction with internal or external stimulus. A relationship is established, between the organism and the object it is observing as the brain continuously creates images to represent the organism&#x27;s experience of qualia.

Damasio&#x27;s definition of emotion is that of an unconscious reaction to any internal or external stimulus which activates neural patterns in the brain. ‘Feeling’ emerges as a still unconscious state which simply senses the changes affecting the Protoself due to the emotional state. These patterns develop into mental images, which then float into the organism&#x27;s awareness. Put simply, consciousness is the feeling of knowing a feeling. When the organism becomes aware of the feeling that its bodily state (Protoself) is being affected by its experiences, or response to emotion, Core Consciousness is born. The brain continues to present nonverbal narrative sequence of images in the mind of the organism, based on its relationship to objects. An object in this context can be anything from a person, to a melody, to a neural image. Core consciousness is concerned only with the present moment, here and now. It does not require language or memory, nor can it reflect on past experiences or project itself into the future.

==Extended consciousness==

When consciousness moves beyond the here and now, Damasio&#x27;s third and final layer emerges as Extended Consciousness. This level could not exist without its predecessors, and, unlike them, requires a vast use of conventional memory. Therefore, an injury to a person&#x27;s memory center can cause damage to their extended consciousness, without hurting the other layers. The autobiographical self draws on memory of past experiences which involves use of higher thought. This autobiographical layer of self is developed gradually over time. Working memory is necessary for an extensive display of items to be recalled and referenced. Linguistic areas of the brain are activated to enhance the organism&#x27;s experience, however, according to the language of thought hypothesis, language would not be necessarily required.

== Criticism ==
Damasio&#x27;s theory of consciousness has been met with criticism for its lack of explanation regarding the generation of conscious experiences by the brain. Researchers have posited that the brain&#x27;s interaction with the body alone cannot account for the complexity of conscious experience, and that additional factors must be considered. Furthermore, the theory has been criticized for its inadequate treatment of the concept of self-awareness and its lack of a clear method of measuring consciousness, which hinders empirical testing and evaluation.

Theories of emotion currently fall into four main categories which follow one another in a historical series: evolutionary (ethological), physiological, neurological, and cognitive.

# Evolutionary theories derive from Darwin&#x27;s &#x27;Emotions in man and the animals&#x27;.
# Physiological theories suggest that responses within the body are responsible for emotions.
# Neurological theories propose that activity within the brain leads to emotional responses.
# Cognitive theories argue that thoughts and other mental activity play an essential role in forming emotions.

Note that no current theory of emotion falls strictly within a single category, rather each theory uses one approach to form its core premises from which it is then able to extend its main postulates.

Damasio&#x27;s tri-level view of the human mind, which posits that we share the two lowest levels with other animals, has been suggested before. For example, see Dyer ( www.conscious-computation.webnode.com ).

Dyer&#x27;s triune expansion is compared to Damasio&#x27;s-

1. sensorimotor stage (c.f. Damasio&#x27;s Protoself)

2. spatiotemporal stage (Core-Consciousness)

3. cognolinguistic stage (Extended Consciousness)

An important feature of Damasio&#x27;s theory (one that it shares with Dyer&#x27;s theory) is the key role played by mental images, consciously mediating the information exchange between endocrine and cognitive. 

Ledoux and Brown have a different view of how emotion is connected to general cognition. They place emotionality on a similar level as that of other cognitive states. (In fairness, both Dyer&#x27;s and Damasio&#x27;s models concur on this point, ie that emotionality is not isolated to a particular layer within the tri-level framework). 

Earlier less sophisticated models placed the emotions strictly within the Limbic circuits, where their primary role was to consciously respond to, as well as cause responses within, the hypothalamus, the interface between intentional mind states and metabolic (endocrine) body states.

Emotionality is demonstrably a global mind state, just like consciousness. For example, we can be simultaneously aware of (low-level) a pain (low-level) in our body, and an idea (high level) that enters our imagination (working memory). Likewise, our (low-level) emotional reaction to a painful workplace injury (fear, threat to well-being) can coexist with our (high-level) feeling of anger and indignation at the co-worker who failed to follow safety guidelines.

=== Substantive Process ===
A careful reading of Damasio&#x27;s work reveals that he distinguishes his theories from those of his predecessors, in how the formalistic elements interact with each other in a dynamically integrated system. E.g, the suggestion of a dynamic neural map ultimately posits that we are the instantaneous configuration of a neural state in the present moment, rather than the supporting biological construct. I.e., our conscious identity is the software, not the hardware, even though our unique hardware constrains how we operate as the software.

=== Need for consciousness and qualia ===
A common criticism stems from the fact that both knowing and feeling can be processed with equal success without conscious awareness, as machines, for instance, do, and those models do not explain the need for consciousness and qualia.

<text>Pierre Louis de Lacretelle (9 October 1751 – 5 September 1824) was a French lawyer, politician and writer.

He was born in Metz, the elder brother of Jean Charles Dominique de Lacretelle.
He practised as a barrister in Paris. In 1784 he shared a prize for an award-winning essay with Maximilien Robespierre. Under the French Revolution he was elected as a &quot;député suppléant&quot; in the Constituent Assembly, and later as a deputy in the Legislative Assembly.

He belonged to the moderate party known as the Feuillants, but after 10 August 1792 he ceased to take part in public life. In 1803 he became a member of the Institut de France, taking the place of La Harpe. From 1806 he was a member of the Académie française.

Under the Restoration he was one of the chief editors of the &quot;Minerve française&quot;. He also wrote also an essay, &quot;Sur le 18 Brumaire&quot; (1799), some &quot;Fragments politiques et littéraires&quot; (1817), and a treatise &quot;Des partis politiques et des factions de ca pretendue aristocratie d&#x27;aujourd&#x27;hui&quot; (1819). In 1823, Bossange frères published his &quot;Œuvres complètes&quot; in 3 volumes.

<text>Graham Thomas Parker (born 18 November 1950) is an English singer-songwriter, who is best known as the lead singer of the British band Graham Parker &amp; the Rumour.

==Life and career==
===Early career (1960s–1976)===
Parker was born in Hackney, East London, in 1950. He was a pupil at Chobham Secondary Modern School in Surrey. After the success of the Beatles, Parker and some other 12/13-year-olds formed the Deepcut Three, soon renamed the Black Rockers. None of the members actually learned to play their instruments, however, and were merely dress-up bands, adopting Beatle haircuts, black jeans and polo neck sweaters. By the time Parker was 15 he was a fan of soul music, especially Otis Redding, and would go to dance clubs in the nearby towns of Woking and Camberley where there was a thriving appreciation of soul music, Motown and ska.

Parker left school at 16 and went to work at the Animal Virus Research Institute in Pirbright, Surrey, where he bred animals for foot-and-mouth disease research. At 18 he left the job and moved to Guernsey in the Channel Islands where he took a variety of jobs, picking tomatoes, digging ditches, collecting money from pinball machines, and working in a bakery. In Guernsey he bought an acoustic guitar and began to learn fingerpicking style and began writing songs with lyrics heavily influenced by the psychedelic music of the time.

Parker returned to England for a year, living in Chichester in Sussex where he worked at the Chichester Rubber Glove Factory. By 1971, he had left England again and spent time in Paris. From France, Parker hitchhiked through Spain to Morocco, where he travelled around for a year before moving to Gibraltar. In Gibraltar he worked on the docks unloading frozen foods, which he then helped deliver to supermarkets. His guitar playing and writing skills were improving, and after playing songs to a few locals in a bar, he found himself on an afternoon show on Gibraltar television where he performed two or three of his own songs. At that time, a strongly psychedelic-influenced band named Pegasus often played in the same bar and asked Parker to join them. With Parker in the band playing a borrowed electric guitar, Pegasus played one show in Gibraltar before going to Tangier, Morocco, where they briefly performed in a nightclub. Parker, however, was growing out of the hippie trappings and decided the band needed to learn a few songs that involved major keys (all the songs they played were in A minor) and so taught the members some of the soul numbers he had loved as a youth, including Wilson Pickett’s &quot;In The Midnight Hour&quot;. He also tired of the band&#x27;s hippie name and renamed them Terry Burbot&#x27;s Magic Mud.

In late 1972, Parker returned to England and lived with his parents, working at a petrol station around the corner from his childhood home in Deepcut. By now he was determined to pursue a career in music and worked steadily on improving his guitar playing and song writing. In late 1974 he placed an ad in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; seeking like-minded backing musicians. One of the musicians who answered the ad was Noel Brown, a guitarist who lived in south London. Brown introduced him to Paul &quot;Bassman&quot; Riley who had recently been a member of Chilli Willi and the Red Hot Peppers. (Brown also found Parker a gig at Southern Comfort, a tiny hamburger café on Seven Sisters Road in Finsbury Park, London where he played solo, performing a mixture of original songs and covers.) Riley thought Parker should meet Dave Robinson, the manager of the by now defunct Brinsley Schwarz band. Robinson had a small studio above the Hope &amp; Anchor pub in Islington and began to record Parker, sometimes solo and sometimes with a few musicians behind him.

One of the songs Parker recorded was &quot;Between You and Me.&quot; This demo version ended up on Parker&#x27;s first album, &quot;Howlin&#x27; Wind&quot;, after the Rumour tried to record it but failed to achieve the natural feel of the demo. Another song, &quot;Nothin&#x27;s Gonna Pull Us Apart&quot; was played, in demo form, on the Charlie Gillett show &quot;Honky Tonk&quot; on BBC London 94.9. On hearing the song, Nigel Grainge from Phonogram Records called Gillett and asked who the new singer was. By now Robinson had become Parker&#x27;s manager and a deal with Phonogram was struck. Robinson then went about recruiting the musicians who would become the Rumour, and recording for &quot;Howlin’ Wind&quot; began in the winter of 1975 with Nick Lowe producing. In 1975, he recorded a few demo tracks in London with Dave Robinson, who would shortly found Stiff Records and who connected Parker with his first backing band of note, The Rumour. Parker had one track, &quot;Back to Schooldays&quot;, released on the compilation album, &quot;A Bunch of Stiff Records&quot; for Stiff Records.

In the summer of 1975, Parker joined ex-members of three British Pub rock (United Kingdom) bands to form Graham Parker and the Rumour: Parker (lead vocals, guitar) with Brinsley Schwarz (lead guitar) and Bob Andrews (keyboards) (both ex Brinsley Schwarz), Martin Belmont (rhythm guitar, ex Ducks Deluxe) and Andrew Bodnar (bass) and Steve Goulding (drums). They began in the British pub rock scene, augmented at times by a four-man horn section known as The Rumour Horns: John &quot;Irish&quot; Earle (saxophone), Chris Gower (trombone), Dick Hanson (trumpet), and Ray Beavis (saxophone).

The band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Howlin&#x27; Wind&quot;, was released to acclaim in April 1976 and was rapidly followed by the stylistically similar &quot;Heat Treatment&quot;. A mixture of rock, ballads, and reggae-influenced numbers, these albums reflected Parker&#x27;s early influences and contained the songs which formed the core of Parker&#x27;s live shows – &quot;Black Honey&quot;, &quot;Soul Shoes&quot;, &quot;Lady Doctor&quot;, &quot;Fool&#x27;s Gold&quot;, and his early signature tune &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask Me Questions&quot;, which hit the top 40 in the UK Singles Chart.

Establishing a recording career in early 1976, Parker preceded two other new wave English singer-songwriters with whom he is often compared: Elvis Costello and Joe Jackson. (Costello&#x27;s first single was released in 1977, and Jackson&#x27;s first solo single in late 1978). Jackson said of Parker in a 1979 interview, &quot;Graham Parker I really like. I think he&#x27;s very genuine.&quot;

===New direction (1977)===
Graham Parker and the Rumour appeared on BBC television&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in 1977, performing their version of The Trammps&#x27; &quot;Hold Back the Night&quot; from &quot;The Pink Parker&quot; EP, a top 30 hit in the UK Singles Chart in March 1977. At this point, Parker began to change his songwriting style, hoping to break into the American market. The first fruits of this new direction appeared on &quot;Stick To Me&quot; (1977), which broke the top 20 on the UK Albums Chart.

Parker and the Rumour gained a following in Australia thanks to the support of community radio (4ZZZ, 3RRR), Sydney independent rock station Double Jay (2JJ) and the ABC&#x27;s weekly pop TV show &quot;Countdown&quot;, which gave the group nationwide exposure. They made their first tour there in 1978, where they spotted rising Australian band The Sports, who subsequently supported Parker and the Rumour on their early 1979 UK tour. The group made a second Australian tour in late 1979, when Parker appeared on &quot;Countdown&quot; as a guest presenter.

===&quot;Squeezing Out Sparks&quot; (1978–1979)===
An official Graham Parker and The Rumour live album, &quot;The Parkerilla&quot;, issued in 1978, had nothing new: three sides were live, with versions of previously released songs; the fourth was devoted to a &quot;disco&quot; remake of &quot;Hey Lord, Don&#x27;t Ask Me Questions&quot;. &quot;The Parkerilla&quot; satisfied his contractual obligation to Mercury Records, freeing him to sign with Arista. Parker had long been dissatisfied with the performance of Mercury Records, finally issuing in 1979 as a single B-side &quot;Mercury Poisoning&quot; a song that directly attacked it. The flip side of the single was a cover of the Jackson Five song &quot;I Want You Back (Alive).&quot;

Graham Parker and The Rumour were one of the four support acts for Bob Dylan at the Picnic at Blackbushe on 15 July 1978. The band also opened Richard Branson&#x27;s new club The Venue, London, in November 1978.

Energized by his new label, Arista Records, and with record producer Jack Nitzsche, Parker wrote the songs that would form the basis for &quot;Squeezing Out Sparks&quot;, widely held to be the best album of his career. For this album, The Rumour&#x27;s brass section, prominent on all previous albums, was jettisoned.

&quot;Squeezing Out Sparks&quot; (1979) was named by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; at No. 335 on its List of Rolling Stone&#x27;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In an early 1987 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of their top 100 albums from 1967 to 1987, &quot;Squeezing Out Sparks&quot; was ranked at No. 45, while &quot;Howlin&#x27; Wind&quot; came in at No. 54. The album features several of Parker&#x27;s most famous songs, including &quot;Passion Is No Ordinary Word&quot;, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Be Too Strong&quot;, and the singles &quot;Local Girls&quot;, &quot;Protection&quot;, and &quot;Discovering Japan&quot;. The companion live album &quot;Live Sparks&quot;, was sent to US radio stations as part of a concerted promotional campaign.

The jettisoned brass section continued to play on other people&#x27;s records, credited as The Irish Horns (on the album &quot;London Calling&quot; by The Clash) or The Rumour Brass, most notably on Katrina and the Waves&#x27; 1985 hit &quot;Walking On Sunshine&quot;.

===The end of The Rumour (1980)===
Bob Andrews left The Rumour in early 1980, and was not officially replaced. However, in studio sessions for the next album, Nicky Hopkins and Danny Federici (of The E Street Band) played keyboards.

1980&#x27;s &quot;The Up Escalator&quot; was Parker&#x27;s highest-charting album in the UK, and was produced by Jimmy Iovine. The album featured the single &quot;Stupefaction&quot; and the track &quot;Endless Night&quot;, which had guest vocals from Bruce Springsteen. The front cover of the album credited only Graham Parker, not &quot;Graham Parker and The Rumour&quot;. The album was certified Gold in Canada (for over 50,000 copies sold).

&quot;The Up Escalator&quot; would prove to be Parker&#x27;s last album with the Rumour until a reunion decades later. However, Rumour guitarist Brinsley Schwarz reunited with Parker in 1983 and played on most of his albums through to the decade&#x27;s end. Other Rumour members also played with Parker in later years: bassist Andrew Bodnar would rejoin Parker from 1988 through the mid-1990s, and drummer Steve Goulding would play on Parker&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;Deepcut To Nowhere&quot;.

===Commercial success (1981–1990)===
The 1980s were Parker&#x27;s most commercially successful years, with well-financed recordings and radio and video play. His follow-up to &quot;The Up Escalator&quot;, 1982&#x27;s &quot;Another Grey Area&quot;, used session musicians Nicky Hopkins and Hugh McCracken. This album charted at UK No. 40 and US No. 51, and spun off a top 50 UK single in &quot;Temporary Beauty&quot;.

1983&#x27;s &quot;The Real Macaw&quot;, with drumming by Gilson Lavis of Squeeze and Brinsley Schwarz on guitar, did not fare as well, hitting US No. 59 on the album charts but missing the UK charts altogether. However, Parker&#x27;s 1985 release &quot;Steady Nerves&quot; (credited to Graham Parker and The Shot) was a moderate success and included his only US top 40 hit &quot;Wake Up (Next to You)&quot;. The Shot was a four-piece backing band, all of whom had played on either &quot;The Real Macaw&quot; or &quot;Another Grey Area&quot;: Brinsley Schwarz (guitar), George Small (keyboards), Kevin Jenkins (bass) and Michael Braun (drums). &quot;Steady Nerves&quot; was recorded in New York City, and Parker began living mostly in the United States during this time.

Record label changes came quickly after the mid-1980s, partly accounting for the number of compilation albums in Graham Parker&#x27;s discography. Particularly unproductive was Parker&#x27;s tenure at Atlantic Records, where he released nothing and signed to RCA Records. He began producing his own recordings and issued &quot;The Mona Lisa&#x27;s Sister&quot;. The backing band for this album included former Rumour-mates Schwarz and Bodnar; keyboardists James Hallawell and Steve Nieve; and drummer Terry Williams (replaced on one cut by Andy Duncan, and two others by Pete Thomas, who, like Nieve, was a member of Elvis Costello and the Attractions). &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked &quot;The Mona Lisa&#x27;s Sister&quot; at No. 97 on its list of The 100 Greatest Albums of the 1980s.

===The 1990s===
Parker continued to record for RCA through the early 1990s. Long-time guitarist Schwarz once again left Parker after the 1989 album &quot;Human Soul&quot;. Parker&#x27;s 1991 offering, &quot;Struck By Lightning&quot;, had Bodnar and Pete Thomas in the backing band, as well as guest appearances from The Band&#x27;s Garth Hudson on keyboards and John Sebastian on autoharp. However, the album&#x27;s chart peak of US No. 131 saw Parker dropped by the label. 1992&#x27;s &quot;Burning Questions&quot; was released by Capitol Records, who promptly dropped him after the album failed to sell.

A 1994 Christmas-themed EP release (&quot;Graham Parker&#x27;s Christmas Cracker&quot;) was issued on Dakota Arts Records, before Parker found a more permanent home on American independent label Razor &amp; Tie. After the personal &quot;12 Haunted Episodes&quot;, and 1996&#x27;s &quot;Acid Bubblegum&quot; (featuring Jimmy Destri of Blondie on keyboards), Parker grew quiet in the late 1990s. However, he continued to play live fairly regularly, often working with backing band The Figgs (who, like The Rumour, when not backing Parker also issue records as a discrete unit).

===To the present===
Parker began a more active period in 2001, with the UK re-release of his early Rumour work, and with his third studio album for Razor &amp; Tie, &quot;Deepcut to Nowhere&quot;. In 2003, he collaborated with Kate Pierson of the B-52&#x27;s and Bill Janovitz of Buffalo Tom to record an album of lesser-known John Lennon/Paul McCartney compositions that had never been recorded by The Beatles. The album, called &quot;From a Window: Lost Songs of Lennon &amp; McCartney&quot;, was credited to &quot;Pierson, Parker, Janovitz&quot;. Also in 2003, Parker contributed a solo acoustic version of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; to the compilation album, &quot;A Fair Forgery of Pink Floyd&quot;.

New solo work continued with 2004&#x27;s &quot;Your Country&quot;, which saw Parker switch labels to Chicago-based indie Bloodshot Records and was co-produced by John Would at Stanley Recording in Venice, California. The album was recorded and mixed in two weeks.

&quot;Songs of No Consequence&quot; was recorded with The Figgs in 2005. A show from the ensuing tour with the Figgs was broadcast on FM radio and released as an album in 2006. In March 2007, a new full-length album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Columbus&quot;, was released.

In addition to his records, Parker published an illustrated science fiction novella, &quot;The Great Trouser Mystery&quot; in 1980. He published a set of short stories, &quot;Carp Fishing on Valium&quot;, in June 2000. His third book, the novel &quot;The Other Life of Brian&quot;, appeared in September 2003.

In early 2011, Parker reunited with all five original members of The Rumour to record a new album, &quot;Three Chords Good&quot;. It was released in November 2012. Music journalist, Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted that the release was &quot;the rare reunion that simultaneously looks back while living in the present.&quot; Meanwhile, the Judd Apatow film &quot;This Is 40&quot;, in which Parker and Rumour play themselves, was released a month later, in December 2012.

The Parker/Rumour reunion continued into 2015, when their new album &quot;Mystery Glue&quot; was issued. It was followed by a short international tour, after which the reunion ended.

In April 2018, Parker signed with 100% Records, and released a brand new single titled &quot;Dreamin&#x27;&quot;. Later, in July 2018, Parker announced &quot;Cloud Symbols&quot;, his brand new studio album to be released on 21 September 2018. The album features Parker&#x27;s brand new backing band The Goldtops, which consists of Martin Belmont on guitar, Geraint Watkins on keyboards, Simon Edwards on bass, and Roy Dodds on drums. The album also features the Rumour Brass, making this their first appearance on a Graham Parker album since &quot;Stick to Me&quot; in 1977 and their first time working with Parker since the Squeezing Out Sparks tour in 1979. The album was initially to be produced by Neil Brockbank, but he died during the recording of the album and production duties for the rest of the album were passed onto Tuck Nelson and Parker himself.

He announced a solo, acoustic 40th Anniversary version of &quot;Squeezing Out Sparks&quot;, for an 13 April 2019 release. It also contains the non-album single, &quot;Mercury Poisoning&quot;.

In September 2023, Graham Parker &amp; the Goldtops released a new studio album &quot;Last Chance to Learn the Twist&quot;. The Goldtops lineup now included drummer Jim Russell in place of Roy Dodds.

<text>Richard Busby (; 22 September 1606 – 6 April 1695) was an English Anglican priest who served as head master of Westminster School for more than fifty-five years. Among the more illustrious of his pupils were Christopher Wren, Robert Hooke, Robert South, John Dryden, John Locke, Matthew Prior, Henry Purcell, Thomas Millington and Francis Atterbury.

==Early life and education==
Busby was born at Lutton in Lincolnshire, and educated at Westminster, where he first showed his academic promise by gaining a King&#x27;s Scholarship. From Westminster, Busby duly proceeded to Christ Church, Oxford, graduating in 1628. In his thirty-third year he had already become renowned for the obstinate zeal with which he supported the falling dynasty of the Stuarts, and was rewarded for his services with the prebend and rectory of Cudworth, with the chapel of Knowle annexed, in Somerset.

==Career at Westminster==

In 1638, Busby became headmaster of Westminster, where his reputation as a teacher was soon established. Dr. Busby prayed publicly for King Charles I on the morning of his execution nearby, but remained in office throughout the political changes of the Commonwealth and the Restoration. Despite his unapologetic royalism, a popular anecdote held that one day the school was visited by Charles II and Busby refused to doff his hat to the king, explaining that if the boys saw him doing so, it might lead them to believe there was &quot;a greater man on earth than himself.&quot;

As a headmaster, Busby was as famous for liberally administering corporal punishment as he was for his abilities as a teacher and mentor. Though it was said he once boasted of having birched sixteen of the bishops on the bench, many of his students would later speak affectionately of the role he played in their education. The nonconformist Anglican priest Philip Henry attributed his strong religious convictions to Busby&#x27;s lessons and recalled being flogged as a student only once, and &quot;deservedly&quot;, for lying. John Dryden dedicated his translation of the Fifth Satire of Persius to Busby in fond memory of his days at Westminster and sent his two sons to study under Busby as well. In the next century, however, Busby&#x27;s reputation as a disciplinarian had eclipsed that of his scholarship and pedagogy. Alexander Pope satirised Busby in the 1743 edition of &quot;The Dunciad&quot;. The ghost of Busby comes forward, carrying a birch rod &quot;dripping with Infants&#x27; blood, and Mothers&#x27; tears&quot; (&quot;The Greater Dunciad&quot; IV 142) and proclaims the virtues of rote memorisation for placing a &quot;jingling padlock&quot; on the mind.

Busby built and stocked a library that is still the classroom of the School&#x27;s Head of Classics, and he wrote and edited many works for the use of his scholars. His original treatises (the best of which are his Greek and Latin grammars), as well as those he edited, remained in use for centuries. Busby also knew Arabic and Hebrew and wrote grammars in those languages for use in the school, though he does not appear to have published them.

Busby died, still in office, aged 88. Sir Charles Lyttelton relates an old story, that &quot;ye people in ye street, when he was expiring, saw flashes and sparks 
of fire come out of his window, which made them run into ye house to put it out, but when they were there saw none, nor did they of ye house.&quot; He is buried in Westminster Abbey, where his memorial by the sculptor Francis Bird is located in the south transept of the building. 

He left his considerable fortune to various charitable causes, and the Busby Trustees still administer his wishes.

<text>In New Zealand, the United States, the United Kingdom, and elsewhere, a beanie is a head-hugging brimless cap, sometimes made from triangular panels of material joined by a button at the crown and seamed together around the sides. Beanies may be made of cloth, felt, wool, leather, or silk. In many US regions and parts of Canada the term &quot;beanie&quot; refers to a knitted cap (often woolen), alternately called a &quot;stocking cap&quot; or (especially in Canada) a &quot;toque&quot;.

== Styles ==

One popular style of the beanie during the early half of the twentieth century was a kind of skullcap made of four or six felt panels sewn together to form the cap. The panels were often composed of two or more different contrasting colors to give them a novel and distinctive look. This type of beanie was also very popular with some colleges and fraternities, as they would often use school colors in the different panels making up the headgear.

Another style of beanie was the whoopee cap, a formed and pressed wool felted hat, with a flipped-up brim that formed a band around the bottom of the cap. The band would often have a decorative repeating zig-zag or scalloped pattern cut around the edge. This gives the whoopee cap the appearance of a silly-looking crown made of fabric, or yarn that has been knit or crocheted instead of precious metals like gold, silver, platinum, and so on. It was also quite common for schoolboys to adorn these styles of beanies with buttons and pins.

== Etymology ==
According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the etymology is uncertain, but probably derives from the slang term &quot;bean&quot;, meaning &quot;head&quot;. In New Zealand and Australia, the term &quot;beanie&quot; is normally applied to a knit cap known as a toque in Canada and parts of the US, but also may apply to the kind of skull cap historically worn by surf lifesavers and still worn during surf sports. The non-knitted variety is normally called a &quot;cap&quot; in other countries.

Other explanations have referred to the cloth-covered button on the crown, which is about the size of a bean. Some academics believe that the term is instead derived from a type of headgear worn in some medieval universities. The yellow hats (&quot;bejaunus&quot;, meaning &quot;yellowbill&quot;, later &quot;beanus&quot;, a term used for both the hats and the new students) evolved into the college beanies of later years.
In the United Kingdom, the term &quot;Benny hat&quot; may also refer to a knitted style of head-covering. This name originally comes from the character &quot;Benny&quot;, played by actor Paul Henry in the British &quot;Crossroads&quot; soap opera. The character appeared from the mid-1970s to the late 1980s and usually wore a knitted version of the hat.

== History ==

Recording of beanies have been traced back to 15th-century Britain and may have coincided to the introduction knitting in the 15th century, however, more likely would have been weaved using a loom as this was a more common method. 

A larger variant of the skullcap, the beanie was working apparel associated with blue-collar laborers, including welders, mechanics, and other tradesmen who needed to keep their hair back, but for whom a brim would be an unnecessary obstruction. Beanies do sometimes have a very small brim, less than an inch deep, around the brow front. The baseball cap evolved from this kind of beanie, with the addition of a visor to block the sun.

By the mid-1940s, beanies fell out of general popularity as a hat, in favor of cotton visored caps like the baseball cap. However, in the 1950s and possibly beyond, they were worn by college freshmen and various fraternity initiates as a form of mild hazing. For example, Lehigh University required freshmen to wear beanies, or &quot;dinks&quot;, and other colleges including Franklin &amp; Marshall, Gettysburg, Rutgers, Westminster College, and others may have had similar practices. Benedictine College, in Atchison, Kansas, still carries this tradition for the first week of a freshman&#x27;s classes, and is said to be the only college in the US to maintain this tradition. Georgia Tech continues to provide freshmen with RAT caps, though their mandatory wear ceased in the 1960s. Wilson College continues this tradition today as a part of its Odd/Even class year &quot;rivalry&quot;.

At Cornell University, freshman beanies (known as &quot;dinks&quot;) were worn into the early 1960s. Dinks were not officially required, but their wearing was enforced by student peer pressure. An annual ritual was the burning of the caps in a boisterous bonfire.

==Propeller cap==
In the summer of 1947, while still in high school, science fiction fanzine artist Ray Nelson, per his claim, invented the propeller beanie as part of a &quot;spaceman&quot; costume on a lark with some friends. He later drew it in his cartoons as emblematic shorthand for science fiction fandom. The hat became a fad, seen in media such as &quot;Time for Beanie&quot;, and was sold widely by many manufacturers over the next decade.

The propeller beanie increased in popular use through comics and eventually made its way onto the character of Beany Boy of &quot;Beany and Cecil&quot;. Today, computer-savvy and other technically proficient people are sometimes pejoratively called propellerheads because of the one-time popularity of the propeller beanie.

In the 21st century, propeller beanies are rarely seen on the street and are primarily worn for satirical or comedic purposes. Google offers these to their newly hired employees, &quot;Nooglers&quot;, as part of their onboarding.

In 1996, student hackers placed a giant propeller beanie on the Great Dome at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The scaled-up propeller rotated as the wind drove it like a windmill.

<text>Robert South (4 September 1634 – 8 July 1716) was an English churchman who was known for his combative preaching and his Latin poetry.

==Early life==

He was the son of Robert South, a London merchant, and Elizabeth Berry. He was born at Hackney, Middlesex, and was educated at Westminster School under Richard Busby, and at Christ Church, Oxford, matriculating on 11 December 1651.

Among his college exercises was a panegyric on Oliver Cromwell in Latin verse on the conclusion of peace at the end of the First Anglo-Dutch War (5 April 1654). He commenced B.A. on 24 February 1654–5. On account of his using the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; John Owen, then Dean of Christ Church and vice-chancellor, unsuccessfully opposed his proceeding M.A. on 12 June 1657. South travelled on the continent, and in 1658 privately received episcopal ordination, perhaps from Thomas Sydserf. He was incorporated M.A. at Cambridge in 1659. His assize sermon at St. Mary&#x27;s on 24 July 1659 was an attack on the Independents, with a sample of the humour for which South became famous. In his university sermon on 29 July 1660 he included the Presbyterians in his invective, referring to Henry Wilkinson as &#x27;Holderforth.&#x27;

==Under Charles II==
He was chosen public orator to the university on 10 August 1660, an office which he held till 1677. Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon made him his chaplain, in consequence of his oration on his installation as chancellor (15 November). On 30 March 1663 he was installed prebendary of Westminster. On 1 Oct. 1663 he was created B.D. and D.D. on letters from Clarendon. The creation was opposed in convocation by those who reckoned South a time-server. On a scrutiny, Nathaniel Crew, the senior proctor, declared the majority to be for South, who was presented by John Wallis. He was incorporated D.D. at Cambridge in 1664. Clarendon gave him in 1667 the sinecure rectory of Llanrhaiadr-y-Mochnant, Denbighshire, and on Clarendon&#x27;s fall, at the end of that year, he became chaplain to James, Duke of York.

South&#x27;s ridicule of the Royal Society, in an oration at the dedication of the Sheldonian Theatre, July 1669, called forth a remonstrance from Wallis, addressed to Robert Boyle. South was installed canon of Christ Church on 29 Dec. 1670.

A zealous advocate of the doctrine of passive obedience, he strongly opposed the Toleration Act, declaiming in unmeasured terms against the various Nonconformist sects. In 1676 he was appointed chaplain to Lawrence Hyde, Earl of Rochester, ambassador-extraordinary to the king of Poland, and he sent an account of his visit to Edward Pococke in a letter, dated Dantzic, 16 December 1677, which was printed along with South&#x27;s &quot;Posthumous Works&quot; in 1717. In 1678 he was presented to the rectory of Islip, Oxfordshire.

He lived at Caversham, near Reading, Berkshire, where he had an estate. South was chaplain in ordinary to Charles II, but had no other preferment from him than the Westminster prebend.

==Under James II==
In James II&#x27;s reign Rochester, then lord-lieutenant of Ireland, is said to have offered South an Irish archbishopric (Cashel was vacant, 1685–91). Rochester nominated South (November 1686) as one of two Anglican divines to discuss points of doctrine with two of the church of Rome; but James objected to South, and Simon Patrick was substituted.

==Under William and Mary==
At the Glorious Revolution South hesitated to transfer his allegiance, being, according to White Kennett, under the influence of William Sherlock, D.D. He at length took the oath, adopting the parliamentary fiction that James&#x27;s flight constituted an abdication. He is said to have declined a bishopric vacated by a nonjuror. He opposed the scheme for a comprehension of dissenters, but was not a member either of the royal commission (13 September 1689) on the subject, or of the convocation of that year.

In 1693 South intervened anonymously in the Socinian controversy, with strong animus against Sherlock, his &quot;Animadversions on Dr Sherlock&#x27;s Book, entitled a Vindication of the Holy and Ever Blessed Trinity&quot; (1690) being &#x27;humbly offered to his admirers, and to himself the chief of them.&#x27; He made galling references to Sherlock&#x27;s career, &#x27;tainted with a conventicle&#x27; at the outset; vehemently assailed his earlier writings as heterodox on the doctrine of atonement, and maintained his &#x27;new notion&#x27; of the Trinity to be tritheistic; an opinion reiterated in his &quot;&quot;Tritheism Charged upon Dr Sherlock&#x27;s New Notion of the Trinity, and the Charge Made Good&quot; (1695). The anonymity of these attacks was transparent. It is not certain that South was the translator of &quot;A Short History of Valentinus Gentilis the Tritheist&quot; (1696) from the Latin of Benedict Aretius; the dedication to the hierarchy is in his manner, and there is a reference to Gentilis in &quot;Tritheism Charged&quot;. p. 47. South&#x27;s position is mainly that of Wallis, but he chiefly devotes his learning to demolishing Sherlock. Public judgment on the controversy was expressed in William Pittis&#x27;s ballad, &#x27;The Battle Royal&#x27;. The controversy was carried into the pulpit, and made for such sharp feelings that the king interposed to stop it.

==Under Queen Anne==

During the greater part of the reign of Anne South remained comparatively quiet; his health was broken. He roused himself in 1710 to take part on the High Church side in the affair of Henry Sacheverell. On the death (20 May 1713) of Thomas Sprat the bishopric of Rochester and deanery of Westminster were offered to him; but he turned them down. He died at Westminster on 8 July 1716, and was buried in Westminster Abbey. South gave orders that his ashes should rest near those of Richard Busby. At the south wall of the sanctuary stands a large monument of white marble with a reclining figure, right arm on a cushion, and hand on a skull, and a closed book in the left. The background is framed by two fluted Corinthian column, on either side of an inscription tablet, surmounted by a glory, and two cherubs on drapery. On the cornice is an armorial cartouche decorated with floral festoons, between two flaming urns.

==Works==
He published a large number of sermons, and they appeared in a collected form in 1692 in six volumes, reaching a second edition in his lifetime in 1715. There have been several later issues; one in two volumes, with a memoir (Henry George Bohn, 1845).

His &quot;Opera posthuma Latina&quot;, including his will, his Latin poems (among them the at South&#x27;s time well-known witty poem &quot;Musica incantans&quot; about the power of music), and his orations while public orator, with memoirs of his life, appeared in 1717. An edition of his works in 7 vols. was published at Oxford in 1823, another in 5 vols in 1842.

He was praised for his wit, though Mark Noble wrote that once, whilst giving a sermon to Charles II, he observed the entire congregation had gone to sleep - Noble remarks that, &quot;Stopping and changing the tone of his voice, he called thrice to Lord Lauderdale, who, awakened, stood up: &quot;My Lord&quot; says South very composedly &quot;I am sorry to interrupt your repose, but I must beg that you will not snore quite so loud, lest you should awaken his majesty&quot;, and then as calmly continued his discourse.&quot;

<text>Croydon is a large town in South London, England, south of Charing Cross. Part of the London Borough of Croydon, a local government district of Greater London; it is one of the largest commercial districts in Greater London, with an extensive shopping area. The entire town had a population of 192,064 as of 2011, whilst the wider borough had a population of 384,837.

Historically an ancient parish in the Wallington Hundred of Surrey, at the time of the Norman conquest of England Croydon had a church, a mill, and around 365 inhabitants, as recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086. Croydon expanded in the Middle Ages as a market town and a centre for charcoal production, leather tanning and brewing, with the brewing industry in particular remaining strong for hundreds of years. The Surrey Iron Railway from Croydon to Wandsworth opened in 1803 and was an early public railway. Later 19th century railway building facilitated Croydon&#x27;s growth as a commuter town for London. By the early 20th century, Croydon was an important industrial area, known for car manufacture, metal working and Croydon Airport. In the mid 20th century these sectors were replaced by retailing and the service economy, brought about by massive redevelopment which saw the rise of office blocks and the Whitgift Centre, the largest shopping centre in Greater London until 2008. Historically, the town formed part of the County of Surrey, and between 1889 and 1965 a county borough, but it was amalgamated into Greater London in 1965.

Croydon lies on a transport corridor between central London and the south coast of England, to the north of two high gaps in the North Downs, one taken by the A23 Brighton Road and the main railway line through Purley and Merstham and the other by the A22 from Purley to the M25 Godstone interchange. Road traffic is diverted away from a largely pedestrianised town centre, mostly consisting of North End. East Croydon railway station is a hub of the national railway system, with frequent fast services to central London, Brighton and the south coast. The town is also at the centre of the only tramway system in Southern England.

==History==
===Toponymy===
As the vast majority of place names in the area are of Anglo-Saxon origin, the theory accepted by most philologists is that the name Croydon derives originally from the Old English &quot;croh&quot;, meaning &quot;crocus&quot;, and &quot;denu&quot;, &quot;valley&quot;, indicating that, like Saffron Walden in Essex, it was a centre for the cultivation of saffron. It has been argued that this cultivation is likely to have taken place in the Roman period, when the saffron crocus would have been grown to supply the London market, most probably for medicinal purposes, and particularly for the treatment of granulation of the eyelids.

One claim, originally made by Andrew Coltee Ducarel, that John Corbet Anderson challenged, said that the name came from the Old French for &quot;chalk hill&quot;, because it was in use at least a century before the French language would have been commonly used following the Norman Conquest. However, there was no long-term Danish occupation (see Danelaw) in Surrey, which was part of Wessex, and Danish-derived nomenclature is also highly unlikely. More recently, David Bird has speculated that the name might derive from a personal name, &quot;Crocus&quot;: he suggests a family connection with the documented Chrocus, king of the Alemanni, who allegedly played a part in the proclamation of Constantine as emperor at York in AD 306.

An alternative, although less probable, theories of the name&#x27;s origin have been proposed. According to Anderson:The earliest mention of Croydon is in the joint will of Beorhtric and Aelfswth, dated about the year 962. In this Anglo-Saxon document the name is spelt [here he uses Old English characters] &quot;Crogdaene&quot;. Crog was, and still is, the Norse or Danish word for crooked, which is expressed in Anglo-Saxon by &quot;crumb&quot;, a totally different word. From the Danish came our &quot;crook&quot; and &quot;crooked&quot;. This term accurately describes the locality; it is a &quot;crooked&quot; or &quot;winding valley&quot;, in reference to the valley that runs in an oblique and serpentine course from Godstone to Croydon.

===Early history===
The town lies on the line of the Roman road from London to Portslade, and there is some archaeological evidence for small-scale Roman settlement in the area: there may have been a &quot;mansio&quot; (staging-post) here. Later, in the 5th to 7th centuries, a large pagan Saxon cemetery was situated on what is now Park Lane, although the extent of any associated settlement is unknown.

By the late Saxon period Croydon was the hub of an estate belonging to the Archbishops of Canterbury. The church and the archbishops&#x27; manor house were situated in the area still known as &quot;Old Town&quot;. The archbishops used the manor house as an occasional place of residence: as lords of the manor they dominated the life of the town well into the early modern period, and as local patrons they continue to have an influence. Croydon appears in Domesday Book (1086) as &quot;Croindene&quot;, held by Archbishop Lanfranc. Its Domesday assets included 16 hides and 1 virgate of land; a church; a mill worth 5s; 38 plough-teams; of meadow; and woodland for 200 hogs. It had a recorded population of 73 households (representing roughly 365 individuals); and its value in terms of taxes rendered was £37 10s 0d.

The church had been established in the middle Saxon period, and was probably a minster church, a base for a group of clergy living a communal life. A charter issued by King Coenwulf of Mercia refers to a council that had taken place close to the &quot;monasterium&quot; (meaning minster) of Croydon. An Anglo-Saxon will made in about 960 is witnessed by Elfsies, priest of Croydon; and the church is also mentioned in Domesday Book. The will of John de Croydon, fishmonger, dated 6 December 1347, includes a bequest to &quot;the church of S John de Croydon&quot;, the earliest clear record of its dedication. The church still bears the arms of Archbishop Courtenay and Archbishop Chichele, believed to have been its benefactors.
In 1276 Archbishop Robert Kilwardby acquired a charter for a weekly market, and this probably marks the foundation of Croydon as an urban centre. Croydon developed into one of the main market towns of north-east Surrey. The market place was laid out on the higher ground to the east of the manor house in the triangle now bounded by High Street, Surrey Street and Crown Hill. By the 16th century the manor house had become a substantial palace, used as the main summer home of the archbishops and visited by monarchs and other dignitaries. However, the palace gradually became dilapidated and surrounded by slums and stagnant ponds, and in 1781 the archbishops sold it, and in its place purchased a new residence at nearby Addington. Nevertheless, many of the buildings of the original Croydon Palace survive, and are in use today as Old Palace School.

The Parish Church (now Croydon Minster) is a Perpendicular-style church, which was remodelled in 1849 but destroyed in a great fire in 1867, after which only the tower, south porch, and outer walls remained. A new church was designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott, one of the greatest architects of the Victorian age, and opened in 1870. His design loosely followed the previous layout, with knapped flint facing and many of the original features, including several tombs. Croydon Parish Church is the burial place of six Archbishops of Canterbury: John Whitgift, Edmund Grindal, Gilbert Sheldon, William Wake, John Potter and Thomas Herring. Historically part of the Diocese of Canterbury, Croydon is now in the Diocese of Southwark. In addition to the suffragan Bishop of Croydon, the Vicar of Croydon is a preferment.


Addington Palace is a Palladian-style mansion between Addington Village and Shirley, in the London Borough of Croydon. Six archbishops lived there between 1807 and 1898, when it was sold. Between 1953 and 1996 it was the home of the Royal School of Church Music. It is now a conference and banqueting venue.

Croydon was home to the Addiscombe Military Seminary (1809–1861), at which young officers were trained for the army of the East India Company.

Croydon was a leisure destination in the mid 19th century. In 1831, one of England&#x27;s most prominent architects, Decimus Burton, designed a spa and pleasure gardens below Beulah Hill and off what is now Spa Hill in a bowl of land on the south-facing side of the hill around a spring of chalybeate water. Burton was responsible for the Beulah Spa Hotel (demolished around 1935) and the layout of the grounds. Its official title was The Royal Beulah Spa and Gardens. It became a popular society venue attracting crowds to its &quot;fêtes&quot;. One widely publicised event was a &quot;Grand Scottish Fete&quot; on 16 September 1834 &quot;with a tightrope performance by Pablo Fanque, the black circus performer who would later dominate the Victorian circus and achieve immortality in the Beatles song, &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!&quot;&quot; The spa closed in 1856 soon after the opening nearby of the Crystal Palace which had been rebuilt on Sydenham Hill in 1854, following its success at the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park.

Horse racing in the area took place occasionally, notably during visits of Queen Elizabeth I to the archbishop. Regular meetings became established first on a course at Park Hill in 1860 and from 1866 at Woodside, where particularly good prizes were offered for the races run under National Hunt rules. In that sphere its prestige was second only to Aintree, home of the Grand National. Increasing local opposition to the presence of allegedly unruly racegoers coupled with the need to obtain a licence from the local authority led to it being closed down in 1890.
The Elizabethan Whitgift Almshouses, the &quot;Hospital of the Holy Trinity&quot;, in the centre of Croydon at the corner of North End and George Street, were erected by Archbishop John Whitgift. He petitioned for and received permission from Queen Elizabeth I to establish a hospital and school in Croydon for the &quot;poor, needy and impotent people&quot; from the parishes of Croydon and Lambeth. The foundation stone was laid in 1596 and the building was completed in 1599.

The premises included the Hospital or Almshouses, providing accommodation for between 28 and 40 people, and a nearby schoolhouse and schoolmaster&#x27;s house. There was a Warden in charge of the well-being of the almoners. The building takes the form of a courtyard surrounded by the chambers of the almoners and various offices.

Threatened by various reconstruction plans and road-widening schemes, the Almshouses were saved in 1923 by intervention of the House of Lords. On 21 June 1983, Queen Elizabeth II visited the Almshouses and unveiled a plaque celebrating the recently completed reconstruction of the building. On 22 March each year the laying of the foundation stone is commemorated as Founder&#x27;s Day.

In 1864, the Catholic St Mary&#x27;s Church in Croydon was opened. It was designed by E. W. Pugin and Frederick Walters in the Gothic Revival style. The Grade II listed West Croydon Baptist Church was built in 1873 by J. Theodore Barker. It is a red brick building with stone dressings. Its three bays are divided by paired Doric pilasters supporting a triglyph frieze and panelled parapet. The Parish Church of St Michael and All Angels by John Loughborough Pearson in West Croydon was built between 1880 and 1885, and is Grade I listed.

===Industrial Revolution and the railway===

The development of Brighton as a fashionable resort in the 1780s increased Croydon&#x27;s importance as a halt for stage coaches on the road south of London. At the beginning of the 19th century, Croydon became the terminus of two pioneering commercial transport links with London. The first, opened in 1803, was the horse-drawn Surrey Iron Railway from Wandsworth, which in 1805 was extended to Merstham, as the Croydon, Merstham and Godstone Railway. The second, opened in 1809, was the Croydon Canal, which branched off the Grand Surrey Canal at Deptford. The London and Croydon Railway (an atmospheric and steam-powered railway) opened between London Bridge and West Croydon in 1839, using much of the route of the canal (which had closed in 1836). Other connections to London and the south followed.

The arrival of the railways and other communications advances in the 19th century led to a 23-fold increase in Croydon&#x27;s population between 1801 and 1901. This rapid expansion of the town led to considerable health problems, especially in the damp and overcrowded working class district of Old Town. In response to this, in 1849 Croydon became one of the first towns in the country to acquire a local board of health. The Board constructed public health infrastructure including a reservoir, water supply network, sewers, a pumping station and sewage disposal works. The Surrey Street Pumping Station is Grade II listed; it was built in four phases. starting with the engine house in 1851, with a further engine house in 1862, a further extension in 1876–7 to house a compound horizontal engine and a further extension in 1912.

=== A growing town ===

In 1883 Croydon was incorporated as a borough. In 1889 it became a county borough, with a greater degree of autonomy. The new county borough council implemented the Croydon Improvement scheme in the early 1890s, which widened the High Street and cleared much of the &quot;Middle Row&quot; slum area. The remaining slums were cleared shortly after Second World War, with much of the population relocated to the isolated new settlement of New Addington. New stores opened and expanded in central Croydon, including Allders, Kennards and Grade II listed Grants, as well as the first Sainsbury&#x27;s self-service shop in the country. There was a market on Surrey Street.

Croydon was the location of London&#x27;s main airport until the Second World War. During the war, much of central Croydon was devastated by German V-1 flying bombs and V-2 rockets, and for many years the town bore the scars of the destruction. After the war, Heathrow Airport superseded Croydon Airport as London&#x27;s main airport, and Croydon Airport quickly went into a decline, finally closing in 1959.

By the 1950s, with its continuing growth, the town was becoming congested, and the Council decided on another major redevelopment scheme. The Croydon Corporation Act was passed in 1956. This, coupled with national government incentives for office relocation out of Central London, led to the building of new offices and accompanying road schemes through the late 1950s and 1960s, and the town boomed as a business centre in the 1960s, with many multi-storey office blocks, an underpass, a flyover and multi-storey car parks. The redeveloped town centre has since been identified as an &quot;edge city&quot; – a significant urban and commercial centre in its own right, located on the outskirts of a larger metropolitan area (in this case, London).

In 1960 Croydon celebrated its millennium with a pageant held at Lloyd Park and an exhibition held at the old Croydon Aerodrome.

===Modern Croydon===

The growing town attracted many new buildings. The Fairfield Halls arts centre and event venue opened in 1962. Croydon developed as an important centre for shopping, with the construction of the Whitgift Centre in 1969. No. 1 Croydon (formerly the NLA Tower) designed by Richard Seifert &amp; Partners was completed in 1970. The Warehouse Theatre opened in 1977.

The 1990s saw further changes intended to give the town a more attractive image. These included the closure of North End to vehicles in 1989 and the opening of the Croydon Clocktower arts centre in 1994. An early success of the centre was the &quot;Picasso&#x27;s Croydon Period&quot; exhibition of March–May 1995.

The Croydon Tramlink began operation in May 2000 (see Transport section below).

The Prospect West office development was built in 1991 to 1992, and its remodelling planned in 2012 has now been completed. Renamed Interchange Croydon when it was reopened in 2014, the 180,000 square foot office development was the first new grade A office development of its size to open in Croydon for more than 20 years.

Another large shopping centre, Centrale, opened in 2004 opposite the Whitgift Centre, and adjoining the smaller Drummond Centre. House of Fraser and Debenhams are the anchor stores in the combined centre. In addition, there are plans for a large, new one billion pound shopping centre, in the form of a new Westfield shopping mall to add to the two which the company currently has in Greater London; Westfield plans to work jointly with Hammerson and to incorporate the best aspects of the two companies&#x27; designs. In November 2017, Croydon Council gave permission for the new Westfield shopping centre to be built and in January 2018, the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, approved the regeneration scheme. Work to demolish the existing Whitgift Centre was due to begin in 2018 and Westfield Croydon was initially to open by 2022. The Westfield plans were delayed and the planning permission elapsed: however, in 2021, Croydon Council confirmed they were committed to see the Westfield Centre proceed. There are several other major plans for the town including the redevelopment of the Croydon Gateway site; and extensions of Tramlink to Purley Way, Streatham, Lewisham and Crystal Palace.
Croydon has many tall buildings such as the former Nestlé Tower (St George&#x27;s House). The London Borough of Croydon&#x27;s strategic planning committee in February 2013 gave the go-ahead to property fund manager Legal and General Property&#x27;s plans to convert the empty 24-storey St George&#x27;s House office building, occupied by Nestlé until September 2012, into 288 flats.

In 2007, events were held under the label of Croydon Exp07 to promote billions of pounds of promised projects, including swimming pools and a library. However, plans for a new shopping centre, to be called Park Place, had already been abandoned amid a scandal about cash for peerages. Also abandoned were plans for an arena near the East Croydon station, after a compulsory purchase order was rejected in 2008 at Cabinet level.

On 22 November 2011, then Mayor of London Boris Johnson announced £23m of additional funding to help redevelop the town at the Develop Croydon Conference.

Several apartment developments, for instance Altitude 25 (completed 2010), have been built in recent years, and several more are being built or planned. The construction of Saffron Square, which includes a 43-storey tower, began on Wellesley Road in 2011 and was completed in 2016. Other developments with towers over 50 floors high have been given planning approval. These include the 54-storey &quot;Menta Tower&quot; in Cherry Orchard Road near East Croydon station, and a 55-storey tower at One Lansdowne Road, on which construction was set to begin in early 2013. The latter is set to be Britain&#x27;s tallest block of flats, including office space, a four-star hotel and a health club.

In May 2012 it was announced that Croydon had been successful in its bid to become one of twelve &quot;Portas Pilot&quot; towns and would receive a share of £1.2m funding to help rejuvenate its central shopping areas.
In November 2013, Central Croydon MP Gavin Barwell gave a presentation at a public meeting on the Croydon regeneration project, detailing various developments underway due to be completed in coming years.

On 26 November 2013, Croydon Council approved a redevelopment of the Town Centre by The Croydon Partnership, a joint venture by the Westfield Group and Hammerson. London Mayor Boris Johnson approved the plan the following day. The &quot;Croydon Advertiser&quot; listed the approval as an &quot;Historic Night for Croydon&quot;.

At Ruskin Square, a Boxpark made of sea containers opened in 2016 as a temporary measure until new buildings are constructed for shops, offices and housing. The &quot;London Evening Standard&quot; said that this and other developments were reviving the town which was in the process of gentrification.

===Future===
A Croydon Vision 2020 plan was drawn up by Croydon Council after a 1999 study by town planning consultants EDAW. The plan includes new office blocks, apartment buildings, shopping centres and other developments, some of which have already been built. More than 2,000 new homes are planned.

A redeveloped Fairfield Halls has been planned to be the linchpin of a cultural quarter encompassing nearby College Green. Plans include an art gallery, a new college, shops and offices, with a multi-storey car park set for demolition to make space for 218 homes.

==Economy==

As of 2011, Croydon&#x27;s annual retail turnover from comparison goods was £353 million, the fifth-highest in Greater London behind the West End, Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, Stratford and Kingston upon Thames. Croydon had as of 2012 of total town centre floorspace, the second highest in Greater London only behind the West End.

Apart from its large central shopping district, Croydon has a number of smaller shopping areas, especially towards the southern end of the town in which are many restaurants. As of 2011, two of Croydon&#x27;s restaurants were listed in &quot;The Good Food Guide&quot;.

In a 2015 study by CACI, Croydon was ranked 12th in the &quot;Hot 100 UK retail locations&quot; with a score of 90%.

The Zotefoams company has its headquarters in Croydon.

==Government==
===Status===
For centuries the area lay within the Wallington hundred, an ancient Anglo-Saxon administrative division of the county of Surrey. In the later Middle Ages – probably from the late 13th century onwards – residents of the town of Croydon, as defined by boundary markers known as the &quot;four crosses&quot;, enjoyed a degree of self-government through a town court or &quot;portmote&quot;, and a form of free tenure of property. These privileges set the area of the town apart from its rural hinterland, where the more usual and more restrictive rules of manorial tenure applied. However, Croydon did not hold any kind of formal borough status.

In 1690, the leading inhabitants petitioned William III and Mary for Croydon to be incorporated as a borough. The application was initially approved, the king authorising the drafting of a charter, but the process was then abruptly halted, apparently through the intervention of Archbishop John Tillotson, who probably feared a threat to his own authority over the town. The application was revived the following year, when Queen Mary again authorised a charter, but once again it was abandoned. A second petition in 1707 was effectively ignored.

Croydon&#x27;s growth in the 19th century brought the issue of incorporation back on to the political agenda, and in 1883 the ancient parish of Croydon, apart from its exclave of Croydon Crook or Selsdon, was created a municipal borough within Surrey. In 1889, because the population was high enough, it was made a county borough, exempt from county administration.

In 1965 (under the terms of the London Government Act 1963) the County Borough of Croydon was abolished and the area was transferred to Greater London and combined with the Coulsdon and Purley Urban District to form the London Borough of Croydon.

The borough has on several occasions sought city status. (This would be a purely honorific change of title, making no practical difference to the borough&#x27;s governance). A draft petition was submitted by the County Borough to the Home Office in 1951, a more formal petition in 1954, and two more applications in 1955 and 1958. When the London Borough was created in 1965, the Council endeavoured to have it styled a City, as was the City of Westminster. Further bids for city status were made in 1977, 1992, 2000, 2002, and 2012. All have failed. The borough&#x27;s predominant argument has always been its size: in 2000 it pointed out that it was &quot;the largest town which does not have the title of City in the whole of Western Europe&quot;. The grounds on which it has been turned down have invariably been that it is (as was stated in 1992) merely &quot;part of the London conurbation, rather than a place with a character and identity of its own&quot;. Undeterred, council representatives have more than once described Croydon as &quot;a city in all but name&quot;. In 2008, Boris Johnson, then Mayor of London, said he would support Croydon being awarded city status.

===Modern governance===
The London Borough of Croydon has a Labour-controlled council with 41 Labour councillors and 29 Conservative councillors elected on 3 May 2018.

==== Since 2024 ====
From 1974 to 2024, Croydon was represented by three MPs. Under the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, Croydon is now covered by four parliamentary constituencies from the 2024 general election: Croydon East, Croydon West, Croydon South and Streatham and Croydon North.

===== Until 2024 =====
Most of the town centre lies within the Addiscombe and Fairfield wards, which form part of the Croydon Central constituency. The rest of the town centre is in the Croham ward, which is part of the Croydon South constituency. These wards are all in the London Borough of Croydon, which is responsible for services along with other agencies such as education, refuse collection, road maintenance, local planning and social care. The Addiscombe ward is currently represented by Labour Councillors . The Fairfield and Croham wards have, by contrast, habitually elected Conservative members. The sitting Member of Parliament for Croydon Central is Sarah Jones, a member of the Labour Party. The sitting Member of Parliament for Croydon South is Chris Philp, a member of the Conservatives. The Member of Parliament for Croydon North is Steve Reed, for the Labour Party.

==Public services==
The territorial police force is the Metropolitan Police. Their Croydon Police Station is on Park Lane opposite the Croydon Flyover.

The statutory fire and rescue service in Croydon is the London Fire Brigade (LFB) who have a fire station in Old Town, with two pumping appliances.

The nearest hospital is Croydon University Hospital (known from 1923 to 2010 as Mayday Hospital) in nearby Thornton Heath, which is part of Croydon Health Services NHS Trust. The London Ambulance Service provides the ambulance service.

==Demography and population==
The town of Croydon includes its neighbourhoods Addiscombe East, Addiscombe West, Bensham Manor,Broad Green, Coulsdon, Crystal Palace and Upper Norwood, Fairfield, Kenley, New Addington North, New Addington South, Norbury and Pollards Hill, Old Coulsdon, Park Hill and Whitgift, Purley and Woodcote, Sanderstead, Selhurst, Selsdon and Addington Village, Selsdon Vale and Forestdale, Shirley North, Shirley South, South Croydon, South Norwood, Thornton Heath, Waddon, West Thornton and Woodside.

Fairfield ward, which is the major ward covering the central town, was ethnically 40% White British, 16% Indian, and 10% Other White in the 2011 UK Census. Religiously, 46% was Christian, 21% irreligious, 13% Hindu and 8% Muslim. The most common household tenure type was either owned or privately rented. The median age was 33. In addition, the Broad Green ward was ethnically 23% White British, 13% Indian, 13% Other Asian, and 11% Black African. About 41% of household tenures were owned, while privately and socially rented each made up 29% each. The median age was 31. The Addiscombe ward was ethnically 45% White British and 10% Other White. Religiously, 52% of the population was Christian, 24% irreligious, 7% Muslim and 6% Hindu. 52% of house tenures were owned. There are 10 other wards that cover Croydon&#x27;s neighbourhoods.

The median house price as of 2014 was £212,998 in Selhurst ward, one of London&#x27;s lowest. The highest in the town was in Sanderstead ward, £392,500. The mean age in 2013 ranged from 32 years in Broad Green and Fieldway wards, to 43.2 years in Selsdon and Ballards ward.

Croydon town centre is near the centre of the borough of Croydon, to the north of the North Downs and the Pilgrims&#x27; Way path. To the north of Croydon are typical London districts, whereas a short distance southeast (such as Coombe and Selsdon) is green, hilly and rural land. To the west are industrial areas, part of which are in the London Borough of Sutton. The southern suburbs are mainly affluent and also hilly.

The town centre is bordered by Waddon immediately southwest of central Croydon. To the west, inside the London Borough of Sutton lies Beddington. To the north are Broad Green, Thornton Heath and Selhurst. To the south lies South Croydon, and going further south are Purley and Sanderstead. To the east lie Addiscombe and Shirley.

Croydon High Street runs from South Croydon up to the point where it meets the street called North End. North End is the main shopping street, while Croydon High Street is the main restaurant quarter.

The High Street is also home to Wrencote House, a Grade II* listed building. Dating from the late 17th or early 18th centuries, and probably built as a merchant&#x27;s house, it has a distinctive &quot;H&quot; plan form over its four floors (including basement and attic storey). External features include a rich red brick facade with black headers, and a heavily carved and enriched wooden eaves cornice.

Wellesley Road on the A212 road forms a north–south axis through the town centre. In line with London Plan policy, there have been a number of proposals to create greater integration between East Croydon station, which lies on one side of the A212, and the town centre of Croydon, which lies on the other side of it. Croydon Vision 2020 aims to tackle this though such solutions as making the road easier for pedestrians to cross by creating a centre island pathway.

Topographically, central Croydon generally lies between (in the north) and (in the south) above sea level. Elevation significantly climbs towards the east of the town – Coombe Park peaks at about above sea level, whereas the Addington Hills, Coombe Wood and Addington Golf Course are as high as , with the southern end of New Addington having an elevation of over . To the south, Croham Hurst has a hill of , and the highest area of Croydon is the Sanderstead Plantation at . The lowest elevation is around Broad Green, about above sea level.

===River Wandle===

The River Wandle is a tributary of the River Thames, flowing some 9 miles (14 km) to Wandsworth and Putney from its source in Croydon. It roughly forms the borough&#x27;s western boundary with the London Borough of Sutton, and for part of its length also forms the boundary between the London Boroughs of Croydon and Lambeth. One of its tributaries rises in Selhurst.

==Culture==
===Arts===

There are several arts venues. Foremost is the Fairfield Halls, opened in 1962, which consists of a large concert hall frequently used for BBC recordings, the Ashcroft Theatre and the Arnhem Gallery. Fairfield is the home of the London Mozart Players. Many famous faces have appeared at the Fairfield Halls, including the Beatles, Bucks Fizz, Omid Djalili, Robert Cray, JLS, Chuck Berry, B. B. King, Don McLean, The Monkees, Johnny Cash, Dionne Warwick, Gladys Knight, Morecambe and Wise, Tom Jones, The Stylistics, Status Quo, Level 42, A-HA, John Mayall, Jools Holland, Kenny Rogers, James Last, and Coolio. The main concert hall was used for the conference scene in the Ron Howard film &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; (2006). The Fairfield Halls reopened in 2019, following a programme of modernisation and refurbishment. Prior to the construction of The Fairfield Halls theatre entertainment was provided by the Theatre Royal (1868–1959) based on the high street on a site previously housing a venue known as &#x27;the theatre&#x27;.
Croydon Clocktower, developed by the London Borough of Croydon in the mid-1990s, houses a state-of-the-art library, a performance venue in the old reference library, the David Lean Cinema (a small, independent, art-house cinema) and the Museum of Croydon, which details Croydon&#x27;s history. The building links into Croydon Town Hall and some areas of the building, most notably the Braithwaite Hall, are part of the original town hall and library complex, built in 1892–1896 to a design by Charles Henman. A bronze statue of Queen Victoria was erected outside the buildings in 1903.

The Warehouse Theatre (which closed in 2012), was a studio theatre known for promoting new writing, comedy and youth theatre. It had to close because of the major Ruskin Square redevelopment, but will re-open in the future in a new larger theatre building within the new development.

The Pembroke Theatre had many productions with well-known actors before its closure in about 1962.

There are several local and small venues for comedy and community events dotted around Croydon and its districts. Croydon Youth Theatre Organisation celebrated its 40th birthday in 2005. There are several community arts groups, particularly in the large Asian community.

The Spread Eagle Theatre is a new 50-seat studio theatre. Opened in October 2013, it is situated in the town centre, 10 minutes&#x27; walk from East Croydon Station. The Spread Eagle works closely with its sister venue, the Old Joint Stock Theatre in Birmingham. Both venues champion &#x27;big plays for small spaces&#x27; with an emphasis on new writing, supporting emerging artists and theatre companies.

A calendar titled &quot;Rare Roundabouts of Croydon&quot;, with a picture of a different Croydon roundabout each month, has enjoyed some success.
===Public art===

About 60 murals were added to Croydon town centre in 2018, as part of the Rise street art festival coordinated by the Rise art gallery in Croydon.

===Literature===
Croydon is the setting of two poems by British Poet Laureate Sir John Betjeman, &quot;Croydon&quot; and &quot;Love in a Valley&quot;.

The borough has been the residence of many renowned authors and novelists, including Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who set up house in Norwood, D.H. Lawrence, and French novelist Émile Zola, who lived for a time in the Queen&#x27;s Hotel, Upper Norwood. Cicely Mary Barker, author and illustrator of the Flower Fairies series of books, was born in Croydon.

Croydon is the setting of novels. The now defunct airport lent itself to the mysteries &quot;The 12.30 from Croydon&quot; and &quot;Death in the Clouds&quot;, and the town is mentioned in some Sherlock Holmes mysteries.

Croydon is referred to in a rhyme dating back to the 18th century, revised in the Victorian era to:

In Jane Austen&#x27;s unfinished novel &quot;The Watsons&quot; (written &quot;c&quot;.1803–1805), the heroine, Emma Watson, has a brother and sister-in-law who live in Croydon, and who urge her to join them for an extended visit. Another sister, Elizabeth, encourages the idea, commenting &quot;there is always something lively going on at Croydon&quot;. It would appear that the plot was intended to continue with Emma moving to Croydon.

===Music===
The composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor (1875–1912) lived at 30 Dagnall Park, Selhurst, until his death. He grew up in Croydon and sang in the church choir at St George&#x27;s and taught at the Crystal Palace School of Music and many other schools of music. He died from pneumonia after collapsing at West Croydon station. There is an impressive grave with a poem at Bandon Hill Cemetery, and exhibits about him in the Museum of Croydon.

Addington Palace housed The Royal School of Church Music from 1953 to 1996.

In addition to the Fairfield Halls, several venues in Croydon have hosted rock acts. Established in 1976, the Cartoon was a popular live music venue that closed in 2006. The Greyhound in Park Lane played host to acts such as Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, The Who, David Bowie, Queen, Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Damned, The Boomtown Rats, A-ha in (1987) and others during the 1960s and &#x27;70s. Mott The Hoople paid tribute to the town&#x27;s music scene in the song Saturday Gigs. The Greyhound also saw the debut of the Electric Light Orchestra in 1972.

In the punk era Croydon had its own scene including bands such as Johnny Moped, which at one point had member Captain Sensible who later released the song &quot;Croydon&quot; in 1982 in tribute to his home town.

Croydon has been at the centre of the development of the dubstep genre, a relatively recent musical development that traces its roots from Jamaican dub music, UK Garage and drum and bass. Artists such as Benga and Skream, who honed their production and DJing skills whilst working at the now defunct &quot;Big Apple Records&quot; on Surrey Street, along with Norwood&#x27;s Digital Mystikz, DJ Chef, Timi Korus and Thornton Heath&#x27;s Plastician, form the core roster of dubstep DJs and producers. Moreover, UK rappers and grime artists Stormzy, Krept and Konan, Nadia Rose and Section Boyz all hail from or can trace their roots to the London Borough of Croydon.

In 1993, &quot;Music Week&quot; reported that Croydon&#x27;s record shops were thriving. The town centre was for 30 years home to Europe&#x27;s largest second-hand record store, Beano&#x27;s, offering rare vinyl, CDs and books. In November 2008, it was announced that Beano&#x27;s would close. The premises, off Church Street near the Grant&#x27;s cinema complex, became a &quot;market place&quot; with stalls for rent by small business and individuals. Another, now closed, record shop was Shake Some Action which specialized in punk records at 100 Church Street.
Continuing Croydon&#x27;s tradition of dubstep record shops, are Reggaemasters, which opened in 2004 on Drummond Road and moved to Frith Road in 2019, and Addiscombe&#x27;s DnR Vinyl, which cites Big Apple Records as its main inspiration. Ten Pin Records opened in Purley in 2022.

The oldest currently surviving shop in Croydon is 46 South End, which is a music shop. Dating back to the 16th century, this Grade II listed building still retains all its original Tudor features. Records show that the premises has been a shop for at least 163 years, where street directories from 1851 give the names of E. C. Johnson &amp; Thorpe.

Croydon is home to the BRIT School for performing arts and technology, based in Selhurst, which has produced stars such as Adele, Jessie J, Amy Winehouse, Leona Lewis, Katie Melua, Katy B, Kate Nash, Imogen Heap, Rizzle Kicks, Dane Bowers and members of the Feeling &amp; the Kooks. Independent of such institutions, Croydon is also the home of artists such as Nosferatu D2, Frankmusik, Noisettes, and Saint Etienne.

Club Soda is a music charity supporting artists with learning disabilities, their artists include The Carbonators. They run a regular club night called Soda Beat.

===Media===
Croydon plays host to the popular Channel 4 show &quot;Peep Show&quot;. The ITV police drama &quot;The Bill&quot;, although set in East London, was filmed in Croydon and many of the town centre locations were filmed around Surrey Street and St George&#x27;s House (the Nestle building). Sun Hill Police Station is in nearby Mitcham. The opening credit sequence for the sitcom &quot;Terry and June&quot; featured the eponymous stars walking around the Whitgift Centre and the Fairfield Halls. In 2007, the music video for pop star Mika&#x27;s single &quot;Big Girl (You Are Beautiful)&quot; was shot in various locations around the town, including High Street and Surrey Street Market. The Delta Point building, close to West Croydon station appeared in the film &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; as Gotham General Hospital. The 2018 interactive film, &quot;Black Mirror: Bandersnatch&quot; featured several scenes shot in Croydon, such as St George&#x27;s Walk and No.1 Croydon.

Croydon has its own fully independent television station: it does not receive any government or local authority grant or funding and is supported by donations, sponsorship and by commercial advertising. In 2012, Croydon Radio, an internet radio station, began in the area.

==Sport and leisure==
===Parks and open spaces===

The borough has many woods for walking in, which together account for 8.5% of Greater London&#x27;s woodland resource (626.46 hectares). These include Lloyd Park and Croham Hurst.

Among several other parks and open spaces around Croydon, there is an area of landscaped green space in the town centre called Queens Gardens; it is adjacent to the town hall and Clocktower art centre.

Croydon holds one of the sources of the River Wandle. The river being a rare chalk stream. The Wandle Trail enables walkers to walk main off-road to London. The Vanguard Way is an off-road walk from Croydon to Newhaven (Britain&#x27;s South Coast) intersecting the London Outer Orbital Path, North Downs Way and the Pilgrims&#x27; Way.

===Clubs and teams===
The most prominent sports club in the borough is Crystal Palace Football Club, based in the north of the borough since 1918. Palace play at the purpose-built stadium of Selhurst Park, which the club moved to in 1924 from the Nest, its first Croydon-based stadium. The Nest had previously been the home of the defunct Croydon Common Football Club and sat next to Selhurst station. Palace won promotion to the Premier League (the top tier of football in England) at the end of the 2012–13 season. Croydon has a Non-League football club, Croydon F.C. who play at Croydon Sports Arena. Sunday League team Purley Saint Germain also play at Croydon Sports Arena.

Streatham-Croydon RFC, founded in 1871, is one of Greater London&#x27;s oldest extant rugby union clubs, playing just north of the town centre at Frant Road in Thornton Heath.

There are a number of field hockey clubs based in and around Croydon that are part of the South East Hockey and the London Hockey league structures.
 Current hockey clubs in and around the area are Addiscombe, Croydon Trinity Whitgiftian, Kenley, Purley, Purley Walcountians and Sanderstead.

Croydon Amphibians SC plays in Division 2 British Waterpolo League. In 2008, the team won the National League Division 3.

The borough also has a women&#x27;s roller derby team called Croydon Roller Derby, which trains in Carshalton. The team was established in the early part of this decade and has played both national and international teams including Roller Derby Madrid, Stuttgart Valley Rollergirlz and Oxford Roller Derby. The sport is full-contact and played on quad skates with players skating round an elliptical track.

==Transport==


===Rail===
====Heavy Rail====
Croydon is served by East Croydon, South Croydon and West Croydon railway stations. East Croydon and South Croydon are served by Govia Thameslink Railway, operating under the Southern and Thameslink brands via the Brighton Main Line. West Croydon is served by London Overground and Southern services. The largest and busiest of the three stations is East Croydon, although West Croydon is located closer to Croydon&#x27;s main shopping district.

====Light Rail====
The Tramlink tram system opened in 2000; Croydon is its hub. Its network consists of two main lines, from Elmers End or Beckenham to Wimbledon, and from New Addington to West Croydon, with all trams running via a loop in central Croydon. It is the only tram system in Greater London. It serves Mitcham, Woodside, Addiscombe and the Purley Way retail and industrial area.

The system was previously known as the &quot;Croydon Tramlink&quot;, having been established under the Croydon Tramlink Act 1994.

===Road===
A few miles to the south of Croydon is a small gap in the North Downs, a route for transport from London to the south coast. The London to Brighton road used to pass through the town on North End before the A23 Purley Way was built to the west. Transport for London operates many bus routes in and around Croydon. Most buses serve West Croydon bus station, next to the railway station and tram stop.

===Croydon&#x27;s early transport links===
The horse-drawn Surrey Iron Railway was an early public railway. It was opened in 1803, had double track, was some long and ran from Wandsworth to Croydon, at what is now Reeves Corner. In 1805 it was extended to Merstham as the Croydon, Merstham, and Godstone Railway. The railway boom of the 1840s brought superior and faster steam lines and it closed in 1846. The route is followed in part by the modern Tramlink. The last remaining sections of rail can be seen behind railings in a corner of Rotary Field in Purley.

With the opening of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway line to London Victoria in 1860 extra platforms were provided at East Croydon, which the LBSCR treated as a separate station named &quot;New Croydon&quot;. The South Eastern Railway (SER) was excluded from this station, which ran exclusively LBSCR services to London at fares cheaper than those the SER offered from the original station. In 1864, the LBSCR obtained authorisation to construct a -mile long branch line into the heart of the town centre near Katharine Street, where Croydon Central station was built. The line opened in 1868 but enjoyed little success and closed in 1871, only to reopen in 1886 under pressure from the Town Council before finally closing in 1890. The station was subsequently demolished and replaced by the Town Hall. In 1897–98, East Croydon and New Croydon were merged into a single station with three island platforms, which remain today, but the two stations kept separate booking accounts until 1924.

The Croydon Canal ran for from what is now West Croydon station. It travelled north largely along the course of the present railway line to New Cross Gate, where it joined the Grand Surrey Canal and went on into the River Thames. It opened in 1809 and had 28 locks. It had a strong competitor in the Surrey Iron Railway and was never a financial success. It sold out to the London &amp; Croydon Railway in 1836. The lake at South Norwood is the former reservoir for the canal.

Croydon Airport on Purley Way was the main airport for London until it was superseded by Heathrow Airport and Gatwick Airport. It opened on 29 March 1920 by combining two smaller airfields used for defence in World War I. It developed into one of the great airports of the world during the 1920s and 1930s. It welcomed the world&#x27;s pioneer aviators in its heyday. As aviation technology progressed and aircraft became larger and more numerous, it was recognised in 1952 that the airport would be too small to cope with increasing air traffic and its role was decreased.. The last scheduled flight departed on 30 September 1959. The air terminal, now known as Airport House adjoining Purley Way to the west of the town, has been restored and has a museum open one day a month. The name &quot;Croydon Airport&quot; is still used as a landmark and as a bus stop designation.

RAF Kenley was another significant airfield during the war years, and now is used for gliding.

==Education==

The town is home to Croydon College, with its main site on Park Lane and College Road near East Croydon station. It has over 13,000 students attending one of its three sub-colleges. The sub-colleges were created in 2007. The three sub-colleges are the Croydon Sixth Form College, Croydon Skills and Enterprise College and the Croydon Higher Education College. The Higher Education College offers university-level education in a range of subjects from Law through to Fine Art. Croydon Skills and Enterprise College delivers training and education opportunities.
The town has several fee-paying schools, three of which are part of the Whitgift Foundation. Two are boys&#x27; schools (though Trinity School has a co-educational sixth form): Whitgift School was situated near the Almshouses until 1931 when it moved to its current site in Haling Park in South Croydon, the Middle School (renamed Trinity School of John Whitgift in 1954) remained on the site until 1965 when it moved to Shirley Park. A direct grant grammar school until 1968, it is now a member of the Headmasters&#x27; Conference. Old Palace School, an independent girls&#x27; school situated in the old Summer Palace of the Archbishops of Canterbury, joined the Whitgift Foundation group of schools in 1993. Croham Hurst School, an independent girls&#x27; school in South Croydon, became part of Old Palace in 2007 and its old buildings are now used as the Old Palace junior school. The site of the old Whitgift grammar school is now the Whitgift shopping centre whose freehold is owned by the Whitgift Foundation. Croydon High School is an independent (fee paying) girls&#x27; school in Selsdon, and a member of the Girls&#x27; Day School Trust. Royal Russell School is a co-educational independent (fee paying) boarding and day school in South Croydon and is a member of the Headmasters&#x27; Conference.

Croydon is also home to three single-sex Catholic state schools. The formerly independent John Fisher School in Purley has not charged fees since the late 1970s, but during the 1990s was selective, choosing boys via exams, interviews, tests, previous school reports and written statements. The school ended its selection policy in 1999, and now accepts pupils under a points system, which favours those who have high mass attendance. Coloma Convent Girls&#x27; School is a Catholic girls&#x27; school formerly a grammar school, it has now, like John Fisher, adopted points-based admission criteria. St Joseph&#x27;s College, on Beulah Hill in Upper Norwood, is a boys&#x27; school with a mixed sixth form. Thomas More is a Catholic mixed state school.

<text>William Sherlock (c. 1639/1641June 19, 1707) was an English church leader.

==Life==
He was born at Southwark, the son of a tradesman, and was educated at St Saviour&#x27;s Grammar School and Eton, and then at Peterhouse, Cambridge. In 1669 he became rector of St George&#x27;s, Botolph Lane, London, and in 1681, he was appointed a prebendary of St Paul&#x27;s. In 1684 he was made Master of the Temple.

In 1686, he was reproved for his antipapal preaching and his controversy with the king&#x27;s chaplain, Lewis Sabran; his pension was stopped. After the Glorious Revolution, he was suspended for refusing the oaths to William III and Mary II but yielded before losing his position.

He became Dean of St Paul&#x27;s in 1691.

About this time he became involved in the Socinian controversy over Unitarian ideas. In 1690 and 1693, he published works on the doctrine of the Trinity, which ironically helped rather than injured the Socinian cause and involved him in a controversy with Robert South and others. His doctrine was even condemned as heretical at Oxford University. Sherlock defended himself in &quot;The Distinction...&quot; and &quot;Present State...&quot; (both 1696), which however practically gave up on the positions that had been impugned.

He died at Hampstead in 1707. By his wife, Elizabeth (née Gardner), he was the father of Bishop Thomas Sherlock.

==Works==
* &quot;The Knowledge of Jesus Christ and Union with Him&quot; (1674), which showed his tendencies toward controversy by an attack on Puritan theologian John Owen.
* &quot;A Practical Discourse of Religious Assemblies&quot; (1681)
* &quot;The Case of Resistance of the Supreme Powers Stated and Resolved According to the Doctrine of the Holy Scriptures&quot; (1684), which drew the distinction between active and passive obedience, and was generally accepted by the High Church clergy.
* &quot;The Protestant Resolution of Faith&quot; (pamphlet) (1687)
* &quot;A Preservative Against Popery: Being Some Plain Directions to Unlearned Protestants, How to Dispute With Romish Priests.&quot; (1688)
* &quot;A Practical Discourse Concerning Death&quot; (1689), written during the period of his suspension, which became very popular.
* &quot;A Vindication of the Doctrine of the Holy and Ever Blessed Trinity&quot; (1690), in response to Socinianism.
* &quot;The Case of the Allegiance Due to Sovereign Powers Stated and Resolved According to Scripture and Reason and the Principles of the Church of England&quot; (1691), justifying his change of attitude toward William and Mary.
* &quot;A Discourse Concerning the Divine Providence&quot; (1694)
* &quot;The Distinction Between Real and Nominal Trinitarians Examined, and the Doctrine of a Real Trinity Vindicated From the Charge of Tritheism&quot; (1696)
* &quot;A modest examination of the authority and reasons of the late decree of the vice-chancellor of Oxford, and some heads of colleges and halls: concerning the heresy of three distinct infinite minds in the Holy and Ever-blessed Trinity&quot; (1696)
* &quot;Present State of the Socinian Controversy’&#x27; (1696/1698)
* &quot;A Discourse Concerning the Happiness of Good Men, and the Punishment of the Wicked, in the Next World, &amp;C.&quot;
* &quot;A Practical Discourse Concerning a Future Judgment.&quot;

His sermons, collected in two volumes, went through several editions.

<doc id="491653" wikidata="Q1883090" url="?curid=491653" title="Chef!">
<text>Chef! is a British situation comedy starring Lenny Henry that aired as twenty episodes over three series from 28 January 1993 to 30 December 1996 on the BBC. The show was created and primarily written by Peter Tilbury based on an idea from Lenny Henry and produced for the BBC by Henry&#x27;s production company, Crucial Films.

==Plot==
Henry starred as Gareth Blackstock, a talented, arrogant, tyrannical and obsessed chef who has endlessly inventive insults for his staff, unknowing customers, and almost anyone else he encounters. Chef Blackstock&#x27;s traditional French cuisine with an eclectic flair is served at &quot;Le Château Anglais,&quot; a gourmet restaurant in the English countryside that is one of the few in the United Kingdom to receive a two-star rating from Michelin. The chef&#x27;s quest for perfection and his lack of awareness about the costs of that perfection mean that the restaurant is on the brink of financial collapse when he and his wife Janice (played by Caroline Lee-Johnson) buy it early in the first series. The establishment mostly remains on that brink, despite Janice&#x27;s best efforts as manager, eventually coming under the control of the boorish Cyril Bryson (Dave Hill) in the final series.

Although focused on the restaurant&#x27;s kitchen, the countryside (with its black market suppliers) and the Blackstocks&#x27; home life are also backdrops for the show; the chef&#x27;s long hours mean that Janice is routinely neglected in the bedroom, and their plans for a family remain delayed.

==Cast==
Besides Gareth and Janice Blackstock, a third character, Everton Stonehead (played by Roger Griffiths), appears throughout all three series. Stonehead went to school with the chef and dreams of becoming a top chef himself. He bumbles through his early days in the kitchen, but eventually even develops a signature dish of his own.

==Production==
According to Lenny Henry:
:The first episode of &quot;Chef!&quot; was developed over two years, and so Peter Tilbury and I were really put through loads of hoops about character motivation. Why is this character such an arsehole? Is this the right kind of character for Lenny Henry to be playing? All that kind of stuff. Once we got through that and they greenlit the series, Peter then had something like eight or nine weeks to write the rest of it. The remaining five episodes were much easier to write because we&#x27;d had every argument about who, what, where, and how. The world had been mapped out. Actually, the very first episode of &quot;Chef!&quot; was the hardest one to watch for me because we&#x27;d worked so hard on it and you could see all the things that had been rewritten in the first episode.

Lenny Henry was coached in cooking techniques at the L&#x27;Ortolan Restaurant, in Shinfield, Reading, Berkshire. The restaurant was modelled on, and many scenes were filmed at, Le Manoir aux Quat&#x27; Saisons, a restaurant in Oxfordshire owned by chef Raymond Blanc. Many other scenes were filmed at Nether Winchendon House, in Buckinghamshire. The third series was shot at Teddington Studios in Middlesex. Celebrity chef John Burton Race acted as food consultant for the show.

The first two series were shot on film and directed in the style of a drama series, with the finished episodes shown to screening audiences. 

Lenny Henry stated on his website that he and Tilbury had worked on a storyline for another series, but that nothing came of it.

==Episodes==
===Series 1 (1993)===
===Series 2 (1994)===
===Series 3 (1996)===
==Reception==
According to the Museum of Broadcast Communications, the show was &quot;highly critically acclaimed for its high production values, its comic-drama scripts, and its lead performances. Most of all, perhaps, the series [was] a landmark programme in the sense that Henry plays a character who just happens to be black; the fact of his blackness does not limit the narrative or the audience the series reaches.&quot;

BFI&#x27;s screenonline noted that &quot;what really marked out &quot;Chef!&quot;, however, was Henry&#x27;s development as an actor. As the kitchen tyrant Gareth Blackstock, he proved himself capable of representing a multifaceted character far beyond the caricatures of his sketch shows.&quot; It also noted that &quot;Chef!&quot; &quot;managed some acute observations on food and contemporary Britain: the celebritisation of cuisine, the pathological obsession with hygiene, the near impossibility of securing genuinely excellent produce in a culture dominated by industrial farming and supermarket giants.&quot;

Some contemporary critics were less positive, however. Reviewing the second series in the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, Victor Lewis-Smith described it as &quot;...not funny enough to be classed as sit-com, nor believable enough to be classed as drama, forensic science has been unable to detect any trace of humour or subtlety in this dismal hybrid&quot;.

==Home release==
All three series were released on Region 1 DVD on 30 August 2005. The Region 2 DVDs have been available since 2 October 2006.
Several minutes of the first series episode &quot;The Big Cheese&quot; were missing from the Region 2 DVD release. This was due to a mastering error; corrected replacement discs were later offered by the BBC. The Region 1 release is full and uncut.

<text>Heavy equipment, heavy machinery, earthmovers, construction vehicles, or construction equipment, refers to heavy-duty vehicles specially designed to execute construction tasks, most frequently involving earthwork operations or other large construction tasks. &quot;Heavy equipment&quot; usually comprises five equipment systems: the implement, traction, structure, power train, and control/information. 

Heavy equipment has been used since at least the 1st century BC, when the ancient Roman engineer Vitruvius described a crane powered by human or animal labor in &quot;De architectura&quot;.

Heavy equipment functions through the mechanical advantage of a simple machine that multiplies the ratio between input force applied and force exerted, easing and speeding tasks which often could otherwise take hundreds of people and many weeks&#x27; labor. Some such equipment uses hydraulic drives as a primary source of motion.

The word plant, in this context, has come to mean any type of industrial equipment, including mobile equipment (e.g. in the same sense as powerplant). However, plant originally meant &quot;structure&quot; or &quot;establishment&quot; – usually in the sense of factory or warehouse premises; as such, it was used in contradistinction to movable machinery, often in the phrase &quot;plant and equipment&quot;.

==History==
The use of heavy equipment has a long history; the ancient Roman engineer Vitruvius (1st century BCE) gave descriptions of heavy equipment and cranes in ancient Rome in his treatise &quot;De architectura&quot;. The pile driver was invented around 1500. The first tunnelling shield was patented by Marc Isambard Brunel in 1818.

===From horses, through steam and diesel, to electric and robotic===

Until the 19th century and into the early 20th century heavy machines were drawn under human or animal power. With the advent of portable steam-powered engines the drawn machine precursors were reconfigured with the new engines, such as the combine harvester. The design of a core tractor evolved around the new steam power source into a new machine core traction engine, that can be configured as the steam tractor and the steamroller. During the 20th century, internal-combustion engines became the major power source of heavy equipment. Kerosene and ethanol engines were used, but today diesel engines are dominant. Mechanical transmission was in many cases replaced by hydraulic machinery. The early 20th century also saw new electric-powered machines such as the forklift. Caterpillar Inc. is a present-day brand from these days, starting out as the Holt Manufacturing Company. The first mass-produced heavy machine was the Fordson tractor in 1917.

The first commercial continuous track vehicle was the 1901 Lombard Steam Log Hauler. The use of tracks became popular for tanks during World War I, and later for civilian machinery like the bulldozer. The largest engineering vehicles and mobile land machines are bucket-wheel excavators, built since the 1920s.

Until almost the twentieth century, one simple tool constituted the primary earthmoving machine: the hand shovel—moved with animal and human powered, sleds, barges, and wagons. This tool was the principal method by which material was either sidecast or elevated to load a conveyance, usually a wheelbarrow, or a cart or wagon drawn by a draft animal. In antiquity, an equivalent of the hand shovel or hoe and head basket—and masses of men—were used to move earth to build civil works. Builders have long used the inclined plane, levers, and pulleys to place solid building materials, but these labor-saving devices did not lend themselves to earthmoving, which required digging, raising, moving, and placing loose materials. The two elements required for mechanized earthmoving, then as now, were an independent power source and off-road mobility, neither of which could be provided by the technology of that time.

Container cranes were used from the 1950s and onwards, and made containerization possible.

Nowadays such is the importance of this machinery, some transport companies have developed specific equipment to transport heavy construction equipment to and from sites.

Most of the major equipment manufacturers such as Caterpillar, Volvo, Liebherr, and Bobcat have released or have been developing fully or partially electric-powered heavy equipment. Commercially-available models and R&amp;D models were announced in 2019 and 2020.

Robotics and autonomy has been a growing concern for heavy equipment manufacturers with manufacturers beginning research and technology acquisition. A number of companies are currently developing (Caterpillar and Bobcat) or have launched (Built Robotics) commercial solutions to the market.

==Types==

==Traction: Off-the-road tires and tracks==


Heavy equipment requires specialized tires for various construction applications. While many types of equipment have continuous tracks applicable to more severe service requirements, tires are used where greater speed or mobility is required. An understanding of what equipment will be used for during the life of the tires is required for proper selection. Tire selection can have a significant impact on production and unit cost. There are three types of off-the-road tires, &quot;transport&quot; for earthmoving machines, &quot;work&quot; for slow moving earthmoving machines, and &quot;load and carry&quot; for transporting as well as digging. Off-highway tires have six categories of service C compactor, E earthmover, G grader, L loader, LS log-skidder and ML mining and logging. Within these service categories are various tread types designed for use on hard-packed surface, soft surface and rock. Tires are a large expense on any construction project, careful consideration should be given to prevent excessive wear or damage.
==Heavy equipment operator==
A heavy equipment operator drives and operates heavy equipment used in engineering and construction projects. Typically only skilled workers may operate heavy equipment, and there is specialized training for learning to use heavy equipment.

Much publication about heavy equipment operators focuses on improving safety for such workers. The field of occupational medicine researches and makes recommendations about safety for these and other workers in safety-sensitive positions.

==Equipment cost==

Due to the small profit margins on construction projects it is important to maintain accurate records concerning equipment utilization, repairs and maintenance. The two main categories of equipment costs are ownership cost and operating cost.

===Ownership cost===

To classify as an ownership cost an expense must have been incurred regardless of if the equipment is used or not. These costs are as follows:
*purchase expense
*salvage value
*tax savings from depreciation
*major repairs and s
*property taxes
*insurance
*storage
Depreciation can be calculated several ways, the simplest is the straight-line method. The annual depreciation is constant, reducing the equipment value annually. The following are simple equations paraphrased from the Peurifoy &amp; Schexnayder text:
===Operating cost===
For an expense to be classified as an operating cost, it must be incurred through use of the equipment. These costs are as follows:
The biggest distinction from a cost standpoint is if a repair is classified as a &quot;major repair&quot; or a &quot;minor repair&quot;. A major repair can change the depreciable equipment value due to an extension in service life, while a minor repair is normal maintenance. How a firm chooses to cost major and minor repairs vary from firm to firm depending on the costing strategies being used. Some firms will charge only major repairs to the equipment while minor repairs are costed to a project. Another common costing strategy is to cost all repairs to the equipment and only frequently replaced wear items are excluded from the equipment cost. Many firms keep their costing structure closely guarded as it can impact the bidding strategies of their competition. In a company with multiple semi-independent divisions, the equipment department often wants to classify all repairs as &quot;minor&quot; and charge the work to a job – therefore improving their &#x27;profit&#x27; from the equipment.
==Models==

Die-cast metal promotional scale models of heavy equipment are often produced for each vehicle to give to prospective customers. These are typically in 1:50 scale. The popular manufacturers of these models are Conrad and NZG in Germany, even for US vehicles.

<text>Manuel Isidoro Belzu Humérez (4 April 1808 – 27 March 1865) was a Bolivian military officer and statesman who served as the 11th president of Bolivia from 1848 to 1855. Under his presidency, the current national anthem and flag of Bolivia were adopted.

==Early life and education==
Belzu was born in La Paz to &quot;mestizo&quot; parents Gaspar Belzu and Manuela Humérez. He was educated as a youth by Franciscan friars. However, Belzu admired the heroes of the Spanish American wars of independence such as Simón Bolívar and José de San Martín and hoped to emulate them. For this reason, he decided to join Army of Liberation when he was fifteen, in hopes to join the fight against the Spanish in his homeland of Upper Peru. He joined the wars of independence, fighting under Andrés de Santa Cruz at Zepita (1823). After serving as an aide-de-camp to Agustín Gamarra, he left the Peruvian army when the latter entered Bolivia in 1828.

==Marriage and family==
Assigned as garrison commander to Tarija, where Francisco Burdett O&#x27;Connor was military governor at the time, Belzu married &quot;up&quot; by wedding a beautiful and intellectual Argentine lady, Juana Manuela Gorriti, who resided there with her family. General O&#x27;Connor would be one of the witnesses to the wedding and would later be a supporter of Belzu. They had two daughters, Edelmira and Mercedes. Edelmira would later marry General Jorge Córdova, who became Belzu&#x27;s successor.

== Military career and plots ==

Belzu fought in the battles of the Peru-Bolivian Confederacy, during which he was promoted to the post of Army commander by President José Ballivián. He had fought bravely under his orders at the Battle of Ingavi (1841).

Originally a close friend and supporter of President Ballivián, Belzu turned against him about 1845. Ballivián had reportedly attempted to seduce Belzu&#x27;s wife in his own Oruro home. Surprising the President there, Belzu shot at him and barely missed. The event sealed an undying enmity between the two that would never abate. Political ambitions—typical of upper-level Bolivian military officers at the time—may have played a role in addition to the personal reasons. Belzu decided at that point to try to topple the &quot;Hero of Ingavi&quot; from the presidency. Withdrawing to the countryside (orders for his arrest for the attempted murder of the President had been issued), Belzu never ceased to conspire against his former friend.

=== Ideology and rise to power ===
Belzu&#x27;s political stance became more populist as he embraced his &quot;mestizo&quot; heritage, railed against the power of the &quot;white&quot; oligarchy, and vowed to advance the cause of the poor and the Indian should he come to the presidency. In his travels as a fugitive, Belzu had seen the deplorable conditions under which most of the population lived, with scarcely any improvements or public works by the government. His position established a strong base of support among the peasants, who came to know him as &quot;Tata (Father, or Protector) Belzu.&quot;

Another, more conventional anti-Ballivián insurgent group was commanded by the ambitious former president, José Miguel de Velasco. As a warlord, he led his army in competition with that of Belzu in the race to topple the President. The embattled Ballivián found the country ungovernable, and in December 1847 he fled to exile abroad. He left the government in the hands of General Eusebio Guilarte, head of the Council of State and legally second-in-line to the presidency.

At this point Belzu made a pact with Velasco to support the latter&#x27;s accession to the Presidency while Belzu took the position of Minister of War. Belzu quickly betrayed Velasco and had his troops proclaim him as President. A bloody counter-coup by General Velasco had to be put down, with Belzu commanding the troops that crushed Velasco&#x27;s. By the end of the year, Belzu had destroyed the opposition (both Ballivián and Velasco) and consolidated his power as the sole &quot;de facto&quot; president of Bolivia.

== President of Bolivia ==
As promised, Belzu led his government in undertaking populist measures, but he also wanted to maintain strong control over power. Most of Belzu&#x27;s reforms were cosmetic, although his political statements were more liberal than any president&#x27;s had been since Sucre. During his seven-year presidency Belzu attempted to modernize the country through division of wealth and by rewarding poor workers. Belzu also defended the small, indigenous producers by implementing protectionist economic policies as well as enacting a nationalist mining code that kept the nations resources in the hands of Bolivian companies, which in turn provoked many influential British as well as Peruvian and Chilean shipping and mining companies. Belzu also promoted communal state-sponsored social welfare projects that resonated with local Indians, since communalism was more representative of indigenous values than private property.

As a result of Belzu&#x27;s appeal to the country&#x27;s poor and indigenous groups, he had gained a number of powerful enemies who would want to destroy the state-run projects he created though at the same time gained large support and power. capitalizing on his relative popularity, Belzu managed to legitimize his rule by becoming democratically elected. He faced constant opposition and rebellions from the pro-Ballivián camp, from ambitious fellow military warlords, and later, from the pro-Linares faction that coalesced as a united front against military &quot;caudillism&quot;. Belzu&#x27;s protectionist economic policies were opposed by Great Britain and the United States, and isolated Bolivia from the global economy and ongoing intellectual trends. Although popular with the masses due to his statist policies (contrary to prevailing notions), Belzu never lacked enemies among the powerful, whose interests he threatened. He barely survived a well-planned assassination attempt in Sucre, carried out by Agustin Morales, then an obscure mid-ranking officer but one who would later become president.

Lieut. Lardner Gibbon, US Navy, while exploring the valley of the Amazon, met with President Belzu in Bolivia and wrote the following account:
&quot;Upon inquiring how the President came by some wounds in his face, I was told that in September, 1850, Belzu was invited to take a walk in the &quot;alameda&quot; [market] of Sucre. A friend persuaded him to continue on outside the usual promenade, where they met some persons riding on horseback, upon the report of whose pistols Belzu fell, three balls having entered his head. The ruffians escaped from the country; the friend was shot in the plaza of the capitol (sp) before Belzu was well enough to interfere in his behalf. The plan was well laid, and so sure were the intended murderers that his days were ended, they rode off, leaving him on the ground, shouting “viva Ballivián,” an ex-president, who at that time was known to be lingering along the boundary line between Bolivia and the Argentine republic. This attempt to assassinate Belzu made him the more popular. The country is taught that his escape was Providential, and he had been spared for the good of the people.&quot; (Ch.5, p.135)

== Retirement and the presidency of General Córdova ==
By the early 1850s, Belzu dispensed with any pretense of democratic norms and ruled despotically. After seven years, a weary Belzu decided to &quot;retire&quot; in 1855. He ran elections in which he sponsored the candidacy of his loyal son-in-law, General Jorge Córdova. The latter was duly elected over José María Linares (perhaps with the help of at least some degree of official fraud), and for two years ruled Bolivia as a virtual proxy of the powerful former president. During this time, Belzu served as his country&#x27;s plenipotentiary in Europe.

In 1857, Córdova was overthrown in a coup d&#x27;état. Ambrosio Peñailillo was defeated by Linares&#x27; partisans, causing the surrender of the &quot;belcista&quot; army. Still acting as Belzu&#x27;s proxy, he was murdered after being caught plotting against President José María de Achá in 1862. This galvanized Belzu despite his age; he returned to Bolivia and raised an army, with the hope of returning to the presidency and avenging the death of his son-in-law.

=== The Constitutionalist Uprising of 1865–1865 ===
Even after Belzu had been eliminated, Melgarejo still faced widespread discontent from several sector of society and would face nearly a year of rebellions by a collective group called &quot;Constitutionalists&quot;. Having seized power only in December 1864, less than a month later Melgarejo clashed with rebel forces in Tacaquira, located in the southern area of the Chuquisaca Department, on January 24, 1865. The rebels would win this encounter, facing government troops again in a bigger battle on the banks of the Oscara River on February 3 and ultimately retreating.

== Exile and assassination ==
To Melgarejo&#x27;s dismay, former President Manuel Isidoro Belzu, who was exiled in Europe, returned to Bolivia to dispute the rise of Melgarejo, sparking a full civil war. On March 22, 1865, Belzu&#x27;s army defeated the government forces in La Paz with the help of the popular masses. On March 27, Melgarejo and Quintín Quevedo attacked La Paz with his army but was defeated, with several of his men choosing to side with Belzu.

However, as soon as Belzu entered the Palacio Quemado for the meeting, Melgarejo and his men murdered him. New investigations have come up with the theory that since Melgarejo&#x27;s revolver failed (the seller found out that only 1 bullet came out of 5 shots), then the bullet that killed Belzu came from the revolver of some soldier who was behind him.

According to legend, when Melgarejo&#x27;s presence was known, a crowd gathered in the Plaza Murillo, located in front of the Bolivian Government Palace, cheering Belzu&#x27;s name. However, Melgarejo appeared on a balcony instead and announced, &quot;Belzu is dead. Who lives now?&quot; and the crowd shouted: &quot;Long live Melgarejo!&quot;
