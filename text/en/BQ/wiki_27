<text>Olympique de Marseille (, ; , ), also known simply as Marseille, or by the abbreviation OM (, ), is a French professional football club based in Marseille which competes in Ligue 1, the top flight of French football. Founded in 1899, OM has won 28 domestic trophies: 9 Ligue 1 titles, 10 Coupe de France, 3 Coupe de la Ligue, and 3 Trophée des Champions. Continentally, the club holds a national record of one UEFA Champions League and a joint national record of one UEFA Intertoto Cup. Additionally, Marseille has played in three UEFA Europa League finals. In 1993, coach Raymond Goethals led the team to become the first and only French club to win the UEFA Champions League, defeating Milan 1–0 in the final, the first under the UEFA Champions League branding of the tournament. In 2010, Marseille won its first Ligue 1 title in 18 years under the management of former club captain Didier Deschamps.

Marseille&#x27;s home ground is the 67,394-capacity Stade Vélodrome in the southern part of the city, where they have played since 1937. The stadium underwent renovations between 2011 and 2014, increasing its capacity to 67,000 in preparation for France&#x27;s hosting of UEFA Euro 2016. The club has a large fan-base, having regularly averaged the highest attendance in French football. Marseille&#x27;s average home gate for the 2018–19 season was 50,361, the highest in Ligue 1. The club have a long-standing rivalry with Paris Saint-Germain, against whom they contest Le Classique.

In 1997, Marseille was purchased by Franco-Swiss businessman Robert Louis-Dreyfus. Following his death in 2009, his widow Margarita became the club&#x27;s majority shareholder in 2010. American businessman Frank McCourt bought 95% of the club&#x27;s stake in 2016, and appointed businessman Jacques-Henri Eyraud as the club president, later replaced by Pablo Longoria in 2021.

Marseille was listed in the Deloitte Football Money League at the end of the 2022–2023 season, making it the 20th football club with the highest revenue in the world, approximated at €258 million.
In 2023, Marseille was placed twenty-eighth in the global ranking drawn up by the British consultancy organisation Brand Finance in terms of brand power, where it was rated with a credit rating AA (&quot;very strong&quot;) with a score of 71.3 out of 100, as well as twenty-eighth in terms of brand value (€173 million) and twenty-eighth by enterprise value (€458 million as of 2023).

==History==

Olympique de Marseille was founded as an omnisport club in 1892 by René Dufaure de Montmirail, a French sports official. Known as Sporting Club, US Phocéenne and Football Club de Marseille in the first seven years after its foundation, the club adopted the name &quot;Olympique de Marseille&quot; in 1899 in honour of the anniversary of Marseille&#x27;s founding by Greeks from Phocaea some 25 centuries earlier, with the name Olympique, coming from ancient Olympic Games.

At first, rugby union was the most important team sport of the club, the motto &quot;Droit au but&quot; coming from rugby. Affiliated with the Union des Sociétés Françaises de Sports Athlétiques (USFSA) since 1898, it was only in 1902, thanks to English and German people (according to André Gascard), that football began to be played by Olympique de Marseille. Richer and better organised than other football teams of Marseille (Sporting, Stade, Phocéenne), Olympique de Marseille, then playing at the Stade de l&#x27;Huveaune, took the leadership in the city. In 1904, Olympique de Marseille won the first &quot;Championnat du Littoral&quot;, involving opposing teams from Marseille and its suburbs, and took part in the final rounds of the 11th French championship. At that time, the word &quot;football&quot; applied to rugby, and people used the word &quot;&quot;Association&quot; (which would be soccer in North America)&quot; for football.

During the 1920s, Olympique de Marseille became an important team in France, winning the Coupe de France in 1924, 1926 and 1927. The team won the French championship in 1929, defeating Club français. The Coupe de France in 1924 was the club&#x27;s first major title, won against FC Sète, a side that dominated French football at the time. In the &#x27;20s, numerous French internationals, such as Jules Dewaquez, Jean Boyer or Joseph Alcazar, played for Marseille. In 1930, Marseille lost against Sète, which would be the winner, in the semi-final round. In 1931, the team became champion of the South-East, with victories against rivals such as Sète. In the Coupe de France, l&#x27;OM lost in five matches to Club français, winning the second match that was cancelled due to the disqualification of Marseille striker Vernicke. Even though the 1931–32 season was less successful, Marseille easily entered the professional ranks, becoming a member of the union of professional clubs in 1932. On 13 January 1932 at 9:15 pm, at the Brasserie des Sports, Mr. Dard, Mr. Bison, Dr. Rollenstein, Mr. Etchepare, Mr. Leblanc, Mr. Mille, Mr. Anfosso, Mr. Sabatier, Mr. Seze, Mr. Bazat, Mr. Molteroj and Mr. Pollack elected the following committee:
Honorary presidents: Paul Le Cesne et Fernand Bouisson
President: M. Dard
Vice-Presidents: Mr. Leblanc, Mr. Bison, Mr. Etchepare, Dr. Rollenstein et Mr. Anfosso
general secretary: Mr. Possel-Daydier
Treasurer: Mr Bison (assisted by Mr Ribel).

For the first championship, Division 1 was divided into two pools. Marseille finished second in the first, behind Lille. For its first match of the championship, Marseille defeated the future champion, Lille. In 1937, Marseille won its first professional French championship thanks to goal difference &quot;(+30 for Marseille, +17 for Sochaux)&quot;. The arrival of Vasconcellos made the defence stronger, whereas former goalkeeper Laurent Di Lorto shone with Sochaux and France. In the meantime, Marseille won the Coupe de France in 1935 and 1938 but failed a double success in 1934, due to FC Sète. In 1938, Larbi Benbarek signed with Marseille and became &quot;the black pearl&quot; for the team. World War II would cut his career short. The 1942–43 season was full of records: 100 goals in 30 matches, including 20 in one match (20–2 against Avignon), in which Aznar scored nine goals, including the first eight (Marseille was leading 8–0), playing only 70 minutes. Aznar scored 45 goals in 30 matches, plus 11 in cup games, for a record of 56 goals in 38 matches. With the &quot;minots&quot; (young players) of the moment (Scotti, Robin, Dard, Pironti), Marseille won the cup in two matches against Bordeaux (4–0). In 1948, thanks to a draw against Sochaux, Marseille became the champions of France. The two last victories at the Stade Vélodrome against Roubaix (6–0) and Metz (6–3) were important, as Aznar and Robin&#x27;s returned in spring.

In 1952, Marseille were about to be relegated, but Gunnar Andersson saved his team, finishing as top scorer with 31 goals. The team won (5–3) on aggregate against Valenciennes. The same year, Marseille lost at the Stade Vélodrome against Saint-Étienne 10–3, but Liberati was injured. In 1953, Gunnar Andersson would take the record of goals scored in one season with 35. Andersson also became the all-time top scorer of Olympique de Marseille during his time there with 194 goals. A record he still holds (2023). Marseille was runner-up in the Coupe de France (Nice won 2–1) in 1954 and won the Coupe Charles Drago in 1957. Marseille were struggling at the time and were relegated for the first time in 1959. From 1959 to 1965, the team played in the second division, except during the 1962–63 season, finishing 20th out of 20 in the first division. In 1965, Marcel Leclerc became president.

===1965–1986: Leclerc era and crisis===

The first period of Olympique de Marseille&#x27;s domination of the French League started in the early 1970s under Marcel Leclerc&#x27;s presidency (1965–1972). His ambition allowed Marseille to return to the First division in 1965–66. They went on to win the &quot;Coupe de France&quot; in 1969 as well as the First division in 1971 with a record of 44 goals by Josip Skoblar, helped by Roger Magnusson. The arrival of Georges Carnus and Bernard Bosquier from Saint-Étienne helped them to win the Ligue 1 and the Coupe de France in 1972. Marseille played in the European Cup in 1971–72 and 1972–73, but were knocked-out by Ajax of Johan Cruyff and Juventus, respectively. However, success was not to last. Marcel Leclerc was forced to leave the club on 19 July 1972. The President was a stubborn man, and he threatened the league to withdraw his professional team from Ligue 1 because the federation refused to accept three foreign players per team (Leclerc wanted to acquire the Hungarian star Zoltán Varga but he had already the maximum number of two foreigners in his team). Marseille decided, instead of following Leclerc against the league, to fire him. Then followed an era of crisis, with Marseille only winning a Coupe de France in 1976 and being relegated to the second division, where they played with a bunch of young local players: the &quot;Minots&quot; who allowed the team to return to First division in 1984. Éric Di Meco, future French international, was one of them.

===1986–1996: Tapie era, Champions League win, bribery scandal, and decline===

Thanks to Marseille mayor Gaston Defferre, Bernard Tapie became the new club president on 12 April 1986, and promptly proceeded to assemble the greatest football team seen in France up to that point. His first signings were Karl-Heinz Forster and Alain Giresse, who were bought after the 1986 FIFA World Cup. Over the subsequent six years, in his pursuit of the European Cup, Tapie signed a number of highly regarded players such as Jean-Pierre Papin, Abedi Pele, Klaus Allofs, Eric Cantona, Chris Waddle, Enzo Francescoli, Manuel Amoros, Carlos Mozer, Jean Tigana, Didier Deschamps, Dragan Stojković, Basile Boli, Marcel Desailly, Rudi Völler, Fabien Barthez, Alen Bokšić, Martín Vázquez, Igor Dobrovolski, and François Omam-Biyik in addition to appointing high-profile coaches like Franz Beckenbauer, Gérard Gili and Raymond Goethals. Between 1989 and 1992, Olympique de Marseille won four league titles in a row and the French Cup. The team also reached the European Cup final for the first time in 1991, losing on penalties to Red Star Belgrade. The highlight of the club&#x27;s history is winning the new format Champions League in 1993. Basile Boli scored the only goal against Italy&#x27;s Milan in the final held in Munich&#x27;s Olympic Stadium. That triumph was the first time ever for a French club and it made Didier Deschamps and Fabien Barthez the youngest captain and goalkeeper, respectively, to capture the title.

This triumph, however, was followed by a decade of decline. In 1994, due to financial irregularities and a match-fixing scandal involving then-president Bernard Tapie, they suffered enforced relegation to the second division, where Marseille stayed for two years before returning to the First division. Moreover, they lost their 1992–93 Division 1 title and the right to play in the 1993–94 UEFA Champions League, the 1993 European Super Cup and the 1993 Intercontinental Cup. This scandal, called &quot;l&#x27;affaire VA-OM&quot; (VA for Union Sportive Valenciennes-Anzin and OM for Olympique de Marseille), was exposed by Valenciennes, whose players Jacques Glassmann, Jorge Burruchaga and Christophe Robert were contacted by Marseille player Jean-Jacques Eydelie to let OM win and, more importantly, not to injure any OM player ahead of the UEFA Champions League final.

===1996–2009: Return to success===

Marseille returned to the top flight in 1996 with backing from Adidas&#x27;s CEO Robert Louis-Dreyfus. He chose Rolland Courbis as coach, signed Fabrizio Ravanelli, Laurent Blanc and Andreas Köpke, and Marseille finished eleventh for his return. For the 1998–99 season, the team celebrated their centenary and built a team of stars: Robert Pires, Florian Maurice and Christophe Dugarry, culminating in a second-place finish in the French championship, behind Bordeaux and an appearance in the UEFA Cup Final in 1999, losing to Parma. Courbis left the team in November 1999 after a poor start to the season.

The closest Marseille got to another trophy was when they reached the UEFA Cup Final in 2004, impressively beating Dnipro, Internazionale, Liverpool and Newcastle United along the way. But they were beaten in the final by newly crowned Spanish champions Valencia and once again fans were forced to continue waiting for the next trophy to come along. In 2005, Marseille succeeded in winning the Intertoto Cup, beating the likes of Lazio and Deportivo de La Coruña in doing so, and earning another shot at the UEFA Cup.

In January 2007, there was negotiation between Louis-Dreyfus and Jack Kachkar, a Canadian doctor and businessman (CEO of pharmaceutical company Inyx), about selling the club. As Jack Kachkar took too much time to buy the team, Louis-Dreyfus decided on 22 March 2007 not to sell to the Canadian businessman. Another close call to glory was in the Coupe de France final against Sochaux in May 2007. However, they lost on penalties after a 2–2 draw after extra time, to the disappointment of everyone linked with the club, but they soon wiped all that disappointment away by qualifying for the 2007–08 UEFA Champions League group stage after securing second place with one game to spare.

In the Champions League, Marseille became the first French team to win at Anfield when they beat 2007 runners-up Liverpool 1–0, and the team took six out of six points from their opening two games. They only drew one more match, and in a winner-takes-all final group game they lost 4–0 to Liverpool, who became the first English team to win at the Stade Vélodrome. Marseille, coming third in the Champions League Group A, then joined the UEFA Cup.
Marseille finished the 2008–09 season with a second-place finish in Ligue 1, following a tight race with Bordeaux for the title. This earned them direct entry into the group stages of the UEFA Champions League, their third consecutive season in the competition. Marseille won the 2010 Coupe de la Ligue Final beating Bordeaux 3–1 at the Stade de France in March 2010. This was their first major title since their Champions League triumph 17 years earlier. Two months later, Marseille won their first league championship for 18 years with two games to spare after beating Rennes 3–1. Marseille defeated rivals Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) on penalties to win the 2010 Trophée des Champions at Stade 7 Novembre in Rades, Tunisia, before the season began. Marseille then became the first team to win back-to-back Coupe de la Ligue successes when they won the 2011 edition by beating Montpellier 1–0 on 23 April. Before that, they qualified for the last 16 of the UEFA Champions League for the first time since their historic success, but lost 2–1 at Old Trafford to Manchester United and also set a Champions League record by thrashing Žilina 7–0 in what was the biggest away win in the competition&#x27;s history. In 2011, Marseille lost the Ligue 1 championship title but qualified for the UEFA Champions League for the fifth time in a row, a club record. On 27 July 2011, Marseille won the 2011 Trophée des Champions title by beating Lille 5–4 at Stade de Tanger in Morocco. The result was significant as OM were 3–1 down with five minutes to go, only to embark on a remarkable comeback which saw 5 goals scored in the last five minutes with André Ayew scoring a hat-trick.

===2009–2014: Deschamps, Baup, Anigo===
The club struggled in the 2011–12 season, going to the bottom of the Ligue 1 table after six matches. Nevertheless, Marseille rebounded, winning 3–0 against Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League, as well as a 3–0 success over rivals PSG in November of that year. Marseille ended 2011 with a good sequence, also qualifying for the knockout stages of the Champions League for the second season running.

In February 2012, Marseille embarked on 13 games without victory, but rallied to qualify for the quarter-finals of the Champions League for the first time since winning the competition in 1993. Despite an indifferent club form, OM lost to eventual finalists Bayern Munich, and slumped to an overall tenth-place finish in Ligue 1. However, the club retained the Coupe de la Ligue for the third year running, beating Lyon 1–0 in the Final.

In the summer of 2012, Deschamps resigned, and later took on the France job. Elie Baup took over, leading the club to a surprising second-place finish in the 2012–13 season despite selling multiple key players, including Loïc Rémy, César Azpilicueta and Stéphane Mbia. Marseille returned to the Champions League, spending close to €40 million on the likes of Dimitri Payet, Florian Thauvin and Giannelli Imbula. The club were top of the table at the end of August 2013, but OM proceeded to lose all six games in Europe, suffering the ignominy of becoming the first French team, and the biggest European team to date, to have picked up zero points in a Champions League group stage.

Baup was sacked on 7 December 2013, following the 1–0 defeat to Nantes at Stade Velodrome. He was replaced on an interim basis by José Anigo. In Anigo&#x27;s brief tenure, OM went out of the two cups, and struggled, leading to continued protests and jeers by fans. The club finished sixth in the 2014 season, missing out on an important European competition place for the first time in ten years. Anigo left the club soon after, taking on an ambassadorial/scouting role in North Africa, his first post outside of the city for more than four decades.

===2014–2015: Bielsa era and stagnation===

Marseille announced on 2 May 2014 an agreement with Marcelo Bielsa, who took the managerial hotseat. Bielsa was the club&#x27;s first Argentine coach and the first coach to lead the team into the renovated Velodrome, which opened in August with a fixture against Montpellier. In Bielsa&#x27;s first season in charge, the club led the league table for seven months but finished fourth and thus qualified for the UEFA Europa League. June 2015 saw three key players leave the club—André-Pierre Gignac and André Ayew left the club for Tigres and Swansea City, respectively, after their contracts expired, while Dimitri Payet left to join West Ham United for a €15 million transfer fee.

After a solid pre-season, which included a 2–0 win over Juventus in the Robert Louis-Dreyfus Trophy and the signature of nine players, Bielsa resigned from his post, just minutes after the first Ligue 1 game of the 2015–16 season against Caen. Marseille lost the game 1–0, and Bielsa shocked the footballing world with his unexpected decision, citing a lack of trust with the club&#x27;s management, who he said had reneged on a previously agreed contract extension. Bielsa&#x27;s departure reportedly left his players in a state of shock, many of whom learnt the news via social media in the dressing room.

On 19 August 2015, Míchel was announced as Marseille&#x27;s new coach. He endured a frustrating season, with OM failing to win a home game in Ligue 1 for more than six months. Following a number of poor performances, Míchel was sacked in April by club owner Margarita Louis Dreyfus, citing poor conduct as the team&#x27;s coach. The sacking came on the eve of the club&#x27;s Coupe de France semi-final fixture. As in 2015, Passi was installed as the caretaker coach. Under his direction, Marseille reached the Coupe de France final for the first time in nine years, losing out 4–2 to rivals Paris Saint-Germain. OM would finish the league season in 13th, the club&#x27;s worst league finish in 15 years.

In the summer of 2016, Marseille once more sold off a number of key players to meet financial obligations and to clear its wage bill ahead of an impending takeover. Steve Mandanda, the club&#x27;s long-serving captain ended eight years at the club and moved to Crystal Palace, Nicolas N&#x27;Koulou moved to Lyon, while striker Michy Batshuayi was sold to Chelsea for a club record €40 million.

===2016–present: New ownership and revival===
Marseille began the 2016–17 Ligue 1 season with interim manager Franck Passi at the helm. On 29 August 2016, it was announced that American businessman Frank McCourt had agreed to buy the club from Margarita Louis-Dreyfus. The purchase deal was completed for a reported price tag of €45 million on 17 October 2016. Within the next few days, McCourt appointed Jacques-Henri Eyraud as the club&#x27;s president, Rudi Garcia as the manager of the club&#x27;s first team and Andoni Zubizarreta as director of sport.

On 3 May 2018, Marseille reached the final of the 2017–18 UEFA Europa League after eliminating Red Bull Salzburg in the semi-finals 3–2 on aggregate, 14 years after its last final in a European competition in 2004 against Valencia. However, they lost the final to Atlético Madrid.

In the 2019–20 Ligue 1 season, Andre Villas-Boas became head coach. Marseille finished second after the season was ended early due to the coronavirus pandemic, thus qualifying for the 2020–21 UEFA Champions League for the first time since 2013–14.

In February 2021, after this string of losses, conflict with players, and lack of support from sporting director Pablo Longoria and President Jacques-Henri Eyraud, head coach Andre Villas-Boas offered to resign, three days after a violent riot by protesting Marseille fans at the team training grounds had forced postponement of a league match with Rennes. Marseille sacked Villas-Boas, and replaced the coach with Argentine Jorge Sampaoli. The club also appointed Pablo Longoria to be the team&#x27;s new president, replacing Jacques-Henri Eyraud, as Eyraud had also been a target of the ire of Marseille fans.

In January 2022, Marseille player Pape Gueye was banned from playing for 4 months by FIFA, while Marseille were given a ban on making transfers in both the summer 2022 and January 2023 transfer windows, and forced to pay €2.5 million to Watford. This came after the English club brought litigation against Marseille over the transfer of Gueye, who had originally signed a contract with Watford, but after finding out his agent had lied to him about the salary on offer, broke the contract and signed with Marseille. Marseille appealed FIFA&#x27;s decision. In the 2021–22 Ligue 1 season, Marseille finished in second place, securing Champions League football for the first time since 2020. In the final matchday, they were helped by Lens&#x27;s equalizing goal in the final moments of a 2–2 draw with Monaco.

==Le Classique==

Le Classique is a football match that is contested between Paris Saint-Germain and Olympique de Marseille. The term Classique is modelled on El Clásico, contested between Barcelona and Real Madrid. Akin to all the game&#x27;s major rivalries, the antipathy between PSG and Marseille extends outside the pitch. The French &quot;clásico&quot; has a historical, cultural and social importance that makes it more than just a football game, pitching capital against province, and the traditional wealth and high culture of Paris against the industrial and cosmopolitan traditions of Marseille. However, this rivalry appears only in the 1990s, where it is promoted by the respective owners of PSG - Canal+, the TV channel which broadcast the Ligue 1 football matches - and Olympique de Marseille - Bernard Tapie, also owner of the sports company Adidas -, for obvious marketing reasons. It is sometimes seen as &#x27;the favourite son&#x27; of French football against its &quot;enfants terribles&quot;. With PSG being located in the north in the French capital and Marseille located along the Mediterranean coast, the rivalry is often referred to as &quot;&quot;the North versus the South&quot;.&quot; PSG and Marseille are the only two French clubs to have won major European trophies, PSG having won the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1996 and Marseille won the UEFA Champions League in 1993, and they were the two dominant forces before the emergence of Lyon at the beginning of the 21st century. However, despite their recent ups and downs, PSG and Marseille remain fierce rivals, giving this match a special atmosphere. &quot;Le Classique&quot; is also known as &quot;Le Classico&quot;.

==Stadium==
From 1904 to 1937, Marseille played at the Stade de l&#x27;Huveaune, a stadium owned by the club, in contrast to its current stadium. L&#x27;Huveaune, once named Stade Fernand Buisson in honour of a former rugby player of the club who became a member of the French National Assembly, was renovated at the beginning of the twenties, thanks to supporter&#x27;s financial help. It had a capacity of . In 1937, &quot;l&#x27;OM&quot; moved into the much larger Stade Vélodrome after compelling the city of Marseille to lower its rent. The club made use of the Stade de l&#x27;Huveaune again during the renovation of the Vélodrome for Euro 1984, during the 1982/83 season. The Vélodrome again underwent redevelopment in time for the 1998 World Cup and was transformed into an immense ground composed of two Curva ends (Virage Nord and Virage Sud – North Curve and South Curve) which house the supporters groups as well as the main stand, Jean Bouin, and the imposing Ganay stand. In a third renovation, in preparation for Euro 2016, the municipality covered the stands with a roof, and increased its capacity to 67,000 to host the Euro 2016 games.

Before the start of each home game the song &quot;Jump&quot; by Van Halen is heard.
When a goal is scored by Marseille in their home matches the song &quot;Come with Me&quot; by Puff Daddy is played.

== Kits and crest ==

Marseille&#x27;s traditional kit colours were white shirts and shorts with blue socks until 1986. Since 1986, Marseille have played with white shirts, white shorts and white socks, and the blue color became lighter due to Adidas marketing but in 2012–2013, the club returned to its original kit, wearing blue socks.

Club founder drew inspiration from his personal seal, which featured interlaced letters &quot;D&quot; and &quot;M&quot;, to create the club&#x27;s first badge. The club&#x27;s motto, &quot;Droit au but&quot;, dates from the days when the club&#x27;s main sport was rugby, under the name &quot;Football Club de Marseille&quot;. The original badge featured an ornate letter &quot;M&quot; superimposed over an &quot;O&quot;, with the club motto draped across the glyph. The logo persisted for three decades, until 1935, when an art deco shield was adopted, with a simple &quot;M&quot; encased within the &quot;O&quot;. In 1972, OM redesigned its logo, this time preferring a complex &quot;M&quot; letterform. In 1986, the club re-adopted its first badge; the logo evolved slightly over the next few decades, gaining a star in 1993 to commemorate the club&#x27;s UEFA Champions League trophy. To commemorate the club&#x27;s 100th anniversary in 1999, a variant featuring a golden &quot;O&quot; and a turquoise &quot;M&quot; was used; a similar 110th anniversary logo was used during the 2009–10 season. The most recent form was revealed on 17 February 2004; the &quot;O&quot; and &quot;M&quot; are rendered as a single unit in turquoise without shading or borders, and the logo is capped by the golden star representing the victory in the Champions League and sits above. The club&#x27;s motto &quot;Droit Au But&quot; (French for &quot;Straight to the Goal&quot;) also rendered in gold appears under the badge.

=== Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors ===
==Supporters==
===Virage Nord De Peretti===
The atmosphere in the Stade Vélodrome is created by the dominance of OM&#x27;s own supporters who are located in the Curva style ends behind both goals. The North Curve is home to the Marseille Trop Puissant, Fanatics, and Dodger&#x27;s supporters associations who buy up the tickets at the start of each season and sell them on to their members. The Virage Nord is next to the away enclosure, which is protected by high fences. In 2002, the Virage Nord was officially given the name of Patrice de Peretti &quot;(1972–2000)&quot;, the late founder and leader of the supporters group Marseille Trop Puissant (MTP). In 2010, the third kit of OM was a tribute to MTP, with the red, yellow and green colours of Africa, symbols of this left-wing curva. In 2018, owner Frank McCourt and president Jacques-Henri Eyraud decided to exclude the Yankee Nord due to a number of delictuous activities, especially concerning tickets ; they therefore forbid them to sell the said tickets, and the association is no longer officially recognized by the club.

===Virage Sud Chevalier Roze===

The virage is named after Nicolas Roze, a noble who distinguished himself in particular by creating a hospital in Marseille during the Great Plague of Marseille in 1720. As with the Virage Nord, the South Curve is controlled by supporter&#x27;s associations with the Commando Ultra &#x27;84, the first group of ultra supporters in France created in August 1984, and the South Winners dominating the central section and Club Central des Supporters filling the remaining sections of the stand.
The 2007/08 third shirt of OM was a tribute to South Winners fans whose colours are orange, as they are traditionally left wing fans.

===AEK Athens, Livorno and St. Pauli===
There is a strong relationship between AEK Athens, Livorno, FC St. Pauli and Marseille. Marseille fans often lift banners and create choreography in support of the fellow teams.

<text>The Beaufort Sea ( ; ) is a marginal sea of the Arctic Ocean, located north of the Northwest Territories, Yukon, and Alaska, and west of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. The sea is named after Sir Francis Beaufort, a hydrographer. The Mackenzie River, the longest in Canada, empties into the Canadian part of the Beaufort Sea west of Tuktoyaktuk, which is one of the few permanent settlements on the sea&#x27;s shores.

The sea, characterized by severe climate, is frozen over most of the year. Historically, only a narrow pass up to opened in August–September near its shores, but recently due to climate change in the Arctic the ice-free area in late summer has greatly enlarged. Until recently, the Beaufort Sea was known as an important reservoir for the replenishment of Arctic sea ice. Sea ice would often rotate for several years in the Beaufort Gyre, the dominant ocean current of the Beaufort Sea, growing into sturdy and thick multi-year ice.

Claims that the seacoast was populated about 30,000 years ago have been largely discredited (see below); present population density is very low. The sea contains significant resources of petroleum and natural gas under its shelf, such as the Amauligak field. They were discovered in the period between the 1950s and 1980s, and since the latter part of that period their exploration has become the major human activity in the area. The traditional occupations of fishing and whale and seal hunting are practiced only locally, and have no commercial significance. As a result, the sea hosts one of the largest colonies of beluga whales, and there is no sign of overfishing as of now. To prevent overfishing in its waters, the US adopted a precautionary commercial fisheries management plan in August 2009. In April 2011, the Canadian government signed a memorandum of understanding with the Inuvialuit as a first step in developing a larger ocean management plan. The Canadian government announced in October 2014 that no new commercial fisheries in the Beaufort Sea will be considered until research has shown sustainable stocks that would be made available to Inuvialuit first.

The Canadian government designated blocks of the Beaufort Sea as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). The Anguniaqvia niqiqyuam MPA surrounds the Parry Peninsula in the Amundsen Gulf, and the Tarium Niryutait MPA is located at the Mackenzie River delta and estuary. The protected areas are set to protect species and habitats for the Inuvialuit community.

==Extent==
The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Beaufort Sea as follows:

&quot;On the North.&quot; A line from Point Barrow, Alaska, to Lands End, Prince Patrick Island ().

&quot;On the East.&quot; From Lands End through the Southwest coast of Prince Patrick Island to Griffiths Point, thence a line to Cape Prince Alfred, the Northwestern extreme of Banks Island, through its West coast to Cape Kellet, the Southwestern point, and thence a line to Cape Bathurst on the mainland ().

===Border dispute===
There is an unresolved dispute involving a wedge-shaped slice on the International Boundary in the Beaufort Sea, between the Canadian territory of Yukon and the U.S. state of Alaska. Canada claims the maritime boundary to be along the 141st meridian west out to a distance of , following the Alaska–Yukon land border. This follows the natural prolongation principle, which holds that a nation&#x27;s maritime boundary should reflect the &#x27;natural prolongation&#x27; of where its land territory reaches the coast. The position of the United States is that the boundary line should be perpendicular to the coast out to a distance of , following a line of equidistance from the coast. The equidistance principle argues that a nation&#x27;s maritime boundaries should conform to a median line that is equidistant from the shores of neighbouring nations. This difference creates a wedge with an area of about that is claimed by both nations.

Canada&#x27;s position has its roots in the Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1825) between the United Kingdom and the Russian Empire that set the boundary between the two. Canada is the successor state to Great Britain in relation to this treaty, which stipulates:
Canada maintains that this treaty is extensible from the land into the Beaufort Sea along the meridian. The United States rejects this extension and instead asserts a boundary line based upon equidistance, although its position is somewhat undermined by its acceptance in 1867 of similar treaty wording and a similar interpretation under the treaty whereby it acquired Alaska. Both the U.S. and Canada agree that they are bound by the 1958 Convention on the Continental Shelf; and they both agree that the boundary should be &quot;equitable&quot;, as determined by the International Court of Justice. They differ on what should be deemed &quot;equitable&quot;. The U.S. contends that &quot;equidistance is an appropriate principle for determining a maritime boundary where there are no special circumstances in the area and when equidistance results in a boundary in accordance with equitable principles&quot;. Canada contends that an equidistance principle does not result in an equitable boundary, because distortion would occur. The coast of Yukon is concave, whereas the coast of Alaska is convex; and thus an equidistance principle would result in a significant extension of the U.S. possession. This dispute has taken on increased significance due to the possible presence of natural reserves within the wedge, which according to Canada&#x27;s National Energy Board may contain of gas, which would cover the national consumption for 20 years, and more than of oil. Because of this, Canada argues that &quot;special circumstances&quot; apply to this border, a position that the U.S. rejects. This dispute is in this respect a mirror image of the dispute between the U.S. and Canada over the Gulf of Maine, where the U.S. argued for &quot;special circumstances&quot; and Canada argued for the equidistance principle. (In that latter dispute, both of those arguments were rejected, and the border was drawn based upon geometric principles taking into account geographic factors.) Neither the U.S. nor Canada has pressed for a swift resolution for the matter, or arbitration at the International Court of Justice, however; and the two have in the meantime cooperated in several measures aimed at preserving the maritime environment.

Before the end of 2004, the US leased eight plots of land below the water for oil exploration and exploitation, provoking a diplomatic protest from Canada. On 20 August 2009, United States Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke announced a moratorium on commercial fishing of the Beaufort Sea north of Alaska, including the disputed waters. In July 2010, US–Canada negotiations have started in Ottawa with the next meeting planned in 2011. A joint geological survey of the area has been initiated, and the issue was marked as settled by the CIA World Factbook, though no official document has been released by September 2010.

===Moratorium on commercial fishing===
On August 20, 2009 United States Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke announced a moratorium on fishing the Beaufort Sea north of Alaska. According to Locke: 

There is no widespread commercial fisheries in those waters now.

The moratorium was imposed in anticipation that global warming would make those waters accessible to commercial fisheries.
The moratorium stirred controversy in Canada because the region where the USA announced the moratorium included a large wedge-shaped region of disputed waters. Randy Boswell, of &quot;Canada.com&quot; wrote that the disputed area covered a section of the Beaufort Sea.
He wrote that Canada had filed a &quot;diplomatic note&quot; with the US in April when the USA first announced plans for the moratorium. Jack Layton, leader of the New Democratic Party of Canada, called the U.S. moratorium over the disputed waters in the Beaufort Sea the &quot;largest encroachment on Canadian territory in our history.&quot;

==Geography==

Several rivers such as the Kongakut River in Alaska and the Firth River in Yukon empty into the Beaufort. The major river to flow into the sea is the Mackenzie, Canada&#x27;s longest, which empties into the Canadian part of the sea, west of Tuktoyaktuk. The coastal shelf area is rather narrow, especially near and east of Point Barrow in the Alaskan part of the sea, and contains numerous submarine valleys. It becomes wider near the delta of the Mackenzie River but nowhere exceeds . Near the coast, the depths are shallower than but they rapidly increase northwards up to a few kilometers, transforming into a massive platform which is geologically similar to that of the oceans. There are many small islands in the sea and in the delta of the Mackenzie River. A few larger ones lie west of the Mackenzie River, such as Herschel Island ( off the shore, area ) and Barter Island ( from the coast, area ). The coasts are low, with the maximum elevations between . The soil is frozen all year around at the depth below about or less, forming permafrost, and only the top few tens of centimeters thaws in summer. Consequently, buildings have to be elevated above ground on wooden piles that are immersed into the permafrost.
==Hydrology and climate==

The Beaufort Sea is frozen over through the year, except for August and September when the ice breaks near the coast and opens what was once a wide strip of open water. During the 2000s, due to climate change in the Arctic, the ice-free area in late summer greatly enlarged. During the record minimum extent of Arctic sea ice in September, 2012, the sea ice boundary had retreated northward much farther than normal from the coast.

The channels of the Mackenzie River thaw earlier, in late May–early June. This thawing increases the average water discharge from about .

Hidden changes in the ice cover of the Beaufort Sea were discovered in 2009. Whereas the ice area remain stable, as detected by the observation satellites, so as the associated water temperature and salinity, the ice structure has changed recently. The new ice, called rotten ice, is thinner and much weaker structurally.

The sea water has a stable temperature and is separated into four distinct layers as follows. The top are surface water which has a temperature of in summer and in winter. The next layer is formed by the inflows from the Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea coming through the Bering Strait; it extends up to the North Pole. The warmest, deep Atlantic layer has the temperatures between , and water at the bottom is a bit colder at . The average salinity varies between 28‰ and 32‰ (parts per thousand) from south to north. Typical air temperatures (at Tuktoyaktuk) are in January and in July.

The water currents form the clockwise-directed Beaufort Gyre, that results in south-westerly and westerly currents near the shores. The Mackenzie River partly affects this circulation inducing minor eastwards streams near its mouth. The river annually brings about 15 million tonnes of sediments which are rich in dolomite and calcium carbonate. Those deposits are spread over the sea and mixed with mud and gravel.

==Flora and fauna==
The shoreline of the Beaufort Sea is covered with tundra and marks the northern limit of the terrestrial range of the polar bear in North America. The Mackenzie River is an important habitat for whales and seabirds and is still relatively untouched by commercial traffic. The delta of Mackenzie River contains numerous lakes and ponds which are inhabited by muskrat.

The sea hosts about 80 species of zooplankton, more than 70 species of phytoplankton, and nearly 700 species of polychaetes, bryozoans, crustaceans and mollusks, but their total volume is relatively small owing to the cold climate. Major fish species include polar cod (&quot;Boreogadus saida&quot;), Arctic cod (&quot;Arctogadus glacialis&quot;), saffron cod (&quot;Eleginus gracilis&quot;), Arctic char (&quot;Salvelinus alpinus&quot;), chum salmon (&quot;Oncorhynchus keta&quot;), Arctic cisco (&quot;Coregonus autumnalis&quot;), least cisco (&quot;Coregonus sardinella&quot;), lake whitefish (&quot;Coregonus clupeaformis&quot;), broad whitefish (&quot;Coregonus nasus&quot;), Pacific herring (&quot;Clupea pallasii&quot;), fourhorn sculpin (&quot;Myoxocephalus quadricornis&quot;), inconnu (&quot;Stenodus leucichthys&quot;) and flatfish.

The eastern part of the sea is a major habitat of beluga whales with an estimated population of 39,000. This population is stable and might even be increasing; it is not affected by the offshore oil exploration in the area. Belugas spend summer in the coastal area and Mackenzie River delta, which are free of ice then, and in winter migrate long distances to the polynyas of the deep sea. Genetic analyses have confirmed that belugas of the Beaufort Sea are clearly distinct from those of other Canadian and Alaskan waters, despite often sharing a common wintering habitat.

The food chain of the Beaufort Sea is relatively simple: It starts with phytoplankton and epontic algae (single-cell algae associated with the lower interface of sea ice), which provide energy to zooplankton, and epontic and coastal amphipods. The latter serve as a food for seabirds and fish, primarily as polar cod and Arctic char. Polar cod is a major food of Arctic char, beluga, narwhal, seabirds and seals, which are dominated by the bearded seal (&quot;Erignatus barbatus&quot;) and ringed seal (&quot;Pusa hispida&quot;). Bearded seal and walrus also feed on benthic invertebrates. On top of the food pyramid stands the polar bear, which feeds primarily on seals, but also on any large marine mammals when it has a chance, such as carcasses and whales trapped in ice fields.

==Human activities==
&quot;There is only one proposed Early-Entry site in eastern Beringia that still has proponents, Bluefish Caves in the Porcupine River Basin, Yukon Territory, Canada. Claims of great antiquity in the area [e.g., 30kya] have a convoluted history. A caribou tibia flesher, the most diagnostic human implement from the Old Crow basin, had been dated at near 28 kya. When redated using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) of small amounts of remnant collagen the bone produced a 1.8 kya date (Yesner 1996b:255)&quot;. There is no evidence for anomalous occupation of Beaufort coasts in the context of Arctic cultures generally, including the arrival about 4,000 years ago by Paleo-Eskimos such as the Dorset culture, around 1,000 years ago by the Thule and finally by the modern Inuit. From early ages, they practiced fishing – bones of Arctic char were found at the 4,000 years old settlements. While originally they lived nomadic life, later, they started to form permanent settlements. Their population is increasing, but the unemployment rate is relatively high.

Bowhead whales were hunted in the sea between 1888 and 1914. This practice stopped, first because of the decline in whale population and then because of government regulations, but resumed in the 1990s.

The major settlements along the Beaufort Sea are Tuktoyaktuk (population 930 in 2009) in Canada and Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. Although Prudhoe Bay is permanently populated by only a few people, there are thousands of contract workers in the area employed on petroleum production at the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field, which is on the coastal lowland known as the North Slope. Artificial islands, such as Endicott and Northstar, have been raised near the shores in 1987 and 2001, respectively. The crude oil is transported through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System to the southern port of Valdez.

Fishing and sea hunting are practised by the local inhabitants and have no commercial value, especially after a US moratorium on commercial fishing of the Beaufort Sea, adopted in 2009. Trapping of muskrat at the Mackenzie River delta was the main source of income for the Athabaskan First Nations peoples and Inuit during 1920–1960, but has since declined.

==Oil and gas exploration==

The Beaufort Sea contains major gas and petroleum reserves beneath the seabed, a continuation of proven reserves in the nearby Mackenzie River and North Slope. The Beaufort Sea was first explored for sub-shelf hydrocarbons in the 1950s and estimated to contain about of oil and of natural gas under its coastal shelf. Offshore drilling began in 1972; about 70 wells were set up by the 1980s and 200 wells by 2000. These activities resulted in dredging of about 46.5 million m3 of sea bottom soil, as well as discharge of drilling muds which contained barite, clay, caustic soda, and heavy metals zinc, copper, lead, chromium, cobalt, nickel, cadmium and mercury. About of oil was produced in 1986.

A major gas field, named Taglu Gas Field, was discovered in the Mackenzie River delta in 1971, followed by the Parson Lake field and Niglintgak field. The estimated gas reserves of these fields are , , respectively. Moreover, further into the sea from the Mackenzie delta lies the Amauligak field. This, the largest known oil deposit of the Beaufort Sea, was discovered in 1984, and is estimated to contain of oil and of gas. The development of these fields is hindered by their remote location. This problem was alleviated for Prudhoe Bay by constructing the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, but is limiting regular commercial production at Mackenzie River deposits. For example, the Amauligak Project was started soon after the discovery of the field. In September 1985, the tanker &quot;Gulf Beaufort&quot; has transported of crude oil to Japan, which was the first shipment of oil from the Arctic deposits. However, the project has stalled after that.

In July 2017, the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management approved a plan to allow Eni, an Italian multinational oil and gas company, to drill four oil exploration wells on Spy Island, one of four artificial islands in the Beaufort Sea.

<text>Alpinist is a quarterly American magazine focused on mountain literature and mountaineering ascents worldwide.

== History and profile ==
&quot;Alpinist&quot; was founded in 2002 and was originally published out of Jackson, Wyoming. It was resurrected in 2009 and is now based in Jeffersonville, Vermont.

The magazine often focuses on &quot;fast and light&quot; ascents and advocates a rigorous clean-climbing style (not leaving gear behind).

&quot;Alpinist&quot; won the Maggie Award for Best Overall Design/Consumer Category from the Western Publication Association (WPA) for its Autumn issue (Issue 8) in 2005, and the Maggie Award for the Best Quarterly/Consumer Division in April 2004 for its Winter 2003–2004 issue (Issue 5).

On October 16, 2008 the magazine announced that it was closing operations due to financial problems. The magazine was re-launched on April 15, 2009, with Michael Kennedy as the new Editor-in-Chief, by Height of Land Publications, home of &quot;Telemark Skier&quot; and &quot;Backcountry&quot; magazines.

In May 2012, Kennedy was replaced as editor-in-chief by longtime contributing editor Katie Ives.

In August 2022, Ives retired and Derek Franz was named as the new editor in chief.

Over the years, notable &quot;Alpinist&quot; contributors have included David Roberts, Steve House, Marko Prezelj, Kyle Dempster, Steve Swenson, Ian Parnell, Hayden Kennedy, Pat Deavoll, Dean Potter, Nick Bullock, Andy Kirkpatrick, Marc-Andre Leclerc, Brette Harrington, Sibylle Hechtel, Tamotsu Nakamura, Alex Honnold and Tommy Caldwell.

<doc id="492083" wikidata="Q2631324" url="?curid=492083" title="Artemy Volynsky">
<text>Artemy Petrovich Volynsky (; 1689–1740) was a Russian statesman and diplomat. His career started as a soldier but was rapidly upgraded to ambassador to Safavid Iran, and later as Governor of Astrakhan during the reign of Peter the Great (r. 1682–1725). He was later accused of corruption and stripped of nearly all his powers, before Catherine I of Russia sent him to govern the vast Governorate of Kazan. Anna of Russia appointed Volynsky one of her three chief ministers in 1738. After beating the noted poet Vasily Trediakovsky, Volynsky was arrested on charges of conspiracy and misconduct. Volynsky&#x27;s archenemy Ernst Johann von Biron had him sentenced to death and beheaded on 27 June 1740.

==Military youth==
Artemy Volynsky was a male-line descendant of Prince Bobrok and thus the Lithuanian Gediminid dynasty. His father was one of the dignitaries at the court of Feodor III, and also a voivod in Kazan. He entered a dragoon regiment in 1704 and rose to the rank of captain, by 1711; then, exchanging the military service for diplomacy, he was attached to the suite of Vice-Chancellor Peter Shafirov. He was present during the Pruth Campaign and shared Shafirov&#x27;s captivity in the Seven Towers in Constantinople.

==Minister for Peter the Great==
In 1715, by orders of Peter the Great he was sent to Isfahan, Persia, (which he reached in March 1717) as the new Russian ambassador. During his travels he was supposed to redirect the silk trade route in Persia to Russia with the Armenians&#x27; help. During his stay in Isfahan, Volynsky signed the Russo-Iranian treaty of 1717 with Shah Soltan Hoseyn.

In 1718 Peter made him one of his six adjutant generals, and governor of Astrakhan. In this post Volynsky displayed distinguished administrative and financial talents. In 1722, he married Alexandra Naryshkina, Peter&#x27;s cousin. The same year he was accused of peculation and other offences to the emperor, who caned him severely and deprived him of his plenipotentiary powers, despite his undeniable services in Persia, but for which Peter could never have emerged so triumphantly from the difficult Persian War of 1722–1723.

==Governor of Kazan==
Catherine I made Volynsky governor of the Kazan Governate for a short time, and he held the same post for two years (1728–1730) under Peter II. But his incurable corruption and unbridled temper so discredited the government that he was deprived of the post shortly after the accession of Anne. From 1730 to 1736 Volynsky served in the army under Munnich. In 1737 he was appointed the second Russian plenipotentiary at the abortive congress of Nemirov held for the conclusion of peace with the Porte.

==Condemned under Anne==

In 1738 he was introduced into the Russian cabinet by Biron as a counterpoise against Andrei Osterman. Volynsky, however, now thought himself strong enough to attempt to supersede Biron himself, and openly opposed the favorite in the State Council in the debates as to the indemnity due to Poland for the violations of her territory during the War of the Polish Succession, Biron advising that a liberal indemnity should be given, whereas Volynsky objected to any indemnity at all.

Biron thereupon forced Anne to order an inquiry into Volynsky&#x27;s past career, with the result that he was tried before a tribunal of Biron&#x27;s men. The charges faced were that he, as a minister, and Andrey Khrushchyov (1691—1740), as an assistant minister, tried to dethrone Empress Anne for Peter the Great&#x27;s daughter, Elizabeth. He was arrested on 23 June 1740 and thus condemned to be broken on the wheel and then beheaded. On the scaffold, by the clemency of the empress, his punishment was mitigated to the severing of his right hand followed by decapitation on 27 June 1740. The sentence was executed exactly 31 years after the Battle of Poltava. Volynsky had by his side architect Pyotr Yeropkin and .

== Legacy ==

A tombstone in their honour was erected in 1741 by order of Elizabeth of Russia over their burial place beside St. Sampson Cathedral. That was the only thing that was visible over their grave until 1885 when a monument was placed as they were seen as national heroes because they opposed German ideas, as represented by Biron. This point of view would have been quite amazing to their contemporaries and reflects more the concerns of the next century than of Biron&#x27;s and Volynsky&#x27;s time.

The charge of conspiracy appears to have been untrue. Volynsky was tortured twice but even under torture he refused to admit to conspiracy, while admitting the ancillary charge of taking bribes (of which no Russian official of the time was innocent). Volynsky&#x27;s draft of a &quot;General Project of Internal Affairs of the State&quot; contained many suggestions for reforms of administration but avoided altogether the subject of imperial succession and prerogatives.

<text>Tetranychus urticae (common names include red spider mite and two-spotted spider mite) is a species of plant-feeding mite generally considered to be a pest. It is the most widely known member of the family Tetranychidae or spider mites. Its genome was fully sequenced in 2011, and was the first genome sequence from any chelicerate.

==Distribution==

&quot;T. urticae&quot; was originally native only to Eurasia, but has acquired a cosmopolitan distribution as a common pest in a wide range of agricultural systems.

==Description==

&quot;T. urticae&quot; is extremely small, barely visible with the naked eye as reddish, yellow or black spots on plants; the adult females measure about long. Adult mites sometimes spin a fine web on and under leaves.

==Ecology==

This spider mite is extremely polyphagous; it can feed on hundreds of plants, including most vegetables and food crops – such as peppers, tomatoes, potatoes, pepinos, beans, maize, and strawberries, and ornamental plants such as roses. It is the most prevalent pest of &quot;Withania somnifera&quot; in India. It lays its eggs on the leaves, and it poses a threat to host plants by sucking cell contents from the leaves cell by cell, leaving tiny pale spots or scars where the green epidermal cells have been destroyed. Although the individual lesions are very small, attack by hundreds or thousands of spider mites can cause thousands of lesions, thus can significantly reduce the photosynthetic capability of plants. They feed on single cells which are pierced with a stylet-like mouthpart and the cell contents are removed, they do damage to the spongy mesophyll, palisade parenchyma, and chloroplasts.

&quot;T. urticae&quot; populations may increase rapidly in hot, dry conditions, expanding to 70 times the original population in as few as six days.

The mite&#x27;s natural predator, &quot;Phytoseiulus persimilis&quot;, commonly used as a biological control method, is one of many predatory mites which prey mainly or exclusively on spider mites.

&quot;T. urticae&quot; is among the few animals known to synthesise carotenoids. As in aphids and gall midges, the genes for carotene synthesis appear to have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer from a fungus.

== Lifecycle ==
&quot;T. urticae&quot; reproduces through arrhenotoky, a form of parthenogenesis in which unfertilized eggs develop into males.

The egg of &quot;T. urticae&quot; is translucent and pearl-like. It hatches into a larva, and two nymph stages follow: a protonymph, and then a deutonymph, which may display quiescent stages. The adults are typically pale green for most of the year, but later generations are red; mated females survive the winter in diapause.

===Inbreeding avoidance===
Inbreeding is detrimental for fitness in &quot;T. urticae&quot;. Inbred progeny mature more slowly than outbred progeny, and inbred female progeny have lower reproductive output. &quot;T. urticae&quot; females apparently are capable of kin recognition and have the ability to avoid inbreeding through mate choice.

== Genomics ==

The genome of &quot;T. urticae&quot; was fully sequenced in 2011, and was the first genome sequence from any chelicerate.

<doc id="492096" wikidata="Q6260321" url="?curid=492096" title="John Taylor (Baptist preacher)">
<text>John Taylor (1752–1833) was a pioneer Baptist preacher, religious writer, frontier historian and planter in north and central Kentucky. His two histories of early Baptist churches in Kentucky provide insight into the frontier society of the early decades of the 19th century. His 1820 pamphlet entitled &quot;Thoughts on Missions&quot; put him at the center of the controversy within frontier Baptist congregations about supporting mission societies. In buying and selling land on the frontier, Taylor acquired and 20 African-American slaves by the end of the first decade of the 19th century, thus entering the planter class.

==Early life and education==
Taylor was born in 1752 in Fauquier County, Virginia to a farming family. He was taught at home to read, write and do his numbers. Although christened in the Church of England, he was strongly influenced by the preaching of the Baptist William Marshall, whom he first heard at age 17. Taylor united with the Baptists when he was 20 years old and began preaching on the frontier while living in Virginia.

In his &quot;History of Clear Creek Church: and Campbellism Exposed&quot; (1830), Taylor provided material about his origins:

At my birth, and in the early part of my life, my lot was cast in the backwoods of Virginia, where Indians often killed people, not far from where I was. My parents, who were of the church of England, told me, I had been christened when young. Being taught in all the rules of the old prayer book, I had my partialities that way; but we lived so frontier, I never heard any man preach, till about 17 years old; this was a baptist, (William Marshall). My awakening that day, was so striking, that I was won over to Marshall, and the religion he taught. A little more than two years after this, by the conviction I had from the New Testament, I was baptised [sic], and became a baptist from principle. To this way, and cause, I have had warm and decided attachments ever since. I would not be hard or unfriendly to other christian societies; but I am a decided, full bred baptist. ... 

==Marriage and family==
Taylor married Elizabeth Cavanaugh, daughter of Philemon and Nancy (Cave) Kavanaugh. They had several children together. Their son Ben was born a month after their arrival in Kentucky in December 1783, after a difficult three-month trip from Virginia through the mountains. Their daughter Jane married Jeconiah Singleton, another early Baptist pioneer and son of Manoah and Sally (Craig) Singleton, members of the early Forks of Elkhorn Church. The Singletons had migrated to Kentucky in 1781 with The Travelling Church, led by Sally&#x27;s brother, the Rev. Lewis Craig, pastor of the notable congregation.

==Career==
While Taylor was in his 20s, he organized and served churches in the Virginia frontier settlements. At age 29, he took his young family to Kentucky in late 1783, two years after the historic migration of &quot;The Traveling Church&quot; of Baptists from Spotsylvania County, Virginia. Later he wrote about the trip: &quot;... We arrived at Craig&#x27;s Station, a little before Christmas (1783), and about three months after our start from Virginia. Through all this rugged travel my wife was in a very helpless state; about one month after our arrival, my son Ben was born.&quot; He was soon called as the first pastor in Clear Creek Baptist Church, Woodford County, Kentucky.

In 1795 Taylor moved with his family to Boone County, where he was the stated preacher at Bullittsburg Baptist Church (1795–1802), the first church in northern Kentucky. Seven of his slaves were also members of the church. He was ministering there when the church experienced a revival in 1800–01 (during the period referred to in the South as the &quot;Second Great Awakening&quot;). A total of 113 people converted and were baptized into Taylor&#x27;s church. Never financially supported by a church, he pursued independent farming and other vocations, as did most frontier preachers.

In addition to acting as a pastor, Taylor was part of organizing local Baptist associations in Kentucky. In 1785 Taylor attended the organizing conference of the Elkhorn Baptist Association (Lexington, Kentucky area). He also was part of organizing the Long Run Baptist Association (Louisville, Kentucky area) in 1803. There he preached the Introductory Sermon and was on the committee of organization. He became one of the early leaders of that association.

In 1802 he moved his family to Gallatin County (a portion now in Trimble County) near Mount Byrd along the Ohio River, where he had already bought nearly of land in various tracts. There he entered the planter class, for he eventually held 20 enslaved African Americans and owned , selling some of his former land to other settlers to create a community. Historians of the antebellum South define planters as those people who held 20 or more slaves to work their land. While not all Baptists held as many slaves as Taylor, by this time most members had accommodated to the Southern institution and stopped calling for its abolition. &quot;Far more than their Northern counterparts, Southern evangelical Protestants stressed the importance of individual piety rather than social regeneration.&quot;

Ministering in Gallatin County for 13 years, Taylor also stayed in contact with the churches and pastors of the Boone County area. He attended a total of 25 North Bend Association meetings from 1805 through 1834. He was invited to preach virtually each time he attended. Fourteen of the visits were at Boone County churches, which hosted the association meetings.

In 1815 Taylor moved his family and slaves to Franklin County to be further from the free state of Indiana, which proximity across the Ohio River from Gallatin County he had believed threatened his slave holdings. The missionary James E. Welch, who knew him, wrote a biography of the preacher, saying Taylor had left Gallatin because of differences with his congregation. He helped found a Baptist church in Frankfort. Next he helped establish one at Buck Run in 1818, where he was invited to pastor. Instead, he chose to preach there regularly for several years.

Many religious historians have identified Taylor&#x27;s leading role in the disputes over the Missionary/Anti-missionary movement that arose among Protestant churches in the United States in the 1820s. In his booklet, &quot;Thoughts on Missions&quot; (1820), Taylor criticized mission societies and their methods of soliciting money from frontier churches. Later in life, he expressed regret over writing the 36-page pamphlet. The historian Larry D. Smith noted that Taylor was opposed only to &quot;mission societies;&quot; he was never opposed to missions.

Most of Taylor&#x27;s ministry preceded the controversy associated with the anti-missionary movement among Baptists, and he did not appear to have &quot;divided&quot; with his brethren over the issue. In 1820 Taylor gave a copy of his &quot;Missions&quot; pamphlet to the local (North Bend) Association, but they made no comment on it. He was still invited to preach for the association that year and at later times when he attended their meetings. In 1820 the Elkhorn Association reported, &quot;Bro. John Taylor presented to the Association a pamphlet, written by himself, on the subject of missions, which was referred to the committee on arrangement.&quot; At a later session of the body, &quot;after much discussion it was agreed to strike out that item from the arrangement, and return the pamphlet to the author.&quot; Similarly, Taylor gave the booklet to the Long Run Association; there was no surviving record of any response. He was honored by being one of two preachers asked to conduct the funeral of Absalom Graves, who was then the leading advocate of missions in the northern part of the state. 
Though not formally educated, Taylor was an expressive writer with strong opinions. His &quot;A History of Ten Churches&quot; was first printed in 1823, and &quot;A History of Clear Creek Church: and Campbellism Exposed&quot; in 1830. He also wrote several brief biographies, as well as many articles that were published in religious periodicals. The &quot;Concise Dictionary of American Biography&quot; describes &quot;A History of Ten Baptist Churches&quot; as &quot;a fine picture of religion on the frontier.&quot;

When asked to tell about Taylor&#x27;s life, James E. Welch, a frontier Baptist missionary, wrote: 
I saw this aged brother at the meeting of the Elkhorn Association, at the Big Spring Church, near Frankfort, in 1832. He was a member of the Body; and yet he took his place on the front seat of the gallery. The Moderator, observing him, said, — &#x27;Come down, Brother Taylor, and sit with us;&#x27; but he promptly replied, — &#x27;I am a free man, Brother Moderator,&#x27; and kept his seat. (The gallery was a balcony where the slave members and attendees of the church were seated during worship services.) He was low of stature, muscular, had broad shoulders and a broad face, high cheek bones and heavy eyebrows, over-hanging a pair of light and small, but expressive, eyes. He was plain, and by no means particular, in his apparel, and rather reserved in conversation, though, at times, he seemed to enjoy a dry joke upon his brethren.

Taylor died in 1833 in Franklin County, Kentucky near Forks of Elkhorn Creek, the year of a major cholera epidemic in the region. Welch wrote: &quot;His death was peaceful and tranquil, and he has left behind him a name worthy of enduring remembrance.&quot; The 19th-century historian William Cathcart wrote, &quot;He [Taylor] traveled and preached extensively and probably performed more labor, and was more successful than any other pioneer Baptist preacher in Kentucky.&quot;

<text>Count Mikhail Illarionovich Vorontsov () (12 July 171415 February 1767) was a Russian statesman and diplomat, who laid foundations for the fortunes of the Vorontsov family.

At the age of fourteen, Vorontsov was appointed a kammerjunker at the court of the tsesarevna Yelizaveta Petrovna, whom he materially assisted during the famous coup d&#x27;etat of 6 December 1741, when she mounted the Russian throne on the shoulders of the Preobrazhensky Grenadiers. On 3 January 1742 Vorontsov married countess Anna Karlovna Skavronskaya, the empress&#x27;s maternal first cousin, and in 1744 was created a count and vice-chancellor. His envy of Aleksei Petrovich Bestuzhev-Ryumin induced him to participate in Count Lestocq&#x27;s conspiracy against that statesman. The empress&#x27;s affection for him (she owed much to his skilful pen and still more to the liberality of his rich kinsfolk) saved him from the fate of his accomplices, but he lived in a state of semi-eclipse during Bestuzhev&#x27;s ascendancy.

When Bestuzhev fell from grace, Vorontsov was made imperial chancellor in his stead. Though well-meaning and perfectly honest, Vorontsov as a politician was singularly timorous and irresolute, always taking his cue from the court. For example, under Elizabeth he was an avowed enemy of Prussia and a warm friend of Austria and France, but he made no effort to prevent Peter III from reversing the policy of his predecessor. Yet he did not lack personal courage and endured torture after the coup of 9 July 1762, rather than betray his late master. Having advanced his niece Yelizaveta to the position of favourite mistress of Peter III, he naturally greatly disliked Peter&#x27;s wife, Catherine, and at first refused to serve under her, though she reinstated him in the dignity of chancellor. When he found that real control over foreign affairs was in the hands of Nikita Panin, he resigned his office in 1763. 
Mikhail Vorontsov may be said to have revived the fortunes of his ancient and illustrious family. His name is preserved in the lavish St Petersburg palace that he commissioned from the imperial architect Bartolomeo Rastrelli. He squandered most of his personal fortune on that edifice but was subsequently obliged to sell it to the crown for lack of the funds required to complete its interior decoration. His niece Catherine was on intimate terms with her royal namesake, Catherine II, and his nephew Alexander Romanovich Vorontsov also attained the dignity of imperial chancellor in the early years of Alexander I&#x27;s reign.

<text>Anders Adolph Retzius (13 October 1796 – 18 April 1860), was a Swedish professor of anatomy and a supervisor at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.

==Biography==
Retzius was born in Lund to Anders Jahan Retzius and Ulrika Beata Prytz in 1796. His brother was the doctor . He enrolled at Lund University in 1812 where he studied medicine, and alternated with studies in Copenhagen, until he in 1818 became a licensed doctor of medicine. Through his friendship with Jöns Jakob Berzelius, as early as 1824 he was appointed temporary professor of anatomy at the Karolinska Institute, an institute to which he dedicated much of his strength for many years. In 1830 he was also appointed temporary supervisor there, and in 1840 he was appointed both permanent professor and supervisor. Pathologist Axel Key was one of his students.

During the next decades he made many anatomical discoveries, for instance about the finer parts of the teeth, of the skull, of the muscles and of the nervous system. He was also an anthropologist, whose studies of the human cranium led to the classifications dolichocephalic and brachycephalic. He was considered to be very knowledgeable and was elected into many of the scientific academies at the time. He is credited with defining the cephalic index, which is the ratio of width to length of one&#x27;s head.

Retzius was a polygenist. Retzius studied many different skull types from different races; because the skulls were so different from each race, he believed that the races had a separate origin.

The retropubic space of Retzius is named after him. The peritoneum lies deep to the posterior layer of transversalis fascia and is very adherent to it. Distally, this close contact remains in the area lateral to the epigastrics. Medially, however, the peritoneum reflects on the roof of the bladder and runs sharply dorsally, away from the deep layer of transversalis fascia. The separation of transversalis fascia and peritoneum contains loose fatty tissue allowing for the filling of the bladder. This space is called the retropubic space of Retzius (from the Clinic of Digestive Surgery, University Hospital St-Pierre, Brussels).

Retzius was active in the temperance movement, engaging himself in the battle against the Swedish drinking habits – which at this time had a significant impact on Swedish society – with works on the harmful effects liquor has on the body. Along with , , Jöns Jacob Berzelius, Samuel Owen, George Scott, and others, he was one of the founders of Svenska Nykterhetssällskapet, the Swedish Temperance Society, in 1837.

In 1826, he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

The Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography previously awarded the Anders Retzius Medal in Gold to world-leading scholars in human geography and anthropology. In 2015, the Society decided that it was inappropriate to award a medal in Retzius&#x27;s name considering his contributions to phrenology.

He was the father of Gustaf Retzius.

Retzius died in Stockholm in 1860.

<doc id="492101" wikidata="Q5113978" url="?curid=492101" title="Functional abdominal pain syndrome">
<text>Functional abdominal pain syndrome (FAPS), chronic functional abdominal pain (CFAP), or centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome (CMAP) is a pain syndrome of the abdomen, that has been present for at least six months, is not well connected to gastrointestinal function, and is accompanied by some loss of everyday activities. The discomfort is persistent, near-constant, or regularly reoccurring. The absence of symptom association with food intake or defecation distinguishes functional abdominal pain syndrome from other functional gastrointestinal illnesses, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional dyspepsia.

Functional abdominal pain syndrome is a functional gastrointestinal disorder meaning that it is not associated with any organic or structural pathology. Theories on the mechanisms behind functional abdominal pain syndrome include changes in descending modulation, central sensitization of the spinal dorsal horn, peripheral enhancement of the visceral pain afferent signal, and, central amplification.

The diagnosis of functional abdominal pain syndrome is made based on clinical features and diagnostic criteria. A thorough clinical history must be taken to accurately diagnose functional abdominal pain syndrome. Diagnostic testing to rule out organic disorders should only be done when alarm features are present. Differential diagnosis of functional abdominal pain syndrome includes a variety of other functional gastrointestinal disorders.

There is no well-established treatment for functional abdominal pain syndrome. General measures such as a positive physician-patient relationship are beneficial. Antidepressants are often used to treat other functional gastrointestinal disorders and may be helpful in treating functional abdominal pain syndrome. Psychological interventions including various forms of therapy can also be helpful. While the exact presence of functional abdominal pain syndrome is unknown studies show that it affects between 0.5% and 2% of North Americans. Functional abdominal pain syndrome is more common in women than men and usually occurs in the fourth decade of life.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Functional abdominal pain syndrome is characterized by frequent or chronic stomach pain and a reduction in everyday activity. The pain is persistent, near-constant, or regularly reoccurring. The pain is not related to food intake or defecation. Functional abdominal pain is usually periumbilical and is not accompanied by weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, nocturnal symptoms, or slowed growth. Typically, the level of abdominal pain in functional abdominal pain syndrome seldom varies, with maximum pain being felt the majority of the time. functional abdominal pain syndrome is frequently coupled with a proclivity to experience and report additional somatic symptoms of discomfort, such as chronic pain believed to be connected to the gynecological or urinary systems.

== Causes ==
Functional abdominal pain syndrome is a functional gastrointestinal disorder. Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGD) are common medical conditions characterized by recurrent and persistent gastrointestinal symptoms caused by improper functioning of the enteric system in the absence of any identifiable organic or structural pathology, such as ulcers, inflammation, tumors or masses.

== Mechanism ==
The pain from functional abdominal pain syndrome is thought to be caused by changes in descending modulation, central sensitization of the spinal dorsal horn, peripheral enhancement of the visceral pain afferent signal, and, lastly, central amplification.

Peripheral sensitization, also known as elevated ascending visceral afferent signalling, can happen following GI tract inflammation or damage. For example, about one-third of individuals with IBS report that their symptoms started after an acute infection episode; this is a phenomenon known as postinfectious IBS (PI-IBS). PI-IBS has consistently been linked to the existence of a low-grade inflammatory infiltrate. According to theory, this inflammatory infiltration results in increased sensitivity and field of peripheral receptors, the latter of which causes hyperalgesia by recruiting and activating nociceptors that were previously silent. Furthermore, it was discovered that the best indicators of who would develop PI-IBS were stress, as measured by traumatic life events, and a neurotic personality features. These convergent lines of data support the hypothesis that inflammation and/or injury in a psychologically predisposed person may cause visceral afferents to become peripherally sensitized, increasing the amount of nociceptive information that ascends to the spinal dorsal horn.

Peripheral nociceptors become more sensitive, which increases the amount of impulses that reach the spinal dorsal horn. Central sensitization may result from an increase in the frequency and amplitude of peripheral signals that reach the spinal dorsal horn. An increase in presynaptic glutamate release causes central sensitization by removing the magnesium ion block of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. The end result is an overall increase in dorsal horn neuron responsiveness, which frequently lasts longer than the initial shock when combined with the activation of other important enzymes.

The anterior cingulate cortex is home to the majority of the central descending modulatory systems. These modulatory systems allow afferent signals from the periphery to be gated, which allows for the amplification or even restriction of the signal. They interface with the spinal dorsal horn. The pro-nociceptive condition that characterizes many chronic visceral pain syndromes is thought to be mostly caused by anomalies in the descending pain modulatory system.

== Diagnosis ==
Since pain is the primary symptom of functional abdominal pain syndrome, obtaining a complete medical history and conducting a comprehensive physical examination continue to be essential components of the diagnosing process. The functional abdominal pain syndrome patient should be asked to provide a thorough history that thoroughly examines the timeline of pain occurrences, especially in connection with surgery, infection, or traumatic life events.

In a patient with functional abdominal pain syndrome, the clinical examination should be normal by definition. Nonetheless, as a starting point, it is important to look closely for the existence of abdominal scars from prior operations or investigations. Similarly, Carnett&#x27;s sign, which involves palpating a sore spot both before and after the patient tenses their abdominal wall, could be helpful.

Diagnostic testing to rule out organic disease should not be done frequently in the absence of alarm signs, similar to other functional GI problems (ie, unexplained weight loss, bloody bowel movements, abdominal mass, anorexia). If the physical examination yields negative results, no more diagnostic testing is necessary.

The Rome IV diagnostic criteria for functional abdominal pain syndrome is as follows:

# Constant or almost constant abdominal pain.
# There is either no correlation or a very weak one between pain and physiological processes (e.g., eating, feces or menses).
# Some aspects of daily functioning are limited by pain.
# Pain is not feigned.
# No other medical illness or structural or functional gastrointestinal issue may account for the pain.

To fit the Rome IV diagnostic criteria for functional abdominal pain syndrome the patient must fit all of the above criteria and the criteria must be met over the past three months, with the onset of symptoms occurring at least six months before diagnosis.

When diagnosing functional abdominal pain syndrome, a number of other functional GI illnesses should be taken into account initially. IBS may be taken into consideration if the pain is accompanied by changes in bowel motions (frequent, loose stools or harder, infrequent stools). Functional gall bladder disease or sphincter of Oddi dysfunction should be considered if the pain is significant, occurs at different intervals (not daily), and is located in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium. Consider functional dyspepsia if the discomfort is in the epigastrium and does not meet the criteria for functional gallbladder disease.

== Treatment ==
There is no definite agreement on how to best manage functional abdominal pain syndrome in adults. As a result, the majority of currently employed therapies are founded on data and firsthand knowledge from other functional bowel diseases and chronic pain syndromes. It is helpful to categorize therapy modalities into three groups: psychological interventions, pharmaceutical therapies, and general measures.

The doctor-patient interaction is essential to the management of a patient with functional abdominal pain syndrome and to a successful outcome. A crucial component of treatment is, in particular, validating a patient&#x27;s symptoms in a caring, interdisciplinary setting. In the framework of routine outpatient reviews, the patient and the doctor should also decide on and establish realistic treatment goals.

Antidepressants, especially low-dose tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), have been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders and chronic pain. They may also be helpful in the treatment of functional abdominal pain syndrome due to their dual effects of direct pain management and antidepressant properties.

Trials utilizing tricyclic antidepressants have generally outperformed those using selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors in other chronic pain disorders. Venlafaxine and duloxetine are two examples of more recent medications with combined serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), which have been shown to reduce pain in some somatic pain disorders and may be helpful in functional abdominal pain syndrome. Patients with co-occurring anxiety and depression may benefit from both SNRIs and selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The majority of analgesics, such as aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, don&#x27;t really help much, maybe because they mostly have peripheral effects. Because of the risk of addiction and narcotic bowel syndrome, narcotic analgesics should be avoided.

There hasn&#x27;t been a study explicitly looking at adult functional abdominal pain syndrome and psychological therapy. Studies on non-gastrointestinal pain diseases and other painful functional gastrointestinal illnesses, however, point to the potential benefit of psychological therapies. Stress management, hypnosis, dynamic or interpersonal psychotherapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy are among the interventions that may prove advantageous. The most effective way to manage impairment resulting from refractory chronic pain may be to refer patients to pain treatment clinics for multidisciplinary treatment programs. While the previously discussed psychological treatments have demonstrated improvements in mood, coping, quality of life, and health care costs, their effect on specific visceral or somatic symptoms is less clear, indicating that their most effective application may be in conjunction with symptomatic treatment.

== Epidemiology ==
Due to a lack of data and methodological challenges in distinguishing functional abdominal pain syndrome from other more prevalent functional gastrointestinal diseases like IBS and functional dyspepsia, the epidemiology of the disease is not fully understood. Nonetheless, compared to functional dyspepsia or IBS, functional abdominal pain syndrome is generally thought to be a less frequent. The stated prevalence rates in North America are between 0.5% and 2%, and they are consistent with reports from other nations. The condition affects women more frequently than men (3:2), with a peak in prevalence occurring in the fourth decade of life.

<text>Count Mikhail Petrovich Bestuzhev-Ryumin (Михаи́л Петро́вич Бесту́жев-Рю́мин; 1688 in Moscow – 1760 in Paris) was a Russian diplomat. He was the son of Pyotr Bestuzhev-Ryumin and elder brother of the more famous Aleksey Bestuzhev.

Mikhail Bestuzhev was brought up with his brother in Berlin. In 1705, Peter the Great commanded him to join the Russian embassy in Copenhagen. Fifteen years later, he became the Russian resident in England, which — despite an earlier obligation to the contrary — presently entered an alliance with Sweden. As the Great Northern War between Russia and Sweden was still going on, Bestuzhev attempted to interfere but was ordered by the English government to leave the country.

He then settled in the Hague, until the Treaty of Nystad concluded the war in 1721. Thereupon he was appointed Minister Plenipotentiary in Stockholm, a position which he filled with notable success. During his tenure, Sweden recognized Russia as an empire and concluded a defensive alliance with her for 12 years. Catherine I of Russia, however, ordered him to move to Warsaw in 1726, while Empress Anna removed him to Berlin before having him returned to Stockholm in 1732. Although the alliance with Sweden was prolonged, Bestuzhev was exposed to street violence more than once and was briefly taken into custody when the new Russo-Swedish War erupted in 1741.

Upon his release, Bestuzhev proceeded to Hanover to confer with George II of Great Britain. At this time, Empress Elizabeth usurped the throne and appointed Bestuzhev her agent in Warsaw. In 1743, he married Golovkin&#x27;s daughter, Anna Bestuzheva, who was soon involved into the Lopukhina Affair, which resulted in her tongue being torn out. 
During the investigation of his wife&#x27;s behaviour, Bestuzhev was held under house arrest. 
When he was finally allowed to go abroad, his powerful brother procured for him a series of lucrative appointments. He successively served as the Russian ambassador in Berlin, Warsaw, Vienna, and Paris, where he died.

<doc id="492107" wikidata="Q7054461" url="?curid=492107" title="North Carolina Council of State">
<text>The North Carolina Council of State is the collective body of ten elective executive offices in the state government of North Carolina, all of which are established by the state constitution. The Council of State includes the governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, state auditor, treasurer, superintendent of public instruction, attorney general, commissioner of agriculture, commissioner of labor, and commissioner of insurance. Together with the North Carolina Cabinet and several independent agencies, the Council of State offices constitute the executive branch of North Carolina&#x27;s state government.

The body has its origin in the British colonial government of North Carolina. Under North Carolina&#x27;s first constitution as a U.S. state, the Council of State comprised seven persons elected by the North Carolina General Assembly to advise the governor. The 1868 constitution redefined the Council of State as the secretary of state, state treasurer, state auditor, superintendent of public works, and superintendent of public instruction. The superintendent of public works was soon abolished, additional elective offices were later added, and the governor was made a formal member of the council. The Council of State usually meets monthly and is responsible for approving various transactions concerning state real property and finances.

==History==
As a British colony, the Province of North Carolina was under the leadership of a royal governor. A Governor&#x27;s Council was created to advise the governor, and it comprised residents of the colony appointed by the lords proprietors and eventually the British Crown. The body also served as the upper house of the colonial legislature when it was in session. One member served as president of the council, and could take charge of the colony if the governor or their deputy were unable to exercise their duties. The president, in their legislative capacity, also signed all laws passed by the legislature. Vacancies on the council were filled by the governor&#x27;s interim appointment until the lords or the Crown made a new appointment. In practice, many councilors held other government offices and often competed with the governor and the lower house of the legislature for authority. As a body, the council held great influence over the content of executive decrees, the dispensation of patronage, and the awarding of land grants.

North Carolina declared independence from Great Britain in 1776. Its first constitution, ratified in December, provided for a Council of State to &quot;advise the Governor in the execution of his office&quot;. The council consisted of seven persons selected by both houses of the North Carolina General Assembly in a joint vote for a one-year term. The councilors were barred from holding legislative office. Vacancies on the council could only be filled by the General Assembly. In practice, the Council of State limited the governor&#x27;s executive authority, as sometimes the governor was required to get their approval before taking a course of action. The council itself could not take action without the governor. The first council was elected by the constitutional convention in December 1776 and took office the following year, serving until they were replaced by the General Assembly&#x27;s choices.

A new constitution was adopted in 1868, and provided that the Council of State should consist of six popularly-elected executive officials serving &quot;ex officio&quot;: the secretary of state, state auditor, state treasurer, superintendent of public works, and superintendent of public instruction. Under the constitution, the governor called and presided over the council&#x27;s meetings and the attorney general served as its legal advisor, but neither were formally members of it. The office of superintendent of public works was abolished via constitutional amendment in 1873. The popularly-elected offices of the commissioner of agriculture, commissioner of labor, and commissioner of insurance were elevated to constitutional status in 1944 and added to the council. Constitutional revisions which took effect in 1971 made the governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general all &quot;ex officio&quot; members of the council. The revisions also eliminated the responsibility of the council to &quot;advise the Governor in the execution of his office&quot;. In 1987, Governor James G. Martin sued the other members of the Council of State during a dispute over securing a leasing agreement for government office space. The North Carolina Supreme Court ruled that the Council of State could block decisions of the governor, but it could not take positive action on its own accord.

Most Council of State members have historically been white men. Ralph Campbell Jr., who assumed the office of state auditor in 1993, was the first black person to serve on the Council of State. Janice H. Faulkner was the first woman to serve on the council, having been appointed secretary of state to fill a vacancy in 1996. Elaine Marshall, who became Secretary of State in January 1997, was the first woman elected to a Council of State office. Jessica Holmes was the first black woman to serve on the council, having been appointed state auditor to fill a vacancy in 2023.

== Structure ==
The Council of State comprises the holders of the ten offices established by Article III of the Constitution of North Carolina: governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, state auditor, state treasurer, superintendent of public instruction, attorney general, commissioner of agriculture, commissioner of labor, and commissioner of insurance. All serve as the chief executive of their respective departments. They are elected to four-year terms and, aside from the governor and lieutenant governor, without term limits. Contested elections for any of these offices are resolved by a majority vote of the General Assembly. In the event of a vacancy in any of the offices aside from that of the governor and lieutenant governor, the governor can appoint an interim official until the next biennial state election. The office of governor is subject to its own line of succession. Council of State officers can be impeached and removed from office for malfeasance by the General Assembly. The officers&#x27; salaries are fixed by the General Assembly and cannot be reduced during their terms of office. Together with the North Carolina Cabinet and several independent agencies, the Council of State offices constitute the executive branch of North Carolina&#x27;s state government.

The governor serves as the chairman of the Council of State. The body routinely meets the first or second Tuesday of every month in sessions subject to the state&#x27;s open meeting law which the public can attend. The governor also sometimes consults the rest of the council over email during emergencies or otherwise unanticipated situations. The council retains a staff, which records the minutes of each meeting and supplies them to the council members. The secretary of state maintains the schedule and agenda of council meetings. The 2022 state budget includes plans for the construction of a permanent meeting place for the council to begin in 2023.

== Powers and duties ==
The Constitution of North Carolina assigns minimal duties to the Council of State; per Article III, Section 3, it may call the General Assembly into an extraordinary session to consider the governor&#x27;s mental capacity, and, per Article III, Section 5, the governor must consult it before they call the assembly into an extraordinary session. The council&#x27;s most significant responsibilities have been assigned by statute, most dealing with real property and financial transactions. This includes approving the governor&#x27;s acquisitions and disposals of state property, approving property allocations, authorizing taking on debt in anticipation of tax revenue, authorizing the state treasurer to borrow money in times of crisis, creating emergency funds, approving bond issues, and advising the governor and treasurer on assurance investments, approving of banks in which state funds can be deposited, and approving securities in which state funds may be invested. If the governor exercises a power or authority which requires the concurrence of the council, they are required by law to secure the body&#x27;s approval within 48 hours of exercising said power.

<text>John Taylor (October 6, 1836 – February 10, 1909) was an American businessman and politician who served in the New Jersey Senate. He created pork roll in 1856 and formed Taylor Provisions Company in 1888, establishing the brand &quot;Taylor&#x27;s Prepared Ham&quot;, sometimes called Taylor Ham. He also founded the Taylor Opera House in Trenton, New Jersey. Taylor Street in Trenton is also named for him.

Taylor was born in Hamilton Square, New Jersey, in 1836. His father James F. Taylor, owner of a brick yard, died when John was fourteen. Taylor entered the grocery business as a store clerk at seventeen. He quickly earned an interest with his company but left after a year to form his own partnership with James Ronan, which lasted for two years before Taylor bought Ronan&#x27;s share. From 1860 through 1870, he worked in the wholesale grocery business in association with D.P. Forst. Shortly thereafter, Taylor began working in the pork and cattle packaging industry. This enterprise was organized into the Taylor Provision Company in 1888.

Taylor was a Republican active in Trenton&#x27;s City Council, where he served as chairman of the finance committee. He was elected to the New Jersey Senate for Mercer County, serving from 1880 to 1883. He declined a second term. He helped to abolish the street markets of New Jersey, and organized the Inter-State Fair in 1888.

In 1860, he married Catherine Rowley who later bore him two sons: Harry C., born in September 1864, and William T., October 1869. He is buried in Riverview Cemetery in Trenton.

<text>Taylor Opera House was an opera house in Trenton, New Jersey. It was the city&#x27;s first theater, and was founded by John Taylor, creator of Pork Roll and one of Trenton&#x27;s leading citizens. The building first opened March 18, 1867 at 18 S. Broad Street. A historical marker was placed on the site after its demolition.

The theater presented the major speakers and performers of the day, including Mark Twain, Ethel Barrymore, and George M. Cohan, and played host to political conventions, Bible conferences, musical revues and local meetings and events. It hosted the inaugurations of Governor George B. McClellan in 1877, and Woodrow Wilson in 1910, James F. Fielder in 1914 and Walter Evans Edge in 1917.

In 1921, it was converted into a movie and vaudeville palace known as Keith&#x27;s Capitol Theatre; after later sales it was renamed the RKO International.

The theater was razed by its next door neighbor (the Trenton Saving Fund Society) to create a parking lot in 1969.

A mural that was originally displayed at the opera house was rediscovered after a search began in 2021. Painted by George Matthews Harding in 1921 titled, &quot;Washington Crossing the Delaware&quot;, the 16x10 foot painting was lost after it was put into storage having been deemed too large to display at another museum.

<text>Horseless carriage is an early name for the motor car or automobile. Prior to the invention of the motor car, carriages were usually pulled by animals, typically horses. The term can be compared to other transitional terms, such as wireless phone. These are cases in which a new technology is compared to an older one by describing what the new one does not have.

Most horseless carriages are notable for their similarity to existing horse-drawn carriages, but with some type of mechanical propulsion. Features of the first horseless carriages include tiller steering, an engine under the floorboards, and a high center of gravity.

In the 19th century, steam engines became the primary source of power for railway locomotives and ships, and for powering processes in fixed installations such as factories. In 1803, what is said to have been the first horseless carriage was a steam-driven vehicle demonstrated in London, England, by Richard Trevithick. In the 1820s, Goldsworthy Gurney built steam-powered road vehicles. One has survived to be on display at Glasgow Museum of Transport. In the United States, a four-wheel steam carriage was made by Sylvester H. Roper in 1863.

The 1896 Armstrong horseless carriage is notable as an early hybrid vehicle, which combined an electric motor with battery and gasoline-fueled internal-combustion engine.

In 1893, Frank Duryea is reported to have made the first horseless carriage trip on U.S. roads, in Springfield, Massachusetts, traveling approximately before engine problems forced him to stop and make repairs. He went on to found the first U.S. car company, the Duryea Motor Wagon Company, with his brother.

In April 2016, horseless carriages from the turn of 19th and the early 20th centuries were featured in a re-creation of the first London Motor Show in 1896.

<text>Prince Vasiliy Lukich Dolgorukov (; 1672 8 November 1739) was a Russian diplomat and political minister who was the most powerful man in the country in the later years of Peter II&#x27;s reign.

A male-line descendant of the legendary prince Rurik, Dolgorukov was one of the first batch of young Russians whom Peter the Great sent abroad to be educated. From 1687 to 1700 he resided in Paris, where he learned thoroughly the principal European languages, acquired the superficial elegance of the court of Versailles, and associated with the Jesuits, whose moral system he is said to have appropriated. He began his diplomatic career as his uncle Yakov Fyodorovich&#x27;s aide. He also accompanied another uncle Grigory Fyodorovich on a mission to Poland.

On his return home he entered the diplomatic service. From 1706 to 1707 he represented Russia in Poland; and from 1707 to 1720 he was appointed minister in Copenhagen. There, he succeeded in persuading King Frederick IV to join the second coalition against Charles XII in the Treaty of Copenhagen (1709). At the end of 1720 he was transferred to Versailles, in order to seek the mediation of France in the projected negotiations with Sweden and obtain the recognition of Peter&#x27;s imperial title by the French court. In 1724 he represented Russia in Warsaw and in 1726 in Stockholm, the object of the latter mission being to detach Sweden from the Hanoverian alliance, in which he did not succeed.

During the reign of Peter II, Dolgorukov was appointed a member of the Supreme Privy Council. After procuring the banishment of Menshikov he drew up a letter purporting to be the last will of the emperor, appointing Catherine Dolgorukova his successor, but shortly afterwards abandoned the nefarious scheme as impracticable, and was one of the first to support the election of Anne of Courland to the throne on condition that she first signed nine &quot;articles of limitation&quot;, which left the supreme power in the hands of the Russian council.

Anne, who repudiated the &quot;articles&quot; on the first opportunity, never forgave Dolgorukov for this. He was deprived of all his offices and dignities on April 17, 1730, and banished first to his country seat and then to the Solovetsky Monastery. Nine years later the charge of forging the will of Peter II was revived against him, and he was tortured and then beheaded in Novgorod on November 8, 1739.

<text>Oldenburg in Holstein () is a German town at the southwestern shore of the Baltic Sea. The nearest city is Lübeck. The town belongs to the (historical) region of Holstein, today in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein.

Oldenburg was the chief town of the Wagrians, one of the Slavic peoples that migrated as far west as the river Elbe in or after the 6th century (see Völkerwanderung), also known as Wends and Obotrites. They arrived about A.D. 700 and the Pomeranian/Kashubian (Slavic) name was &#x27; or&#x27;, meaning &quot;Old Settlement&quot;, &quot;Old Castle&quot;, &quot;Old City/Town&quot;; the German name &quot; is of Low German origin and carries the same meaning. The Obotrites were allies of Charlemagne. Emperor Otto I established the bishopric of Oldenburg under Adaldag, archbishop of Hamburg.

To the Northern Germanic Vikings, the city was known as &quot;, i.e. &quot;the burned houses&quot;, indicating the bellicose times.

For centuries, Starigard/Oldenburg remained the Slavic competitor of Hedeby on the Baltic trade, until the counts Adolph I and Adolph II of Schauenburg and Holstein, supported by Henry the Lion, finally defeated the Wends during the first half of the 12th century.

The modern town has a partnership with Bergen auf Rügen in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Oldenburg in Holstein is twinned with:
* Bergen auf Rügen, Germany (1990)
* Palanga, Lithuania (2016)
* Blain, France (2017)

<doc id="492128" wikidata="Q381072" url="?curid=492128" title="Crisis">
<text>A crisis (: crises; : critical) is any event or period that will lead to an unstable and dangerous situation affecting an individual, group, or all of society. Crises are negative changes in the human or environmental affairs, especially when they occur abruptly, with little or no warning. More loosely, a crisis is a testing time for an emergency.

==Etymology==

The English word &quot;crisis&quot; was borrowed from the Latin, which in turn was borrowed from the Greek &quot;krisis&quot; &#x27;discrimination, decision, crisis&#x27;. The noun is derived from the verb &quot;krinō&quot;, which means &#x27;distinguish, choose, decide&#x27;.

In English, &quot;crisis&quot; was first used in a medical context, for the time in the development of a disease when a change indicates either recovery or death, that is, a turning-point. It was also used for a major change in the development of a disease. By the mid-seventeenth century, it took on the figurative meaning of a &quot;vitally important or decisive stage in the progress of anything&quot;, especially a period of uncertainty or difficulty, without necessarily having the implication of a decision-point.

== Definition ==
A crisis is often linked to the concept of psychological stress and used to suggest a frightening or fraught experience. In general, crisis is the situation of a &quot;complex system&quot; when the system functions poorly (the system still functions, but does not break down), an immediate decision is necessary to stop the further disintegration of the system, but the causes of the dysfunction are not immediately identified (the causes are so many, or unknown, that it is impossible to take a rational, informed decision to reverse the situation). By &quot;complex system&quot; we mean something like a family, economy, or society; simple systems do not enter crises. We can speak about a crisis of moral values, an economical or political crisis, but not a motor crisis.

The crisis has several defining characteristics. Seeger, Sellnow, and Ulmer say that crises have four defining characteristics that are &quot;specific, unexpected, and non-routine events or series of events that [create] high levels of uncertainty and threat or perceived threat to an organization&#x27;s high priority goals.&quot; Thus the first three characteristics are that the event is 
:1. unexpected (i.e., a surprise)
:2. creates uncertainty
:3. is seen as a threat to important goals
:Venette argues that &quot;crisis is a process of transformation where the old system can no longer be maintained.&quot; Therefore the fourth defining quality is the need for change. If change is not needed, the event could more accurately be described as a failure.

Apart from natural crises that are inherently unpredictable (volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, etc.) most of the crises that we face are created by man. Hence the requirements of their being &#x27;unexpected&#x27; depend upon man failing to note the onset of crisis conditions. Some of our inability to recognize crises before they become dangerous is due to denial and other psychological responses that provide succor and protection for our emotions.

A different set of reasons for failing to notice the onset of crises is that we allow ourselves to be &#x27;tricked&#x27; into believing that we are doing something for reasons that are false. In other words, we are doing the wrong things for the right reasons. For example, we might believe that we are solving the threats of climate change by engaging in economic trading activity that has no real impact on the climate. Mitroff and Silvers posit two reasons for these mistakes, which they classify as Type 3 (inadvertent) and Type 4 (deliberate) errors.

The effect of our inability to attend to the likely results of our actions can result in a crisis.

From this perspective, we might usefully learn that failing to understand the real causes of our difficulties is likely to lead to repeated downstream &#x27;blowback&#x27;. Where states are concerned, Michael Brecher, based on case studies of the International Crisis Behavior (ICB) project, suggested a different way of defining crisis as conditions are perceptions held by the highest level decision-makers of the actor concerned:
1. threat to basic values, with a or subsequent
2. high probability of involvement in military hostilities, and the awareness of
3. finite time for response to the external value threat.

===Chinese word for &quot;crisis&quot;===

It is frequently said in Western motivational speaking that the Chinese word for &quot;crisis&quot; is composed of two Chinese characters signifying &quot;danger&quot; and &quot;opportunity&quot; respectively. This is, however, considered by linguists to be a misperception.

==Political crisis==

== Economic ==

An &quot;economic crisis&quot; is a sharp transition to a recession. See for example 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, Argentine economic crisis (1999–2002), South American economic crisis of 2002, Economic crisis of Cameroon. Crisis theory is a central achievement in the conclusions of Karl Marx&#x27;s critique of Capital.

A financial crisis may be a banking crisis or currency crisis.

== Environmental ==
Crises pertaining to the environment include:

=== Environmental disaster ===
An environmental disaster is a disaster that is due to human activity and should not be confused with natural disasters &quot;(see below)&quot;. In this case, the impact of humans&#x27; alteration of the ecosystem has led to widespread and/or long-lasting consequences. It can include the deaths of animals (including humans) and plant systems, or severe disruption of human life, possibly requiring migration.

=== Natural disaster ===
A &quot;natural disaster&quot; is the consequence of a natural hazard (e.g. volcanic eruption, earthquake, landslide) which moves from potential in to an active phase, and as a result affects human activities. Human vulnerability, exacerbated by the lack of planning or lack of appropriate emergency management, leads to financial, structural, and human losses. The resulting loss depends on the capacity of the population to support or resist the disaster, their resilience. This understanding is concentrated in the formulation: &quot;disasters occur when hazards meet vulnerability&quot;. A natural hazard will hence never result in a natural disaster in areas without vulnerability, e.g. strong earthquakes in uninhabited areas.

For lists of natural disasters, see the list of disasters or the list of deadliest natural disasters.

=== Endangered species ===
An &quot;endangered species&quot; is a population of an organism which is at risk of becoming extinct because it is either few in number, or threatened by changing environmental or predation parameters. An endangered species is usually a taxonomic species, but may be another evolutionary significant unit. The World Conservation Union (IUCN) has classified 38 percent of the 44,837 species assessed by 2008 as threatened.

== International ==
For information about crises in the field of study in international relations, see crisis management and international crisis. In this context, a crisis can be loosely defined as a situation where there is a perception of threat, heightened anxiety, expectation of possible violence and the belief that any actions will have far-reaching consequences (Lebow, 7–10).

== Personal ==
A personal crisis occurs when an individual can no longer cope with a situation. This is preceded by events of an extraordinary nature triggering extreme tension and stress within an individual, i.e., the crisis, which then requires major decisions or actions to resolve. Crises can be triggered by a wide range of situations including, but not limited to, extreme weather conditions, sudden change in employment/financial state, medical emergencies, long-term illness, and social or familial turmoil. Crises are simply a change in the events that comprise the day-to-day life of a person and those in their close circle, such as the loss of a job, extreme financial hardship, substance addiction/abuse, and other situations that are life-altering and require action that is outside the &quot;normal&quot; daily routine. A person going through a crisis experiences a state of mental disequilibrium, in which the ego struggles to balance both internal and external demands. In this case, said person resorts to coping mechanisms to deal with the stress. Various coping mechanisms include:
* High emotions (crying, physical withdrawal)
* Defence mechanisms (denial, repression)
* Making rash decisions
* Acting out
* Putting things on hold

In some cases, it is difficult for an individual undergoing a crisis to adapt to the situation. As it is outside of their normal range of functioning, it is common that one endures a struggle to control emotions. This lack of control can lead to suicidal tendencies, substance abuse, trouble with the law and general avoidance of resources available for help. One such resource used to aid an individual in crisis is their social support system, which can come in the form of family, friends, coworkers, or health professionals. It is important that a support system consists of people that the individual trusts. Although these support systems play a crucial role in aiding an individual through a crisis, they are also the underlying cause of two thirds of mental health crises. The aforementioned mental health crises can include marital issues, abandonment, parental conflict and family struggles.

In order to aid someone in a crisis, it is crucial to be able to identify the signs that indicate they are undergoing an internal conflict. These signs, as well as the aforementioned coping mechanisms, include:
* Irrational and/or narrow thinking
* Lowered attention span
* Unclear motives
* Disorganized approach to problem-solving
* Resistance to communication
* Inability to differentiate between large and small issues
* Change/alteration to social networks

===Ways to manage a crisis===
As aforementioned, a crisis to this day can be overcome by implementing mechanisms such as: sleep, rejection, physical exercise, meditation and thinking. To assist individuals in regaining emotional equilibrium, intervention can be used. The overall goal of crisis intervention is to get the individual back to a pre-crisis level of functioning or higher with the help of a social support group. As said by Judith Swan, there&#x27;s a strong correlation between the client&#x27;s emotional balance and the trust in their support system in helping them throughout their crisis. The steps of crisis intervention are: to assess the situation based on behavior patterns of the individual, decide what type of help is needed (make a plan of action), and finally to take action/intervention, based on the individual&#x27;s skills to regain equilibrium. In the context of natural disasters and other climate change-related crises, emotional activation is common. Collective processing of emotional experiences is an important part of enabling individuals to increase in their resilience, leading to greater community engagement and a sense of belongingness. When appropriate support for emotional experiences is provided, climate change-induced emotions are adaptive.

The Registered Nurses’ Association of Ontario proposed the ABC model for dealing with client&#x27;s interventions in crises:
===Benefits of listening in a crisis===
Moreover, another method for helping individuals who are suffering in a crisis is active listening; it is defined as seeing circumstances from another perspective and letting the other person know that the negotiator (the helper) understands their perspective. Through this, they establish trust and rapport by demonstrating empathy, understanding, and objectivity in a non-judgmental way. It is important for the negotiator to listen to verbal and non-verbal reactions of the person in need, in order to be able to label the emotion that the individual is showing. Thus, this demonstrates that the helper is tuned in emotionally. Furthermore, there are other techniques that can be used to demonstrate active listening such as paraphrasing, silence, and reflecting or mirroring. The goal in active listening is to keep the person talking about their situation.

== In chaos theory==
When the control parameter of a chaotic system is modified, the chaotic attractor touches an unstable
periodic orbit inside the basin of attraction inducing a sudden expansion in the attractor.
This phenomenon is termed as interior crisis in a chaotic system.

<doc id="492132" wikidata="Q1123997" url="?curid=492132" title="Waldorf Astoria New York">
<text>The Waldorf Astoria New York is a luxury hotel and condominium residence in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City, United States. The structure, at 301 Park Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets, is a 47-story, Art Deco landmark designed by architects Schultze and Weaver and completed in 1931. The building was the world&#x27;s tallest hotel until 1957, when it was surpassed by Moscow&#x27;s Hotel Ukraina. An icon of glamor and luxury, the Waldorf Astoria is one of the world&#x27;s most prestigious and best-known hotels. Once owned by Conrad Hilton, Waldorf Astoria Hotels &amp; Resorts, a division of Hilton Hotels, operates under the name of the original hotel in locations around the world. Both the exterior and the interior of the Waldorf Astoria are designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission as official landmarks.

The original Waldorf-Astoria was built in two stages along Fifth Avenue and opened in 1893. It was demolished in 1929 to make way for the construction of the Empire State Building. Conrad Hilton acquired management rights to the hotel on October 12, 1949, and the Hilton Hotels Corporation bought the hotel outright in 1972. It underwent a $150 million renovation ($ in dollars) by Lee Jablin in the 1980s and early 1990s. The Anbang Insurance Group of China purchased the Waldorf Astoria New York for $1.95 billion in 2014, making it the most expensive hotel ever sold. The Waldorf Astoria closed in 2017 for renovations. The upper stories were converted into 375 condominiums, while the lowest 18 floors will retain 375 hotel rooms. Dajia Insurance Group took over the Waldorf Astoria when Anbang went bankrupt in 2020, and, after several delays, the hotel is not expected to reopen until early 2025.

In 2009, the Waldorf Astoria and Towers had 1,416 rooms. The main hotel had 1,235 single and double rooms and 208 mini-suites. The Waldorf Towers on the 28th to 42nd floors had 181 rooms, of which 115 were suites with one to four bedrooms. The most expensive room, the Presidential Suite, was designed with Georgian-style furniture to emulate that of the White House. The hotel has three main restaurants: Peacock Alley, The Bull &amp; Bear Steak House, and La Chine—a Chinese restaurant that replaced Oscar&#x27;s Brasserie in late 2015. Sir Harry&#x27;s Bar in the hotel, is named after British explorer Sir Harry Johnston.

The Waldorf Astoria has been known for its lavish dinner parties and galas, often at the center of political and business conferences and fundraising schemes involving the rich and famous. After World War II, it played a significant role in world politics and the Cold War, culminating in the controversial World Peace Conference of March 1949. The Presidential Suite was the residence of Herbert Hoover from his retirement for over 30 years, and Frank Sinatra kept a suite at the Waldorf from 1979 until 1988. Some of the luxury suites were named after celebrities who lived or stayed in them, including Cole Porter, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Douglas MacArthur, and Winston Churchill.

==Name==
The name of the hotel is ultimately derived from the town of Walldorf, which lies in the north of the German state of Baden-Württemberg, south of Mannheim and Heidelberg. The name of the town is derived from the German words , meaning &quot;forest&quot;, and , meaning &quot;village&quot;. Walldorf is the ancestral home of the Astor family, the prominent German-American family that built the hotel.

The hotel was originally known as the Waldorf-Astoria with a single hyphen, as recalled by a popular expression and song, &quot;Meet Me at the Hyphen&quot;. The sign was changed to a double hyphen, looking similar to an equals sign, by Conrad Hilton when he purchased the hotel in 1949. The double hyphen visually represents &quot;Peacock Alley&quot;, the hallway between the two hotels that once stood where the Empire State building now stands today. The use of the double hyphen was discontinued by its parent company Hilton in 2009, shortly after the introduction of the Waldorf Astoria Hotels and Resorts chain.

==History==
===Original buildings===
The original hotel started as two hotels on Fifth Avenue built by feuding relatives. The first hotel, the 13-story, 450-room Waldorf Hotel, designed by Henry Janeway Hardenbergh in the German Renaissance style, was opened on March 13, 1893, at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 33rd Street, on the site where millionaire developer William Waldorf Astor had his mansion. The original hotel stood high, with a frontage of about on Fifth Avenue, with an area of . The original hotel was described as having a &quot;lofty stone and brick exterior&quot;, which was &quot;animated by an effusion of balconies, alcoves, arcades, and loggias beneath a tile roof bedecked with gables and turrets&quot;. William Astor, motivated in part by a dispute with his aunt Caroline Webster Schermerhorn Astor, had built the Waldorf Hotel next door to her house, on the site of his father&#x27;s mansion, hiring George Boldt as its first managers.

At first, the Waldorf appeared destined for failure. It was &quot;Astor&#x27;s Folly&quot;, with the general perception of the palatial hotel being that it had no place in New York City. Wealthy New Yorkers were angry, because they viewed the construction of the hotel as the ruination of a good neighborhood. Business travelers found it too expensive and too far uptown for their needs. However, the hotel became a major success, earning $4.5 million in its first year, exorbitant for that period.

William Astor&#x27;s construction of a hotel next to his aunt&#x27;s house worsened his feud with her, but with Boldt&#x27;s assistance, Waldorf&#x27;s cousin, John Jacob Astor IV, persuaded his mother to move uptown. On November 1, 1897, John Jacob Astor IV opened the 17-story Astoria Hotel on an adjacent site, and leased it to Boldt. The hotels were initially built as two separate structures, but Boldt planned the Astoria so it could be connected to the Waldorf by an alley, Peacock Alley, named for the parade of well-dressed, well-to-do people who strutted between the two fashionable buildings. The hotel subsequently became known as the &quot;Waldorf-Astoria&quot;, the largest hotel in the world at the time.

With a telephone in every room and first-class room service, the hotel was designed specifically to cater to the needs of the socially prominent &quot;wealthy upper crust&quot; of New York and distinguished foreign visitors to the city. The hotel became, according to author Sean Dennis Cashman, &quot;a successful symbol of the opulence and achievement of the Astor family&quot;. It was the first hotel to offer complete electricity and private bathrooms. Founding proprietor Boldt, whose motto was &quot;the guest is always right&quot;, became wealthy and prominent internationally, if not so much a popular celebrity as his famous employee, Oscar Tschirky, known as &quot;Oscar of the Waldorf&quot;, &quot;maître d&#x27;hôtel&quot; from the hotel&#x27;s inauguration in 1893 until his retirement in 1943. Tschirsky gained renown among the general public as an artist who &quot;composed sonatas in soups, symphonies in salads, minuets in sauces, lyrics in entrees&quot;. He had an encyclopedic memory of the culinary preferences of many of the guests, which further added to his popularity.

The Waldorf gained significant renown internationally for its fundraising dinners and balls, regularly attracting notables of the day such as Andrew Carnegie, who became a fixture. Banquets were often held in the ballroom for esteemed figures and international royalty. The Waldorf Astoria was influential in advancing the status of women, who could be admitted as single guests. One article in 1899 claimed that at any one time, the hotel had $7 million worth of valuables locked in the safe, testament to the wealth of its guests. Upon his death in 1919, William Waldorf Astor&#x27;s half-share of the Waldorf Astoria and the Astor Hotel were reported to have been worth £10 million. On the evening of November 15, 1926, the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) broadcast its inaugural program from the grand ballroom of the old Waldorf-Astoria.

The hotel faced stiff competition from the early 20th century, with a range of new hotels springing up in New York City such as the Hotel Astor (1904), St. Regis (1904), the Knickerbocker (1906), and the Savoy-Plaza Hotel (1927). By the 1920s, the hotel was becoming dated, and the elegant social life of New York had moved much farther north than 34th Street. The Astor family sold the hotel to the developers of the Empire State Building and closed the hotel on May 3, 1929. It was demolished soon after.

===Development of new location===
The idea of a new Waldorf-Astoria hotel was based on the concept that a large, opulent hotel should be available in New York for distinguished visitors. Financial backing was not difficult to get in the summer of 1929, as times were prosperous. The stock market had not yet crashed, nor had the Depression arrived. However, before ground was broken for the new building, some of the investors became dubious about whether this was the right time to be investing in a luxury hotel. The land for the new hotel was formerly owned by the New York Central Railroad, which had operated a power plant for Grand Central Terminal on the site. New York Central had promised $10 million toward the building of the new Waldorf-Astoria. The railroad and all the other investors decided to honor their commitments and take their chances with the uncertain financial climate. In October 1929, the Hotel Waldorf-Astoria Corporation obtained a 26-year lease from New York Central, and placed a $11 million first mortgage on the site.

On March 24, 1930, the first steel column in the new hotel was installed, and stonework installation began on June 3. The hotel&#x27;s construction required massive amounts of materials, including 10,000 metal door frames, 11 million bricks, of gypsum and terracotta partition blocks, and of concrete floors. The new Waldorf Astoria had gold-plated doorknobs on eight stories, and its guestrooms, totaling , made the hotel the most spacious in New York City. of steel were used, more than was used in the Woolworth Building. The hotel&#x27;s steel frame topped out, above street level, on October 22, 1930. The last stone on the Waldorf Astoria&#x27;s facade was installed at a ceremony on February 4, 1931.

On October 1, 1931, the new building opened on Park Avenue, between 49th and 50th streets, following a soft opening the previous day. It was the tallest and largest hotel in the world at the time, covering the entire block. The slender central tower became known as the Waldorf Towers, with its own private entrance on 50th Street, and consisted of 100 suites, about one-third of which were leased as private residences. NBC received the exclusive right to broadcast events and music from the hotel and to book live entertainment there. President Herbert Hoover said on the radio, broadcast from the White House: &quot;The opening of the new Waldorf Astoria is an event in the advancement of hotels, even in New York City. It carries great tradition in national hospitality...marks the measure of nation&#x27;s growth in power, in comfort and in artistry...an exhibition of courage and confidence to the whole nation&quot;. About 2,000 people were in the ballroom listening to this speech, but by the end of the business day, the 2,200-room hotel had only 500 occupants.

The hotel contained several innovations for its time. The Waldorf Astoria contained phones that rang automatically, a first for its time; teletype devices; a telephone extension in each of the 1,550 two-bedroom suites; and a telephone switchboard that served 2,535 extensions. There were radios in all 2,000 guestrooms and in 15 public rooms, connected by of wire. 140 suites on the upper stories had provision for privately owned receivers. Soon after the hotel opened, hotelier Conrad Hilton, almost bankrupt at the time, reportedly cut out a photograph of the hotel from a magazine and wrote across it, &quot;The Greatest of Them All&quot;. Nonetheless, the Waldorf-Astoria did not begin operating at a profit until 1939. Lucius Boomer continued to manage the hotel in the 1930s and 1940s, a commanding figure to whom Tony Rey referred as &quot;the greatest hotelman of his era&quot;. Boomer was elected chairman of the board of the Waldorf-Astoria Corporation on February 20, 1945, a position he held until his death in July 1947.

=== Early years and international politics ===
Like the original hotel, from its inception, the Waldorf Astoria gained worldwide renown for its glamorous dinner parties and galas, often at the center of political and business conferences and fundraising schemes. Author Ward Morehouse III has referred to the Waldorf Astoria as &quot;comparable to great national institutions&quot; and a &quot;living symbol deep within our collective consciousness&quot;. It had the &quot;greatest banquet department in the world&quot; at the time according to restaurateur Tom Margittai, with the center of activity being the Grand Ballroom. On August 3, 1932, some 200 people representing the &quot;cream of New York&#x27;s literary world&quot; attended the Waldorf Astoria to honor Pearl S. Buck, the author of &quot;The Good Earth&quot;, which was the best-selling novel in the United States in 1931 and 1932. One dinner alone, a relatively &quot;small dinner&quot; attended by some 50 people in June 1946, raised over $250,000.

During the 1930s and 1940s the hotel&#x27;s guests were also entertained at the elegant &quot;Starlight Roof&quot; nightclub by the Waldorf-Astoria Orchestra and such noted musicians as: Xavier Cugat, Eddie Duchin, Lester Lanin and Glenn Miller. In the Wedgwood Room, guests dined during performances by entertainers including Frank Sinatra, Victor Borge, the Mischa Borr Orchestra, with John Serry, the Leo Reisman Orchestra, Annamary Dickey, Corinna Mura, Paul Draper, and Gracie Fields.

The hotel played a considerable role in the emerging Cold War and international relations during the postwar years, staging numerous events and conferences. On March 15, 1946, Winston Churchill attended a welcoming dinner at the hotel given by Governor Thomas E. Dewey, and from November 4 to December 12, 1946, the Big Four Conference was held in Jørgine Boomer&#x27;s apartment on the 37th floor of the Towers. On November 24, 1947, 48 prominent figures of the Hollywood film industry met at the Waldorf Astoria and discussed what would become the Waldorf Statement, banning people with Communist beliefs or tendencies from the Hollywood film industry. On June 21, 1948, a press conference at the hotel introduced the LP record.

From March 27 to 29, 1949, the Cultural and Scientific Conference for World Peace, also known as the Waldorf World Peace Conference, was held at the hotel to discuss the emerging Cold War and the growing divide between the US and the Soviet Union. The event was organized by the struggling American Communist Party and was attended by the likes of Soviet Foreign Minister Andrey Vyshinsky, composer and pianist Dmitri Shostakovich, and writer Alexsander Fadeyev; it was picketed by anti-Stalinists running under the banner of America for Intellectual Freedom, and prominent individuals such as Irving Howe, Dwight Macdonald, Mary McCarthy and Robert Lowell. In 1954, Israeli statesman and archaeologist Yigael Yadin met secretly with the Syriac Orthodox Archbishop Mar Samuel in the basement of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel to negotiate the purchase of four Dead Sea Scrolls for Israel; Yadin paid $250,000 for all four scrolls.

Hilton acquired management rights to the hotel on October 12, 1949. Restaurateur George Lang began working at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in 1955, and on December 13, 1955, he helped organize the American Theatre Wing&#x27;s First Night Ball to celebrate Helen Hayes&#x27;s 50th year in show business. He did much to organize dinners at the Waldorf to assist Hungarian issues and relief. On one occasion, an event was attended by Edward G. Robinson and pianist Doklady and some $60,000 were raised.

====April in Paris Ball====
The April in Paris Ball was an annual gala event whose mission was to improve Franco-American relations, to share cultures, and to help assist the US and French charities, aside from commemorating the 2000th anniversary of the founding of Paris. It was established by Claude Philippe, the hotel banquet manager, in 1952. While the hotel&#x27;s management handled invitations and publicity, other details were coordinated by socialites. Elsa Maxwell was given the primary responsibility in organizing it. It was initially held annually in April, but according to Ann Vaccaro, former executive director of the ball, it was changed to October . After being changed to October, it often marked the start of the US fall social season. It was staged in the Grand Ballroom at the Waldorf for eight years, until 1960. The ball was designed to cater to &quot;very, very high-class people&quot; according to Vaccaro. Raffle tickets cost $100 per person and offered opulent prizes such as a $5000 bracelet and other jewels, expensive furs, perfumes, and even cars. 
The Paris Ball became a notable event in the annual calendar during the 1950s, with one early show featuring a &quot;three-hour spectacular of five tableaux, directed by Stuart Chaney&quot;, [depicting] a 12th-century scene of troubadours at the court of Eleanor of Aquitane, Henry VIII&#x27;s meeting at the Field of the Cloth of Gold, Louis XIV at Versailles, and a fashion show of 40 creations by Dior, Fath, Balmain, Desses, and Givenchy&quot;. The 1957 event was attended by some 1300 guests, including the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Senator John F. Kennedy, his wife, Jackie, and Marilyn Monroe, who donated $130,000 to charities. The following year, the ballroom was decorated with high chestnut trees, earning $170,000 for charities. The final ball to be hosted in the hotel was held on April 10, 1959, with the main theme being the Parisian circus of the 18th century.

=== Late 20th century ===
By 1959, the hotel emerged as the annual host for live broadcasts from the ballroom by Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians Orchestra during New Year&#x27;s Eve celebrations. Lasting until 1976, these broadcasts were carried worldwide on CBS and invariably concluded at midnight with a performance of &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; observed that the American public would simply not believe it was New Year&#x27;s Day unless Guy Lombardo heralded its arrival from the Waldorf Astoria Hotel.

&quot;Time&quot; celebrated its 40th anniversary at the hotel on May 6, 1963, at an event attended by some 1,500 celebrities. When Pope Paul VI made the first papal visit to the United States in 1965, he met with U.S. president Lyndon B. Johnson at the Waldorf Astoria. In 1968, British rock band The Who checked into the hotel and were reportedly banned from the hotel for life; however, they were allowed to visit the hotel in 1990, when they performed at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction.
In 1972, the Hilton Hotels Corporation bought the hotel outright from New York Central&#x27;s successor, Penn Central. In the 1970s, the Waldorf Astoria continued to play an important role in international politics, particularly between the US and the Middle East. In November 1974, the hotel was placed on high alert when a &quot;20-car motorcade, with eight shotgun-toting police marksmen aboard in bullet-proof vests&quot; brought Palestinian Fatah party leader Farouk Kaddoumi to the Waldorf from John F. Kennedy International Airport. The following month, President Ford met with Nelson Rockefeller after he was voted vice president, and a 90-minute press conference was held in a suite in the hotel. In November 1975, the US government insisted that PLO leader Yasser Arafat stay at the Waldorf during his visit to America, against the wishes of the hotel staff; security was stepped up severely. On August 12, 1981, IBM unveiled its Personal Computer in a press conference at the Waldorf Astoria. The National Basketball Association held its first-ever draft lottery between non-playoff teams at the Starlight Roof for the 1985 NBA draft.

Lee Jablin, of Harman Jablin Architects, fully renovated and upgraded the property during the mid-1980s through the mid-1990s in a $150 million renovation. The main lobby was renovated in 1986 as part of the project, and the hotel was also downsized from 1,800 to 1,700 rooms. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) designated the Waldorf Astoria&#x27;s exterior as a New York City landmark in January 1993, which prevented Hilton from demolishing or altering the hotel&#x27;s facade without the LPC&#x27;s permission. At the time, Hilton did not have any plans to alter the hotel&#x27;s facade.

=== 21st century ===
On May 27, 2001, the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Church of America had a grand banquet at the hotel to celebrate the 1700th anniversary of Armenia&#x27;s conversion to Christianity, with Ambassador Edward Djerejian as guest speaker. On May 7, 2004, a press conference was held by MGM, discussing Steve Martin&#x27;s &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; of the Pink Panther series. The 5th Annual DGA Honors Gala was held at the Waldorf on September 29.

In 2006, Hilton launched Waldorf Astoria Hotels &amp; Resorts, a brand named for the hotel. Branches of the Waldorf Astoria were launched in Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, and Louisiana in the United States, and abroad in France, Israel, Italy, and Saudi Arabia. In 2006, Hilton was reported to be considering opening a new Waldorf Astoria hotel on the Las Vegas Strip. In 2008, the Waldorf Astoria opened the Guerlain and Spa Chakra, Inc. spa at the hotel, as part of the Waldorf Astoria Collection. The Waldorf Astoria New York is a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. &quot;The Towers of the Waldorf Astoria&quot; continued to operate as a boutique &quot;hotel within a hotel&quot;.

==== Anbang conversion ====
In October 2014, Chinese company Anbang Insurance Group bought Waldorf Astoria New York from Hilton for $1.95 billion, making it the most expensive hotel ever sold at the time. A Chinese restaurant, La Chine, opened at the Waldorf Astoria late the following year. On July 1, 2016, Anbang announced plans to refurbish the hotel and turn some rooms into condominiums, The Towers of the Waldorf Astoria. Under the plan, some of the hotel&#x27;s rooms would be turned into apartments, while the remaining guestrooms would be operated by Hilton. The final event in the Grand Ballroom, on February 28, 2017, was a charity gala celebrating NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital with Stevie Wonder playing. As part of the refurbishment process, the hotel closed on March 1, 2017. The hotel&#x27;s restaurants, including Peacock Alley, The Bull and Bear Steak House, and La Chine, were all closed; they were planned to reopen when the renovation was completed. A week after the hotel closed, on March 7, 2017, the LPC voted unanimously to list the interiors of many of the hotel&#x27;s public spaces as New York City landmarks, protecting them from major alterations.

Public spaces like the Grand Ballroom and Peacock Alley were refurbished as part of the project. The hotel rooms were planned to be on the lowest 18 floors. Louis Deniot redesigned the apartments and amenity areas, while Pierre-Yves Rochon refurbished the hotel rooms. In early 2018, the Chinese government took over the Waldorf Astoria and Anbang&#x27;s other assets for one year, alleging economic crimes by Anbang. The firm Douglas Elliman was hired to sell the condos. In November 2019, it was announced that the 375 condos in the Waldorf-Astoria would go on sale early the next year, while the 375 remaining hotel rooms would not reopen until 2021. Following Anbang&#x27;s bankruptcy in 2020, Dajia Insurance Group Co. took over Anbang&#x27;s American assets, including the Waldorf Astoria. Sales of the Waldorf-Astoria&#x27;s condos began that March. By late 2020, the hotel was set to open at the end of 2022; however, by March 2021, the timeline had been postponed to early 2023. At its busiest point, the renovation project employed 1,000 workers per day.

The renovation of the Waldorf Astoria stalled in mid-2022 as the project exceeded its $2 billion budget. According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, this had pushed the renovation back to at least 2024. Further complications arose due to various workplace accidents, including the death of a worker. In March 2023, news media reported that the building would not reopen until 2025 at the earliest. Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts hired a leadership team in April 2024 in advance of the hotel&#x27;s expected reopening later that year. In October 2024, the hotel&#x27;s reopening was postponed yet again to early 2025. That December, Hilton began allowing guests to make reservations in preparation for the hotel&#x27;s reopening, and the first condos went on sale at that time. The first buyers finalized their purchases in February 2025.

==Architecture==

The hotel was designed by architects Schultze and Weaver and constructed at 301 Park Avenue, between 49th and 50th Streets, several blocks north of Grand Central Terminal. The hotel occupies an entire city block, measuring wide between Park Avenue to the west and Lexington Avenue to the east, and deep between 49th Street to the south and 50th Street to the north. The hotel was developed atop the existing railroad tracks leading to the station as part of the Terminal City complex, using the air rights above the tracks.

&quot;Travel America&quot; stated: &quot;To linger in the sumptuous salons of the Waldorf-Astoria is to step back in time. Your trip down memory lane is a flashback to the glamor days of the 1930s when this Art Deco masterpiece was the tallest hotel in the world and the epicenter of elite society. A legendary limestone landmark occupying a whole block of prime real estate in midtown Manhattan, it&#x27;s still a prestigious address that embodies luxury and power in the richest city on earth.&quot;

===Form and facade ===

The 47-story, hotel, was the tallest and largest hotel in the world for several years after its completion. The structure uses of black marble imported from Belgium, of Brech Montalto and of Alps Green from Italy, and some 300 antique mantels. In addition, 200 railroad cars brought some of limestone for the building&#x27;s facing, 27,100 tons of steel for the skeleton superstructure, and of terra cotta and gypsum block. The hotel is accessed by six bronze-and-nickel doorways, three each on Park and Lexington Avenues, all measuring wide and high.

The massing of the hotel rises from a pair of 20-story-high slabs at the base, which run parallel to Park and Lexington Avenues. The slabs contain setbacks at the 18th story on their western elevation and at the 13th and 16th stories on the eastern elevation. The slab on Park Avenue contained a retractable metal and glass roof above the 18th and 19th stories, above the Starlight Roof nightclub. The slabs are covered with gray limestone and lack colorful ornamentation. The facade of the lower stories is divided vertically into numerous bays, which contain recessed windows and spandrel panels. There are three patterns of spandrels on the western and eastern elevations of the facade, facing Park and Lexington Avenues respectively. Gilded letters with the hotel&#x27;s name are placed above the entrances on either avenue. On Park Avenue, the letters are flanked by representations of maidens.

Above the 20th story, the hotel rises as a single slab to the 42nd story. This slab is oriented parallel to the side streets and is also faced in gray limestone. The 42-story slab is topped by a pair of towers. The tops of the towers contain bronze-and-glass lanterns measuring high and 15 feet wide. The upper stories of the towers are faced in brick, which was intentionally designed to match the stonework on the lower stories. The use of brick led many to believe that the builders ran out of money. The Waldorf Astoria&#x27;s facade has undergone few changes over the years, except for the installation of openings for air conditioners; replacement of aluminum windows; and modifications to storefronts, marquees, and entrances at ground level.

===Interior===
 Frommer&#x27;s has cited the hotel as an &quot;icon of luxury&quot;, and highlights the &quot;wide stately corridors, the vintage Deco door fixtures, the white-gloved bellmen, the luxe shopping arcade&quot;, the &quot;stunning round mosaic under an immense crystal chandelier&quot;, and the &quot;free-standing Waldorf clock, covered with bronze relief figures&quot; in the main lobby. The first, third, fourth, and 18th floors were dedicated entirely to public rooms and spaces. Many of the public areas used indirect lighting, with lightbulbs concealed in objects such as lamps and vases, &quot;so as to create a restful atmosphere&quot;. Tours are conducted of the hotel for guests.

==== Ground level ====
The hotel is accessed by two foyers at ground level: one on Park Avenue to the west and one on Lexington Avenue to the east. Three vestibules at the middle of the Park Avenue elevation contain metal-and-glass doors that lead to the foyer there. The center vestibule is composed of a limestone frame, which projects slightly inward and contains two revolving doors. The vestibules on either side contain doors that swing outward, as well as ornate nickel-bronze metalwork. There are nickel-bronze grilles between each of the vestibule, as well as large windows on the west wall, illuminating the space. These large windows are divided by wide mullions with bas-reliefs, and they also have pierced metal screens. Stairs on the east wall lead up to the Park Avenue lobby.

The Lexington Avenue foyer is at the center of the Lexington Avenue elevation and also contains nickel-bronze decorations. The east wall has three vestibules with metal-and-glass doors leading to the street. The center vestibule is a revolving door within a curved frame, while the other vestibules have doors that swing outward. Above the vestibules are grilles, wood paneling, and beveled mirrors. The west wall contains escalators to the north and a stairway to the south, which ascend to the lobby level, as well as a hallway leading to additional spaces at ground level.

A private driveway, measuring wide and long, was built from 49th to 50th Street. Similar to the old Waldorf-Astoria&#x27;s 34th Street carriageway, this allowed private vehicles and taxis to drop off and pick up guests without blocking traffic. The driveway led to a parking lot with 300 spaces.

====Lobby level====
Unlike in other American hotels, the lobby story of the Waldorf Astoria is raised one story above ground level, which both created the impression of grandeur and allowed storefronts to be placed at ground level. Many rooms contained murals from both 18th-century and contemporary artists. For example, the men&#x27;s cafe contained a map of the New York metropolitan area with notable golf courses; another dining room had canvases painted by Josep Maria Sert, gold walls, and a silver ceiling.

===== Park Avenue lobby and colonnade =====

On the west side of the lobby level is the Park Avenue lobby, also called the main foyer; it is accessed from the Park Avenue foyer and is illuminated by that foyer&#x27;s windows. The LPC describes the space as being in the Pompeian style. The Park Avenue lobby is surrounded by raised terraces on the north and south walls, the Park Avenue foyer to the west, and the colonnade to the east. The north terrace connects with the Empire Room, while the south terrace connects with the Vanderbilt Room; both terraces have an alcove to the west and a stair to the east. The Park Avenue lobby contains classical-style square columns, as well as pastoral murals by Louis Rigal. The center of the Park Avenue lobby has a stepped ceiling, the terraces and Park Avenue foyer have painted panels on their ceilings, and the terraces&#x27; alcoves have metallic-trim ceilings.

The Park Avenue Colonnade connects the Park Avenue lobby to the west and the West Lounge to the east. The space is divided into three aisles by two colonnades of square columns. The mosaic floor contains rosette motifs surrounded by a travertine frame. Each wall is made of painted plaster with limestone pilasters, wainscoting, and white-metal doors. The men&#x27;s room and cloakroom are on the north wall, while the ladies&#x27; room and shoe-shine room are on the south wall; a set of metal-and-glass doors originally led to the West Lounge. The center aisle has a coved ceiling with indirect lighting and metal finishes, while the north and south aisles have paneled ceilings similar to those above the Park Avenue lobby&#x27;s terraces.

The west lounge, originally the Peacock Alley, runs in a north–south direction, connecting the Park Avenue lobby and colonnade to the west and the west elevator bank to the east. It contains wooden paneled walls and red-marble pilasters with silver Ionic capitals. The northern portion of the west lounge has been converted into a restaurant area. This space contains the Peacock Alley restaurant, which includes the main restaurant, a bar and lounge, and three private dining salons. The southern portion remains intact and contains a set of decorative metal gates that formerly led to a beauty salon. The west elevator lobby consists of a bank of six elevators with stainless steel doors that contain bas-reliefs of women. The elevator lobby also has a carpet, wooden paneling around the elevator doors, and a stepped ceiling with crystal chandelier. The elevators are furnished with paneled pollard oak and Carpathian elm.

===== Main lobby =====
The main lobby, at the center of the lobby level, measures across and high. The lobby has four wood-paneled walls, all of which originally contained archways, but the archways on the north and south walls have been infilled. There are also square columns made of black marble, which support a plaster ceiling. The tops of the walls contain a bas-relief frieze, installed in a 1980s renovation. The lobby is furnished with polished nickel-bronze cornices and Rockwood stone. In the main lobby is a chandelier measuring by . Initially, the north wall of the lobby had a porter and cigar store; the east wall had a transportation desk; and the south wall had a cashier&#x27;s desk and front-office desk. Special desks in the lobby are provided for transportation and theater, where exclusive tickets to many of the city&#x27;s prominent theaters can be purchased.

The grand clock, a 4000-lb bronze, was built by the Goldsmith&#x27;s Company of London and was acquired from the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition. Its base is octagonal, with eight commemorative plaques of presidents George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, Andrew Jackson, Benjamin Harrison, and Grover Cleveland, and Queen Victoria and Benjamin Franklin. A shield once belonging to the Waldorf was moved to the Alexis restaurant on W. Franklin Street in 1984.

The main lobby is surrounded on all four sides by a system of secondary corridors. The eastern corridor allowed direct access from Lexington Avenue to the various rooms on the third and fourth stories. The architects used different colors of marbles for the lobby-floor lounges to distinguish them from each other. The west lounge has French walnut burl panels separated by red French marble; the former north lounge had yellow Siena marble; the south lounge has white gray Breche Montalto marble; and the east arcade has serpentine cladding.

===== East arcade and stair hall =====
East of the main lobby is the main lobby hall, which leads to the hotel&#x27;s east arcade and eastern elevator bank. The room includes wall panels made of burled wood, as well as bronze vitrines. The east arcade runs in a north–south direction, connecting the main lobby hall to the west and a stair hall to the east. Its design is similar to that of the west lounge. The east arcade has elevators with nickel-bronze doors that contain bas-reliefs of floral patterns and figures. The east arcade also contains Japanese-ash wall paneling; green-marble pilasters with Corinthian capitals; and metal-and-glass doors. The northern end of the east arcade has been divided into another room, while the southern end leads to a staircase that connects with the 49th Street Ballroom. The arcade also contains display cases and stores, although it originally functioned as a lounge.

The stair hall consists of a pair of staircases leading from the first to the third floor, allowing guests to access the ballroom directly from Lexington Avenue. The staircases contain balustrades with frozen-fountain motifs and brass handrails, as well as marble statues. The plaster walls are painted to resemble travertine and contain grilles and mirrored panels, while the ceilings have stepped surfaces and crystal chandeliers.

===== Other spaces =====
The lobby level contains the room registration and cashier desks, the Empire Room and Hilton Room, the private Marco Polo Club, the Wedding Salon, Kenneth&#x27;s Salon, the Peacock Alley lounge and restaurant, and Sir Harry&#x27;s Bar. From 1992 to 2013, Kenneth, sometimes called the world&#x27;s first celebrity hairdresser, famed for creating Jacqueline Kennedy&#x27;s bouffant in 1961, moved his hairdressing and beauty salon to the Waldorf after a 1990 fire destroyed his shop on 19 East 54th Street.

Several boutiques surround the lobby, which contains Cole Porter&#x27;s Steinway &amp; Sons floral print-decorated grand piano on the Cocktail Terrace, which the hotel had once given him as a gift. Porter was a resident at the hotel for 30 years and composed many of his songs here. The Empire Room is where many of the musical and dance performances were put on, from Count Basie, to Victor Borge, Gordon MacRae, Liza Minnelli, George M. Cohan, and Lena Horne, the first black performer at the hotel.

====Third and fourth floors====
The third floor contains the Grand Ballroom, the ballroom foyer, entrance hall, the Basildon Room, the Jade Room, and the Astor Gallery. The eastern part of the third floor contains the Jade Room to the north and the Astor Gallery to the south, separated by a foyer. The stair hall from the first floor connects the Jade Room–Astor Gallery foyer to the east with the ballroom&#x27;s entrance hall to the west. The ballroom&#x27;s entrance hall extends north to the Basildon Room and connects with the ballroom&#x27;s foyer to the southwest. West of the ballroom foyer is the ballroom itself, at the center of the third floor&#x27;s south side.

===== Grand Ballroom =====
The Grand Ballroom, measuring , measures high. The space could fit up to 4,000 people. Although the ballroom has had several decorative schemes over the years, since 1983 it has been painted in a champagne-colored palette with silver and gold accents. The center of the ballroom has no columns and is spanned by a girder, which supports the upper stories. The ballroom has a stage at its northern end, which could accommodate a full orchestra. The rest of the room is surrounded by two balconies, which are supported by full-height piers and contain indirect lighting fixtures. The balconies on the fourth floor project from the piers, while those on the fifth floor are designed as cantilevered boxes. The ballroom has a coved ceiling that steps up toward the center; it originally had indirect lighting panels, but a crystal chandelier and cove lighting have also been installed. Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill restored the ballroom to its original appearance during the 2020s.

The Grand Ballroom is surrounded by a set of galleries, which connect the main floor to the balconies. The galleries contain carpets on the floors, grilles on the walls, and metal staircases. The ballroom was originally served by 27 elevators which connected to the main entrances, a set of private entrances on 49th and 50th Streets, and the guestrooms.

Numerous organizations hold their annual dinners in the Grand Ballroom, including St. John&#x27;s University President&#x27;s Dinner and the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner. The NASCAR Sprint Cup end-of-season awards banquet was held at the Waldorf-Astoria every year between 1981 and 2008;, mainly in the Grand Ballroom. Every October, the Paris Ball was held in the Grand Ballroom, before moving to the Americana (now the Sheraton Times Square). Bob Hope was a regular performer at the Ballroom, as was Guy Lombardo, who used to broadcast live on the radio there from the &quot;Starlight Roof&quot;. Maurice Chevalier performed at the ballroom in 1965 in his last appearance. Louis Armstrong performed at the Waldorf for two weeks in March 1971 in his last performance. Since 1986, most Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremonies have been held in the Grand Ballroom.

===== Other spaces =====
The ballroom foyer, east of the ballroom, measures wide. There is an aisle to the east, separating the foyer from the ballroom entrance hall. The southern end of the aisle contains a staircase leading to a mezzanine and the fourth-floor balcony; the mezzanine and stairway have metal railings. The walls contain metal grilles, and the north and south walls also have marble piers. The north, west, and east walls have transoms with mirrors, while the south wall has marble paneling and mirrored doors. The ceilings are made of plaster, with crystal chandeliers hanging from a dome with plaster peacocks.

The ballroom&#x27;s entrance hall, also known as the Silver Gallery, bears a resemblance to the original hotel&#x27;s Peacock Alley, but is shorter and wider. It measures almost long and connects the ballroom&#x27;s foyer to the west with the stairways from Lexington Avenue to the east. This room has a vaulted ceiling with crystal chandeliers suspended from it. The walls and doors have mirrored panels, and the space also has grilles, molded frames, and murals. The elevator doors are made of nickel-bronze and depict two women, one each with a lute and a harp. This room also has allegorical murals painted by Edward Emerson Simmons. The murals, surrounded by wood frames, were taken from the original hotel&#x27;s Astor Gallery and depict twelve female figures.

The Basildon Room, measuring , is at the north end of the ballroom&#x27;s entrance hall. The space includes oil paintings and a fireplace mantel salvaged from Basildon Park, a 17th-century English manor designed by John Carr. The oil paintings, designed by Angelica Kauffmann, depict scenes from the poem &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; by Dante Alighieri. The mantel and walls are decorated in the neoclassical style; the room also originally contained a wooden floor and mirrored transoms and doors.

The Jade Room, occupying the northeast corner of the third story, measures , with marble pilasters and columns dividing the space into aisles. The center of the Jade Room originally had a maple dance floor, while the eastern aisle overlooks Lexington Avenue. The Jade Room contains bas-reliefs on the walls, themed to dance and rhythm; decorations along the edges of the ceiling; and a pair of suspended chandeliers. In addition, there are closets at the corners of each aisle, as well as mirrors on the north and south walls. The small eastern foyer, connecting the Jade Room with the Astor Gallery, contains grilles on the walls and ceilings, as well as doorways leading west to the stair hall. The Astor Gallery, at the third story&#x27;s southeast corner, also measures 78 by 48 feet and is divided into three aisles, like the Jade Room. Most of the decorative features are similar to those in the Jade Room, but the south wall of the Astor Gallery also contains a fireplace. Additionally, the Jade Room had green pilasters and gold window drapes, while the Astor Gallery had silver-gray pilasters and rose drapes.

On the fourth story were various ballrooms that accommodated between 160 and 2,100 guests. The fourth floor has the banquet and sales offices, and most of the suites were named after guests including Barron, Vanderbilt, Windsor, Conrad, Vertès, Louis XVI, and Cole Porter. The fourth floor was where the notorious Sunday-night card games were played. Before its 2021 renovation, the hotel had a model of one of the living rooms of apartment 31A, then the suite of former U.S. president Herbert Hoover. A living room from the suite is also recreated as a display at the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum in West Branch, Iowa.

====Rooms and suites====
The hotel originally had 2,253 guestrooms, including 500 deluxe rooms and 300 parlors; the rooms above the 28th story were largely intended for long-term residents. The Waldorf Astoria and Towers had a total of 1,413 hotel rooms as of 2014. In 2009, when it had 1,416 rooms, the main hotel had 1,235 single and double rooms and 208 minisuites, 17 of which were classified as &quot;Astoria Level&quot;, which are upgraded rooms with deluxe amenities and complimentary access to the Astoria Lounge.

===== Lower-story guestrooms =====

The hotel&#x27;s guestrooms were originally decorated in 18th-century American, English, and French styles. Frommer&#x27;s likened the décor of the rooms to those of an English country house, and describe the corridors as being wide and plush-carpeted, which &quot;seem to go on forever&quot;. The rooms retain the original Art Deco motifs, although each room is decorated differently. The guestrooms were classified as Deluxe, Superior, and Luxury, with a marble bath or shower and amenities designed by Salvatore Ferragamo. The suites featured king or double beds and start in size at . The smallest are the one-bedroom suites, which range from . The Signature Suites have a separate living room and one or two bedrooms, which range from .

===== Upper-story suites and condominiums =====
The Tower suites were divided into standard ones; The Towers Luxury Series, which have their own sitting room; the Towers Penthouse Series; the Towers Presidential-Style Suites; and finally the most expensive Presidential Suite on the 35th floor. The Penthouse Series contained three suites, The Penthouse, The Cole Porter Suite, and The Royal Suite, named after the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. They started at in size, with two or more bedrooms, and had a kitchen and a dining room which could accommodate 8–12 guests.

Like the Penthouse Series, they had their own kitchen and dining room. The Presidential Suite was designed with Georgian-style furniture to emulate that of the White House. It had three large bedrooms and three bathrooms, and boasted numerous treasures, including the desk of General MacArthur and rocking chair of John F. Kennedy.

, the condominiums span floors 19 through 52. The condos range from studio apartments to penthouse apartments. Although the upper stories largely have 28 condos on each floor, the 40th through 42nd stories contain a total of two penthouses. The penthouses, within the copper pinnacles, are duplex apartments covering and have private elevators. Excluding the penthouses, the minimum asking prices for the condos ranged from $2.6 million for a one-bedroom unit to $18.5 million for a four-bedroom, unit.

====Other facilities====
The 18th floor had a roof garden and outdoor terrace, as well as a foyer, checking room, coatroom, and kitchens. The terrace contained multicolored glass mosaics inlaid in cement. A fitness center is on the 5th floor. The $21.5 million Waldorf Astoria Guerlain Spa was inaugurated on September 1, 2008, on the 19th floor. It features 16 treatment rooms and two relaxation lounges. The hotel has its own Business Center, a digital facility, where guests can access the Internet and photocopy. In 2004, the hotel launched a line of products in keeping with its Art Deco design. The top five stories were devoted to mechanical equipment. Following the 2020s renovation, the hotel portion of the Waldorf Astoria had of amenity spaces, while the condo portion had another of amenities.

When the Waldorf Astoria opened, it had 31 elevators. The lower stories were served by nine elevators, while the Waldorf Towers were served by four elevators traveling at . There were also three elevators connecting the ground, ballroom, and banquet-room levels, each capable of carrying , and an elevator on 50th Street connecting to the ballroom and exhibition levels, capable of carrying .

The hotel has its own railway platform, Track 61, that was part of the New York Central Railroad (later Metro-North Railroad), and was connected to the Grand Central Terminal complex. Intended for guests with private railcars, the platform was used by such figures as Franklin D. Roosevelt, James Farley, Adlai Stevenson, and Douglas MacArthur, and it has also hosted exhibits and fashion shows. An elevator measuring , large enough for Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s automobile, provides access to the platform. There is a pedestrian entrance from 50th Street, just to the left of the Waldorf Towers entrance, but it is rarely open to the public.

==Restaurants and cuisine==

The Waldorf Astoria was the first hotel to offer room service 24 hours a day, and it was the first major hotel in the world to hire women as chefs, beginning in 1931. An extensive menu is available for guests, with special menus for children and for dieters. The executive chef of the Waldorf for many years was John Doherty, following the Austrian Arno Schmidt who held the position for ten years from 1969 to 1979. Restaurateur George Lang was awarded the Hotelman of the Year Award in 1975.

As of the early 1990s, the hotel served over three million dishes a year and got through 27,000 pounds of lobster, 100 pounds of beluga caviar, 380,000 pints of strawberries annually. The hotel has gained significant renown for its lavish feasts. During one grand feast for Francis Cardinal Spellman, over 200 VIP guests, according to Arno Schmidt, devoured some 3,600 pounds of fillet, 600 pounds of fresh halibut, 1,500 pounds of potatoes, and 260 pounds of petit fours, eaten on gold china plates. One 1973 feast by the Explorer&#x27;s Club devoured hippo meat, a alligator, a baby shark, an amberjack tuna, a boa, wild boar hams, 480 pieces of breaded-fried cod tongues and cheeks, antelope steaks, two boxes of Chinese rabbit, and 20 pounds of rattlesnake.

The hotel has three main restaurants, &quot;Peacock Alley&quot;, &quot;The Bull and Bear Steak House&quot;, and &quot;Oscar&#x27;s Brasserie&quot;, as well as a secondary restaurant, the Japanese &quot;Inagiku&quot;. At its peak in the late 1940s, the hotel once had nine restaurants. &quot;Peacock Alley&quot;, in the west lounge, is known primarily for its fish and seafood dishes. Sunday Brunch is particularly popular with locals and features over 180 gourmet dishes divided into 12 themed displays, with cuisine ranging from lobster and oysters to Belgian waffles, Eggs Benedict, and omelettes to hollandaise sauces.

&quot;The Bull and Bear Steak House&quot; is furnished in richly polished mahogany in the English Regency style, and has a &quot;den-like&quot; atmosphere, and is reportedly the only restaurant on the East Coast which serves 28 days prime grade USDA Certified Angus Beef. It has won awards from the National Restaurant Association and &quot;Holiday&quot; magazine. Between 2007 and 2010, the restaurant was the filming location for &quot;Fox Business Happy Hour&quot;, presented live between 5 and 6  pm. The &quot;Bull and Bear Bar&quot; is based on the original Waldorf Astoria Bar, which was a favorite haunt of many of the financial elite of the city from the hotel&#x27;s inception in 1893, and adventurers such as Diamond Jim Brady, Buffalo Bill Cody and Bat Masterson.

Behind the bar are bronze statues of a bull and a bear, which represent stock exchange trends. The &quot;Inagiku&quot;, meaning the &quot;rice chrysanthemum&quot;, serves contemporary Japanese cuisine. The restaurant opens for lunch on weekdays and cocktails and dinner in the evenings. Designed by Henry Look of San Francisco, the restaurant has four &quot;distinctly different&quot; rooms, including one which represents an old Japanese farmhouse, and the Kinagu Room, resembling a Japanese temple. Guests have the option to reserve private orthodox tatami rooms.

&quot;Oscar&#x27;s Brasserie&quot;, overlooking Lexington Avenue in what was once a Savarin restaurant, is designed by Adam Tihany. The restaurant takes its name from Oscar Tschirky (Oscar of the Waldorf) and serves traditional American cuisine, with many dishes based upon his cookbook which have gained world renown, including the Waldorf salad, Eggs Benedict, Thousand Island dressing, and Veal Oscar. The Waldorf salad—a salad made with apples, walnuts, celery, grapes, and mayonnaise or a mayonnaise-based dressing—was first created in 1896 at the Waldorf by Oscar. The original recipe did not contain nuts, but they had been added by the time the recipe appeared in &quot;The Rector Cook Book&quot; in 1928. Tschirky was also noted for his &quot;Oscar&#x27;s Sauce&quot;, which became so popular that it was sold at the hotel. Another of the hotel&#x27;s specialties was red velvet cake, which became one of its most popular desserts.

&quot;Sir Harry&#x27;s Bar&quot; is one of the principal bars of the hotel, situated just off the main lobby. It is named after British Sir Harry Johnston (1858–1927). In the 1970s the bar was renovated in a &quot;plush African safari&quot; design to honor Johnston, a notable explorer of Africa, with &quot;zebra-striped wall coverings and carpeting, with bent-cane furnishings&quot;. It has since been redecorated back to a more conservative design, with walnut paneling and leather banquettes, and featured a by ebony bar as of the early 1990s. Frank Sinatra frequented &quot;Sir Harry&#x27;s Bar&quot; for many years. In 1991, while drinking at &quot;Sir Harry&#x27;s&quot; with Jilly Rizzo and Steve Lawrence, he was approached by a fan asking for an autograph. Sinatra responded, &quot;Don&#x27;t you see I&#x27;m on my own time here? You asshole. What&#x27;s wrong with you?&quot; The fan said something which angered Sinatra, who lunged at the fan, and Sinatra had to be restrained.

===Cocktail books===
Albert Stevens Crockett, the hotel&#x27;s veteran publicist and historian, wrote his first cocktail book &quot;Old Waldorf Bar Days&quot; in 1931 during Prohibition and the construction of the current hotel on Park Avenue. It was a homage to the original hotel and its famous bar and clientele. The book contains Crockett&#x27;s takes on the original hand-written leather-bound book of recipes that was given to him at the time of the closure by bartender Joseph Taylor. This edition was never reprinted.

In 1934, Crockett wrote a second book, &quot;The Old Waldorf Astoria Bar Book&quot;, in response to the repeal of the Volstead Act and the end of the Prohibition era. He edited out most of the text from the first book. Drawing from his experiences as a travel writer, Crockett added nearly 150 more recipes, the bulk of which can be found in the &quot;Cuban Concoctions&quot; and &quot;Jamaican Jollifers&quot; chapters. These books became reference books on the subject of pre-Prohibition cocktails and their culture.

In 2016, the long-time hotel bar manager of Peacock Alley and La Chine, Frank Caiafa, added a completely new edition to the canon. Caiafa&#x27;s &quot;The Waldorf Astoria Bar Book&quot; includes all of the recipes in Crockett&#x27;s books; many of the hotel&#x27;s most important recipes created since 1935; and his own creations. In 2017, it was nominated for a James Beard Foundation Award for Best Beverage Book.

Other notable books with connections to the hotel include &quot;Drinks&quot; (1914) by Jacques Straub, a wine steward and a friend of Oscar Tschirky who had written about the first hotel&#x27;s notable recipes. Tschirky compiled a list of 100 recipes for his own 1934 book &quot;100 Famous Cocktails&quot;, a selection of favorites from Crockett&#x27;s books. Hotel publicist Ted Saucier wrote &quot;Bottoms Up&quot; in 1951, consisting of a compendium of popular, national recipes of the day.

==Notable residents and guests==
===Leaders and businesspeople===

On the 100th anniversary of the original hotel in 1993, one publication wrote: &quot;It isn&#x27;t the biggest hotel in New York, nor the most expensive. But when it comes to prestige, the Waldorf-Astoria has no peer. When presidents come to New York, they stay at the Waldorf-Astoria. Kings and queens make it their home away from home, as have people as diverse as Cary Grant, the Dalai Lama and Chris Evert. Some of them liked the hotel so well, they made their home there.&quot;

Over the years many royals from around the world stayed at the Waldorf Astoria including Shahanshah of Iran and Empress Farah, King Frederik IX and Queen Ingrid of Denmark, Princess Astrid of Norway, Crown Prince Olav and Crown Princess Martha of Norway, King Baudouin I of Belgium and Queen Fabiola, Prince Albert and Princess Paola of Belgium, King Hussein I of Jordan, Prince Rainier III and Princess Grace of Monaco, Queen Juliana of the Netherlands, King Michael of Romania, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip of the Commonwealth realms, Mohammed Zahir Shah and Homaira Shah of Afghanistan, King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit of Thailand, and Crown Prince Akihito and Princess Michiko of Japan, The great-great-grandson of King Joseph Bonaparte and many others.

Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip stayed at the hotel during their first visit to America on October 21, 1957, and a banquet was held for them in the Grand Ballroom. In the Bicentennial year in 1976, most of the heads of state from around the world and all of the Kings and Queens of Europe were invited to the hotel, and it also served the presidential candidates in the run up to the elections of that year.
In modern times, the clientele of the Waldorf is more typically wealthy politicians and businessmen than playboys and royalty. An entire floor was often rented out to wealthy Saudi Arabians with their own staff. Wealthy Japanese businessmen during their stay would sometimes remove the furniture and replace it with their own floor mats. Demands by people of prominence could often be exorbitant or bizarre. Fidel Castro once walked into the hotel with a flock of live chickens, insisting that they be killed and freshly cooked on the premises to his satisfaction, only to be turned away. While serving as Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger ordered all of the antiques to be removed from one suite and replaced with 36 desks for his staff. An unnamed first lady once demanded that all of the bulbs in her suite be changed to 100-watt ones and kept on all day and night to simulate daylight. She further insisted that there be an abundance of chewing gum available.
Postmaster General James Farley occupied two adjoining suites in the current Waldorf Astoria during his tenure as the chairman of the board of Coca-Cola&#x27;s International division from 1940 until his death in 1976, arguably one of the landmark&#x27;s longest housed tenants. The Presidential Suite at the hotel come from when, during the 1950s and early 1960s, former U.S. president Herbert Hoover and retired U.S. General Douglas MacArthur lived in suites on different floors of the hotel. Hoover lived at the Waldorf Astoria for 20 years from after his wife died in 1944 until he died in 1964. Former president Dwight D. Eisenhower lived there between 1967 and his death in 1969.

MacArthur&#x27;s widow, Jean MacArthur, lived there from 1952 until her death in 2000. A plaque affixed to the wall on the 50th Street side commemorates this. John F. Kennedy was fond of the Waldorf Astoria and had a number of private meetings at the hotel, including one with Israeli prime minister David Ben-Gurion. From Hoover through Barack Obama, every president of the United States has either stayed over or lived in the Waldorf Astoria, although Jimmy Carter claimed to have never stayed overnight at the hotel. Nancy Reagan was reputedly not fond of the Presidential Suite.

The official residence of the United States&#x27; Permanent Representative to the United Nations, an unnamed 42nd-floor apartment, was located in the Waldorf Towers for many years. In 2015, the US Department of State announced that it was moving its headquarters during meetings of the UN General Assembly to the New York Palace Hotel.

Carlos P. Romulo, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Philippines and member of the UN had suite 3600, below Hoover&#x27;s, for some 45 years from 1935 onwards. Former Philippine First Lady Imelda Marcos also spent much time and money at the hotel. Another connection with the Philippines is that many meetings were held here between President Manuel L. Quezon and high ranking American politicians and senators. Through the meetings, Quezon encouraged investment into the country and convinced General MacArthur to accompany him back to the Philippines as his military adviser.

Nicaraguan president Anastasio Somoza Debayle and his wife Hope Portocarrero had a penthouse suite at the Waldorf Towers, where Somoza received political leaders.

===Celebrities===
The hotel has had many well-knowns under its roof throughout its history, including Charlie Chaplin, Ava Gardner, Liv Ullmann, Edward G. Robinson, Gregory Peck, Ray Bolger, John Wayne, Tony Bennett, Jack Benny, Katharine Hepburn, Spencer Tracy, Muhammad Ali, Vince Lombardi, Judy Garland, Sonny Werblin, Greer Garson, Harold Lloyd, Liberace, Burt Reynolds, Robert Montgomery, Cesar Romero, and many others. Due to the number of high-profile guests staying at the hotel at any one time, author Ward Morehouse III has referred to the Towers as a &quot;kind of vertical Beverly Hills. On any one given night you might find Dinah Shore, Gregory Peck, Frank Sinatra [or] Zsa Zsa Gabor staying there&quot;. Gabor married Conrad Hilton in 1941. 

During the 1930s, gangster Benjamin &quot;Bugsy&quot; Siegel owned an apartment at the Waldorf. Frank Costello was said to have got his haircut and nails done in the Barber&#x27;s Shop at the Waldorf. Around the time of World War I, inventor Nikola Tesla lived in the earlier Waldorf-Astoria.

In 1955, Marilyn Monroe and her husband Arthur Miller stayed at the hotel for several months. Due to costs of trying to finance her production company &quot;Marilyn Monroe Productions&quot;, only being paid $1,500 a week for her role in &quot;The Seven Year Itch&quot; and being suspended from 20th Century Fox for walking out on Fox after creative differences, living at the hotel became too costly, and Monroe had to move into a different hotel in New York City.

Around the same time that Monroe lived in the hotel, Cole Porter and his wife Linda Lee Thomas had an apartment in the Waldorf Towers, where Thomas died in 1954. Porter&#x27;s 1934 song &quot;You&#x27;re the Top&quot;, contains the lyric, &quot;You&#x27;re the top, you&#x27;re a Waldorf salad&quot;. The Cole Porter Suite, Suite 33A, was the place where Porter lived and entertained for a period. Frank Sinatra paid nearly $1 million a year to keep it as his suite at the hotel between 1979 and 1988, which he called home when out of Los Angeles. Sinatra took over part of the hotel during the filming of &quot;The First Deadly Sin&quot; in 1980.

Grace Kelly and Rainier III were regular guests at the hotel. At one time Kelly was reputed to be in love with the hotel banquet manager of the Waldorf, Claudius Charles Philippe. Elizabeth Taylor frequented the hotel, and would often attend galas at the hotel to talk about her various causes. Her visits were excitedly awaited by the hotel staff, who would prepare long in advance. Taylor was honored at the 1983 Friars Club dinner at the hotel.

Brooke Shields has stated that her very first encounter with the paparazzi was in the Grand Ballroom of the Waldorf at the age of 12, stating that she &quot;stood like a statue wondering why they were all hired to photograph me&quot;, and that she &quot;debuted at the Waldorf&quot;. During her childhood in the 1980s and 1990s, Paris Hilton lived with her family in the hotel.

One of the most prestigious debutante balls in the world is the invitation-only International Debutante Ball held biennially in the Grand Ballroom at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, where girls from prominent world families are presented to high society. Since 1954 the musical entertainment at the ball has traditionally been provided by the musicians of the Lester Lanin Orchestra.

==In popular culture==
The Waldorf Astoria has been a filming location for numerous films and TV series. Ginger Rogers headlined an all star ensemble cast in the 1945 film &quot;Week-End at the Waldorf&quot;, set at the hotel and filmed partially on location there. Other films shot at the hotel include &quot;The Out-of-Towners&quot; (1970), &quot;Broadway Danny Rose&quot; (1984), &quot;Coming to America&quot; (1988), &quot;Scent of a Woman&quot; (1992), &quot;The Cowboy Way&quot; (1994), &quot;Random Hearts&quot; (1999), &quot;Analyze This&quot; (1999), &quot;For Love of the Game&quot; (1999), &quot;Serendipity&quot; (2001), &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot; (2001), &quot;Maid in Manhattan&quot; (2002), &quot;Two Weeks Notice&quot; (2002), &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; (2002), &quot;End of the Century&quot; (2005), &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Smith&quot; (2005), &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; (2006), and &quot;The Hoax&quot; (2006). Television series that have filmed at the Waldorf include &quot;Law and Order&quot;, &quot;Rescue Me&quot;, &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, &quot;The Sopranos&quot; and &quot;Will and Grace&quot;.

Several biographies have been written about the Waldorf, including Edward Hungerford&#x27;s &quot;Story of the Waldorf&quot; (New York: G. P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons, 1925) and Horace Sutton&#x27;s &quot;Confessions of a Grand Hotel: The Waldorf-Astoria&quot; (New York: Henry Holt, 1953).
Langston Hughes wrote a poem entitled &quot;Advertisement for the Waldorf-Astoria&quot;, criticizing the hotel and inviting the jobless and homeless to take over the space of the hotel. Wallace Stevens wrote a poem entitled &quot;Arrival at the Waldorf&quot;, in which he contrasts the wild country of the jungles of Guatemala to being &quot;back at the Waldorf&quot;. In Meg Cabot&#x27;s novel &quot;Jinx&quot;, the Chapman School Spring Formal takes place in the Waldorf-Astoria. It is at this point that Tory (the main antagonist) reveals Jean&#x27;s first attempt at a love spell, which catalyzed the novel&#x27;s events.

Waldorf of the Muppets series was named after the hotel. In the episode starring Dizzy Gillespie his heckling partner Statler (named after Statler Hilton, also in Manhattan) couldn&#x27;t make it due to illness so Waldorf&#x27;s wife Astoria came with him. Ayn Rand biographer Anne Heller wrote that the Waldorf Astoria inspired the &quot;Wayne-Falkland Hotel&quot; in Rand&#x27;s novel &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;.

<text>Paul O. Williams (January 17, 1935 – June 2, 2009) was an American science fiction writer and haiku poet. Williams won multiple awards including the John W. Campbell Award and the Museum of Haiku Literature Award; and was professor emeritus of English at Principia College in Elsah, Illinois and president of the Haiku Society of America.

== Life ==

His most notable science fiction works are a series of novels, the Pelbar Cycle, set in North America about a thousand years after a &quot;time of fire&quot;, in which the world was nearly totally depopulated. The novels track a gradual reconnection of the human cultures which developed. Much of the action takes place in the communities of the Pelbar, along the Upper Mississippi River — in the general vicinity of Elsah. Several cultures, including the matriarchal Pelbar, join together in the Heart River Federation. Others, especially the tyrannical Tantal and slave-raiding Tusco, fall apart after suffering defeats. The predominant characters are change agents: Tor, Jestak, Stel and his wife Ahroe Westrun. All are Pelbar except for Tor who is Shumai. Williams won the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer in Science Fiction in 1983. Williams was a professor at Duke University and Principia College, and a longtime contributor to &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;.

He is also known as a writer of haiku, senryū, and tanka, and wrote a number of essays on the haiku form in English. In a 1975 essay, he coined the term &quot;Tontoism&quot; to refer to the practice of writing haiku with missing articles (&quot;the&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, or &quot;an&quot;), which he claimed made the haiku sound like the stunted English of the Indian sidekick, Tonto, in the &quot;Lone Ranger&quot; radio and television series. In 2001, his best essays were collected in &quot;The Nick of Time: Essays on Haiku Aesthetics&quot;, edited by Lee Gurga and Michael Dylan Welch. Williams was the president of the Haiku Society of America (1999) and vice president of the Tanka Society of America (2000). In 1989 he won the Museum of Haiku Literature Award from the Haiku Society of America with this poem written for Nick Virgilio shortly after Nick&#x27;s death:

Williams died from an aortic dissection on June 2, 2009.

<text>Rock Music is the third studio album by Australian band The Superjesus. The album was released in May 2003 and peaked at number 14.

==Background==
&quot;Rock Music&quot; was difficult for the band to make, taking a year and a half to finish. Bass player Stuart Rudd outlined the difficulties in making the album in an interview with Inpress magazine in June 2003. &quot;This album is a result of a year and a half prior,&quot; Stuart Rudd begins to explain. &quot;The ups and downs definitely… it all came to a peak when we were in London. We had forty or fifty songs written and we could not come to agree on a direction to go. Then with the departure of another guitarist (Tim Henwood) we really had to pick ourselves up off the canvas again. We realised that the songs we had been writing weren’t the ones that we wanted to do, because we were suddenly able to move as one in the direction we wanted to go. It was like a huge weight off our shoulders.&quot;

Tim Henwood left the band to form The Androids who had a top ten hit in Australia with the song &quot;Do It with Madonna&quot;.

<doc id="492137" wikidata="Q6878674" url="?curid=492137" title="Mission Point Light">
<text>Mission Point Light is a lighthouse located in the U.S. state of Michigan at the end of Old Mission Point, a peninsula jutting into Grand Traverse Bay north of Traverse City. When it was built in 1870, it was an exact copy of the Mama Juda Light (now destroyed), which was built on the Detroit River in 1866.

The foundation is natural and emplaced. The wooden structure is painted white with black trim. The square tower is attached to a dwelling.

A fixed white Fifth Order Fresnel lens was installed. The building was only one and one half stories tall. However, its placement on a sand bank 14 feet above the lake&#x27;s surface created a lens focal plane of . It was visible from at sea. Maintaining the dune and protecting it and the lighthouse from the deleterious effects of wave action has been a constant struggle.

For 67 years the light served to warn mariners about the shoals off the point. However, new techniques in offshore construction and the automation of lighthouse illumination made it possible to build a navigation aid on the shoal itself. In 1938, work began on a pier for the new light in of water, about northwest of Mission Point. The light ran on batteries. It was on a tall tower, and its focal plane of help make it visible for . It had a 30-second dwell time between flashes, in order to conserve power.

Famously, the lighthouse stands a few hundred yards south of the 45th parallel north, halfway between the North Pole and the Equator. The lighthouse was deactivated in 1933 and purchased by the State of Michigan. There are a pair of signs that denote its location on the parallel, and it is one of 29 places (six are in Michigan) in the U.S.A. where such signs are known to exist.

==Current status and activities==
The lighthouse is located in Old Mission State Park, which is managed by Peninsula Township as Lighthouse Park, at the northern end of M-37.

As reported in the Traverse City Record Eagle, in a unique program, the lighthouse society sought volunteers to work and live in the Mission Point Light during 2008. There is a fee, which will benefit the light.

In 2008, the building opened for the first time to the public (it will have a small museum), after serving for many years as the park manager&#x27;s residence.

The area around the lighthouse attracts many cross country skiers. There is a boat launch there, which is favored by sea kayakers. The location is becoming increasingly popular, which has subjected it to environmental issues that are being addressed by Peninsula Township.

The Old Mission Peninsula is said to be a premier place to sea kayak. One gets close to shore, lighthouse, picnic grounds and parks. The bay offers a shelter from the prevailing westerly winds and from the Lake Michigan waves. Maps, rentals and guided tours are available.

Because of its form, surroundings and location, it is photogenic, having inspired photographs and illustrations, including drawings and needlepoint.

<text>Verdiales are a Flamenco music style, and song form belonging to cante chico. 

Originating in Almogía, near the Spanish port of Málaga in Andalucía, it is based upon the fandango. For this reason, the verdiales are sometimes known as &quot;fandangos de Málaga.&quot;

Normally played in the key of E phrygian (key of C major with a sharpened fifth) and rarely in A minor, the verdiales have a 12-count rhythm similar to the soleares, and bulerías.

<doc id="492144" wikidata="Q4056436" url="?curid=492144" title="Bard (Soviet Union)">
<text>The term bard () came to be used in the Soviet Union in the early 1960s, and continues to be used in Russia today, to refer to singer-songwriters who wrote songs outside the Soviet establishment, similarly to folk singers of the American folk music revival. Because in bard music songwriters perform their own songs, the genre is also commonly referred to as author song (, &quot;avtorskaya pesnya&quot;) or bard song (, &quot;bardovskaya pesnya&quot;).

Bard poetry differs from other poetry mainly in being sung with simple guitar accompaniment, as opposed to being spoken. Another difference is that it focuses less on style and more on meaning. This means that fewer stylistic devices are used, and the poetry is often in the form of a narrative. What separates bard poetry from other songs is that the music is far less important than the lyrics; chord progressions are often very simple and tend to repeat from one bard song to another. A far more obvious difference is the commerce-free nature of the genre; songs are written to be sung and not to be sold, as the bards are often working professionals in a non-musical occupation.

Stylistically, the precursors to bard songs were Russian &quot;urban romances&quot;, which touched upon common life and were popular throughout all layers of Russian society in the late 19th to early 20th centuries. These romances were traditionally written in a minor key and performed with a guitar accompaniment.

Bard poetry may be roughly classified into two main genres: &quot;tourist song&quot; and &quot;political song&quot;, although some other subgenres are also recognized, such as &quot;outlaw song&quot; and &quot;pirate song&quot;.

Initially the term &quot;bard&quot; was used by fans of the tourist song genre, and outside those circles, the term was often perceived as slightly derisive. However, there was a need for a term to distinguish this style of song from the traditional mainstream pop song, and the term eventually stuck.

Many bards have performed their songs for small groups of people using a Russian guitar, and rarely, if ever, would they be accompanied by other musicians or singers. Bards who became popular were eventually able to hold modest concerts. Bards were rarely permitted to record their music, given the political nature of many of their songs. As a result, bard tunes usually made their way around via the copying of amateur recordings (known as magnitizdat) made at concerts, particularly those songs that were of a political nature.

== Types of songs ==

=== Tourist song ===
During the Soviet Era of Stagnation, camping, and especially its intense forms such as alpinism, kayaking/canoeing, and canyoning, became a form of escapism for young people, who felt that these activities were the only ways of life in which such values as courage, friendship, risk, trust, cooperation, and mutual support still mattered. It is these types of situations and virtues that tourist songs use for their subject.

Many of the best tourist songs were composed by Yuri Vizbor who participated and sang about all the sports described above, and Alexander Gorodnitsky who spent a great deal of time sailing around the world on ships and on scientific expeditions to the far North.

A notable subgenre of the Tourist song was the &quot;Sea song.&quot; As with other tourist songs, the goal was to sing about people in hard conditions where true physical and emotional conflicts appear. Vladimir Vysotsky had several songs of this sort, since his style suited them perfectly. Many of Alexander Gorodnitsky&#x27;s songs are about the sea, since he actually had the opportunity to experience life at sea. While some songs were simply about sailors, others were about pirates. With the romanticism of songs like &quot;Brigantine&quot; by Pavel Kogan, pirate songs are still popular at author song concerts today. Almost every bard has at least one song of this type.

Tourist song was generally tolerated by the government, and it existed under the moniker author song (avtorskaya pesnya), i.e., songs sung primarily by the authors themselves, as opposed to those sung by professional singers (although professionals often &quot;borrowed&quot; successful author songs for their repertoires). Another name for this genre was &quot;amateur song&quot; (&quot;samodeyatelnaya pesnya&quot;, literally translated as &quot;do-it-yourself song&quot; or &quot;self-made song&quot;). This term reflects the cultural phenomenon of the Soviet Union called &quot;amateur performing arts,&quot; or &quot;khudozhestvennaya samodeyatelnost&quot;. It was a widespread, often heavily subsidized, occupation of Soviet people in their spare time. Every major industrial enterprise and every kolkhoz had a Palace of Culture, or at least a House of Culture, for amateur performers to practice and perform. Many of them, as well as many universities, had Clubs of Amateur Song (&quot;&quot;Klub samodeyatelnoy pesni&quot;, or KSP), which, in fact, were clubs of bard song and which stood quite apart from the mainstream Soviet &quot;samodeyatelnost&quot;.

Grushinsky festival traces its origins to tourist song fan meetings, but now includes songs from all genres.

:&quot;Compare:&quot; Tramping song, a similar tradition in the Czech Republic.

=== Political song ===
Songs of this kind expressed protest against the Soviet way of life. The genre varied from acutely political, &quot;anti-Soviet&quot; songs to witty satire in the best traditions of Aesop. Some of Bulat Okudzhava&#x27;s songs touch on these themes.

Vladimir Vysotsky was perceived as a political songwriter, although he was also part of the mainstream culture. It was not so with Alexander Galich, who was eventually forced to emigrate; owning a tape with his songs could mean a prison term in the USSR. Before emigration, he suffered from KGB persecution, as did another bard, Yuliy Kim. Others, like Evgeny Kliachkin and Aleksander Dolsky, maintained a balance between outright &quot;anti-Soviet&quot; and plain romantic material.

Ironically, &quot;songs&quot; from pro-Communist plays by Bertolt Brecht, supposedly criticizing fascism and capitalist society (and thus applauded by the Soviets), could be seen as protest songs, and hence were popular among bards. These were often called &quot;zongs&quot; (the German pronunciation of the word &quot;song&quot;).

=== Outlaw songs ===
These songs, known in Russian as &quot;blatnaya pesnya&quot;, originated long before the bards appeared in the Soviet Union. Their origin can be traced as far back as the first decade of the 20th century. While not differing much in style from other bard songs, these songs can be compared in their content to modern rap: glorification of crime and city romance. These songs reflected the breakup of the structure and rules of the old Russian society.

Since the 1930s, new outlaw songs had emerged from the Gulag. Many of these songs were concerned with innocent people who were sent to the labour camps, rather than with criminals. Some songs were actually composed in the camps.

During the Khrushchev Thaw years, many were released from the camps, and with them came their songs. Some bards learned of these anonymous songs and started singing them. At that point, the songs gained a more symbolic meaning of struggle against oppression. Bards such as Alexander Rosenbaum also wrote many humorous outlaw songs about the Jewish mafia in Odesa. Many of these songs were inspired by authors like Isaac Babel.

=== Other songs ===

Even more common than the tourist songs were songs about ordinary life (usually life in the USSR). Nearly every bard wrote a significant number of songs on this theme. The setting is very frequently urban, often in major cities such as Moscow (particularly the Arbat). Some songs of this type, such as the ones by Yuri Vizbor and Vladimir Vysotsky, took a very direct approach and used simple and honest language to illustrate life. Other bards, such as Bulat Okudzhava, took a more symbolic approach and expressed their views on life through extended metaphors and symbolism. Another type of song that appeared in Russia long before the bards was the &quot;War Song&quot;. Many of the most famous bards wrote numerous songs about war, particularly The Great Patriotic War (WWII). Bards had various reasons for writing and singing songs about war. Okudzhava, who actually fought in the war, used his sad and emotional style to illustrate the futility of war in songs such as &quot;The Paper Soldier&quot; (&quot;Бумажный cолдат&quot;). Vladimir Vysotsky wrote songs about war simply because they provided that extreme setting in which honour and emotional strength are needed, and a man&#x27;s true character can be seen. Vysotsky&#x27;s war songs were praised by veterans for their extreme success in portraying war, despite the fact that the poet did not actually serve in the military. Yuri Vizbor wrote war songs in which the people involved in the war were the most important element, rather than the war itself. In these songs, the war would often be happening in the background while the actual song would be in the style of the tourist song, with emphasis on nature and human emotions.

Many bards wrote songs about their hometowns, such as Vladimir Vysotsky about Moscow&#x27;s &quot;Big Karetny&quot;(&quot;Большой Каретный&quot;), Alexander Rosenbaum about Saint Petersburg&#x27;s &quot;Ligovka&quot; (&quot;Лиговка&quot;), Leonid Dukhovny about Kyiv&#x27;s &quot;Podol&quot; (&quot;А Без Подола Киев Невозможен&quot;)

Some bards also wrote children&#x27;s songs for various festivals and plays. These songs enjoyed great success, as the poets chose to write them in the same fashion as their other songs. This resulted in songs that, while directed at children, still had deep meaning behind them and were enjoyed by adults, not unlike Ivan Krylov&#x27;s fables. The most famous bard performers who sang children&#x27;s songs were the husband and wife duo Sergey Nikitin and Tatyana Nikitina. Sergey and Tatyana are still considered bards, even though they are known primarily for setting great works of poetry to their own music.

<doc id="492147" wikidata="Q2355527" url="?curid=492147" title="United Nations Security Council Resolution 687">
<text>United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 was adopted on 3 April 1991. After reaffirming resolutions 660, 661, 662, 664, 665, 666, 667, 669, 670, 674, 677, 678 (all 1990) and 686 (1991), the Council set the terms, in a comprehensive resolution, with which Iraq was to comply after losing the Gulf War. Resolution 687 was passed by 12 votes to one (Cuba) against, with two abstentions from Ecuador and Yemen, after a very extended meeting. Iraq accepted the provisions of the resolution on 6 April 1991.

== Details ==
Resolution 687, divided into nine sections, firstly urged Iraq and Kuwait to respect the boundary between the two countries, calling on the Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar to assist in demarcating the border. It requested the Secretary-General to submit, within one month, a plan for the deployment of the United Nations Iraq–Kuwait Observation Mission along the demilitarized zone which was established to be 10 km into Iraq and 5 km into Kuwait.

=== Weapons of Mass Destruction ===
The Council reminded Iraq of its obligations under the Geneva Protocol and to unconditionally remove and destroy all chemical and biological weapons and ballistic missiles with a range greater than 150 km. As part of this demand, the Council requested Iraq submit, within 15 days, a report declaring all locations of all the aforementioned weapons and agree to urgent, on-site inspections. It then established the United Nations Special Commission relating to inspections and set provisions for it, and asked Iraq to abide by its obligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, agreeing not to develop nuclear weapons and submitting a report to the Secretary-General and International Atomic Energy Agency within 15 days. The resolution noted that these actions &quot;represent steps towards the goal of establishing in the Middle East a zone free from weapons of mass destruction and all missiles for their delivery and the objective of a global ban on chemical weapons&quot;.

After discussing the facilitation of repatriations of prisoners of war and co-operation with the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Council required Iraq to inform the Council that it did not commit to or support terrorism and would not allow such acts to take place in its territory.

=== Iraq liability for Kuwaiti losses ===
Resolution 687 then referred to repatriations and compensation, stating Iraq is liable for any loss, damage, and injury inflicted upon Kuwait, further demanding that Iraq hand over any remaining property seized from Kuwait. It also declared null and void any statements by Iraq regarding its refusal to repay its foreign debt, and decided to create a fund for these compensation claims (the United Nations Compensation Commission, officially established in Resolution 692).

=== Review of sanctions against Iraq ===
Regarding sanctions, the Council reiterated international sanctions against Iraq do not apply to foodstuffs or medical aid to the civilian populations of Iraq and Kuwait, as well as removing sanctions placed on Iraq in Resolution 661 (1990) and decided to review these restrictions every 60 days. However, sales of weapons and other related material to Iraq will continue to be prohibited.

== Effects ==
Upon Iraq&#x27;s acceptance of all paragraphs of the resolution, a formal ceasefire began between Iraq and Kuwait and Member States co-operating with Kuwait.

=== Use of resolution for American attacks ===
The most important part of the resolution was the concluding paragraph 34, which required that &quot;[the Security Council]...[d]ecides...to take such further steps as may be required for the implementation of the present resolution and to secure peace and security in the area.&quot; This paragraph, and similar provisions in Resolution 678, were used by the United States and United Kingdom as legal justification for their 1996 bombing of Iraq, 1998 bombing of Iraq, and 2003 invasion of Iraq, with officials claiming the resolutions provided authority to &quot;use all necessary means&quot; to compel Iraq to comply with its UN obligations. This reasoning was heavily criticized at the time by numerous experts in international law, and later called into question by the UK&#x27;s own public inquiry into the Iraq war.

<text>Fener (; ), also spelled Phanar, is a quarter midway up the Golden Horn in the district of Fatih in Istanbul, Turkey. The Turkish name is derived from the Greek word &quot;phanarion&quot; (Medieval Greek: Φανάριον), meaning lantern, streetlight or lamppost; the neighborhood was so called because of a column topped with a lantern which stood here in the Byzantine period and was used as a street light or lighthouse.

Fener was a traditionally Greek neighbourhood during the Ottoman era and its streets still contain many old stone houses and churches dating from Byzantine and Ottoman times. The grand mansions between the main road and the shore of the Golden Horn were often used to store wood imported from the Black Sea (Pontos) area; one now houses Istanbul&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Library. Their picturesque façades were damaged as a result of street-widening work from the 1930s onwards.

Fener is sandwiched between Cibali and Balat on the southern shore of the Golden Horn. The steep hills behind it run up to the Fatih neighbourhood.

Fener is served by the T5 tram line which links it with Cibali and the small bus terminal (for buses to Anatolia) at Alibeyköy. The Golden Horn ferry also stops at Fener, linking it to Üsküdar, Karaköy, Kasımpaşa, Balat, Ayvansaray, Hasköy, Sütlüce and Eyüp.

==History==
After the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, Fener became home to many of the Greeks living in the city. The Patriarchate of Constantinople also moved here and remains here today. As a result, the term &quot;Phanar&quot; is sometimes used as a shorthand reference to the Ecumenical Patriarchate, just as &quot;Vatican&quot; is used for the Holy See of the Roman Catholic Church.

During the Ottoman period, the Greek inhabitants of Fener were called Phanariotes and often served the Sultan in important roles. Wealthy Phanariotes often served as &quot;dragomans&quot; (translators) or became the governors of provinces in the Balkans and Greece. Several served as hospodars of Wallachia and Moldavia between 1711 and 1821.

==Attractions==
Fener&#x27;s most notable attraction is the walled compound that encloses the Patriarchal Church of St. George, home to the patriarch who is still head of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, one of fifteen to seventeen independent jurisdictions of the Eastern Orthodox Church. The current holder of the office is Patriarch Batholomew I. The patriarchate moved here in 1602 but a fire in 1720 destroyed the original basilican church on the site. Another fire in 1941 did further damage to the older buildings in the compound; aside from the church itself and the brick-and-stone library at the end of the garden most of what a visitor sees today is fairly new. The Middle Gate (Orta Kapı) leading into the compound has been sealed since the then Patriarch was hanged there in 1821 when Greece rebelled against Ottoman suzerainty. Crowds, including visitors from Athens, flock here for the celebration of Greek Orthodox Easter.

The Church of St Mary of the Mongols (Panagia Muhliotissa, Theotokos Panagiotussa), inland and uphill from the Patriarchate, is interesting as the one church in Constantinople that was never turned into a mosque, even after the Conquest of Istanbul in 1453. The architect Atik Sinan (not to be confused with the better known Mimar Sinan) is said to have persuaded Sultan Mehmet II to allow it to continue providing services for the Greek population and a copy of the &quot;ferman&quot; (edict) decreeing this still hangs on the church wall.

Near the Church of St Mary of the Mongols is the huge red-brick Phanar Greek Orthodox College. The historian Dimitri Cantemir was a student here in the 17th century. Today it has only a tiny number of pupils. A second Greek school in Fener, the Maraşlı Greek Orthodox Primary School, is also an imposing building but no longer has any pupils.

Battered remnants of the Sea Walls that used to close Constantinople off from the Golden Horn still skirt Fener. The Ayakapı gate through the walls is believed to have been designed by Mimar Sinan in 1562.

The back streets of Fener are full of two and three-storied terraced houses often with &quot;cumbas&quot; (bay windows) as well as a handful of much grander houses. Many have been converted to house cafes, restaurants and tourist accommodation.

===Blessing of the Waters===
As elsewhere in the Orthodox world, every 6 January - the Feast of the Epiphany - a ceremony called the &quot;Blessing of the Waters&quot; take place in which a priest tosses a cross into water and swimmers race to see who can bring it back to shore first. In Istanbul this ceremony is performed by the Patriarch who tosses a cross into the Golden Horn to be retrieved by the swimmers.

<doc id="492150" wikidata="Q152028" url="?curid=492150" title="Bluff, New Zealand">
<text>Bluff (), previously known as Campbelltown and often referred to as &quot;The Bluff&quot;, is a town and seaport in the Southland region, on the southern coast of the South Island of New Zealand serving as the main port of Invercargill. It is the southernmost town in mainland New Zealand and, despite Slope Point and Stewart Island being further south, Bluff is colloquially used to refer to the southern extremity of the country (particularly in the phrase &quot;from Cape Reinga to The Bluff&quot;). According to the 2018 census, the resident population was 1,797, a decrease of 6 since 2013.

The Bluff area was one of the earliest areas of New Zealand where a European presence became established. The first ship known to have entered the harbour was the &quot;Perseverance&quot; in 1813, in search of flax trading possibilities, with the first European settlers arriving in 1823 or 1824.

This is the foundation for the claim that Bluff is the oldest permanent European settlement in the country. However, the missionary settlement at Kerikeri was both earlier and larger. The town was officially called Campbelltown in 1856, became a borough in 1878, and was renamed Bluff in 1917.

==Geography==
Bluff is by road from Invercargill, and the southern terminus of the Bluff Branch, the continuation from Invercargill of the Main South Line. This was one of New Zealand&#x27;s earliest railways, opening on 5 February 1867.

Bluff is at the end of a peninsula that forms the western side of Bluff Harbour and Awarua Bay, with the port located in the relatively narrow entrance channel. It is on State Highway 1, which terminates one kilometre to the south of the town at Stirling Point. At Stirling Point, there is &quot;the town&#x27;s biggest tourist attraction&quot;, a signpost showing the distance and direction to various major cities and locations around the world, including the Equator and the South Pole. The signpost was corrected in late 2018, after a Scottish tourist pointed out in 2017 that there were some errors.

Bluff is dominated by Bluff Hill / Motupōhue (standing at ), which provides some shelter from the prevailing westerly winds. There is a path along the shore through native bush up to this point. The town is named for this bluff, which was known to early whalers as Old Man&#x27;s Bluff or Old Man Bluff. East across the entry channel from Bluff is Tiwai Point, home to New Zealand&#x27;s only aluminium smelter and its wharf. Alumina is shipped from Australia and electricity is supplied by the Manapouri Power Station in Fiordland National Park.

A chain sculpture on the coast near Bluff symbolises the Māori belief that Stewart Island is anchored to South Island; a similar sculpture in Rakiura National Park represents the other end of the chain.

==Demographics==

Bluff covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.

Bluff had a population of 1,797 at the 2018 New Zealand census, a decrease of 6 people (−0.3%) since the 2013 census, and unchanged since the 2006 census. There were 780 households, comprising 918 males and 879 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.04 males per female. The median age was 47.3 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 330 people (18.4%) aged under 15 years, 228 (12.7%) aged 15 to 29, 858 (47.7%) aged 30 to 64, and 381 (21.2%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 77.6% European/Pākehā, 46.4% Māori, 6.2% Pasifika, 1.3% Asian, and 1.5% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity. The percentage of people born overseas was 6.0, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census question about religious affiliation, 54.9% had no religion, 32.7% were Christian, 1.0% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.2% were Hindu, 0.2% were Muslim, 0.5% were Buddhist and 1.0% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 102 (7.0%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 528 (36.0%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $30,500, compared with $31,800 nationally. 189 people (12.9%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 726 (49.5%) people were employed full-time, 228 (15.5%) were part-time, and 45 (3.1%) were unemployed.

==Economy==

South Port is the port operating company of the Port of Bluff, and is owned to 66.5% by the Southland Regional Council. A small port in comparison with New Zealand giants like Ports of Auckland or Port of Tauranga, it moves around 2.2 million tonnes of cargo each year, mostly New Zealand coastal reshipment. The Tiwai Point aluminium smelter and fossil fuel exploration activity in the Great South Basin may ensure the future relevance of the port. A recent (2008) weekly container ship service also lifted the volumes.

In July 2020, Rio Tinto announced closure of the aluminium smelter in August 2021, after which discussions were initiated on how to utilise the energy generated in Manapouri.

Bluff Harbour is the terminus for the twice-daily catamaran ferry to Stewart Island / Rakiura, south across Foveaux Strait. It is the main gateway for New Zealand ships heading down to the Antarctic. The harbour is home to the Foveaux Strait oyster fleet. Bluff oysters are renowned for their succulence and flavour, and are considered a delicacy nationwide, with Bluff holding an annual oyster festival. The oyster quota was severely reduced during the 1990s due to the effects of the toxic protozoan parasite &quot;Bonamia exitiosa&quot; upon the oyster beds.

The Bluff Branch (formerly the Invercargill-Bluff Railway) was the first railway line in Otago and Southland.

==Culture==
Te Rau Aroha marae is located at Bluff. It is a &quot;marae&quot; (meeting ground) for the Awarua Rūnanga branch of Ngāi Tahu, and includes the Tahu Potiki &quot;wharenui&quot;.

==Attractions==
The town previously included the Paua House, created by Fred and Myrtle Flutey. This was an ordinary bungalow transformed by having the outside walls totally covered in pāua shells. The interior was also extensively decorated with paua and there is an extensive collection of (often kitsch) paua-decorated ornaments, utensils and trinkets.

The house became a museum after the death of the owners, but was sold and in March 2007 the exhibits removed to Christchurch. It has been on permanent display at the Canterbury Museum since July 2008.

The Bluff Maritime Museum contains an extensive collection of models, boats, artefacts, displays, a working triple expansion engine and a full sized oystering boat, the &quot;Monica&quot;.

==Education==

Bluff School is a state full primary school serving years 1 to 8 with a roll of students as of The school opened in 1867.

St Teresa&#x27;s School is a state-integrated Catholic school serving years 1 to 8 with a roll of students. It has been operating since at least 1901.

<doc id="492151" wikidata="Q6260332" url="?curid=492151" title="John Taylor (Master of the Rolls)">
<text>John Taylor (c. 1480 – 1534) was Master of the Rolls of the Court of Chancery from 1527 to 1534, following a successful career as a priest and civil servant.

Taylor would have been notable just for the circumstances of his birth: he was the firstborn of healthy triplets who all survived to adulthood, which was virtually unheard of in the 15th century. He was awarded doctor of decrees and of the sacred canons beyond sea at the University of Cambridge in 1520; and incorporated at Oxford in 1552.

King Henry VII met John and his brothers Rowland and Nathaniel in their childhood and undertook responsibility to educate the three boys if they came to manhood; this informal act and others like it later inspired Queen Victoria&#x27;s Royal Bounty for Triplets, which continued until the reign of Elizabeth II. There is note in the Royal Privy Purse expenses of 1498 &quot;for the wages of the King’s Scoler John Taillor at Oxenford.&quot;

During his lifetime, Taylor donated money towards the building of St. James Church in Barton-under-Needwood, Staffordshire, the village where he grew up. Construction began in 1517 and was completed in 1533. The John Taylor High School, a specialty science school founded in Barton-under-Needwood in 1957, was named in his honor.

==Career==
In 1503, Taylor was ordained Rector at Bishop&#x27;s Hatfield, and then became Rector of Sutton Coldfield in 1504. He served as one of the Royal Chaplains at Henry VII&#x27;s funeral, 21 April 1509, and was afterwards appointed by King Henry VIII as the King&#x27;s Clerk and Chaplain—he was later one of the commissioners to decide if Henry VIII&#x27;s marriage to Catherine of Aragon was valid. In 1511, he was made Clerk of the Parliament.

Taylor was appointed as Archdeacon of Derby in 1515, then as Royal Ambassador to Burgundy and France and Prolocutor of Convocation. In 1516, he was appointed Archdeacon of Buckingham, and was conferred the degrees of Doctor of Civil Law and Doctor of Canon Law at Cambridge in 1520. He was one of ten chaplains present at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. In 1528 he became Archdeacon of Halifax.

From 1527 to 1534 he was Master of the Rolls of the Court of Chancery. This position was the third most senior judicial position in England (after Lord Chancellor and Lord Chief Justice).

==Death and burial==
According to John Stow&#x27;s &quot;Survey of London&quot; (1598), he was buried in St. Anthony&#x27;s Hospital, St Benet Fink, in the City of London.

<text>Linda Hunt (born Lydia Susanna Hunt; April 2, 1945) is an American actress. She made her film debut playing Mrs. Oxheart in &quot;Popeye&quot; (1980). Her portrayal of the male character Billy Kwan in &quot;The Year of Living Dangerously&quot; (1982) won her the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, making her the first and, as of 2024, the only person to win an Oscar for portraying a character of the opposite sex. Hunt has also appeared in films such as &quot;Dune&quot; (1984), &quot;Silverado&quot; (1985), &quot;Kindergarten Cop&quot; (1990), &quot;Pocahontas&quot; (1995), &quot;Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World&quot; (1998), and &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot; (2006).

Hunt has had a successful career on television and in voice-over work, notably being the narrator for the Ancient Greek mythology themed &quot;God of War&quot; video game series. From 1997 to 2002, she played the recurring role of Judge Zoey Hiller on &quot;The Practice&quot; and played Commander Chennault on the sci-fi series &quot;Space Rangers&quot;. From 2009 to 2023, she portrayed Henrietta &quot;Hetty&quot; Lange on the CBS television series &quot;&quot;, a role for which she has received two Teen Choice Awards.

==Early life==
Hunt was born on April 2, 1945, in Morristown, New Jersey. Her father, Raymond Davy Hunt (1902–1985), was vice president of Harper Fuel Oil. Her mother, Elsie Doying Hunt (1903 – c. 1994), was a piano teacher who taught at the Westport School of Music, and performed with the Saugatuck Congregational Church Choir in Westport, Connecticut, the town where Hunt would be raised. She has one sibling, an older sister named Marcia (born 1940). Hunt attended the Interlochen Arts Academy and graduated from the Goodman School of Drama at the Art Institute of Chicago (now at DePaul University).

==Career==
===Theatre===
Hunt was a well-known live-stage actress before she entered film and television. She made her Broadway debut in the 1975 revival of &quot;Ah, Wilderness&quot;. She was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for her work in the 1984 play &quot;End of the World&quot;. She also received two ensemble Obie Awards for her work Off-Broadway in &quot;Top Girls&quot; and &quot;A Metamorphosis in Miniature&quot;.

Hunt created the role of Aunt Dan in Wallace Shawn&#x27;s play &quot;Aunt Dan and Lemon&quot;. She was a member of the Long Wharf Theatre Company in Connecticut, where she performed the Player Queen in a production of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, amongst other roles. She portrayed Sister Aloysius in the Pasadena Playhouse production of John Patrick Shanley&#x27;s play &quot;Doubt&quot;.

In an interview with writer Craig Gholson and actor Vincent Caristi, Hunt said: &quot;Acting onstage is like an explosion each night. And what comes in at you all the time as you are trying to . . . create something which is a tremendous act of organization and concentration.&quot;

===Film===
Known for her small stature, Hunt made her film debut in 1980 in Robert Altman&#x27;s musical comedy &quot;Popeye&quot;.

Two years later, Hunt co-starred as Billy Kwan in &quot;The Year of Living Dangerously&quot;, Peter Weir&#x27;s film adaptation of the novel of the same name. For her work in this film, Hunt won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in 1983, becoming the first person to win an Oscar for playing a character of the opposite sex. In her screen test, Hunt wore a hairpiece, a fake moustache, and &quot;paste-on pieces above her eyes to [appear] Asian.&quot; To play the role, Hunt had her hair dyed and cut short, had her eyebrows shaved, wore padding and makeup, and wore something in her shirt pocket. In her 1986 interview with the &quot;Bomb&quot; magazine, Hunt remarked that Billy Kwan &quot;is supra-personal [with] layers of sexual ambiguity[.]&quot;

Hunt also played the Shadout Mapes in &quot;Dune&quot; (1984 film), a nurse in &quot;She-Devil&quot; (1989), the austere school principal Miss Schlowski opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger in &quot;Kindergarten Cop&quot; (1990), and assassin Ilsa Grunt in &quot;If Looks Could Kill&quot; (1991).

Her co-stars on the series included Chris O&#x27;Donnell, LL Cool J, Daniela Ruah, Eric Christian Olsen, Miguel Ferrer and Barrett Foa. Hunt was a main cast member on the series for twelve seasons, but was downgraded to a special guest star position in season thirteen as a safety precaution due to the COVID-19 pandemic. She was supposed to return in the series finale, but was unable to due to availability issues. As a result, her return was condensed to a voiceover. Hunt won two Teen Choice Awards for her work on &quot;NCIS: Los Angeles&quot;.

<doc id="492154" wikidata="Q304887" url="?curid=492154" title="Abaiang">
<text>Abaiang, also known as Apaiang, Apia, and in the past, Charlotte Island, in the Northern Gilbert Islands, is a coral atoll of Kiribati, located in the west-central Pacific Ocean. Abaiang was the island of the first missionary to arrive in the Gilberts, Hiram Bingham II. Abaiang has a population of 5,872 (2020 census).

==Geography==
Abaiang Atoll is in the northern Gilberts, located not very far to the north of Tarawa. Abaiang is the fourth most northerly in the Gilberts chain of atolls, with a total land area of . The atoll has a lagoon that provides sheltered anchorage.

The main island of Abaiang, &quot;Teiro&quot; (not to be confused with the small islet of &quot;Teirio&quot;) has a total land area of extends from the northern village of Takarano to the southern village of Tabontebike. It occupies the complete eastern rim and also encircles the southern part of the atoll, stretching over a distance of some Its width ranges from no more than to more than , averaging . It contains 16 of the 18 villages of the atoll. Two other islets, Riboono and Nuotaea are also inhabited. The remaining islets of Abaiang but Taete, with a land area of are mainly uninhabited, with lack of water and remoteness from the mainland being the main issues. They however are used for fishing, copra cutting and campsites. The islets of Ouba and Teirio have had small motels built on them, with staff travelling from the mainland of Abaiang and from Tarawa when guests are expected.

In the southwest of Abaiang there is a channel, the Bingham Channel, which is the basic conjunction between the lagoon and the Pacific. The channel is between the biggest island of Abaiang (in the east) and a very little island in the southwest of Abaiang called Teirio.

==Effects of climate change==
Global warming has created a problem for Abaiang and Kiribati, among other island groups. Houses in Tebunginako village have been abandoned. As storm surges becoming more frequent and spring tides more forceful, eventually the erosion was so great that the village had to be abandoned. The remains of about 100 thatched homes and a maneabe (community meeting hall) are now up to offshore. The villagers relocated themselves further inland, with the new village retaining the same name.

==Villages==
In the 2010 Census the total population of 5,502 was spread among 18 villages, with the largest villages being Nuotaea (559 inhabitants) and Tuarabu (560 inhabitants).

==Economy==

Relative to other islands of Kiribati, Abaiang has some important economic advantages. Its large lagoon supports a striking diversity of coral and fish species, providing plentiful seafood to the local population and attracting tourists to the island from nearby South Tarawa. While the island is prone to drought, in normal years the rainfall is sufficient to support breadfruit, banana and papaya as well as the ubiquitous coconut. The closeness of Abaiang to Tarawa also facilitates a significant, though largely informal, trade in local food of all types.

However like all outer islands of Kiribati, Abaiang is basically a subsistence economy, with a small number of jobs, mainly working for the Government or Island Council. Other sources of income are copra production, and remittances from relatives working in South Tarawa, as crew on international vessels, or overseas.

Climate change has forced a change, as milkfish are not as common and plant life is dying off to the increased salt in the water table.

== Regional support for organic farming ==

The island of Abaiang has committed to having 100% of its farm agriculture produced organically. Another Pacific island to have made this commitment is Cicia in Fiji.

==Schools==
There are ten primary schools on Abaiang, with a combined roll of 985 students in 2011.

At the secondary school level, in 2011 there were 212 students at the Ministry of Education school, Ueen Abaiang, which is located between the villages of Koinawa and Aonobuaka. A further 135 students are enrolled at St Joseph&#x27;s College in Tabwiroa and 23 students at Steven Whitmee High School in Morikao, making 370 secondary school students in total. The two high schools at Morikao and Tabuiroa accommodate students from all over Kiribati who have passed the entrance examinations to get into the schools.

==History==

By tradition, the first inhabitants of Abaiang Island were known to be spirits, some of them created in Samoa and some in Abaiang. Years passed by and then Pacific Islanders came along followed then by the arrival of Thomas Gilbert, then Reverend Dr. Bingham and his team in 1857, international traders, beachcombers, whalers and even blackbirders. Colonizers then came along and hoisted the Union Jack on the island.

The first European to document the island was Thomas Gilbert in 1788. He named the island Matthew&#x27;s Island, named for the owner of his ship, the &quot;Charlotte&quot;. Subsequently, errors changed the name to Charlotte Island. Then the first missionary to live in Kiribati arrived at Abaiang on 16 November 1857. He was Hiram Bingham II of the American Board, a Boston-based missionary group. This Hiram Bingham was the son of Hiram Bingham I who was one of the first and most influential missionaries to Hawaii. Hiram Bingham II and his wife were accompanied to Abaiang by Hawaiian pastor Joel Hulu Mahoe and his wife. Bingham landed at the village of Koinawa and a memorial was erected at the spot during the centennial celebrations in 1957.

During World War II, the Imperial Japanese Army occupied the island from December 1941 to November 1943. It was captured by the U.S. military and used as an offensive staging base.

==Main sights==
Abaiang Post Office opened around 1910.

The Catholic community also has strong ties to Abaiang and completed the building of the imposing Church of Our Lady of the Rosary, also at Koinawa village, in October 1907. This work was done under the supervision of a priest from Belgium who was given the local name of Father Ioane. He lived and worked so long on Abaiang and became so well loved that the village of Borotiam was named in honour of his home country Belgium (Borotiam being the local vernacular for Belgium). This church celebrated its centennial in 2007 with a fresh paint job and a celebration whose special guest was the current President.

The foremost institution of Abaiang is St. Josephs College. The Principal during the country&#x27;s silver jubilee celebrations was Paul Chilton, a British migrant. St. Joseph&#x27;s College was founded in 1939. In the past 65 years it has gone from strength to strength and is now a leading centre for learning in Kiribati. Its alumni include both current President His Excellency Anote Tong, and previous incumbent Teburoro Tito.

<doc id="492158" wikidata="Q936194" url="?curid=492158" title="Home on the Range (2004 film)">
<text>Home on the Range is a 2004 American animated Western musical comedy film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It was the last Disney traditionally animated film released until &quot;The Princess and the Frog&quot; in 2009. The film was written and directed by Will Finn and John Sanford, and produced by Alice Dewey Goldstone, from a story by Finn, Sanford, Mark Kennedy, Michael LaBash, Sam Levine, and Robert Lence. It features original songs written by Alan Menken and Glenn Slater, and an original musical orchestral score also composed by Menken.

Named after the popular cowboy song of the same name, which also serves as the state song of Kansas, the film stars the voices of Roseanne Barr, Judi Dench, Jennifer Tilly, Cuba Gooding Jr., Randy Quaid, and Steve Buscemi. &quot;Home on the Range&quot; is set in the Old West, and centers on a mismatched trio of dairy cows—brash, adventurous Maggie; prim, proper Mrs. Calloway; and ditzy, happy-go-lucky Grace. The three cows must capture an infamous rustler named Alameda Slim for his bounty in order to save their idyllic farm from foreclosure. Aiding them in their quest is Lucky Jack, a feisty, peg-legged rabbit, and a selfish horse named Buck, eagerly working in the service of Rico, a famous bounty hunter, who seeks the glory for himself.

&quot;Home on the Range&quot; premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on March 21, 2004, and was released in the United States on April 2. It received mixed reviews from critics and was a box office failure, grossing $145.3 million worldwide against a production budget of $110 million.

== Plot ==
In 1889, amidst the Old West, wanted cattle rustler Alameda Slim steals most of Dixon Ranch&#x27;s cattle. The ranch owner, Mr. Dixon, sells the remaining cow, Maggie a show cow, to Pearl, a kind, aging woman who runs a small farm called Patch of Heaven. Sam, the local Sheriff, arrives to tell Pearl that unless she pays back the bank in three days, her farm will be sold to the highest bidder. Hearing this, Maggie convinces farm cows Grace and Mrs. Calloway to go to town with her to win prize money at a fair. While the cows are in town, a bounty hunter named Rico drops off a criminal, collects their reward, and looks for a replacement horse while his rests. Idolizing him, Sam&#x27;s horse, Buck, convinces Rico to take him. Upon seeing this and learning the reward for capturing Slim will cover Pearl&#x27;s debt, Maggie convinces the other cows to help her collect the reward to save Patch of Heaven.

That night, they hide among a large herd of steers as they are smitten by two longhorns Barry and Bob. Slim arrives on the back of his bison Junior with his nephews the Willies. Before Maggie can attack him, Slim starts yodeling, which puts all of the cattle except the tone-deaf Grace into a hypnotic trance, allowing Slim to lead them away. Grace brings Maggie and Mrs. Calloway back to their senses, before Slim uses a landslide to cover his escape. Narrowly missing him, Rico and his men discuss their next move, while Buck argues with the cows, leading Rico to believe he is unreliable and return him to Sam. However, Buck escapes, determined to capture Slim for himself to prove his worth.

The cows continue their search in the hopes of capturing Slim before Buck, until they lose the trail during a flash flood and have a falling out, with Mrs. Calloway believing Maggie only wants revenge and Patch of Heaven would be better off without her. Along the way, the cows are joined by a peg-legged jackrabbit named Lucky Jack, who also lost his home, an old mine, to Slim. The cows decide to follow him, with Mrs. Calloway and Maggie making a deal that after the farm is saved, they will go their separate ways. With Lucky Jack’s help, the cows discover Slim converted the mine into his hideout and stole cattle from his former patrons to render them unable to support their land. When the subsequent auctions occur, he then disguises himself as respectable businessman &quot;Yancy O&#x27;Dell&quot; to buy their land using the money he makes from selling off the stolen cattle.

The cows and Jack capture Slim, and rush back to Patch of Heaven, with the Willies and Rico in pursuit. Learning Rico works for Slim, a devastated Buck helps the cows fight him, setting the stolen cattle free in the process. Slim escapes and dons his disguise to buy Patch of Heaven, but the cows return and join forces with Buck, Jack, and the rest of Patch of Heaven&#x27;s farm animals to defeat and expose him. As Sam arrests Slim, Pearl uses the reward money to save her farm.

At first, Mrs. Calloway (who had come to like Maggie) and Grace are sad that Maggie had seemingly left, but their spirits are lifted when they see that Maggie decided to stay. The three cows, along with Barry, Bob, and Junior, celebrate with a square dance as Lucky Jack and Jen finish recounting the story and we see that Mrs. Calloway, Grace and the rest of the farm animals won prizes as show livestock in the State Fair.

==Production==
Before he pitched &quot;Pocahontas&quot; (1995), director Mike Gabriel considered adapting Western legends such as Annie Oakley, Buffalo Bill, and Pecos Bill into animated films. While he pitched both projects at the Gong Show meeting, the executives were more interested in &quot;Pocahontas&quot;, which went into production first. When &quot;Pocahontas&quot; was finished, Gabriel went back to his Western pitch and came up with an &quot;idea that might combine &quot;Captains Courageous&quot; with a Western.&quot; The initial story involved a young boy from the Far East whose father owns a railroad and sends his son to the Western United States to teach him maturity. According to Gabriel, &quot;the train gets held up by outlaws over a train trestle, and the little boy gets knocked off the train ... He splashes in the river and ends up on a cattle drive.&quot; Gabriel developed his story into a forty-page film treatment, which was well received by then-Feature Animation president Peter Schneider. Soon after, the project, then titled &quot;Sweating Bullets&quot;, went into development.

Inspired by the song &quot;Ghost Riders in the Sky&quot;, the story was then revised into a supernatural western about a timid cowboy who visits a ghost town and confronts an undead cattle hustler named Slim. In this version, he and the Willies rode their ghost herds through the clouds and constantly drove livestock off cliffs to increase their herd. It was later reconceived into a story about a little bull named Bullets, that wanted to be more like the horses that led the herd. In 1999, in an attempt to salvage the production and retain the existing characters and background art, story artist Michael LaBash suggested a different approach to the story with one that involved three cow protagonists who become bounty hunters to save the farm. Building on the idea, fellow story artists Sam Levine, Mark Kennedy, Robert Lence, and Shirley Pierce developed a new storyline. However, by October 2000, Gabriel and co-director Mike Giaimo were removed from the project because of persistent story problems. Will Finn, who had returned to Disney Feature Animation after co-directing &quot;The Road to El Dorado&quot; (2000) at DreamWorks Animation, and John Sanford were hired as the new directors.

By this point, there were twelve storyboard artists and four screenwriters, including David Reynolds, working on the film. Finn and Sanford decided to downsize the writing team, with Reynolds later being recruited to write the &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; screenplay. At one point, the story incorporated elements from the Pied Piper story. Following a suggestion by Alan Menken, Alameda Slim was reconceived into a cattle huster who used his yodeling talents to hypnotize and abscond with the herd. The character Pearl Gesner, who was to be voiced by Sarah Jessica Parker, was rewritten into an elderly woman. Relatively late into production, the character Maggie was also rewritten to make her an outsider to the other farm animals in order to differentiate the group dynamic.

==Music==
In February 1998, Alan Menken had signed a long-term agreement with the Walt Disney Studios to compose songs and/or scores for animated and live-action films. Following this, according to Menken, he was attached to provide music for &quot;Sweating Bullets&quot; &quot;maybe a year and a half after &quot;Hercules&quot;&quot;. Shortly after winning the ASCAP Foundation Richard Rodgers New Horizons Award, lyricist Glenn Slater was brought to the attention of Menken, who invited Slater to work with him on &quot;Sweating Bullets&quot;.

Together, they wrote the first of the film&#x27;s six original songs back in 1999; the first of which was &quot;Little Patch of Heaven&quot; recorded by k.d. lang before Finn and Sanford were brought on board as directors. The villain song &quot;Yodel-Adle-Eedle-Idle-Oo,&quot; which incorporates the &quot;William Tell Overture,&quot; Yankee Doodle, Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony, and the &quot;1812 Overture&quot; into the yodel dance, was added following several story changes throughout production. Although Randy Quaid did his own singing for &quot;Yodel-Adle-Eedle-Idle-Oo&quot;, including the consonants heard during the yodels, the vowel sounds in the yodeling were overdubbed from ghost singers Randy Erwin and Kerry Christianson, two world champion yodelers. Following the September 11 attacks, Menken composed the song &quot;Will the Sun Ever Shine Again&quot; in reaction, which was performed by Bonnie Raitt.

The soundtrack album of the film was released on March 30, 2004 by Walt Disney Records. It contains vocal songs performed by k.d. lang, Randy Quaid, Bonnie Raitt, Tim McGraw, and The Beu Sisters along with the film&#x27;s score composed by Alan Menken.

===Songs===
Original songs performed in the film include:

==Release==
&quot;Home on the Range&quot; was initially scheduled for a 2003 release, while &quot;Brother Bear&quot; was originally slated for a spring 2004 release. However, Disney switched the release dates. Contrary to speculation, news writer Jim Hill stated the release date switch was not because &quot;Home on the Range&quot; was suffering from story rewrites, but to promote &quot;Brother Bear&quot; on the Platinum Edition release of &quot;The Lion King&quot;.

===Marketing===

The teaser trailer was released in May 2003. It was first attached to the theatrical release of &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;. The teaser was later attached to the theatrical screenings of &quot;Rugrats Go Wild&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Freaky Friday&quot;. And was later attached to other Disney home video releases. The next trailer for the film was released in November 2003 and was attached to the theatrical screenings of &quot;Brother Bear&quot;, &quot;Looney Tunes: Back in Action&quot; and the limited release of &quot;Clifford&#x27;s Really Big Movie&quot;.

===Home media===
&quot;Home on the Range&quot; was released on VHS and DVD on September 14, 2004. The DVD came with an animated short, &quot;&quot;, a series of 18 little shorts called the Joke Corral, and animated intros to the DVD menu. All three featuring the voice cast from the film. The film was released on Blu-ray on July 3, 2012.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
 On Metacritic, the film has a score of 50 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A–&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Nathan Rabin, reviewing for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, praised the film describing it as &quot;a sweet, raucously funny, comic Western that corrects a glaring historical injustice by finally surveying the Old West through the eyes of cows rather than cowboys.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film stars out of 4, saying that &quot;A movie like this is fun for kids: bright, quick-paced, with broad, outrageous characters. But &quot;Home on the Range&quot; doesn&#x27;t have the crossover quality of the great Disney films like &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and &quot;The Lion King&quot;. And it doesn&#x27;t have the freshness and originality of a more traditional movie like &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot;. Its real future, I suspect, lies in home video. It&#x27;s only 76 minutes long, but although kids will like it, their parents will be sneaking looks at their watches.&quot; Claudia Puig of &quot;USA Today&quot; wrote favorably in her review that &quot;&quot;Home on the Range&quot; is a throwback to old Disney cartoons: fun, rather than message-laden, with broad humor and entertaining action. The cheerful, plucky characters have heart and loyalty, and that&#x27;s enough to make this a worthy family-friendly animated fest.&quot; Nell Minow of Common Sense Media gave the film four out of five stars, saying that &quot;I love it when Disney doesn&#x27;t take itself too seriously. No one tried to reach for the stars or make this into a classic. &quot;Home on the Range&quot; is just a cute little story about some not-so-contented cows who save the day. It modestly aspires to be nothing more than a lot of fun, and it does that job very well.

Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticized the weak comedy writing that &quot;Unrestrained energy is hardly a bad thing for animation — the best cartoons are built on the contradictory pursuit of meticulously arranged anarchy—but they never seem needy, or desperate for laughs, as &quot;Home on the Range&quot; does. The film seems hungrier for a pat on the head than a chuckle.&quot; Similarly, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; film critic Kenneth Turan claimed &quot;&quot;Home on the Range&quot; may be acceptable on reflection, but its formulaic desire to mix wisecracks for adults with pratfalls for kids is feeling thin, and its overall air of frantic hysteria does not wear well either.&quot; Michael Wilmington of &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; noted &quot;Satirizing the movie Western can make for a great cartoon, as it does in Jiri Trnka&#x27;s brilliant 1949 Czech short &quot;Song of the Prairie,&quot; a puppet version of &quot;Stagecoach.&quot; But &quot;Home&quot; isn&#x27;t good satire or good slapstick. It does have those lyrical, catchy Menken tunes, and the film perks up whenever Raitt or lang sing one of them. But much of this movie is deadly. &quot;Home&quot; keeps milking the same gags and throwing the same bull, and after a while you feel cowed watching it.&quot;

===Box office===
On its opening box office weekend, &quot;Home on the Range&quot; grossed about $14 million in box office estimates, opening fourth behind &quot;Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed&quot;, &quot;Walking Tall&quot;, and &quot;Hellboy&quot;. Following the disappointing box office weekend, financial analysts predicted that Disney would be forced to write-down the production costs, which totaled more than $100 million. Following the latter release of &quot;The Alamo&quot; (2004), which also met poor box office returns, it was reported that Disney would have to write-down about $70 million. The film ended its box office run with $50 million in domestic earnings and $145.3 million worldwide.

===Accolades===
==Video game==
A video game for Game Boy Advance, titled &quot;Disney presents Home on the Range&quot; or &quot;Disney&#x27;s Home on the Range&quot; depending on territory, was released in 2004.

<text>This is a list of notable events in the history of LGBT rights that took place in the year 1978.

==Events==

*The city of Berkeley, California, prohibits employment discrimination based on sexual orientation in the private sector.
*San Francisco adds Article 33 to the San Francisco Police Code, which prohibits discrimination in employment, housing and public accommodations based on sexual orientation in the private sector.

===April===
* 19 — 1,500 gays and supporters rally on the steps of the state capitol in St. Paul, Minnesota, in support of the gay rights provision in the city&#x27;s human rights ordinance.
* 25 — St. Paul, Minnesota, voters repeal a provision in the city&#x27;s human rights ordinance that protects gays and lesbians from discrimination. The ordinance is repealed by a 2-to-1 margin; 54,096 in favor of repeal, 31,694 against.

===May===
* 9 — Voters in the U.S. city of Wichita, Kansas, repeal a gay rights ordinance by a nearly 5-to-1 margin; 47,276 for repeal, 10,500 against.
* 23 — Voters in the U.S. city of Eugene, Oregon, repeal an ordinance banning discrimination against gays and lesbians by a 2-to-1 margin.

===June===

* 24 — In Sydney, a gay and lesbian protest march is held on International Gay Solidarity Day to commemorate the Stonewall riots in the United States. Although the organizers of the march obtain permission, it is revoked on short notice and police break up the march. Fifty-three marchers are arrested, although charges are eventually dropped.
* 25 — The rainbow flag is first used as a symbol of gay pride. The original 8-striped version, designed by Gilbert Baker, first flies in the San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade.

===July===
* 1 — A gay protest rally is held in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, Canada, in response to a visit by Anita Bryant.
* 5 — The Quebec Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse (&quot;Human Rights and Youth Rights Commission&quot;) rules that a Montreal Catholic school board&#x27;s refusal to rent facilities to a gay group is discriminatory. This represents the first application of Quebec&#x27;s anti-sexual-orientation-discrimination law since it was passed in 1977.
* 27 — U.S. state of New Jersey repeals its anti-sodomy laws.

===September===
* 10 — A protest is held in London, Ontario, Canada, in response to a visit by Anita Bryant.

===November===
* 7
** California Proposition 6, the Briggs Initiative, which would have forbidden gays to teach in schools, is defeated in California by a two-to-one margin. U.S. president Jimmy Carter announced his opposition to this measure at a rally in the state, the first such mention by a U.S. president.
** The attempted repeal of a gay rights ordinance in Seattle, Washington, is also defeated by a two-to-one margin.
* 27 — Moscone–Milk assassinations occur in San Francisco. Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk are assassinated at San Francisco City Hall by former city supervisor Dan White. That night a candlelight march 30,000 people marched from Castro Street to City Hall in memory of the slain men.

==Deaths==

<text>The Boom is a Japanese rock band. Its members are Kazufumi Miyazawa (vocals), (guitar), Yamakawa Hiromasa (bass guitar), and Tochigi Takao (drums).

==History==
The four musicians, friends from Yamanashi Prefecture, formed the band in 1986 as a &quot;hokoten&quot; street band in Tokyo. They soon began getting club gigs and a record deal with Sony, with whom they released their first album, &quot;A Peacetime Boom&quot;, in 1989.

Vocalist Kazufumi Miyazawa who is the composer and lyricist for The Boom was inspired by the music of Okinawa. A single CD &quot;Shima Uta&quot; was released in 1993 with high sales, which reached approximately 1.5 million and brought fame to the band, around the world as well as at home. On December 31, 1993, The Boom participated in &quot;Kōhaku Uta Gassen&quot;, an exclusive show usually reserved for elite musicians.

After they released &quot;Shima-uta,&quot; the group went on to perform &quot;Kaze-ni Naritai,&quot; &quot;Kaero-kana,&quot; and &quot;Tsukisaemo-nemuruyoru,&quot; but Miyazawa wanted to write more Okinawa songs, so an album composed purely of Okinawa songs was released.

Miyazawa released several solo albums and composed songs for other musicians, including Akiko Yano, Kyōko Koizumi, and Rimi Natsukawa. He also started a new band named Ganga Zumba who released their first album &quot;Um&quot; in April 2007.

<doc id="492165" wikidata="Q495992" url="?curid=492165" title="Le Cordon Bleu">
<text>Le Cordon Bleu (; French: &quot;The Blue Ribbon&quot;; LCB) is a French hospitality and culinary education institution, teaching haute cuisine. Its educational focuses are hospitality management, culinary arts, and gastronomy. The institution consists of 35 institutes in 20 countries and has over 20,000 attendees.

== History ==
The origin of the school name derives, indirectly, from the French Royal and Catholic Order of the Holy Spirit. This was a select group of the French nobility that had been knighted. The first creation of Royal Knights at the French Court was performed in 1578. The French Order of the Holy Spirit was for many centuries the highest distinction of the French Kingdom. Each member was awarded the Cross of the Holy Spirit, which hung from a blue silk ribbon. According to one story, this group became known for its extravagant and luxurious banquets, known as &quot;cordons bleus&quot;. At the time, of the French Revolution, the monarchy and the Order were abolished, but the name remained synonymous with excellent French cooking. By the nineteenth century the blue ribbon had become synonymous with excellence. The name was adopted by a French culinary magazine, &quot;La Cuisinière Cordon Bleu&quot;, founded by Marthe Distel in the late 19th century. The magazine began offering lessons by some of the best chefs in France.

The magazine developed into the original &quot;Le Cordon Bleu&quot; that Distel and Henri-Paul Pellaprat established in 1895 in Paris, France. In 1945, after the end of WWII, Madame Elisabeth Brassart purchased what remained of the struggling school from a Catholic orphanage which had inherited it after Distel died in the late 1930s. Brassart managed the school until 1984; at the age of 87 she retired and sold the school to André J. Cointreau, a direct descendant of the founding family of Cointreau liqueur and Rémy Martin Cognac.

==Other countries==
In 1933, former student Dione Lucas helped to open a school under the Le Cordon Bleu name in London, Great Britain.

In the United States, 16 schools used to operate under the &quot;Le Cordon Bleu North America&quot; name through a licensing agreement with Career Education Corporation (CEC), a for-profit education company based in Chicago, Illinois. In 2009, the license was estimated to be worth $135 million. In 2014, Le Cordon Bleu North America generated $178.6 million in revenue and $70.6 million of operating losses. However, in light of the gainful employment rules implemented by the US Department of Education in 2015, CEC made the decision to sell the 16 campuses. When CEC failed to find a buyer it announced on 16 December 2015 that all 16 campuses in the United States would close by September 2017, giving enrolled students time to finish their programs.
The last new students were accepted in January 2016. In June 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission requested documents and information regarding Career Education&#x27;s fourth quarter 2014 classification of its Le Cordon Bleu campuses.

Le Cordon Bleu has continued to maintain a presence in the United States through its New York office, Le Cordon Bleu Inc., which places students in the locations abroad.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;Le Cordon Bleu&quot; played in central role in the 2009 American film &quot;Julie &amp; Julia&quot;, which was partly based on Julia Child&#x27;s memoir &quot;My Life in France&quot;. In addition, central protagonists in other films attended or were graduates of &quot;Le Cordon Bleu&quot; such as Audrey Hepburn&#x27;s character in the 1954 American film &quot;Sabrina&quot;, Huo Ting En in the 2017 Taiwanese television series &quot;The Perfect Match&quot;, Dev D in the 2017 Bengali film &quot;Maacher Jhol&quot; and Hervé Villechaize&#x27;s character Nick Nack in the 1974 James Bond film &quot;The Man with the Golden Gun&quot;.

The school also plays a central role in publications by its students. For example, American writer Kathleen Flinn&#x27;s 2007 book &quot;The Sharper Your Knife, the Less You Cry&quot;, is the first insider&#x27;s account of attending the modern Paris flagship school. Flinn&#x27;s best-selling memoir recounts the day-to-day trials of the contemporary program and provides a further history of the school. The book was translated into several languages.

==Alumni==

<text>ICE Futures U.S.—known as the New York Board of Trade (NYBOT) until September, 2007— is a physical commodity futures exchange located in New York City. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). 

==History==

It originated in 1870 as the New York Cotton Exchange (NYCE). In 1998, the New York Board of Trade became the parent company of the New York Cotton Exchange and the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange (CSCE). Both now function as divisions of NYBOT. NYBOT agreed to become a unit of ICE in September 2006.

The New York Board of Trade was a private company founded by Tom Green and Alfredo Williams. The floor of the NYBOT is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, an independent agency of the United States government.

On February 26, 2003, NYBOT signed a historic lease agreement with the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) to move into its World Financial Center headquarters and trading facility after the NYBOT&#x27;s original headquarters and trading floor was destroyed in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. NYBOT currently pays about $5 million per year in rent for the leased facility. The New York Board of Trade was able to operate out of its emergency Queens backup facility built after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing to keep the exchange running.

The New York Board of Trade was featured in the 1983 movie &quot;Trading Places.&quot; The trading floor scene at the end of the movie was set at the previous trading floor of the New York Board of Trade at 4 World Trade Center.

The official address of the New York Board of Trade headquarters and trading facility, located in the New York Mercantile Exchange Building, is &quot;One North End Avenue, New York, NY 10282-1101&quot;.

== Commodities traded on the exchange ==
One of the most innovative concepts pioneered at the exchange is the ability given to seat holders to trade seats that they do not actually own. Seatholders may sell short seats they do not have title to as well as purchase seats they have intention of holding as an investment.

<text>The New Zealand Census of Population and Dwellings () is a quinquennial national population and housing census conducted by Statistics New Zealand, a government department, every five years. There have been 34 censuses since 1851. In addition to providing detailed information about national demographics, the results of the census play an important part in the calculation of resource allocation to local service providers.

The 2023 census held on 7 March 2023 was the most recent, with the results being released from 29 May 2024 to August 2025.

==Census date==
Since 1926, the census has always been held on a Tuesday and since 1966, the census always occurs in March. These are statistically the month and weekday on which New Zealanders are least likely to be travelling. The census forms have to be returned by midnight on census day for them to be valid.

==Conducting the census==
Until 2018, census forms were hand-delivered by census workers during the lead-in to the census, with one form per person and a special form with questions about the dwelling. In addition, teams of census workers attempt to cover all hospitals, camp grounds, workplaces and transport systems where people might be found at midnight.

In 2018, the process was different. The majority of households received an access code in the post and were encouraged to complete their census online. If preferred, households could request paper census forms.

The 2023 census could be completed online or on paper forms. Forms with an access code were mailed out to householders from 20 February, but paper forms could be requested online or by telephone (free call 0800 CENSUS (0800 236–787)).

The smallest geographic unit used in the census for population data is the mesh block. There are 53,589 mesh blocks, with an average of 88 people in each.

==Data collected==

The 2018 census collected data on the following topics:

;Population structure:
;Location:
;Culture and Identity:
;Education and training:
;Work:
;Income:
;Families and households:
;Housing:
;Transport:
;Health and disability:


==History==
The first full census in New Zealand was conducted in 1851, and the census was triennial until 1881, at which time it became five-yearly. The 1931 census was cancelled due to the effects of the Great Depression, as was the 1941 census due to World War II. The 1946 census was brought forward to Tuesday 25 September 1945, so that the results could be used for an electoral redistribution (the first for ten years) before the .

1951 was the first year in which Māori and European New Zealanders were treated equally, with European New Zealanders having had a different census form in previous years and separate censuses in the nineteenth century. Results for those censuses before 1966 have been destroyed with a few exceptions and those since will not be available before 2066.

The 2006 census was held on Tuesday, 7 March. For the first time, respondents had the option of completing their census form online rather than by a printed form.

The 2011 census was scheduled for Tuesday, 8 March. However, due to the Christchurch earthquake on 22 February 2011, it was cancelled. For the first time ever, all 2011 census forms would have been digitally archived. On 27 May 2011 Statistics New Zealand announced that a census would take place in March 2013. The legislation required to change the census date was introduced to Parliament in August 2011.

The 2013 census was held on Tuesday 5 March 2013 and the 2018 census was held on Tuesday 6 March 2018. The 2018 census faced wide criticism for low response rates, a poor rollout of the online component of the census and delays. This resulted in an independent review of the census process, and the resignation of the then-Chief Executive of Statistics New Zealand Liz MacPherson.

The 2023 census was held on Tuesday, 7 March (despite Statistics New Zealand initially not ruling out a delay due to the effects of Cyclone Gabrielle), and it implemented measures that aimed to increase the census&#x27; effectiveness in response to the issues faced with the 2018 census, including supporting Māori to complete the census. It also included new questions on topics such as gender, sexual identity, and disabilities/health conditions.

==Evasion of the census==
A few people object to the census and attempt to evade it. As early as 1859, a resident was prosecuted for not completing his census form. The most famous of these census evaders is The Wizard of New Zealand, Ian Brackenbury Channell, who has avoided the census on numerous occasions. He spent the night of the 1981 census in a boat beyond New Zealand&#x27;s territorial limit in order to avoid enumeration in the country. He has also publicly burnt census forms.

Following the 2006 census, Statistics New Zealand prosecuted 72 people for failing to return their forms, with 41 convictions. After the 2013 census, they wrote to 450 people in July 2013 who had failed to return the forms, of whom 99 were prosecuted, resulting in 46 convictions. Most of those convicted faced two charges and were fined $50 to $500 per charge.

== Controversy ==
In June 2024, allegations surfaced that workers and volunteers at Manuwera Marae had collected citizens&#x27; private information from 2023 census forms, creating a database to target Māori voters in the general election held later in 2023. Takutai Moana Kemp was the chief executive of the marae at the time and was also a candidate for Te Pāti Māori, later narrowly winning a seat at the 2023 general election.

==Results==
Results of the 2013 census were released over an 18-month period, beginning 15 October 2013. It recorded 4,242,048 people who were resident in New Zealand on 5 March 2013. This represents an increase of 214,101 people (5.3 percent) since the 2006 census.

Results from the 2018 census were released to the public on 23 September 2019. The population of New Zealand was counted as 4,699,755 – an increase of 457,707 (10.79%) over the 2013 census.

On 30 June 2023, the field collection phase of the 2023 census ended with an estimated 89–91% of the New Zealand population having participated. Results of the 2023 census will be released from May 2024 to August 2025, starting on 29 May 2024.

<text>Video4Linux (V4L for short) is a collection of device drivers and an API for supporting realtime video capture on Linux systems. It supports USB webcams, TV tuners, CSI cameras, and related devices, standardizing their output, so programmers can easily add video support to their applications.

Video4Linux is responsible for creating V4L2 device nodes aka a device file (/dev/videoX, /dev/vbiX and /dev/radioX) and tracking data from these nodes. The device node creation is handled by V4L device drivers using the video_device struct (v4l2-dev.h) and it can either be allocated dynamically or embedded in another larger struct.

Video4Linux was named after Video for Windows (which is sometimes abbreviated &quot;V4W&quot;), but is not technically related to it.

While Video4Linux is only available on Linux, there is a compatibility layer available for FreeBSD called Video4BSD. This provides a way for many programs that depend on V4L to also compile and run on the FreeBSD operating system.

== History ==
V4L had been introduced late into the 2.1.X development cycle of the Linux kernel. Retroactively being renamed to V4L1, it was dropped in kernel 2.6.38.

V4L2 is the second version of V4L. Video4Linux2 fixed some design bugs and started appearing in the 2.5.x kernels. Video4Linux2 drivers include a compatibility mode for Video4Linux1 applications, though the support can be incomplete and it is recommended to use Video4Linux1 devices in V4L2 mode. The project DVB-Wiki is now hosted on LinuxTV web site.

Some programs support V4L2 through the media resource locator codice_1.

<doc id="492176" wikidata="Q4251234" url="?curid=492176" title="Oshikura Manju">
<text>is a simple Japanese singing game that is played on cold days in order to get warm.

The game is played with at least three players, but it is better if there are more. The players first gather around in a circle, as close to each other as possible. They face the outside, standing back to back with each other. When the game starts, the players powerfully shove backwards, pressing their backs towards other players&#x27; backs as they chant &quot;Oshikura Manju osarete nakuna&quot;, meaning &quot;Oshikura Manju don&#x27;t cry when shoved&quot;. The chant is the most famous part of the song, and many people are familiar with only this part. However, the proper song continues; &quot;Nakuko wa dare yowamushi kemushi hasannde sutero&quot; (&quot;Who is crying? Pinch the coward and caterpillar, and throw them away&quot;). The players continue shoving each other, repeating this song over and over. There is no accurate end to this game.

One variation to the game is to play in a circle drawn on the ground. The game goes on with whoever pushed out of that circle getting out of the group, ending when one player left in the circle.

The word &quot;Oshikura&quot; in the name of this game is thought to have the meaning of &quot;oshikurabe&quot; (shoving competition), but originally, it was not a competitive game, but an easygoing one where players become absorbed in shoving each other vigorously, which results in them being warmed up.

<text>Sizing or size is a substance that is applied to, or incorporated into, other materials—especially papers and textiles—to act as a protective filler or glaze. Sizing is used in papermaking and textile manufacturing to change the absorption and wear characteristics of those materials.

Sizing is used for oil-based surface preparation for gilding (sometimes called &quot;mordant&quot; in this context). It is used by painters and artists to prepare paper and textile surfaces for some art techniques. Sizing is used in photography to increase the sharpness of a print, to change the glossiness of a print, or for other purposes depending on the type of paper and printing technique.

Fibers used in composite materials are treated with various sizing agents to promote adhesion with the matrix material.

Sizing is used during paper manufacture to reduce the paper&#x27;s tendency when dry to absorb liquid, with the goal of allowing inks and paints to remain on the surface of the paper and to dry there, rather than be absorbed into the paper. This provides a more consistent, economical, and precise printing, painting, and writing surface. This is achieved by curbing the paper fibers&#x27; tendency to absorb liquids by capillary action. In addition, sizing affects abrasiveness, creasability, finish, printability, smoothness, and surface bond strength and decreases surface porosity and fuzzing.

There are three categories of papers with respect to sizing: &quot;unsized&quot; (&quot;water-leaf&quot;), &quot;weak sized&quot; (&quot;slack sized&quot;), and &quot;strong sized&quot; (&quot;hard sized&quot;). Waterleaf has low water resistance and includes absorbent papers for blotting. Slack sized paper is somewhat absorbent and includes newsprint, while hard sized papers have the highest water resistance, such as coated fine papers and liquid packaging board.

There are two types of sizing: &quot;internal sizing,&quot; sometimes also called engine sizing, and &quot;surface sizing&quot; (tub sizing). Internal sizing is applied to almost all papers and especially to all those that are machine made, while surface sizing is added for the highest grade bond, ledger, and writing papers.

== Surface sizing ==
Surface sizing solutions consist of mainly modified starches and sometimes other hydrocolloids, such as gelatine, or surface sizing agents such as acrylic co-polymers. Surface sizing agents are amphiphilic molecules, having both hydrophilic (water-loving) and hydrophobic (water-repelling) ends. The sizing agent adheres to substrate fibers and forms a film, with the hydrophilic tail facing the fiber and the hydrophobic tail facing outwards, resulting in a smooth finish that tends to be water-repellent. Sizing improves the surface strength, printability, and water resistance of the paper or material to which it is applied. In the sizing solution, optical brightening agents (OBA) may also be added to improve the opacity and whiteness of the paper or material surface.

== Internal sizing ==

Usual internal sizing chemicals used in papermaking at the wet end are alkyl ketene dimer (AKD) and alkyl succinic anhydride (ASA) in neutral pH conditions, and the more ancient rosin system which requires acidic conditions and is still used in some mills.

== Preservation ==
While sizing is intended to make paper more suitable for printing, acidic sizing using rosin also makes printing paper less durable and poses a problem for preservation of printed documents. 

Sizing with starch was introduced quite early in the history of papermaking. Dard Hunter in &quot;Papermaking through Eighteen Centuries&quot; corroborates this by writing, &quot;The Chinese used starch as a size for paper as early as A.D. 768 and its use continued until the fourteenth century when animal glue was substituted.&quot; In the early modern paper mills in Europe, which produced paper for printing and other uses, the sizing agent of choice was gelatin, as Susan Swartzburg writes in &quot;Preserving Library Materials&quot;&#x27;: &quot;Various substances have been used for sizing through the ages, from gypsum to animal gelatin.&quot; Hunter describes the process of sizing in these paper mills in the following:

With the advent of the mass production of paper, the type of size used for paper production also changed. As Swartzburg writes, &quot;By 1850 rosin size had come into use. Unfortunately, it produces a chemical action that hastens the decomposition of even the finest papers.&quot; In the field of library preservation it is known &quot;that acid hydrolysis of cellulose and related carbo-hydrates [sic] is one of the key factors responsible for the degradation of paper during ageing.&quot; Some professional work has focused on the specific processes involved in the degradation of rosin-sized paper, in addition to work on developing permanent paper and sizing agents that will not eventually destroy the paper. An issue on the periphery to the preservation of paper and sizing, is washing, which is described by V. Daniels and J. Kosek as, &quot;The removal of discolouration ... in water is principally effected by the dissolution of water-soluble material; this is usually done by immersing paper in water.&quot; In such a process, surface level items applied to the paper, such as size in early paper making processes as seen above, have the possibility of being removed from the paper, which might have some item specific interest in a special collections library. With later processes in paper making being more akin to &quot;engine sizing,&quot; as H. Hardman and E. J. Cole describe it, &quot;Engine sizing, which is part of the manufacturing process, has the ingredients added to the furnish or stock prior to sheet formation,&quot; the concern for the removal of size is less, and as such, most literature focuses on the more pressing issue of preserving acidic papers and similar issues.

== Gilding ==
Sizing is a term used for any substance which is applied to a surface before gilding in order to ensure adhesion of the thin gold layer to the substrate. Egg whites have often been used as sizing; the Ancient Egyptians sometimes used blood. Other commonly used traditional materials for gold leaf sizing are rabbit-skin glue diluted and heated in water (water gilding), and boiled linseed oil (oil gilding); modern materials include polyvinyl acetate.

== Textile warp sizing ==

Textile warp sizing, also known as tape sizing, of warp yarn is essential to reduce breakage of the yarn and thus production stops on the weaving machine. On the weaving machine, the warp yarns are subjected to several types of actions i.e. cyclic strain, flexing, abrasion at various loom parts, and inter yarn friction.

With sizing, the strength—abrasion resistance—of the yarn will improve and the hairiness of yarn will decrease. The degree of improvement of strength depends on adhesion force between fiber and size, size penetration, as well as encapsulation of yarn. Different types of water soluble polymers called textile sizing agents/chemicals such as modified starch, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), and acrylates are used to protect the yarn. Also wax is added to reduce the abrasiveness of the warp yarns. The type of yarn material (e.g. cotton, polyester, linen), the thickness of the yarn, and the type of weaving machinery will determine the sizing recipe.

Often, the sizing liquor contain mutton tallow. Mutton tallow is an animal fat, used to improve abrasion resistance of yarns during weaving.

The sizing liquor is applied on warp yarn with a warp sizing machine. After the weaving process, the fabric is desized (washed).

Sizing may be done by hand, or in a sizing machine.

== Canvas sizing for oil painting ==
Preparation of canvas for the oil painting always includes sizing: the canvas will &quot;rot&quot; if directly exposed to the paint. Aqueous glue, frequently the hide glue was used for sizing the canvas for centuries, Size in art is not a replacement for ground: it is not intended to form a level surface for painting, it is used to simply fill pores and isolate the canvas from the actual ground.

It is a large forest tree of the Eastern United States and Southern Ontario in Canada. It is a tree that tends to occur singly as scattered specimens, rather than in groves.

The cucumber tree is native primarily within the Appalachian belt, including the Allegheny Plateau and Cumberland Plateau, up to western Pennsylvania and New York. There are also numerous disconnected outlying populations through much of the southeastern U.S., and a few small populations in Southern Ontario. In Canada, the cucumber tree is listed as an endangered species and is protected under the Canadian Species at Risk Act. In 1993 The North American Native Plant Society purchased Shining Tree Woods to preserve a stand of &quot;Magnolia acuminata,&quot; which is also known as &quot;The Shining Tree&quot;.

The leaves are deciduous, simple and alternate, oval to oblong, long and wide, with smooth margins and downy on the underside. They come in two forms, acuminate at both ends, or moderately cordate at the base (these are usually only formed high in the tree).

Unlike most magnolias, the flowers are not showy. They are typically small, yellow-green, and borne high in the tree in April through June. The leaves of &quot;Magnolia acuminata&quot; are pointed at the tip and provide it with its name - &#x27;acuminate&#x27; means tapering to a fine point. The name &quot;cucumber tree&quot; refers to the unripe fruit, which is green and often shaped like a small cucumber; the fruit matures to a dark red color and is long and broad, with the individual carpels splitting open to release the bright red seeds, 10–60 per fruit. The ripe fruit is a striking reddish orange color.

==Uses and cultivation==
Cucumber trees are excellent shade trees for parks and gardens, though they are not recommended for use as street trees. In cultivation, they typically only grow tall, although they reach over in ideal forest situations. They can become quite massive: the United States national (and presumed world) champion in Stark County, Ohio measures eight feet (2.4 m) in diameter and tall. They grow best in deep, moist, well-drained soils that are slightly acidic although they are tolerant of alkaline soils.

They are tricky to transplant due to their coarse, fleshy root system and should be planted shallow and moved in early spring with a good soil ball.

In the timber trade, the wood of this tree is interchangeable with that of the related tuliptree (&quot;Liriodendron tulipifera&quot;).

&quot;Magnolia acuminata&quot; has been used in hybridizing new varieties that share its yellow flower color and cold hardiness.

It additionally has been marked as a pollinator plant, supporting and attracting bees and butterflies. It is a host plant for butterflies, providing food during their larval stage.

<doc id="492179" wikidata="Q448481" url="?curid=492179" title="Max Baer (boxer)">
<text>Maximilian Adelbert Baer Sr. (February 11, 1909 – November 21, 1959) was an American professional boxer and the world heavyweight champion from June 14, 1934, to June 13, 1935. He was known in his time as the Livermore Larupper and Madcap Maxie. Two of his fights (a 1933 win over Max Schmeling and a 1935 loss to James J. Braddock) were rated Fight of the Year by &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine. Baer was also a boxing referee, and had occasional roles in film and television. He was the brother of heavyweight boxing contender Buddy Baer and father of actor Max Baer Jr. Baer is rated #22 on &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of 100 greatest punchers of all time.

==Early life==
Baer was born on February 11, 1909, in Omaha, Nebraska, to Jacob Baer (1875–1938) and Dora Bales (1877–1938). His father was the son of Jewish immigrants from Alsace-Lorraine and his mother was of Scottish descent. His elder sister was Frances May Baer (1905–1991), his younger sister was Bernice Jeanette Baer (1911–1987), his younger brother was boxer-turned-actor Jacob Henry Baer, better known as Buddy Baer (1915–1986), and his adopted brother was August &quot;Augie&quot; Baer. For a while Jacob Baer worked for the Graden Mercantile Company as the manager of their meat-packing plant in Durango, Colorado.

===Move to California===
In May 1922, tired of the winters that aggravated Frances&#x27; rheumatic fever and Jacob&#x27;s high blood pressure, the Baers drove to the milder climate on the West Coast, where Dora&#x27;s sister lived in Alameda, California. Jacob&#x27;s expertise in the meat business led to numerous job offers in the San Francisco Bay Area. While living in Hayward, Max took his first job as a delivery boy for John Lee Wilbur, who ran a grocery store and bought meat from Jacob.

The Baers lived in the Northern Californian towns of Hayward, San Leandro and Galt before moving to Livermore in 1926. Livermore was ranch and cowboy country, surrounded by tens of thousands of acres of open land on which large cattle herds grazed and provided fresh meat to the local area. In 1928, Jacob leased the Twin Oaks Ranch in Murray Township, where he raised more than 2,000 hogs and worked with daughter Frances&#x27; husband, Louis Santucci. Baer often credited his work carrying heavy carcasses of meat, stunning cattle with one blow, and working at a gravel pit for the development of his powerful shoulders (an article in the January 1939 edition of &quot;Family Circle&quot; reported that Baer also took the Charles Atlas exercise course.)

==Professional boxing career==
Baer turned professional in 1929, progressing steadily through the Pacific Coast ranks. A ring tragedy little more than a year later almost caused Baer to drop out of boxing for good.

===Frankie Campbell===
Baer fought Frankie Campbell on August 25, 1930, in San Francisco in a ring built over home plate at San Francisco&#x27;s Recreation Park for the unofficial title of Pacific Coast champion. In the second round, Campbell clipped Baer and Baer slipped to the canvas. Campbell went toward his corner and waved to the crowd, thinking that Baer was getting the count. In response, Baer got up and flew at Campbell, landing a right to Campbell&#x27;s turned head which sent him to the canvas.

After the round, Campbell said to his trainer &quot;Something feels like it snapped in my head&quot;, but he went on to handily win rounds 3 and 4. As Baer rose for the 5th round, Tillie &quot;Kid&quot; Herman, Baer&#x27;s former friend and trainer, who had switched camps overnight and was now in Campbell&#x27;s corner, savagely taunted and jeered Baer. In a rage and determined to end the bout with a knockout, Baer soon had Campbell against the ropes. As he hammered him with punch after punch, the ropes were the only thing holding Campbell up. By the time referee Toby Irwin stopped the fight, Campbell collapsed to the canvas. Baer&#x27;s own seconds reportedly ministered to Campbell, and Baer stayed by his side until an ambulance arrived 30 minutes later. Baer &quot;visited the stricken fighter&#x27;s bedside&quot;, where he offered Frankie&#x27;s wife Ellie the hand that hit her husband. She took that hand and the two stood speechless for a moment. &quot;It was unfortunate, I&#x27;m awfully sorry&quot;, said Baer. &quot;It could have been you,&quot; she replied. She forgave him.

At noon the next day, with a lit candle laced between his crossed fingers, and his wife and mother beside him, Frankie Campbell was pronounced dead. Upon the surgeon&#x27;s announcement of Campbell&#x27;s death, Baer broke down and sobbed inconsolably. Brain specialist Dr. Tilton E. Tillman &quot;declared death had been caused by a succession of blows on the jaw and by any struck on the rear of the head&quot; and that Campbell&#x27;s brain had been &quot;knocked completely loose from his skull&quot; by Baer&#x27;s blows.

===Ernie Schaaf===
The Campbell incident earned Baer the reputation as a &quot;killer&quot; in the ring. This publicity was further sensationalized by Baer&#x27;s return bout with Ernie Schaaf, on August 31, 1932. Schaaf had bested Baer in a decision during Max&#x27;s Eastern debut bout at Madison Square Garden on September 19, 1930.

An Associated Press article in the September 9, 1932, sports section of the &quot;New York Times&quot; describes the end of the return bout as follows:Two seconds before the fight ended Schaaf was knocked flat on his face, completely knocked out. He was dragged to his corner and his seconds worked on him for three minutes before restoring him to his senses... Baer smashed a heavy right to the jaw that shook Schaaf to his heels, to start the last round, then walked into the Boston fighter, throwing both hands to the head and body. Baer drove three hard rights to the jaw that staggered Schaaf. Baer beat Schaaf around the ring and into the ropes with a savage attack to the head and body. Just before the round ended Baer dropped Schaaf to the canvas, but the bell sounded as Schaaf hit the floor. Schaaf complained frequently of headaches after that bout. Five months after the Baer fight, on February 11, 1933, Schaaf died in the ring after taking a left jab from the Italian fighter Primo Carnera. The majority of sports editors noted, however, that an autopsy later revealed Schaaf had meningitis, a swelling of the brain, and was still recovering from a severe case of influenza when he touched gloves with Carnera. Schaaf&#x27;s obituary stated that &quot;just before his bout with Carnera, Schaaf went into reclusion in a religious retreat near Boston to recuperate from an attack of influenza&quot; which produced the meningitis.

The death of Campbell and accusations over Schaaf&#x27;s demise profoundly affected Baer, even though he was ostensibly indestructible and remained a devastating force in the ring. According to his son, actor/director Max Baer Jr. (who was born seven years after the incident):My father cried about what happened to Frankie Campbell. He had nightmares. In reality, my father was one of the kindest, gentlest men you would ever hope to meet. He treated boxing the way today&#x27;s professional wrestlers do wrestling: part sport, mostly showmanship. He never deliberately hurt anyone.

In the case of Campbell, Baer was charged with manslaughter. Baer was eventually acquitted of all charges, but the California State Boxing Commission still banned him from any in-ring activity within the state for the next year. Baer gave purses from succeeding bouts to Campbell&#x27;s family, but lost four of his next six fights. He fared better when Jack Dempsey took him under his wing. 

===Max Schmeling===

On June 8, 1933, Baer fought and defeated German heavyweight and former world champion Max Schmeling at Yankee Stadium, by technical knockout. Schmeling was favored to win and was Adolf Hitler&#x27;s favorite boxer. The Nazi tabloid &quot;Der Stürmer&quot; publicly attacked Schmeling for fighting a non-Aryan, as Baer&#x27;s father was Jewish, calling it a &quot;racial and cultural disgrace.&quot;

Although the Great Depression, then in full force, had lowered the income of most citizens, sixty thousand people attended the boxing match. NBC radio updated millions nationwide as the match progressed. Baer, who was of half Jewish descent, wore trunks which displayed the Star of David, a symbol he wore in all his future bouts. During the match, he dominated the rugged Schmeling into the tenth round, when Baer knocked Schmeling down and the referee stopped the match. Columnist Westbrook Pegler wrote about Schmeling&#x27;s loss, &quot;That wasn&#x27;t a defeat, that was a disaster&quot;, while journalist David Margolick claimed that Baer&#x27;s victory would come to &quot;symbolize Jewry&#x27;s struggle against the Nazis.&quot; Baer became a hero among Jews and those who despised the Nazis.

Film star Greta Garbo considered Baer&#x27;s defeat of Schmeling to be a &quot;mini victory&quot; over Nazism, and she invited Baer to visit her while she was filming &quot;Queen Christina&quot; in Hollywood. However, Baer&#x27;s presence on the set was considered a &quot;sacrilege&quot; in Hollywood, as even MGM studio&#x27;s head, Louis B. Mayer, wasn&#x27;t allowed on Garbo&#x27;s set, since she demanded total privacy while acting. Their friendship led to a romance, which lasted until he returned to New York to train for his next match against Primo Carnera.

===World Heavyweight Champion===
On June 14, 1934, at the outdoor Madison Square Garden Bowl at Long Island City, New York, Baer defeated the huge reigning world champion Primo Carnera of Italy, who weighed in at 267 pounds. Baer knocked down the champion 11 times before the fight was stopped in the eleventh round by referee Arthur Donovan to save Carnera from further punishment. All the knockdowns occurred in rounds one, two, ten and eleven, which Baer thoroughly dominated. The intervening rounds were competitive. There is some dispute about the number of knockdowns scored, as Carnera slipped to the canvas on several occasions and was wrestled to the canvas other times. Despite this dominant performance over Carnera, Baer would hold the world heavyweight title for just 364 days.

==== James J. Braddock ====
On June 13, 1935, one of the greatest upsets in boxing history occurred in Long Island City, New York, as Baer fought down-and-out boxer James J. Braddock in the so-called &quot;Cinderella Man&quot; bout. Baer hardly trained for the bout. Braddock, on the other hand, trained hard. &quot;I&#x27;m training for a fight, not a boxing contest or a clownin&#x27; contest or a dance,&quot; he said. &quot;Whether it goes one round or three rounds or ten rounds, it will be a fight and a fight all the way. When you&#x27;ve been through what I&#x27;ve had to face in the last two years, a Max Baer or a Bengal tiger looks like a house pet. He might come at me with a cannon and a blackjack and he would still be a picnic compared to what I&#x27;ve had to face.&quot; Baer, ever the showman, &quot;brought gales of laughter from the crowd with his antics&quot; the night he stepped between the ropes to meet Braddock. As Braddock &quot;slipped the blue bathrobe from his pink back, he was the sentimental favorite of a Bowl crowd of 30,000, most of whom had bet their money 8-to-1 against him.&quot;

Baer &quot;undoubtedly paid the penalty for underestimating his challenger beforehand and wasting too much time clowning.&quot; Braddock took heavy hits from Baer but kept coming at him until he wore Max down. At the end of 15 rounds Braddock emerged the victor in a unanimous decision, outpointing Baer 8 rounds to 6 in the &quot;most astounding upset since John L. Sullivan went down before the thrusts of Gentleman Jim Corbett back in the nineties.&quot;

The fight was featured in the 2005 film &quot;Cinderella Man&quot;. Baer was portrayed by Craig Bierko and Braddock was portrayed by Russell Crowe.

===Decline and retirement===
Baer and his brother Buddy both lost fights to Joe Louis. In the third round of Max&#x27;s September 1935 match, Louis knocked Baer down twice, the first time he had ever been knocked to the canvas in his career. A sizzling left hook in the fourth round brought Max to his knee again, and the referee called the bout soon after. It was learned weeks later that Baer fought Louis with a broken right hand that never healed from his fight with James J. Braddock. Max was virtually helpless without his big right hand in the Louis fight. In the first televised heavyweight prizefight, Baer lost to Lou Nova on June 1, 1939, on WNBT-TV in New York.

====White Heavyweight Champ====
Baer was awarded a belt declaring him the &quot;White Heavyweight Champion of the World&quot; after he scored a first-round TKO over Pat Cominsky in a bout at Roosevelt Stadium in Jersey City, New Jersey, on September 26, 1940, but it was a publicity stunt. The fight was not promoted as being for the white heavyweight championship, and Cominsky would not have won the belt had he beaten Baer.

The belt was a publicity stunt dreamed up by boxing promoters who were trying to pressure promoter Mike Jacobs into giving the ex-world heavyweight champion a rematch with current champ Joe Louis. Jacobs did not give Baer another bout with Louis. Baer retired after his next fight, on April 4, 1941, when he lost to Lou Nova on a TKO in the eighth round of a scheduled 10-rounder at Madison Square Garden. Nova did get a shot at Joe Louis, losing to the champion by TKO in the sixth round of a scheduled fifteen-round bout held at the Polo Grounds in New York.

===Career statistics===
Baer boxed in 84 professional fights from 1929 to 1941. In all, his record was 71–13. Fifty-three of those wins were knockouts, making him a member of the exclusive group of boxers to have won 50 or more bouts by knockout. Baer defeated the likes of Ernie Schaaf, Walter Cobb, Kingfish Levinsky, Max Schmeling, Tony Galento, Ben Foord and Tommy Farr. He was Heavyweight Champion of the World from June 14, 1934, to June 13, 1935.

Baer was a 1968 inductee into &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine&#x27;s Boxing Hall of Fame (disbanded in 1987) and was inducted to the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1995. He was inducted to the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 2009. The 1998 Holiday Issue of &quot;Ring&quot; ranked Baer #20 in &quot;The 50 Greatest Heavyweights of All Time&quot;. In &quot;Ring Magazine&#x27;s 100 Greatest Punchers&quot; (published in 2003), Baer is ranked number 22.

==Acting==

Baer&#x27;s motion picture debut was in &quot;The Prizefighter and the Lady&quot; (1933) opposite Myrna Loy and Walter Huston. In this MGM movie he played Steven &quot;Steve&quot; Morgan, a bartender that the Professor, played by Huston, begins training for the ring. Steve wins a fight, then marries Belle Mercer, played by Loy. He starts seriously training, but it turns out he has a huge ego and an eye for women. Featured were Baer&#x27;s upcoming opponent, Primo Carnera, as himself, whom Steve challenges for the championship, and Jack Dempsey, as himself, former heavyweight champion, acting as the referee.

On March 29, 1934, &quot;The Prizefighter and the Lady&quot; was officially banned in Germany at the behest of Joseph Goebbels, Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Minister of Propaganda and Public Entertainment, even though it received favorable reviews in local newspapers as well as in Nazi publications. When contacted for comment at Lake Tahoe, Baer said, &quot;They didn&#x27;t ban the picture because I have Jewish blood. They banned it because I knocked out Max Schmeling.&quot; Baer, along with his brother Buddy, enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Force when World War II began.

Baer acted in almost 20 movies, including &quot;Africa Screams&quot; (1949) with Abbott and Costello, and made several television guest appearances. A clown in and out of the ring, Baer also appeared in a vaudeville act and on his own TV variety show. Baer appeared in Humphrey Bogart&#x27;s final movie, &quot;The Harder They Fall&quot; (1956), opposite Mike Lane as Toro Moreno, a Hollywood version of Primo Carnera, whom Baer defeated for his heavyweight title. Budd Schulberg, who wrote the book on which the movie was based, portrayed the Baer character, &quot;Buddy Brannen&quot;, as bloodthirsty, and the unfounded characterization was reprised in the movie &quot;Cinderella Man&quot;.

In 1950, Baer teamed up with another titleholder, friend and Light Heavyweight champion (1929–34) and boxer-turned actor/comedian, Maxie Rosenbloom. Together, the two starred in four slapstick comedy shorts for Columbia Pictures (produced by the makers of the Three Stooges comedies) and one feature film, Skipalong Rosenbloom (written by Rosenbloom, uncredited). The team embarked on a comedy tour, billed as &quot;The Two Maxie&#x27;s&quot;. Baer would also take the stage at Rosenbloom&#x27;s comedy club on Wilshire Blvd, Slapsy Maxie&#x27;s, which was featured in the film Gangster Squad. Baer and Rosenbloom remained friends until Baer&#x27;s death in 1959.

Baer additionally worked as a disc jockey for a Sacramento radio station, and for a while he was a wrestler. He served as public relations director for a Sacramento automobile dealership and referee for boxing and wrestling matches.

==Family==
Baer was married twice, first to actress Dorothy Dunbar (married July 8, 1931 – divorced October 3, 1933) and then to Mary Ellen Sullivan (1903–1978) (married June 29, 1935 – his death 1959), the mother of his three children: actor Max Baer Jr. (b. 1937), best known for playing Jethro Bodine on &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies,&quot; James Manny Baer (1941–2009), and Maudie Marian Baer (b. 1944).

At the time of his death on November 21, 1959, Baer was scheduled to appear in some TV commercials in Los Angeles before returning to his home in Sacramento.

==Death==

On Wednesday, November 18, 1959, Baer refereed a nationally televised 10-round boxing match in Phoenix. At the end of the match, to the applause of the crowd, Baer grasped the ropes and vaulted out of the ring and joined fight fans in a cocktail bar. The next day, he was scheduled to appear in several television commercials in Hollywood, California. On his way, he stopped in Garden Grove, California, to keep a promise he had made thirteen years earlier to the then five-year-old son of his ex-sparring partner, Curly Owens. Baer presented the now 18-year-old with a foreign sports car on his birthday, as he had said he would.

Baer checked into the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel upon his arrival on November 19. Hotel employees said he looked fit but complained of a cold. As he was shaving on the morning of November 21, he experienced chest pains. He called the front desk and asked for a doctor. The desk clerk said that &quot;a house doctor would be right up.&quot; &quot;A house doctor?&quot; he replied jokingly, &quot;No, dummy, I need a people doctor&quot;.

A doctor gave Baer medicine, and a fire department rescue squad administered oxygen. His chest pains subsided and he was showing signs of recovery when he was stricken with a second heart attack. Just a moment before, he was joking with the doctor, declaring he had come through two similar but lighter attacks earlier in Sacramento, California. Then he slumped on his left side, turned blue and died within a matter of minutes. His last words reportedly were, &quot;Oh God, here I go.&quot;

==Funeral==
Baer&#x27;s funeral in Sacramento was attended by more than 1,500 mourners. Four former world boxing champions appeared and Joe Louis and Jack Dempsey were among the pallbearers. The cemetery service was concluded by an American Legion honor guard recognizing Baer&#x27;s service in World War II. Baer&#x27;s obituary made the front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. He was laid to rest in a garden crypt in St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic Cemetery in Sacramento.

==Legacy==
There is a park named for Baer in Livermore, California. There is also a park named for him in Sacramento. He was honored by the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame in 1988.

Baer was an active member of the Fraternal Order of Eagles. When Max died of a heart attack in 1959, the Eagles created a charity fund as a tribute to his memory and as a means of combating the disease that killed him. &quot;The Max Baer Heart Fund&quot; is
primarily to aid in heart research and education. Since the fund started in 1959, millions of dollars have been donated to universities, medical centers and hospitals across the United States and Canada for heart research and education.

<doc id="492180" wikidata="Q3372772" url="?curid=492180" title="John Taylor (American football)">
<text>John Gregory Taylor (born March 31, 1962) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver and kick returner with the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League (NFL). He attended Pennsauken High School and was one of six NFL players to come from PHS during the 1980s. Taylor attended Delaware State College and was a member of their football team, the Hornets. He was a member of the 49ers teams that won Super Bowls XXIII, XXIV, and XXIX. His younger brother is former safety Keith Taylor.

==College career==
Taylor unsuccessfully attempted to walk-on at Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte, North Carolina. He transferred to Delaware State the following year and was able to make the team. Taylor totaled 42 touchdowns (33 receiving) over the course of his career at Delaware State, including 15 (13 receiving) his senior season (in only 10 games—they only played 10 games/season during that time period), both conference records. He caught 10 touchdown passes in both his sophomore and junior seasons. He is tied with kicker David Parkinson for most career points (254) in the conference. His 223 receiving yards in one game is also a conference record, and he has the two longest receptions in conference history, 97 and 93 yards. His 24.3 yards/catch average was the NCAA record until Jerome Mathis eclipsed it recently with 26.4. One player has since slightly eclipsed his record in career receiving yardage (Albert Horsey with 2,491 to Taylor&#x27;s 2,426), but he remains the most dominant and famous player to ever come out of the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC). He was named MEAC Offensive Player of the Year in 1985 and All-MEAC first-team in 1984 and 1985.

==Professional career==
Taylor was selected by the San Francisco 49ers in the third round of the 1986 NFL draft with the 76th overall pick. This was ranked by ESPN as the 25th Greatest NFL Draft Steal of all time. Taylor played for the 49ers from 1987 to 1995 and was an exceptional counterpart to Hall of Fame teammate Jerry Rice during that time. He led the National Football League in punt return yards (556) in 1988, and he may be best known for catching the winning 10-yard touchdown pass from Joe Montana during the final seconds of Super Bowl XXIII in 1989. He also set Super Bowl records in the game for the most punt return yards (56) and highest punt return average (18.7 yards per return). Taylor also held the record for the longest punt return in Super Bowl history, with a 45-yard return in Super Bowl XXIII, until Denver Broncos&#x27; return specialist Jordan Norwood broke that record with a 61-yard return in Super Bowl 50.

By the conclusion of the 1988 season, which ended with his famous touchdown catch in the Super Bowl, Taylor had caught just 23 passes in his two years with the 49ers and was mainly used as punt and kick returner. But in the season after his Super Bowl-winning touchdown reception, Taylor established himself as one of the top receivers in the NFL. Despite not being the #1 receiver on his team, Taylor finished the 1989 season with 60 receptions for 1,077 yards and ten touchdowns (the fourth most touchdown receptions by a player in the NFL that year). In December 1989, on nationally televised Monday Night Football against the Los Angeles Rams, Taylor scored touchdowns on two receptions of over 90 yards (92 and 96), an NFL first.&lt;ref name=&quot;MNF_12/11/89&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He also set a record for most receiving yards in back-to-back games with a total of 448, a record he held until November 2006 when Chad Johnson of the Cincinnati Bengals broke it with 450 receiving yards. He reached the 1,000 receiving yard milestone again in the 1991 season with 64 receptions for 1,011 yards and nine touchdowns (ranking him seventh in the NFL). In his nine NFL seasons, Taylor recorded 347 receptions for 5,589 yards (an average of 16.1 yards per catch) and 43 touchdowns. He also gained 1,517 yards and two touchdowns returning punts, and added another 276 yards returning kickoffs. He was selected to play in the NFL Pro Bowl twice, in 1988 and 1989. He also won three Super Bowl rings in his career with the 49ers, in 1988, 1989, and 1994. His combined total of 94 punt return yards in those three games are the most by any player in Super Bowl history, and his average of 15.7 yards per return is also the highest.

==Life after football==
At one time, Taylor owned a trucking company but still drives a truck and leads a quiet life off the field. His only moments in any sort of spotlight come when he&#x27;s participating in celebrity golf events, such as ones sponsored by his Alma mater, Delaware State. In 2005, he was inducted into the Delaware Sports Museum and Hall of Fame. He also worked in San Jose juvenile detention, as a staff member in unit B-4.

==Hall of Fame nomination==

Taylor was a nominee for the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2018, but did not make it to the list of finalists.

<text>Caroline Chisholm (born Caroline Jones; 30 May 1808 – 25 March 1877) was an English humanitarian known mostly for her support of immigrant female and family welfare in Australia. She is commemorated on 16 May in the calendar of saints of the Church of England. Her path to sainthood within the Catholic Church has commenced; she had converted to Catholicism around the time of her marriage and reared her children as Catholic.

==Early life==
Caroline Jones was born in 1808 in Northampton, England, the youngest of at least twelve children of her father, and the last of seven born to her mother. Her father, William Jones, had been widowed three times and Caroline was a daughter of William&#x27;s fourth wife, Sarah. The family lived at 11 Mayorhold, Northampton. William Jones, who was born in Wootton, Northamptonshire, was a pig dealer who fattened young pigs for sale. He died in 1814 when Caroline was six. He left his wife £500 and bequeathed several properties to his twelve surviving children.

On 27 December 1830, Caroline, then 22, married Archibald Chisholm who was ten years her senior. He was an officer serving with the East India Company&#x27;s Madras Army and a Roman Catholic. Around this time, Caroline converted to his faith, and they raised their children as Catholics. They were married at The Holy Sepulchre, Northampton, a Church of England church. Weddings conducted by Roman Catholic clergy were not recognised weddings until the Marriage Act 1836.

==Madras, India==
Chisholm&#x27;s husband returned to his regiment in Madras in January 1832. She joined him there 18 months later. Chisholm became aware that young girls growing up with their families in the barracks were picking up the bad behaviour of the soldiers. In 1834 she founded the Female School of Industry for the Daughters of European Soldiers, which provided a practical education for such girls. They were instructed in reading, writing and religion, cooking, housekeeping, and nursing. Soon soldiers asked if their wives could also attend the school.

While living in India, Chisholm gave birth to two sons, Archibald and William. The family followed her husband on his assignments around the Indian subcontinent.

==Sydney==
In 1838, Captain Archibald Chisholm was granted a two-year furlough on the grounds of ill health. Rather than return to England, the family decided the climate in Australia would be better for his health so they set sail for Sydney, aboard the &quot;Emerald Isle&quot;, arriving there in October 1838. The family settled at nearby Windsor.

On trips to Sydney, Chisholm and her husband became aware of the difficult conditions that faced immigrants arriving in the colony. They were particularly concerned for the young women who were arriving without any money, friends, family, or jobs to go to. Many turned to prostitution to survive. Chisholm found placement for these young women in shelters, such as her own, and helped find them permanent places to stay. She started an organisation with the help of the governess for an immigrant women&#x27;s shelter. In 1840, Captain Chisholm returned to his regiment in India, but he encouraged his wife to continue her philanthropic efforts. She set up the first home in Sydney for young women and organised other homes in several rural centres. The home was soon extended to help immigrant families and young men.
In March 1842, Chisholm rented two terraced dwellings in East Maitland. She converted them into a single cottage to be used as a hostel for homeless immigrants who had travelled to the Hunter Valley in search of work. Now called Caroline Chisholm Cottage, it is the only building in New South Wales so directly associated with Chisholm. Built in the 1830s, the cottage offers a rare example of early working-class housing in New South Wales.

During the seven years when Chisholm was in Australia, she placed over 11,000 people in homes and jobs. She became a well-known woman and much admired. She was requested to give evidence before two Legislative Council committees. Chisholm carried out her work in New South Wales without accepting money from individuals or individual organisations, as she wanted to act independently. She did not want to be dependent upon any religious or political body. The girls and families whom Chisholm helped came from different backgrounds and held different religious beliefs. She raised money for the homes through private subscriptions. Her husband was invalided out of the Army and returned to Australia in 1845.

==Migration reforms and the Family Colonisation Loan Society==
Before Chisholm and her husband returned to England in 1846, they toured New South Wales at their own expense, collecting over 600 statements from immigrants who had already settled there. Chisholm believed the only way to encourage emigration from England to Australia was for prospective emigrants to read letters from pioneers already living in the colony. In England, the couple published some of those statements in a pamphlet titled &quot;Comfort for the Poor – Meat Three Times a Day&quot;. The writer Charles Dickens used some of the statements in his new magazine &quot;Household Words&quot;. Chisholm&#x27;s daughter, Caroline Agnes, was born in 1848, during the couple&#x27;s time in London.

Chisholm gave evidence before two House of Lords select committees and gained support for some of her initiatives. The Committee supported providing free passage to Australia for the wives and children of former convicts, and for children who, through necessity, emigrants had left behind in England.

In 1849, with the support of Lord Shaftesbury, Sir Sidney Herbert, and Wyndham Harding, Chisholm founded the Family Colonisation Loan Society from her home in Charlton Crescent in Islington. The Society&#x27;s aim was to support emigration by lending half the cost of the fare (the emigrant to provide the other half). After living two years in Australia, an emigrant would be expected to repay the loan.

Chisholm also held regular meetings at Charlton Crescent to give practical advice to emigrants. The Society initially found accommodation onboard private emigrant ships. Later, it chartered ships to transport emigrants. Chisholm&#x27;s insistence that the Society&#x27;s ships improve their accommodations resulted in the upgrading of the Passenger Acts. In 1851, her husband, Archibald Chisholm, returned to Australia to act as an honorary colonial agent, to help newly arrived migrants and to collect repayment of loans.

By 1854, the Society had assisted more than 3,000 people to emigrate to Australia. Chisholm gave emigration lectures throughout Britain, and also toured France and Italy. She collected their son William from the Propaganda College, where he had been studying to become a Roman Catholic priest. Chisholm had an audience with Pope Pius IX at the Vatican, who gave her a Papal Medal and bust of herself.

==Return to Australia and later life==
In 1854 Chisholm returned to Australia aboard the &quot;Ballarat&quot;. She toured the Victorian goldfields and was appalled by the conditions en route. She proposed the construction of shelter sheds about a day&#x27;s walk apart so that prospectors and their families could travel to the work of the goldfields. The project received support from the government. Chisholm continued to work in Melbourne, travelling to and from the home and store which the Chisholms had purchased in Kyneton. She joined her family there three years later. Archibald served as a magistrate during his time in Kyneton, and the two elder sons helped him run the store.

Due to Chisholm&#x27;s ill health, the family moved back to Sydney in 1858. Her health improved. At the end of 1859 and the beginning of 1860, Chisholm gave four political lectures. She called for land to be allocated so that emigrant families could establish small farms. She believed such action would provide greater stability among the new settlers in the colonies. Chisholm also wrote a novella, &quot;Little Joe,&quot; that was serialised in the local paper.

Her husband accompanied the younger children back to England in 1865. Archibald Jr. accompanied his mother on her return to England in 1866. Chisholm died in London, England on 25 March 1877, and her husband died in August that year. Five of their eight children survived their parents.

Chisholm&#x27;s body was taken to her home town, Northampton, where it rested overnight in the Cathedral of Our Lady and St Thomas. She and her husband are buried in the same grave in Billing Road Cemetery.

<text>San Juan, officially the City of San Juan (), is a highly urbanized city in the National Capital Region of the Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it had a population of 126,347 people. It is geographically located in Metro Manila&#x27;s approximate center and is also the country&#x27;s smallest city in terms of land area.

The city is known historically for the site of the first battle of the Katipunan, the organization which led the 1896 Philippine Revolution against the Spanish Empire. Notable landmarks today such as the Pinaglabanan Shrine and heritage homes are located in the city. Other locations include Greenhills and Santolan Town Plaza, making the city a major shopping hub with a range of upscale, boutique, and bargain retail.

==Etymology==
&quot;San Juan&quot; is a contraction of the city&#x27;s traditional name of &quot;San Juan del Monte&quot; (). As with numerous other places in the Philippines, the name combines a patron saint and a toponym; in this case Saint John the Baptist with the locale&#x27;s hilly terrain and relatively higher elevation compared to surrounding areas.

The city&#x27;s official name is &quot;Dakilang Lungsód ng San Juan&quot; ().

==History==
===Early history===
During the pre-Hispanic period, the area of what is now San Juan was a part of the Kingdom of Namayan, whose last recorded rulers were King Lakan Tagkan and his consort, Bouan.

===Spanish colonial era===

In the late 16th century, the kingdom and other polities in the islands were absorbed into the Spanish Crown, with the realm of Namayan christened as the parish of &quot;Santa Ana de Sapa&quot;. (present-day Santa Ana, Manila) The present area of San Juan was meanwhile re-classified as the small &quot;encomienda&quot; (town) of San Juan del Monte in 1590.

In 1602, along the Camino de Mandaluyong (now F. Blumentritt Street), the Dominican Order built a novitiate house in the town for their immediate use, where ageing or convalescing friars stayed. Within the area, the Dominicans also constructed a convent and a stone church, the Santuario del Santo Cristo, dedicating it to the Holy Cross. To this day, the thrice-rebuilt church stands on the same site, adjacent to Aquinas School and Dominican College.

Given the isolation that the town had from the city of Manila, the colonial government decided to establish a heavily fortified gunpowder magazine called the &quot;Almacén de Pólvora&quot; (also known as &quot;El Polvorín&quot;) in San Juan del Monte in 1771. The gunpowder magazine (located at present-day San Juan Elementary School) was situated along the banks of the Salapang River (now known as Salapán Creek), with access provided by the Camino de Mariquina (now N. Domingo Street), which connected Manila and the nearby barrio of Santa Mesa across the San Juan River Bridge to the &quot;pueblo&quot; of Mariquina (now Marikina).

====Municipality established====
In 1783, San Juan del Monte was promoted to a municipality, separating it from the Santa Ana parish and giving it its own local government as a barrio of the Province of Manila. As a result, the old &quot;poblacion&quot; at Santuario del Santo Cristo was moved to the Camino de Mariquina, where a new municipal hall (now the San Juan Medical Center) and a town plaza (now the San Juan Plaza Mayor) was constructed.

In 1892, Father Bernardino Nozaleda, the Archbishop of Manila, approved the creation of a new parish for the municipality of San Juan del Monte, with the Franciscans establishing the San Juan Bautista Church (now Pinaglabanan Church) and a parochial house in the area now known as Pinaglabanan Street.

====The Philippine revolution====

When the Philippine Revolution against Spain broke out in August 1896, the Katipunan revolutionaries led by Andrés Bonifacio and his aide Emilio Jacinto made their way from Pugad Lawin in Caloocan (now part of Quezon City) to attack the &quot;El Polvorín&quot; and its military garrison in San Juan del Monte on the morning of August 30, 1896. Defended by a hundred Spanish troops consisting of infantry and artillery, the Katipuneros were able to eliminate the garrison commander and an artilleryman, forcing the remaining Spanish troops to retreat to the nearby El Deposito water reservoir near the San Juan Bautista Church. Sustaining heavy losses, the Katipuneros were unable to capture El Polvorín, and retreated south towards Mandaluyong, where Bonifacio reorganized the surviving Katipuneros and issued a war manifesto, leading Katipuneros in other places to organize Filipinos to rise up in arms against the colonial government as revolts spread all across the archipelago.

===American invasion and Philippine Commonwealth===

Following the end of the Philippine Revolution and the Treaty of Paris in 1898 that seceded the Philippines to the United States, the First Philippine Republic that succeeded the Katipunan distrusted the occupying American forces that were arriving in droves, with both sides wanting to engage in combat. On the morning of February 4, 1899, Filipino troops from the 4th Company of the Morong Battalion under Captain Serapio Narvaez were fired upon by American troops of the 1st Nebraska Infantry Regiment from their defense line on the Santa Mesa side (now part of Sampaloc).

The first shot was exchanged by Private William W. Grayson, an American sentry from the 1st Nebraska Infantry Regiment of the United States Volunteer Army, who killed Filipino corporal Anastacio Felix and another Filipino soldier of the Philippine Revolutionary Army, firing the first shot of the Philippine–American War. This prompted lines of Filipino troops in San Juan del Monte to open fire at the line of American troops in Santa Mesa.

On the evening of February 4, Private William W. Grayson fired the war&#x27;s first shots at the corner of Sociego Street and Tomas Arguelles Street. A study done by Ronnie Miravite Casalmir places the event at this corner, not at Sociego-Silencio where they erroneously have the marker.

Throughout the war, various regiments of the United States Volunteer Army carried out multiple skirmishes against militias and soldiers of the First Philippine Republic in towns along the Camino de Mariquina, where they had cleared out Filipino forces at the &quot;El Deposito&quot; reservoir, its pumping station road (now Pinaglabanan Street, part of Santolan Road), and the santuario.

Both the revolution and the war caused many of the original residents of San Juan del Monte to evacuate en masse, permanently settling in neighboring towns. This led to many lots becoming abandoned. From 1898 to 1899, some residents returned to the town, resettling in shacks. However, due to unsanitary conditions, a malaria epidemic broke out in the area, with many casualties.

Following the end of the Philippine-American War, the municipality was repopulated by families coming from Mariquina and San Mateo. The Dominicans had also returned to the municipality to establish their ownership of the Santo Cristo hacienda before the new American colonial government. As a result, much of San Juan del Monte was being leased to the municipal government by Dominican hacienda owners until these lands were eventually purchased by the municipal government.

In 1901, the municipality was incorporated into the new province of Rizal through Act No. 137, with former Katipunan San Juan chapter &quot;sanggunian&quot; Andres Soriano serving as its first municipal president. In 1903, it was merged into the municipality of San Felipe Neri (present-day Mandaluyong) through Act No. 942 of the Taft Commission. San Felipe Neri later became the capital of Rizal for several months in 1904. In 1907, San Juan del Monte was reconstituted as an independent municipality through Act No. 1625.
In 1916, the municipal government purchased the land along the intersection of N. Domingo and F. Blumentritt Streets, where the town market (present-day Agora Market) was located. Likewise, in 1919, businessmen Eusebio Orense and Florencio G. Diaz purchased a great bulk of the remaining hacienda lands, selling it to a Filipino-American consortium developing the San Juan Heights, a series of new subdivision developments all across the area. It was around this time that the municipality&#x27;s name was contracted to San Juan.

A report made by the Rizal provincial government in 1933 noted that San Juan increased in population due to the development of residential subdivisions, such as San Juan Heights, Manila Heights, San Francisco del Monte Heights, Addition Hills, New Manila, and Rosario Heights. At the time, the municipality consisted of the nine barrios of Poblacion, Andres Bonifacio, Ermitaño, N. Domingo, Rincon, San Francisco del Monte, Sapang Camias, Sulapan, and Tibagan.

Between 1939 and 1941, the barrios of Cubao, Diliman, and San Francisco del Monte, as well as Camp Crame, were ceded from San Juan to the newly established Quezon City.

===Japanese occupation era===
On January 1, 1942, San Juan was one of the municipalities of Rizal merged alongside Manila and Quezon City to form the City of Greater Manila as an emergency measure by President Manuel L. Quezon. It became a municipality of Rizal once again when the City of Greater Manila was dissolved by President Sergio Osmeña effective August 1, 1945.

===Philippine independence===
====Martial law era====

San Juan, especially its exclusive subdivisions in Greenhills, was home to many prominent personalities during the country&#x27;s Martial Law era under President Ferdinand Marcos. This included several Armed Forces of the Philippines generals, including Romeo Espino, Alfredo Montoya, and Romeo Gatan, who would later be tagged as members of the &quot;Rolex 12&quot;; Imelda Marcos’ secretary Fe Jimenez Roa; Presidential Assistant on Legal Affairs Ronaldo Zamora, who would later become a congressman for the lone congressional district of San Juan; San Juan Mayor Joseph Estrada, who would later become President of the Philippines; and prominent journalist Maximo Soliven, who was imprisoned when President Marcos first declared Martial Law in September 1972.

====Incorporation into Metro Manila====
When Presidential Decree No. 824 establishing the National Capital Region was signed on November 7, 1975, San Juan was among the towns excised from Rizal Province into the newly created metropolitan area.

====People Power Revolution====

Club Filipino, which had relocated to San Juan in 1970 from its original location in Santa Mesa, became an important part of the establishment of the Fifth Philippine Republic when Corazon Aquino was inaugurated there on February 25, 1986, the last day of the civilian-led 1986 People Power Revolution.

===Contemporary===
In 1992, San Juan had the fewest informal settler families out of all the municipalities and cities in Metro Manila based on data from the National Housing Authority.

====Cityhood====

Residents ratified the conversion of the municipality into a highly urbanized city on June 17, 2007, pursuant to Republic Act No. 9388 (&quot;An Act Converting the Municipality of San Juan into a Highly Urbanized City to be known as the City of San Juan&quot;). Then-Representative Ronaldo Zamora sponsored the Cityhood Bill in the House of Representatives and worked for its approval.

====Presidential ties====
Although not officially designated as such, San Juan is noted to be the &quot;City of Philippine Presidents.&quot; Five presidents were official residents of San Juan. They were the Macapagal &quot;père et fille&quot;, Diosdado (1961–1965) and Gloria Macapagal Arroyo (2001–2010); Marcos &quot;père et fils&quot;, Ferdinand Sr. (1965–1986) and Ferdinand Jr. (2022–present); and Joseph Estrada (1998–2001), who also served as Mayor when San Juan was still a municipality.

==Geography==

San Juan is the least-extensive city in the Philippines with a total area of just .

San Juan is bounded by Quezon City on the north and east, Mandaluyong on the south, and the City of Manila in the west.

The territory of San Juan was once much larger than it is now, having been adjacent to Caloocan and Marikina prior to the creation of Quezon City. Parts of the present-day Districts 1, 3, and 4 of Quezon City, as well as areas of Mandaluyong, were originally within the town&#x27;s colonial-era borders. This also explains why San Juan Reservoir is in nearby Horseshoe Village, a subdivision now part of Quezon City.

===Barangays===

San Juan is politically subdivided and comprises into 21 barangays organized into two city council districts:

==Demographics==
===Religion===

The city also has several notable places of worship. Archdiocesan Shrine of Saint John the Baptist, more commonly known as &quot;Pinaglabanan&quot; Church&quot;, is where the city&#x27;s patron saint, John the Baptist, is enshrined. The Santuario del Santo Cristo is the settlement&#x27;s oldest existing church, while Mary the Queen Parish in West Greenhills serves the local Filipino-Chinese community.

From 1925 to 1971, the Iglesia ni Cristo once headquartered in the town at its former Central Office Complex, now known as the Locale of F. Manalo. It features Art-Deco designed ensembles, crafted by National Artist for Architecture Juan Nakpil. The chapel is the centerpiece of the Complex, which also contains the old Central Office and Pastoral House that was the home of the church&#x27;s first Executive Minister, Felix Manalo, along with other Ministers and Evangelical Workers. When Manalo died in 1963, a mausoleum was constructed on the grounds of the Complex by architect Carlos Santos-Viola. INC adherents in San Juan comprise 4.2% of the city population.

San Juan also has a number of Evangelical churches. Through the APOI (Association of Pastors for Outreach and Intercession), they have contributed to the spiritual atmosphere of the city. Every January, the city celebrates the National Bible Week, where the reading of the Scripture happens during the flag raising ceremony in the City Hall. Through the blessing of the mayor, a bible was planted in the heart of the new city hall during its construction. Major evangelical churches like Jesus is Lord and Victory Greenhills are also found in the city of San Juan.

San Juan is also home to two Islamic mosques, namely: Masjid Hamza Bin Ahmed in Balong-Bato and Greenhills Masjid at Greenhills.

On the 2024 feast of St. John the Baptist, the local government declared him as patron saint of San Juan City.

==Economy==

San Juan is predominantly residential, mixed with commercial and manufacturing businesses.

The Greenhills shopping district is the hub of trade and commerce in San Juan. The shopping complex housed shopping malls, the Virra Mall, Shoppesville, Greenhills Theatre Mall, Promenade Mall, the former Greenhills Bowling Alley, and Unimart.

As of 2022, San Juan had the labor force participation rate of 67%, the most in the Philippines.

==Culture==
===Wattah Wattah Festival===
Since 2003, San Juan celebrates the feast of its patron saint, St. John the Baptist every June 24 with its Wattah Wattah Festival, a festival with dancing, parades, and its traditional &quot;basaan&quot; or water dousing along the city streets. The festival and its activities are usually held along N. Domingo Street and Pinaglabanan Street as the procession of the image of St. John the Baptist goes down the streets.

San Juan City Ordinance No. 51 series of 2018 prohibits dirty water, ice, water in glass bottles, and water or ice in other materials that will incite pain or injury upon impact from being used in the festival. Physical violence, inciting of threats, and deliberately entering public transport vehicles to douse commuters is also not allowed.

However, in 2020 and 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the festival was reduced to a parade of the image of St. John the Baptist with social distancing and mask mandates in place. In 2022, due to a lower number of COVID-19 cases, the traditional &quot;basaan&quot; was included again in the Wattah! Wattah! Festival, accompanied by a street dancing competition, a free concert, and a fireworks display.

===Sports===
San Juan has a long history with sports, the Filoil EcoOil Centre has hosted numerous sporting events, including the Philippine Basketball Association, Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League, Premier Volleyball League, and the Filoil EcoOil Preseason Cup.

The city is also home to the San Juan Knights, which started in the now-defunct Metropolitan Basketball Association and now competes in the Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League. The Knights have won three league championships in its entire franchise history.

==Transportation==


Modes of public transportation in San Juan include jeepneys and buses. Jeepney routes ply the Aurora Boulevard (R-6). The city is serviced by J. Ruiz station of the LRT Line 2 in the city proper and indirectly served by Santolan-Annapolis station of the MRT Line 3, at the city&#x27;s eastern boundary with Quezon City.
The C-3 (Araneta Avenue) also passes through San Juan. Secondary routes include Nicolas Domingo (abbreviated N. Domingo), which heads towards Cubao in Quezon City, and Pinaglabanan Street (which continues as Santolan Road) leading towards Ortigas Avenue and eventually the southern reaches of Quezon City near Camp Crame, the headquarters of the Philippine National Police.

==Education==

The Schools Divisions Office (SDO) of San Juan oversees 9 public elementary schools, 2 public high schools, and a science high school within the city. The SDO also recognizes 24 private schools in San Juan City, seven of which are preschools, four of which are elementary schools, and 13 of which are high schools.

<text>S.O.B. is a 1981 American satirical black comedy film written and directed by Blake Edwards, starring Julie Andrews, Richard Mulligan, Robert Preston, Larry Hagman, Robert Vaughn, Robert Webber, Loretta Swit, Shelley Winters, and William Holden in his final film role. The film was produced by Lorimar and was released by Paramount Pictures on July 1, 1981.

==Plot==
The satirical plot follows film industry denizens and Hollywood society, all preoccupied with making a movie. After an elaborate song-and-dance sequence set to &quot;Polly Wolly Doodle&quot;, we learn successful film producer Felix Farmer has just suffered the first major flop of his career, resulting in the loss of millions of dollars to Capitol film studios and his own sanity.

Felix makes multiple suicide attempts, each one a failure. He is rescued by beachgoers after his carbon monoxide–filled car accidentally slips into gear, crashes through the garage and into the Pacific Ocean. His attempt to hang himself in an upstairs bedroom fails when he crashes through the floor, injuring a Hollywood gossip columnist standing in the room below. While Felix is variously catatonic or heavily sedated, his friends and many hangers-on occupy his Malibu beach house, which leads to a party, which degenerates into an orgy. Felix then tries to asphyxiate himself in his kitchen oven but he is again thwarted by two randy party guests with other things on their mind. Felix next attempts to shoot himself, but is distracted by a young woman wearing only a pair of panties. This experience gives Felix a sudden, intense epiphany: His film&#x27;s failure was due to its lack of sex.

Thoroughly convinced that an erotic version of &quot;Night Wind&quot; will be a resounding success, Felix persuades the executives at Capitol studios to sell him the film outright. He then attempts to convince his recently estranged wife Sally Miles, the star of &quot;Night Wind&quot; and an Oscar-winning actress with a squeaky-clean image, to perform in the revised film—now a softcore pornographic musical where she would appear topless. Despite Sally&#x27;s objections, Felix liquidates most of their financial holdings to buy the existing footage and to finance further production. The studio executives believe Felix is deranged and initially are keen to unload the film and recoup their investment. However, when Sally goes through with the topless scene and the revised &quot;Night Wind&quot; seems a likely success, they plot to regain control. Since half of Felix&#x27;s assets legally belong to Sally, the studio persuades her to sign a distribution deal that also gives them the right to edit the film. Hysterical and brandishing a water pistol, Felix attempts to steal the film negatives from Capitol studio&#x27;s color lab vault but he is shot and killed by police, after holding the lab&#x27;s manager hostage.

Felix&#x27;s tragic death creates a crisis for his cronies, film director Tim Culley, press agent Ben Coogan, and physician Dr. Irving Finegarten; the trio decide to save their friend from the lavish but hypocritical Hollywood funeral and give Felix a proper sendoff. They break into the funeral home, steal his body and substitute the corpse of a largely forgotten character actor who died on the beach at the beginning of the film. After toasting their fallen comrade, the three give Felix a Viking funeral in a burning dinghy, while the actor in Felix&#x27;s coffin gets an elaborate Hollywood sendoff. The epilogue reveals that Felix was right: His revamped &quot;Night Wind&quot; was a box-office smash for the studio, with Sally winning another Academy Award for her performance.

==Title==
&quot;S.O.B.&quot; (in the film) stands for &quot;Standard Operational Bullshit&quot; and refers to misinformation being the norm. The abbreviation means &quot;sexually oriented business&quot; (if pertaining to strip clubs) and more generally &quot;son of a bitch&quot; (a ruthless person).

A Spanish dub of the film keeps the abbreviation S.O.B., claiming that it stands for &quot;Sois honrados Bandidos&quot; (&quot;You Are Honest Crooks&quot;). The Argentine title for the movie was changed to &quot;Se acabó el mundo&quot; (&quot;The World is Ended&quot;), having no relation to the original title.

Three years later, when Edwards had his name removed from the writing credits of 1984&#x27;s &quot;City Heat&quot;, he was billed under the pseudonym Sam O. Brown. (S.O.B.)

==Influences==
When writing the screenplay, Edwards drew upon several of his own experiences as a film maker. The character of Felix Farmer is a person not unlike Edwards, while actress Sally Miles bears certain similarities to real-life wife Julie Andrews (who plays her).

The story of &quot;S.O.B.&quot; parallels the experiences of Edwards and Andrews in their infamous, but Academy Award-nominated, failure, &quot;Darling Lili&quot;. Intended to reveal Andrews&#x27; heretofore unseen wicked and sexy side, that film had a troubled shoot, went significantly over budget, and was subjected to postproduction studio interference. The early 1970s brought more bad news for Edwards; he made two films for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, &quot;Wild Rovers&quot;, a Western with William Holden and Ryan O&#x27;Neil and &quot;The Carey Treatment&quot; with James Coburn. Once again, studio interference occurred during postproduction of both films, which were edited without any input from Edwards. Both movies opened to negative reviews and poor business. Hit hard financially and personally by these events, Edwards moved to Europe to work independently, away from the meddling and restrictions of the Hollywood studios. The plan worked, leading to several successful projects, including three very profitable &quot;Pink Panther&quot; sequels starring Peter Sellers.

In &quot;S.O.B.&quot;, Andrews&#x27;s character agrees (with some pharmaceutical persuasion) to &quot;show my boobies&quot; in a scene in the film-within-the-film. For this scene, comedian Johnny Carson thanked Andrews on the Academy Awards for &quot;showing us that the hills were still alive,&quot; alluding to a famous line from &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; opening sequence.

==Production==
&quot;S.O.B.&quot; had been in development by Edwards since 1976. In 1979, the film was set for preproduction at Orion Pictures with distribution by Warner Bros., Edwards&#x27;s third film with Orion after &quot;10&quot; and &quot;The Ferret&quot;, which was due to star Dudley Moore. In July 1979, Orion put the film into turnaround. Later that year, Edwards signed a deal with Lorimar through United Artists set to distribute. In January 1980, &quot;Variety&quot; announced that Cloris Leachman and David Callan had been named among the cast members, but neither ultimately appeared in the film; &quot;Variety&quot; also reported that Joel Grey had turned down a role in &quot;S.O.B.&quot; In 1981, Lorimar&#x27;s distribution agreement with UA ended and Lorimar began distributing their films through Paramount Pictures. Paramount released &quot;S.O.B.&quot; in July, 1981, though much animosity still existed between Edwards and Paramount over the &quot;Darling Lili&quot; debacle.

Filming of &quot;S.O.B.&quot; took place between March and July 1980 in Los Angeles, Malibu, and Santa Monica on a budget of $12 million.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;S.O.B.&quot; was released in July 1981, with critical opinion of the film sharply divided. Remarkably, the screenplay was nominated for both a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Comedy Written Directly for the Screen, and a Razzie Award for Worst Screenplay. It was also nominated for a Razzie for Worst Director and a Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Comedy/Musical.

&quot;S.O.B.&quot; currently holds an 81% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 26 reviews, with an average rating of 6.90/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;A sustained blast of unbridled vitriol from writer-director Blake Edwards, &quot;S.O.B.&quot; is one of the blackest – and most consistently funny – Hollywood satires ever put to film.&quot;

Vincent Canby, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, described &quot;S.O.B.&quot; as &quot;a nasty, biased, self-serving movie that also happens to be hilarious most of the time...It&#x27;s difficult to remember a film as mean-spirited as &quot;S.O.B.&quot; that also was so consistently funny.&quot; Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel, then hosts of the PBS film review program &quot;Sneak Previews&quot;, both gave &quot;S.O.B.&quot; a positive review.

===Box office===
The film grossed $3,116,078 over the five-day 4th of July holiday weekend and went on to gross $14.8 million in the United States and Canada. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; dubbed the film a box-office flop.

==Television version==
Broadcast television prints of &quot;S.O.B.&quot; contain alternate takes and edits of several scenes originally containing sex and nudity, such as the party and orgy scenes and &quot; Night Wind&quot;″s erotica dream sequence where Julie Andrews exposes her breasts. The television version contains a scene where Robert Vaughn, as studio head David Blackman, receives a phone call while in bed with his mistress, and is simply seen naked from the waist up. In the original theatrical print, he is wearing a bustier and nylon stockings.

==Home media==
The original video release was made by CBS Video Enterprises in 1982, on both VHS and CED Videodisc, and was later reissued on VHS by CBS/Fox Video in the mid-1980s. Warner Bros. bought ancillary rights in 1989 with their purchase of Lorimar, and the film was released on Laserdisc through Warner Home Video in 1990. Warner released a DVD edition in 2002 and reissued in 2012. In 2017 Warner Archive released the film on Blu-ray.

<text>Navotas, officially the City of Navotas (), is a highly urbanized city in the National Capital Region of the Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 247,543 people.

It was formerly part of the Province of Rizal in southern Luzon. It comprises what is known as the CAMANAVA area along with the cities of Caloocan, Malabon, and Valenzuela.

It is known as the &quot;Commercial Fishing Hub of the Philippines&quot;, for the city has the third largest fish port in Asia and the largest in Southeast Asia. Although it was established on February 16, 1859, Navotas celebrates its foundation day every January 16, the day in 1906 when it finally separated from Malabon. Navotas became a highly urbanized city on June 24, 2007.

==Etymology==
Navotas was once part of Malabon. According to one legend, the long and narrow delta extended unbroken from north to south along the seashore. The strip of land between the former district of Tondo, Manila and this town was eaten away by the sea until an opening was made. Water began to flow through the opening. The geographical change prompted the people to refer to the place as &quot;&quot;butas&quot;, &quot;nayon ng butas&quot;, or &quot;nabutas&quot;&quot;, a Tagalog word that means breached or pierced through. What began as a natural channel developed into a regular waterway, now known as the Navotas River. In later years, the place came to be known as &quot;Nabotas&quot;, then &quot;Navotas&quot;.

It was also known as Hacienda de Navotas. It was once owned by the Dominican friars until it was sold to the Pascual family during the early days of the American regime and developed into a residential estate.

San Jose de Navotas was the name given to the locality after its patron saint, Saint Joseph. On June 11, 1859, a &quot;Superior Decreto&quot; established a new parish and municipality under the supervision of Friar Matias Navoa. The populace was divided into two distinct groups, the &quot;naturales&quot; (locals) and the &quot;mestizos&quot;. Mariano Estrellas was the &quot;gobernadorcillo&quot; (petty governor) of the &quot;naturales&quot; and Mariano Israel, of the &quot;mestizos&quot;. Today, because records are incomplete, recognition is only given to the &quot;gobernadorcillos&quot; for the &quot;mestizos&quot;. A school in honor of San Jose was built and known as &quot;San Jose Academy.&quot;

==History==

===Spanish colonial era===
The movement for the separation of barrios San Jose de Navotas and Bangkulasi from Tambobong (now Malabon), then a town in the province of Tondo (later Manila), began on December 20, 1827. Led by the &quot;principales&quot; of such barrios, such separation was petitioned before the Spanish colonial government when the locals experienced difficulties in doing business transactions and accessing Tambobong&#x27;s &quot;poblacion&quot; across what is now the Navotas River for religious events. 

On February 16, 1859, the petition was finally granted, separating both barrios from Tambobong to form a new distinct town. The town initially composed of four &quot;barrio&quot;s (villages): San Jose, Tangos, Bangkulasi, and Tanza. Later on June 11, the Real Audiencia enacted a &quot;Superior Decreto&quot;, which established the San Jose de Navotas Parish with a church and parochial school.

On August 6, 1898, Navotas joined the revolutionary government of General Emilio Aguinaldo.

===American occupation===
On June 11, 1901, Navotas was eventually incorporated into the newly created province of Rizal with the enactment of Act No. 137.

On October 12, 1903, the town was returned to Malabon by virtue of Act No. 942. On January 16, 1906, Navotas regained its independent municipality status with the enactment of Act No. 1442 which separated it from Malabon.

===Philippine independence===
On November 7, 1975, Navotas was transferred from the province of Rizal to the newly formed National Capital Region or Metro Manila, by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 824.

===Cityhood===
On June 24, 2007, Navotas became a highly urbanized city by virtue of Republic Act No. 9387 dated March 10, 2007, after a plebiscite was conducted.

==Government==

===Local government===
===Elected officials===

===Political profile===

With regards to the separation of Navotas from Malabon in 1859 and the organization thereof as a distinct municipality or &quot;pueblo&quot; with its own government and church, this town was headed by the
gobernadorcillos who exercised executive and judicial functions.
However, as this locality was composed of two groups the naturales and the mestizos, each of which had its own gobernadorcillo appointed by the governor-general who was the supreme authority in all local matters, since the inhabitants did not allow choosing their officials. This political system was somehow revoked at the end of the Spanish Regime through the Maura Law of 1883, which guided some of the selected officials to the supervision of an insular authority. During the revolutionary period (from 1898 to 1902), as the democratic system of local governance was being established via the First Philippines Republic and Malolos Constitution, people of Navotas with high character, social position and honorable conduct gathered in a meeting and elected the chief of the town, the
headman of the barrio (barangay) and three officials viz., for police and internal order, justice and civil registry, and taxes and property. In this situation, these elected officials constitute an assembly wherein the chief of the
town was the president, the headman, the vice-president, and the justice officer the secretary. In this period, the name of Navotas LGU and its head were changed from &quot;pueblo to municipality&quot; and from &quot;President to Mayor&quot;. Philippine Commission, which exercised supervision over local government, appointed the first local
official. Gradually, election of officials was allowed.

During the period of the Philippine Commonwealth (from 1935 to 1945), the 1935 constitution ushered.
This provided that the President of the Philippines should exercise general supervision over all local
governments. This allowed Navotas to have three leaders. This trend from 1946 to 1972 (during the second Philippine Republic) was toward decentralization. Congress passed laws giving more autonomy to Local Government Units through the grant of additional powers and lessening of national control affairs. This created four Mayors of Navotas. During the Martial Law Period, President Marcos had changed the structure and functions of LGU&#x27;s, thus
decentralization suffered the set back with the concentration of power on his hands. After December 31, 1975 (expiration of tenure of office of the local elective officials), the President assumed the power of appointment of
the officials as authorized by the people in a referendum held on February 27, 1975. During the Marcos Regime, Navotas had two Mayors.

Navotas was proclaimed as a full-fledged city by virtue of RA 9387 that converted the municipality of Navotas into a highly urbanized city. A plebiscite was held on June 24, 2007, which was ratified the conversion of Navotas into a highly urbanized city.

==Education==
Navotas has 15 public elementary schools and 6 public secondary schools including Navotas National High School and Kaunlaran High School. The Navotas Polytechnic College located at the North Bay Boulevard South in Kaunlaran Village is owned and operated by the city.

==Sports==
Navotas was home to the Navotas Uni-Pak Sardines, a founding member of the Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League during its inaugural season and played for three seasons until the 2019–20 season.

==Transportation==
Transportation in Navotas is provided by cars, bicycle pedicab, tricycles, boats, bus, jeepney and taxi.

C-4 Road between Tanong, Malabon and Navotas West is the most popular bus stopover.

Commuting in boats is popular in the city because of its location by Manila Bay. The pier of commuting boats are located in San Roque, Navotas that connects to Tanza, Navotas, which is separated by water.

<doc id="492205" wikidata="Q1145630" url="?curid=492205" title="Children's Day (Japan)">
<text>is a public holiday in Japan which takes place annually on May 5 and is the final celebration in Golden Week. It is a day set aside to respect children&#x27;s personalities and to celebrate their happiness. It was designated a national holiday by the Japanese government in 1948, but has been a day of celebration in Japan since ancient times.

Children&#x27;s Day has officially been a day to wish for the happiness of both male and female children since 1948, but its origin, &quot;Tango no Sekku&quot;, was a day for boys from the Kamakura period in the 12th century to the mid-20th century, and the customs of Children&#x27;s Day still retain vestiges from that time.

==History==
The day was originally called one of the five annual ceremonies held at the imperial courtand was celebrated on the fifth day of the fifth moon in the Lunisolar calendar.

&quot;Tango no Sekku&quot; was originally a day for women to purify the house by thatching the roof with irises, which were believed to be effective in repelling evil spirits, and for women to rest their bodies, but it was changed to a day for boys in the Kamakura period (1185–1333) when the samurai class took control of the government. The reason for this was that the iris was a plant that represented the samurai because its leaves were shaped like the blade of a Japanese sword, and the word &quot;shōbu&quot; (尚武), which means &quot;to value military affairs&quot;, had the same pronunciation as iris (菖蒲) and was therefore considered an auspicious plant for the samurai. Since this period, &quot;yabusame&quot; (Japanese horseback archery) was held on May 5 as a way to ward off evil spirits.

The custom of displaying mini Japanese armor and &quot;kabuto&quot; (helmets) on Children&#x27;s Day, called &quot;Gogatsu Ningyo&quot; (May doll), has its origins in the Kamakura to Muromachi periods (1333–1573). Samurai used to take their armor, &quot;kabuto&quot;, and Japanese swords out of their storage boxes in May before the rainy season to take care of them. Since this was the time of the &quot;Tango no Sekku&quot;, they began to display armor, &quot;kabuto&quot;, and Japanese swords in the hope of protecting their children.

During the Edo period (1603–1867), &quot;Tango no Sekku&quot; celebrations became extravagant, and samurai households began to display samurai dolls (&quot;Musha Ningyo&quot;, 武者人形) in addition to real armor, &quot;kabuto&quot;, and Japanese swords. Ordinary households began to display paper &quot;kabuto&quot;. The custom of bathing in the bathtub with irises on May 5 began in this period.

The custom of decorating &quot;koinobori&quot; (carp streamers) on Children&#x27;s Day originated in the Edo period (1603–1867). During the Edo period, samurai households began to decorate their yards with &quot;nobori&quot; or &quot;fukinuke&quot; (吹貫) flags, which were colored with &quot;mon&quot; (family crests) to represent military units, during &quot;Tango no Sekku&quot;. The &quot;nobori&quot; and &quot;fukinuke&quot; were then merged, and the first &quot;koinobori&quot; appeared in Edo (now Tokyo). The colorful &quot;koinobori&quot; as we know them today became popular from the Meiji era (1868–1912).

After Japan switched to the Gregorian calendar, the date was moved to May 5. Until 1948, Children&#x27;s Day was known as Boys&#x27; Day (also known as Feast of Banners), celebrating boys and recognizing fathers, as the counterpart to Hinamatsuri, or &quot;Girl&#x27;s Day&quot; on . In 1948, the name was changed to Children&#x27;s Day to include both male and female children, as well as recognizing mothers along with fathers and family qualities of unity.

In the Showa era (1926–1989), the popularity shifted from samurai dolls to miniature armor, and since the 21st century, miniature &quot;kabuto&quot; have become popular, probably due to the size of Japanese houses.

==Celebration==
On this day, families raise the &quot;koinobori&quot;, carp-shaped windsock (because of the Chinese legend that a carp that swims upstream becomes a dragon and flies to Heaven, and the resemblance of the waving windsock to swimming fish), with a black carp for the father, a red or pink for the mother, and one carp (usually blue, and sometimes green and orange too) for each child. Traditionally, when celebrated as Boys&#x27; Day, the red &quot;koinobori&quot; was for the eldest son with blue and additional colors for younger brothers.

In modern times, Japanese families usually display miniature Japanese armor and &quot;kabuto&quot; called &quot;Gogatsu Ningyo&quot; (May doll) on Children&#x27;s Day. These dolls are usually made in the style of &quot;ō-yoroi&quot; or &quot;dō-maru&quot; popular in the Heian (794–1185) and Kamakura periods (1185–1333), which is more showy in appearance than the &quot;tōsei gusoku&quot; style armor of the Sengoku period. There are also &quot;kabuto&quot; made to fit the size of a boy&#x27;s head that can actually be worn. The formal &quot;Gogatsu Ningyo&quot; is displayed on a tiered shelf with a &quot;yumi&quot; (bow), &quot;tachi&quot; (long sword), Japanese war fan, and &quot;jingasa&quot; (samurai hats).

Until the Edo period, samurai dolls were more common than miniature armor and &quot;kabuto&quot;, and the Japanese folk heroes Momotarō, Kintarō, Ushiwakamaru, Benkei, Emperor Jinmu, and Shoki were often chosen as subjects.

&quot;Kashiwa mochi&quot; (sticky rice cakes filled with red bean jam and wrapped in oak leaves) and &quot;chimaki&quot; (sticky sweet rice wrapped in an iris or bamboo leaf) are traditionally served on this day. The oak leaf used for &quot;kashiwa mochi&quot; is said to be a tree whose old leaves do not fall off until new leaves appear, and is considered a good-luck charm representing prosperity of offspring.

Since irises are believed to have medicinal properties and to ward off evil, they are used for various purposes on May 5. For example, people would take a bath with irises in the bathtub, soak thinly sliced iris roots or leaves in sake and drink it, or put irises in thin &quot;washi&quot; (Japanese traditional paper) before putting it in their pillows and going to bed.

<doc id="492207" wikidata="Q880172" url="?curid=492207" title="Black Cat (manga)">
<text>Black Cat (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Kentaro Yabuki. It was originally serialized in publisher Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; from July 2000 to June 2004, with the chapters later collected into twenty (bound volumes) by Shueisha. The story centers on a man named Train Heartnet who withdrew from an elite group of assassins called the Chronos Numbers to become a bounty hunter.

The series was adapted into a twenty-four episode anime television series by studio Gonzo, which originally aired on Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS) from October 2005 to March 2006. The manga was licensed for English-language publication in North America by Viz Media and in Australasia by Madman Entertainment. Funimation Entertainment licensed the anime for an English dub and North American broadcast on their own Funimation Channel, with Madman releasing it in Australasia and MVM Films in the United Kingdom.

In Japan, the &quot;Black Cat&quot; manga sold over 12 million copies, while in North America several volumes have been featured in weekly top ten lists of best-selling manga. The anime has also been popular in both Japan and North America. Manga and anime critics had praise for &quot;Black Cat&quot; action, differing views on the artwork and characters, and mainly negative comments for its plot which has been criticized for having typical elements of manga (targeted at boys).

== Plot ==

Set in a fictional universe, Train Heartnet, once an assassin for Chronos, an organization bent on world peace that rules one third of the world&#x27;s economy, is now an easygoing Sweeper (licensed bounty hunter) traveling with his partner Sven Vollfied. They meet and team up with professional thief Rinslet Walker in order to break into an arms dealer&#x27;s home and obtain some data, but encounter a human bio-weapon named Eve that was created using nanotechnology. Sven and Train ultimately decide to free Eve from her owner and train her to be a Sweeper. Rinslet is kidnapped by Creed Diskenth, a former Chronos assassin that killed Train&#x27;s friend Saya Minatsuki for changing Train&#x27;s outlook on life and which contributed to him leaving Chronos, to persuade Train to join his group the Apostles of the Stars in order to overthrow Chronos and start a world revolution. The duel ends as a draw, with both Creed and Train injured.

The Apostles of the Stars launch their first attack on the World Summit, killing the leaders from 20 top nations, causing Chronos to declare war on them. Chronos even notify Train of a new Sweeper bounty on Creed in order to gain his help, though he resists, planning to go after him on his own terms. Chronos assassin Jenos Hazard is sent to hire Rinslet to gather information on the Apostles, however, this is really in order to use her as bait to lure Creed out of hiding and force Train to get involved, who was lured to the same area via false Sweeper intel. Jenos and the other two members of the special unit Cerebus launch an assault on Creed&#x27;s lair, that results in it being turned to rubble, while Train simply rescues Rinslet and leaves. Creed then tries to kill Sven, believing he is holding Train back from joining him, but accidentally shoots Train with a nanomachine-enhanced bullet that has the unplanned effect of reverting his body to that of a child. In order to return Train to normal, Train, Sven and Eve visit nanotechnology expert Dr. Tearju, who is also Eve&#x27;s creator. While there, the Apostles of the Stars attack to force Tearju to join them in order to grant Creed eternal life through nanomachines, but are defeated by a returned Train who can now fire a railgun shot thanks to the nanomachines. However, Eathes was able to copy Tearju, gaining all of her knowledge, and Train, Sven and Eve finally decide to put a stop to Creed.

They team up with a group called the Sweeper Alliance to storm the Apostles of the Stars&#x27; island, organized by Chronos assassin Lin Shaolee in disguise to act as decoys for Chronos&#x27; own attack. Separated upon arriving, Train, Sven and Eve each get involved in fights with members of the Apostles, while Chronos, who landed after them, get to Creed first. Sephiria Arks faces off against Creed, but loses. Sven, Eve and Chronos then fight bio-warrior weapons fused with nanotechnology, while Train begins his battle with Creed. Creed has obtained immortality, although he reveals to Train his only weakness; his brain cannot be repaired like the rest of his body. Train defeats Creed using one last full-powered railgun shot to destroy his Imagine Blade and Eve uses her own nanomachines to take those that give Creed immortality out of his body. Train and Sephiria allow Creed to walk away, and the survivors of the Apostles of the Stars are shown on the run or hiding.

== Production ==
Six months before &quot;Black Cat&quot; began, Kentaro Yabuki&#x27;s one-shot version titled &quot;Stray Cat&quot; was published. While it already included Sweepers and Tao, Train and Sven were Delivery Men instead. With &quot;Black Cat&quot; he wanted to expand on ideas he used in his previous serial &quot;Yamato Gensoki&quot;; an assassin betraying an organization, and the use of or life energy. His weekly schedule was four days to write the chapter and two to draw it, taking one day off. When the manga ended serialization, Yabuki expressed desire to make a sequel labeling this series as &quot;Part 1&quot;. As he was not sure if there could be a sequel, he still remarked that the characters of Train Heartnet and Eve may appear in other titles he will create in the future.

=== Critical response ===
The manga has been praised for its fast-paced action, which &quot;epitomizes the action genre&quot;, according to Anime News Network&#x27;s Carlo Santos. Alexander Hoffman from Comics Village praised Yabuki for starting the story off with action rather than having a large amount of &quot;info-dumps&quot; for extensive character introductions. Writing for Manga Life, Michael Aronson commended it for having a restrained pace, layout and action scenes, calling it &quot;more western&quot; than Japanese because of it. Holly Ellingwood of Active Anime commented that &quot;Black Cat&quot; &quot;knows how to pack the action and the excitement to good effect, visuals and nail-biting suspense.&quot; Sheena McNeil stressed that despite its flaws the series&#x27; action &quot;makes it all worth reading.&quot; Ken Haley of Pop Culture Shock said that &quot;writing and characterization-wise&quot; it is a typical manga. Santos, Hoffman and McNeil criticized its plot for being &quot;predictable&quot;, clichéd, and &quot;not terribly original&quot; respectively. Leroy Douresseaux of Comic Book Bin called it &quot;an easy going version of &quot;Bleach&quot;&quot;, while Hoffman found it reminiscent of &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, and McNeil compared it to &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;.

Santos called its art &quot;plain&quot;, while McNeil commented that it &quot;is very nice&quot; but &quot;there&#x27;s nothing wow-ing about it,&quot; and likewise Haley considered the art enough to get &quot;the job done&quot;, but that none of the characters are &quot;cool or eye-catching&quot;. Conversely, Hoffman labeled the art &quot;expressive&quot;, and Douresseaux deemed the character designs &quot;imaginative.&quot; While Aronson and Hoffman dubbed the characters &quot;likeable&quot; and &quot;memorable,&quot; Douresseaux asserted Yabuki &quot;create[d] a joyful jumble of motivations and backstabbing&quot; for them. On the other hand, Santos affirmed they &quot;just don&#x27;t feel real&quot; as their motivations &quot;aren&#x27;t emotionally moving in any way; they&#x27;re just plot points that give the characters motivation.&quot;

The contrast between &quot;Train&#x27;s seriousness and Sven&#x27;s comedy&quot; was appreciated by Sandra Scholes of Active Anime. Margaret Viera of the same site hailed its comedy usage as &quot;well done and perfectly placed within the storyline.&quot; Its mixture of genres was appreciated by Scholes, as well as by IGN&#x27;s Jeff Harris who said &quot;it never appears too overdone.&quot; Ross Liversidge of UK Anime Network, however, commented that this makes it &quot;a little hard to discern what the series is aiming for.&quot; While Stig Høgset, writing for THEM Anime Reviews, said the supernatural powers are &quot;kept at a fairly realistic level&quot;, Liversidge felt the anime&#x27;s ending was &quot;just slightly too fantastical to be taken seriously.&quot; Høgset and Harris praised the show&#x27;s imagery, with the latter claiming that it has a &quot;story that in many ways improves on the original manga and fixes some of its problems.&quot;

<text>Power Rangers in Space is a television series and the sixth season of the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; franchise, based on the 21st Super Sentai series &quot;Denji Sentai Megaranger&quot;.

&quot;In Space&quot; was a turning point for the Power Rangers franchise, as the season brought closure to six seasons of plot, and it ended the practice of having regular cast members act in consecutive seasons - which had been in existence since 1993. The theme of this series, and its successor, the &quot;Power Rangers Lost Galaxy&quot;, bears little similarity to their Sentai counterparts. The sixth series also marked the final regular appearances of Tracy Lynn Cruz, Patricia Ja Lee, Roger Velasco, and Selwyn Ward, as well as the conclusion of Zordon&#x27;s story that has been significant in the previous six seasons.

==Plot==
Picking up where &quot;Power Rangers Turbo&quot; left off, Dark Specter has captured Zordon and is beginning to drain his powers. An assortment of old and new villains praise his victory, but an unexpected figure uncovers his plan: the Red Space Ranger, Andros. Dark Specter orders the Princess of Evil, Astronema, to eliminate Andros so he can&#x27;t jeopardize his plans.

Meanwhile, four of the former Turbo Rangers (T.J. Johnson, Carlos Vallerte, Ashley Hammond and Cassie Chan) and Alpha 6 are traveling in a NASADA space shuttle with the intent to save Zordon. They are pulled aboard the Astro Megaship and later encounter Andros. Though initially suspicious and dismissive of the four former Turbo Rangers, Andros realizes he&#x27;ll need their help to save Zordon and gives them each an Astro Morpher. Additionally, modifications allow the NASADA space shuttle and the Astro Megaship to combine into the powerful Astro Megazord. The new Space Rangers team then returns to Earth for repairs and supplies, but are followed by Astronema.

The Space Rangers alternate between searching for Zordon and protecting Earth. From the Dark Fortress, Astronema seeks to eliminate them via Ecliptor (who raised her), Quantrons and a variety of monsters. Elgar has also been added to her team, but he remains a comedic bungler. Over time, allies (such as the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the Phantom Ranger, Justin Stewart and Adam Park) offer the Rangers invaluable aid, with Zhane (the Silver Space Ranger) emerging from cryo-sleep and joining the team. New Zords are also introduced. Meanwhile, Bulk and Skull become assistants to wacky scientist Professor Phenomenus and join him in searching for aliens.

While dedicated to finding Zordon, Andros has another quest: finding his sister, Karone, who was kidnapped when they were children. Over time, Andros discovers his sister was kidnapped by Darkonda, the archrival of Ecliptor who has nine lives. To Andros&#x27; shock, he later discovers that Astronema is Karone, who was raised by Ecliptor to be evil. Andros is able to convince Astronema of the truth and she defects with Ecliptor&#x27;s help. Furious at this, Dark Specter launches a planet-destroying asteroid at Earth, which the Rangers are barely able to deflect, but Karone and Ecliptor are both recaptured and reprogrammed to follow Dark Specter in the process.

Astronema, now completely cold and calculating, now not only seeks to destroy the Space Rangers, but also Dark Specter and usurp his ruling power. To that end, she unleashes the Psycho Rangers. The five monstrous and borderline-insane villains possess great power, which secretly comes from Dark Specter, nearly draining him of his life force. Individually, each Psycho Ranger is too powerful for their Space Ranger equivalents. But the Psycho Rangers are not as good with teamwork and the six Space Rangers are able to overcome them with a great deal of effort and teamwork. Soon after, the Rangers suffer setbacks that see the Delta Megazord and The Mega Voyager destroyed.

The series culminates in the two-part finale, &quot;Countdown to Destruction&quot;, where Zordon is nearly completely drained and Dark Specter orders the villains under his command to attack the entire universe. Across the universe, the Alien and Phantom Rangers, Trey of Triforia, the Blue Senturion, and KO-35&#x27;s rebels are defeated and captured. The Space Rangers struggle to defend Earth, and are overwhelmed and forced to retreat. Darkonda kills Dark Specter, who returns the favor before his own death, leaving Astronema in command as the Queen of Evil. While Andros boards the Dark Fortress to appeal to his sister, the remaining five Space Rangers engage in one last fight for Earth and are joined by the citizens of Angel Grove, with Bulk and Skull leading the charge.

On the Dark Fortress, Andros finds Zordon, who requests his energy tube be shattered. Doing so will release good energy that will destroy the forces of evil and save the universe, but also kill him. Following battles with Astronema and Ecliptor, Andros has no choice but to comply. The many monsters are subsequently turned to dust by the energy wave (including Ecliptor), while Lord Zedd, Rita Repulsa, Divatox and Astronema are changed into normal, non-evil humans. With the universe now safe, T.J., Cassie, Carlos, Ashley and Alpha 6 intend to settle down on Earth. Though initially intending to remain on KO-35 with their people, Andros, Zhane and Karone decide to join their friends on Earth.

==Production==
Early production material for the season, dated May and August 1997 when production was concurrently underway for the Fall 1997 episodes of &quot;Power Rangers Turbo&quot;, was placed online in June 2011. The first half includes synopses of the first twenty-seven episodes of &quot;Megaranger&quot;, with a mix of Japanese names and intended US names, and a breakdown of how much footage was &quot;usable&quot;; there is a list of weaponry and Zords introduced, how often they appear, and the monsters and how they are destroyed. It then goes on to set out initial plans for the &quot;in Space&quot; adaptation.

Both Astronema and Andros are absent, with the Phantom Ranger uncovering Dark Specter&#x27;s plan instead, and Justin is identified as the Blue Ranger. Instead of losing their powers and base at the end of &quot;Turbo&quot;, the Rangers would be given their Space powers by Dimitria (the &quot;Turbo&quot; mentor) so they could head into space and save Zordon. Their spacecraft would have had a limited power supply and could only be recharged by the Power Chamber on Earth, forcing them to keep returning; otherwise, they would hop from planet to planet, encountering new and returning villains, and picking up clues for Zordon&#x27;s whereabouts. Divatox was still going to be the main recurring villain, with Ecliptor as her new second-in-command. Bulk and Skull formed a volunteer Citizen Force Group to try and protect Angel Grove while the Rangers were away.

&quot;In Space&quot; would have seen &quot;Carranger&quot; villain Exhaus used as Dark Specter - he would instead be the monster Goldgoyle for the end of &quot;Turbo&quot;. The Rangers were going to have a base in Earth orbit called the new Power Dome: it was to be realized by &quot;a giant pyramid made of silky material... the walls of silk will change constantly with special effects lights creating the different moods&quot;. The &quot;Space Station&quot; (Astro Megaship) interior was going to recycle as much of the Power Chamber set as possible; footage would be shot for the villain&#x27;s &quot;Evil Platform&quot; set ahead of time and used as recurring stock footage.

This would be the last season to feature the character Skull (Jason Narvy) as a main character as Narvy himself chose to leave the Power Rangers universe to continue his college education.

===Villains===
* Dark Specter &lt;br&gt; The &quot;Grand Monarch of Evil&quot;, who all other villains fear, Dark Specter appears as a gigantic lava-monster. He is the leader of the United Alliance of Evil. He was shown to have the ability to shape shift. Dark Specter was responsible for the fall of Eltar, he managed to capture Zordon and proceeded to slowly drain his powers throughout the season. He nearly met his end with the creation of the Psycho Rangers, who drew their energy from the evil monarch every time they fought. He was killed in the finale by Darkonda, who had stolen a Velocifighter armed with an experimental laser. With his dying breath, he devoured Darkonda before exploding. He is voiced by Christopher Grey.
* Astronema &lt;br&gt; The &quot;Princess of Evil&quot;, Astronema is a sinister and ruthless villainess who was groomed as a child in the ways of evil. There are hints she isn&#x27;t as evil as is led to believe, such as when she saves the lives of a family under attack by one of her own Quantrons. It is later discovered that she is Karone, sister of the Red Space Ranger Andros. She defected to the Rangers&#x27; side for a time, before being captured, brainwashed and given cybernetic implants which overwrote her emotions. As a result of this, her demeanor became cold, and even more ruthless and evil than before. She would later create the Psycho Rangers and link their powers directly to Dark Specter in an attempt to do away with the monarch and take power for herself. When Dark Specter is killed in the finale, she becomes the &quot;Queen of Evil&quot;, she is seemingly killed accidentally during a confrontation with Andros, but is revived by Andros&#x27; tears. In &quot;Power Rangers Beast Morphers&quot;, Astronema&#x27;s gauntlet was found in Ryjack&#x27;s collection of weapons. Astronema was Robo-Roxy&#x27;s choice to be revived into Evox&#x27;s army only for Robo-Blaze to comment that Astronema was purified much of Robo-Roxy&#x27;s disgust. She is portrayed by Melody Perkins.
* Ecliptor &lt;br&gt; A wire-frame model-themed robot who is Astronema&#x27;s guardian and surrogate father. He raised Astronema to be evil, caring for her like his own daughter. After Astronema learns her true identity, Ecliptor remained devoted to his princess, defending her against the attacks of his own forces. Branded a traitor, he is given additional cybernetics that suppress his better nature and make him purely evil. Upon seeing Astronema seemingly slain by her brother, Ecliptor broke free of his programming to get revenge. Despite his fatherly affection for Astronema, and his high regard for loyalty and honor, Ecliptor was killed by Zordon&#x27;s energy wave. He is voiced by Walter Lang.
* Elgar &lt;br&gt; Divatox&#x27;s idiotic, illiterate nephew. He was reassigned to the Dark Fortress by Dark Specter, mostly to allow Divatox to move Zordon around the universe without his bumbling threatening to ruin things. He is killed by Zordon&#x27;s energy wave. He is portrayed by Kenny Graceson and voiced by David Umansky.
* Darkonda &lt;br&gt; A bandaged bounty hunter who was responsible for kidnapping Karone as a child. Sadistic and treacherous, Darkonda was the arch rival to Ecliptor. He was given 9 lives, but managed to lose all but one though bungling or being defeated. He planned to kill Dark Specter with the missile intended for Earth&#x27;s destruction, but was swallowed by the evil monarch before he perished. He is voiced by Steve Kramer.
* Darkliptor &lt;br&gt; An entity which is created when Darkonda forcibly absorbs Ecliptor into himself, thereby adding all of Ecliptor&#x27;s powers and some of Ecliptor&#x27;s physical being to Darkonda&#x27;s own. When Darkliptor exists, Darkonda&#x27;s personality is dominant, and with Ecliptor&#x27;s powers on top of Darkonda&#x27;s, Darkliptor is near invincible. Ecliptor constantly tries to free himself from Darkliptor, and always succeeds eventually, to Darkonda&#x27;s annoyance. He is voiced by Steve Kramer.
* Quantrons &lt;br&gt; Astronema&#x27;s foot soldiers. Appearing as silver robots with blades as their primary weapons. Like the Cogs before them, they pilot vehicles for attacks. The Quantrons are the fourth group of foot soldiers created for Power Rangers and don&#x27;t have a Sentai counterpart.
* Craterites &lt;br&gt; Foot soldiers from the Astro Megaship simudeck&#x27;s training program. A lightning bolt once hit the Megaship while T.J. And Ashley were doing a session, causing them to become real and hide among the people in Angel Grove by disguising themselves as humans.

<text>Captain Planet and the Planeteers, commonly referred to as simply Captain Planet, is an American animated environmentalist superhero television series created by Barbara Pyle and Ted Turner and developed by Pyle, Nicholas Boxer, Thom Beers, Andy Heyward, Robby London, Bob Forward, and Cassandra Schafausen. The series was produced by Turner Program Services and DIC Enterprises and broadcast on TBS and in syndication from September 15, 1990, to December 5, 1992.

A sequel series, The New Adventures of Captain Planet, was produced by Hanna-Barbera Cartoons, Inc., distributed by Turner Program Services and broadcast from September 11, 1993, to May 11, 1996. The series was later rerun on Kids&#x27; WB!, Cartoon Network and Boomerang. It is currently on the MeTV Toons schedule. The series is a form of edutainment that advocates for environmentalism and is known for having several famous actors voice the villains. It spawned a franchise consisting of eco-friendly toys, comic books, video games, and a public charity to further promote its work.

==Plot==
Each episode is followed by at least one &quot;Planeteer Alert&quot; clip, often connected to the plot, which discusses environmental-political and social-political issues and how the viewer can contribute and be part of &quot;the solution&quot; rather than &quot;the pollution&quot;.

==Characters==
===Gaia===
Gaia (voiced by Whoopi Goldberg in seasons 1–3, Margot Kidder in seasons 4–6) is the spirit of Earth, whose physical manifestation is that of a dark-skinned woman. She sends five magic rings to five chosen youths from around the world. Four of the rings have the power to control an element of nature (earth, fire, wind, and water), and one controls the element of Heart. Gaia claims to have been asleep throughout the 20th century and to have awakened to a more polluted world than when she was last awake; however, this is contradicted by a flashback episode set in the 1920s in which people receive guidance from her.

===Captain Planet===
In situations that the Planeteers cannot resolve alone, they can combine their planetary powers to summon the titular Captain Planet (voiced by David Coburn), who is Ma-Ti&#x27;s magnified heart power in the form of a male superhero avatar with blue skin and green hair. He possesses the Planeteers&#x27; amplified powers, along with typical superhero powers such as flight and superhuman strength. Once his work is done, Captain Planet returns to the planet and leaves viewers with the message: &quot;The power is yours!&quot; While he usually manifests to deal with a crisis before leaving, some episodes explore him existing beyond this. For example, in the episode &quot;Greenhouse Planet&quot;, he is summoned while Kwame and Ma-Ti are in space, preventing the energy from their rings from returning to its source and depowering him to a human level.
Captain Planet&#x27;s weaknesses are pollution and smog. When he comes in contact with pollution and smog, his powers are weakened and he has to return to the earth to recover.

===Planeteers===

The Planeteers are a group chosen by Gaia to protect the planet from environmental disasters and to educate humanity to prevent further disasters. Gaia uses her &quot;Planet Vision&quot; in the Crystal Chamber to discover where destruction is occurring, which is usually caused by the Eco-Villains, and sends the Planeteers to help solve the problem. The Planeteers use solar-powered transportation, usually the Geo-Cruiser, to avoid causing pollution themselves.

* Kwame (voiced by LeVar Burton) – From Africa, Kwame has the power of earth.
* Wheeler (voiced by Joey Dedio) – From Brooklyn, New York City, United States, Wheeler has the power of fire.
* Linka (voiced by Kath Soucie) – From the Soviet Union (Seasons 1–2), from Eastern Europe (location change occurred due to dissolution of the Soviet Union) (Seasons 3–6), Linka has the power of wind.
* Gi (voiced by Janice Kawaye) – From Asia, Gi has the power of water. 
* Ma-Ti (voiced by Scott Menville) – From Brazil, Ma-Ti has the power of heart. He has a pet spider monkey, Suchi (vocal effects provided by Frank Welker).

===Villains===
====Eco-Villains====

The Eco-Villains are a group of antagonists, each representing a particular way of thinking that can cause ecological problems. They endanger the planet through pollution, deforestation, poaching, and other activities that harm the environment in order to gain wealth, land, or power. While they usually work alone, they are willing to work together when it suits their plans. The only time they work as a team is in &quot;Summit to Save Earth&quot;, where they are led by Zarm. 

* Hoggish Greedly (voiced by Ed Asner) – A pig-like human who represents the dangers of overconsumption and greed and is the first villain that Captain Planet and the Planeteers encounter. &quot;Smog Hog&quot; reveals that he has a son, Hoggish Greedly Jr. (voiced by Charlie Schlatter), who is negatively affected by his polluting Road Hog plot. As a result, Greedly is forced to work with Captain Planet to save him. &quot;Hog Tide&quot; reveals that his grandfather, Don Porkaloin (also voiced by Asner), was defeated by another group of Planeteers in the past and later became environmentally friendly, as shown in &quot;The Ghost of Porkaloin Past&quot;.
** Rigger (voiced by John Ratzenberger) – Greedly&#x27;s main henchman, who in &quot;The Ghost of Porkaloin Past&quot; claims that the main reason he works for him is because no one would hire him. Though he sometimes questions Greedly&#x27;s orders and is concerned when his actions hurt the environment, he remains loyal to him.
* Verminous Skumm (voiced by Jeff Goldblum in season 1, Maurice LaMarche in season 2–5) – A rat-like human who represents urban blight, disease, and drug abuse. He can control rats and has a personal helicopter called The Scum O&#x27;Copter.
** Rat Pack – A group of humanoid rats who work for Skumm.
* Duke Nukem (voiced by Dean Stockwell in seasons 1–3, Maurice LaMarche in seasons 4–5) – A doctor who transformed himself into a radioactive rock-skinned mutant and represents the misuse of nuclear power. Along with Zarm and Captain Pollution, he is one of the few Eco-Villains who can fight Captain Planet one-on-one. He generates radiation, which he can use to fire radioactive blasts from his hands, and possesses x-ray vision. Apogee temporarily renamed the eponymous character of Duke Nukem to &quot;Duke Nukum&quot; to avoid possible trademark claims from the producers of &quot;Captain Planet&quot;. However, the character was later found to be under no trademark and the games were restored to their original titles.
** Leadsuit (voiced by Frank Welker) – Duke Nukem&#x27;s henchman, who wears a full-bodied lead hazmat suit to withstand the radiation released by his body. He claims that he works for Nukem because he will become second-in-command when he takes over the world.
* Dr. Barbara &quot;Babs&quot; Blight (voiced by Meg Ryan in 1990–1991, Mary Kay Bergman in 1992–1996, Tessa Auberjonois in &quot;OK K.O.! Let&#x27;s Be Heroes&quot;) – A mad scientist who represents the dangers of uncontrolled technology and unethical scientific experimentation. As a result of self-experimentation, the left side of her face is scarred and is usually hidden by her hair. &quot;Hog Tide&quot; reveals that her grandmother, Betty Blight, assisted Don Porkaloin in the past. &quot;Hollywaste&quot; reveals that she has a sister named Bambi (voiced by Kath Soucie). 
** MAL (voiced by David Rappaport in 1990, Tim Curry in 1991–1996) – Dr. Blight&#x27;s A.I. husband and henchman. He has the ability to hack into other computer systems, allowing him to take them over and reprogram them. He is often the control and main power source for everything in Blight&#x27;s labs and the vehicles she travels in.
* Looten Plunder (voiced by James Coburn in seasons 1–3, Ed Gilbert in seasons 4–6) – A wealthy poacher and corrupt businessman who represents the evils of unethical business actions. He is also shown to have a nephew named Robin Plunder. Notably, he is the only Eco-Villain to succeed in his schemes, as in &quot;Whoo Gives a Hoot&quot;, the Planeteers fail to prove to a judge that Plunder was illegally cutting down trees in an old-growth forest and the judge learns of his trickery too late. 
** Argos Bleak (voiced by S. Scott Bullock) – Looten Plunder&#x27;s main henchman and bodyguard, who also works as a mercenary and does most of his dirty work. He usually travels in helicopters or other aircraft and is proficient in handling firearms.
** Pinehead Brothers (voiced by Dick Gautier and Frank Welker) – Lumberjacks who serve as Looten Plunder&#x27;s henchmen in the sixth season.
* Sly Sludge (voiced by Martin Sheen in Seasons 1–3, Jim Cummings in Seasons 4–5) – An unscrupulous waste collector who represents laziness, ignorance, and the dangers of apathy and short-term thinking. However, since many of his schemes involve waste management, which is a legitimate environmental issue, he often exploits this to gain apparent respectability. He is the only main villain to defect to the Planeteers after his recycling program makes him money by the end of &quot;No Small Problem&quot;. The money allows him to propose plans to mass-produce an affordable, environmentally friendly way to safely dispose of waste.
** Ooze (voiced by Cam Clarke) – Sludge&#x27;s henchman, who is often underpaid and works for him because he has no other option. Like Rigger, Ooze does most of his heavy work.
** Tank Flusher III (voiced by Frank Welker) – Sludge&#x27;s strongman servant, who debuts in &quot;A Mine Is a Terrible Thing to Waste Part One&quot;, where he answers an ad for &quot;A heinous henchman to serve a Machiavellian master&quot; despite not knowing what it means.
* Zarm (voiced by Sting in 1990–1992, David Warner in 1992, Malcolm McDowell in 1993–1995) – A former spirit of the earth who left Gaia in search of other worlds and ended up destroying several planets, lacking Gaia to balance out his methods. He represents war and . While lacking henchmen, he often manipulates others to do his bidding, such as in &quot;Summit to Save Earth&quot;, where he unites the Eco-Villains under his leadership. In addition to war and destruction, Zarm also promotes hatred and totalitarianism, which he believes are the most dangerous pollutants to humanity, as evidenced by his role as kingmaker to the dictator Morgar. He also tells the Planeteers that he has been the guiding force behind every despot of the 20th century.

====Captain Pollution====
Captain Pollution (voiced by David Coburn) is an evil counterpart to Captain Planet who appears in the two-part episode &quot;Mission to Save Earth&quot;. Dr. Blight steals the Planeteers&#x27; rings and creates polluting duplicates of them with the opposite power of the Planeteers, which she gives to most of the Eco-Villains.

* Duke Nukem has a Super Radiation Ring (counterpart of Fire).
* Looten Plunder has a Deforestation Ring (counterpart of Earth).
* Sly Sludge has a Smog Ring (counterpart of Wind).
* Verminous Skumm has a Toxic Ring (counterpart of Water).
* Dr. Blight has a Hate Ring (counterpart of Heart).

Captain Pollution resembles Captain Planet, but has pale yellow skin covered with brown lesions and red hair and eyes, and wears a costume similar to his, except that the globe on his chest is torn in the middle. Captain Pollution is Captain Planet&#x27;s polar opposite in personality, as he is arrogant and sees himself as a god and his creators as servants rather than partners, which Captain Planet says is his downfall. Captain Pollution is weakened by contact with pure elements, such as clean water or sunlight, and gains power from contact with pollutants, being able to absorb pollutants and emit radioactive rays. When he is summoned, he says &quot;By your polluting powers combined, I am Captain Pollution!!&quot;, and when he disappears, he states &quot;The polluting power is yours!&quot;

In his first appearance, he is sent by the Eco-Villains to destroy the Planeteers, but is chased off by Commander Clash, and after a fight with Captain Planet, he returns to the evil rings, causing them to explode. In &quot;A Mine is a Terrible Thing to Waste&quot;, he is brought back to life by the toxins of the five evil rings, which seep into the planet, but is defeated again and destroyed by Captain Planet.

===Other villains===
* The Slaughters – A family of poachers who debut in &quot;The New Adventures of Captain Planet&quot; and represent the endangerment of animals and the evils of poaching. While they are often in direct monetary competition with Looten Plunder, they work with him and Argos Bleak in &quot;Horns A&#x27;Plenty&quot;.
** Mame Slaughter (voiced by Theresa Saldana in the first appearance, Mitzi McCall in the second appearance) – The leader of the Slaughters.
** Stalker Slaughter (voiced by Charlie Adler) – One of Mame&#x27;s sons and her second-in-command.

==Episodes==
==Development==
===Conception===
According to Barbara Pyle, the inspiration for the five Planeteers came from real people that she met during the show&#x27;s pre-production in 1989. Gi was inspired by Malaysian environmental activist Chee Yoke Ling of Sahabat Alam Malaysia, while Ma-Ti was inspired by Paulinho Paiakan. She also stated that Wheeler was based on her father, and made him to be environmentally unaware based on the view she had of the attitudes displayed by the United States at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit. Kwame was inspired by the survivors of the Rhodesian Bush War. In a September 2012 interview with Barbara Pyle and co-developer Nicholas Boxer, it was stated that Hope Island was located near the Bahamas.

===DIC history (1990–1992)===
The original series, produced by TBS Productions and DiC, was the second longest running US-cartoon of the 1990s, with three seasons and 113 episodes under the name &quot;Captain Planet and the Planeteers&quot;.

The show&#x27;s theme song was composed by Tom Worrall, with lyrics written by show producer Nick Boxer, and performed by Murray McFadden and Timothy Mulhollan.

===Hanna-Barbera history (1993–1996)===
In 1993, the show saw a production company switch, changing the title to The New Adventures of Captain Planet (produced by Hanna-Barbera Cartoons, which was acquired by Turner in 1991). During this time, it aired as part of TBS&#x27; &quot; Sunday Morning in Front Of The TV &quot; block, alongside fellow H-B toons &quot;SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron&quot; and &quot;2 Stupid Dogs&quot;. This series revealed more of the past of each of the characters and expanded on it dramatically. The tone of these episodes was more mature than the initial series. The animation style was altered, being of considerably higher quality than the DiC seasons.

The DiC seasons&#x27; synth-rock soundtrack was replaced by a large number of orchestral pieces, and while the end credits theme was retained, the ending sequence now showcased footage from the Hanna-Barbera episodes. Full-time voice actors replaced most of the major celebrities that had voiced Gaia and the Eco-Villains during the DiC seasons. The opening narration was spoken by David Coburn (Captain Planet) rather than LeVar Burton (Kwame) and, in the final season, was replaced by a rap by Fred Schneider of The B-52&#x27;s.

===Legacy===
The &quot;Captain Planet Foundation (CPF)&quot; was founded in 1991, when series producer Barbara Pyle negotiated a percentage of the show&#x27;s merchandising revenue to empower young people. The concept allowed schools and organizations around the world to present their environmental projects to the Foundation and receive seed money to grow their ideas. In 2001, Time Warner decided to shut down the CPF due to a challenging merger with AOL. Laura Seydel and her husband Rutherford Seydel worked with Time Warner to orchestrate the transition of the corporate foundation to a public charity – the Captain Planet Foundation. In 2007, CPF acquired the rights to exhibit previous episodes of Captain Planet and the Planeteers online and on-air, thus &quot;allowing this valuable resource to reach out and educate the children of today!&quot; , the organization&#x27;s board is chaired by Laura Turner Seydel, daughter of Ted Turner; the board includes Barbara Pyle.

== Reception ==

In 1990, &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; described the show as having &quot;not much originality&quot;, although also saying that &quot;there&#x27;s a passion behind this series, which adapts a conventional super-hero formula to an unconventional theme&quot;, also stating that the celebrities voicing the series &quot;also sets the series apart&quot;. The newspaper also described the show as being part of &quot;the increased awareness of Earth as endangered&quot;. L. Brent Bozell III, a conservative activist, accused the show of &quot;seeking to scare children into political activism&quot;, along with accusing the show of having &quot;leftist slants&quot;; Barbara Pyle responded, saying &quot;I don&#x27;t think &#x27;Captain Planet&#x27; is scary ... it shows kids that every action counts ... I consider [environmental issues] bipartisan.&quot;

Diane Holloway from &quot;Austin American-Statesman&quot; wrote, &quot;The animation is crude and jerky, but the messages are important and clear enough for a 4-year old to understand&quot;, while Rebecca Coudret from Evansville Courier &amp; Press said she &quot;wondered if [children] were simply responding to the basic good vs. evil clash.&quot; In 1993, the episode &quot;Dream Machine&quot; won an award at the Environmental Media Awards, and in 1994, the episode &quot;Gorillas Will Be Missed&quot; likewise did. Reviewing season one in 2012, &quot;IGN&quot; gave the show a rating of 5 out of 10, describing the animation as &quot;pretty weak&quot; and the stories as &quot;too hokey&quot;.

==Educational goals==
Various episodes were constructed to touch on relevant themes to a modern audience:

* &quot;Mind Pollution&quot;
The episode titled &quot;Mind Pollution&quot; (1991) was notable for dealing with the issue of drug abuse. This was explained by the fact that the characters thought of drug addiction as &quot;pollution of the mind&quot;. The episode revolved around an epidemic of a designer drug known as &quot;Bliss&quot; created by Verminous Skumm. It included a scene of Linka&#x27;s cousin Boris jumping through a window and dying from a drug overdose.

* &quot;Population Bomb&quot;
&quot;Population Bomb&quot; (1991) continued the trend of tackling controversial subject matter atypical for a children&#x27;s cartoon, in this instance the problem with overpopulation. Using mice as substitutes for humans, the episode sets Wheeler on a &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; style adventure where he encounters a tribe of sentient mice who are destroyed by overpopulation and irresponsible leadership. It turns out that the ordeal is something that Wheeler dreamed up, though it serves as a warning for the audience about sustainability and over-consumption.

* &quot;A Formula for Hate&quot;
The episode titled &quot;A Formula for Hate&quot; (1992) was also unusual for the series in that it was the first episode in an American children&#x27;s animated series to directly deal with the HIV/AIDS pandemic. In the episode, Skumm and one of his rat henchmen brainwashes a local community into thinking the virus can be spread through casual contact and thus causing people to hate and fear a young man, infected with HIV, named Todd Andrews (voiced by Neil Patrick Harris, with his mother voiced by Elizabeth Taylor). Captain Planet tells the truth about AIDS to the entire basketball team with help from Todd&#x27;s coach. Then Captain Planet catches Skumm and his rat henchman and handed them over to the police.

==Franchise extension==
Pyle and Boxer demanded that the series&#x27; merchandise be made sustainably; because of this, several of the companies producing &quot;Captain Planet&quot;-themed merchandise had to completely overhaul their means of production to manufacture recycled and recyclable products.

===Toys===
As with many popular cartoons, &quot;Captain Planet&quot; had a line of action figures and vehicles. Released by Tiger Toys in 1990, the line ran for several years, long enough to tie into the &quot;New Adventures&quot; series. The toys were repackaged and sold by Grand Toys in Canada and Kenner throughout Europe. The toys were of average poseability, with the common five points – neck, shoulders, and hips.

Finding a comprehensive list of what was released is difficult, since not all toys shown in the initial retailer catalog were even released. The collector&#x27;s market is small, the toys being somewhat rare on eBay. The Captain Planet Foundation still sells a small number of them online, however. There may have also been further foreign variations of certain toys which may be even more difficult to catalog. Various toys from the &quot;New Adventures&quot; waves are not as likely to be well known.

The five Planeteers, five Eco-Villains, Commander Clash, and several versions of Captain Planet, each with a different gimmick or paint scheme, were released, along with several vehicles. A toy ring with lights and sound and interchangeable lenses for the five elements was also released. Four small vehicles were also sold through a Burger King promotion.

===Video games===
A video game based on the series was developed for the Nintendo Entertainment System by Mindscape called &quot;Captain Planet&quot;. The game, which involved a good deal of shooting, received negative reviews from game critics and thus a Sega Mega Drive (Genesis) version of the game was cancelled. A separate side-scrolling game was developed by Novalogic for the Mega Drive/Genesis, but only saw release in Europe and Australia.

David Perry and Nick Bruty developed a ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC game using the license, a 3-level shoot &#x27;em up. A game was also released in 1990 for the Amiga and Atari ST, written by Tony Crowther. This was a platform game and was briefly bundled with the Amiga 500 &quot;Cartoon Classics&quot; pack released in 1991. A Commodore 64 game was in development but never released. Tiger Toys, owners of the action figure license, also created an LCD hand-held game.

Captain Planet appears as a playable character in the fighting game &quot;Cartoon Network: Punch Time Explosion&quot; for Nintendo 3DS, Wii, PS3, and Xbox 360.

===Home media===
Turner Home Entertainment originally released VHS tapes of the series, which contained a single episode on each. DIC&#x27;s main home video distributor Buena Vista Home Video would also release single-episode VHS releases as well.

A DVD with four episodes and bonus features exists but was only available as part of a &quot;Planeteer Pack&quot; purchased from the Captain Planet Foundation.
This promotional DVD contained the episodes &quot;A River Ran Through It&quot;, &quot;A Perfect World&quot;, &quot;Gorillas Will Be Missed&quot;, and &quot;The Big Clam Up&quot;. A short clip titled &quot;Planeteers in Action&quot;, which is about the Captain Planet Foundation, is also included. The &quot;Planeteer Pack&quot; special is no longer available.

Shout! Factory under license from Turner and Warner Home Video released a DVD set of the complete first season in the U.S. on April 19, 2011. The DVD packaging is made of 100% recycled paper.

Madman Entertainment released the first season on July 6, 2016 and the complete collection on October 25, 2017 in Australia.

As of March 25, 2017, it is available on iTunes for purchase. The whole series was made available on Amazon Instant Video.

On October 15, 2024, Warner Bros. Discovery Home Entertainment (through Studio Distribution Services) has released the complete series on a DVD box set, featuring all 113 episodes from both the DIC and Hanna-Barbera seasons. Not only does this reissue the first season, but this marks the first time that the remaining five seasons are released to DVD in the United States.

===Film===
Multiple attempts have been made to create a film adaptation of the series. The first occurred in 1996 when Boxer and Pyle wrote a film adaptation of &quot;Captain Planet&quot; originally titled &quot;Planet&quot;. Five years later, Michael Reaves revised the concept as &quot;Dark Planet&quot; or &quot;Planet&quot;. The storyline was darker than the series, and set in a post-apocalyptic time period. However, the script was lost when Turner and Warner Bros. merged in 1996. The film reached the design stage before it was abandoned.

Other attempts at a film version were made in 2007, 2011, and 2013, but none of these versions came to pass. In October 2016 Paramount Pictures and Leonardo DiCaprio&#x27;s Appian Way were attempting to develop a new movie and is in negotiations with Jono Matt and Glen Powell to write the script, with Powell to star as the titular character. The status of the project is unclear since there were no further news of film adaptation. In early 2023, Powell claimed that hurdles at Warner Bros. Discovery would need to be cleared before moving forward.

===Comic books===
Marvel Comics published a comic series titled &quot;Captain Planet and the Planeteers&quot;. The series ran twelve issues, cover dated October 1991 through October 1992. There will be a new comic series by Dynamite and will be released on Earth Day.

===&quot;OK K.O.!&quot; crossover===
In 2017, Captain Planet appeared in a special crossover episode of the Cartoon Network series &quot;OK K.O.! Let&#x27;s Be Heroes&quot;, with David Coburn reprising his role as Captain Planet and LeVar Burton reprising his role as Kwame. The heroes battled Dr. Blight (accompanied by a silent MAL). The episode &quot;The Power Is Yours&quot; aired on October 9, 2017, as part of the first season.

<doc id="492220" wikidata="Q2097697" url="?curid=492220" title="Power Rangers Lost Galaxy">
<text>Power Rangers Lost Galaxy is a tokusatsu television series and the seventh season of the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; franchise, based on the 22nd Super Sentai series &quot;Seijuu Sentai Gingaman&quot;. The series was the first to follow the Sentai tradition of a new cast with each new series.

Kendrix Morgan (Valerie Vernon), the first Pink Galaxy Ranger for this series, was briefly killed off two-thirds through the season, marking the first time that a Ranger was killed off in the series. Kendrix was written out of the show as Vernon had temporarily departed to seek treatment for leukemia. Her treatment was successful and she returned for the season finale.

==Synopsis==
Brothers Leo and Mike Corbett, Kai Chen and Kendrix Morgan are leaving for the space colony Terra Venture seeking a new world like Earth. They later meet mechanic Damon Henderson, and on the Moon, a tribesgirl named Maya who leads them to the Quasar Sabers, five mystical swords on her home planet of Mirinoi. After pulling the blades out of a stone, Mike falls into a crevice, but not before passing his Sword onto Leo.

With the Quasar Sabers, they morph into Galaxy Power Rangers and battle space villains from two different parts of the galaxy who include Scorpius, Trakeena, Deviot and Captain Mutiny. Along the way, they discover Galactabeasts (which eventually gain the power to morph whenever needed into Galactazords) and ally with the mysterious galactic warrior Magna Defender. Though he later dies, he manages to reveal that his host body is Mike and passes the Magna Defender powers to him.

When Deviot revives the evil Psycho Rangers, the Rangers of &quot;Power Rangers in Space&quot; show up to aid the Galaxy Rangers in destroying them. During this saga, Kendrix, the Pink Ranger, sacrifices herself to protect the Pink Space Ranger and Terra Venture from Psycho Pink. Karone, sister of the Red Space Ranger Andros and former evil princess Astronema, is given the powers of the Pink Ranger from Kendrix (who appears as a spirit), and joins the Rangers in the battle to protect Terra Venture.

Deviot later reads secret words from the Galaxy Book; sending Terra Venture and himself into the &quot;Lost Galaxy&quot;. Here the Rangers encounter Captain Mutiny and his Swabbies. These space traveling pirates live on the back of a massive space faring dragon inside a castle. Deviot reemerges and joins the Captain&#x27;s fight against the Rangers and attempts to turn all of the citizens of Terra Venture into his slaves for the purposes of mining for &quot;Earth&quot;. The colony escapes the galaxy after Mike sacrifices his powers to keep a portal open.

After this, Deviot returns to Trakeena, but by this time, she has learned of his treachery and tries to destroy him. She chases him through the ship and into the cocoon that Scorpius made, fusing them together and driving Trakeena insane. Using her army armed with bombs, she cripples Terra Venture and destroys the Stratoforce and Centaurus Megazords. This forces the colony&#x27;s people to evacuate to a nearby planet. Trakeena gives chase but the Rangers destroy her ship by self-destructing the Astro Megaship, but the explosion leaves Leo stranded on the moon. Trakeena, who survives the blast also, albeit scarred and injured, finally reaches her breaking point and uses the cocoon to transform into an insectoid creature to enter Terra Venture&#x27;s wreck and use her power to set it on a crash course to the planet below to destroy it and the people. Leo enters and soon followed by the other Rangers try to stop her, but are slowly outmatched by Trakeena&#x27;s new power. She is only defeated after Leo, using his Battlizer, blasts her at point-blank range nearly destroying himself in the process. By this time the colony is nearly crashed but the Galaxy Megazord diverts its course and lands it on a large clearing in an explosion, the colonists, having feared the worse for the Rangers, are relieved and overjoyed when they come out of the explosion on the Galactabeasts. After this, the Zords reveal to the Rangers they had landed on Mirinoi and return the swords to the stone altar. This restores its petrified inhabits and, to the joy of the Rangers, restores Kendrix to life as well. After this the colonists settle on Mirinoi as the series ends.

They are then allowed to flutter in the wind. They are also known as .

Children&#x27;s Day takes place on May 5, the last day of Golden Week, the largest break for workers and also a week in which many businesses, state schools, and some private schools close for up to 9–10 days for the designated national holidays. Landscapes across Japan are decorated with from April to early May, in honor of children for a good future and in the hope that they will grow up healthy and strong.

==Description==
A typical set consists of, from the top of the pole down, a pair of with a ball-shaped spinning vane, a mounting , and finally the . For the windsock above the , two main kinds are used: the , based on the five elements of Chinese philosophy, and , often featuring a . The number and meaning of the carp streamers or that fly beneath the windsock has changed over time. Traditionally, the set would contain a black representing the father, followed by a smaller, red representing his eldest son. This is why, according to the Japanese American National Museum, in the traditional &quot;children&#x27;s song,&quot; the red one () represents the eldest son. If more boys were in the household, an additional blue, green, and then, depending on the region, either purple or orange were added. After the government&#x27;s decree that converted into the present , the holiday came to celebrate the happiness of both boys and girls. As a result, the red came to represent the mother of the family and it is not uncommon for the color to be varied as pink. Similarly, the other colors and sizes of carp came to represent all the family&#x27;s children, both sons and daughters.

At present, the are commonly flown above the roofs of houses with children, with the biggest (black) for the father, next biggest (red or pink) for the mother, and additional smaller carps of a different color for each child in decreasing order by age.

 range from a few centimetres to a few metres long. In 1988, a long weighing was made in Kazo, Saitama.

==History==

During the Edo period (1603–1867), samurai households began to decorate their yards with or flags, which were colored with (family crests) to represent military units, during . The and were then merged, and the first appeared in Edo (now Tokyo). The colorful as they are modernly known became popular in the Meiji era (1868–1912).
Though originally exclusive to samurai households, they eventually reached the rest of the population. They were traditionally flown as part of the Japanese Boys&#x27; Day, with one carp for each son, while girls found a counterpart to this custom in &#x27;Doll&#x27;s Day&#x27;. However, after the redesignation of May 5th as Children&#x27;s Day in 1948, some families began flying koi for every child, regardless of gender. Despite this, the connection between the and male children remains, and many families still do not fly them for their daughters. The koi, known for its ability to swim upstream, represents courage, determination, and the hope that children will grow up healthily. This symbolism pays homage to the myth of longmen from the late Han dynasty, that a golden koi fish swam up a waterfall at the end of the Yellow River and became a dragon.

The number of included on a pole and the variety of their colors have increased over time to accommodate more family members. They were originally made by hand-painting materials such as paper or cloth, but these have almost entirely fallen out of use in favour of synthetics, outside of some rural areas. Silk and paper models are still sold, but at a higher price than the synthetics. 

Related traditions include kite-flying, kite-fighting, the display of samurai dolls and miniature Japanese armor and in the home, the bathing with iris in the bathtub, the consumption of Kashiwa mochi (sticky rice cakes wrapped in oak leaves) and , and, in some areas, the tradition of making young boys crawl through the for good fortune. As a tradition, throughout Children&#x27;s Day, children also thank and show respect for relatives, parents, and teachers for support throughout their life.

<text>Nepean High School (often abbreviated to NHS) is a high school in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It is located in the Westboro neighbourhood, at 574 Broadview Avenue. There were 1160 students enrolled for 2011–2012. Alan Johnson is the current principal replacing Kristy MacNamara, the principal from 2018 to 2019. The two current vice principals are Christy Armstrong and Peter Campbell.

==History==
The school began as a continuation program at Broadview Public School. Students who wanted some years of secondary education, but were unable to travel to Ottawa Collegiate Institute could take a few courses on the top floor of Broadview. In 1919, the provincial government made school attendance mandatory until age 16, creating a rapid increase in enrollment. Carleton County thus decided to build a new high school, and Nepean High School, in Nepean Township, was founded in 1922. Nepean High School originally served a large territory west of Ottawa. In 1950, Westboro was annexed by the city of Ottawa, and the high school became part of the Ottawa Collegiate Board. In 1970, the Ottawa Collegiate Board was merged into the Ottawa Board of Education, and then in 1998, the Ottawa Board of Education and the Carleton Board of Education were amalgamated. Nepean High School then became part of the new Ottawa-Carleton District School Board.

==Academics==
Nepean is known for its strong academic success with roughly 94% of students graduating to higher education (53% being Ontario Scholars).

Nepean&#x27;s curricular offerings include
Academic/University,
Applied/College,
French Immersion,
Extended French,
Specialist High Skills Major in the Environment,
Advanced Placement Courses,
Leadership Development, and
Cooperative Education courses.

==Athletics==
The school is also well known for its excellent athletics program, with over 10 sports teams that are regular top contenders in the National Capital Secondary Schools Athletic Association. 

Nepean boasts one of the highest number of interscholastic sports teams in the Ottawa Carleton District School Board. Nepean was ranked first overall in the inaugural Ottawa Citizen High School Sports Rankings in 2006, and placed 3rd in 2009, 5th in 2010, and 3rd in 2011. Nepean attended the Ontario Championships (OFSAA) in boys Rugby (2015, 2016), boys Soccer (2007), girls Soccer (2010), X-Country (2006–2011), Golf (2007–2011), Alpine Skiing (2007–2011), Nordic Skiing (2006–2011), Track &amp; Field (2006–2011), Field Hockey (2011, 2015, 2016), Tennis (2010–2011), and Swimming (2008–2011). The boys Non-Contact Hockey won city championships in 2004, 2006, 2007 and 2008, the Junior Boys Basketball Team won the city championships in 2019 and the boys Rugby team has toured worldwide (Alberta 2004, UK 2005, and Australia 2007, 2009, 2012).

<doc id="492226" wikidata="Q2034861" url="?curid=492226" title="Power Rangers Dino Thunder">
<text>Power Rangers Dino Thunder is the twelfth season of the television series, &quot;Power Rangers&quot;.
This incarnation of &quot;Power Rangers&quot; was based on &quot;Bakuryū Sentai Abaranger&quot;, the 27th entry of Toei Company&#x27;s long-running &quot;Super Sentai&quot; franchise. &quot;Dino Thunder&quot; was also the subtitle of the Korean dub of &quot;Abaranger&quot; in South Korea and had a similar/identical logo to the American version as well.
The series is notable as it features the return of Jason David Frank as Tommy Oliver as a main character and a dinosaur theme for the powers, abilities and assets from most of the series&#x27; protagonists and antagonists. It was the first series to be aired on ABC Family part of ABC as well as part of Jetix on Toon Disney.

==Plot==
A soccer player, a computer expert, a singer and eventually a teacher with a long history of such situations become Power Rangers to help save Earth from the ruthless scheming of the dinosauric Mesogog who wishes to eradicate all human life and return Earth to the age of dinosaurs. Mesogog is assisted in his ways by Elsa, Zeltrax, and an army each of both Tyrannodrones and Triptoids as well as monsters that they call their Mutations.

In this season, Tommy Oliver, from &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; to &quot;Power Rangers Turbo&quot; fame, returns as a paleontology professor in Reefside, California and so he is known as Dr. Tommy Oliver (sometimes called by some in short as Dr. O). When he is assigned three detention students by Principal Randall (the human disguise of Elsa): athlete Conner McKnight, computer expert Ethan James and singer Kira Ford. They end up finding three Dino Gems - one for each teen, paving the way for their destiny as the Dino Thunder Power Rangers. Conner gains the powers of both the Tyrannozord and super running speed, Ethan gains the powers of both the Tricerazord and energy-formed skin-shield defense and Kira gains the powers of both the Pterazord and sonic screams.

Five episodes into the series, Tommy once again becomes a Ranger by bonding with the Black Dino Gem and receives its power of invisibility as the Black Dino Ranger. They are also later joined by Anton Mercer&#x27;s adopted son Trent (some media reveals his family name, after &#x27;Mercer&#x27;, to be &#x27;Fernandez&#x27; - &#x27;Fernandez-Mercer&#x27;) as the White Dino Ranger, whose White Dino Gem grants him the power of camouflage - before he joins, he must deal with the inner struggle of good and evil (as Tommy himself once had to do as the evil Green Ranger) because he gained his powers from a raw Dino Gem in Mesogog&#x27;s lab, with the powers originally intended to be Mesogog&#x27;s. Mesogog is, in fact, Trent&#x27;s adopted father, who, in a faulty lab experiment, began to mutate into Mesogog. Trent later sides with good and saves his father from the mutation.

The Rangers morph by drawing power from their respective Dino Gems, which Tommy grants Conner&#x27;s, Ethan&#x27;s and Kira&#x27;s the ability to morph into Dino Morphers whenever needed (Morph call: &quot;Dino Thunder, Power Up!&quot;). They use their abilities to battle Mesogog. By calling out &quot;Super Dino Mode&quot;, the Power Rangers tap into the power of the dinosaurs, with spikes extending into view on their suits and, in the case of Kira, wings with Trent&#x27;s own Super Dino Mode possessing an exclusive extra factor: bladed thin spikes extending from his hands. Each Dino Gems has a special power; red is speed; blue is armor; yellow is hyper screeching; black and white are similar, being invisibility and camouflage, which means Tommy and Trent both use stealth-themed powers with their Gems. In &quot;Power Rangers Dino Fury&quot;, the Dino Gems are revealed to be created by the Morphin Masters.

During the course of the series, the team adds the following to its arsenal of Zords: Cephalozord (based on the &quot;Pachycephalosaurus&quot;), Dimetrozord (based on the &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;), Stegozord (based on the &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;), Parasaurzord (based on the &quot;Parasaurolophus&quot;), and Ankylozord (based on the &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot;). The Stegozord later combines with Trent&#x27;s Dragozord (based on the &quot;Tupuxuara&quot;) to form the Dino Stegozord, effectively stealing the Stegozord. Tommy is paired with the Brachiozord (based on the &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot;), a carrier Zord for most, but not all, of the other Zords. Conner is also later given the powers of the Shield of Triumph to morph into the Triassic Ranger for extra power and pilots the Mezodon Rover/Megazord (based on the &quot;Styracosaurus&quot;), the Zord that corresponds with the Triassic Ranger powers, which can combine with the Cephalo, Dimetro, Parasaur and Ankylozords to form the Triceramax Megazord.

At the end of the series, the Rangers destroy Mesogog with their raw Dino Gem powers combined into a single last-resort attack which burns out the gems in the process. Just before this final battle, they are forced to sacrifice the Zords in their last battle with Zeltrax. Finally they return to their normal lives.

==Production==

Conversations of the season&#x27;s name started as early as a year before the show&#x27;s premiere. On March 4, 2003, an annual kick-off presentation was given to Disney and Bandai representatives to discuss the next year of business with topics such as forecasts of toy sales and development timelines. While &quot;Dino Thunder&quot; was not being presented at this time, the following titles were given as recommendations:

* &quot;Dino Strike&quot;
* &quot;Dino Might&quot;
* &quot;Dino Damage&quot;
* &quot;Dino Defenders&quot;
* &quot;Dragon Hunt&quot;

This series sees legacy cast member Jason David Frank (&quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;, &quot;Power Rangers Zeo&quot;, &quot;Power Rangers Turbo&quot;) return as a series regular, now in the role as mentor and later additional Ranger. At a Ikkicon Q&amp;A in 2010, Frank discussed how his return started with a call he received from co-executive producers Ann Austen and Douglas Sloan, the former being Frank&#x27;s first acting coach, in an effort to boost the show&#x27;s ratings.

With his family and life in the United States, it&#x27;s rumored that Frank negotiated time off during the season&#x27;s shooting in New Zealand to be able to return home. Relying on stunt performers and additional ADR, writers created a plot that has Tommy collectively encased in amber, unable to de-morph, and unable to control his invisible powers for episodes 13 - 26.

The season&#x27;s fourth episode, &quot;Legacy of Power,&quot; features a retelling of the show&#x27;s in-universe history for the show&#x27;s 500th episode celebration. &quot;Fighting Spirit,&quot; the season&#x27;s 27th episode, sees Tommy encounter his previous Ranger forms in a dream and aired on the eleventh anniversary of &quot;Power Rangers&quot;.

&quot;Dino Thunder&quot; was the first &quot;Power Rangers&quot; season to overtly acknowledge its Super Sentai roots with an episode entitled &quot;Lost and Found in Translation,&quot; which featured a Japanese show based on the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; dubbed in English. In actuality, the footage used in that episode was from episode 10 (&quot;Abare League Bind&quot;) of &quot;Dino Thunder&quot;&#x27;s source series, &quot;Bakuryū Sentai Abaranger&quot;, dubbed in a manner similar to the comedic parody dub of &quot;Kagaku Sentai Dynaman&quot; in the late 1980s.

==Video games==
Video game publisher THQ released two video games for &quot;Dino Thunder&quot;, one version for both Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 2 and Nintendo&#x27;s GameCube while the other was exclusively released on Nintendo&#x27;s Game Boy Advance. Developed by Natsume, the GBA version was a side-scrolling fighting game with 13 missions and allowed players to control both the rangers and Megazord at different parts of the levels. The home console version, developed by Pacific Coast Power &amp; Light, let players pilot the team&#x27;s Zords as they work to free their auxiliary machines and destroy enemy facilities. This version included unlockable Zords from the two previous seasons, &quot;Wild Force&quot; and &quot;Ninja Storm&quot;, and was the first &quot;Power Rangers&quot; game to be produced on a sixth generation console.

==Home media==
In the United States, the series was released by Buena Vista Home Entertainment on five volumes, consisting of the first twenty-four episodes, except for Episode 10:
* &quot;Day of the Dino&quot; (June 1, 2004, episodes 1-3, also includes Episodes 37-38 of &quot;Ninja Storm&quot;)
* &quot;Legacy of Power&quot; (September 7, 2004, episodes 4-8)
* &quot;White Thunder&quot; (September 7, 2004, episodes 9, 11-14)
* &quot;Collision Course&quot; (December 7, 2004, episodes 15-19)
* &quot;Triassic Triumph&quot; (December 7, 2004, episodes 20-24)

These volume sets were also released in regions where BVHE held distribution rights, however, Volume 1 does not include the bonus &quot;Ninja Storm&quot; episodes. In countries where licensing was held by Jetix Europe, releases depended on the region or distributor.

BVHE released the complete series in the United Kingdom on July 14, 2008, on a seven-disc boxset. In the United States, Shout! Factory released the complete series on a five-disc set on October 18, 2016.

<text>Vanier (formerly Eastview) is a neighbourhood in the Rideau-Vanier Ward of the east end of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Historically francophone and working class, the neighbourhood was a separate city until being amalgamated into Ottawa in 2001. It no longer has a majority francophone population. By 2012 its francophone population had shrunk to less than 40% from 63% in the early 1980s. The neighbourhood is located on the east bank of the Rideau River, across from the neighbourhoods of Lowertown and Sandy Hill, and just south of Rockcliffe Park, New Edinburgh, Lindenlea, and Manor Park. To the east of Vanier are the suburbs of Gloucester. Vanier has a relatively small area with a high population density.

==History==
In 1908, the communities of Janeville, Clarkstown and Clandeboye were joined to form the village of Eastview. Janeville had been located along the west end of Montreal Road, between what is now Deschamps and McArthur. Clarkstown was located north of Deschamps and west of Marier, while Clandeboye was further east between Montreal Road on the south, the Beechwood Cemetery to the north and Notre-Dame Cemetery to the east.

In 1913, Eastview was incorporated as a town. Originally it was a popular destination for civil servants who wished to live at a distance from downtown. It later saw a large influx of French Canadians and became the main francophone area in the capital.

During the Great Depression, Eastview held the attention of the entire nation, as it became a public forum for national debates on birth control during the Eastview Birth Control Trial, which lasted from 1936 to 1937. Significant controversy erupted when Dorothea Palmer was arrested for distributing birth control information to the poorer, predominantly Catholic neighbourhoods. Later, in 1963 it became a city, and in 1969 was renamed after the recently deceased Governor General of Canada, Georges Vanier.

The City of Eastview erected a memorial at the intersection of Marier Avenue, Dagmar Avenue and Hannah Street. It is dedicated to citizens from Eastview who gave their lives in Canadian military conflicts.

==Present==
Starting with an area closer to the Rideau River, Vanier is increasingly being earmarked for gentrification. It is one of the last relatively inexpensive Ottawa neighbourhoods with a desirable location next to downtown. The neighbourhood is becoming increasingly popular with young families thanks to the only publicly-funded school in Ottawa based on Waldorf education, Trille-des-Bois, boasting an excellent standard for publicly-funded schools. Vanier has active community association.

Vanier offers a wide choice of retail shops, strip malls, eateries and bars. Both subsidized and self-financed housing is available here, along with several existing and proposed upscale condominiums and in-fill developments. The population on the western edge of Vanier closer to the Rideau River, notably the Kingsview Park neighbourhood, is among the more affluent.

As with nearby Lowertown, Ottawa&#x27;s Vanier neighbourhood is home to a number of French-speaking immigrants from Africa and elsewhere. It is also the site of the urban Maple Sugar Festival (Festival des Sucres) held in spring, and home to an outdoor Catholic shrine, La Grotte-de-Lourdes.

The neighbourhood has two ridings, one federal and one provincial, both named Ottawa—Vanier, and are represented by MP Mona Fortier (Liberal) federally and MPP Lucille Collard (Ontario Liberal) provincially. It is one of the staunchly Liberal federal ridings in Canada, having voted for the party consistently since its creation in 1935.

<text>A monochord, also known as sonometer (see below), is an ancient musical and scientific laboratory instrument, involving one (mono-) string (chord). The term &quot;monochord&quot; is sometimes used as the class-name for any musical stringed instrument having only one string and a stick shaped body, also known as musical bows. According to the Hornbostel–Sachs system, string bows are bar zithers (311.1) while monochords are traditionally board zithers (314). The &quot;harmonical canon&quot;, or monochord is, at its least, &quot;merely a string having a board under it of exactly the same length, upon which may be delineated the points at which the string must be stopped to give certain notes,&quot; allowing comparison.

A string is fixed at both ends and stretched over a sound box. One or more movable bridges are then manipulated to demonstrate mathematical relationships among the frequencies produced. &quot;With its single string, movable bridge and graduated rule, the monochord (&quot;kanōn&quot; [Greek: law]) straddled the gap between notes and numbers, intervals and ratios, sense-perception and mathematical reason.&quot; However, &quot;music, mathematics, and astronomy were [also] inexorably linked in the monochord.&quot; As a pedagogical tool for demonstrating mathematical relationships between intervals, the monochord remained in use throughout the Middle Ages.

==Experimental use==

The monochord can be used to illustrate the mathematical properties of musical pitch and to illustrate Mersenne&#x27;s laws regarding string length and tension: &quot;essentially a tool for measuring musical intervals&quot;. For example, when a monochord&#x27;s string is open it vibrates at a particular frequency and produces a pitch. When the length of the string is halved, and plucked, it produces a pitch an octave higher and the string vibrates at twice the frequency of the original (2:1) . Half of this length will produce a pitch two octaves higher than the original—four times the initial frequency (4:1)—and so on. Standard diatonic Pythagorean tuning (Ptolemy&#x27;s Diatonic Ditonic) is easily derived starting from superparticular ratios, (n+1)/n, constructed from the first four counting numbers, the tetractys, measured out on a monochord. The mathematics involved include the multiplication table, least common multiples, and prime and composite numbers.

&quot;As the name implies, only one string is needed to do the experiments; but, since ancient times, several strings were used, all tuned in exact unison, each with a moveable bridge, so that various intervals can be compared to each other .&quot; A &quot;bichord instrument&quot; is one, &quot;having two strings in unison for each note [a course],&quot; such as the mandolin. With two strings one can easily demonstrate how various musical intervals sound. Both open strings are tuned to the same pitch, and then the movable bridge is put in a mathematical position on the second string to demonstrate, for instance, the major third (at 4/5th of the string length) or the minor third (at 5/6th of the string length) .

Many contemporary composers focused on microtonality and just intonation such as Harry Partch, Ivor Darreg, Tony Conrad, Glenn Branca, Bart Hopkin, and Yuri Landman constructed multistring variants of sonometers with movable bridges.

==Instruments==

Parts of a monochord include a tuning peg, nut, string, moveable bridge, fixed bridge, calibration marks, belly or resonating box, and an end pin.

Instruments derived from the monochord (or its moveable bridge) include the guqin, dan bau, koto, vina, hurdy-gurdy, and clavichord (&quot;hence all keyboard instruments&quot;). A monopipe is the wind instrument version of a monochord; a variable open pipe which can produce variable pitches, a sliding cylinder with the numbers of the monochord marked. End correction must be used with this method, to achieve accuracy.

==Monochord practitioners==


The monochord is mentioned in Sumerian writings, and, according to some, was reinvented by Pythagoras (sixth century BCE). Dolge attributes the invention of the moveable bridge to Guido of Arezzo around 1000 CE.

In 1618, Robert Fludd devised a mundane monochord (also celestial or divine monochord) that linked the Ptolemaic universe to musical intervals. &quot;Was it [Mersenne&#x27;s discoveries through use of the monochord (1637)] physical intuition or a Pythagorean confidence in the importance of small whole numbers? ... It was the latter.&quot;

The psalmodicon, a similar instrument but with a chromatic fret board replacing the moveable bridge, was developed in Denmark in the 1820s and became widespread throughout Scandinavia in churches as an alternative to the organ. Scandinavian immigrants also brought it to the United States. It became quite rare by the latter 20th century, but more recently has been revived by folk musicians.

An image of the celestial monochord was used on the 1952 cover of &quot;Anthology of American Folk Music&quot; by Harry Everett Smith and in the 1977 book &quot;The Cosmographical Glass: Renaissance Diagrams of the Universe&quot; (p. 133) by S. K. Heninger Jr., . A reproduction of the monochordum mundanum (mundane monochord) illustration from page 90 of Robert Fludd&#x27;s &quot;Utriusque Cosmi, Maioris scilicet et Minoris, Metaphysica, Physica, Atque Technica Historia&quot; (&quot;Tomus Primus&quot;), 1617, was used as the cover art for Kepler Quartet&#x27;s 2011 audio CD, &quot;Ben Johnston: String Quartets Nos. 1, 5 &amp; 10&quot; (New World Records Cat. No. 80693), which is classical music that uses pitch ratios extended to higher partials beyond the standard Pythagorean tuning system.

A modern playing technique used in experimental rock as well as contemporary classical music is 3rd bridge. This technique shares the same mechanism as used on the monochord, by dividing the string into two sections with an additional bridge.

==Sonometer==

A sonometer is a diagnostic instrument used to measure the tension, frequency or density of vibrations. They are used in medical settings to test both hearing and bone density. A sonometer, or audiometer, is used to determine hearing sensitivity, while a clinical bone sonometer measures bone density to help determine such conditions as the risk of osteoporosis.

In audiology, the device is used to test for hearing loss and other disorders of the ear. The audiometer measures the ability to hear sounds at frequencies normally detectable by the human ear. Several test are usually conducted using the audiometer which will then be used to assess hearing ability. Results typically are recorded on a chart known as an audiogram.

A clinical bone sonometer is a device which tests for the risk of bone fractures associated with osteoporosis. This test, called an ultrasound bone densitometry screening, is not typically used for diagnostic purposes; it is generally used as a risk assessment tool. Testing is often recommended for those whose personal history indicates a possible high risk for osteoporosis. Testing is usually conducted by an orthopedist, rheumatologist or neurologist specializing in the treatment of osteoporosis. The patient simply places his or her heel in the sonometer, and it is then scanned using ultrasound to determine bone density. This is a fast and low-cost procedure generally lasting 30 seconds or less. Results typically are available immediately following the procedure. Two score results are possible: a T-score, which compares a patient&#x27;s scan against that of a young person of the same gender; and a Z-score, which compares the scan against someone of similar age, weight and gender. The T-scores results are used to assess the risk of osteoporosis. A score above -1 indicates a low risk for osteoporosis; below -1 to -2.5 indicates a risk of developing osteoporosis; and a score below -2.5 indicates more intensive testing should be performed and that osteoporosis is likely present. The Z-score reports how much bone the patient has as compared to others his age. If this number is high or low, further testing may be ordered.

<text>The Baker-Berry Library is the main library at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. The fresco, &quot;The Epic of American Civilization&quot;, was painted by José Clemente Orozco in the lower level of the library, and is a National Historic Landmark. Baker&#x27;s tower, designed after Independence Hall in Philadelphia, stands 200 feet above campus and is often used as an iconic representation of the college.

==History==
The original, historic library building is the Fisher Ames Baker Memorial Library; it opened in 1928 with a collection of 240,000 volumes. The building was designed by Jens Fredrick Larson, modeled after Independence Hall in Philadelphia, and funded by a gift to Dartmouth College by George Fisher Baker in memory of his uncle, Fisher Ames Baker, Dartmouth class of 1859. The facility was expanded in 1941 and 1957–1958 and received its one millionth volume in 1970.

In 1992, John Berry and the Baker family donated US $30 million for the construction of a new facility, the Berry Library designed by architect Robert Venturi, adjoining the Baker Library. The new complex, the Baker-Berry Library, opened in 2000 and was completed in 2002. The Dartmouth College libraries presently hold over 2 million volumes in their collections.

<text>The Smith chart (sometimes also called Smith diagram, Mizuhashi chart (), Mizuhashi–Smith chart (), Volpert–Smith chart () or Mizuhashi–Volpert–Smith chart) is a graphical calculator or nomogram designed for electrical and electronics engineers specializing in radio frequency (RF) engineering to assist in solving problems with transmission lines and matching circuits.

It was independently proposed by Tōsaku Mizuhashi () in 1937, and by () and Phillip H. Smith in 1939. Starting with a rectangular diagram, Smith had developed a special polar coordinate chart by 1936, which, with the input of his colleagues Enoch B. Ferrell and James W. McRae, who were familiar with conformal mappings, was reworked into the final form in early 1937, which was eventually published in January 1939. While Smith had originally called it a &quot;transmission line chart&quot; and other authors first used names like &quot;&quot;reflection chart&quot;, &quot;circle diagram of impedance&quot;, &quot;immittance chart&quot; or &quot;Z-plane chart&quot;&quot;, early adopters at MIT&#x27;s Radiation Laboratory started to refer to it simply as &quot;Smith chart&quot; in the 1940s, a name generally accepted in the Western world by 1950.

The Smith chart can be used to simultaneously display multiple parameters including impedances, admittances, reflection coefficients, formula_1 scattering parameters, noise figure circles, constant gain contours and regions for unconditional stability. The Smith chart is most frequently used at or within the unity radius region. However, the remainder is still mathematically relevant, being used, for example, in oscillator design and stability analysis. While the use of paper Smith charts for solving the complex mathematics involved in matching problems has been largely replaced by software based methods, the Smith chart is still a very useful method of showing how RF parameters behave at one or more frequencies, an alternative to using tabular information. Thus most RF circuit analysis software includes a Smith chart option for the display of results and all but the simplest impedance measuring instruments can plot measured results on a Smith chart display.
==Overview==
The Smith chart is a mathematical transformation of the two-dimensional Cartesian complex plane. Complex numbers with positive real parts map inside the circle. Those with negative real parts map outside the circle.
If we are dealing only with impedances with non-negative resistive components, our interest is focused on the area inside the circle. The transformation, for an impedance Smith chart, is:

formula_2

where , i.e., the complex impedance, , normalized by the reference impedance, . The impedance Smith chart is then an Argand plot of impedances thus transformed. Impedances with non-negative resistive components will appear inside a circle with unit radius; the origin will correspond to the reference impedance, .

The Smith chart is plotted on the complex reflection coefficient plane in two dimensions and may be scaled in normalised impedance (the most common), normalised admittance or both, using different colours to distinguish between them. These are often known as the Z, Y and YZ Smith charts respectively. Normalised scaling allows the Smith chart to be used for problems involving any characteristic or system impedance which is represented by the center point of the chart. The most commonly used normalization impedance is 50 ohms. Once an answer is obtained through the graphical constructions described below, it is straightforward to convert between normalised impedance (or normalised admittance) and the corresponding unnormalized value by multiplying by the characteristic impedance (admittance). Reflection coefficients can be read directly from the chart as they are unitless parameters.

The Smith chart has a scale around its circumference or periphery which is graduated in wavelengths and degrees. The wavelengths scale is used in distributed component problems and represents the distance measured along the transmission line connected between the generator or source and the load to the point under consideration. The degrees scale represents the angle of the voltage reflection coefficient at that point. The Smith chart may also be used for lumped-element matching and analysis problems.

Use of the Smith chart and the interpretation of the results obtained using it requires a good understanding of AC circuit theory and transmission-line theory, both of which are prerequisites for RF engineers.

As impedances and admittances change with frequency, problems using the Smith chart can only be solved manually using one frequency at a time, the result being represented by a point. This is often adequate for narrow band applications (typically up to about 5% to 10% bandwidth) but for wider bandwidths it is usually necessary to apply Smith chart techniques at more than one frequency across the operating frequency band. Provided the frequencies are sufficiently close, the resulting Smith chart points may be joined by straight lines to create a locus.

A locus of points on a Smith chart covering a range of frequencies can be used to visually represent:
*how capacitive or how inductive a load is across the frequency range
*how difficult matching is likely to be at various frequencies
*how well matched a particular component is.
The accuracy of the Smith chart is reduced for problems involving a large locus of impedances or admittances, although the scaling can be magnified for individual areas to accommodate these.

==Mathematical basis==
===Actual and normalised impedance and admittance===
A transmission line with a characteristic impedance of formula_3 may be universally considered to have a characteristic admittance of formula_4 where
:formula_5
Any impedance, formula_6 expressed in ohms, may be normalised by dividing it by the characteristic impedance, so the normalised impedance using the lower case &quot;z&quot;T is given by 
:formula_7
Similarly, for normalised admittance
:formula_8
The SI unit of impedance is the ohm with the symbol of the upper case Greek letter omega (Ω) and the SI unit for admittance is the siemens with the symbol of an upper case letter S. Normalised impedance and normalised admittance are dimensionless. Actual impedances and admittances must be normalised before using them on a Smith chart. Once the result is obtained it may be de-normalised to obtain the actual result.

===The normalised impedance Smith chart===

Using transmission-line theory, if a transmission line is terminated in an impedance (formula_6) which differs from its characteristic impedance (formula_3), a standing wave will be formed on the line comprising the resultant of both the incident or forward (formula_11) and the reflected or reversed (formula_12) waves. Using complex exponential notation:
:formula_13 and
:formula_14
where

:formula_15 is the temporal part of the wave
:formula_16 is the spatial part of the wave and
:formula_17 where
:formula_18 is the angular frequency in radians per second (rad/s)
:formula_19 is the frequency in hertz (Hz)
:formula_20 is the time in seconds (s)
:formula_21 and formula_22 are constants
:formula_23 is the distance measured along the transmission line from the load toward the generator in metres (m)
Also
:formula_24 is the propagation constant which has SI units radians/meter
where
:formula_25 is the attenuation constant in nepers per metre (Np/m)
:formula_26 is the phase constant in radians per metre (rad/m)
The Smith chart is used with one frequency (formula_27) at a time, and only for one moment (formula_28) at a time, so the temporal part of the phase (formula_15) is fixed. All terms are actually multiplied by this to obtain the instantaneous phase, but it is conventional and understood to omit it. Therefore,
:formula_30 and
:formula_31

where formula_21 and formula_22 are respectively the forward and reverse voltage amplitudes at the load.

====The variation of complex reflection coefficient with position along the line====

The complex voltage reflection coefficient formula_34 is defined as the ratio of the reflected wave to the incident (or forward) wave. Therefore,
:formula_35
where is also a constant.

For a uniform transmission line (in which formula_36 is constant), the complex reflection coefficient of a standing wave varies according to the position on the line. If the line is lossy (formula_25 is non-zero) this is represented on the Smith chart by a spiral path. In most Smith chart problems however, losses can be assumed negligible (formula_38) and the task of solving them is greatly simplified. For the loss free case therefore, the expression for complex reflection coefficient becomes 
:formula_39
where formula_40 is the reflection coefficient at the load, and formula_23 is the line length from the load to the location where the reflection coefficient is measured. The phase constant formula_26 may also be written as 
:formula_43
where formula_44 is the wavelength &quot;within the transmission line&quot; at the test frequency.

Therefore,
:formula_45
This equation shows that, for a standing wave, the complex reflection coefficient and impedance repeats every half wavelength along the transmission line. The complex reflection coefficient is generally simply referred to as reflection coefficient. The outer circumferential scale of the Smith chart represents the distance from the generator to the load scaled in wavelengths and is therefore scaled from zero to 0.50.

====The variation of normalised impedance with position along the line====
If formula_46 and formula_47 are the voltage across and the current entering the termination at the end of the transmission line respectively, then
:formula_48
and
:formula_49.
By dividing these equations and substituting for both the voltage reflection coefficient
:formula_50
and the normalised impedance of the termination represented by the lower case , subscript T
:formula_51
gives the result:
:formula_52
Alternatively, in terms of the reflection coefficient
:formula_53
These are the equations which are used to construct the Smith chart. Mathematically speaking formula_54 and formula_55 are related via a Möbius transformation.

Both formula_54 and formula_55 are expressed in complex numbers without any units. They both change with frequency so for any particular measurement, the frequency at which it was performed must be stated together with the characteristic impedance.

formula_54 may be expressed in magnitude and angle on a polar diagram. Any actual reflection coefficient must have a magnitude of less than or equal to unity so, at the test frequency, this may be expressed by a point inside a circle of unity radius. The Smith chart is actually constructed on such a polar diagram. The Smith chart scaling is designed in such a way that reflection coefficient can be converted to normalised impedance or vice versa. Using the Smith chart, the normalised impedance may be obtained with appreciable accuracy by plotting the point representing the reflection coefficient &quot;treating the Smith chart as a polar diagram&quot; and then reading its value directly using the characteristic Smith chart scaling. This technique is a graphical alternative to substituting the values in the equations.

By substituting the expression for how reflection coefficient changes along an unmatched loss-free transmission line
:formula_59
for the loss free case, into the equation for normalised impedance in terms of reflection coefficient
:formula_52 
and using Euler&#x27;s formula
:formula_61
yields the impedance-version transmission-line equation for the loss free case:
:formula_62
where
formula_63 is the impedance &#x27;seen&#x27; at the input of a loss free transmission line of length formula_64 terminated with an impedance formula_65

Versions of the transmission-line equation may be similarly derived for the admittance loss free case and for the impedance and admittance lossy cases.

The Smith chart graphical equivalent of using the transmission-line equation is to normalise formula_66 to plot the resulting point on a Smith chart and to draw a circle through that point centred at the Smith chart centre. The path along the arc of the circle represents how the impedance changes whilst moving along the transmission line. In this case the circumferential (wavelength) scaling must be used, remembering that this is the wavelength within the transmission line and may differ from the free space wavelength.

====Regions of the Smith chart====
If a polar diagram is mapped on to a cartesian coordinate system it is conventional to measure angles relative to the positive -axis using a counterclockwise direction for positive angles. The magnitude of a complex number is the length of a straight line drawn from the origin to the point representing it. The Smith chart uses the same convention, noting that, in the normalised impedance plane, the positive -axis extends from the center of the Smith chart at formula_67 to the point formula_68 The region above the x-axis represents inductive impedances (positive imaginary parts) and the region below the -axis represents capacitive impedances (negative imaginary parts).

If the termination is perfectly matched, the reflection coefficient will be zero, represented effectively by a circle of zero radius or in fact a point at the centre of the Smith chart. If the termination was a perfect open circuit or short circuit the magnitude of the reflection coefficient would be unity, all power would be reflected and the point would lie at some point on the unity circumference circle.

====Circles of constant normalised resistance and constant normalised reactance====
The normalised impedance Smith chart is composed of two families of circles: circles of constant normalised resistance and circles of constant normalised reactance. In the complex reflection coefficient plane the Smith chart occupies a circle of unity radius centred at the origin. In cartesian coordinates therefore the circle would pass through the points (+1,0) and (−1,0) on the -axis and the points (0,+1) and (0,−1) on the -axis.

Since both formula_54 and formula_55 are complex numbers, in general they may be written as:
:formula_71
:formula_72

with &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; and &quot;d&quot; real numbers.

Substituting these into the equation relating normalised impedance and complex reflection coefficient:
:formula_73
gives the following result:
:formula_74
This is the equation which describes how the complex reflection coefficient changes with the normalised impedance and may be used to construct both families of circles.

===The Smith chart===
The Smith chart is constructed in a similar way to the Smith chart case but by expressing values of voltage reflection coefficient in terms of normalised admittance instead of normalised impedance. The normalised admittance is the reciprocal of the normalised impedance , so
:formula_75
Therefore:
:formula_76
and
:formula_77
The Smith chart appears like the normalised impedance, type but with the graphic nested circles rotated through 180°, but the numeric scale remaining in its same position (not rotated) as the chart.

Similarly taking
:formula_78
for real formula_79 and formula_80 gives an analogous result, although with more and different minus signs:
:formula_81

The region above the -axis represents capacitive admittances and the region below the -axis represents inductive admittances. Capacitive admittances have positive imaginary parts and inductive admittances have negative imaginary parts.

Again, if the termination is perfectly matched the reflection coefficient will be zero, represented by a &#x27;circle&#x27; of zero radius or in fact a point at the centre of the Smith chart. If the termination was a perfect open or short circuit the magnitude of the voltage reflection coefficient would be unity, all power would be reflected and the point would lie at some point on the unity circumference circle of the Smith chart.

===Practical examples===

A point with a reflection coefficient magnitude 0.63 and angle 60° represented in polar form as formula_82, is shown as point P1 on the Smith chart. To plot this, one may use the circumferential (reflection coefficient) angle scale to find the formula_83 graduation and a ruler to draw a line passing through this and the centre of the Smith chart. The length of the line would then be scaled to P1 assuming the Smith chart radius to be unity. For example, if the actual radius measured from the paper was 100 mm, the length OP1 would be 63 mm.

The following table gives some similar examples of points which are plotted on the &quot;Z&quot; Smith chart. For each, the reflection coefficient is given in polar form together with the corresponding normalised impedance in rectangular form. The conversion may be read directly from the Smith chart or by substitution into the equation.

===Working with both the &quot;Z&quot; Smith chart and the &quot;Y&quot; Smith charts===
In RF circuit and matching problems sometimes it is more convenient to work with admittances (representing conductances and susceptances) and sometimes it is more convenient to work with impedances (representing resistances and reactances). Solving a typical matching problem will often require several changes between both types of Smith chart, using normalised impedance for series elements and normalised admittances for parallel elements. For these a dual (normalised) impedance and admittance Smith chart may be used. Alternatively, one type may be used and the scaling converted to the other when required. In order to change from normalised impedance to normalised admittance or vice versa, the point representing the value of reflection coefficient under consideration is moved through exactly 180 degrees at the same radius. For example, the point P1 in the example representing a reflection coefficient of formula_82 has a normalised impedance of formula_85. To graphically change this to the equivalent normalised admittance point, say Q1, a line is drawn with a ruler from P1 through the Smith chart centre to Q1, an equal radius in the opposite direction. This is equivalent to moving the point through a circular path of exactly 180 degrees. Reading the value from the Smith chart for Q1, remembering that the scaling is now in normalised admittance, gives formula_86. Performing the calculation
:formula_87
manually will confirm this.

Once a transformation from impedance to admittance has been performed, the scaling changes to normalised admittance until a later transformation back to normalised impedance is performed.

The table below shows examples of normalised impedances and their equivalent normalised admittances obtained by rotation of the point through 180°. Again, these may be obtained either by calculation or using a Smith chart as shown, converting between the normalised impedance and normalised admittances planes.


===Choice of Smith chart type and component type===
The choice of whether to use the &quot;Z&quot; Smith chart or the &quot;Y&quot; Smith chart for any particular calculation depends on which is more convenient. Impedances in series and admittances in parallel add while impedances in parallel and admittances in series are related by a reciprocal equation. If formula_88 is the equivalent impedance of series impedances and formula_89 is the equivalent impedance of parallel impedances, then
:formula_90
:formula_91
For admittances the reverse is true, that is
:formula_92
:formula_93
Dealing with the reciprocals, especially in complex numbers, is more time-consuming and error-prone than using linear addition. In general therefore, most RF engineers work in the plane where the circuit topography supports linear addition. The following table gives the complex expressions for impedance (real and normalised) and admittance (real and normalised) for each of the three basic passive circuit elements: resistance, inductance and capacitance. Using just the characteristic impedance (or characteristic admittance) and test frequency an equivalent circuit can be found and vice versa.

==Using the Smith chart to solve conjugate matching problems with distributed components==
Distributed matching becomes feasible and is sometimes required when the physical size of the matching components is more than about 5% of a wavelength at the operating frequency. Here the electrical behaviour of many lumped components becomes rather unpredictable. This occurs in microwave circuits and when high power requires large components in shortwave, FM and TV broadcasting.

For distributed components the effects on reflection coefficient and impedance of moving along the transmission line must be allowed for using the outer circumferential scale of the Smith chart which is calibrated in wavelengths.

The following example shows how a transmission line, terminated with an arbitrary load, may be matched at one frequency either with a series or parallel reactive component in each case connected at precise positions.
Supposing a loss-free air-spaced transmission line of characteristic impedance formula_94, operating at a frequency of 800 MHz, is terminated with a circuit comprising a 17.5 formula_95 resistor in series with a 6.5 nanohenry (6.5 nH) inductor. How may the line be matched?

From the table above, the reactance of the inductor forming part of the termination at 800 MHz is
:formula_96
so the impedance of the combination (formula_97) is given by
:formula_98
and the normalised impedance (formula_99) is
:formula_100
This is plotted on the Z Smith chart at point P20. The line OP20 is extended through to the wavelength scale where it intersects at the point formula_101. As the transmission line is loss free, a circle centred at the centre of the Smith chart is drawn through the point P20 to represent the path of the constant magnitude reflection coefficient due to the termination. At point P21 the circle intersects with the unity circle of constant normalised resistance at 
:formula_102.
The extension of the line OP21 intersects the wavelength scale at formula_103, therefore the distance from the termination to this point on the line is given by
:formula_104
Since the transmission line is air-spaced, the wavelength at 800 MHz in the line is the same as that in free space and is given by
:formula_105
where formula_106 is the velocity of electromagnetic radiation in free space and formula_19 is the frequency in hertz. The result gives formula_108, making the position of the matching component 29.6 mm from the load.

The conjugate match for the impedance at P21 (formula_109) is 
:formula_110
As the Smith chart is still in the normalised impedance plane, from the table above a series capacitor formula_111 is required where
:formula_112
Rearranging, we obtain
:formula_113.
Substitution of known values gives
:formula_114
To match the termination at 800 MHz, a series capacitor of 2.6 pF must be placed in series with the transmission line at a distance of 29.6 mm from the termination.

An alternative shunt match could be calculated after performing a Smith chart transformation from normalised impedance to normalised admittance. Point Q20 is the equivalent of P20 but expressed as a normalised admittance. Reading from the Smith chart scaling, remembering that this is now a normalised admittance gives
:formula_115
(In fact this value is not actually used). However, the extension of the line OQ20 through to the wavelength scale gives formula_116. The earliest point at which a shunt conjugate match could be introduced, moving towards the generator, would be at Q21, the same position as the previous P21, but this time representing a normalised admittance given by 
:formula_117.
The distance along the transmission line is in this case 
:formula_118
which converts to 123 mm.

The conjugate matching component is required to have a normalised admittance (formula_119) of
:formula_120.
From the table it can be seen that a negative admittance would require an inductor, connected in parallel with the transmission line. If its value is formula_121, then
:formula_122
This gives the result 
:formula_123
A suitable inductive shunt matching would therefore be a 6.5 nH inductor in parallel with the line positioned at 123 mm from the load.

==Using the Smith chart to analyze lumped-element circuits==
The analysis of lumped-element components assumes that the wavelength at the frequency of operation is much greater than the dimensions of the components themselves. The Smith chart may be used to analyze such circuits in which case the movements around the chart are generated by the (normalized) impedances and admittances of the components at the frequency of operation. In this case the wavelength scaling on the Smith chart circumference is not used. The following circuit will be analyzed using a Smith chart at an operating frequency of 100 MHz. At this frequency the free space wavelength is 3 m. The component dimensions themselves will be in the order of millimetres so the assumption of lumped components will be valid. Despite there being no transmission line as such, a system impedance must still be defined to enable normalization and de-normalization calculations and formula_124 is a good choice here as formula_125. If there were very different values of resistance present a value closer to these might be a better choice.

The analysis starts with a Z Smith chart looking into R1 only with no other components present. As formula_125 is the same as the system impedance, this is represented by a point at the centre of the Smith chart. The first transformation is OP1 along the line of constant normalized resistance in this case the addition of a normalized reactance of -&quot;j&quot;0.80, corresponding to a series capacitor of 40 pF. Points with suffix P are in the &quot;Z&quot; plane and points with suffix Q are in the &quot;Y&quot; plane. Therefore, transformations &quot;P&quot;1 to &quot;Q&quot;1 and &quot;P&quot;3 to &quot;Q&quot;3 are from the Z Smith chart to the Y Smith chart and transformation &quot;Q&quot;2 to &quot;P&quot;2 is from the Y Smith chart to the Z Smith chart. The following table shows the steps taken to work through the remaining components and transformations, returning eventually back to the centre of the Smith chart and a perfect 50 ohm match. 
==3D Smith chart==

A generalization of the Smith chart to a three dimensional sphere, based on the extended complex plane (Riemann sphere) and inversive geometry, was proposed by Muller, &quot;et al&quot; in 2011.

The chart unifies the passive and active circuit design on little and big circles on the surface of a unit sphere, using a stereographic conformal map of the reflection coefficient&#x27;s generalized plane. Considering the point at infinity, the space of the new chart includes all possible loads: The north pole is the perfectly matched point, while the south pole is the completely mismatched point.

The 3D Smith chart has been further extended outside of the spherical surface, for plotting various scalar parameters, such as group delay, quality factors, or frequency orientation. The visual frequency orientation (clockwise vs. counter-clockwise) enables one to differentiate between a negative / capacitance and positive / inductive whose reflection coefficients are the same when plotted on a 2D Smith chart, but whose orientations diverge as frequency increases.
