<doc id="494418" wikidata="Q1056595" url="?curid=494418" title="Proper time">
<text>In relativity, proper time (from Latin, meaning &quot;own time&quot;) along a timelike world line is defined as the time as measured by a clock following that line. The proper time interval between two events on a world line is the change in proper time, which is independent of coordinates, and is a Lorentz scalar. The interval is the quantity of interest, since proper time itself is fixed only up to an arbitrary additive constant, namely the setting of the clock at some event along the world line.

The proper time interval between two events depends not only on the events, but also the world line connecting them, and hence on the motion of the clock between the events. It is expressed as an integral over the world line (analogous to arc length in Euclidean space). An accelerated clock will measure a smaller elapsed time between two events than that measured by a non-accelerated (inertial) clock between the same two events. The twin paradox is an example of this effect.

By convention, proper time is usually represented by the Greek letter &quot;τ&quot; (tau) to distinguish it from coordinate time represented by &quot;t&quot;. Coordinate time is the time between two events as measured by an observer using that observer&#x27;s own method of assigning a time to an event. In the special case of an inertial observer in special relativity, the time is measured using the observer&#x27;s clock and the observer&#x27;s definition of simultaneity.

The concept of proper time was introduced by Hermann Minkowski in 1908, and is an important feature of Minkowski diagrams.

== Mathematical formalism ==

The formal definition of proper time involves describing the path through spacetime that represents a clock, observer, or test particle, and the metric structure of that spacetime. Proper time is the pseudo-Riemannian arc length of world lines in four-dimensional spacetime. From the mathematical point of view, coordinate time is assumed to be predefined and an expression for proper time as a function of coordinate time is required. On the other hand, proper time is measured experimentally and coordinate time is calculated from the proper time of inertial clocks.

Proper time can only be defined for timelike paths through spacetime which allow for the construction of an accompanying set of physical rulers and clocks. The same formalism for spacelike paths leads to a measurement of proper distance rather than proper time. For lightlike paths, there exists no concept of proper time and it is undefined as the spacetime interval is zero. Instead, an arbitrary and physically irrelevant affine parameter unrelated to time must be introduced.

===In special relativity===
With the timelike convention for the metric signature, the Minkowski metric is defined by
formula_1
and the coordinates by
formula_2
for arbitrary Lorentz frames.

In any such frame an infinitesimal interval, here assumed timelike, between two events is expressed as

and separates points on a trajectory of a particle (think clock{?}). The same interval can be expressed in coordinates such that at each moment, the particle is &quot;at rest&quot;. Such a frame is called an instantaneous rest frame, denoted here by the coordinates formula_3 for each instant. Due to the invariance of the interval (instantaneous rest frames taken at different times are related by Lorentz transformations) one may write
formula_4
since in the instantaneous rest frame, the particle or the frame itself is at rest, i.e., formula_5. Since the interval is assumed timelike (ie. formula_6), taking the square root of the above yields
formula_7
or
formula_8
Given this differential expression for , the proper time interval is defined as

Here is the worldline from some initial event to some final event with the ordering of the events fixed by the requirement that the final event occurs later according to the clock than the initial event.

Using and again the invariance of the interval, one may write
&amp;= \int_a^b \sqrt {1 - \frac{1}{c^2} \left [ \left (\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left (\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2 + \left ( \frac{dz}{dt}\right)^2 \right] }dt
&amp;= \int_a^b \sqrt {1 - \frac{v(t)^2}{c^2}} dt
&amp;= \int_a^b \frac{dt}{\gamma(t)},\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where
formula_9
is an arbitrary bijective parametrization of the worldline 
such that
formula_10 
give the endpoints of and a &lt; b; is the coordinate speed at coordinate time ; and , , and are space coordinates. The first expression is &quot;manifestly&quot; Lorentz invariant. They are all Lorentz invariant, since proper time and proper time intervals are coordinate-independent by definition.

If , are parameterised by a parameter , this can be written as
formula_11

If the motion of the particle is constant, the expression simplifies to
formula_12
where Δ means the change in coordinates between the initial and final events. The definition in special relativity generalizes straightforwardly to general relativity as follows below.

===In general relativity===

Proper time is defined in general relativity as follows: Given a pseudo-Riemannian manifold with a local coordinates and equipped with a metric tensor , the proper time interval between two events along a timelike path is given by the line integral

This expression is, as it should be, invariant under coordinate changes. It reduces (in appropriate coordinates) to the expression of special relativity in flat spacetime.

In the same way that coordinates can be chosen such that in special relativity, this can be done in general relativity too. Then, in these coordinates,
formula_13

This expression generalizes definition and can be taken as the definition. Then using invariance of the interval, equation follows from it in the same way follows from , except that here arbitrary coordinate changes are allowed.

== Examples in special relativity ==

=== Example 1: The twin &quot;paradox&quot; ===

For a twin paradox scenario, let there be an observer &quot;A&quot; who moves between the &quot;A&quot;-coordinates (0,0,0,0) and (10 years, 0, 0, 0) inertially. This means that &quot;A&quot; stays at formula_14 for 10 years of &quot;A&quot;-coordinate time. The proper time interval for &quot;A&quot; between the two events is then
formula_15

So being &quot;at rest&quot; in a special relativity coordinate system means that proper time and coordinate time are the same.

Let there now be another observer &quot;B&quot; who travels in the &quot;x&quot; direction from (0,0,0,0) for 5 years of &quot;A&quot;-coordinate time at 0.866&quot;c&quot; to (5 years, 4.33 light-years, 0, 0). Once there, &quot;B&quot; accelerates, and travels in the other spatial direction for another 5 years of &quot;A&quot;-coordinate time to (10 years, 0, 0, 0). For each leg of the trip, the proper time interval can be calculated using &quot;A&quot;-coordinates, and is given by
formula_16

So the total proper time for observer &quot;B&quot; to go from (0,0,0,0) to (5 years, 4.33 light-years, 0, 0) and then to (10 years, 0, 0, 0) is
formula_17

Thus it is shown that the proper time equation incorporates the time dilation effect. In fact, for an object in a SR (special relativity) spacetime traveling with velocity formula_18 for a time formula_19, the proper time interval experienced is
formula_20
which is the SR time dilation formula.

=== Example 2: The rotating disk ===

An observer rotating around another inertial observer is in an accelerated frame of reference. For such an observer, the incremental (formula_21) form of the proper time equation is needed, along with a parameterized description of the path being taken, as shown below.

Let there be an observer &quot;C&quot; on a disk rotating in the &quot;xy&quot; plane at a coordinate angular rate of formula_22 and who is at a distance of &quot;r&quot; from the center of the disk with the center of the disk at . The path of observer &quot;C&quot; is given by formula_23, where formula_24 is the current coordinate time. When &quot;r&quot; and formula_22 are constant, formula_26 and formula_27. The incremental proper time formula then becomes
formula_28

So for an observer rotating at a constant distance of &quot;r&quot; from a given point in spacetime at a constant angular rate of &quot;ω&quot; between coordinate times formula_29 and formula_30, the proper time experienced will be
formula_31
as formula_32 for a rotating observer. This result is the same as for the linear motion example, and shows the general application of the integral form of the proper time formula.

== Examples in general relativity ==

The difference between SR and general relativity (GR) is that in GR one can use any metric which is a solution of the Einstein field equations, not just the Minkowski metric. Because inertial motion in curved spacetimes lacks the simple expression it has in SR, the line integral form of the proper time equation must always be used.

=== Example 3: The rotating disk (again) ===

An appropriate coordinate conversion done against the Minkowski metric creates coordinates where an object on a rotating disk stays in the same spatial coordinate position. The new coordinates are
formula_33
and
formula_34

The &quot;t&quot; and &quot;z&quot; coordinates remain unchanged. In this new coordinate system, the incremental proper time equation is
formula_35

With &quot;r&quot;, &quot;θ&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; being constant over time, this simplifies to
formula_36
which is the same as in Example 2.

Now let there be an object off of the rotating disk and at inertial rest with respect to the center of the disk and at a distance of &quot;R&quot; from it. This object has a coordinate motion described by , which describes the inertially at-rest object of counter-rotating in the view of the rotating observer. Now the proper time equation becomes
formula_37

So for the inertial at-rest observer, coordinate time and proper time are once again found to pass at the same rate, as expected and required for the internal self-consistency of relativity theory.

=== Example 4: The Schwarzschild solution – time on the Earth ===

The Schwarzschild solution has an incremental proper time equation of
formula_38
where
*&quot;t&quot; is time as calibrated with a clock distant from and at inertial rest with respect to the Earth,
*&quot;r&quot; is a radial coordinate (which is effectively the distance from the Earth&#x27;s center),
*&quot;ɸ&quot; is a co-latitudinal coordinate, the angular separation from the north pole in radians.
*&quot;θ&quot; is a longitudinal coordinate, analogous to the longitude on the Earth&#x27;s surface but independent of the Earth&#x27;s rotation. This is also given in radians.
*&quot;m&quot; is the geometrized mass of the Earth, &quot;m&quot; = &quot;GM&quot;/&quot;c&quot;2,
**&quot;M&quot; is the mass of the Earth,
**&quot;G&quot; is the gravitational constant.

To demonstrate the use of the proper time relationship, several sub-examples involving the Earth will be used here.

For the Earth, , meaning that . When standing on the north pole, we can assume formula_39 (meaning that we are neither moving up or down or along the surface of the Earth). In this case, the Schwarzschild solution proper time equation becomes formula_40. Then using the polar radius of the Earth as the radial coordinate (or formula_41), we find that
formula_42

At the equator, the radius of the Earth is . In addition, the rotation of the Earth needs to be taken into account. This imparts on an observer an angular velocity of formula_43 of 2&quot;π&quot; divided by the sidereal period of the Earth&#x27;s rotation, 86162.4 seconds. So formula_44. The proper time equation then produces
formula_45

From a non-relativistic point of view this should have been the same as the previous result. This example demonstrates how the proper time equation is used, even though the Earth rotates and hence is not spherically symmetric as assumed by the Schwarzschild solution. To describe the effects of rotation more accurately the Kerr metric may be used.

<doc id="494423" wikidata="Q298041" url="?curid=494423" title="Kārlis Ulmanis">
<text>Kārlis Augusts Vilhelms Ulmanis (; 4 September 1877 – 20 September 1942) was a Latvian politician and a dictator. He was one of the most prominent Latvian politicians of pre-World War II Latvia during the Interwar period of independence from November 1918 to June 1940 and served as the country&#x27;s first prime minister. 

He served four times as prime minister, the last time as the head of an authoritarian regime, during which he subsequently also adopted the title of President of Latvia. The legacy of his dictatorship continues to divide public opinion in Latvia today.

== Early life ==
Born in a prosperous farming family, Ulmanis studied agriculture at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich and at Leipzig University. He then worked in Latvia as a writer, lecturer, and manager in agricultural positions. He was politically active during the 1905 Revolution, was briefly imprisoned in Pskov, and subsequently fled Latvia to avoid incarceration by the Russian authorities. During this period of exile, he studied at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln in the United States as Karl August Ulmann, earning a Bachelor of Science degree in agriculture. After working briefly at that university as a lecturer, Ulmanis moved to Houston, Texas. The dairy business he had bought there ran into financial difficulties.

Ulmanis returned to Latvia from American exile in 1913, after being informed that it was now safe for political exiles to return due to the declaration of a general amnesty by Nicholas II of Russia. This safety was short-lived as World War I broke out one year later and Courland Governorate was partially occupied by Germany in 1915.

== Political career in independent Latvia ==
In the last stages of World War I, he founded the Latvian Farmers&#x27; Union, one of the two most prominent political parties in Latvia at that time. Ulmanis was one of the principal founders of the People&#x27;s Council, which proclaimed Latvia&#x27;s independence on 18 November 1918, with Ulmanis as the Prime Minister of the first Provisional government of Latvia. After the Latvian War of Independence of 1919–1920, a constitutional convention established Latvia as a parliamentary democracy in 1920. Ulmanis served as Prime Minister in several subsequent Latvian government administrations from 1918 to 1934.

== Coup of 15 May 1934 ==

On the night of 15–16 May 1934, Ulmanis, with the support of Minister of War Jānis Balodis, proclaimed a state of war and dissolved all political parties and the Saeima (parliament). The bloodless coup was carried out by army and units of the national guard Aizsargi loyal to Ulmanis. They moved against key government offices, communications and transportation facilities. Many elected officials and politicians (almost exclusively Social Democrats, as well as figures from the extreme right and left) were detained, as were any military officers who resisted the coup d&#x27;etat. Some 2,000 Social Democrats were initially detained by the authorities, including most of the Social Democratic members of the disbanded Saeima, as were members of various right-wing radical organisations, such as Pērkonkrusts.

In all, 369 Social Democrats, 95 members of Pērkonkrusts, pro-Nazi activists from the Baltic German community, and a handful of politicians from other parties were interned in a prison camp established in the Karosta district of Liepāja. After several Social Democrats, such as Bruno Kalniņš, had been cleared of weapons charges by the courts, most of those imprisoned began to be released over time. Those convicted by the courts of treasonous acts, such as the leader of Pērkonkrusts Gustavs Celmiņš, remained behind bars for the duration of their sentences, three years in the case of Celmiņš.

For the next four years, Ulmanis ruled by decree, without a parliament. A decree vested the Saeima&#x27;s functions in the cabinet until a new constitution could be drafted. Although the incumbent State President Alberts Kviesis did not support the coup, he remained in office and collaborated with Ulmanis.

On 19 March 1936 Ulmanis&#x27; cabinet drafted a law that provided for Ulmanis to become State President as well as Prime Minister upon the expiration of Kviesis&#x27; term. This clearly violated the Constitution, which stipulated that the chairman of the Saeima would become acting president pending new elections. However, no one dared object. When Kviesis left office on 11 April 1936, Ulmanis combined the offices of president and prime minister.

== Authoritarian regime ==
The Ulmanis regime was unique among other European dictatorships of the interwar period. Ulmanis did not create a ruling party, rubber-stamp parliament or a new ideology. It was a nonpartisan, personal, and paternalistic dictatorship in which Ulmanis—who called himself &quot;the leader of the people&quot;—claimed to do what he thought was best for Latvians. All political life was proscribed, while culture and economy were eventually organized into a type of corporate statism made popular during those years by Mussolini. Chambers of Professions were created, similar to Chambers of Corporations in other dictatorships.

All political parties, including Ulmanis&#x27; own Farmers&#x27; Union, were outlawed. Part of the Latvian Constitution and civil liberties were suspended. All newspapers owned by political parties or organisations were closed and all publications were subjected to censorship and government oversight by the Ministry of Public Affairs led by Alfrēds Bērziņš. The army and the Aizsargi paramilitary were lavished with privileges.

Ulmanis is often believed to have been a popular leader especially among farmers and ethnic Latvians. This is debatable. His party had never won more than 17 percent of the vote in any election and had seen its support steadily decline in the years since the 1922 constitutional convention. In the 1931 election, the Farmers&#x27; Union only won 12.2 percent of the vote, an all-time low. Some historians believe that one of the chief motives for the coup was his fear of losing even more votes in the upcoming elections. From the time of his coup until his demise, for obvious reasons, no reliable voting or popularity statistics were available.

===Ideology===
Ulmanis was a Latvian nationalist, who espoused the slogan &quot;Latvia for Latvians&quot; which meant that Latvia was to be a Latvian nation state, not a multinational state with traditional Baltic German elites and Jewish entrepreneurial class. At the same time, the slogan &quot;Latvia&#x27;s sun shines equally over everyone&quot; was used and no ethnic group was actively targeted. A limited number of German, Jewish and other minority press and organizations continued to exist as far as the limitations of authoritarian dictatorship permitted. Yiddish newspapers were hit particularly hard. In practice only the religious party Agudat Israel&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Haint&quot; was not forbidden, while popular publications &quot;Dos Folk&quot;, &quot;Frimorgn&quot;, &quot;Riger Tog&quot;, and &quot;Naier Fraitik&quot; were closed. The official 1936 chamber of commerce list of newspapers and magazines does not list a single Yiddish, Hebrew or Jewish publication.

Latvianisation policies were followed in the area of education, cutting and removing subsidies for minority education. During Ulmanis&#x27; rule, education was strongly emphasized and literacy rates in Latvia reached high levels. Especially in eastern Latvia Latgale region however, education was actively used as a tool of assimilation of minorities. Many new schools were built, but they were Latvian schools and minority children were thus assimilated.

===Economy===

Economic historians are divided as whether Latvia experienced economic stagnation or prosperity during the Ulmanis regime. The state assumed a larger role in the economy and state capitalism was introduced by purchasing and uniting smaller competing private companies into larger state enterprises. This process was controlled by , a state bank established in 1935. Many large-scale building projects were undertaken—new schools, administrative buildings, Ķegums Hydroelectric Power Station. Due to an application of the economics of comparative advantage, the United Kingdom and Germany became Latvia&#x27;s major trade partners, while trade with the USSR was reduced. The economy, especially the agriculture and manufacturing sectors, was micromanaged to an extreme degree. Ulmanis nationalised many industries. This resulted in rapid economic growth, during which Latvia attained a very high standard of living. At a time when most of the world&#x27;s economy was still suffering from the effects of the Great Depression, Latvia could point to increases in both gross national product (GNP) and in exports of Latvian goods overseas. This, however, came at the cost of liberty and civil rights.

The policy of Ulmanis, even before his accession to power, was openly directed toward eliminating the minority groups from economic life and of giving Latvians of Latvian ethnicity access to all positions in the national economy. This was sometimes referred to as &quot;Lettization&quot;. According to some estimates, about 90% of the banks and credit establishments in Latvia were state-owned or under Latvian management in 1939, against 20% in 1933. Alfrēds Birznieks, the minister of agriculture, in a speech delivered in Ventspils on 26 January 1936, said:
As a result, the economic and cultural influence of minorities—Germans, Jews, Russians, Poles—declined.

Latvia&#x27;s first full-length sound movie &quot;&quot; (1939) was a tale of a young fisherman who tries to free other local fishermen from the power of a middleman and shows them that the future lies in cooperative work. The movie was based on a widely popular novel written by Vilis Lācis who in 1940 became the Prime Minister of the Soviet-occupied Latvian SSR.

== Later life and death ==
On 23 August 1939 Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Germany and Joseph Stalin&#x27;s USSR signed a non-aggression agreement, known as the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, which contained a secret addendum (revealed only in 1945), dividing Eastern Europe into spheres of influence. Latvia was thereby assigned to the Soviet sphere. Following a Soviet ultimatum in October 1939, Ulmanis signed the Soviet–Latvian Mutual Assistance Treaty and allowed the formation of Soviet military bases in Latvia. On 17 June 1940 Latvia was completely occupied by the Soviet Union. Rather than risk an unwinnable war, Ulmanis gave a nationwide radio address ordering no resistance to the Red Army, saying &quot;I will remain in my place and you remain in yours&quot;.

For the next month, Ulmanis cooperated with the Soviets. He resigned as prime minister three days after the coup, and appointed a left-wing government headed by Augusts Kirhenšteins—which, in truth, had been chosen by the Soviet embassy. Soviet-controlled elections for a &quot;People&#x27;s Saeima&quot; were held on 14–15 July, in which voters were presented with a single list from a Communist-dominated alliance. The new &quot;People&#x27;s Saeima&quot; met on 21 July with only one order of business—a resolution proclaiming Latvia a Soviet republic and seeking admission to the Soviet Union, which was carried unanimously. This move violated the Latvian Constitution, which stipulated that a major change to the basic constitutional order could only be enacted after two-thirds of the electorate approved it via a plebiscite. Since Latvia seceded from the Soviet Union in 1990, it has argued on that basis that the resolution seeking admission to the Soviet Union was illegal. It further maintains that the People&#x27;s Saeima was elected in accordance with an illegal and unconstitutional election law, rendering all of its acts void.
Also on 21 July, Ulmanis was forced to resign as president; Kirhenšteins took over the presidency and oversaw the final stages of integrating Latvia into the Soviet Union. Ulmanis asked the Soviet government for a pension and permission to emigrate to Switzerland. Instead, he was arrested and sent to Stavropol in Russian SFSR, where he worked in his original profession as an agronom for a year. After the start of Operation Barbarossa, he was imprisoned in July 1941. A year later, as German armies were closing in on Stavropol, he and other inmates were evacuated to prison in Krasnovodsk, Turkmen SSR (present-day Türkmenbaşy in Turkmenistan). On the way there, he contracted dysentery and soon died on 20 September 1942. For a long time, his burial place was unknown. In 2011 Georgian media reported that Ulmanis may be buried in Gori City Cemetery, according to a former gravedigger who claimed that he was convoyed by KGB officers and had to dig the grave for Ulmanis. However, in 2017, Ulmanis&#x27; grand-nephew, Guntis Ulmanis, announced that the search had been called off as it was apparent the site would be impossible to find.

== Later assessments ==

Kārlis Ulmanis&#x27;s legacy for Latvia and Latvians is a complex one. In the postwar Latvian SSR the Soviet régime labelled Ulmanis a fascist, indistinguishable from the Nazis, accusing him of corruption and of bloody repressions against Latvian workers.

Among the postwar Latvian émigrés of Latvian cultural background in exile, Ulmanis was idealised by many of those who viewed his 6-year authoritarian rule as a Golden Age of the Latvian nation. Some traditions created by Ulmanis, such as the so-called , a charitable donations to one&#x27;s former school, continued to be upheld.
In independent Latvia today, Ulmanis remains a popular, if also controversial figure. Many Latvians view him as a symbol of Latvia&#x27;s independence in pre-World War II Latvia, and historians are generally in agreement about his positive early role as prime minister during the country&#x27;s formative years. With regard to the authoritarian period, opinions diverge, however. On the one hand, it is possible to credit Ulmanis for the rise of ethnic Latvians&#x27; economic prosperity during the 1930s, and stress that under his rule there was not the same level of militarism or mass political oppression that characterized other dictatorships of the day. On the other hand, historians such as Ulmanis&#x27; biographer are of the view that someone who disbanded Parliament and adopted authoritarian rule cannot be regarded as a positive figure, even if that rule was in some terms a prosperous one.

One sign that Ulmanis was still very popular in Latvia during the first years of regained independence was the election of his grand-nephew Guntis Ulmanis as President of Latvia in 1993.

One of the major traffic routes in Riga, the capital of Latvia, is named after him (&quot;Kārļa Ulmaņa gatve&quot;, previously named after Ernst Thälmann). In 2003, a monument of Ulmanis was unveiled in a park in Riga centre.

==Personal life and family==
Not much is known about the personal life of Ulmanis. It is known that he never married and there are no records of him dating anyone. When once asked about why he was not married or did not have a significant other, his response was &quot;I am married to Latvia, and that is enough for me.&quot; During his lifetime, there were rumors over his sexuality, with some claims that he might have been homosexual. The rumors were fueled by Ulmanis&#x27; close relationships with two of his male employees, as well as Ulmanis himself not giving any information about his personal life. He did not have any offspring, although his brother did, with Ulmanis&#x27; grandnephew Guntis Ulmanis later becoming the president of Latvia.

<text>Bangladesh observes numerous public holidays, which include national memorials, religious celebrations, and secular holidays of Bengali origin. The Bengali traditional calendar, known as Baṅgābda, is both the national and official calendar of the country.

Holidays in Bangladesh are celebrated according to various calendars, depending on the occasion. Religious festivals such as Eid are based on the Islamic calendar, while other national holidays are observed according to the Bengali and Gregorian calendars. Since the Islamic calendar is lunar, it does not remain synchronized with the seasons, resulting in a seasonal drift. Consequently, some public holidays, particularly those tied to Islamic events, shift each year based on the lunar cycle.

There are fifteen public holidays in Bangladesh. Muslims and non-Muslims have four religious holidays each in addition to the seven secular national holidays. For the Muslims, nine major Islamic holidays: Ashura, Mawlid, Isra&#x27; and Mi&#x27;raj, Shab-e-Barat, first day of Ramadan, Revelation of the Quran, Laylat al-Qadr, Eid ul-Fitr and Eid ul-Adha are observed. For the Hindus: Holi, Krishna Janmashtami, Durga Puja, Diwali and Raksha Bandhan are celebrated. As for the Christians: New Year, Good Friday, Easter Saturday, Easter Sunday, Halloween, Christmas Eve, Christmas, Boxing Day, St. Patrick&#x27;s Day and New Year&#x27;s Eve are celebrated. Buddhists: Vesak and Chinese New Year are celebrated.

<text>was a town located in Minamiuwa District, Ehime Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2005, the town had an estimated population of 2787 and a density of 127.79 persons per km2. The total area was 21.81 km2.

On October 1, 2004, Nishiumi, along with the towns of Ipponmatsu, Jōhen and Mishō, and the village of Uchiumi (all from Minamiuwa District), was merged to create the town of Ainan.

Though now part of Ainan, Nishiumi itself consisted of many individual villages (localities/hamlets) including Fukuura, Funakoshi, Nishiura, and Sotodomari, among others. 

The industry in Nishiumi consists primarily of fishing and agriculture, producing things such as bonito and mikan oranges.

==Geography and climate==

Nishiumi&#x27;s name literally translates to West sea, which is fitting because the area is a peninsula that juts off the south-western edge of Ehime and into the Pacific Ocean. The geography of Nishiumi is dominated by mountains and inlets, most of which are covered by forest and jungle. Nishiumi lies in Japan&#x27;s humid subtropical region and has a particularly mild winter, rarely seeing any snow. However, it is known for having very strong winter winds which blow off the ocean.

==Tourism==

Notable destinations in Nishiumi district include Kashima island which is part of Ashizuri-Uwakai national park, Cape Komo, a scenic overlook, and the town of Sotodomari, which is known for its terraced stone walls.

<text>Anatoly Yuriyovych Onoprienko (; , Anatoly Yuryevich Onoprienko; 25 July 1959 – 27 August 2013) was a Soviet and Ukrainian serial killer and mass murderer. Known by the nicknames The Beast of Ukraine, The Terminator, and Citizen O, Onoprienko confessed to killing fifty-two people upon being apprehended in April 1996.

== Early life ==
Anatoly Onoprienko was born in the village of Lasky in Zhytomyr Oblast, Ukrainian SSR, Soviet Union. He was the younger of two sons; his brother, Valentin, was thirteen years older. His father, Yuri Onoprienko, was decorated for bravery while serving on the Eastern Front during the Second World War. 

Onoprienko&#x27;s mother died when he was four years old. He was cared for by his grandparents and aunt for a time before being handed over to an orphanage in the village of Pryvitne, Volyn Oblast. According to Onoprienko, he resented the fact that he had been given away by his father, while his brother continued to stay under his care. In one interview, he later alleged that it was this that predetermined his destiny, and remarked that seventy per cent of those brought up in orphanages end up in prison as adults.

== Victims ==
When finally arrested by police, Onoprienko was found to be in possession of a total of 122 items, including a sawed-off TOZ-34 shotgun, a number of other weapons which matched those used in several killings, and a number of items which had been removed from victims. He eventually confessed to eight killings between 1989 and 1995. He initially denied other charges but ultimately confessed to the killing of fifty-two victims over a six-year period. While in custody, Onoprienko claimed that he killed in response to commands he was given by inner voices.

These are the following murders confessed by Onoprienko, in chronological order:

1–10. In 1989, a family of ten two adults and eight children were killed during an attempted robbery. Onoprienko confessed that he and an accomplice, Sergei Rogozin, committed the murders with weapons that they carried for self-defense. He also stated that he cut off all contact with Rogozin afterwards.

11–15. In that same year, five people, including an 11-year-old boy, were shot dead while sleeping in a car before their bodies were burned. Onoprienko stated that the murders were unintentional and that he had planned only to burglarize the car.

16–19. On 24 December 1995, the Zaichenko family of four were killed with a sawed-off double-barreled shotgun during a robbery in their home at Garmarnia, a village in central Ukraine, which was set ablaze afterwards.

20–24. On 2 January 1996, a family of four were shot and killed. The murders were quickly followed by that of a male pedestrian whom Onoprienko killed in order to eliminate potential witnesses.

25–28. On 6 January 1996, Onoprienko allegedly killed four people in three separate incidents on the Berdyansk-Dnieprovs&#x27;k highway, by stopping cars before killing the drivers. The victims were Kasai, a Ukrainian Navy ensign; Savitsky, a taxi driver; Kochergina, a kolkhoz cook; and an unidentified victim.

29–35. On 17 January 1996, the Pilat family of five were shot and killed in their home, which was then set ablaze. Two potential witnesses were then killed, a 27-year-old railroad worker named Kondzela and a 56-year-old pedestrian named Zakharko.

36–39. On 30 January 1996, Marusina, her two sons, and a 32-year-old visitor named Zagranichniy were all shot dead in the Fastiv, Kyiv Oblast, region of Ukraine.

40–43. On 19 February 1996, the Dubchak family were killed in their home in Olevsk, Zhytomyr Oblast. According to Onoprienko, he shot and killed the father and the son, mauled the mother to death with a hammer, and demanded money from the daughter before mauling her to death as well when she refused.

44–48. On 27 February 1996, the Bodnarchuk family were killed in their home in Malyn, Lviv Oblast. According to Onoprienko, he fatally shot the parents and then hacked the daughters, aged seven and eight, to death with an axe. An hour later, Onoprienko then allegedly shot and killed a neighbouring businessman named Tsalk who was wandering around the Bodnarchuk property, hacking his corpse with the axe afterwards.

49–52. On 22 March 1996, the Novosad family of four was Onoprienko&#x27;s last alleged victims. According to him, he shot and killed all of the family members and set their home on fire to eliminate any traces of evidence.

== Methods ==
Onoprienko&#x27;s &quot;modus operandi&quot; consisted of choosing an isolated house and gaining the attention of the occupants by creating a commotion. He would kill all occupants starting with the adult male, before going to find and kill the spouse and finally the children. He would then usually set the buildings alight in an attempt to cover the evidence. He would also kill any potential witness who crossed his path during his murderous rampages.

== Capture and conviction ==
In March 1996, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office specialists detained 26-year-old Yury Mozola as a suspect in several brutal murders. Over the course of three days, six SBU members and one representative of the Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office tortured Mozola. Mozola refused to confess to the crimes and died during the torture. Seven responsible for the death were sentenced to prison terms. Seventeen days later, the real murderer, Onoprienko, was found after a massive manhunt, seven years after his first murder. This happened after he moved in with one of his relatives and his stash of weapons was discovered. Onoprienko was forced to leave the house. Days later, from the information received, Onoprienko was captured.

Onoprienko was sentenced to death, but had his sentence commuted to life imprisonment; in 1995 Ukraine had entered the Council of Europe and thus (at the time) it undertook to abolish capital punishment.

== Death ==
Onoprienko died in Zhytomyr prison on 27 August 2013, at the age of 54.

<text>is a town and port in Shōzu District, Kagawa, Japan, with a population of 12,915. The town lies on the west coast of the island of Shōdoshima—the second-largest island in the Seto Inland Sea—and it is the main passenger access for the island. First settled around the 8th century, the town center grew into a complex maze of streets during the war-torn Muromachi period (1336–1573) to inhibit enemy forces. The town was officially incorporated in 1898, and today sesame oil, olives, &quot;sōmen&quot; noodles, fishing and tourism are important industries.

The town&#x27;s jurisdiction totals 74.38 km2, covering historic Tonoshō and smaller settlements on western Shōdoshima, as well as Teshima, Odeshima, and other nearby islands.

The town is known as the setting of the manga and anime &quot;Teasing Master Takagi-san&quot; and is the creator&#x27;s hometown. Tonoshō also participates in the regional Setouchi Triennale art festival, and several art installations are found in the area.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Tonoshō has roughly halved over the past half-century.

== Notable locations ==
Modern Tonoshō includes all of western Shodoshima, Teshima, and surrounding islands.
* Angel Road, a 500-meter-long sandbar that appears during low tide, connecting Shodoshima with a series of small islets
*Chōshi Gorge
*Dofuchi Strait, the narrowest strait in the world

<text>is a port and former town, now a part of Shōdoshima Town, Kagawa Prefecture, Japan. It is located midway along the south coast of Shōdoshima, the second-largest island in the Seto Inland Sea. The port is one of three on the island with passenger service to Takamatsu, the prefecture capital.

The community was designated a village in 1889, upgraded to a town in 1929, and merged with the villages of Nibu and Mito in 1954. In 2006, as part of nationwide mergers, Ikeda and the town of Uchinomi (both from Shōzu District) were merged to create the new town of Shōdoshima. Ikeda is no longer an independent municipality.

<doc id="494448" wikidata="Q2164222" url="?curid=494448" title="Rollins College">
<text>Rollins College is a private liberal arts college in Winter Park, Florida. It was founded in November 1885 and has about 30 undergraduate majors and several master&#x27;s programs. Florida&#x27;s fourth oldest post-secondary institution, it has an approximate enrollment of 3,000 students, composed of roughly 2,500 undergraduates and 500 postgraduates.

==History==
Rollins College is Florida&#x27;s fourth oldest post-secondary institution, and has been independent, nonsectarian, and coeducational from conception. Lucy Cross, founder of the Daytona Institute for Young Women in 1880, first placed the matter of establishing a college in Florida before the Congregational Churches in 1884. In 1885, the church put her on the committee in charge of determining the location of their first college in Florida. Cross is known as the &quot;Mother of Rollins College.&quot; Rollins was incorporated, organized, and named in the Lyman Park building in nearby Sanford, Florida, on April 28, 1885, opening for classes in Winter Park on November 4 of that year. It was established by New England Congregationalists who sought to bring their style of liberal arts education to the frontier St. John&#x27;s basin. A commemorative plaque listing the names of the founders was dedicated 1 March 1954 and is displayed in historic Downtown Sanford.

Early benefactors of Rollins College included Chicago businessman Alonzo Rollins (1832-1887), for whom the college is named. Rollins made substantial donations to enable the founding of the college, and was a trustee and its first treasurer.

Another early benefactor was Franklin Fairbanks of St. Johnsbury, Vermont. Fairbanks was president of the family business, Fairbanks Scales, and was a founder of Winter Park, a donor to Rollins College and a trustee.

In March of 1936 during a visit to Central Florida, U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt was conferred an honorary degree in literature at the Knowles Chapel on campus. Other U.S. presidents who have visited the campus include Calvin Coolidge (1930), Harry Truman (1949), Ronald Reagan (1976; prior to his 1980 election), and Barack Obama (2012).

===Firing of John Andrew Rice and required loyalty pledge===
President Hamilton Holt decided to require all professors to make a &quot;loyalty pledge&quot; to keep their jobs. In March 1933, Holt fired John Andrew Rice, an atheist scholar and unorthodox teacher, whom Holt had hired, along with three other &quot;golden personalities&quot; (as Holt called them), in his push to put Rollins on the cutting edge of innovative education, for refusing to sign the loyalty pledge. The American Association of University Professors censured Rollins. The widely publicized case was investigated by the American Association of University Professors, and it is known as the &quot;Rollins College Case&quot; among historians of tenure. The four fired faculty quickly founded experimental Black Mountain College, with a gift from a former Rollins College faculty member.

===Okinawa statue===
In October 1994, the school made international headlines when the government of Japan, per the request of its Okinawa Prefecture, asked for the return of a statue that was taken as war loot after the Battle of Okinawa in 1945 by Clinton C. Nichols, at that time, a lieutenant commander in the United States Navy and a Rollins alumnus. Nichols had presented the statue of Ninomiya Sontoku, a prominent 19th-century Japanese agricultural leader, philosopher, moralist, and economist, to then-President Hamilton Holt, who promised to keep the statue permanently in the main lobby of the Warren Administration Building. At first, the school rejected the offer made by Okinawan officials, who suggested that a replica of the statue will be presented to the school if the original was returned to the island. After consulting both with the U.S. State Department and the school&#x27;s board of trustees, then-President Rita Bornstein accepted the offer and the statue was returned to Okinawa in 1995 in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II. In addition to providing the school with a replica of the original statue, the government of Okinawa and Rollins signed &quot;an agreement of cooperation&quot; that pledges to develop additional cooperative projects between the college and Shogaku Junior and Senior High School, the Okinawan school where the original statue has been placed.

===Kairis case===
On March 31, 1998, the body of Jennifer Leah Kairis, a sophomore student, was found in her Ward Hall dormitory room by a residential assistant. Kairis, who had attended a fraternity party held by the Tau Kappa Epsilon chapter on campus hours before she had died, was both legally intoxicated and had a large amount of prescription drugs in her system. At first, the assistant medical examiner at the Orange County coroner&#x27;s office ruled Kairis&#x27; death as a homicide. However, that conclusion was quickly changed after Shashi Gore, the county&#x27;s chief medical examiner ruled that she had died as a result of an accidental prescription drug overdose. Kairis&#x27; parents, who always believed their daughter was raped and murdered by her college boyfriend, requested a lengthy state investigation into their daughter&#x27;s death due to their belief that the Winter Park Police Department botched the case. On March 4, 2004, Bruce Hyma, the Miami-Dade County chief medical examiner and expert toxicologist hired by State Attorney Lawson Lamar ruled that Kairis had committed suicide via a prescription drug overdose. The seven-year investigation was officially closed on April 13, 2005. Regardless of the investigation&#x27;s outcome, the Kairis family asked then Governor Jeb Bush to bring in an outside medical examiner to take another look at the case and autopsy results and order an independent investigation of their daughter&#x27;s death to resolve what they called the &quot;Dueling Medical Examiners&quot;.

===Security measures===
In September 2011, as a result of robbery suspects&#x27; use of the campus to hide from law enforcement officers as well as the armed robbery of two students who were sitting in a car outside their dormitory within one week, the college&#x27;s administration initiated discussions on new security measures. Some measures included blocking or limiting access to four of the school&#x27;s entrances and installing new security cameras to assure student and faculty safety on campus. On January 7, 2014, a full-scale drill with armed police officers was held to make sure the college was ready in the event a hostile incident was to take place on campus. In October 2014, school officials alerted the student body of four incidents at one of its public parking garages near the campus where female students were threatened by a male aggressor.

==Campus==
The campus contains a range of amenities, including a theater for performing arts; the Cornell Campus Center; and the Alfond Sports Center. The college is located in a picturesque setting in Winter Park, FL right across from Park Avenue.

=== Architecture ===
The Rollins campus is well known for its highly decorative Spanish and Mediterranean Revival style architecture. According to College Historian and Professor Emeritus Jack C. Lane, the Spanish-Mediterranean style blended best with the natural environment of Florida, and that Rollins 8th president Hamilton Holt felt &quot;the college&#x27;s unified curriculum should be reflected in the architectural style.&quot; Lane goes on to state that Rollins&#x27; campus architecture has stayed consistent since its opening, and that &quot;the college has been extremely fortunate to have leaders who recognized the significance of architectural style for the educational process. By making certain that new buildings retained a harmony of design, these leaders left present and future generations a deeply profound legacy: architectural beauty and unity create a spiritual sense of place that inspires the entire educational and social life of a college.&quot;

===Pugsley Hall &amp; Mayflower Hall===
In 1930, President Holt announced the gifts of Cornelius Pugsley and an anonymous donor for the construction of two women&#x27;s dormitories, with their interiors designed by Virginia Huntington Robie. Pugsley and Mayflower Halls were dedicated in 1931. Mayflower Hall received its name from the Pilgrim ship. The Society of Friends at Chalfont St. Giles, Buckinghamshire, gave Rollins a 16-inch section of beam from the ship, which, it had been discovered, had been salvaged to build a haybarn in England. The block of wood was placed above the fireplace in Mayflower Hall. Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity moved into Pugsley Hall in 1997 and have occupied it all but one academic year since. In the 1990s, there were rows of shrubbery on either side of the sidewalk leading up to Pugsley Hall, which sits at the end of Park Avenue.

===Chase Hall===
Chase Hall was built in 1908. It was first used as a men&#x27;s dormitory until 1966. From 1966 until 1999 it was used by the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity, followed by the Phi Delta Theta fraternity. The Lucy Cross Center for Women and Their Allies was established in 2010 at Rollins College in Chase Hall, Room 205. The center is named after Lucy Cross, the &quot;Mother of Rollins College&quot; (see above).&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.rollins.edu/lucycross&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross Hall===
Cross Hall is named after Lucy Cross, the &quot;Mother of Rollins College&quot; (see above).

=== Hooker Hall ===
Hooker Hall was named after, the first president of Rollins College, Edward Payson Hooker (1838-1904). The building was originally used as housing for the Theta Kappa Nu fraternity then, in 1939, the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity moved in. Hooker was a Chi Psi at Middlebury College (Mu &#x27;54) and played an integral part in bringing the Chi Psi chapter, Alpha Mu Delta, to Rollins in 1977. Today, Hooker Hall is home to the Chi Psi fraternity, and is known to many faculty and students as The Chi Psi Lodge.

===Pinehurst Cottage===
The Rollins College website states that Pinehurst Cottage and Knowles I, the two structures established when the college founded, suffered a fire in 1909 which destroyed Knowles Hall and scorched Pinehurst&#x27;s exterior. Pinehurst, originally a women&#x27;s residence hall, over the years transformed into a men&#x27;s dormitory, co-ed dormitory, the home of President Ward, a Library, chemistry lab, infirmary and then classroom. In November 1985, Pinehurst received Winter Park&#x27;s Historic Preservation Commission&#x27;s Historic Landmark award. The college renovated to maintain the building&#x27;s original appearance. Today, Pinehurst is a co-ed residence hall that houses a special interest group which promotes academic fulfillment outside the classroom.

===Alfond Boathouse===
Built in 1988 to fulfill the Rollins College waterski and sailing teams&#x27; needs. The Alfond Boathouse sits on lake Virginia and has a total of 3 offices used by the waterski and sailing coaches, as well as a classroom, boat bay and observation deck. The exterior was renovated in 2016.

===Peace Monument===
Erected in 1938 and dedicated on Armistice Day by college president Hamilton Holt, it consists of a German artillery shell, surrendered by Germany at the end of the First World War, mounted on a pedestal, bearing this inscription:

:Pause, passerby and hang your head in shame

:This Engine of Destruction, Torture and Death Symbolizes:
:The Prostitution of the Inventor
:The Avarice of the Manufacturer
:The Blood-guilt of the statesman
:The Savagery of the Soldier
:The Perverted Patriotism of the Citizen
:The Debasement of the Human Race

:That it can be Employed as an Instrument of Defense of Liberty, Justice and Right in Nowise Invalidates the Truth of the Words Here Graven.

::—Hamilton Holt

The top half of the monument was stolen by vandals during World War II, but the plaque from the bottom half survives and is in the stairwell leading to the second floor of the Mills Memorial building.

In 2000, the Rollins College&#x27;s Peace Monument was featured in a &quot;New York Times&quot; article.

===Winter Park Institute===
The Winter Park Institute, located in the Osceola Lodge on Interlachen Avenue, brings scholars, leaders, and artists from diverse fields of disciplines and expertise to the Rollins campus for symposiums, seminars, lectures, interviews, exhibits, readings, and master classes that are always free and open to the public. Following the legacy began by President Hamilton Holt and continued by President Hugh McKean, the Institute launched in the fall of 2008, the first guest being U.S. poet laureate Billy Collins, who has returned every year since. Other guests include Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Ken Burns, Gloria Steinem, Jane Goodall, Paul Simon, Itzhak Perlman, Nicholas Kristof, Sheryl Wu Dunn, Jane Pauley, and most recently, Sir Paul McCartney.

Rollins&#x27; Olin Library was dedicated in 1985, with a US$4.7 million grant from the F.W. Olin Foundation ($ today). It is four stories high, with containing thousands of volumes, periodicals, serials, electronic resources, a number of special collections, and hundreds of compact discs, DVDs, and videotapes. From 1909 until 2011, the library was a federal government documents repository. Olin still provides access to hundreds of online government resources. Olin Library was one of three recipients of the 2013 ACRL Excellence in Academic Libraries Award.

In 2021, Olin Library collaborated with Rollins&#x27; Department of Art &amp; Art History and the Rollins Museum of Art to establish the Rollins Book Arts Collection, an interdisciplinary teaching collection, directly supporting the college&#x27;s curriculum and its long tradition of liberal education. The purpose of the collection is to use art as a medium through which students can better understand multifaceted issues — global politics, economies, cultures; the tensions around social structures and marginalized populations; conflicts between human development and the environment; art as a concept, expression, and a communication tool; and other contemporary issues that students will encounter in their coursework and everyday lives. It can be accessed in the reading room of Olin Library&#x27;s Archives and Special Collections.

====Olin Electronic Research and Information Center====
The Olin Electronic Research and Information Center was also established in 1998 with a second gift of US$2.7 million from the F.W. Olin Foundation ($ today). The center features the latest technology, including computer stations, color printers, scanners, audio and video digitizers, compact discs, videodiscs, and videotapes. These tools facilitate creativity as students pursue research questions, prepare multimedia presentations, and create Web pages.

====Origins as a &quot;Carnegie Library&quot;====
Olin Libraries&#x27; collection is one of the oldest and most extensive in Central Florida, dating back (1909-1951) to its Carnegie Library founding as one of the original 14 Florida libraries funded by Andrew Carnegie. The original collection, at the founding of Rollins College in 1885, consisted of one Christian Bible and one dictionary. According to Cohen (2006), Carnegie&#x27;s &quot;donation of 108 libraries to colleges in the first two decades of the twentieth century assisted 10% of the institutions of higher learning in the United States. Carnegie had a preference for colleges and universities that served African-American students, which Rollins College president William Fremont Blackman noted the school did in a letter to Carnegie appealing for a library in 1904:

Blackman&#x27;s request consisted of $35,000 in total ($ today): &quot;$20,000 for a fireproof building, $3,000 for books, and $12,000 as an endowment for the continued purchase of books&quot; ($, $ and $ today respectively). Blackman received a response from Carnegie&#x27;s secretary James Bertram that noted the request was too general for consideration, and that Carnegie would need a profile of the university before consideration. Little progress was made for over a year, when Blackman again wrote to Carnegie, noting the university&#x27;s need for a library. Trustees and friends of the university wrote to Carnegie on Blackman&#x27;s behalf, including W.W. Cummer, a trustee from Jacksonville who served on the board of the city&#x27;s new Carnegie Library. A letter dated 22 June 1905 and written from Carnegie&#x27;s home in Scotland brought the welcome news of the offer of a library. Carnegie offered $20,000 ($ today) for the construction of a library provided that the same amount would be raised for the library&#x27;s upkeep. While grateful for Carnegie&#x27;s proposal, Blackman was uneasy with its terms because the amount of funding required to match Carnegie&#x27;s offer would put a strain on those who had donated to start the college&#x27;s endowment fund of $200,000 as well as paid a debt of $30,000 ($ combined today). In correspondence to Bertram dated July 11, 1905, Blackman wrote (according to Cohen):

In a January 1906 letter Blackman wrote to Carnegie expressing concern about meeting the conditions for the gift, noting that the college had a large debt that took &quot;considerable self-sacrifice on the part of our friends&quot;. That summer, another Florida college, Stetson University, was awarded $40,000 ($ today) for a library from Carnegie. Upon learning this Blackman again wrote to Carnegie, seeking to amend the original terms of the agreement to match the amount that Stetson was awarded. He was turned down, but a year later was able to notify Carnegie that the school&#x27;s trustees had been able to match the $20,000 necessary for the gift to be awarded. Bertram wrote to Blackman to inform him that Carnegie had &quot;authorized his Cashier...to arrange payments on Library Building, as work progresses, to the extent of Twenty Thousand Dollars.&quot; ($ today) The library, to be named Carnegie Hall, was dedicated on February 18, 1909.

The building had over 8,000 square feet of space, and was the school&#x27;s first dedicated library building. It served as a library from 1909 until 1951. In addition to its function as a library, Carnegie Hall also served as the school&#x27;s post office. Since the library was moved from Carnegie to the newly built Mills Memorial Library, it has also housed a bookstore, admissions office, faculty offices, and human resources office.

===Archibald Granville Bush Science Center===
The Bush Science Center at Rollins has state of the art SMART classrooms, faculty offices, and 38 teaching and research laboratories for the physical and behavioral sciences, mathematics, and computer science. The science center is where Donald J. Cram launched his chemical studies, becoming the 1987 Nobel Prize winner in Chemistry. Construction of the redesign of the Archibald Granville Bush Science Center began in the spring of 2012 and was completed prior to the beginning of the fall 2013 semester. The science center, which has 103,580 square feet and cost $30 million to upgrade ($ today), is now the largest building at Rollins. It has three floors and includes 51 offices, 15 classrooms, 15 teaching labs, 19 research labs and 18 student/faculty lounges.

===Rollins Museum of Art===
The Cornell Fine Arts Museum is located on school grounds and contains works of art and objects from antiquity to the 21st century. The museum was built instead of what would have been the Ackland Art Museum at Rollins; millionaire and amateur art collector William Hayes Ackland (1855-1940) wanted to leave his fortune to a Southern university for an art museum and narrowed his choices to Duke University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Rollins, in that order. After Ackland&#x27;s death, Duke refused the request, and UNC and Rollins, excised from Ackland&#x27;s final will, both brought suit to locate Ackland&#x27;s museum on their campuses. In a case that went to the United States Supreme Court, Ackland&#x27;s trustees sided with UNC, but a lower court ruled for Rollins; a higher court finally granted the bequest to UNC. Rollins was represented in the case by former U.S. attorney general Homer Cummings.

===Annie Russell Theatre===
The Annie Russell Theatre is a historic theater in Winter Park, Florida, located on the premises of Rollins College. The theatre was named after the English-born actress Annie Russell in 1931, who taught at Rollins until she died of lung disease in 1936. It was designed by the architect Richard Kiehnel of Kiehnel and Elliott. In October 1998, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

===Knowles Memorial Chapel===

The Knowles Memorial Chapel is a historic chapel on the Rollins campus. In February 1998, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.

Ground was broken for the chapel on March 9, 1931, and the cornerstone was laid on May 12 of the same year. The dedication service for the chapel took place just a year later on March 29, 1932. Though founded by a Congregational Church educational committee, Rollins has no religious affiliation, so the chapel is interdenominational. A Protestant service is held on Sunday mornings, and Catholic Mass is held on Sunday evenings.

A highlight of the chapel is a circular window of the seven liberal arts designed by Ralph Adams Cram and William Herbert Burnham.

===Walk of Fame===
The Rollins Walk of Fame, which circles Mills lawn, consists of stones taken from places connected to historic people. Past college president Hamilton Holt came up with the idea in the 1920s, and based the Walk of Fame on the &quot;ancestral walk&quot; at his home in Connecticut. The idea, Holt wrote, was &quot;unique in conception and execution&quot;.

Holt officially dedicated the Walk of Fame in October 1929, originally calling it the Memorial Path of Fame. Holt presented 22 stones, including stones from the homes of American luminaries George Washington, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Daniel Webster, Calvin Coolidge, and Ralph Waldo Emerson. Early additions to the Walk of Fame were predominantly American, but later additions would include stones from places associated with internationally famous figures as diverse as St. Augustine, Emperor Humayun, and William Wordsworth. By 1932 the Walk of Fame had over 200 stones, many of which Holt himself had brought back to campus: the Charles Dickens stone he had picked up while visiting Gad&#x27;s Hill, and he claimed that the Mohammed stone was brought back from Mecca by a student&#x27;s sister, &quot;at the risk of fine and imprisonment&quot;.

After Holt retired as president of the college in 1949, there no longer existed a central authority for the Walk of Fame, and over the next two decades stones began to disappear, often around graduation time; many were thrown into Lake Virginia. Only in the 1980s, under the presidency of Thaddeus Seymour (president from 1978 to 1990), was there an Official Lapidarian responsible for taking care of the stones. As of 2003, the Walk of Fame had about 530 stones, the vast majority (455) honoring men. Most stones are associated with specific people, but a few—like the stones from Australia and the Berlin Wall—honor places or events.

===College of Arts and Sciences===

In 2010, the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Professional Studies have a total of 1,884 students and a student to faculty ratio of 10 to 1.

===Crummer Graduate School of Business===
The Rollins College Crummer Graduate School of Business offers a Masters in Business Administration (MBA) through three different programs:

* The Early Advantage MBA Program is a full-time day program designed for recent college graduates with little to no work experience. Students can complete the program within 16 to 21 months. 
* The Professional MBA Program is a 24-27-month program designed for students with a wide range of educational and professional experience. 
* The Executive MBA Program is designed for mid-to senior-level professionals who prefer a blend of online and Saturday classes. It can be completed in 15 months.

The Rollins MBA programs are listed in several national rankings of business schools, including:
*&quot;Forbes&quot;: 44th in the Nation (2017)
*&quot;Leadership Excellence&quot;: #1 in Florida (2018)

As of 2018, the Rollins Full-Time and Part-Time MBA programs are listed as Rank Not Published, or &quot;RNP&quot;.
The bottom quarter of rank-eligible full-time MBA programs are listed as Rank Not Published.
Rank Not Published means that U.S. News calculated a numerical rank for that program but decided for editorial reasons not to publish it.

The Rollins MBA is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business.

===Hamilton Holt School===
Adult education courses at Rollins were initially only offered to returning World War II veterans. On September 7, 1960, the executive committee of the Board of Trustees of Rollins College gave formal authorization for the Institute for General Studies to award degrees upon completion of program requirements. On November 6, 1987, the school&#x27;s name was changed to The Hamilton Holt School, in honor of Rollins&#x27; eighth president.

The Hamilton Holt School offers Bachelor of Arts degrees in a variety of majors as well as several graduate degrees. Its focus is on the non-traditional student, identified as a working individual seeking professional advancement and therefore schedules most courses in the evenings and on weekends.

===Special programs===

====Rollins College Conference (RCC)====
The Rollins College Conference, taken in the first semester of a student&#x27;s freshman year, is required of all non-transfer students in the College of Arts and Sciences. The course serves as both an orientation course and a topic course in a student&#x27;s area of interest. The professor for this course will serve as the enrolled students&#x27; academic advisor until they select a major and choose a new advisor from the corresponding department. One or two peer mentors (upperclassmen with special training) join the course and offer counseling and support to the new students.

====Honors Degree Program====
The Honors Degree Program allows the top students in each entering class of the College of Arts and Sciences to complete a series of special interdisciplinary seminars, which replace approximately two-thirds of the school&#x27;s general education requirements. To earn an honors degree, students must also complete a thesis in their major field during their junior and senior years.

====Accelerated Management Program (AMP)====
The Accelerated Management Program allows selected students to earn both a BA from the College of Arts and Sciences and an MBA from the Crummer Graduate School of Business in a total of five years. Students enrolled in this program must complete all general education and major/minor requirements prior to the conclusion of their third year. In their fourth year, students take courses from the Early Advantage MBA program, from which credits are applied to both their undergraduate and graduate transcripts. Upon completion of the fourth year, AMP students graduate from the College of Arts and Sciences and walk with their class at commencement. In the fifth year, students complete the MBA degree and graduate a second time.

====International programs====
All three schools at Rollins offer international courses to destinations such as London, Sydney, and Madrid, among others. Some programs are offered directly through Rollins, while others are offered through partnerships with other colleges and universities. Students may study abroad for a week or an entire semester.

==Athletics==
Rollins participates in NCAA Division II&#x27;s Sunshine State Conference for the majority of its sports; the college&#x27;s women&#x27;s lacrosse program competes as a DII independent program.

The rowing teams compete in the Southern Intercollegiate Rowing Association and Florida Intercollegiate Rowing Association while the sailing squad competes in the South Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association. The Rollins water skiing teams compete in NCAA Division I, the only school program to do so. Rollins&#x27; athletic teams are called the Tars (an archaic name for a sailor). 

Rollins&#x27; Athletic Tradition includes 23 National Championships and 67 Sunshine State Conference titles. The school sponsors twenty-three varsity teams: The most successful sport in the history of Rollins is Women&#x27;s Golf. They have 13 national championship titles. In 1950 and 1956, Betty Rowland and Marlene Stewart Streit, respectively, won the women&#x27;s individual intercollegiate golf championship (an event conducted by the Division of Girls&#x27; and Women&#x27;s Sports (DGWS) — which later evolved into the current NCAA women&#x27;s golf championship). In later years, Bettina Walker (1988, 1989), Debbie Pappas (1990, 1991, 1992), Mariana De Biase (2006) and Joanna Coe (2008) also became individual national champions at the Small College and NCAA Division II levels.

==Campus life==
Rollins College is located in Winter Park, a few minutes from downtown Orlando. There are more than 150 student clubs and organizations on campus, including a wakeboard club and ballroom dance club. The Tars, Rollins&#x27;s athletic teams, compete in the NCAA Division II Sunshine State Conference and field a varsity waterskiing team among others. A sizeable Greek life on campus comprises more than 10 fraternities and sororities. About 75 percent of students live on campus in one of the residence halls or apartment complexes. In addition, there are weekly shuttles, &quot;Rolly Trolly&quot;, to provide transport to a shopping area for the students.

=== Fox Day ===
Fox Day is an annual tradition at Rollins. Since 1956 (except during the tenure of President Jack Critchfield, 1969–1978), each spring, the president cancels all classes, providing undergraduate students with a surprise day off to explore local beaches and amusement parks, together as a college, returning in the late afternoon for a barbecue. It&#x27;s known as Fox Day, because a statue of a fox is placed on Mills Lawn (the school&#x27;s main lawn), signifying the day off.

The fox statue, originally accompanied with a cat statue were a gift from Senator Murray Sams in 1934 to President Hamilton Holt as he thought it would be &quot;fittingly enshrined&quot; at Rollins. They originally came from France, and believed to be satirical pieces, depicting, &quot;the Populace (Cat) making his sweeping bow in hypocritical salute to the Papacy (Fox). The statues were placed on pedestals near the old Recreational Hall which is now replaced by the pool. Holt created a &quot;Cat Society&quot; for women and a &quot;Fox Society&quot; for men, these groups consisted of four people each, selected by an annual vote by the opposite gender of the student body for the opposite group. The statues were only allowed to be touched by the respective privileged members. Occasionally, the statues were taken and hidden as practical jokes. However, the cat statue had been mysteriously destroyed in 1949 with the location of the remains unknown. Since then, the fox is hidden and only brought out for Fox Day.

During Fox Day season 2015, a petition was widely circulated to include Holt and Crummer students in the popular tradition. Currently, these students are not excused from classes, limiting their involvement in the annual festivities; furthering the disconnect between the evening and graduate students on campus. In March 2020, the campus shut down and sent students home as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in no Fox Day occurrence during the 2019–2020 academic year.

===Winter Park Bach Festival===
Since 1935, the Winter Park Bach Festival, the third-oldest continuously operating Bach festival in the United States, has brought some of the highest caliber of classical performers from around the world to campus, for a two-week event. The 150-voice Bach Festival Society is regarded as one of the finest oratorio societies in America.

===WPRK 91.5 &quot;The Best in Basement Radio&quot;===
WPRK 91.5 FM &quot;the Best in Basement Radio&quot; is a non-commercial college radio station located in Winter Park, Florida, owned and operated by Rollins College. Its signal is audible in most of the Orlando metropolitan area, or &quot;from Seaworld to Sanford&quot; as said by DJs on-air.

==Notable alumni==
==In popular culture==
After a speaking appearance at Rollins in 1988, Kurt Vonnegut used it as one of the models for the school in &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; in which Rollins is the former place of employment of the fictional school&#x27;s president.

<text>Public holidays in Thailand are regulated by the government, and most are observed by both the public and private sectors. There are usually nineteen public holidays in a year, but more may be declared by the cabinet. Other observances, both official and non-official, local and international, are observed to varying degrees throughout the country.

All public holidays are observed by government agencies, while the Bank of Thailand regulates bank holidays, which differ slightly from those observed by the government. Private businesses are required by the Labour Protection Act to observe at least 13 holidays per year, including National Labour Day, but may choose the other observances they follow. If a holiday falls on a weekend, one following workday is observed by the government as a compensatory holiday.

==Public holidays==
As of May 2019, there are 19 annual public holidays adopted by the cabinet:
* Holidays regulated by the Thai lunar calendar—the usual Gregorian months in which the dates fall are indicated in parentheses. In lunar leap years, these take place one month later.
* Alcohol sales are prohibited on Buddhist holidays except in international airport duty-free shops.
* Not observed by the Bank of Thailand and usually not observed by the private sector.

Prior to 2016, there were 16 annual public holidays. With the passing of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the list of annual public holidays for 2017 was revised by the cabinet in April 2017. Coronation Day, which was previously observed on 5 May, was temporarily removed, but will be observed from 2020 onwards, with the new date of 4 May, which will be a double anniversary of the coronations of Kings Bhumibol Adulyadej (1950) and Vajiralongkorn (2019).

Two new public holidays from 2017 onwards are:
* 28 July: King Maha Vajiralongkorn&#x27;s Birthday
* 13 October: Anniversary for the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej
Chinese New Year, Eid ul-Fitr and Eid al-Adha are also observed as public holidays by government agencies in Narathiwat, Pattani, Yala and Satun Provinces (see below under ). Government offices under the Ministry of Defence and Ministry of Education may also observe the Thai Armed Forces Day (18 January) and Teachers&#x27; Day (16 January), respectively (see below).

==Bank holidays==
Holidays observed by financial institutions (not to be confused with bank holidays in the United Kingdom) are regulated by the Bank of Thailand. These usually differ from government holidays in that banks do not observe the Royal Ploughing Ceremony day (&quot;Phuetchamongkhon&quot;) and the beginning of Vassa (&quot;Khao Phansa&quot;), but instead do observe 1 May as National Labour Day (see below under ). Up until 2018, a mid-year bank holiday was also observed on 1 July (if that date did not fall on a weekend). (Prior to 2007, the beginning of Vassa was observed as a holiday rather than Asalha Puja.) Chinese New Year, Eid ul-Fitr and Eid al-Adha are also designated as holidays for financial institutions in Narathiwat, Pattani, Yala and Satun Provinces if they do not already fall on a weekend or holiday.

==National observances==
These observances are regulated by the government, but are not observed as holidays. Actual observance varies, and some are only observed by specific sectors.

==Other observances==
Other observances, traditional and modern, are observed by various groups and communities throughout the country.
*Observances regulated by the Thai or Chinese lunar calendars—the usual Gregorian months in which the dates fall are indicated in parentheses.
*Alcohol sales are prohibited on Buddhist holidays except in international airport duty-free shops.

<doc id="494456" wikidata="Q1350060" url="?curid=494456" title="Naoshima, Kagawa">
<text>is an island in Japan&#x27;s Seto Inland Sea, part of Kagawa Prefecture. The island is best known for its many contemporary art installations and museums. The administers Naoshima and 26 smaller islands nearby. As of 2020, the town has an estimated population of 3,026 and a density of 210 persons per km2. The total area is 14.22 km2.

Naoshima Island is known for its many contemporary art museums. For example, the Chichu Art Museum (literally, &quot;in the earth&quot;) houses a number of site-specific installations by James Turrell, Walter De Maria, and paintings by Claude Monet. Designed by Tadao Ando, it is located on one of the highest points of the island, and various exhibits and facets of the museum&#x27;s architecture take advantage of its commanding view. Another contemporary museum (and hotel) is Benesse House, also by Ando. Another is the Naoshima Fukutake Art Museum, with an outdoor sculpture garden, and a third is the James Bond museum, inspired by the island&#x27;s use as one of the settings for the 2002 Bond novel &quot;The Man with the Red Tattoo&quot; by Raymond Benson. It is also known as the island that the fictional locations of Summer Pockets are based on.

The museums and beauty of the island draw many tourists, whose visits help support the local economy. However, it is Mitsubishi Materials, loosely affiliated with other Japanese companies of the Mitsubishi name, that dominates industry on the island, as Naoshima has been the site of massive refining by Mitsubishi since 1917.

Benesse Corporation (one of the largest education companies in Japan and based in Okayama) has directed the creation and operation of the island&#x27;s museums and other projects since the late 1980s.

== Town of Naoshima and nearby islands ==
Naoshima was made a village in 1890, and upgraded to a town in 1954. The town is part of Kagawa District. Naoshima is the sister town of Timmins, Ontario, Canada.

As of 2010, only three of the town&#x27;s 27 islands are inhabited: Naoshima, Byōbujima, and Mukaejima. Ishima is also inhabited, but only in the northern portion which belongs to Okayama Prefecture.

=== Byōbujima ===
Byōbujima is a minor island north of Naoshima, close to Okayama Prefecture, with a population of 19 

=== Ishima ===
The second-largest island of the town, Ishima, lying northeast of Naoshima, is divided between Kagawa Prefecture in the south and Okayama Prefecture in the north. The only inhabitants are in a small settlement on the north coast, belonging to Okayama.

Ishima was divided after fishing-related disputes in the Edo period. In 2011, 87% of the island was burned in a forest fire, though the northern settlement was spared.

=== Mukaejima ===
Mukaejima is a minor island northwest of Naoshima with a population of 15 

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population fo Naoshima has declined over the past half-century.

<doc id="494457" wikidata="Q218823" url="?curid=494457" title="Joshua Lederberg">
<text>Joshua Lederberg (May 23, 1925 – February 2, 2008) was an American molecular biologist known for his work in microbial genetics, artificial intelligence, and the United States space program. He was 33 years old when he won the 1958 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discovering that bacteria can mate and exchange genes (bacterial conjugation). He shared the prize with Edward Tatum and George Beadle, who won for their work with genetics.

In addition to his contributions to biology, Lederberg did extensive research in artificial intelligence. This included work in the NASA experimental programs seeking life on Mars and the chemistry expert system Dendral.

Later in his life, he was a proponent of eugenics.

==Early life and education==
Lederberg was born in Montclair, New Jersey, to a Jewish family, son of Esther Goldenbaum Schulman Lederberg and Rabbi Zvi Hirsch Lederberg, in 1925, and moved to Washington Heights, Manhattan as an infant. He had two younger brothers. Lederberg graduated from Stuyvesant High School in New York City at the age of 15 in 1941. After graduation, he was allowed lab space as part of the American Institute Science Laboratory, a forerunner of the Westinghouse Science Talent Search. He enrolled in Columbia University in 1941, majoring in zoology. Under the mentorship of Francis J. Ryan, he conducted biochemical and genetic studies on the bread mold &quot;Neurospora crassa&quot;. Intending to receive his MD and fulfill his military service obligations, Lederberg worked as a hospital corpsman during 1943 in the clinical pathology laboratory at St. Albans Naval Hospital, where he examined sailors&#x27; blood and stool samples for malaria. He went on to receive his undergraduate degree in 1944.

==Bacterial genetics==

Joshua Lederberg began medical studies at Columbia&#x27;s College of Physicians and Surgeons while continuing to perform experiments. Inspired by Oswald Avery&#x27;s discovery of the importance of DNA, Lederberg began to investigate his hypothesis that, contrary to prevailing opinion, bacteria did not simply pass down exact copies of genetic information, making all cells in a lineage essentially clones. After making little progress at Columbia, Lederberg wrote to Edward Tatum, Ryan&#x27;s post-doctoral mentor, proposing a collaboration. In 1946 and 1947, Lederberg took a leave of absence to study under the mentorship of Tatum at Yale University. Lederberg and Tatum showed that the bacterium &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; entered a sexual phase during which it could share genetic information through bacterial conjugation. With this discovery and some mapping of the &quot;E. coli&quot; chromosome, Lederberg was able to receive his Ph.D. from Yale University in 1947. Joshua married Esther Miriam Zimmer (herself a student of Edward Tatum) on December 13, 1946.

Instead of returning to Columbia to finish his medical degree, Lederberg chose to accept an offer of an assistant professorship in genetics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. His wife Esther Lederberg went with him to Wisconsin. She received her doctorate there in 1950.

Joshua Lederberg and Norton Zinder showed in 1951 that genetic material could be transferred from one strain of the bacterium &quot;Salmonella typhimurium&quot; to another using viral material as an intermediary step. This process is called transduction. In 1956, M. Laurance Morse, Esther Lederberg and Joshua Lederberg also discovered specialized transduction. The research in specialized transduction focused upon lambda phage infection of &quot;E. coli&quot;. Transduction and specialized transduction explained how bacteria of different species could gain resistance to the same antibiotic very quickly.

During her time in Joshua Lederberg&#x27;s laboratory, Esther Lederberg also discovered fertility factor F, later publishing with Joshua Lederberg and Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza. In 1956, the Society of Illinois Bacteriologists simultaneously awarded Joshua Lederberg and Esther Lederberg the Pasteur Medal, for &quot;their outstanding contributions to the fields of microbiology and genetics&quot;.

In 1957, Joshua Lederberg founded the Department of Medical Genetics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He has held visiting professorship in Bacteriology at the University of California, Berkeley in summer 1950 and University of Melbourne (1957). Also in 1957, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences.

Sir Gustav Nossal views Lederberg as his mentor, describing him as &quot;lightning fast&quot; and &quot;loving a robust debate.&quot;

==Post Nobel Prize research==

In 1958, Joshua Lederberg received the Nobel Prize and moved to Stanford University, where he was the founder and chairman of the Department of Genetics. He collaborated with Frank Macfarlane Burnet to study viral antibodies.

With the launching of &quot;Sputnik&quot; in 1957, Lederberg became concerned about the biological impact of space exploration. In a letter to the National Academies of Sciences, he outlined his concerns that extraterrestrial microbes might gain entry to Earth onboard spacecraft, causing catastrophic diseases. He also argued that, conversely, microbial contamination of manmade satellites and probes may obscure the search for extraterrestrial life. He advised quarantine for returning astronauts and equipment and sterilization of equipment prior to launch. Teaming up with Carl Sagan, his public advocacy for what he termed exobiology helped expand the role of biology in NASA.

Lederberg was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1959 and the American Philosophical Society in 1960.

In the 1960s, he collaborated with Edward Feigenbaum in Stanford&#x27;s computer science department to develop DENDRAL.

In 1978, he became the president of Rockefeller University, until he stepped down in 1990 and became professor-emeritus of molecular genetics and informatics at Rockefeller University, reflecting his extensive research and publications in these disciplines.

Throughout his career, Lederberg was active as a scientific advisor to the U.S. government. Starting in 1950, he was a member of various panels of the Presidential Science Advisory Committee. In 1979, he became a member of the U.S. Defense Science Board and the chairman of President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s President&#x27;s Cancer Panel. In 1989, he received National Medal of Science for his contributions to the scientific world. In 1994, he headed the Department of Defense&#x27;s Task Force on Persian Gulf War Health Effects, which investigated Gulf War Syndrome.

During a 1986 fact finding mission of the 1979 Soviet Union epidemic of anthrax bacteria that killed 66 people in the city of Sverdlovsk, Russia now named Yakaterinberg, Lederberg sided with Soviets that the anthrax outbreak was from animal to human transmission stating, “Wild rumors do spread around every epidemic.&quot; “The current Soviet account is very likely to be true.&quot;
After the fall of the Soviet Union and subsequent US investigations in the early 1990s, a team of scientists confirmed the outbreak was caused by a release of an aerosol of anthrax pathogen from a nearby military facility, the lab leak is one of the deadliest ever documented.

==Political and social thought==
=== Euphenics ===
&quot;Euphenics&quot;, which literally means &quot;good appearance&quot; or &quot;normal appearing&quot;, is the science of making phenotypic improvements to humans after birth, generally to affect a problematic genetic condition. Lederberg coined the term in the 1960s to differentiate this practice from eugenics, which was both widely unpopular at the time and he had seen as having been &quot;perverted to justify unthinkable inhumanity&quot;. He emphasized that the genetic manipulation he described was intended to work on phenotype rather than genotype; he felt it was more feasible to positively change an individual&#x27;s phenotype through gene therapies or enzyme replacement rather than attempt to change the course of evolution as eugenics proposed. Theodosius Dobzhansky, an outspoken proponent of euphenics, argued that by improving genetic conditions so that people could live normal, healthy lives, people could lessen the impact of genetic conditions, thus lowering future interest in eugenics or other kinds of genetic manipulation.

In the 1970s, considerable effort was put towards the developing field of euphenics since it was seen as a positive form of genetic engineering. One of the first publicized applications of euphenics was the use of vitamins containing folic acid during pregnancy to combat neural-tube deficiencies such as spina bifida in the 1970s. However, medical science had been using euphenic strategies years before the term itself was coined. Euphenics is used today in the medical community to more generally refer to methods of affecting a genetic condition in a positive manner through diet, lifestyle or environment, such as the use of insulin to control diabetes or installation of a pacemaker to offset a heart defect.

==Awards and accolades==

*The Benjamin Franklin Medal for Distinguished Achievement in the Sciences of the American Philosophical Society, 2002.
*The Presidential Medal of Freedom, 2006.
*In Lederberg&#x27;s honor, the 87 km diameter large impact crater in Xanthe Terra on the surface of Mars was named in the year 2012.

==Personal==
Lederberg married fellow scientist Esther Miriam Zimmer in 1946; they divorced in 1966. He married psychiatrist Marguerite Stein Kirsch in 1968. He was survived by Marguerite, their daughter, Anne Lederberg, and his stepson, David Kirsch.

<doc id="494471" wikidata="Q838921" url="?curid=494471" title="Public holidays in Hong Kong">
<text>Public holidays and statutory holidays in Hong Kong are holidays designated by the Government of Hong Kong. They allow workers rest from work, usually in conjunction with special occasions. Public holidays in Hong Kong consist of a mix of traditional Chinese and Western holidays, such as Lunar New Year, the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the Dragon Boat Festival, along with Christmas and Easter. Other public holidays include National Day (1 October) and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Establishment Day (1 July).

Public holidays and statutory holidays are an important part of life in Hong Kong, allowing people to take a break from work and celebrate important cultural and national events.
==List of holidays==
The 17 &quot;public holidays&quot; (), also called &quot;bank holidays&quot; (), are set by the General Holidays Ordinance. 

According to the Employment Ordinance, 13 of the 17 public holidays are compulsory for employers to give to the employees. These 13 holidays are known as &quot;statutory holidays&quot; (), &quot;labour holidays&quot; (), or &quot;factory holidays&quot; (). These are highlighted in beige below.

== Operation of statutory holidays ==
If an employer states in the employment contract that its employees are only allowed to take statutory holidays, it is legal to require the employees to work on public holidays that are not statutory holidays (i.e. Good Friday, the day following Good Friday and Easter Monday) without salary or leave compensations.

Traditionally, statutory holidays are an entitlement associated with blue-collar jobs in fields such as manufacturing, construction, textiles and clothing, repairing, mass media, security, cleaning, transportation, logistics, distribution, retailing, catering, labourer, hotel and customer service.

== Previous holidays ==
Under the administration of the United Kingdom prior to 1997, the Queen&#x27;s Birthday was a public holiday observed in the second Monday of June. It was replaced by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Establishment Day after the transfer of sovereignty to the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Similarly, Commonwealth Day was a school holiday prior to the transfer of sovereignty, as was the birthday anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat Sen. The anniversary of the liberation of Hong Kong () was observed on 30 August, but was later switched in 1968 to the last Monday in August. After the transfer of sovereingty, it was replaced with the anniversary of the victory in the Second Sino-Japanese War which was celebrated on the third monday of August before being itself replaced by Buddha&#x27;s Birthday and Labour Day in 1999. The anniversary was also reintroduced as a one-off holiday in 2015 to commemorate the 70th anniversary of victory in the Second Sino-Japanese War.

== Weekends and days in lieu ==
According to Hong Kong laws, when a designated public holiday falls on a Sunday or on the same day of another holiday, the immediate following weekday would be a public holiday. However, there are exceptions; for example, as Lunar New Year 2007 falls on a Sunday (18 February), the government have designated the Saturday directly before (17 February) as a public holiday. However, this does not apply to Saturdays, and when a non-statutory public holiday falls on a Saturday, the public holiday is lost to people that do not work on Saturdays.

In general, if a statutory holiday falls on the employee&#x27;s rest day, the employer is committed to giving a day off-in-lieu at a following day which is not the employee&#x27;s rest day. For example, under the 5-day work week system, if a statutory holiday falls on a Saturday, the employee can be entitled to a day off-in-lieu. This is not true for non-statutory public holidays which are lost to people that do not work on Saturday.

== History ==
On March 31, 1955, the five villages located near Takase River - Kamitakase, Katsuma, Hijifuta, Ninomiya, and Asa - merged to become the town of Takase.

On January 1, 2006, the town of Takase, along with the neighboring towns of Nio, Saita, Toyonaka, Yamamoto, Takuma, and Mino, merged to form the city of Mitoyo.

===The Great Shōwa Merger===
The following three proposals were considered for the merger of 1955.
* An eight village merger consisting of the villages of Kamitakase, Katsuma, Hijifuta, Ninomiya, Asa, Yoshizu, Ōmi, and Shimokatsuma
* A five village merger consisting of the villages of Kamitakase, Katsuma, Hijifuta, Ninomiya, and Asa (the merger that was implemented)
* A three village merger consisting of the villages of Kamitakase, Katsuma, and Hijifuta

The schools and such of the villages of Kamitakase, Katsuma, and Hijifuta were closely related, so their merger went relatively smoothly. The villages of Ninomiya, Asa, Yoshizu, Ōmi, and Shimotakase, however, had room to consider other frameworks, so the merger had to wait for their decision to be made. Ultimately, the villages of Yoshizu, Ōmi, and Shimotakase merged to form the town of Mino, and the villages of Ninomiya and Asa joined the framework for the town of Takase, creating the town of Takase from the merging of the five villages.

<text>SSE3, Streaming SIMD Extensions 3, also known by its Intel code name Prescott New Instructions (PNI), is the third iteration of the SSE instruction set for the IA-32 (x86) architecture. Intel introduced SSE3 in early 2004 with the Prescott revision of their Pentium 4 CPU. In April 2005, AMD introduced a subset of SSE3 in revision E (Venice and San Diego) of their Athlon 64 CPUs. The earlier SIMD instruction sets on the x86 platform, from oldest to newest, are MMX, 3DNow! (developed by AMD, no longer supported on newer CPUs), SSE, and SSE2.

SSE3 contains 13 new instructions over SSE2.

==Changes==
The most notable change is the capability to work horizontally in a register, as opposed to the more or less strictly vertical operation of all previous SSE instructions. More specifically, instructions to add and subtract the multiple values stored within a single register have been added. These instructions can be used to speed up the implementation of a number of DSP and 3D operations. There is also a new instruction to convert floating point values to integers without having to change the global rounding mode, thus avoiding costly pipeline stalls. Finally, the extension adds codice_1, an alternative misaligned integer vector load that has better performance on NetBurst based platforms for loads that cross cacheline boundaries.

==CPUs with SSE3==
*AMD:
**Opteron (since Stepping E4)
**Sempron (since Palermo. Stepping E3)
**Athlon 64 (since Venice Stepping E3 and San Diego Stepping E4)
**Athlon 64 FX (since San Diego Stepping E4)
**Athlon 64 X2
**Phenom 64 X2
**Turion family
**K10 family
**APU family (including without GPU)
**FX Series
** Zen family
*Intel:
**Celeron D
**Celeron (starting with Core microarchitecture)
**Pentium 4 (since Prescott)
**Pentium D
**Pentium Extreme Edition (but NOT Pentium 4 Extreme Edition)
**Pentium Dual-Core
**Pentium (starting with Core microarchitecture)
**Core
**Xeon (since Nocona)
**Atom
*VIA/Centaur:
**C7
**Nano
*Transmeta Efficeon TM88xx (NOT Model Numbers TM86xx)

==New instructions==
===Common instructions===

:*Output: { A0 − B0, A1 + B1 }
;codice_3
:&quot;Add-Subtract-Packed-Single&quot;
:* Input: { A0, A1, A2, A3 }, { B0, B1, B2, B3 }
:* Output: { A0 − B0, A1 + B1, A2 − B2, A3 + B3 }

====AOS ( Array Of Structures )====
;codice_4
:&quot;Horizontal-Add-Packed-Double&quot;
:* Input: { A0, A1 }, { B0, B1 }
:* Output: { A0 + A1, B0 + B1 }
;codice_5
:&quot;Horizontal-Add-Packed-Single&quot;
:* Input: { A0, A1, A2, A3 }, { B0, B1, B2, B3 }
:* Output: { A0 + A1, A2 + A3, B0 + B1, B2 + B3 }
;codice_6
:&quot;Horizontal-Subtract-Packed-Double&quot;
:* Input: { A0, A1 }, { B0, B1 }
:* Output: { A0 − A1, B0 − B1 }
;codice_7
:&quot;Horizontal-Subtract-Packed-Single&quot;
:* Input: { A0, A1, A2, A3 }, { B0, B1, B2, B3 }
:* Output: { A0 − A1, A2 − A3, B0 − B1, B2 − B3 }
;codice_1
:As stated above, this is an alternative misaligned integer vector load. It can be helpful for video compression tasks.
;codice_9, codice_10, codice_11
:These are useful for complex numbers and wave calculation like sound.
;codice_12
:Like the older x87 codice_13 instruction, but ignores the floating point control register&#x27;s rounding mode settings and uses the &quot;chop&quot; (truncate) mode instead. Allows omission of the expensive loading and re-loading of the control register in languages such as C where float-to-int conversion requires truncate behaviour by standard.

===Other instructions===
;codice_14, codice_15
:The codice_14 instruction is used to specify a memory address for monitoring, while the codice_15 instruction puts the processor into a low-power state and waits for a write event to the monitored address.

<text>Cyril of Turov, alternately Kirill of Turov (, , ; 1130–1182) was a bishop and saint of the Russian Orthodox Church. He was one of the first and finest theologians of Kievan Rus&#x27;; he lived in Principality of Turov, now southern Belarus. His feast day in the Eastern Orthodox Church is on 28 April.

==Cyril of Turov==
For centuries Cyril of Turov enjoyed considerable prestige as a writer; his works were continuously copied and imitated. According to Zenkovsky&#x27;s assessment of Cyril&#x27;s heritage: &quot;Cyril, Bishop of Turov, was probably the most accomplished master of Orthodox theology and the Byzantine style of writing. He had an excellent command of Greek and his literary achievements surpass those of any other Russian man of letters of that era ... Of all his works, Cyril&#x27;s sermon with the triumphant description of spring as the symbol of the Resurrection was the most popular.&quot; Indeed, this sermon is one of his best known works in which he creates some of his more compelling images like a simile comparing the melting of ice in the spring and Thomas&#x27;s dissolving doubts about Christ&#x27;s resurrection: &quot;Ныне зима греховнаа покаянием престала есть и лед невериа богоразумием растаяся... лед же Фомина невериа показанием Христов ребр растаяся.&quot; [Today the winter of sin has stopped in repentance, and the ice of unbelief is melted by wisdom spring appears...] It is often emphasized that Kirill was an accomplished author who exerted influence on subsequent generations of East Slavs (continuing through the 17th century). The question of Kirill&#x27;s heritage is problematic to some degree. First of all, there is the problem with the historically verifiable existence of Kirill of Turov; the questions as to whether he ever existed and who he might have been have not been answered definitively.

==Biographic details==
Biographic details are scant and because none come from sources contemporary with Kirill, many are debated. All we have in terms of his biography is a short Synaxarion Life: Life of Kirill of Turov (28 April) which was written no earlier than the mid-13th century. This terse formulaic composition draws heavily on the hagiographic conventions and yields very few historical details. He was born in a thriving town of Turov, the son of wealthy parents. He was characterized by extreme piety at a young age and he entered a monastery still a young man. In the monastery he was respected for his asceticism and his learned interpretation of biblical texts. He is said to be the consecrated bishop of Turov in the 1160s. With the support of the Metropolitan in 1169 he became involved in deposing Fedor, who occupied the bishopric of Rostov. Usually he is thought to have died in 1182. According to an alternative line of thought, he became a bishop after 1182, remaining a monk throughout the period of the 1160s and 1170s. Even the dates of Kirill&#x27;s life and work are debated. The dates 1130-1182 had been commonly accepted but among notable scholars, Simon Franklin vigorously disputes them. Kirill&#x27;s title the Bishop of Turov is usually agreed to be a later invention arising out of a desire to designate an appropriately high status to the author of extremely popular and influential words. Even though Kirill came to be known as the Bishop of Turov his works deal most extensively with a theme of monasticism. It is often emphasized that Kirill&#x27;s points of reference are located within the walls of the monastery. Monks are Kirill&#x27;s most frequent addressees.

==Alternative names and attributions==
Generally, Kirill&#x27;s autographs are not available and the manuscript sources are separated from the assumed time of composition by centuries. The medieval habit of anonymity and pseudonymity further complicates the process of attribution. Apart from the very rare &quot;Kirill of Turov&quot; (even when this designation occurs, it tends to be just one of several variant readings), the headings in &#x27;his&#x27; manuscripts include &quot;Kirill the monk,&quot; &quot;Kirill the philosopher,&quot; &quot;Saint Kirill,&quot; &quot;The Blessed father Kirill,&quot; &quot;the blessed monk Kirill,&quot; &quot;Kirill the unworthy monk,&quot; &quot;the venerable Kirill.&quot; Given this variety of labels, &#x27;Kirill&#x27;s&#x27; texts invite several candidates for being their more likely authors (writers whose existence has been substantiated with historical facts). Hypothetically, each work can be allocated to one of several real Kirills and Cyrils: Cyril of Jerusalem (ca. 315-386); Cyril of Alexandria (d. 444); Cyril of Scythopolis (mid-sixth century); Konstantin-Cyril, apostle of the Slavs(d. 869); Metropolitan Kirill I of Kiev (1223–1233); Metropolitan Kirill II of Kiev (1243–1290); Bishop Kirill of Rostov (1231–1262); Kirill of Turov. There are also numerous Kirills who may have been active but were not recorded by chroniclers and hagiographers. Matters are further complicated by the fact, that these labels appear to have been used interchangeably as Simon Franklin points out.

==Works==

Questions of authorship notwithstanding, a remarkable corpus of works in different genres has been attributed to Kirill of Turov: festal homilies, monastic commentaries, some letters, and a cycle of prayers, other hymnological texts, several versions of a penitential Prayer Canon, a Canon of Olga and an abecedarian prayer. These works constitute what came to be known as Corpus Cyrillianium (which at its core has only eleven works which are agreed by the majority to be by Kirill of Turov.)

This is a 19th-century consensus which is generally assumed but continuously questioned. In manuscript sources, there are 23 prayers attributed to Kirill, as well as an additional nine unattributed prayers that are regularly copied together as a group. The prayers form a seven-day liturgical cycle. His homilies are also a cycle based on the ecclesiastical calendar from Palm Sunday to the Sunday before Pentecost. His allegorical commentaries are directed at a monastic audience.

As a scholar of Kyrill, C.M. MacRobert summarizes the state of scholarship: &quot;Even if further early copies of the texts attributed to Kirill of Turov come to light, it may well not be possible to reconstruct his kanon in the form in which he wrote it—supposing that he did write it—or to determine the original wording of his prayers. The attempt to establish a canon of his liturgical works may ultimately be vain: what we have to deal with is not necessarily the recognizable oeuvre of one man, but rather a devotional tradition, a profoundly penitential spirituality which was cultivated among the East Slavs during the medieval period and taken up by other Orthodox Slavs under the pressure of social and political vicissitudes.&quot; Another problem that complicates any precise attribution is the traditionalism of the Corpus Cyrillianum and the genre itself. The Kirillic genres themselves are deliberately constructed so as to give an impression of timelessness and universality. Details of contemporary &quot;relevance&quot; yielding specific clues as to time, place, and people (like Kirill&#x27;s admonition of Feodorek – Bishop Fedor of Rostov called so in depreciation) are rare and skillfully disguised. Kirill-the author identifies himself as a humble monk (following the tradition of humility topos) who fades before the ultimate author and authority of God. Here is an example of Kyrill&#x27;s humility topos taken from &quot;A Tale of a layman, and on monasticism, and on the soul, and on repentance&quot;; by the most sinful monk Kirill, for Vasilij, abbot of the Caves: &quot;(52) And me: I beg you, do not spurn me like a dog, but remember me even here in your prayers, and there throw me scraps from that holy table, and may all Christians be judged worthy of that life, through Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom glory with the Father and with the Holy Spirit, now and ever.&quot; And another one from: A Sermon for Low Sunday by the unworthy monk Kirill in praise of the resurrection, and concerning the paschal bread, and concerning Thomas&#x27;s resting of the Lord&#x27;s ribs: &quot;(1) The Church requires a great teacher and a wise interpreter to adorn the feast. But we are poor in word and dim in mind, and we lack the fire of the Holy Spirit to compose words to benefit the soul. Yet, for the love of the brethren that are with me, I shall say a few words concerning the renewal of the resurrection of Christ.&quot;

==Style: Kirill&#x27;s traditionalism==
Most Kievan Rus&#x27; literature is based on the Eastern Christian tradition which came to Rus&#x27; from Byzantium via Slavonic translations originating mainly in Bulgaria. &quot;The homiletic and exegetic genres are among the &#x27;purest&#x27; versions of the rhetorical tradition inherited from Byzantium, relatively uncontaminated in language and structure,&quot; as Franklin affirms. These genres within the tradition of Christian rhetoric became Kievan elite culture, eagerly imitated by Rus&#x27; medieval authors who &quot;played the game according to received rules&quot;. The Byzantines also valued the stability of form and expression-the impression of timelessness. Consequently, in creating their native tradition, Kievan writers drew on the &quot;tradition one of whose higher aesthetic virtues was traditionalism itself&quot;. As Franklin sees it, Kirill&#x27;s &quot;self-imposed task was to perpetuate a tradition, not to change or modernize it; to become authoritative by following authority rather than by challenging it&quot;.

Kirill&#x27;s works are not original in form because they closely follow the Byzantine style. In content it relies heavily on quotes from the Holy Texts. Kirill&#x27;s texts are characterized by their extreme citationality. Simon Franklin in his most current English translation of the sermons numbers about 370 biblical quotation and allusions. Further textual sources for almost all of Kirill&#x27;s works are also identified. They are works by early Christian and Byzantine churchmen that would have been available to Kirill in Slavonic translations: John Chrysostom, Epiphanius of Salamis, Ephrem of Syrus, Gregory of Nazianzus, Eusebius of Caesarea, and the scholia of Nicetas of Heraclea, Titus of Bostra, Theophylact of Ohrid, and the chronicler George the monk (George Hamartolus). As Ingunn Lunde points out, Kirill&#x27;s technique of quotations is based on the convention of the epideictic discourse where the establishment of verbal correspondences and parallels through emphasis and amplification serve to invocation of the authority of the sacred texts. &quot;What is essential is the recognition of certain layer of sacred texts or voice in the orators&#x27; discourse&quot;. If we accept the conventional attributions of works to Kyrill of Turov, he can be justly named the most prolific extant writer of Kievan Rus&#x27;.

==Churches named after St. Cyril==

<doc id="494509" wikidata="Q847409" url="?curid=494509" title="Douglas DC-7">
<text>The Douglas DC-7 is an American transport aircraft built by the Douglas Aircraft Company from 1953 to 1958. A derivative of the DC-6, it was the last major piston engine-powered transport made by Douglas, being developed shortly after the earliest jet airliner—the de Havilland Comet—entered service and only a few years before the jet-powered Douglas DC-8 first flew in 1958. Larger numbers of both DC-7B and DC-7C variants were also built.

Unlike other far more successful propeller-driven Douglas aircraft, such as the DC-3 and DC-6, no examples of the DC-7 remain in service as of 2020.

==Design and development==
In 1945 Pan American World Airways requested a DC-7, a civil version of the Douglas C-74 Globemaster military transport. Pan Am soon canceled their order. That proposed DC-7 was unrelated to the later DC-6-derived airliner.

American Airlines revived the designation when they requested an aircraft that could fly across the United States coast-to-coast non-stop in about eight hours. (Civil Air Regulations then limited domestic flight crews to 8 hours&#x27; flight time in any 24-hour period.) Douglas was reluctant to build the aircraft until American Airlines president C. R. Smith ordered 25 at a total price of $40 million, thus covering Douglas&#x27; development costs.

The DC-7 wing was based on that of the DC-4 and DC-6, with the same span; the fuselage was longer than the DC-6B. Four eighteen-cylinder Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone Turbo-Compound engines provided power. The prototype flew in May 1953 and American received their first DC-7 in November, inaugurating the first non-stop east-coast-to-west-coast service in the country (unrealistically scheduled just under the eight-hour limit for one crew) and forcing rival TWA to offer a similar service with its Super Constellations. Both aircraft frequently experienced inflight engine failures, causing many flights to be diverted. Some blamed this on the need for high-power settings to meet the national schedules, causing overheating and failure of the engines&#x27; power recovery turbines.

===DC-7B===
The DC-7 was followed by the DC-7B with slightly more power and optional fuel tanks over the wing in the rear of the engine nacelles (selected by Pan Am and South African Airways), each carrying . South African Airways used this variant to fly Johannesburg to London with one stop. Pan Am&#x27;s DC-7Bs started flying transatlantic in summer 1955, scheduled 1 hr 45 min faster than the Super Stratocruiser from New York to London or Paris.

===DC-7C===
Early DC-7s were purchased only by U.S. carriers. European carriers could not take advantage of the small range-increase of the early DC-7, so Douglas released an extended-range variant, the DC-7C (Seven Seas) in 1956. Two wingroot inserts added fuel capacity, reduced interference drag and made the cabin quieter by moving the engines farther outboard; the optional nacelle fuel tanks previously seen on Pan American&#x27;s and South African&#x27;s DC-7Bs were made standard. The fuselage, which had been extended over the DC-6Bs with a plug behind the wing for the DC-7 and DC-7B, was lengthened again with a 40-inch plug ahead of the wing to give the DC-7C a total length of .

==Operational history==
Since the late 1940s Pan Am and other airlines had scheduled a few non-stop flights from New York to Europe, but westward non-stops against the prevailing wind were rarely possible with an economic payload. The Lockheed Super Constellation and DC-7B that appeared in 1955 could occasionally make the westward trip, but in summer 1956 Pan Am&#x27;s DC-7C finally started doing it fairly reliably. BOAC was forced to respond by purchasing DC-7Cs rather than wait on the delivery of the Bristol Britannia. The DC-7C found its way into several other overseas airlines&#x27; fleets, including SAS, which used them on cross-polar flights to North America and Asia. The DC-7C sold better than its rival, the Lockheed L-1649A Starliner, which entered service a year later, but sales were cut short by the arrival of Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 jets in 1958–60.

Starting in 1959 Douglas began converting DC-7s and DC-7Cs into DC-7F freighters to extend their useful lives. The airframes were fitted with large forward and rear freight doors and some cabin windows were removed.

The predecessor DC-6, especially the DC-6B, established a reputation for straightforward engineering and reliability. Pratt &amp; Whitney, manufacturer of the DC-6s Double Wasp engines, did not offer an effective larger engine apart from the Wasp Major, which had a reputation for poor reliability. Douglas turned to Wright Aeronautical for a more powerful engine. The Duplex-Cyclone had reliability issues of its own, and this affected the DC-7&#x27;s service record. Carriers who had both DC-6s and DC-7s in their fleets usually replaced the newer DC-7s first once jets started to arrive. Some airlines retired their DC-7s after little more than five years of service, whereas most DC-6s lasted longer and sold more readily on the secondhand market.

Basic price of a new DC-7 was around $823,308 (£570,000).

Price of a DC-7B was around $982,226 (£680,000) in 1955, rising to $1,184,490 (£820,000) in 1957.

Similarly, the price of a DC-7C was $1,155,560 (£800,000) in 1956, increasing to $1,343,385 (£930,000) by 1958.

Cost of the DC-7F &quot;Speedfreighter&quot; conversion was around $166,112 (£115,000) per aircraft.

===Airlines===
DC-7s were used by Alitalia, American Airlines, BOAC, Braniff Airways, Caledonian Airways, Delta Air Lines, Eastern Air Lines, Flying Tigers, Japan Airlines, KLM, Mexicana de Aviacion, National Airlines, Northwest Orient, Panair do Brasil, Pan American World Airways, Riddle Airlines, Sabena, SAS, South African Airways, Swissair, Turkish Airlines, Transports Aériens Intercontinentaux, and United Airlines.

Seventeen DC-7s remained on the U.S. registry in 2010, they were used mainly for cargo and as aerial firefighting airtankers. Due to its engine problems, the DC-7 has not had the same longevity as the DC-6, which is still used by a number of commercial operators.

==Accidents and incidents==
The Douglas DC-7 suffered 82 incidents and accidents with a total of 714 fatalities.

;June 30, 1956: United Airlines Flight 718, a DC-7, (N6324C) collided over the Grand Canyon with TWA Flight 2, an L-1049 Super Constellation (N6902C), resulting in the deaths of 128 people on both aircraft.

;January 31, 1957: A DC-7 (N8210H) still owned by Douglas crashed into a school yard in the Pacoima area of Los Angeles, California, following a midair collision with Northrop F-89J Scorpion &quot;52-1870&quot;, resulting in the deaths of the four crewmembers aboard the DC-7, the pilot of the Scorpion jet, and three students on the ground.

;March 5, 1957: An American Air Lines DC-7B (N316AA) on a flight from Idlewild (JFK) airport to Love Field (Dallas) suffered failure of the #1 engine. The propeller and nose section detached and struck the fuselage, leading to decompression. The pilot made a successful emergency landing at Memphis; there were no fatalities or injuries. The plane was repaired and returned to service.

;June 28, 1957: An Eastern Air Lines DC-7B (N808D) collided with a parked Eastern Air Lines Lockheed L-1049 (N6212C) at Miami International Airport after returning from a training flight. Fuel leaked and both aircraft burned out.

;February 1, 1958: Pan Am Flight 70, a DC-7C (N733PA, &quot;Clipper Blue Jacket&quot;), landed wheels-up at Schiphol Airport as a result of pilot error; all 16 on board survived. The aircraft was repaired and returned to service as a freighter. See also July 26, 1970 below.

;March 10, 1958: A DC-7B (N846D) still owned by Douglas crashed at Long Beach, California during a test flight before delivery to Eastern Air Lines.

;March 25, 1958: Braniff Flight 971, a DC-7C (N5904), crashed shortly after takeoff from Miami while attempting to return after an engine caught fire. Nine passengers out of 24 people aboard died in the accident.

;April 21, 1958: United Airlines Flight 736, a DC-7 (N6328C) en route from Los Angeles to Denver, collided with a Nellis Air Force Base, North American F-100 Super Sabre &quot;F-100F&quot; (two-seater) (56-3755) near Las Vegas. Both aircraft crashed out of control resulting in the deaths of 49 people.

;May 18, 1958: A Sabena DC-7C (OO-SFA) crashed near Casablanca–Anfa Airport during the attempted landing. All nine crewmembers and 52 of the 56 passengers died.

;September 24, 1959: TAI Flight 307, a DC-7C, crashed at Bordeaux airport with the loss of 54 lives. After takeoff, the aircraft failed to gain altitude and collided with trees from the start of the takeoff.

;November 16, 1959: National Airlines Flight 967, a DC-7B on a flight from Tampa, Florida, to New Orleans, crashed into the Gulf of Mexico. All 42 occupants perished. Although sabotage was suspected, no definite cause of the crash was determined due to a lack of evidence. The aircraft was owned by Delta Air Lines.

;February 26, 1960: Alitalia Flight 618, a DC-7C (I-DUVO), crashed at Shannon Airport, Ireland, shortly after takeoff following a loss of altitude while making a left turn with 34 fatalities out of 52 passengers and crew. No cause was established for this accident.

;June 27, 1960: A Cubana de Aviación DC-7 took off from José Martí International Airport, Cuba, to Idlewood Intl’l (now JFK International Airport). Near cruising altitude, engine #3 and #4 failed and caught fire. They safely landed at Key West International Airport with no fatalities. 

;July 14, 1960: Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 1-11, a DC-7C (N292), ditched off Polillo Island, Philippines due to failure of the number two engine and fire; one person (out of 58 on board) died when the number two propeller separated and penetrated the fuselage.

;February 18, 1961: A Pan AM DC-7CF (N745PA) struck a mound of earth short of the runway in Stuttgart while attempting an ILS approach, shearing off the undercarriage and #1 engine. The pilots retained control and were able to climb away, then make a belly landing at Nurnberg airport. The aircraft was written off.

;November 1, 1961: A Panair do Brasil DC-7C (PP-PDO) flying from Sal to Recife crashed into a hill about short of the runway at Recife. Forty-five passengers and crew out of the 88 persons aboard lost their lives. The accident was attributed to pilot error.

;March 4, 1962: Caledonian Airways Flight 153 crashed into a swamp shortly after takeoff from Douala International Airport; all 111 people on board died. It is the worst single-aircraft accident of a DC-7.

;October 22, 1962: Northwest Airlines Flight 292, a DC-7C (N285) with 7 crew and 95 passengers, made a successful water landing in Sitka Sound just before 1 p.m. local time after struggling with propeller problems for 45 minutes while operating as a military charter flight between McChord Air Force Base and Elmendorf Air Force Base. The plane stayed afloat for 24 minutes after coming to rest in the water, giving the occupants ample time to evacuate into life rafts with only 6 minor injuries reported. All passengers and crew were quickly rescued by U.S. Coast Guard ships. The cause was an overspeeding propeller when the blower section on engine number two failed.

;November 30, 1962: Eastern Air Lines Flight 512, a DC-7B on a flight from Charlotte, North Carolina, to New York-Idlewild, crashed after a missed approach due to fog. This accident, which cost 25 lives (out of 51 on board), was attributed to improper crew procedures.

;June 3, 1963: Northwest Airlines Flight 293, a Military Air Transport Service flight from McChord Air Force Base in Washington state to Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska crashed into the Pacific Ocean near Annette Island, Alaska, with the loss of all 101 people aboard. Due to the lack of evidence, no cause was established for this accident.

;February 8, 1965: Eastern Air Lines Flight 663 crashed a few minutes after takeoff from John F. Kennedy Airport in New York after taking evasive action to avoid a possible collision with another airliner (Pan Am Flight 212, a Boeing 707). All 84 passengers and crew died.

;December 7, 1968: A North American Aircraft Trading DC-7C (VR-BCY) crashed during approach to Uli Airstrip following triple engine failure during a relief flight, killing all four crew.

;June 5, 1969: A Swedish Red Cross DC-7B (SE-ERP) was shot down by a Nigerian Air Force MiG-17 and crashed at Eket, Nigeria, killing all four crew. The aircraft was operating a supply flight from Fernando Po (now Bioko) to Biafra.

;July 26, 1970: An ARCO ferry flight of a DC-7CF (VR-BCT), from Kinshasa suffered an explosive failure of the #3 engine. The pilots succeeded in making a belly landing on 2 engines (engine #4 having been inoperable for the entire flight), however the plane was damaged beyond repair. This aircraft had previously crashed in 1958.

;October 2, 1970: A Spantax DC-7C (EC-ATQ) was written off at Barajas Airport.

;December 31, 1972: Professional Baseball player Roberto Clemente and 4 others in a chartered DC-7 died when the plane crashed shortly after takeoff from San Juan, Puerto Rico. Only parts of the fuselage and the body of pilot Jerry Hill were recovered. The cause was traced to maintenance and pilot errors.

;June 21, 1973: A Skyways International DC-7C (N296) crashed in the Everglades six minutes after takeoff from Miami International Airport, apparently caused by an onboard fire and/or severe turbulence. Three crew members, the sole occupants, died. The aircraft was on lease to Warnaco Incorporated.

;March 3, 1974: A Douglas DC-7C/F (EI-AWG) operating an Aer Turas Teo charter flight from Dublin landed at Luton Airport on runway 08 just after midnight but failed to achieve reverse thrust. Normal braking application also was ineffective and the emergency pneumatic brakes were applied. All main wheel tires burst. The aircraft overran the runway and continued over the steep bank at the eastern perimeter finally coming to rest in soft ground 90 metres beyond. The situation had also been made worse by an inadvertent application of forward thrust by the crew in trying to achieve reverse thrust. Three of the six passengers and two of the four crew were injured. The badly damaged aircraft was written off.

;October 4, 1976: An Emirates Air Transport DC-7CF (TZ-ARC) struck Mount Kenya due to a premature descent, killing the four crew.

;September 12, 1977: A Safe Air Cargo DC-7BF (N6314J) crashed on climbout from Yakutat Airport after an engine lost power and caught fire, killing the four crew. 14 CFR 91 subpart D was revised in the wake of this accident.

;September 6, 1978: An Advance Aviation Inc. DC-7CF (N244B) was being used to smuggle marijuana when it crashed near Farmerville, Louisiana due to pilot error, killing one of six on board. Thirty-five bales of marijuana were recovered from the wreckage.

;June 22, 1979: A Go Transportation DC-7CF (N357AL) crashed on climbout from Barstow Airport due to overloading and loss of engine power (caused by improper 100 octane fuel), killing one of six crew.

;September 14, 1979: A Butler Aircraft Inc. DC-7 (N4SW) transporting company employees to Medford, Oregon, crashed on the crest of Surveyor Mountain near Klamath Falls, Oregon. The crash, which claimed the 12 occupants aboard, was attributed to the crew&#x27;s decision to undertake a night flight at low altitude.

;1980: An Aero Services Corp. DC-7CF (N8219H) was shot down and crashed in Colombia during a smuggling flight.

;July 27, 1980: A Lambda Air Cargo DC-7CF (CP-1291) burned out on the ground at Trujillo Airport.

;November 28, 1980: A Central Air Service DC-7B (N816D) crashed near Pecos Municipal Airport, Texas, soon after takeoff killing the pilot and co-pilot onboard. The plane entered a steep 90° left bank after takeoff, descended fast with the no. 2 prop feathered and crashed in a field.

;October 9, 1986: A T&amp;G Aviation DC-7C (N5903) ditched off Dakar due to engine problems, killing three of four crew.

;December 8, 1988: A T&amp;G Aviation DC-7CF (N284) was shot down by a SAM-7 missile fired by the Polisario Front and crashed in the Western Sahara, killing the five crew. A second T&amp;G DC-7 (N90984) was also hit, losing an engine, but was able to land safely. Polisario soldiers thought the aircraft were Moroccan C-130s.

;October 1, 1992: A TBM Incorporated DC-7B (N848D) crashed near Union Valley Reservoir, California due to pilot error and poor crew resource management, killing both pilots.

<text>Public holidays in Croatia are regulated by the Holidays, Memorial Days and Non-Working Days Act ().

* In 2020 there was a change in holidays: June 25 (was Statehood Day until 2019, became Independence Day in 2020) and October 8 (was Independence Day until 2019, became Day of the Croatian Parliament in 2020) changed names and were demoted from public holidays to memorial days (working). May 30 (was Day of the Croatian Parliament until 2019, became National Day in 2020) was promoted from a memorial day to a public holiday, and November 18 (Homeland War Victims Remembrance Day) was added as a new public holiday.

Note: Citizens of the Republic of Croatia who celebrate different religious holidays have the right not to work on those dates. Christians who celebrate Christmas, Easter and Easter Monday per the Julian calendar, Muslims on the days of Ramadan Bayram and Kurban Bayram, and Jews on the days of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.
==Unofficial holidays==
*Popular carnival celebrations are held in most cities and towns in the country on Shrove Tuesday (&quot;Pokladni utorak&quot;), when customarily businesses in public sector and hospitality industry cease work for the day earlier than usual, but the day is not officially designated a public holiday.
*Some cities also celebrate &quot;de facto&quot; public holidays on their patron saints&#x27; feast days. For example, in Split, the day of Saint Domnius (&quot;Sveti Duje&quot;) is celebrated on May 7, while Dubrovnik marks the day of Saint Blaise (&quot;Sveti Vlaho&quot;) on 3 February ; business usually cease work earlier than usual on these days. Most of rural village parishes in Slavonia celebrate their patron saints&#x27; with &quot;kirbaj / kirvaj&quot; festival (from German &quot;kirche weihe&quot;) when schools are usually closed for a day.
*Even though Christmas Eve (24 December ), New Year&#x27;s Eve (31 December), and Good Friday are not public holidays, businesses customarily close earlier (as early as 12pm).

<text>Surakarta (Javanese: , Pegon: ), known colloquially as Solo (Javanese: ; ), is a major city in Central Java, Indonesia. The city adjoins Karanganyar Regency and Boyolali Regency to the north, Karanganyar Regency and Sukoharjo Regency to the east and west, and Sukoharjo Regency to the south. On the eastern side of Solo lies Solo River (Bengawan Solo). Its metropolitan area, consisting of Surakarta City and the surrounding six regencies (&quot;Greater Solo Area&quot;, formerly Special Region of Surakarta), was home to 6,837,753 inhabitants according to the official estimates for mid 2023, 526,870 of whom reside in the city proper.

Surakarta is the birthplace of the President of Indonesia from 2014 to 2024, Joko Widodo, as well as his son and current Vice President of Indonesia, Gibran Rakabuming Raka. The former served as Mayor of Surakarta from 2005 to 2012, as did the latter from 2021 to 2024.

==History==

Hominid habitation in the region of Surakarta is evidenced from roughly one million years ago, the age of the &quot;Java Man&quot; skeleton found 80 kilometres upstream. Another famous early hominid from this area is called &quot;Solo Man&quot;.

The Surakarta area was part of the Mataram Kingdom and at this time a village called Wulayu seems to have already existed in or around the present-day city of Surakarta, as evidenced by a ferry charter issued by Balitung in A.D. 904. The Majapahit Empire renewed this ferry charter in 1358.

By the 18th century, the village had acquired the name of Sala. This name is said to be derived from the sala tree. As the Javanese pronunciation &quot;Sala&quot; ([sɔlɔ]) was considered difficult to pronounce by the Dutch, the name later morphed into &quot;Solo&quot; ([solo]).

In 1745, based on astrological calculations and Dutch commercial interest, Surakarta was chosen to be the new capital of the Mataram Sultanate which was on the verge of becoming a vassal state of the Dutch East India Company. The formal name is derived from the previous capital Kartasura. The official court history claims that Surakarta originally stood on a lake, which was drained by the favor of the mythical queen of the southern sea, Kanjeng Ratu Kidul.

In the ensuing colonial era, the kingdom of Mataram was divided into the Surakarta Sunanate (northern court) and the Yogyakarta Sultanate (southern court). Surakarta was ruled by hereditary monarchs, who were given the unique Javanese cultural title Susuhunan. Since both Surakarta and Yogyakarta had become vassal states of the Dutch, traditional court arts, notably gamelan, were developed to demonstrate cultural power instead of developing military power.

=== Pakubuwono X ===
Perhaps the most significant ruler of the 20th century was Pakubuwono X. His relationship with the Dutch, his large family, and his popularity contributed to perhaps the largest funeral procession that ever occurred in Surakarta. He had spent a large amount of money on the Royal Graveyard at Imogiri, both the main sections of the graveyard and the new section where he was buried. In the era just before independence, Surakarta had European, Chinese, and Arab quarters.

===Struggle for independence===
After hearing the proclamation of Indonesian Independence, Pakubuwono XII declared Surakarta a part of the Republic of Indonesia. Because of this support, President Sukarno declared Surakarta a Special Region with the Susuhunan, Pakubuwono XII, continuing as governor. This terminology was also used for the Special Region of Yogyakarta, which continues to be legally governed by its sultan to this day.
However, unlike Yogyakarta, Surakarta had intense, organized resistance to the continuation of the monarchy. In October 1945, a republican movement was established in Surakarta led by Tan Malaka, a member of the Indonesian Communist Party.
On 17 October, the vizier of Surakarta, KRMH Sosrodiningrat V (a member of the BPUPK), was kidnapped. The new vizier, KRMT Yudonagoro, and 9 other court officials were also kidnapped by the same movement in March 1946, including the heir to the viziership KRMTH Wuryaningrat.

In response, Prime Minister of Indonesia Sutan Syahrir met with Wuryaningrat and other Surakarta leaders in May and agreed to abolish the established government entirely.

On 16 June 1946, the Surakarta &quot;special region&quot; was abolished and replaced with a regency (&quot;kabupaten&quot;), administered by a republican government outside the control of the Susuhunan and his court. This event is commemorated as the birthday of the city of Surakarta.

On 26 June Prime Minister Sutan Syahrir was kidnapped in Surakarta by a rebel movement led by Major General Soedarsono, the commander of the 3rd division. President Sukarno was angry at this kidnapping and on 1 July 1946, 14 communist leaders including Tan Malaka were arrested by Indonesian police on Sukarno&#x27;s instructions. However, Soedarsono freed the rebel leaders immediately. Sukarno asked the local military commander in Surakarta, Lieutenant Colonel Suharto to arrest Major General Soedarsono and the rebel group.

Suharto refused to follow this command unless it was given directly by the Military Chief of Staff, General Soedirman. Sukarno was angry at this rejection of his commanding authority and called Suharto a stubborn (&quot;koppig&quot;) officer.

Suharto pretended to support the rebellion and persuaded Soedarsono and his group to stay at his headquarters at Wiyoro, Surakarta for their safety. Later that night he persuaded Soedarsono to meet President Sukarno at his palace the next morning. Suharto secretly informed the presidential guard troops about Soedarsono&#x27;s plan on the next morning. On July 3, 1946, Soedarsono and his group were arrested by the presidential guard near the palace. Prime Minister Syahrir was released unharmed. Several months later, Maj. Gen. Soedarsono and his group were pardoned and released from prison.
However, this did not halt the ascendancy of the Communist Party in Surakarta. In November 1946, the communists kidnapped the regent and vice-regent and seized power for themselves, a coup quickly legitimated after the fact by Sukarno. In 1947, Amir Sjarifuddin appointed Wikana, a communist, as Surakarta&#x27;s military governor.

In December 1948, the Dutch attacked and occupied the cities of Yogyakarta and Surakarta as part of Operation Kraai. The Indonesian Army, led by General Soedirman, started a guerrilla war in surrounding areas. The Dutch declared that the Republic had been destroyed and no longer existed. To disprove this, the Indonesian army conducted large-scale raids into the cities of Yogyakarta and Surakarta, called &quot;Serangan Oemoem&quot;. On 7 August 1949, Indonesian troops led by Slamet Riyadi managed to defeat the Dutch troops and occupied the city for several hours. To 
commemorate this event, the main street of the city of Surakarta was renamed Brigadier General Slamet Riyadi Street.
Surakarta remained under communist control until October 1965. Local government was unclear about how to proceed after the 30 September Movement and went about business as usual. As a result, Suharto&#x27;s forces entered Surakarta without resistance, mobilized local youth paramilitaries, and indiscriminately slaughtered the entire local government.

== Geography ==
The water sources for Surakarta are in the valley of Merapi, a total of 19 locations, with a capacity of 3,404 L/second (899.2 U.S. gal/sec). The average source water height is above sea level. In 1890–1927 there were only 12 wells in Surakarta. Today, underground water wells in 23 locations produce about 45 L/second (11.9 U.S. gal/sec).

In March 2006, Surakarta&#x27;s state water company (PDAM) had a production capacity of 865.02 L/second (228.5 U.S. gal/sec): from Cokrotulung, Klaten, from Surakarta, 387 L/s (102.2 U.S. gal/sec); and from 26 deep wells, with a total capacity of 478.02 L/second (126.3 U.S. gal/sec). The total reservoir capacity is 9,140 m3 (,414,533 U.S. gala) nd can serve 55,22% of the population.

=== Climate ===
Surakarta features a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen: &quot;Am&quot;). with a lengthy wet season spanning from October through May, and a relatively short dry season covering the remaining four months (June through September). On average Surakarta receives just under of rainfall annually, with its wettest months being December, January, and February. As is common in areas featuring a tropical monsoon climate, temperatures are relatively consistent throughout the year. Surakarta&#x27;s average temperature is roughly 30 °C every month (86 °F).

== Administrative divisions ==

After Surakarta became a city, it was divided into five districts (&quot;kecamatan&quot;), each led by a &quot;camat&quot;, and subdivided into 51 &quot;kelurahan&quot; (now 54), each led by a &quot;lurah&quot;. The districts of Surakarta City are tabulated below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census and 2020 Census together with the latest official estimates as at mid 2023. The table also includes the locations of the district administrative centres, the number of administrative villages in each district (all classed as urban &quot;kelurahan&quot;), and the district postal codes:

Notes: (a) also spelled &quot;Lawiyan&quot;. (b) except the &quot;kelurahan&quot; of Jagalan, which has the postcode of 57162.

===Greater Surakarta===
Surakarta as a densely-populated core city in Central Java, and its second city, spills considerably into neighboring regencies. Surakarta City and its surrounding regencies, Karanganyar, Sragen, Wonogiri, Sukoharjo, Klaten, and Boyolali, are collectively called the ex-Surakarta Residency (Dutch: &quot;Residentie Soerakarta&quot;).

Though a traffic study quotes the population as 1,158,000 as of 2008, this reflects only the continuously built-up area, as the city affects entire neighboring regencies by significantly driving up overall population densities in Sukoharjo Regency and Klaten Regency over the already dense countryside. Furthermore, the government of Indonesia officially defines a broader region as Surakarta&#x27;s extended metropolitan zone, with the acronym &quot;Subosukawonosraten&quot; (for SUrakarta, BOyolaki, SUkoharjo, KAranganyar, WONOgiri, SRAgen, KlaTEN) as the city and the entire 6 surrounding regencies, which reflects a broader planning region, though not a core metropolitan area as some of its regencies are not particularly suburbanized. Both the metropolitan area and extended areas border Yogyakarta&#x27;s metropolitan area, while only the extended metropolitan area borders &quot;Kedungsapur&quot; or Greater Semarang.

== Demography ==

One of the earliest censuses held in Surakarta Residency (&quot;Residentie Soerakarta&quot;) was in 1885. At that time, with an area of about , there were 1,053,985 people in Surakarta Residency, including 2,694 Europeans and 7,543 Indonesian-Chinese.

The percentage of high-school graduates was the highest of the cities and regencies in Central Java.

According to the statistics of &quot;Data Pokok Pendidikan&quot; (Dapodik), in the 2010/2011 school year, there were 68,153 students and 853 schools in Surakarta. There are two big universities possessing more than 20.000 students: Sebelas Maret University (UNS) and Muhammadiyah University of Surakarta (UMS), both are recognised as among Indonesia&#x27;s 50 best universities according to the Directorate of Higher Education, Ministry of Education RI. There is also arts concentrated university Art Institute of Surakarta (ISI), religious studies State Islamic Institute (IAIN Surakarta). There are around 52 private universities and colleges such as STIKES Muhammadiyah, Universitas Tunas Pembangunan, Universitas Slamet Riyadi, Universitas Surakarta, Universitas Setia Budi, etc.

== Sports ==
Surakarta has a long sport history and tradition. In 1923 Solo already had a football club, one of the earliest clubs in Indonesia (at that time still the Dutch Indies), called Persis Solo. Persis Solo was a giant club in the Dutch Indies and still exists, but is past its heyday. During the Perserikatan tournament, Persis became seven-time champion. Currently it plays in the Liga 1 Indonesia. Other than Persis, several clubs have existed in Solo: Arseto, Pelita Solo, Persijatim Solo FC, and lastly Solo FC played in the Indonesian Premier League in 2011.

<text>Perilla frutescens var. crispa, also known by its Japanese name shiso, is a cultigen of &quot;Perilla frutescens&quot;, a herb in the mint family Lamiaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of China and India, but is now found worldwide. The plant occurs in several forms, as defined by the characteristics of their leaves, including red, green, bicolor, and ruffled. Shiso is perennial and may be cultivated as an annual in temperate climates. Different parts of the plant are used in East Asian and Southeast Asian cuisine.

== Names ==
The herb is known in Chinese as &quot;zǐsū&quot; ( &quot;purple perilla&quot;), which is the origin of the Japanese name &quot;shiso&quot; () and the Vietnamese name &quot;&quot;. It is also called &quot;huíhuísū&quot; ( &quot;Muslim perilla&quot;) in Chinese. In Korean, it is known as &quot;soyeop&quot; () or &quot;chajogi&quot; (). In ancient Japan, it was called &quot;inue&quot; (&quot;pseudo-perilla&quot;), though this name is no longer used.

In English, it is sometimes called the &quot;beefsteak plant&quot;, because purple-leaf varieties resemble the blood-red color of meat. Other common names include &quot;perilla mint&quot;, &quot;Chinese basil&quot;, and &quot;wild basil&quot;. The alias &quot;wild coleus&quot; or &quot;summer coleus&quot; probably describe ornamental varieties. Red-leaf varieties are sometimes called &quot;purple mint&quot;. In the Ozarks, it is called &quot;rattlesnake weed&quot;, because the sound the dried stalks make when disturbed along a footpath is similar to a rattlesnake&#x27;s rattle. The Japanese name &quot;shiso&quot; became part of the English lexicon in the 1990s, owing to the growing popularity of sushi.

The plant is sometimes referred to by its genus name, &quot;Perilla&quot;, but this is ambiguous as perilla could also refer to a different cultigen (&quot;Perilla frutescens&quot; var. &quot;frutescens&quot;). To avoid confusion, &quot;Perilla frutescens&quot; var. &quot;frutescens&quot; is called &quot;egoma&quot; (&quot;perilla sesame&quot;) in Japan and &quot;deulkkae&quot; (&quot;wild sesame&quot;) in Korea.

When red-leaf shiso was introduced into the West in the 1850s, it was given the scientific name &quot;Perilla nankinensis&quot;, after the city of Nanking. This name is now less common than &quot;Perilla frutescens&quot;.

== Origins and distribution ==
It is suggested that the native origins of the plant are mountainous regions of India and China, although other sources point to Southeast Asia.

== History ==
&quot;Perilla frutescens&quot; was cultivated in ancient China. One of the early mentions comes from the &quot;Supplementary Records of Renowned Physicians&quot; ( &quot;Míng Yī Bié Lù&quot;), written around 500 AD, where it is listed as &quot;su&quot; (), and some of its uses are described. The plant was introduced into Japan around the eighth to ninth centuries.

Red shiso became available to gardening enthusiasts in England around 1855. By 1862, the English were reporting overuse of this plant, and proposing &quot;Coleus vershaeffeltii&quot; or &quot;Amaranthus melancholicus&quot; var. &quot;ruber&quot; made available by J.G. Veitch as an alternative. It was introduced later in the United States, perhaps in the 1860s. Today, it is considered a weed or invasive species.

== Description ==
Shiso grows to tall. It has broad ovate leaves with pointy ends and serrated margins, arranged oppositely with long leafstalks. Shiso seeds are about 1 mm in size, and are smaller and harder compared to other perilla varieties. Seeds weigh about 1.5 g per 1000 seeds.
The plants are not frost hardy. In USDA zones 11 and above, they grow as perennials.

=== Varieties ===
Several forms of shiso exist. They are defined by the color and morphology of the leaves, though coloring is also found on the stalk and flower buds. Redness in shiso is caused by shisonin, an anthocyanin pigment found in perilla. Ruffled red shiso was the first form examined by Western botanists, and Carl Peter Thunberg named it &quot;P. crispa&quot; (meaning &quot;wavy&quot; or &quot;curly&quot;). That Latin name &quot;crispa&quot; was later retained when shiso was reclassified as a cultigen.

; Red shiso (f. &quot;purpurea&quot;): Leaves red on both sides, flat surface. Often called simply &quot;shiso&quot;.
; Ruffled red shiso (f. &quot;crispa&quot;): Leaves red on both sides, ruffled surface.
; Green shiso (f. &quot;viridis&quot;): Leaves green on both sides, flat surface.
; Ruffled green shiso (f. &quot;viridi-crispa&quot;): Leaves green on both sides, ruffled surface. Cultivar.
; Bicolor shiso (f. &quot;discolor&quot;): Leaves green on top side, red on back side, flat surface. Cultivar.
; Variegated shiso (f. &quot;rosea&quot;): Leaves a mix of green and red on both sides, flat surface.

== Culinary use ==
Cultivated shiso is eaten in many East and Southeast Asian countries. Wild, weedy shiso are not suitable for eating, as they do not have the characteristic shiso fragrance, and are high in perilla ketone, which is potentially toxic.

===East Asia===
==== China ====
Chinese cuisine also utilizes shiso, named &quot;zi su&quot; (紫苏), &quot;bai su&quot; (白苏), or &quot;huihui su&quot; (回回苏) in Chinese. It is sometimes used as a decorative ingredient, and is sometimes eaten to reduce grease (as with barbecue). It is common practice to accompany fish and crab dishes with &quot;zisu&quot;, as it is believed that &quot;zisu&quot; leaves can offset the toxins in seafood.

==== Japan ====

&quot;Shiso&quot; (紫蘇) is extensively used in Japanese cuisine. Red, green, and bicolor varieties are used for different purposes.

Red shiso is called &quot;akajiso&quot; (赤紫蘇). It is used in the making of &quot;umeboshi&quot; (pickled plums) to give the plums a red color. The leaves turns bright red when steeped in &quot;umezu&quot;, the vinegary brine that results as a byproduct of pickling plums. It can also be combined with &quot;umezu&quot; to make certain types of sushi. In the summer, it is used to make a sweet, red juice. In Kyoto, red shiso and its seeds are used to make &quot;shibazuke&quot;, a type of fermented eggplant.

Red leaves are dried and pulverized into flakes, then mixed with salt to make a seasoning called &quot;yukari&quot;. The word &quot;yukari&quot; is an ancient term for the color purple, and was first used by Mishima Foods Co. to describe their shiso product, though the word is now used to refer to shiso salt in general. Red shiso leaf flakes are a common ingredient in &quot;furikake&quot; seasonings, meant to be sprinkled over rice or mixed into &quot;onigiri&quot; (rice balls).

Green shiso is called &quot;aojiso&quot; (青紫蘇) or &quot;ōba&quot; (大葉 &quot;big leaf&quot;). It is used to garnish noodle dishes like &quot;hiyamugi&quot; or &quot;sōmen&quot;, meat dishes like sashimi, &quot;tataki&quot; and &quot;namerō&quot;, and tofu dishes like &quot;hiyayakko&quot;. Whitebait (&quot;shirasu&quot;) sashimi is often garnished with green shiso. Whole leaves are also used as receptacles to hold wasabi, or &quot;tsuma&quot; (garnishes). Leaves can also be battered on one side and fried to make tempura, and are served with other fried items. Chopped leaves are used to flavor any number of fillings or batter to be cooked, for use in warm dishes. In Japan, pasta is sometimes topped with dried or freshly chopped shiso leaves, which is often combined with raw &quot;tarako&quot; (pollock roe). Green shiso has even been used in pizza toppings in lieu of basil. In the summer of 2009, Pepsi Japan released a seasonal flavored beverage, the green colored Pepsi Shiso.

Shiso seed pods (fruits) are called &quot;shiso no mi&quot;, and are salted and preserved like a spice. They can be combined with fine slivers of daikon (radish) to make a simple salad. Oil pressed from the seeds was once used for deep-frying.

Shiso sprouts, buds and cotyledons are all called &quot;mejiso&quot; (芽紫蘇), and used as garnish. Red sprouts are called &quot;murame&quot;, and green sprouts are called &quot;aome&quot;. Although not often served in restaurants, &quot;mejiso&quot; are used as microgreens.

Shiso flowers are called &quot;hojiso&quot; (穂紫蘇), and used as garnish for sashimi. They are intended to be scraped off the stalk with chopsticks, and added as flavoring to the soy sauce dip. The flowers can also be pickled.

==== Korea ====
In Korean cuisine, shiso is called &quot;soyeop&quot; () or &quot;chajogi&quot; (). It is less popular than the related cultigen, &quot;P. frutescens&quot; (&quot;deulkkae&quot;). &quot;Soyeop&quot; is commonly seen as a wild plant, and the leaves are occasionally used as a &quot;ssam&quot; vegetable. Red leaves are sometimes pickled in soy sauce or soybean paste as a &quot;jangajji&quot;, or deep-fried as &quot;bugak&quot; with a thin coat of rice-flour batter.

===Southeast Asia===
==== Laos ====
In Laos, red shiso leaves are called &quot;pak maengda&quot; (ຜັກແມງດາ). They are used to add fragrance to &quot;khao poon&quot; (ເຂົ້າປຸ້ນ), a rice vermicelli dish that is similar to the Vietnamese &quot;bún&quot;.

==== Vietnam ====
In Vietnam, shiso is called &quot;tía tô&quot;. Compared to Japanese shiso, it has slightly smaller leaves but a much stronger aromatic flavor. Vietnamese &quot;tía tô&quot; are often bicolored, with leaves that are red on the backside.

&quot;Tía tô&quot; leaves are used in Vietnamese cuisine for salads, soups, or stir-fried dishes. The strong flavors are perfect for cooking seafoods such as shrimp and fish dishes. They are eaten as a garnish with &quot;&quot; (rice vermicelli). Leaves are also pickled.

== Biochemistry ==
Shiso&#x27;s distinctive flavor comes from perillaldehyde, which is found only in low concentrations in other perilla varieties, including &quot;Perilla frutescens&quot;. The oxime of perillaldehyde, perillartine, is about 2,000 times sweeter than sucrose. However, perillartine has a bitter aftertaste and is not soluble in water, and is only used in Japan as an artificial sweetener to sweeten tobacco.

Wild shiso is rich in perilla ketone, which is a potent lung toxin to some livestock. When consumed by cattle and horses, it causes pulmonary edema, leading to a condition sometimes called perilla mint toxicosis. Effects on humans remain to be studied.

The plant produces the natural product perilloxin, which is built around a 3-benzoxepin moiety. Like aspirin, perilloxin inhibits the enzyme cyclooxygenase with an IC50 of 23.2 μM.

Other chemotypes include eschscholzia ketone, perillene, and the phenylpropanoids myristicin, dillapiole, elemicin, citral, and a type rich in rosefuran.

Shiso contains only about 25.2–25.7% lipid, but still contains a comparable 60% ratio of ALA. Aromatic essential oils present are limonene, caryophyllene, and farnesene.

Bactericidal and preservative effects of shiso, due to the presence of terpenes such as perilla alcohol, have been noted.

== Cultivation ==
In temperate climates, the plant is self-sowing, but the seeds are not viable after long storage, and germination rates are low after a year.

=== Japan ===

The bar graph shows the trend in total production of shiso in Japan, as given by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries

The biggest producer of shiso for the food market is Aichi Prefecture, boasting 3,852 tons, or 37.0% of national production (2008 data). Data for greenhouse production, which is a better indicator of crop yield, gives 3,528 tons for Aichi Prefecture, or 56% share of national production. The difference in percentage is an indicator that in Aichi, the leaves are 90% greenhouse produced, whereas nationwide the ratio is 60:40 in favor of indoors over open fields. In Aichi Prefecture, the city of Toyohashi produces the most shiso in Japan. They are followed in ranking by Namegata, Ibaraki.

There seems to be a growth spurt for shiso crops grown for industrial use. The data shows the following trend for crops targeted for oil and perfumery.

==== History ====
Green shiso was not industrially grown until the 1960s. Production volume remained negligible until 1976. Several accounts exist regarding the beginnings of shiso production.

According to one anecdote, in 1961, a food co-operative from Shizuoka specializing in &quot;tsuma&quot; (garnishes) began shipping green shiso to the Osaka market, where it grew so popular the name &quot;ōba&quot; (大葉 &quot;big leaf&quot;) became the trade name for bunches of picked green leaves.

Another account places the start of green shiso production origin in the city of Toyohashi, the foremost &quot;ōba&quot; producer in the country. It claims that the Toyohashi Greenhouse Horticultural Agricultural Cooperative experimented with planting green shiso around 1955, and started merchandising the leaves as &quot;ōba&quot; around 1962. In 1963 they organized &quot;cooperative sorting and sales&quot; of the crop, and achieved year-round production around 1970.

In the 1970s refrigerated storage and transport became available, bringing fresh produce and seafood to areas away from farms or seaports. Foods like sashimi became daily fare, and so too did sashimi garnishes like green shiso.

The word &quot;ōba&quot; was originally a trade name and was not listed in the popular dictionary &quot;Shin Meikai Kokugo Jiten&quot; as &quot;green shiso&quot; until its 5th edition (1997).

<text>Genrikh Grigoryevich Yagoda (, born Yenokh Gershevich Iyeguda; 7 November 1891 – 15 March 1938) was a Soviet secret police official who served as director of the NKVD, the Soviet Union&#x27;s security and intelligence agency, from 1934 to 1936. Appointed by Joseph Stalin, Yagoda supervised arrests, show trials, and executions of the Old Bolsheviks Lev Kamenev and Grigory Zinoviev, climactic events of the Great Purge. Yagoda also supervised construction of the White Sea–Baltic Canal with Naftaly Frenkel, using penal labor from the gulag system, during which 12,000–25,000 laborers died.

Like many Soviet NKVD officers who conducted political repression, Yagoda himself ultimately became a victim of the Purge. He was demoted from the directorship of the NKVD in favor of Nikolai Yezhov in 1936 and arrested in 1937. Charged with crimes of wrecking, espionage, Trotskyism and conspiracy, Yagoda was a defendant at the Trial of the Twenty-One, the last of the major Soviet show trials of the 1930s. Following his confession at the trial, Yagoda was found guilty and shot.

==Early life==

Yagoda was born in Rybinsk into a Jewish family. The son of a jeweller, trained as a statistician, who worked as a pharmacist&#x27;s assistant, he claimed that he was an active revolutionary from the age of 14 when he worked as a compositor on an underground printing press in Nizhny Novgorod, and that at the age of 15 he was a member of a fighting squad in the Sormovo district of Nizhny Novgorod, during the violent suppression of the 1905 revolution. He said he joined the Bolsheviks in Nizhny Novgorod at the age of 16 or 17 and was arrested and sent into exile in 1911. In 1913, he moved to St. Petersburg to work at the Putilov steel works. After the outbreak of war, he joined the army, and was wounded in action.

There is another version of his early career, told in the memoirs of the former NKVD officer Aleksandr M. Orlov, who alleged that Yagoda invented his early revolutionary career and did not join the Bolsheviks until 1917, and that his deputy Mikhail Trilisser was dismissed from service for trying to expose the lie.

== Political career ==
After the October Revolution of 1917, Yagoda rose rapidly through the ranks of the Cheka (the predecessor of the OGPU and NKVD) to become the second deputy of Felix Dzerzhinsky, the head of the Cheka, in September 1923. After Dzerzhinsky&#x27;s appointment as chairman of the Supreme Council of National Economy in January 1924, Yagoda became the deputy chief and the real manager of the State Political Directorate (OGPU), as the chairman Vyacheslav Menzhinsky had little authority because of his serious illness. In 1924, he joined the USSR&#x27;s head of government, Alexei Rykov on a ship tour of the Volga. An American journalist who was allowed to join them on the trip described Yagoda as &quot;a spare, slightly-tanned, trim looking, youngish officer&quot; adding that it was &quot;difficult to associate terror with the affable and modest person&quot;. By contrast, the chemist Vladimir Ipatieff met Yagoda briefly in Moscow in 1918 and later recorded that he had thought that &quot;it was unusual for a young man in his early twenties to be so unpleasant. I felt then that it would be unlucky for me or anyone else ever to fall into his hands.&quot; When he saw him again in 1927, &quot;his appearance had changed considerably: he had grown fatter and looked much older and very dignified and important.&quot;

Though Yagoda appears to have known Joseph Stalin since 1918, when they were both stationed in Tsaritsyn during the civil war, &quot;he was never Stalin&#x27;s man&quot;. When Stalin ordered that the Soviet Union&#x27;s entire rural population were to be forced onto collective farms, Yagoda is reputed to have sympathised with Bukharin and Rykov, his opponents on the right of the communist party. Nikolai Bukharin claimed in a leaked private conversation in July 1928 that &quot;Yagoda and Trilisser are with us&quot;, but once it became apparent that the right was losing the power struggle, Yagoda switched allegiance. In the contemptuous opinion of Bukharin&#x27;s widow, Anna Larina, Yagoda &quot;traded his personal views for the sake of his career&quot; and degenerated into a &quot;criminal&quot; and a &quot;miserable coward&quot;.

Yagoda continued to be an effective head of the OGPU until July 1931, when the Old Bolshevik Ivan Akulov was appointed First Deputy Chairman, and Yagoda was demoted to the post of Second Deputy. Akulov was dismissed and Yagoda reinstated in October 1932, After Yagoda&#x27;s fall, one of his former colleagues confessed: &quot;We met Akulov with violent hostility ... the entire party organisation in the OGPU was devoted to sabotaging Akulov.&quot; Stalin must have agreed to his reinstatement with ill grace, because four years later he accused the OGPU/NKVD of being four years behind in rooting out the Trotskyite-Zinovievite bloc, although Yagoda had been complicit in the execution of one of Trotsky&#x27;s sympathisers, Yakov Blumkin, and in sending others to the Gulag, the system of forced labour created under his supervision.

Prior to 1929, the only labor camp in the USSR was the Solovki Special Purpose Camp, which fell under the purview of the OGPU. As deputy head of the OGPU, Yagoda organized construction of the White Sea–Baltic Canal using forced labor at breakneck speed between 1931 and 1933, though at the cost of huge casualties. The construction of the Moscow–Volga Canal was started under his watch, but completed only after his fall by his successor Nikolai Yezhov. For his contribution to the Baltic canal&#x27;s construction, he was later awarded the Order of Lenin. Yagoda greatly expanded the use of prison labor to assist with the building of the Berezniki Works chemical plant and other projects. From 1929 to 1930, the number of prison laborers in OGPU camps expanded from 22,848 to 155,000, and after November 1930 became known as the Main Camp Administration, or GULAG system.

Yagoda had founded a secret poison laboratory of OGPU that was at Stalin&#x27;s disposal. It was later alleged during the later show-trial of Yagoda that his former NKVD boss, Vyacheslav Menzhinsky, was slowly poisoned during two weeks by two assistants of Yagoda. However, Menzhinsky was ill for several years before he died; this may have been a false testimony. Menhzinsky&#x27;s death was followed one day later by the death of Max Peshkov, the son of Maxim Gorky, the doyen of Soviet literature. Yagoda had been cultivating Gorky as a potentially useful contact since 1928 and employed Gorky&#x27;s secretary, Pyotr Kryuchkov, as a spy. &quot;Whenever Gorky met Stalin or other members of the Politburo, Yagoda would visit Kryuchkov&#x27;s flat afterward, demanding a full account of what had been said. He took to visiting public baths with Kryuchkov. One day in 1932, Yagoda handed his valuable spy $4,000 to buy a car.&quot; He had developed an obsession with Max Peshkov&#x27;s wife, Timosha, and visited her daily when she was newly widowed, though her mother denied that they were ever lovers. According to Arkady Vaksberg and other researchers, Yagoda poisoned Maxim Gorky and his son on the orders of Joseph Stalin.

===NKVD Chief===

On 10 July 1934, two months after Menzhinsky&#x27;s death, Joseph Stalin appointed Yagoda People&#x27;s Commissar for Internal Affairs, a position that included oversight of both the regular and the secret police, the NKVD. He was in charge of investigating the Kirov assassination. At some point, it was discovered by the NKVD that a conspiratorial Opposition Bloc had been formed in 1932, by Leon Trotsky and various other Soviet politicians like Lev Kamenev and Grigory Zinoviev. Yagoda then worked closely with Andrei Vyshinsky in organizing the first Moscow Show Trial, which resulted in prosecution and subsequent execution of Zinoviev and Kamenev in August 1936, beginning the Great Purge.
The Red Army high command was not spared and its ranks were thinned by Yagoda, as a precursor to the later and more extensive purge in the Soviet military. More than a quarter of a million people were arrested during the 1934–1935 period; the GULAG system was vastly expanded under his stewardship, and penal labor became a major developmental resource in the Soviet economy.

Stalin became increasingly disillusioned with Yagoda&#x27;s performance. In the middle of 1936, Stalin received a report from Yagoda detailing the unfavorable public reaction abroad to the show trials and the growing sympathy among the Soviet population for the executed defendants. The report enraged Stalin, interpreting it as Yagoda&#x27;s advice to stop the show trials and in particular to abandon the planned purge of Mikhail Tukhachevsky, Marshal of the Soviet Union and the former commander in chief of the Red Army. Stalin was already unhappy with Yagoda&#x27;s services, mostly due to mismanagement of Kirov&#x27;s assassination and his failure to fabricate &quot;proofs&quot; of ties between Kamenev and Zinoviev and the Okhrana (the tsarist security organization). As one Soviet official put it, &quot;The Boss forgets nothing.&quot;

On August 22, Mikhail Tomsky committed suicide after learning that he would be charged with counterrevolution. Before committing suicide, he told his wife to tell the investigators that it was Yagoda who drove him to the path of opposition, which was later found by Yezhov. Another possible reason Stalin did not trust Yagoda was his failure to report the existence of the Bloc of Oppositions earlier. On 25 September 1936, Stalin sent a telegram (co-signed by Andrei Zhdanov) to the members of the Politburo. The telegram read:
&quot;We consider it absolutely necessary and urgent that Comrade Yezhov be appointed to head the People&#x27;s Commissariat of Internal Affairs. &quot;Yagoda has obviously proved unequal to the task of exposing the Trotskyite–Zinovievite bloc&quot;. The GPU was four years late in this matter. All party heads and most of the NKVD agents in the region are talking about this.&quot;

A day later, he was replaced by Nikolai Yezhov. There are two theories as to why Yagoda did not report on the bloc earlier. He may have found out about it only in 1936, or he knew about its activities for some time but covered it up because of his sympathies to the opposition. According to the anti-communist soviet defector Grigori Tokaev, who was an underground participant in an oppositional group, the opposition was working with parts of the police and Yagoda himself:He [Yagoda] was removed from the NKVD, and we lost a strong link in our opposition intelligence service. ... The NKVD, now headed by Yezhov, took another step forward. The Little Politbureau had penetrated the Yenukidze–Sheboldayev and the Yagoda–Zelinsky conspiracies and broken through the opposition&#x27;s links within the central institutions of the political police.Yagoda was demoted to the post of People&#x27;s Commissar for Communications of the USSR.

===Arrest, trial and execution===
In March 1937, Yagoda was arrested on Stalin&#x27;s orders. Yezhov announced Yagoda&#x27;s arrest for diamond smuggling, corruption and working as a German agent since joining the party in 1917. Yezhov even blamed Yagoda for an attempt to assassinate him by sprinkling mercury around his office. He was accused of poisoning Maxim Gorky and his son. It was discovered that Yagoda&#x27;s two Moscow apartments and his dacha contained, besides a large collection of female clothing and apparel, 3,904 pornographic photos, 11 pornographic films, 165 pornographically carved pipes and cigarette holders, one rubber dildo, the two bullets that killed Zinoviev and Kamenev and 549 books—some of which were Trotskyist works. Yezhov took over the apartments. He had spent four million rubles decorating his three homes, boasting that his garden had &quot;2,000 orchids and roses&quot;.

Yagoda was found guilty of treason and conspiracy against the Soviet government at the Trial of the Twenty-One in March 1938. He denied he was a spy, but admitted most other charges. Solzhenitsyn describes Yagoda as expecting clemency from Stalin after the show trial: &quot;Just as though Stalin had been sitting right there in the hall, Yagoda confidently and insistently begged him directly for mercy: &#x27;I appeal to you! &quot;For you&quot; I built two great canals!&#x27; And a witness reports that at just that moment a match flared in the shadows behind a window on the second floor of the hall, apparently behind a muslin curtain, and, while it lasted, the outline of a pipe could be seen.&quot;

Yagoda was summarily shot after the trial. During the execution, Yagoda and Bukharin were seated on chairs and forced to watch the execution of others sentenced to death; they were last to be shot. Before the execution Yagoda was also beaten by Izrail Dagin by the order of Yezhov. In 1988, on the 50th anniversary of the trial, the Soviet authorities belatedly cleared all of the other 20 defendants of any criminal offence, admitting that the entire trial was built on false confessions. Yagoda was the only defendant not to be posthumously rehabilitated.

=== Family ===
Yagoda&#x27;s father, Grigori, the jeweller, who was aged 78 in 1938, wrote directly to Stalin disowning &quot;our only surviving son&quot; because of &quot;his grave crimes&quot;. This contrition was not enough to save him, or his wife, from being arrested and dying in labour camps. He had two brothers. One was killed during the suppression of the revolt in Sormovo in 1905; the other was shot for taking part in a mutiny in a regiment during the war with Germany. Their sister, Lilya, was arrested on 7 May 1937, and shot on 16 July. She was photographed before her execution, as was normal for condemned prisoners. That photograph was retrieved from KGB archives and published in the book &quot;Ordinary Citizens&quot; by David King.

Yagoda&#x27;s wife was Ida Averbakh (Russian Wikipedia), one of whose uncles, Yakov Sverdlov, was a prominent Bolshevik, and another, Zinovy Peshkov, was the adopted son of the writer Maxim Gorky. She was shot on 16 July 1938. Her brother, Leopold Averbakh, was shot in August 1937. Their father was also shot.

<text>A query language, also known as data query language or database query language (DQL), is a computer language used to make queries in databases and information systems. In database systems, query languages rely on strict theory to retrieve information. A well known example is the Structured Query Language (SQL).

==Types==
Broadly, query languages can be classified according to whether they are &quot;database&quot; query languages or &quot;information retrieval&quot; query languages. The difference is that a database query language attempts to give factual answers to factual questions, while an information retrieval query language attempts to find documents containing information that is relevant to an area of inquiry. Other types of query languages include:

* Full-text. The simplest query language is treating all terms as bag of words that are to be matched with the postings in the inverted index and where subsequently ranking models are applied to retrieve the most relevant documents. Only tokens are defined in the CFG. Web search engines often use this approach.
* Boolean. A query language that also supports the use of the Boolean operators AND, OR, NOT. 
* Structured. A language that supports searching within (a combination of) fields when a document is structured and has been indexed using its document structure. 
* Natural language. A query language that supports natural language by parsing the natural language query to a form that can be best used to retrieve relevant documents, for example with Question answering systems or conversational search.

==Examples==

* Attempto Controlled English is a query language that is also a controlled natural language.
* AQL is a query language for the ArangoDB native multi-model database system.
* .QL is a proprietary object-oriented query language for querying relational databases; successor of Datalog;
* CodeQL is the analysis engine used by developers to automate security checks, and by security researchers to perform variant analysis on GitHub.
* Contextual Query Language (CQL) a formal language for representing queries to information retrieval systems such as web indexes or bibliographic catalogues.
* Cypher is a query language for the Neo4j graph database;
* DMX is a query language for data mining models;
* Datalog is a query language for deductive databases;
* F-logic is a declarative object-oriented language for deductive databases and knowledge representation.
* FQL enables you to use a SQL-style interface to query the data exposed by the Graph API. It provides advanced features not available in the Graph API.
* Gellish English is a language that can be used for queries in Gellish English Databases, for dialogues (requests and responses) as well as for information modeling and knowledge modeling;
* Gremlin is an Apache Software Foundation graph traversal language for OLTP and OLAP graph systems.
* GraphQL is a data query language developed by Facebook as an alternate to REST and ad-hoc webservice architectures.
* HTSQL is a query language that translates HTTP queries to SQL;
* ISBL is a query language for PRTV, one of the earliest relational database management systems;
* Jaql is a functional data processing and query language most commonly used for JSON query processing;
* jq is a functional programming language often used for processing queries against one or more JSON documents, including very large ones;
* JSONiq is a declarative query language designed for collections of JSON documents;
* LDAP is an application protocol for querying and modifying directory services running over TCP/IP;
* LogiQL is a variant of Datalog and is the query language for the LogicBlox system.
* M Formula language, a mashup query language used in Microsoft&#x27;s Power Query
* MQL is a cheminformatics query language for a substructure search allowing beside nominal properties also numerical properties;
* MDX is a query language for OLAP databases;
* N1QL is a Couchbase&#x27;s query language finding data in Couchbase Servers;
* Object Query Language
* OCL (Object Constraint Language). Despite its name, OCL is also an object query language and an OMG standard;
* OPath, intended for use in querying WinFS &quot;Stores&quot;;
* Poliqarp Query Language is a special query language designed to analyze annotated text. Used in the Poliqarp search engine;
* PQL is a special-purpose programming language for managing process models based on information about that these models describe;
* PRQL PRQL (Pipelined Relational Query Language) is a modern language for transforming data. Consists of a curated set of orthogonal transformations, which are combined together to form a pipeline.
* PTQL based on relational queries over program traces, allowing programmers to write expressive, declarative queries about program behavior.
* QUEL is a relational database access language, similar in most ways to SQL;
* RDQL is a RDF query language;
* SMARTS is the cheminformatics standard for a substructure search;
* SPARQL is a query language for RDF graphs;
* SQL is a well known query language and data manipulation language for relational databases;
* XQuery is a query language for XML data sources;
* XPath is a declarative language for navigating XML documents;
* YQL is an SQL-like query language created by Yahoo!
* Search engine query languages, e.g., as used by Google or Bing

<text>Raymond Watts (also known by his former stage names Nainz, Nainz Watts and Ray Scaballero) is an English musician, the founding and sole member of the industrial music project PIG, sometimes written as &lt;PIG&gt;.

Watts was an early member and periodic collaborator of KMFDM, and has been a visible part of the industrial music scene since the early 1980s. He has toured with KMFDM, Nine Inch Nails, Schaft, Schwein, and Einstürzende Neubauten.

==History==
=== Recent activity (2010–present) ===
Watts, Dr. Shinto and John Gosling released a four-song EP titled &quot;Mellan Rummen&quot; on 15 November 2010 on Amazon.com.

On 8 June 2012, Marc Heal revealed a demo version of &quot;the first new PIG track in eight years&quot; titled &quot;Drugzilla (Rough As A Hog&#x27;s Arse Mix)&quot; via Cubanate&#x27;s Official Facebook page and providing their followers a link to his personal SoundCloud page. The link was reposted by Watts a few hours later. A second demo titled &quot;Shake&quot; was released on 15 July 2012; again via Heal&#x27;s Soundcloud page, this time also noting Dan Abela as engineer. In November 2014, Watts approved mixes for an upcoming joint-release EP.

In March 2015, another collaborative EP was announced with Primitive Race titled &quot;Long in the Tooth&quot; with a worldwide release date of 5 June 2015 through Metropolis Records. Later that month in an interview, Watts revealed a new PIG album has been written and recorded. Former KMFDM bandmate En Esch will be providing final touches to the album.

On 15 June 2016, the official PIG Facebook page announced that the new PIG album titled &quot;The Gospel&quot; would be released on 9 September 2016 on Metropolis. Soon after. tour dates were announced The American Excess tour with opening bands En Esch &amp; Peter Turns Pirate. The North American tour takes place in September and October 2016. A remix album, &quot;Swine &amp; Punishment&quot;, was released in 2017.

In 2018, PIG released the album &quot;Risen&quot;, supported by another North American tour. 2019 saw the release of a collection of cover songs on an LP titled &quot;Candy&quot;. The release of &quot;Candy&quot; was followed in the fall of the same year by the Divine Descent North American Tour, supported by Cyanotic and A Primitive Evolution. The Divine Descent Tour concluded on 6 October 2019 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. A brief tour of the United Kingdom followed.

In 2020, PIG released a compilation album, &quot;Pain Is God&quot;, which featured some new tracks and included songs from prior tour EPs dating back to the previous year. The album was released digitally, and on CD and vinyl, including special edition packages with unique 3D features in the digipack or record sleeve.

In 2022, PIG released the album &quot;The Merciless Light&quot;. In 2023, a remixed and remastered version of &quot;Candy&quot; titled &quot;Candy (Rewrapped)&quot; was released.

In 2024, PIG released the album &quot;Red Room&quot;, featuring Alexis Mincolla of the band 3TEETH on the song &quot;Crumbs Chaos &amp; Lies.&quot; Also in 2024, PIG released the EP &quot;Feast of Agony&quot;.

On 30 January 2025, the music video for the song &quot;Everything&quot; off of the 1996 album &quot;Wrecked&quot; was uploaded to the PIG YouTube channel, in conjunction with the announcement that a remastered version of the album, containing all of the tracks featured on both the Japanese and U.S. versions of the album, would be released on March 7th. This directly follows the 2023 remaster of &quot;The Swining/Red Raw &amp; Sore&quot; and the 2024 remaster of &quot;Sinsation&quot;.

==Musical style==
PIG tends to sound more orchestral than KMFDM, with darker, more complex, more ambient beats. His album and song titles tend to be witty, rife with alliteration (&quot;Prayer Praise &amp; Profit&quot;) or are plays on the titles of popular works or phrases (&quot;The Swining&quot; / &quot;Symphony for the Devil&quot;). He also manages to work food, heroin or pork related terms into his albums. Like KMFDM, humor features prominently in PIG&#x27;s lyrics, although they tend towards a darker/grittier tone than KMFDM&#x27;s.

==Collaboration with KMFDM==
Because Raymond Watts is a central figure in both PIG and KMFDM, the two projects have seen much crossover. Watts has contributed his skills as a songwriter and vocalist to several KMFDM albums, including their first album &quot;Opium&quot; in 1984, and has a heavy presence on their 1995 album &quot;Nihil&quot;, which spawned the hit &quot;Juke Joint Jezebel&quot;. A collaborative EP titled &quot;Sin Sex &amp; Salvation&quot; was released in 1994 under the moniker &quot;PIG vs. KMFDM&quot;. KMFDM has in turn assisted Watts with his PIG projects in production and personnel. Current KMFDM guitarists Steve White and Jules Hodgson (as well as former KMFDM guitarist Günter Schulz)
and drummer Andy Selway have been involved with PIG. Watts has performed with KMFDM as part of the touring lineup, with the concerts billed as &quot;KMFDM featuring PIG&quot;. The setlists for those shows feature KMFDM songs alongside Pig songs. A live CD from the 2002 &quot;Sturm &amp; Drang&quot; tour was released on Metropolis Records that same year.

Watts was given a tongue-in-cheek description in the lyrics to the KMFDM song &quot;Intro&quot; from the 2003 album &quot;WWIII&quot;:

In 2024, a deluxe edition of &quot;Sin Sex &amp; Salvation&quot; was released.

<text>are a Japanese form of self-government which focuses on local issues below the prefectural level. It acts as part of the greater administration of the state and as part of a self-government system. 

==History==
They were given a definite form in 1878 (&quot;Meiji 11&quot;). 

The Meiji government established the as an administrative unit. 

In 1888 (&quot;Meiji 21&quot;), the sub-prefecture as a form of self-government was officially as more general than civic corporations like cities, towns and villages. 
Certain prefectures of Japan are now, or once were, divided into subprefectures. The subprefecture is the jurisdiction surrounding a &quot;branch office&quot; of the prefectural government. Normally, the area of a subprefecture consists of a few to a dozen cities, towns, and/or villages. Subprefectures are formed to provide services of the prefectural government in geographically remote areas. They are usually not used in postal addresses.

==Existing subprefectures==
*Hokkaidō, the largest prefecture by area in Japan, was divided into fourteen subprefectures. These were formed in 1897. The subprefectures did not include major cities, such as Sapporo and Hakodate, until 1922. In 2010 they were replaced by 9 General Subprefectural Bureaus and 5 Subprefectural Bureaus. &quot;See: Subprefectures in Hokkaidō&quot;
*Kagoshima has two subprefectures, Ōshima and Kumage, located in Amami and Nishinoomote respectively. They cover the islands between Kagoshima and Okinawa.
*Miyazaki contains a single subprefecture, Nishiusuki, a remote mountain district in the northwest corner of the prefecture.
*Tokyo contains four subprefectures that provide administrative services to residents of outlying islands under the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. The four branch offices are located at Hachijō, Miyake, Ogasawara and Ōshima.
*Shimane contains one subprefecture governing the Oki Islands. This is the closest Japanese government office to Liancourt Rocks, a small island group held by South Korea but claimed by Japan.
*Yamagata is divided into four subprefectures, each of which is located in one of the four main urban areas of the prefecture (Yamagata, Shinjo, Yonezawa and Shonai plains).

==Historical subprefectures==
*Hyōgo, another geographically large prefecture, was divided into ten subprefectures, but these are now known as .
*Chiba was divided into five subprefectures until 2003, when the branch offices were renamed .
*Nagasaki had three subprefectures that provide services to the outlying islands of Tsushima, Iki and Gotō. They were replaced by Regional Offices and then by District Offices.
*Okinawa had two subprefectures, Miyako and Yaeyama, located on the islands of Miyakojima and Ishigaki respectively. These offices provided prefectural government services to the isolated archipelagos surrounding both islands. They were abolished in March 2009 and duties taken over by the governments of Miyakojima City, Miyako District, Ishigaki City, and Yaeyama District.

In addition, in 1907 Japan formed Karafuto Prefecture to govern the island of Sakhalin. Karafuto was divided into four subprefectures: Toyohara (in present-day Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk), Maoka (in present-day Kholmsk), Esutoru (in present-day Uglegorsk) and Shikuka (in present-day Makarov).

A number of islands gained by Japan in the Treaty of Versailles were placed under the direction of a from 1922 to 1945. This was divided into six subprefectures, on the islands of Saipan, Yap, Palau, Truk, Pohnpei and Jaluit. In November 1943, the six subprefectures were merged into &quot;eastern&quot;, &quot;western&quot; and &quot;northern&quot; subprefectures, which remained in place until the Surrender of Japan in 1945.
Taiwan during Japanese rule initially had its prefectures – , later termed and – subdivided into &quot;&quot;. Most of the later subprefectures were named . 
Some English texts translate &quot;sub-prefecture&quot; differently, using it instead for the &#x27; of Taiwan, which were remote prefectures that were much less populated, once considered &quot;sub-&quot;, or &quot;lesser&quot;, prefectures, i.e., Hōko (the Pescadores), Karenkō (Hualien) and Taitō (Taitung). The offshore Hōko was home to the last two remaining subprefectures named &#x27;: and .

<doc id="494540" wikidata="Q141860" url="?curid=494540" title="Nikolai Yezhov">
<text>Nikolai Ivanovich Yezhov (; 1 May 1895 – 4 February 1940), also spelt Ezhov, was a Soviet secret police official under Joseph Stalin who was head of the NKVD from 1936 to 1938, during the height of the Great Purge. Yezhov organized mass arrests, torture, and executions during the Great Purge, but he fell from Stalin&#x27;s favour and was arrested, subsequently admitting in a confession to a range of anti-Soviet activity including &quot;unfounded arrests&quot; during the Purge. He was executed in 1940 along with others who were blamed for the Purge.

== Early life and career ==
Yezhov was born either in Saint Petersburg, according to his official Soviet biography, or in southwest Lithuania (probably Veiveriai, Marijampolė or Kaunas). Although Yezhov claimed to be born in Saint Petersburg, hoping to &quot;portray (himself) in the guise of a deeply-rooted proletarian&quot;, he confessed when interrogated that his father Ivan Yezhov came from a well-off Russian peasant family from the village of Volkhonshino. He worked as a musician, railroad switchman, forest warden, head of a brothel, and as a housepainting contractor employing a couple of hired workers. His mother Anna Antonovna Yezhova was Lithuanian. Despite writing in his official biographical forms that he knew Lithuanian and Polish, he denied this in his later interrogations.

He completed only his elementary education. From 1909 to 1915, he worked as a tailor&#x27;s assistant and factory worker. From 1915 until 1917, Yezhov served in the Imperial Russian Army. He joined the Bolsheviks on 5 May 1917, in Vitebsk, six months before the October Revolution. During the Russian Civil War (1917–1922), he fought in the Red Army. After February 1922, he worked in the political system, mostly as a secretary of various regional committees of the Communist Party. In 1927, he was transferred to the Accounting and Distribution Department of the Party where he worked as an instructor and acting head of the department. From 1929 to 1930, he was the Deputy People&#x27;s Commissar for Agriculture. In November 1930, he was appointed to the Head of several departments of the Communist Party: department of special affairs, department of personnel and department of industry. In 1934, he was elected to the Central Committee of the Communist Party; in the next year he became a secretary of the Central Committee. From February 1935 to March 1939, he was also the Chairman of the Central Commission for Party Control.

Nadezhda Mandelstam, who met Yezhov at Sukhum in the early thirties, did not perceive anything ominous in his manner or appearance; her impression of him was that of a &quot;modest and rather agreeable person&quot;.

== Head of the NKVD ==
A turning point for Yezhov came with Stalin&#x27;s response to the 1934 murder of the Bolshevik chief of Leningrad, Sergei Kirov. Stalin used the murder as a pretext for further purges, and he personally chose Yezhov to carry out the task. Yezhov oversaw falsified accusations in the Kirov murder case against opposition leaders Kamenev, Zinoviev, and their supporters. Yezhov&#x27;s success in this task led to his further promotion and ultimately to his appointment as head of the NKVD.

He was appointed People&#x27;s Commissar for Internal Affairs (head of the NKVD) and a member of the Central Committee on 26 September 1936, following the dismissal of Genrikh Yagoda. This appointment did not at first seem to suggest an intensification of the purge: &quot;Unlike Yagoda, Yezhov did not come out of the &#x27;organs&#x27;, which was considered an advantage&quot;.

Party leadership revocation and executions of those found guilty during the Moscow Trials was not a problem for Yezhov. Seeming to be a devout admirer of Stalin and not a member of the organs of state security, Yezhov was just the man Stalin needed to lead the NKVD and rid the government of potential opponents. Yezhov&#x27;s first task from Stalin was to personally investigate and conduct prosecution of his long-time Chekist mentor Yagoda, which he did with remorseless zeal. Yezhov ordered the NKVD to sprinkle mercury on the curtains of his office so that the physical evidence could be collected and used to support the charge that Yagoda was a German spy, sent to assassinate Yezhov and Stalin with poison and restore capitalism. Yezhov later admitted under interrogation on 5 May 1939 that he had fabricated the mercury poisoning to &quot;raise his authority in the eyes of the leadership of the country&quot;. It is also claimed that he personally tortured both Yagoda and Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky to extract their confessions.

In the &quot;Letter of an Old Bolshevik&quot; (1936), written by Boris Nicolaevsky, there is Bukharin&#x27;s description of Yezhov: 

Yagoda was but the first of many to die by Yezhov&#x27;s orders. Under Yezhov, the Great Purge reached its height during 1937–1938. 50–75% of the members of the Supreme Soviet and officers of the Soviet military were stripped of their positions and imprisoned, exiled to the Gulag in Siberia, or executed. In addition, a much greater number of ordinary Soviet citizens were accused (usually on flimsy or nonexistent evidence) of disloyalty or &quot;wrecking&quot; by local Chekist troikas and similarly punished to fill Stalin and Yezhov&#x27;s arbitrary quotas for arrests and executions. Yezhov also conducted a thorough purge of the security organs, both NKVD and GRU, removing and executing not only many officials who had been appointed by his predecessors Yagoda and Menzhinsky, but even his own appointees as well. Yezhov admitted that some innocent people were being falsely accused, but he dismissed their lives as being unimportant so long as the purge was successful: In 1937 and 1938 alone, at least 1.3 million were arrested and 681,692 were shot for &quot;crimes against the state&quot;. The Gulag population swelled by 685,201 under Yezhov, nearly tripling in size in just two years, with at least 140,000 of these prisoners (and likely many more) dying of malnutrition, exhaustion and the elements in the camps (or during transport to them).

== Fall from power ==
Yezhov was appointed People&#x27;s Commissar for Water Transport on 6 April 1938. During the Great Purge, acting on the orders from Stalin, he had accomplished liquidation of Old Bolsheviks and other potentially &quot;disloyal elements&quot; or &quot;fifth columnists&quot; within the Soviet military and government prior to the onset of war with Germany. The defection to Japan of the Far Eastern NKVD chief, Genrikh Lyushkov, on 13 June 1938, rightly worried Yezhov, who had earlier protected Lyushkov from the purges and now feared that he would be blamed for disloyalty.

== Final days ==
On 22 August 1938, NKVD leader Lavrenty Beria was named as Yezhov&#x27;s deputy. Beria had managed to survive the Great Purge and the &quot;Yezhovshchina&quot; during the years 1936–1938, even though he had almost become one of its victims. Earlier in 1938, Yezhov had even ordered the arrest of Beria, who was party chief in Georgia. However, Georgian NKVD chief Sergo Goglidze warned Beria, who immediately flew to Moscow to see Stalin personally. Beria convinced Stalin to spare his life and reminded Stalin how efficiently he had carried out party orders in Georgia and Transcaucasia. Yezhov eventually fell in the struggle for power, and Beria became the new NKVD chief.

Over the following months, Beria (with Stalin&#x27;s approval) began to usurp Yezhov&#x27;s governance of the Commissariat for Internal Affairs. As early as 8 September, Mikhail Frinovsky, Yezhov&#x27;s first deputy, was relocated from under his command into the Navy. Stalin&#x27;s penchant for periodically executing and replacing his primary lieutenants was well known to Yezhov, as he had previously been the man most directly responsible for orchestrating such actions.

Well acquainted with typical Stalinist bureaucratic precursors to eventual dismissal and arrest, Yezhov recognized Beria&#x27;s increasing influence with Stalin as a sign that his downfall was imminent, and he plunged headlong into alcoholism and despair. Already a heavy drinker, in the last weeks of his service, he reportedly was disconsolate, slovenly, and drunk nearly all of his waking hours, rarely bothering to show up to work. As anticipated, Stalin and Vyacheslav Molotov, in a report dated November 11, sharply criticised the work and methods of the NKVD during Yezhov&#x27;s tenure as chief, thus establishing the bureaucratic pretense necessary to remove him from power.

On 14 November, another of Yezhov&#x27;s protégés, the Ukrainian NKVD chief Aleksandr Uspensky, disappeared after being warned by Yezhov that he was in trouble. Stalin suspected that Yezhov was involved in the disappearance and told Beria, not Yezhov, that Uspensky must be caught (he was arrested on 14 April 1939). Yezhov had told his wife, Yevgenia, on 18 September that he wanted a divorce, and she had begun writing increasingly despairing letters to Stalin, none of which was answered. She was particularly vulnerable because of her many lovers, and for months people close to her were being arrested. On 19 November 1938, Yevgenia committed suicide by an overdose of sleeping pills.

At his own request, Yezhov was officially relieved of his post as the People&#x27;s Commissar for Internal Affairs on 25 November, succeeded by Beria, who had been in complete control of the NKVD since the departure of Frinovsky on 8 September. He attended his last Politburo meeting on 29 January 1939.

Stalin was evidently content to ignore Yezhov for several months, finally ordering Beria to denounce him at the annual Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. On 3 March 1939, Yezhov was relieved of all his posts in the Central Committee but retained his post as People&#x27;s Commissar of Water Transportation. His last working day was 9 April, at which time the &quot;People’s Commissariat was simply abolished by splitting it into two, the People’s Commissariats of the River Fleet and the Sea Fleet, with two new People’s Commissars, Z. A. Shashkov and S. S. Dukel’skii.&quot;

=== Arrest ===
On 10 April, Yezhov was arrested and imprisoned at the Sukhanovka prison; the &quot;arrest was painstakingly concealed, not only from the general public but also from most NKVD officers... It would not do to make a fuss about the arrest of &#x27;the leader’s favourite,&#x27; and Stalin had no desire to arouse public interest in NKVD activity and the circumstances of the conduct of the Great Terror.&quot; A letter from Beria, Andreyev and Malenkov to Stalin, dated 29 January 1939, accused the NKVD of allowing &quot;massive, unfounded arrests of completely innocent persons&quot;, and stated that the leadership of Yezhov &quot;did not put a stop to this kind of arbitrariness and extremism ... but sometimes itself abetted it.&quot;

In his confession, Yezhov admitted to the standard litany of state crimes necessary to mark him as an &quot;enemy of the people&quot; prior to execution, including &quot;wrecking&quot;, official incompetence, theft of government funds, and treasonous collaboration with German spies and saboteurs. Apart from these political crimes, he was also accused of and confessed to a humiliating history of sexual promiscuity, including homosexuality, rumors that were later deemed true by some post-Soviet examinations of the case.

=== Trial ===
On 2 February 1940, Yezhov was tried behind closed doors by the Military Collegium, chaired by Soviet judge Vasiliy Ulrikh. Yezhov, like his predecessor Yagoda, maintained to the end his love for Stalin. Yezhov denied being a spy, a terrorist, or a conspirator, stating that he preferred &quot;death to telling lies&quot;. He maintained that his previous confession had been obtained under torture, admitted that he had purged 14,000 of his fellow Chekists, but said that he was surrounded by &quot;enemies of the people&quot;.

Yezhov&#x27;s determination to assert his innocence was something few of the victims of the Stalinist purges shared. In his final statement at his trial, he defended his record vehemently, though it did not save his life.

After the secret trial, Yezhov was allowed to return to his cell; half an hour later, he was called back and told that he had been condemned to death. On hearing the verdict, Yezhov became faint and began to collapse, but the guards caught him and removed him from the room. An immediate appeal for clemency was denied, and Yezhov became hysterical and wept. He soon had to be dragged out of the room, struggling with the guards and screaming.

=== Execution ===
On 4 February 1940, Yezhov was shot by future KGB chairman Ivan Serov (or by Vasily Blokhin, in the presence of N. P. Afanasev, according to one book source) in the basement of a small NKVD station on Varsonofevskii Lane (Varsonofyevskiy pereulok) in Moscow. The basement had a sloping floor so that it could be hosed down after executions and had been built according to Yezhov&#x27;s own specifications near the Lubyanka. The main NKVD execution chamber in the basement of the Lubyanka was deliberately avoided to ensure total secrecy.

Yezhov&#x27;s body was immediately cremated, and his ashes dumped in a common grave at Moscow&#x27;s Donskoye Cemetery. The execution remained secret and as late as 1948, &quot;Time&quot; reported &quot;Some think he is still in an insane asylum&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Yezhov married Antonina Titova (), a minor Communist Party clerk, in 1917, but he later divorced her and married Yevgenia Feigenberg (Khayutina-Yezhova), a Soviet publishing worker and Chief Editor of &quot;USSR in Construction&quot; magazine who was known for her friendship with many Soviet writers and actors. Yezhov and Feigenburg had an adopted daughter, Natalia, an orphan from a children&#x27;s home. After Yevgenia&#x27;s and Yezhov&#x27;s deaths in late 1938 and 1940 respectively, Natalia was sent back to a local orphanage and was forced to relinquish the Yezhov surname. Subsequently, she was known by the name Natalia Khayutina.

=== Accusation of homosexuality ===
Yezhov was accused of homosexual acts. When Yezhov was arrested in 1939, he stated during his interrogation that he had many lovers, including Filipp Goloshchyokin, then party functionary in Kazakh ASSR, during the latter half of 1925, and that they had shared an apartment in Kyzylorda.

== Legacy ==
In Russia, Yezhov remains mostly known as the person who was responsible for atrocities of the Great Purge that he conducted on Stalin&#x27;s orders. Among historians, he also has the nickname &quot;The Vanishing Commissar&quot; because after his execution, his likeness was retouched out of an official press photo; he is among the best-known examples of the Soviet press making someone who had fallen out of favour &quot;disappear&quot;.

Yezhov was very short, standing , and that, combined with his perceived sadistic personality, led to his nickname &quot;The Poison Dwarf&quot; or &quot;The Bloody Dwarf&quot;.

Due to his role in the Great Purge, Yezhov has not been officially rehabilitated by the Soviet and Russian authorities.

== Honors and awards ==
* Order of Lenin
* Order of the Red Banner (Mongolia)
* Badge of &quot;Honorary Security Officer&quot;

A decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet on 24 January 1941 deprived Yezhov of all state and special awards.

<text>Ventspils () is a state city in northwestern Latvia in the historical Courland region of Latvia, and is the sixth largest city in the country.

At the beginning of 2020, Ventspils had a population of 33,906. It is situated on the Venta River and the Baltic Sea, and has an ice-free port. The city&#x27;s name literally means &quot;castle on the Venta&quot;, referring to the Livonian Order&#x27;s castle built alongside the Venta River.

==Other names==
Ventspils was historically known as &quot;Windau&quot; in German.

It had a Russian name from the time of the Russian Empire, called &quot;Виндава (Vindava)&quot; or &quot;Виндау (Vindau),&quot; although &quot;Вентспилс (Ventspils)&quot; has been used since World War II.

Some other names for the city include , Estonian: Vindavi, and .

== History ==
Ventspils developed around the Livonian Order Ventspils Castle, built along the Venta River. It was chartered in 1314 and became an important mercantile city of the Hanseatic League.

As part of the Duchy of Courland, Ventspils blossomed as a shipbuilding centre. 44 warships and 79 trading ships were built in the town, and it was from Ventspils that the Duke&#x27;s fleet set out to colonize Gambia and Tobago. Metal, amber, and wood-working shops also became important to the city&#x27;s development.

During the Polish-Swedish War and the Great Northern War, Ventspils was destroyed, and in 1711 a plague wiped out most of the remaining inhabitants. After the Third Partition of Poland-Lithuania in 1795 Ventspils fell under the control of Russian Empire.

It was not until about 1850 that shipbuilding and trade became important again. The port was modernized in the 1890s and connected to Moscow by rail. It became one of Imperial Russia&#x27;s most profitable ports, by 1913 turning a yearly profit of 130 million rubles. The population soared as well, growing from 7,000 in 1897, to 29,000 in 1913.

During the German occupation from 1915 to 1919, the population decreased almost by half, though some returned home during the First Republic of Latvia (1918–1940).

In 1939, the Red Army established a base in Ventspils. During World War II, the city was under Soviet occupation from 1940, and then under German occupation from 1941 to 1944. Under Soviet rule, an oil pipeline was built to Ventspils, and became the USSR&#x27;s leading port in crude oil export. north of Ventspils is the ex-Soviet radioastronomy installation VIRAC (&quot;Ventspils Starptautiskais radioastronomijas centrs&quot; or &quot;Ventspils International Radio Astronomy Centre&quot;). The existence of the &quot;Centrs&quot; was unknown to most Latvians until 1994. After independence, the Latvian government began a city-beautification process to make the city more attractive to tourists.

In 2004, Ventspils was a host city for a multi-national (United States, United Kingdom, Poland, Sweden, Russia, Latvia, Denmark, Finland, Norway) naval exercise called Baltic Operations XXXIII (BALTOPS). The force was led by the guided missile cruiser USS &quot;Anzio&quot; and the destroyer .

<text>The Learjet 60 is a mid-size cabin, medium-range business jet aircraft manufactured by Bombardier Aerospace in Wichita, Kansas. Powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW305A engines, it has a range (with 4 passengers and 2 crew) of with NBAA reserves, ISA. In July 2012 Bombardier Aerospace announced a temporary &quot;production pause&quot; of the latest variant Learjet 60XR to begin in the fourth quarter of 2012.

==Development==
The Learjet 60 is an improved version of the Learjet 55, with a longer fuselage and more powerful turbofan engines. It first flew on 10 October 1990 and received FAA certification in January 1993.

The modifications that converted the Learjet Model 55 into a Model 60 resulted from an aerodynamics improvement program and a need to increase the capacity of the Learjet product line. Several of these modifications were a first for Learjet, including an all-new inboard wing cuff added to the inboard sections of the “Longhorn” wing and an all-new wing-to-body fairing. By increasing the wing chord and the leading edge droop, the wing cuff improved handling during approach and landing, while the wing-to-body fairing reduced the interference drag between the wing and the fuselage. Since the engines were new for this aircraft, a new engine pylon had to be designed.

The lines of the cockpit have not changed but the fuselage was lengthened. In addition, the blend between the fuselage and the empennage was all new. While it appears as if area ruling was the intention of the blending, the blend design was really driven by attaching the original Learjet Model 35 empennage onto the larger Learjet Model 60 fuselage.

The final aerodynamic improvements to the Model 60 included the creation of the distinctive &quot;ogive&quot; winglet trailing edge. This lengthening of the chord near the interface of the winglet and the wing improved the interaction of the wing&#x27;s pressure spike with the winglet&#x27;s pressure spike. The result was a significant lowering of the drag in this area and a significant improvement of the wing&#x27;s efficiency. On the prior “Longhorn” wing the interference between the winglet and the wing nearly canceled the effects of the winglet. The single ventral fin was also replaced with two ventral fins that Learjet called &quot;Delta Fins&quot; to improve stall characteristics and promote aerodynamic stability.

The Learjet 60 is notable for its time-to-climb performance, climbing to in 18.5 minutes at maximum weight. It also distinguished as the last legacy Learjet, using a variation of the wing that designer Bill Lear adapted from the Swiss military aircraft, the FFA P-16. The next-generation Learjet was to be the Learjet 85 and was an all-new design by Bombardier Aerospace slated for delivery in 2013.

The Learjet 60, while a tremendous performer, also maintains the highest incident/accident rate in its class with most accidents occurring during landing. The use of the original Lear 23 gear and wheels (albeit it with an added brake rotor, bringing the total to 3 per wheel assembly) left the 60 (and the 55 before it) notably under-geared and under-braked. According to the NTSB most of these failures are caused by pilot-error as the aircraft can be unforgiving.

Production of the Learjet 60 ended in 2007 after 318 aircraft had been built. The Learjet 60XR was a variation with upgraded Proline 21 avionics and slight improvements to the cabin, with production beginning at serial number 319.

By 2018, a Learjet 60 could be purchased for $1 million or less.

===Learjet 60XR===
Bombardier launched a new variant in 2005 designated the Learjet 60XR and following certification deliveries started in 2007.

Grandfathered on the 1966 Learjet 24 type certificate,
it was built until 2013.
It features three-rotor disc brakes, good for 450–600 landings, Rockwell Collins Pro Line 21 avionics, upgraded AHRS and FMS, electronic charts, enhanced MFD and optional XM radio weather.
Cabin space is better utilized with five floor plans, LED lighting, better insulation and improved cabin management system.
The 60XR has the largest Learjet cabin, its cross-section is competitive but its length is shorter than other mid-size jets like the Hawker 800XP.
The small wing evolved from the Learjet 23, with the tip tanks replaced by winglets, and runway requirements are long for the aircraft.
A typically equipped 60XR weighs more than the original Model 60, tanks-full payload is and four-passenger range is .
It climbs to FL 410 in 18 min and cruise at TAS with an average fuel burn of /h.
Long-range cruise varies from TAS at FL 350–430 and ISA conditions, while normal cruise speed is Mach 0.76 or TAS.

The FADEC-controlled PW305A turbofans have a 6,000 h TBO and reserves amount to $360 per hour per engine.

In September 2018, there were 112 Model 60XRs in service, priced between $2.5 million for a 2007 model to $4.0 million for a 2013 one.

==Operators==

===Civilian===
The Learjet 60 is used by private operators, companies and fractional jet operators.

===Military and government===
==Incidents and accidents==
* On September 19, 2008, a Learjet 60 crashed while taking off from Columbia Metropolitan Airport in Columbia, South Carolina. Performers Travis Barker and DJ AM were injured, while both crew members and two other passengers were killed in the crash. 
:NTSB identified &quot;greatly underinflated tires&quot; and &quot;rejected takeoff after V1&quot; as probable causes for the crash; it was exacerbated by a tire breaking a microswitch which caused reverse thrust to become a forward thrust. After the post-accident investigation, the Federal Aviation Administration issued new directives for operators of the Learjet 60 and 60XR aircraft to check tire pressures every four days.

<doc id="494547" wikidata="Q460367" url="?curid=494547" title="Tōdai-ji">
<text>is a Buddhist temple complex that was once one of the powerful Seven Great Temples, located in the city of Nara, Japan. The construction of the temple was an attempt to imitate Chinese temples from the much-admired Tang dynasty. Though it was originally founded in the year 738 CE, Tōdai-ji was not opened until the year 752 CE. The temple has undergone several reconstructions since then, with the most significant reconstruction (that of the Great Buddha Hall) taking place in 1709. However, it was on the verge of collapse in the late 19th century due to the weight of its huge roof. So, the collapse was prevented through a first restoration(1904~1913), and its current appearance was completed using rebars and concretes between 1974 and 1980. Its Great Buddha Hall ( &quot;Daibutsuden&quot;) houses the world&#x27;s largest bronze statue of the Buddha Vairocana, known in Japanese as &quot;Daibutsu&quot; (). The temple also serves as the Japanese headquarters of the Kegon school of Buddhism. The temple is a listed UNESCO World Heritage Site as one of the &quot;Historic Monuments of Ancient Nara&quot;, together with seven other sites including temples, shrines and places in the city of Nara.

==History==

=== Origins ===

This temple was originally built by people from the Three Kingdoms of Korea, like Hōryū-ji. A Silla person was in charge of the overall construction, and the bronze Buddha statue was designed by a Baekje person. And the stone lion statue was made by a Chinese person.

Todaiji is well-known for the Nara Daibutsu, also known as &quot;The Great Buddha of Nara,&quot; which is an image of the Buddha Birushana. The current Buddha was repaired after suffering significant damage in 1692. Under the leadership of Abbot Shunjobo Chogen (1121–1206), numerous structures at Todaiji were rebuilt in 1180 in the fashion of the Southern Song dynasty of China.

During the Tenpyō era, Japan suffered from a series of disasters and epidemics. It was after experiencing these problems that Emperor Shōmu issued an edict in 741 to promote the construction of provincial temples throughout the nation. Later in 743 during the Tenpyō era the Emperor commissioned the Daibutsu to be built in 743. Tōdai-ji (still Kinshōsen-ji at the time) was appointed as the provincial temple of Yamato Province and the head of all the provincial temples. With the alleged coup d&#x27;état by Nagaya in 729, a major outbreak of smallpox around 735–737, worsened by several consecutive years of poor crops, followed by a rebellion led by Fujiwara no Hirotsugu in 740, the country was in a chaotic situation. Emperor Shōmu had been forced to move the capital four times, indicating a certain level of instability during this period.

=== Role in early Japanese Buddhism ===
According to legend, the monk Gyōki went to Ise Grand Shrine to reconcile Shinto with Buddhism. He spent seven days and nights reciting sutras until the oracle declared Vairocana Buddha compatible with worship of the sun goddess Amaterasu.
Under the Ritsuryō system of government in the Nara period, Buddhism was heavily regulated by the state through the . During this time, Tōdai-ji served as the central administrative temple for the provincial temples and for the six Buddhist schools in Japan at the time: the Hossō, Kegon, Jōjitsu, Sanron, Ritsu and Kusha. Letters dating from this time also show that all six Buddhist schools had offices at Tōdai-ji, complete with administrators, shrines and their own library.

Japanese Buddhism during this time still maintained the lineage of the Vinaya and all officially licensed monks were required to take their ordination under the Vinaya at Tōdai-ji. In 754 CE, ordination was given by Ganjin, who arrived in Japan after traveling over 12 years and six attempts of crossing the sea from China, to Empress Kōken, former Emperor Shōmu and others. Later Buddhist monks, including Kūkai and Saichō received their ordination here as well. During Kūkai&#x27;s administration of the Sōgō, additional ordination ceremonies were added to Tōdai-ji, including the ordination of the Bodhisattva Precepts from the Brahma Net Sutra and the esoteric Precepts, or Samaya, from Kukai&#x27;s own newly established Shingon school of Buddhism. Kūkai added an Abhiseka Hall to use for initiating monks of the six Nara schools into the esoteric teachings by 829 CE.

===Decline===
As the center of power in Japanese Buddhism shifted away from Nara to Mount Hiei and the Tendai sect, and when the 
centre of political power in Japan moved from the emperor&#x27;s
capital to the shōgun&#x27;s base in Kamakura in the aftermath of the Genpei war, Tōdai-ji&#x27;s role in maintaining authority declined. In later generations, the Vinaya lineage also died out, despite repeated attempts to revive it; thus no more ordination ceremonies take place at Tōdai-ji.

==Architecture==

===Initial construction===
In 743, Emperor Shōmu issued a law stating that the people should become directly involved with the establishment of new Buddhist temples throughout Japan. The Emperor believed that such piety would inspire Buddha to protect his country from further disaster. Gyōki, with his pupils, traveled the provinces asking for donations. According to records kept by Tōdai-ji, more than 2,600,000 people in total helped construct the Great Buddha and its Hall, contributing rice, wood, metal, cloth, or labour, with 350,000 working directly on the statue&#x27;s construction. The 16 m (52 ft) high statue was built through eight castings over three years, the head and neck being cast together as a separate element. The making of the statue was started first in Shigaraki. After enduring multiple fires and earthquakes, the construction was eventually resumed in Nara in 745, and the Buddha was finally completed in 751. A year later, in 752, the eye-opening ceremony was held with an attendance of 10,000 monks and 4,000 dancers to celebrate the completion of the Buddha. The Indian priest Bodhisena performed the eye-opening for Emperor Shōmu. The project cost Japan greatly, as the statue used much of Japan&#x27;s bronze and relied entirely on imported gold. 48 lacquered cinnabar pillars, 1.5 m in diameter and 30 m long, support the blue tiled roof of the Daibutsu-den.

Maps that include some of the original structures of Tōdai-ji are rare, though some still exist today. Some of these structures include, the two pagodas, the library, lecture hall, refectory, and the monk&#x27;s quarters located behind the main hall. Tōdai-ji functioned not only as a place of worship and Buddhist practice, but as a place of higher learning and study. Much of what contemporaries now know about the original layout of the temple comes from the writings of monks who lived and studied there.

The original complex contained two 100 m pagodas, making them some of the tallest structures at the time. They were located on either side of the complex, one on the western (西塔) and one on the eastern side (東塔). The pagodas themselves were surrounded by a walled courtyard with four gates. These were destroyed by an earthquake. One of the &quot;sōrin&quot; finials was reproduced for the 1970 Osaka Expo and is standing at the spot where one of the pagodas used to stand.

The Shōsōin was its storehouse, and now contains many artifacts from the Tenpyō period of Japanese history.

===Reconstructions post-Nara Period===

The Great Buddha Hall (&quot;Daibutsuden&quot;) has been rebuilt twice after fire. The current building was finished in 1709, and although immense— long, wide and high—it is actually 30% smaller than its predecessor, being reduced from 11 to 7 bays wide due to lack of funds. Until 1998, it was the world&#x27;s largest wooden building. It has been surpassed by modern structures, such as the Japanese baseball stadium Odate Jukai Dome, amongst others. The Great Buddha statue has been recast several times for various reasons, including earthquake damage. The current hands of the statue were made in the Momoyama Period (1568–1615), and the head was made in the Edo period (1615–1867).

The existing Nandaimon (Great South Gate) was constructed at the end of the 12th century based on Daibutsuyō style, after the original gate was destroyed by a typhoon during the Heian period. The dancing figures of the Nio, the two guardians at the Nandaimon, were built around the same time by the artists Unkei, Kaikei, and their workshop staff. The Nio are an &quot;A-un&quot; pair known as &quot;Ungyo&quot;, which by tradition has a facial expression with a closed mouth, and &quot;Agyo&quot;, which has an open mouthed expression. The two figures were closely evaluated and extensively restored by a team of art conservators between 1988 and 1993. Until then, these sculptures had never before been moved from the niches in which they were originally installed. This complex preservation project, costing $4.7 million, involved a restoration team of 15 experts from the National Treasure Repairing Institute in Kyoto.

By the 19th century, the Great Buddha Hall had become seriously deteriorated, and its roof and pillars had warped, and by the Meiji period, it had become so damaged that it was strange that it did not collapse.

However, Japan, which was Westernizing, was influenced by the West and developed the concept of protecting cultural properties, and the first large-scale restoration project was carried out from 1904 to 1913. However, even then, the warped roof could not be completely repaired, so instead, support beams were erected to prevent collapse. After that, it escaped the US air raids during World War II and was safe, and in 1974, the second large-scale construction project began. 

At this time, a new change occurred in the wooden structure of the Great Buddha Hall. A total of 100,000 people were mobilized for the construction. During this time, the roof was completely removed and fixed using steel frames, and the wooden pillars of the Great Buddha Hall were remodeled using steel frames and concrete. This construction was completed in 1980, This second large scale construction project resulted in the Great Buddha Hall having its current appearance.

===Dimensions of the Daibutsu===
The temple gives the following dimensions for the statue:
* Height: 
* Face: 
* Eyes: 
* Nose: 
* Ears: 

The statue&#x27;s shoulders are 28 meters across and there are 960 six curls atop its head. The Birushana Buddha&#x27;s golden halo is in diameter with 16 images each tall.

Using x-rays, a human tooth, along with pearls, mirrors, swords, and jewels have been discovered inside the knee of the Great Buddha; these are believed to be the relics of Emperor Shomu.

The statue weighs .
== Temple precincts and gardens ==

Various buildings of the Tōdai-ji have been incorporated within the overall aesthetic intention of the gardens&#x27; design. Adjacent villas are today considered part of Tōdai-ji. Some of these structures are now open to the public.

Over the centuries, the buildings and gardens have evolved together as to become an integral part of an organic and living temple community.

The Tōdai-ji Culture Center opened on October 10, 2011, comprising a museum to exhibit the many sculptures and other treasures enshrined in the various temple halls, along with a library and research centre, storage facility, and auditorium.

==Japanese national treasures==
The architectural master-works are classified as:

==Major historical events==

* 728: Kinshōsen-ji, the forerunner of Tōdai-ji, is established as a gesture of appeasement for the troubled spirit of Prince Motoi.
* 741: Emperor Shōmu calls for nationwide establishment of provincial temples, and Kinshōsen-ji appointed as the head provincial temple of Yamato.
* 743: The Emperor commands that a very large Buddha image statue shall be built—the &quot;Daibutsu&quot; or Great Buddha—and initial work is begun at Shigaraki-no-miya.
* 745: The capital returns to Heijō-kyō, construction of the Great Buddha resumes in Nara. Usage of the name Tōdai-ji appears on record.
* 752: The Eye-opening Ceremony celebrating the completion of the Great Buddha held.
* 855: The head of the great statue of the Buddha Vairocana suddenly fell to the ground; and gifts from the pious throughout the empire were collected to create another, more well-seated head for the restored Daibutsu.

==In popular culture==
Matsuo Bashō refers to the Great Buddha statue in a haiku (1689–1670):
初雪や / いつ大仏 / の柱立.
&quot;First snow!/ When Buddha&#x27;s great statue/ pillar-erection&quot;
And,
&quot;First snow and / there stands the great Buddha / a pillar of strength&quot;

Tōdai-ji has been used as a location in several Japanese films and television dramas. It was also used in the 1950s John Wayne movie &quot;The Barbarian and the Geisha&quot; when Nandaimon, the Great South Gate, doubled as a city&#x27;s gates.

On May 20, 1994, the international music festival &quot;The Great Music Experience&quot; was held at Tōdai-ji, supported by UNESCO. Performers included the Tokyo New Philharmonic Orchestra, X Japan, INXS, Jon Bon Jovi, Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan, Tomoyasu Hotei, Roger Taylor, classic Japanese drummers, and a Buddhist monk choir. This event, organized by British producer Tony Hollingsworth, was simultaneously broadcast in 55 countries on May 22 and 23, 1994.

The 2007 animation series Mononoke (モノノ怪), which is a spin-off of the 2006 horror anthology series , references the Tōdai-ji, particularly the treasure room Shōsōin, in Episodes 8 and 9.

The Tōdai-ji is used as the Japanese wonder in Age of Empires II.

The Tōdai-ji is the subject of the 2003 novella &quot;A Mountain to the North, A Lake to the South, Paths to the West, A River to the East&quot; (&quot;Északról hegy, Délről tó, Nyugatról utak, Keletről folyó&quot;) by László Krasznahorkai.

== International outreach ==
Following the catastrophic Notre-Dame de Paris fire in April 2019, Japanese authorities declared plans to expand fire prevention measures at several historic locations, including Tōdai-ji in Nara, partly by hiring new, younger employees in a context where temple and shrine staff are aging. Custodians of Todaiji temple also installed a donation box, stating &quot;Let&#x27;s Rebuild Notre Dame Cathedral&quot;, in the hallway behind the Great Buddha statue.  In June 2019, a sign next to the box, in Japanese and English, explained why Tōdai-ji, as headquarters of the Kegon sect of Buddhism, was soliciting funds in this way. The English version declared, &quot;Todai-ji temple has been reconstructed every time it burned down by big fires thanks to the significant effort of many people.  We sincerely express our deepest sympathy for the tragedy that hit the Notre-Dame de Paris. Going beyond the creed, we would like to ask everyone for your support to reconstruct the cathedral.&quot;

<text>Sandra Kay Yow (March 14, 1942 – January 24, 2009) was an American basketball coach. She was the head coach of the NC State Wolfpack women&#x27;s basketball team from 1975 to 2009. A member of the Naismith Hall of Fame, she had more than 700 career wins. She also coached the U.S. women&#x27;s basketball team to an Olympic gold medal in 1988 despite having been diagnosed with breast cancer in 1987. In 2000, Yow was inducted into the Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame. In 2009, she was inducted into the FIBA Hall of Fame.

In April 2010, CollegeInsider.com created a new award called the Kay Yow National Coach of the Year Award in her honor. It is presented annually to the women&#x27;s college basketball head coach who displays great personal character on and off the court.

==Education and coaching career==
Yow received her Bachelor of Science degree in English from East Carolina University in 1964, she was a member of the Delta Zeta sorority. After graduation she worked as English teacher, librarian and girls&#x27; basketball coach at Allen Jay High School in High Point, North Carolina. She then earned her Master&#x27;s degree in Physical Education from UNC-Greensboro in 1970 and then took the position of women&#x27;s athletics coordinator and women&#x27;s basketball coach at Elon College.

In 1975, Yow became NC State&#x27;s first full-time women&#x27;s basketball coach and also coached women&#x27;s volleyball and softball. She led the women&#x27;s basketball team to an ACC championship in the first season of league play in 1978.

On January 11, 2001, she reached the 600-win milestone for her career with a 71–64 win over Temple University. On February 5, 2007, she reached the 700-win milestone for her career with a 68–51 win over Florida State University. At the time of her death, she ranked as the fifth winningest active NCAA Division I women&#x27;s basketball coach. In recognition for her dedication and success, Yow was selected for induction into the Women&#x27;s Basketball Hall of Fame in 2000 and the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on June 5, 2002, the fifth female coach to be selected. On February 16, 2007, the basketball court at Reynolds Coliseum was renamed Kay Yow Court in her honor. On July 11, 2007, Yow received the inaugural Jimmy V ESPY Award for Perseverance, an award named for fellow NC State basketball coach and friend Jim Valvano. She received a standing ovation.

Yow also coached the silver-medal-winning U.S. women&#x27;s basketball team in the 1981 World University Games; the 1986 gold-winning U.S. teams in the Goodwill Games and the FIBA World Championship; and the gold-medal-winning U.S. women&#x27;s basketball team in the 1988 Seoul Olympics.

==USA Basketball==
Yow was the assistant coach of the team representing the US at the World University Games held in Mexico City, Mexico in August 1979. The opening game was against Costa Rica, and the USA almost outscored them by triple digits, falling just shy at 132–34. The next three games were closer, but all margins were in double digits. The fifth game was against the USSR who had won the event in 1973 and 1977. The Soviet team led at halftime, but the USA team outscored the USSR by three points in the second half to win 83–81, the first win by the USA over the USSR in a major competition in two decades. The next game was a rematch against Canada, the team they had beaten by 14 points a few days earlier. This time the Canadian team would take a nine-point lead at halftime, but the USA team came back and won 68–60. The final game of the competition was against Cuba, which the USA won 73–60 to claim their first gold medal in a World University Games event.

Yow was the head coach of the team representing the US at the World University Games held in Bucharest, Romania in July 1981. The team started with a game against Finland and won easily, 68–49. They trailed at halftime in their next game against China, but came back to win a close game 76–74. After beating Poland, they played Czechoslovakia in a game that was close at the half, but the USA team went on to win 86–67. In the following game against Canada, the USA team was again behind at the half, but played a close match in the second half and pulled ahead to win 79–76. Despite being undefeated, they needed a win against Romania to advance to the gold medal game. They had only a one-point lead at halftime, but went on to win 75–64 to meet the undefeated USSR for the gold medal. The USA fell behind by sixteen and could not close the gap—the USSR team won 98–79 to claim the gold medal, leaving the US with the silver. Denise Curry was the leading scorer for the USA team with 18.1 points per game. Anne Donovan led the team in rebounds with 6.7 per game.

Yow served as an assistant coach of the team representing the US in 1984 at the William Jones Cup competition in Taipei, Taiwan. The team chosen to represent the USA was the team expected to be selected as the National Team for the Olympics. This resulted in a very strong team which was able to dominate the competition. In the opening game against Australia, the USA won 82–20. While other games were closer, Italy&#x27;s 23-point loss to the USA was the closest of the eight games. The USA won all eight games, and won the gold medal. The USA team was led by Cheryl Miller, who led the team in scoring at over 15 points per game, rebounding, free throw percentage, assists and steals. Miller was named to the All-Tournament Team, along with Lynette Woodard, and Denise Curry.

Yow was named head coach of the USA National Team which would compete at the 1986 World Championships and the 1990 Olympics. The World Championships were held in Moscow, Soviet Union in August. The USA team started strong with a more than 50-point victory over Taipei. The USA team continued to dominate their opponents, winning the next three preliminary rounds games, with a 15-point victory over Hungary being the closest margin, then advanced to the medal play rounds. They defeated China in the quarterfinals, and Canada in the semifinals, to set up the championship match against the undefeated host Soviet Union. Although the USA had recently defeated the Soviets in the Goodwill Games, Americans wanted to demonstrate that the victory was no &quot;fluke&quot;. The Soviet team was taller, but the USA team was able to outscore them. The USA team started the game with the first eight points, and had a 15–1 run during the second half, and won in convincing fashion 108–88 to win the gold medal and the world championship. Every one of the starters achieved double-digit scoring in the final game, led by Cheryl Miller who had 24 points along with 15 rebounds in the championship game.


==Personal life==
Yow lived in Cary, North Carolina.

Yow and her two sisters are natives of Gibsonville, North Carolina. They were all three active in collegiate sports. Deborah Yow was the athletic director at North Carolina State University, and Susan Yow coached women&#x27;s basketball at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington, Kansas State University, Drake University, East Tennessee State University, Providence College, and Belmont Abbey College. Susan Yow was in her second season as head coach at Belmont Abbey College. Susan served as an assistant coach for two now-defunct WNBA teams, the Charlotte Sting and the Cleveland Rockers. In 2006, Susan was named as an assistant coach with the Minnesota Lynx, but resigned along with head coach Suzie McConnell-Serio on July 23, 2006.

After her 1987 breast cancer diagnosis, Yow became active in raising awareness as well as money to battle the disease. In 2007, the &quot;Kay Yow/WBCA Cancer Fund&quot; was instituted by the Women&#x27;s Basketball Coaches Association and the V Foundation for Cancer Research, of which she served on the board of directors. Her cancer recurred in November 2004 and she began radiation treatments the following month after having surgery.

==Death==
Yow had been on a leave of absence from coaching since early January 2009 because of her disease. She died from stage 4 breast cancer on January 24, 2009, in Cary, North Carolina. In her obituary, the &quot;Charlotte Observer&quot; said, &quot;Yow never lost her folksy, easygoing manner and refused to dwell on her health issues, though they colored everything she did almost as much as basketball. Ultimately, her philosophy on both were the same.&quot;

Yow planned her own funeral before she died and recorded a 25-minute video to be played at the service. More than 1,400 people attended the funeral on January 30 at Colonial Baptist Church in Cary, as Yow thanked her supporters on the video. &quot;And now I say farewell,&quot; she bade the mourners, &quot;and it&#x27;s been a wonderful journey, especially since the time I accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior&quot;.

<text>Fagus grandifolia, the American beech or North American beech, is the only species of beech native to North America. Its current range comprises the eastern United States, isolated pockets of Mexico and southeastern Canada. Prior to the glacial maximum of the Pleistocene epoch, the tree flourished over most of North America, reaching California.

== Description ==
&quot;Fagus grandifolia&quot; is a large deciduous tree growing to tall, with smooth, silver-gray bark. The leaves are dark green, simple and sparsely-toothed with small teeth that terminate each vein, long (rarely ), with a short petiole. The winter twigs are distinctive among North American trees, being long and slender ( by ) with two rows of overlapping scales on the buds. Beech buds are distinctly thin and long, resembling cigars; this characteristic makes beech trees relatively easy to identify. The tree is monoecious, with flowers of both sexes on the same tree. The fruit is a small, sharply-angled nut, borne in pairs in a soft-spined, four-lobed husk. It has two means of reproduction: one is through the usual dispersal of seedlings, and the other is through root sprouts, which grow into new trees.

== Taxonomy ==
Trees in the southern half of the range are sometimes distinguished as a variety, &quot;F. grandifolia&quot; var. &quot;caroliniana&quot;, but this is not considered distinct in the Flora of North America. The Mexican beech (&quot;F. grandifolia&quot; subsp. &quot;mexicana&quot;), native to the mountains of central Mexico, is closely related, and is treated as a subspecies of American beech, but some botanists classify it as a distinct species. The only &quot;Fagus&quot; species found in the Western Hemisphere (assuming the Mexican subspecies is treated as such), &quot;F. grandifolia&quot; is believed to have spanned the width of the North American continent all the way to the Pacific coast before the last ice age.

Two subspecies are generally recognized:
=== Etymology ===
The genus name &quot;Fagus&quot; is Latin for &quot;beech&quot;, and the specific epithet &quot;grandifolia&quot; comes from &quot;grandis&quot; &quot;large&quot; and &quot;folium&quot; &quot;leaf&quot;, in reference to the American beech&#x27;s larger leaves when compared to the European beech.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The American beech is native to eastern North America, from Nova Scotia west to southern Ontario in southeastern Canada, west to Wisconsin and south to eastern Texas and northern Florida in the United States, as well as the states of Hidalgo, Veracruz, Tamaulipas, Puebla, San Luis Potosí, and Tabasco in Mexico. Mature specimens are rare in lowland areas as early settlers quickly discovered that the presence of the tree indicated good farmland.

The American beech is a shade-tolerant species, commonly found in forests in the final stage of succession. Few trees in its natural range other than sugar maple match it for shade tolerance. Ecological succession is essentially the process of forests changing their composition through time; it is a pattern of events often observed on disturbed sites. Although sometimes found in pure stands, it is more often associated with sugar maple (forming the beech–maple climax community), yellow birch, and eastern hemlock, typically on moist, well-drained slopes and rich bottomlands. Near its southern limit, it often shares canopy dominance with southern magnolia. Although it has a reputation for slow growth (sometimes only 13 feet in 20 years), rich soil and ample moisture will greatly speed the process up. American beech favours a well-watered, but also well-drained spot and is intolerant of urban pollution, salt, and soil compaction. It also casts heavy shade and is an extremely thirsty tree with high moisture requirements compared to oaks, so it has a dense, shallow root system.

== Ecology ==
The mast (crop of nuts) from American beech provides food for numerous species of animals. Among vertebrates alone, these include various birds including ruffed grouse and wild turkeys, raccoons, foxes, white-tailed deer, rabbits, squirrels, opossums, pheasants, black bears, and porcupines. Beech nuts were one of the primary foods of the now-extinct passenger pigeon; the clearing of beech and oak forests is pointed to as one of the major factors that may have contributed to the bird&#x27;s extinction. Some Lepidoptera caterpillars feed on beeches. Deer occasionally browse on beech foliage, but it is not a preferred food.

=== Diseases and pests ===
Beech bark disease has become a major killer of beech trees in the Northeastern United States. This disease occurs when the European beech scale insect, &quot;Cryptococcus fagisuga&quot;, attacks the bark, creating a wound that is then infected by &quot;Neonectria ditissima&quot; or &quot;Neonectria faginata&quot;, two species of fungi. This causes a canker to develop and the tree is eventually killed.

Beech leaf disease is caused by the nematode &quot;Litylenchus crenatae mccannii&quot;. It was discovered in Ohio in 2012 and identified as far south as Virginia in 2022. Beech leaf disease causes severe damage to the American beech and also to the related European beech&quot;.&quot;

The beech leaf-miner weevil, a species native to Europe, has been identified in North America as a cause of defoliation of American beech trees. American beech trees have small gaps and crevices at the base of their trunks in which the pest overwinter before eventually making their way to the buds of the trees and finally laying eggs on the underside of the leaves. Once hatched, the larvae mine the leaves, causing destruction to the foliage. 

Beech blight aphids colonize branches of the tree, but without serious harm to otherwise healthy trees. Below these colonies, deposits of sooty mold develop caused by the fungus &quot;Scorias spongiosa&quot; growing saprophytically on the honeydew the insects exude. This is also harmless to the trees.

Despite their high moisture needs, beeches succumb to flooding easily and their thin bark invites damage from animals, fire, and human activities. Late spring frosts can cause complete defoliation of the tree, although they typically recover by using reserve pools of sugar. The trunks of mature beeches often rot and develop cavities that are used by wildlife for habitation.

== Uses ==
American beech is an important tree in forestry. The wood is hard and difficult to cut or split, although at it is not exceptionally heavy, and it also rots relatively easily. It is used for a wide variety of purposes, most notably bentwood furniture as beech wood easily bends when steamed. It also makes high quality, long-burning firewood.

Like European beech bark, the American beech bark is smooth and uniform, making it an attraction for people to carve names, dates, decorative symbols such as love hearts or gang identifiers, and other material into its surface. One such beech tree in Louisville, Kentucky, in what is now the southern part of Iroquois Park, bore the legend &quot;D. Boone kill a Bar 1803.&quot; The beech finally fell over in 1916 during a storm; its age was estimated at around 325 years. Its trunk is now on display at the Filson Historical Society.

It is sometimes planted as an ornamental tree, but even within its native area, it is planted much less often than the European beech. Although American beech can handle hotter climates, its European cousin is faster-growing and more pollution-tolerant, in addition to being easier to propagate.

American beech does not produce significant quantities of nuts until the tree is about 40 years old. Large crops are produced by 60 years. The oldest documented tree is 246 years old. The fruit is a triangle-shaped shell containing 2–3 nuts inside, but many of them do not fill in, especially on solitary trees. Beech nuts are sweet and nutritious, can be eaten raw by wildlife and humans, or can be cooked. They can also be roasted and ground into a coffee substitute.

The leaves are edible when cooked. The inner bark can be dried and pulverized into bread flour as an emergency food.

== In culture ==
Numerous place names in North America are named Beechwood.

In John Steinbeck&#x27;s novel &quot;East of Eden&quot;, a character returns from the Civil War with a wooden leg he carved from beechwood.

<text>The Cordillera de Oncol (sometimes called Valdivian Coast Range) is a mountain range, located along the Pacific coast in southern Chile. It is part of the Chilean Coast Range System (&quot;Cordillera de la Costa&quot;). It was named for the city of Valdivia. The highest point of the range is Cerro Oncol, at 715 m.

==Natural history==
The Valdivian Coastal Range has about 1 million acres (4,000 km2) of Valdivian temperate rain forests habitat, approximately one-quarter of which are protected.

The region has long been geographically isolated, making it a haven for endemic species. Some of the rare species that inhabit the Valdivian Coastal Range include the pudu (the smallest deer in the world), the common degu, the marine otter, and the monito del monte, or mountain monkey (actually a marsupial).

<text>The  was a Japanese law enacted on April 22, 1925, with the aim of allowing the Special Higher Police to more effectively suppress alleged socialists and communists. In addition to criminalizing forming an association with the aim of altering the &quot;kokutai&quot; (&quot;national essence&quot;) of Japan, the law also explicitly criminalized criticism of the system of private property and became the centerpiece of a broad apparatus of thought control in Imperial Japan. Altogether, more than 70,000 people were arrested under the provisions of the law until its repeal by Allied occupation authorities at the end of World War II.

==Passage==

Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, socialist and communist ideas began spreading in Japan, and the government became increasingly concerned that socialism and communism represented a threat to the emperor system and Japan&#x27;s divine &quot;kokutai&quot; (国体, &quot;national essence&quot;). The 1918 Rice Riots and the assassination of Prime Minister Hara Kei only deepened concerns that dangerous ideas were spreading through society. Efforts to pass a Peace Preservation Law began within the Diet as early as 1921, and gathered momentum after the formation of the Japan Communist Party in 1922, although opposition to the law remained strong. Finally, the law was passed in 1925, in conjunction with the passage of the Universal Manhood Suffrage Law (普通選挙法, &quot;Futsū Senkyo Hō&quot;), which allowed all male citizens to vote in elections, regardless of wealth or status. Fears that newly enfranchised working-class voters might vote for socialists or communists played an important role in overcoming earlier opposition to the law.

==Provisions==

The law provided:

 Anyone who has formed an association with the aim of altering the &quot;kokutai&quot; or the system of private property, and anyone who has joined such an association with full knowledge of its object, shall be liable to imprisonment with or without hard labor, for a term not exceeding ten years. 

By using the highly vague and subjective term &quot;kokutai&quot;, the law attempted to blend politics and ethics, but the result was that any political opposition could be branded as &quot;altering the &quot;kokutai&quot;&quot;. Thus the government had &quot;&quot; to outlaw any form of dissent.

==Consequences==

In 1927, a sub-bureau, the &quot;Thought Section,&quot; was established within the Criminal Affairs Bureau of the Special Higher Police within the Home Ministry in order to make use of the new legal authority granted by the Peace Preservation Law to ferret out and suppress subversive ideologies. The new &quot;Thought Police&quot; established local branches throughout Japan as well as in Japan&#x27;s overseas territories to monitor dangerous thoughts and ideologies among Japan&#x27;s imperial subjects. A &quot;Student Section&quot; was also established within the Ministry of Education to monitor subversive thought among university professors and students. Within the Ministry of Justice, special were appointed to suppress .

Renewed underground activity by the banned Japan Communist Party in 1928 led to the March 15 incident, in which police arrested more than 1,600 Communists and suspected Communists under the provisions of the Peace Preservation Law. The same year, the highly anti-Communist government of Tanaka Giichi pushed through an amendment to the law, raising the maximum penalty from ten years to death.

By 1933, coerced &quot;ideological conversions&quot; (転向, &quot;tenkō&quot;) had become the main means of enforcing the Peace Preservation Law, rather than judicial punishment. In order to elicit &quot;tenkō&quot; from prisoners suspected of ideological radicalism, the police employed physical torture, as well as psychological torture and familial pressure.

In the 1930s, with Japan&#x27;s increasing militarism and totalitarianism, dissent was tolerated less and less. In early February 1941, the original Peace Preservation Law of 1925 was heavily amended to make punishments even more severe. Terms for people suspected of socialist and communist sympathies were made harsher, and for the first time religious organizations were included within the purview of the Thought Police. In addition, the appeals court for thought crimes was abolished, and the Ministry of Justice given the right to appoint defense attorneys in cases of thought crime. The new provisions became effective on May 15, 1941.
From 1925 through 1945, over 70,000 people were arrested under the provisions of the Peace Preservation Law, but only about 10% reached trial, and the death penalty was imposed on only two offenders, spy Richard Sorge and his informant, Hotsumi Ozaki. The Peace Preservation Law was repealed following the end of World War II by the American occupation authorities. The repeal was effected on October 15, 1945.

<text>The following is a list of major characters in &quot;[[The Jetsons]]&quot;, an American animated comic science fiction sitcom produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions and first broadcast in prime-time on ABC as part of the 1962–63 United States network television schedule. Additional episodes were produced from 1985 to 1987 in syndication, with the same cast of characters.

==The Jetsons family==
===George Jetson===

George J. Jetson (voiced by George O&#x27;Hanlon in the TV series, Herb Duncan in &quot;The Jetsons: New Songs of the TV Family of the Future&quot;, Jeff Bergman since 1990, Wally Wingert in &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot; and an LG Electronics commercial) is a fictional character and the 40-year-old head of the Jetson family. He is the husband of Jane Jetson and the father of teenage daughter Judy and elementary school aged son Elroy.

George resides with his family in the Skypad Apartments in Orbit City, in a future with the trappings of science fantasy depictions of American life in the future, such as robot servants, flying saucer-like cars, and moving sidewalks. All the apartment buildings are set on giant poles, resembling Seattle&#x27;s Space Needle; the ground is almost never seen, though in &quot;&quot;, it is suggested that the earth is extremely polluted, thus everyone lives in the sky.

When George was a kid, he had to fly through ten miles of asteroid storms to go to Orbit High School, where he was the star pitcher of its Spaceball team. At Orbit High School, he was labeled as an outsider and a geek. George is now an employee at Spacely Space Sprockets, a manufacturer of &quot;sprockets&quot; and other high tech equipment. His job title is &quot;digital index operator.&quot; His boss is Cosmo G. Spacely, noted for being short in both height and temper. Spacely usually treats his employees (particularly George) in a rather tyrannical fashion. George&#x27;s job primarily requires him to repeatedly push a single button (or on occasion a series of buttons) on a computer (named &quot;RUDI&quot; {Short for: Referential Universal Digital Indexer} in the 1980s series of &quot;Jetsons&quot; episodes). George complains of his heavy work load: pushing a button as many as five times for three hours, three days a week. Often, Mr. Spacely will fire George in a fit of anger, only to hire him back by the end of the same episode.

Physically, George is a rather slim man of average height with short red hair and a cartoonishly large nose. His personality is that of a well-meaning, caring father, but he is often befuddled and stressed out by the problems of both his work and family lives. As &quot;The Jetsons&quot; was partially based on the comic strip &quot;Blondie&quot;, George himself was probably based on that strip&#x27;s lead character, Dagwood Bumstead. His wife Jane is voiced by Penny Singleton who played the movie version of Blondie in the 1930s to 1950s.

George&#x27;s most famous catchphrase is &quot;Jane! Stop this crazy thing!&quot; seen at the end credits of the 1960s &quot;Jetsons&quot; episodes, but is also known for frequently uttering the phrase &quot;Hooba-dooba-dooba!&quot; to express wonder or astonishment (probably inspired by Fred Flintstone&#x27;s similar-sounding &quot;Yabba Dabba Doo!!&quot;).

O&#x27;Hanlon was known for his portrayal of everyman characters in film and television. O&#x27;Hanlon once said of his character: &quot;George Jetson is an average man. He has trouble with his boss, he has problems with his kids, and so on. The only difference is that he lives in the next century.&quot; O&#x27;Hanlon last did the voice for George Jetson in &quot;&quot;, which was released posthumously.

In the &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot; episode &quot;Back to the Present&quot;, George leads the Jetsons in returning to Earth to sue the planet for causing global warming.

George Jetson also appeared in a cameo appearance on &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot; episode &quot;Mime for a Change&quot;.

In &quot;The Jetsons &amp; WWE: Robo-WrestleMania!&quot;, George Jetson is assigned by Mr. Spacely to supervise a project that involves robots drilling through the surface of the Earth.

George Jetson also appears at the Cedar Fair Entertainment Company and formerly Universal Studios Florida as a meetable character seen in 1996 video called &quot;Kids for Character&quot;.

He also appears on Kanye West&#x27;s music video &quot;Heartless&quot;. He is also seen along with his family, Rosie, and Mr. Spacely in a MetLife commercial that aired in 2012.

The inspiration for George&#x27;s name sake (aside from its voice actor) is believed to be a tribute to the prolific Danish designer, Georg Jensen, who defined modern design in the early and mid twentieth century.

===Jane Jetson===
Jane Jetson (voiced by Penny Singleton in the TV series, Rose Mary Jun in &quot;The Jetsons: New Songs of the TV Family of the Future&quot;, B. J. Baker (singing voice), Jo Hayden in &quot;Flintstones/Jetsons: Timewarp&quot;, Lauri Fraser in &quot;The Jetsons: The Best Son&quot;, Diane Michelle in &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot;, Grey DeLisle in &quot;The Jetsons &amp; WWE: Robo-WrestleMania!&quot;, Andi Gibson in an LG Electronics commercial, Annie Mumolo in &quot;Jellystone!&quot;) is George&#x27;s 33-year-old wife, mother of their two children, and a homemaker. Jane is obsessed with fashion and new gadgetry. Her favorite store is Mooning Dales. She is also a dutiful wife who always tries to make life as pleasant as possible for her family. Although she is usually pleasant natured, she is quite protective of her family, and she can be angered whenever they are threatened. She is also unafraid to stand up to Mr. Spacely, especially when he antagonizes her family and her husband.

Outside of the home, she is a member of the Galaxy Women Historical Society and is a fan of Leonardo de Venus and Picasso Pia. Although this wife of the future has both a robot maid and automated apartment appliances, even pushing buttons for housework gets to be too much for her and she has to take a vacation (&quot;Dude Planet&quot;). A running gag is that she has terrible driving skills, turning her driving instructor, and her husband into nervous wrecks (&quot;&quot;The Space Car&quot; and &quot;Jane&#x27;s Driving Lesson&quot;&quot;).

Jane has since appeared in popular culture. Jane appears, with Wilma Flintstone and Velma Dinkley, in a commercial for Dove shampoo. She appears on Kanye West&#x27;s music video &quot;Heartless&quot;. In one episode of &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, a female space alien resembling Jane appears twice; once as a receptionist, and then again when a male alien trapped on a treadmill calls out the famous catchphrase &quot;Jane! Stop this crazy thing!&quot; where she comes to his aid. Jane Jetson appears in the &quot;Jellystone!&quot; season 3 episode &quot;Meet the Jetsons&quot;.

She was included in Yahoo!&#x27;s Top 10 TV Moms from Six Decades of Television.

===Judy Jetson===
Judy Jetson (voiced by Janet Waldo in the TV series, Rose Mary Jun in &quot;The Jetsons: New Songs of the TV Family of the Future&quot;, B.J. Ward in &quot;Rockin&#x27; with Judy Jetson&quot; (singing voice), Tiffany Darwish in the film, Danica McKellar in &quot;The Jetsons &amp; WWE: Robo-WrestleMania!&quot;, 2017–present) is the daughter of George and Jane Jetson who acts just like a typical teenage girl only with more futuristic tastes. In the first episode of the original series, it is revealed that Judy is 16 years old, by her mother Jane Jetson.

Despite Judy still keeping modern-day &quot;teenage girl&quot; likes and dislikes, such as seemingly never-ending conversations on the telephone and shopping for futuristic outfits, she does not live exactly like a modern teenager. For example, she enjoys taking advantage of the many technology gadgets at her grasp such as controllable zero-gravity switches (made for accomplishing popular dance moves of the show&#x27;s time or for other uses). She also gives a summary of how her day went and the problems which she faced to a floating robotic diary, appropriately named, &quot;DiDi&quot; (voiced by Selma Diamond later by Brenda Vaccaro).

Judy is also very fond of a rock singer named Jet Screamer, whom George despises at first until Judy wins a date with him as the grand prize in a songwriting contest. George had secretly switched Judy&#x27;s song with her younger brother Elroy&#x27;s secret code, hoping to sabotage her entry, but she won, nonetheless. When George accompanies Judy on the date in an attempt to call it off, he instead winds up playing drums during a live performance of the song and soon develops a liking for Jet and his music.

Judy is depicted wearing a deep pinkish-purple, futuristic slight crop top outfit and, like a few other Hanna-Barbera cartoon characters (such as Bamm-Bamm Rubble from &quot;The Flintstones&quot; and some background characters in various cartoons) has white hair that is colored to resemble platinum blonde or bleached blonde hair, which she wears in a ponytail on top of her head. She attends Orbit High School, which her father had also attended.

Judy went unvoiced in her appearance in &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot;, due to the fact a voice actress could not be secured for her (Waldo by this point was in her 80s and retired from voice acting).

Judy Jetson appears in the &quot;Jellystone!&quot; season 3 episode &quot;Meet the Jetsons&quot;.

===Elroy Jetson===
Elroy Jetson (voiced by Daws Butler in the TV series, Herb Duncan in &quot;The Jetsons: New Songs of the TV Family of the Future&quot;, Billy West in a WBCN commercial, Patric Zimmerman in the film and Cartoon Network bumpers, Jeff Bergman in two RadioShack commercials, &quot;The Jetsons: Father &amp; Son Day&quot; and &quot;The Jetsons: The Best Son&quot;, Tom Kenny in &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot;, and a Cartoon Network bumper, and Trevor Devall in &quot;The Jetsons &amp; WWE: Robo-WrestleMania!&quot;, 2017–present) is a -year-old (self-reported in the first episode) boy who is the younger of the two children in the Jetson family. He is highly intelligent and an expert in all space sciences. Elroy attends Little Dipper School, where he studies space history, astrophysics and star geometry. He is a mild-mannered and good child.

Elroy Jetson appears in the &quot;Jellystone!&quot; season 3 episode &quot;Meet the Jetsons&quot;. Elroy is mute in this version.

==Jetson family household==
===Astro===
Astro (voiced by Dawn Messick in the TV series, Daws Butler in &quot;The Jetsons in First Family On The Moon&quot;, Scott Innes in several RadioShack commercials, Wally Wingert in &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot; and an LG Electronics commercial, Jeff Bergman in a Tums commercial, Frank Welker in &quot;The Jetsons &amp; WWE: Robo-WrestleMania&quot;, 2017, Ron Funches in &quot;Jellystone!&quot;) is the Jetson family&#x27;s Great Dane. He was designed by Iwao Takamoto, and originally voiced by Don Messick. Despite the stress he tends to cause him, George often regards Astro as his genuine best friend. Astro, despite being clumsy and dim-witted, was very loyal (to a fault) to the Jetsons, particularly George and Elroy. A GMO he was more advanced than present-day dogs, in that he had a rudimentary grasp of the English language. In a recurring gag, while George is walking Astro on a gravity-suspended treadmill, Astro begins chasing a cat that stumbles onto it, eventually forcing it to go at speeds too fast for George to keep up with, trapping him. This led to George&#x27;s trademark phrase &quot;Jane! Stop this crazy thing!&quot;.

Don Messick would usually give Astro a speech pattern involving replacing the first letter of any word with an R, such as &quot;I love you, George&quot; becoming &quot;I ruv roo, Reorge&quot;. Astro is similar to Scooby-Doo in the cartoon &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!&quot;; which was also voiced by Messick (of the two voices, Astro&#x27;s was slightly higher and raspier than Scooby&#x27;s).
Astro was introduced in the season one episode, &quot;The Coming of Astro&quot;. When Jane, Judy, and Elroy proposed keeping him to George, he was against it, claiming an apartment is no place for a dog. In an effort to make his family happy, he gets an electronic dog, &#x27;Lectronimo. Through mishaps, &#x27;Lectronimo fails to catch a burglar whom Astro inadvertently stops. The family gives &#x27;Lectronimo to the police and keeps Astro. In Season 1, Episode 16, a millionaire named J.P. Gottrockets shows up and claims to be Astro&#x27;s original owner and his original name was Tralfaz. Astro had no memory of his past life with the millionaire, but understood why he ran away, with Elroy rescuing him from the dog catcher - he didn&#x27;t want wealth and privilege, he wanted a real family. After seeing how much he loved the Jetsons, Gottrockets gives Astro back to them. Despite this, Astro makes an appearance in the ending credits prior to the episode. 

Astro was also in 11 episodes of a 1981 spin-off called &quot;Astro and the Space Mutts&quot;. 

Astro makes five cameo appearances as a portrait in the music video for the 2008 Kanye West song &quot;Heartless&quot;, which takes place in West&#x27;s actual apartment den. 

Most recently, Astro appears in the &quot;Jellystone!&quot; season 3 episode &quot;Meet the Jetsons&quot;.

===Rosie===
Rosie (voiced by Jean Vander Pyl in the TV series, Ann Thomas in &quot;The Jetsons: New Songs of the TV Family of the Future&quot;, Jeff Bergman in &quot;Flintstones/Jetsons: Timewarp&quot;, Grey DeLisle in an AT&amp;T commercial, Tress MacNeille in &quot;The Jetsons &amp; WWE: Robo-WrestleMania!&quot;, 2008–2017, Annie Mumolo in &quot;Jellystone!&quot;) is the Jetson family&#x27;s robotic maid and housekeeper. Rosie is depicted as wearing a frilly apron and was often seen using a separate vacuum cleaner. Her torso is mounted atop a single leg, and she rolls about on a set of caster wheels. She frequently calls George Jetson &quot;Mr. J&quot; in a Brooklyn accent (a nod to the character of Hazel the maid on the TV sitcom &quot;Hazel&quot; calling her boss &quot;Mr. B.&quot;). In seasons 1 and 3 her name is spelled as Rosey on the episode title cards.

Rosie was an old demonstrator model hired by the Jetson family from U-Rent a Maid. The series&#x27; first episode, &quot;Rosey the Robot&quot;, gives her model number as XB-500. She was in fact outdated when introduced, and her obsolescence was the focus of several episodes focused on her. In one episode, Rosie became depressed because she had never seen her &quot;mother&quot; [a prototype]. George cheered her up when he found a set of prototype plans of the (First) Rosie robot. In the episode &quot;Rosie&#x27;s Boyfriend&quot;, we learn she has a boyfriend, the robot Mac, a helper for Henry Orbit. Rosie clearly cares a great deal for Mac, but is obviously the more intelligent between them, often chiding him for his childish behavior.

She was spoofed in the &quot;Futurama&quot; movie &quot;Bender&#x27;s Game&quot;, with a robot that looked like her saying &quot;Everything must be clean. Very clean. That&#x27;s why the dog had to die. He was a dirty dog. Also, that boy Elroy. Dirty. Dirty.&quot; She was voiced by Tress MacNeille in this parody.

In 2017, a &quot;Jetsons&quot; comic was published by DC Comics. In it, Rosie is re-imagined as George&#x27;s mother who was placed in a robotic body by Nexlyfe. She only informed Judy that she was going through with the procedure prior to it.

Rosie appears in the Jellystone! season 3 episode &quot;Meet the Jetsons&quot;.

===Orbitty===
Orbitty (voiced by Frank Welker in the TV series, Diane Michelle in &quot;Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law&quot;) is the 2nd pet of the Jetson family. Orbitty is an alien with springlike legs and suction-cup feet. He has the ability to express his emotions by changing color. He is also excellent in fixing and repairing things. This character was introduced in the 1980s version of the series, but didn&#x27;t appear in the third season (aside from one cameo) or any of the movies that came after it.

==Other characters==
===Mr. Spacely===

Cosmo G. Spacely (voiced by Mel Blanc in the TV series, Daws Butler in &quot;The Jetsons in First Family On The Moon&quot;, Billy West in a WBCN commercial, Frank Welker as a teenager in &quot;The Jetsons Christmas Carol&quot;, Jeff Bergman since 1990, and Greg Burson in &quot;Bloopers of the Cartoon Stars&quot; (1997)) is George&#x27;s moneygrubbing and arrogant boss.

Spacely is president and owner of Spacely Space Sprockets, where George Jetson works. He frequently yells at George for perceived poor work performance, or just when he feels like it. A typical videophone call from Spacely starts with him yelling &quot;JETSON!!!&quot; He attempts to fire George for the slightest offense, though Spacely gives George his job back at the end of the episode or the beginning of the next episode. Though money is often the sole objective of his life, Spacely is not completely heartless, and will at times empathize or go out of his way to genuinely help George (albeit rarely). Spacely also often finds excuses to get involved in George&#x27;s personal life, with the same vindictive peril for George Jetson&#x27;s job in the event of mishap.

He appears as an antihero in the TV series.

===Mrs. Spacely===
Mrs. Petunia Spacely (voiced by Jean Vander Pyl) is Mr. Spacely&#x27;s wife whom he loves, but lives in constant fear of. In the pilot episode, Mr. Spacely calls her by the name Stella.

===Arthur Spacely===
Arthur Spacely (voiced by Dick Beals) is Mr. Spacely&#x27;s son who is extremely snobbish and is a rival to Elroy.

===Orwell Spacely===
Orwell Spacely (voiced by Howard Morris) is Mr. Spacely&#x27;s nephew. He is an inventor and works at his uncle&#x27;s factory, where he is constantly inventing things to help his uncle Cosmo out. Orwell once invented a spot remover spray that turned George Invisible. He also clones George Jetson on one occasion.

===R.U.D.I.===
R.U.D.I. (voiced by Don Messick) is George&#x27;s work computer as well as his best friend in the workplace. R.U.D.I. is sentient, free thinking and openly fond of George, recognizing his value as an employee and friend. His name is an acronym for Referential Universal Digital Indexer. He has a human personality and is a member of the Society Preventing Cruelty to Humans. Though capable and loyal, R.U.D.I. is implied to be antiquated technology, as George mentions his model is no longer made.

In the episode &quot;Family Fallout&quot;, the Jetsons are up against the Spacelys on a game show. The last question to come up was &quot;what does R.U.D.I. stand for?&quot; George&#x27;s response was Referential Universal Differential Indexer – this was accepted by the game show host as the correct answer, even though earlier episodes had it as Digital instead of Differential.

===Mr. Cogswell===
Mr. Cogswell (voiced by Daws Butler in the TV series) is Spacely&#x27;s big competitor. He owns Cogswell&#x27;s Cosmic Cogs company and causes a lot of trouble for Spacely and George. To a lesser extent, Cogswell is another of the series&#x27; antagonists. He and Spacely are always finding ways to bring each other&#x27;s businesses down. Cogswell has often tried to steal Spacely&#x27;s ideas and make them his own to gain an advantage (only for it to backfire on both bosses). Just like Spacely, he is also cheap and greedy and not above firing his employees when any little thing goes wrong. Mr. Cogswell&#x27;s first name of &quot;Spencer&quot; is revealed in the second season of &quot;The Jetsons&quot;.

He bears something of a resemblance to Fred Flintstone&#x27;s boss Mr. Slate.

===Harlan===
Harlan (voiced by Howard Morris) is Mr. Cogswell&#x27;s sycophant right-hand man. His name may be a nod to science-fiction writer Harlan Ellison.

===Sentro===
Sentro is a robotic dog used by Mr. Cogswell.

In his first appearance in &quot;Solar Snoops&quot;, Sentro was operated by the Galactic Sneak where he and Cogswell controlled Sentro into stealing the prototype Microchip Cookie that Mr. Spacely was working on where Sentro posed as a security guard dog that was delivered to Mr. Spacely.

In &quot;The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones&quot;, Sentro is used again by Mr. Cogswell to steal the information about the prehistoric car that Mr. Spacely plans to market. Sentro is thwarted by both the Flintstones and the Jetsons.

Sentro later appeared as a boss in the video game &quot;The Jetsons: Cogswell&#x27;s Caper&quot;.

===Henry Orbit===
Henry Orbit (voiced by Daws Butler) is the apartment building superintendent of the Skypad Apartments. He has an assistant robot M.A.C.C. who is also dating Rosie the Jetson&#x27;s housekeeper robot. Henry is known for giving George advice and is a part-time inventor, although both more often than not tend to backfire on him.

===M.A.C.C.===
M.A.C.C. (voiced by Don Messick) is the robotic assistant of Henry Orbit who started dating Rosie after Elroy figured out that they fell in love.

===Uniblab===
Uniblab (voiced by Don Messick) is George&#x27;s mortal enemy, an obnoxious robot who was also his supervisor at work. Appearing in &quot;Uniblab&quot;, he becomes George&#x27;s supervisor and exposes information that caused Mr. Spacely to fire George. Thanks to the meddling of George and Henry, Uniblab went haywire and Mr. Spacely threw Uniblab out. Henry later hired Uniblab only for George to throw Uniblab out. In &quot;G.I. Jetson&quot;, Uniblab becomes the Sergeant of George&#x27;s platoon. General Missile stated that &quot;Cost the government millions ... enough for two officers&#x27; clubs&quot;. George and Henry swapped out his A/C pack with a D/C pack which caused Uniblab to malfunction.

Uniblab later appeared in the 1980s episode, &quot;Wedding Bells for Rosey&quot;, where he reveals to Rosie that the new &quot;B.E.B.O.P.&quot; law enforcement was a ruse. Uniblab later made a cameo in &quot;The Jetsons Christmas Carol&quot; attending an office Christmas party at Spacely Sprockets before Mr. Spacely put an end to it and ordered everybody to get back to work.

His name is a pun of UNIVAC.

<doc id="494559" wikidata="Q514912" url="?curid=494559" title="Captain Atom">
<text>Captain Atom is the name of several superheroes appearing in American comic books, initially owned by Charlton Comics before being acquired in the 1980s by DC Comics. All possess some form of energy-manipulating abilities, usually relating to nuclear fission and atomic power.

Created during the Silver Age of Comic Books to occupy a Superman-like role in Charlton Comics&#x27; line-up, the character became part of the DC Universe in 1985 after DC&#x27;s purchase of Charlton in 1983. The character&#x27;s similarities to Superman led to DC making numerous attempts to find a distinctive niche for the character within its own stories. As a result, he has played varied roles in the DC Universe, many short-lived, including a period as the supervillain Monarch and the attempted reboot series &quot;Breach&quot;. Notably, DC&#x27;s decision not to give Alan Moore permission to use the character in his critically and commercially successful &quot;Watchmen&quot; (1986) series led to the creation of the popular character Doctor Manhattan. Modern depictions of Captain Atom have instead emphasised, rather than de-emphasise, his similarities to Manhattan. 

Captain Atom has appeared in several animated television and film adaptations of Justice League and other DC storylines since the mid-2000s. Chris Cox, Michael T. Weiss, and Brian Bloom, among others, have voiced the character in animation. 

==Publication history==
Captain Atom was created by writer Joe Gill and artist/co-writer Steve Ditko, and first appeared in &quot;Space Adventures&quot; #33 (March 1960). Captain Atom was initially created for Charlton Comics, but was later acquired by DC Comics and revised for DC&#x27;s post-&quot;Crisis&quot; continuity. In 2011, DC Comics relaunched its superhero comics and rewrote the histories of some characters from scratch, including Captain Atom, giving him a new origin, appearance and slightly altered powers. Captain Atom was the character inspiration for Doctor Manhattan, who was featured in the miniseries (and later live-action film adaptation) &quot;Watchmen&quot;, which would be connected to the DC Universe in the miniseries &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;.

Throughout the years, the character has been featured in several moderate-to-short-lived eponymous series, and has been a member of several different versions of DC&#x27;s flagship superhero team, the Justice League. In all incarnations, the character initially served for the military. In the Charlton Comics continuity, he was a scientist named Allen Adam and gained his abilities by accident when he was seemingly &quot;atomized&quot; and then reformed himself as an atomic-powered being. In both DC Comics incarnations, he is an Air Force pilot named Nathaniel Adam, who was a test subject in a scientific experiment who seemingly disintegrated in the process, only to reappear later as the super-powered Captain Atom. Over the years, DC has attempted to reinvent the character several times. For a period, the character assumed the mantle of the supervillain Monarch, and in 2005 DC attempted to retell the Captain Atom story with an entirely new character, Breach, who was subsequently discarded. In the new continuity following DC&#x27;s 2011 relaunch, Captain Atom has never been a member of the Justice League and the team views him with distrust; his character origin and abilities were also revised.

==Fictional character biography==
===Charlton Comics (Silver Age)===
The Charlton Comics version of Captain Atom was Allen Adam, a rocket technician who gains powers after his special experimental rocket explodes.

Captain Atom was first published in a series of short stories in the anthology series &quot;Space Adventures&quot; #33–40 (March 1960 – June 1961) and #42 (October 1961). Charlton began reprinting his short adventures in the anthology &quot;Strange Suspense Stories&quot; beginning with issue #75 (June 1965), renaming the title &quot;Captain Atom&quot; with issue #78 (December 1965) and giving the hero full-length stories and supervillain antagonists such as Dr. Spectro (previous stories involved Cold War anti-Communist missions or dealing with aliens). Captain Atom later teamed with the superhero Nightshade, with whom he shared a mutual attraction. The superhero Blue Beetle starred in the initial back-up feature, later replaced by a Nightshade back-up series.

DC Comics acquired Captain Atom, among other characters, following the bankruptcy of Charlton Comics. In &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, the Charlton characters are revealed to originate from Earth-Four and are integrated into DC&#x27;s continuity.

===DC Comics (Post-&quot;Crisis&quot;)===
A new Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; version of the character was introduced in March 1987 with the launch of a monthly comic, written by Cary Bates and Greg Weisman and drawn by Pat Broderick.

This modern captain&#x27;s name is established as Nathaniel Christopher Adam, a United States Air Force officer and Vietnam War veteran. Adam is framed for a crime and experimented on to avoid execution and receive a pardon. He gains metallic skin and vast nuclear powers, but is transported decades into the future and presumed dead.

After Adam resurfaces, General Wade Eiling blackmails him into serving the government as the superhero Captain Atom. Atom separates from the government, joins the Justice League, and briefly marries Plastique.

Captain Atom was intended to be the villain Monarch in the &quot;Armageddon 2001&quot; event. However, after this information was leaked, DC changed Monarch&#x27;s identity to Hank Hall last-minute.

In the &quot;Superman/Batman&quot; story arc &quot;Public Enemies&quot;, Captain Atom is seemingly killed while stopping a kryptonite meteor. He is transported to the WildStorm universe and presumed dead.

==== Monarch ====
In Infinite Crisis, Captain Atom returns when Superboy-Prime punctures Breach, who wields similar energy-manipulating abilities. The end of &quot;Armageddon&quot; has him reappear in the devastated Blüdhaven. A year later, Captain Atom is revealed to be contained inside Blüdhaven and used to administer radiation treatments to metahumans. He later escapes and kills Major Force.

=====Countdown=====
In &quot;Countdown to Final Crisis&quot;, Captain Atom assumes the Monarch name and battles heroes throughout the multiverse.

During a fight against Superman-Prime, Atom&#x27;s suit is damaged, releasing a chain reaction that destroys Earth-51. It is later revealed that the Monitor Solomon attacked Atom in Blüdhaven, rupturing his skin and facilitating his transformation into Monarch.

====Project 7734====
During Jimmy Olsen&#x27;s investigation about Project 7734, the secret black-op commanded by Sam Lane to fight extraterrestrial menaces on Earth (including Kryptonians), it is discovered that an amnesiac and brainwashed Captain Atom is in his possession.

====Generation Lost====
In &quot;Justice League: Generation Lost&quot;, Captain Atom is among the heroes tasked with hunting down Maxwell Lord.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===
In &quot;The New 52&quot; continuity reboot, Captain Atom is reintroduced with altered powers, appearance and origin. This version was never framed and participated in the experiment that gave him powers voluntarily. During a fight with Dr. Megala, who has taken control of Firestorm&#x27;s body, Atom absorbs a massive amount of energy, which disperses his molecules across the timestream. One of these pieces becomes a separate entity named Nathaniel Adym and joins the Science Police in the 31st century.

===&quot;DC Rebirth: The Fall and Rise of Captain Atom&quot;===
Captain Atom (Nathaniel Adam) lost control of his powers and caused a devastating accident in this six-issue series set in 2012. Needing to contain his unstable abilities, he went into Dr. Megala&#x27;s Subterranean Suppression Dome but seemingly exploded. The world believed Nathaniel Adam was killed in a blast; However, Adam took a subatomic trip through time and ended up without powers, 20 years in the past. It is revealed that the quantum blowback sent him back in time to 1994 as a normal man. Adam&#x27;s wound distorted after being shot during an attempted car robbery, and his body was encased in liquid metal. As a result of the time stream correcting itself, he was thrown back to 2017.

===DC All In===
In &quot;Absolute Power&quot;, Captain Atom loses his powers to Amanda Waller&#x27;s Amazo army. Atom (Ray Palmer) and Atom (Ryan Choi) use him to test a device that can retrieve powers and restore them to the correct superhero. This leads to Adam&#x27;s powers returning at full strength, along with those of other &quot;Atom Project&quot; subjects. In the series &quot;Jenny Sparks&quot; (2024), the titular character works with the Justice League in an attempt to stop Captain Atom after he starts to think of himself as a god, using his powers to heal diseases for some while coldly killing others at his whim. The revised depiction is heavily influenced by Doctor Manhattan. 

In &quot;Jenny Sparks&quot; #5, Atom&#x27;s original DC Comics backstory is confirmed as canon. A willing army recruit famed for making &quot;unheard of&quot; numbers of kills, Adam was arrested for &quot;brutal&quot; behaviours in the jungle in 1968 (potentially having been framed). To avoid hanging, he participated in an experiment to test whether a recovered alien ship could withstand a nuclear attack. The molten ship appeared to kill Adam, but he reappeared decades later as Captain Atom – true to form, he promptly enlisted again in the U.S. army and later the Justice League, where &quot;no one gave him much thought&quot; and he was viewed as &quot;generic&quot;. More recently, he checked himself into a mental hospital, before leaving with a god complex.

==Powers and abilities==
===Powers===
Captain Atom&#x27;s body is coated in the alien metal Dilustel, which enables him to generate vast amounts of nuclear energy and makes him virtually immortal. Atom&#x27;s skin is highly durable and can only be damaged by the X-Ionizer, a device designed to cut through it. Cracking or rupturing his skin causes Atom to leak radiation at an uncontrollable rate, to which he runs the risk of atomic detonation.

In addition to his superhuman abilities, Nathaniel Adam is also an experienced United States Air Force pilot. He is especially skilled in combat piloting, is trained in military weaponry, strategy, and hand-to-hand combat, and speaks multiple languages, including Russian. Adam also has strong survival instincts derived from his experiences during the Vietnam War.

At other times and storylines, Captain Atom has had different or greatly increased powers. During his Monarch era, his powers significantly increased, making him a multiversal level threat. The short-lived New 52 version of the character was an &quot;energy-based life form&quot; whose control over physics meant he could transform lava into snow and manipulate time.

==Rogues gallery==
Captain Atom has his own enemies:
* Bolt (Larry Bolatinsky): An assassin and mercenary sporting an electrokinetic suit hired by General Eiling for a number of militia hero sales schemes. Often came in conflict with Captain Atom over the course of his military career while under contract in another of many government staged publicity stunts.
* Doctor Spectro (Tom Emery): A scientist driven mad by his emotion-altering prisms, Dr. Spectro gained the ability to affect emotions directly. Post-&quot;Crisis&quot;, Spectro was a small-time crook General Wade Eiling used to create a cover story for Captain Atom. Very bright costumes were a characteristic of Dr. Spectro. Doctor Spectro first appeared in &quot;Captain Atom&quot; #79 as the first supervillain antagonist of the titular hero, and was created by Steve Ditko and Joe Gill. The character first appeared in Charlton Comics, later in DC Comics. James Sandy counted Doctor Spectro among the many comic characters that were introduced in the Silver Age of Comic Books and disappeared again after a short run, but authors of &quot;The Superhero Book&quot; found him a unique supervillain.
* Fiery-Icer: A mercenary with a suit that unleashes intense fire from his right gauntlet and frigid cold from the left, the mysterious Fiery-Icer fought Captain Atom on several occasions.
* General Wade Eiling: Once his commanding officer in the military who even in his new identity Nathaniel Adam often butted heads with due to his unscrupulous means of promoting America&#x27;s new military assets. Unknown to the Captain for the longest time, it was the corrupt general who had Adam framed for killing a senior officer which, in turn, subjected him to the Atom Project years ago.
* The Ghost (Alec Rois): A physicist who developed a teleportation device that he used to become a millionaire, Alec Rois took on the persona of the Ghost and became Captain Atom and his partner Nightshade&#x27;s Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; nemesis. Post-&quot;Crisis&quot;, he was a cult leader nicknamed &quot;the Faceless One&quot;, a disgruntled weapons developer and a former CIA operative who sought revenge against an unscrupulous employer. Having been trapped in the Quantum Field by his own Stealthray tech, he is released as an energy being who controls teletranslocation through it and has connections to Atom&#x27;s past conviction while enlisted five years ago.
* Iron Arms: A mercenary that employs a backpack that powers powerful cybernetic arms.
* The Cambodian (Rako): An arms dealer and personal enforcer of the Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; Ghost. A survivor of a U.S. bombing raid during the Vietnam War, this Cambodian refugee was taken into Rois&#x27; services while he was a government agent. Acting as the Green Elite&#x27;s hitman, Rako framed Nathaniel Adam for treason under Rois&#x27; orders, resulting in his drafting into Project: Atom. As the Cambodian, he would clad himself in armor and weaponry tempered by the X-Ionizer, wielding a skein sharp enough to pierce Captain Atom&#x27;s Dilustel armor.
* Major Force (Clifford Zmeck): A rapist/murderer exposed to the same experiment that created Captain Atom, he would regularly betray the U.S. government or go back to work for their more clandestine, i.e., crooked, organizations, becoming a regular as Captain Atom&#x27;s Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; nemesis.
* Monarch (Hank Hall): In an alternate future, Hank Hall goes mad and kills Earth&#x27;s heroes to conquer the world. When the hero Waverider comes back in time to prevent this, he instead creates the paradox that made his future possible. When Monarch goes back in time to retrieve his past self, it was Captain Atom that failed to stop him. Captain Atom battled the villain through time to quell the guilt of his failure to stop him earlier.
* Plastique (Bette Sans Souci): A French-Canadian terrorist with explosive-based powers and intense separatist designs, first came in contact with Captain Atom during an assassination attempt at a Canadian/American peace delegation. The two frequently clash with one another, eventually falling in love and entering into a whirlwind marriage, albeit a short-lived one.
* Punch and Jewelee: A husband and wife team of villains who work as thieves and mercenaries. Post-&quot;Crisis&quot;, they instead fought King Faraday and Nightshade.
* Thirteen: In reality a federal agent from Earth&#x27;s future, Thirteen travels back in time with his partner Faustus, a talking cat, to prevent the Ghost from stealing an experimental missile and end up facing Captain Atom. He appears to be a sorcerer but it is unknown if he employs true magic or just sufficiently advanced science.
* Ultramax: Former assassin turned death row inmate in the early 2000s, when Atom had his meltdown and was catapulted into the Q-Field. Max Thrane, as he was facing the electric chair at the time, was bathed in the fallout during his execution. About a decade later, Captain Atom would return and undo his predicament, only for him to awake finding he had gained similar Quantum Powers due to the hero&#x27;s blowback years ago, to which, now going by the name Ultramax, Thrane set out on a path of revenge against the one who slated him for his death sentence.

<text>Torry Jabar Holt (born June 5, 1976) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver for 11 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He was named to the Pro Bowl seven times and retired with the 10th most receiving yards, including a record six consecutive seasons with 1,300 yards. He played college football for the NC State Wolfpack, and earned consensus All-American honors. He was selected by the St. Louis Rams in the first round of the 1999 NFL draft, and spent the next ten years with the Rams and is remembered as one of the members of &quot;The Greatest Show on Turf&quot;.

==Early life==
Holt grew up in Gibsonville, North Carolina. He was Prep Football Report All-America selection, adding all-state honors at Eastern Guilford High School in Gibsonville. While there, he caught 129 passes during his career, gaining 2,573 yards and scoring 42 touchdowns including 56 receptions for 983 yards and 17 touchdowns as senior. He also returned three punts and three kickoffs for touchdowns during his career. Additionally, Holt was a standout defensive back who posted 62 tackles and four interceptions as senior. He was named one of the Top 25 players in the state by the Charlotte Observer. After high school, Holt attended Hargrave Military Academy in 1995. There he caught 21 passes for 524 yards and six touchdowns.

==College career==
Holt attended North Carolina State University, and played wide receiver for the NC State Wolfpack football team from 1995 to 1998. In his senior year, Holt was named Atlantic Coast Conference Offensive Player of the Year. That season, he set ACC records of 88 receptions (since broken by Kenneth Moore of Wake Forest) for 1,604 yards and an NC State record of 16 touchdown receptions. Holt was a consensus first-team All-American as senior. He was also a finalist for the Fred Biletnikoff Award, given to the nation&#x27;s top receiver. As a junior, he led the team, setting Wolfpack season records with 62 receptions for 1,099 yards, topping marks of 55 by Naz Worthen (1988) while becoming the first player in team history to gain more than 1,000 yards in a season. He started in five of the first seven games as sophomore. He majored in sociology. Holt&#x27;s number, 81, was retired in 1999.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==

===Pre-draft===
After injuring his knee at the Senior Bowl, Holt, at 192 pounds, ran a 4.44 second 40-yard dash and had a vertical jump of 37 inches at the 1999 NFL Combine

===St. Louis Rams===
Holt was the sixth overall draft pick in the 1999 NFL draft and the first selection made by the St. Louis Rams. On July 23, 1999, Holt signed a five-year, $10 million contract, including a $5.4 million signing bonus, with the Rams. In his rookie season, he posted 52 receptions, 788 total yards and six touchdowns on the way to the Super Bowl XXXIV championship. From 1999 to 2001, the Rams scored over 500 points each season, and their offense was dubbed &quot;The Greatest Show on Turf&quot;.

For the six seasons from 2000 to 2005, Holt reached at least 1,300 yards every season, a league record of six consecutive seasons. Holt&#x27;s streak was broken in 2006, due to injuries to himself and other teammates that hindered the offense for parts of the season. Holt came into the NFL as #88, but in 2002 changed his number to 81 (worn by Az-Zahir Hakim previously).

Holt&#x27;s career also includes 7 Pro Bowls (2000, 2001, 2003–2007) including five straight, 74 career touchdowns for 448 points (including 2 two-point conversions) and 920 career receptions. He ranks among the top 10 active leaders in receiving yards, receiving touchdowns, and receptions, and has finished in the top ten of those three categories in five straight seasons (2003–2007). Holt has also led the league in receiving yardage on two occasions (2000, 2003), and receptions once (2003). Holt is tenth all time in receiving yards, and eleventh all time in pass receptions.

Prior to the 2003 seasons Holt agreed to a 7-year $42 million contract extension that included a $12.5 million signing bonus. Holt led the NFL in receptions in 2003 and led the NFL in receiving yardage in 2000 and 2003. He was a First-team All-Pro in 2003 and a Second-team selection in 2006. On October 15, 2006, Holt became the fastest player in NFL history to reach 10,000 receiving yards doing so in the sixth game of his eighth season and also to 11,000 yards.

His request for a release was granted by the Rams on March 13, 2009. If he was not released, he would have been due $5.65 and $6.65 million in the last two years of his contract.

Holt finished his 10-year career with the Rams starting 147 of 158 games, recording 869 receptions for 12,660 yards, and 74 touchdowns—ranking second in Rams&#x27; history in each category behind Isaac Bruce.

===Jacksonville Jaguars===
Holt was signed by the Jacksonville Jaguars on April 20, 2009, to a 3-year, $20 million deal. Holt had 51 catches, but for the first time in his career he did not have a touchdown reception. Holt was released by the team on February 11, 2010, and only earned $3.45 million of the $20 million contract.

===Injuries and retirement===
On April 20, 2010, Holt signed a one-year, $1.7 million contract with the New England Patriots, but was placed on injured reserve on August 15, 2010, as a result of a knee injury that required surgery and was released by the team on August 17, 2010, with an injury settlement.

On April 4, 2012, Holt signed a ceremonial contract with the St. Louis Rams to retire with the team. He retired from professional football ranked 10th in league history with 13,382 yards receiving and 13th with 920 receptions.

===Hall of Fame voting===
As of 2024, Holt has been eligible for the Pro Football Hall of Fame for ten years in a row. He has made it to the semifinalist stage every year and has even been a finalist for five years in a row.

==NFL career statistics==
===Regular season===
==Post-playing career==
On November 20, 2010, during the Raycom Sports broadcast of the annual NCSU game with UNC-Chapel Hill, sideline reporter Mike Hogewood prefaced an interview with Holt stating that he had retired. Holt has since gotten into broadcasting with Fox Sports, providing commentary for their NFL coverage.

Holt joined NFL Network in 2010 as an analyst on the network&#x27;s signature show, &quot;NFL Total Access&quot;, as well as other NFL Network shows and specials. He made his debut as an analyst on the &quot;NFL Total Access: Pro Bowl Selection Show&quot; on December 28, 2010.

He is the older brother of safety Terrence Holt. The brothers co-own Holt Brothers, Inc..

Beginning in 2015, Holt became Heritage High School&#x27;s (NC) assistant football coach and wide receiver&#x27;s coach, along with former NFL players Dewayne Washington and Willie Parker.

<doc id="494563" wikidata="Q7286558" url="?curid=494563" title="Rake (stock character)">
<text>In a historical context, a rake (short for rakehell, analogous to &quot;&quot;) was a man who was habituated to immoral conduct, particularly womanizing. Often, a rake was also prodigal, wasting his (usually inherited) fortune on gambling, wine, women, and song, and incurring lavish debts in the process. Cad is a closely related term. Comparable terms are &quot;libertine&quot; and &quot;debauché&quot;.

The Restoration rake was a carefree, witty, sexually irresistible aristocrat whose heyday was during the English Restoration period (1660–1688) at the court of King Charles II. They were typified by the &quot;Merry Gang&quot; of courtiers, who included as prominent members John Wilmot, George Villiers, and Charles Sackville, who combined riotous living with intellectual pursuits and patronage of the arts. At this time the rake featured as a stock character in Restoration comedy.

After the reign of Charles II, and especially after the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the cultural perception of the rake took a dive into squalor. The rake became the butt of moralistic tales, in which his typical fate was debtors&#x27; prison, venereal disease, or, in the case of William Hogarth&#x27;s &quot;A Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot;, insanity in Bedlam.

==In history==

The defining period of the rake was at the court of Charles II in the late seventeenth century. Dubbed the &quot;Merry Gang&quot; by poet Andrew Marvell, their members included King Charles himself, George Villiers, John Wilmot, Charles Sedley, Charles Sackville, and playwrights William Wycherley and George Etherege. Following the tone set by the monarch himself, these men distinguished themselves in drinking, womanizing, and witty conversation, with Wilmot, the Earl of Rochester, outdoing all the rest. Many of them were inveterate gamblers and brawlers. Some were also duelists, but not with the approval of King Charles, who discouraged the practice of dueling. Highlights of their careers include Sedley and Sackville preaching naked to a crowd from an alehouse balcony in Covent Garden, as they simulated sex with each other, and the lowlight was Buckingham&#x27;s killing of Francis Talbot in a duel for the latter&#x27;s wife. In 1682 Thomas Wharton broke into a church at night and relieved himself against the communion table and in the pulpit.

A later group of aristocratic rakes were associated with the Hellfire Club in the eighteenth century. These included Francis Dashwood and John Wilkes.

Other rakes include Francis Charteris, Alessandro Cagliostro, Lord Byron, Jimi Arundell, John Mytton, Giacomo Casanova, Charles Mohun, the Marquis de Sade, Robert Fielding, and Beauchamp Bagenal.

==In restoration comedy==

On the whole, rakes may be subdivided into the penitent and persistent ones, the first being reformed by the heroine, the latter pursuing their immoral conduct. Libertinistic attitudes, such as (sexual) licentiousness, alcoholism, vagrancy, cheating and gambling, can be discerned in characters belonging to the satiric norm as well as to the satiric scene. However, only the degree of wit brings the rakish gentleman, the &quot;Truewit&quot;, closer to the satiric norm, whereas &quot;Falsewits&quot; are always exploded in the satiric scene. The motivation of a rake to change his libertine ways is either hypocritical (falsewits) or honest (truewits). In other words, penitent rakes among the falsewits only abandon their way of life for financial reasons, while penitent truewits ever so often succumb to the charms of the witty heroine and, at least, go through the motions of vowing constancy.

Another typology distinguishes between the &quot;polite rake&quot; and the &quot;debauch&quot;, using criteria of social class and style. In this case, the young, witty, and well-bred male character, who dominates the drawing rooms, is in sharp contrast to a contemptible debauch, who indulges in fornication, alcoholism, and hypocrisy.

Still other assessments of the libertine concentrate on the kind and intensity of libertine demeanor. Here, the rake falls into any one of three categories: extravagant libertine, vicious libertine, and philosophical libertine.

The extravagant rake is characterized by anti-normative conduct throughout, even though he finally settles down in matrimony. Between 1663 and 1668, examples are Wellbred in James Howard&#x27;s &quot;The English Mounsieur&quot; (1663/64), Philidor in James Howard&#x27;s &quot;All Mistaken&quot; (1665/1672), and Celadon in Dryden&#x27;s &quot;Secret Love&quot; (1667). In the 1690s, Sir Harry Wildair in George Farquhar&#x27;s &quot;The Constant Couple&quot; (1699) represents this kind of gentlemanly rake. The extravagant rake is as promiscuous and impulsive as he is wild and frivolous, and he finally finds his match in an equally extravagant and witty heroine. He is, above all, a self-aware character who &quot;is what he wants to be&quot;, who delights in those qualities &quot;with which he is endowed&quot;, and who provides &quot;carnival release&quot;. Thus, the extravagant rake is a comic figure because his actions are exaggerated. But he is never a comic fool.

The vicious rake is invariably presented as a despicable, if wealthy person, who thrives on scheming and intrigue. He is frequently married and abuses his wife (examples are Pinchwife in &quot;The Country Wife&quot; or Sir John Brute in John Vanbrugh&#x27;s &quot;The Provok&#x27;d Wife&quot;).

Finally, the philosophical rake, the most attractive libertine figure, is characterized by self-control and refined behavior as well as by a capacity for manipulating others. His pronounced libertine leanings are not supposed to contribute anything to the comic development of the plot. Rather, his libertinism is serious, thus reflecting the philosophical principles of the pleasure-seeking, cynical Court Wits. It is this kind of libertinism that has secured the notoriety of, say, William Wycherley&#x27;s &quot;The Country Wife&quot;, George Etherege&#x27;s &quot;The Man of Mode&quot;, and Sir Charles Sedley&#x27;s &quot;Bellamira: or, The Mistress&quot;. Not only characters like Horner and Dorimant spring to mind but also Rodophil and Palamede in Dryden&#x27;s &quot;Marriage-a-la-Mode&quot;, Longvil and Bruce in Thomas Shadwell&#x27;s &quot;The Virtuoso&quot; and the eponymous heroine in Sedley&#x27;s &quot;Bellamira&quot;. These plays are not representative of the average Restoration comedy, however. The reform of the ordinary rakish gentleman is the common pattern for the ending of the play. Similarly, extravagant rakes enter into marriage. However, as soon as the persistence of the rakes remains almost unquestioned, it is difficult to decide whether libertines, no matter of what &quot;colour&quot;, play a major part in their authors&#x27; satiric strategies. Although Etherege&#x27;s Dorimant is &quot;tamed&quot; by Harriet, his conversion at the end is rather doubtful. Similarly, Wycherley&#x27;s Horner is not punished satirically.

The libertine philosophy that the scintillating persistent rakes display seems to rebel against the narrow-mindedness and hypocrisy lurking behind the facade of Puritan honesty and bourgeois moral standards. It has been pointed out that the views of the philosophical libertine were strongly influenced by the philosophy of Thomas Hobbes. But then, Hobbes was not necessarily an unquestioned ideal among the court élite, and Hobbesian ideas certainly did not permeate many comedies. John Dryden, for one, drew on Hobbesian ideas in his tragedies but these ideas are internalised by villains only.

In his pursuit of pleasure and sensual satisfaction, the philosophical libertine shows hedonistic, Epicurean, and anti-rationalist patterns of thought. In their ideal of life, the libertines of this order may almost be compared to the genius of a somewhat later time: like the genius, the libertine rake is anti-authoritarian, anti-normative, and anti-traditional.

It is, above all, the emotional distance from the objects of his desire as well as from the havoc he creates, which renders the persistent rake so frightening. Criticism of the libertine was heard not only in the 1670s when &quot;sex comedies&quot; were en vogue but also earlier, whenever the male partner of the &quot;gay couple&quot; was blamed for having indulged in immoral behaviour. One major counter-argument was the call for poetic justice. Shadwell and Dryden, for example, discussed the necessity of poetic justice to punish dissoluteness in their plays. To reintroduce moral standards, the rake, they demanded, had to be reformed towards the end of the play. If a persistent rake was allowed to propagate his philosophical libertinism, &quot;poetische Ungerechtigkeit&quot; (&quot;poetic injustice&quot;) was likely to threaten the norm. Shadwell&#x27;s &quot;Epsom Wells&quot; may be regarded as a chief instigator of an excessive libertinism which is not questioned. The play, significantly, ends with a divorce rather than the standard device of a marriage.

However, the number of persistent rakes continued to grow, together with an upsurge in cuckolding action, and, between 1672 and 1687, not all persistent rakes are punished satirically. Only towards the end of the century did the increasing criticism of dramatic immorality and obscenity make the authors return to more traditional moral standards. In 1688, Shadwell&#x27;s &quot;Squire of Alsatia&quot; initiated the return to a Horatian &quot;prodesse&quot; in comedy, which had already been put forth in the Preface to &quot;The Humorist&quot; (1671): &quot;My design was it, to reprehend some of the Vices and Follies of the Age, which I take to be the most proper, and most useful way of writing Comedy&quot; (&quot;The Complete Works of Thomas Shadwell&quot;, ed. Montague Summers, Vol. I, p. 183).

As a consequence, future emphasis was no longer on libertine adventures but on the conversion and domestication of the dashing young men. Thomas d&#x27;Urfey&#x27;s &quot;Love for Money&quot; (1691) and Colley Cibber&#x27;s &quot;Love&#x27;s Last Shift&quot; (1696) are moralizing plays and pave the way for the sentimental comedy of the early eighteenth century.

<text>This is a list of episodes of the children&#x27;s television series &quot;The Magic School Bus,&quot; which is based on the series of books of the same name written by Joanna Cole and Bruce Degen.

The show&#x27;s continuity is not necessarily dependent on the order in which the episodes aired. In the first episode aired (&quot;Gets Lost In Space&quot;), Arnold mentions that the class has already been inside a rotten log (&quot;Meets the Rot Squad&quot;) and to the bottom of the ocean (various episodes, including &quot;Gets Eaten&quot;, &quot;Blows Its Top&quot;, and &quot;Ups and Downs&quot;).

<doc id="494574" wikidata="Q1427328" url="?curid=494574" title="Osmunda">
<text>Osmunda is a genus of primarily temperate-zone ferns of family Osmundaceae. Five to ten species have been listed for this genus. They have existed since the Early Cretaceous.

==Description==
Completely dimorphic fronds or pinnae (hemidimorphic), green photosynthetic sterile fronds, and non-photosynthetic spore-bearing fertile pinnae, with large, naked sporangia. Because of the large mass of sporangia that ripen uniformly at the same time to a showy golden color, the ferns look as if they are in flower, and so this genus is sometimes called the &quot;flowering ferns&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Osmunda&quot;, the type genus of the fern order, Osmundales has historically been the largest genus in the family Osmundaceae. Smith et al. (2006), who carried out the first higher-level pteridophyte classification published in the molecular phylogenetic era, described three genera in that family, namely &quot;Osmunda&quot;, &quot;Leptopteris&quot;, and &quot;Todea&quot;. The genus has also been treated historically as consisting of a number of subgroups, generally subgenera, &quot;Osmunda&quot; (3 species), &quot;Osmundastrum&quot; (2 species), and &quot;Plenasium&quot; (3–4 species). However, there was suspicion that the genus was not monophyletic.

The publication of a detailed phylogeny of the family by Metzgar et al. in 2008 showed that &quot;Osmunda&quot; as circumscribed was paraphyletic and that &quot;Osmunda cinnamomea&quot;, despite its morphological similarity to &quot;Osmunda claytoniana&quot;, was sister to the rest of the family, and resurrected the segregate genus &quot;Osmundastrum&quot;, by elevating it from subgenus, to contain it and render &quot;Osmunda&quot; monophyletic. The phylogeny of Osmunda is shown in the following cladograms.

A number of authors have proposed elevating the subgenera to separate genus level, In 2016 the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group (PPG) classification split &quot;Osmunda&quot; further by elevating its subgenera to genera as &quot;Claytosmunda&quot; and &quot;Plenasium&quot;, leaving only the species originally included in subgenus &quot;Osmunda&quot;.
*&quot;O. abyssinica&quot; 
*&quot;O. acuta&quot; 
*&quot;O. chengii&quot; [&quot;Osmunda claytoniites&quot; ]
*&quot;O. herbacea&quot; 
*&quot;O. hybrida&quot; 
*&quot;O. × intermedia&quot; {&quot;O. lancea&quot; × &quot;O. japonica&quot;}
*&quot;O. japonica&quot; (Japanese flowering fern)
*&quot;O. lancea&quot; (Japanese lancea flowering fern)
*&quot;O. x mildei&quot; {&quot;O. angustifolia&quot; × &quot;O. japonica&quot;}
*&quot;O. piresii&quot; 
*&quot;O. regalis&quot; (Old World royal fern)
*&quot;O. × ruggii&quot; {&quot;O. claytoniana&quot; × &quot;O. spectabilis&quot;}
*&quot;O. spectabilis&quot; (American royal fern)
*&quot;O. wehrii&quot; (Middle Miocene, Washington state)

===Etymology===
The derivation of the genus name is uncertain. A common theory is that &quot;Osmunda&quot; derives from &quot;Osmunder&quot;, a Saxon name for the god Thor. Other explanations propose that it is from Middle English and Middle French words for a type of fern, or mention an English folk tale of a boatman named Osmund hiding his wife and children in a patch of royal fern during the Danish invasion.

==Ecology==

&quot;Osmunda&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the engrailed.

One of the species, the cinnamon fern (&quot;Osmundastrum cinnamomeum&quot;) forms huge clonal colonies in swamp areas. These ferns form massive rootstocks with densely matted, wiry roots. This root mass is an excellent substrate for many epiphytal plants. They are often harvested as osmundine and used horticulturally, especially in propagating and growing orchids.

<text>Low German is a West Germanic language spoken mainly in Northern Germany and the northeastern Netherlands. The dialect of Plautdietsch is also spoken in the Russian Mennonite diaspora worldwide. &quot;Low&quot; refers to the altitude of the areas where it is typically spoken.

Low German is most closely related to Frisian and English, with which it forms the North Sea Germanic group of the West Germanic languages. Like Dutch, it has historically been spoken north of the Benrath and Uerdingen isoglosses, while forms of High German (of which Standard German is a standardized example) have historically been spoken south of those lines. Like Frisian, English, Dutch and the North Germanic languages, Low German has not undergone the High German consonant shift, as opposed to Standard High German, which is based on High German dialects. Low German evolved from Old Saxon (Old Low German), which is most closely related to Old Frisian and Old English (Anglo-Saxon).

The Low German dialects spoken in the Netherlands are mostly referred to as &quot;Low Saxon&quot;, those spoken in northwestern Germany (Lower Saxony, Westphalia, Schleswig-Holstein, Hamburg, Bremen, and Saxony-Anhalt west of the Elbe) as either Low German or Low Saxon, and those spoken in northeastern Germany (Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Brandenburg, and Saxony-Anhalt east of the Elbe) mostly as Low German, not being part of Low Saxon. This is because northwestern Germany and the northeastern Netherlands were the area of settlement of the Saxons (Old Saxony), while Low German spread to northeastern Germany through eastward migration of Low German speakers into areas with an originally Slavic-speaking population. This area is known as Germania Slavica, where the former Slavic influence is still visible in the names of settlements and physiogeographical features.

It has been estimated that Low German has approximately 2–5 million speakers in Germany, primarily Northern Germany (ranging from well to very well), and 2.15 million in the Netherlands (ranging from reasonable to very well).

==Geographical extent==
===Inside Europe===
====Germany====
It has been estimated that Low German has approximately two to five million speakers (depending on the definition of &#x27;native speaker&#x27;) in Germany, primarily in Northern Germany.

Variants of Low German are spoken in most parts of Northern Germany, for instance in the states of Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Hamburg, Bremen, Schleswig-Holstein, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Saxony-Anhalt, and Brandenburg. Small portions of northern Hesse and northern Thuringia are traditionally Low Saxon-speaking too.
Historically, Low German was also spoken in formerly German parts of Poland (e.g., Pomerania and Silesia), as well as in East Prussia and the Baltic provinces (modern Estonia and Latvia. The Baltic Germans spoke a distinct Low German dialect, which has influenced the vocabulary and phonetics of both Estonian and Latvian. The historical sprachraum of Low German also included contemporary northern Poland, East Prussia (the modern Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia), a part of western Lithuania, and the German communities in Estonia and Latvia, most notably their Hanseatic cities. German speakers in this area fled the Red Army or were forcibly expelled after the border changes at the end of World War II.

The language was also formerly spoken in the outer areas of what is now the city-state of Berlin, but in the course of urbanisation and national centralisation in that city, the language has vanished (the Berlin dialect itself is a northern outpost of High German, though it has some Low German features).

Today, there are still speakers outside Germany to be found in the coastal areas of present-day Poland (minority of ethnic German East Pomeranian speakers who were not expelled from Pomerania, as well as the regions around Braniewo). In the Southern Jutland region of Denmark there may still be some Low German speakers in some German minority communities, but the Low German dialects of Denmark can be considered moribund at this time.


====The Netherlands====
Dialects of Low German are spoken in the northeastern area of the Netherlands (Dutch Low Saxon) by approximately 1.6 million speakers. These dialects are written with an unstandardized orthography based on Standard Dutch orthography. The position of the language is, according to UNESCO, vulnerable. Between 1995 and 2011 the numbers of parent speakers dropped from 34% in 1995 to 15% in 2011. Numbers of child speakers dropped from 8% to 2% in the same period. According to a 2005 study 53% speak Low Saxon or Low Saxon and Dutch at home and 71% could speak it in the researched area. The total number of speakers is estimated at 1.7 million speakers. There are speakers in the Dutch north and eastern provinces of Groningen, Drenthe, Stellingwerf (part of Friesland), Overijssel, Gelderland, Utrecht and Flevoland, in several dialect groups per province.

===Outside Europe and the Mennonites===
There are also immigrant communities where Low German is spoken in the Western hemisphere, including Canada, the United States, Mexico, Belize, Venezuela, Bolivia, Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. In some of these countries, the language is part of the Mennonite religion and culture. There are Mennonite communities in Ontario, Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Kansas and Minnesota which use Low German in their religious services and communities. These Mennonites are descended from primarily Dutch settlers that had initially settled in the Vistula delta region of Prussia in the 16th and 17th centuries before moving to newly acquired Russian territories in Ukraine in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and then to the Americas in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The types of Low German spoken in these communities and in the Midwest region of the United States have diverged since emigration. The survival of the language is tenuous in many places, and has died out in many places where assimilation has occurred. Members and friends of the Historical Society of North German Settlements in western New York (Bergholz, New York), a community of Lutherans who trace their immigration from Pomerania in the 1840s, hold quarterly &quot;Plattdeutsch lunch&quot; events, where remaining speakers of the language gather to share and preserve the dialect. Mennonite colonies in Paraguay, Belize, and Chihuahua, Mexico, have made Low German a &quot;co-official language&quot; of the community.

East Pomeranian is also spoken in parts of southern and southeastern Brazil, in the latter especially in the state of , being official in five municipalities, and spoken among its ethnically European migrants elsewhere, primarily in the states of Rio de Janeiro and . East Pomeranian-speaking regions of Southern Brazil are often assimilated into the general German Brazilian population and culture, for example celebrating the , and there can even be a language shift from it to in some areas. In , nevertheless, Pomeranian Brazilians are more often proud of their language, and particular religious traditions and culture, and not uncommonly inheriting the nationalism of their ancestors, being more likely to accept marriages of its members with Brazilians of origins other than a Germanic Central European one than to assimilate with Brazilians of Swiss, Austrian, Czech, and non-East Pomeranian-speaking German and Prussian heritage – that were much more numerous immigrants to both Brazilian regions (and whose language almost faded out in the latter, due to assimilation and internal migration), by themselves less numerous than the Italian ones (with only Venetian communities in areas of highly Venetian presence conserving Talian, and other Italian languages and dialects fading out elsewhere).

==Nomenclature==

The language grouping of Low German is referred to, in the language itself as well as in its umbrella languages of German and Dutch, in several different ways, ranging from official names such as Niederdeutsche and Nederduits to more general characterisations such as &quot;dialect&quot;. The proliferation of names or characterisations is due in part to the grouping stretching mainly across two different countries and to it being a collection of varieties rather than a standardised language.

There are different uses of the term &quot;Low German&quot;:

* A specific name of any West Germanic varieties that neither have taken part in the High German consonant shift nor classify as Low Franconian or Anglo-Frisian; this is the scope discussed in this article.
* A broader term for the closely related, continental West Germanic languages unaffected by the High German consonant shift, nor classifying as Anglo-Frisian, and thus including Low Franconian varieties.

In Germany, native speakers of Low German call their language , , , , , (South-Westphalian), (Eastphalian), (Low Prussian), or . In the Netherlands, native speakers refer to their language as , , , or the name of their village, town or district.

Officially, Low German is called or (Nether or Low German language), or (Nether or Low German) in High German by the German authorities, (Nether or Low German language), or (Nether or Low German) in Low German by the German authorities and (Nether or Low Saxon) by the Dutch authorities. , and , are seen in linguistic texts from the German and Dutch linguistic communities respectively.

In Danish it is called , or, rarely, . Mennonite Low German is called .

&quot;Low&quot; refers to the flat plains and coastal area of the northern European lowlands, contrasted with the mountainous areas of central and southern Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, where High German (Highland German) is spoken. 

The colloquial term denotes both Low German dialects and any non-standard Western variety of German; this use is chiefly found in northern and Western Germany and is not considered to be linguistically correct.

The ISO 639-2 language code for Low German has been &quot;nds&quot; ( or ) since May 2000.

==Classification==

Low German is a part of the continental West Germanic dialect continuum. To the West, it blends into the Low Franconian languages, including Dutch. A distinguishing feature between the Low Franconian varieties and Low German varieties is the plural of the verbs. Low German varieties have a common verbal plural ending, whereas Low Franconian varieties have a different form for the second person plural. This is complicated in that in most Low Franconian varieties, including standard Dutch, the original second-person plural form has replaced the singular. Some dialects, including again standard Dutch, innovated a new second-person plural form in the last few centuries, using the other plural forms as the source.

To the South, Low German blends into the High German dialects of Central German that have been affected by the High German consonant shift. The division is usually drawn at the Benrath line that traces the &quot; – &quot; isogloss.

To the East, it abuts the Kashubian language (the only remnant of the Pomeranian language) and, since the expulsion of nearly all Germans from the Polish part of Pomerania following the Second World War, also by the Polish language.
East Pomeranian and Central Pomeranian are dialects of Low German.

To the North and Northwest, it abuts the Danish and the Frisian languages. In Germany, Low German has replaced the Danish and Frisian languages in many regions. Saterland Frisian is the only remnant of East Frisian language and is surrounded by Low German, as are the few remaining North Frisian varieties, and the Low German dialects of those regions have influences from Frisian substrates.

Most linguists classify the dialects of Low German together with English and Frisian as the &quot;North Sea Germanic&quot; or &quot;Ingvaeonic&quot; languages. However, most exclude Low German from the group often called Anglo-Frisian languages because some distinctive features of that group of languages are only partially preserved in Low German, for instance the Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law (some dialects have &quot;us&quot;, for &quot;us&quot; whereas others have , ), and because other distinctive features almost do not occur in Low German at all, for instance the palatalization and assibilation of (compare palatalized forms such as English &quot;cheese&quot;, Frisian to non-palatalized forms such as Low German or , Dutch , German but Low German Sever/Sebber while German Käfer) However, since Anglo-Frisian features occur in Low German and especially in its older language stages, there is a tendency to prefer the Ingvaeonic classification instead of the Anglo-Frisian one, which also takes Low German into account. Because Old Saxon came under strong Old High German and Old Low Franconian influence early on and therefore lost many Ingvaeonic features that were to be found much more extensively in earlier language states.

===Language or dialect===
The question of whether today&#x27;s Low German should be considered a separate language or a dialect of German or even Dutch has been a point of contention. Although Low German is mostly regarded as an independent language linguistics offers no simple, generally accepted criterion to decide the question.

Scholarly arguments have been put forward for classifying Low German as a German dialect. As stated above, the arguments are not linguistic but rather sociopolitical and revolve mainly around the fact that Low German has no official standard form or use in sophisticated media. The situation of Low German may thus be considered a &quot;pseudo-dialectized abstand language&quot; (&quot;&quot;). In contrast, Old Saxon and Middle Low German are generally considered separate languages in their own right. Since Low German has strongly declined since the 18th century, the perceived similarities with High German or Dutch may often be direct adaptations from the dominating standard language, resulting in a growing inability by speakers to speak correctly what was once Low German proper.

Others have argued for the independence of today&#x27;s Low German dialects, taken as continuous outflow of the Old Saxon and Middle Low German tradition. &quot;Glottolog&quot; classifies six varieties of Low German as distinct languages based on a low degree of mutual intelligibility. Eastern Low German and Plautdietsch are classified as part of Greater East Low German, while Eastphalian, Westphalic, and the North Low Saxon languages, German Northern Low Saxon and Gronings, are classified as part of West Low German.

===Legal status===
Low German has been recognized by the Netherlands and by Germany (since 1999) as a regional language according to the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. Within the official terminology defined in the charter, this status would not be available to a dialect of an official language (as per article 1a), and hence not to Low German in Germany if it were considered a dialect of German. Advocates of the promotion of Low German have expressed considerable hope that this political development will at once lend legitimacy to their claim that Low German is a separate language, and help mitigate the functional limits of the language that may still be cited as objective criteria for a mere dialect (such as the virtually complete absence from legal and administrative contexts, schools, the media, etc.).

At the request of Schleswig-Holstein, the German government has declared Low German as a regional language. German offices in Schleswig-Holstein are obliged to accept and handle applications in Low German on the same footing as Standard High German applications. The ruled in a case that this was even to be done at the patent office in Munich, in a non–Low German region, when the applicant then had to pay the charge for a translator, because applications in Low German are considered not to be written in the German language.

==History==
===Old Saxon===

Old Saxon (), also known as Old Low German (), is a West Germanic language. It is documented from the 9th century until the 12th century, when it evolved into Middle Low German. It was spoken on the north-west coast of Germany by Saxon peoples. It is closely related to Old Anglo-Frisian (Old Frisian, Old English), partially participating in the Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law.

Only a few texts survive, predominantly in baptismal vows the Saxons were required to perform at the behest of Charlemagne. The only literary texts preserved are &quot;Heliand&quot; and the Old Saxon Genesis.

===Middle Low German===

The Middle Low German language () is an ancestor of modern Low German. It was spoken from about 1100 to 1600. The neighbouring languages within the dialect continuum of the West Germanic languages were Middle Dutch in the West and Middle High German in the South, later substituted by Early New High German. Middle Low German was the lingua franca of the Hanseatic League, spoken all around the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. It had a significant influence on the Scandinavian languages and other languages around the Baltic Sea. Based on the language of Lübeck, a standardized written language was developing, though it was never codified.

===Contemporary===
There is a distinction between the German and the Dutch Low Saxon/Low German situation.

====Germany====
After mass education in Germany in the 19th and 20th centuries, the slow decline which Low German had been experiencing since the end of the Hanseatic League turned into a free fall. The decision to exclude Low German in formal education was not without controversy, however. On one hand, proponents of Low German advocated that since it had a strong cultural and historical value and was the native language of students in northern Germany, it had a place in the classroom. On the other hand, High German was considered the language of education, science, and national unity, and since schools promoted these values, High German was seen as the best candidate for the language of instruction.

Initially, regional languages and dialects were thought to limit the intellectual ability of their speakers. When historical linguists illustrated the archaic character of certain features and constructions of Low German, this was seen as a sign of its &quot;backwardness&quot;. It was not until the efforts of proponents such as Klaus Groth that this impression changed. Groth&#x27;s publications demonstrated that Low German was a valuable language in its own right, and he was able to convince others that Low German was suitable for literary arts and was a national treasure worth keeping.

Through the works of advocates like Groth, both proponents and opponents of Low German in formal education saw the language&#x27;s innate value as the cultural and historical language of northern Germany. Nevertheless, opponents claimed that it should simply remain a spoken and informal language to be used on the street and in the home, but not in formal schooling. In their opinion, it simply did not match the nationally unifying power of High German. As a result, while Low German literature was deemed worthy of being taught in school, High German was chosen as the language of scholarly instruction. With High German the language of education and Low German the language of the home and daily life, a stable diglossia developed in Northern Germany. Various Low German dialects are understood by 10 million people, but many fewer are native speakers. Total users of Low German (nds) are approximately 2.5 million, with 300,000 native speakers in Brazil and 1,000 in Germany as of 2016.

The KDE project supports Low German (nds) as a language for its computer desktop environment, as does the GNOME Desktop Project. Open-source software has been translated into Low German; this used to be coordinated via a page on SourceForge, but as of 2015, the most active project is that of KDE.

====Netherlands====
In the early 20th century, scholars in the Netherlands argued that speaking dialects hindered language acquisition, and it was therefore strongly discouraged. As education improved, and mass communication became more widespread, the Low Saxon dialects further declined, although decline has been greater in urban centres of the Low Saxon regions. When in 1975 dialect folk and rock bands such as Normaal and became successful with their overt disapproval of what they experienced as &quot;misplaced Dutch snobbery&quot; and the Western Dutch contempt for (speakers of) Low Saxon dialects, they gained a following among the more rurally oriented inhabitants, launching Low Saxon as a sub-culture. They inspired contemporary dialect artists and rock bands, such as , , , 
Nonetheless, the position of the language is vulnerable according to UNESCO. Low Saxon is still spoken more widely than in Northern Germany. Efforts are made in Germany and in the Netherlands to protect Low German as a regional language.

==Phonetic and grammatical changes==
===High German consonant shift===

As with the Anglo-Frisian and North Germanic languages, Low German has not been influenced by the High German consonant shift except for old having shifted to . Therefore, a lot of Low German words sound similar to their English counterparts. One feature that does distinguish Low German from English generally is final devoicing of obstruents, as exemplified by the words &#x27;good&#x27; and &#x27;wind&#x27; below. This is a characteristic of Dutch and German as well and involves positional neutralization of voicing contrast in the coda position for obstruents (i.e. t = d at the end of a syllable.) This is not used in English except in the Yorkshire dialect, where there is a process known as &quot;Yorkshire assimilation&quot;.

For instance: &quot;water&quot; , &quot;later&quot; , &quot;bit&quot; , &quot;dish&quot; , &quot;ship&quot; , &quot;pull&quot; , &quot;good&quot; , &quot;clock&quot; , &quot;sail&quot; , &quot;he&quot; , &quot;storm&quot; , &quot;wind&quot; , &quot;grass&quot; , &quot;hold&quot; , &quot;old&quot; .
The table below shows the relationship between Low German consonants which were unaffected by this chain shift and their equivalents in other West Germanic languages. Contemporary Swedish and Icelandic shown for comparison; Eastern and Western North Germanic languages, respectively.

For example, the correct equivalent term for &quot;wife&quot; in modern Dutch, German and Swedish is , and respectively; using , or for a human is considered archaic in Swedish and nowadays derogatory in Dutch and German, comparable to &quot;wicked girl&quot;. No cognate to / / has survived in English (compare Old English &quot;lady&quot;; the English word &quot;&quot; &quot;woman, lady&quot; rather being a borrowing of the Middle Dutch word).
:*** Pronounced &quot;shepp&quot; since the 17th century

===Ingvaeonisms===

Like English and Frisian, Low German is often recognized as a North Sea Germanic language and therefore has so-called Ingvaonisms. However, these are not distributed equally regionally everywhere. Some dialects have more and others fewer of these features, while some only occur in older forms of language and only leave relics in modern Low German.
===Other changes===

In addition, there are of course numerous other changes that are not related to Ingwaonic phenomena, but that arose in exchange with other languages or something else. The table below reflects some of these developments insofar as they affect several dialects and are therefore not exceptional phenomena.

==Grammar==
Generally speaking, Low German grammar shows similarities with the grammars of Dutch, Frisian, English, and Scots, but the dialects of Northern Germany share some features (especially lexical and syntactic features) with German dialects.

===Personal pronouns===
The following table tries to reflect the linguistic situation of the individual dialects as diverse as possible and to name as many case forms of the respective pronouns, but it is not able to do justice to every dialect. So the pronoun of the third person singular feminine can be pronounced as follows: se(e), sey, soi, etc. Only one of these variants can be found in the table. This also applies to all other pronouns.

Reflexive pronouns

While Old Saxon has lost the Germanic reflexive pronouns such as Old English and Old Frisian and instead resorts to the relevant third-person personal pronoun, modern Low German borrows reflexive pronouns from German. In Sauerland, it is conjugated as in Proto-Germanic and Icelandic. In addition, a distinction is made between the individual genders as well as individual and multiple people.


Examples:

The respective translations consist only of cognates of the same origins. The sentences do not necessarily have to correspond semantically.
===Verbs===
In Low German verbs are conjugated for person, number, and tense. There are five tenses in Low German: present tense, preterite, perfect, and pluperfect, and in Mennonite Low German the present perfect which signifies a remaining effect from a past finished action. For example, &quot;&quot;, &quot;I am come&quot;, means that the speaker came and he is still at the place to which he came as a result of his completed action.

Unlike Dutch, High German, and southern Low German, the northern dialects form the past participle without the prefix &quot;ge-&quot;, like the Scandinavian languages, Frisian and English. Compare northern Low German to the German past participle . This past participle is used with the auxiliary verbs &quot;hewwen/hebben&quot; &quot;to have&quot; and &quot;wesen/sin/sien&quot; &quot;to be&quot;. When the past participle ends with &quot;-en&quot; or in a few oft-used words like &quot;west&quot; (been).

The conjugation patterns can vary greatly depending on the dialect. The more northern dialects are strongly influenced by German, while East Westphalian and especially Vjens have retained many ancient features.



Synthetic subjunctive verb forms are mostly identical to the indicative forms of the past tense and the pluperfect tense - much like Dutch and English. It is thus only recognizable from the context of a sentence. It is often formed periphrastically by using the helping verbs &quot;woor&quot;, &quot;schull&quot;, &quot;wull&quot;, and &quot;dee&quot;: &quot;Ik woor/wöör/worr/wurr mi freuen, wenn Vader noch lang leev&quot; (I would be glad if father still lived for a long time). 

However, compared to most other dialects, the Westphalian dialect has preserved an extremely complex conjugation of strong verbs with subjunctive:

There is also a progressive form of verbs in present, corresponding to the same in the Dutch language.
It is formed with &quot;wesen&quot; (to be), the preposition &quot;an&quot; (at) and &quot;dat&quot; (the/it).
: 1 Instead of &quot;wesen, sien&quot; (to be) Saxon uses &quot;doon&quot; (to do) to make to present continuous.
: 2 Many see the &quot;″n&quot; as an old dative ending of &quot;dat&quot; which only occurs when being shortened after prepositions. This is actually the most frequently-used form in colloquial Low German.
: 3 This form is archaic and mostly unknown to Low German speakers. It is the same pattern as in the English example &quot;I am making.&quot; The present participle has the same form as the infinitive: &quot;maken&quot; is either &quot;to make&quot; or &quot;making&quot;.

In the very south of the East Westphalian language area, the original gerund of the West Germanic languages has been preserved:
===Adjectives===
The forms of Low German&#x27;s adjectives are distinct from other closely related languages such as German and English. These forms fall somewhere in between these two languages. As in German, the adjectives in Low German may make a distinction between singular and plural to agree with the nouns that they modify, as well as between the three genders, between the nominative and oblique cases and between indefinite (weak) and definite (strong) forms. However, there is a lot of variation in that respect and some or all of these distinctions may also be absent, so that a single undeclined form of the adjective can occur in all cases, as in English. This is especially common in the neuter. If the adjective is declined, the pattern tends to be as follows:

As mentioned above, alternative undeclined forms such as &quot;dat lütt Land&quot;, &quot;de lütt Lannen&quot;, &quot;en stark Kerl&quot;, &quot;de stark Kerl&quot;, &quot;stark Kerls&quot;, &quot;de stark Kerls&quot; etc. can occur.

===Nouns===

The Westphalian and Eastphalian dialects have also preserved the so-called &quot;dative&quot; -e, adding a final -e to masculine and neuter nouns in the dative case.
==Phonology==

===Consonants===

*A common feature of the Low German speaking dialects, is the retraction of / / to .
*The sound [] can occur as an allophone of // among dialects.
*// and // can have allophones as [] and [].
*// can be articulated as uvular [] among Northern dialects and younger speakers.
* The sound // can also be realized as fricative or affricate sounds [~~], [], in word-initial position.

===Vowels===
* [] and [] can occur as allophones of // and //.
*Vowel backness of // to [] may also occur among dialects.

* [] can be heard as an allophone of // within diphthongs.
* Long phonemes //, //, //, occur mostly in the Geest dialects, while in other dialects, they may be realized as diphthongs.

==Writing system==
Low German is written using the Latin alphabet. There is no official standard orthography, though there are several locally more or less accepted orthographic guidelines. Those in the Netherlands are mostly based on Dutch orthography and may vary per dialect region, and those in Germany mostly follow German orthography. To the latter group belongs the orthography devised by Johannes Sass. It is mostly used by modern official publications and internet sites, especially the Low German Wikipedia. This diversity, a result of centuries of official neglect and suppression, has a very fragmenting and thus weakening effect on the language as a whole, since it has created barriers that do not exist on the spoken level. This severely hampers interregional and interdialectal written communication. Most of these systems aim at representing the phonetic (allophonic) output rather than underlying (phonemic) representations.

A commonly voiced idea on both sides of the border on the topic of spelling is &#x27;Write it as you say it&#x27;, which results in semi-phonetic spellings based on either German or Dutch spelling conventions. This seriously affects international legibility, as pronunciation can vary wildly, resulting in many different written forms of what are essentially the same words. An attempt to unify the dialects in spelling was created by Reinhard Franz Hahn, a German-American linguist. He created the Algemeyne Schryvwys on etymological principles. He however restricted his spelling&#x27;s focus mostly to the northern German dialects. A group of enthusiasts from both sides of the border took his principles and expanded them for the majority of the Low German dialects in both the Netherlands and Germany. This reworked version is called the &quot;Nysassiske Skryvwyse&quot; (New Saxon Spelling).

==Low German culture==

As an important identity-forming element, the Low German language has been taught in schools in northern Germany for several years. In 2023, for example, the first class in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania graduated in the subject Low German. The social position of Low German has improved significantly in recent years and enjoys a high level of prestige, especially in modern cities such as Hamburg and Bremen.

Numerous formats in Low German are also offered on Norddeutscher Rundfunk. 

The television moderator Yared Dibaba has been campaigning for the preservation of Low German languages for years.The internet magazine &quot;Wearldspråke&quot; (alternatively also: Wearldsproake) is run by the musician and language activist Martin ter Denge.

In 2020 the film &quot;The Marriage Escape&quot; was released, which is mostly in Tweants.

Linguistically, historically and culturally there are close contacts with the Netherlands, Denmark and other predominantly Protestant inhabitants of the North and Baltic Seas such as Great Britain, the rest of Scandinavia and the Baltic states. In German usage, for example on Norddeutscher Rundfunk, northern Germany is occasionally viewed as part of Northern Europe, while the remaining part of Germany is less questioned as belonging to Central Europe. Close relationships also existed in the field of literature and poetry, for example the Norwegian Thidrekssaga (13th century) is based, according to its own information, on &quot;Low German&quot; and &quot;Saxon&quot; templates.

However, there are numerous other cultural and historical features that are common to the entire Low German-speaking area, such as the special architectural style of the &quot;Low German hall house&quot;. These houses are often provided with traditional gable decorations, which are also known under the terms &quot;Hengst&quot; and &quot;Hors&quot;.

The Germanic tribe of the Saxons, along with numerous other influencing factors like Slavic people, is considered one of the cultural and historical ancestors of the Northern Germans, so that there are still many points of connection to the Anglo-Saxons in folklore. The name of the city &quot;Bünde&quot; (&quot;Bund&quot;: German for alliance) is said to allude to the alliance the brothers Hengest and Horsa once made there and then settled in what is now England. Modern scholars regard Hengest and Horsa as mythical figures.

Since the Brothers Grimm were friends with the von Haxterhausen family, numerous fairy tales by the Grimm children and household tales come from the Westphalian and thus Low German cultural area. However, there are a remarkable number of Grimm&#x27;s fairy tales that are written in Low German in their original version, which is evidence of the high level of identification that North Germans have with their language.

There are also numerous fairy tales by the Brothers Grimm, which come from northern Germany, but are not or only partially in the original version in Low German.

Even in Schleswig-Holstein, in the former settlement area of the Angles, one finds solitude in the storytelling tradition. “Grendel” is a Schleswig-Holstein dialect expression for a monster living in swamps, as it appears in the Anglo-Saxon Beowulf poem .

Although there are no secession efforts in northern Germany, some are making efforts to strengthen northern German identity. In the 80s a flag was designed for Lower Germany, which is more or less widespread in northern Germany and is very heavily criticized, because their design is similar to the official flag of the Vepsians in Russia.

<text>Neuchâtel (, ; ; ) is a town, a municipality, and the capital of the Swiss canton of Neuchâtel on Lake Neuchâtel. Since the fusion in 2021 of the municipalities of Neuchâtel, Corcelles-Cormondrèche, Peseux, and Valangin, the city has approximately 33,000 inhabitants (80,000 in the metropolitan area). The city is sometimes referred to historically by the German name ; both the French and German names mean &quot;New Castle&quot;.

The castle after which the city is named was built by Rudolph III of Burgundy and completed in 1011. Originally part of the Kingdom of Burgundy, the city was absorbed into the Holy Roman Empire in 1033. The domain of the counts of Neuchatel was first referred to as a city in 1214. The city came under Prussian control from 1707 until 1848, with an interruption during the Napoleonic Wars from 1806 to 1814. In 1848, Neuchâtel became a republic and a canton of Switzerland.

Neuchâtel is a centre of the Swiss watch industry, the site of micro-technology and high-tech industries, and home to research centres and organizations such as the Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology (CSEM), and Philip Morris International&#x27;s &quot;Cube&quot;.

==Names and etymology==

&quot;Neuchâtel&quot; is a medieval toponym derived from the &quot;new&quot; (Modern French &quot;neuf&quot;) and &quot;castle&quot; (now &quot;château&quot;) in reference to the 10th century Neuchâtel Castle. In French, most adjectives, when used attributively, appear after their nouns; however, the leading position of the adjective is a phenomenon widely attested in the north and east of France, as well as in Belgium and in French-speaking Switzerland (Romandy). As with the various other places named Neuchâtel, Neufchâtel, Neufchâteau of northern France and Belgium, this reflects the Germanic influence on Gallo-Romance languages retained in the toponymy today. This contrasts with the Occitan Castelnaus (and the Frenchified Châteauneufs) in the south of France.

The German name for the town is &quot;Neuenburg&quot;, which also translates roughly as &quot;new castle&quot;. The longer form &quot;Neuenburg am See&quot; (&quot;Newcastle by the lake&quot;) is sometimes used to disambiguate it from the numerous other Neuenburgs, especially Neuenburg am Rhein. The Romansh language uses the French &quot;Neuchâtel&quot;, and occasionanally &quot;Neuschatel&quot; and &quot;Neufchâtel&quot;; contemporary Italian largely uses the French name as well, but occasionally the historic &quot;Neocastello&quot; is seen.

Regionally, the Romand (Arpitan) name for the town is &quot;Nôchâtél&quot; in the broad &quot;Orthographe de référence B&quot; and is pronounced &quot;N&#x27;tchati&quot; locally, &quot;N&#x27;tchatai&quot; in La Sagne, &quot;N&#x27;tchaté&quot; in Les Planchettes and &quot;Nchaté&quot; or &quot;Ntchaté&quot; in .

===Historic names===
The Neo-Latin name for Neuchâtel is the Greek-derived &quot;Neocomum&quot;, and this gives the adjective &quot;neocomensis&quot; which appears on the seal of the University of Neuchâtel (in &quot;Universitas Neocomensis Helvetiorum&quot;) and the English adjective Neocomian, a term for a former stratigraphic stage of the Early Cretaceous. Other Latin names seen historically include &quot;Novum castellum&quot; in 1011 (upon the presentation of Neuchâtel Castle by Rudolph III of Burgundy to his wife Ermengarde) and &quot;Novum Castrum&quot; in 1143.

Historic French names included &quot;Nuefchastel&quot; (attested in 1251), &quot;Neufchastel&quot; (1338), and &quot;Neufchatel&quot;, with modern &quot;Neuchâtel&quot; in use by 1750. In the Franche-Comté, the city was also called &quot;Neuchâtel-outre-Joux&quot; (&quot;Neuchâtel beyond Joux&quot;) to distinguish it from another Neuchâtel in that region, now called Neuchâtel-Urtière.

German names of the town included &quot;Nienburg&quot;, &quot;Nuvenburch&quot; (attested in 1033) &quot;Nüwenburg&quot;, &quot;Welschen Nüwenburg&quot;, &quot;Newenburg am See&quot; (&quot;Newcastle by the lake&quot;) and &quot;Welschneuburg&quot;, with modern &quot;Neuenburg&quot; established by 1725.

Italian names included &quot;Neocastello&quot; (which is occasionally seen in contemporary contexts) and &quot;Nuovo Castello&quot;.

==History==
===Prehistory===

The oldest traces of humans in the municipal area are the remains of a Magdalenian hunting camp, which was dated to 13,000 BC. It was discovered in 1990 during construction of the A5 motorway at Monruz (La Coudre). The site was about below the main road. Around the fire pits carved flints and bones were found. In addition to the flint and bone artifacts three tiny earrings from lignite were found. The earrings may have served as symbols of fertility and represent the oldest known art in Switzerland. This first camp was used by Cro-Magnons to hunt horse and reindeer in the area. Azilian hunters had a camp at the same site at about 11,000 BC. Since the climate had changed, their prey was now deer and wild boar.

During the 19th century, traces of some stilt houses were found in Le Cret near the red church. However, their location was not well documented and the site was lost. In 1999, during construction of the lower station of the funicular railway, which connects the railway station and university, the settlement was rediscovered. It was later determined to be a Cortaillod culture (middle Neolithic) village. According to dendrochronological studies, some of the piles were from 3571 BC.

A Hallstatt grave (early Iron Age) was found in the forest of Les Cadolles.

=== Antiquity ===
At Les Favarger a Gallo-Roman and at André Fontaine a small coin depot were discovered. In 1908, an excavation at the mouth of the discovered Gallo-Roman baths from the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD.

===Middle Ages===
One of the most important Merovingian cemeteries in the canton was discovered at Les Battieux in . In 1982, 38 graves dating from the 7th century were excavated many of which contained silver-inlaid or silver-plated belt buckles. Also in Serrières at the church of Saint-Jean, the remains of a 7th-century shrine were excavated.

In 1011, Rudolph III of Burgundy presented a &quot;Novum castellum&quot; or &quot;new castle&quot; on the lake shore to his wife, Ermengarde. It was long assumed that this new castle replaced an older one, but nothing about its location or design is known. At the time of this gift Neuchâtel was probably the center of a newly created royal court, which was recently developed to complement the other royal estates which managed western estates of the kings of Burgundy.

The first counts of Neuchâtel were named shortly afterwards, and in 1214 their domain was officially dubbed a city.

===Early modern era===
For three centuries, the County of Neuchâtel flourished, and in 1530, the people of Neuchâtel accepted the Reformation, and their city and territory were proclaimed to be indivisible from then on. Future rulers were required to seek investiture from the citizens.

With increasing power and prestige, Neuchâtel was raised to the level of a principality at the beginning of the 17th century. On the death in 1707 of Marie d&#x27;Orleans-Longueville, duchess de Nemours and Princess of Neuchâtel, the people had to choose her successor from among fifteen claimants. They wanted their new prince first and foremost to be a Protestant, and also to be strong enough to protect their territory but based far enough away to leave them to their own devices. Louis XIV actively promoted the many French pretenders to the title, but the Neuchâtelois people passed them over in favour of King Frederick I of Prussia, who claimed his entitlement in a rather complicated fashion through the Houses of Orange and Nassau. With the requisite stability assured, Neuchâtel entered its golden age, with commerce and industry (including watchmaking and lace) and banking undergoing steady expansion.

===Modern Neuchâtel===

At the beginning of the 19th century, Prussia sought to obtain Hanover whilst still maintaining neutrality and abstaining from the wars waged by Napoleon. Frederick William III had hoped that Prussia could receive the Electorate of Hanover from France only after the event of a British defeat and a resulting treaty, lest Prussia be forced to enter war alongside France against Britain over the territory, with which Britain had been in personal union since 1714. To achieve these aims of receiving Hanover with a simultaneous preservation of neutrality, Prussia offered to give up certain exclaves to the French, however, Napoleon exploited Prussia&#x27;s politically isolated position and forced Prussia to give up more than had been hoped, partake in the Continental Blockade, and to officially annex Hanover in the Treaty of Paris on 15 February 1806, resulting in the cession of the principality of Neuchâtel to Napoleon. Napoleon&#x27;s field marshal, Berthier, became Prince of Neuchâtel, building roads and restoring infrastructure, but never actually setting foot in his domain. After the fall of Napoleon, Frederick William III of Prussia reasserted his rights by proposing that Neuchâtel be linked with the other Swiss cantons (to exert better influence over all of them). On 12 September 1814, Neuchâtel became the capital of the 21st canton, but also remained a Prussian principality. It took a bloodless revolution in the decades following for Neuchâtel to shake off its princely past and declare itself, on 1 March 1848, a republic within the Swiss Confederation. Prussia yielded its claim to the canton following the 1856–1857 Neuchâtel Crisis.

On 1 January 2021 the former municipalities of Corcelles-Cormondrèche, Peseux and Valangin merged into the municipality of Neuchâtel. Corcelles-Cormondrèche was first mentioned in the historical record in 1092 as &quot;Curcellis&quot;. Around 1220 it was mentioned as &quot;Cormundreschi&quot;. Peseux was first mentioned in 1195 as &quot;apud Pusoz&quot; though this comes from a 15th-century copy of an earlier document. In 1278 it was mentioned as &quot;de Posoys&quot;. Valangin was first mentioned in 1241 as &quot;de Valengiz&quot;.

==Geography==

Before the 2021 merger of municipalities, Neuchâtel had an area, , of . Of this area, or 10.2% was used for agricultural purposes, while or 53.8% was forested. Of the rest of the land, or 35.5% was settled (buildings or roads), or 0.2% was either rivers or lakes and or 0.1% was unproductive land.

Of the built up area, industrial buildings made up 2.2% of the total area while housing and buildings made up 18.0% and transportation infrastructure made up 10.1%. while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 4.3%. Out of the forested land, 51.8% of the total land area was heavily forested and 2.0% is covered with orchards or small clusters of trees. Of the agricultural land, 1.4% was used for growing crops and 8.0% was pastures. All the water in the municipality is in lakes.

The city is located on the northwestern shore of Lake Neuchâtel, a few kilometers east of Peseux and west of Saint-Blaise. Above Neuchâtel, roads and train tracks rise steeply into the folds and ridges of the Jura range—known within the canton as the &quot;Montagnes neuchâteloises&quot;. Like the continuation of the mountains on either side, this is wild and hilly country, not exactly mountainous compared with the high Alps further south but still characterized by remote, windswept settlements and deep, rugged valleys. It is also the heartland of the celebrated Swiss watchmaking industry, centered on the once-famous towns of La Chaux-de-Fonds and Le Locle, which both rely heavily on their horological past to draw in visitors. The river Doubs marks for a part the border with France, set down in a gorge and forming along its path a waterfall, the , and lake, the Lac des Brenets.

The municipality was the capital of Neuchâtel District, until the district level of administration was eliminated on 1 January 2018.

<text>Medea (, &quot;Mēdeia&quot;) is a tragedy by the ancient Greek playwright Euripides based on a myth. It was first performed in 431 BC as part of a trilogy, the other plays of which have not survived. Its plot centers on the actions of Medea, a former princess of the kingdom of Colchis and the wife of Jason; she finds her position in the world threatened as Jason leaves her for a princess of Corinth and takes vengeance on him by murdering his new wife and her own two sons, before escaping to Athens to start a new life. 

Euripides&#x27;s play has been explored and interpreted by playwrights across the centuries and the world in a variety of ways, offering political, psychoanalytical, feminist, and many other original readings of Medea, Jason, and the core themes of the play.

&quot;Medea&quot;, along with three other plays, earned Euripides third prize in the City Dionysia. Some believe that this indicates a poor reception, but &quot;the competition that year was extraordinarily keen&quot;; Sophocles, often winning first prize, came second. The play was initially rediscovered with Rome&#x27;s Augustan drama, and then again in the 16th century. It has remained part of the tragedic repertoire, becoming a classic of the Western canon and the most frequently performed Greek tragedy in the 20th century. It experienced renewed interest in the feminist movement of the late 20th century, being interpreted as a nuanced and sympathetic portrayal of Medea&#x27;s struggle to take charge of her own life in a male-dominated world. The play holds the American Theatre Wing&#x27;s Tony Award record for most wins for the same female lead character in a play, with Judith Anderson winning in 1948, Zoe Caldwell in 1982, and Diana Rigg in 1994.

==History==

&quot;Medea&quot; was first performed in 431 BC at the City Dionysia festival. Here every year, three tragedians competed against each other, each writing a tetralogy of three tragedies and a satyr play (alongside &quot;Medea&quot; were &quot;Philoctetes&quot;, &quot;Dictys&quot; and the satyr play &quot;Theristai&quot;). In 431 the competition was among Euphorion (the son of famed playwright Aeschylus), Sophocles (Euripides&#x27;s main rival) and Euripides. Euphorion won, and Euripides placed third (and last). &quot;Medea&quot; has survived the transplants of culture and time and continues to captivate audiences with its riveting power. The play&#x27;s influence can be seen in the works of later playwrights, such as William Shakespeare.

While &quot;Medea&quot; is considered one of the great plays of the Western canon, Euripides&#x27;s place in the competition suggests that his first audience might not have responded so favorably. A scholium to line 264 of the play suggests that Medea&#x27;s children were traditionally killed by the Corinthians after her escape; so Euripides&#x27;s apparent invention of the filicide might have offended, as his first treatment of the Hippolytus myth did. That Euripides and others took liberties with Medea&#x27;s story may be inferred from the 1st-century-BC historian Diodorus Siculus: &quot;Speaking generally, it is because of the desire of the tragic poets for the marvellous that so varied and inconsistent an account of Medea has been given out.&quot; A common urban legend claimed that Euripides put the blame on Medea because the Corinthians had bribed him with a sum of five talents.

In the 4th century BC, South-Italian vase painting offers a number of Medea representations that are connected to Euripides&#x27;s play — the most famous is a krater in Munich. However, these representations always differ considerably from the plots of the play or are too general to support any direct link to Euripides&#x27;s play. But the violent and powerful character of Medea, and her double nature — both loving and destructive — became a standard for later periods of antiquity. Medea has been adapted into numerous forms of media, including operas, films, and novels.

With the text&#x27;s rediscovery in 1st-century Rome (the play was adapted by the tragedians Ennius, Lucius Accius, Ovid, Seneca the Younger and Hosidius Geta, among others), again in 16th-century Europe, and the development of modern literary criticism, &quot;Medea&quot; has provoked multifarious reactions.

==Form and themes==

The form of the play differs from many other Greek tragedies by its simplicity; most scenes involve only Medea, one other character, and The Chorus, representing the women of Corinth. These simple encounters highlight Medea&#x27;s skill and determination in manipulating powerful male figures. The play is also the only Greek tragedy in which a kin-killer makes it unpunished to the end of the play, and the only tragedy about child-killing in which the deed is performed in cold blood, as opposed to in a state of temporary madness. Medea&#x27;s rebellion shakes the world as she tells of her history, shedding light on the actions that ultimately lead to her denigration and dethronement. Euripides depicts Medea as a witch and a devourer of men and children, rather than as a wife and mother wronged.

Euripides&#x27; characterization of Medea exhibits the inner emotions of passion, love, and vengeance. 
According to classics scholar Fiona Macintosh, &quot;[Medea] has successfully negotiated her path through very diverse cultural and political contexts: either by being radically recast as &#x27;exemplary&#x27; mother and wife, or by being seen as a proto-feminist wrongly abandoned by a treacherous husband.&quot; 
Feminist readings have interpreted the play as either a sympathetic exploration of the disadvantages of being a woman in a patriarchal society, or as an expression of misogynist attitudes. 
In conflict with this sympathetic undertone (or reinforcing a more negative reading) is Medea&#x27;s barbarian identity, which some argue might antagonize a 5th-century BC Greek audience.

It can be argued that in the play Euripides portrays Medea as an enraged woman who kills her children to get revenge on her husband Jason because of his betrayal of their marriage. Medea is often cited as an example of the &quot;madwoman in the attic&quot; trope, in which women who defy societal norms are portrayed as mentally unstable. A competing interpretation is that Medea kills her children because she cares for them and worries about their well-being; once she commits to her plan to kill Creon and Jason&#x27;s new bride, she knows her children are in danger of being murdered. This is not a paranoid fantasy; at this time in myth and history, helping one&#x27;s friends and hurting one&#x27;s enemies was considered a virtue. Thus, by their code of ethics, the Corinthians would do right to avenge their king and princess. (In another version of the myth, the people of Corinth kill her children to avenge the deaths of Creon and his daughter Glauke.) Conversely, a focus on Medea&#x27;s rage leads to the interpretation that &quot;Medea becomes the personification of vengeance, with her humanity &#x27;mortified&#x27; and &#x27;sloughed off (Cowherd, 129). Medea&#x27;s heritage places her in a position more typically reserved for males. Hers is the power of the sun, appropriately symbolized by her great radiance, tremendous heat and boundless passion. In this view Medea is inhuman and her suffering is self-inflicted, just as Jason argues in his debate with her. And yet, if we see events through Medea&#x27;s eyes, we view a wife intent on vengeance, and a mother concerned about her children&#x27;s safety and quality of life. Thus, Medea as a wife kills Creon and Glauke in the act of vengeance, and Medea as a mother thinks her children will be better off killed by her hand than left to suffer at the hands of an enemy intent on vengeance. 

Medea is often described as having a &quot;heroic temper&quot; and a strong motivation to avoid the laughter of her enemies, &quot;even at the cost of decisions that contradict self-interest, personal safety, or strongly held moral beliefs&quot;. Although some may say that her motive was jealousy over Jason’s new bride, her pride also made her unwilling to let her enemies, in this case Jason and his new wife, look down on her. Medea stated that &quot;her enemies [would] cause her pain and rejoice,&quot; and that her priority was to &quot;avoid her enemies’ derision.&quot; Although the murder of her children would cause her pain, Medea’s temperament caused her to prioritize Jason’s unhappiness over anything else.

==Story==

&quot;Medea&quot; is centered on Medea&#x27;s calculated desire for revenge against her unfaithful husband. Medea is of divine descent and had the gift of prophecy. She married Jason and used her magic powers and advice to help him find and retrieve the golden fleece. The play is set in Corinth some time after Jason&#x27;s quest for the Golden Fleece, where he met Medea. The play begins with Medea in a blind rage towards Jason for arranging to marry Glauce, the daughter of king Creon. The nurse, overhearing Medea&#x27;s grief, fears what she might do to herself or her children.

Creon, in anticipation of Medea&#x27;s wrath, arrives and reveals his plans to send her into exile. Crouching at Creon&#x27;s feet, Medea begs him in the name of her children to allow her one day&#x27;s delay. At this Creon is moved and grants to her one more day in Corinth. Medea&#x27;s unexpected power of persuasion or even of fascination lies in her change of attitude: instead of preaching to Creon about the unpopularity of the &quot;sophoi&quot; she plays the role of a desperate mother, needing one day to prepare for exile. Medea is aware of the humiliating quality of this tactic, but she justifies it on the grounds of a gain and of her need to remain in Corinth: &quot;Do you think that I would ever have flattered that man unless I had some gain to make or some device to execute? I wouldn&#x27;t have even spoken or touched him with my hands&quot;. In the next scene Jason arrives to explain his rationale for his apparent betrayal. He explains that he could not pass up the opportunity to marry a royal princess, as Medea is only a barbarian woman, but hopes to someday join the two families and keep Medea as his mistress. Medea, and the chorus of Corinthian women, do not believe him. She reminds him that she left her own people for him (&quot;I rescued you [...] I betrayed both my father and my house [...] now where should I go?&quot;), and that she saved him and slew the dragon. Jason promises to support her after his new marriage (&quot;If you wish me to give you or the children extra money for your trip into exile, tell me; I&#x27;m ready to give it with a lavish hand&quot;), but Medea spurns him: &quot;Go on, play the bridegroom! Perhaps [...] you&#x27;ve made a match you&#x27;ll one day have cause to lament.&quot;

In the following scene Medea encounters Aegeus, king of Athens. He reveals to her that despite his marriage he is still without children. He visited the oracle who merely told him that he was instructed &quot;not to unstop the wineskin&#x27;s neck&quot;. Medea relays her current situation to him and begs for Aegeus to let her stay in Athens if she gives him drugs to end his infertility. Aegeus, unaware of Medea&#x27;s plans for revenge, agrees. 

Medea then returns to plotting the murders of Glauce and Creon. She decides to poison some golden robes (a family heirloom and gift from the sun god Helios, her grandfather) and a coronet, in hopes that the bride will not be able to resist wearing them, and consequently be poisoned. Medea resolves to kill her own children as well, not because the children have done anything wrong, but because she feels it is the best way to hurt Jason. She calls for Jason once more and, in an elaborate ruse, apologizes to him for overreacting to his decision to marry Glauce. When Jason appears fully convinced that she regrets her actions, Medea begins to cry in mourning of the exile. She convinces Jason to allow their two sons to give gifts to Glauce in hopes that Creon will lift the exile against the children. Eventually Jason agrees.

In the next scene a messenger recounts Glauce and Creon&#x27;s deaths. When the children arrived with the robes and coronet, Glauce gleefully put them on and went to find her father. The poison overtook her and she fell to the floor, dying horribly and painfully. Creon clutched her tightly as he tried to save her and, by coming in contact with the robes and coronet, was poisoned and died as well.

While Medea is pleased with her current success she decides to take it one step further. Since Jason brought shame upon her for trying to start a new family, Medea resolves to destroy the family he was willing to give up by killing their sons. Medea does have a moment of hesitation when she considers the pain that her children&#x27;s deaths will put her through. However, she steels her resolve to cause Jason the most pain possible and rushes offstage with a knife to kill her children. Determined to stop Medea, the chorus runs after her only to hear the children scream. Jason then rushes onto the scene to confront Medea about murdering Creon and Glauce, and he quickly discovers that his children have been killed as well. Medea then appears above the stage with the bodies of her children in a chariot given to her by the sun god Helios. When this play was put on, this scene was accomplished using the &quot;mechane&quot; device usually reserved for the appearance of a god or goddess. She confronts Jason, reveling in his pain at being unable to ever hold his children again:

Although Jason calls Medea most hateful to gods and men, the fact that the chariot is given to her by Helios indicates that she still has the gods on her side. As Bernard Knox points out, Medea&#x27;s last scene with concluding appearances parallels that of a number of indisputably divine beings in other plays by Euripides. Just like these gods, Medea &quot;interrupts and puts a stop to the violent action of the human being on the lower level, … justifies her savage revenge on the grounds that she has been treated with disrespect and mockery, … takes measures and gives orders for the burial of the dead, prophesies the future,&quot; and &quot;announces the foundation of a cult.&quot;

She then escapes to Athens in the divine chariot. The chorus is left contemplating the will of Zeus in Medea&#x27;s actions:

This deliberate murder of her children by Medea appears to be Euripides&#x27; invention, although some scholars believe Neophron created this alternate tradition. Her filicide would go on to become the standard for later writers. Pausanias, writing in the late 2nd century AD, records five different versions of what happened to Medea&#x27;s children after reporting that he has seen a monument for them while traveling in Corinth.

* Liz Lochhead&#x27;s &quot;Medea&quot; previewed at the Old Fruitmarket, Glasgow as part of Theatre Babel&#x27;s &quot;Greeks&quot; in 2000 before the Edinburgh Fringe and national tour. &quot;What Lochhead does is to recast MEDEA as an episode-ancient but new, cosmic yet agonisingly familiar- in a sex war which is recognisable to every woman, and most of the men, in the theatre&quot;, wrote &quot;The Scotsman&quot;.
*In 2000, Wesley Enoch wrote and directed a modern adaptation titled &quot;Black Medea&quot;, which was first produced by Sydney Theatre Company&#x27;s Blueprint at the Wharf 2 Theatre, Sydney, on 19 August 2000.

* Tom Lanoye (2001) used the story of Medea to bring up modern problems (such as migration and man vs. woman), resulting in a modernized version of Medea.

The production was noted (by Nehad Selaiha of the weekly &quot;Al-Ahram&quot;) not only for its unexpected change of plot at the very end but also for its chorus of one hundred who alternated their speech between Arabic and English. The translation used was that of George Theodoridis.

* February 2017: the play was staged in South Korea, directed by Hungarian theatre director Róbert Alföldi, with Lee Hye-young in the titular role.
* In some editions of the theatrical play, Medea would be played as a man instead of a woman to show a unique and perhaps more culturally accepted point of view. 
* In some play adaptations, Jason is played as a sympathetic figure who is manipulated by Medea, rather than a conniving opportunist.

<doc id="494588" wikidata="Q449582" url="?curid=494588" title="Artūrs Irbe">
<text>Artūrs Irbe (born 2 February 1967) is a Latvian professional ice hockey coach and former goaltender. Born during the Soviet era, Irbe played for various Soviet league teams and the Soviet Union national team before moving to North America in 1991. Irbe played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the San Jose Sharks, Dallas Stars, Vancouver Canucks, and Carolina Hurricanes. In 2004 Irbe returned to Europe to play until he retired in 2007. He has served as a goaltending coach with Dinamo Riga, the Washington Capitals, and the Buffalo Sabres, as well as internationally with the Latvia men&#x27;s national ice hockey team. He was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2010. Irbe was rated number 93 on &quot;The Hockey News&quot; list of the Top 100 Goalies of All-Time in 2018.

==Playing career==

Irbe was drafted in the 10th round, 196th overall, by the Minnesota North Stars in the 1989 NHL Entry Draft.

Irbe&#x27;s first professional hockey team was Dinamo Riga of the Soviet Hockey League (from 1987 to 1991). After playing in only two games during the 1986–87 season, Irbe received a chance to become Dinamo Riga&#x27;s number one goaltender during the 1987–88 season when their starting goaltender and Olympic champion, Vitali Samoilov, incurred a long-term injury. In his only full professional season, Irbe was outstanding in helping Dinamo Riga advance to the finals of the Soviet Hockey League, where they eventually lost to perennial Soviet champions CSKA Moscow. During this period, he also played for the Soviet Union in the World Championships in 1989 and 1990. The Soviet team won those two championships and Irbe was honoured as the best goalkeeper of the 1990 tournament. He refused to play for the Soviet Union in 1991 because Latvia had proclaimed independence from the Soviet Union on 4 May 1990 and the Soviet government attempted to use military force in January 1991 to stop Latvia&#x27;s independence. When the Moscow government sent tanks into Riga, Irbe was among those who took to the streets and put up barriers to protect buildings, radio stations, TV towers and historical landmarks.

In the 1988–89 season, Irbe travelled to North America with his then club Dinamo Riga to play in a series of exhibition games against National Hockey League (NHL) teams. The next season (1989–90), he was temporarily added to the CSKA Moscow team during an exhibition tour of North America.

===NHL===
Irbe began his playing career in North America with the International Hockey League (IHL) affiliate of the NHL&#x27;s San Jose Sharks, the Kansas City Blades. During the 1991–92 season with the Blades, he led the IHL in goals against average, playoffs games played, playoffs minutes played, playoffs wins, playoffs most goals allowed, playoffs assists and playoffs penalty minutes, and led the team to win the Turner Cup league championship.

In the 1991–92 season, Irbe also played in 14 games with the Sharks, with whom he would remain until the 1995–96 season. With Irbe playing goaltender, the newly established Sharks made their first playoff appearance in the 1993–94 season and upset the top-seeded Detroit Red Wings. That season, Irbe played an NHL record 4,412 minutes in goal for the Sharks. Irbe, affectionately known as &quot;Archie&quot;, was nicknamed &quot;The Wall&quot; and became a cult figure in San Jose, a status he enjoys there to this day. Following an injury (his hand being mauled by his pet dog in the off-season) and a poor 1995–96 season, Irbe was released by the Sharks.

For the next two years, Irbe served as the backup goaltender for the Dallas Stars and the Vancouver Canucks (for whom he played significant stretches with ample success) until he became the starter for the Carolina Hurricanes in the 1998–99 season. Irbe was picked to be a member of the World NHL All-Star team in the 1998–99 season, where he became the first goaltender to record an assist in an NHL All-Star Game. The highest point of his career with the Hurricanes was the 2001–02 season, when Irbe was instrumental in leading the Hurricanes to the Stanley Cup finals, where Carolina fell to the Detroit Red Wings.

===Demotion to ECHL===
After a disappointing 2002–03 season, the Hurricanes looked to demote Irbe because they could not move him due to the no-trade clause in his contract. On 16 October 2003, Irbe was assigned to the Johnstown Chiefs of the ECHL. After going 8–2–1 in 11 games with the Chiefs, Irbe was named as the starter for the Eastern Conference in the 2004 ECHL All-Star Game. However, Irbe was unable to participate due to a wrist injury. On 19 March 2004, Irbe was recalled to the Carolina Hurricanes after goaltender Kevin Weekes was placed on the injured reserve list due to season-ending hand surgery.

===Last days in the NHL===
Irbe played his last game in the NHL on 4 April 2004 against the Florida Panthers, where he was replaced by Kevin Weekes in the third period after conceding six goals. The game would end in a 6–6 tie, which would ultimately be the final tie in NHL history as the league moved to shootout in the following season in the 2005–06 season.

In June 2004, Irbe was traded to the Columbus Blue Jackets, but never played with the club due to that year&#x27;s NHL lockout. After the lockout canceled the 2004–05 season, Irbe never played in the NHL again, choosing to continue his career in Europe.

===Return to Europe===
Irbe played for HK Riga 2000 in Latvia and EC Red Bull Salzburg in Austria during the 2004–05 season. He signed with HK Dynamax Nitra playing in the Slovak Ice Hockey Extraliga, but he decided to leave after his unsatisfactory results.

==Equipment==
Irbe is notable on the ice for his helmet and padding – he has worn them almost continuously since his NHL debut for the San Jose Sharks – which are creased and scuffed with puck marks and stains. He has earned the nickname &quot;Michelin Man&quot; as a result.

In the early 2000s, he placed an ad in the &quot;Ottawa Pennysaver&quot; seeking any resident with the famed Jofa goaltender mask.

==Coaching career==
In 2008, Irbe signed a three-year contract with Dinamo Riga to work as the goaltending coach for the club. In August 2009, Irbe cut ties with Riga and decided to go back to North America to be the goaltending coach of the NHL&#x27;s Washington Capitals after former goaltending coach Dave Prior resigned for family reasons. Irbe left the team on 11 June 2011, to spend more time with his family.

In 2013, Irbe was named as Ted Nolan&#x27;s assistant for the Latvian national team, but resigned a year after a dispute with president of the Latvian Ice Hockey Federation Kirovs Lipmans over his coaching certification. In August 2014, Nolan again hired Irbe as an assistant, this time with the Buffalo Sabres.

While serving with Buffalo in 2014 at age 47, Irbe dressed as a goaltender after the injury of Michal Neuvirth to be the back-up goaltender for Jhonas Enroth.

In August 2017, Irbe became a consultant for the Latvian hockey league club HK Kurbads.

During the 2023 IIHF World Championship co-hosted in Tampere, Finland, and Riga, Latvia, Irbe won a bronze medal together with the Latvian national team as a goaltending coach. In addition, Latvian national team goaltender Artūrs Šilovs was named the MVP of the 2023 IIHF World Championship.

==Personal==
Irbe is also a member of board of directors of the Kids First Fund, a non-profit organization based in the United States which raises money for projects assisting abused and abandoned children in Latvia.

At the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Irbe was Latvia&#x27;s flag-bearer in the opening ceremonies.

<text>is a rhetorical concept in Japanese poetry.

==Definition==

 is a category of poetic words, often involving place names, that allow for greater allusions and intertextuality across Japanese poems.

 enables poets to express ideas and themes concisely—thus allowing them to stay in the confines of strict structures.
Some scholars see the use of geographical allusion as the evidence for a restricted scope of poetry writing. Although the poets&#x27; &quot;true&quot; meaning was true because the essence was initially pre-established, the poems were written within fixed topics (). The poet could inhabit a subjective position or persona and write about the topic, but not necessarily about their personal feelings; therefore, could have restrained the scope of topics a poet could write about.

 include locations familiar to the court of ancient Japan, such as:
* particularly sacred Shinto and Buddhist sites,
* places where historic events occurred, and
* places that trigger a separate mental association through a pun.

==Aesthetic function==

 serve as a significant tool to achieve (mystery and depth) in Japanese poetry by adding profound and indirect beauty in poems. It can be used as a source for identifying significant figures and places in ancient Japan.

==History==

The history of is found in documents on the study of poetry such as the &quot;of Noin&quot;, by the poet and monk of the late Heian period, and lists of places in the (Utamakura reference book).

 were first used by traveling priests. They collected stories from the towns they traveled to. Since they saw many places, it was easier to remember the details of a story by using a single, consistent reference point for each recurring event in their tales. Over time, the people across the Japan came to identify place names by the psychological feelings associated with the references made by the wandering priests.

After place names and people had become well established, eager poets went sightseeing to the sites of . Beyond becoming familiar with the scenery of the poems, entering the locale of a poem or story deepened one&#x27;s understanding of it.

 was also used in , a form of Japanese collaborative poetry that is the ancestor of and haiku poetry.

==Examples==

There are numerous instances of in Japanese literature, one of which is the . The source of this particular example is poem #3 in the &quot;Spring&quot; section.
In the poem above, Yoshino refers to a place in the Yamato region in the nearby of the capital. Yoshino is known for having both heavy snowfall and an abundance of cherry blossoms.

Poem #1 in &quot;Spring 1&quot; of &quot;Shin Kokin Wakashū&quot; also uses &quot;Yoshino&quot; for depicting the beginning of spring.
Another instance of poetic place name comes from &quot;Tales of Ise&quot;, a piece titled &quot;In the Provinces&quot; (#15).
&quot;Mount Shinobu&quot; is a pun on the verb &quot;shinobu,&quot; meaning &quot;to conceal,&quot; &quot;endure,&quot; &quot;long for,&quot; and &quot;remember&quot;.

===Contemporary examples===

<doc id="494596" wikidata="Q1755583" url="?curid=494596" title="Start Something">
<text>Start Something is the second studio album by the Welsh rock band Lostprophets, released on 2 February 2004 through Visible Noise in the United Kingdom and South Korea. The album was released internationally on 5 February 2004 through Columbia. The band began work on the album in 2003 after touring for support of their previous album, &quot;The Fake Sound of Progress&quot;. This is the second and last album featuring the original drummer Mike Chiplin.

&quot;Start Something&quot; was both a critical and commercial success, quickly becoming the band&#x27;s most successful album. It peaked at number 33 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the United States, and was eventually certified Gold by the RIAA. Six singles were released from the album: &quot;Burn Burn&quot;, &quot;Last Train Home&quot;, &quot;Wake Up (Make a Move)&quot;, &quot;Last Summer&quot;, &quot;Goodbye Tonight&quot; and the radio single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know&quot;. These singles helped Lostprophets reach mainstream popularity. The album would go on to be certified platinum by the BPI in the United Kingdom, and gold in the United States by the RIAA.

==Composition==
The album was produced by Eric Valentine who had also produced albums from Queens of the Stone Age and Good Charlotte. The band claimed they had settled on the title to introduce their abilities on a more grand musical level as compared to their actual debut &quot;The Fake Sound of Progress&quot;, as they considered it to be more of a reworked demo. According to lead singer Ian Watkins, the title was also influenced by several friends of the band they had claimed would &quot;love to do this and that, but never had the drive to do it&quot;.

Prior to the beginning of the recording process, the band had befriended Hoobastank as the two bands shared a recording space in Calabasas, California. Watkins and Jamie Oliver recorded their guest appearance for the Hoobastank song Out of Control off of their 2003 album The Reason.

The band cancelled their scheduled performance at the 2003 Reading and Leeds Festival to continue work on the album. Watkins claimed the band sought to finish recording, claiming &quot;We want to make the best record possible and did not want to rush anything, unfortunately these shows are at the final stages of making the record and we felt it was more important.&quot; The Scottish rock band Biffy Clyro replaced Lostprophets at the festival.

Billy Martin and Benji Madden of Good Charlotte record additional vocals on &quot;Last Train Home&quot;.

The track listing varies depending on region, the track &quot;We Are Godzilla, You Are Japan&quot; was omitted from the North American version of the album, though versions with the track have the final two tracks &quot;Sway&quot; and &quot;Outro&quot; consolidated into one track.

The band included two additional tracks for the album&#x27;s Japanese version; &quot;Lucky You&quot; and &quot;Like a Fire&quot;. Despite not appearing as a track on any of the singles or on any version outside of the Japanese and original Australian release; &quot;Lucky You&quot; was submitted by the band for its inclusion in the &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; soundtrack, released on 30 June 2004 alongside the film. Original pressings of the Australian release had also included &quot;Lucky You&quot; as the penultimate track, but it was later removed in 2005. Other recording outtakes such as &quot;The Politics of Emotion&quot;, &quot;Holding On&quot;, &quot;Our Broken Hearts&quot;, and &quot;Push Out the Jive, Bring in the Love&quot; were scrapped from the final track listing, though they appear on several singles.

===Artwork===
The album cover (designed by Watkins and Oliver) features a new gothic style logo with German blackletter typeface, replacing the old logo used for The Fake Sound of Progress. It would in itself be replaced for the band&#x27;s next album, but featured on several of the band&#x27;s singles taken from this album. Sometimes the lyrics &quot;but even through your doubts, we will still be here&quot;, taken from &quot;We Still Kill The Old Way&quot;, are written below the logo. The figure at the front of the artwork wears blue jeans, a black hoodie and a baseball cap and was jokingly thought to resemble Justin Timberlake in several humorous interviews with the band. However, the person actually depicted in the photograph was Watkins, as was later clarified by bassist Stuart Richardson in 2005.

At the time, Oliver was also an acclaimed artist with his work being displayed in several exhibitions depicting Rhondda life. There are slight variations with the cover in different territories with some editions showing the shadow of the figure with wings - either angels wings or more likely bird wings. This is best depicted in an official promotional wallpaper the band released for fans. The picture was shot on the 1st Street Bridge in Boyle Heights, directly east of Los Angeles, where the album was recorded and mixed. Watkins claimed he regarded artwork as &quot;just as important as the music&quot;. During a January 2010 interview, Watkins further reflected back on Lostprophets&#x27; prior artwork claiming &quot;I remember doing the &quot;Start Something&quot; record and compiling the inlay which is a collage of two years of our lives. It was so much fun. I&#x27;d sit there for hours looking at the booklet and all the little pictures. I did that to all the albums I bought.&quot;

===Promotion===
Songs from the new album were first performed live on 17 August 2003 at Newport, the first gig of three alongside a Birmingham date and a Manchester date, in preparation for the Reading and Leeds festival at the end of August. For these gigs, &quot;We Still Kill the Old Way&quot; became the regular opener, whilst sets closed with &quot;Burn Burn&quot;, with tracks from their previous album interspersed in between. Kerrang noted in a live review from Manchester that &quot;We Still Kill the Old Way&quot; and &quot;To Hell We Ride&quot; were &quot;&quot;well received&quot; but that &quot;the surfeit of new material leads to a comparatively muted response&quot;. At the end of July though it was announced that the band had cancelled their appearance at Reading and Leeds, whilst still promising to play the three warm-up shows, citing that they wanted the recording of Start Something to take precedence. Ian Watkins later announced &quot;Unfortunately these shows are at the final stages of making the record and we felt it was more important not to short change anyone.&quot;&quot; The band did however support Linkin Park at Wembley Arena in London on 22 November 2003 performing eight songs, including five from the upcoming album. Despite the recording process, the band performed a total of four dates in 2003.

The song &quot;To Hell We Ride&quot; made an appearance in the video game Need for Speed: Underground, released in November 2003, as a bonus feature of the game, users could unlock a custom 1999 Nissan Skyline GT-R given a custom livery with the band&#x27;s logo and artwork from the upcoming album as an easter egg.

Despite this; the album was positively received in the United States, being compared to American acts such as Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, and Incubus. The album&#x27;s first single &quot;Burn Burn&quot; had initially failed to chart in the United States; but the album&#x27;s second single &quot;Last Train Home&quot; quickly became a hit; prompting the album to sell 117,000 copies in its first week in America. &quot;Last Train Home&quot; had grown substantial attention in America in December 2003 through radio airplay regular MTV rotation. The single quickly became the band&#x27;s highest charting single in America, prompting the band members to appear as guests on Total Request Live on 13 March 2004. The single had also managed to beat fellow UK rock band The Darkness&#x27; hit single I Believe in a Thing Called Love (released in September 2003), charting twelve spots higher on Billboard&#x27;s Mainstream Rock charts upon release in December 2003. The song became the highest-charting single of any UK rock act in the United States in 2003. In mid-February 2004, &quot;Start Something&quot; peaked at #33 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 becoming the band&#x27;s highest charting album in the United States to date. The album also reached #121 on the &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Year-End Chart in the United States in December 2004. To date, it is the band&#x27;s only release certified by the RIAA. On 3 June 2004 the album was certified Gold by the RIAA in the United States. Despite the strong response to the album&#x27;s second single; &quot;Wake Up (Make a Move)&quot; was not as well received, though it also charted in America at #16, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know&quot;, was also released as a radio-only single on 26 October 2004, it ultimately peaked at #11 on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart and #24 on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.

===Australia/New Zealand===
Despite entering the New Zealand album charts at #14, &quot;Start Something&quot; did not yield any charting singles in the country. Australia had a similarly mixed reception for the album&#x27;s release as only &quot;Burn Burn&quot; and &quot;Last Train Home&quot; charted as singles respectively. Regardless; Burn Burn had managed to become a minor hit in Australia, peaking at #48 in December 2003.

====Streaming====
In May 2012 the album had still garnered 10.8 million plays by 640,000 listeners on Last.FM. As of May 2023, the album is still the band&#x27;s most popular record following their breakup in 2013. Spotify reported that &quot;Start Something&quot; still receives over 60,000 monthly plays from users in the UK.

Despite Watkins&#x27; conviction in 2012; the album remains purchasable internationally on Apple Music. Spotify also has the album available for play only for users in the United Kingdom and Japan. Much of the band&#x27;s Visible Noise catalogue was not renewed for licensing to be streamed in markets such as North America, Australia, or South Korea after 2012.

==Critical Reception==

The album received mostly positive reviews from music critics, At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 70, based on 13 reviews.

Johnny Loftus from Allmusic gave the album a negative review, claiming that they had too big of a resemblance to American bands such as Faith No More, Incubus and Hoobastank; Loftus gave the album 2 out of 5 stars. He noted a more melodic singing style on the album when compared to &quot;The Fake Sound of Progress&quot;, commenting that &quot;the Mike Patton scream Prophets vocalist Ian Watkins perfected on 2001&#x27;s &quot;Fake Sound of Progress&quot; has — like it did for Brandon Boyd and Doug Robb — mellowed into a blandly earnest yawp capable of keeping things thick enough for the dudes but still rife with those heartfelt intakes of breath that the ladies love.&quot; In his July 2004 review, Jason MacNeil of PopMatters also considered the album to be derivative of American bands, labelling the track &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know&quot; as &quot;Incubus-by-numbers&quot;, adding that on the title track &quot;Faith No More is also brought back from the dead as the piano tinkling surpasses the guitars.&quot;

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reviewer Kirk Miller was more positive to the album and called it a &quot;kick-ass tribute&quot; because of its resemblance to Faith No More, and gave the album 3 out of 5 stars. Justin Kownacki from Splendid said &quot;this is one of those finely-polished discs that should have no trouble finding a huge audience&quot; and was more over positive to the album.

Drowned in Sound reviewer Gen Williams said &quot;It&#x27;s a really really really really really REALLY great pop-metal explosion.&quot; and continued to say &quot;Burn Burn&quot; boasted &quot;the catchiest hook this side of Linkin Park&quot; and that the alleged Adamski rip-off was justified because of the song&#x27;s quality, and giving the album 8 out of 10 stars.

&quot;Q&quot; called it &quot;Unashamedly Epic.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; said &quot;This is something genuinely fresh... here friends, is the real sound of progress (reference to the band&#x27;s previous effort, &quot;The Fake Sound of Progress&quot;)&quot; and Observer Music Monthly credited Start Something on being &quot;A hybrid of big rock choruses, powerful rhythms and a neat pop edge to their rock artillery.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album a B and said that Lostprophets &quot;mostly live up to that high standard by juxtaposing gnarly metal riffs with quirky electronic interludes. Only the occasional lapse into Linkin Park-style self-indulgence drags them down.&quot;

It was ranked seventh in Kerrang! magazine&#x27;s Albums of the Year 2004 list. In a readers poll titled Top 100 British Rock Albums the album was ranked eighteenth, and was the third highest of the 2000s, however the poll was taken in February 2005 whilst the album was still fresh in the mind for many.

In 2005, &quot;Start Something&quot; was ranked number 364 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. Rock Sound magazine ranked the album eighth on their Critics&#x27; Poll 2004, the highest placing for a British band.

==Tour==
To promote the album, the band toured North America, Europe, Asia and Oceania. Four months before the release of &quot;Start Something&quot; the band embarked on a tour in support. The tour began in the United Kingdom. The band also announced dates, opening for Linkin Park on their UK arena tour for select dates in October 2003. The band also announced performances at the NME Award show at the London Astoria and later announced further UK dates in Glasgow, Newcastle and Manchester among others. The concert in the London Astoria ended up being sold out.

The band took part in the second European leg of Metallica&#x27;s Madly in Anger with the World Tour alongside Slipknot and Godsmack. Lostprophets were billed as the opening act for European dates stretching from 26 May, to 4 July 2004. Though their own touring commitments forced them to drop from the tour with Metallica prior to the second North American leg in August as they were also obligated to perform in the United States later that month.

The North American leg of the tour began on 19 March 2004, lasting until 18 December. Lostprophets would also take part of &quot;MTV&#x27;s Campus Invasion Tour&quot;, in support for headliners Hoobastank, beginning at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, Tennessee. In May 2004 the band performed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada for a one night show. The band announced further dates in New Zealand and Australia as a part of the Big Day Out festival, and dates in Asia were later announced, marking the band&#x27;s first performance in Japan. The band returned to the UK in November 2004 as their own headliners, and capped off their tour with 10 additional American dates, ultimately ending the tour in Cleveland, Ohio on 18 December 2004.

Prior to 2013, &quot;Start Something&quot; was still the band&#x27;s most popular album with just over 35% of songs coming from that album across all their performances from 2004 to 2012. During the band&#x27;s 2012 tour in support of their album &quot;Weapons&quot;, the band announced a homecoming show at Cardiff&#x27;s Motorpoint Arena where the album was played in its entirety. Stuart Richardson said &quot;&quot;We wrote the record in Caerphilly. Start Something is when we kind of came into our own as a band, and Cardiff is where we came into our own as people&quot;. The performance sold out with a crowd of 10,000 people.

==Legacy==
In June 2012 the album was entered into Rock Sound magazine&#x27;s Hall of Fame with features on how the band look back on the album and how it has influenced others. Rock Sound said that the album made the band into &quot;one of our greatest rock commodities&quot; and called it a &quot;defining record for the UK rock scene as a whole&quot;&quot;. Lee Gaze stated &quot;&quot;Start Something is the greatest hits of what Lostprophets do&quot;. Aled Phillips of Kids in Glass Houses said &quot;it was a turning point for a lot of bands&quot; but also that &quot;everyone&#x27;s jeans got tighter and started wearing Nike Dunks - it was a cultural shift. With them it was never just about the music, everybody got swept up in the whole aesthetic as well&quot;&quot;. Five British rock records - &quot;All Our Kings Are Dead&quot;, &quot;We Are the Dynamite&quot;, &quot;World Record&quot;, &quot;Free&quot; and &quot;Hold Me Down&quot; - were all cited as being heavily influenced by Start Something.

BBC Wales called the album a &quot;&quot;modern rock classic&quot; in retrospect and BBC Music called it a &quot;UK rock classic&quot;. Whilst WalesOnline noted how the album had been &quot;a galvanising force in the Welsh rock scene&quot;&quot;. The BBC also produced a radio programme with Bethan Elfyn that aired on BBC Radio 1 in May 2010, which featured the Stereophonics, Manic Street Preachers, Funeral for a Friend and The Blackout amongst others, and titled it &quot;Start Something: The Story of South Wales Rock&quot; in honour of the album. The album was included in &quot;Rock Sound&quot;″s 101 Modern Classics list at number 14.

The album has sold 2.5 million copies worldwide to date; according to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).
