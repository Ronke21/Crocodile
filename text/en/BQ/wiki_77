<text>&quot;Archaeoraptor&quot; is the informal generic name for a fossil chimera from China in an article published in &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine in 1999. The magazine claimed that the fossil was a &quot;missing link&quot; between birds and terrestrial theropod dinosaurs. Even before this publication, there had been severe doubts about the fossil&#x27;s authenticity. A further scientific study showed it to be a forgery constructed from rearranged pieces of real fossils from different species. Zhou &quot;et al.&quot; found that the head and upper body belong to a specimen of the primitive fossil bird &quot;Yanornis&quot;. A 2002 study found that the tail belongs to a small winged dromaeosaur, &quot;Microraptor&quot;, named in 2000. The legs and feet belong to an as-yet-unknown-animal.

The scandal brought attention to illegal fossil deals conducted in China. Although &quot;Archaeoraptor&quot; was a forgery, many true examples of feathered dinosaurs have been found and demonstrate the evolutionary connection between birds and other theropods.

==Scandal==
&quot;Archaeoraptor&quot; was unveiled at a press conference held by &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine in October 1999. At the same press conference, plans were announced to return the fossil to Chinese authorities, as it was illegally exported. In November 1999 &quot;National Geographic&quot; featured the fossil in an article written by art editor Christopher Sloan. The article in general discussed feathered dinosaurs and the origin of birds. It claimed the fossil was &quot;a missing link between terrestrial dinosaurs and birds that could fly&quot; and informally referred to it as &quot;Archaeoraptor liaoningensis&quot;, announcing it would later be formally named as such. This name means &quot;ancient raptor of Liaoning&quot;. This drew immediate criticism from Storrs L. Olson, Curator of Birds at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. Writing in &quot;Backbone&quot;, the newsletter of his museum, he denounced the publication of a scientific name in a popular journal, without peer review, as a &quot;nightmare&quot;.

On February 3, 2000, &quot;National Geographic&quot; issued a press release stating that the fossil could be a composite and that an internal investigation had begun. In that same month Bill Allen, &quot;National Geographic&quot; editor, told &quot;Nature&quot; that he was &quot;furious&quot; to learn that the fossil might have been faked. In the March issue, in the forum section, a letter from Dr. Xu Xing pointed out that the tail section probably did not match the upper body. In October 2000 &quot;National Geographic&quot; published the results of their investigation, in an article written by Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist Lewis M. Simons. Simons concluded that the fossil was a composite and that virtually everyone involved in the project had made some mistakes.

===Chronology===

According to &quot;National Geographic&quot;&#x27;s report, the story of &quot;Archaeoraptor&quot; begins in July 1997 in Xiasanjiazi, China, where farmers routinely dug in the shale pits with picks and sold fossils to dealers for a few dollars. This was an illegal practice, but it was common then. In this case, one farmer found a rare fossil of a toothed bird, complete with feather impressions. The fossil broke into pieces during collection. Nearby, in the same pit, he found pieces including a feathered tail and legs. He cemented several of these pieces together in a manner that he believed was correct. He knew that it would make a more complete-looking and, thus, more expensive fossil. It was sold in June 1998 to an anonymous dealer and smuggled to the United States. According to authorities in Beijing, no fossils may leave China legally.

By the fall 1998 annual meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, held in Utah, United States, rumors were circulating about a striking fossil of a primitive bird that was in private hands. This fossil was presented by an anonymous dealer at a gem show in Tucson, Arizona. The Dinosaur Museum in Blanding, Utah, purchased it in February 1999. The museum was run by the late Stephen A. Czerkas (d. 2015) and his wife, Sylvia Czerkas. Mr. Czerkas did not hold a university degree, but he was a dinosaur enthusiast and artist. He arranged for patrons of his museum, including trustee Dale Slade, to provide $80,000 for the purchase of the fossil, to study it scientifically, and prevent it from disappearing into an anonymous private collection.

The Czerkases contacted paleontologist Phil Currie, who contacted the National Geographic Society. Currie agreed to study the fossil on condition that it was eventually returned to China. The National Geographic Society intended to get the fossil formally published in the peer-reviewed science journal &quot;Nature&quot;, and then follow up immediately with a press conference and an issue of &quot;National Geographic&quot;. Editor Bill Allen asked that all members of the project keep the fossil secret so that the magazine would have a scoop on the story.

Slade and the Czerkases intended the fossil to be the &quot;crown jewel&quot; of the Dinosaur Museum and planned to keep it on display there for five years. Sloan says that he flew to Utah in the spring of 1999 to convince Stephen Czerkas to return the fossil to China immediately after publication, or he would not write about it for &quot;National Geographic&quot; and Currie would not work on it. Czerkas then agreed. Currie then contacted the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing, and &quot;National Geographic&quot; flew the IVPP&#x27;s Xu Xing to Utah to be part of the &quot;Archaeoraptor&quot; team.

During the initial examination of the fossil on March 6, 1999, it had already become clear to Currie that the left and right feet mirrored each other perfectly and that the fossil had been completed by using both slab and counter slab. He also noticed no connection could be seen between the tail and the body. In July 1999, Currie and the Czerkases brought the fossil to the High-Resolution X-ray CT Facility of the University of Texas (Austin) founded and operated by Dr. Timothy Rowe to make CT scans. Rowe, having made the scans on July 29, determined that they indicated that the bottom fragments, showing the tail and the lower legs, were not part of the larger fossil. He informed the Czerkases on August 2 that there was a chance of the whole being a fraud. During a subsequent discussion, Rowe and Currie were pressured by the Czerkases to keep their reservations private.

Currie in the first week of September sent his preparator, Kevin Aulenback, to the Dinosaur Museum in Blanding to prepare the fossil for better study. Aulenback concluded that the fossil was &quot;a composite specimen of at least 3 specimens...with a maximum...of five...separate specimens&quot;, but the Czerkases angrily denied this and Aulenbeck only reported this to Currie. Currie did not inform &quot;National Geographic&quot; of these problems.

On August 13, 1999, the team submitted a manuscript titled &quot;A New Toothed Bird With a Dromaeosaur-like Tail&quot; under the names of Stephen Czerkas, Currie, Rowe, and Xu, to the journal &quot;Nature&quot; in London. The paper mentions two places and includes a figure illustrating the point that one of the legs and the tail are counterparts that were composited into the main slab.

On August 20 &quot;Nature&quot; rejected the paper, indicating to the Czerkases that &quot;National Geographic&quot; had refused to delay publication, leaving too little time for peer review. The authors then submitted the paper to &quot;Science&quot;, which sent it out for peer review. Two reviewers informed &quot;Science&quot; that &quot;the specimen was smuggled out of China and illegally purchased&quot; and that the fossil had been &quot;doctored&quot; in China &quot;to enhance its value.&quot; &quot;Science&quot; then rejected the paper. According to Sloan, the Czerkases did not inform &quot;National Geographic&quot; about the details of the two rejections.

By that time the November issue of &quot;National Geographic&quot; was already in preparation for printing, but &quot;Archaeoraptor&quot; was never formally published in any peer-reviewed journal.

&quot;National Geographic&quot; went ahead and published without peer review. The fossil was unveiled in a press conference on October 15, 1999, and in November 1999 &quot;National Geographic&quot; contained an article by Christopher P. Sloan—a &quot;National Geographic&quot; art editor. Sloan described it as a missing link that helped elucidate the connection between dinosaurs and birds. The original fossil was put on display at the National Geographic Society in Washington, D.C., pending return to China. In the article Sloan used the name &quot;Archaeoraptor liaoningensis&quot; but with a disclaimer (so that it would not count as a nomenclatural act for scientific classification) in anticipation of Czerkas being able to publish a peer-reviewed description at some point in the future.

After the November &quot;National Geographic&quot; came out, Storrs L. Olson, curator of birds in the National Museum of Natural History of the Smithsonian Institution published an open letter on 1 November 1999, pointing out that &quot;the specimen in question is known to have been illegally exported&quot; and protesting the &quot;prevailing dogma that birds evolved from dinosaurs.&quot; Olson complained that Sloan, a journalist, had usurped the process of scientific nomenclature by publishing a name first in the popular press: &quot;This is the worst nightmare of many zoologists—that their chance to name a new organism will be inadvertently scooped by some witless journalist.&quot;

In October 1999, after having been informed by Currie of the problems and seeing the specimen for the first time, Xu noticed that the tail of &quot;Archaeoraptor&quot; strongly resembled an unnamed maniraptoran dinosaur that he was studying—later to be named &quot;Microraptor zhaoianus&quot;. He returned to China and traveled to Liaoning Province where he inspected the fossil site and contacted several fossil dealers. He eventually found a fairly complete fossil of a tiny dromaeosaur, and the tail of this new fossil corresponded so exactly to the tail on the &quot;Archaeoraptor&quot; fossil that it had to be the counter slab— it even had two matching yellow oxide stains. On December 20, 1999, Xu Xing sent e-mails to the authors and Sloan, announcing that the fossil was a fake.

On February 3, 2000, &quot;The National Geographic News&quot; issued a press release stating that the &quot;Archaeoraptor&quot; fossil might be a composite and that an internal investigation had begun. In the March issue of &quot;National Geographic&quot; Xu&#x27;s letter ran in the Forum section of the magazine, and Bill Allen had Xu change the word &quot;fake&quot; to &quot;composite&quot;.

On April 4, 2000, Stephen Czerkas told a group of paleontologists in Washington that he and Sylvia had made &quot;an idiot, bone-stupid mistake&quot;. Currie, Allen, and Sloan all expressed regret. Rowe felt vindicated, claiming the affair as evidence that his scans were correct. Rowe published a Brief Communication in &quot;Nature&quot; in 2001 describing his findings. He concluded that, apart from the top part, several specimens had been used to complete the fossil: a first for the left femur, a second for the tibiae, a third for both feet, and at least one more for the tail, which alone consisted of five separate parts.

In June 2000 the fossil was returned to China. In the October 2000 issue, &quot;National Geographic&quot; published the results of their investigation.

==Ongoing confusion==
The fossils involved in the &quot;Archaeoraptor&quot; scandal have led to ongoing confusion over taxon names. In December 2000, &quot;Microraptor&quot; was described in &quot;Nature&quot;. Zhou &quot;et al.&quot; (2002) examined the upper body of the &quot;Archaeoraptor&quot; fossil and reported that it belonged to the previously-named genus &quot;Yanornis&quot;.

===&quot;Dinosaur Museum Journal&quot;===
In 2002 the Czerkases published a volume through their Dinosaur Museum titled &quot;Feathered Dinosaurs and the Origin of Flight&quot;. In this journal, they described and named several species. Of the six species named in the book, five are disputed.

Despite the work of Zhou &quot;et al.&quot; (2002), Czerkas and co-author Xu Xing described the upper portion of the &quot;Archaeoraptor&quot; fossil as a new bird genus, &quot;Archaeovolans&quot;, in the &quot;Dinosaur Museum Journal&quot;. The article does include the caveat that it might be a specimen of &quot;Yanornis&quot;. Thus, this same fossil specimen has been named &quot;Archaeoraptor&quot;, &quot;Archeovolans&quot;, and &quot;Yanornis&quot; in different places.

Across the monographs in the &quot;Dinosaur Museum Journal&quot;, Stephen Czerkas built a case for his controversial view that maniraptoran dinosaurs are secondarily flightless birds. In so doing, he criticized prominent paleontologists. In the text on &quot;Cryptovolans&quot;, Czerkas accused Dr. Mark Norell of misinterpreting the fossil BPM 1 3-13 as having long leg feathers due to the &quot;blinding influences of preconceived ideas.&quot; Though Norell&#x27;s interpretation was correct, Czerkas added leg feathers to his reconstruction of the fossil in the art that promotes the traveling exhibit.

Two other taxa that Czerkas and his co-authors named were later treated as junior synonyms by other authors. Czerkas&#x27; &quot;Cryptovolans&quot; was treated as &quot;Microraptor&quot;, and his &quot;Scansoriopteryx&quot; was treated as &quot;Epidendrosaurus&quot;. Czerkas described &quot;Omnivoropteryx&quot;, noting that it was similar to &quot;Sapeornis&quot;. Later specimens of &quot;Sapeornis&quot; with skulls demonstrated that the two were probably synonymous.

Another taxon that Czerkas assigned to the Pterosauria and named &quot;Utahdactylus&quot; was reviewed by Dr. Chris Bennett. Bennett found multiple misidentifications of bones and inconsistencies between Czerkas&#x27; diagrams and the actual fossils. Bennett found the specimen to be an indeterminate diapsid and criticized the previous authors for publishing a species name when no diagnostic characters below the class level could be verified. He made &quot;Utahdactylus&quot; a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;.

===Traveling exhibit===
In 2001 Stephen and Sylvia Czerkas compiled a traveling exhibit containing 34 other Chinese fossils. The show is titled &quot;Feathered Dinosaurs and the Origin of Flight&quot;. The San Diego Natural History Museum paid a set fee to the Dinosaur Museum to display this show in 2004. When the show opened, Dr. Ji Qiang told reporters from &quot;Nature&quot; that about a dozen of the fossils had left China illegally. Ji arranged with the Czerkases to assign accession numbers to three of the most valuable specimens, thus formally adding them to the collection of the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences in Beijing, although they remain in the possession of the Czerkases. Stephen Czerkas denied Ji&#x27;s assertion that the fossils were illegal. Sylvia Czerkas told the journal &quot;Nature&quot; that she had worked out an agreement with officials of Liaoning Province in 2001 to borrow the fossils and that they were to be repatriated in 2007. Through March 2009, however, the show was scheduled for the Fresno Metropolitan Museum of Art and Science in California. According to &quot;Nature&quot;, the Czerkases refused requests to make the officials from Liaoning available for an interview.

Many scientists consider it unethical to work on fossils if there is any chance that they have been smuggled, and many disregard privately owned fossils altogether. Some professionals feel that private collectors put fossils in private hands where science may not be able to access or study them. Some believe that private collectors may damage important fossils, subject them to forgery, and obscure their origins or evidence about their ages. Illegal dealers have also participated in and may encourage, governmental corruption. Another philosophy argues that if scientists could bend their ethics and agree to publish on important private fossils, this would encourage private holders to make them available for study.

The fossil most recently appeared in an exhibition in Wollaton Hall, near Nottingham, titled Dinosaurs of China: Ground Shakers to Feathered Flyers, where it was exhibited along with fossils of &quot;Yanoris&quot; and &quot;Microraptor&quot;, its main components.

===Taxonomic history===
In April 2000 Olson published an article in &quot;Backbone&quot;, the newsletter of the National Museum of Natural History. In this article, he justified his views on the evolution of birds, but also revised and redescribed the species &quot;Archaeoraptor liaoningensis&quot; by designating just the tail of the original fraudulent specimen as the type specimen. To prevent the tainted name &quot;Archaeoraptor&quot; from entering paleornithological literature, this redescription assigned the name to that part of the chimeric specimen least likely to be classified under Aves, rather than to the portion which was later shown to represent a true bird species. Olson presumed that the &quot;National Geographic&quot; article had already validly named the fossil, and he, therefore, failed to explicitly indicate the name was new, as demanded by article 16 of the ICZN as a condition for a name to be valid. Several months afterward Xu, Zhou, and Wang published their description of &quot;Microraptor zhaoianus&quot; in &quot;Nature&quot;.

===Creationism===

The scandal is sometimes used by creationists like Kent Hovind, Kirk Cameron, and Ray Comfort to cast doubt on the hypothesis that birds evolved from dinosaurs. Many creationists insist that no missing links between birds and dinosaurs have been found, and commonly point to &quot;Archaeoraptor&quot; as evidence of misconduct performed to support the evolutionary theory. They see &quot;Archaeoraptor&quot; as a &quot;Piltdown Bird&quot;. However, contrary to the Piltdown Man, &quot;Archaeoraptor&quot; was not deliberately fabricated to support some evolutionary claim. Furthermore, the authenticity of &quot;Archaeoraptor&quot; would not have been essential proof for the hypothesis that birds are theropods, as this is sufficiently corroborated by other data; paleontologist Christopher Brochu concluded in November 2001: &quot;That birds are derived from theropod dinosaurs is no longer the subject of scholarly dispute.&quot; Though playing the role of &quot;terrestrial dinosaur&quot; in the &quot;Archaeoraptor&quot; affair, the &quot;Microraptor&quot;, showing wings and clear traces of rectrices, is generally assumed to have had at least a gliding capacity and is itself an excellent example of a transitional fossil.

<doc id="504050" wikidata="Q716908" url="?curid=504050" title="Arval Brethren">
<text>In ancient Roman religion, the Arval Brethren (, &quot;Brothers of the Fields&quot;) or Arval Brothers were a body of priests who offered annual sacrifices to the Lares and gods to guarantee good harvests. Inscriptions provide evidence of their oaths, rituals and sacrifices.

==Origin==
Roman legend held that the priestly college was originated by Romulus, first king of Rome, who took the place of a dead son of his nurse Acca Laurentia, and formed the priesthood with the remaining eleven sons. They were also connected originally with the Sabine priesthood of &quot;Sodales Titii&quot; who were probably originally their counterpart among the Sabines. Thus, it can be inferred that they existed before the founding of the city. There is further proof of the high antiquity of the college in the verbal forms of the song with which, down to late times, a part of the ceremonies was accompanied, and which is still preserved. They persisted to the imperial period.

==Structure and duties==

The Arval Brethren formed a college of twelve priests, although archaeologists have found only up to nine names at a time in the inscriptions. They were appointed for life and did not lose their status even in exile. According to Pliny the Elder, their sign was a white band with the chaplet of sheaves of grain (&quot;Naturalis Historia&quot; 18.2).

The Brethren assembled in the Regia. Their task was the worship of Dea Dia, an old fertility goddess, possibly an aspect of Maia or Ceres. On the three days of her May festival, they offered sacrifices and chanted secretly the &quot;Carmen Arvale&quot; inside the temple of the goddess, at her &quot;lucus&quot;. The &quot;magister&quot; (master) of the college selected the exact three days of the celebration by an unknown method.

The celebration began in Rome on the first day, was transferred to a sacred grove outside the city wall on the second day and ended back in the city on the third day. Their duties included ritual propitiations or thanksgivings such as the &quot;Ambarvalia&quot;, the sacrifices done at the borders of Rome at the fifth mile of the &quot;Via Campana&quot; or the &quot;Salaria&quot; (a place now on the hill Monte delle Piche at Magliana Vecchia on the right bank of the Tiber). Before the sacrifice, the sacrificial victim was led three times around a grain field where a chorus of farmers and farm-servants danced and sang praises for Ceres and offered her libations of milk, honey and wine.

Archaic traits of the rituals included the prohibition of the use of iron, the use of the &quot;olla terrea&quot; (a jar made of unbaked earth) and of the sacrificial burner of Dea Dia made of silver and adorned with grassy clods.
==Restoration of the priesthood==
The importance of Arval Brethren apparently dwindled during the Roman Republic, but emperor Augustus revived their practices to enforce his own authority. In his time the college consisted of a master (&quot;magister&quot;), a vice-master (&quot;promagister&quot;), a priest (&quot;flamen&quot;), and a &quot;praetor&quot;, with eight ordinary members, attended by various servants, and in particular by four chorus boys, sons of senators, having both parents alive. Each wore a wreath of corn, a white fillet and the &quot;toga praetexta&quot;. The election of members was by co-optation on the motion of the president, who, with a flamen, was himself elected for one year.

After Augustus&#x27; time emperors and senators frequented the festivities. At least two emperors, Marcus Aurelius and Elagabalus, were formally accepted as members of the Brethren. The first full descriptions of their rituals also originate from this time.

It is clear that, while the members were themselves always persons of distinction, the duties of their office were held in high respect. And yet no mention of them occurs in the writings of Cicero or Livy, and literary allusions to them are very scarce. On the other hand, we possess a long series of the &quot;acta&quot; or minutes of their proceedings, drawn up by themselves, and inscribed on stone. Excavations, commenced in the 16th century and continued to the 19th, in the grove of the Dea Dia, yielded 96 of these records from 14 to 241 AD. The last inscriptions &quot;(Acta Arvalia)&quot; about the Arval Brethren date from about 325 AD. They were abolished along with Rome&#x27;s other traditional priesthoods by 400 AD.

<text>Cape May consists of a peninsula and barrier island system in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is roughly coterminous with Cape May County and runs southwards from the New Jersey mainland, separating Delaware Bay from the Atlantic Ocean. The southernmost point in both New Jersey and the northeastern United States lies on the cape. A number of resort communities line the Atlantic side of the cape, including Ocean City, the most populous community on the cape, The Wildwoods, known for its architecturally significant hotel district, and the city of Cape May, which has served as a resort community since the mid-1700s, making it the oldest such resort in the U.S.

==Etymology==
The peninsula is named for Cornelius Jacobsen May, a Dutch explorer who worked for the Dutch East India Company.

==Geography and ecology==

The peninsula comprises the municipalities of Avalon, Cape May, Cape May Point, Dennis Township, Lower Township, Middle Township, North Cape May, North Wildwood, Stone Harbor, West Cape May, West Wildwood, and Wildwood Crest. The region is a popular destination for Québécois tourists. It is part of the Southern Shore Region.

The city of Cape May, located on the island and south of the peninsula, is home to the oldest seaside resort in the nation with historical roots dating back to the 18th century. The entire city was designated as a National Historic Landmark on May 11, 1976, and many of the buildings throughout the town are original Victorian structures that have been maintained in pristine condition. The basic training camp of the United States Coast Guard is located in Cape May. This facility is the only enlisted basic training center for the United States Coast Guard in the country. Each recruit goes through eight weeks of training before being shipped out.

Cape May is also famous as one of the top birding sites in North America. There are many different parks and birding sites in the area. Due to its location at the southern tip of New Jersey and numerous nature preserves and wildlife refuges, large concentrations of birds can be found in Cape May, especially during spring and fall migration. Cape May Bird Observatory acts as the central coordinator of birding activities in Cape May, including the World Series of Birding, held in Cape May and throughout New Jersey annually in May.

===Cape Island===

Cape Island is a man-made island at the southern tip of Cape May County, which consists of Cape May, Cape May Point, West Cape May and portions of Lower Township. The island is separated from the mainland and the rest of Cape May County by the man-made Cape May Canal, Cape Island Creek and Cape May Harbor, which cut it off from the rest of the Cape May Peninsula. Cape May Canal is a waterway connecting Cape May Harbor to the Delaware Bay, at the southern tip of Cape May County, New Jersey. Before the canal was built, &quot;Cape Island&quot; referred to the site of the City of Cape May, southeast of Cape Island Creek, a tidal &quot;creek&quot; and marsh that has been partly filled in at its southern end.

==History==
The Kechemeche tribe of the Lenni Lenape were the first residents of the area that historians know of. Each summer, the Native Americans vacationed at what is now Cape May to escape the summer heat. While there, they fished, hunted, and collected fruits before the advent of autumn mandated the return to their inland villages.

The first European to catch a glimpse of Cape May was navigator Henry Hudson and 18 of his crew mates on the Halve Maen. On August 28, 1609, while searching for the Northwest Passage, Hudson decided to sail up the unexplored Delaware Bay. Several miles up the coast, strong tides pulled the Halve Maen to a sandbar, and the crew was stranded until thunderstorms and wind aided the ship around the Cape May peninsula. This event was recorded by Hudson&#x27;s first mate, Robert Juet.

News of his discovery sparked a search for the location of a new trading post. English explorer Samuel Argall explored the bay and named it for the governor of the Virginia Colony, Lord De La Warr. Not to be outdone, the Dutch also sent some navigators to look for suitable sites for trading ventures. Among the band of explorers were Cornelis Henderson, Adriaen Block, and Cornelis Jacobsen Mey.

The recorded history of Cape May stretches back to 1620, when Captain Cornelius Jacobsen Mey surveyed and named the area for himself. It later grew from a small settlement to the large beach resort it has been since the 19th century. The City of Cape May asserts that its status as a vacation spot began in 1766, with Philadelphians coming in by stagecoaches, ships, and horse-drawn wagons, and that the Kechemeche Lenape had primarily used the land for hunting beforehand. Hotels were already on Cape May as of 1834.

In 1782 during the American Revolutionary War, the young Continental Navy Lieutenant Joshua Barney fought with a British squadron at Cape May and Delaware Bay. Barney&#x27;s force of three sloops defeated a Royal Navy frigate, a sloop-of-war and a Loyalist privateer. The battle ended with the loss of two British vessels and one American sloop.

<doc id="504054" wikidata="Q164903" url="?curid=504054" title="Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region">
<text>The Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region () is the largest metropolitan region in Germany, with over ten million inhabitants. A conurbation with several major urban concentrations, the region covers an area of , entirely within the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region spreads from the Ruhr area (Dortmund-Bochum-Essen-Duisburg) in the north to the urban areas of the cities of Mönchengladbach, Düsseldorf (the state capital), Wuppertal, Leverkusen, Cologne (the region&#x27;s largest and Germany&#x27;s fourth largest city), and Bonn in the south. The location of the Rhine-Ruhr at the heart of the European Blue Banana makes it well connected to other major European cities and metropolitan areas such as the Randstad, the Flemish Diamond and the Frankfurt Rhine Main Region.

The metropolitan area is named after the Rhine and Ruhr rivers, which are the region&#x27;s defining geographical features and historically its economic backbone.

==Subdivisions==
The largest cities in the Rhine-Ruhr area are Cologne, with over one million inhabitants, followed by Düsseldorf, Dortmund and Essen, each of which has slightly more than 580,000.

Many unofficial compositions of the Rhine-Ruhr area differ from one another, while the officially defined border of the metropolitan area itself comprises Hamm in the east, Mönchengladbach in the west, Bonn in the south, with the small city of Wesel as its northernmost point. The northern border is similar to that of the Ruhr Area.

This first unofficial table here characterizes the Rhine-Ruhr area as comprising three regions, which together constitute an area much larger than officially defined.

Eurostat&#x27;s &quot;Urban Audit&quot; splits the Rhine-Ruhr region into six Larger Urban Zones (LUZ). None of these six Urban Zones includes the cities of Remscheid and Solingen or the district of Rhein-Kreis Neuss.

==Economy==

Historically, most of the Ruhr area was for the most part characterized by heavy industry since the age of industrialisation in the late 19th and early 20th century. Since the Middle Ages, Cologne, Dortmund, and other cities were important regional trading cities, but during the 19th century the city of Düsseldorf grew to become the administrative center of the region and since 1945, its political capital.

Today, the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region accounts for roughly 15% of the GDP of the German economy, which would place it as the 2nd largest metropolitan area GDP in the European Union after the Paris region. Despite this size, the Rhine-Ruhr region as a whole often lacks international competitiveness because it lacks a unified presentation. Cities and urban areas within it often pursue separate investment policies against each other.

From within, Düsseldorf, Essen, and Cologne are by far the largest economic centers, with specialisation in financial/high tech and insurance/multi media services respectively. Other major economic centers are Bonn and Dortmund. The region is home to twelve Fortune Global 500 companies, among them E.ON AG (Essen), Deutsche Post AG (Bonn), Metro AG (Düsseldorf), Deutsche Telekom AG (Bonn), ThyssenKrupp AG (Essen), RWE AG (Essen), Bayer AG (Leverkusen), Franz Haniel &amp; Cie. GmbH (Duisburg), Evonik Industries (Essen), Hochtief AG, (Essen), and the Henkel Group, (Düsseldorf).

==Climate==
The Rhine-Ruhr area&#x27;s climate is characterized by having the warmest winters in Germany, especially its western part at the Lower Rhine area. Classified by Köppen-Geiger climate classification to be oceanic (Cfb).




==Transportation==
===Air===
The area has four international commercial airports, and several smaller aerodromes for general aviation.
===Road===
The network of Autobahns in North Rhine-Westphalia is the most dense in all of Germany.

===Public transport===
The rail, S-Bahn, U-Bahn and bus companies are administered through a consortium of local and regional transport lines, the &quot;Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr&quot;. It offers a rapid transit system which interconnects all cities and their respective local buses, trams, U- and S-Bahn systems, partly under the umbrella of Deutsche Bahn. Their systems are highly integrated where even some subway lines continue from one city to the next (for example between Düsseldorf and Duisburg or Bochum and Herne, which is unique in Germany, as the city border is crossed underground). The region is divided into several urban zones and fares are paid according to the amount of urban areas (or zones) passed through. Tickets include door to door transportation with all forms covered in one ticket with the exception of high speed rail (which only stops in the major cities). Some excursions, theatre and opera tickets as well as museums offer free transportation from any point in the Rhine Ruhr area to the venue and return.

===Waterways===
Duisburg Inner Harbour (Duisport) and Dortmund Port are large industrial inland ports and serve as hubs along the Rhine and the German inland water transport system.

==Tourism==
===Events===

The region is host to numerous large events, comprising fun fairs and cultural events like the Cologne and Düsseldorf carnivals (carnival is however a public event in almost all cities and towns of the area), the Cologne Comedy Festival, Ruhrfestspiele Recklinghausen, and the RuhrTriennale, as well as Gamescom and other trade fairs at Koelnmesse—Cologne Trade Fair and Messe Düsseldorf; and Essen Motor Show in Essen. With a capacity of up to 20,000 people, the Lanxess Arena and Westfalenhallen are amongst the largest indoor arenas in Germany.

The region is home to a total of 13 Bundesliga football clubs, of which five are active in the season of 2017–18. The most successful among them are Borussia Dortmund, Borussia Mönchengladbach, 1. FC Köln, FC Schalke 04 and Bayer 04 Leverkusen. The Revierderby is the rivalry between Borussia Dortmund and Schalke 04, one of the most significant in German football. Westfalenstadion, the stadium of Borussia Dortmund, is the biggest stadium in Germany. The area had plans to bid for the 2032 Summer Olympics, before the IOC declared Brisbane to be the host.

===Landmarks===

Several tourist destinations within the region attract over 12 million tourists per year. Cologne Cathedral, Augustusburg and Falkenlust Palaces at Brühl and the Zollverein Coal Mine Industrial Complex at Essen are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Other sights include Schloss Benrath in Düsseldorf and several anchor points of the European Route of Industrial Heritage.

===Museums===
NRW Forum, Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen, Kunsthalle Düsseldorf, Museum Koenig, Museum Ludwig, Romano-Germanic Museum, Wallraf-Richartz Museum, Neanderthal Museum, Museum Folkwang, Museum Ostwall, Lehmbruck Museum, German Mining Museum and Deutsches Museum Bonn are some of the most famous examples.

==Education==
The Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region is home to nine universities and over 30 partly postgraduate colleges, with a total of over 300.000 students. The largest and oldest university is the University of Cologne &quot;(Universität zu Köln)&quot;, founded in 1388 AD. Other universities include:
* the Ruhr University Bochum,
* the University of Bonn,
* the German Sport University Cologne,
* the Technical University of Dortmund,
* the University of Duisburg-Essen,
* the University of Düsseldorf,
* the FernUniversität Hagen and
* the University of Wuppertal.

==Municipalities==




The following register lists all municipalities that officially belong to Rhine-Ruhr area. Demographically, these municipalities include 20 cities (German: ) each with more than 100,000 inhabitants, and 11 districts (German: ), each with a population of more than 250,000 inhabitants. Some districts only belong partly to Rhine-Ruhr area. In such a case only the municipalities that belong to the metro area are listed.

<text>Cité () is a metro station on Line 4 of the Paris Métro in the 4th arrondissement of Paris.

==Location==
Cité station lies underneath the Île de la Cité, one of two islands on the Seine within the historical boundaries of Paris. In relation to the rest of the city, it lies within the 4th arrondissement, near Kilometre Zero, the official geographical and historical centre of Paris. The only station on the Île de la Cité, it lies near many famous landmarks, the most famous being the Notre-Dame de Paris (Cathedral of Notre Dame). To the west are the Sainte-Chapelle chapel and the Palace of Justice, while Notre Dame and the Hôtel-Dieu are to the east.

==History==
The station was opened on 10 December 1910 on the section of the line under the Seine between Châtelet and Raspail. This section of the line had actually opened on 9 January 1910 but trains passed through the station without stopping until the December of that year. On 16 January it was completely submerged by the 1910 Great Flood of Paris.

It owes its name to its location under Île de la Cité, considered the ancient cradle of the city of Paris, formerly Lutetia. The name &quot;Cité&quot; refers to the fortified boundaries of Paris as they were at the end of antiquity, on the island, and which was the urban nucleus of the medieval city.

The station is also, with &quot;Rome&quot; on Line 2, &quot;Iéna&quot; on Line 9 as well as the &quot;Haxo&quot; ghost station between the 3 bis and 7 bis lines, one of the four whose name consists of four letters.

Along with the nearby Saint-Michel metro station, it was one of two stopping points equipped in 1911 with an elevator connecting the distribution room to the platforms, the other, the République metro station, which was the first in the network to benefit from it in 1910.

Tunnels were later built linking the station to the nearby Prefecture of Police of Paris and the Palais de Justice which were about 100 metres from the current entrance. These undergrounds were used in particular to escape the Germans during the Second World War. However, for security reasons, these tunnels have now been closed for more than thirty years.

The platforms were modernized after 1988 by the adoption of a particular variation of the &quot;Ouï-dire&quot; style, in this case green, characterized by globe candelabra lighting. As part of the RATP&#x27;s &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; programme, the station corridors were renovated on 20 December 2012.

On 9 October 2019, half of the nameplates on the station&#x27;s platforms were temporarily replaced by the RATP to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Asterix and Obelix, as in eleven other stations. Taking the characteristic typography of the comic strip of René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo, Cité is humorously renamed &quot;Lutèce&quot;, a French-language form of the name used by the Romans to refer to Paris.

In 2019, according to RATP estimates, the station&#x27;s annual travellers was 1,740,572 passengers, placing it 264th in the number of metro stations out of 302.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has a single entrance entitled &quot;Place Louis Lépine&quot;, leading to the right of building, 2 Place Louis Lépine. Consisting of a fixed staircase, it is decorated with a Guimard edicule, which is the subject of an inscription under the title of historical monuments by the decree of 25 July 1965.

The old exit, still visible, gave direct access to the police prefecture and the courthouse (Palais de Justice) in the &quot;Cour du Mai&quot; to the right of the monumental gate as one enters.

Access to the platforms is via fixed stairs or elevators.

===Station layout===


===Platforms===
Similar to most Paris Métro stations, Cité utilises a side platform setup with two tracks. However, unlike other stations on Line 4, the platforms are in length, longer than the 90-105m platforms at other stations. This makes it possible for the station to handle seven-car trains. Saint-Michel station, immediately after Cité, has even longer platforms measuring (making it possible to handle eight-car trains). However, due to the length of other station platforms and the automation process on Line 4, the train length will be limited to six cars.

Because of the station&#x27;s depth, passengers must walk down to a mezzanine level, which contains ticket machines and fare control gates, and then another three flights of stairs before reaching the platform level. As the Paris Métro runs inversely to normal railways in the rest of France, the eastern track is used by trains heading northbound to Porte de Clignancourt and the western southbound to Montrouge.

===Bus connections===
The station area is served by lines 21, 27, 38, 47, 58, 85, 96 and the Paris L&#x27;OpenTour tourist line of the RATP Bus Network and at night, by the N12, N13, N14, N15, N21 and N22 lines of the Noctilien network.

<text>Saint-Michel () is a station on Line 4 of the Paris Métro in the 5th arrondissement. Located in the Quartier Latin, it offers a connection to the St-Michel - Notre-Dame RER station on RER lines B and C.

The station was opened on 9 January 1910 as part of the connecting section of the line under the Seine between Châtelet and Raspail. It is named after the Boulevard Saint-Michel.

==Architecture==

Like nearby Cité, Saint-Michel features a pioneering construction technique, made necessary by the proximity of the Seine. The station comprises three steel &quot;caissons&quot; – one for the train hall and two for access at each end – which were assembled at the surface and then lowered into place.

The platforms are 118 metres long, more than the standard length on the network. This allows it to potentially handle eight-car trains, however, due to the other stations having an average of 100-meter platforms (excluding Cité, which has 110-meter platforms), and the Line&#x27;s ongoing process for automatic operations, the trains in the Line 4 will be limited to six-car trains.

<text>Odéon () is a station on lines 4 and 10 of the Paris Métro. It is located in the 6th arrondissement, on the Rive Gauche. It is named after the nearby Odéon-Théâtre de l&#x27;Europe and is located under the Carrefour de l&#x27;Odéon, in the 6th arrondissement of Paris.

==History==
The station was opened on 9 January 1910 as part of the connecting section of line 4 under the Seine between Châtelet and Raspail. It was one of the many stations on line 4 that were flooded during the Great Flood of Paris in 1910, interrupting service for several weeks 

Line 10&#x27;s platforms opened on 14 February 1926 as part of the line&#x27;s extension from Mabillon. It served as its eastern terminus until its extension to Place d&#x27;Italie (now on line 7) on 15 February 1930.

Between October 1966 and October 1967, like most stations on line 4, its platforms were lengthened to 90 metres to cater for six-car trains due to the increased traffic on the line. The walls of the platform were clad in a metal casing to improve the general appearance of the station.

As part of the &quot;Un métro + beau&quot; programme by the RATP, the station&#x27;s corridors, lighting, as well as platforms of line 4 were renovated on 7 October 2008, removing the metal cladding on the platforms of line 4.

As part of the automation of line 4, the platforms of line 4 were partially renovated and modernised. Its platform levels were raised to accommodate the installation of platform screen doors which took place from July to August 2019. This was in addition to new lighting being installed, tiling the floor, and the installation of new seats.

In 2019, the station was used by 5,600,764 passengers, making it the 70th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 2,412,888 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 91st busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 3,478,491 passengers, making it the 80th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

<text>Saint-Germain-des-Prés () is a station on line 4 of the Paris Métro. It serves the Saint-Germain-des-Prés neighbourhood on the Rive Gauche in the 6th arrondissement.

It is named after Place Saint-Germain and the Church of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, dedicated on 23 December 558 by the son of Clovis, Childebert I (ruled 511–558), at the request of St. Germain, Bishop of Paris. Childebert died the same day and was buried in it. More than a thousand years later the remains of the philosopher René Descartes were also buried in it. The expression &quot;des-Prés&quot; refers to the &quot;Prés aux Clercs&quot; (&quot;fields of the scholars&quot;) used for the erection of buildings to house the University of Paris.

Although the station is in close proximity to Mabillon on line 10 (less than 100 metres away), there is no free transfer between the two stations.

==History==
The station was opened on 9 January 1910 as part of the connecting section of the line under the Seine between Châtelet and Raspail.

Since the métro&#x27;s centenary in 2000 and until 2016, the station&#x27;s platforms have had numerous temporary exhibitions on the history literature in the neighbourhood. The platforms also had displays that presented the stories of young literary talents.

As part of the automation of line 4, the platforms of line 4 were partially renovated and modernised. Its platform levels were raised to accommodate the installation of platform screen doors which took place from February to May 2019. This was in addition to new lighting being installed, tiling the floor, and the installation of new seats.

In the spring of 2021, a cultural fresco, &quot;Le Mythe Saint-Germain: un lexique amoureux&quot; (The legend of Saint-Germain: an A to Z of love), was installed on the walls of the platforms. It features several portraits and anecdotes of renowned people who had lived in the vicinity in the past: Boris Vian, Jacques Prévert, Marguerite Duras, Amélie Nothomb, Roland Topor, Juliette Gréco, and Sonia Delaunay. It illustrates a unique neighbourhood that is literary, stylish, creative, and full of culture. It is planned to update the gallery over the years, each time adding an additional 10 new portraits. Several other works of art are also installed in the station: &quot;Les Messagers&quot;, a bronze sculpture by Gualtiero Busato and a mosaic by André Ropion paying homage to Johannes Gutenberg.

In 2019, the station was used by 3,866,889 passengers, making it the 126th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 1,712,923 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 144th busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 2,378,860 passengers, making it the 142nd busiest of the Métro network out of 304 stations.

<text>Gideon Force was a small British and African special force, a with the Sudan Defence Force, Ethiopian regular forces and ( for Patriots). Gideon Force fought the Italian occupation in Ethiopia, during the East African Campaign of the Second World War. The leader and creator of the force was Major (later Colonel) Orde Wingate. At its peak, Gideon Force had fifty officers, twenty British NCOs, 800 trained Sudanese troops and 800 part-trained Ethiopian regulars, a few mortars but no artillery and no air support, except for intermittent bombing sorties.

The force operated in difficult country at the end of a long, tenuous supply-line, on which perished nearly all of the used as beasts of burden. Gideon Force and the ejected the Italian forces commanded in Ethiopia by General Guglielmo Nasi (the conqueror of British Somaliland). The campaign took six weeks; and troops were captured along with twelve guns, many machine-guns, rifles, much ammunition and over animals. Gideon Force was disbanded on 1 June 1941, Wingate resumed this substantive rank of Major and returned to Egypt, as did many of the troops of Gideon Force, who joined the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) in the Eighth Army.

==Background==

===Italian East Africa===
During the First Italo-Abyssinian War (1895–1896), the Royal Italian Army () had been defeated by the forces of Emperor Menelik II of Ethiopia at the Battle of Adowa. During the Second Italo-Abyssinian War in October 1935, the Italians invaded Ethiopia from Italian Somaliland and Eritrea. On 9 May 1936, the Italian dictator, Benito Mussolini, proclaimed Italian East Africa (, AOI), formed from the newly conquered Ethiopia and the colonies of Italian Eritrea and Italian Somaliland. On 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war on Britain and France, making the AOI a threat to the British supply route along the Red Sea and the Suez Canal. The Kingdom of Egypt remained neutral during the war but the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 allowed the British to occupy Egypt to defend the Suez Canal. Egypt included the Sudan as a condominium known as Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. Egypt, the Suez Canal, French Somaliland and British Somaliland were vulnerable to an Italian invasion but Mussolini looked forward to propaganda triumphs in the Sudan and British East Africa (Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda). (the Italian General Staff) had planned for a war after 1942 and in the summer of 1940 was not prepared for a long war or the occupation large parts of Africa.

===Middle East Command===
The British had based forces in Egypt since 1882 but these were greatly reduced by the terms of the treaty of 1936. A small British and Commonwealth force garrisoned the Suez Canal and the Red Sea route, which was vital to British communications with its Indian Ocean and Far Eastern territories. In mid-1939, Lieutenant-General Archibald Wavell was appointed General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC-in-C) of the new Middle East Command, over the Mediterranean and Middle East. Until the Franco–German Armistice of 22 June 1940, French divisions in Tunisia faced the Italian 5th Army on the western Libyan border. In Libya, the Italian Army had about and in Egypt, the British had about with another training in Palestine. Wavell had about at his disposal for Libya, Iraq, Syria, Iran and East Africa, whose frontiers were guarded by an average of about eight men to .

Wavell resolved to conduct the delaying actions recommended in &quot;Operations against Italian East Africa&quot; by his Operations Section of August 1940. Pressure was to be maintained everywhere to make the Italians exhaust their resources, a limited offensive in Sudan was to be conducted at Kassala and an advance was to be made on Kisimayu by January or February 1941. The Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden convened a conference in Khartoum at the end of October 1940, with the Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie and others. Attempts would be made to encourage unrest among local civilians, particularly in Ethiopia, where Mission 101 had crossed the frontier on 12 August and the inclusion Ethiopian irregular forces was agreed upon at the conference. In November 1940, the British and Commonwealth forces gained an intelligence advantage when the Government Code and Cypher School (GC &amp; CS) at Bletchley Park broke the high grade cypher of the in East Africa. Later that month, the replacement cypher for the Italian Air Force () was broken by the Combined Bureau, Middle East (CBME).

====Mission 101====
In August 1939, Wavell had ordered a plan covertly to encourage the rebellion in the western Ethiopian province of Gojjam, that the Italians had never been able to repress. In September, Colonel Daniel Sandford arrived to run the project but until the Italian declaration of war, the conspiracy was held back by the policy of appeasement. Mission 101 (named after the No. 101 fuze) was a force composed of British, Sudanese and Ethiopian soldiers formed to co-ordinate the activities of the Ethiopian resistance. In June 1940, Selassie arrived in Egypt and in July, went to Sudan to meet Platt and discuss plans to re-capture Ethiopia, despite Platt&#x27;s reservations.

In July, the British recognised Selassie as emperor and in August, Mission 101 entered Gojjam province to reconnoitre. Sandford requested that supply routes be established before the rains ended, to the area north of Lake Tana and that Selassie should return in October, as a catalyst for the uprising. Gaining control of Gojjam required the Italian garrisons to be isolated along the main road from Bahrdar Giorgis south of Lake Tana, to Dangila, Debre Marqos and Addis Ababa, to prevent them concentrating against the . Italian reinforcements arrived in October and patrolled more frequently, just as dissensions among local potentates were reconciled by Sandford&#x27;s diplomacy.

The Frontier Battalion of the Sudan Defence Force, established in May 1940, was joined at Khartoum by the 2nd Ethiopian and 4th Eritrean battalions, raised from émigré volunteers in Kenya. Operational Centres of an officer, five NCOs and several Ethiopian troops, were formed and trained in guerrilla warfare, to provide leadership cadres; £1 million was set aside to finance operations. Major Orde Wingate was sent to Khartoum with an assistant to join the HQ of the SDF. On 20 November, Wingate was flown to Sakhala to meet Sandford and the RAF managed to bomb Dangila, drop propaganda leaflets and supply Mission 101, which raised Ethiopian morale, having suffered much from Italian air power since the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. Mission 101 managed to persuade the north of Lake Tana to spring several ambushes on the Metemma–Gondar road and the Italian garrison at Wolkait was withdrawn in February 1941.

==Prelude==

===British plans, Gideon Force===

Platt planned to take a stronghold in Gojjam, install Selassie and then expand the revolt. The Frontier Battalion was to capture Belaya, over the border as an advanced base for the Operational Centres moving into the province. Sandford was to send recruits to Belaya and collect to add to camels from Sudan for transport and Selassie was to move to Belaya as soon as possible. The Italians retaliated by returning Ras Hailu to Gojjam, where he had great prestige, to weaken the . By January 1941, the Frontier Battalion had made two routes to Belaya and delivered stores but Sandford had failed to provide the mules, thought essential for climbing the escarpment if camels proved unsuitable. Only two Operational Centres were ready and Ethiopian nobles had been reluctant to provide recruits. On 21 January, just after the Italian retirement from Kassala, Selassie crossed into Ethiopia and reached Belaya. Sandford was promoted to act as liaison between Selassie, Wavell, Platt and Cunningham, Wingate took over Mission 101 and in February, the Frontier Battalion SDF, 2nd Ethiopian Battalion and Nos 1 and 2 Operational Centres, were renamed Gideon Force. Wingate was ordered to capture Dangila and Bure, which had garrisons of a colonial brigade each and gain control of the road to Bahrdar Giorgis, to provide a base for Selassie. The were to attack the main roads from Gondar and Addis Ababa and keep as many Italian troops back defending Addis Ababa as possible.

==Battle==

===Gojjam province===
After Italian defeats in the Balkans and North Africa, exaggerated reports of British and Ethiopian troops operating from Sudan and increasing hostility from the Ethiopian population, a retirement by the Italians from western Gojjam, to Bahrdar Giorgis and Debre Marqos appeared imminent. A retreat would free the road needed by Gideon Force and on 19 February, the force reached Matakal, by a route which was found passable by the camel trains. Selassie and Gideon Force rallied , using loudspeakers to announce the presence of the emperor and induce local notables and Italian Askari to desert. The Dangila garrison had retreated towards Bahrdar Giorgis and Wingate ordered that the remaining garrisons on the road were to be eliminated using guerrilla tactics to magnify the threat perceived by the defenders.

From 27 February to 3 March, Gideon Force harassed the forts at Bure, while propagandists talking through megaphones, fostered the belief that the Italians were being attacked by a substantial force, rather than provoking many desertions. On 4 March, fearing that the road to Debre Marqos was threatened Natale retreated for Dembacha on the Debre Marqos road. Pursued by the Frontier Battalion, the Italians ran into the 2nd Ethiopian Battalion west of Dembacha and was overrun after a determined defence, suffering about four guns and a quantity of vehicles and supplies. The 2nd Ethiopian Battalion lost and many pack animals, reducing it to the size of a company. The west end of the Gojjam road was freed and Selassie entered Bure on 14 March. The most westerly Italian positions were now at the Debre Marqos forts, which Wingate besieged with the Frontier Battalion and moved the rest of Gideon Force towards the Blue Nile.

Ras Hailu, with several thousand followers appeared, joining the Italians at Debre Marqos, by when Nasi realised that the size of Gideon Force had been exaggerated. Colonel Natale at Markos was sacked and replaced by Colonel Maraventano. Nasi announced that Bure would be reoccupied; re-took Fort Emmanuel and attacked the force at Bahrdar Giorgis. Wingate could retire on his communications towards Bure or attack boldly against the much superior Italian force and chose to go on the offensive. Guerilla attacks were made at night after careful preparation and needed great skill, discipline and dash from the Sudanese troops involved. In the middle of the night, parties of about fifty men crept to within of a post and attacked with grenades and bayonets. By early April, the defenders had been forced back to the inner defensive ring of Debre Marqos. Aosta ordered a withdrawal and on 4 April, (including ), began a trek to Safartak and then on to Dessie. The attack on Bahrdar Giorgis by Colonel Adriano Torelli, with five infantry battalions with pack artillery also failed. Selassie entered Debre Marqos on 6 April, the same day that Addis Ababa was captured from the south. The British successes in Eritrea, Italian Somaliland and Southern Ethiopia transformed the strategic outlook. British policy became one of re-installing Selassie and mobilising Ethiopian military potential to participate in the reduction of the remaining Italian garrisons.
Wingate arranged for Lij Belay Zeleke to block a route of retreat from Debre Marqos over the Blue Nile, assisted by Bimbashi Wilfred Thesiger and Captain Foley, with a platoon of the Ethiopian Battalion. Zaleka apparently intrigued with Ras Hailu, remained passive and the Italians got across the Blue Nile, heading for Addis Deraa. Three platoons of the Frontier Battalion and one from the Ethiopian Battalion pursued, despite running out of supplies and ammunition. At the end of April, two Operational Centres arrived to encourage the and command was taken by Major D. H. Nott of Mission 101. The local population remained reluctant to participate but by guile and bluff, the pursuers kept the Italians disorganised as they ascended the escarpment before Addis Deraa.

An Italian counter-attack was repulsed and a counter-raid inspired the civilian population to help and donate food. On 15 May, Wingate arrived from Addis Ababa on the night that the Italians retreated towards Agibar and the Debra Tabor–Gondar road. Wingate took no notice of orders calling him away and sent part of the force to cut off the Italians, as the main force with another 300 (Amharic for Patriots) who had arrived, continued the pursuit. On 19 May, Wingate called on Maraventano to surrender, who refused but undertook to consult with HQ by wireless. The Italians attempted another counter-attack and Wingate claimed that his troops were going to leave and that only the would remain. The ruse worked and Maraventano surrendered with and troops.

Gideon Force received new orders to cut roads over a wide area to stop the Italians at Amba Alagi, Gondar, Dessie (and Jimma to the south-west) from uniting. Two Operational Centres were sent to Begemdir, east of Lake Tana, to cut the main road through Debra Tabor. The centres managed to spring several ambushes, recruited many more and kept the Italians inside their fortifications. In late April, the company of the Frontier Battalion at Bahrdar Giorgis repulsed an attack and soon afterwards the Italians retreated along the east side of Lake Tana. Part of the Frontier Battalion remained to watch over Ras Hailu and then went with Selassie to Addis Ababa, joining the 1st South African Brigade advance to Asmara. The rest of the battalion advanced north from Debre Marqos to Lake Tana (in summer uniforms over a pass in a blizzard), got to Mota and by an audacious bluff persuaded the last Italian battalion in Gojjam to surrender. On 5 May, Platt handed command of Gideon Force and operations beyond the curve of the Blue Nile to Cunningham, commander on the Southern Front, where the East African Force had invaded Ethiopia from Italian Somaliland.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===

At its peak, Gideon Force had fifty officers, twenty British NCOs, Sudanese troops and trained Ethiopian regulars, a few mortars but no artillery and no air support, except for intermittent bombing sorties. The force operated in difficult country at the end of a long and tenuous supply-line, on which nearly all of the perished. Assisted by the , Gideon Force ejected the Italian forces under Nasi in six weeks and captured and troops, twelve guns, many machine-guns, rifles, ammunition and over animals.

===Subsequent events===
Gideon Force was disbanded on 1 June 1941, Wingate was demoted to Major and returned to Egypt along with many of the troops of Gideon Force, who joined the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) of the Eighth Army. Wingate&#x27;s request for decorations for his men was ignored and his attempts to get back-pay for them was obstructed. Wingate wrote a report on 18 June, to Wavell, in which he outlined the successes of the campaign and his views on future actions of a similar type,

Wavell rebuked Wingate for the language of the report and undertook to look into the grievances but was sacked and posted to India soon after. Wingate languished in Cairo, came down with malaria and was sent back to Britain by troop ship, much to the relief of the general staff in Cairo, who had feared that he would meddle in the post-war politics of Ethiopia.

<doc id="504067" wikidata="Q763411" url="?curid=504067" title="Saint-Placide station">
<text>Saint-Placide () is a station on Line 4 of the Paris Métro. Situated in the 6th arrondissement, it was used by 3,376,988 passengers in 2018, making it the 163rd busiest Métro station out of 302.

==Location==
The station is located under the Rue de Rennes at the intersection with the Rue de Vaugirard. Oriented approximately along a north–south axis, it is located between Saint-Sulpice and Montparnasse – Bienvenue, while being very close geographically to Rennes on Line 12.

==History==

The station was opened on 9 January 1910 as part of the connecting section of the line under the Seine between Châtelet and Raspail. The station, in the Montparnasse area, is after Rue Saint-Placide, commemorating Saint Placidus. It was opened on 9 January 1910 under the name of Vaugirard, but its name was changed on 15 November 1913 to avoid confusion with the Nord-Sud Company&#x27;s Vaugirard, now on Line 12.

Like most of the stations on Line 4, between October 1966 and October 1967, the platforms were extended to 90 metres in order to accommodate trains of six cars to cope with significant chronic overcrowding as well as the pneumatization of the said line. As part of the RATP &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; program, the station corridors and platform lighting were renovated on 24 May 2005.

From 2017, the platforms were undergoing a partial modernisation as part of the automation of Line 4, including their elevation to accommodate platform screen doors, which were installed from August to September 2019.
==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has a main entrance as well as a secondary exit:
* Entrance 1: Rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs, consisting of a fixed staircase decorated with a Val d&#x27;Osne candelabra, located at the right of number 127 of the Rue de Rennes, at the corner with Rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs;
* Entrance 2: Rue de Rennes, consisting of an escalator allowing only an exit from the platform in the direction of Mairie de Montrouge, leading to front of number 120 of the Rue de Rennes.

===Station layout===


===Platforms===
Saint-Placide is a standard configuration station. It has two platforms separated by the metro tracks and the arch is elliptical.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by lines 39, 89, 94, 95 and 96 of the RATP Bus Network as well as, at night, by lines N01, N02, N12 and N13 of the Noctilien network.

==Nearby==
* Rue de Rennes: the station serves the southern part of this shopping street in the 6th arrondissement.
* Institut Catholique de Paris: the station is relatively close to the establishment, located at 21 Rue d&#x27;Assas.

<doc id="504068" wikidata="Q738808" url="?curid=504068" title="Delaware Bay">
<text>Delaware Bay is the estuary outlet of the Delaware River on the northeast seaboard of the United States, lying between the states of Delaware and New Jersey. It is approximately in area, the bay&#x27;s freshwater mixes for many miles with the saltwater of the Atlantic Ocean.

The bay is bordered inland by the states of Delaware and New Jersey, and its mouth is framed by Cape Henlopen in Delaware and Cape May in New Jersey, on the Atlantic. Delaware Bay is bordered by six counties: Sussex, Kent, and New Castle in Delaware, and Cape May, Cumberland, and Salem in New Jersey. The Cape May–Lewes Ferry crosses Delaware Bay from North Cape May, New Jersey, to Lewes, Delaware. The bay&#x27;s ports are managed by the Delaware River and Bay Authority.

The shores of the bay are largely composed of salt marshes and mudflats, with only small communities inhabiting the shore of the lower bay. Several of the rivers hold protected status for their salt marsh wetlands bordering the bay, which serves as a breeding ground for many aquatic species, including horseshoe crabs. The bay is also a prime oystering ground.

Delaware Bay was designated a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance on May 20, 1992. It was the first site classified in the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network.

==Hydrology==

While the Delaware River is by far the largest tributary of Delaware Bay, numerous smaller rivers and streams also drain to the bay. These include the Appoquinimink River, Leipsic River, Smyrna River, St. Jones River, Mispillion River, Broadkill River and Murderkill Rivers on the Delaware side, and the Salem River, Cohansey River, and Maurice Rivers on the New Jersey side.

==Ecology==

Delaware Bay ecosystem is a key stopover site for over 30 species of migrating shorebirds that migrate north come May. Many birds like red knots use this Bay area to fuel up their energy reserves on horseshoe crab eggs after the long journey. Delaware Bay hosts the largest population of horseshoe crabs in the world.

==History==

At the time of the arrival of the Europeans in the early 17th century, the area around the bay was inhabited by the Native American Lenape people. They called the Delaware River &quot;Lenape Wihittuck&quot;, which means &quot;the rapid stream of the Lenape&quot;. Delaware Bay was called &quot;Poutaxat&quot;, which means &quot;near the falls&quot;.
In 1523, Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón had received from Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor a grant for the land explored in 1521 by Francisco Gordillo and slave trader Captain Pedro de Quejo (de Quexo). Ayllón sent Quejo northward in 1525 and received reports of the coastline from as far north as Delaware Bay. That same year, De Ayllon and Captain Quejo called Delaware Bay by the name &quot;Saint Christopher&#x27;s Bay&quot;. In the 1600s, the bay was known as &quot;Niew Port May&quot; after Captain Cornelius May.

Another recorded European visit to the bay was by Henry Hudson, who claimed it for the Dutch East India Company in 1609. The Dutch called the estuary &quot;Godyns Bay&quot;, or &quot;Godins Bay&quot; after a director of the company, Samuel Godijn. As part of the New Netherland colony, the Dutch established several settlements (the most famous being Zwaanendael) on the shores of the bay and explored its coast extensively. The thin nature of the corporate colony&#x27;s presence in the bay and along what was called the South River (now the Delaware) made it possible for Peter Minuit, the former director of New Netherland, to establish a competing Swedish sponsored settlement, New Sweden in 1638. The resulting dispute with the Dutch colonial authorities in New Amsterdam (New York City) was settled when Petrus Stuyvesant led a Dutch military force into the area in 1655. After the English took title to the New Netherland colony in 1667 at the Treaty of Breda the bay came into their possession and was renamed Delaware Bay, the name given it in 1610 by Samuel Argall, after the then new Governor of Virginia, Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr. The Native American tribe living along the bay and river were later called the Delaware by the Europeans due to their location. The U.S. state also takes its name from the bay and the river.

Conflicting crown grants were made to the James, Duke of York and William Penn on the west bank of the bay and river. Settlement grew rapidly, leading Philadelphia, upriver on the Delaware, to become the largest city in North America in the 18th century. Penn viewed access to Delaware Bay as being so critical to Pennsylvania&#x27;s survival that he engaged in an eighty-year long legal boundary dispute with the Calvert family to secure it. During the French and Indian War the dissemination of Joshua Fisher&#x27;s original publication of the &quot;Chart of Delaware Bay&quot; was restricted by the authorities as its accuracy might advantage an enemy approach. In 1782 during the American Revolutionary War, Continental Navy Lieutenant Joshua Barney fought with a British squadron within the bay. Barney&#x27;s force of three sloops defeated a Royal Navy frigate, a sloop-of-war and a Loyalist privateer.

The strategic importance of the bay was noticed by the Marquis de Lafayette during the American Revolutionary War, who proposed the use of Pea Patch Island at the head of the bay for a defensive fortification to protect the important ports Philadelphia and New Castle, Delaware. Fort Delaware was later constructed on Pea Patch Island. During the American Civil War it was used as a Union prison camp.

In 1855, the United States government systematically undertook the formation of a channel wide from Philadelphia to deep water in Delaware Bay. The Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 provided for a channel wide from Philadelphia to the deep water of the bay. Other names for the bay have been &quot;South Bay&quot; and &quot;Zuyt Baye&quot;.

===Today===
The bay is one of the most important navigational channels in the United States; it is the second busiest waterway after the Mississippi River. Its lower course forms part of the Intracoastal Waterway. The need for direct navigation around the two capes into the ocean is circumvented by the Cape May Canal and the Lewes and Rehoboth Canal at the north and south capes respectively. The upper bay is connected directly to the north end of Chesapeake Bay by the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal.

The U.S Coast Guard sector for Delaware Bay was established in 2005, and has 570 active personnel, and 195 reservists.

<doc id="504072" wikidata="Q6811210" url="?curid=504072" title="Tabular Islamic calendar">
<text>The Tabular Islamic calendar () is a rule-based variation of the Islamic calendar. It has the same numbering of years and months, but the months are determined by arithmetical rules rather than by observation or astronomical calculations. It was developed by early Muslim astronomers of the second hijra century (the 8th century of the Common Era) to provide a predictable time base for calculating the positions of the moon, sun, and planets. It is now used by historians to convert an Islamic date into a Western calendar when no other information (like the day of the week) is available. Its calendar era is the Hijri year. An example is the Fatimid or Misri calendar.

It is used by some Muslims in everyday life, particularly in Ismaili and Shi&#x27;a communities, believing that this calendar was developed by Ali. It is believed that when Ali drew up this calendar, the previous events of the earlier prophets also fell into line with this calendar. It is their belief that all Fatimid Imams and their Da&#x27;is have followed this tradition.

Each year has 12 months. The odd numbered months have 30 days and the even numbered months have 29 days, except in a leap year when the 12th and final month Dhu al-Hijjah has 30 days.

==Intercalary schemes==

=== 30-year cycle ===
In its most common form there are 11 leap years in a 30-year cycle. Noting that the average year has days and a common year has 354 days, at the end of the first year of the 30-year cycle the remainder is day. Whenever the remainder exceeds a half day ( day), then a leap day is added to that year, reducing the remainder by one day. Thus at the end of the second year the remainder would be day which is reduced to − day by a leap day. Using this rule the leap years are year number 2, 5, 7, 10, 13, 16, 18, 21, 24, 26 and 29 of the 30-year cycle.

If leap days are added whenever the remainder &quot;equals&quot; or exceeds a half day, then all leap years are the same except 15 replaces 16 as the sixth long year per cycle.

The Ismaili Tayyebi community delays three leap days by one year: the third to year 8, the seventh to year 19 and the tenth to year 27 in their 30-year cycle.
There is another version where, in addition, the fourth leap day is postponed to year 11 and the last leap day is in the last year of the 30-year cycle.

The mean number of days per month in the 30-year cycle is 29.53056 days, or Six months of 29 days and six with 30 days, plus 11 days of the leap years. (29 days × 6 months + 30 days × 6 months) × 30 years + 11 leap days = 10,631 days and 10,631 / 360 = 29.53056 (360 is number of months in 30 years). And this is approximately how long it takes for the moon to make full lunar cycle. 
Microsoft&#x27;s Kuwaiti algorithm is used in Windows to convert between Gregorian calendar dates and Islamic calendar dates. There is no fixed correspondence defined in advance between the algorithmic Gregorian solar calendar and the Islamic lunar calendar determined by actual observation. As an attempt to make conversions between the calendars somewhat predictable, Microsoft claims to have created this algorithm based on statistical analysis of historical data from Kuwait. According to Rob van Gent, the so-called &quot;Kuwaiti algorithm&quot; is simply an implementation of the standard Tabular Islamic calendar algorithm used in Islamic astronomical tables since the 11th century.


=== 8-year cycle ===
Tabular Islamic calendars based on an 8-year cycle (with 2, 5 and 8 as leap years) were also used in the Ottoman Empire and in South-East Asia. The cycle contains 96 months in 2835 days, giving a mean month length of 29.53125 days, or 29d 12h 45m.

Though less accurate than the tabular calendars based on a 30-year cycle, it was popular due to the fact that in each cycle the weekdays fall on the same calendar date. In other words, the 8-year cycle is exactly 405 weeks long, resulting in a mean of exactly 4.21875 weeks per month.

=== 120-year cycle ===
In the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) into the early 20th century, the 8-year cycle was reset every 120 years by omitting the intercalary day at the end of the last year, thus resulting in a mean month length equal with that used in the 30-year cycles.

<doc id="504073" wikidata="Q764465" url="?curid=504073" title="Montparnasse–Bienvenüe station">
<text>Montparnasse–Bienvenüe station () is a station of the Paris Métro which is a transfer point between Line 4, Line 6, Line 12 and Line 13. The fourth busiest station on the Métro system as of 2019 with 29.9 million riders, it is located in Montparnasse at the intersection of the 6th, 14th and 15th arrondissements.

== Location ==
The stations of Lines 4 and 12 are located to the north under the Boulevard du Montparnasse while those of Lines 6 and 13 are south under Boulevard de Vaugirard and Avenue du Maine respectively.

== History ==

On 24 April 1906 the station opened as Montparnasse station on the Avenue du Maine at the southern end of the old Gare Montparnasse (at the site currently occupied by the Tour Montparnasse, before the station was moved south of the Avenue du Maine in the 1960s) with the opening of the extension of Line 2 South from Passy to Place d&#x27;Italie. On 14 October 1907 Line 2 South became part of Line 5. On 11 March 1910 the Montparnasse station was renamed Avenue du Maine and on 30 June 1933 it was again renamed, to Bienvenüe in honour of the principal engineer of the Paris Métro, Fulgence Bienvenüe (accounting for the unusual diaeresis in the station&#x27;s name). On 12 October 1942 the section of Line 5 between Étoile and Place d&#x27;Italie, including Bienvenüe, was transferred from Line 5 to Line 6 in order to separate the underground and elevated sections of the Métro (because the latter were more vulnerable to air attack during World War II).

The Line 4 platforms opened as Montparnasse in the Boulevard du Montparnasse, near the main entrance of the old Gare Montparnasse (on its northern side) on 9 January 1910 as part of the connecting section of the line under the Seine between Châtelet and Raspail. The Line 12 platforms were opened in the Boulevard du Montparnasse on 5 November 1910 as part of the first section of the Nord-Sud Company&#x27;s Line C from Porte de Versailles to Notre-Dame-de-Lorette. This line was taken over by the Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain de Paris and was renamed Line 12 on 27 March 1931. In 1913 a connection was opened between the platforms of Lines 4 and Line 12 situated on the Boulevard du Montparnasse, both called Montparnasse.

The Line 13 platforms opened in the Avenue du Maine as Bienvenüe on 21 January 1937 as part of the original Line 14 between there and Porte de Vanves, and were connected to the Line 5 platforms. This line became part of Line 13 on 9 November 1976.

=== Connecting the southern and northern stations ===
At the end of the 1930s, a long corridor was built to connect the Montparnasse and Bienvenüe stations. Accordingly, the stations&#x27; names were fused to create Montparnasse-Bienvenüe on 6 October 1942. This long corridor is now equipped with moving walkways to facilitate access between the two parts of the station. The old Bienvenüe station serves lines 6 and 13, while the old Montparnasse station serves lines 4 and 12.

In 2002, in an experimental move, the RATP installed a moving walkway that moved at 12 km/h, which was then termed the &quot;fastest in the world.&quot; (The speed has however since been reduced to 9 km/h). The first several metres consist of metal rollers that accelerate passengers as they hold onto the handrail, because it would be dangerous to step directly onto the fast-moving conveyor. However, RATP announced in May 2009 that they would replace the walkway with an ordinary one in March 2011 in response to &#x27;numerous customer complaints concerning safety and unreliability&#x27;.

=== Barrière du Maine ===
The southern part of the station in the Avenue du Maine was the location of the &quot;Barrière du Maine&quot;, a gate built for the collection of taxation as part of the Wall of the Farmers-General; the gate was built between 1784 and 1788 and demolished in the nineteenth century.

== Passenger services ==
=== Access ===
The station has seven entrances:
* Entrance 1: Porte Océane: direct access to the SNCF station, stairs and escalators;
* Entrance 2: Place Bienvenüe: a staircase at 32 Avenue du Maine;
* Entrance 4: Tour Montparnasse: a staircase at Place Raoul-Dautry (between the tower and the train station);
* Entrance 5: Boulevard du Montparnasse: two staircases at 71 and 73 Boulevard du Montparnasse;

<text>A diving shot line, shot line, or diving shot, a type of downline or descending line (US Navy), is an item of diving equipment consisting of a ballast weight (the shot), a line and a buoy. The weight is dropped on the dive site. The line connects the weight and the buoy and is used by divers to as a visual and tactile reference to move between the surface and the dive site more safely and more easily, and as a controlled position for in-water staged decompression stops. It may also be used to physically control rate of descent and ascent, particularly by surface-supplied divers.

A &quot;lazy shot&quot; is a shot which is suspended above the bottom. It may be tethered to the main shot line at a convenient depth. It is used for decompression and frees the main shot line for other divers. The lazy shot&#x27;s line does not need to be longer than the decompression depth and is often only deep enough for the longer stops. It only needs a weight heavy enough to provide diver buoyancy control and sufficient buoyancy to avoid being dragged down under reasonably foreseeable circumstances.

==Purposes==
The shot has several purposes. The basic purpose to facilitate control of descent and ascent rate by the diver, and to control the location of the diver during descent and ascent. The line is useful for divers in conditions of low visibility or strong tides where underwater navigation between the surface and the dive site is difficult or on deep dives where a navigation error would dramatically reduce useful underwater time. Divers can use the line to help buoyancy control, to ease long decompression stops and to prevent drift when ascending in a current.

The buoy marks the dive site for the people on the surface, who are generally on the dive boat, who provide safety cover for the divers. This helps them focus on the place where the divers are likely to return to the surface and helps them return to the dive site more quickly after the boat has moved away from the site.

==Configuration==
Several configurations are in general use, depending on the conditions.

===Basic shotline===
The basic shotline has a line fixed to the weight and the float, and does not compensate for depth changes. This is adequate in many circumstances, and has the advantage of simplicity. If there is any current or wind, the buoy will drift until tension in the line prevents further movement. Large waves will cause the buoy and the top end of the line to bob up and down, jerking on the line.

===Bottom tensioned shotline===
A bottom tensioned shotline controls the tension of the line in one of two ways:
* A length of fairly heavy chain may be used between the bottom of the line and the shot. This chain should be long enough to take up any depth variations due to tides or waves. The weight of the chain pulls down on the shotline whenever part of the chain is off the bottom, maintaining some tension, but the tension varies depending on the amount of chain lifted. The length of line must be adjusted so that some chain is always suspended, but never all.
* The other method is to run the line through a loop on the weight and attach it to a small float which will pull up on the line to maintain tension. the float must either be sufficiently rigid to withstand the pressure, or an open bag inflated at the bottom by a diver. When this method is used a heavier shot is generally necessary, as the lift from the buoyancy of the float is doubled by the mechanical advantage of passing the line through the loop.

===Top tensioned shotline===
Top tensioning is achieved by running the line through a loop on the buoy and hanging a small weight on the end. This weight will hang down and double its weight will pull on the float due to the mechanical advantage of the system. This is not usually a major problem, as it is relatively easy to get a buoy of adequate volume.

The top tensioning system also prevents the line from being pulled up and down by wave action, but instead there is a tensioning weight going up and down twice as much as the buoy, which can be hazardous when the divers are in the depth range of its motion.

===Lazy shot===

A lazy shot is a shotline that does not reach the bottom. The weight hangs suspended from the surface and the line is used to provide a decompression station. A lazy shot may be hung from a buoy, a boat or a structure as circumstances warrant. Though it is not an essential part of the lazy shot, it is often used with a full depth shotline, or when the anchor rope is used as a substitute for a shotline, as it provides a more stable vertical reference than the anchor line, which tends to shift considerably as the boat moves under the influence of wind and wave. When used with the full shotline, the lazy shot provides a place away from the bubbles of other divers where the divers can decompress, and keeps them clear of the shotline if it is used by other divers. The lazy shot may be tethered to the main shotline and unclipped to drift after the last diver has reached it.

===Decompression trapeze===
A decompression trapeze is a horizontal bar or series of horizontal bars supported at the appropriate decompression stop depths, and provides controlled place for a group of divers to decompress in the water in relative comfort and in less crowded conditions than on a shotline.Construction is basically two lines suspended from the surface, by buoys, a boat, or a structure. The transverse bars are connected to the lines at the depths appropriate to the planned decompression stops, though usually a trapeze is not used for stops of only a few minutes, so several stops may be completed before the diver reaches the trapeze. Spreading the divers out across the current allows them to hold on without getting in each other&#x27;s way, and lets the bubbles go past without obstructing the other divers&#x27; view or disturbing their buoyancy. The bars must either be inherently negatively buoyant or ballasted so that the hang below the surface at the correct depth, and it is common to provide enough weight to compensate for minor irregularities in diver buoyancy control. The decompression trapeze is generally associated with a shotline, and if it is not close-coupled to the shotline, by using the shotline as one of the suspension lines, there will be a line from the shotline to the lowest bar of the trapeze, which will be either horizontal, or slope upwards toward the trapeze, so the divers can follow it without ascending above their decompression ceiling.

When a decompression bar is used in a strong current, it may be convenient for the last diver to unclip it from the shotline, so it drifts at the speed of the current, and the drag on the divers is eliminated. The chase boat would accompany the drifting trapeze which would be clearly identified by the supporting buoys.

Some dive teams will hang a spare cylinder of decompression gas on the trapeze, where it will be on hand in case of an emergency. This would normally be pressurised but with a closed valve, so that current pressure on the demand valve will not cause a free flow. More than one second stage can be fitted to allow more than one diver to use it at the same time.

===Spar buoy===
A high volume buoy with a large waterplane area such as a sphere or short cylinder will try to follow the wave profile, this will produce a cyclic jerking load near the surface, making it difficult to maintain a consistent depth at the stops. A spar buoy with a small waterplane area will dip into the water as each wave crest passes, with a far lower variation of tension on the shotline, so divers holding on will be more comfortable. If the spar buoy has insufficient volume for safety, a larger volume buoy can linked to it on a short tether as a backup.

==Construction==
Typically the weight is lead or iron, and weighs around 20 kg (44 lb). To prevent the assembly sinking and being lost, the buoy should provide more buoyancy than is required to make the complete system float. For example, if a 20 kg/44 lb weight is used, the buoy must provide more than 20 kg buoyancy: it needs to be more than 20 litres/4.4 gallons in volume, as it must also support its own weight.

Some agencies and codes of practice recommend a buoy that can not be dragged underwater by the divers relying on it for depth control. In surface-supplied diving this may be a considerable weight if diving heavy.

If used in a current, the shot must be prevented from being dragged away. This can be done by attaching it to a small anchor by a short line. Another method used is to tie the shot off to an object on the bottom by a thin line, which can be either released by the last diver, or broken when the shotline is recovered.

The line should be longer than the depth of the dive site at the deepest state of the tide during the dive, and at least 10 mm (0.4 inch) in diameter. A thick line is used because the shot weight is often lifted by pulling the line by hand and the pressure of a thin line can cause pain and injury to the hands when the shot is recovered.

Floating line, such as polypropylene, although cheap, can foul the propellers of boats and is an entanglement hazard to divers if it is allowed to accumulate near the surface. There are several ways of avoiding this: 
* coil the excess line after deployment, this can be done on a storage and deployment reel.
* use a &quot;top tensioning&quot; arrangement: the line runs freely through a ring on the buoy and is weighted at the top end by a small weight
* use a &quot;bottom tensioning&quot; arrangement: the line runs freely through a ring on the weight and is lifted at the bottom end by a small, rigid buoy.

Line which sinks will accumulate excess length at the bottom which may snag, making recovery of the shot difficult or impossible. In most cases a small amount of wind or current will put some tension on the line, which can put the buoy an inconvenient horizontal distance from the shot.

A large float will go up and down with the passing waves. This can be disconcerting and inconvenient for the divers if they need to hold onto it in a current, as they will to some extent go up and down with the line. This effect is minimised if a small diameter spar buoy is used as the primary buoy to tension the line, as it will tend to react less to the waves, with a large volume safety buoy on a short tether, which will prevent the spar buoy from being dragged down if the tension gets too much.

If a large float is used the divers can clip off to the shotline using a jonline, a short length of rope or webbing with a clip or loop that will hold one end to the shotline, allowing the diver to hold the other end at a short distance downstream. Vertical movements of the clipped end are absorbed by the horizontal length of the jonline.

==Deployment==
Various methods can be used to deploy a shotline. The shot is normally dropped first and should sink vertically, pulling the line down after it. The float is usually thrown in last. There are different methods of deploying the line so that it pays out smoothly and without snagging. These include unrolling from a reel and running out from a box, bucket or bag into which it was flaked or coiled in preparation. When sufficient line has run out, the remaining line can be secured on the reel with some slack to allow for tide, current and waves. If there is strong current and the site is deep some allowance must be made for drift during the drop. and a heavier shot which sinks faster and drags less is an advantage.

==Recovery==
The simplest method of recovery is to simply pull the line up by hand, but his can be hard work and should not be done by a diver with decompression stress. Various winches and capstans can be used if available, and if set up for the maneuver, towing the line through an eye on a large float can work well. Alternatively a lift bag at the shot can be partly inflated by a diver. This will inflate further during the lift and may even completely support the shot after it has risen sufficiently and the air has expanded enough.

==Using shots==

The shot is deployed, generally from a boat, after the dive site is located using position fixing such as GPS and an echo sounder.

Shots are more difficult to use in strong currents. The weight may drag along the seabed especially if the divers pull on the line as they descend. To avoid this the shot is often positioned upstream of an obstruction at the dive site so the obstruction prevents it dragging. A further problem is caused by diving at slack water; the direction of the current reverses during slack, so although the weight may be securely up current of the obstruction before slack, after the tide turns the weight is down current of the obstruction and may drag.

At the surface, the direction of the current is indicated by three signs at the buoy: the direction of the line to the weight, a &quot;horseshoe&quot; bow-wave on the front of the buoy and a wake at the back of the buoy.

Sometimes, two buoys are used at the surface. The second buoy can further indicate the strength and the direction of the current or be misleading because it may indicate the direction of the wind. A second buoy can be used to provide additional buoyancy if one buoy is dragged underwater.

Sometimes the line, once at the dive site on the seabed, is tied to the dive site to guard against the weight dragging away from the site. The line itself may be tied to the dive site or a thin &quot;waster&quot; line may attach the strong line to the dive site. If a waster is used, the boat at the surface can be used to break the waster at the end of diving before the shot is lifted. If the main line is attached to the dive site, the divers must untie it before ascending at the end of diving otherwise they lose their shot.

In a current, the buoy may be dragged under the surface by water resistance of the divers holding the line as they ascend and reach shallow water. If this happens divers will not want to descend with the buoy and will prefer to release the shot line and be swept away from the shot. In strong currents divers often decompress on decompression buoys instead of using a shot.

Sometimes, a lifting bag is attached to the weight and used to help raise the weight at the end of the dive.

<text>Cape Henlopen is the southern cape of the Delaware Bay along the Atlantic coast of the United States. It lies in the state of Delaware, near the town of Lewes, where the Delaware Bay meets the Atlantic Ocean. Off the coast on the bay side are two lighthouses, called the Harbor of Refuge Light and the Delaware Breakwater East End Light.

==Early history==

Cape Henlopen, originally spelled Cape Hinlopen (after its namesake Thijmen Jacobsz Hinlopen who was a prominent Dutch trader), was New Netherland&#x27;s southernmost border on the 37th parallel north.

In 1620, Thijmen Jacobsz Hinlopen became the business partner of Cornelis Jacobsen Mey in the now washed out Cape Cornelius and the incorrectly spelled Cape May with the ships Blijde Boodschap (English: &quot;Good News&quot;) and Bever both of which focused on exploration and trade with the Indians on the Delaware River (then Zuidt Rivier).

The area between the 38th and 40th parallels (i.e., the Delaware Bay area) as well as the Delaware River from north to south had previously been surveyed and charted by Cornelis Hendricksz from Monnikendam on the ship &quot;Onrust&quot; in 1614, 1615 and 1616. From August until November 1616, the New Netherland Company, which had an exclusive trading patent for the New Netherland territory between 40° and 45° latitude, had tried unsuccessfully to obtain an exclusive patent from the States General of the Dutch Republic for the territory between 38° and 40° latitude.

Cornelis Jacobsz Mey was also unable to trade in the South River (Delaware River) at the exclusion of competing Dutch companies. Those Dutch companies came in conflict with one another but were eventually able to reach agreement in New Netherland. Discord arose again which was settled, finally, by a judgment of arbitrators at Amsterdam on December 23, 1623. The 38th and 39th parallels region came under the final jurisdiction of the Dutch West India Company on behalf of the States General with the delivery of the first settlers to Governors Island in New Netherland in 1624. Those settlers were subsequently spread out onto Verhulsten Island (Burlington Island) in the Delaware, at Fort Orange (now Albany) in the Hudson River and at the mouth of the Connecticut River in order to finalize the claim to New Netherland as a North American province according to 
the Hugo Grotius Law of Nations (? year).

In 1782 during the American Revolutionary War, the young Continental Navy Lieutenant Joshua Barney fought with a British squadron at Cape May and Delaware Bay. Barney&#x27;s force of three sloops defeated a Royal Navy frigate, a sloop-of-war and a Loyalist privateer. The battle ended with the loss of two British vessels and one American sloop.

==State Park==
Cape Henlopen State Park is a 5,193 acre (21 km2) Delaware state park on Cape Henlopen. William Penn made the beaches of Cape Henlopen one of the first public lands established in what has become the United States in 1682 with the declaration that Cape Henlopen would be for &quot;the usage of the citizens of Lewes and Sussex County.&quot; Cape Henlopen State Park has a 24-hour and year-round fishing pier as well as campgrounds. The remainder of the park is only open from sunrise to sunset, and includes a bathhouse on the Atlantic Ocean, an area for surf-fishing, a disc golf course, and bicycle lanes, walking paths, and a World War II-era watchtower which is open to the public. The beach at Herring Point is also a popular surfing spot.

Camp Henlopen serves as the Eastern terminus for the American Discovery Trail, the only coast to coast hiking trail in the United States.

<doc id="504090" wikidata="Q3279296" url="?curid=504090" title="Sweden–Finland">
<text>Sweden–Finland (; ) is a Finnish historiographical term referring to Sweden from the twelfth century to the Napoleonic Wars. 

== History ==
In 1809, the realm was split after the Finnish War. The eastern half came to constitute the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland, in personal union with Imperial Russia.

The term was coined by Finnish historians during the 1920s, but since then there has been an effort to drop it from professional historiography due to its perceived inaccuracy. However, it is often still used in everyday Finnish speech.

Although the term has didactic merits, for instance when used in conjunction with the term Denmark–Norway, it is misleading because Finland was an integrated part of the realm since the twelfth century, whereas Denmark and Norway were two sovereign kingdoms, which were united by personal union in 1380, but remained separate states until the sixteenth century.

The eastern and western regions of the realm became united mainly due to trade and settlements via Åland. A common misconception is that Finland was conquered by Sweden as a result of crusades. Crusades probably occurred, but had no decisive significance.

Until 1809 Finland was considered one of four Swedish lands. However, it was different from Götaland and Svealand, but not all of Norrland, in that Swedish was not the majority language in this part of the kingdom, except for areas along the coastline and amongst the nobility and the urban upper classes. 

During the time of the Swedish Empire Sweden–Finland was identical to Sweden proper; other overseas possessions constituted the dominions of Sweden. However, a conceptual distinction was sometimes made between Sweden and Finland already before 1809: for example, in certain sixteenth century documents, Gustav Vasa occasionally uses the phrases &quot;the cities of Sweden and Finland&quot; and &quot;the cities of Finland&quot; and &quot;the cities of Sweden&quot;, thus implying that the two entities are not identical. In this context, however, &quot;Finland&quot; usually referred to the provinces of Finland Proper and Satakunta, not to Tavastia or Karelia.

<doc id="504093" wikidata="Q2640320" url="?curid=504093" title="Imaginos">
<text>Imaginos is the eleventh studio album by the American rock band Blue Öyster Cult. It was released in 1988, and was their last recording with their original record label, CBS/Columbia Records. 

The album took nearly eight years to complete and was originally intended to be the first in a trilogy of solo albums by Blue Öyster Cult drummer and songwriter Albert Bouchard. Bouchard was fired in August 1981, and CBS rejected the album in 1984, but a re-worked version was eventually published as a product of the band. Many guest musicians contributed to the project over this eight-year span, including Joe Satriani, Aldo Nova, and Doors guitarist Robby Krieger, but some band members were barely involved in the recording process. Thus, &quot;Imaginos&quot; is often considered more as a project of producer and lyricist Sandy Pearlman than as a true album of the band.

&quot;Imaginos&quot; weaves scripts and poems by Pearlman, dating from the second half of the 1960s, into a concept album and rock opera about an alien conspiracy that is brought to fruition during the late 19th and early 20th century through the actions of Imaginos, an agent of evil. The tale combines elements of gothic literature and science fiction and is strongly inspired by the work of H. P. Lovecraft. Subtitled &quot;a bedtime story for the children of the damned&quot;, it has an intricate storyline whose often-obscure lyrics contain many historical references, prompting speculation by fans and critics. It is often considered one of the heaviest albums released by Blue Öyster Cult, its music more akin to heavy metal than the melodic and commercial hard rock of their two previous works. The poor sales of those albums resulted in record label pressure on the band that led to their disbandment in 1986; a subsequent comeback featured only three members of the classic line-up.

The album received some critical acclaim, but was not a commercial success, and Columbia Records ended their contract with Blue Öyster Cult at the completion of the Imaginos Tour. Albert Bouchard, excluded from the recording progress of &quot;Imaginos&quot; after the initial rejection from Columbia Records, then took legal action against the band and the label to protect his rights as author and producer on the album. Blue Öyster Cult continued to perform and remained a live attraction, but ten years passed before they released an album of new songs.

==Background==

=== Sandy Pearlman and &quot;The Soft Doctrines of Imaginos&quot;===
The concept and the character of Imaginos were originally created by the young Sandy Pearlman for a collection of poems and scripts called &quot;The Soft Doctrines of Imaginos&quot; (sometimes reported as Immaginos), written in the mid-1960s during his formative years as a student of anthropology and sociology at Stony Brook University, Brandeis University and The New School. Pearlman combined cultural references learned in his studies with elements of gothic literature and science fiction, and created a secret history about the origin of the two world wars. Pearlman himself declared his predilection for the American weird fiction author &quot;H. P. Lovecraft and other writers of that ilk&quot;, as well as for books on modern warfare and conspiracies.

Established by 1967 as a critic for the seminal US music magazine &quot;Crawdaddy!&quot;, Pearlman was also the mentor, manager and producer for the band Soft White Underbelly, which, after various name changes, became Blue Öyster Cult, a term taken from the &quot;Imaginos&quot; script. The adapted and amended rhymes of Pearlman, along with his friend and colleague Richard Meltzer&#x27;s arcane writings, were used as lyrics for most of the band&#x27;s early songs; musician and writer Lenny Kaye recalls in his introduction to the re-mastered edition of their first album that &quot;the band kept a folder full of Meltzer&#x27;s and Pearlman&#x27;s word associations in their rehearsal room, and would leaf through it, setting fragments to music&quot;. Fragments of the &quot;Imaginos&quot; script are scattered out-of-context throughout the songs of the first four albums, where the original meanings are lost to listeners unaware of the larger picture. The resulting mystery feeds fan fascination for the music of Blue Öyster Cult, and is responsible for their reputation as &quot;the world&#x27;s brainiest heavy metal band&quot;. Much fan speculation centers around lyrics&#x27; relationship to the &quot;Imaginos&quot; storyline, while Pearlman&#x27;s deliberate reticence and misleading in revealing his sources only augments the obscurity of the matter. During the band&#x27;s first period of activity, the theme of the alien conspiracy became more defined and predominant in the mind of its author, to the point that notes on the cover of their 1974 album &quot;Secret Treaties&quot; referred to the secret history conceived by Pearlman, while its songs &quot;Astronomy&quot; and &quot;Subhuman&quot; contained lyrics fully dedicated to the &quot;Imaginos&quot; plot.

The band sought to separate creatively from Pearlman in the late 1970s; they avoided his lyrics and concepts and refused to record an album entirely dedicated to Imaginos, but eventually returned to his material for the lyrics of &quot;Shadow of California&quot; (from &quot;The Revölution by Night&quot; of 1983) and &quot;When the War Comes&quot; (from &quot;Club Ninja&quot; of 1985). Pearlman and Albert Bouchard hoped to record such an album, and as far back as 1972 had begun to write songs directly inspired by the Imaginos story. Nonetheless, with the exception of the extracts used for song lyrics, the text of &quot;The Soft Doctrines of Imaginos&quot; remains to this day largely unknown and unpublished.

===Blue Öyster Cult in 1988===

The commercial success of the single &quot;(Don&#x27;t Fear) The Reaper&quot; in 1976, and a series of Platinum and Gold discs in the following years, placed pressure on the band as their label, Columbia Records, expected them to repeat these successes. Despite good sales of the album &quot;Fire of Unknown Origin&quot; and the single &quot;Burnin&#x27; for You&quot;, in August 1981 the conflicts and the stress accumulated in more than ten years of cohabitation led to the firing of drummer Albert Bouchard, a founding member and an important contributor to the songwriting and sound of the group, allegedly for unstable behavior. The relationship between the former band mates remained tense in the following years. Old feuds resurfaced during a short reunion tour with the original line-up in 1985, with the result that no one in the band accepted A. Bouchard back in Blue Öyster Cult. However, A. Bouchard still hoped to be reinstated in the band through his work done for &quot;Imaginos&quot;.

Albert Bouchard&#x27;s departure started a rotation of personnel in the formerly stable band roster, which by 1986 left only Eric Bloom and Donald &quot;Buck Dharma&quot; Roeser as original members. Allen Lanier left in 1985 during the recording sessions for &quot;Club Ninja&quot;, unsatisfied by the music and annoyed at the presence of Tommy Zvoncheck as his replacement, while Joe Bouchard quit soon after that album&#x27;s release to pursue different career opportunities, play other musical genres, and settle in his family life. The release of two expensive studio albums in 1983 and 1985, which received generally bad critical response and sold poorly, ruined the relationship with their demanding record label and left the band with little support and very few ideas on how to go on with their careers. As a result, &quot;in the summer of 1986, the band semi-officially broke up&quot;, Bloom explained in an interview to the British music magazine &quot;Kerrang!&quot; in 1988. The final line-up of 1986 included Bloom, Roeser, Tommy Zvoncheck on keyboards, Jon Rogers on bass and Jimmy Willcox on drums.

Pearlman&#x27;s and Steve Schenk&#x27;s managerial efforts were rewarded when Blue Öyster Cult were hired for some gigs in Greece in July 1987. After a nine-month layoff, the band returned to activity and Allen Lanier re-joined. The European shows were a success, and the reformed line-up of Bloom, Roeser, Lanier, Jon Rogers and drummer Ron Riddle worked well together on stage. Blue Öyster Cult returned to the road in 1987 and 1988 with renewed enthusiasm, but without a new album to promote, until the release of &quot;Imaginos&quot;.

==Concept and storyline==
&quot;Imaginos&quot; was envisioned as a rock opera to be published as a trilogy of double albums, with a storyline encompassing about two hundred years of history, from the beginning of the 19th century to the end of the 20th. This album represents an abbreviated version of the first volume of that planned trilogy, but with the songs arranged out of order, rendering the story harder to comprehend. Even when the song lyrics are analyzed in the chronological order that was devised by the authors and is followed in this section, the narrative progression is scarce and the content often difficult to decipher for the casual reader. However, thanks to various comments in interviews by Pearlman and Bouchard, and the extensive sleeve notes by Pearlman that were issued with the original release, it is possible to reconstruct the story to a great extent.
Although often referred to as a dream, the concept behind &quot;Imaginos&quot; is what Pearlman described as &quot;an interpretation of history – an explanation for the onset of World War I, or a revelation of the occult origins of it&quot;, which he crafted on elements of mythology, sociology, alchemy, science and occultism. This &quot;combination of horror story and fairy tale&quot; cites historical facts and characters, and is filled with literary references to ancient civilizations. These elements come together in a conspiracy theory of epic proportions, the subject of which is the manipulation of the course of human history.

Central to this story are Les Invisibles (The Invisible Ones), a group of seven beings worshipped by the natives of Mexico and Haiti prior to the arrival of Spanish colonists in the 16th century, identified by some fans as the Loa of the Voodoo religion. The nature of Les Invisibles is left unclear, although it is hinted that they may be extraterrestrials, or beings akin to the Great Old Ones in the works of H. P. Lovecraft. An interpretation of the lyrics of the song &quot;Astronomy&quot; by some fans suggests that the star Sirius is of particular astrological significance to Les Invisibles, with clues identifying it as their place of origin; it is during the so-called Dog Days of August, when Sirius is in conjunction with the Sun that their influence over mankind is at its apex. By subtly influencing the minds of men, the beings are said to be &quot;playing with our history as if it&#x27;s a game&quot;, affecting events in world history over the course of centuries. For the three centuries after European discovery of the New World, this game plays out as the desire for gold is used to transform Spain into the dominant power in Europe, only to be usurped by England in the 17th century and later, through technology, by other nations (&quot;Les Invisibles&quot;).

The principal story begins in August 1804, with the birth of a &quot;modified child&quot; called Imaginos, in the American state of New Hampshire. Because of the astrological significance of the place and time of his birth, the hermaphroditic Imaginos is of particular interest to Les Invisibles, who begin granting him with superhuman abilities while he is young. Unaware of his true destiny or nature, the young Imaginos finds out that he is apparently able to change his appearance at will and see the future (&quot;Imaginos&quot;). As the child becomes an adult, he develops a sense of wanderlust. Billing himself as an adventurer, he sets out to explore Texas and the western frontier, arriving in New Orleans in 1829. It is there that he has a vision imploring him to travel to Mexico in search of an artifact &quot;lost, last and luminous, scored to sky yet never found&quot;. Imaginos joins the crew of a ship traveling to the Yucatán Peninsula, but while passing through the Gulf of Mexico, the ship encounters a freak storm of which his visions failed to warn him (&quot;Del Rio&#x27;s Song&quot;). The ship sinks with most of its crew, and Imaginos, half dead, washes ashore and is left for dead by the other survivors. As he lies dying &quot;on a shore where oyster beds seem plush as down&quot;, Imaginos is addressed by a symphony of voices who identify themselves as Les Invisibles. Imaginos&#x27; true nature is revealed to him, and he is informed that the circumstances of his entire life have been manipulated to bring him to that specific moment in time. Having explained themselves to him, they offer him a choice – die as a human, or live as their servant (&quot;Blue Öyster Cult&quot;). Imaginos accepts their offer, and is resurrected from the dead by the Blue Öyster Cult, the servants of Les Invisibles. He is inducted into the cult and given a new name - Desdinova, &quot;Eternal Light&quot;. He realizes that his descent and the origin of his powers comes from the stars where his masters live and becomes aware of his role in the making of history (&quot;Astronomy&quot;).
From this point on, Imaginos becomes a tool in Les Invisibles&#x27; manipulation of human history. For the next sixty-three years, he insinuates himself into the world of European politics. He uses his ability to change identities to take the place of high-ranking officials, whose offices he uses to bring about Les Invisibles&#x27; will (&quot;I Am the One You Warned Me Of&quot;), introducing new knowledge and technology to the unsuspecting world (&quot;The Siege and Investiture of Baron Von Frankenstein&#x27;s Castle at Weisseria&quot;). Through shapeshifting, Imaginos lives as both a man and a woman, using the name Desdinova for his female persona who at some point takes the office of foreign minister. 
By 1892, Imaginos is living in a mansion in Cornwall and has a nine-year-old granddaughter. Having by this time spent several decades studying mysticism and astrology, Imaginos discovers that Elizabethan England&#x27;s rise as a superpower coincided with John Dee&#x27;s acquisition of a magic obsidian mirror from Mexico, which serves as a bridge between Les Invisibles&#x27; alien world and ours, and the means to spread their influence on Earth. Some fans see Les Invisibles&#x27; actions in favour of England against Spain as a sort of vengeance for the extermination by the conquistadores of their worshippers in Central America, while others view their intervention as only part of the mysterious scheme carried on by the alien entities through the centuries (&quot;In the Presence of Another World&quot;).

This revelation in mind, Imaginos decides that the time has come to reattempt his aborted mission to Mexico. On August 1, 1892, he sets sail aboard a &quot;charmed ship&quot; which, despite &quot;storms on land and storms at sea&quot;, delivers him faithfully to Mexico. After several months exploring the jungles of Yucatán he finds an undiscovered Mayan pyramid. Following a long passage into the interior of the pyramid he discovers a chamber carved from solid jade, in which he finds the &quot;Magna of Illusion&quot;, a twin of Dee&#x27;s magic mirror. Stealing away with the artifact, he returns to Cornwall a year to the day of his departure, which coincides with the tenth birthday of his granddaughter. Imaginos gives the mirror to the young girl as a birthday present, and for the following 21 years it sits collecting dust in her attic, silently poisoning the minds of European leaders. In 1914, &quot;World War I breaks out. A disease with a long incubation&quot; (&quot;Magna of Illusion&quot;).

The two songs excluded from the final release introduced further elements to the plot. &quot;Gil Blanco County&quot;, a song with music written by Allen Lanier for Soft White Underbelly in the late 1960s and recorded in the unpublished Elektra album of the Stalk-Forrest Group (now available as &quot;St. Cecilia: The Elektra Recordings&quot;), has short and elusive lyrics apparently detailing the escape of Imaginos from Texas to Arizona. The other song, &quot;The Girl That Love Made Blind&quot;, is an Albert Bouchard composition which explains that Imaginos&#x27; powers include the capacity of moving &quot;in and through time&quot;, assuming different identities in every moment of history.

==Production==

===Albert Bouchard&#x27;s solo album===

Albert Bouchard began writing music for &quot;Imaginos&quot; following the release of the band&#x27;s first album in 1972. There were plans as early as 1975 to release a concept album dedicated to Pearlman&#x27;s scripts, but the material was not ready. All of the songs had been written by 1977, with the participation of various band members, and at least four of them (&quot;Astronomy&quot;, &quot;In the Presence of Another World&quot;, &quot;I Am the One You Warned Me Of&quot;, &quot;Imaginos&quot;) were completed and demoed during the recording sessions for the album &quot;Spectres&quot;. Demos of the other tracks were recorded by Albert Bouchard and remained in various stages of development during the following years, with the band uninterested in pursuing the &quot;Imaginos&quot; project that Albert Bouchard and Sandy Pearlman had been insistently proposing.

After Albert Bouchard&#x27;s 1981 dismissal from Blue Öyster Cult, he and Pearlman worked on the material, having secured an advance from Columbia Records on the strength of the demos partially sung by Eric Bloom. The initial concept of a trilogy of double albums, largely based on music written during the band&#x27;s many years of activity and on adapted and rewritten Pearlman lyrics linked by the Imaginos storyline, is reflected in the working titles: &quot;Act I: Imaginos&quot;, &quot;Act II: Germany Minus Zero and Counting&quot; (also known as &quot;Bombs over Germany&quot; and &quot;Half-Life Time&quot;), and &quot;Act III: The Mutant Reformation&quot;. These were intended as Albert Bouchard solo albums, a spin-off of Blue Öyster Cult main discography, although some fan opinion holds that Columbia Records had intended all along that the recordings would result in a new Blue Öyster Cult album.

Albert Bouchard and Pearlman set up the recording of the basic tracks for the first album of the trilogy in June 1982, with sound engineers Corky Stasiak and Paul Mandl at Kingdom Sound Studios in Long Island, New York, and at The Boogie Hotel, a studio owned by the boogie rock band Foghat and located in a large Victorian mansion in Port Jefferson, New York. At the same time and in the same facilities, Blue Öyster Cult were recording the album &quot;The Revölution by Night&quot; with producer Bruce Fairbairn. Albert Bouchard sang lead vocals and played guitar on all tracks, accompanied by:
* Tommy Morrongiello (Ian Hunter Band, Helen Wheels), guitars and arrangements,
*Jack Rigg (David Johansen Band) and Phil Grande (Peter Criss and Ellen Foley session musician), guitars,
*Tommy Mandel (Ian Hunter Band, Bryan Adams), keyboards,
*Kenny Aaronson, bass,
*Thommy Price (Scandal), drums.

The guitar solos by The Doors&#x27; Robby Krieger, who had played live with Blue Öyster Cult on &quot;Extraterrestrial Live&quot;, and guitar parts by Aldo Nova and the late Kevin Carlson, guitarist of the Aldo Nova Band, should also be ascribed to these recording sessions. According to Bouchard, Jeff Kawalik, Corky Stasiak, Helen Wheels, Glen Bell, Peggy Atkins and Casper McCloud were among the uncredited background vocalists which participated to these sessions. 

Allen Lanier, Joe Bouchard and Donald Roeser contributed instrumental parts and backing vocals to the tracks as guests. These remain Lanier&#x27;s and Joe Bouchard&#x27;s only contributions to &quot;Imaginos&quot;. Columbia Records&#x27; complaints about Albert Bouchard&#x27;s lead vocals pushed him to finance multiple recordings with try-outs of singers, including Jon Rogers and Joey Cerisano, whose performances on some songs were used for the final mix of the album in 1988. The new recordings, overdubs by other uncredited musicians, and mixing lasted until 1984. Musicians involved in this second phase of recording included future BÖC keyboard player Tommy Zvoncheck, who had already played with Clarence Clemons, Public Image Ltd and The Dream Syndicate.

An almost-finished product that comprised more than ninety minutes of music and whose thirteen tracks included re-arranged versions of &quot;Astronomy&quot; and &quot;Subhuman&quot; (retitled &quot;Blue Öyster Cult&quot;), &quot;Gil Blanco County&quot;, the ballad &quot;The Girl That Love Made Blind&quot; and a couple of chorales, was presented to Columbia Records executives in 1984. They rejected the album and decided to shelve it, officially because of Albert Bouchard&#x27;s vocals and the lack of commercial perspectives.

===The Blue Öyster Cult album===
Despite the firm intention of Sandy Pearlman and Albert Bouchard to salvage the project, the recordings remained unfinished and untouched for more than two years due to lack of funding. While struggling with the long, complex and expensive production of the Blue Öyster Cult&#x27;s album &quot;Club Ninja&quot;, Pearlman associated himself with Daniel J. Levitin, A&amp;R director of the local punk label 415 Records, with whom he shared academic interests in neuroscience. In 1986, Pearlman leased Studio C of San Francisco&#x27;s Hyde Street Recording Studios, and dubbed it Alpha &amp; Omega Studios. Pearlman and Levitin produced various bands there, and Pearlman sub-leased the studio to other producers. In September 1986, when the poor sales of &quot;Club Ninja&quot; resulted in a commercial failure and the group disbanded, the lack of new material from the band for the foreseeable future prompted Pearlman to propose &quot;Imaginos&quot; to Columbia Records as a new Blue Öyster Cult album. He obtained a small budget from the record label to remix the album and to add the vocals of Roeser and Bloom, singers of all the hits produced by Blue Öyster Cult.

With &quot;Imaginos&quot; again a work in progress at the end of 1986, band manager Steve Schenk contacted Albert Bouchard to get the original recordings he still owned. Pearlman, with the help of engineers Paul Mandl and Steve Brown, spent his time cleaning up, re-arranging and remixing the original recordings, using state-of-the-art technology and the collaborations of studio musicians. Virtuoso guitarist Joe Satriani financed the recording of his second album, &quot;Surfing with the Alien&quot;, through his work on &quot;Imaginos&quot;. Similarly, thrash metal guitarist Marc Biedermann, whose band Blind Illusion was recording at Hyde Street Studios, mixed the album &quot;The Sane Asylum&quot; at Pearlman&#x27;s studio in exchange for his collaboration. Biedermann declared in a 2008 interview that he &quot;played more lead guitar on that album than Buck Dharma&quot;. Roeser went to California in early 1987 to record his lead vocals and some guitar parts, while Tommy Zvoncheck, still a member of Blue Öyster Cult, re-recorded most of the keyboards on the album. The last parts recorded were the lead vocals by Eric Bloom, who was in the studio in early 1988. Donald Roeser later summed up his and Bloom&#x27;s late involvement in the making of the album by saying &quot;&quot;Imaginos&quot; was our parting of the ways. That was something that Eric and I agreed to do, sort of, out of respect for Sandy and his effort that he made with &quot;Imaginos&quot;&quot;.

The as-imagined album and the as-released album bear little relation to each other. The final version of &quot;Imaginos&quot; is almost forty minutes shorter than the first version of 1984 and has two fewer songs, but as Pearlman explained, &quot;we ran out of money and couldn&#x27;t do the whole thing&quot;. The rhythm section of the original recording was kept mostly intact, but many guitars and most of the keyboards and lead vocals were re-recorded or remixed. The song order was scrambled out of the fixed chronology, possibly because of the label executives&#x27; intervention to have a more commercially attractive product. The sleeve notes&#x27; definition of the album as a &quot;random access myth (where) everything happens all at once&quot;, appears to many as a posthumous justification for the mixed-up song order. &quot;Imaginos&quot; does not contain ballads or an immediately recognizable commercial single, and its music is often considered the heaviest produced by Blue Öyster Cult, the best attempt by the band to produce a heavy metal album. Critics and fans point to elements of progressive rock also present in the music, which create a dark and &quot;ominous&quot; atmosphere that fits the obscure content of the song lyrics.

==Packaging==

Artist Greg Scott, who had supplied the cover art for the Blue Öyster Cult albums &quot;Fire of Unknown Origin&quot;, &quot;Extraterrestrial Live&quot; and &quot;The Revolution by Night&quot;, worked with Sandy Pearlman for several months in 1984 to prepare paintings inspired by the &quot;Imaginos&quot; saga for the gatefold cover of the expected double album. &quot;And none of that was ever seen, because it was shelved&quot;, Scott remarked in an interview with Canadian journalist Martin Popoff.

The art direction for the 1988 release was instead put in the hands of CBS Records&#x27; art director Arnold Levine and his staff. They based the cover art on a fin de siècle image of the Cliff House, a restaurant perched on the cliffs just north of Ocean Beach on the western side of San Francisco, California, built with the architectural style of a Victorian château and destroyed by fire in 1907. The back cover is a maritime landscape, modified to appear as the continuation of the picture on the front and similarly tinted in sinister black and grey colors.

The inner sleeve, besides the credits and Sandy Pearlman&#x27;s lengthy notes on the Imaginos story, sports a large black and white photo by landscape British photographer Simon Marsden of Duntrune Castle in Argyllshire, Scotland.

The credits printed on the sleeve of the first release were largely incomplete and made no distinction between the recording sessions of 1982-84 and those of 1987-88, apparently validating the false assumption that the original line-up of Blue Öyster Cult had reunited for the making of the album. Aside from the list of band members, the credits reported only some session musicians and other members of the so-called Guitar Orchestra of the State of Imaginos, and omitted other personnel who had contributed to &quot;Imaginos&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Imaginos&quot; was mastered at Precision Lacquer in Los Angeles by Stephen Marcussen and finally released as LP and CD in July 1988, almost eight years after the work on it had begun and twenty-three years after the concept of Imaginos was created. A limited edition of the album was also released in blue vinyl.
The first single extracted from the album was an edited version of &quot;Astronomy&quot;, which was released as a 7&quot;, as a 12&quot; and as a CD single. American author Stephen King recorded the spoken introduction to the radio edit of the song, a reading of the lines written on the back cover of the LP. The 12&quot; contains various mixes of &quot;Astronomy&quot;, including one sung by Albert Bouchard. The single received sufficient radio airplay to reach No. 12 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in September 1988, but it did not enter the US singles chart. The CD single &quot;In the Presence of Another World&quot; was issued later only for promotional purposes, but received no attention from FM radio stations.

The album was largely neglected by the record label, which did little to no promotion in the US. Pearlman stated that &quot;there was actually no intention on the part of Columbia Records at all to promote it. (...) Basically the people wanted to work it and they were told not to work it&quot;. Roeser commented later that he did not &quot;think Sony’s ever really known how to sell us, from the beginning (...) and Columbia never felt that they knew how to market us&quot;. &quot;Imaginos&quot; fared better with CBS International, which distributed the album abroad and produced a music video for &quot;Astronomy&quot; in the UK, which aired in coincidence with the European tour dates of 1989. The video clip does not feature members of the band, but begins with the spoken introduction by Stephen King and focuses on the storyline narrated in the album.

Albert Bouchard had been completely excluded from the retooling of the album for contractual reasons, but hoped to have his long work rewarded with a credit as co-producer, and to be paid accordingly. After the disbandment of Blue Öyster Cult, he contacted the other band members in an attempt to organize a 1987 reunion tour, with the original line-up, to promote &quot;Imaginos&quot;. His economic and membership requests were both rejected, due to resistances within the label and within the band, so he filed a lawsuit in 1989 against the management of Blue Öyster Cult and Columbia Records to receive payment for his work. The lawsuit was settled out of court, but his resentment towards Sandy Pearlman for what he felt was a theft of his work never eased, eliminating any chance of future collaborations for the completion of the Imaginos saga.

One of the final mixes of 1984, titled &quot;Albert Bouchard&#x27;s Imaginos&quot;, surfaced on the Internet in 2003 as a free download. The album contains music recorded during the sessions from 1982 to 1984 and permits a comparison of arrangements, vocals and sound with the version published in 1988.

&quot;Imaginos&quot; was re-issued only once, through Sony BMG sub-label American Beat Records in December 2007. The 2007 reissue was remastered to adjust the volume levels and included a CD sleeve with corrected, but not complete, credits. A new remastered version of &quot;Imaginos&quot; is included in &quot;The Columbia Albums Collection&quot; boxed set, issued by Sony/Legacy in November 2012.

==Tour==
Blue Öyster Cult interrupted their schedule of US shows only just before the album release in June 1988, to familiarize the band members with the new material. The 1987 formation with Bloom, Roeser, Lanier, Rogers and Riddle remained the closest available to a full reunion, given Joe Bouchard&#x27;s unwillingness to participate and the opposition to Albert Bouchard. The Imaginos Tour began in the East Coast of the US in July, and continued on to most of the States. The set lists were based mainly on old material and included only two or three songs from &quot;Imaginos&quot;, usually &quot;I Am the One You Warned Me Of&quot;, &quot;In the Presence of Another World&quot; and the new version of &quot;Astronomy&quot;. Blue Öyster Cult visited Canada in January 1989, France in February, the United Kingdom in March, and concluded their European tour in Germany in April.

During the following US tour, the new management of Columbia Records, which had been sold to Sony Music in 1988, terminated Columbia&#x27;s almost 20-year relationship with Blue Öyster Cult because of their low sales. This left them without a recording contract for the next ten years. Eric Bloom stated that &quot;in general, CBS was straight with us, when we had fans working inside the company&quot;, but after &quot;3-4 different Presidents of the company came and went&quot; the commercial appeal of Blue Öyster Cult had disappeared for the new management.

A review of their performance at The Ritz in New York on January 6, 1989, highlights the good shape and musicianship of the band, but remarks that the new songs were played with considerably less enthusiasm than the rest of the show. Although the band continued to tour regularly, the songs from &quot;Imaginos&quot; had already disappeared from their shows by the end of 1989, never to be performed live again.

==Critical and commercial reception==
&quot;Imaginos&quot; received mixed reviews both from professional critics and fans.

David Fricke, in his review for the magazine &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, considers &quot;Imaginos&quot; &quot;the best black-plastic blitz to bear the Cult&#x27;s trademark cross and claw since 1974&#x27;s &quot;Secret Treaties&quot;&quot;, but remarks that the &quot;lengthy gestation&quot; of the album and the many musicians involved makes it &quot;a bit of a cheat for Cult Purists&quot;, and that is &quot;only an illusionary re-creation of the way BÖC used to be&quot;. William Ruhlmann of AllMusic wrote that &quot;Imaginos&quot; is &quot;the album that comes closest to defining Blue Öyster Cult&quot; and their &quot;creative swan song&quot;, and &quot;perhaps BÖC&#x27;s most consistent album, certainly its most uncompromising (...) and also the closest thing to a real heavy-metal statement from a band that never quite fit that description&quot;. For Don Kaye of &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, the album is &quot;the best BÖC slab since (...) &quot;Cultösaurus Erectus&quot; and harks back in style and attitude towards the brilliance of masterpieces like &quot;Secret Treaties&quot; and &quot;Spectres&quot;&quot;. A contrary evaluation comes from Blue Öyster Cult biographer Martin Popoff, who has &quot;come to dismiss it as somewhat of a sell-out&quot;. Despite it being &quot;the band&#x27;s heaviest, fulfilling many a fan’s wish for sustained metal&quot;, Popoff finds &quot;the whole thing perched on the edge of parody, too dressy and fantastical lyrically in a painfully self-conscious way, (...) a laborious exercise in expected weird&quot;, ultimately &quot;a baffling yet anticlimactic punctuation to the band’s perplexed career&quot;. A reviewer from the Italian music criticism site Storia della Musica points out that the album is now a &#x27;cult&#x27; item for its rarity, its content and the scarce love shown by the band for this work. He writes that &quot;it could have been the &quot;Tommy&quot; or &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; of BÖC&quot; but, &quot;despite the profound influences it evokes&quot;, its &quot;mutilated and sabotaged form&quot; and the disinterest of the musicians involved makes &quot;Imaginos&quot; only a wasted opportunity.

The reviews posted by Blue Öyster Cult&#x27;s fans and by buyers of the album on the customer review site Epinions and on the online collaborative metadata database Rate Your Music are in general quite positive, praising &quot;Imaginos&quot; as a &quot;creative masterpiece&quot;, but underlining that the work is not a group effort but &quot;the brain-child of original drummer Albert Bouchard and longtime producer and lyricist Sandy Pearlman&quot;. A professional Italian reviewer describes the Blue Öyster Cult name on the cover as &quot;only a commercial decoy&quot; for an Albert Bouchard solo album.

The album entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart on August 19, 1988, peaked at No. 122, and exited the charts on October 8. It sold about 50,000 copies in the US, and was a commercial failure for Columbia Records and a financial failure for the band, which was forced through legal action to pay back the money used for both the recording of Albert Bouchard&#x27;s solo album and for the re-recording of &quot;Imaginos&quot;. It was their last album to enter the Billboard charts until &quot;The Symbol Remains&quot; in 2020.

==Influence==
The manga &quot;Battle Angel Alita&quot; by Yukito Kishiro contains references to &quot;Imaginos&quot;. Particularly the name of the principal villain - Desty Nova - and the cyber-body of Alita, called imaginos.

In 2021, Canadian rock critic Martin Popoff released a book on the &quot;Imaginos&quot; mythos entitled &quot;Flaming Telepaths: Imaginos Expanded and Specified&quot;.

==Albert Bouchard&#x27;s new version==
In the spring of 2020, an announcement was made on www.goldminemag.com that Albert Bouchard would be releasing &quot;ReImaginos&quot;, his own reinvention of the concept of &quot;Imaginos&quot;, in the fall of 2020. Bouchard eventually released 3 albums based on the concept: &quot;ReImaginos&quot; (2020), &quot;Imaginos II - Bombs Over Germany (Minus Zero And Counting)&quot; (2021), and &quot;Imaginos III - Mutant Reformation&quot; (2023).

<text>In geometry, the Minkowski sum of two sets of position vectors &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; in Euclidean space is formed by adding each vector in &quot;A&quot; to each vector in &quot;B&quot;:

formula_1

The Minkowski difference (also &quot;Minkowski subtraction&quot;, &quot;Minkowski decomposition&quot;, or &quot;geometric difference&quot;) is the corresponding inverse, where formula_2 produces a set that could be summed with &quot;B&quot; to recover &quot;A&quot;. This is defined as the complement of the Minkowski sum of the complement of &quot;A&quot; with the reflection of &quot;B&quot; about the origin.

formula_3

This definition allows a symmetrical relationship between the Minkowski sum and difference. Note that alternately taking the sum and difference with &quot;B&quot; is not necessarily equivalent. The sum can fill gaps which the difference may not re-open, and the difference can erase small islands which the sum cannot recreate from nothing.

formula_4

In 2D image processing the Minkowski sum and difference are known as dilation and erosion.

An alternative definition of the Minkowski difference is sometimes used for computing intersection of convex shapes. This is not equivalent to the previous definition, and is not an inverse of the sum operation. Instead it replaces the vector addition of the Minkowski sum with a vector subtraction. If the two convex shapes intersect, the resulting set will contain the origin.

formula_5

The concept is named for Hermann Minkowski.

== Example ==

For example, if we have two sets &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, each consisting of three position vectors (informally, three points), representing the vertices of two triangles in formula_6, with coordinates

formula_7

and

formula_8

then their Minkowski sum is

formula_9

which comprises the vertices of a hexagon and its center.

For Minkowski addition, the , formula_10 containing only the zero vector, 0, is an identity element: for every subset &quot;S&quot; of a vector space,

formula_11

The empty set is important in Minkowski addition, because the empty set annihilates every other subset: for every subset &quot;S&quot; of a vector space, its sum with the empty set is empty:

formula_12

For another example, consider the Minkowski sums of open or closed balls in the field formula_13 which is either the real numbers formula_14 or complex numbers formula_15. If formula_16 is the closed ball of radius formula_17 centered at formula_18 in formula_19 then for any formula_20, formula_21 and also formula_22 will hold for any scalar formula_23 such that the product formula_24 is defined (which happens when formula_25 or formula_26). If formula_27, formula_28, and formula_29 are all non-zero then the same equalities would still hold had formula_30 been defined to be the open ball, rather than the closed ball, centered at 0 (the non-zero assumption is needed because the open ball of radius 0 is the empty set). The Minkowski sum of a closed ball and an open ball is an open ball. More generally, the Minkowski sum of an open subset with other set will be an open subset.

If formula_31 is the graph of formula_32 and if and formula_33 is the formula_34-axis in formula_35 then the Minkowski sum of these two closed subsets of the plane is the open set formula_36 consisting of everything other than the formula_34-axis. This shows that the Minkowski sum of two closed sets is not necessarily a closed set. However, the Minkowski sum of two closed subsets will be a closed subset if at least one of these sets is also a compact subset.

== Convex hulls of Minkowski sums ==
Minkowski addition behaves well with respect to the operation of taking convex hulls, as shown by the following proposition:

This result holds more generally for any finite collection of non-empty sets:

formula_38

In mathematical terminology, the operations of Minkowski summation and of forming convex hulls are commuting operations.

If formula_39 is a convex set then formula_40 is also a convex set; furthermore

formula_41

for every formula_42. Conversely, if this &quot;distributive property&quot; holds for all non-negative real numbers, formula_43 and formula_44, then the set is convex.
The figure to the right shows an example of a non-convex set for which formula_45

An example in one dimension is: formula_46 It can be easily calculated that formula_47 but formula_48 hence again formula_49

Minkowski sums act linearly on the perimeter of two-dimensional convex bodies: the perimeter of the sum equals the sum of perimeters. Additionally, if formula_50 is (the interior of) a curve of constant width, then the Minkowski sum of formula_50 and of its 180° rotation is a disk. These two facts can be combined to give a short proof of Barbier&#x27;s theorem on the perimeter of curves of constant width.

== Applications ==
Minkowski addition plays a central role in mathematical morphology. It arises in the brush-and-stroke paradigm of 2D computer graphics (with various uses, notably by Donald E. Knuth in Metafont), and as the solid sweep operation of 3D computer graphics. It has also been shown to be closely connected to the Earth mover&#x27;s distance, and by extension, optimal transport.

=== Motion planning ===
Minkowski sums are used in motion planning of an object among obstacles. They are used for the computation of the configuration space, which is the set of all admissible positions of the object. In the simple model of translational motion of an object in the plane, where the position of an object may be uniquely specified by the position of a fixed point of this object, the configuration space are the Minkowski sum of the set of obstacles and the movable object placed at the origin and rotated 180 degrees.

=== Numerical control (NC) machining ===
In numerical control machining, the programming of the NC tool exploits the fact that the Minkowski sum of the cutting piece with its trajectory gives the shape of the cut in the material.

=== 3D solid modeling ===
In OpenSCAD Minkowski sums are used to outline a shape with another shape creating a composite of both shapes.

=== Aggregation theory ===
Minkowski sums are also frequently used in aggregation theory when individual objects to be aggregated are characterized via sets.

=== Collision detection ===
Minkowski sums, specifically Minkowski differences, are often used alongside GJK algorithms to compute collision detection for convex hulls in physics engines.

== Algorithms for computing Minkowski sums ==
=== Planar case ===
==== Two convex polygons in the plane ====
For two convex polygons and in the plane with and vertices, their Minkowski sum is a convex polygon with at most + vertices and may be computed in time O( + ) by a very simple procedure, which may be informally described as follows. Assume that the edges of a polygon are given and the direction, say, counterclockwise, along the polygon boundary. Then it is easily seen that these edges of the convex polygon are ordered by polar angle. Let us merge the ordered sequences of the directed edges from and into a single ordered sequence . Imagine that these edges are solid arrows which can be moved freely while keeping them parallel to their original direction. Assemble these arrows in the order of the sequence by attaching the tail of the next arrow to the head of the previous arrow. It turns out that the resulting polygonal chain will in fact be a convex polygon which is the Minkowski sum of and .

==== Other ====
If one polygon is convex and another one is not, the complexity of their Minkowski sum is O(&quot;nm&quot;). If both of them are nonconvex, their Minkowski sum complexity is O((&quot;mn&quot;)2).

== Essential Minkowski sum ==
There is also a notion of the essential Minkowski sum +e of two subsets of Euclidean space. The usual Minkowski sum can be written as

formula_52

Thus, the essential Minkowski sum is defined by

formula_53

where &quot;μ&quot; denotes the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Lebesgue measure. The reason for the term &quot;essential&quot; is the following property of indicator functions: while

formula_54

it can be seen that

formula_55

where &quot;ess sup&quot; denotes the essential supremum.

== &quot;Lp&quot; Minkowski sum ==
For &quot;K&quot; and &quot;L&quot; compact convex subsets in formula_56, the Minkowski sum can be described by the support function of the convex sets:

formula_57

For &quot;p&quot; ≥ 1, Firey defined the &quot;L&quot;&quot;p&quot; Minkowski sum of compact convex sets &quot;K&quot; and &quot;L&quot; in formula_58 containing the origin as

formula_59

By the Minkowski inequality, the function &quot;h&quot; is again positive homogeneous and convex and hence the support function of a compact convex set. This definition is fundamental in the &quot;L&quot;&quot;p&quot; Brunn-Minkowski theory.

<doc id="504109" wikidata="Q1591095" url="?curid=504109" title="Hausdorff measure">
<text>In mathematics, Hausdorff measure is a generalization of the traditional notions of area and volume to non-integer dimensions, specifically fractals and their Hausdorff dimensions. It is a type of outer measure, named for Felix Hausdorff, that assigns a number in [0,∞] to each set in formula_1 or, more generally, in any metric space.

The zero-dimensional Hausdorff measure is the number of points in the set (if the set is finite) or ∞ if the set is infinite. Likewise, the one-dimensional Hausdorff measure of a simple curve in formula_1 is equal to the length of the curve, and the two-dimensional Hausdorff measure of a Lebesgue-measurable subset of formula_3 is proportional to the area of the set. Thus, the concept of the Hausdorff measure generalizes the Lebesgue measure and its notions of counting, length, and area. It also generalizes volume. In fact, there are &quot;d&quot;-dimensional Hausdorff measures for any &quot;d&quot; ≥ 0, which is not necessarily an integer. These measures are fundamental in geometric measure theory. They appear naturally in harmonic analysis or potential theory.

==Definition==
Let formula_4 be a metric space. For any subset formula_5, let formula_6 denote its diameter, that is

:formula_7

Let formula_8 be any subset of formula_9 and formula_10 a real number. Define

:formula_11

where the infimum is over all countable covers of formula_8 by sets formula_13 satisfying formula_14.

Note that formula_15 is monotone nonincreasing in formula_16 since the larger formula_17 is, the more collections of sets are permitted, making the infimum not larger. Thus, formula_18 exists but may be infinite. Let

:formula_19

It can be seen that formula_20 is an outer measure (more precisely, it is a metric outer measure). By Carathéodory&#x27;s extension theorem, its restriction to the σ-field of Carathéodory-measurable sets is a measure. It is called the formula_21-dimensional Hausdorff measure of formula_8. Due to the metric outer measure property, all Borel subsets of formula_23 are formula_24 measurable.

In the above definition the sets in the covering are arbitrary. However, we can require the covering sets to be open or closed, or in normed spaces even convex, that will yield the same formula_15 numbers, hence the same measure. In formula_1 restricting the covering sets to be balls may change the measures but does not change the dimension of the measured sets.

==Properties of Hausdorff measures==

Note that if &quot;d&quot; is a positive integer, the &quot;d&quot;-dimensional Hausdorff measure of formula_27 is a rescaling of the usual &quot;d&quot;-dimensional Lebesgue measure formula_28, which is normalized so that the Lebesgue measure of the unit cube [0,1]&quot;d&quot; is 1. In fact, for any Borel set &quot;E&quot;,

:formula_29

where α&quot;d&quot; is the volume of the unit &quot;d&quot;-ball; it can be expressed using Euler&#x27;s gamma function

:formula_30

This is 
:formula_31,
where formula_32 is the volume of the unit diameter &quot;d&quot;-ball.

Remark. Some authors adopt a definition of Hausdorff measure slightly different from the one chosen here, the difference being that the value formula_33 defined above is multiplied by the factor formula_34, so that Hausdorff &quot;d&quot;-dimensional measure coincides exactly with Lebesgue measure in the case of Euclidean space.

==Relation with Hausdorff dimension==
It turns out that formula_20 may have a finite, nonzero value for at most one formula_21. That is, the Hausdorff Measure is zero for any value above a certain dimension and infinity below a certain dimension, analogous to the idea that the area of a line is zero and the length of a 2D shape is in some sense infinity. This leads to one of several possible equivalent definitions of the Hausdorff dimension:
:formula_37
where we take
formula_38
and
formula_39.

Note that it is not guaranteed that the Hausdorff measure must be finite and nonzero for some &quot;d&quot;, and indeed the measure at the Hausdorff dimension may still be zero; in this case, the Hausdorff dimension still acts as a change point between measures of zero and infinity.

==Generalizations==
In geometric measure theory and related fields, the Minkowski content is often used to measure the size of a subset of a metric measure space. For suitable domains in Euclidean space, the two notions of size coincide, up to overall normalizations depending on conventions. More precisely, a subset of formula_1 is said to be formula_41-rectifiable if it is the image of a bounded set in formula_42 under a Lipschitz function. If formula_43, then the formula_41-dimensional Minkowski content of a closed formula_41-rectifiable subset of formula_1 is equal to formula_47 times the formula_41-dimensional Hausdorff measure .

In fractal geometry, some fractals with Hausdorff dimension formula_21 have zero or infinite formula_21-dimensional Hausdorff measure. For example, almost surely the image of planar Brownian motion has Hausdorff dimension 2 and its two-dimensional Hausdorff measure is zero. In order to &quot;measure&quot; the &quot;size&quot; of such sets, the following variation on the notion of the Hausdorff measure can be considered:

:In the definition of the measure formula_51 is replaced with formula_52 where formula_53 is any monotone increasing function satisfying formula_54

This is the Hausdorff measure of formula_8 with gauge function formula_56 or formula_53-Hausdorff measure. A formula_21-dimensional set formula_8 may satisfy formula_60 but formula_61 with an appropriate formula_62 Examples of gauge functions include

:formula_63

The former gives almost surely positive and formula_64-finite measure to the Brownian path in formula_1 when formula_66, and the latter when formula_67.

<text>La Perouse is a suburb in the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. The suburb of La Perouse is located about southeast of the Sydney central business district, in the City of Randwick.

The La Perouse peninsula is the northern headland of Botany Bay. It is notable for its old military outpost at Bare Island and the Kamay Botany Bay National Park. Congwong Bay Beach, Little Congwong Beach, and the beach at Frenchmans Bay provide protected swimming areas in Botany Bay. La Perouse is one of few Sydney suburbs with a French name, others being Sans Souci and Vaucluse. Kurnell is located opposite, on the southern headland of Botany Bay.

==History==

La Perouse was known as &quot;Gooriwal&quot; to the Muruora-dial people of the area. The Gameygal or Kameygal clan of the Dharug people probably lived between the mouth of the Cooks River and present-day La Perouse, including the La Perouse area.

La Perouse was named after the French navigator Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse (1741–88), who landed on the northern shore of Botany Bay west of Bare Island on 26 January 1788. Captain Arthur Phillip and the first fleet of convicts had arrived in Botany Bay a few days earlier. Louis XVI of France had commissioned Lapérouse to explore the Pacific. In April 1770 James Cook&#x27;s expedition had sailed onto the east coast of Australia whilst exploring the south Pacific searching for Terra Australis or ‘Land of the South’. Upon King Louis XVI&#x27;s orders, Lapérouse departed Brest, France, in command of the and on 1 August 1785 on a scientific voyage of the Pacific inspired by the voyages of Cook. La Perouse in Sydney&#x27;s south is named after the leader of this French expedition.
Lapérouse&#x27;s two ships sailed to New South Wales after 12 of his men had been attacked and killed in the Navigator Islands (Samoa). &quot;Astrolabe&quot; and &quot;Boussole&quot; arrived off Botany Bay on 24 January just six days after Captain Arthur Phillip (1738–1814) had anchored just west of Bare Island, in . On 26 January 1788, as Captain John Hunter was moving the First Fleet around to Port Jackson after finding Botany Bay unsuitable for a Settlement, Lapérouse was sailing into Botany Bay, anchoring there just eight days after the British had.

The British received Lapérouse courteously and offered him any assistance he might need. The French were far better provisioned than the British were, and extended the same courtesy but neither offer was accepted. The commander of the Fleet, Captain Phillip, ordered that two British naval vessels, and &quot;Supply&quot;, meet the French. Contrary to popular belief, the French did not have orders to claim &quot;Terra Australis&quot; for France and the arrival of the French ships &quot;Astrolabe&quot; and &quot;Boussole&quot; and their meeting with the ships of the British expedition was cordial and followed normal protocols. Lapérouse subsequently sent his journals and letters to Europe with the British ship, the &quot;Sirius&quot;.

The expedition&#x27;s naturalist and chaplain, Father Louis Receveur, died in February after a skirmish the previous December in Samoa with the inhabitants, in which Paul Antoine Fleuriot de Langle, commander of &quot;Astrolabe&quot; and 12 other members of the French expedition were killed. Receveur, injured in that skirmish, died at Botany Bay and was buried at Frenchmans Cove below the headland that is now called La Perouse, not far from the Lapérouse Museum. The place was marked by a tin plate but the local Aboriginal people quickly removed it. The British replaced it with another and tended the site. In 1824, the tree was inscribed by Victor-Charles Lottin (1781–1846), an ensign visiting with Louis Isidore Duperrey. The following year, Hyacinthe de Bougainville paid for the tombstone that is on the site today. It was designed by Government Architect George Cookney (1799–1876). Receveur was the second European to be buried on the East Coast of Australia, the first being Forby Sutherland from Cook&#x27;s 1770 expedition who is buried at nearby Kurnell on the other side of the Botany Bay headlands.

The French stayed at Botany Bay for six weeks and built a stockade, observatory and garden for fresh produce on what is now known as the La Perouse peninsula. After completing the building of a longboat (to replace one lost in the attack in the Navigator Islands) and obtaining wood and water, the French departed for New Caledonia, Santa Cruz, the Solomons, and the Louisiades. Lapérouse wrote in his journals that he expected to be back in France by December 1788, but the two ships vanished. The last official sighting of the French expedition was in March 1788 when British lookouts stationed at the South Head of Port Jackson saw the expedition sail from Botany Bay. The French expedition was wrecked a short time later on the reefs of Vanikoro in the Solomon Islands during a cyclone sometime during April or May 1788, the circumstances remained a mystery for 40 years. Some of the mystery was solved in 1826 when items associated with the French ships were found on an island in the Santa Cruz group, with wreckage of the ships themselves discovered in 1964.

More recently two major expeditions have been mounted to explore the sites in Vanikoro. In May 2005, the wreck was formally identified as that of the &quot;Boussole&quot;. The 2005 expedition was embarked aboard , a French naval vessel. The ship supported a multi-discipline scientific team to investigate the &quot;Mystery of Lapérouse&quot;. The mission was called &quot;Opération Vanikoro-Sur les traces des épaves de Lapérouse 2005&quot;.
A further similar mission was mounted in 2008. Between 16 September and 15 October 2008 two French Navy boats set out from Nouméa (New Caledonia) for a voyage to Vanikoro, recreating that section of the final journey of discovery made by Lapérouse.

=== Early subdivision plans ===

==Historic structures==


The first building in the area was the octagonal stone tower constructed in 1820–22 as accommodation for a small guard of soldiers stationed there to prevent smuggling, and the tower still stands today. By 1885, an Aboriginal reserve had been established in the suburb and a number of missions were operated in the area. The original church was dismantled and moved to the corner of Elaroo and Adina Avenues, where it still stands.
It is known as the La Perouse Mission Church.

A kiosk was built in 1896 to cater for tourists who came to see the attractions, including snake-handling shows. During the Great Depression, from the late 1920s, many severely affected low-income families took up residence here in settlements beside the Aboriginal reserve.

The small island just inside the heads was described by Captain James Cook as &quot;a small bare island&quot;. Bare Island was fortified in 1885, according to a design by colonial architect, James Barnet (1827–1904), and fitted with heavy guns. In 1912 Bare Island became a retirement home for war veterans, which continued to operate until 1963, when it was handed over to the New South Wales Parks and Wildlife Service for use as a museum and tourist attraction.

Apart from the fortification on Bare Island two other fortifications are located within La Perouse, one of them, Fort Banks is located on Cape Banks. This facility was part of the Eastern Command Fixed Defences unit, it was designed and positioned in a way that would allow it to protect the approaches to Botany Bay in the event of a sea born attack during the World War II period. Henry Head Battery, constructed 1892–1895, operated until 1910, when the fort became obsolete. The battery along with two gun-emplacements and observation posts was recommissioned for use during the second World War.

== Heritage listings ==
La Perouse has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Bare Island Fort
* 46 Adina Avenue: La Perouse Mission Church
* 1-39 Bunnerong Road: Chinese Market Gardens (La Perouse)

===Trams===
The former La Perouse tram line branched from Oxford Street at Taylor Square in Darlinghurst to run south along Flinders Street, then into its own tram reservation along the eastern side of Anzac Parade beside Moore Park. It then proceeded down the centre of Anzac Parade through Maroubra Junction, and Malabar to its balloon loop terminus at La Perouse. At Malabar, a single line branched off to serve Long Bay Gaol. The line was double track throughout. The line reached La Perouse in stages from 1900 to 1902. The Loop is the circular track that was built as part of the Sydney tram terminus at La Perouse. Closure was supported by the NRMA, but generally went against public opinion. Nevertheless, closure became Labor government policy and the system was wound down in stages, with withdrawal of the last service, to La Perouse in 1961. The line followed the current route of Transdev John Holland bus route 394X.

==Transport==
===Ferries===
Wharves are being built at La Perouse and southward at Kurnell, for a ferry service between them.
==Demographics==
According to the of Population, there were 366 people in La Perouse.
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 32.2% of the population. 
* 69.1% of people were born in Australia and 77.9% of people spoke only English at home.
* The most common response for religion was No Religion (30.9% of the population).

==Attractions==

The La Perouse Museum contains maps, scientific instruments and relics recovered from French explorers. A walking trail from the museum to the Endeavour Lighthouse has views across the bay to the site of Captain Cook&#x27;s Landing Place. The large Lapérouse Monument is an obelisk erected in 1825 by the French, located close to the museum. Another memorial marks the grave of Father Receveur. The fortified Bare Island is linked by a footbridge. The museum was originally built as cable station to house the operation of the first submarine telegraph communications cable laid between Australia and Nelson in New Zealand. This cable also served as the first link in telegraph communications between New Zealand and the rest of the world. After the cessation of telegraph communications, the building served as a home for orphans run by the Salvation Army, with the children attending La Perouse Public School when this first opened in the early 1950s.

Visitors can learn about the Indigenous significance of the area from the Aboriginal people of the area, with boomerang-throwing demonstrations often held on weekends and Aboriginal guided tours operating from Yarra Bay House during the week. Aboriginal artefacts are produced and sold by locals. The Snake Man of La Perouse has an outdoor reptile show is also a tourist attraction in the pit, at The Loop, on Sunday afternoons. The reptile shows were begun by the legendary Professor Fox in the late 19th century and resumed by George Cann just after the Great War in 1918. The tradition was continued by members of the Cann family, until recently, and other snake handlers since.

La Perouse has a few cafés and restaurants around the historic precinct, close to Frenchmans Bay.

The New South Wales Golf Club, a linksstyle golf course, is at La Perouse, facing both Botany Bay and the Tasman Sea.

==Scuba diving==
The area around the La Perouse peninsula is considered to be one of the best scuba diving sites in NSW. Bare Island has a number of dive sites, some of which extend to over 19 metres in depth. The reef around the area is extensive. There are also a number of dives around the mainland at La Perouse. Scuba divers here can see the common (weedy) sea dragon, pygmy pipefish, big-belly seahorses and other fish common in the Sydney area.

Little Congwong Beach is popular for snorkeling, and it has also been used for decades as an unofficial nude beach.

==In popular culture==
* Several scenes from &quot;&quot; (2000) were filmed in La Perouse, including Bare Island.

== Notable residents ==
*Kevin Longbottom, (1940−1986), rugby league player 
*Lola Ryan (1925−2003), shellworker
*Emma Timbery (c. 1842−1916), Aboriginal shellworker and matriarch
*Esme Timbery (1931–2023), shellworker

<text>Bondi Junction is an eastern suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. It is 6 kilometres east of the Sydney central business district and is part of the local government area of Waverley.

Bondi Junction is a largely commercial area which has undergone many changes since the late 20th century. There have been many major commercial and residential developments around the main street and surrounding area, notably a new bus/rail interchange and large shopping mall. Many of the original pubs have been maintained, notably, the Nelson Hotel, so named because of its location on Nelson Street. Bondi Beach is a neighbouring suburb to the east with its namesake beach. Similarly named Bondi and North Bondi are also neighbouring suburbs.

Bondi Junction and the neighbouring area is well known for its famous rugby league team, the Sydney Roosters, still officially known as the Eastern Suburbs District Rugby League Football Club.

==History==
===Pre-colonial times and name origin===
Before the arrival of Europeans in the Port Jackson area, the Waverley and Bondi areas were inhabited for tens of thousands of years by Aboriginal Australian peoples, who left evidence of their habitation in the form of paths, rock carvings, artefacts, and shelters. The eastern beaches were home to the Bidjigal, Birrabirragal, and Gadigal people. 

The name &quot;Bondi&quot; is derived from the Dharawal language, spoken by the Aboriginal clans who lived further from Sydney Harbour southwards to Shoalhaven. The word &quot;Bondi&quot;, also spelt &quot;Bundi&quot;, &quot;Bundye&quot;, and &quot;Boondye&quot;, originates from the word for a loud thud, such as the sound of waves breaking over rocks, but is also associated with &quot;nulla nulla&quot;, or fighting sticks, which make a loud noise when they hit something.

===19th century===
The first house in the area was Waverley House, which was built by Barnett Levey in 1827, on the current site of Waverley Street. The house changed hands many times over the years before finally being demolished in 1904. When Waverley Municipality was proclaimed in 1859, the name was taken from Waverley House.

Henry Hough was first given a grant of land on the present site of Bondi Junction in 1832. On his estate, he built a wind-powered flour mill. This was accessed by a track leading off the South Head Road (now Oxford Street), the suburb&#x27;s main thoroughfare.

In 1854, the first hotel in the area opened, licensed to Alexander Gray. It was named &quot;The Waverley Tea Gardens&quot;, and the surrounding area quickly took that name, quickly shortened to simply &quot;Tea Gardens&quot;, which stuck for the next 30 years, before being named Bondi Junction after the trams arrived in 1881. 

In 1858, the first official post office was opened, and the first school in 1879.

By 1878 steam had supplanted wind in milling and the estate was closed. In May 1881, it was subdivided. Streets in this subdivision that exist today are Mill Hill Road and Hough Street. The subdivision of the estate coincided with the opening of the first tramway to the area – steam trams began operation from Taylor Square in Darlinghurst on 12 March 1881.

A tramline was built to the Bondi Beach area in 1881, with a crossing loop line following in 1882 and the tramway junction off the Waverley line opened on 24 May 1884. The suburb acquired its name at this time.

===20th century===
With the subdivision of surrounding suburbs complete by 1930, Bondi Junction quickly grew into a major entertainment and commercial centre.

Tram lines ran to Bondi Beach via Birriga Road, Bondi Beach via Bondi Road, Bronte Beach and The Spot, Randwick and the City at Circular Quay and Central railway station. A tram depot was established on the corner of South Head Road (renamed Oxford Street with the completion of widening works in Darlinghurst) and the present day York Road. Oxford Street quickly became crowded and congested. By the 1960s traffic was at the point that Bondi Junction was one of the worst bottlenecks in Sydney. The Eastern Suburbs railway line, terminating at Bondi Junction, was opened in 1979.

===21st century===
The suburb was historically divided by the border of Waverley and Woollahra councils. In 2002, the boundary was realigned from Oxford Street to the bypass road (see below), giving Waverley Council full control of the commercial areas of the suburb.

In April 2024, Joel Cauchi perpetrated a mass stabbing at Westfield Bondi Junction before being shot dead by police.

===Star Theatre===
In 1917 the first theatre in the area, named Star Theatre, was opened, situated on a triangular plot bounded by Bronte Road, Brisbane Street, and Ebley Street. This was demolished 10 years later, and a second Star Theatre opened in 1928. The 2,400-seat theatre was operated by Olympic Theatres until Hoyts purchased it in 1935. Architects Charles Bohringer &amp; Associates (who also remodelled the Enmore Theatre in 1937) redesigned the cinema in an Art Deco style before it was reopened in 1938. It became the largest and most popular cinema in the area, and was at one time one of the biggest suburban cinemas in New South Wales.

In 1954 the Star was equipped with a new CinemaScope screen. It was renamed the Hoyts Horror House for a short period in 1973. Hoyts sold the theatre in 1977, and it closed after &quot;Salon Kitty&quot; was screened on 8 February 1977.

The building reopened the in 1978 as the Star Rock Concert, and started showing films, but it closed permanently later in the year and was demolished in 1981.

==Transport==
Bondi Junction railway station is an underground station that is also the eastern terminus of the Eastern Suburbs railway line on the Sydney Trains network. The station is also the terminus of limited South Coast Line services. A bus interchange is located at ground level, above the railway station and below residential towers.

The Sydney tram network was closed in 1961 and the Waverley Tram Depot converted to a bus depot. This temporarily reduced the traffic problem in the area ; but, the rise of the private motor vehicle soon made the problem acute. A railway to Sydney&#x27;s eastern suburbs was first proposed by John Young, Mayor of Sydney in the 1870s. This was subsequently incorporated into the Bradfield Scheme for improving Sydney&#x27;s railways. The line was never built as Bradfield envisaged, however.

In 1976, with construction of the railway underway and the NSW Government resolving to actually complete the project as far as Bondi Junction, construction was also begun on an elevated freeway-standard bypass of Bondi Junction. The Bondi Junction Bypass (later renamed Syd Einfeld Drive after the notable local man and one-time Member for Phillip), unlike the railway, was constructed quickly, opening on 6 January 1979. The road runs around the northern side of the business district from Oxford Street at Ocean Street to Oxford Street at Bondi Road and is elevated at about five metres above the ground. It is constructed as a continuous concrete plank bridge. The freeway is, in fact, the only section ever built of a much longer planned road known as the Eastern Freeway, a proposed freeway abandoned in the 1960s, which would have travelled between the Sydney CBD and Bondi.

With the railway opening in June 1979, major changes to traffic flow were made in Bondi Junction. The main thoroughfare, Oxford Street, became devoted to buses only between Adelaide Street and Bronte Road and a pedestrian mall was created between Bronte Road and Newland Street, known as Bondi Junction Mall. The opening of the railway provided the opportunity to rationalise bus services in the Eastern Suburbs, with most city services eliminated or terminated at the new Bondi Junction Bus–Rail Interchange.

In 1998, Woollahra Council, which controlled the site of the bus interchange, finalised an agreement to sell the airspace above the site to Meriton Apartments. Construction began in April 1999 for a new bus interchange and two residential apartment towers of over 70 m high. While this took place, upgrade works were also performed on Bondi Junction railway station. The new interchange was tentatively opened in September 2000 for the Sydney Olympics but subsequently closed for further work. The new bus interchange opened in July 2001.

==Economy==
=== Retail and shopping ===

Westfield Bondi Junction is a major mid to upmarket shopping centre opposite Bondi Junction railway station on the corner of Grosvenor and Oxford Street. There are also two smaller shopping centre nearby, Eastgate Bondi Junction located below the &quot;Eastgate&quot; residential apartment development and a shopping centre above the station and bus interchange known as Meriton Retail Precinct Bondi Junction. Oxford Street is a major commercial centre in Bondi Junction as it contains numerous businesses including hotels and shops from the York Street end to Old South Head Road. Oxford Street Mall is a pedestrian zone between Bronte Road and Newland Street and contains numerous shops and cafes. There are also shops along Spring Street, Ebley Street and Bronte Road.

===High-density developments and housing===
Bondi Junction is Sydney&#x27;s fifth largest business district behind the CBD itself, North Sydney, Parramatta and Chatswood. Typical development in the commercial area consists of strip-mall type development two or three levels high. However, over the last 35 years, at least twenty buildings of 12 levels or higher have been constructed including Bondi Junction Private Hospital

The first large development was the Eastern Suburbs Leagues Club (&quot;Easts&quot;), the local rugby league club for the Eastern Suburbs Roosters.

In the 1980s, following the completion of the Eastern Suburbs Railway, commercial development reached a peak with several office buildings built in the centre of Bondi Junction. By the 1990s, these were mostly displaced by residential developments.

Bondi Junction features high density residential developments close to the commercial centre and low density housing further away. Domestic architecture includes Victorian and Federation designs.

<text>New Barnet is a neighbourhood on the north east side of the London Borough of Barnet. It is a largely residential North London suburb located east of Chipping Barnet, west of Cockfosters, south of the village of Monken Hadley and north of Oakleigh Park.

Residential properties include a mix of late Victorian villas and terraces, Edwardian detached housing, 1950-60s council housing and the redevelopment of land to low storey flats in the 1980s and 1990s. The north edge of New Barnet borders Monken Hadley Common, a common mostly made up of woods and cut by walking paths.

The main commercial area in New Barnet is east of New Barnet railway station on East Barnet Road. The high street is dominated by a medium-sized Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket with parking on top and is surrounded by a cluster of shops and facilities including Fayers, Just Add Water, PureGym, Tesco Express, Majestic Wine, Screwfix, Bikestrobe, Ink n Toner and Bodens Performing Arts. Several independent cafés also exist on the high street.

A number of office blocks were built in Station Road to the west of the station in the 1960s and 70s however many have now been converted to flats. In the past Station Approach in New Barnet was the home of CompShop which produced the pioneering UK101 kit microcomputer.

Public houses in New Barnet include The Railway Tavern, The Railway Bell (Wetherspoons), The Builders Arms, and The Lord Kitchener.

==History==
New Barnet owes its conception to the building of the Great Northern Railway in 1850, when a station serving High Barnet was built, but located about a mile away from the town centre of High Barnet, so that this &#x27;new&#x27; area quickly saw development: 

In 1876, &quot;Handbook to the Environs of London&quot; by James Thorne describe New Barnet as one of those new half-finished railway villages that we have come to look on as almost a necessary adjunct of every station within a moderate distance of London.New Barnet&#x27;s growth accelerated at the turn of the 19th Century aided by the speculative developer, E. Fergusson Taylor, who became known as the creator of New Barnet.

In 1892 a town hall was built for the local board and from 1894 New Barnet formed part of the East Barnet Urban District of Hertfordshire until 1965 when it was transferred from Hertfordshire to Greater London to become part of the newly created London Borough of Barnet. The War Memorial was built opposite the Town Hall in 1921 to remember the 278 men of East Barnet who died in World War 1.

In 2019 a new Leisure Centre in New Barnet was completed by Barnet council including a 25m pool and gym. The Leisure Centre is run by the not-for-profit provider Better.

<doc id="504119" wikidata="Q1578103" url="?curid=504119" title="Pasteur station (Paris Métro)">
<text>Pasteur () is a station on Line 6 and Line 12 of the Paris Métro in the 15th arrondissement. It is named after the French chemist Louis Pasteur. The platforms for both lines are situated underground, although Line 6 becomes elevated as it approaches northwest end of the station. Nearby are the Pasteur Institute (research facility) and the Lycée Buffon (school).

==Location==
The station is located at the intersection of Rue de Vaugirard and Boulevard Pasteur. On Line 6, the station is the first one underground on line from Charles de Gaulle–Étoile, after a long viaduct starting at Passy metro station.

==History==

The station opened on 24 April 1906 following the extension of line 2 Sud from Passy to Place d&#x27;Italie. On 14 October 1907 &quot;line 2 Sud&quot; became part of line 5. On 12 October 1942 the section of line 5 between Étoile and &quot;Place d&#x27;Italie&quot;, including &quot;Pasteur&quot; was rerouted from line 5 to line 6 in order to separate the tracks underground, as well as was elevated in certain sections (because these sections more vulnerable to air attack during World War II).

The line 12 platforms opened on 5 November 1910 as part of the original section of the Nord-Sud Company&#x27;s line A between Porte de Versailles and Notre-Dame-de-Lorette. On 27 March 1931 line A became line 12 of the &quot;Paris Métro&quot;.

The station is named after the &quot;Boulevard Pasteur&quot;, which is named after Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) renowned French microbiologist and chemist.

It was the location of the &quot;Barrière de Vaugirard&quot;, a gate built for the collection of taxation as part of the Wall of the Farmers-General; the gate was built between 1784 and 1788 and demolished during the nineteenth century.

The station was seen in the film &quot;Alice et Martin&quot; when the character of Alice (played by Juliette Binoche) looks out the window of a train as it descends underground.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
There are two entrances:
* the first, on the central median of Boulevard Pasteur, south of Rue de Vaugirard;
* the second, on the Boulevard Pasteur, north of Rue de Vaugirard.

The entrance of the North-South line is wrought iron, typical of this line, while the other entrance is in a Guimard style (1909, registered as a historical monument).

===Station layout===

===Platforms===
The main theme of this station is Health. The platforms of Line 12 present research work led by Louis Pasteur. They are arranged in the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; orange style, with lighting strips and tunnel exits in this colour. The benches are of bevelled white tiling, unique case, and the seats are &quot;Motte&quot; white. The tiling and the North-South ceramics are however well preserved (advertising frames and frame of the station name is of a green colour, with green geometrical designs on the walls and the roof). This station, the station at Porte de Versailles (on the same line) and Porte de Clichy (on line 13) are only three stations on the network to mix these two decorative styles.

The platforms of Line 6 are decorated in the &quot;Bruno-Gaudin&quot; style (2000 metro revival) with bevelled white tiling, rounded white lighting strips, white ceramic advertising frames, beige &quot;Akiko&quot; seats and the station name on enamelled plate in Parisine font.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by Lines 39, 70, 89 and 95 of the RATP Bus Network and, at night, by Lines N13 and N62 of the Noctilien network.

<doc id="504121" wikidata="Q3496549" url="?curid=504121" title="Hurstville, New South Wales">
<text>Hurstville is a suburb in Southern Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It is south of the Sydney CBD and is part of the St George area. Hurstville is the administrative centre of the local government area of the Georges River Council.

The suburb is predominantly Asian Australian in character, with 63% of the population of Asian origin, among the highest in the country. Sometimes described as &quot;Sydney&#x27;s Real Chinatown&quot;, an estimated 37% of residents are immigrants from mainland China.

==History==
The name Hurstville is derived from the English &#x27;&#x27;, meaning &#x27;a wooded eminence&#x27;, and &#x27;&#x27;, meaning &#x27;town&#x27;.

===Aboriginal culture===
Although it is unknown when they first settled in the Hurstville area, the first inhabitants were Indigenous Australians. At the time of the arrival of the First Fleet, the Indigenous Australians residing in the area were of the Eora tribe, whose numbers spanned along the Georges River, from Botany Bay to present-day Liverpool.

===European settlement===
The first sustained contact between members of the First Fleet and the Eora tribe occurred on 20 January 1788 within the boundaries of the present City of Hurstville at Lugarno and Oatley, at Lime Kiln Bay on the Georges River, as recorded by Lieutenant Philip Gidley King in his diary. While Governor Philip explored the south side of the Georges River around Como, King with a party of one other officer and three marines in a six-oared rowboat aimed for the highest point they could see on the north side, probably at Lugarno, and landed at a place they named Lance Point. Although first contact with the Indigenous Australians led to a small altercation where a spear was thrown and a shot fired, later in the day when the party rowed up Lime Kiln Bay towards present day Mortdale they were greeted in a friendly manner by both men and women, and what could only be described as Australia&#x27;s first picnic took place as food and drink were shared between the two peoples. After a long summer afternoon of mutual contact and conviviality the British sailors rowed back to their ship moored at Botany Bay (see Haworth R.J. 2012, Journal of Australian Colonial History, vol. 14 pp. 1–28, for a reconstruction of King&#x27;s boat journey and likely route).

The land of the Hurstville region was granted by the government of the new colony of New South Wales to two men: Captain John Townson and his brother Robert Townson in 1808. Captain John Townson was granted of land which is now occupied by the suburb of Hurstville and part of Bexley. Robert Townson was granted the land which is now occupied by Penshurst, Mortdale and parts of Peakhurst. In the same year, in the area now known as Riverwood land grants were made to Jane Trotter, Mary Shepley, Charles Doudall, and James Ryan. Later in 1816 another land grant in the same area was given to Mary Redman.

In 1809, Captain John Townson was granted an additional in the area now occupied by Kingsgrove and Beverly Hills. The Townson brothers were not happy with the land that they were given because it was not suitable for the farming of sheep for wool and it is likely that the brothers never occupied their land. In 1812, a wealthy merchant named Simeon Lord bought the land of Captain John Townson and named it &quot;Lord&#x27;s Forest&quot;. When Lord died, the land became the property of John Rose Holden and James Holt of the Bank of NSW.

===Sproule family===
&quot;Gladwyn&quot; is an historic, Italianate house at 96 Queens Road. It was built in 1893 by John Sproule, a local builder and alderman of Hurstville Council, who had acquired the land two years previously. It changed hands many times and was known as &quot;Gladwyn&quot; by 1906. Hurstville Council eventually acquired the house in 1986. It has been restored and adapted for commercial use, as well as serving as the base for the Hurstville Archival Research and Local Studies Centre. It is heritage-listed at state and local level.

In 1895, Ann Sproule bought land on the opposite side of Queens Road from the Winn brothers of Newcastle, New South Wales. John Sproule then built &quot;Yarra-Mundi&quot; in 1897, and lived there until 1904. The house then changed hands a number of times over the years. In 1981 it was acquired by the Danebank Church of England School for Girls. The school later sold the house in 2003 and it was subsequently adapted for commercial use. It is heritage-listed.

===Development===

A dam with a roadway on top was constructed on the Cooks River at Tempe in 1839. In 1843, the road that was to become known as Forest Road was extended from the dam to a hand-winched punt in Lugarno. On the other side of the river, the road continued all the way to Wollongong; however, it was only suitable for travellers on horseback. The new road opened up the Hurstville region and created a settlement at Bottle Forest, now known as Heathcote.

In 1850, the Lord Forest estate was purchased by Michael Gannon (1800–61), who subdivided it into small farms along what is now Croydon Road and three larger farms that were purchased by Dent, Peake, and Ibbotson. The area became known as Gannon&#x27;s Forest. The land originally granted to Robert Townson was purchased by John Connell in 1830 and, following his death in 1849, the estate was inherited by his grandsons, Elias Pearson Laycock and John Connell Laycock.

The Gannon&#x27;s Forest post office opened in 1881. The local school was named &quot;Hurstville&quot; by School Inspector MacIntyre when it was established in 1876. When the railway station opened on 15 October 1884, it took the name Hurstville, from the school. Hurstville municipality was incorporated in 1887 and, in 1988, Hurstville was declared a city. The Centenary Bakery on Forest Road is a historic building that has been preserved and once housed a museum. The St George Regional Museum is now located in another historic building in MacMahon Street.

The Hurstville train crash on 3 August 1920 resulted in five people killed and fifty injured. It involved the collision of two steam trains, one arriving from Central Railway Station, which plunged into the back of the other, which was stationary at Hurstville railway station, bound for Sutherland.

Hurstville&#x27;s residential developments are a mixture of low-density housing, medium-density flats, and high-density apartment buildings.

==Economy==

Hurstville is the central business district of the St George area. It is a large, multiethnic suburb with a multitude of commercial buildings and high-rise residential buildings dominating the skyline.

The commercial area is centred on the main street, Forest Road, on the northern side of Hurstville railway station. Forest Road is the main shopping street which features branches of many retail shops as well as numerous banks (Commonwealth, ANZ, National Australia Bank, Westpac, St George, HSBC, Bank of China) and other financial institutions. The commercial developments also extend to surrounding streets concentrated from Queens Road to The Avenue and on the southern side of Hurstville Railway station, around Ormonde Parade. The commercial developments extend further along Forest Road, west towards Penshurst and east towards Bexley.

===Demographics===

The first European settlers in the area were mostly of British and Irish ancestry. From the late 1960s, Hurstville, like many surrounding areas, became home to migrants from all around the world. The first wave of migrants included Greeks and Italians who began moving south from Sydney&#x27;s inner-city suburbs. They were followed by more European migrants, including many from the former Yugoslavia.

From the 1990s, the Chinese community within Hurstville has grown considerably. Much of this was related to significant migration from Hong Kong during the 1990s and migration from mainland China during the 2000s. Many local businesses are operated by people of Chinese background, the interests of which are advanced by the St. George Asian Business Association. Hurstville is a hub for Asian groceries, food and services.

<text>PartitionMagic is a utility software program for hard disk drive partitioning originally made by PowerQuest, but subsequently owned by Symantec. As of December 8, 2009, the Symantec website stated that they no longer offer PartitionMagic.

The program runs on pre-Vista Microsoft Windows operating systems including Windows 2000 and Windows XP, but the application is incompatible with Windows Vista and later versions (although Microsoft added resizing). In any of these cases, existing partitions can be resized without loss of data.

==Details==

PartitionMagic is capable of resizing NTFS, FAT16 or FAT32 partitions without data loss, and can copy and move partitions, including to other disks. It also has various other features, including being able to convert between FAT16, FAT32 and NTFS, modify the cluster size of FAT16, FAT32 and NTFS filesystems, and merge adjacent FAT or NTFS filesystems (all without data loss, though some NTFS-only metadata is lost on conversion to FAT). Additionally, it had somewhat limited support for ext2 and ext3 partitions. PartitionMagic was the first commercial product of its kind containing patented technology.

The first version of PartitionMagic was released with DOS and OS/2 support. Versions 2–3 were offered with DOS, OS/2 and Windows support. Symantec&#x27;s PartitionMagic version 8 dropped the OS/2 version. Server versions were also offered under the name &quot;Server Magic&quot; for Windows and Novell NetWare servers.

The stable version of PartitionMagic 8.05 also included a rescue floppy disk with an additional DOS version of PartitionMagic. The DOS version (which included DR-DOS or MS-DOS) came on one 2.88 MB or two 1.44 MB floppy disks.

The Windows version of PartitionMagic could also be integrated in BartPE (Bart&#x27;s Preinstalled Environment) a Windows XP based Live CD created by using the PE Builder. To integrate PartitionMagic into BartPE a PE Builder plug-in for PartitionMagic was available.

==History==
PowerQuest&#x27;s Partition Magic originated in 1993; Version 2.0 was available for purchase by January 1995. An OS/2 version was available by September 1995.

Version 3.02 came out in early 1997.

PartitionMagic, while under PowerQuest, was updated regularly, adding new features.

Once Symantec purchased the application in 2003, there were no new releases, and Symantec stated that it had no plans on releasing a new version. As of October 13, 2011, the Symantec website stated, &quot;Sorry, we no longer offer Norton Partition Magic.&quot;

==Compatibility issues==
PartitionMagic is compatible with Windows NT, 95/98, ME, 2000, and XP desktop editions. However, it is not compatible with server editions of Windows NT, 2000, nor 2003 by design – a more expensive product from the same manufacturer, ServerMagic, would handle these – nor does it run on Windows Vista and later versions.

PartitionMagic 2.0.5, VolumeManager 7 and VolumeManager 8 cannot resize dynamic disks.

<doc id="504124" wikidata="Q3139640" url="?curid=504124" title="Homebush Bay">
<text>Homebush Bay is a bay on the south bank of the Parramatta River, in the west of Sydney, Australia. The name is also sometimes used to refer to an area to the west and south of the bay itself, which was formerly an official suburb of Sydney, and has now become the suburbs of Sydney Olympic Park, Wentworth Point and part of the neighbouring suburb of Lidcombe, all part of the City of Parramatta. Homebush Bay is located west of the Sydney central business district.

The bay has a natural and artificial shoreline on the southern side of the Parramatta River between the suburbs of Wentworth Point and Rhodes. In the 1900s the bay was contaminated with dioxins and other chemicals by the local Union Carbide chemical plant, which has led to commercial fishing bans in most of Sydney Harbour, and health advisories about limiting the quantity of fish eaten from the Parramatta River. Other contaminants in the bay include phthalates, lead, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, DDT, and heavy metals. The eastern shore of the bay was remediated starting in 2008 to remove about 75% of the dioxins from the bay. Remediation was completed in mid-2010, however fishing is still prohibited in Homebush Bay.

The western shore of Homebush Bay is in the local government area of the City of Parramatta, while its eastern shore is in the City of Canada Bay. As a result, the bay forms part of the geographical boundary between the Greater Western Sydney region in the west and the Inner West region of Sydney in the east, except that the suburb of Wentworth Point, at the northern tip of the western bank, is sometimes marketed as being in the Inner West.
Homebush and Homebush West are suburbs to the south, some distance away from the shores of the bay, in the Municipality of Strathfield.

==History==
The region is a part of the traditional land of the Wann-gal people who lived in Homebush Bay thousands of years ago and survived on the resources offered by the estuary. The first European settlers arrived here in 1793 and declared the land as &#x27;Flats&#x27; whose grants were given to free men. For this reason, it came to be known as the &#x27;Liberty Plains&#x27;. The land was dominated by two families during this period - the Blaxlands and the Wentworths. 

The Home Bush Estate was established in the 1800s by the colony&#x27;s assistant surgeon D&#x27;arcy Wentworth. According to local government historian Michael Jones, &quot;Wentworth is popularly credited with having called the area after his &#x27;home in the bush&#x27;, although Homebush is also a place in Kent.&quot; The Wentworth family&#x27;s estate lay on the southwestern shore of the bay, between Powell&#x27;s Creek and Haslam&#x27;s Creek, and south to Parramatta Road. Further to the northwest, to the west of Haslam&#x27;s Creek, the Blaxland family owned the Newington Estate. The bay took its name from the Home Bush Estate. When the railway came through the area south of Parramatta Road in 1855, a station was built in the area to serve the racecourse on the Wentworth estate, and took its name (&quot;Homebush&quot;) from the estate also. The village and later suburb that developed to the south of - and later the north of - the railway station took its name from the station, and is today partly in the suburb of Homebush and partly in the suburb of Strathfield. Meanwhile, the Home Bush Estate became part of the Municipality of Rookwood in 1891, renamed Lidcombe in 1906. Thereafter, it was part of the suburb of Lidcombe and known as &quot;North Lidcombe&quot;. In 1989, North Lidcombe was renamed &quot;Homebush Bay&quot;. This history of name borrowing has resulted in the names &quot;Homebush Bay&quot; and &quot;Homebush&quot; being used at various times for a large and disparate area ranging from modern-day Wentworth Point in the City of Parramatta, to the seat of the Municipality of Strathfield in modern-day Strathfield, almost 6km away.

Wentworth Point, the point on the western extremity of the bay, and Wentworth Bay, the nearby inlet on the western shore of Homebush Bay, are named after the Wentworth family - the bay has now disappeared due to land reclamation. Mud Island was an island in the bay, which became connected with the western mainland due to land reclamation.

In the 20th century, Homebush Bay became a centre of heavy industry, with large scale land reclamations to accommodate industrial facilities. When industrial operations scaled down, the bay became a dumping ground for a large range of unwanted material - from waste to broken up ships, even toxic industrial waste. Union Carbide had manufactured chemicals, including Agent Orange, on the site and dioxins produced as a by product were buried in landfill or left in drums.

A drive to regenerate and rehabilitate the bay began in the 1980s. This led to the construction of Bicentennial Park, including a program to regenerate some of the mangrove wetlands and saltmarshes which existed around the bay pre-development. In preparation for the 2000 Sydney Olympics, it was decided to site Sydney Olympic Park at Homebush Bay, which spurred the further regeneration and rehabilitation of the bay. A range of residential and commercial developments also began around the bay, including the development of a large shopping centre and residential district at Rhodes on the eastern shore.

The former Auburn Council sought public comment on a proposal to rename the suburb of Homebush Bay, as well as removing connotations and confusion with its namesake suburb Homebush. The waterfront residential area was renamed Wentworth Point on 2 October 2009, consistent with the gazetting of the northern part of the peninsula in 1976. the Carter Street industrial precinct was absorbed by the neighbouring suburb of Lidcombe, and the remaining bulk of the suburb, consisting of Sydney Olympic Park, was renamed to that name as a suburb.

==Hydrography==

Homebush Bay is located on the southern shore of Parramatta River. Immediately to the east is Bray Bay, which is separated from Homebush Bay by a narrow peninsula (considerably expanded through land reclamation) that forms the suburb of Rhodes. It is across the Parramatta River from Meadowbank. It is the westernmost of the major bays on the Parramatta River.

Several tributaries enter Parramatta River at Homebush Bay: Powells Creek is joined by tributaries Boundary Creek and Saleyards Creek not far from the southern shore of the bay, and flows into the bay from the south, while Haslams Creek joins the bay further to the north.

The shoreline of Homebush Bay is in large parts artificial, with large scale land reclamations for industrial purposes occurring throughout the 20th century. Its history of use for industry and as dumping ground has left the bay heavily contaminated, including with dioxin and other chemicals produced by Union Carbide operations. Fishing is prohibited in Homebush Bay for health reasons. Other contamination includes phthalates, lead, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, DDT and heavy metals. Remediation from 2008-2010 removed about 75% of the dioxin from the bay.

A number of ships&#x27; hulls are visible in Homebush Bay, remains of the ship-breaking operations in the bay during the mid-20th century. These are the steam colliers SS &quot;Ayrfield&quot; and SS &quot;Mortlake Bank&quot;, steam tugboat SS &quot;Heroic&quot;, and boom defence vessel , all broken up in the early 1970s and now lying near the south-western shore of the bay. Remains of a number of smaller abandoned or broken up vessel lie nearby.

==Landmarks==
Bicentennial Park is located on the southern shore of the bay, and contains an area of rehabilitated mangrove wetland representative of the native state of the bay.

Sydney Olympic Park is a area to the south west of Homebush Bay (and within the former suburb of Homebush Bay) which was notable as the site of the 2000 Olympic Games. Since then, there has been much development in the area including office buildings and apartments in the centre of Sydney Olympic Park. Three completed residential developments in the area are Newington, The Waterfront and Mariners Cove. 

The Sydney Showground relocated from Moore Park in 1998, in preparation for the Olympic Games. The Sydney Showground provided Olympic venues along with Stadium Australia, Sydney Super Dome, Athletics Centre, Aquatic Centre, Tennis Centre, Hockey Stadium and multiple sports halls.

On the eastern shore, within the suburb of Rhodes, lies the large Rhodes Waterside shopping centre. 

The Novotel Hotel features cafes, restaurants and bars with outdoor facilities that cater for special events held at Sydney Olympic Park.

Bennelong Bridge, a bridge open to pedestrians, cyclists and buses but not to cars, crosses the bay near its mouth (between Rhodes on the east bank and Wentworth Point on the west bank). The bridge opened on 22 May 2016. Between 2014 and 2016, during construction, the low bridge was protected by a &quot;maritime exclusion zone&quot;, meaning that watercraft was not able to enter or leave Homebush Bay. 

==Transport==

Two stations on the Sydney Trains metropolitan passenger rail network sit near the shores of the bay. To the south-west, Olympic Park railway station was built to cater for large crowds to the precinct during the 2000 Sydney Olympics, and is especially heavily used for special events in the Olympic Park precinct. It is serviced by a shuttle connecting Olympic Park to Lidcombe railway station. On the eastern shore, Rhodes railway station is on the T9 Northern line.

Sydney Ferries&#x27; Parramatta River ferry services run to the Sydney Olympic Park ferry wharf on the bay. Originally designed to service Sydney Olympic Park, the wharf now mainly serves the residents of Wentworth Point. Busways run a number of regular bus services to the area around the bay. There are also a number of Sydney Olympic Park bus routes for sporting events, concerts and other major events at the Sydney Olympic Park precinct such as the Sydney Royal Easter Show. 

A light rail line is planned to be constructed on the western shore of the bay, which will connect Olympic Park railway station with the centre of Parramatta, to the west. The line was initially planned to run alongside the parkland on the southern shore and connect with Strathfield railway station, but in the current plans the line will terminate in nearby Lidcombe.

<doc id="504126" wikidata="Q3531585" url="?curid=504126" title="Homebush, New South Wales">
<text>Homebush is a suburb in the Inner West of Sydney in the state of New South Wales, Australia. It is located 12 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the Municipality of Strathfield.

The name of the suburb derives ultimately from an estate to the north, called &quot;Home Bush&quot; and owned by colonial surgeon D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth, via the historic Homebush railway station, named after the estate and built in 1855. The present-day suburb of Homebush is bisected by the main suburban railway, Parramatta Road and the M4 Motorway into distinct sections with separate histories of development and present patterns of land use. South of the railway, &quot;Homebush South&quot; covers the core of the historic Village of Homebush estate developed in 1878. This part of the suburb is predominantly low-rise historical homes, with a school, a historic commercial high street and newer mid-rise apartments clustered around the station. It was part of &quot;Strathfield&quot; from 1885 until 1977, and the boundary with Strathfield was further adjusted in 1995. North of the railway, &quot;North Homebush&quot; experienced industrial and residential development in the early 20th century and was a separate municipality until 1947. In the early 21st century, North Homebush has experienced significant population growth due to high density residential developments. The construction of the M4 Motorway in North Homebush led to the demolition of historic homes. Commercial premises now predominate in this area.

A number of geographical names outside the suburb also take their names from the Home Bush Estate. The separate suburb of Flemington was officially gazetted as &quot;Homebush West&quot; in 1992. Homebush Bay (early known as The Flats) is a major inlet on the southern side of the Parramatta River, now surrounded by the separate suburbs of Wentworth Point, Sydney Olympic Park and Rhodes.

==History==
The first name of settlement in the Concord Plains area was &quot;Liberty Plains&quot;. This was a group of grants given to the Colony&#x27;s first free settlers, who came on the ship &quot;Bellona&quot;, in 1793. Most of the original settlers soon departed for agriculturally more attractive places, like the Hawkesbury. One of them, Edward Powell, later returned and established there the Half Way House Inn, on Parramatta Road just west of the creek that now bears his name. The Parish of Liberty Plains remains one of the 57 parishes of Cumberland County, New South Wales (the parish is a cadastral unit for use on land titles). That parish covers the suburb of Homebush West (Flemington), but not the suburb of Homebush, which is instead in the Parish of Concord.

When the Great Western Railway line came through there, with a station just behind Powell&#x27;s Inn, the station borrowed the name &quot;Homebush&quot; from the nearest large estate, that of the &quot;Home Bush Estate&quot;, owned by the Colony&#x27;s then-assistant surgeon, D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth. The station was briefly the early terminus of the Great Western Line in 1855. It is commonly thought that this property and house with the name of &quot;Home Bush&quot; was established and named by D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth. Historian Michael Jones who had been commissioned by Stathfield Council to write the history of that municipality wrote: &quot;Wentworth is popularly credited with having called the area after his &#x27;home in the bush&#x27;, although Homebush is also a place in Kent&quot;. However, according to local historian David Patrick it was not D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth who named &quot;Home Bush&quot; but an earlier grantee on the land – that being the military figure Thomas Laycock. It would appear that after Laycock became mentally ill, following his direct involvement in suppressing the Castle Hill convict rebellion, D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth became his doctor. It has been reputed that D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth either bought the Laycock Home Bush Farm from Laycock or, more fancifully, won the property in an unfair game of cards from the ailing Laycock. Wentworth retained Thomas Laycock&#x27;s name of the property and added to its extent. Laycock had been granted 40 hectares in 1794 and increased this to by 1803 and named it &quot;Home Bush&quot;. A notice that Laycock placed in the newspapers about his property &quot;Home Bush&quot; is from before when Wentworth acquired the land from him. Later on, Wentworth acquired more land there himself and the estate had grown to by 1811. However, the &quot;Home Bush Estate&quot; had only minor overlaps with the present suburb: most of Wentworth&#x27;s Home Bush Estate (later a race course and paddocks) is located in present-day Olympic Park and Flemington. Most of the former &quot;Home Bush Estate&quot; became a separate suburb of former Auburn Council named &quot;North Lidcombe&quot;, and (from 1989) &quot;Homebush Bay&quot;, most of which became in 2009 the suburb of Olympic Park in the City of Parramatta, and a smaller part became the suburb of Wentworth Point.

By contrast, the village and later suburb of Homebush was subdivided from Powell&#x27;s estate, a separate grant to the south. Powell&#x27;s grant, enlarged in his lifetime, passed eventually to his son-in-law James Underwood in 1823. It was from the &quot;Underwood Estate&quot; that the &quot;Village of Homebush&quot;, located south of the railway and west of Powell&#x27;s Creek, was subdivided in 1878 for residential development, with a small village &quot;high street&quot; forming on Rochester Street adjacent to the railway station. An extended area to the south followed the oblique street pattern of Coventry Road (part of which was renamed Mackenzie Street in 1918) and Beresford Road, such as Albert Road and Oxford Road. The suburb of &quot;Homebush&quot; thus included the northern and central part of today&#x27;s suburb of Strathfield, bounded by Homebush Road in the east. Near its southern extremity, Bushy Hill Street Estate, Homebush was subdivided in 1880. This estate included the south side of Redmyre Road, Florence Street and Bushy Hill Street (now Albyn Road), to the west of Homebush Road.

The then-suburb of Homebush (consisting of the part of today&#x27;s Homebush and Strathfield south of railway and west of Homebush Road), together with the northern part of Druitt Town (which lay to its south), and the western part of Redmyre (east of Homebush Road) became part of Strathfield Municipality in 1885, after which directories listed houses in all three areas as being in &quot;Strathfield&quot;.

After 1885, &quot;Homebush&quot; usually referred to the unincorporated part of the Underwood and Wentworth estates located north of the railway. This area remained underdeveloped for many years, and when &quot;Homebush Municipality&quot; was established over this area (Homebush North) in 1906, there were only 90 houses and 548 residents in the municipality. The incorporation of Homebush North and the development of primary and secondary industry nearby led to rapid development in that area. In 1925, the opening of the Homebush Theatre (later a cinema, now disused) on Parramatta Road spurred development of a commercial area along that road, but this area fell into decline in the late 20th century.

Homebush Municipality merged into Strathfield Municipality in 1947. In 1977, the geographical name &quot;North Homebush&quot; was discontinued. The modern suburb of &quot;Homebush&quot;, combining former &quot;North Homebush&quot; and the northern part of Strathfield, were gazetted in 1995.

==Description==
Homebush is made up of a number of areas that were developed at different times. The modern suburb is bounded roughly by Saleyards Creek in the west and Powells Creek in the north and east. In the northwest, since 1992 it has been divided from the suburb of Sydney Olympic Park in the City of Parramatta by the A3 arterial road; prior to that, the northwest boundary was Boundary Creek. In the south, it is divided from the suburb of Strathfield by an irregular boundary roughly following the local artery road formed by Arthur Street, Broughton Road and Beresford Road, but which brings all of the properties facing that road within the boundaries of the suburb of Strathfield. This irregular boundary was established in 1977, after north Homebush became part of Strathfield Municipality, and the Homebush village centre was carved out of the suburb of Strathfield, eventually to be combined with north Homebush to form the modern suburb. The southern part of the historical suburb of Homebush (between Broughton Road and Albyn Road) is now part of the suburb of Strathfield. The area to the north of the railway that formed the historical Municipality of Homebush is now in the suburbs of Homebush and Homebush West (Flemington). Small strips to the northwest and northeast are in Sydney Olympic Park and North Strathfield respectively.

===Homebush South (Homebush Village)===

Homebush South, also called Homebush Village, is a locality comprising the part of the suburb of Homebush to the south of the railway. Homebush South has a population of 2,806 and a population density of 4,306 people per square kilometre. &quot;Homebush South&quot; was gazetted as a &quot;neighbourhood&quot; in 1992.

Homebush South consists of the bulk of the Village of Homebush estate which was first subdivided in 1878. This development was subdivided from the larger Underwood Estate, and is today split between the suburbs of Homebush and Strathfield. The land had boundaries of The Crescent, Homebush, Beresford, Coventry and Bridge Roads. Homebush Village became part of Strathfield Municipality, proclaimed in 1886. Within the estate, Broughton, Abbotsford and Burlington Roads and Rochester and Meredith Streets were also gazetted. In the December of that year, 381 house blocks were auctioned. By the end of the century, many large houses and substantial villas had been built. In the 20th-century house construction continued and most blocks had been built on by the end of the 1920s. Due to boundary changes after North Homebush was incorporated into Strathfield in 1947, the historic &quot;Village of Homebush&quot; estate is today partly in Homebush South and partly in the suburb of Strathfield.

The western boundary of Homebush South is Saleyards Creek, which flows through Airey Park and divides Homebush South from Flemington village, in the suburb of Homebush West. The creek also serves as the boundary between the cadastral units (used for land title purposes) of the Parish of Concord (to the east, including Homebush) and the Parish of Liberty Plains (to the west, including Flemington).

The Homebush Village centre lies on a section of Rochester Street close to the railway, which forms the &quot;high street&quot; of the village. The commercial buildings along the village high street are largely preserved from the 19th century and are protected as a heritage conservation area. Today, the village centre is populated by numerous cafes and restaurants, as well as independent businesses such as a bakery, a flower shop, a newsagency, a butcher, a bank, a post office, a pharmacy, doctors&#x27; surgeries and grocery stores. These shops extend to The Crescent, opposite Homebush railway station.

While there are low-to-medium-rise apartment blocks around the village centre, most of Homebush South is made up of freestanding residences. Reflecting the age and well-preserved condition of these residential streets, significant parts of the former Village of Homebush are protected as heritage conservation areas, including almost the entirety of Abbotsford Road, which runs east-west across most of the Village, as well as parts of Meredith Street.

Because the southern part of the village of Homebush is now administratively part of the suburb of Strathfield, various sites previously identified with Homebush are no longer within the boundaries of the suburb. These include the Homebush War Memorial in Davey Square, at the southern tip of the village of Homebush.

Homebush Public School, opened in 1885, is in the village centre. Homebush Boys High School is located on the western edge of Homebush South. A girls&#x27; school, Strathfield Girls High School, is located nearby in Strathfield and also serves Homebush South. Strathfield&#x27;s main library is located on Rochester Street in Homebush South. The Catholic Seminary of the Good Shepherd, a training institution for priests, is also located in Hommebush South.

Homebush South is connected to North Homebush via two road connections: Subway Lane, which passes under the railway line to the west of the station, and Bridge Road, which passes over the railway line further west.

===North Homebush===
North Homebush, the part of Homebush north of the railway, is bisected by Parramatta Road and the M4 Western Motorway. It has a total population of 8,966, of which the vast majority (7,797 people) is concentrated in the area south of the M4 motorway and north of the railway.

Because North Homebush is much better integrated with North Strathfield and Concord West, and Homebush South with Strathfield, than the two halves of Homebush are to each other, government planning documents refer to North Homebush and North Strathfield together, as the &quot;Homebush Precinct&quot;. The &quot;Homebush North Precinct&quot; as defined by state government planning documents in fact lies in North Strathfield and Concord West, outside the suburb of Homebush completely.

The North Homebush area was developed slightly later than Homebush South. Although Edward Powell&#x27;s Half Way House Inn on Parramatta Road had been established early in the life of the colony, the rest of the area was largely used for grazing.
In the 1870s, stockyards (for the sale of livestock by auction) were erected adjacent to the station. In 1881, an attempt was made to subdivide the part of the former Home Bush Estate north of Parramatta Road, as the &quot;Homebush Park Estate&quot;. However, this and subsequent subdivision proposals were not successful, and other than the lots adjacent to Parramatta Road, most of the land remained unsold and was sparsely populated.

When the NSW Government abattoirs were moved from Glebe to present-day Sydney Olympic Park, the stockyards were closed and replaced by Flemington stockyards, further west, in 1883. Hotels and other businesses were established in the area adjacent to the stockyards, servicing stockyard and abattoir workers.

The removal of the stockyards allowed development of North Homebush to begin, around the turn of the 20th century, with its own local government (the Municipality of Homebush) established in 1906. The area immediately around Parramatta Road became a busy commercial area, serving workers at factories located along Parramatta Road and further to the north, such as the Arnott&#x27;s Biscuits factory and the EMI records factory, established in the early 20th century. This area was centred on the intersection of Knight Street with Parramatta Road. In 1947, North Homebush became part of the Municipality of Strathfield.

With the decline of industry and the increase of traffic congestion along Parramatta Road after World War II, many of the shops formerly located in the North Homebush commercial area are now shut or abandoned, similarly to other parts of Parramatta Road. Some remnants of the former commercial area remain, including the Horse and Jockey Hotel, a heritage-listed pub on the site of the original Half Way House Inn, as well as the imposing former Homebush Cinema, now abandoned. At least for the time being car sales yards continue to flourish along Parramatta Road but this main artery through North Homebush has now been re-zoned high density residential, with mid- and high-rise apartment blocks proliferating. The only commercial area along Parramatta Road which remains thriving is in the extreme west of this part of the suburb. It is part of Sydney Markets Plaza and serves the Sydney Markets at Flemington.

The construction of the M4 Motorway in the 1970s led to the demolition of some of the fine houses of North Homebush, such as &quot;Pomeroy House&quot;.

North of the M4 Western Motorway, the suburb boundaries extend further west to the western bank of Saleyards Creek. A large portion of this area is occupied by former industrial land, now redeveloped into parklands, office parks and the DFO Homebush shopping centre.

Other nearby commercial areas are the &#x27;Bakehouse Quarter&#x27; in neighbouring North Strathfield and the Homebush Village centre in Homebush South.

As a postal town (for Australia Post purposes) the name &quot;Homebush&quot; refers only to North Homebush.

There are no schools in North Homebush, but the area is served partly by Homebush Public School and partly by North Strathfield Public School. It is also within the catchment areas of Homebush Boys High School and Strathfield Girls High School.

=== Heritage listings ===
Homebush has a number of heritage-listed sites. This includes the following state heritage listed site:
* Great Southern and Western railway: Homebush railway station.

==Governance==
Homebush (now Homebush South and part of Strathfield) was one of the three areas that formed the Strathfield Council when it was proclaimed in 1885, the other two being Redmyre and Druitt Town. The part of the modern suburb north of the railway remained unincorporated until Homebush Municipality was established in 1906. Homebush Municipality operated until 1947, when it was amalgamated with Strathfield Municipality.

At state level, the part of Homebush south of the M4 motorway is represented in the Parliament of New South Wales by the seat of Strathfield, while the part north of the M4 is represented by the seat of Drummoyne. Until the 2011 state election, the division line was the railway: North Homebush was in Drummoyne, Homebush South was in Strathfield. For the 2015 and 2019 state elections, both parts of Homebush were in Strathfield.

At federal level, Homebush is in the Division of Reid. Prior to the 2009 redistribution that abolished the Division of Lowe, it was in the Division of Lowe.

==Transport==
Homebush railway station is serviced by all stations and limited stops services on the Leppington &amp; Inner West Line and Liverpool &amp; Inner West Line of the Sydney Trains network. 
Homebush South is also served by Strathfield railway station, located a short distance east of the suburb boundary, which provides express services on the North Shore &amp; Western Line, Northern Line, Leppington &amp; Inner West Line and Liverpool &amp; Inner West Line, as well as regional and intercity lines. North Homebush is also served by North Strathfield railway station, located a short distance east of the suburb boundary. North Strathfield is on the Northern Line of the Sydney Trains network. It will also be served by the future Sydney Metro West rapid transit line. Transit Systems buses also service the area.

Parramatta Road (Great Western Highway) and the M4 Motorway are the main arterial roads passing through North Homebush. Underwood Road is a local arterial connecting Parramatta Road with Homebush Bay Drive. Homebush South is accessible from the south via the local arterial Homebush Road, and from the east and west via the local arterial formed by Beresford and Broughton Roads. There are two road connections between North Homebush and Homebush South: the Bridge Road overpass and the Subway Lane underpass.

== Education ==
* Homebush Public School, a government primary school, was established in 1885 on its present site between The Crescent, Rochester Street and Burlington Road. Brick buildings were originally built facing The Crescent in 1897 and Burlington Road in 1916.
* Homebush Boys High School was founded in 1936 and is a comprehensive public high school for boys. Formerly a selective high school until the 1970s, Homebush Boys was regarded as one of the academically best-performing comprehensive schools, and has, in the past, been ranked above selective schools on the Higher School Certificate results. The school has an enrolment of approximately 1200 students and the students and staff are from diverse backgrounds and many of them live outside the area.
* The Seminary of the Good Shepherd is a Catholic seminary located in Homebush.
* From 1888 until 1892 David Joseph Sly operated Eton College in Albyn Road Strathfield, New South Wales then listed as being in Homebush.
* From 1892 until 1914 Homebush Grammar School was an independent non-denominational day school for boys located in Albert Road, Strathfield. At the time Albert Road was listed as being in Homebush.

<text>Raspail () is a station of the Paris Métro, serving Line 4 and Line 6 in the 14th arrondissement. The station is now fitted with Platform screen doors, due to the Line 4 being fitted for automation.

==Location==
The station is located under Boulevard Raspail at the intersection with Boulevard Edgar-Quinet.

==Name==
The station is named after the &quot;Boulevard Raspail&quot;, named after 19th-century scientist and statesman François-Vincent Raspail.

==History==
The station opened on 24 April 1906 with the opening of the extension of line 2 Sud from Passy to Place d&#x27;Italie. On 14 October 1907, &quot;line 2 Sud&quot; became part of line 5. On 12 October 1942, the section of line 5 between Étoile and &quot;Place d&#x27;Italie&quot;, including &quot;Raspail&quot; was transferred from line 5 to line 6 in order to separate the underground and elevated sections of the metro (because the latter were more vulnerable to air attack during World War II). The line 4 platforms were opened on 30 October 1909 when the southern section of line 4 was opened between &quot;Raspail&quot; and Porte d&#x27;Orléans; this was temporarily separated from the section of line 4 opened on 21 April 1908 between Châtelet and Porte de Clignancourt. On 9 January 1910, the connecting section opened under the Seine between &quot;Châtelet&quot; and &quot;Raspail&quot;, completing line 4.

The station was renovated a first time after 1969 by adopting the style &quot;Mouton-Duvernet&quot; two-tone orange, cutting radically with the dominant white of the original metro. The station was renovated a second time in 2008 as part of the &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; program and loses its &quot;Mouton&quot; style decoration and its orange tiles. The new furniture was blue on Line 6 and water green on Line 4. In 2017, new modifications were applied to the platforms of Line 4, as part of the future automation of the line.

In 2018, 1,995,962 travelers entered this station (connecting passengers between the two metro lines were not taken into account) which places it at the 259th position of the metro stations for its attendance.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has two entrances in front of nos. 234 and 241 of the Boulevard Raspail.

===Station layout===

===Platforms===
The platforms of the two lines are parallel and located at the same level. The platforms in the direction of Mairie de Montrouge and Charles de Gaulle-Étoile are connected to each other by two passages, offering a direct connection. The platforms of the two lines are of standard configuration. They are separated by the metro tracks located in the centre and the roofs of each line are elliptical. They are decorated in the style used for most of the metro stations. White ceramic bevelled tiles cover the walls, the tunnel exits and the outlets of the corridors. The roofs are coated and painted white, and the name of the station is in the Parisine font on enamelled plates. On the platforms of line 6, the lighting strip is white and rounded in the &quot;Gaudin&quot; style of the metro revival of the 2000s, the advertising frames are a white ceramic, and the seats are in &quot;Akiko&quot; blue style. On Line 4, the metro is automated, there are no more banners, advertising frames, advertising, or seats. After the successful experiment of the Line 14, the RATP started to look forward to automating existing lines. After completely automating line 1, the RATP started focusing on the Line 4. Because of that, Raspail was fitted with Platform screen doors and were installed in September and October 2018.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by Line 68 of the RATP Bus Network.

==Nearby==
Nearby are the Fondation Cartier pour l&#x27;Art Contemporain (contemporary art museum), the École Spéciale d&#x27;Architecture (architecture school) and the Montparnasse Cemetery.

<doc id="504128" wikidata="Q4222379" url="?curid=504128" title="Sino-Japanese vocabulary">
<text>Sino-Japanese vocabulary, also known as , is a subset of Japanese vocabulary that originated in Chinese or was created from elements borrowed from Chinese. Most Sino-Japanese words were borrowed in the 5th–9th centuries AD, from Early Middle Chinese into Old Japanese. Some grammatical structures and sentence patterns can also be identified as Sino-Japanese.

 is one of three broad categories into which the Japanese vocabulary is divided. The others are native Japanese vocabulary (&quot;yamato kotoba&quot;) and borrowings from other, mainly Western languages (&quot;gairaigo&quot;). It has been estimated that about 60% of the words contained in modern Japanese dictionaries are &#x27;, and that about 18–20% of words used in common speech are&#x27;. The usage of such words also increases in formal or literary contexts, and in expressions of abstract or complex ideas.

&quot;&quot;, the use of Chinese-derived words in Japanese, is to be distinguished from &quot;kanbun&quot;, which is historical Literary Chinese written by Japanese in Japan. Both in modern Japanese and classical &quot;kanbun&quot; have Sino-xenic linguistic and phonetic elements also found in Korean and Vietnamese: that is, they are &quot;Sino-foreign&quot;, meaning that they are not pure Chinese but have been mixed with the native languages of their respective nations. Such words invented in Japanese, often with novel meanings, are called wasei-kango. Many of them were created during the Meiji Restoration to translate non-Asian concepts and have been reborrowed into Chinese.

 is also to be distinguished from &quot;gairaigo&quot; of Chinese origin, namely words borrowed from modern Chinese dialects, some of which may be occasionally spelled with Chinese characters or &quot;kanji&quot; just like &#x27;. For example, (&quot;Pekin&quot;, &quot;[[Beijing]]&quot;) which was borrowed from a modern Chinese dialect, is not&#x27;, whereas (&quot;Hokkyō&quot;, &quot;Northern Capital&quot;, a name for Kyoto), which was created with Chinese elements, is &quot;&quot;.

== Background ==

Ancient China&#x27;s enormous political and economic influence in the region had a deep effect on Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese and other Asian languages in East and Southeast Asia throughout history, in a manner somewhat similar to the preeminent position that Greek and Latin had in European history. For example, the Middle Chinese word for gunpowder, (), is rendered as &quot;hwayak&quot; in Korean, and as &quot;kayaku&quot; in Japanese. At the time of their first contact, the existing Japanese language had no writing system, while the Chinese had a written language and a great deal of academic and scientific information, providing new concepts along with Chinese words to express them. Chinese became the language of science, learning, religion and government. The earliest written language to be used in Japan was literary Chinese, which has come to be called &quot;kanbun&quot; in this context. The &quot;kanbun&quot; writing system essentially required every literate Japanese to be competent in written Chinese, although it is unlikely that many Japanese people were then fluent in spoken Chinese. Chinese pronunciation was approximated in words borrowed from Chinese into Japanese; this Sino-Japanese vocabulary is still an important component of the Japanese language, and may be compared to words of Latin or Greek origin in English.

Chinese borrowings also significantly influenced Japanese phonology, leading to many new developments such as closed syllables (CV(N), not just CV) and length becoming a phonetic feature with the development of both long vowels and long consonants. (See Early Middle Japanese: Phonological developments for details.)

== Grammar ==
Sino-Japanese words are almost exclusively nouns, of which many are verbal nouns or adjectival nouns, meaning that they can act as verbs or adjectives. Verbal nouns can be used as verbs by appending (e.g. ), while an adjectival noun uses instead of (usual for nouns) when acting attributively.

In Japanese, verbs and adjectives (that is, inflecting adjectives) are closed classes, and despite the large number of borrowings from Chinese, virtually none of these became inflecting verbs or adjectives, instead being conjugated periphrastically as above.

In addition to the basic verbal noun + &quot;suru&quot; form, verbal nouns with a single-character root often experienced sound changes, such as → → , as in , and some cases where the stem underwent a sound change, as in , from .

== Sino-Japanese and &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; ==
The term &quot;&quot; is usually identified with , a system of pronouncing Chinese characters in a way that at one point approximated the original Chinese. On&#x27;yomi is also known as the &#x27;Sino-Japanese reading&#x27;, and is opposed to under which Chinese characters are assigned to, and read as, native Japanese vocabulary.

However, there are cases where the distinction between on&#x27;yomi and kun&#x27;yomi does not correspond to etymological origin. Chinese characters created in Japan, called , normally only have kun&#x27;yomi, but some kokuji do have on&#x27;yomi. One such character is (as in &quot;hataraku&quot;, &quot;to work&quot;), which was given the on&#x27;yomi &quot;dō&quot; (from the on&#x27;yomi of its phonetic component, ) when used in compounds with other characters, e.g. in &quot;rōdō&quot; (&quot;labor&quot;). Similarly, the character (&quot;gland&quot;) has the on&#x27;yomi &quot;sen&quot; (from the on&#x27;yomi of its phonetic component, &quot;sen&quot; &quot;spring, fountain&quot;), e.g. in &quot;hentōsen&quot; &quot;tonsils&quot;; it was intentionally created as a &quot;&quot; and does not have a kun&#x27;yomi at all. Although not originating in Chinese, both of these are regarded as &#x27;Sino-Japanese&#x27;.

By the same token, that a word is the kun&#x27;yomi of a kanji is not a guarantee that the word is native to Japanese. There are a few Japanese words that, although they appear to have originated in borrowings from Chinese, have such a long history in the Japanese language that they are regarded as native and are thus treated as kun&#x27;yomi, e.g., &quot;uma&quot; &quot;horse&quot; and &quot;ume&quot;. These words are not regarded as belonging to the Sino-Japanese vocabulary.

== Words made in Japan ==

While much Sino-Japanese vocabulary was borrowed from Chinese, a considerable amount was created by the Japanese themselves as they coined new words using Sino-Japanese forms. These are known as ; compare to .

Many Japanese-created &quot;&quot; refer to uniquely Japanese concepts. Examples include , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and &quot;Bushidō&quot; ().

Another miscellaneous group of words were coined from Japanese phrases or crossed over from &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot; to &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot;. Examples include &quot;henji&quot; ( meaning &#x27;reply&#x27;, from native &quot;kaerigoto&quot; &#x27;reply&#x27;), &quot;rippuku&quot; ( &#x27;become angry&#x27;, based on &quot;hara ga tatsu&quot;, literally &#x27;belly/abdomen stands up&#x27;), &quot;shukka&quot; ( &#x27;fire starts or breaks out&#x27;, based on &quot;hi ga deru&quot;), and &quot;ninja&quot; ( from &quot;shinobi-no-mono&quot; meaning &#x27;person of stealth&#x27;). In Chinese, the same combinations of characters are often meaningless or have a different meaning. Even a humble expression like &quot;gohan&quot; ( or &#x27;cooked rice&#x27;) is a pseudo-&quot;&quot; and not found in Chinese. One interesting example that gives itself away as a Japanese coinage is &quot;kaisatsu-guchi&quot; ( literally &#x27;check ticket gate&#x27;), meaning the ticket barrier at a railway station.

More recently, the best-known example is the prolific numbers of &quot;&quot; coined during the Meiji era on the model of Classical Chinese to translate modern concepts imported from the West; when coined to translate a foreign term (rather than simply a new Japanese term), they are known as . Often they use corresponding morphemes to the original term, and thus qualify as calques. These terms include words for new technology, like &quot;denwa&quot; (&#x27;telephone&#x27;), and words for Western cultural categories which the Sinosphere had no exact analogue of on account of partitioning the semantic fields in question differently, such as &quot;kagaku&quot; (&#x27;science&#x27;), &quot;shakai&quot; (&#x27;society&#x27;), and &quot;tetsugaku&quot; (&#x27;philosophy&#x27;). While many terms were coined afresh (such as and ), many were repurposed classical Chinese compounds, whose meanings were tenuously similar to their western counterparts. Here are a few examples:

Notably, the names of the military ranks used throughout the Sinosphere were neither coined anew nor repurposed from Classical Chinese, but were based on the ranks under the Ritsuryō government. Certain military agencies, such as the , the and the , were headed by officials titled with , and (see the Japanese article, ), which later corresponded to &quot;general officer&quot;, &quot;senior officer&quot; and &quot;junior officer&quot; in the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces and adopted by other militaries in China, Korea and Vietnam. See the articles for these ranks for more (Ranks of the Imperial Japanese Army, Comparative military ranks of Korea, Ranks of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Ground Force, Ranks of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy, Ranks of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force, Republic of China Armed Forces rank insignia, Vietnamese military ranks and insignia).

Despite resistance from some contemporary Chinese intellectuals, many &quot;wasei kango&quot; were &quot;back-borrowed&quot; into Chinese around the turn of the 20th century. Such words from that time are thoroughly assimilated into the Chinese lexicon, but translations of foreign concepts between the two languages now occur independently of each other. These &quot;back-borrowings&quot; gave rise to Mandarin &quot;diànhuà&quot; (from &quot;denwa&quot;), &quot;kēxué&quot; (from &quot;kagaku&quot;), &quot;shèhuì&quot; (from &quot;shakai&quot;) and &quot;zhéxué&quot; (from &quot;tetsugaku&quot;). Since the sources for the &quot;wasei kango&quot; included ancient Chinese texts as well as contemporary English-Chinese dictionaries, some of the compounds—including &quot;bunka&quot; (&#x27;culture&#x27;, Mandarin &quot;wénhuà&quot;) and &quot;kakumei&quot; (&#x27;revolution&#x27;, Mandarin &quot;gémìng&quot;)—might have been independently coined by Chinese translators, had Japanese writers not coined them first. A similar process of reborrowing occurred in the modern Greek language, which took back words like τηλεγράφημα &quot;telegrafíma&quot; (&#x27;telegram&#x27;) that were coined in English from Greek roots. Many of these words have also been borrowed into Korean and Vietnamese, forming (a modern Japanese) part of their Sino-Korean and Sino-Vietnamese vocabularies.

Alongside these translated terms, the foreign word may be directly borrowed as gairaigo. The resulting synonyms have varying use, usually with one or the other being more common. For example, &quot;yakyū&quot; and &quot;bēsubōru&quot; both translate as &#x27;baseball&#x27;, where the yakugo is more common. By contrast, and both translate as &#x27;tennis&#x27;, where the gairaigo is more common. Note that neither of these is a calque – they translate literally as &#x27;field ball&#x27; and &#x27;garden ball&#x27;. (&#x27;Base&#x27; is &quot;rui&quot;, but &quot;ruikyū&quot; is an uncommon term for &#x27;softball&#x27;, which itself is normally ).

Finally, quite a few words appear to be Sino-Japanese but are varied in origin, written with — kanji assigned without regard for etymology. In many cases, the characters were chosen only to indicate pronunciation. For example, (&#x27;care, concern&#x27;) is written , using the &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; &quot;se&quot; + &quot;wa&quot; (&#x27;household/society&#x27; + &#x27;talk&#x27;); although this word is not Sino-Japanese but a native Japanese word believed to derive from &quot;sewashii&quot;, meaning &#x27;busy&#x27; or &#x27;troublesome&#x27;; the written form is simply an attempt to assign plausible-looking characters pronounced &quot;se&quot; and &quot;wa&quot;. Other &quot;ateji&quot; of this type include (&#x27;face&#x27; + &#x27;fall down&#x27; = &#x27;bother, trouble&#x27;) and (&#x27;fields&#x27; + &#x27;livelihood&#x27; = &#x27;uncouth&#x27;). (The first gloss after each character roughly translates the kanji; the second is the meaning of the word in Japanese.)

== Types of &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; ==
&quot;On&#x27;yomi&quot; were originally used in &quot;ondoku&quot; ( &quot;sound reading&quot;), the Japanese system for reading aloud texts in the Middle Chinese (MC) language. A huge number of loanwords entered the Japanese language from Middle Chinese, intermediated by these conventionalized pronunciations. There are different types of &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; for Sino-Japanese vocabulary, depending mainly on the time period of borrowing.

Go-on ( &quot;Wu sound&quot;) readings represent the first major wave of Chinese borrowing in the 5th and 6th centuries, coinciding with the introduction of Buddhism in Japan. It is not agreed whether Go-on pronunciations are clearly derived from a particular dialect of Middle Chinese. Buddhist teachings along with the Chinese language were largely imported through the Korean peninsula, and it is unclear to what extent this fact influenced the Go-on pronunciations. Certain genres of modern vocabulary largely use Go-on readings, especially words related to Buddhism and law.

Kan-on ( &quot;Han sound&quot;) readings were introduced in the 7th through 9th centuries during the Tang dynasty, and are based on the central Chang&#x27;an pronunciation of Middle Chinese. While there was a large-scale effort to replace Go-on readings with Kan-on readings when pronouncing Chinese texts in Japan, this effort did not extend to changing the pronunciation of borrowed words that were already used in Japanese. Massive borrowing of Chinese loanwords continued during this period, and these new borrowings reflected the new Kan-on readings. Today, Kan-on readings are the most commonly encountered type of &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot;.

Kan&#x27;yō-on ( &quot;customary sound&quot;) readings are not considered to follow the regular patterns for adapting either Go-on or Kan-on readings, but are commonly encountered in existing Sino-Japanese words. In some cases, the Kan&#x27;yō-on reading is in fact a regular development of the original Go or Kan &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; in a particular environment. For example, (MC &quot;lop&quot;) has the Kan&#x27;yō-on reading /raQ/ (or /ra/) in all Sino-Japanese words, which is the regular development of earlier /rap(u)/ before a voiceless obstruent. A common irregularity for Kan&#x27;yō-on is an unexpected voicing value for an initial obstruent. For example, (MC &quot;tʂɛmX&quot;) is read in all Sino-Japanese words as /zaN/ rather than the expected Kan-on reading /saN/.

Tō-on/Sō-on ( &quot;Tang sound&quot; or &quot;Song sound&quot;) readings were introduced mostly from the 12th century onward, during and after the Song dynasty. &quot;Tang&quot; was in this context used to mean &quot;Chinese&quot; (i.e. &quot;real Chinese pronunciation&quot;), with no intended connection to the earlier Tang Dynasty. Due to their more recent borrowing, Tō-on readings are sometimes more recognizably similar to Modern Chinese pronunciations. There are far fewer Sino-Japanese loanwords with Tō-on readings compared to Go-on and Kan-on readings. Dictionaries do not attempt to provide a Tō-on reading for each kanji as many do for Go-on and Kan-on readings.

Go-on and Kan-on readings have a special status when compared with other &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; types. Arising initially out of the need to be able to read any Chinese text aloud using &quot;ondoku&quot;, there is a long-standing practice of providing a Go and Kan reading for every kanji, even those which have never actually been used in borrowed Sino-Japanese vocabulary. The readings which are not actually encountered in Sino-Japanese loanwords were largely codified in the Edo period through the philological study of Chinese rime tables. These readings are given in many dictionaries, though for the less common kanji there is sometimes disagreement between sources.

== Correspondences between Middle Chinese and &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; ==
All characters used to write Middle Chinese represented a single syllable in the spoken language, made up of an &quot;initial&quot; (a single onset consonant), and a rime (the remainder of the syllable). Originally, the &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; for kanji attempted to closely match the Middle Chinese pronunciation for each character, while guided by the possible sounds and structures of Japanese as spoken at the time. In fact a number of new word shapes entered the language to accommodate the large influx of Chinese borrowings. Subsequently, many sound changes took place in Japanese, affecting both borrowed and native vocabulary. As such, &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; now often bear little resemblance to their original Middle Chinese source, and are even less similar to the pronunciation of the same characters in modern Chinese languages, which have undergone many changes from Middle Chinese. For example, (MC &quot;xjwæŋ&quot;) had the Go-on pronunciation [kwjaũ] when it was first borrowed, which subsequently developed to [kjaũ], then [kjau], then [kjɔː], and finally modern Japanese /kyō/ [kjoː].

=== Onsets (initials) ===
The Early Middle Chinese (EMC) initials have the following regular correspondences in Go and Kan &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot;.

Aspiration was contrastive in Middle Chinese, but voiceless obstruents were adapted to Go and Kan pronunciations in the same way regardless of aspiration. However, many Kan&#x27;yō &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; exist with voiced obstruents corresponding to Middle Chinese unaspirated (and sometimes aspirated) voiceless obstruents. For example, (MC &quot;kjun&quot;) &#x27;army&#x27; has the prescribed Go/Kan reading &quot;kun&quot;, but Kan&#x27;yō &quot;gun&quot; is the only reading actually used in Japanese. There are multiple reasons for the changes from the earlier Go to the later Kan pronunciations. These borrowings were drawn both from different times and different regions of China, and furthermore the Go pronunciations were likely intermediated through Korean Buddhist monks. However, there is little to support the claim that Go-on pronunciations were at the time of their introduction &quot;less accurate&quot; than their later Kan-on counterparts. The discrepancies between the two &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; categories are largely due to changes that took place between Early and Late Middle Chinese. The Early Middle Chinese (EMC) voiced obstruents became breathy voiced in Late Middle Chinese, e.g. [b &gt; bʱ]. EMC [ɲ] became [ʝ̃], later becoming [ʐ] in Northern Chinese dialects. In the Japanese of both time periods, the voiced obstruents were prenasalized as [mb, nd, ndz, ŋg], helping to explain why they correspond to Middle Chinese nasals in Kan &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot;. The Japanese consonant [p] developed first to [f] or [ɸ], and more recently to /h/ (with allophones [h, ɸ, ç]). Older [p] remains modern Japanese /p/ after the special moras /N/ and /Q/, and as such all /h/-initial &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; have regular variants with /p/ in this environment, for example Kan-on /hitu/ &#x27;brush&#x27; vs. /eN.pitu/ &#x27;pencil&#x27;.

=== Rimes (medials and finals) ===
Middle Chinese rimes or &quot;finals&quot; contained a vowel, optional glides before the vowel (sometimes called &quot;medials&quot;), and an optional coda consonant /j, w, m, n, ŋ, p, t, k/— schematically (j)(w)V(C). The precise phonetic realization of the MC vowels is debated, and the set of vowels possible before different coda consonants varies considerably. When borrowed into Japanese, the more complicated MC vowel system was adapted to fit the Japanese five vowel system with /i, e, a, o, u/. MC rimes could begin with a glide /w/, /j/, or both /jw/. The earliest Japanese &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; allow the following sequences containing glides:

All of the /Cy/ and /Cw(y)/ sequences were newly introduced by borrowing from Chinese, though some would later arise in native vocabulary. By the advent of the &quot;historical kana&quot; spellings (13th century, lasting until 1946), the &quot;ancient&quot; kana sequences with /CwyV/ had long before lost their /w/, those with /Cwi/ had become /Cui, ki, gi/, and /ye/ merged with /e/. Later, /w/ was lost everywhere except in the sequence /wa/ with no preceding consonant. The presence of these glides in &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; is in some cases not easily predictable, for example 約 (MC &quot;ʔjak&quot;) has the Go reading &quot;yaku&quot;, while 央 (MC &quot;ʔjaŋ&quot;) has the &quot;jōyō&quot; Go reading &quot;ō&quot;, with &quot;yō&quot; listed as an alternate (but unused) Go reading.

The tables below show the regular correspondences between MC rimes and Japanese &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; (Go and Kan readings). The rimes are given in the transcription systems of Bernhard Karlgren, Li Rong, and William Baxter (see Middle Chinese finals for more transcription systems). Examples are given using the MC reconstructions from Karlgren&#x27;s &quot;Grammata Serica Recensa&quot; (GSR), with the rimes transcribed using Baxter&#x27;s system (see &quot;&quot;). Japanese &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; are given in a phonemic transcription (see Japanese phonology).

Different MC rimes were restricted to following only certain MC initial consonants. Furthermore, the identity of the initial consonant sometimes results in a different regular outcome for the Japanese &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot;. For the purposes of determining the Japanese &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot;, the following sets of consonants can be distinguished:

Developments after the Japanese consonants /r/ (from MC /l/) and /n/ (from MC /n, ɳ, ɲ/) are noted where relevant. The MC onset /j/ (like all palatal onsets) appears only with MC rimes beginning in /j/, and generally patterns in &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; with MC /ʔ/ before the same rimes, but sometimes there is a distinction, where /j/ patterns with S. Where one of these five categories (P, T, S, K, Ø) appears in parentheses in the tables below, it refers to the adaptation of the MC rime after these different sets of consonants. Five columns in each table mark whether the given MC rime is found after each of these onset categories. A bullet (•) indicates that Go and Kan &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; exist corresponding to the given MC rime after the given onsets. When (~) appears, it indicates that an MC character exists which is expected to provide a relevant Japanese &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot;, but it either has no identified reading, has &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; which are not clearly distinguished as Go vs. Kan, or has multiple MC pronunciations which make it impossible to determine which MC rime the &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; correspond to.

While the correspondences between MC rimes and Japanese &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; are rather consistent, there exists considerably more irregularity than is represented in these tables. Exceptional pronunciations are often found even for officially recognized Go and Kan readings. Furthermore, many kanji have Kan&#x27;yō-on readings, which by definition do not follow the regular correspondences, but appear in established Sino-Japanese words. The illusion of regularity is bolstered by the fact that lexicographers generally provide Go and Kan readings for characters based on their expected outcome, even when these readings are not actually employed in any Japanese word. Out of necessity, many of the examples shown below are of this type. Readings in the &quot;jōyō&quot; kanji list are highlighted in blue.

==== Vowel-final rimes ====
These MC rimes have no consonant after the vowel.

==== Rimes ending in a palatal glide ====
These MC rimes are analyzed as having a palatal glide after the vowel, though not all of the rimes end in a phonetic [j] in all MC transcription systems. These mostly end up as Japanese &quot;ai&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;ē&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, or &quot;ui&quot;.

==== Rimes ending in a labial glide ====
The MC rimes ending in a labial glide were for the most part borrowed as diphthongs in Japanese. These later monophthongized as long vowels, such that these MC rimes mostly correspond to modern Japanese &quot;ō&quot;, &quot;yō&quot;, &quot;ū&quot;, or &quot;yū&quot;.

==== Rimes with coda m ====
MC coda /m/ was originally written in Japanese with the &quot;man&#x27;yōgana&quot; , which came to stand for the nasal special mora /N/. The &quot;manyō&#x27;gana&quot; developed into the &quot;hiragana&quot; ん used to represent /N/. It is possible that originally represented two distinct sounds, moraic /m/ and moraic /n/ (from MC coda /n/, see below), but they may have been pronounced identically in Sino-Japanese vocabulary from the start. Regardless, would not have stood for /mu/ in these words (the Go-on reading), just as the precursors of hiragana つ represented /t/ and not /tu/ when adapting the MC coda /t/ (see below). Native /mu/ from this time (&quot;man&#x27;yōgana&quot; or , among others) remains /mu/, developing to /N/ only under very specific circumstances, while the borrowed moraic /m/ always develops to /N/.

==== Rimes with coda n ====
MC coda /n/ was adapted in Japanese as the nasal special mora /N/.

==== Rimes with coda ŋ ====
MC coda /ŋ/ was borrowed as a single Japanese phoneme which was realized as two nasalized offglides: [ĩ] after /e/, and [ũ] after /u, o, a/. The nasality of these glides was generally not represented in writing, but in some cases was indicated with the same diacritic mark that would become the &quot;dakuten&quot; used to mark prenasalized obstruents. These glides then denasalized, and the resulting diphthongs later monophthongized as long vowels. As such, almost all characters with the MC coda /ŋ/ end in &quot;ō&quot;, &quot;yō&quot;, &quot;ē&quot;, &quot;ū&quot;, or &quot;yū&quot; in modern Japanese &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot;.

==== Rimes with coda p ====
MC coda /p/ was borrowed as Japanese /pu/ (likely pronounced as [βu] after a vowel at the time of borrowing). Note that these original readings are identical to the readings for MC /m/-final rimes, but with ふ in place of ん. The phoneme /p/ eventually lenited to /h/ word-initially, but was lost between vowels (except Vpa &gt; Vwa). The result was that all /pu/-final readings developed /Vu/ sequences, which later monophthongized. This same change is seen in native vocabulary, as in OJ &quot;ke1pu&quot; &gt; ModJ &quot;kyō&quot; &#x27;today&#x27;. As a result of this development, all characters with the MC coda /p/ have Go and Kan readings ending in &quot;ō&quot;, &quot;yō&quot; or &quot;yū&quot; in modern Japanese.

Originally, borrowed coda /p/ functioned just like coda /t, k/ (see below) in that the &quot;epenthetic&quot; vowel /u/ did not appear before a voiceless obstruent /h~p, t, s, k/ in the same word, resulting in readings with the obstruent special mora /Q/ in place of /pu/. This phenomenon can still be seen in a number of Japanese words, for example /zipu/ &gt; /zyū/ &#x27;ten&#x27; vs. /ziQ.sai/ [dʑissai] &#x27;ten years old&#x27; (now usually /zyuQ.sai/ [dʑɯssai]). For (MC &quot;lop&quot;), the expected Kan reading /rapu &gt; rō/ is not found in Sino-Japanese vocabulary, but only /raQ/ as in /raQ.ti/ [ɾattɕi] &#x27;abduction&#x27; (shortened in most words to /ra/). However, for many characters, the vowel-final readings have been extended to all environments. In some cases, the reading with /Q/ led to the analogical creation of a /tu/-final reading. Notably, for (MC &quot;lip&quot;) the Kan&#x27;yō-on reading /ritu/ (from regular /riQ/) is overwhelmingly common in Sino-Japanese vocabulary.

==== Rimes with coda t ====
The MC coda /t/ was borrowed as Japanese /t/. Characters ending in this consonant were at first consistently pronounced with no epenthetic vowel, with the kana つ serving double duty to represent /t/ and /tu/. Note that these readings are identical to the readings for MC /n/-final rimes, but with つ/ち in place of ん. Later, an epenthetic vowel /u/ or /i/ was inserted after the consonant in most environments. Kan-on readings use /tu/ exclusively, while the earlier Go&#x27;on readings use both /ti/ and /tu/ unpredictably. For example, MC &quot;bat&quot; is adapted as Go /batu/, while the homophonous MC &quot;bat&quot; is listed in dictionaries as Go /bati/ (though it is not actually used in existing Japanese words). Often Go readings with /ti/ and /tu/ are listed for the same character, though in practice those with /tu/ are much more common. For example, has the Go readings /meti/ and /metu/, but only /metu/ is recognized as the &quot;jōyō&quot; reading, and this is the only Go reading found in existing Japanese words. In fact only nine characters have &quot;jōyō&quot; readings with /(C)Vti/, though these include the common characters /iti/ &#x27;one&#x27;, /siti/ &#x27;seven&#x27;, /hati/ &#x27;eight&#x27;, and /niti/ &#x27;day&#x27;. Before a voiceless obstruent /h~p, t, s, k/ in the same word, the epenthetic vowel does not appear, and the /t/ functions as the obstruent special mora /Q/, forming a geminate with the following obstruent. For example, /niti/ &#x27;day&#x27; appears as /niQ/ in the word /niQ.ki/ [nikki] &#x27;diary&#x27;. 
==== Rimes with coda k ====
MC coda /k/ was borrowed as Japanese /k/ with a following epenthetic /i/ (after /e/) or /u/ (after /a, o, u/). After /i/, the epenthetic vowel (/iki/ vs. /iku/) depends on the original Middle Chinese vowel. The readings for MC /k/-final rimes are very similar to the original readings for MC /ŋ/-final rimes with く/き in place of nasalized う/い, but in this case there are some differences. Just like with coda /t/, the epenthetic vowel is absent before a voiceless obstruent /h~p, t, s, k/ in the same word, and the /k/ functions as the obstruent special mora /Q/. For example, /gaku/ &#x27;study&#x27; appears as /gaQ/ in the word /gaQ.kō/ [gakkō] &#x27;school&#x27;.

== Shapes of borrowed Sino-Japanese roots ==
All MC roots were a single syllable, and due to the restrictions on possible MC syllable shapes, a limited set of readings (&quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot;) are possible for borrowed Sino-Japanese roots. Furthermore, due in large part to the many distinct MC sounds which were merged when borrowed into Japanese, some readings are extremely common across different kanji, while others are very rare. The below table gives the number of kanji with each possible &quot;jōyō&quot; &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; (not distinguishing between Go, Kan, Tō, and Kan&#x27;yō, and not including readings considered restricted or rare). A zero represents a reading which is attested in Sino-Japanese vocabulary, but uses a non-&quot;jōyō&quot; reading. Readings which are listed in dictionaries but which are merely hypothesized and do not appear in attested Japanese words are not considered.

Due to the fact that most MC syllables had a coda, most Japanese &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; are bimoraic, containing either two syllables, a long vowel, or the moraic nasal /N/. These last two structures are extremely common in Sino-Japanese roots, but somewhat rare in native Japanese vocabulary. For these and other reasons, the phonological patterns of Sino-Japanese words and native Japanese words are markedly different, and it is very often possible to correctly guess the etymological origin of a word based solely on its shape.

== Phonetic correspondences between Modern Chinese and &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; ==
=== Comparison with Mandarin ===
At first glance, the &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; of many Sino-Japanese words do not resemble the Modern Standard Chinese pronunciations at all. Firstly, the borrowings occurred in three main waves, with the resulting sounds identified as , , and ; these were at different periods over several centuries, from different stages in Historical Chinese phonology, and thus source pronunciations differ substantially depending on time and place. Beyond this, there are two main reasons for the divergence between Modern Standard Chinese and Modern Standard Japanese pronunciations of cognate terms:
# Most Sino-Japanese words were borrowed in the 5th–9th centuries AD, from Early Middle Chinese into Old Japanese. Both languages have changed significantly since then, and in different ways. This has resulted in the respective pronunciations becoming more and more divergent over time.
# Middle Chinese had a much more complex syllable structure than Old Japanese, as well as many more vowel and consonant differences. Many sounds and sound combinations had to be approximated in the borrowing process, sometimes with significant differences (e.g. final was represented as or ).

Nonetheless, the correspondences between the two are fairly regular. As a result, Sino-Japanese can be viewed as a (transformed) &quot;snapshot&quot; of an archaic period of the Chinese language, and as a result is very important for comparative linguists as it provides a large amount of evidence for the reconstruction of Middle Chinese.

The following is a rough guide to equivalencies between modern Chinese words and modern Sino-Japanese &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; readings.

Unless otherwise noted, in the list below, sounds shown in quotation marks or italics indicate the usage of non-IPA romanization such as Hanyu pinyin for Mandarin Chinese and Hepburn romanization for Japanese. Symbols shown within slashes or square brackets, like or , are .

# A major sound-shift has occurred in Mandarin since the time of modern contact with the West. Namely, the sounds written in Pinyin as &quot;g&quot; or &quot;k&quot; , when immediately preceding an &quot;i&quot;, &quot;y&quot; or &quot;ü&quot; sound, became &quot;j&quot; (, similar to English &quot;j&quot;) or &quot;q&quot; (, similar to English &quot;ch&quot;). This change is called palatalization. As a result, &quot;Peking&quot; () changed to &quot;Běijīng&quot;, and &quot;Chungking&quot; () to &quot;Chóngqìng&quot;. This shift did not occur in Sino-Japanese. Thus, Mandarin &quot;qì&quot; (, &#x27;breath, air, spirit&#x27;) corresponds to Japanese &quot;ki&quot;. In some other varieties of Chinese, it is still pronounced as &#x27;ki&#x27;. For example, in Southern Min is khì (Pe̍h-ōe-jī romanization). This is similar to the way the Latin , once always pronounced like an English , became closer to an English in Italian words where the is followed by an or , changing &quot;centum&quot; into &quot;cento&quot; .
# Old Japanese did not have an &quot;-ng&quot; or syllable ending, which is very common in Chinese. This sound was borrowed as either /i/ or /u/. The combinations /au/ and /eu/ later became &quot;ō&quot; and &quot;yō&quot;, respectively, in Japanese. Thus, the Mandarin reading of &quot;Tokyo&quot; (; Eastern () Capital ()) is &quot;Dōngjīng&quot;; this corresponds to Japanese &quot;Tōkyō&quot;, with sound history for being supposed approximately *kiæŋ -&gt; kyau -&gt; kyō (for comparison: Southern Min (colloquial) is &quot;kiaⁿ&quot; with a nasal diphthong). Another example is , former name for Seoul, which is &quot;Keijō&quot; in Japanese and &quot;Gyeongseong&quot; in Korean (which did and does have syllables ending in ). is read &quot;kei&quot; (*kiæŋ -&gt; kyei -&gt; kei) in this case.
# As in the case of , the same character sometimes has multiple readings, e.g. &quot;kyō&quot; (Go-on) vs. &quot;kei&quot; (Kan-on) vs. &quot;kin&quot; (Tō-on). These stem from multiple phases of borrowing, which occurred at different times and from different source dialects and were carried out by different groups of people possibly speaking different dialects of Japanese. This means that the same word may have had different Chinese pronunciations, and even if not, the borrowers may have chosen different strategies to handle unfamiliar sounds. For example, the character seems to have had an approximate pronunciation of /kjæŋ/ at the time of both the Go-on (5th–6th century AD) and Kan-on (7th–9th century AD) borrowings; however, the unfamiliar vowel /æ/ was represented by /a/ in the former case and /e/ in the latter. (This may also indicate different source pronunciations of the vowel.) In addition, the unfamiliar final was represented by /u/ in the former case but /i/ in the latter, agreeing in frontness vs. backness with the main vowel. By the time of the Tō-on borrowing (post-10th century), the pronunciation in Chinese had changed to /kiŋ/, thus the pronunciation &quot;kin&quot; was decided as the closest approximation.
# The vowels of Chinese sometimes correspond to Sino-Japanese in an apparently haphazard fashion. However, Mandarin &quot;ao&quot; often corresponds to Japanese &quot;ō&quot; (usually derived from earlier Sino-Japanese [au]), and Chinese empty rime (represented in pinyin with a &quot;i&quot;) often corresponds to (a different sound, also represented with a &quot;i&quot; in Hepburn) in Japanese.
# The distinction between voiced and unvoiced consonants ( vs. or vs. ) has been lost in modern Mandarin and many other varieties of Chinese. The key exception is in Wu dialects (, e.g. Shanghainese). The Shanghainese voiced consonants match the Japanese readings nearly perfectly in terms of voicing. For example, (grape) is pronounced &quot;budo&quot; in Shanghainese and &quot;budō&quot; (&lt; &quot;budau&quot;) in Japanese (preserving the voiced consonants [b] and [d]), but &quot;pútáo&quot; in Mandarin. Incidentally, the rising tone of the Mandarin syllables may reflect the earlier voiced quality of the initial consonants.
# In modern Mandarin, all syllables end either in a vowel or in one of a small number of consonant sounds: &quot;n&quot;, &quot;ng&quot;, or occasionally &quot;r&quot;. However, Middle Chinese, like several modern Chinese dialects (e.g. Yue, Hakka, Min), allowed several other final consonants including , , , and , and these are preserved in Sino-Japanese (except for -m, which is replaced by -n, as in , &quot;san&quot;, &quot;three&quot;). However, because Japanese phonology does not allow these consonants to appear at the end of a syllable either, they are usually followed in Sino-Japanese by an additional &quot;i&quot; or &quot;u&quot; vowel, resulting in a second syllable (-&quot;tsu&quot; or -&quot;chi&quot; if from -&quot;t&quot;, -&quot;ku&quot; or &quot;-ki &quot;if from -&quot;k&quot;, and -&quot;pu&quot; if from -&quot;p&quot;, although &quot;-pu&quot; became &quot;-fu&quot; and then simply &quot;-u&quot;). As a result, a one-syllable word in Chinese can become two syllables in Sino-Japanese. For example, Mandarin &quot;tiě&quot; (, &#x27;iron&#x27;) corresponds to Japanese . This is still pronounced with a final in Cantonese: (Vietnamese &quot;thiết&quot;). Another example is Mandarin &quot;guó&quot; (, &#x27;land&#x27;), from Early Middle Chinese /kwək/, corresponding to Japanese &quot;koku&quot;.
#The consonant &quot;f&quot; in Mandarin corresponds to both &quot;h&quot; and &quot;b&quot; in Japanese. Early Middle Chinese had no /f/, but instead had /pj/ or /bj/ (in other reconstructions, or ). Japanese still reflects this (&quot;h&quot; was /p/ in Old Japanese). For example, Mandarin &quot;Fó&quot; ( &#x27;Buddha&#x27;) corresponds to Japanese ; both reflect Early Middle Chinese /bjut/ from a still older form /but/. In modern Southern Min Chinese, this character may be pronounced either [put] or [hut] (colloquial and literary respectively).
# In addition, as in the previous example, Old Japanese /p/ became modern &quot;h&quot;. When a Middle Chinese word ended in /p/, this produced further complications in Japanese. For example, Middle Chinese &#x27;ten&#x27; (Standard Mandarin &quot;shí&quot;, Cantonese ) was borrowed as Old Japanese /zipu/. In time this went through a series of changes: /zipu/ &gt; /zihu/ &gt; /ziu/ &gt; &gt; &quot;jū&quot;. Note that in some compounds, the word was directly borrowed as /zip-/ &gt; &quot;jip-&quot;; hence &quot;jippun&quot; &#x27;ten minutes&#x27; (or &quot;juppun&quot;, influenced by &quot;jū&quot;), rather than &quot;*jūfun&quot;.
# More complex is the archaic dento-labial nasal sound: The character (&#x27;strife, martial arts&#x27;) was pronounced &quot;mvu&quot; in Late Middle Chinese. The sound is approximated in the Japanese pronunciations &quot;bu&quot; and &quot;mu&quot;. However, that sound no longer exists in most modern Chinese dialects, except Southern Min &quot;bú&quot;, and the character is pronounced &quot;wǔ&quot; in Mandarin, in Cantonese, &quot;vu&quot; in Hakka, Shanghainese, and Vietnamese.
# The modern Mandarin initial &quot;r&quot; usually corresponds to &quot;ny&quot; or &quot;ni&quot; in Japanese. At the time of borrowing, characters such as (&#x27;person&#x27;) and (&#x27;day&#x27;), which have an initial &quot;r&quot; sound in modern Mandarin, began with a palatal nasal consonant closely approximating French and Italian &quot;gn&quot; and Spanish &quot;ñ&quot;. (This distinction is still preserved in some Chinese varieties, such as Hakka and Shanghainese, as well as Vietnamese.) Thus Mandarin &quot;Rìběn&quot; (, Japan) corresponds to Japanese &quot;Nippon&quot;. This is also why the character , pronounced in Middle Chinese, is pronounced &quot;nin&quot; in some contexts, as in , and &quot;jin&quot; in others, such as — approximating its more modern pronunciation. In Wu dialects, including Shanghainese, (&#x27;person&#x27;) and (&#x27;two&#x27;) are still pronounced &quot;nin&quot; and &quot;ni&quot;, respectively. In Southern Min (especially Zhangzhou accent), is &quot;jîn&quot; (literary pronunciation) which is practically identical to Japanese On&#x27;yomi.
# In Middle Chinese, (&#x27;five&#x27;) and similar characters were pronounced with a velar nasal consonant, &quot;ng&quot; ([ŋ]), as its initial. This is no longer true in modern Mandarin, but it remains the case in other Chinese dialects such as Cantonese () and Shanghainese. Japanese approximates the Middle Chinese */ng/ with &quot;g&quot; or &quot;go&quot;; thus becomes &quot;go&quot;. In Southern Min, it is pronounced /gɔ/ (colloquial) or /ŋɔ/ (literary) while in the Fuzhou dialect it is pronounced &quot;ngu&quot;. In addition, some Japanese dialects have [ŋ] for medial &quot;g&quot;.
# The Mandarin &quot;hu&quot; sound (as in &quot;huá&quot; or &quot;huī&quot;) does not exist in Japanese and is usually omitted, whereas the Mandarin &quot;l&quot; sound becomes &quot;r&quot; in Japanese. Thus, Mandarin &quot;Huángbò&quot; () corresponds to Japanese &quot;Ōbaku&quot;, and &quot;Rúlái&quot; () and &quot;lamian&quot; () to &quot;Nyorai&quot; and &quot;ramen&quot; respectively.
# Mandarin &quot;h&quot;, usually from Middle Chinese or will often correspond to &quot;k&quot; or &quot;g&quot; in Japanese, as Old Japanese lacked velar fricatives: Modern Japanese is derived from Old Japanese , which descended in most cases from a Proto-Japonic */p/; however, this lack of velar fricatives in Old Japanese helps preserve the voiced-voiceless contrast between Middle Chinese and that Mandarin, Cantonese, Korean and Vietnamese has lost. Mandarin &quot;z&quot; will often correspond to Japanese &quot;j&quot;; these are also changes in Chinese. Thus, Mandarin &quot;hànzì&quot; () corresponds to Japanese &quot;kanji&quot;, &quot;hànwén&quot; (, Chinese written language) to &quot;kanbun&quot;, and &quot;zuìhòu&quot; ( &#x27;last&#x27;) to &quot;saigo&quot;.

=== Chart of correspondences ===
Note:
* MC: Middle Chinese
* Pinyin: Modern Standard Chinese (Mandarin) in its official spelling. Multiple outcomes for MC initials (e.g. MC /ɡ/ &gt; Pinyin g,j,k,q) are primarily due to two reasons:
** MC voiced stops/affricates become Mandarin aspirated stops/affricates (p,t,k,etc.) when the syllable had the MC first tone (Mandarin first/second tones), unaspirated stops/affricates (b,d,g,etc.) otherwise.
** Early Mandarin velar obstruents (g,k,h) and alveolar sibilants (z,c,s) become palatal obstruents (j,q,x) when a front vowel or glide followed.
* Go: , from the Northern and Southern dynasties China or Baekje Korea during the 5th and 6th centuries. Go means Wu.
* Kan: , from the Tang dynasty during the 7th to 9th century.

<text>The Gibson Les Paul is a solid body electric guitar that was first sold by the Gibson Guitar Corporation in 1952. The guitar was designed by factory manager John Huis and his team with input from and endorsement by guitarist Les Paul. Its typical design features a solid mahogany body with a carved maple top and a single cutaway, a mahogany set-in neck with a rosewood fretboard, two pickups with independent volume and tone controls, and a stoptail bridge, although variants exist.

The Les Paul was originally offered with a gold finish and two P-90 pickups. In 1957, humbucking pickups were added, along with sunburst finishes in 1958. The 1958–1960 sunburst Les Paul, today one of the best-known electric guitar types in the world, was considered a commercial failure, with low production and sales. For 1961, the Les Paul was redesigned into what is now known as the Gibson SG. The original single-cutaway, carved top bodystyle was re-introduced in 1968. The Les Paul has been produced in many versions and editions since. Along with Fender&#x27;s Telecaster and Stratocaster, it was one of the first mass-produced electric solid-body guitars. Due to their versatility, Les Paul electric guitars have been used in a wide range of music genres, including rock, country, pop, soul, rhythm and blues, blues, jazz, reggae, punk, and heavy metal.

==History==


=== (1950–1952)===
In 1950, the ancestors of the Fender Telecaster (Fender Esquire and Fender Broadcaster) were introduced to the musical market and solid-body electric guitars became a public craze. In reaction to market demand, Gibson Guitar president Ted McCarty brought guitarist Les Paul into the company as a consultant.

Les Paul was a respected innovator who had been experimenting with guitar design for years. He had hand-built a solid-body prototype nicknamed &quot;The Log&quot;, named after the pine block running through the middle of the guitar whose width and depth are a little more than the width of the fretboard. Conventional hollow guitar sides or &quot;wings&quot; were added for shape. In 1945 or 1946, Paul had approached Gibson with &quot;The Log&quot; prototype, but his design was rejected.

In 1951, McCarty and his team at Gibson began work on what would eventually become the Les Paul Model. Early prototypes of the Les Paul model are very similar to the final version. The new Les Paul guitar was to be an expensive, well-made instrument in accordance with Gibson&#x27;s reputation at the time, and distinct from growing rival guitar manufacturer Fender&#x27;s models.

McCarty approached Les Paul for the right to imprint the musician&#x27;s name on the headstock with the intention of increasing sales; in 1951, Gibson presented Paul a nearly finished instrument for approval. McCarty stated that design discussions with Les Paul were limited to the tailpiece and the fitting of a maple cap over the mahogany body for increased density and sustain, which Les Paul had requested reversed. However, this reversal would have caused the guitar to become too heavy, and Paul&#x27;s request was refused. Paul states that the original Custom should have had the maple cap and the Goldtop was to be all mahogany. The Custom did not appear on the market for another two years following the introduction of the Goldtop; it is possible that Gibson had planned a full model range of guitars (with a roll-out over the course of several years) at the time when initial specifications were being set. Les Paul&#x27;s contributions to the guitar line bearing his name were more than cosmetic; for example, Paul specified that the guitar be offered in a gold finish, not only for flashiness, but to emphasize the high quality of the Gibson Les Paul instrument. Later Les Paul models included flame maple (tiger stripe) and &quot;quilted&quot; maple tops, again in contrast to the competing Fender line&#x27;s range of car-like custom color finishes.

The 1952 Les Paul featured a mahogany body with a one-inch-thick maple cap, a mahogany neck with a rosewood fretboard, two P-90 single coil pickups, and a one-piece, &#x27;trapeze&#x27;-style bridge/tailpiece with strings fitted under (instead of over) a steel stop-bar.

The guitar made its public debut when Paul used it onstage in June 1952 at the Paramount theatre in New York. On July 24, 1952, at a special musicians clinic at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel, it was previewed by prominent guitarists such as Tiger Haynes, George Barnes, Mundell Lowe, Tony Mottola, and Billy Mure.

=== (1953–1957)===
A second Les Paul model was introduced in 1953. Called the Les Paul Custom, this black guitar with gold-plated hardware was dubbed the &quot;Black Beauty&quot;. New bridge and tailpiece designs were rapidly adopted. The one-piece &quot;wraparound&quot; stopbar was introduced in 1953. The following year saw the introduction of the fully-adjustable Tune-o-matic bridge. The Goldtop and Custom models continued without significant changes until 1957. New humbucker pickups designed by Seth Lover in 1955 debuted on Les Pauls in 1957 and P-90 pickups were no longer offered. These pickups carried the markings &quot;PAF&quot;, for &quot;Patent Applied For&quot; (referring to ). This innovation in pickups became the flagship pickup design most associated with Gibson. Many other guitar companies followed suit, outfitting their electrics with versions of the humbucking pickup.

=== (1958–1968)===

In 1958, the Les Paul saw its first major design change. A new model, called the Standard, retained most features of the 1957 Goldtop. However, Standards featured a cherry-red sunburst finish. These guitars were priced higher than the Goldtop models, but lower than the Customs. At this time, Gibson instruments were marketed toward an older, jazz-oriented audience rather than young burgeoning guitarists. As a result, over the three-year period of production, only about 1,700 Standards were made.
These Les Pauls were considered to be too heavy and old-fashioned, and they initially did not find favor amongst guitarists. In 1961, Gibson stopped producing the traditional Les Paul in favor of a lighter redesign which was later called the SG. The mid-1960s, however, brought a resurgence of interest in the Les Paul Standard. In 1964, The Rolling Stones&#x27; Keith Richards began using a sunburst, 1959 Les Paul Standard — becoming the first &quot;star-guitarist&quot; to play a Les Paul on the British scene. The guitar, outfitted with a Bigsby tailpiece, served as one of the guitarist&#x27;s prominent instruments and provided the first impetus to the use of Les Pauls during the British blues boom. In 1965, Eric Clapton began using Les Pauls because of the influence of Freddie King and Hubert Sumlin, and played a 1960 Standard on the groundbreaking album &quot;Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton&quot;. In America, Mike Bloomfield began using a 1954 Les Paul goldtop while touring with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, and recorded most of his work on the band&#x27;s East-West album with that guitar. A year later, he traded it for a 1959 Standard with which he became most identified. By 1967, Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead was using mid-1950s, P-90 pickup-equipped goldtops or black custom models, which he used through 1968. Concurrently in the late 1960s, artists such as Peter Green, Jeff Beck, Paul Kossoff, and Jimmy Page began using sunburst Les Paul Standards. Responding to this influence and increased pressure from the public, Gibson reintroduced the Les Paul single-cutaway guitar in July 1968, and the guitar remains in production today.

=== (1969–1985)===


In 1969, Gibson&#x27;s parent company (Chicago Musical Instruments) was taken over by the conglomerate ECL. Gibson remained under the control of CMI until 1974 when it became a subsidiary of Norlin Musical Instruments.
These ownership changes, often called the &quot;Norlin Era&quot;, caused Gibson products of the time to undergo changes in manufacturing and construction. Les Paul designs were altered and a reinforced upper neck volute was added to decrease headstock breaks. Neck woods were changed from one-piece mahogany to a three-piece maple design. The body was also changed from one-piece mahogany with a maple top to multiple slabs of mahogany with multiple pieced maple tops. This is referred to as &quot;multipiece&quot; construction, and sometimes incorrectly referred to as a &quot;pancake&quot; body. The expression &quot;pancake body&quot; actually refers to a body made of a thin layer of maple sandwiched between two slabs of mahogany, with a maple cap. The grain of the maple was placed at 90 degrees to that of the mahogany. The &quot;pancake&quot;-like layers are clearly visible when looking at the edge of the guitar. This process is also known as &quot;crossbanding&quot;, and was done to make use of less expensive and more readily available thinner mahogany. Crossbanding was phased out by 1977.

In this era, Gibson began experimenting with new models, such as the Les Paul Recording. This guitar was generally unpopular with guitarists because of its complex electronics. Less noticeable changes included, but were not limited to, optional maple fingerboards (added in 1976), pickup cavity shielding, and the crossover of the ABR1 Tune-o-matic bridge into the wide &quot;Nashville&quot; bridge. During the 1970s, the Les Paul body shape was incorporated into other Gibson models, including the S-1, the Sonex, the L6-S, and other models that did not follow the classic Les Paul layout.

===Post-Norlin===
In January 1986, Gibson again changed ownership and began manufacturing a range of varied Les Paul models. The 1980s also saw the end to several design characteristics, including the volute and maple neck. However, because of consumer demand, the Gibson Les Paul guitar is available today in a wide array of choices, ranging from guitars equipped with modern digital electronics to classic re-issue models built to match the look and specifications of the guitar&#x27;s earliest production runs from 1952 to 1960.

In 1986, responding to the high demand for vintage models, Gibson formed a Custom Shop division. Originally, the Custom Shop began producing accurate reproductions of early Les Pauls, as well as one-offs. Today, the Custom Shop produces numerous limited-run &quot;historic-spec&quot; models, as well as signature artist models. The first Custom Shop artist guitar was the 1996 Joe Perry Les Paul, and today, several artist models are offered. &quot;Relic&#x27;d&quot; or &quot;aged&quot; models, branded by Gibson as &quot;Vintage Original Spec&quot; (VOS), are made in the Custom Shop to replicate well-used vintage guitars.

, Gibson offers several variations of the Les Paul guitar with differences in price, features, electronics and finishes. For example, the modern &#x27;Standard&#x27; offers split-coil pickups for a wider range of sounds. The &#x27;Traditional&#x27; model offers the more basic features of guitars available during the 1950s to 1980s, and the &#x27;Classic&#x27; model offers yet other features. &#x27;Special&#x27; and &#x27;Studio&#x27; models have a more basic level of finish and are lower-priced. These models are marketed as &#x27;Gibson USA&#x27; guitars, capitalizing on their American heritage.

== and variations==
The first model, simply called the &quot;Gibson Les Paul&quot;, was released in 1952. This style has since been retroactively named &quot;The Goldtop&quot;, as the model came only in one finish: an old gold solid paint, with two P-90 pickups and nickel plated hardware. In 1954, the Gibson Les Paul Custom was added to the model line. The Custom featured a solid black finish, gold-plated hardware, and other high-end appointments, including becoming one of the first Gibson models to have 3 pickups. The standard goldtop model received PAF humbucking pickups in 1957, and the goldtop paint job was retired in 1958 and replaced with a two-tone translucent sunburst paint job. From 1958 onwards, this main model was known as the Les Paul Standard, nicknamed &quot;the Burst&quot;, and is known for its high collectability. The original Les Paul body shape was retired in 1961 and radically redesigned as the Gibson SG (which for the first several years was known as the Les Paul SG, before Les Paul&#x27;s endorsement deal ran out). In the mid-late 1960s, the unique tonal quality of the humbucker-equipped &quot;Burst&quot; models became a favorite among rock guitarists, and this renewed interest caused Gibson to bring back the Standard and Custom models in 1968. They have remained in production ever since; as well Gibson added a number of other model lines over the years, including budget/student lines such as the Les Paul Junior and Les Paul Special, studio-quality guitars with basic appointments but upgraded electronics, such as the Les Paul Professional and Les Paul Recording, and other short-lived models, including dozens of celebrity endorsed models.

=== (1952–1958, 1968–present)===

The first Les Paul model Goldtops were produced from 1952 to 1957. Early 1952 Les Pauls were not issued serial numbers, did not have bound fingerboards, and are considered by some as &quot;LP Model prototypes&quot;. However, later 1952 Les Pauls were issued serial numbers and also came with bound fingerboards. The design scheme of some of these early models varied. For instance, some early Les Pauls were fitted with black covered P-90 pickups instead of the usual cream-colored plastic covers. The weight and the tonal characteristics of the Goldtop Les Paul were largely due to the mahogany and maple construction.

In 1953, the trapeze tailpiece was dropped, and a new stopbar design was added. This design combined a pre-intonated bridge and tailpiece with two studs just behind the bridge pickup. This increased the sustain of the Goldtop noticeably; however, the intonation and string height adjustability were limited. A new design, the Tune-o-matic, replaced the stopbar in 1955. It consisted of a separate bridge and tailpiece attached directly to the top of the guitar, combining an easily adjustable bridge with a sustain-carrying tailpiece. This design has been used on most Les Pauls ever since. The tuners were produced by Kluson.

=== (1954–1960, 1968–present)===

The Les Paul Custom features gold hardware, multilayer binding including the headstock, ebony fingerboard, real mother-of-pearl inlays and two or three-pickup layout. 1950s Customs were all-mahogany, rather than the mahogany-with-maple-cap of the Goldtop. The original Customs were fitted with a P-90 pickup in the bridge position and an Alnico V &quot;staple&quot; pickup in the neck. In 1957, the Custom was fitted with Gibson&#x27;s new PAF humbucker pickups, and later became available with three pickups instead of the usual two. The traditional Les Paul Custom was discontinued in 1961 and its name transferred to the custom version of the then-new Gibson SG.

In 1968, Gibson reintroduced the Les Paul Custom as a two-pickup-only model. The headstock angle was changed from 17 degrees to 14, and a wider headstock and a maple top (in lieu of the original 1953–1961 mahogany top construction) were added. White and two sunburst finish options were added to the color palette in 1974. Also new in 1974 was the optional TP-6 fine-tuner tailpiece, allowing for micro-adjustment of string tuning from the bridge. The mahogany neck was replaced with a three-piece maple neck in 1975 (though mahogany still saw limited use) with this change lasting until around 1982. Popular colors, such as wine red and &quot;silverburst&quot;, were added in the 1970s and &#x27;80s. Gibson currently produces several Custom models with various finishes and pickups.

=== (1958–1960, 1976–present)===
In 1958, new Standard model retained most specifications of the 1957 Goldtop, including PAF humbucker pickups, a maple top, and a tune-o-matic bridge with a stop tailpiece or Bigsby vibrato tailpiece. The gold color used since 1952 was replaced by a cherry-red version of the Sunburst finish long used on Gibson&#x27;s flat-top and archtop acoustic and hollow electric guitars. Since the maple cap was now visible, tops were made either with a solid &quot;plaintop&quot; piece of maple or two bookmatched pieces of figured (curly or quilted) maple. To differentiate from the earlier Goldtop model, the new Les Paul was referred to as The Les Paul Standard. Specifications during 1958–60 varied from year to year and also from guitar to guitar. Typical 1958 Les Paul Standard necks had a thicker neck, thinner frets and lower fret height, which changed during the course of 1959 to develop into typical 1960 necks with a thinner cross-section and wider, higher frets. The cherry dye used on the 1958–59 models faded rapidly from ultraviolet light exposure, so in early 1960 Gibson switched to a new, fade-resistant formulation which was also less translucent and slightly more orange; this is sometimes called the &quot;tomato soup burst&quot;. Fading of the original paint job was unpredictable, as the red color could either lighten or darken depending on the specific formulation and on the conditions the guitar had been exposed to, resulting in a wide array of nicknames, such as &quot;lemon burst&quot; or &quot;tobacco burst&quot;, for the resulting colorations. Despite the wide variety of color variations now found on the original 1958–59 models, they all went to market with nearly identical paint jobs. Furthermore, during the production run, Gibson changed the color of plastic used on the pickup bobbins multiple times between black and white again; however during assembly, pickups were assembled semi-randomly, with no attention given to matching the two single-coil bobbins to each other when building the humbucking pickups; the guitar was sold with a nickel-plated pickup cover, so Gibson did not consider the color of the bobbins to be an aesthetic consideration. Additionally, since the translucent finish allowed the wood grain to show, each Sunburst model has a unique combination of finish fade, wood grain, and pickup colors resulting in a highly individualized guitar, adding to the collectability of the model. Many famous original Les Paul standards can be easily identified by their unique appearance.
Original production of the Standards lasted from 1958 to early 1961. As Gibson only kept records on shipments of &quot;Les Paul&quot; models, and the Sunburst Standard overlapped production years with both the earlier Goldtop and later SG models, nailing down exact production numbers is difficult. Depending on the source, it is estimated anywhere from 1,200 to 1,700 of these early models were made and have subsequently become highly valuable.

Production ended in 1961 when Gibson redesigned the Les Paul to feature a &quot;double cutaway&quot; body, which has subsequently become the Gibson SG. The model was quietly reintroduced to dealers as early as 1972 before production of Les Paul Standards &quot;officially&quot; resumed in 1976 due to high demand. They have remained in continuous production since then, as well as periodic reissues from the Gibson Custom Shop, using the original 1958–60 specs.

=== (1954–1960) and (1955–1960)===
In 1954, the Les Paul Junior debuted, targeting the beginner or student guitarist. As a cost-saving measure, many of the appointments of the Standard and Custom models are absent from the Junior. The Junior is characterized by its flat-top &quot;slab&quot; mahogany body (in contrast to the carved maple top on other models), finished in sunburst. It had a single P-90 pickup (in contrast to the two- and three-humbucker pickup configurations on the more expensive models), simple volume and tone controls, an unbound rosewood fingerboard with plain dot-shape position markers, and a combination bridge/tailpiece unit similar to the Goldtop.

In 1955, Gibson launched the Les Paul TV model, which was identical to the Junior except for the name and a fashionable contemporary &quot;limed oak&quot; style finish, later more accurately named &quot;limed mahogany&quot;. This natural wood finish with white grain filler often aged into a natural wood or dull yellow appearance, and eventually evolved into the opaque mustard yellow, popularly called &quot;TV yellow&quot;. The model was not, as a popular myth says, to avoid glare from old TV cameras, but a modern look and a name to promote &quot;The Les Paul &amp; Mary Ford Show&quot; then on television.

Gibson made a radical design change to their Junior and TV models in 1959: to accommodate player requests for more access to the top frets than the previous designs allowed, these electric guitar models were revamped with a new double-cutaway body shape. In addition, Juniors were now available with a cherry red finish, while the re-shaped TV adopted a more yellow-tinged finish.

=== (1955–1960)===
The Les Paul Special was released in 1955, featuring a slab body, two soapbar P-90 single coil pickups, and was finished in a color similar to TV Yellow (but not called a TV model). It fit in the model line between the Junior and the Standard, having the two-pickup configuration of the Standard, but featuring the simpler, more basic appointments of the Junior.

In 1959, the Special was given the same new double-cutaway body shape as the Junior and the TV received in 1959. Around this time, Les Paul decided to discontinue his affiliation with Gibson; the model was renamed &quot;SG Special&quot; in the late 1959. However, when the new design was applied to the two-pickup Special, the cavity for the neck pickup overlapped the neck-to-body joint. This weakened the joint to the point that the neck could break after only moderate handling. The problem was soon resolved when Gibson designers moved the neck pickup farther down the body, producing a stronger joint and eliminating the breakage problem.

=== (1961–1963)===

In 1960, Gibson experienced a decline in electric guitar sales due to strong competition from Fender&#x27;s comparable but much lighter double-cutaway design, the Stratocaster. In response, Gibson modified the Les Paul line. For 1961, the Les Paul was thinner and much lighter than earlier models, with two sharply pointed cutaways and a vibrato system. However, the redesign was done without Les Paul&#x27;s knowledge, and he hated the design, so he asked Gibson to remove his name. The double cutaway design retained the &quot;Les Paul&quot; name until 1963 when Les Paul&#x27;s endorsement deal with Gibson ended. Without a contract, Gibson could no longer call its guitars &quot;Les Pauls&quot;, and it renamed them &quot;SGs&quot; (for &quot;Solid Guitars&quot;).
=== (1970–1985)===
The Deluxe was among the &quot;new&quot; 1968–1969 Les Pauls and seen as an evolution of the Special. This model featured &quot;mini-humbuckers&quot;, also known as &quot;New York&quot; humbuckers, and did not initially prove popular. The mini-humbucker pickups fit into the pre-carved P-90 pickup cavity using an adaptor ring developed by Gibson in order to use a surplus supply of Epiphone mini-humbuckers. The Deluxe was introduced in 1970 and helped to standardize production among Gibson&#x27;s U.S.-built Les Pauls. The first incarnation of the Deluxe featured a one-piece body and slim three-piece neck (It has been thought that some of these early &quot;one-piece&quot; bodies were actually leftovers from original 1950s Les Paul parts). The multi-piece body (a thin layer of maple on top of two layers of Honduran mahogany) arrived later in 1969. Towards the end of that year, a reinforcing neck volute was added. 1969 Deluxes feature the Gibson logo devoid of the dot over the &quot;i&quot; in Gibson. By late 1969/early 1970, the dot over the &quot;i&quot; had returned, plus a &quot;Made In USA&quot; stamp on the back of the headstock. Gibson produced 216 Deluxe Gold Top as specially-ordered guitars with full-size humbucker t-tops pickups between 1972 and 1974 (179 in 1973, 28 in 1974 and 9 in 1972), as a Les Paul Standard pickup specification. 

Until the end of the year 1974, 90% of the Gibson Les Paul Deluxe manufactured were Gold Top. New colors emerged from 1975, less valued than the Gold Top. By late 1975, the neck construction was changed from mahogany to maple. This lasted until the early 1980s, when the construction returned to mahogany. The body changed back to solid mahogany from the pancake design in late 1976 or early 1977. In 1985 Gibson discontinued the Deluxe model.

=== Professional (1969–1971) ===
The Les Paul Professional was produced from 1969 to 1971, it was a rare model as only around 118 were ever produced. Designed primarily as a studio guitar, it featured an unadorned dark-stained mahogany slab body with two low-impedance pickups mounted at an angle and a unique control layout that included not only the standard &quot;rhythm/lead&quot; switch, but also two toggles between the tailpiece and the volume/tone knobs that allowed for additional tone options. The low-impedance pickups required a special cable that included an on-board transformer. The model came with either a stop tailpiece or a Gibson-branded Bigsby vibrato tailpiece. Chicago guitarist Terry Kath used a Les Paul Professional both in the studio and on stage. The model was never popular, and was phased out in 1971 and replaced with the Les Paul Recording model, which itself was replaced in 1983 by the Les Paul Studio model. A few Professionals shipped in 1972 and 1973, though the catalogues had switched to the Recording model by then.

=== Recording (1971–1979) ===

The Les Paul Recording was produced from late 1971–1979 (the first models shipped in 1972). It was a slightly modified version of the Professional model, and featured the same low-impedance pickups and same body, though with a lighter-colored stain. The control layout was changed, the rhythm/lead selector switch was moved near the other controls from the upper left to lower right side of the guitar body, and the tone control toggle switches were rotated 90 degrees. The plastic plate to label the switches and knobs was larger than the Professional model as well. Les Paul himself favored the Recording model among all of the guitars to bear his name; it was his main guitar during his years playing at the Iridium Jazz Club and other New York venues. The model was re-issued in 2014.

=== The Paul (1978–1982) ===

A single sharp cutaway Les Paul-style walnut body, set walnut neck, pearl dot inlays, walnut headstock overlay with gold Gibson logo (1978–1981) or Gibson logo branded into the headstock (Firebrand, 1981–1982). Hardware included three-per-side tuners, stop tailpiece, two exposed humbucker pickups, four knobs (two volume, two tone), three-way pickup switch, chrome hardware, available in Natural Walnut finish. It was manufactured between 1978 and 1982. It included such high end items as Grover tuning keys and the Tune-O-Matic bridge. It has become affectionately referred to as &quot;The Coffee Table Burst&quot; because of its natural finish.

=== (1983–present) ===
The Studio model was introduced in 1983, and is still in production. The guitar is intended for the studio musician; therefore, the design features of the &quot;Les Paul Studio&quot; are centered on optimal sound output and not on flashy appearance. This model retains only the elements of the Gibson Les Paul that contribute to tone and playability, including the carved maple top and standard mechanical and electronic hardware. However, the Studio design, until 2017, omits several stock Gibson ornamentations that do not affect sound quality, including body/neck binding. The first Studios from 1983 to 1986 were made with alder bodies rather than mahogany/maple. The current Studios come with a chambered mahogany body with either a maple or mahogany cap. The entry-level Les Paul Studio &quot;faded&quot; has a weight-relieved mahogany body and top and a satin finish. In 2018 neck binding and a pair of Gibson&#x27;s most popular humbucking pickups, 57 Classic and 57 Classic+, and two push-pull pots were introduced. In order to guarantee the stability of the tuning and an excellent sustain were introduced the Grover tuners, the self-lubricating nut and the aluminium tune-o-matic bridge.

Gibson also offered the Studio in a &quot;standard&quot; model. This variant was adorned with neck and body binding, ebony fretboard and sunburst paint job. All Studios at the time had dot fretboard markers and a thinner body.

===Memphis ES-Les Paul (2014–2016)===

Gibson released the Memphis ES-Les Paul in 2014. It is a semi-acoustic model with f-holes and most with two Alnico humbuckers. There was a limited Custom Shop run of VOS Black Beauty ES Les Pauls with three humbuckers. Some of these limited run guitars were also fitted with Bigsby tailpieces. The neck is mahogany, but the sides and back are laminated maple and poplar. A mahogany block runs throughout the body to increase sustain.

The Les Paul Memphis ES was released with Gibson&#x27;s MHS (Memphis Historic Spec) humbuckers. These scatter wound pickups have unbalanced coils to emulate vintage PAFs. The bridge and middle pickups both have Alnico II magnets while the neck pickup houses an Alnico III.

In addition to the factory-installed Bigsby B7 and retro &#x27;Milk Bottle&#x27; Grover Rotomatics on some models, other vintage enhancements were added to the guitar. The neck features a Historic-style truss-rod, rolled fingerboard edges, and is fretted over top of the binding. The three-pickup wiring offers modern switching and employs Orange Drop capacitors for less treble-cut.

Due to its limited run, the Memphis ES-Les Paul has become a sought-after and collectible Les Paul model.

=== HP (2016–2019) ===

The Gibson Les Paul HP – which stands for &quot;High Performance&quot; – was introduced in 2016, intending to be a Les Paul version featuring the most modern features, like the G-Force automatic tuner, a compound radius fretboard, a titanium adjustable zero-fret nut, and a carved fast access neck heel, similar to the Axcess model. Each knob had a push/pull function allowing to split the pickups and transient suppression. The guitar came in a special hardshell case, with a polished aluminium finish.

The model was slightly modified in 2017, when the toggle-switch plate was removed, the knobs changed from ordinary speed knobs to chrome top hat ones, and the pickup rings changed from white to chrome.

The model had a major change in 2018, with the complete removal of the pickup rings – the pickups were now mounted at the back of the guitar, with two screws for each pickup. This change made pickup swap noticeably harder, demanding a modification of the mounting piece of each pickup, which had to be bent inwards.

The model was again changed in 2019, reversing the 2018 pickup ring removal. The knobs changed to transparent top hat ones, and the G-Force tuner was removed with locking tuners being added. This was the last of the HP series, which was discontinued in 2020.

===Dark Fire===

The Gibson Dark Fire is a variant of the Les Paul. It was a second generation Robot Guitar, using an updated version of the Powertune self-tuning system produced by Tronical Gmbh. The Dark Fire also introduced Gibson&#x27;s Chameleon Tone Technology, a system consisting of onboard electronics designed to simulate various guitar tones. Additionally, the guitar included an audio interface called the Robot Interface Pack or RIP.

====Pickups====
The Dark Fire had one Burstbucker 3 humbucker in the bridge position, a P-90H at the neck, and a special Tronical-designed piezoelectric tune-o-matic sat in place of the bridge. The Burstbucker 3 and P-90H were selected via the three-way selector switch. The piezoelectric could be activated via the MCK, blending the magnetic and piezoelectric together under a standard 1/4&quot; guitar cable. Gibson supplied a TRS stereo cable that allowed the piezo signal and the magnetic signal to be split between two different amps.

===Epiphone Les Paul===

The Gibson also sells Les Paul guitars under their Epiphone brand of low-cost instruments; most are similar copies of Gibson-branded models. Made outside the United States, the Epiphone Les Pauls are made from more commonly available woods using less expensive foreign labor and have less hand detailing than the Gibson models, and as a result sell for a lower price. Epiphone has been owned by Gibson Guitars since the 1950s.

Epiphone also makes several less common models of the Les Paul such as the Les Paul Goth, Les Paul Ultra/Ultra II, Les Paul Prophecy, and Les Paul Tribute Plus.
==Signature models==
===Jimmy Page===

Gibson has produced three Jimmy Page signature models. The first was issued in the mid-1990s. It is based on a stock sunburst Les Paul Standard. In 2005, the Gibson Custom Shop issued a limited run of Jimmy Page Signature guitars based on Page&#x27;s 1959 &quot;No. 1&quot;. Several years later, Gibson issued its third Jimmy Page Signature guitar, this one based on Page&#x27;s #2, issued in a production run of 325 guitars.

===Gary Moore===

Gary Moore created his own signature Les Paul in the early 2000s, characterised by a yellow flame top, no binding and signature truss rod cover. It featured two open-topped humbucker pickups, one with &quot;zebra coils&quot; (one white and one black bobbin). In 2009, Gibson released another Gary Moore signature guitar, the Gibson Gary Moore BFG Les Paul. The Gary Moore BFG is much like their previous Les Paul BFG series, with the added styling of Moore&#x27;s various 1950s Les Paul Standards.

===Slash===
Slash has collaborated with Gibson on seventeen signature Les Paul models.

The first of these guitars is the Slash &quot;Snakepit&quot; Les Paul Standard, which was introduced by the Gibson Custom Shop in 1996, based on the smoking snake graphic off the cover of Slash&#x27;s Snakepit&#x27;s debut album and a mother of pearl snake inlay covering the length of the ebony fretboard. An Epiphone version was released as well. Production was limited to 100.

In 2004, the Gibson Custom Shop introduced the Slash Signature Les Paul Standard, a guitar that Gibson has used ever since as the &quot;standard&quot; non-limited edition Slash Les Paul. In 2008, Gibson USA released the Slash Signature Les Paul Standard Plus Top, an authentic replica of one of two Les Pauls Slash received from Gibson in 1988. It has an Antique Vintage Sunburst finish over a solid mahogany body with a maple top. An Epiphone version was released as well. Also in 2008, the Gibson Custom Shop introduced the Slash &quot;Inspired By&quot; Les Paul Standard. This guitar is a replica of his 1987 Les Paul Standard.

In 2010, Gibson released the Slash &quot;AFD/Appetite for Destruction&quot; Les Paul Standard II as a tribute to Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; debut album, &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot;, which resembles the Kris Derrig built 1959 Les Paul replica Slash used for the recording of the album. Production was limited to 400, with 100 aged guitars signed by Slash, and another 300 finished with the Custom Shop&#x27;s VOS process. An Epiphone version was simultaneously released as well.

In 2013, Gibson and Epiphone both released the Slash &quot;Rosso Corsa&quot; Les Paul Standard, and also the Gibson USA&#x27;s Slash &quot;Vermillion&quot; Les Paul Standard. In the year of 2017, Gibson released Slash &quot;Anaconda Burst&quot; Les Paul, which consist of both a Plain Top, as well as a Flame Top. An Epiphone version of the guitar was released as well. In 2017, Gibson Custom Shop released the Slash Firebird, a guitar which is a radical departure from the Les Paul style association he is well known for. The finish was produced in only two separate colors, which is Trans Black and Trans White. Only 50 copies of each color were produced.

===Joe Perry===

Gibson has issued two signature Les Paul guitars for Joe Perry of Aerosmith. The first was developed in 1996 and was customized with an active mid-boost control, black chrome hardware, and a translucent black finish. It was replaced in 2004 by a second, more visually distinctive Les Paul, the &quot;Boneyard&quot; Les Paul. This guitar is characterized by Perry&#x27;s custom &quot;Boneyard&quot; logo on the headstock and a figured maple top with a green tiger finish, and is available with either a stop bar tailpiece or a Bigsby tailpiece.

Joe Perry owned a 1959 Gibson Les Paul Standard. Perry is not sure how, but he lost track of his 1959 Les Paul in 1982. When he wanted to get the guitar back it was in the possession of Slash (which he later used in the music video for November Rain). Perry asked if he could buy back the guitar but Slash refused. Perry continued to ask about the guitar from time to time, and eventually received the guitar back from Slash as a 50th birthday present in 2000.
===Peter Frampton===

A replica of the three-pickup &quot;Black Beauty&quot; Les Paul Custom used by Peter Frampton as his main guitar from his days in Humble Pie through his early solo career was introduced through the Gibson Custom Shop in 2012. Frampton&#x27;s original guitar was a 1954 Les Paul modified extensively. His guitar was presumed lost in a South American plane crash in 1980, but was returned to Frampton in 2011.

===Mike Bloomfield===
Gibson used hundreds of photographs of the late blues guitarist&#x27;s instrument to produce the limited-edition Bloomfield signature. The company produced one hundred Bloomfield models with custom-aged finishes and two hundred more with the company&#x27;s VOS finishing in 2009. They reproduced the tailpiece crack on the aged version, plus the mismatched volume and tone control knobs and the &quot;Les Paul&quot;-engraved truss rod cover on both versions, while including a toggle switch cover. The headstock was characterized by the kidney-shaped Grover tuning keys installed on the guitar before Bloomfield traded for it.
===Pete Townshend===

In 2005, Gibson issued three Pete Townshend signature edition Les Paul Deluxe guitars, based on Townshend&#x27;s heavily customised &quot;#1&quot; Wine Red 1976 Les Paul Deluxe, &quot;#3&quot; Gold top 1976, and &quot;#9&quot; Cherry Sunburst 1976. These guitars were modified by Alan Rogan and used extensively on stage and in the studio with The Who. In addition to the two mini-humbuckers the guitar carried, Rogan modified Townshend&#x27;s originals with a DiMarzio humbucker in the middle. Toggle switches located behind the guitar&#x27;s tailpiece turned the pickup on and off and added volume boost. The control knobs were wired for volume, one for each pickup and a master tone. The reissues differed from Townshend&#x27;s originals in that the reissues had an inlay at the first fret while the originals did not.

===Ace Frehley===

The Ace Frehley signature model (released in 1997 and re-released in 2012) has three double-white DiMarzio pickups, a cherry sunburst finish (AAAA), a color image of Frehley&#x27;s face in his Kiss make-up on the headstock, mother-of-pearl lightning bolt inlays, and Frehley&#x27;s simulated signature on the 12th fret. A Custom Shop run of only 300 guitars were built with DiMarzio PAF, Super Distortion, and Dual Sound pickups. The production run model was only built with DiMarzio Super Distortion pickups. This was one of Gibson&#x27;s best selling artist runs. The more recent 2012 &quot;Budokan&quot; model, intended to pay tribute to the guitar used during the Kiss&#x27; first trip to Japan in 1977, features mother-of-pearl block inlays (no signature at the 12th fret), Grover machine heads with pearloid banjo buttons, and a grade A maple top.

===Billy Gibbons===
Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top has a signature model, featuring his signature Seymour Duncan pickup set, based on his &quot;Pearly Gates&quot; 1959 Les Paul Standard.

===Eric Clapton===
Clapton played a 1960 Standard as a member of John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers as well as in the early days of Cream. The guitar was said to have been stolen while Clapton was preparing for the first Cream tour in 1966, following the recording of &quot;Fresh Cream&quot;, and was long considered an iconic instrument by Clapton&#x27;s fans. Gibson announced production of the Clapton 1960 Standard, also nicknamed the &quot;Beano Burst&quot;, in 2010. Gibson says the instrument &quot;accurately represents what Eric Clapton personally feels his 1960 Les Paul should be&quot;, with Clapton consulting on the design of the guitar. Production is limited but all feature period-correct hardware, two Gibson reproduction PAF humbucking pickups, and subtly figured &quot;antiquity burst&quot; maple tops.

===Mark Knopfler===

Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits played a 1958 Les Paul on tracks such as &quot;Money for Nothing&quot;, having used it both in the studio and live on stage. In 2016, Gibson released a signature model of his 1958 Les Paul Standard.

===Paul Kossoff===

Paul Kossoff, of Free and Back Street Crawler, favored a 1959 Les Paul Standard. In 2011–12, Gibson&#x27;s Custom Shop made a reproduction of Kossoff&#x27;s Standard, featuring a so-called &quot;green-lemon&quot; flametop, two-piece carved maple top, mahogany body and neck, Custom Bucker humbucking pickups and kidney-bean shaped Grover tuners similar to those Kossoff had installed on the instrument. One hundred Kossoff models were made to resemble the guitar at the time of Kossoff&#x27;s death in 1976, with another 250 in a VOS finish.

===Marc Bolan===

Marc Bolan of T.Rex played a late-50s Les Paul, potentially a stripped Goldtop, later refitted with a Les Paul Custom neck. Gibson recreated this unique guitar in 2011, producing 450 examples including 100 hand-aged, numbered versions and 350 utilising the vintage original spec process. The guitars are notable for the custom-made PAF-reproduction uncovered humbucker pickups. The guitars feature a custom finish, referred to by Gibson as &quot;Bolan chablis&quot;.

===Adam Jones===
Adam Jones of Tool has played a 1979 Silverburst Les Paul since the bands inception. The guitars themselves were created for a short amount of time. Jones said in an interview in 1995 that he once owned 5 at a time. In June 2020, Adam Jones announced via his Instagram that a signature model made by Gibson based on his guitar was in production. Two different models were made: a custom version that was sold for a limited time and a standard version which is more readily available. Jones later teased an Epiphone signature in 2021 of the same guitar, which was first released in December 2022 as one of seven collectible versions featuring visual art at the back.

==Les Paul copies and lawsuits==
Although early Les Paul imitations in the 1960s and 1970s, such as those made by Höfner, Hagström, Harmony Company, and Greco differed from Gibson&#x27;s designs, with different electronics and even bolt-on necks, in the late 1970s some Japanese companies came very close to perfecting copies of the original 1958–1960 Standards.

A lawsuit was brought by the Norlin Corporation (the parent company of Gibson) in 1977, against Elger/Hoshino U.S.A. (manufacturer and distributor, respectively, of Ibanez) over the use a headstock shape and logo, both considered similar to the Gibson designs. However, the suit was based on an Ibanez headstock design that had been discontinued by 1976. The case was officially closed on February 2, 1978. These mid-1970s guitars later became known as &quot;lawsuit era&quot; guitars.

ESP Guitars makes several guitars based on the Les Paul design. The Edwards and Navigator lines are made in Japan in the vein of the late 1970s and 1980s guitars from Tokai, Burny, and Greco, complete with Gibson style headstocks.

Heritage Guitars, founded in 1985 by four long-time Gibson employees when Gibson relocated to Nashville, continues to build guitars at the original factory in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Many of their models are inspired by Gibson&#x27;s late-1950s/early-1960s sunbursts and Customs.

In 2006, Gibson lost a lawsuit against PRS Guitars, Gibson claiming PRS was infringing on the Les Paul shape and design. The court&#x27;s decision allowed PRS to reintroduce single cutaway versions of its instruments.

In 2008, Gibson lost the trademark for the Les Paul in Finland. According to the court, &quot;Les Paul&quot; has become a common noun for guitars of a certain type. The lawsuit began when Gibson sued Musamaailma, which produces Tokai guitars, for trademark violation. However, several witnesses testified that the term &quot;Les Paul&quot; denotes character in a guitar rather than a particular guitar model. The court also found it aggravating that Gibson had used Les Paul in the plural form and that the importer of Gibson guitars had used Les Paul as a common noun.

<text>In phonology, assimilation is a sound change in which some phonemes (typically consonants or vowels) change to become more similar to other nearby sounds. This process is common across languages and can happen within a word or between words. For example, in English &quot;handbag&quot; (), the often shifts to in rapid speech, becoming , because and are both bilabial (produced with both lips), and their places of articulation are similar. 

It occurs in normal speech but is more frequent in faster speech. Sometimes the change is accepted as canonical, and can even become recognized in standard spelling: implosion pronounced with , composed of &quot;in-&quot; + &quot;-plosion&quot; (as in &quot;explosion&quot;).

Sound segments typically assimilate to a following sound, but they may also assimilate to a preceding one. Assimilation most commonly occurs between immediately adjacent sounds but may occur between sounds separated by others. For example, in &quot;handbag,&quot; the is sometimes elided (omitted), which causes the to assimilate to [m] before the . 

Assimilation can be synchronic, an active process in a language at a given point in time, or diachronic, a historical sound change—for instance, &quot;cupboard,&quot; historically a compound of &quot;cup&quot; () and &quot;board&quot; (), is now pronounced , with the original almost never used.

A related process, coarticulation, includes changes like vowels nasalizing (taking on a nasal sound) before nasal consonants () due to premature soft palate (velum) lowering, or /b/ labializing (lips rounding) as in &quot;boot&quot; () or &quot;ball&quot; in some accents. This article describes both processes under the term &quot;assimilation&quot;.

==Concept==
The physiological or psychological mechanisms of coarticulation are unknown, and coarticulation is often loosely referred to as a segment being &quot;triggered&quot; by an assimilatory change in another segment. In assimilation, the phonological patterning of the language, discourse styles and accent are some of the factors contributing to changes observed.

There are four configurations found in assimilations: 
*Between adjacent segments.
*Between segments separated by one or more intervening segments.
*Changes made in reference to a preceding segment
*Changes made in reference to a following segment

Although all four occur, changes in regard to a following adjacent segment account for virtually all assimilatory changes and most of the regular ones. Assimilations to an adjacent segment are vastly more frequent than assimilations to a nonadjacent one. Those radical asymmetries might contain hints about the mechanisms involved, but they are not obvious.

If a sound changes with reference to a following segment, it is traditionally called &quot;regressive assimilation&quot;. Changes with reference to a preceding segment are traditionally called &quot;progressive&quot;. Many find those terms confusing, as they seem to mean the opposite of the intended meaning. Accordingly, a variety of alternative terms have arisen, not all of which avoid the problem of the traditional terms. Regressive assimilation is also known as right-to-left, leading, or anticipatory assimilation. Progressive assimilation is also known as left-to-right, perseveratory, preservative, lagging, or lag assimilation. The terms anticipatory and lag are used here.

Occasionally, two sounds (invariably adjacent) may influence each other in reciprocal assimilation. When such a change results in a single segment with some of the features of both components, it is known as coalescence or fusion.

Assimilation occurs in two different types: complete assimilation, in which the sound affected by assimilation becomes exactly the same as the sound causing assimilation, and partial assimilation, in which the sound becomes the same in one or more features but remains different in other features.

Tonal languages may exhibit tone assimilation (in effect tonal umlaut), but sign languages also exhibit assimilation when the characteristics of neighbouring cheremes may be mixed.

==Examples==
===Anticipatory assimilation to an adjacent segment===
Anticipatory assimilation to an adjacent segment is the most common type of assimilation by far, and typically has the character of a conditioned sound change, i.e., it applies to the whole lexicon or part of it.
For example, in English, the place of articulation of nasals assimilates to that of a following stop (&quot;handkerchief&quot; is pronounced , &quot;handbag&quot; in rapid speech is pronounced ).

In Italian, voiceless stops assimilated historically to a following :
* Latin &quot;eight&quot; &gt; It. 
* Latin &quot;bed&quot; &gt; 
* Latin – pronounced &quot;under&quot; &gt; 

Italian &quot;otto&quot;, &quot;letto&quot; and &quot;sotto&quot; are examples of historical restructuring: &quot;otto&quot; and &quot;letto&quot; no longer contain /kt/ pronounced [tt], and &quot;sotto&quot; is no longer the structure /bt/ subject to the partial assimilation of devoicing of /b/ and full assimilation to produce [tt]. Over time, phonetic [tt] as a frequent assimilation of /kt/ and /bt/ was rather reinterpreted as reflecting /tt/. The structural sequence /kt/ is now all but absent in Italian, since all items in popular speech underwent the same restructuring, /kt/ &gt; /tt/. On the rare occasion that Italian /kt/ is encountered, however, the same assimilation that triggered the restructuring can occur at the phonetic level. For example, the medical term &quot;ictus&quot; &#x27;stroke&#x27;, a relatively recent direct borrowing from Latin, is usually pronounced [ˈiktus] in deliberate speech, but [ˈittus] is frequent in more casual registers.

* Latin &quot;ictus&quot; &gt; Italian &quot;ictus&quot;, pronounced either [ˈiktus] or [ˈittus]

==== Affrication in English ====
There has been a notable change recognized across a variety of English dialects regarding the pronunciation of the and consonant clusters. Starting around the mid-20th century, the alveolar stop in has slowly been replaced by a post-alveolar affricate instead, resulting in the all-postalveolar consonant clusters and . This phenomenon also occurs in , resulting in the all-postalveolar consonant cluster . The affrication of has been seen in American English, British English, Australian English, and New Zealand English. It is suspected that this change has occurred due to assimilation.

One of the first papers that discussed the affrication of is &quot;Pre-School Children&#x27;s Knowledge of English Phonology&quot; by Charles Read, published in 1971. The study discussed in this paper focuses on how children in pre-school analyze the phonetic aspect of language in order to determine the proper spelling of English words. Read noticed that many of the children involved in the study misspelled words that began with , spelling words like &quot;troubles&quot; and &quot;dragon&quot; as &quot;chribls&quot; and &quot;jragin&quot;, respectively. In a different test, Read also found that many of the children believed that words like &quot;train&quot; and &quot;chicken&quot; both started with .

=== Anticipatory assimilation at a distance ===
Anticipatory assimilation at a distance is rare and usually merely an accident in the history of a specific word.
*Standard Slovene (a toponym) &gt; Slovene dialect 
*Slovene &gt; (a mountain ridge)

However, the diverse and common assimilations known as umlaut in which the phonetics of a vowel are influenced by the phonetics of a vowel in a following syllable, are common and in the nature of sound laws. Such changes abound in the histories of Germanic languages, Romance, Insular Celtic, Albanian, and many others.

For example, in the history of English, a back vowel became front if a high front vowel or semivowel (*i, ī, j) was in the following syllable, and a front vowel became higher unless it was already high:
* Proto-Germanic &quot;mice&quot; &gt; Old English &gt; Modern English &quot;mice&quot;
* PGmc &quot;better&quot; &gt; OE 
* PGmc &quot;feet&quot; &gt; OE &gt; ME &quot;feet&quot;

On the other hand, Proto-Germanic and &gt; respectively before in the following syllable (Germanic a-mutation) although that had already happened significantly earlier:
*PGmc &gt; OE 
*PGmc &gt; OE 

Another example of a regular change is the sibilant assimilation of Sanskrit in which if there were two different sibilants as the onset of successive syllables, a plain was always replaced by the palatal :
* Proto-Indo-European - &quot;beard&quot; &gt; Skt. -
* PIE - &quot;gray&quot; &gt; Skt. - &quot;rabbit&quot;
* PIE - &quot;husband&#x27;s mother&#x27; &gt; Skt. -

=== Lag assimilation to an adjacent segment ===
Lag assimilation to an adjacent segment is tolerably common and often has the nature of a sound law.

Proto-Indo-European becomes in both Germanic and Italic: &quot;hill&quot; &gt; PreLat. &gt; Lat. ; &gt; PGmc &gt; OE &gt; &quot;hill&quot;. The enclitic form of English &quot;is&quot;, eliding the vowel, becomes voiceless when adjacent to a word-final voiceless nonsibilant: &quot;it is&quot; , &quot;that is&quot; &gt; &quot;it&#x27;s&quot; , &quot;that&#x27;s&quot; .

In Polish, regularly becomes after a voiceless obstruent:
* &#x27;flower&#x27;, pronounced , instead of 
* &#x27;face&#x27;, pronounced , instead of 

This does not apply across word boundaries, so that the placename Grodzisk Wielkopolski is pronounced , not . In that context, patterns with other voiced obstruents.

Because of a similar process, Proto-Indo-Iranian became in Avestan: Old Avestan &#x27;horse&#x27; corresponds to Sanskrit 

=== Lag assimilation at a distance ===
Lag assimilation at a distance is rare and usually sporadic (except when part of a broader change, as for the Sanskrit - example, above): Greek &gt; Lat. &quot;lily&quot;.

In vowel harmony, a vowel&#x27;s phonetic features are often influenced by those of a preceding vowel. For example, most Finnish case markers come in two forms, with (written ) and (written ), depending on whether the preceding vowel is back or front. However, it is difficult to know where and how in the history of Finnish an actual &quot;assimilatory change&quot; took place. The &quot;distribution&quot; of pairs of endings in Finnish is not the operation of an assimilatory innovation, but it is probably the outbirth of such an innovation long ago.

In the opposite direction, in umlaut, a vowel is modified to conform more closely to the vowel in the next syllable.

=== Coalescence (fusion) ===

Coalescence is a phonological situation whereby adjacent sounds are replaced by a single sound that shares the features of the two originally adjacent sounds. In other words, coalescence is a type of assimilation whereby two sounds fuse to become one, and the fused sound shares similar characteristics with the two fused sounds. Some examples in English include ‘don’t you’ -&gt; /dəʊnt ju/ -&gt; [dəʊntʃu]. In this instance, /t/ and /j/ have fused to [tʃ]. /tʃ/ is a palato-alveolar sound; its palatal feature is derived from /j/ while its alveolar is from /t/. Another English example is ‘would you’ -&gt; /wʊd ju/ -&gt; [wʊdʒu]. There are examples in other languages, such as Chumburung where /ɪ̀wú ɪ̀sá/ -&gt; /ɪ̀wúɪ̀sá/ becomes [ɪ̀wɪ́sá] - ‘three horns’. In this case, /ɪ/ is retained in the coalescence and the rising tone on /u/ appears on the coalesced sound.

There are two major types of coalescence: reductive and unreductive. Reductive coalescence is the type of coalescence where sound segments are reduced after fusion is made. For example, in Xhosa, /i - lˈalaini/ becomes /e - lˈoleni/ (side). The /a-i/ segment in the first form reduces to /e/. On the other hand non-reductive coalescence have no reduction in sound segments even though there is evidence of fusion. For example, in Shona, [v_á] [tengesa] (they sell) becomes [ku] [téngésá] (to sell). Here, the original sound does not reduce with respect to sound segments even though the rising tone on the vowels in the coalesced form indicates the fusion of /á/ to the vowels.

<text>Alésia () is a station of the Paris Métro on line 4 in the 14th arrondissement situated in Petit-Montrouge quarter.

==Location==
The station is located under the Place Victor-et-Hélène-Basch and its surroundings, dominated by the Saint-Pierre-de-Montrouge church. It is located at the intersection of Avenue du Maine, Avenue General Leclerc and Rue d&#x27;Alésia, between the Porte d&#x27;Orleans and Mouton-Duvernet metro stations.

==History==
The line 4 platforms were opened on 30 October 1909 when the southern section of the line opened between Raspail and Porte d&#x27;Orléans. The name refers to Rue d&#x27;Alésia, named for the Battle of Alesia between the Gauls of Vercingetorix and the Romans of Julius Caesar.

Recently this station has been retrofitted with platform screen doors, due to the RATP working on the line 4&#x27;s automation.

This stop is featured in the animated films &quot;The Twelve Tasks of Asterix&quot;, in the chapter named &quot;Survive the Cave of the Beast&quot;. The choice of this station is due to the origin of its name.

It saw 5,113,245 travelers enter in 2018, which places it at the 88th position of metro stations for its usage.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has six entrances:
* Entrance 1: pl. Victor-et-Hélène-Basch: first staircase at 230 avenue du Maine;
* Entrance 2: Rue du Moulin-Vert: second staircase in front of 230 avenue du Maine;
* Entrance 3: av. from Maine: stairs in front of 205 Avenue du Maine, on the west side of Saint-Pierre-de-Montrouge church;
* Entrance 4: Saint-Pierre-de-Montrouge Church: staircase at 82 Avenue du Général-Leclerc, on the east side of the church;
* Entrance 5: av. General-Leclerc: escalator from the platform of the subway direction Porte d&#x27;Orleans in front of 82 Avenue du Général-Leclerc;
* Entrance 6: Rue Alésia: staircase in front of 75 Avenue du Général-Leclerc.

===Station layout===


===Platforms===
Alésia is a standard configuration station. The platforms are separated by the metro tracks in the center. The walls are curved and the roof is elliptical. The platforms are being worked on as part of the automation of Line 4. Up until 2016, it was laid out in yellow &quot;Ouï-dire&quot; style with lighting strips, of the same color, supported by fake curved shaped consoles. The direct lighting is white and, contrary to most of the light strips of this style, indirect lighting. The white ceramic tiles are flat and cover the walls, the roof and the tympans. Advertising frames were yellow and cylindrical. The platforms was also equipped with &quot;Motte&quot; style seats and yellow &quot;sit-stand&quot; benches.

Since the beginning of 2016, the tiles and the lightning strips of the &quot;Ouï-dire&quot; platforms were renovated from 11 January 2016 to 30 June 2017. Since November 2018, the station&#x27;s docks have been completely renovated, fitted with platform screen doors as part of the automation of Line 4.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by the Lines 38, 62, 68, 92 and the urban service &quot;Lignes de bus Traverses de Paris&quot; of the RATP Bus Network and, at night, by the N14, N21 and N66 lines of the Noctilien network.

<text>Porte d&#x27;Orléans (Général Leclerc) () is a station of line 4 of the Paris Métro and a stop on tramway line 3a. It is situated in the 14th Arrondissement, in the &quot;quartier&quot; of Petit-Montrouge. The station is the former southern terminus of line 4. A terminal loop was provided at the station for trains to turn around to return north towards Porte de Clignancourt. Passengers used to disembark at the arrival platform and then the train proceeded empty via the loop to the departure platform.
The extension to Mairie de Montrouge modified the layout of the station, the northbound platform was extended toward the track coming from the former terminal loop to add a new entrance.

==History==
The station was opened on 30 October 1909 as part of the second section of line 4 opened between &quot;Porte d&#x27;Orléans&quot; and Raspail before it was connected under the Seine on 9 January 1910. In 2006, Paris Tramway Line 3 (now 3a) opened, with a stop at &quot;Porte d&#x27;Orléans&quot;.

The station lies just on the Parisian side of the border with Montrouge, the neighbouring commune. In 2013, line 4 was extended south into Montrouge, with a future extension toward Bagneux planned. This should reduce bus traffic around the Porte d&#x27;Orléans.

The station is named after the &quot;Porte d&#x27;Orléans&quot;, a gate in the nineteenth century Thiers wall of Paris, which led to the town of Orléans via the road now known as route nationale 20, or N20. Its subtitle is for the World War II general Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque, known by his &quot;nom de guerre&quot; of Général Leclerc. On 25 August 1944, Leclerc entered Paris via the Porte d&#x27;Orléans with tanks of the 2nd Armored division, on his way to liberate Paris from the German occupation.

A memorial to Leclerc is near the station, between Rue de la Légion Étrangère and Avenue de la Porte-d&#x27;Orléans. On the west side of Rue de la Légion Étrangère is Square du Serment-de-Koufra, a park commemorating a pledge made by Leclerc on 2 March 1941, the day after taking the Italian fort at Kufra, Libya: he swore that his weapons would not be laid down until the French flag flew over the cathedrals of Metz and of Strasbourg.

<text>Badgerys Creek, also known as Badgery&#x27;s Creek or Aerotropolis, is a suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia, located approximately west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government areas of the City of Liverpool. It is part of the Greater Western Sydney region and is adjacent to Kemps Creek, Austral and the Blue Mountains.

The suburb is best known as being the most favoured site for a second Sydney Airport. In April 2014, the Abbott government confirmed the construction of the Western Sydney Airport, initially scheduling construction in 2016, but construction actually began in September 2018 and is currently scheduled for completion in 2026.

==History==
James Badgery was a British-born farmer and miller who, in 1806, was granted in the suburb that bears his name today. His original land grant was on the north side of Elizabeth Drive; land which today is used for farming research by the CSIRO and University of Sydney. Badgery named his property &quot;Exeter Farm&quot; but the creek running through the property became known as Badgery&#x27;s Creek and that name was eventually applied to the local area.

Badgery bought other land to the south of his grant and after he died, the area was subdivided in the 1880s, vastly increasing the local population. Badgerys Creek Post Office opened on 10 July 1894 and closed in 1989. A school was established in 1895 and the area gradually developed as a rural suburb which by 1981 had a population of .

From 1954 until 1991, the Fleurs field station at Badgerys Creek was an important site for Australian radio astronomy, hosting several radio telescope arrays. The station was initially operated by CSIRO, and then later by the University of Sydney.

In 1986, the federal government announced that the Second Sydney Airport would be sited at Badgerys Creek. The government bought a number of properties for that purpose, and as a result of that, as well as concerns about living near an airport, many people moved away, meaning that by 1996 there were fewer than 500 residents. By the the population had further shrunk to 168. Construction of the airport hadn&#x27;t started, but in 2012 an 8 million report into Sydney&#x27;s aviation needs found that Badgerys Creek remained the best site, with construction subsequently scheduled to start in 2016.

In March 2023, a south-eastern portion of Badgerys Creek became part of the newly-gazetted suburb of Bradfield.

==Geography==
Badgerys Creek flows north into a reservoir in the suburb&#x27;s north, as does South Creek, the suburb&#x27;s eastern boundary. West of the reservoir lies Mills Hill, and south-west of that, by just over a kilometre, is Raymond Hill, . The western boundary is Oaky Creek, and then Cosgrove Creek after the two merge north of Elizabeth Drive, and to the south-west the hill known as Anchau ( ).

===Climate===
Badgerys Creek has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) with hot summers, which vary from dry to humid, and cool winters. Due to its open grassy location, nighttime temperatures are slightly cooler than the nearby suburban areas in western Sydney. There is the occasional frost in some winter mornings, where the months from April to September have recorded severe frost. Most of the rain falls in late summer and early autumn, which is usually accompanied by a thunderstorm. Due to the foehn effect, the driest months are in late winter and early spring, which have the most sunniest days.

On 4 January 2020, a heat logger registered a temperature of in the suburb, which was on the same day when Penrith recorded a temperature of .

==Commercial area==
North of Elizabeth Drive, a substantial amount of land is taken up by the CSIRO Research Station, the University of Sydney MacGarvie Smith Veterinary Farm, and a landfill depot. Much of the research establishment is dotted with reservoirs. The southeast includes a brickworks, and land owned by Telstra, also featuring a number of reservoirs. The suburb is also home to the Hubertus Liverpool Rifle Club.

South of Elizabeth Drive was also a settled area.

===Schools===
The suburb had one primary school, Badgerys Creek Public School, decommissioned in 2014 to make way for Sydney&#x27;s second airport. Nearby there were two churches with cemeteries, also moved.

==Demographics==
In the , there were 168 people in Badgerys Creek. 51.2% of respondents were born in Australia; the next most common countries of birth included China (excluding SARs and Taiwan) 13.1%, Italy 6.0%, Malta 4.8% and Lebanon 3.0%. 39.9% of people only spoke English at home; the next most common languages spoken at home included Cantonese 20.8%, Italian 7.7%, Arabic 5.4%, Khmer 5.4% and Maltese 4.2%.

==Parks==
The suburb is home to Badgerys Creek Park.

==Transport==

The under-construction Western Sydney Airport is located within the suburb of Badgerys Creek. The suburb will also be serviced by the Airport Terminal and Airport Business Park stations of the Western Sydney Airport metro line. Both stations are located within the airport complex.

The M12 Motorway is currently under construction and is parallel to Elizabeth Drive. Both roads run east-west through the suburb.

The airport, metro stations and M12 Motorway will be completed in 2026.

<text>Église de Pantin () is a station of the Paris Métro, serving line 5. It is named after the nearby Église Saint-Germain de Pantin, a local church.

==History==

The station opened on 12 October 1942 with the commissioning of the extension of line 5 from Gare du Nord to Eglise de Pantin, servings as its terminus until 25 April 1985 when it was extended to Bobigny–Pablo Picasso. As a result, there are four tracks and a scissors crossover just east of the station; two of which are used to reverse the direction of trains.

The station was an important connecting point with the bus lines running on the Route nationale 3 towards the eastern suburbs. A role whose importance declined with the extension of the line towards &quot;Bobigny&quot;.

On the morning of 7 June 1982, after a violent storm the day before, rainwater rushed through the construction site of the extension towards &quot;Bobigny&quot;, flooding the station. Eighteen trains were rendered unusable, affecting the operation of the line. Emergency equipment had to be transferred from the other lines including Sprague-Thomson trains from line 9 were used to mitigate the consequences of the accident. 

As part of the &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; programme by the RATP, the station was renovated and modernised on 23 June 2006.

In 2024, it will be served by line 3 of the T Zen network, a bus rapid transit system. It was originally slated to open 2018, then postponed to the end of 2022, then again to 2024.

In 2019, the station was used by 3,843,796 passengers, making it the 127th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 2,139,986 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 112th busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 2,832,467 passengers, making it the 119th busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.

<text>Hoche () is a station of the Paris Métro, serving line 5. It is named after the nearby rue Hoche, which in turn was named after Lazare Hoche (1768-1797), a general during the French Revolution who at the age of 25, commanded the Army of the Moselle in which he drove the Austrians back to Wœrth, cleared Landau and Alsace. The platform in the direction of &quot;Bobigny&quot; contains in a display case where a bust of Lazare Hoche as well as several images evoking his life as a general were installed.

==History==
The station opened on 12 October 1942 when the line was extended from Gare du Nord to Église de Pantin.

As part of the &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; programme by the RATP, the station was renovated and modernised on 30 August 2002.

In 2024, it will be served by line 3 of the T Zen network, a bus rapid transit system. It was originally slated to open in 2018, then postponed to the end of 2022, then again to 2024.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has three accesses:

* Access 1: rue Hoche
* Access 2: rue du Pré-Saint-Gervais &quot;Centre Commercial&quot;
* Access 3: rue Charles Nodier (with an ascending escalator)

===Station layout===
===Platforms===

Hoche has a standard platform configuration: it has two side platforms separated by the two tracks under an elliptical vault. It has white and rounded lighting bands in the &quot;Gaudin&quot; style of the metro revival of the 2000s and white bevelled ceramic tiles cover the walls, vault, tunnel exits and outlets of the corridors. The platforms are equipped with benches made of slats. Its advertising frame is made up of brown faience in a simple geometric pattern and the letter &quot;M&quot; surmounted on it, a feature only found in seven other stations on the network.

For more than ten years until 2018, the name of the station on the walls of the platforms were written in Parisine font on thin plates, covering the original names that were made of faience. As with Filles du Calvaire on line 8 and Porte des Lilas on line 11, they were removed and the faience signs were restored.

===Other connections===
The station is also served by lines 151, 170, 330, and the P&#x27;tit Bus of the RATP Bus Network, and at night, by lines N13, N41, and N45 of the Noctilien network.

<doc id="504145" wikidata="Q838533" url="?curid=504145" title="Ford Orion">
<text>The Ford Orion is a small family car (C-segment in Europe) that was produced by Ford Europe from 1983 until 1993. A total of 3,534,239 units were sold during the car&#x27;s ten-year production life.

The Ford Orion was based on the Ford Escort, but instead of the Escort&#x27;s hatchback, the Orion had a separate boot, making it a four-door saloon. Visually, the Ford Orion&#x27;s notchback rear end and greater rear overhang made it readily distinguishable from the Escort.

The nameplate &quot;Orion&quot; is derived from the constellation, named after a Greek hunter.

==History==

===Orion Mark I (1983–1986)===

In the early-1980s, Ford&#x27;s model line-up and image was changing, reflecting shifting patterns in the new car market across Western Europe at this time, as front-wheel drive gradually became more popular than rear-wheel drive and hatchbacks began to eclipse traditional saloons and estates. The company&#x27;s older saloon line-up was replaced mainly by hatchbacks, starting with the Escort MK3 in 1980 and the new Sierra which replaced the Cortina in 1982. By 1985, even the executive-class Granada would offer a hatchback bodystyle, with the saloon and estate models not being released until 1990 and 1992 respectively, while a saloon version of the Sierra, called the Sapphire, was finally launched in 1987.

The Orion was developed under the codename &quot;Apollo.&quot; Launched in September 1983, the Orion was designed to fill the market demand for a traditional four-door saloon which had been absent from the Escort range since the end of MK2 production in 1980 and also in larger cars by the demise of the hugely popular Cortina in 1982. The Orion looked similar to a contemporary Escort at the front apart from the different grille design, but the rear of the Orion had a long flat boot (making the car a three-box saloon design) rather than a hatchback or estate body like the Escort. Although the Orion&#x27;s length was similar to that of the contemporary Ford Sierra (then only available as a hatchback or an estate) it had more rear legroom and a larger boot. This concept was similar to the Volkswagen Jetta, the saloon version of the Golf hatchback which had been on sale since 1979.

Ford initially offered the Orion in only GL and Ghia trim levels, missing out on the lower specification levels available on the Escort, as well as the basic 1100cc engine. Only 1300 cc and 1600 cc CVH engine options were available from launch (though with both carburettor and fuel injection options on the 1.6 Ghia). A lower specification L model was introduced in 1984, as was the option of a 1.6 diesel engine on L and GL models.

The Orion Ghia 1.6i standard features included: central locking, sunroof, sport front seats, electric windows, rear head restraints, tachometer and an information binnacle informing the driver when the vehicle needed maintenance. All of these features were rare equipment on a small family car in the 1980s, giving the Orion upmarket pretensions.

The Orion 1.6i shared an engine with the Escort XR3i and offered similar performance and handling without the insurance unfriendly tag that the XR badge started to command in the late-1980s due to its popularity with car thieves - and it was also less frequently targeted by thieves than the Escort XR3i or RS Turbo. The 1.6i was topped by a luxury limited edition called the 1600E in the autumn of 1988, the 1600E name harking back to the Mark II Ford Cortina 1600E from twenty years earlier, as both were considered to be well-equipped saloon cars with decent performance for the working man. The Orion 1600E was available in black, white and metallic grey and had RS alloys, wood cappings on the dashboard and doors, and grey leather seats. Only 1,600 were made, of which 1,000 had leather trim.

With the facelift in 1986, Ford brought the styling and engineering of the Orion closer to the Escort&#x27;s and lower-specification models crept into the range along with equipment levels being brought together between the two cars, and helped Orion sales increase further. The Orion also gained the new 1.4 &quot;lean burn&quot; petrol engine which was added to the Escort at this time.

The success of the Orion across Europe, particularly in the UK (where it was amongst the top 10 best-selling cars every year from 1984 to 1990), was followed by several other manufacturers launching saloon versions of their popular hatchbacks. By 1986, General Motors had launched a saloon version of its Opel Kadett/Vauxhall Astra hatchback, which was sold as the Vauxhall Belmont on the British market. Austin Rover, on the other hand, made use of a Honda design for its new Rover 200 Series saloon, which was launched in 1984 and gave buyers a booted alternative to the Maestro hatchback, although with a totally different platform; as the true booted variant of the Maestro was the larger and more upmarket Austin Montego. The Orion was launched around the same time as the Fiat Regata, saloon and estate versions of the Ritmo (sold under name &quot;Strada&quot; in the UK), although the Regata was aimed further upmarket at cars like the Ford Sierra.

The Orion was a strong seller in the UK, peaking as the seventh-best-selling car in 1987 and 1988 with over 70,000 sales each time.

===Orion Mark II (1986–1990)===

March 1986 saw the Orion getting the same facelift as the Escort. Internally within Ford it is regarded as an updated model (Apollo-86) rather than a new generation, although it is popularly known as the Mark II. The Mark II brought the option of anti-lock-brakes (ABS) and a heated front windscreen to the range. The base &quot;L&quot; version came with an additional 1.3 litre engine option which used the OHV &quot;&#x27;Valencia&#x27; engine as used on the Escort, whilst a new 1.4 litre CVH engine option was introduced. This (along with the 1.6 CVH ) was a &quot;lean burn unit&quot; and various models in the range could run on unleaded fuel without modifications to the cylinder head or to the fuel system. Improved locks were fitted across the range initially being of the Chubb AVA design but soon after replaced with the Tibbe type; same as with the Escort, and a number of other improvements were carried out including new suspension and gearbox mounts, updated interior and trim changes, improved soundproofing and revised steering and suspension settings. Trim levels now included the entry-level L, Biscane (special edition) LX, Equipe (special edition) GL, GLS (special edition), Ghia, Ghia Injection and from 1988 the 1600E (special edition).
===Orion Mark III (1990–1993)===
The third and final version of the Orion was launched in September 1990, but received the same criticism from the motoring media that the fifth generation Escort endured at the time for its lack of design flair as well as the disappointing refinement of some of its engines — particularly the 1.3 and 1.4-litre CVH petrol units. As with the Escort, the arrival of the 1.6 and 1.8 litre Zetec 16 valve engines and suspension changes in late 1991 and late 1992 improved the Orion&#x27;s dynamic qualities. The Mark III was identified at the front by clear indicator lenses and by a chrome bar that ran through the radiator grille. The range topping Orion Ghia Si (sports injection) had out of its 1.8L DOHC Zetec unit, making this the fastest production model Orion that Ford produced through the car&#x27;s ten-year production life, with a top speed of 126 mph. A facelift to the Escort and Orion range including side impact bars, front seatbelt pretensioners and a safety cage as well as body colour door handles and the new Zetec engines in September 1992 for the 1993 model year also saw many major improvements.

This incarnation of the Orion was considerably less popular than the pre-1990 versions, just missing out on a place in the top 10 best-selling cars in Britain in 1991 and 1992.
Trim levels were:
* L (1992–1993), 1.8 diesel
* LX (1990–1993), 1.3, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8 16v petrol, 1.8 diesel
* GLX (1990–1991), 1.3, 1.4, 1.6 petrol (dropped after 1991)
* Ghia (1990–1993), 1.3, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8 16v petrol, 1.8 diesel
* Ghia Si (1992–1993), 1.8 16v petrol

On 19 September 1993, 10 years after its launch, Ford retired the Orion nameplate, and the Escort nameplate was used on all bodystyles. This was a move that Vauxhall had previously taken with the Belmont name back in September 1991. Sales of the Escort badged saloon were not as strong as those achieved by the Orion, as saloons of this size continued to fall in popularity throughout the 1990s. The slow-selling Escort saloon was eventually discontinued in October 1998, along with the convertible model after the launch of the Focus saloon, although the 5-door hatchback and estate versions lasted until July 2000 and the van lasted until 2002.

It is named after the nearby avenue de la Porte de Pantin, on the edge of Paris leading to the town of Pantin. It was in turn named after the nearby Porte de Pantin, one of the former gates of Paris. The station&#x27;s name has been subtitled &quot;Parc de la Villette&quot; since the creation of the eponymous park in 1987 on the site of the former slaughterhouses of La Villette to the north of the station which closed in 1974.

==History==

The station opened on 12 October 1942 when the line was extended from Gare du Nord to Église de Pantin.

As part of the &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; programme by the RATP, the station was renovated and modernised on 4 September 2003.

In September 2005, in partnership with the RATP and STIF, the Institut pour la ville en mouvement (IVM) installed relief tables at the station as well as at Porte de la Villette on line 7 and Basilique de Saint-Denis on line 13. They are relief maps of the neighbourhood surrounding the station. It is intended to help the blind and those who are visually imparied have tactile information at the exits of the stations on the surroundings as well as nearby cultural sites.

In 2024, it will be served by line 3 of the T Zen network, a bus rapid transit system, serving as its western terminus. It was originally slated to open in 2018, then postponed to the end of 2022, then again to 2024.

In 2019, the station was used by 5,615,256 passengers, making it the 69th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 2,336,476 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 97th busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 3,374,733 passengers, making it the 89th busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.

==Passenger services==

=== Access ===
The station has four accesses:

* Access 1: avenue Jean Jaurès &quot;Parc de la Villette&quot; (with a lift)
* Access 2: sente des Dorées (with an ascending escalator)
* Access 3: rue Adolphe Mille
* Access 4: rue Eugène Jumin

=== Station layout ===
===Platforms===

The station has three tracks and two platforms, with the centre track not being used in revenue service. Along with Porte de Bagnolet on line 3, Porte d&#x27;Italie on line 7, and Porte Dorée on line 8, it is one of the four stations on the network built at the former gates of Paris without having originally served as its terminus, although it has a platform configuration with three tracks with the centre track leading to a siding. This enables it to serve as an intermediate terminus for trains on short-working trips to turn back towards Place d&#x27;Italie.

After the opening of the Cité de la Musique in 1995, the platforms were renovated with a theme of music. The elliptical vault was painted white, while the walls were covered with white tiles with five grey horizontal lines of tiles, serving as the music staff. It was decorated with red, blue, green, orange, and yellow tiles forming musical notes, mimicking a music score.

The name of the station is written in faience on the abutments of the station and with the Parisine font on enamelled plates on the island platform.

===Other connections===
The station is also served by tramway 3b since 15 December 2012 along with lines 75 and 151 of the RATP Bus Network, and at night, by lines N13, N41, and N45 of the Noctilien network.

<text>Ourcq () is a station in the 19th arrondissement of Paris, served by line 5 of the Paris Métro. It is named after the nearby rue de l&#x27;Ourcq, which in turn was named after the river Ourcq, a tributary of the Marne (river). It rises in Aisne and flows into Île-de-France. It is connected to the Seine via the Canal de l&#x27;Ourcq.

==History==
The station opened on 21 March 1947, four years after the commissioning of the extension of line 5 from Gare du Nord to Eglise de Pantin. It was then located not far from Belleville-Villette station on the Chemin de fer de Petite Ceinture line which closed in 1934. A bridge the line used to run on still exists on avenue Jean-Jaurès around 200 m away from the station.

On 9 October 2019, some of the nameplates on the station&#x27;s platforms were temporarily replaced by the RATP to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the popular comic series Asterix and Obelix along with eleven other stations. It used the characteristic typography of the comic strips by René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo, its creators. It was humorously renamed &quot;AbraracOurcqcix&quot;, a reference to one of the characters in the comics, &quot;Abraracourcix&quot;, the chief of the village where Asterix and Obelix belongs.

In 2019, the station was used by 3,763,663 passengers, making it the 131st busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 2,064,168 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 118th busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 2,862,337 passengers, making it the 116th busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.

The lighting strips are supported by curved shaped fake consoles. The direct lighting is white while the indirect lighting, projected on the vault, is multi-coloured. The white ceramic tiles are flat and cover the walls, the roof, and the outlets. The advertising frames are red and cylindrical, and the name of the station is written with the Parisine typeface on enamelled plates. The platforms are equipped with red Motte-style seats and grey &quot;sit-lean&quot; benches.

Since the late 1980s, the station features a Thierry Grave sculpture exhibit made of limewood in a niche on the walls of the platform towards &quot;Bobigny-Pablo Picasso&quot;. It represents the joint of a fabled animal.

<text>Laumière () is a station of the Paris Métro on line 5 in the 19th arrondissement. It is named after the nearby avenue de Laumière, which was in turn named after Xavier Jean-Marie Clément Vernhet de Laumière (1812-1863), a general killed during the French intervention in Mexico in the 19th century.

==History==
Laumière opened on October 12, 1942 during the extension of line 5 from Gare du Nord to Eglise de Pantin.

Between 1974 and 1984, like a third of the stations on the network, the station was renovated and modernised in the Andreu-Motte style. As part of the &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; programme by the RATP, the station was renovated and modernised on 31 May 2002.

On 1 April 2017, the nameplates on the station&#x27;s platforms were temporarily replaced by the RATP as part of April Fool&#x27;s Day for the second consecutive year, together with 10 other stations (including 2 RER stations). It was humorously renamed &quot;Qui a éteint la Laumière?&quot; (Who extinguished Laumière?).

In 2019, the station was used by 4,325,317 passengers, making it the 106th busiest of the Métro network out of 302 stations.

In 2020, the station was used by 2,107,812 passengers amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, making it the 115th busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.

In 2021, the station was used by 3,258,568 passengers, making it the 94th busiest of the Métro network out of 305 stations.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has three accesses:

* Access 1: avenue Jean Jaurès &quot;Gymnase&quot;
* Access 2: avenue de Laumière
* Access 3: rue de Meaux (with an ascending escalator)

===Station layout===
===Platform===
Laumière is a standard configuration station with two platforms separated by metro tracks under an elliptical roof. The decoration is &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style green, with two light canopies, flat tile benches and &quot;Motte &quot;seating in the same colour. In contrast, the tunnel exits and outlets of the corridors as well as the walls and the vault, are covered with white bevelled ceramic tiles. The advertising frames are a faience honey colour and topped with the letter &quot;M&quot;. The name of the station is also faience in the style of the original &quot;Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain de Paris&quot; (CMP). These same frames are present in only seven other stations of the Paris metro and the two following stations of Line 5, Jaurès and Stalingrad. With the latter two, they are the only two stations married in the &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style and these advertising of frames.

===Other connections===
The station is also served by line 60 of the RATP Bus Network, and at night, by lines N13, N41, and N45 of the Noctilien network.

<text>Jacques Bonsergent () is a station of the Paris Métro, serving line 5 and located in the 10th arrondissement of Paris.

==History==
The station was opened on 17 December 1906 as the northern terminus of Line 5 from Place d&#x27;Italie, replacing the temporary terminus of Quai de la Rapée, before the line was extended to Gare du Nord on 15 November 1907. The stations original name of Lancry is after proximity to the Rue de Lancry and its former local owner, Sieur Lancry. The station kept that name until 1946.

The current name refers to the Place Jacques Bonsergent, named after Jacques Bonsergent, an engineer who became the first Parisian (and possibly first French) civilian executed by the German occupation in 1940. Bonsergent was born at Malestroit, in 1912 and was condemned to death by a German military tribunal on 5 December 1940 after being accused, and found guilty, of an act of violence against German soldiers during the night of 10 November. The execution was carried out on 23 December 1940 at the Bois de Vincennes; the commanding officer was Général Otto von Stülpnagel. Bonsergent&#x27;s remains lie in the cemetery at Malestroit, Brittany.

<doc id="504161" wikidata="Q181140" url="?curid=504161" title="Rachel Griffiths">
<text>Rachel Anne Griffiths (born in 1968) is an Australian actress. Raised primarily in Melbourne, she began her acting career appearing on the Australian series &quot;Secrets&quot; before being cast in a supporting role in the comedy &quot;Muriel&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (1994), which earned her an AACTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. In 1997, she was the lead in Nadia Tass&#x27;s drama &quot;Amy&quot;. She had a role opposite Julia Roberts in the American romantic comedy &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (1997), followed by her portrayal of Hilary du Pré in &quot;Hilary and Jackie&quot; (1998), for which she received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.

From 2001 to 2005, Griffiths portrayed massage therapist Brenda Chenowith in the HBO series &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;, for which she earned a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in 2002 and two Primetime Emmy Award nominations. She subsequently appeared on television as Sarah Walker Laurent on the ABC drama series &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot; from 2006 to 2011, for which she was nominated for two additional Primetime Emmy Awards.

She has also had roles in the films &quot;Blow&quot; (2001), portraying the mother of George Jung; the historical drama &quot;Ned Kelly&quot; (2003); &quot;Step Up&quot; (2006), and the Julian Assange television biopic &quot;&quot; (2012). In 2016, she appeared in a supporting role in Mel Gibson&#x27;s biographical war drama &quot;Hacksaw Ridge&quot;, and in the docudrama miniseries &quot;When We Rise&quot;, written by Dustin Lance Black.

Onstage, Griffiths appeared in a Melbourne-based production of &quot;Proof&quot; in 2002, which earned her a Helpmann Award, and later made her Broadway debut in a 2011 critically acclaimed production of &quot;Other Desert Cities&quot;. In addition to acting, she made her directorial debut with the short film &quot;Tulip&quot; in 1998, and directed several episodes of the Australian television series &quot;Nowhere Boys&quot; in 2015.

==Early life==
Griffiths was born on 18 December 1968 in Melbourne, Australia, and spent her early childhood on the Gold Coast. She is the daughter of Anna and Edward Martin Griffiths. She has two older brothers, Ben and Samuel. She moved to Melbourne at age five, with her mother and brothers. Griffiths was raised Roman Catholic. She recalled first being inspired to become an actress after watching the U.S. miniseries &quot;Roots&quot; as a child.

Griffiths attended Star of the Sea College, a Catholic girls&#x27; high school in Brighton. She earned a Bachelor of Education degree in drama and dance at Victoria College, Rusden(now part of Deakin University). After being rejected from the National Institute of Dramatic Art, Griffiths joined the Woolly Jumpers, a Geelong-based community theatre group. In 1991, she wrote and performed the one-woman show &quot;Barbie Gets Hip&quot;, which played at the Melbourne Fringe Festival in 1991.

==Career==
===1994–2000: Early work and critical recognition===
Griffiths portrayed Rhonda Epinstall, the best friend of Toni Collette&#x27;s titular character, in the 1994 film &quot;Muriel&#x27;s Wedding&quot;. Her performance won her critical acclaim and both the Australian Film Critics Award and the Australian Film Institute Awards for Best Supporting Actress. She followed in 1996 with the role of an earthy, ill-mannered pig farmer&#x27;s daughter in Michael Winterbottom&#x27;s &quot;Jude&quot;.

In 1997, Griffiths sparked controversy after showing up uninvited at the opening of the Crown Melbourne in Melbourne, Australia. She was topless when she showed up at the new integrated resort. She stated a wish to protest the views taken by the media and state government towards the new casino, inspired by the story of Lady Godiva.

Griffiths joined forces again with &quot;Muriel&#x27;s Wedding&quot; director P. J. Hogan for her American film debut, &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, in 1997. That same year she starred in &quot;My Son the Fanatic&quot;, a British film in which she portrayed a tough Yorkshire prostitute who becomes involved with a considerably older Pakistani taxicab driver, played by Om Puri. Griffiths received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of real-life flautist Hilary du Pré opposite Emily Watson as her sister, famed cellist Jacqueline &quot;Jackie&quot; du Pre, in &quot;Hilary and Jackie&quot; (1998). After the release of &quot;Hilary and Jackie&quot;, Griffiths was cast in the starring role in the Australian comedy &quot;Me Myself I&quot; (1999).

===2001–2011: American television and further acclaim===
In 2001, Griffiths appeared opposite Natasha Richardson in the English comedy &quot;Blow Dry&quot;, playing a lesbian hairdresser who enters a hairstyling competition with her lover, followed by the Ted Demme-directed &quot;Blow&quot; (2001) opposite Johnny Depp and Ray Liotta, in which she played the mother of Boston cocaine magnate George Jung. Nick Nunziata of &quot;IGN&quot; was critical of Griffiths&#x27; performance in the film, writing: &quot;the only performance that doesn&#x27;t ring true is that of Rachel Griffiths as Jung&#x27;s mother...she just doesn&#x27;t connect.&quot;

The same year Griffiths appeared in &quot;Blow&quot;, she was cast as one of the leads in the HBO drama series &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;. Her performance as emotionally scarred massage therapist, Brenda Chenowith, earned her Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Awards, as well as two Emmy Award nominations over the series&#x27; five season-run. In the third season, she missed four episodes due to her first pregnancy; her second pregnancy was written into the show&#x27;s final season and she appeared in almost every episode of the series.

While starring on &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;, Griffiths continued to occasionally appear in the films, playing the supportive housewife of Dennis Quaid in the Walt Disney drama &quot;The Rookie&quot; (2002), and in the Australian biopic &quot;Ned Kelly&quot; (2003), opposite Heath Ledger, Geoffrey Rush, and Orlando Bloom. In the spring of 2002, she appeared in a Melbourne production of &quot;Proof&quot; by the American playwright David Auburn, for which she earned a Helpmann Award for Best Female Actor in a Play.
In 2004, she played a key role in the Hallmark film adaptation of the Kent Haruf novel Plainsong.
In 2006, she became part of the ensemble cast, co-starring alongside Sally Field, Calista Flockhart, Balthazar Getty and Matthew Rhys, of the dramatic series &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;, in which she portrays Sarah Walker, who inherits control of the family business after her father&#x27;s death. Griffiths received a 2007 Emmy nomination and a 2008 Emmy nomination for her work on the series, followed by 2008 and 2009 Golden Globe nominations. Griffiths starred on the series until its conclusion in 2011. Additionally, she appeared as Inez Scull in the 2008 miniseries adaptation of Larry McMurtry&#x27;s &quot;Comanche Moon&quot;.

Griffiths made her Broadway debut in &quot;Other Desert Cities&quot;, directed by Joe Mantello and co-starring Judith Light, Stockard Channing, and Stacy Keach, which began previews on 10 October 2011, opening on 3 November 2011 in Manhattan. David Rooney of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; praised both Griffith&#x27;s performance as well as the overall production, writing: &quot;[The play] has acquired a riveting center in the raw performance of Rachel Griffiths, who makes a knockout New York stage debut. With discreet adjustments to the text and more penetrating characterizations all around from the sterling cast, the balance between comedy and intense family drama has been fine-tuned in richly satisfying ways&quot;. Ben Brantley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; deemed her performance &quot;a beautifully modulated Broadway debut&quot;.

===2012–2018: Return to Australia; directing===
In 2012, Griffiths returned to live in her native Australia, after having lived and worked in the United States for a decade. She expressed a desire to work less and spend more time with her children after having worked what she described as &quot;80-hour-weeks&quot; while appearing on &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; and &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;.

In November 2013, &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; reported that Griffiths was to play Julia Gillard in a television drama based on the book, &quot;The Stalking of Julia Gillard&quot; by Kerry-Anne Walsh. But the project stalled as the proposal for the film was rejected by the Australian television networks.

In 2015, she made her debut as a television director when she directed three episodes of the second series of the Australian teen drama &quot;Nowhere Boys&quot;.

In 2016, Griffiths was cast opposite Guy Pearce and Mary-Louise Parker in the American miniseries &quot;When We Rise&quot;, a docudrama focusing on LGBT rights, in which she portrays a nurse during the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the United States. The same year, she appeared in a supporting part opposite Hugo Weaving in the Mel Gibson-directed war drama &quot;Hacksaw Ridge&quot;, which earned her an AACTA nomination for Best Supporting Actress. In 2018, she appears in the SBS thriller miniseries &quot;Dead Lucky&quot;, which was sold for American distribution to the streaming service SundanceNow in April 2018.

In 2020, Griffiths starred in the Amazon Prime television show, &quot;The Wilds,&quot; as Gretchen Klein.

In 2023, Griffiths was announced as the lead role for New Zealand comedy-drama series &quot;Madam.&quot; 

In 2024, Griffiths appeared in the final season of ABC political drama &quot;Total Control,&quot; after appearing in the two previous seasons, she also served as executive producer on the 3 series show.&quot;.&quot;

==Other ventures==
In 2017, Griffiths worked promoting the &quot;No Robe&quot; campaign for the Art Series Hotels, which invited hotel guests to pose for nude portraits in their rooms and have them brought to life by artists. She also serves on the board of the Sydney Contemporary art fair.

==Personal life==
Griffiths married Australian artist Andrew Taylor on 31 December 2002 in the chapel of her high school, Star of the Sea College, in Melbourne. In 2003, she and Taylor had a son, followed by a daughter in 2005. In 2009, she gave birth to her third child in Los Angeles; Griffiths suffered a ruptured uterus giving birth. She spent a total of three days undergoing surgery and recovered from the condition.

In 2002, Griffiths stated she was an atheist. However, in a 2015 interview, she revealed she was again a practising Catholic, the faith in which she was raised. In 2017, she spoke out in favour of same-sex marriage in Australia. She has also supported the Global Charter of Basic Rights campaign for Oxfam Australia. She considers herself a feminist.

After having lived and worked in the United States for nearly a decade while appearing on the series &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; and &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;, Griffiths returned to live in her native Australia in 2012.
Griffiths became a Member of the Order of Australia in the Australia Day Honours in 2020.

<text>Place d&#x27;Italie (, literally &quot;Italy Square&quot;) is a rapid transit station of the Paris Métro located in the heart of the 13th arrondissement of Paris, at the Place d&#x27;Italie. It is the southern terminus of Line 5 and is also served by Line 6 and Line 7.

==Location==

The Place d&#x27;Italie was the site of the &quot;Barrière d&#x27;Italie&quot;, a gate of in the Wall of the Farmers-General, built to enforce tax collections on goods entering Paris between 1784 and 1791, where the old Roman road towards Lyon and Rome began. The station is situated at the crossing of five large Parisian streets: the &quot;Avenue d&#x27;Italie&quot;, the &quot;Boulevard Auguste Blanqui&quot;, the &quot;Avenue des Gobelins&quot;, the &quot;Boulevard de l&#x27;Hôpital&quot;, and the &quot;Boulevard Vincent Auriol&quot;. It was the starting point of the road connecting Paris to Italy, the current N7.

==History==
The first platforms opened as part of the former Line 2 South on 24 April 1906, when it was extended from Passy. On 17 December 1906, Line 5 was extended to Lancry. On 14 October 1907 &quot;Line 2 South&quot; was incorporated into Line 5. On 1 March 1909, Line 6 was opened from Place d&#x27;Italie to Nation.

The Line 7 platforms opened on 15 February 1930 as part of a planned section of line Line 7, which was temporarily operated as part of Line 10 until the completion of the under-Seine crossing of line 7 from Pont de Sully to Place Monge. The station was integrated into line 7 on 26 April 1931. On 12 October 1942, the &quot;Place d&#x27;Italie&quot; Étoile section was transferred from line 5 to line 6 in order to separate the underground and elevated sections of the metro (because the latter were more vulnerable to air attack). As a result, Line 5, rather than Line 6, terminated at &quot;Place d&#x27;Italie&quot;.

Like one-third of the stations in the network between 1974 and 1984, the three stopping points were modernized by adopting the decorative style &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot;, in yellow for line 5, blue for line 6 and green for line 7. However, the wharf of line 5 will be later removed its yellow tiled bench seat, which was surmounted by seats &quot;Motte&quot; features resembling its hue.

From 25 June to 2 September 2007, the platforms of Line 5 were closed to allow a modification of the track plan with the aim of reusing the loop of Italy, to increase the frequency of the line. the terminus was then temporarily shifted to the neighboring Campo-Formio metro station.

As part of the RATP&#x27;s &quot;Renouveau du métro&quot; program, the corridors of the station were renovated from 31 March 2008. In the mid-2010s, the Line 7 station, in turn, underwent a minor modernization with green tiled benches replaced with contemporary seats of the same color.

From 25 November to 11 December 2015, the platforms for Line 6 (as well as the exterior of an MP 73 train) were decorated in a &quot;Star Wars&quot; theme to promote the theatrical release of &quot;Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens&quot;. At the end of 2016, its blue checked banquettes were replaced by contemporary seats of the same color.

In 2018, 11,508,361 travelers entered this station which places it at the 13th position of the metro stations for its attendance.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
There are four access points to Place d&#x27;Italie station:
# Auguste Blanqui: one stairway at 2 Rue Bobillot, decorated with an Guimard edicule, inscribed as a historic monument on 12 February 2016;
# Grand Écran: one stairway at Place d&#x27;Italie consisting of a fixed staircase also embellished with an entrance designed by Hector Guimard and classified as a historical monument;

===Station layout===

===Platforms===
Each stopping point has an elliptical vault and an &quot;Andreu-Motte&quot; style decoration, but the characteristic benches and seats have been gradually removed over the years.

The terminus of Line 5 is in the form of a curved station with two lanes framing a central platform. The &quot;Motte&quot; style is only represented by two yellow luminous strips, while the platform has a few white &quot;sit-stand&quot; bars. Bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the walls, vault, and tunnel exits. The advertising frames are metallic, and the name of the station is written in capital letters on enamelled plates.

The platforms of Line 6 are of standard configuration. Two in number, they are separated by the metro tracks in the centre. The decoration is materialized by two blue luminous strips and tunnel exits treated in blue flat tiling, except to the right of the access outlets. The latter are covered with white bevelled tiles, as are the walls and the vault. The advertising frames are metallic, and the name of the station is written on enamelled plates, with an unusual font for the Paris metro. The seats are &quot;Akiko&quot; style blue.

The Line 7 station is also available. It has two green light luminous and &quot;Akiko&quot; seats of the same colour. Bevelled white ceramic tiles cover the piers, the vault, the tunnel exits and the outlets of the corridors. The advertising frames are a faience honey colour and the name of the station is also faience in the style of the original CMP.

===Bus connections===
The station is served by Lines 27, 47, 57, 59, 61, 64, 67 and 83 of the RATP Bus Network. At night, it is served by lines N15, N22, N31 and N144 of the Noctilien network.

<text>Kléber () is a station of the Paris Métro serving Line 6 at the intersection of Avenue Kléber and the Avenue des Portugais in the 16th arrondissement.

==History==
The station opened on 2 October 1900 as a branch of Line 1 from Étoile to Trocadéro. On 5 November 1903 this line was extended to Passy and the line from &quot;Étoile&quot; to &quot;Trocadéro&quot; and &quot;Passy&quot; became known as Line 2 South as part of a planned ring line around central Paris to be built under or over the boulevards built in place of the demolished Wall of the Farmers-General; this circle is now operated as two lines: 2 and 6. On 14 October 1907 the line from &quot;Étoile&quot; to &quot;Trocadéro&quot;, Place d&#x27;Italie and Gare du Nord became part of Line 5. On 6 October 1942 the section of Line 5 from &quot;Étoile&quot; to &quot;Place d&#x27;Italie&quot;, including &quot;Boissière&quot;, was transferred to Line 6. Avenue Kléber commemorates Jean Baptiste Kléber (1753–1800), a General in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, particularly noted for his leadership in the Egyptian campaign, where he was assassinated.

Although Charles de Gaulle - Étoile is designated as the terminus of Line 6, the single track loop at Charles de Gaulle - Étoile limits the capacity of Line 6 at that station. Instead of having an extended terminal stop at Charles de Gaulle - Étoile, Line 6 trains depart quickly back round the loop and then stop for an extended period of time at Kléber, which has extra platforms and tracks to accommodate the arrangement.

==Passenger services==
===Access===
The station has two entrances leading to either side of Avenue Kléber, each decorated with a Guimard edicule that were listed as a historical monument by decree on 12 February 2016:
* entrance 1 - &quot;avenue Kléber&quot; - odd number side of the avenue, located to the right of no. 15;
* entrance 2 - &quot;avenue Kléber&quot; - even number side of the avenue, located opposite nos. 12 and 14.
===Station layout===

===Platform===
Kléber is a station of particular configuration. It has four tracks due to its role as &quot;technical&quot; terminus. It is used as a prolonged stop of trains before or after their passage at the terminus of Charles de Gaulle - Étoile depending on the necessary regulations and break times for the drivers. The &quot;commercial&quot; terminus of Charles de Gaulle - Étoile is too constrained to be able to play this role effectively.

The side tracks are partially separated from the original central tracks by walls, the station being initially of standard configuration with two platforms separated by the metro tracks located in the centre. It is therefore divided into three parts, each with an elliptical vault. The north end, however, is contiguous, and has two vertical walls and a horizontal ceiling.

The decoration is typical of the 1970s. The light canopies are suspended and designed with crisscrossed metal slats, while beige ceramic tiles, aligned vertically (found only at Porte de Bagnolet and Gallieni stations on line 3), cover the walls of the platforms, the tunnel exits as well as the end of the vaults. The vaults are painted white as are most of the side walls. The advertising frames are metallic, and the name of the station is inscribed in capital letters on large, enamelled plaques. The seats are a blue &quot;Motte&quot; style.

==Bus connections==
The station is served by lines 22 and 30 of the RATP Bus Network and, at night, by line N53 of the Noctilien bus network.

<text>Arncliffe is a suburb in southern Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Arncliffe is located 11 kilometres south of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the Bayside Council.

Arncliffe is south of the Cooks River and Wolli Creek, close to Sydney Airport. Arncliffe is a mostly residential area featuring low-density detached and semi-detached houses and some medium density town houses and blocks of flats. There are also some areas of commercial and light industrial developments.

==History==

Arncliffe&#x27;s name comes from a small village called Arncliffe in North Yorkshire, England. The name appears in the Domesday Book of 1086, as &#x27;Arneclif&#x27;, meaning Eagle Cliff. In his book &quot;A Village Called Arncliffe&quot; (1997) Ron Rathbone relates that an early land speculator, William Hirst, created a subdivision in 1840 named The Village of Arncliffe Estate. William Hirst was born in Settle, Yorkshire. Settle is a market town serving a cluster of villages, of which Arncliffe is reputed to be the prettiest. Rathbone says it is likely that Hirst gave Arncliffe its name, although it was more than two decades before it received official recognition.

Alderman E.G. Barton worked to develop the district, including the reclamation of swampland where Barton Park and Kogarah Golf Links now stand. James Beehag also owned land in the area and later became one of Rockdale&#x27;s early mayors. In November 1910, a series of lots were auctioned by Ernest V. Broughton. The area, bordered by Wentworth, Cook and Dowling streets was called the &#x27;Radium Estate&#x27; and had been surveyed by E. R. Hardy.

===Aboriginal culture===
The original inhabitants of the area were tribes of Indigenous Australians. There is evidence to suggest that these people belonged to the Gweagal, Bidjigal and Cadigal clans. Valleys of local creeks, Wolli Creek and Bardwell Creek contain evidence of Aboriginal presence in smoke-blackened caves.

Originally, Arncliffe Hill was known as Cobbler&#x27;s Hill and the area became the vegetable garden for Sydney. When Hannam&#x27;s land was subdivided, many new small holdings became farms, spreading towards Black Creek or Muddy Creek. Allotments in the village of Arncliffe were between 10 and . In 1843, newspaper advertisements declared that there was &#x27;money to be made by woodcutters and farming men and persons about Cook&#x27;s River&#x27;. In 1856 another subdivision, Tempe, was described as being close to the village of Arncliffe, described as having &quot;all the characteristics of an English village, being beautifully situated amidst quiet rural scenery, spotted here and there with neat cottages which charm the eye with their pretty, well trimmed gardens, perfect pictures of competence and content&quot;.

Athelstane, owned by W.G. Judd, was a notable home in the district. The large house gave its name to the avenue it was built on and later became the site of Athelstane Public School. Another main street, Barden Street, was named after Frederick Barden whose house, Highbery Heights, stood nearby. Arncliffe had many grand and gracious Victorian era houses. Too many have been demolished, or fallen into disrepair, been subdivided and so on, but in the most recent years there have been some attempts to preserve these as part of local heritage. Two-storey semi-detached dwellings, &quot;Gladstone&quot; and &quot;Wentworth&quot; on Forest Road, were built by Hurstville builder Robert Newell for rental to &#x27;well to do&#x27; tenants. &quot;Dappeto&quot; on Wollongong Road built in 1885 by oyster merchant Frederick Gibbins, later became a home for children and now houses a Salvation Army chapel, as part of a nursing home and retirement village. &#x27;Belmont&#x27; and &#x27;Fairview&#x27; are identical Victorian homes built in 1884 by two Irish brothers Thomas and Alexander Milsop, who made their fortunes in the goldfields. &#x27;Meryton&#x27; was erected by building contractor Alexander Fell in 1885. &#x27;Coburra&#x27; was built in 1905 but was more typical of the earlier Victorian era. Arncliffe Post office is a Federation style building opened in 1906 and originally contained the post master&#x27;s residence upstairs.

The avenue of trees was planted around 1904. Over the years, Arncliffe has hosted a stinking boiling down works (1870s), a sewerage farm (1886–1916) and various factories and workshops throughout the 20th century, particularly after WW2. These included the Streets Ice Cream factory and Fontana Films, where the film &quot;Jedda&quot; was produced with many of the scenes shot in Arncliffe. Both Streets and Fontana have now closed.

==Geography==

===Wolli Creek and Bardwell Valley===
An important community issue is potential overdevelopment, with high-density housing development occurring around the new Wolli Creek railway station. This area in the northern part of Arncliffe officially became the separate suburb of Wolli Creek in 2002.
Bardwell Valley was originally a locality beside Bardwell Creek, adjoining the suburb of Bardwell Park. The valley was famous for its golf course and golf club. Bardwell Valley became a new suburb in 1996, formed from parts of Arncliffe that border the valley. Bardwell Park was named after free settler Thomas Hill Bardwell who owned land in the area.

<text>Wesley Louden Borland (born February 7, 1975) is an American rock musician. He is the guitarist and backing vocalist of the nu metal band Limp Bizkit, the lead vocalist and guitarist of the alternative and industrial rock band Black Light Burns, and the co-founder of the experimental metal band Big Dumb Face.

Borland gained popularity when Limp Bizkit achieved mainstream success in the late 1990s and early 2000s. He formed Big Dumb Face with his brother Scott in 1998 and left Limp Bizkit in 2001 to start side projects including Eat the Day and The Damning Well. After rejoining Limp Bizkit in 2004, Borland founded Black Light Burns, with whom he has released three studio albums and a covers album. Limp Bizkit went on hiatus following the release of their album &quot;The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)&quot; (2005). However, the band&#x27;s original lineup reunited in 2009 and recorded their fifth studio album, &quot;Gold Cobra&quot; (2011). In 2016, Borland released his solo album &quot;Crystal Machete&quot;.

Borland is known for his sonic experimentation and elaborate visual appearance, which has included face and body paint, masks and uniforms. He has drawn album covers and created artwork for many of his music projects as well as oil paintings. Borland was voted number 37 in &quot;Total Guitar&quot;″s &quot;Top 100 Guitarists of All Time&quot;. Borland formed the label Edison Sound, which releases his own music projects.

== Early life ==

Borland&#x27;s initial interest in music took the form of drumming, but this ended quickly due to his parents&#x27; disapproval of percussive instruments in the home. Borland then switched to taking guitar lessons from a member of his parents&#x27; Presbyterian church. However, Borland quickly found his own musical tastes and interests at odds with local music trends which, due to his proximity to Nashville, skewed heavily towards country music. He later recalled, &quot;I would bring in something, and my teacher would go, &#x27;I&#x27;ve never heard of The Damned. Don&#x27;t you want to play some Merle Haggard?&#x27;&quot;

When Borland&#x27;s brother Scott took an interest in bass guitar, the two brothers began to play together. Borland found his interest in hip hop music piqued with the release of &quot;Bring the Noise&quot;, a collaboration between heavy metal band Anthrax and hip hop group Public Enemy.

Borland then relocated to Jacksonville, Florida with his parents where, disillusioned with the local music scene, he began attending the Douglas Anderson School of the Arts. While there, he explored other artistic endeavors, such as sculpture and special effects. However, Borland continued his pursuit of music through guitar lessons, working with a guitar teacher that specialized in jazz music. According to Borland, &quot;My first teacher had ingrained playing by ear so much that, when my jazz teacher gave me a sheet of music and an audio tape to go with it, I would learn via the tape instantly, but I couldn&#x27;t make myself learn the sheet music.&quot; As his guitar skills continued to improve, Borland began to craft his own guitar parts and style. Eventually, finding himself forced into church attendance and feeling a lack of interest in religion, Borland&#x27;s frustration and confinement pushed him to move out of his parents&#x27; house at the age of 18.

== Career ==

=== Limp Bizkit and mainstream success (1994–2002) ===

Borland joined Limp Bizkit, a band formed by Fred Durst, Sam Rivers and John Otto. Limp Bizkit developed a cult following in the underground music scene, particularly at the Milk Bar, an underground punk club in downtown Jacksonville, Florida. The band attracted crowds by word of mouth and covering George Michael&#x27;s &quot;Faith&quot; and Paula Abdul&#x27;s &quot;Straight Up&quot;; the band also gave energetic live performances in which Borland appeared in bizarre costumes. Borland&#x27;s theatrical rock style was the primary attraction for many concert attendees. After DJ Lethal joined the band as a turntablist, Borland left Limp Bizkit after a disagreement with Durst. However, Borland rejoined after the band signed with Mojo, a subsidiary of MCA Records. After a dispute with Mojo, Limp Bizkit signed with Flip, a subsidiary of Interscope Records, and recorded their debut, &quot;Three Dollar Bill, Yall&quot;, which featured an abrasive, angry sound.

Although the album was met with minimal response, touring consistently increased Limp Bizkit&#x27;s success, and the third single from &quot;Three Dollar Bill, Yall&quot;, &quot;Faith&quot;, became a radio hit, leading to a slot on Ozzfest, a tour organized by Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne. In 1998, Borland formed a side project, Big Dumb Face with his brother, influenced by Ween and Mr. Bungle.

&quot;Significant Other&quot; saw Limp Bizkit reaching a new level of commercial success. The album climbed to No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 643,874 copies in its first week of release. In 2000, Durst announced that the band&#x27;s third studio album would be titled &quot;Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water&quot;. The press thought that Durst was joking about this title. The album title is intended to sound like a fictional band; the phrase &quot;Chocolate Starfish&quot; referred to Durst himself, as he had frequently been called an asshole. Borland contributed the other half of the album&#x27;s title when the band was standing around at a truck stop, looking at bottles of flavored water, and Borland joked that the truck stop didn&#x27;t have hot dog or meat-flavored water. It debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 1.05 million copies in its first week, and was the 18th best-selling album of the 2000s in the US.

In a 1999 &quot;Spin&quot; profile on Limp Bizkit, when asked &quot;Where will you be ten years from now?&quot;, Borland responded, &quot;Probably not in the band.&quot;

=== Departure from Limp Bizkit, side-projects, brief return to Limp Bizkit, and Black Light Burns formation (2002–2009) ===
In March 2001, Big Dumb Face released its debut album, &quot;Duke Lion Fights the Terror!!&quot;. Borland stated that the band&#x27;s music is &quot;really silly and idiotic and bizarre. [...] It&#x27;s nothing but stupid [...] just all these retarded songs.&quot; In the fall of 2001, Borland left Limp Bizkit, citing creative differences with the band. When asked why Borland quit the band, Ross Robinson stated that he quit because &quot;He doesn&#x27;t sell out for money anymore&quot;.

Borland then formed the band Eat the Day, in which he and his brother Scott would both act as co-lead vocalists. After realizing this setup restricted their guitar-playing abilities, Eat The Day launched an open search for a new vocalist. Initially, the band released three full-length instrumental tracks for hopeful singers to download and record over. The tracks were dAdA, Beeblicowcarapis and Taste My Gun, but later they were only available as small samples. In a 2021 interview, Borland claimed that he went through at least 150 audition recordings.

In January 2003, Borland announced former Stalking Tom singer Adam Yas as the new vocalist for Eat The Day, but two months later he reported that the band &quot;...decided to go public with our search one more time&quot; while still staying in contact with the previously announced Yas. Around the same time, Bob Ezrin was brought in to produce their debut album. Shortly afterward, Borland had found three potential singers for the project, with one presumably being the previously announced Adam Yas.

Despite his claims that the three discovered vocalists were the best options available, producer Ezrin didn&#x27;t believe in their abilities enough to allow Eat The Day to move forward with the production of their album, going as far as calling the singers &quot;terrible&quot;. In order to improve the situation, Borland attempted to bring in Danny Lohner, which resulted in further clashes with Ezrin and ground the project to a halt. Eat The Day was eventually abandoned due to being unable to find a vocalist. The unfinished demos from Eat the Day were subsequently released in April 2020 by Borland.

After the failure of another project, The Damning Well, in 2003, Borland began writing a solo record with its members Danny Lohner and Josh Freese, with Josh Eustis and Jonathan Bates contributing. This record served as the precursor to Black Light Burns. In August 2004, Borland rejoined Limp Bizkit and recorded another album, &quot;The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)&quot; in 2005. Following the release of the band&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hitz&quot; album, the band went on hiatus after arguments broke out on MySpace between Borland and frontman Fred Durst, with Borland stating, &quot;As of right now, none of my future plans include Limp Bizkit.&quot; 

In 2005, Borland formed Black Light Burns. Borland stated that this was now his main project, and anything else he did, including Limp Bizkit, was a side project. Borland toured with From First To Last roughly since early 2006. He announced planned for a fall 2006 tour that never went through due to Black Light Burns needing to find a new record label after Borland left Geffen Records. Borland had discussed plans to write and perform on the next From First To Last album, but he left the band when Black Light Burns&#x27; busy schedule started to pick up, leaving no room to work with From First to Last.

Black Light Burns released its début album, &quot;Cruel Melody&quot; in the spring of 2007 to critical acclaim. It featured Borland on the vocals and guitars. Allmusic writer Greg Prato wrote, &quot;For many, Borland was the only Limp Bizkit member who was taken seriously. As evidenced by &quot;Cruel Melody&quot;, he is now officially allowed to follow whichever musical path he so desires.&quot;. In 2008, Borland, along with Richard Fortus and Sugizo, supported Japanese metal band X Japan at their sold out reunion concerts at the Tokyo Dome.

In August 2008, at the ETP Conference, it was announced that Borland joined Marilyn Manson as a guitarist. In the winter of 2008, Borland helped in the recording of The Color of Violence&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;Youthanize&quot; as a bassist.

=== Limp Bizkit reunion (2009) ===
In 2009, the original lineup of Limp Bizkit reunited and began touring, which resulted in a second Black Light Burns record being put on the backburner. Borland left Manson&#x27;s employ in May of the same year, claiming his reasons for leaving included rejoining his old band and having creative differences with Manson, citing &quot;It&#x27;s the Marilyn Manson show over there.&quot;
Limp Bizkit recorded a new album, which Borland named &quot;Gold Cobra&quot;. Released on June 28, 2011. It received mixed reviews, with multiple reviewers praising Borland&#x27;s guitar playing. It peaked at No. 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

Borland also designed the album artwork for Fear and the Nervous System&#x27;s 2011 eponymous debut album.
Borland has also gone onto a remixing career with his distribution of alternative versions of songs by metal bands. Most recently, The Word Alive has had their song &quot;The Hounds of Anubis&quot; remixed by Borland. He also played guitar in the soundtrack of &quot;Resident Evil: Afterlife&quot; by Tomandandy.

In 2012, Black Light Burns began performing after their brief hiatus and released their second studio album &quot;The Moment You Realize You&#x27;re Going to Fall&quot; and a concept &quot;album&quot;, &quot;Lotus Island&quot;, in January 2013. In the same year, during the Black Light Burns tour, Borland stated that he would never do a solo project. &quot;If I would do a solo project I would put my name on the record. But that will never happen.&quot;

Borland collaborated with Riot Games to develop &quot;Hybrid Worlds&quot;, the theme song for the League of Legends Season 3 World Championships. Borland performed live for the event on October 4, 2013, along with The Crystal Method, Tina Guo, and Black Light Burns alumni Danny Lohner and Joe Letz.

=== Solo album, Big Dumb Face reunion, demos, and &quot;Still Sucks&quot; (2016–present) ===
On May 3, 2016, Borland released an instrumental solo album named &quot;Crystal Machete&quot; on his personal record label (Edison Sound), which saw him stepping outside his comfort zone by featuring no distorted guitars or vocals. The album was released to positive reviews, with Drowned in Sound calling the album a &quot;a beautiful, sprawling post-rock mini epic&quot;. In 2016 he disbanded Black Light Burns.

In winter 2016 Limp Bizkit embarked on a co-headlining UK tour with Korn, including dates at Wembley Arena with support from Madball. As of October 2017, the status of the new Limp Bizkit album &quot;Stampede of the Disco Elephants&quot; is unknown, with Borland telling NME that he has completed all of his parts for &quot;28 or 29 songs&quot; and is waiting for Fred to choose what songs he wants to complete before he can mix and master it. He also blamed his time in Limp Bizkit for difficulty in getting jobs with other acts such as Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson in the past, stating that the other bands didn&#x27;t want to be associated with his previous band.

In June 2017 he posted on social media that Big Dumb Face will be returning that year, eventually confirming that the new album, &quot;Where Is Duke Lion? He&#x27;s Dead...&quot; would be released on October 31 via Edison Sound, with a full scale physical release to follow on November 17. Explaining why he revived Big Dumb Face after 16 years, he said that he wanted to make something &quot;really heavy&quot; in contrast to the post-rock of &quot;Crystal Machete&quot;, and that he was currently &quot;into making things that [he] said [he&#x27;d] never do again&quot;, such as the solo record, or reviving Black Light Burns to release a new album in June 2018. He did, however, say that he would not tour with Big Dumb Face as he has prior touring commitments with Limp Bizkit and his ex-wife&#x27;s band, Queen Kwong. In February 2018 Borland teased images of him working in the studio with Travis Barker on an &quot;as yet untitled project&quot;. He also played guitar on five tracks from Jonathan Davis&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;Black Labyrinth&quot;, which was recorded between 2007 and 2018.

In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Borland began publicly releasing previously unheard material from Eat the Day and Goatslayer, an experimental project he had with brother Scott since the two were teenagers. Borland claimed that the latter project had 23 albums worth of material, the first of which, &quot;The Feather Serpent&quot;, was released on April 25. On December 5 Borland announced that he finished recording and mixing his second solo album &quot;The Astral Hand&quot;, which was released three days later.

On December 11, 2021, the third album by Big Dumb Face, &quot;Christmas in the Cave of Dagoth&quot;, was released.

In April 2022, Borland was recruited by Danny Elfman to perform with his band at Coachella Festival.

=== Career timeline ===
== Personal life ==
In April 1998, Wes married his long-time girlfriend Heather McMillan. The couple divorced in 2001. His second marriage was to Anna Carlise in March 2009. They divorced in 2013. In October 2016, he married Carré Callaway, lead singer of Queen Kwong. The couple resided together in Detroit. Callaway filed for divorce in 2019. In January 2023, Borland filed a defamation lawsuit against Callaway for statements Callaway made during an interview. In March 2023, it was announced that Borland’s lawsuit had been dismissed by a Detroit judge.

Callaway and Borland were passionate about rescuing abandoned cats around the Detroit area, and together starred in a DIY Network renovation show, which followed their relocation to Detroit and subsequent renovation of a large house.

Borland says &quot;growing up as a minister&#x27;s son in a Christian family who were conservative with that kind of stuff had an effect on me&quot;. Borland says he is an atheist, but although he does not believe in heaven, he hopes he is wrong.

During a 2000 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Borland reveals that he was diagnosed with ADHD as a child, and he regularly took Dexadrine in treatment for behavioral issues, though he is an advocate for treatment without medication.

Borland revealed on Dean Delray’s Let There Be Talk podcast, that he had invested most of his early earnings in risky stock market investments. He stated that the market decline as a result of the September 11 attacks, wiped out most of his wealth.

== Equipment ==

Borland used Ibanez seven-string guitars exclusively from 1997 until 1999. However, he stated that he played a 6-string guitar on the entire &quot;Three Dollar Bill, Y&#x27;all&quot; record. Shortly after embarking on a tour with Korn, Ibanez contacted Borland and gave him a number of seven-string Universe guitars, essentially for free, which he continued to use extensively. During the touring in support of &quot;Significant Other&quot;, Borland used two custom Ibanez RG seven-strings with the electronic setup of an Ibanez AX7521 (two volume knobs and two tone knobs rather than one volume and one tone). Nothing is certain about the type of pickups that he used, however, he did use EMG pickups at one point, stating in an interview with GuitarCenter that he was moving from &quot;passive to active pickups&quot;. Borland also endorsed the rare Ibanez RG7 CST guitar, which is made from superior/high-quality materials and is also equipped with an L.R. Baggs designed piezo system on a locking tremolo. He is currently one of two American owners of one.

Borland is one of the few guitarists to utilize tenor guitars, which has 4-strings as opposed to the standard 6-strings. In the early days, he used a vintage Ibanez Musician MC150PW, which was modified to be fitted with 4-strings, which he used on songs such as &quot;Nookie&quot;, &quot;Full Nelson&quot;, and &quot;The One&quot;. This guitar can be seen in the music video for &quot;Nookie.&quot; Ibanez then made him a custom baritone 4-string AX that would be used to replace the Musician. This was eventually replaced by a custom-made Master Guitars &quot;Cremona&quot; 4-string made by luthier George Gorodnitski, a friend of DJ Lethal&#x27;s father. Borland has been on record saying that &quot;George&#x27;s guitars are the best I&#x27;ve ever played.” In April 2022, Borland commissioned PRS Guitars to make a custom tenor guitar.

During the recording for &quot;Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water&quot;, Borland switched to 6-string guitars. The entire album was recorded using a Master Guitars Cremona semi-hollow body guitar, which is visible in the video for &quot;My Generation&quot;. However, Borland did not tour with this guitar and instead used Paul Reed Smith guitars, one of which is a Standard 24 in a Platinum Metallic finish, a Custom 24 in a Black Slate finish, and a 4-string baritone. After the tour, they were not seen again. A Facebook photo posted by Fred Durst in 2012 shows Borland playing the Cremona again for studio purposes.

In 2005, Yamaha approached Borland about a new signature guitar, which was almost 100% designed by Borland. The model CV820WB was released that same year. A semi-hollow body guitar with a large body and new Yamaha high-output split field humbuckers, made exclusively for that guitar, it also came with the Yamaha Quick Change finger-clamp locking tremolo system, which rids the user of having to cut the ball ends off of the strings, which is very unusual for a locking tremolo. This was Borland&#x27;s main guitar for the recording of Black Light Burns&#x27; &quot;Cruel Melody&quot; and the touring behind it, as well as most of the touring Limp Bizkit did before the recording of &quot;Gold Cobra&quot;. Despite its innovative characteristics, it was not a popular guitar, and was discontinued in mid-2011, when Borland switched to Jackson Guitars.

Borland was endorsed by Jackson shortly before the release of &quot;Gold Cobra&quot;, and owns several Rhoads guitars, which he uses on Limp Bizkit shows. In addition he plays various Warriors and King Vs, one of which is a left-handed black King V with white bevels that was converted by Borland into a right-handed guitar. All of these instruments are equipped with a Floyd Rose and a single Seymour Duncan Invader pickup in the bridge position. He does not currently have a signature model with Jackson. Additionally, Borland also uses a Fender Bass VI, tuned to one octave below E standard tuning. He uses this on &quot;The Story&quot; on &quot;The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)&quot;, and again on &quot;90.2.10&quot;, &quot;Walking Away&quot;, and &quot;Back Porch&quot; on the &quot;Gold Cobra&quot; record.

Other guitars Borland has been seen with before are a 1976 Fender Starcaster a stock ESP LTD V-401DX (used on the Limp Bizkit reunion tour for playing songs on Results May Vary) and Mayones Regius Pro 6, Legend and Setius GTM 6 Baritone guitars.

Borland tunes his guitars to C# standard tuning (C# F# B E G# C#) and to Drop B tuning (B F# B E G# C#). He also tunes his 4-string baritone guitars to a variant of this tuning with a low F# string, which is a bass string (F# F# B E). During the late 1990s when Borland played 7-string guitars, he played them like one would play a 6-string guitar by tuning the highest string to C# as well, while maintaining standard C# tuning all the way to the seventh string. This technique was later used by Stephen Carpenter of Deftones so he could play the songs he originally recorded on a six-string without losing the feel of a seven-string, as Limp Bizkit and the Deftones had toured together in the mid 1990s.

Borland uses Ernie Ball &quot;Burly Slinky&quot; .011-.052 gauge nickel-wound strings, where the G string is wound. For Limp Bizkit&#x27;s first three albums, Borland used Mesa/Boogie Dual and Triple Rectifier amps. In 2000, Borland would use the Mesa/Boogie heads in conjunction with a Diezel VH4. In the mid 2000s, on the recording of &quot;Cruel Melody&quot; and &quot;The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)&quot;, Borland&#x27;s main amp was the Diezel VH4. Starting with the 2008 recording of &quot;The Moment You Realize You&#x27;re Going to Fall&quot; Borland played mainly Orange Amps (specifically the Thunderverb 100 models) since touring in support of Cruel Melody began and has continued to use them since then, also on Gold Cobra. Currently, Borland plays EVH Amps and cabinets for his heavier tones. The mainstay of Borland&#x27;s amp setup has been a Roland JC-120 combo amplifier to generate his particularly exceptional clean tones.

== Style ==
Borland&#x27;s guitar playing is experimental and nontraditional, and he is noted for his creative use of six and seven-string guitars. &quot;Three Dollar Bill, Yall&quot; features him playing without a guitar pick, performing with two hands, one playing melodic notes, and the other playing chord progressions. The song &quot;Stuck&quot; uses a sustain pedal in the first bar, and muted riffs in the second bar. His guitar playing has made use of octave shapes, and choppy, eighth-note rhythms, sometimes accompanied by muting his strings with his left hand, creating a percussive sound. Borland has also made use of unevenly accented syncopated sixteenth notes to create a disorienting effect, and hypnotic, droning licks. Borland uses a locking vibrato system quite extensively to &quot;dive bomb&quot; notes in the middle of guitar parts, as heard in songs like Limp Bizkit&#x27;s &quot;Hot Dog&quot; and &quot;Get a Life&quot;. He said that he got the idea to dive notes down an octave then have them come back up from trombone players.

Borland&#x27;s playing is still identifiable in Black Light Burns, but by his own admission, he strives to go for a cleaner type of sound in Black Light Burns, where the heaviness comes from his bass playing, instead of in Limp Bizkit where he seeks a more metal-oriented sound. He plays keyboards and textures more overtly as tools to layer Black Light Burns&#x27; sound where in Limp Bizkit the layers are considered by the full band more.

Borland writes songs by forming them in rough outlines and filling in the details later. According to Borland, &quot;I&#x27;m good at creating ideas while using a guitar in a new way, but it takes me a long time. I can&#x27;t just come up with stuff fast and rip it up. I think about constructing songs, and even riffs, in the same way as a painting, putting on a little bit at a time. They&#x27;re sketchy at first, and then I know what I want, and I fit notes into places.&quot;

Borland is also known for performing in costumes and body paint during concerts, appearing in bunny and kung fu suits, and painted as a skeleton and what he describes as a &quot;burnt match&quot;. Describing the character, he stated, &quot;I go onstage wearing almost nothing. I have underwear and my boots on, and I paint my whole head black—from the neck up—and I have the black contacts. All you can see is these glowing teeth.&quot; Borland&#x27;s black contacts were customized for him by a company noted for making contacts for the science fiction TV series &quot;Babylon 5&quot;.

<text>Operation Agreement was a ground and amphibious operation carried out by British, Rhodesian and New Zealand forces on Axis-held Tobruk from 13 to 14 September 1942, during the Second World War. A Special Interrogation Group party, fluent in German, took part in missions behind enemy lines. Diversionary actions extended to Benghazi (Operation Bigamy), Jalo oasis (Operation Nicety) and Barce (Operation Caravan). The Tobruk raid was an Allied disaster; the British lost several hundred men killed and captured, one cruiser, two destroyers, six motor torpedo boats and dozens of small amphibious craft.

==Background==
The objective of Operation Agreement was to undermine the Axis war effort in North Africa by destroying airfields, harbour facilities, supply ships, vehicles and large oil stores. The Allies also intended to capture Jalo oasis, which was to be used as a rendezvous for the retreating ground forces involved in the other operations.

==Course==
===Prelude===
G1 and T1 patrols of the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) with 50 men, 12 light trucks and five jeeps assaulted Barce airfield and the main barracks, destroying 16 aircraft and damaging seven more. In the attack on the barracks, the LRDG lost four men and two vehicles. Near Zaptié the LRDG force was intercepted by an Italian motorised company with all but two lorries damaged or destroyed. The lorries were loaded with the most seriously injured, while the others went on foot for . The Italians took seven New Zealanders and three Rhodesians prisoner, all injured. After a year, four of the New Zealanders were able to escape.
Lieutenant Colonel David Stirling and a party of the Special Air Service, supported by S1 and S2 patrols of the LRDG, were to attempt a big raid on Benghazi but after running late, their presence was discovered after a clash at a roadblock as dawn broke. With the element of surprise lost and the protection of darkness receding, Stirling ordered a withdrawal. The attack on Jalo Oasis was carried out by the Sudan Defence Force and S1 and S2 patrols of the LRDG. The first attack on the night of 15/16 September, was easily repelled by the defenders, who were on the alert and had been reinforced. The attackers withdrew on 19 September as an Italian relief column approached the oasis.

===Main attack===
Operation Agreement involved an amphibious force of about 400 Royal Marines, 180 infantry from the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Captain Norman MacFie), 14 Platoon, Z Company, 1 Battalion, Royal Northumberland Fusiliers (Lieutenant Ernest Raymond) and around 150 SAS (Lt. Col. John Edward Haselden) approaching from the desert. The amphibious force was split into Force A, supported by destroyers and intended to land the marines on the peninsula north of Tobruk, while Force C, composed of coastal units, was directed towards an inlet east of Tobruk harbour. Force B captured an Italian 152 mm coastal battery but this was quickly retaken by Italian marines from the San Marco Battalion; Haselden was killed in action. Most of the shore batteries and positions remained in Axis hands.

==== Force A ====
Force E, a group of commandos from the submarine failed to set up beacons on the shore to guide the main British force, due to the bad sea conditions. The garrison had been reinforced and the destroyers and bringing in the seaborne troops landed them on the wrong beach, far to the west of the intended landing place. The British destroyer &quot;Sikh&quot;, which led the landing attempt, was hit by Italian 152 mm (6-inch) shore batteries and German 88 mm anti-tank guns, while taking on troops. &quot;Zulu&quot; had gone to the rescue but was unable to pull &quot;Sikh&quot; clear and it eventually sank; 122 members of the crew were reported killed and the survivors, most of them rescued from the water by the retreating amphibious boats, were eventually taken prisoner. On the afternoon of 14 September, while returning to Alexandria, was badly damaged by German Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; dive-bombers from Crete and 63 crew were killed. &quot;Coventry&quot; was scuttled by &quot;Zulu&quot; which was hit by German Ju 87 and Junkers Ju 88 dive-bombers a little later. While under tow and from Alexandria, &quot;Zulu&quot; sank, with the loss of 39 crew.

==== Force C ====

Another landing by motor launches and boats, carrying the Highlanders and Fusiliers (part of Hammer Force, whose Vickers MMGs were to defend the perimeter) failed to reach the landing point. Because of the massed fire from Tobruk harbour, only MTB 261 and MTB 314, made it into Marsa Umm el Sciausc, the target cove. MTB 314 was stranded in the shallow water but MTB 261 managed to land Sergeant &#x27;Dusty&#x27; Miller and a group of Fusiliers and sail out. The motor launches ML 353, ML 352 and ML 349 and 17 MTBs were beaten back by boom defences and an Italian flotilla of torpedo boats and (armed motor barges).

Three MTBs launched torpedoes at the naval vessels in harbour, to no avail. ML 353 was set on fire and scuttled, either hit by the Italian warships or strafed by Italian Macchi C.200 fighters, while ML 352, MTB 308, MTB 310 and MTB 312 were lost to Axis aircraft. MTB 314, the motor torpedo boat that was damaged and run aground during the battle, was captured by the German harbour minesweeper &quot;R-10&quot; at dawn, with 117 seamen and soldiers on board. Although they were dive-bombed and strafed during their return journey, most of the infantry-carrying MTBs reached Alexandria.

==Aftermath==
Dozens of British sailors and marines were rescued from the sea and taken prisoner by the Italian torpedo boats , , the armed tug &quot;Vega&quot;, a flotilla of German harbour minesweepers and several German and Italian motor barges. A number of makeshift motor amphibious craft, stragglers from Force A, attempting to reach Alexandria at very low speed, were also captured with their crews. The commander of &quot;Sikh&quot;, Captain John Micklethwait, was taken prisoner when an Italian motor barge seized one of the Royal Marines&#x27; motor boats and the two lighters the vessel was towing. A dinghy manned by the survivors of ML 352 following the same escape route was caught by &quot;Castore&quot; at midday. Losses amounted to about 300 Royal Marines, 160 soldiers, 280 sailors, the anti-aircraft cruiser &quot;Coventry&quot;, the destroyers &quot;Sikh&quot; and &quot;Zulu&quot;, two motor launches, four MTBs and several small amphibious craft. The Royal Marines suffered 81 killed and the Navy suffered the loss of another 217 men in the ship sinkings; about 576 survivors were taken prisoner. Axis losses were 15 Italians and one German killed, 43 Italians and seven Germans wounded.

<text>Petrópolis (), also known as the Imperial City, is a municipality in the Southeast Region of Brazil. It is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro, northeast of the city of Rio de Janeiro. According to the 2022 Brazilian census, Petrópolis municipality had a population of 278,881 inhabitants. Besides being the largest and most populous city in the , the city also has the largest GDP and HDI in the region.

The town&#x27;s name (&quot;City of Peter&quot;) honors Pedro II, the last Emperor of Brazil, who is entombed there at the Cathedral of Saint Peter of Alcantara. The city was the summer residence of the Brazilian Emperors and aristocrats in the 19th century, and was the official capital of the state of Rio de Janeiro during the First Brazilian Republic, between 1894 and 1902.

There are projects to annex Petrópolis again to the Metropolitan Region of Rio de Janeiro, because it is linked to the capital by political and economic ties and contains one of the state&#x27;s highest HDIs.

==History==
===Colonial period===

Until the 18th century, the region was inhabited by the &quot;índios coroados&quot; (crowned Indians), which earned it the Portuguese name of &quot;&quot;Sertão dos Índios Coroados&quot;. It was only with the discovery of gold in Minas Gerais and the consequent opening of the new way of the mines that passed through Petrópolis in that century that the region began to be occupied by non-Indians. The town&#x27;s origins can be traced to Bernardo Soares de Proença, who between 1722 and 1725 opened an alternative route between Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais, across the Serra da Estrela called &quot;Caminho Novo das Minas&quot;&quot; (New Road to Mines).

===Imperial period===
While traveling to Minas Gerais along this route in 1822, Emperor Pedro I stayed at a farm owned by a Catholic priest, named Correia, and found the region&#x27;s climate pleasant. As the priest&#x27;s sister and heiress refused to sell his property, the Emperor bought the neighboring one, called the Córrego Seco Farm, in 1830. He had his summer palace built there, but never saw it finished, because he stepped down from the throne on April 7, 1831. Other Brazilian aristocrats eventually followed suit.

His son, Emperor Pedro II, on March 16, 1843, signed an imperial decree ordering the construction of a settlement (to be formed with the arrival of German immigrants) and the construction of the dreamy summer palace on his outlying lands, the cornerstone of which was settled by the Emperor in May 1845, and that was ready in 1847. Conceived by Major Julius Friedrich Koeler, it is considered to be the second planned city in Brazil (after Recife, designed during the Dutch period), being composed of an urban nucleus – the city (now the center), where the Imperial Palace, Public buildings, commerce and services.

From then on, the city became the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of the Empire of Brazil during the summer, with the whole court moving. Large numbers of well-to-do inhabitants of the city of Rio de Janeiro also spent the summer in Petrópolis to escape the outbreaks of yellow fever. Emperor Pedro II ruled for 49 years, and remained in Petrópolis for at least forty summers, for up to five months. On 29 September 1857, the town was elevated to the status of a city. In 1861, the first Macadamized Highway in Brazil, Estrada União e Indústria, was inaugurated, connecting Petrópolis to the city of Juiz de Fora in Minas Gerais. In 1883, a railroad arrived at the city on the initiative of the Baron of Mauá. Also in 1877, the first telephone line in Brazil (and the first outside of the United States) was built, connecting Pedro&#x27;s summer palace to his farm headquarters.

Regardless of the time of year, foreign diplomatic representatives lived in Petrópolis for most of the imperial period.

===Republican period===
Even after the establishment of the Republic and the exile of the Imperial family in 1889, the city continued to play a significant role in Brazilian history. It was a frequent choice as a summer residence for Presidents of the republic, who lodged at the Palácio Rio Negro (Black River Palace). The most frequent of them was Getúlio Vargas, whose stays, during Estado Novo, lasted up to three months.

Between 1894 and 1902, the city was capital of the State of Rio de Janeiro, replacing Niterói, due to the two Navy Revolts. Also in this period, was chosen Hermogênio Silva, the only Deputy Governor of Rio de Janeiro whose political base was in Petrópolis. In 1897, the first cinema session took place in the city, with a cinematographer showing the Lumière brothers&#x27; first films. In 1903, the Treaty of Petrópolis, which gave Brazil the Acre territory, was signed between Brazil and Bolivia, at the residence of the Baron of Rio Branco. The sanitarian Oswaldo Cruz was named its first mayor in 1916. On the premises of the Quitandinha Palace, the declaration of war of the American countries to the Axis Powers was signed during World War II (1939–1945).

During the Brazilian military government in the 1970s, there was a center for torture, called &quot;the house of death&quot;.

In 1973 the remains of Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil (1846–1921), and her husband, the Count of Eu, were brought to be buried in the Imperial Mausoleum. The Princess received a funeral of the Head of State with the presence of the most important leaders of the Republic and the Brazilian Imperial Family and it was declared a public holiday.

On 15 February 2022, over 150 people were killed by floods in Petrópolis following intense rainfall that caused mudslides.

==Geography==
Nestled among the forested hills of the Serra dos Órgãos, in the valley of the Quitandinha and Piabanha rivers, Petrópolis is a popular winter holiday spot. Besides the climate and surroundings, the main attraction is the former Summer Palace of the last Brazilian Emperor, which is now the Imperial Museum, specializing in Imperial history and memorabilia.

The culture of Petrópolis is directly linked to the imperial period of Brazil. Being nicknamed as Imperial City, the city has a large collection of theaters, museums, and palaces that refer to the period. In addition, much of the culture of the city was influenced by the immigration that participated in the formation of the identity of Petrópolis, where the German, Portuguese, Syrian, Lebanese, and Italian groups stand out. Even today the city has the second largest festival of German culture in Brazil, the Bauernfest, only losing to the Oktoberfest in the south of the country. In addition, festivals are held every year that bring back the culture of other peoples, such as the Serra Serata, in honor of Italian immigration, and Bunka-Sai, a celebration of Japanese culture. The Cultural Foundation promotes every year (since 2009) the Maestro Guerra-Peixe de Cultura Prize, which honors the most outstanding artists and cultural agents during the year; The patron César Guerra-Peixe was an illustrious composer Petropolitan.

===Architecture===

The city has unique architecture, such as the Palácio Quitandinha, the Petropolitan Academy of Letters, the House Museum of Santos Dumont, the Imperial Museum of Brazil, the Dom Pedro Theater, the &quot;Casa do Colono Museum,&quot; and the Cathedral of Saint Peter of Alcantara. The palace is the main building of the so-called &quot;historic center&quot;, where Koeler Avenue stands out, surrounded by mansions and palaces of the 19th century. The road is perpendicular to the facade of the Cathedral of Saint Peter of Alcantara and, in the other direction, the Ruy Barbosa Square and the façade of the Catholic University.

In the so-called &quot;historic center&quot;, there are also buildings such as &quot;Encantada&quot; (summer house of Santos Dumont); the Crystal Palace; the Yellow Palace (City Council); the Rio Negro Palace, bordering the city hall (Sérgio Fadel Palace); and curious buildings such as the &quot;castelinho&quot; of the self-proclaimed &quot;Duke of Belfort&quot;, on the corner of Koeler and Ruy Barbosa Square, or the old house of the Rocha Miranda family, on Avenida Ipiranga – same address of another residence of the same family, in a sixties style. Modern lines are also present in the house of Lúcio Costa, in the neighborhood of Samambaia.

===Theatres===
Petrópolis has 2 theaters. The &quot;Teatro Dom Pedro&quot;, created in Art Deco style and inaugurated in 1933 by D&#x27;Angelo &amp; Cia, is one of the largest in the state. The place was created with different styles, with mythological and futuristic references, making the theater considered an eclectic style, becoming a cultural and artistic reference for Petrópolis. The city also owns the Teatro Santa Cecília, built in 1955, located in Rua Aureliano Coutinho in the center of the city.

===Museums===
Petrópolis has great traditions as an imperial city. For this reason, today it owns one of the most important museums of the history of Brazil, the Imperial Museum. Built between 1845 and 1862 as the summer Palace of the Imperial Family, it has a collection of pieces linked to the Brazilian monarchy, including furniture, documents, works of art, and personal objects belonging to the Imperial Family. The Palace was turned into a museum in 1943 by decree of the then president Getúlio Vargas. In addition, the city has the Petrópolis Wax Museum, &quot;Casa Santos Dumont Museum&quot;, &quot;Casa do Colono Museum&quot;, &quot;Princess Isabel House,&quot; and Rio Negro Palace, all located in the city center.

With more than 321,000 visitors, the Imperial Museum in Petrópolis was the most visited museum in Brazil in 2016, according to data from the Brazilian Institute of Museums (Ibram) of the Ministry of Culture.

===Festivals===
The Petrópolis culture is directly linked to German immigration. Since 1989, Bauernfest, a typical feast in honor of German immigrants, is held every year. The festival in 2012 lasted 11 days, had the participation of 368,000 visitors, and raised R$55 million. The festival welcomes foreign tourists from all over Brazil, especially from the city of Rio de Janeiro. It is the most influential party of the city and includes competitions of chope the meter, presentations, typical cuisine, exhibition of chocolates, among other attractions.

The city also holds the Serra Serata, an annual festival that celebrates immigration and Italian culture.

Petrópolis also hosts the Winter Festival, promoted by SESC, with several attractions for this period of the year, which usually happens in the Quitandinha Palace. The festival is already traditional in the cities of Petrópolis, Nova Friburgo, and Teresópolis. In 2014, the 13th edition was held, counting on concerts, theatrical presentations, and cultural events.

The city also hosts Bunka-Sai, the annual festival of Japanese culture, which had its first edition in 2009. It has cultural presentations, in addition to the Japanese gastronomic festival.

===Carnival===
In 2013, the carnival of the city was canceled, for the application of funds in the approximate amount of R$1 million, previously used in the parades, in the area of health, thus making Petrópolis a refuge of Cariocas of the Carnival. The decision was made during a meeting between the mayor and the Foundation for Culture and Tourism.

==Sport==
Serrano Football Club was founded on 29 June 1915 and was Garrincha&#x27;s first professional team.

==Media==
The main television station transmitting news related to the city is &quot;InterTV Serra + Mar&quot;, as well as other local broadcasters such as SBT Rio and Band Rio, which present news from the mountain region of Rio de Janeiro, mainly related to Petrópolis and Nova Friburgo. The city also has local television networks with a certain influence: Rede Petrópolis de Televisão, TV Vila Imperial, and TV Cidade de Petrópolis, with headquarters located in the center.

The city&#x27;s main written newspaper is the &quot;Tribuna de Petrópolis&quot;, one of the oldest in the country, created in 1909, published from Tuesday to Sunday, whose headquarters are in the center. Also worthy of note is the newspaper &quot;Diário de Petrópolis&quot;, published daily, of great influence in the city.

The main and most listened to radio stations with headquarters in Petrópolis are &quot;Radio Tribuna&quot; FM (88.5 MHz), &quot;Radio UCP&quot; (106.3 MHz), &quot;Radio Supernova FM&quot; (98.7 MHz), and &quot;Radio Imperial&quot; (1550 AM). In addition, radio stations based in the city of Rio de Janeiro, such as the &quot;MIX FM Rio Radio&quot;, which already owned an exclusive domain of Radio MIX in Petrópolis and was later purchased by Rádio UCP, are also very much listened to.

In recent years, the internet has proved to be one of the main sources of news. In Petrópolis, some include the G1 of the Serrana Region, the online portal of the Tribuna de Petrópolis, and the Diário de Petrópolis, besides the site Acontece in Petrópolis and the portal with live broadcast of TVC 16 (TV Cidade de Petrópolis). Also worth mentioning is the online portal of the RPT (Rede Petrópolis de Televisão).

<doc id="504175" wikidata="Q3785746" url="?curid=504175" title="Detuner">
<text>Detuners are mechanical devices used to simplify the tuning of a stringed instrument during performance. This allows musicians to quickly and accurately reach notes outside the normal range of their instruments. These devices are also known by other names including &#x27;drop head&#x27; and &#x27;hipshot&#x27;.

They can be fitted at either or both ends of any or all of the strings. For example, a relatively common arrangement on the bass guitar is to use a detuner on the lowest string to allow the bassist to switch between &#x27;standard tuning&#x27; (E A D G) and &#x27;drop D&#x27; (D A D G). The latter provides two extra notes (D and D# / Eb) that are particularly useful in several common keys.

However, there are many possible variants – for example, bass guitarist Michael Manring has made extensive use of detuners in some of his compositions and has a four-stringed bass guitar with multiple detuners. Bass guitarist and youtuber Charles Berthoud also makes extensive use of detuners, generally on a LeFay D-Tuner (which as the name hints was designed with a detuner on each string). Adrian Legg is a popular guitarist making use of rapid tuning changes. He was prominent in the late 1980s. 

The idea may have originated from the double bass extenders.</text><links>

<text>Arncliffe is a small village and civil parish in Littondale, one of the Yorkshire Dales in England. Littondale is a small valley beside Upper Wharfedale, beyond Kilnsey and its famous crag. It is part of the Craven district of the non-metropolitan county of North Yorkshire, but is in the historic West Riding of Yorkshire. The population of the civil parish was estimated at 80 in 2015.

==Overview==
Situated on a gravel delta above the flood-plain of the River Skirfare, Arncliffe&#x27;s houses, cottages, and other buildings face a large green, and green hillsides etched with limestone scars. A barn to the north of the green is a good example of the local style, with an unusual entrance, and a datestone of 1677.

Behind the village buildings are several small crofts, nearly one to each house, and beyond these, limestone walls climb the surrounding hills separating higher fields. St Oswald&#x27;s Church lies close to the river a little north of the village, and the road up the dale crosses the river past Bridge End where Charles Kingsley stayed, and Old Cotes, built in 1650, whose gabled porch has a 3-light window somewhat characteristic of late 17th century houses in this area of the dales. A narrow, winding road climbs steeply southwards from the village, across the fells towards Malham. Paths also go towards Kettlewell and Starbotton.

Arncliffe was the original setting for the fictional village of &quot;Beckindale&quot; in the ITV soap opera &quot;Emmerdale Farm&quot;, from its inception in 1972 until moving to Esholt in 1976. Some scenes for the 2020 TV series &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot; were filmed in Arncliffe. The village pub, The Falcon Inn, has appeared in both shows.

The village is the birthplace of &quot;Up Series&quot; participant Nicholas Hitchon.

==History==
Arncliffe was first mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. The toponym is of Old English origin, meaning &quot;eagles&#x27; cliff&quot; (from &quot;earn&quot; &quot;eagle&quot;).

The ancient parish of Arncliffe was part of Staincliffe Wapentake in the West Riding of Yorkshire. The parish also included the townships of Hawkswick, Litton, Halton Gill and Buckden. All these places became separate civil parishes in 1866.

Arncliffe was transferred to the new county of North Yorkshire in 1974.

<doc id="504182" wikidata="Q167047" url="?curid=504182" title="Prairie skink">
<text>The prairie skink (Plestiodon septentrionalis) is a species of skink endemic to the prairies east of the Rocky Mountains in North America. It is one of only seven species of lizards that occur in Canada.

==Taxonomy==
The prairie skink was first described by Baird in 1859. Two subspecies are generally recognized, including the nominotypical subspecies:
* Northern prairie skink, &quot;P. s. septentrionalis&quot; Baird, 1859, originally described as &quot;Plestiodon septentrionalis&quot;.
* Southern prairie skink, &quot;P. s. obtusirostris&quot; (Bocourt, 1879), originally described as &quot;Eumeces obtusirostris&quot;.

A third subspecies was described as &quot;Eumeces s. pallidus&quot;, the &quot;pallid skink&quot;, by H.M. Smith and Slater in 1949, but this subspecies is absent from the literature for the past more than 40 years, and it is unclear whether it exists or coincides with one of the other two subspecies.

The scientific name of the species derives from Latin: &quot;septentrionalis&quot; means &quot;northern&quot;. Latin &quot;obtusirostris&quot; means &quot;blunt-nosed&quot;. Despite the scientific name &quot;P. septentrionalis obtusirostris&quot; translating to &quot;blunt-nosed northern great skink&quot;, it &quot;is&quot; a southern subspecies.

==Description==
The prairie skink is a small lizard, reaching a total length (body + tail) of about 13 to 22 cm (5 to nearly 9 inches). Adult prairie skinks are brown or tan on the back and darker on the sides and have several thin lighter stripes along the sides and the back. Juveniles have bright blue tails, the color of which fades when they mature.

==Behavior==
Prairie skinks are good burrowers; they hibernate in burrows they dig themselves below the frost line. They are very secretive and are rarely seen in the open except during their breeding season in spring.

==Diet==
They feed on small invertebrates, preferring spiders, crickets, and grasshoppers, but avoiding ants.

==Life cycle==
Prairie skinks hibernate from about September to late April. In spring, when they emerge, the males start developing a bright orange coloring on the jaws and throat: the breeding season has begun. The female lays eight to ten eggs after a gestation time of about 40 days. The eggs hatch in August; hatchlings are about long. They reach sexual maturity in their third year.

==Habitat==
The prairie skink lives in sandy habitat or open grasslands with loose soil, preferably with some rocks providing shelter and places to bask in the sun, and close to a water source.

==Geographic range==
The ranges of the two subspecies are disjunct. The range of the northern subspecies extends from eastern North Dakota and Minnesota south to central Kansas. A small isolated population lives in southwestern Manitoba in Canada—it is the only lizard in Manitoba and is one of only seven lizard species to occur in Canada; the northern prairie skink is protected in Canada. The southern subspecies occurs in Oklahoma and Texas.

<text>A settle is a wooden bench, usually with arms and a high back, long enough to accommodate three or four sitters.

==Description==
Settles are commonly movable, but occasionally fixed. The settle shares with the chest and the chair the distinction of great antiquity. Its high back was a protection from the draughts of medieval buildings, protection which was sometimes increased by the addition of winged ends or a wooden canopy. It was most frequently placed near the fire in the common sitting-room. According to historian Claudia Kinmonth, in early furniture inventories the use of the terms bench and settle were interchangeable, but that generally a settle was understood to have arms.

Constructed of oak or other hardwood, it was extremely heavy, solid, and durable. Few English examples of earlier date than the middle of the 16th century are extant; survivals from the Jacobean period are more numerous. Settles of the more expensive type were often elaborately carved or incised; others were divided into plain panels. They were commonly used in farmhouse kitchens or manorial halls. Its vogue did not long outlast the first half of the 18th century.

=== Variations ===
Elaborate specimens of oak settles with very tall backs, sometimes a cupboard built into them, or a box under the seat, are referred to as &quot;monks settles&quot;, but Frederick Robinson writing in 1905 was of the opinion that none of them were of any great age. Two pre-reformation settles of which he was aware are in Winchester Cathedral. Neither of them contain cupboards or boxes.
The English architect and designer William Burges designed the Zodiac settle, made between 1869 and 1870. The settle is painted and illustrated with dancing Zodiac signs, and adorned with inlaid pieces of glass crystal and vellum.

In Ireland, settles were a feature of domestic furniture into the 20th century. Historically, some areas of the country had settles with distinctive features. In the south and west of the country, settles were often constructed with a heavy open frame of pine, which was morticed and tenoned, with a boarded or panelled backrest. These deep settles were wide enough for someone to sleep comfortably on them, but without cushions, they were a less comfortable seat. Irish immigrants brought this style of &quot;open-frame settles&quot; abroad. In Irish homes, the settle was placed along a back wall, near the hearth, with the panelled back protecting the sitter from the cold, damp walls of traditional Irish houses. In parts of Ireland where timber was more scarce, the back panel was simpler with a more economic use of vertical slats rather than panels. Around counties Cork and Kerry, settles were often called &quot;racks&quot; and were noted as uncomfortable items of furniture. The &quot;Carbery settle&quot; is a settle with a one-legged falling table which was found in County Cork. Examples of these settles are extremely rare. Another variation was similar to the chicken coops built into Irish dressers, with the area underneath the seat used to house turkeys or other vulnerable fowl. In a similar fashion to dressers, all settles in Ireland were often painted in bright gloss paint.

== Settle bed ==

The settle bed was a metamorphising piece of furniture, functioning as a seat during the day, and converting into a bed at night which first appeared in Ireland in the early 1600s. The hinged seat could be opened out onto the floor to create a bed. Settle beds were in regular use in Ireland into the 1950s, with some retained as beds for visitors until the 1990s. These beds were also known as &quot;saddle beds&quot;, &quot;press beds&quot;, or &quot;sepple beds&quot;. The beds could be used to accommodate travelling workmen or craftsmen, or for children. Like dressers, it is likely that most settle beds were constructed in situ.

== Settle table ==
Similar to the settle bed, the settle table (or monk&#x27;s bench) was a configuration of settle bed which allowed for a hinged back to be tipped 90 degrees for form a table. Settle tables were most common in Ireland in counties Wexford, Kilkenny and Waterford. Examples of settle tables can also be found in England and Wales.

Robinson also describes a specimen of a settle and table combination, with a chest in the seat that was made in the 17th century (see right). &quot;The flanges in the back have a long slit in the lower half, into which fits a peg on the inside of the back of the arm. The back is raised and drawn forwards to serve as a table top as far as the play of the pegs in the slit allows&quot;.

<text>Weilheim-Schongau is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the south of Bavaria, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from the north clockwise) Landsberg, Starnberg, Bad Tölz-Wolfratshausen, Garmisch-Partenkirchen and Ostallgäu.

==Geography==
The district is located in the northern foothills of the Alps. The main rivers of the district are the Lech and the Ammer. The &quot;Ammersee&quot; and the &quot;Starnberger See&quot; lakes are at the northern boundary of the district.

==History==
The district was formed in 1972 by merging the former districts Weilheim and Schongau, and one municipality from the former district Marktoberdorf.
==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms combines the symbols of the two precursor districts. The lion in top as the symbol of the Hohenstaufen dynasty was taken from the coat of arms of the district Weilheim. The crosier and the mining tools in the bottom are derived from the coat of arms of the district Schongau, symbolizing both the important monasteries as well as the coal mining in the district.

<doc id="504209" wikidata="Q870786" url="?curid=504209" title="Dancing Queen">
<text>&quot;Dancing Queen&quot; is a song by the Swedish group ABBA, released as the lead single from their fourth studio album, &quot;Arrival&quot; (1976). It was written by Benny Andersson, Björn Ulvaeus and Stig Anderson. Andersson and Ulvaeus also produced the song. &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; was released as a single in Sweden in August 1976, followed by a UK release and the rest of Europe. It was a worldwide hit. It became ABBA&#x27;s only number one hit in the United States, and topped the charts in Australia, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, Portugal, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, West Germany and the Soviet Union. &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; also reached the top five in many other countries.

Musically, &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; is a Europop version of American disco music. As disco music dominated the US charts, the group decided to follow the trend, replicating Phil Spector&#x27;s Wall of Sound arrangements. Andersson and Ulvaeus have cited George McCrae&#x27;s &quot;Rock Your Baby&quot; as a source of inspiration for the style of the song. The song alternates between &quot;languid yet seductive verses&quot; and a &quot;dramatic chorus that ascends to heart-tugging high notes&quot;. It features keyboard lines by Andersson, which accentuate the melody&#x27;s sophistication and classical complexity, while Ulvaeus and Andersson interlace many instrumental hooks in and out of the mix. Agnetha Fältskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad’s layered vocals have been noted for their dynamism, &quot;[negotiating] the melody&#x27;s many turns flawlessly.&quot; Lyrically, the song concerns a visit to the discothèque, but approaches the subject from the joy of dancing itself.

In 2015, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Background and release==
The recording sessions for &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; began on 4 August 1975. The demo was called &quot;Boogaloo&quot; and as the sessions progressed, Andersson and Ulvaeus found inspiration in the dance rhythm of George McCrae&#x27;s &quot;Rock Your Baby&quot;, as well as the drumming on Dr. John&#x27;s 1972 album, &quot;Dr. John&#x27;s Gumbo&quot;. The opening melody echoes &quot;Sing My Way Home&quot; by Delaney &amp; Bonnie (from &quot;Motel Shot&quot;, 1971). Fältskog and Lyngstad recorded the vocals during sessions in September 1975, and the track was completed three months later.

During the sessions, Benny Andersson brought a tape home with the backing track on it and played it to Anni-Frid Lyngstad, who apparently started crying when listening. Lyngstad said, &quot;I found the song so beautiful. It&#x27;s one of those songs that goes straight to your heart&quot;. Agnetha Fältskog later said: &quot;It&#x27;s often difficult to know what will be a hit. The exception was &#x27;Dancing Queen.&#x27; We all knew it was going to be massive.&quot;

While working on the lyrics, the first half of the second verse was scrapped: &quot;Baby, baby, you&#x27;re out of sight/hey, you&#x27;re looking all right tonight/when you come to the party/listen to the guys/they&#x27;ve got the look in their eyes...&quot; It survives in footage from a recording session.

The band (especially Andersson) wanted to release &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; as the follow-up single to &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; but their manager, Stig Anderson, insisted that the more sedate and folksy &quot;Fernando&quot; should be first, as he felt it would appeal to a broader audience and so was more likely to be a hit. Therefore, whilst &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; premiered on both German and Japanese television during the spring of 1976, the song did not appear on vinyl until later that summer, having had its first live and domestic performance on 18 June 1976 during an all-star gala staged by Kjerstin Dellert at the Royal Swedish Opera (and shown on Swedish TV) in honour of King Carl XVI Gustaf and his bride-to-be, Silvia Sommerlath, who were married the next day. For their 1980 Spanish-language compilation-album &quot;Gracias Por La Música&quot;, ABBA recorded a Spanish version of &quot;Dancing Queen&quot;, renamed &quot;Reina Danzante&quot;, with Spanish lyrics provided by Buddy and Mary McCluskey. The track was retitled &quot;La Reina Del Baile&quot; when included on the compilation album &quot;ABBA Oro: Grandes Éxitos&quot; in the 1990s.

In 1993, in honour of Swedish Queen Silvia&#x27;s 50th birthday, Anni-Frid Lyngstad was asked to perform &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; on stage, repeating ABBA&#x27;s 1976 performance of the song at the pre-wedding gala for King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia. Frida contacted the Real Group and together they did an a cappella version of the song on stage at the Royal Opera House in Stockholm, in front of the king and queen. The Swedish prime minister at the time, Ingvar Carlsson, was also in the audience that night and said it was an ingenious idea to perform &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; a cappella. The performance was recorded by Sveriges Television (SVT) and is included in the biographical documentary &quot;Frida – The DVD&quot; and the Real Group&#x27;s 1994 compilation album &quot;Varför får man inte bara vara som man är&quot;. When King Carl Gustaf and Queen Silvia attended the Tramp nightclub in London, the King requested that the DJ would play &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; owing to its use shortly before their wedding as previously mentioned.

For the soundtrack of the 1994 Australian film &quot;Muriel&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, songwriters Ulvaeus and Andersson allowed the use of &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; and other ABBA hits. &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; was among the ABBA songs included in &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot;, the jukebox musical first produced in 1999 and adapted into film in 2008, as well as the sequel, &quot;Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again&quot; (2018).

The first International Standard Musical Work Code was assigned in 1995 to &quot;Dancing Queen&quot;; the code is T-000.000.001-0.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Dancing Queen&quot; received widespread critical acclaim upon release. According to Donald A. Guarisco of AllMusic, the track&#x27;s &quot;sincerity and sheer musicality have allowed it to outlast the disco boom and become a standard of dance-pop.&quot; The song&#x27;s release also cemented ABBA as an international act and signified the beginning of the group&#x27;s &#x27;classic period&#x27;, which would span the following four years. It has become a standard for dance divas like Carol Douglas and Kylie Minogue, and it has been covered numerous times by acts including Ireland&#x27;s U2. The song has been adopted by the LGBT community and, according to &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine, remains one of the most ubiquitous &quot;gay anthems&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; found the theme of a person&#x27;s greatest experience coming at a disco age 17 to be more substantive than most ABBA songs, and compared the vocal harmonies to the Mamas and the Papas. &quot;Cash Box&quot; said that the song is &quot;backed by a strong upbeat, in keeping with the title&quot; and &quot;the hooks brought by lush vocal harmonies, as well as the reverb-soaked wall of sound that distinguishes this group, are present.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; said that &quot;the disco-styled treatment should make it a favorite [in the United States].&quot;

==Chart performance==
&quot;Dancing Queen&quot; was a worldwide No. 1 hit, topping the charts in more than a dozen countries including ABBA&#x27;s native Sweden (where it spent 14 weeks at the top), Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, West Germany, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway (where it charted for 32 weeks (VG-lista Top 10), making it the 11th best-performing single in that country), South Africa and Rhodesia. &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; also topped the charts in the United States, ABBA&#x27;s only  1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and was a Top 5 hit in Austria, Finland, France and Switzerland. The song sold over three million copies. The track was the fourth biggest single of 1976 in the UK.

In the UK Singles Chart, &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; was the last of three consecutive chart-toppers for ABBA in 1976, following &quot;Mamma Mia&quot; and &quot;Fernando&quot; earlier in the year. The song was re-released in the UK in 1992, taking advantage of an ABBA revival sparked by the success of Erasure&#x27;s &quot;Abba-esque&quot; EP. The re-issued &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; reached No. 16 in the UK in September 1992.

As of September 2021, it is ABBA&#x27;s biggest song in the UK, being their only million-seller with 1.65 million chart sales, including 93 million streams since 2014. In 2023, it was listed as the 102nd best-selling single of all time in the UK.

The song re-entered the Swedish Sverigetopplistan in 2021 and 2024. In 2022 it was reported to be the fifth most profitable song in Sweden in 2021, and to have more than 19 million weekly streams on Spotify.

==Legacy==
In 2000, &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; came fourth in a Channel 4 television poll of &quot;The 100 Greatest Number One Singles&quot;. It was chosen as No. 148 on the Recording Industry Association of America&#x27;s Songs of the Century list. It was ranked No. 171 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2004 list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, the only ABBA song on the list. That same year, it made VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Dance Songs in Rock &amp; Roll&quot; at No. 97. Also in 2000, editors of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; with MTV compiled a list of the best 100 pop songs; &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; placed 12th among songs of the 1970s. &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; both ranked the song number one on their lists of the greatest ABBA songs. In 2023, it was ranked No. 2 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s list of &quot;The 500 Best Pop Songs&quot;.

On 9 November 2002, the results of a poll, &quot;Top 50 Favourite UK #1&#x27;s&quot;, was broadcast on Radio 2, celebrating the 50th anniversary of The Official UK Charts Company. 188,357 listeners voted and &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; came out at No. 8. On 5 December 2010, Britain&#x27;s ITV broadcast the results of a poll to determine &quot;The Nation&#x27;s Favourite ABBA Song&quot; in which &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; placed at No. 2.

In 2009, the British performing rights group Phonographic Performance Limited celebrated its 75th anniversary by listing the 75 songs that have played most in Great Britain on the radio, in clubs and on jukeboxes. &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; was number eight on the list.

Former US presidential candidate John McCain named &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; as his favourite song in a top-10 list submitted to &quot;Blender&quot; magazine in August 2008.

In August 2012, listeners to the 1970s-themed UK radio station &quot;Smooth 70s&quot; voted &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; as their favourite hit of the decade.

In October 2014, the musical instrument insurer Musicguard carried out a survey determining &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; to be the United Kingdom&#x27;s favourite &quot;floorfiller&quot;. Unlike its closest competitors, &quot;Billie Jean&quot; by Michael Jackson (No. 2) and &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; by the Beatles (No. 3), it turned out to be very popular throughout the nation whereas the other two were strong regional favourites.

In June 2015, &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; was inducted into the Recording Academy&#x27;s Grammy Hall of Fame.

Online music magazine &quot;Pitchfork&quot; positioned &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; at number 80 in its 2016 ranking of the 200 best songs of the 1970s. Reviewer Cameron Cook wrote it is &quot;a song so confident in its structure that its starts from the middle of its chorus&quot;, adding that it &quot;bottles the out-of-body euphoria that accompanies dancing for dancing&#x27;s sake, with no agenda or motive other than pure joy.&quot; Eschewing the &quot;disco&quot; label sometimes attached to the track by latter-day critics, Cook called it &quot;a pitch-perfect portrait of the hedonistic disco scene they were mimicking via their own, more down-to-Earth Europop&quot;.

In September 2016, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ran an article by Tim Jonze entitled &quot;Why Abba&#x27;s Dancing Queen is the best pop song ever&quot;. Jonze writes: &quot;Dancing Queen is beautifully produced: catchy and euphoric, the perfect backdrop for a song that encapsulates the carefree bliss of youth&quot;. Several artists are cited as being influenced by the song, including Elvis Costello (&quot;Oliver&#x27;s Army&quot;), MGMT (&quot;Time to Pretend&quot;) and Chris Stein of Blondie (&quot;Dreaming&quot;).
In 1993, Hong Kong singer Angela Pang covered this song in the Cantonese language.

The British online music industry magazine &quot;NME&quot; placed &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; at number 27 in its 2018 listing of the top 100 songs of the 70s, reviewer Rebecca Schiller calling it &quot;one of the greatest pop songs ever.&quot;

In 2022, &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; received a BMI Million-Air award, having been played 6 million times on radio in the United States. Two years later, it was inducted into the Library of Congress&#x27;s National Recording Registry.

In October 2024, during the &quot;Heavenly Harmony in Concert&quot;, singer Julie Anne San Jose held a concert featuring this song and other secular songs at the altar of the Nuestra Señora del Pilar Shrine and Parish in Mamburao, Occidental Mindoro. She, Parish Priest Fr. Carlito Meim Dimaano, and Sparkle GMA Artist Center then issued an apology.

==Music video==
The song was accompanied by a music video filmed in 1976 in Alexandra&#x27;s discotheque in central Stockholm, Sweden. The music video features all four members of ABBA singing and performing to dancing club patrons. Directed by the Swedish film director Lasse Hallström, the music video on YouTube has over 800 million views as of December 2023. The video was remastered in ultra-high definition in August 2021 to celebrate the 500 million view milestone.

Released in March 2000, the song peaked at number 95 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and entered the top 100 in Germany and the Netherlands.

In Europe, &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; was released as a double A-side with &quot;The Name of the Game&quot;.

Directed by Patrick Kiely, the video is set in a large high school. The video is a tribute to the 1980s film &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;, where the group members are left in a classroom with other students which shifts into a nightclub.

<text>The Foster–Seeley discriminator is a common type of FM detector circuit, invented in 1936 by Dudley E. Foster and Stuart William Seeley. The Foster–Seeley discriminator was envisioned for automatic frequency control of receivers, but also found application in demodulating an FM signal.

The Foster–Seeley discriminator uses a tuned RF transformer to convert frequency changes into amplitude changes. A transformer, tuned to the carrier frequency, is connected to two rectifier diodes. The circuit resembles a full bridge rectifier.

The phase of the voltage at the secondary coil depends on whether the carrier is below or above the resonance, resulting in a positive or negative shift, respectively.

The circuit makes use of the near-formula_1 phase difference occurring between the voltages in two loosely coupled resonant circuits at the peak frequency.

Through the coupling capacitor formula_2, the primary voltage is applied to the center tap of the secondary, producing a sum and a difference formula_3 on the top and the bottom terminals thereof, respectively.

Depending on the changing phase relationship of the input signal — formula_4 (and therefore formula_5) with formula_6, the amplitude of the sum/difference at the upper or lower half, respectively, will be higher, which results in a change of the voltage across the output capacitors. The choke formula_7, sometimes replaced by a resistor, provides a DC path through the rectifier diodes.

The demodulator&#x27;s bandwidth depends on the Q factor of the resonant circuit; the phase response of the secondary (and therefore, the voltage response of the circuit) to formula_8 is an S-curve.

Foster–Seeley discriminators are sensitive to both frequency and amplitude variations, unlike some detectors. Therefore a limiter amplifier stage must be used before the detector, to remove amplitude variations in the signal which would be detected as noise. The limiter acts as a class-A amplifier at lower amplitudes; at higher amplitudes it becomes a saturated amplifier which clips off the peaks and limits the amplitude.

<doc id="504211" wikidata="Q21051975" url="?curid=504211" title="Peliades">
<text>Peliades () is the earliest known tragedy by Euripides; he entered it into the Dionysia of 455 BC but did not win. In Greek mythology, the Peliades were the daughters of Pelias.

== History ==
The &quot;Peliades&quot; recounts the story of the daughters of Pelias murdering their father under the instruction of Medea, who claims to be able to make him young again, working on behalf of Jason and the Argonauts. Classicist Herbert Mierow suggested that Euripides&#x27; telling of the tragedy was influenced by Aeschylus&#x27;s play Agamemnon that was produced three years earlier in 458 BC, based on the shared opening on a fire as a signal that initiates the action of both plays.

<doc id="504212" wikidata="Q609285" url="?curid=504212" title="Striated pardalote">
<text>The striated pardalote (Pardalotus striatus) is the least colourful and most common of the four pardalote species. Other common names include pickwick, wittachew and chip-chip. It is a very small, short-tailed bird that is more often heard than seen, foraging noisily for lerps and other small creatures in the treetops.

==Taxonomy==

The striated pardalote was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the manakins in the genus &quot;Pipra&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Pipra striata&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;striped-headed manakin&quot; that had been described and illustrated in 1783 by the English ornithologist John Latham in his book &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;. Latham had examined a specimen in the collection of the naturalist Joseph Banks. The type locality is Tasmania. The striated pardalote is now placed with the three other pardalotes in the genus &quot;Pardalotus&quot; that was introduced in 1816 by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot.

Six subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;P. s. uropygialis&quot; Gould, 1840 – northeast Western Australia to Cape York Peninsula, northeast Queensland (north Australia)
* &quot;P. s. melvillensis&quot; Mathews, 1912 – Tiwi Islands (north of Northern Territory; central north Australia)
* &quot;P. s. melanocephalus&quot; Gould, 1838 – central east to southeast Queensland (east Australia)
* &quot;P. s. ornatus&quot; Temminck, 1826 – northeast New South Wales to southeast Victoria (southeast Australia)
* &quot;P. s. substriatus&quot; Mathews, 1912 – west, south Western Australia to central west Queensland and west Victoria (west, central Australia)
* &quot;P. s. striatus&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1789) – breeds on Bass Strait islands and Tasmania; non-breeding in east, southeast Australia

In the past, the nominate, &quot;substriatus&quot; and &quot;ornatus&quot; races were sometimes treated as separate species. The three northern races &quot;uropygialis&quot;, &quot;melvillensis&quot; and &quot;melanocephalus&quot; were treated as a fourth species. They are all now considered as subspecies of the striated pardalote as there is substantial evidence of interbreeding.

==Description==
The striated pardalote&#x27;s plumage varies considerably across its range. The crown is black, with subspecies &quot;substriatus&quot;, &quot;striatus&quot; and &quot;ornatus&quot; having white streaks. The eyebrow is white, starting with a yellow mark near the beak. All races have a white stripe on the wing and olive backs. The nominate race has a yellow spot on the wing, whilst the other subspecies have a red dot. The male and female are similar, juveniles have duller plumage. Similar species include the spotted pardalote and the red-browed pardalote.

==Distribution and habitat==
Striated pardalotes occupy a vast range of habitat types from tall mountain rainforest to arid scrubland, although they favour eucalyptus forest and woodlands. They are found in all parts of Australia except some of the Western Australian deserts.

==Behaviour==

===Feeding===
Striated pardalotes feed on insects and insect larvae. They usually do so in the high foliage of eucalyptus trees, but may come closer to the ground where there are lower shrubs. Feeding takes place in small groups.

====Breeding====
Breeding occurs from June to February. Two to five white, oval-shaped eggs are laid in a nest is made of bark fiber, rootlets and fine grass, and placed in tree hollow, a tunnel excavated in the side of a bank or within crevices in man-made objects. Both sexes incubate and care for the young.

====Call====
Call is a clear, sharp, musical &quot;witta-witta&quot;, the second part slightly lower, repeated regularly in intervals for long periods; striated pardalotes also give off soft, low trills.

<doc id="504217" wikidata="Q234952" url="?curid=504217" title="Betsy Ross">
<text>Elizabeth Griscom Ross (née Griscom; January 1, 1752 – January 30, 1836), also known by her second and third married names, Ashburn and Claypoole, was an American upholsterer who was credited by her relatives in 1870 with making the second official U.S. flag, accordingly known as the Betsy Ross flag. Though most historians dismiss the story, Ross family tradition holds that General George Washington, commander-in-chief of the Continental Army and two members of a congressional committee—Robert Morris and George Ross—visited Mrs. Ross in 1776. Mrs. Ross convinced George Washington to change the shape of the stars in a sketch of a flag he showed her from six-pointed to five-pointed by demonstrating that it was easier and speedier to cut the latter. However, there is no archival evidence or other recorded verbal tradition to substantiate this story of the first U.S. flag. It appears that the story first surfaced in the writings of her grandson in the 1870s (a century after the fact), with no mention or documentation in earlier decades.

Ross made flags for the Pennsylvania Navy during the American Revolution. After the Revolution, she made U.S. flags for over 50 years, including 50 garrison flags for the U.S. Arsenal on the Schuylkill River during 1811. The flags of the Pennsylvania navy were overseen by the Pennsylvania Navy Board. The board reported to the Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly&#x27;s Committee of Safety. In July 1775, the President of the Committee of Safety was Benjamin Franklin. Its members included Robert Morris and George Ross. At that time, the committee ordered the construction of gunboats that would eventually need flags as part of their equipment. As late as October 1776, Captain William Richards was still writing to the Committee of Safety to request the design that he could use to order flags for the fleet.

Ross was one of those hired to make flags for the Pennsylvanian fleet. An entry dated May 29, 1777, in the records of the Pennsylvania Navy Board, includes an order to pay her for her work. It is worded as follows:

The Pennsylvania navy&#x27;s ship color included (1) an ensign; (2) a long, narrow pennant; and (3) a short, narrow pennant. The ensign was a blue flag with 13 stripes—seven red stripes and six white stripes in the flag&#x27;s canton (upper-left-hand corner). It was flown from a pole at the rear of the ship. The long pennant had 13 vertical, red-and-white stripes near the mast; the rest was solid red. It flew from the top of the ship&#x27;s mainmast, the center pole holding the sails. The short pennant was solid red, and flew from the top of the ship&#x27;s mizzenmast—the pole holding the ship&#x27;s sails nearest the stern (rear of the ship).

==Early life and education==
Betsy Ross was born on January 1, 1752, to Samuel Griscom (1717–1793) and Rebecca James Griscom (1721–1793) on the Griscom family farm in Gloucester City, New Jersey. Ross was the eighth of seventeen children, of whom only nine survived childhood. A sister, Sarah (1745–1747), and brother, William (1748–1749), died before Elizabeth (&quot;Betsy&quot;) was born (another sister, Sarah Griscom Donaldson (1749–1785), was named after the earlier deceased Sarah). Ross was just five years old when her sister Martha (1754–1757) died, and another sister, Ann (1757–1759), only lived to the age of two. Brothers Samuel I (1753–1756) and Samuel II (1758–1761) both died at age three. Two others, twins, brother Joseph (1759–1762) and sister Abigail (1759–1762), died in one of the frequent smallpox epidemics in the autumn of 1762. Ross grew up in a household where the plain dress and strict discipline of the Quakers dominated. She learned to sew from a great aunt, Sarah Elizabeth Ann Griscom. Ross&#x27;s great-grandfather, Andrew Griscom, a member of the Quakers and a carpenter, had emigrated in 1680 from England.

After her schooling at a Quaker-run state school, Ross&#x27;s father apprenticed her to an upholsterer named William Webster.

==Ross family tradition==

Research conducted by the National Museum of American History of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., notes that the story of Betsy Ross making the first U.S. flag for General George Washington entered into the U.S. consciousness about the time of the 1876 centennial celebrations, with the Centennial Exposition then scheduled to be held in Philadelphia. In 1870, Ross&#x27;s grandson, William J. Canby, presented a research paper to the Historical Society of Pennsylvania in which he claimed that his grandmother had &quot;made with her hands the first flag&quot; of the United States. Canby said he first obtained this information from his aunt Clarissa Sydney (Claypoole) Wilson in 1857, 20 years after Ross&#x27;s death. Canby dates the historic episode based on Washington&#x27;s journey to Philadelphia, in the late spring of 1776, a year before the Second Continental Congress passed the first Flag Act of June 14, 1777.

In the 2008 book &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner: the Making of an American Icon&quot;, Smithsonian Institution experts point out that Canby&#x27;s recounting of the event appealed to patriotic Americans then eager for stories about the Revolution and its heroes and heroines. Betsy Ross was promoted as a patriotic role model for young girls and a symbol of women&#x27;s contributions to American history. American historian Laurel Thatcher Ulrich further explored this line of enquiry in a 2007 article, &quot;How Betsy Ross Became Famous: Oral Tradition, Nationalism, and the Invention of History&quot;.

Ross was merely one of several flag makers in Philadelphia (such as Rebecca Young, who is historically documented to have made the earlier Grand Union Flag of 1775–76, with the British Union Jack of the crosses of St. George and St. Andrew, in the upper corner canton and 13 alternating red and white stripes for the &quot;United Colonies&quot;) for the Continental Army, along with many other ships&#x27; colors, banners, and flags which were advertised in local newspapers.

Rebecca Young&#x27;s daughter Mary Young Pickersgill (1776–1857) made the flag of 15 stars and stripes in 1813, begun at her house and finished on the floor of a nearby brewery, delivered to the commander of the fort the year before the British attack of September 12–14, 1814, on Fort McHenry in Baltimore, during the War of 1812, (receiving a government-issued receipt for the work of two flags, a large &quot;garrison flag&quot; and a smaller &quot;storm flag&quot;), then seen by Francis Scott Key (1779–1843) and which inspired him to write the poem which later became the national anthem, &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;. Pickersgill&#x27;s small 1793 rowhouse is still preserved in East Baltimore&#x27;s Old Town neighborhood at East Pratt and Albemarle Streets and is known as the &quot;Flag House &amp; Star-Spangled Banner Museum&quot;. Occasionally over the decades, there has been some controversy and disagreement between the relative merits and historical accuracies of the two flag-making traditions and historical sites in Philadelphia and Baltimore. It is thought that Ross&#x27;s only contribution to the flag design was to change the 6-pointed stars to the easier 5-pointed stars. Scholars, however, accept the claim by Francis Hopkinson—a member of the Continental Congress who designed most of the elements of the Great Seal of the United States—that he created designs for the early U.S. flag. Hopkinson submitted letters to Congress in 1780 requesting payment for his designs. Hopkinson was the only person to make such a claim in the Revolutionary War era.

==Personal life==
While Griscom was apprenticed to upholsterer William Webster, she met John Ross, a nephew of George Ross Jr, a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence. John&#x27;s parents were Sarah Leach and the Rev. Aeneas Ross, a Church of England (later Episcopal) priest and assistant rector at the historic city parish of Christ Church. Griscom and Ross eloped in 1773, marrying at Hugg&#x27;s Tavern in Gloucester City, New Jersey.

The marriage caused a split from her Griscom family and meant her expulsion from the Quaker congregation. The young couple soon started their own upholstery business and later joined Christ Church, where their fellow congregants occasionally included visiting colony of Virginia militia regimental commander, colonel, and soon-to-be-general George Washington (of the newly organized Continental Army) and his family from their home Anglican parish of Christ Church in Alexandria, Virginia, near his Mount Vernon estate on the Potomac River, along with many other visiting notaries and delegates in future years to the soon-to-be-convened Continental Congress and the political/military leadership of the colonial rebellion. Betsy and John Ross had no children.

The American Revolutionary War broke out when the Rosses had been married for two years. As a member of the local Pennsylvania Provincial Militia and its units from the city of Philadelphia, John Ross was assigned to guard munitions. He died in 1775. According to one legend, he was killed by a gunpowder explosion, but family sources provide doubts about this claim. The 24-year-old Elizabeth (&quot;Betsy&quot;) continued working in the upholstery business repairing uniforms and making tents, blankets, and stuffed paper tube cartridges with musket balls for prepared packaged ammunition in 1779 for the Continental Army.

There is speculation that Ross was the &quot;beautiful young widow&quot; who distracted Carl von Donop in Mount Holly, New Jersey, after the Battle of Iron Works Hill, thus keeping his forces out of the crucial &quot;turning-of-the-tide&quot; Battle of Trenton on the morning of December 26, 1776, in which Hessian soldiers were defeated after the crossing of the Delaware River.

On June 15, 1777, she married her second husband, mariner Joseph Ashburn. In 1780, Ashburn&#x27;s ship was captured by a Royal Navy frigate and he was charged with treason (for being of British ancestry—naturalization to American colonial citizenship was not recognized) and imprisoned at Old Mill Prison in Plymouth, England. During this time, their first daughter, Zilla, died at the age of nine months and their second daughter, Eliza, was born. Ashburn died in the British jail.

Three years later, in May 1783, she married John Claypoole, who had earlier met Joseph Ashburn in the English Old Mill Prison and had informed Ross of her husband&#x27;s circumstances and death. John Claypoole&#x27;s diary and family Bible was rediscovered 240 years later in June 2020.

The couple had five daughters: Clarissa, Susanna, Jane, Rachel, and Harriet (who died in infancy). With the birth of their second daughter Susanna in 1786, they moved to a larger house on Philadelphia&#x27;s Second Street, settling down to a peaceful post-war existence, as Philadelphia prospered as the temporary national capital (1790–1800) of the newly independent United States of America, with the first president, George Washington, his vice president, John Adams, and the convening members of the new federal government and the U.S. Congress.

In 1793, her mother, father, and sister Deborah Griscom Bolton (1743–1793) all died in another severe epidemic of yellow fever, a disease found in the 19th century to be spread by infected mosquitoes. After two decades of poor health, John Claypoole died in 1817. Ross continued the upholstery business for 10 more years. Upon retirement, she moved in with her daughter Susanna Claypoole (1786–1875), in a section of Abington Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, while Susanna&#x27;s older sister Clarissa (1785–1864) took over their mother&#x27;s business back in the city.

==Death and burials==

Ross, by then completely blind, spent her last three years living with her middle Claypoole daughter Jane (1792–1873) in Philadelphia, which was rapidly growing and industrializing. On Saturday, January 30, 1836, 60 years after the Declaration of Independence, Betsy Ross died at age 84. She was survived by one daughter with John Ashburn, Eliza, and four daughters with John Claypoole: Clarissa, Susanna, Jane, and Rachel, and one sister, Hannah Griscom Levering (1755–1836), who herself died about 11 months later.

The so-called Betsy Ross House is a popular tourist site in Philadelphia, but it is still a matter of historical academic dispute whether she actually lived there, as evidence indicates she actually lived from 1776 to 1779 in a house next door that was torn down after the remaining house was designated.

Ross&#x27; body was first interred at the Free Quaker burial grounds on North Fifth Street in Philadelphia. In 1856, the remains of Ross and her third husband John Claypoole were moved from the Free Quaker Burying Ground to Mount Moriah Cemetery. The practice of cemeteries purchasing the remains of famous historical individuals was common in order to drive additional business. The Daughters of the American Revolution erected a flagpole at the site of her grave in her memory.

In 1975, in preparation for the American Bicentennial, city leaders ordered the remains moved to the courtyard of the Betsy Ross House. However, cemetery workers found no remains beneath her tombstone. Bones found elsewhere in the family plot were deemed to be hers and were reinterred in the current grave visited by tourists at the Betsy Ross House.

==Legacy==
The Betsy Ross Bridge, connecting Philadelphia with Pennsauken Township, New Jersey, across the Delaware River is named in her honor.

Biographer Marla Miller argues that Ross&#x27; legacy should not be about a single flag, but rather what her story tells us about working women and men during the American Revolution.

Betsy Ross School in Mahwah, New Jersey is named for her.

===Betsy Ross postage stamp===

On January 1, 1952, the U.S. Post Office issued a commemorative postage stamp to honor the 200th anniversary of her birth. It shows her presenting the new 13-striped, 13-starred flag to George Washington, with Robert Morris, and George Ross present. The design was taken from a painting by Charles H. Weisberger, one of the founders and first custodian of the Memorial Association, who has cared for and operated the Ross House. This was issued when the Ross legend was still strong and accepted by many of the American public and before additional historical and academic scrutiny.

<doc id="504223" wikidata="Q2554325" url="?curid=504223" title="Lemmatization">
<text>Lemmatization (or less commonly lemmatisation) in linguistics is the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analysed as a single item, identified by the word&#x27;s lemma, or dictionary form.

In computational linguistics, lemmatization is the algorithmic process of determining the lemma of a word based on its intended meaning. Unlike stemming, lemmatization depends on correctly identifying the intended part of speech and meaning of a word in a sentence, as well as within the larger context surrounding that sentence, such as neighbouring sentences or even an entire document. As a result, developing efficient lemmatization algorithms is an open area of research.

==Description==
In many languages, words appear in several &quot;inflected&quot; forms. For example, in English, the verb &#x27;to walk&#x27; may appear as &#x27;walk&#x27;, &#x27;walked&#x27;, &#x27;walks&#x27; or &#x27;walking&#x27;. The base form, &#x27;walk&#x27;, that one might look up in a dictionary, is called the &quot;lemma&quot; for the word. The association of the base form with a part of speech is often called a &quot;lexeme&quot; of the word.

Lemmatization is closely related to stemming. The difference is that a stemmer operates on a single word &quot;without&quot; knowledge of the context, and therefore cannot discriminate between words which have different meanings depending on part of speech. However, stemmers are typically easier to implement and run faster. The reduced &quot;accuracy&quot; may not matter for some applications. In fact, when used within information retrieval systems, stemming improves query recall accuracy, or true positive rate, when compared to lemmatization. Nonetheless, stemming reduces precision, or the proportion of positively-labeled instances that are actually positive, for such systems.

For instance:
#The word &quot;better&quot; has &quot;good&quot; as its lemma. This link is missed by stemming, as it requires a dictionary look-up.
#The word &quot;walk&quot; is the base form for the word &quot;walking&quot;, and hence this is matched in both stemming and lemmatization.
#The word &quot;meeting&quot; can be either the base form of a noun or a form of a verb (&quot;to meet&quot;) depending on the context; e.g., &quot;in our last meeting&quot; or &quot;We are meeting again tomorrow&quot;. Unlike stemming, lemmatization attempts to select the correct lemma depending on the context.

Document indexing software like Lucene can store the base stemmed format of the word without the knowledge of meaning, but only considering word formation grammar rules. The stemmed word itself might not be a valid word: &#x27;lazy&#x27;, as seen in the example below, is stemmed by many stemmers to &#x27;lazi&#x27;. This is because the purpose of stemming is not to produce the appropriate lemma – that is a more challenging task that requires knowledge of context. The main purpose of stemming is to map different forms of a word to a single form. As a rule-based algorithm, dependent only upon the spelling of a word, it sacrifices accuracy to ensure that, for example, when &#x27;laziness&#x27; is stemmed to &#x27;lazi&#x27;, it has the same stem as &#x27;lazy&#x27;.

==Algorithms==
A trivial way to do lemmatization is by simple dictionary lookup. This works well for straightforward inflected forms, but a rule-based system will be needed for other cases, such as in languages with long compound words. Such rules can be either hand-crafted or learned automatically from an annotated corpus.

==Use in biomedicine==
Morphological analysis of published biomedical literature can yield useful results. Morphological processing of biomedical text can be more effective by a specialized lemmatization program for biomedicine, and may improve the accuracy of practical information extraction tasks.

<doc id="504225" wikidata="Q499047" url="?curid=504225" title="Sado, Niigata">
<text>is a city located on in Niigata Prefecture, Japan. Since 2004, the city has comprised the entire island, although not all of its total area is urbanized. Sado is the sixth largest island of Japan in area following the four main islands and Okinawa Island (excluding the Northern Territories). As of June 1, 2023, the city has an estimated population of 48,195 and a population density of . The total area is .

==History==
===Political formation of the island===

The large number of pottery artifacts found near Ogi in the South of the island demonstrate that Sado was populated as early as the Jōmon period.

The &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; mentions that Mishihase people visited the island in 544 (although it is unknown whether Tungusic people effectively came).

The island formed a distinct province, the Sado Province, separate from the Echigo province on Honshū, at the beginning of the 8th century. At first, the province was a single &quot;gun&quot; (district), but was later divided into three &quot;gun&quot;: Sawata, Hamochi and Kamo.

In 1185, the designated representative Shugo for Sado, Osaragi, appointed Honma Yoshihisa as his shugodai (delegate) for the province.

The rule of the Honma clan on Sado lasted until Uesugi Kagekatsu took control of the island in 1589. After the defeat of the Uesugi at Sekigahara, and the discovery of gold on the island, the shogunate took direct control of the island.

The island was for a short time an independent prefecture, called the Aikawa prefecture, between 1871 and 1876, during the Meiji era. It then became a part of Niigata Prefecture, which it is still as of today.

At the end of the 19th century, there were three districts (), seven towns (), and 51 villages (). During the 20th century, a series of mergers steadily reduced the number of political local authorities, following the recent trend in Japan to cut the costs of having separately run local administrations. The current city () covering the whole island was established on March 1, 2004 from a merger of all remaining municipalities on the island: the city of Ryōtsu: the towns of Aikawa, Kanai, Sawata, Hatano, Mano, Hamochi and Ogi; and the villages of Niibo, and Akadomari (all from Sado District).

===Exile in Sado===

When direct control from mainland Japan started around the 8th century, the island&#x27;s remoteness meant that it soon became a place of banishment for difficult or inconvenient Japanese figures. Exile to remote locations such as Sado was a very serious punishment, second only to the death penalty, and people were not expected to return.

The earliest known dissident to be condemned to exile on Sadogashima was a poet, . He was sent to the island in 722, reportedly for having criticized the emperor.

The former Emperor Juntoku was sent to Sado after his role in the Jōkyū War of 1221. The disgraced emperor survived twenty years on the island before his death; and because he was sent to Sado, this emperor is known posthumously as . He is buried in the Mano Goryo mausoleum on the west coast.

The Buddhist monk Nichiren lived on Sado close to the present village Niibo in Kuninaka Plain from 1271 to 1274. In the 17th century, Konpon Ji Temple was built at the place where he lived. At the end of his exile, Nichiren lived at the place where Myosho Ji temple was built later. He used to meditate at the place where Jisso Ji Temple can be visited today. In addition, Nipponzan Myohoji, a modern Nichiren Buddhist order, established a Peace Pagoda in the city to help in inspiring people toward world peace.

The Noh dramatist Zeami Motokiyo was exiled on unspecified charges in 1434.

The last banishment in Sado took place in 1700, almost a millennium after the first.

===Gold mine===

Sado experienced a sudden economic boom during the Edo period when gold was found in 1601 at . A major source of revenue for the Tokugawa shogunate, the mines were worked in very severe conditions.

A manpower shortage led to a second wave of &quot;exiles&quot; coming to Sado, although this time it was not imposed as a sentence for a committed crime. By sending homeless people (the number of whom was growing in Japanese cities at the time) to Sado from the 18th century, the Shogunate hoped to kill two birds with one stone. The homeless were sent as water collectors and worked in extremely hard conditions, with a short life expectancy. The Sado mine at its peak in the Edo era produced around of gold a year (as well as some silver). The small settlement of Aikawa quickly reached a population of around 100,000. The mine closed in 1989.

===External influence on Sado culture===
In feudal Japan, when the Nishimawari naval route was opened in 1672, Ogi (in the South of the Island) became a main stop on this major naval route in the Sea of Japan between the Kansai area and northern areas of the archipelago.

Exiles and shipping in old times both had a major influence on Sado&#x27;s cultural background. The island is for instance dotted with Noh theaters, and the local Japanese dialect and accent are different from those of Niigata.

===Emergency landing on Sado===
A few months after World War II, on 18 January 1946, a Douglas Dakota (C-47) &quot;Sister Ann&quot; in British RAF service made an emergency landing on the island. The locals helped in the recovery and building a runway for it to depart, the story of which was made into a film named &quot;Tobe! Dakota&quot; (&quot;Fly, Dakota, Fly!&quot;) with the film&#x27;s Dakota made into an island exhibit. The story of the events leading up to the crash were also made into a film, &quot;The Night My Number Came Up&quot;.

==Geography==
The island consists of two parallel mountain ranges running roughly southwest–northeast, enclosing a central plain. The range, in the north, is slightly higher, with peaks of , the highest point of the island at , Mount Kongō, Mount Myōken, and Mount Donden. range in the south faces the Honshu coast. The highest point in Kosado is at 645 m.

The plain in between is called and is the most populated area. The Kuninaka plain opens on its eastern side onto , and on its western side onto , where the longest river, reaches the sea.

The island has a symmetrical shape. , on the eastern side of Kuninaka, is filled with salt water, and is a growing place for oysters.

===Climate===
Sado has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;) with potentially hot, humid summers and cold winters. Precipitation is quite heavy throughout the year.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Sado peaked around 1950 and has declined by roughly 60 percent in the decades since.
==Today==

===Economy===

As of May 1, 2017, the island has an estimated population of 55,474. The island of Sado has seen a steady decline in population since 1950 when the population was 125,597. Similar trends have been common in other remote locations of Japan since World War II as younger generations have moved to more urban areas. As of October 1, 2008, 36.3% of the island population is over 65 years old, which is a larger ratio than the national average. Over 65 is the only increasing age demographic. The island is now less populated than it was in the 18th and 19th century. There is no university, and the options for post high school studies, short of leaving and going to the mainland, are limited to a few specialty schools.

Agriculture and fishing are major sources of income for Sado. According to the 2000 national census, 22.3% of the workforce was employed in the primary sector and 25% in the secondary sector. Fishing is mainly based in Ryotsu and Aikawa.

Tourism boomed in the beginning of the 1990s and peaked at over 1.2 million yearly visitors, but visitor numbers decreased over the 1990s. In the mid-2000s, the number of visitors was closer to 650,000 per year.

Sado is known for a number of Japanese bamboo weaving artists and artisans who are renowned throughout the country.

===Tourism===
Its rich history and relaxed rural atmosphere make Sado one of the major tourist destinations in Niigata Prefecture. The island has several temples and historical ruins, and offers possibilities for various outdoor activities, as well as fresh local food.

Sado is famous as the major breeding area for the Japanese crested ibis. The last known Japan-born Japanese crested ibis died in captivity in 2003 on the island. Currently, birds from China are being bred in a captive program in a facility in Niibo area, and have been released since 2008. The first hatchings in the wild were observed in April 2012. The ibis is a major symbol of the Island and can be found on several tourist items. As of June 2022, approximately 480 crested ibis have been observed making a radical comeback for their species, thanks to conservation efforts.

There are many small local traditional festivals, and since 1988 a major yearly arts festival, called the Earth Celebration, has been run by the taiko group Kodo. The group lives on the island, touring eight months a year, and in August they invite international artists to collaborate with them at their festival on Sado. Tickets are limited for the three-day weekend event. In recent years, Kodo has made a solo performance on the Friday evening; the festival&#x27;s invited act plays Saturday night; and Sunday concludes with a joint performance with Kodo and guests.

The Sado tourism industry suffered direct (though limited) as well as indirect damage from the 2004 Chūetsu earthquake, as access routes inside Niigata Prefecture were cut.

==== Sights ====
Sado has a large variety of sights to offer.
* Myōsen-ji is a temple with a five-storied pagoda a few kilometers east of Mano. The pagoda was built by two generations of carpenters and took 30 years to complete in 1825.
* Konpon-ji Temple in the village of Niibo in the middle of the island was built in the 17th century at the very place where Nichiren lived at first during his exile on Sadogashima.
* Rengebuji Temple near Ogi, housing several buildings classified as important cultural properties. 
* For two years, Nichiren lived at the place where Myōshō-ji Temple can be visited today. The temple which has a beautiful garden is northeast of the town of Sawata. Jisso-ji Temple which is visited by many pilgrims is close by. It was built at a place where Nichiren used to meditate. The pine tree where he used to hang his clothes can still be seen today. A tall Nichiren Memorial was erected close to the temple.
* The Art and Natural History Museum of Sado is on the west coast between Sawata and Mano. Some reconstructed pile houses can be seen in its garden. Originally, the inhabitants of Sado lived in pile houses.
* A traditional wooden Noh Theatre which was built in the 19th century can be visited near Daizen Shrine in the east of Mano.
* Shukunegi is a historically preserved ward which has existed since the Edo Era as a Sado port town. The streets brimming over with atmosphere and built by shipwrights are splendid.

==Transportation==

===Ship===
Sado Steam Ship operates two routes connecting to the mainland.
* Joetsu – Ogi (Jetfoil, only from spring to autumn)
* Niigata – Ryotsu (Ferry and jetfoil)

===Bus===

Transit bus network all over the island is operated by Niigata Kotsu Kanko Bus.

===Air===
Kyokushin Airways, operating the route to Niigata, ceased its operations in September 2008. New Japan Aviation operated three or four flights daily to Sado Airport, but service to the airport was suspended indefinitely in April 2014.

<doc id="504230" wikidata="Q875016" url="?curid=504230" title="Terraced house">
<text>A terrace, terraced house (UK), or [[townhouse]] (US) is a type of medium-density housing which first started in 16th century Europe with a row of joined houses sharing side walls. In the United States and Canada these are sometimes known as row houses or row homes.

Terrace housing can be found worldwide, though it is quite common in Europe and Latin America, and many examples can be found in the United Kingdom, Belgium, United States, Canada, and Australia. The Place des Vosges in Paris (1605–1612) is one of the early examples of the type. 

Although in early larger forms it was and still is used for housing the wealthy, as cities and the demands for ever smaller close housing grew, it regularly became associated with the working class. Terraced housing has increasingly become associated with gentrification in certain inner-city areas, drawing the attention of city planning.

==Origins and nomenclature==
Though earlier Gothic examples, such as Vicars&#x27; Close, Wells, are known, the alignment of the house fronts with the property line really began in the 16th century following Dutch and Belgian models and became called &quot;row&quot; houses in English. For example, in &quot;Yarmouth Rows&quot;, Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, the building fronts all were right on the property line.

The term &quot;terrace&quot; was borrowed from garden terraces by British architects of the late Georgian period to describe streets of houses whose uniform fronts and uniform height created a stylish ensemble rather than a mere &quot;row&quot; of similar homes. Townhouses (or townhomes) are generally two- to three-story structures that share a wall with a neighbouring unit. As opposed to apartment buildings, townhouses do not have neighbouring units above or below them. They are similar in concept to row houses or terraced houses, but share a common design and construction. The first and last of the houses is called an &quot;end terrace&quot; and is often a different layout from the houses in the middle, sometimes called mid-terrace.

==Australia==


In Australia, the term &quot;terrace house&quot; refers almost exclusively to Victorian and Edwardian era terraces or replicas almost always found in the older, inner city areas of the major cities. Terraced housing was introduced to Australia from Britain in the nineteenth century, basing their architecture on those in the UK, France and Italy.

Large numbers of terraced houses were built in the inner suburbs of large Australian cities, particularly Sydney and Melbourne, mainly between the 1850s and the 1890s (terraced housing is rare outside of these cities). Detached housing became the popular style of housing in Australia following Federation in 1901. The most common building material used was brick, often covered with cement render and then painted.

Many terraces were built in the &quot;filigree&quot; style, a style distinguished through heavy use of cast iron ornament, particularly on the balconies and sometimes depicting native Australian flora. In the 1950s, many urban renewal programmes were aimed at eradicating them entirely in favour of modern development.

In recent decades these inner-city areas and their terraced houses have been gentrified. The suburbs in which terrace houses are often found are often sought after in Australia due to their proximity to the Central Business Districts of the major cities. They are therefore sometimes quite expensive even though they may not be the preferred accommodation style. The lack of windows on the side, the small gardens, and the relative darkness of the rooms is at odds with the design favoured for modern Australian homes.

==Europe==
=== Belgium ===
In Belgium, the row houses are the predominant type of housing around the country and closely associated with the Belgian culture and history. The Grand Place, the central historic place of the capital Brussels, is surrounded by private houses dating from the 17th century, reflecting the city as a mercantile power at that time in northern Europe. Later, in the 19th century, Belgium played an important role in the early history of industrial revolution like the United Kingdom, where an important amount of working class housing was built to accommodate the coal miners in small brick row houses usually called &quot;Coron&quot;. These types of constructions are very common in the Walloon region, but also in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region of France. Within the same period (from 1850 to early 1900), major cities like Brussels or Antwerp faced important urban development with the construction of new neighborhoods as extensions of the cities often entirely around individually owned parcels where single family row houses were built and occupied by both the middle class and the bourgeois class. Some houses are internationally renowned for their architecture like the Art Nouveau style Hotel Tassel or the Hôtel van Eetvelde both designed by Victor Horta.

===Finland===
In Finland, an agrarian country where urbanism was a generally late phenomenon, the &quot;rivitalo&quot; (literally: row house) has not been seen as a particularly urban house type. What is regarded as the first terraced house to be built, Ribbingshof (1916), in the new Helsinki suburb of Kulosaari was designed by renowned architect Armas Lindgren, and was inspired by ideas from the English Garden City movement and Hampstead Garden Suburb, and was seen as a relatively low density residential area. A similarly leafy suburban street of terraced houses was that of Hollantilaisentie (1920) in the suburb of Munkkiniemi, Helsinki, designed by architect Eliel Saarinen. They were initially envisioned as workers&#x27; housing, as part of a grand new urban scheme for the entirety of north-west Helsinki, but from the outset became a fashionable middle-class residential area. Later terraced housing in Finland is similarly associated with suburban middle-class living, such as the Tapiola garden city, Espoo, from the 1950s.

===France===
Terraced housing has long been a popular form in Paris, France. The Place des Vosges (1605–1612) was one of the earliest examples of the arrangement. In Parisian squares, central blocks were given discreet prominence, to relieve the façade. Terraced building including housing was also used primarily during Haussmann&#x27;s renovation of Paris between 1852 and 1870 creating whole streetscapes consisting of terraced rows.

===United Kingdom and Ireland===

The first streets of houses with uniform fronts were built by the Huguenot entrepreneur Nicholas Barbon in the rebuilding after the Great Fire of London. Fashionable terraces appeared in London&#x27;s Grosvenor Square from 1727 onwards and in Bath&#x27;s Queen Square from 1729 onwards. The Scottish architect Robert Adam is credited with the development of the house itself. Early terraces were also built by the two John Woods in Bath and under the direction of John Nash in Regent&#x27;s Park, London. The term was picked up by speculative builders like Thomas Cubitt and soon became commonplace.

It is far from being the case that terraced houses were only built for people of limited means. This is especially true in London, where some of the wealthiest people in the country owned them in locations such as Belgrave Square and Carlton House Terrace. These townhouses, in the British sense, were the London residences of noble and gentry families who spent most of the year in their country houses. These terraced houses, often surrounding a garden square, are hallmarks of Georgian architecture. The same was true of many British and Irish cities. In Dublin, Georgian squares such as Merrion Square and Fitzwilliam Square housed the city&#x27;s upper classes. A type of terraced house known latterly as the &quot;one-floor-over-basement&quot; was a style of terraced house particular to the Irish capital. They were built in the Victorian era for the city&#x27;s lower middle class and emulated upper class townhouses.

By the early Victorian period, a &quot;terrace&quot; had come to designate any style of housing where individual houses repeating one design are joined into rows. The style was used for workers&#x27; housing in industrial districts during the rapid urbanisation following the Industrial Revolution, particularly in the houses built for workers of the expanding textile industry. The terrace style spread widely across the country, and was the usual form of high-density residential housing up to World War II. The 19th century need for expressive individuality inspired variation of façade details and floor-plans reversed with those of each neighbouring pair, to offer variety within the standardised format.

A major distinction is between &quot;through terraces&quot;, whose houses have both a front and a back door, and &quot;back-to-backs&quot;, which are bricked in on three sides. The 1875 Public Health Act imposed a duty on local authorities to regulate housing by the use of byelaws, and subsequently all byelaw terraced housing was required to have its own privy, with rear access to allow the night soil to be collected as per the Rochdale system. As recently as 2011, byelaw terraced houses made up over 15% of the United Kingdom&#x27;s housing stock.

Since the Second World War, housing redevelopment has led to many outdated or dilapidated terraces being cleared to make room for tower blocks, which occupy a much smaller area of land. Because of this land use in the inner city areas could in theory have been used to create greater accessibility, employment or recreational or leisure centres. However, sub-optimal or flawed implementation has meant that in many areas (like Manchester or the London estates) the tower blocks offered no real improvement for rehoused residents over their prior terraced houses.
In 2005 the English Heritage report &quot;Low Demand Housing and the Historic Environment&quot; found that repairing a standard Victorian terraced house over 30 years is around 60% cheaper than building and maintaining a newly built house. In a 2003 survey for &quot;Heritage Counts&quot; a team of experts contrasted a Victorian terrace with a house built after 1980, and found that:The research demonstrated that, contrary to earlier thinking, older housing actually costs less to maintain and occupy over the long-term life of the dwelling than more modern housing. Largely due to the quality and life-span of the materials used, the Victorian terraced house proved almost £1,000 per 100 m2 cheaper to maintain and inhabit on average each year.

==North America==

===Canada===

====Halifax====

Halifax&#x27;s use of rowhouses, townhouses and terraced housing has been consistent throughout its history, particularly on the Peninsula where the city first began settlement. In the older sections of the city are sections of terraced housing used historically for military families, as part of established families&#x27; real estate holdings in addition to a country house, and as dwellings for the working classes of the city and as public housing. The most well-known of the terraced housing areas is The Hydrostone, which was originally built as replacement housing stock for those made homeless after the Halifax Explosion; individual owners have, however, altered the exteriors of many of the rowhouses over time to accommodate changing family needs. More recently, there have been rowhouse developments appearing in diverse areas throughout the city.

====Montreal====
Montreal has the largest stock of terraced houses in Canada and they are typical in all areas of the city. As is common in other North American cities, in Montreal row houses are often referred to as townhouses.

The streetscape of the city&#x27;s 19th century neighbourhoods, such as the Plateau, Centre-Sud, and Hochelaga, are dominated by row houses, duplexes and triplexes. Row houses continued to be built throughout the 20th century. In many neighbourhoods, such as Villeray, Parc Extension, and Ville-Émard, they became the dominant form of housing during the post-war period.

In the 21st century, Montreal has continued to build row houses at a high rate, with 62% of housing starts in the metropolitan area being apartment or row units. Apartment complexes, high-rises, and semi-detached homes are less popular in Montreal when compared to large Canadian cities like Toronto or Vancouver but similar to some US cities, in particular Philadelphia. Montreal&#x27;s characteristic row houses and their iconic alleyways, balconies, and outdoor staircases have become cultural symbols of the city, featured in David Fennario&#x27;s Balconville and Mordecai Richler&#x27;s The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz.

====Toronto====
Terraced homes are abundant in Old Toronto. Many of them are constructed in the local bay-and-gable style, popular in the 1870s. Examples of Victorian bay-and-gable style can be found in Cabbagetown, Toronto, Parkdale, The Annex, Kensington Market, areas east of Chinatown, Toronto and Spadina Avenue including Baldwin Village. 

The last surviving row of Georgian-style terraced houses in Toronto, known as Walnut Hall, was demolished in 2007 as a result of structural decay.

===United States===

According to the US Census Bureau, the highest concentration of terraced houses in the United States is in the Mid-Atlantic region, particularly the Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington metropolitan areas. The first terraced houses in the nation were Carstairs Row in Philadelphia, designed by builder and architect Thomas Carstairs through 1820, for developer William Sansom, as part of the first speculative housing developments in the United States. Carstairs Row was built on the southern part of the site occupied by &quot;Morris&#x27;s Folly&quot; – Robert Morris&#x27;s unfinished mansion designed by L&#x27;Enfant. Prior to this time houses had been built not in rows, but individually. It can be contrasted with Elfreth&#x27;s Alley, the oldest continuously occupied road in the U.S., where all the houses are of varying heights and widths, with different street lines, doorways and brickwork.

Terraced housing in the United States is generally referred to as &quot;townhouses&quot;. In some cities such as New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., and San Francisco, where they have been part of the landscape for over a century, they are often called row houses or row homes. Despite the narrow lots, many row houses are relatively large, some being over 2,000 square feet. They typically have two stories, but may have three or more (with the latter often being converted into apartments for separate tenants). The term &quot;townhouse&quot; in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic usually refers to modern terraced houses constructed in the late 20th century and beyond, especially those in suburban settings, which often have home owners associations and include garages. Multi-story attached homes that are grouped in twos or threes are typically called duplexes (or twins) and triplexes respectively.

====Baltimore====

Most of Baltimore&#x27;s housing consists of row houses. A few of Baltimore&#x27;s row houses date back to colonial times. The style and materials used in their constructions vary throughout the city. A sizable quantity of Baltimore&#x27;s row houses are clad with formstone, a distinct feature of Baltimore&#x27;s row houses, typically found in working class areas of the city. Marble front steps also make Baltimore&#x27;s row houses distinct from other cities&#x27; row houses. Much like Philadelphia, some areas of the city that contain row houses are neglected.

====Boston====

The row houses of Boston are found primarily in the Back Bay, Beacon Hill, and the South End. Back Bay is famous for its rows of Victorian brick townhouse homes – considered one of the best-preserved examples of 19th-century urban design in the United States. Beacon Hill is a neighborhood in Boston consisting of Federal-style rowhouses. The South End is built mostly of mid-nineteenth century bowfronts – aesthetically uniform rows of five-story, predominantly red-brick structures, of mixed residential and commercial uses.

====Chicago====

In Chicago, row houses can be found in the downtown and surrounding areas developed in the late 1800s through 1930s. Many are two and three-flat buildings (consisting of one or sometimes two apartments on a three-floored building). A greystone in Chicago is similar to the brownstone found in New York and Boston, except the façade is clad in Indiana limestone. Most row houses are separated by a gangway that leads under the common wall between the houses leading to the rear of the property (where sometimes a rear house or coach house exists) and alleyway. The vast majority of two and three flats do not share a common wall and are stand alone structures. However, many row houses similar to those found in Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. do exist, largely on the near south and west sides, though not as common.

====Savannah====
Gordon Row, in Savannah, was built in the 1850s. It (and its individual carriage houses to the rear) is a contributing property of the Savannah Historic District, itself on the National Register of Historic Places, and fills an entire city block. After falling into disrepair, the buildings were renovated in the mid-20th century by the Historic Savannah Foundation. Other similar-style row houses exist in Savannah&#x27;s Scudder&#x27;s Row, William Remshart Row House, the Quantock Rows on Taylor Street and Jones Street, McDonough Row and Marshall Row.

====New Orleans====
New Orleans has a distinctive style of terrace house in the French Quarter known as the Creole townhouse that is part of what makes the city famous. The façade of the building sits on the property line, with an asymmetrical arrangement of arched openings. Creole Townhouses have a steeply pitched roof, side-gabled, with several roof dormers. The exterior is made of brick or stucco.

====New York====
The row houses of New York City are built with a variety of material, including brownstone, limestone, and brick, and some are wood-frame homes. Row houses are especially prominent in neighborhoods like Middle Village, Woodhaven and Jackson Heights in Queens; Bay Ridge, Bensonhurst, Brooklyn Heights, Bushwick, Canarsie, Marine Park, Park Slope, and Sunset Park in Brooklyn; and Williamsbridge, Wakefield, and Soundview in the Bronx.

====Philadelphia====
In historic Philadelphia, the rowhouse (almost always spelled as one word) has been the most common domestic building type in the city and some of its suburbs since colonial times. Some of the oldest rowhouses in the city are narrow three-story &quot;Trinity&quot; houses that accommodated a large population of indentured servants and immigrant workers, in addition to enclaves of free African-Americans in the 19th century. Society Hill is known to have the largest concentration of original 18th- and early 19th-century residential architecture of any place in the United States. The style and type of material used in constructing Philadelphia&#x27;s rowhouses vary throughout the city. Even in neighborhoods where twin houses are found, their façades and internal layouts usually resemble those of rowhouses.

Most are primarily red brick in construction, often with white stone trim. Some are faced with stone, being brownstone on some blocks in Center City, South Philadelphia, and North Philadelphia and being Wissahickon schist in Mayfair in Northeast Philadelphia and Mt. Airy in Northwest Philadelphia. West Philadelphia has many colorful rowhouses in the Italianate and Queen Anne architectural styles. As rowhouses are very common, the Philadelphia City Planning Commission (PCPC) publishes a specific guide for rowhouse home owners in an effort to detail some of the ways to maintain their properties.

With space within the city&#x27;s borders at a premium, there has been a push to add a third floor to an existing rowhouse&#x27;s in recent times, often this third level would include a rooftop deck. While zoning codes do exist which can possibly prevent third stories from being added to homes, Philly Mag claims &quot;The city’s 2012 zoning code overhaul, which increased the height limit for rowhouses from 35 to 38 feet, has made this option increasingly prevalent.&quot;

====San Francisco====

San Francisco is also known for its terraced houses in the older neighborhoods of North Beach, the Castro, the Haight-Ashbury, Russian Hill, the Mission District, Duboce Triangle and the Western Addition. The &quot;Painted Ladies&quot; on Steiner Street, in the Western Addition&#x27;s Alamo Square district, although not true &quot;terraced&quot;, are a symbol of the city. Some ornate, intricately-detailed Victorian-style homes labelled as &quot;painted ladies&quot; around the city are terraced, but most again are semi-detached and not true &quot;terraced&quot;.

==== Washington, D.C. ====

Several neighborhoods in Washington, D.C. feature rowhouses, often composing the majority or a large plurality of the local housing stock. As in other American cities, rowhouses in D.C. span a wide range of architectural styles and building materials. Neighborhoods known for high concentrations of rowhouses include Capitol Hill, Dupont Circle, Logan Circle, Shaw, LeDroit Park, Columbia Heights, Petworth, and Bloomingdale. Many neighborhoods with rowhouses are located in the city&#x27;s Northwest quadrant, in the densely populated area east of Rock Creek Park, except for Capitol Hill and its sub-neighborhoods, which occupy the areas of the Northeast and Southeast quadrants directly east of the United States Capitol Building. Because many D.C. rowhouses are historic structures, dating back as far as the early 1800s, they are especially common within the city&#x27;s original boundaries, as laid out in the 1791 L&#x27;Enfant Plan. Outside of Washington DC many townhomes have been built in the last 50 years to encourage density especially around Metro stations and other areas of interest.

====Other cities====

In other cities throughout the United States, such as Albany, New York; Cincinnati; Cleveland; Covington, Kentucky; Detroit; Hoboken, New Jersey; Jersey City; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Norfolk; Pittsburgh; Reading, Pennsylvania; Richmond; Troy; and Wilmington, Delaware, row houses and terraced housing are also common, with row housing more focused on the center of the city, and later changing over to dense detached housing in outer neighborhoods. Scattered row homes and apartment rows can often be found in other eastern and Midwestern U.S. cities, specifically Minneapolis and St. Paul. The F. Scott Fitzgerald House in St. Paul is likely the most notable example of a row home in the Twin Cities. Columbus, Ohio has scattered row homes, along with smaller Midwest cities like Dubuque, Duluth, and Toledo. There are also scattered row homes and apartment rows in the oldest neighborhoods of Denver, Colorado.

== South America ==

=== Uruguay and Argentina ===

Montevideo and Buenos Aires during the last decades of the 19th century developed a type of terraced house called the &quot;Standard House&quot; or informally &quot;&#x27;Chorizo&#x27; House.&quot;

== Southeast Asia==
Introduced around the beginning of the twentieth century, terraced houses (also known as shophouses or linear linkhouses) have been adopted in both Malaysia and Singapore since the countries&#x27; early British colonial rule.

Based on British terraced home designs, the Southeast Asian variations are similar to their British counterparts (in which the living quarters are located on the front and top floor and the kitchen at the back) and were adapted to accommodate the area&#x27;s tropical weather, which is primarily warm throughout the year and receives heavy rainfall. Earlier versions were more open, designed to better circulate air and features inner courtyards, with a frontal yard, rear yard, or both. A typical Malaysian and Singaporean terraced house is usually one or two floors high, but a handful of three or four storey terraced homes exist, especially newer terraced houses. Earlier variations followed traditional Western, Malay, India and Chinese architecture, as well as Art Deco and International stylings between the 1930s and 1950s.

The manner in which the buildings were designed varies by their location in an urban area. Derivatives located within city centres may also utilize their space for both commercial on the ground floor and residential use on the first floor and above (accurately known as shophouses, also similar to Lingnan buildings). Inner city terrace house design tended to lack any frontal yard at all, with narrow street frontages, hence the building&#x27;s structure directly erected in front of the road. One of the reasons behind this was the taxing according to street frontage rather than total area, thereby creating an economic motivation to build narrow and deeply. A five foot way porch was usually laid out at the ground floor for use by both the residents and pedestrians. Alternatively, the porch may be sealed from the rest of the walkway to serve as personal space. Such designs became less common after the 1960s.

Terrace houses located on the outskirts of city centres were less restrictive, although the design of the building itself was not unlike those in the city. Certain homes tend to feature longer front yards, enough to accommodate cars. Others strictly serve as a small garden. This design remained in demand throughout the twentieth century, and a construction boom of the house design occurred in Malaysia since the 1940s, with numerous housing estates consisting of terrace homes sprouting in and around cities and towns. In the process, the design of the building began to diversify, with various refinements and style changes. Generally, the building&#x27;s floor space and yards become larger and more elaborate through time, as is the modernisation of exterior construction and façade.

Certain older terrace houses tend to be converted for various new roles; some are converted into shophouses or business premises (including clubs, hotels and boarding homes–especially pre-independence houses–and kindergartens). Others have remained in use as residential units, are abandoned, neglected, or razed. Significant expansions are also common on all terrace homes; roofs and additional rooms may be added within the floorspace of the house&#x27;s lot. Concerns are also raised with the limited maintenance and monitoring of deserted terrace homes, which potentially become hiding places for rodents and snakes (in yards with overgrown grass), and drug addicts.

Earlier variations of the terrace house were constructed with wood, later replaced with a masonry shell holding wooden beams to form foundations for the upper floors and tiled roof. Contemporary variations are primarily held together with reinforced concrete beams, which are later completed with concrete slabs, brick walls and tiled roofs.
