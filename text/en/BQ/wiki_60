<text>A tart card is a card which advertises the services of a prostitute. The cards are found in many countries, usually in capital cities or red-light districts. Originating in the 1960s, the cards are placed in locations such as newsagents&#x27; windows or telephone boxes. Alternatively they are handed out or dropped in the street. Legal action is sometimes taken against their use. Illustrated tart cards from the 1980s and 1990s have come to be regarded as examples of sub-cultural accidental art.

==History==
In England and Wales the Sexual Offences Act 1956 made soliciting for street prostitution illegal. As a result, indoor sex work became more common and sex workers began to advertise their services and telephone numbers on small, cheaply produced cards in the windows of newsagents. Known as tart cards, they became established in the 1960s in places such as Soho, London, where they were typically handwritten postcards which were displayed outside prostitutes&#x27; flats or in the windows of newsagents or shops. As direct references to prostitution would generally be unacceptable, the cards were carefully worded and often contained euphemistic references to sex, with terms such as &quot;large chest for sale&quot;.

The abolition of the 1953 Post Office Act in 1984 inadvertently legalised the placement of advertisements in telephone boxes, and they became the main location for tart cards, particularly in London. By the late 1980s the cards had become black-and-white photocopied cards containing printed text and telephone numbers. The cards from the 1980s and 1990s often included black-and-white drawings printed on neon-coloured card along with tongue-in-cheek phrases. In larger cities, the cards were placed in phone boxes. The style of illustration changed in the early twenty-first century, when tart cards began to appear with full-colour nude photographs, mobile telephone numbers and websites.

The cards from the 1980s and 1990s have become a memorable part of London counter-culture from that era. Over time they have become regarded as items of &quot;accidental art&quot; and developed a cult following. They have influenced the work of mainstream artists, inspiring collections, research, exhibitions and books such as the 2003 publication &quot;Tart Cards: London’s Illicit Advertising Art&quot;. Subsequently, they have been recognised as a sociological record of trends related to sex work, advertising, design and print. The Wellcome Collection in London contains thousands of examples, just over half of which advertise BDSM services.

== Tart cards by country ==


* Argentina: They are found in Buenos Aires.
* Brazil: They are found in São Paulo.
* China: They are commonly put under the doors of hotels during the day after the cleaning staff have finished in the rooms.
* Dubai: Cards advertising &quot;massage&quot; services, often printed with images of women, are delivered to people&#x27;s homes, placed onto car windows, and distributed by hand in the street. This practice is illegal.
* Japan: In Japan they were known as &quot;pink flyers&quot; (ピンクチラシ).
* Macau: They are dropped in the city&#x27;s sidewalks and underpasses.
* United Kingdom: in London tart cards are placed in phone boxes by professional &quot;carders&quot;, who tour the phone boxes, replacing cards which have been removed by the telephone companies&#x27; cleaners. Carders often remove cards placed by rival carders. Placing tart cards in phone boxes was made illegal by the passing of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 which made carding punishable by up to six months imprisonment or a fine of up to £5000. By 2002 most convicted carders were receiving fines of £200–£1000, although persistent offenders were receiving jail terms of 28 days. An estimated 13 million tart cards per year were being distributed across Britain at that time; the telephone company British Telecom was removing 150,000 tart cards per week from central London telephone boxes and it had call-barred 500 of the telephone numbers used on tart cards. However, despite police operations against carders the practice of carding still continues.
* United States: In hispanophone parts of New York City they are known as &quot;Chica Chica&quot; (Girl Girl) cards and men hand them out as flyers at night on the streets. In Las Vegas they are known as &quot;sex cards&quot; and left on sidewalks and hotel stairways or handed out as flyers.

<text>Agnieszka Holland (; born 28 November 1948) is a Polish film and television director and screenwriter, best known for her cultural and political contributions to Polish cinema. She began her career as an assistant to directors Krzysztof Zanussi and Andrzej Wajda, and emigrated to France shortly before the 1981 imposition of the martial law in Poland.

Holland is best known for her films &quot;Europa Europa&quot; (1990), for which she received a Golden Globe Award as well as an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay nomination, &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; (1993), &quot;Angry Harvest&quot; and the Holocaust drama &quot;In Darkness&quot;, the last two of which were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. In 2017, she received the Alfred Bauer Prize (Silver Bear) for her film &quot;Spoor&quot; at the Berlin International Film Festival. She is also a four-time winner of the Grand Prix at the Gdynia Film Festival. In 2020, she was elected President of the European Film Academy. In 2023, her film &quot;Green Border&quot; won the Special Jury Prize at the Venice International Film Festival.

In her films, Holland often focuses on the individual experiences of people who find themselves on the sidelines of political events. A recurring theme she explores is the critique of Nazi and communist crimes.

==Early life and education==
Holland was born in Warsaw, Poland, in 1948. She is the daughter of journalists Irena (née Rybczyńska) and Henryk Holland, who had been a prominent Communist activist since 1935 and a captain in the Soviet Army. Holland&#x27;s mother was Roman Catholic and her father Jewish, but she was not brought up in either faith. Her father, Henryk Holland, lost his parents in a ghetto during the Holocaust, and spent most of his adult life denying his own Jewishness. Holland&#x27;s father was an ardent Communist journalist whose publications against a number of prominent professors led to their dismissals by the Communist regime. Holland&#x27;s mother participated in the 1944 Warsaw Uprising as a member of the Polish resistance movement. Holland&#x27;s Catholic mother aided several Jews during the Holocaust and received the Righteous Among the Nations medal from the Yad Vashem Institute in Israel.

Holland was often ill as a child, and spent much time writing, drawing and directing short plays with other children. When she was eleven, her parents, whose marriage had been continuously contentious, divorced, and her mother soon remarried a Jewish journalist, Stanisław Brodski.

Holland describes her relationship with her father as influential, but very distant. According to her &quot;he was very interesting, very intelligent, and in the last years of his life he gave me a lot of doors to the art and the film. But he wasn&#x27;t really interested in the young children and he only noticed me when he wanted to make a kind of show&quot;. Holland recalls being shown off to her father&#x27;s friends during late-night gatherings, and then being ignored in the morning when he was no longer entertaining. When she was thirteen, her father died by suicide while under house arrest in Warsaw.

Holland attended the Stefan Batory Gymnasium and Lyceum in Warsaw. After high school, she studied at the Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague (FAMU) because, as she said in an interview, she thought the Czechoslovak films of the 1960s were very interesting: &quot;I watched first films of Miloš Forman, Ivan Passer, and Věra Chytilová. They seemed to be fantastically interesting to me, unlike what was being made in Poland at that time&quot;. At FAMU, she also met her future husband and fellow director, Laco Adamik.

Holland witnessed the Prague Spring of 1968 while in Czechoslovakia, and was arrested for her support of the dissident movement for the government reforms and political liberalization. She describes her time in Prague as her &quot;introduction to politics, violence, beauty, art, marriage, film and other arts...everything that happened to [her] after was based on this Czechoslovak experience&quot;. During her imprisonment she spent time in a cell between two inmates who had fallen in love. It became her job to pass erotic notes and messages between them. Holland herself said that &quot;it was like phone sex and I was the cable&quot;. During her time in Prague and in prison, she realized &quot;she&#x27;d rather be an artist than an agitator&quot;. Holland graduated from FAMU in 1971. She returned to Poland, and wrote her first screenplay. Though it was censored and prevented from being developed, it attracted the attention of Andrzej Wajda, who became her mentor. Her daughter with Adamik, Kasia (born 28 December 1972), is also a director.

The events and confusing identities that made up her childhood resulted in Holland being known to have a significant struggle with identity, which manifests itself in many of her most famous films, specifically those related to Polish-Jewish interactions during the Holocaust. According to Holland, the tense relationship between ethnic Jews and Poles is still an ongoing issue. She claims that &quot;Jews from Poland are still hostile to the Polish...There are things in Catholicism and Polish nationalism which are deeply anti-Semitic&quot;. Her film &quot;Europa, Europa&quot; brought her success and recognition in Hollywood, but she has always and still faces trouble in her career and life due to her past. Holland&#x27;s &quot;mixed Polish Catholic and Jewish ancestry...places her at the hub of this century&#x27;s violence&quot;. These conflicts and hardships have been the inspiration for films such as &quot;Europa, Europa&quot; and &quot;In Darkness&quot;.

==Career==

Holland began her career as an assistant director for Polish film directors Krzysztof Zanussi and Andrzej Wajda. Her credits include Zanussi&#x27;s 1973 film &quot;Iluminacja&quot; (&quot;Illumination&quot;), and Wajda&#x27;s 1983 film &quot;Danton&quot;. She was first assistant director on Wajda&#x27;s 1976 &quot;Man of Marble&quot;, an experience which gave her the capability to explore political and moral issues within the confines of an oppressive regime. Though she had a large role to play in the success of this film, her name was kept off of the credits because of censorship laws. In the first part of her career, owing to censorship by Communist authorities, Holland was unable to release any films under her own name. Wajda offered to adopt her, but she refused, convinced that she could eventually release films under own name. Her first major film was &quot;Provincial Actors&quot; (&quot;Aktorzy Prowincjonalni&quot;), a 1978 chronicle of tense backstage relations within a small-town theater company which was an allegory of Poland&#x27;s contemporary political situation. It won the International Critics Prize at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival.

Holland directed two more major films in Poland, &quot;Fever&quot; (&quot;Gorączka&quot;, 1980; entered in the 31st Berlin International Film Festival) and &quot;A Lonely Woman&quot; (&quot;Kobieta samotna&quot;) in 1981, before immigrating to France shortly before the December 1981 imposition of martial law in Poland. She was told that she could not return to Poland, and was unable to see or even have any contact with her daughter for over eight months. During this time, though safe, Holland was unable to create any successful films on her own.

Knowing she could not return to communist Poland, Holland wrote scripts for fellow Polish filmmakers in exile: Wajda&#x27;s &quot;Danton&quot;, &quot;A Love in Germany&quot; (1983), &quot;The Possessed&quot; (1988) and &quot;Korczak&quot; (1990). She also developed her own projects with Western European production companies, directing &quot;Angry Harvest&quot; (1985), &quot;To Kill a Priest&quot; (1988) and &quot;Olivier, Olivier&quot; (1992). Holland received an Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Language Film for &quot;Angry Harvest&quot;, a West German production about a Jewish woman on the run during World War II.

=== Holland&#x27;s depiction of the Holocaust ===
Some of Holland&#x27;s most famous work has been her depictions of the Holocaust. These works have been controversial because of Holland&#x27;s commitment to realism, and the acceptance of all types of individuals both as victims and as flawed human beings deserving of guilt. According to an article written about Holland, her films about the Holocaust &quot;cling to the world as she sees it. A world in which wisdom, if it exists at all, lies in accepting the violence and human frailty in everyone, without exception, including Jewish people&quot;. This is most poignant in Holland&#x27;s 2011 film &quot;In Darkness,&quot; in which Jewish and Polish Catholic characters are juxtaposed as having some of the same reprehensible qualities as well as redeemable ones.

Holland&#x27;s best-known film may be &quot;Europa Europa&quot; (1991), which was based on the life of Solomon Perel (a Jewish teenager who fled Germany for Poland after Kristallnacht in 1938). At the outbreak of World War II and the German invasion of Poland, Perel fled to the Soviet-occupied section of the country. Captured during the German invasion of the USSR in 1941, Solomon convinced a German officer that he was German and found himself enrolled in the Hitler Youth. The film received a lukewarm reception in Germany, and the German Oscar selection committee did not submit it for the 1991 Best Foreign Language Film Oscar. However, it attracted the attention of Michael Barker (who handled Orion Classics&#x27; sales at the time). &quot;Europa, Europa&quot; was released in the United States, winning the 1991 Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film and an Oscar nomination for best adapted screenplay.

Almost twenty years later, Holland released &quot;In Darkness&quot; (2011), a German-Canadian-Polish co production that dramatized the story of a Polish sewage worker who aided a group of Jewish refugees by hiding them in the sewers of Lwów during the time when Jewish people in the city were being sent to extermination camps. The story focuses on the relationships between ethnic Poles and Jewish people during the Holocaust. The characters of &quot;In Darkness&quot; are shown as having some strong similarities, despite the fact that the realities for Jews and ethnic Poles, specifically those depicted in the film, are extremely different. By comparing the Polish protagonist to the Jewish ones, Holland recreates the morally confusing and physically brutal world that though very different for those who were hunted, was everywhere during the Third Reich. This juxtaposition seemed to be a reflection of Holland&#x27;s own personal experience, specifically her struggle with identity and anti-semitism.

=== Holland and Hollywood ===
Until her successful 1991 film &quot;Europa, Europa,&quot; Holland was barely recognized as an acclaimed filmmaker in Hollywood. Her chance came about because of a roller coaster ride with the future producer of her American debut Artur Brauner. Holland had been treated to a day at Disneyland by the American Academy when she was in the running as a nominee for a foreign Oscar for her film &quot;Angry Harvest.&quot; After the difficulty she had getting &quot;Angry Harvest&quot; made, she had almost decided to give up filmmaking once and for all, but Brauner was convinced that with &quot;Europa, Europa&quot; he had a perfect project for her. During her trip to Disney, Holland, &quot;against her better judgement decided to ride a roller coaster with her producer. After they stepped off, Holland was shaking with fear as Brauner whipped a contract out of his pocket: &quot;Sign!&quot;&quot;. The success of this film brought Holland to the attention of mainstream Hollywood, bringing her the opportunity to direct the film adaptation of the 1911 novel &quot;The Secret Garden.&quot; This was Holland&#x27;s first movie made for a major studio with a broad American public in mind. It was a huge change in style for Holland, who was known at the point for her generally dark and pessimistic directorial perspective.

=== Holland&#x27;s later career ===

A friend of Polish writer and director Krzysztof Kieślowski, Holland collaborated on the screenplay for his film, &quot;Three Colors: Blue&quot;. Like Kieślowski, Holland frequently examines issues of faith in her work. Much of her film work has a strong political slant. Government reprisals, stifling bureaucratic machinery, sanctioned strikes and dysfunctional families are represented in her early work. In a 1988 interview Holland said that although women were important in her films, feminism was not the central theme of her work. She suggested that when she was making films in Poland under the Communist regime, there was an atmosphere of cross-gender solidarity against censorship (the main political issue). Holland said that she was interested in happenings between people, not the politics occurring outside them; in this context, &quot;maybe you could say that all my movies are political.&quot;
Holland&#x27;s later films include &quot;Olivier, Olivier&quot; (1992), &quot;The Secret Garden&quot; (1993), &quot;Total Eclipse&quot; (1995), &quot;Washington Square&quot; (1997), the HBO production &quot;Shot in the Heart&quot; (2001), &quot;Julie Walking Home&quot; (2001), and &quot;Copying Beethoven&quot; (2006).

In a 1997 interview, when asked how her experiences as a director have influenced her films, Holland said &quot;filmmakers of the younger generation lack life experience&quot; and, as a result, lack many of the tools needed to breathe humanity into their characters. Compared to directors of her generation, she feels that the younger generation comes from wealthy families, goes straight to film schools and watches movies primarily on videotape. Holland suggests that this results in what she calls a &quot;numbness&quot; and &quot;conventionalization&quot; of contemporary cinema.

In 2003, Holland was a member of the jury at the 25th Moscow International Film Festival. The following year she directed &quot;Moral Midgetry&quot;, the eighth episode of the third season of the HBO drama series &quot;The Wire&quot;. In 2006, Holland returned to direct the eighth episode of the fourth season (&quot;Corner Boys&quot;). Both were written by novelist Richard Price. Show runner David Simon said that Holland was &quot;wonderful behind the camera&quot; and staged the fight between Avon Barksdale and Stringer Bell in &quot;Moral Midgetry&quot; well.

In 2007 Holland, her sister Magdalena Łazarkiewicz and her daughter Katarzyna Adamik directed the Polish political drama series &quot;Ekipa&quot;, and in 2008 Holland became the first president of the Polish Film Academy. On 5 February 2009, the &quot;Krakow Post&quot; reported that Holland would direct a biopic about Krystyna Skarbek entitled &quot;Christine: War My Love&quot;.

Her 2011 film, &quot;In Darkness&quot;, was selected as the Polish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 84th Academy Awards. In January 2012, the film was one of the five nominees.

Holland accepted an offer to film a three-part drama for HBO about Jan Palach, who immolated himself in January 1969 to protest &quot;normalization&quot; after the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968. The resulting miniseries, &quot;Burning Bush&quot;, has been shown in Poland and Germany and selected for a Special Presentation screening at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival. She also won the Czech Lion Award in the Best Director category for this TV series.

On 1 December 2013, the film screened at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, where Holland was invited to deliver the Rajiv Vaidya Memorial Lecture: Viewing History through the Filmmaker&#x27;s Lens. It was also shown at the 2013 Philadelphia Film Festival. Holland was a guest speaker at Brooklyn College.

In December 2013, Holland was announced as director of NBC&#x27;s next miniseries &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot;, a two-part version of the best selling novel by Ira Levin with Zoe Saldana.

Holland took over the chairmanship of the European Film Academy board in January 2014.

In March 2016, it was announced that Holland was set to direct an adaptation of Peter Swanson&#x27;s best-selling novel &quot;The Kind Worth Killing&quot;, a psychological thriller about a ruthless female killer.

In February 2017, Agnieszka Holland received The Silver Bear Alfred Bauer Prize for &quot;Spoor&quot;. The award is given to the films that are perceived to open new perspectives in the art of film.

In 2019, she won the Golden Lions Award (Polish: &quot;Złote Lwy&quot;) at the 44th Gdynia Film Festival for her historical film &quot;Mr. Jones&quot;, which deals with the subject of the Great Famine in Ukraine. On 23 November 2019, Agnieszka Holland and Anne Applebaum were awarded Orders of Princess Olga, 3rd Class by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for their efforts in promoting the memory of the Holodomor.

In 2020, her next film &quot;Charlatan&quot; was selected as the Czech entry for the Best International Feature Film at the 93rd Academy Awards making the February shortlist. The same year, she was honoured with the FIPRESCI Platinum Award at the Sofia International Film Festival.

In 2023, her film &quot;Green Border&quot;, which portrays the plight of migrants caught in the Belarus–European Union border crisis, premiered at the 80th Venice International Film Festival where it was awarded the Special Jury Prize. The film caused much controversy, and met with strong criticism from Polish government officials, who accused Holland of painting a bad image abroad of Polish border guards. In October 2023, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association selected Holland as the winner of the association&#x27;s Career Achievement Award stating that &quot;With moral clarity, deep empathy and invigorating filmmaking, her work lays bare the damage that oppressive regimes and sociopolitical conflicts wreak on everyday souls&quot;. On 12 October 2023, she was awarded an honorary doctorate from the National Film School in Łódź.

Her next project is Franz Kafka biopic titled &quot;Franz&quot;. As of March 2024, the film is in pre-production. In July 2024, she was announced as a jury member at the 81st Venice International Film Festival. On 28 October 2024, Holland was awarded Medal of Merit from the Czech president Petr Pavel for her cultural impact.

== Other work ==
Agnieszka Holland translated the novel &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot; from Czech to Polish. She volunteered for this task after meeting the author, Milan Kundera, in 1982, and reading the manuscript; both were living in Paris at that time. Holland found the events of the book relatable not only to her personal experience of the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia but also to the strikes of 1980 in Poland, and therefore wanted to introduce the book to the Polish audience. The translation was originally published by the London-based publisher &quot;Aneks&quot; and has since been widely reprinted.

In 2023, Holland appeared as a guest star in the Polish Netflix series &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot;.

<doc id="499660" wikidata="Q216054" url="?curid=499660" title="Adhesive bandage">
<text>An adhesive bandage, also called a sticking plaster, sticky plaster, medical plaster, or simply plaster in British English, is a small medical dressing used for injuries not serious enough to require a full-size bandage. They are also known by the genericized trademarks of Band-Aid (as &quot;band-aid&quot; or &quot;band aid&quot; in Australia, Canada, India and the US) or Elastoplast (in the UK).

== Function ==
The adhesive bandage protects the wound and scab from friction, bacteria, damage, and dirt. Thus, the healing process of the body is less disturbed. Some of the dressings have antiseptic properties. An additional function is to hold the two cut edges of the skin together to make the healing process faster.

== Design ==
An adhesive bandage is a small, flexible sheet of material which is sticky on one side, with a smaller, non-sticky, absorbent pad stuck to the sticky side. The pad is placed against the wound, and overlapping edges of the sticky material are smoothed down so they stick to the surrounding skin. Adhesive bandages are generally packaged in a sealed, sterile bag, with a backing covering the sticky side; the backing is removed as the bandage is applied. They come in a variety of sizes and shapes.

== Materials ==

The backing and bag are often made of coated paper, but may be made of plastic.

The adhesive sheet is usually a woven fabric, plastic (PVC, polyethylene or polyurethane), or latex strip. It may or may not be waterproof; if it is airtight, the bandage is an occlusive dressing. The adhesive is commonly an acrylate, including methacrylates and epoxy diacrylates (which are also known as vinyl resins).

Some people have allergies to some of these materials, particularly latex and some adhesives.

==Colors==
Due to being widely available only in a standard color, some people with skin tones darker than the standard bandage color have expressed frustration at having to use bandages that looked less conspicuous on the skin of lighter-skinned people. This has led to greater support for pharmaceutical companies that manufacture these bandages in a variety of skin tones.

Some bandages, especially those designed for children, may come in a wide variety of colors or may feature cartoon characters.

Special bandages are used by food preparation workers. These are waterproof, have strong adhesive so they are less likely to fall off, and are usually blue so that they are more clearly visible in food. Some include a metal strip detectable by machines used in food manufacturing to ensure that food is free from foreign objects.

== Variants ==

Transdermal patches are adhesive bandages with the function to distribute medication through the skin, rather than protecting a wound.

Butterfly closures, also known as butterfly stitches, are generally thin adhesive strips which can be used to close small wounds. They are applied perpendicular to the laceration in a manner which pulls the skin on either side of the wound together. They are not true sutures, but can often be used in addition to, or in place of actual sutures for small wounds. Butterfly stitches can be advantageous in that they do not need a medical professional to be placed or removed, and are thus a common item in first aid kits.

<doc id="499663" wikidata="Q339539" url="?curid=499663" title="Vatersay">
<text>The island of Vatersay (; ) is the southernmost and westernmost inhabited island in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland, and the settlement of Caolas on the north coast of the island is the westernmost permanently inhabited place in Scotland. The main village, also called Vatersay, is in the south of the island.

==Geography==
Vatersay is irregularly shaped and has a tombolo: it is composed of two rocky islands (north and south) linked by a sandy isthmus. The isthmus is covered in sand dunes and on either side are large white-sand beaches: Bàgh Siar (West Bay), and Bàgh Bhatarsaigh (Vatersay Bay) to the east. There are a number of beaches backed by sand dunes.

The island is about from north to south, and the northern section of the island is about from west to east.

Vatersay is linked to the larger island of Barra to the north by the approximately Vatersay Causeway, which was completed in 1991. 
 This is of great benefit, as the shipping of goods and passenger traffic no longer has to rely on a small passenger ferry boat. Access to school and for emergency services is also much quicker and easier. The causeway is about by road from Castlebay.

At low tide, the island is also linked to the islet of Uineasan to the east, which is about 5 hectares, depending on the tide. To the south are the uninhabited islands of Pabbay, Mingulay and Sandray.

==Wildlife==

Wildlife on the island includes Eurasian otters, seals and grey herons. Bonnie Prince Charlie&#x27;s flower (&quot;Calystegia soldanella&quot;), reputedly originating from French seeds dropped by Bonnie Prince Charlie is, in Scotland, found only on Vatersay and Eriskay. Also found on Vatersay are Atlantic puffins.

==Archaeology==
The island has remains of an Iron Age broch at Dun a&#x27; Chaolais overlooking the Sound of Vatersay, and nearby is a passage grave dated to the 3rd millennium BC. There is also a Bronze Age cemetery at Trèseabhaig south of the heights of Heiseabhal Mòr and a cairn built around 1000 BC west of the village of Vatersay. The offshore islet of Bioruaslum has a walled fort that may be of Neolithic provenance.

==Ownership==

At the end of the nineteenth century, the existing landowner, wanting to use the whole of the island for their own farming purposes, evicted all the existing crofter inhabitants. Between 1902 and 1906 there were a sequence of Land raid actions when some of these men, the so-called &quot;Vatersay Raiders&quot;, returned and took possession of land, claiming that an ancient law allowed a man to acquire land by building a wooden dwelling and lighting a fire on its hearth within a day. However, the landowner Lady Cathcart took them to court, and they were imprisoned. After much public protest at these events, in 1909, the Congested Districts Board (Scotland) bought Vatersay island for £6250 (), and it was divided into 58 crofts.

==Wrecks==

In September 1853, the &quot;Annie Jane&quot;, a three-masted migrant ship out of Liverpool bound for Montreal, Quebec, Canada, struck rocks off West Beach during a storm. Within ten minutes the ship began to founder and break up, casting 450 people into the raging sea. In spite of the conditions, islanders tried to rescue the passengers and crew.

There were only a few survivors. A small cairn and monument marks the site where the bodies recovered from the sea were buried. An inscription reads:

On 28th September 1853 the ship Annie Jane with emigrants from Liverpool to Quebec was totally wrecked in this bay and threefourths of the crew and passengers numbering about 350 men women and children were drowned and their bodies interred here.

Two Chinese seamen from the SS &quot;Idomeneus&quot;, which sank on 28 September 1917, are also buried somewhere near the monument. There is a commemorative headstone in Cuier Churchyard.

The remains of a Catalina flying boat that crashed on the slopes of Heiseabhal Beag in 1944 lie in a stream bed near the shore.

<text>Rose Cecil O&#x27;Neill (June 25, 1874 – April 6, 1944) was an American cartoonist, illustrator, artist, and writer. She rose to fame for her creation of the popular comic strip characters, Kewpies, in 1909, and was also the first published female cartoonist in the United States.

The daughter of a book salesman and a homemaker, O&#x27;Neill was raised in rural Nebraska. She exhibited interest in the arts at an early age, and sought a career as an illustrator in New York City. Her Kewpie cartoons, which made their debut in a 1909 issue of &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;, were later manufactured as bisque dolls in 1912 by J. D. Kestner, a German toy company, followed by composition material and celluloid versions. The dolls were wildly popular in the early twentieth century, and are considered to be one of the first mass-marketed toys in the United States.

O&#x27;Neill also wrote several novels and books of poetry, and was active in the women&#x27;s suffrage movement. She was for a time the highest-paid female illustrator in the world upon the success of the Kewpie dolls. O&#x27;Neill has been inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

In 2022 at San Diego Comic-Con, Rose O&#x27;Neill was inducted into the Eisner Awards Hall of Fame as a Comic Pioneer.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Neill was born on June 25, 1874, in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, the daughter of William Patrick, an Irish immigrant, and Alice Asenath &quot;Meemie&quot; Smith O&#x27;Neill. She had two younger sisters, Lee and Callista, and three younger brothers: Hugh, James, and Clarence. The family moved to rural Nebraska while O&#x27;Neill was young. From early childhood, she expressed significant interest in the arts, immersing herself in drawing, painting, and sculpture. At thirteen, she entered a children&#x27;s drawing competition sponsored by the &quot;Omaha Herald&quot; and won first prize for her drawing, titled &quot;Temptation Leading to an Abyss&quot;.

Within two years, O&#x27;Neill was providing illustrations for the local Omaha publications &quot;Excelsior&quot; and &quot;The Great Divide&quot; as well as other periodicals, having secured this work with help from the editor at the &quot;Omaha World-Herald&quot; and the Art Director from &quot;Everybody Magazine&quot; who had judged the competition. The income helped support her family, which her father had struggled to support as a bookseller. O&#x27;Neill attended the Sacred Heart Convent school in Omaha.

==Career==
===Move to New York===

To market her skills to a broader audience, O&#x27;Neill moved to New York in 1893; she stopped in Chicago en route to visit the World Columbian Exposition. The nuns accompanied her to various publishers to sell work from her portfolio of sixty drawings. She was able to sell her drawings to numerous publishing houses and began taking orders for more. A four-panel comic strip by O&#x27;Neill was featured in a September 19, 1896, issue of &quot;Truth&quot; magazine, making her the first American woman to publish a comic strip.

While O&#x27;Neill was living in New York, her father made a homestead claim on a small tract of land in the Ozarks wilderness of southern Missouri. The tract had a &quot;dog-trot&quot; cabin with two log cabins (one was used for eating and the other for sleeping) and a breezeway between. A year later when O&#x27;Neill visited the land, it had become known as &quot;Bonniebrook&quot;. During this time O&#x27;Neill was experiencing considerable success, having joined the staff of &quot;Puck&quot;, an American humor magazine, where she was the only female on staff. In 1909, she began work drawing advertisements for Jell-O, and contributed illustrations to &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Life&quot; magazines.
===Early illustrations===
In 1892, while in Omaha, O&#x27;Neill met a young Virginian named Gray Latham, whom she married in 1896. He visited O&#x27;Neill in New York City, and continued writing to her when she went to Missouri to see her family. After Latham&#x27;s father went to Mexico to make films, he went to Bonniebrook in 1896. Concerned with the welfare of her family, O&#x27;Neill sent much of her paycheck home.

In the following years O&#x27;Neill became unhappy with Latham, as he liked &quot;living large&quot; and gambling, and was known as a playboy. O&#x27;Neill found that Latham, with his very expensive tastes, had spent her paychecks on himself. O&#x27;Neill then moved to Taney County, Missouri, where she filed for divorce in 1901, returning to Bonniebrook. Latham died the same year, and some sources state that O&#x27;Neill was widowed.

In late 1901, O&#x27;Neill began receiving anonymous letters and gifts in the mail. She learned that they were sent by Harry Leon Wilson, an assistant editor at &quot;Puck&quot;. O&#x27;Neill and Wilson became romantically involved soon after, and married in 1902. After a honeymoon in Colorado, they moved to Bonniebrook, where they lived for the next several winters. During the first three years Wilson wrote two novels, &quot;The Lions of the Lord&quot; (1903) and &quot;The Boss of Little Arcady&quot; (1905), both of which O&#x27;Neill drew illustrations for. One of Wilson&#x27;s later novels, &quot;Ruggles of Red Gap&quot;, became popular and was made into several motion pictures, including a silent movie, a &quot;talkie&quot; starring Charles Laughton, and then a remake called &quot;Fancy Pants&quot; starring Lucille Ball and Bob Hope. The couple divorced in 1907.

In 1904, O&#x27;Neill published her first novel, &quot;The Loves of Edwy&quot;, which she also illustrated. A review published by &quot;Book News&quot; in 1905 considered O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s illustrations to &quot;possess a rare breadth of sympathy with and understanding of humanity&quot;.

===Kewpies and breakthrough===
As educational opportunities were made available in the 19th century, women artists became part of professional enterprises, and some founded their own art associations. Artwork made by women was considered to be inferior, and to help overcome that stereotype women became, according to art historian Laura Prieto, &quot;increasingly vocal and confident&quot; in promoting women&#x27;s work. Many women artists, including O&#x27;Neill, could be characterized as examples of the educated, modern, and independent &quot;New Woman,&quot; a form of gender identity that emerged at the time. According to Prieto, artists &quot;played crucial roles in representing the New Woman, both by drawing images of the icon and exemplifying this emerging type through their own lives&quot;. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, about 88% of the subscribers of 11,000 magazines and periodicals were women. As women entered the artist community, publishers hired women to create illustrations that depicted the world from a woman&#x27;s perspective. Other successful illustrators were Jennie Augusta Brownscombe, Jessie Willcox Smith, Elizabeth Shippen Green, and Violet Oakley.

It was amid the New Woman and burgeoning suffragist movements that, in 1908, O&#x27;Neill began to concentrate on producing original artwork, and it was during this period that she created the whimsical Kewpie characters for which she became known. Their name, &quot;Kewpie&quot;, derives from Cupid, the Roman god of love. According to O&#x27;Neill, she became obsessed with the idea of the cherubic characters, to the point that she had dreams about them: &quot;I thought about the Kewpies so much that I had a dream about them where they were all doing acrobatic pranks on the coverlet of my bed. One sat in my hand.&quot; She described them as &quot;a sort of little round fairy whose one idea is to teach people to be merry and kind at the same time&quot;. The Kewpie characters made their debut in comic strip form in 1909 in an issue of &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;. Further publications of the Kewpie comics in &quot;Woman&#x27;s Home Companion&quot; and &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; helped the cartoon grow in popularity rapidly.

In 1913, German doll manufacturer Kestner &amp; Co. began making Kewpie dolls. The dolls were immediately successful, and more companies were licensed to produce them in order to meet demand. O&#x27;Neill repeatedly visited Germany to supervise the doll manufacturers. As O&#x27;Neill rose to fame, she garnered a public reputation as a bohemian, and became an ardent women&#x27;s rights advocate. The success of the Kewpies amassed her a fortune of $1.4 million, with which she purchased properties including Bonniebrook, an apartment in Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village, &quot;Castle Carabas&quot; in Connecticut, and &quot;Villa Narcissus&quot; (bought from Charles Caryl Coleman) on the Isle of Capri, Italy. At the height of the Kewpie success, O&#x27;Neill was the highest-paid female illustrator in the world. O&#x27;Neill was well known in New York City&#x27;s artistic circles, and through her association, she was the inspiration for the song &quot;Rose of Washington Square&quot;.

===Paris and later career===
O&#x27;Neill continued working, even at her wealthiest, exploring many different types of art. She learned sculpture at the hand of Auguste Rodin and had several exhibitions of sculptures and paintings in Paris and the United States. These works were more experimental in nature, and largely influenced by dreams and mythology. O&#x27;Neill spent 1921 to 1926 living in Paris. While there, she was elected to the Société Coloniale des Artistes Français in 1921, and had exhibitions of her sculptures at the Galerie Devambez in Paris and the Wildenstein Galleries in New York in 1921 and 1922, respectively.

In 1927, O&#x27;Neill returned to the United States, and by 1937 was living at Bonniebrook permanently. By the 1940s, she had lost the majority of her money and properties, partly through extravagant spending, as well as the cost of fully supporting her family, her entourage of &quot;artistic&quot; hangers-on, and her first husband. The Great Depression also hurt O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s fortune. During that period, O&#x27;Neill was dismayed to find that her work was no longer in demand. After thirty years of popularity, the Kewpie character phenomenon had faded, and photography was replacing illustration as a commercial vehicle. O&#x27;Neill experimented with crafting a new doll, eventually creating Little Ho Ho, which was a laughing baby Buddha. However, before plans could be finalized for production of the new little figure, the factory burned to the ground.

==Personal life==
O&#x27;Neill became a prominent personality in the Branson, Missouri community donating her time and pieces of artwork to the School of the Ozarks at Point Lookout, Missouri, and remaining active in the local art community.

On April 6, 1944, O&#x27;Neill died of heart failure resulting from paralysis at the home of her nephew in Springfield, Missouri. She is interred in the family cemetery at Bonniebrook Homestead, next to her mother and several family members. Bonniebrook Homestead was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.

<text>Russell Alan Hulse (born November 28, 1950) is an American physicist and winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics, shared with his thesis advisor Joseph Hooton Taylor Jr., &quot;for the discovery of a new type of pulsar, a discovery that has opened up new possibilities for the study of gravitation&quot;.

==Biography==
Hulse was born in New York City and graduated from the Bronx High School of Science and the Cooper Union. He received his PhD in physics from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1975.

While working on his PhD dissertation, he was a scholar in 1974 at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico of Cornell University. There he worked with Taylor on a large-scale survey for pulsars. It was this work that led to the discovery of the first binary pulsar.

In 1974, Hulse and Taylor discovered binary pulsar PSR B1913, which is made up of a pulsar and black companion star. Neutron star rotation emits impulses that are extremely regular and stable in the radio wave region and is nearby condensed material body gravitation (non-detectable in the visible field). Hulse, Taylor, and other colleagues have used this first binary pulsar to make high-precision tests of general relativity, demonstrating the existence of gravitational radiation. An approximation of this radiant energy is described by the formula of the quadrupolar radiation of Albert Einstein (1918).

In 1979, researchers announced measurements of small acceleration effects of the orbital movements of a pulsar. This was initial proof that the system of these two moving masses emits gravitational waves.

In 1993, Hulse and Taylor shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of the first binary pulsar.

==Later years==

After receiving his PhD, Hulse did postdoctoral work at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia. He moved to Princeton, where he has worked for many years at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. He has also worked on science education, and in 2003 joined the University of Texas at Dallas as a visiting professor of physics and of mathematics and science education.

Hulse was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2003, and is cited in the American Men and Women of Science.

In 2004, Hulse joined University of Texas at Dallas and became the Founding Director of UT Dallas Science and Engineering Education Center (SEEC).

In July 2007 Hulse joined the Aurora Imaging Technology advisory board.

<doc id="499685" wikidata="Q411398" url="?curid=499685" title="Sulfonamide (medicine)">
<text>Sulfonamide is a functional group (a part of a molecule) that is the basis of several groups of drugs, which are called sulphonamides, sulfa drugs or sulpha drugs. The original antibacterial sulfonamides are synthetic antimicrobial agents that contain the sulfonamide group. Some sulfonamides are also devoid of antibacterial activity, e.g., the anticonvulsant sultiame. The sulfonylureas and thiazide diuretics are newer drug groups based upon the antibacterial sulfonamides.

Allergies to sulfonamides are common. The overall incidence of adverse drug reactions to sulfa antibiotics is approximately 3%, close to penicillin; hence medications containing sulfonamides are prescribed carefully.

Sulfonamide drugs were the first broadly effective antibacterials to be used systemically, and paved the way for the antibiotic revolution in medicine.

==Function==
In bacteria, antibacterial sulfonamides act as competitive inhibitors of the enzyme dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS), an enzyme involved in folate synthesis. Sulfonamides are therefore bacteriostatic and inhibit growth and multiplication of bacteria, but do not kill them. Humans, in contrast to bacteria, acquire folate (vitamin B9) through the diet.
Sulfonamides are used to treat allergies and coughs, as well as having antifungal and antimalarial functions. The moiety is also present in other medications that are not antimicrobials, including thiazide diuretics (including hydrochlorothiazide, metolazone, and indapamide, among others), loop diuretics (including furosemide, bumetanide, and torsemide), acetazolamide, sulfonylureas (including glipizide, glyburide, among others), and some COX-2 inhibitors (e.g., celecoxib).

Sulfasalazine, in addition to its use as an antibiotic, is also used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.

==History==
Sulfonamide drugs were the first broadly effective antibacterials to be used systemically, and paved the way for the antibiotic revolution in medicine. The first sulfonamide, trade-named Prontosil, was a prodrug. Experiments with Prontosil began in 1932 in the laboratories of Bayer AG, at that time a component of the huge German chemical trust IG Farben. The Bayer team believed that coal-tar dyes which are able to bind preferentially to bacteria and parasites might be used to attack harmful organisms in the body. After years of fruitless trial-and-error work on hundreds of dyes, a team led by physician/researcher Gerhard Domagk (working under the general direction of IG Farben executive Heinrich Hörlein) finally found one that worked: a red dye synthesized by Bayer chemist Josef Klarer that had remarkable effects on stopping some bacterial infections in mice. The first official communication about the breakthrough discovery was not published until 1935, more than two years after the drug was patented by Klarer and his research partner Fritz Mietzsch.

Prontosil, as Bayer named the new drug, was the first medicine ever discovered that could effectively treat a range of bacterial infections inside the body. It had a strong protective action against infections caused by streptococci, including blood infections, childbed fever, and erysipelas, and a lesser effect on infections caused by other cocci. However, it had no effect at all in the test tube, exerting its antibacterial action only in live animals. Later, it was discovered by Daniel Bovet, Federico Nitti, and Jacques and Thérèse Tréfouël, a French research team led by Ernest Fourneau at the Pasteur Institute, that the drug was metabolized into two parts inside the body, releasing from the inactive dye portion a smaller, colorless, active compound called sulfanilamide. The discovery helped establish the concept of &quot;bioactivation&quot; and dashed the German corporation&#x27;s dreams of enormous profit; the active molecule sulfanilamide (or sulfa) had first been synthesized in 1906 and was widely used in the dye-making industry; its patent had since expired and the drug was available to anyone.

The result was a sulfa craze. For several years in the late 1930s, hundreds of manufacturers produced myriad forms of sulfa. This and the lack of testing requirements led to the elixir sulfanilamide disaster in the fall of 1937, during which at least 100 people were poisoned with diethylene glycol. This led to the passage of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in 1938 in the United States, giving authority to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to oversee the safety of food, drugs, medical devices, and cosmetics. As the first and only effective broad-spectrum antibiotic available in the years before penicillin, heavy use of sulfa drugs continued into the early years of World War II. They are credited with saving the lives of tens of thousands of patients, including Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr. (son of US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt) and Winston Churchill. Sulfa had a central role in preventing wound infections during the war. American soldiers were issued a first-aid kit containing sulfa pills and powder and were told to sprinkle it on any open wound.

The sulfanilamide compound is more active in the protonated form. The drug has very low solubility and sometimes can crystallize in the kidneys, due to its first pKa of around 10. This is a very painful experience, so patients are told to take the medication with copious amounts of water. Newer analogous compounds prevent this complication because they have a lower pKa, around 5–6, making them more likely to remain in a soluble form.

Many thousands of molecules containing the sulfanilamide structure have been created since its discovery (by one account, over 5,400 permutations by 1945), yielding improved formulations with greater effectiveness and less toxicity. Sulfa drugs are still widely used for conditions such as acne and urinary tract infections, and are receiving renewed interest for the treatment of infections caused by bacteria resistant to other antibiotics.

== Preparation ==
Sulfonamides are prepared by the reaction of a sulfonyl chloride with ammonia or an amine. Certain sulfonamides (sulfadiazine or sulfamethoxazole) are sometimes mixed with the drug trimethoprim, which acts against dihydrofolate reductase. Ireland is the largest exporter worldwide of sulfonamides, accounting for approximately 32% of total exports.

== Varieties ==
== Side effects ==
Sulfonamides have the potential to cause a variety of adverse effects, including urinary tract disorders, haemopoietic disorders, porphyria and hypersensitivity reactions. When used in large doses, they may cause a strong allergic reaction. The most serious of these are classified as severe cutaneous adverse reactions (i.e. SCARs) and include the Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis (also known as Lyell syndrome), the DRESS syndrome, and a not quite as serious SCARs reaction, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. Any one of these SCARs may be triggered by certain sulfonamides.

Approximately 3% of the general population have adverse reactions when treated with sulfonamide antimicrobials. Of note is the observation that patients with HIV have a much higher prevalence, at about 60%.

Hypersensitivity reactions are less common in nonantibiotic sulfonamides, and, though controversial, the available evidence suggests those with hypersensitivity to sulfonamide antibiotics do not have an increased risk of hypersensitivity reaction to the nonantibiotic agents. A key component to the allergic response to sulfonamide antibiotics is the arylamine group at N4, found in sulfamethoxazole, sulfasalazine, sulfadiazine, and the anti-retrovirals amprenavir and fosamprenavir. Other sulfonamide drugs do not contain this arylamine group; available evidence suggests that patients who are allergic to arylamine sulfonamides do not cross-react to sulfonamides that lack the arylamine group, and may therefore safely take non-arylamine sulfonamides. It has therefore been argued that the terms &quot;sulfonamide allergy&quot; or &quot;sulfa allergy&quot; are misleading and should be replaced by a reference to a specific drug (e.g., &quot;cotrimoxazole allergy&quot;).

Two regions of the sulfonamide antibiotic chemical structure are implicated in the hypersensitivity reactions associated with the class.

* The first is the N1 heterocyclic ring, which causes a type I hypersensitivity reaction.
* The second is the N4 amino nitrogen that, in a stereospecific process, forms reactive metabolites that cause either direct cytotoxicity or immunologic response.

The nonantibiotic sulfonamides lack both of these structures.

The most common manifestations of a hypersensitivity reaction to sulfa drugs are rash and hives. However, there are several life-threatening manifestations of hypersensitivity to sulfa drugs, including Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, fulminant hepatic necrosis, and acute pancreatitis, among others.

<text>John Kingsley Read (18 April 1936 – 18 September 1985) was a British fascist politician and Holocaust denier. He was chairman of the National Front (NF) from 1974 until 1976, when he founded the National Party.

A former member of the Conservative Party and chairman of the Blackburn Young Conservatives, Read left to join the NF in 1973 having addressed a rally against the arrival of Ugandan Asians in Britain earlier that same year in Blackburn.

A strong orator, Read rose quickly through the NF ranks, his style drawing comparisons to American politician George Wallace, to whom he also bore a passing physical resemblance. Read was later denounced as a drunkard by Andrew Fountaine.

After securing the support of potential rival Roy Painter, Read was elected chairman of the National Front in 1974, with the neo-imperialist John Tyndall his deputy chairman, in what was regarded as a vote by the &quot;populist&quot; or Strasserite wing of the party against the authoritarian Tyndall.

Later, Read himself &quot;drifted&quot; into the populist camp but was only narrowly re-elected as chairman in 1975. He tried to expel Tyndall from the party but Read&#x27;s decision was overturned at the High Court.

In 1976, Read left the NF along with many of his followers to establish the National Party (NP), which won two seats on Blackburn Council, one of them held by Read, but their other councillor was disqualified for election irregularities.

Read designed the front cover motif for the British edition of Arthur Butz&#x27;s Holocaust denial book, &quot;The Hoax of the Twentieth Century&quot;, which was circulated by the NP. After the murder of a young Sikh man, Gurdip Singh Chaggar, in a suspected racist attack, Read remarked during a speech at an NP meeting, &quot;One down, a million to go,&quot; which effectively ended his presentation of a more &quot;moderate&quot; stance. Read was later acquitted of making the statement in a decision which aroused &quot;furious controversy&quot;.

Following Read&#x27;s death in 1985, Nick Griffin asserted that Kingsley Read had been working with the knowledge of other leading members of the NF to feed false information to &quot;Searchlight&quot; magazine, although John Tyndall was convinced that Read had been a double agent. &quot;Searchlight&quot; stated that Read had supplied them with the entire membership list of the National Party.

In 1984, Read appeared in &quot;The Other Face of Terror&quot;, a British documentary about far-right groups. Read openly admitted designing and helping to distribute Holocaust denial material.

<text>The lieutenant governor of North Carolina is the second-highest elected official in the U.S. state of North Carolina and is the only elected official to have powers in both the legislative and executive branches of state government. A member of the North Carolina Council of State, the lieutenant governor serves a four-year term with a two consecutive term limit. The current lieutenant governor is Rachel Hunt, a Democrat, who has held the office since 2025. The Constitution of North Carolina designates the lieutenant governor the &quot;ex officio&quot; president of the State Senate and a member of the State Board of Education. They are also required to serve as acting governor of the state in the event of the governor&#x27;s absence, and assume the governorship in the event it becomes vacant. 

Five lieutenant governors have succeeded to the governorship throughout the office&#x27;s history due to a vacancy. The constitution allows the governor and General Assembly to assign the lieutenant governor additional duties, and the lieutenant governor has thus been accorded membership on and responsibility for several appointments on other state boards. Unlike other Council of State offices, there is no mechanism to fill a vacancy in the lieutenant governorship between elections. From its creation in 1868 up until the 1970s, the lieutenant governorship was a single-term, part-time position largely confined to legislative duties when the General Assembly was in session. Most of the candidates who sought the office were veteran legislators seeking a final prestigious accomplishment for their careers. In 1971, new legislation declared it a full-time job.

In 1972, the Democratic-controlled General Assembly expanded the office&#x27;s resources to challenge the incoming Republican governor. In 1977, the lieutenant governor was constitutionally authorized to serve two consecutive terms. The office&#x27;s political prominence increased over the years following the succession amendment and the legislature continued to expand its powers. Upon a Republican&#x27;s assumption of lieutenant gubernatorial office in 1989, Democrats in the Senate modified the body&#x27;s rules, stripping the office of its long-standing powers to appoint committees in that house and assign bills to those committees. With the shift away from legislative duties, the office became increasingly used as a means to enhance its incumbents&#x27; bids for higher office; lieutenant governors have often run for governor, but few have been successful.

== History ==
Under North Carolina&#x27;s first constitution in 1776, the state&#x27;s executive authority was exercised by the governor. It accorded the duty of presiding over the North Carolina Senate to a speaker of the Senate, who was also to act as governor in case that office became vacant. The office of lieutenant governor was created by the state&#x27;s 1868 constitution. The lieutenant governor—who was to be chosen by popular election—replaced the speaker of the Senate as that body&#x27;s presiding officer and assumed the former office&#x27;s role in succeeding to the governorship in the event it became vacant. Furthermore, the constitution made the official an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of the newly created State Board of Education. 

From 1868 until 1970, presiding over the Senate was the lieutenant governor&#x27;s primary role, and in that capacity they appointed senators to committees (a power accorded to them by Senate rules) and oversaw the passage of legislation. The job was a part-time position, since the lieutenant governor served only when the General Assembly was in session or in the absence of the governor. What other functions they performed were largely ceremonial, and the office attracted little public attention. From 1943 to 1954, by informal arrangement, the official chaired the State Board of Education. Constitutional revisions which took effect in 1971 made the lieutenant governor a member of the Council of State. The Executive Reorganization Act of 1971 affirmed the role of lieutenant governor as a full-time job. With the election of James Holshouser as governor in 1972—the first Republican to win the office in decades—the Democratic majority in the General Assembly was compelled to raise the stature of the office of the lieutenant governor, which was held by Democrat Jim Hunt. It raised the job&#x27;s salary from $5,000 to $30,000 per year, increased the office operating budget, and expanded its staff from two to five.

From 1868 to 1977, the lieutenant governor and the governor were limited to standalone four-year terms. In 1977, the state constitution was amended to allow both the governor and the lieutenant governor to serve two consecutive terms. James C. Green, who served from 1977 to 1985, was the first lieutenant governor to serve consecutive terms. The office&#x27;s political prominence increased over the years following the succession amendment and the legislature continued to expand its powers. Green led the Senate in an effort at the onset of his term to make the lieutenant governor the &quot;ex officio&quot; chair of the State Board of Education by law, directly challenging the authority of Hunt, who had since become governor and was responsible for recommending the board&#x27;s chair. The proposal was ultimately defeated in the House of Representatives.

Despite this, the legislature granted the lieutenant governor automatic membership on several state boards and significant appointment responsibilities. By 1982, North Carolina had one of the most powerful lieutenant governorships in the country. By 1989, the lieutenant governor was responsible for 195 appointments to 87 state boards (106 of these were subject to legislative confirmation). Despite this, the officials experienced mistrust from the Senate and faced several unsuccessful attempts to strip them of their appointive powers. From 1985 to 1989, Democrat Robert B. Jordan served as lieutenant governor while Republican James G. Martin served as governor, making him the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the North Carolina Democratic Party. Upon Republican Jim Gardner&#x27;s assumption of lieutenant gubernatorial office in 1989, Democrats in the Senate modified the body&#x27;s rules, stripping the office of its powers to appoint committees in that house and assign bills to its committees. During Gardner&#x27;s tenure, the office&#x27;s staff was further expanded. In 1997 the General Assembly debated modifying the constitution to provide for the election of the lieutenant governor on a joint ticket with the governor or to have the office assume the responsibilities of the North Carolina Secretary of State, but these proposals did not move forward. Another effort in 2015 to amend the constitution to provide for the office&#x27;s joint ticket election with the governor failed.

Three lieutenant governors assumed the office of governor upon the death of the incumbent: Curtis H. Brogden in 1874, Thomas M. Holt in 1891, and Luther H. Hodges in 1954. Tod R. Caldwell in 1870 assumed the office upon the previous governor&#x27;s impeachment and removal, and Thomas J. Jarvis assumed it in 1879 upon the incumbent&#x27;s resignation. Historically, the lieutenant governorship was often sought by veteran state legislators as a final prestigious accomplishment for their careers. With the shift away from legislative duties after the 1970s, the office became increasingly used as a means to enhance incumbents&#x27; bids for higher office; lieutenant governors have often run for governor, but few have been successful. Bev Perdue was the first woman to serve as lieutenant governor, while Mark Robinson, sworn in in 2021, was the first black person to ever be elected to the office. The incumbent, Rachel Hunt, was sworn in on January 1, 2025.

== Election ==
As with other state officials, only qualified voters in North Carolina are eligible to be elected lieutenant governor. Unlike most other candidates, who must be at least 21 years of age, any potential lieutenant governor—like the governor—must be at least 30 years of age. They must also have been a citizen of the United States for at least five years and a resident of North Carolina for at least two years preceding election. Like the governor, the lieutenant governor is elected every four years thereafter, but is elected on their own ticket. Contested elections for the office of lieutenant governor are resolved by a majority vote of the General Assembly. Their term of office begins on January 1 following their election. They serve for a four-year term and until their successor has assumed office. The lieutenant governor is limited to serving two consecutive terms in office, with no limits on nonconsecutive terms.

==Powers, duties, and structure==

The lieutenant governor is the only officer in North Carolina vested with responsibilities in both the executive and legislative branches of state government. The constitution designates the lieutenant governor the President of the Senate. In this capacity they direct the debate on bills and maintain order in that house, but have little influence over its workflow. They cannot cast a vote in the Senate except to break ties. In the event of a gubernatorial vacancy, the constitution requires the lieutenant governor to assume the governorship. If the governor is temporarily incapacitated or absent, the lieutenant governor is to serve as acting governor. In the event the governor-elect fails to qualify for their office, the lieutenant governor-elect becomes governor. 

The constitution makes the lieutenant governor &quot;ex offico&quot; a member of the North Carolina Board of Education and one of the ten state officers who comprise the Council of State. They are also &quot;ex officio&quot; a member of the North Carolina Capital Planning Commission, the State Board of Community Colleges, and the State Board of Economic Development. They have the power to appoint some members of other executive state boards, though state law does not grant them the power to create their own official boards. The constitution allows the governor and General Assembly to assign the lieutenant governor additional duties. State law empowers the lieutenant governor to oversee the awarding of the North Carolina Medal of Valor for law enforcement officers.

The lieutenant governor&#x27;s office is located in the Hawkins-Hartness House on Blount Street in Raleigh. They also have an office in the North Carolina State Legislative Building. They retain a staff to assist in carrying out their functions. As of April 2024, the office has nine employees retained under the terms of the State Human Resources Act. They are provided with a security detail supplied by the North Carolina Highway Patrol. As with all Council of State officers, the lieutenant governor&#x27;s salary is fixed by the General Assembly and cannot be reduced during their term of office. In 2023, the lieutenant governor&#x27;s annual salary was $157,403.

== Removal and vacancies ==
Unlike with other officers on the Council of State, the governor of North Carolina cannot appoint an interim officer in the event the lieutenant governor&#x27;s office becomes vacant. In such an instance, the lieutenant governor&#x27;s role in the Senate is assumed by the president pro tempore. In the event that the lieutenant governor is impeached by the North Carolina House of Representatives, the chief justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court presides over the court of impeachment, composed at minimum of a majority of the members of the State Senate. A two-thirds affirmative vote of the senators present constitutes a conviction and thus removal and future disqualification from holding office. Avenues for removing the lieutenant governor from office in circumstances other than impeachment—such as a lack of physical or mental capacity—may be determined by law.

<text>The state auditor of North Carolina is a statewide elected office in the U.S. state of North Carolina. The state auditor is a constitutional officer responsible for overseeing and reviewing the financial accounts of all state government agencies. The auditor also conducts performance audits of state agencies, ensures state agencies&#x27; accounting conforms with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, evaluates the integrity of computer-generated information, and investigates the misuse of state funds or property. The incumbent is Dave Boliek, who became state auditor on January 1, 2025.

Auditors have been employed by North Carolina&#x27;s government since it was an English colony. The Office of Auditor of Public Accounts was created in 1862. Six years later it was replaced by the Office of State Auditor, filled by a candidate popularly elected every four years and not subject to term limits. The state auditor was responsible for several accounting and fiscal duties for much of the position&#x27;s existence, though these were assigned elsewhere in the 20th century. The state auditor leads the Department of State Auditor and sits on the North Carolina Council of State.

== History of the office ==
The Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina, adopted on March 1, 1669, for the Province of Carolina, provided for twelve auditors to maintain various accounts, but there is no evidence that the offices were ever brought into use. Over the following decades, boards of auditors were appointed by the North Carolina General Assembly and the King of England&#x27;s comptrollers to attend to matters in various localities as stipulated by the English crown. In 1782 the General Assembly appointed Richard Caswell as the Comptroller of the State of North Carolina, responsible for the maintenance of public accounts. The assembly also established ten boards of auditors for different areas of the state.

In 1862 the General Assembly altered the previous system by establishing the Office of Auditor of Public Accounts, who was to be elected every two years by the legislature. The post was abolished in 1865. The North Carolina Constitution of 1868 created the Office of State Auditor, superseding the auditor of public accounts and abolishing the post of comptroller. The auditor was to &quot;superintend the fiscal affairs of the State; examine and settle accounts of persons indebted to the State; liquidate claims by persons against the State; and to draw warrants on the State Treasurer for moneys to be paid out of the treasury.&quot; The document also moved the office out of the legislative branch of government and into the executive branch, stipulating that its holder was to be popularly elected every four years.

The auditor&#x27;s original duties included writing an annual report on state revenue and spending—including projections for the following fiscal year, maintaining general accounts of the state, recommending improvements to state fiscal management, settling claims against the state and its own claims against persons, certifying treasury balances, and issuing warrants for treasury disbursements. In 1872 the auditor was made responsible for compiling local tax lists for county sheriffs to aid in their collection and ascertaining that sheriffs properly collected. The office was relieved of these responsibilities in 1923. In 1921 the General Assembly empowered the auditor to audit and adjust public accounts and tasked them with overseeing all state accounting systems. In 1955 the assembly transferred the general accounting duties and responsibility for treasury disbursement warrants to the Budget Bureau. In 1971 North Carolina adopted a new constitution which altered the office little, though the Executive Organization Act of 1971 created the Department of State Auditor. In 1974 the General Assembly authorized the state auditor to conduct operational audits of state agencies. 

In 2024 the Assembly assigned the auditor the responsibility of appointing the members of the North Carolina State Board of Elections, effective May 2025. The legislation also gave the auditor the power to appoint county boards of elections chairs. The law is currently undergoing litigation.

Ralph Campbell Jr., sworn in to the office of state auditor in 1993, was the first black person ever elected to a statewide executive office in North Carolina. During his tenure he equipped auditing staff with computers. Les Merritt, who assumed office in 2005, was the first Certified Public Accountant to serve as state auditor. Beth Wood, sworn in 2009, was the first woman to hold the office. Jessica Holmes, sworn in in 2023, was the first black woman to hold the office. The incumbent, Dave Boliek, was sworn in on January 1, 2025.

== Powers, duties, and structure ==

The state auditor is a constitutional officer. Article III, Section 7, of the Constitution of North Carolina stipulates the popular election of the state auditor every four years. Unlike most of the 18 other states with an elected auditor, North Carolina does not require candidates for the office to be Certified Public Accountants. The office holder is not subject to term limits. In the event of a vacancy in the office, the Governor of North Carolina has the authority to appoint a successor until a candidate is elected at the next general election for members of the General Assembly. Per Article III, Section 8 of the constitution, the auditor sits on the Council of State. The auditor is &quot;ex officio&quot; a member of the Local Government Commission, the Capital Facilities Finance Agency, the Debt Affordability Advisory Committee, and several other bodies. They are a nonvoting member of the Office of State Budget and Management&#x27;s Council of Internal Auditing. They are fifth in line of succession to the governor. As with all Council of State officers, the auditor&#x27;s salary is fixed by the General Assembly and cannot be reduced during their term of office. In 2022, the auditor&#x27;s annual salary was .

The state auditor leads the Office of the State Auditor. The department is split into a general administration division and an auditing division. The former division is led by the state auditor&#x27;s chief deputy and handles administrative concerns including personnel matters, internal budgeting and procurement, and intra-department coordination. The latter division is headed by a deputy state auditor and several audit managers and is responsible for conducting audits. As of June 2024, the department has 120 employees. The department is headquartered in the Albemarle Building in downtown Raleigh. It also maintains offices in Pitt, New Hanover, Forsyth, and Buncombe counties.

Article V, Chapter 147 of the North Carolina General Statutes grants the state auditor broad authority to examine all documents and financial affairs of all state agencies. The official is also responsible for auditing federal grant programs in the state and can audit private entities which receive state funds. The state auditor works with the state controller to compile the state&#x27;s annual comprehensive financial report and, as required by federal law, issues the Statewide Single Audit Report. The auditor&#x27;s office performs various financial and technological audits and other investigations, including performance audits of state agencies, ensuring state agencies&#x27; accounting conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, evaluations of the integrity of computer-generated information, and inquiries into the misuse of state funds or property. The Department of State Auditor maintains a tip line to collect reports on government malfeasance and collects hundreds of such tips per year. It can conduct special investigations at the request of the General Assembly or the governor. The auditor is empowered to summon people to produce records and answer questions under oath, but does not have law enforcement powers and cannot bring criminal charges against individuals. The office does not conduct personal tax audits. The auditor can request advisory opinions on legal matters from the North Carolina attorney general.

<text>The North Carolina Secretary of State is an elected constitutional officer in the executive branch of the government of the U.S. state of North Carolina, and is fourth in the line of succession to the office of Governor of North Carolina. The secretary maintains the official journal of the North Carolina General Assembly and is responsible for overseeing land records, chartering corporations, and administering some commercial regulations. The incumbent is Elaine Marshall, a Democrat and the first woman elected to the office.

The office traces its origins to the office of the Colonial Secretary of Carolina, created in 1665, and was formally created as an office in 1776. Since 1868, the secretary has been popularly elected every four years. The office&#x27;s responsibilities—determined by statute—have varied over its existence. Historically weaker than their contemporaries around the United States, the secretary does not oversee elections in the state. They lead the Department of Secretary of State and sit on the North Carolina Council of State.

==History of the office==
In 1665, the Lord Proprietors of the Province of Carolina created the office of the Colonial Secretary of Carolina. The inaugural secretary, Richard Cobthrop, never travelled to America, but most of the subsequent 23 secretaries came to Carolina. In 1675, the secretary became responsible to the King of England, and was largely tasked with clerical duties relating to land ownership. Following the United States Declaration of Independence, North Carolina created a constitution in 1776 which provided for the North Carolina General Assembly to &quot;triennially appoint a secretary for this State.&quot; The Assembly appointed James Glasgow to the office in December and reappointed him the following year. He held the office for over 20 years before resigning due to allegations that he had issued fraudulent land warrants. William Hill served as secretary from 1811 to 1857, setting the record tenure for the office until the 20th century. When the North Carolina State House caught fire in 1831, he saved many of the office&#x27;s records.

In 1868, North Carolina created a new constitution, which provided for the popular election of the secretary of state with four-year terms and no term limits. Thad A. Eure held the office from 1936 to 1989, setting the latest record tenure. Most secretaries of the state have come from eastern North Carolina. Rufus L. Edmisten, sworn-in in 1989, was the first one to come from the western portion of the state. Janice H. Faulkner, appointed by the Governor of North Carolina in 1996 to fill the vacancy created by Edmisten&#x27;s resignation, became the first woman to hold the office. Elaine Marshall, who assumed the office in 1997, was the first woman ever elected to a North Carolina statewide executive office. Since the passage of the Executive Reorganization Act of 1971, the secretary&#x27;s agency has been the Department of Secretary of State.

The office&#x27;s responsibilities—determined by statute—have varied over its existence. The secretariat managed the issuance of land grants from its colonial creation until 1957. In 1831, the secretary was briefly designated state librarian. In 1868, a Bureau of Statistics, Agriculture, and Immigration was placed within the office and remained there until a separate Department of Agriculture was created in 1877. The office has also at times been responsible for insurance regulation, vehicle registration, and collection of the state gas tax. Until the General Assembly was moved to the State Legislative Building and given a professional staff in the 1960s, the secretary was responsible for assisting it in several matters, including seating assignment in the legislative chambers, enrolling acts and resolutions before their ratification, and indexing and printing the session laws. A 1968 constitutional study commission recommended making the governor responsible for the selection of the secretary to reduce voters&#x27; burden by shortening the ballot, but this proposal was disregarded by the General Assembly when it revised the state constitution in 1971. The State Board of Elections briefly operated under the secretary from 1971 to 1972.

==Powers, duties, and structure==
The secretary of state is a constitutional officer. Article III, Section 7, of the Constitution of North Carolina stipulates the popular election of the secretary of state every four years. The office holder is not subject to term limits. In the event of a vacancy in the office, the Governor of North Carolina has the authority to appoint a successor until a candidate is elected at the next general election for members of the General Assembly. Per Article III, Section 8 of the constitution, the secretary sits on the Council of State. They maintain the schedule and agenda of council meetings. They are &quot;ex officio&quot; a member of the Local Government Commission and Capital Planning Commission. They are fourth in line of succession to the governor. 

Historically, the North Carolina Secretary of State has been weaker than their contemporaries around the United States. Unlike in other states, where the secretary of state serves as the chief elections officer, in North Carolina the State Board of Elections administers elections independently of other agencies. With regards to elections, the secretary is responsible for storing official copies of election results sent to them by the State Board of Elections and arranging the meeting of North Carolina&#x27;s presidential electors every four years. The secretary is charged with attending sessions of the General Assembly to obtain possession of laws passed by it, and maintains the official journals of each house. They also administer the North Carolina Securities Act and the Uniform Commercial Code, charter corporations, register trademarks, manage land records, and register legislative lobbyists. They are empowered to investigate violations of lobbying laws and impose civil fines not exceeding $5,000 for infractions. The secretary commissions notaries public in the state, and they are empowered to administer oaths of office to public officials and law enforcement officers. They attend the ceremonies in which an outgoing governor turns over the Great Seal of North Carolina to their successor.

The Department of Secretary of State has several divisions and sections: corporations division, publications division, securities division, trademarks section, Uniform Commercial Code section, authentications section, charitable solicitation licensing section, land records section, lobbyist compliance division, and notary public section. As of December 2022, the department has 163 employees retained under the terms of the State Human Resources Act. As with all Council of State officers, the secretary of state&#x27;s salary is fixed by the General Assembly and cannot be reduced during their term of office. In 2022, the secretary&#x27;s annual salary was $146,421.

<doc id="499755" wikidata="Q271377" url="?curid=499755" title="Ælfric of Eynsham">
<text>Ælfric of Eynsham (; ; ) was an English abbot and a student of Æthelwold of Winchester, and a consummate, prolific writer in Old English of hagiography, homilies, biblical commentaries, and other genres. He is also known variously as &quot;Ælfric the Grammarian&quot; (&quot;Alfricus Grammaticus&quot;), &quot;Ælfric of Cerne&quot;, and &quot;Ælfric the Homilist&quot;. In the view of Peter Hunter Blair, he was &quot;a man comparable both in the quantity of his writings and in the quality of his mind even with Bede himself.&quot; According to Claudio Leonardi, he &quot;represented the highest pinnacle of Benedictine reform and Anglo-Saxon literature&quot;.

==Life and works==
Ælfric was educated in the Benedictine Old Minster at Winchester under Saint Æthelwold, who was bishop there from 963 to 984. Æthelwold had carried on the tradition of Dunstan in his government of the abbey of Abingdon, then in Berkshire, and at Winchester he continued his strenuous support for the English Benedictine Reform. He seems to have actually taken part in the teaching activities of the abbey.

Ælfric no doubt gained some reputation as a scholar at Winchester, for when, in 987, the abbey of Cerne (at Cerne Abbas in Dorset) was finished, he was sent by Bishop Ælfheah (Alphege), Æthelwold&#x27;s successor, at the request of the chief benefactor of the abbey, the ealdorman Æthelmær the Stout, to teach the Benedictine monks there. This date (987) is one of only two certain dates we have for Ælfric, who was then in priest&#x27;s orders. Æthelmaer and his father Æthelweard were both enlightened patrons of learning, and became Ælfric&#x27;s faithful friends.

It was at Cerne, and partly at the desire, it appears, of Æthelweard, that he planned the two series of his English homilies, compiled from the Christian fathers, and dedicated to Sigeric, Archbishop of Canterbury from 990 to 994. (The series were edited by Benjamin Thorpe and published in 1844–1846 for the Ælfric Society and edited more recently by Malcolm Godden and Peter Clemoes for the Early English Text Society.) The Latin preface to the first series enumerates some of Ælfric&#x27;s authorities, the chief of whom was Gregory the Great, but the short list by no means exhausts the authors whom he consulted. In the preface to the first volume he regrets that, except for Alfred&#x27;s translations, Englishmen had no means of learning the true doctrine as expounded by the Latin fathers. John Earle (&quot;Anglo-Saxon Literature&quot;, 1884) thinks he aimed at correcting the apocryphal, and to modern ideas superstitious, teaching of the earlier Blickling Homilies. He may also have translated the Pseudo-Basilian &quot;Admonition to a Spiritual Son&quot;.

The first series of forty homilies is devoted to plain and direct exposition of the chief events of the Christian year; the second deals more fully with church doctrine and history. Ælfric&#x27;s teaching on the Eucharist in the &quot;Canons&quot; and in the &quot;&quot; (ibid. ii.262 seq.) was appealed to by the Protestant Reformation writers as a proof that the early English church did not hold the Roman doctrine of transubstantiation. Ælfric of Eynsham also denied the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary.

After the two series of homilies, around 995 he wrote three works to help students learn Latin – the &quot;Grammar&quot;, the &quot;Glossary&quot; and the &quot;Colloquy&quot;. First compiling, or overseeing the compilation of a Latin grammar, known as the &quot;Excerptiones de Prisciano&quot;, from Priscian&#x27;s &quot;Institutiones grammaticae&quot; and Donatus&#x27;s &quot;Ars maior&quot;, Ælfric then adapted this Latin grammar into English, creating what is considered the first vernacular Latin grammar in medieval Europe. In his glossary the words are not in alphabetical order, but grouped by topics. Finally, his &quot;Colloquy&quot; was intended to help students to learn how to speak Latin through a conversation manual. It is safe to assume that the original draft of this, afterwards maybe enlarged by his pupil and copyist, Ælfric Bata, was by Ælfric, and represents what his own scholar days were like.

A third series of homilies, the &quot;Lives of the Saints&quot; (hagiography), dates from 996 to 997. Some of the sermons in the second series had been written in a kind of rhythmical, alliterative prose, and in the &quot;Lives of the Saints&quot; the practice is so regular that most of them are arranged as verse by their editor W. W. Skeat. Appended to the &quot;Lives of the Saints&quot; there are two homilies, &quot;On False Gods&quot; and &quot;The Twelve Abuses&quot;. The first one shows how the Church was still fighting against the ancient religion of Britain, but also against the religion of the Danish invaders.

Ælfric was asked by Æthelweard to translate the Book of Genesis up to the story of Abraham and Isaac, along with selections from other books of the Hexateuch. Against his better judgment, Ælfric agreed because he knew it would be done regardless of whether he helped or not. This, the &quot;Old English Hexateuch&quot;, was revolutionary, for it was the first time that the Old Testament was translated from Latin into Old English. To his translation of Genesis, he wrote a preface. This preface was to ensure that readers understand they ought not believe that the practices of the ancient Israelites were still acceptable for Christians. In his preface, Ælfric employs the same writing techniques that King Alfred used in his preface to a translation of the &quot;Cura Pastoralis&quot; by Pope Gregory I. Also notable is that in his translation of Genesis Ælfric did not just translate it word for word from the Latin, which was common due to the belief that the word order of sacred Scripture was itself sacred. Rather, he translated much of it by its meaning.

There is no certain proof that he remained at Cerne. It has been suggested that this part of his life was chiefly spent at Winchester; but his writings for the patrons of Cerne, and the fact that he wrote in 998 his &quot;Canons&quot; as a pastoral letter for Wulfsige, the bishop of Sherborne, the diocese in which the abbey was situated, afford presumption of continued residence there.

1005 is the other certain date we have for Ælfric, when he left Cerne for nobleman Æthelmær&#x27;s new monastery in Eynsham in Oxfordshire, a long eighty-five-mile journey inland. Here he lived out his life as Eynsham&#x27;s first abbot, from 1005 until his death. After his elevation, he wrote his &quot;Letter to the Monks of Eynsham&quot;, an abridgment for his own monks of Æthelwold&#x27;s &quot;De consuetudine monachorum&quot;, adapted to their rudimentary ideas of monastic life; a letter to Wulfgeat of Ylmandun; an introduction to the study of the Old and New Testaments (about 1008, edited by William L&#x27;Isle in 1623); a Latin life of his master Æthelwold; two pastoral letters for Wulfstan, archbishop of York and bishop of Worcester, in Latin and English; and an English version of Bede&#x27;s &quot;De Temporibus&quot;.

The last mention of Ælfric Abbot, probably the grammarian, is in a will dating from about 1010.

Ælfric left careful instructions to future scribes to copy his works carefully because he did not want his works&#x27; words marred by the introduction of unorthodox passages and scribal errors. Through the centuries, however, Ælfric&#x27;s sermons were threatened by Viking axes and human neglect when – some seven hundred years after their composition – they nearly perished in London&#x27;s Cotton Library fire that scorched or destroyed close to 1,000 invaluable ancient works.

Ælfric was the most prolific writer in Old English. His main theme is God&#x27;s mercy. He writes, for example: &quot;The love that loves God is not idle. Instead, it is strong and works great things always. And if love isn’t willing to work, then it isn’t love. God’s love must be seen in the actions of our mouths and minds and bodies. A person must fulfil God’s word with goodness.&quot; (&quot;For Pentecost Sunday&quot;)

He also observes in &quot;For the Sixth Day (Friday) in the Third Week of Lent&quot; and in &quot;For the First Sunday After Pentecost&quot;: &quot;And we ought to worship with true humility if we want our heavenly God to hear us because God is the one who lives in a high place and yet has regard for the deep down humble, and God is always near to those who sincerely call to him in their trouble. . . . Without humility no person can thrive in the Lord.&quot;

And in the &quot;Fifth Sunday After Pentecost&quot; he wrote: &quot;Bosses who cannot permit those working under them to know kindness during this life of labour should never themselves enjoy lives of luxury because they could easily be kind to their workers every day. And then they would have some kindness in their souls. God loves kindness&quot;.

Contrast this leitmotif of God&#x27;s mercy with Archbishop Wulfstan&#x27;s trenchant pulpiteering and thundering sermons. Ælfric by no means expressed the popular opinion of the time. His forward-thinking views toward women (though they were not &#x27;modern&#x27; views, by any stretch of the imagination) and his strong stance on &#x27;clǽnnes&#x27;, or purity, were more extreme than others during that time (see for instance his homily on Judith). This was, no doubt, related to his service under the monastic reformer Saint Æthelwold in the monastery at Winchester.

A Blue Plaque was unveiled in Eynsham, in recognition of Ælfric’s work, in 2022.

==Identification==
Until the end of the nineteenth century, the true identification of Ælfric had been problematic, primarily because Ælfric had often been confused with Ælfric of Abingdon, who served as Archbishop of Canterbury. Though Ælfric had formerly been identified with the archbishop, thanks to the work of Lingard and Dietrich, most modern scholars now identify Ælfric as holding no higher office than abbot of Eynsham. However, in the past, there have been attempts to identify him with three different people:

(1) As above, Ælfric was identified with Ælfric of Abingdon (995–1005), Archbishop of Canterbury. This view was upheld by John Bale; by Humfrey Wanley; by Elizabeth Elstob; and by Edward Rowe Mores, &quot;Ælfrico, Dorobernensi, archiepiscopo, Commentarius&quot; (ed. G. J. Thorkelin, 1789), in which the conclusions of earlier writers on Ælfric are reviewed. Mores made him abbot of St Augustine&#x27;s at Dover, and finally archbishop of Canterbury.

(2) Sir Henry Spelman, in his &quot;Concina …&quot; printed the &quot;Canones ad Wulsinum episcopum&quot; and suggested Ælfric Putta or Putto, Archbishop of York, as the author, adding some note of others bearing the name. The identity of Ælfric the grammarian with Ælfric archbishop of York was also discussed by Henry Wharton, in &quot;Anglia Sacra&quot;.

(3) William of Malmesbury suggested that he was Abbot of Malmesbury and Bishop of Crediton.

The main facts of his career were finally elucidated by Eduard Dietrich in a series of articles in the &quot;Zeitschrift für historische Theologie&quot;, which formed the basis of subsequent writings on the subject.

<doc id="499759" wikidata="Q453839" url="?curid=499759" title="Paul Strand">
<text>Paul Strand (October 16, 1890 – March 31, 1976) was an American photographer and filmmaker who, along with fellow modernist photographers like Alfred Stieglitz and Edward Weston, helped establish photography as an art form in the 20th century. In 1936, he helped found the Photo League, a cooperative of photographers who banded together around a range of common social and creative causes. His diverse body of work, spanning six decades, covers numerous genres and subjects throughout the Americas, Europe, and Africa.

==Background==
Paul Strand was born Nathaniel Paul Stransky on October 16, 1890, in New York; his Bohemian parents were merchant Jacob Stransky and Matilda Stransky (née Arnstein). When Paul was 12, his father gave him a camera as a present.

==Career==

In his late teens, he was a student of renowned documentary photographer Lewis Hine at the Ethical Culture Fieldston School. It was while on a field trip in this class that Strand first visited the 291 art gallery – operated by Stieglitz and Edward Steichen – where exhibitions of work by forward-thinking modernist photographers and painters would move Strand to take his photographic hobby more seriously. Stieglitz later promoted Strand&#x27;s work in the 291 gallery itself, in his photography publication &quot;Camera Work&quot;, and in his artwork in the Hieninglatzing studio. Some of this early work, like the well-known &quot;Wall Street&quot;, experimented with formal abstractions (influencing, among others, Edward Hopper and his idiosyncratic urban vision). Other of Strand&#x27;s works reflect his interest in using the camera as a tool for social reform. When taking portraits, he would often mount a false brass lens to the side of his camera while photographing using a second working lens hidden under his arm. This meant that Strand&#x27;s subjects likely had no idea he was taking their picture. It was a move some criticized.

===Photo League===
Strand was one of the founders of the Photo League, an association of photographers who advocated using their art to promote social and political causes. Strand and Elizabeth McCausland were &quot;particularly active&quot; in the League, with Strand serving as &quot;something of an elder statesman.&quot; Both Strand and McCausland were &quot;clearly left-leaning,&quot; with Strand &quot;more than just sympathetic to Marxist ideas.&quot; Strand, McCausland, Ansel Adams, and Nancy Newhall all contributed to the League&#x27;s publication, &quot;Photo News&quot;.

===Still photography and filmmaking===
Over the next few decades, Strand worked in motion pictures as well as still photography. His first film was &quot;Manhatta&quot; (1921), also known as &quot;New York the Magnificent&quot;, a silent film showing the day-to-day life of New York City made with painter/photographer Charles Sheeler. &quot;Manhatta&quot; includes a shot similar to Strand&#x27;s famous &quot;Wall Street&quot; (1915) photograph. In 1932–35, he lived in Mexico and worked on &quot;Redes&quot; (1936), a film commissioned by the Mexican government, released in the US as &quot;The Wave&quot;. Other films he was involved with were the documentary &quot;The Plow That Broke the Plains&quot; (1936) and the pro-union, anti-fascist &quot;Native Land&quot; (1942).

From 1933 to 1952, Strand had no darkroom of his own and used those of others.

===Communism===
In December 1947, the Photo League appeared on the Attorney General&#x27;s List of Subversive Organizations (AGLOSO).

In 1948, CBS commissioned Strand to contribute a photo for an advertisement captured &quot;It is Now Tomorrow&quot;: Strand&#x27;s photo showed television antennas atop New York City.

On January 17, 1949, Strand signed in support of Communist Party leaders (Benjamin J. Davis Jr., Eugene Dennis, William Z. Foster, John Gates, Gil Green (politician), Gus Hall, Irving Potash, Jack Stachel, Robert G. Thompson, John Williamson, Henry Winston, Carl Winter) in the Smith Act trials, along with Lester Cole, Martha Dodd, W. E. B. Du Bois, Henry Pratt Fairchild, Howard Fast, Shirley Graham, Robert Gwathmey, E.Y. Harburg, Joseph H. Levy, Albert Maltz, Philip Morrison, Clarence Parker, Muriel Rukeyser, Alfred K. Stern (husband of Martha Dodd), Max Weber, and Henry Wilcox.

===Later years in Europe===

In June 1949, Strand left the United States to present &quot;Native Land&quot; at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in Czechoslovakia. The remaining 27 years of his life were spent in Orgeval, France, where, despite never learning the language, he maintained an impressive, creative life, assisted by his third wife, fellow photographer Hazel Kingsbury Strand.

Although Strand is best known for his early abstractions, his return to still photography in this later period produced some of his most significant work in the form of six book &quot;portraits&quot; of place: &quot;Time in New England&quot; (1950), &quot;La France de Profil&quot; (1952), &quot;Un Paese&quot; (featuring photographs of Luzzara and the Po River Valley in Italy, Einaudi, 1955), &quot;Tir a&#x27;Mhurain / Outer Hebrides&quot; (1962), &quot;Living Egypt&quot; (1969, with James Aldridge) and &quot;Ghana: An African Portrait&quot; (with commentary by Basil Davidson; 1976).

==Personal life==

Strand married the painter Rebecca Salsbury on January 21, 1922. He photographed her frequently, sometimes in unusually intimate, closely cropped compositions. Following their divorce in 1933, Strand met Virginia Stevens and married her in 1936. They divorced in 1950. He married Hazel Kingsbury in 1951 and they remained married until his death in 1976.&quot;

The timing of Strand&#x27;s departure to France is coincident with the first libel trial of his friend Alger Hiss, with whom he maintained a correspondence until his death. Although he was never officially a member of the Communist Party, many of Strand&#x27;s collaborators were either Party members (James Aldridge; Cesare Zavattini) or prominent left-leaning writers and activists (Basil Davidson). Many of his friends were also Communists or suspected of being so (Member of Parliament D. N. Pritt; film director Joseph Losey; Scottish poet Hugh MacDiarmid; actor Alex McCrindle). Strand was also closely involved with Frontier Films, one of more than 20 organizations that were identified as &quot;subversive&quot; and &quot;un-American&quot; by the US Attorney General. When he was asked by an interviewer why he decided to go to France, Strand began by noting that in America, at the time of his departure, &quot;McCarthyism was becoming rife and poisoning the minds of an awful lot of people.&quot;

During the 1950s, and owing to a printing process that was reportedly only available in that country at the time, Strand insisted that his books be printed in Leipzig, East Germany, even if it meant they were initially banned in the American market on account of their Communist provenance.
Following Strand&#x27;s move to Europe, it was later revealed in de-classified intelligence files, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act and now preserved at the Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona, that he was closely monitored by security services.

==Legacy==
In 1984 Strand was posthumously inducted into the International Photography Hall of Fame and Museum.

The highest price reached by a Strand photograph in the art market was by &quot;Akeley Motion Picture Camera&quot; (1922), who sold by $783,750 at Christie&#x27;s New York, on 4 April 2013.

<text>Hong Kong Wetland Park is a conservation, education and tourism facility, located at the northern part of Tin Shui Wai, in Yuen Long. It was to be an ecological mitigation area (EMA) for the wetlands lost due to Tin Shui Wai New Town development, in the New Territories.

The Hong Kong Wetland Park comprises a visitor centre, Wetland Interactive World, and a Wetland Reserve. The Wetland Interactive World has themed exhibition galleries, a theatre, a souvenir shop, an indoor play area (swamp adventure) and a resource centre.

== History ==
In 1998, a project named International Wetland Park and Visitor Centre Feasibility Study was initiated by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department and the Hong Kong Tourism Board with a view to expanding the ecological mitigation area to a wetland ecotourism attraction. After concluding that it was feasible to develop a Wetland Park at the site without compromising its ecological mitigation functions, and that development of the Wetland Park would also enhance the ecological function of the site to a conservation, education and tourism facility, the concerned parties started the Wetland Park Project, which is one of the Millennium projects of the Administrations.

In 2007, the park was one of five winners of the Awards for Excellence: Asia Pacific Competition, from the Urban Land Institute.
==Facilities==
Themed exhibition galleries with floor areas ranging from showcase the importance of wetland on biodiversity, civilisation and conservation. Visitors can learn more about the native flora and fauna of Hong Kong through the animals and models displayed in the Living Wetland Gallery, such as false gharial, mouse deer and green turtle.


The Wetland Reserve consists of re-created habitats designed for water fowls and other wildlife. The Wetland Discovery Centre, located in the Wetland Reserve, provides visitors more hands-on experience on local wetlands. Other facilities include Stream Walk, Succession Walk, Mangrove Boardwalk and three bird hides situated next to the fish pond, mudflat and riverside, leading visitors to venture habitats of wildlife such as fiddler crab, mudskipper and the rare black-faced spoonbill.

==Pui Pui Home==

Pui Pui is a crocodile&#x27;s name, which is a Chinese pun indicating that it came from Shan Pui River and is the apple of the public&#x27;s eye.

On 29 August 2006, she was moved into her landscaped enclosure and can be easily viewed by the public. Pui Pui&#x27;s Home was designed to provide the reptile with a healthy and comfortable living environment.

The outdoor enclosure is , of which 70% is pool area. With a maximum depth of , the pool is landscaped with plants to provide sheltered areas, hiding places and basking areas for the reptile. Outdoor facilities include some infra-red heaters, a heat pad and a weighing scale. Water in the pool is continuously circulated through a filtration system.

==Transportation==

Wetland Park is served by the MTR Light Rail, and the Wetland Park stop and Tin Sau stop belong to Zone 5A for single-ride ticket.

<text>The Saeima () is the parliament of the Republic of Latvia. It is a unicameral parliament consisting of 100 members who are elected by proportional representation, with seats allocated to political parties which gain at least 5% of the popular vote. Elections are scheduled to be held once every four years, normally on the first Saturday of October. The most recent elections were held in October 2022.

The President of Latvia can dismiss the Saeima and request early elections. The procedure for dismissing it involves substantial political risk to the president, including a risk of loss of office. On 28 May 2011 president Valdis Zatlers decided to initiate the dissolution of the Saeima, which was approved in a referendum, and the Saeima was dissolved on 23 July 2011.

The current Speaker of the Saeima is Daiga Mieriņa of the Union of Greens and Farmers party. The basic document that regulates the proceedings of the parliament is the Rules of Order of &quot;Saeima&quot; (&quot;Saeimas kārtības rullis&quot;, also Rules of Procedure), adopted 23 March 1923 with amendments in 1929 and 1994.

==History and etymology==
The Saeima traces its origins to the Sejm of the Kingdom of Poland, which led to the creation of the Sejm (Seimas) of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and later to the creation of the Sejm of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Polish Livonia, a part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, was exposed to the Polish mode of administration and introduced to the Sejm-system. The Warsaw Sejm of 1677 settled the case of remaining part of Polish Livonia or Latgale (), naming it a voivodeship and a duchy, with the right to name three senators: the Bishop, the Voivode and the Castellan of Inflanty (...) Local sejmiks took place at Daugavpils, while starostas resided at Daugavpils, Ludza, Rēzekne and Viļaka. The voivodeship had six deputies to the Sejm, but only two of them came from Inflanty, the other four were symbolically named by the king, to remember the lost part of Livonia (Swedish Livonia). However, the rest of Latvia belonged to the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, which was governed by the Dukes and the Landtag of Courland.

The word &quot;sejm&quot; derives from the verb &quot;sjąć się&quot; meaning &quot;to get together&quot;, with similar words in some other Slavic languages, of proto-Slavic origin *sъjęti &lt; *sъjemti Sejm, then, as a noun meant &quot;a gathering, a meeting, a council.&quot;
In the 19th century, as the concept of nations began to emerge, Juris Alunāns, a member of a Latvian nationalist group called the Young Latvians, claimed ownership to the word &quot;saeims&quot;. Despite the similar sound, similar semantic structure and clear historical connotations, he claimed that it was a purely Latvian word that he had invented. As mentioned earlier, the word bears a similar meaning: &quot;a gathering, a meeting, a council&quot;. 
He claimed that the word he constructed stemmed from the archaic Latvian word &quot;eima&quot; instead, meaning &quot;to go&quot; (derived from the PIE &quot;*ei&quot; &quot;to go&quot; and also a cognate with the Ancient Greek &quot;eimi&quot;, Gaulish &quot;&quot;, among others).

He could not explain, however, how the s- prefix got added to the word, and what sense this addition made within the limits of the Latvian language. Nevertheless, according to Alunāns, the word is purely Latvian and completely independent of the aforementioned historical context. However, the prefix sa- to a verb in modern Latvian language usually stands for a complete action and the word &quot;Saeima&quot; can stand for a meaning &quot;let&#x27;s gather together completely&quot;.

In the pre-war Latvia, the Saeima was elected for three-year terms. The 1st Saeima met from 7 November 1922 to 2 November 1925, the 2nd from 3 November 1925 to 5 November 1928, the 3rd from 6 November 1928 to 2 November 1931, and the 4th from 3 November 1931 to 15 May 1934 (date of the Latvian coup d&#x27;état).

==Elections==

The Saeima is an entirely elected body. All Latvian citizens (including naturalized citizens) over the age of 18 are eligible to vote. Candidates must be qualified to vote, but must also be over 21, must not be former employees of the USSR and Latvian SSR State security services, intelligence or counter-intelligence services or any other foreign affiliated organizations, must not have been convicted of a criminal offence or deemed to be of diminished mental capacity.

The term of the Saeima is four years. An election may be called early, but doing so is more complicated than in other parliamentary democracies. If the President proposes that the Saeima be dissolved, a national referendum must be held to confirm the dissolution. If the dissolution is not approved, the President is removed from office. If one-tenth of the electorate signs a petition demanding a dissolution, a referendum can be held without the involvement of the President.

There are five constituencies, Kurzeme (12 deputies), Latgale (14), Riga (35), Vidzeme (25), and Zemgale (14). Overseas votes are counted for the Riga constituency.

Seats are distributed in each constituency by open list proportional representation among the parties that overcome a 5% national election threshold using an unmodified version of the Webster/Sainte-Laguë method.

Voters cast a vote for a party list, which consists of the candidates that the party has submitted in that constituency. Although a specific ordering is listed for each candidate, which is determined by the party, this has no effect on the actual chances of each candidate. Instead, voters cast &quot;specific votes&quot; for candidates. These votes can be either positive votes or negative votes. The number of votes for each candidate is determined by taking the number of votes for the respective list, and adding it to the candidate&#x27;s positive votes, before subtracting the number of negative votes for that candidate. The candidates with the highest number of votes fill the party&#x27;s seats. A positive vote is indicated by drawing a plus sign (+) next to the candidate&#x27;s name on the ballot paper. A negative vote is indicated by crossing out the candidate&#x27;s name. Voters may only cast specific votes for the candidates on the list that they voted for.

It is uncommon for any party to achieve more than 30% of the vote in an election. The record is 32.4% for the Latvian Way party in the 1993 election. This means that a coalition has always been necessary.

If a seat falls vacant during a term of the Saeima, it is filled by the next candidate on the appropriate list.

The Communist Party of Latvia is the only political party that is banned.

<doc id="499766" wikidata="Q7054613" url="?curid=499766" title="North Carolina State Treasurer">
<text>The North Carolina State Treasurer is a statewide elected office in the U.S. state of North Carolina responsible for overseeing the financial operations of state government. The current state treasurer is Brad Briner.

The office of state treasurer has existed since 1715 in the Province of North Carolina; at that time, the treasurer was appointed by the lower house of the legislature. In 1740, the treasurer&#x27;s office was divided into two districts, and in 1779, into four. In 1784, the North Carolina General Assembly brought the treasurers under one single office, appointed jointly by both houses of the legislature.

Under the North Carolina Constitution of 1868, the treasurer became a position elected by popular vote, rather than appointed.

The North Carolina State Treasurer is an ex officio member of the North Carolina State Board of Education, the State Board of Community Colleges, the State Banking Commission, and the Council of State.

== History of the office ==

The Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina, adopted in 1669, provided for a treasurer to handle &quot;all matters that concern the public revenue and treasury&quot; with the assistance of 6 undertreasurers and 12 auditors. Despite this, early colonial governors of the Province of Carolina acted as their own treasurers due to minimal revenue. After the province incurred large debts during Cary&#x27;s Rebellion and the Tuscarora War, the governor and his council appointed treasurers for each of the seven precincts of the province in 1711. In 1714 Governor Edward Hyde appointed Edward Moseley as treasurer of North Carolina and overseer of all precinct treasurers. He held the office until 1735, when he was made responsible for overseeing the &quot;southern district&quot; and William Downing was made responsible for the &quot;northern district&quot;. The split system continued with different officeholders until 1776, when the North Carolina General Assembly required all treasurers to be appointed by themselves and barred them from holding other public offices. 

In 1779 and 1782, four and one additional treasury districts were respectively added, bring the total number to seven. In 1784, the positions were folded into one office located in Hillsborough with a two-year term on a salary. Memucan Hunt was the first person to hold the new office. In 1795, the state treasury was relocated to Raleigh, the new capital of the state, and some of the treasurer&#x27;s bookkeeping functions were given to the state comptroller. In 1868 North Carolina ratified a new constitution which stipulated that the office be filled by a popularly elected candidate with four-year terms. From 1887 to 1899, the treasurer was responsible for oversight of the state banking industry.

North Carolina received a triple A bond credit rating for the first time in the early 1960s—during the tenure of State Treasurer Edwin M. Gill—and maintained the rating throughout the rest of his time in office. The Department of State Treasurer was created by the General Assembly in 1971. John Haywood, who served for 40 years from 1787 until 1827, was the longest-tenured treasurer. Janet Cowell, who assumed office in 2009, was the first woman to serve as state treasurer. The incumbent, Brad Briner, has served as treasurer since January 2, 2025.

== Powers, duties, and structure ==

The state treasurer is a constitutional officer. Article III, Section 7, of the Constitution of North Carolina stipulates the popular election of the treasurer every four years. The office holder is not subject to term limits. In the event of a vacancy in the office, the Governor of North Carolina has the authority to appoint a successor until a candidate is elected at the next general election for members of the General Assembly. They sit on the North Carolina Council of State and are &quot;ex officio&quot; chairman of the State Banking Commission, member of the State Board of Education, and member of the State Board of Community Colleges. They are sixth in line of succession to the governor.

The treasurer leads the Department of State Treasurer, which has six divisions: Retirement Systems Division, State Health Plan Division, Investment Management Division, State and Local Government Finance Division, Financial Operations Division, and Unclaimed Property Division. The Local Government Commission is a subagency of the department and the treasurer serves &quot;ex officio&quot; as chairman of the body. The treasurer is the sole fiduciary of the governmental employee pension fund and manages the State Health Plan. As with all Council of State officers, the treasurer&#x27;s salary is fixed by the General Assembly and cannot be reduced during their term of office. In 2022, the treasurer&#x27;s annual salary was $146,421.

<text>Standard Chartered PLC is a British multinational bank with operations in wealth management, corporate and investment banking, and treasury services. Despite being headquartered in the United Kingdom, it does not conduct retail banking in the UK, and around 90% of its profits come from Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.

Standard Chartered has a primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. It has secondary listings on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the National Stock Exchange of India, and OTC Markets Group Pink. Its largest shareholder is the Government of Singapore-owned Temasek Holdings. The Financial Stability Board considers it a systemically important bank.

José Viñals is the group chairman of Standard Chartered. Bill Winters is the current group chief executive. Diego De Giorgi is the current group chief financial officer.

==Name==
The name Standard Chartered comes from the names of the two banks that merged in 1969 to create it: The Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, and Standard Bank of British South Africa.

==History==
===Predecessors===
====Chartered Bank====

The Chartered Bank began when Queen Victoria granted a royal charter to Scotsman James Wilson in 1853. Chartered opened its first branches in Bombay, Calcutta, and Shanghai in 1858; branches in Hong Kong and Singapore followed in 1859. The bank started issuing banknotes denominated in Hong Kong dollars in 1862.

====Standard Bank====

The Standard Bank was a British bank founded in the Cape Province of South Africa in 1862 by Scot, John Paterson. Having established a considerable number of branches Standard was prominent in financing the development of the diamond fields of Kimberley from 1867 and later extended its network further north to the new town of Johannesburg when gold was discovered there in 1885. Half the output of the second largest gold field in the world passed through the Standard Bank on its way to London. Standard expanded widely in Africa over the years, but from 1883 to 1962 was formally known as the Standard Bank of South Africa. In 1962 the bank changed its name to Standard Bank Limited, and the South African operations became a separate subsidiary that took the parent bank&#x27;s previous name, Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd.

===1969 to 2000===

Both banks acquired other smaller banks along the way and spread their networks further. In 1969, the banks decided to merge and to counterbalance their network by expanding in Europe and the United States, while continuing expansion in their traditional markets in Asia and Africa.

In 1986, Lloyds made a hostile takeover bid for the Group. The bid was defeated; however, it spurred Standard Chartered into a period of change, including a series of divestments notably in the US and South Africa. It sold Union Bank to Bank of Tokyo and United Bank of Arizona to Citicorp.

In 1986, a business consortium purchased a 35% stake to fend off Lloyds. A member of this consortium was Singaporean property tycoon Khoo Teck Puat, who purchased 5% of the bank&#x27;s shares, which he later increased to 13.4%.

In 1987, Standard Chartered sold its remaining interests in the South African bank; since then the Standard Bank Group has been a separate entity.

In 1992, scandal broke when banking regulators charged several employees of Standard Chartered in Mumbai with illegally diverting depositors&#x27; funds to speculate in the stock market. Fines by Indian regulators and provisions for losses cost the bank almost £350 million, at that time fully a third of its capital.

In 1994, London&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Times&quot; reported that an executive in the bank&#x27;s metals division had bribed officials in Malaysia and the Philippines to win business. The bank, in a statement on 18 July 1994, acknowledged that there were &quot;discrepancies in expense claims [that] ... included gifts to individuals in certain countries to facilitate business, a practice contrary to bank rules&quot;.

In 1994, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission found Standard Chartered&#x27;s Asian investment bank to have illegally helped to artificially support the price of new shares they had underwritten for six companies from July 1991 to March 1993. The bank admitted the offence, apologized, and reorganized its brokerage units. The commission banned the bank from underwriting IPOs in Hong Kong for nine months.

In 1997, Standard Chartered sold Mocatta Bullion and Base Metals, its metals division, to Toronto-based Scotiabank for US$26 million.

Standard Chartered&#x27;s Asian investment banking operations never recovered. In 2000, the bank closed them down.

===2000 to 2010===

In 2000, Standard Chartered acquired Grindlays Bank from ANZ, increasing its presence in private banking and further expanding its operations in India and Pakistan. Standard Chartered retained Grindlays&#x27; private banking operations in London and Luxembourg, as well as the subsidiary in Jersey, all of which were integrated into its own private bank. This now serves high-net-worth customers in Hong Kong, Dubai, and Johannesburg under the name Standard Chartered Grindlays Offshore Financial Services.

Leading to the incorporation of Standard Chartered (Hong Kong) on 1 July 2004, the Legislative Council of Hong Kong amended Legal Tender Notes Issue Ordinance. The amendment replaced Standard Chartered Bank with its newly incorporated subsidiary - Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Ltd - as one of the note-issuing banks in Hong Kong. The same year, Standard Chartered Bank and Astra International (an Indonesian conglomerate, a subsidiary of Jardine Matheson) took over PermataBank and in 2006, both shareholders increased their joint ownership to 89.01%. With 276 branches and 549 ATMs in 55 cities throughout Indonesia, PermataBank has the second largest branch network in Standard Chartered organization.

On 15 April 2005, the bank acquired Korea First Bank, beating HSBC in the bid. The bank has since rebranded the branches as SC First Bank. Standard Chartered completed the integration of its Bangkok branch and Standard Chartered Nakornthon Bank in October, renaming the new entity Standard Chartered Bank (Thailand). Standard Chartered also formed strategic alliances with Fleming Family &amp; Partners to expand private wealth management in Asia and the Middle East, and acquired stakes in ACB in Vietnam, Travelex, American Express Bank (Bangladesh), and Bohai Bank (China). The largest shareholder, billionaire Khoo Teck Puat, died in 2004; and two years later, on 28 March 2006, the Singapore state-owned private investment firm, Temasek, became the bank&#x27;s largest shareholder when it bought the 11.55% stake held by Khoo Teck Puat&#x27;s estate.
On 9 August 2006, Standard Chartered announced it had acquired an 81% shareholding in the Union Bank of Pakistan in a deal ultimately worth $511 million. This deal represented the first acquisition by a foreign firm of a Pakistani bank. The merged bank, Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan), is now Pakistan&#x27;s sixth largest bank.

On 22 October 2006, Standard Chartered announced that it had received tenders for more than 51% of the issued share capital of Hsinchu International Bank (&quot;Hsinchu&quot;), established in 1948 in Hsinchu, Taiwan.

In 2007, Standard Chartered opened its Private Banking global headquarters in Singapore.

On 23 August 2007, Standard Chartered entered into an agreement to buy a 49% share of an Indian brokerage firm (UTI Securities) for $36 million in cash from Securities Trading Corporation of India Ltd., with the option to raise its stake to 75% in 2008, and, &quot;if&quot; both partners were in agreement, to 100% by 2010.

On 29 February 2008, Standard Chartered PLC announced it had received all the required approvals leading to the completion of its acquisition of American Express Bank Ltd (AEB) from the American Express Company (AXP). The total cash consideration for the acquisition is US$823 million.

On 13 November 2008, Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Limited, entered into an agreement with JPMorgan Cazenove to acquire 100% of Cazenove Asia Limited, an Asian equity capital markets, corporate finance, and institutional brokerage business.

On 27 November 2009, &quot;Dow Jones Financial News&quot; reported that Dubai will restructure its largest corporate entity. Among international banks, Standard Chartered has one of the largest loan portfolios in the Dubai market and the UAE as a whole, estimated to be $7.77 billion in total. This amounts to 4.2% of Standard Chartered&#x27;s total loans outstanding. Other impacted banks included HSBC, Barclays, and RBS. The bank stated that any impairment arising from this exposure would not be material.

===2010 to present===

Standard Chartered announced an agreement on 27 April 2010 to buy the African custody business from Barclays PLC. On 13 May 2010, Standard Chartered PLC launched the first-ever Indian Depository Receipt &quot;IDR&quot; offer.

On 17 June 2010, Standard Chartered Bank and the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) entered into a strategic alliance meant to strengthened their strategic partnership and identify joint business opportunities. Joint business and cooperation task forces were set up in October that year to define the direction of the partnership and explore joint ventures. The committee was to be co-chaired by Peter Sands, CEO of Standard Chartered, and Zhang Yun, President of ABC.

In December 2010, Standard Chartered was recognised as the Global Bank of the Year in &quot;The Banker&quot;″s Bank of the Year 2010 awards. Standard Chartered also was named The Banker&#x27;s inaugural winners of the Global and European Transaction Bank of the Year awards in September 2014, largely &quot;on the basis of its work in emerging markets, particularly Asia&quot;.

In January 2015, the company announced that it was exiting the money-losing &quot;equity capital markets business completely&quot;, &quot;becoming one of the first global banks&quot; to do so. In November that year, the bank announced that it would cut 15,000 jobs, including one thousand senior jobs, &quot;from managing director up to board executives&quot;. The cuts followed a change of CEO after profit warnings and money laundering fines in the first half of the year.

In 2016, Standard Chartered announced that it would stop providing loans to the midstream segment of the diamonds and jewellery industries. The announcement was the result of a review of the bank&#x27;s involvement in risky business sectors. In 2017, the bank was reported to have lost $400 million on risky diamond debt on a portfolio of loans that was once worth $3 billion. Owing to defaults of jewellery and diamond companies from 2013 onwards, Standard Chartered is currently estimated to have $1.7 billion of diamond debt still to be repaid.

The company received criticism in April 2017 from the Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS). The investor advisory firm told shareholders it was concerned that targets set for the top bosses in the bank&#x27;s long-term incentive plan (LTIP) were not demanding enough. Bill Winters, the chief executive, stands to net share awards with a face value of as much as £4.4m from the scheme, while Andy Halford, the chief financial officer, could receive £2.7m.

In February 2025 Standard Chartered, Animoca Brands and Hong Kong Telecom establish joint venture to issue a HKD-backed stablecoin.

====Money-laundering charges====
On 6 August 2012, the New York Department of Financial Services (DFS), led by Benjamin Lawsky, accused Standard Chartered of hiding $250 billion in transactions involving Iran, labelling it a &quot;rogue institution&quot;. The bank was ordered to appear and defend its actions, or risk losing its license to operate in the state of New York. The DFS said it had documents showing a cover up of transactions allegedly used to fund terrorist groups in the Middle East.

On 14 August 2012, Lawsky announced that the DFS and Standard Chartered reached a settlement that allows the bank to keep its licence to operate in New York. According to the terms of the settlement, the bank agreed to pay a $340 million fine.

The bank agreed to install a monitor to oversee the bank&#x27;s money laundering controls for at least two years, and appoint &quot;permanent officials who will audit the bank&#x27;s internal procedures to prevent offshore money laundering&quot;. The monitor will report directly to the DFS. Lawsky&#x27;s statement said &quot;the parties have agreed that the conduct at issue involved transactions of at least $250bn.&quot; The bank issued a statement confirming that a settlement with the DFS had been reached and that &quot;a formal agreement containing the detailed terms of the settlement is expected to be concluded shortly&quot;.

Other US agencies—including the Federal Reserve, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Treasury Department, and the Justice Department—had also begun investigations into the laundering allegations and were reportedly taken off guard by the speed of the settlement.

The Treasury stated that its own investigation of Standard Chartered will continue. Several financial analysts predicted that, due to its strong financial position, the bank would be able to easily cover the $900 million fine without having to raise extra capital.

On 6 August 2014, Lawsky was reported to be preparing a new action against Standard Chartered over computer system breakdowns and was &quot;discussing a potential settlement&quot;.

On 19 August 2014, the bank was fined $300 million by the New York Department of Financial Services for breach of money-laundering compliance related to potentially high-risk transactions involving Standard Chartered clients in Hong Kong and the UAE. The bank issued a statement accepting responsibility and regretting the deficiencies, at the same time noting the ruling would not jeopardize its U.S. licenses.

In April 2019, it was reported that Standard Chartered may have to pay approximately $1 billion to settle its ongoing investigations in the US and UK. Earlier in February the company had set aside $900 million towards resolution of violations of U.S. sanctions and forex trading regulations. The company also faces a penalty of roughly $134 million from the United Kingdom&#x27;s Financial Conduct Authority related to historical financial crime controls which takes the amount to over $1 billion.

==Financial technology==
===Standard Chartered Breeze===
Standard Chartered Breeze is a mobile banking application for the iPhone &amp; iPad that can also be used on the computer. It is largely similar to the online banking services offered by other banks, with the exception of its function to issue electronic bank cheques. Launched in the summer of 2010 and aggressively marketed, the reviews have been generally positive. In addition, it has attracted an uncommon amount of attention due to many innovative marketing strategies it used to promote its product, mostly focusing on social media. Standard Chartered Breeze organised a blogger&#x27;s meet for bloggers to preview Breeze, and its Twitter campaign to give away a free iPad was extremely successful.

===SuperCharger FinTech Accelerator===
Standard Chartered&#x27;s primary engagement with the fintech community is focused in Hong Kong, working closely with and co-ordinated by &#x27;The eXellerator&#x27;. The SuperCharger FinTech Accelerator, along with main partners, Standard Chartered Bank (a founding member) and Fidelity International, has twice conducted programmes enabling international growth-stage companies to expand their operations within Asia. Standard Chartered Bank has initiated proof of concept projects with two companies: Bambu and KYC Chain.

==Sponsorship==
In September 2009, it was announced that Standard Chartered had agreed to become the main sponsor of Liverpool Football Club for the period between July 2010 and the end of the 2013–14 football season, taking shirt sponsorship and various other branding rights. The sponsorship has been extended multiple times. First in 2013 to the end of the 2015–16 season, next in 2015 through the 2018–19 season, then again, in May 2018 that extends through the 2022–23 season and finally, in July 2022 that runs until the end of the 2026–27 season. 
The deal is estimated to be worth around £50 million per year by &quot;City A.M.&quot;, making it the joint-third most valuable sponsorship deal in the Premier League alongside Arsenal&#x27;s deal with Emirates and Chelsea&#x27;s deal with Yokohama. Standard Chartered is also the lead sponsor of the Singapore Marathon.

==Social responsibility==
The Priority Academy program was created in 2006 by the bank, with educational programmes including a study tour of Shanghai, a summer internship programme and a study seminar in the United States. The program donated $250,000 to Chan Yik Hei, a science amateur who won the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair, for his studies at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

In 2015, Standard Chartered was widely criticised for its $12bn funding of the controversial Carmichael Coal Mine, with a campaign led by Greenpeace calling for them to quit the project. The bank subsequently withdrew from the deal.

==Controversies==
===Breach of sanctions fines (2012)===
In August 2012, Standard Chartered agreed to pay $340 million to the New York State Department of Financial Services over charges that the bank worked with the government of Iran to hide $250 billion in transactions in order to evade sanctions.

In December 2012, Standard Chartered agreed to pay a $327 million fine for having hidden similar transactions with Iran, Myanmar, Libya, and Sudan.

===Money laundering, breach of sanctions fine (2019)===
On 9 April 2019, Standard Chartered paid $1.1 billion to the United Kingdom Government and the United States of America&#x27;s Department of the Treasury over deficiencies in the bank&#x27;s money laundering control regime and for violating financial sanctions against Myanmar, Zimbabwe, Cuba, Sudan, Syria, and Iran.

===OFSI fine (2020)===
In April 2020, Standard Chartered was fined £20.4 million by the UK&#x27;s Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation for loans to a Turkish bank DenizBank, which fell under E.U. financial sanctions on Russia due to its majority ownership by Russian bank Sberbank of Russia.

===Indian bank takeover fine (2020)===
In August 2020, Enforcement Directorate fined Standard Chartered $13.6 million for foreign exchange rule violations in its 2007 takeover of Tamilnad Mercantile Bank Limited.

===Delay of reporting fraud fine (2021)===
In January 2021, the Reserve Bank of India issued a fine of ₹2 crore of Standard Chartered Bank-India for delays in its mandatory regulatory fraud reporting.

=== South African rand manipulation (2023) ===
In November 2023, after an 8-year litigation, the Competition Commission fined Standard Chartered R42.7 million rand for various offences that related to manipulating the USD/ZAR currency pair which included the fixing of bids, offers, bid-offer spreads, the spot exchange rate and the fixing of the exchange rate at the FIX. Standard Chartered assumed liability for its actions in manipulating the rand between 2007 and 2013.

===Alleged terrorism funding (2024)===
Documents filed to a New York court in June 2024 claim that thousands of transactions worth more than $100 billion were carried out by the bank from 2008 to 2013 in breach of sanctions against Iran. The filings, which were provided by former SCB employee and whistleblower Julian Knight, state that the bank &quot;facilitated many billions of dollars in banking transactions for Iran, numerous international terror groups, and the front companies for those groups.&quot;

<text>The Little Nine Partners Patent was a land patent granted in 1706 in Dutchess County, New York, United States. It was the last of fourteen patents granted between 1685 and 1706 which came to cover the entirety of historic Dutchess County (which until 1812 included today&#x27;s Putnam County).

The first ten, granted between 1685 and 1697, covered almost all of Hudson River shoreline in the original county, with three - Rombouts, the Great Nine Partners, and Philipse Patents, extending significantly inland. The eleventh, and smallest, Cuyler, 1697, was the first to contain solely inland territory, just in from the Hudson. The twelfth, and next smallest, Fauconnier, in 1703, completed the Hudson River shoreline. The last two, Beekman, 1705, and the Little Nine Partners, 1706, laid claim to the remaining interior lands.

==History==
The patent was located in the northern part of the county, and comprises all or parts of the modern towns of Milan, Pine Plains, and North East. Roughly triangular in shape, it was bounded on the north by Columbia County, on the south by the Great Nine Partners Patent (1697) and on the west by the Schuyler (1686) and Rhinebeck (1697) patents. Its eastern boundary was the area known as The Oblong, a narrow strip of land along the eastern edge of Dutchess County, bordering the state of Connecticut.

===Partners===
There were eight original patentees of the Little Nine Partners Patent: 
* Sampson Broughton
* Rip Van Dam
* Thomas Wenham
* Roger Mompesson
* Peter Fauconier
* Augustine Graham
* Richard Sackett
* Robert Lurting

George Clarke subsequently bought a ninth share, becoming the ninth partner, but not a patentee.

===Allocation===
Although awarded in 1706, it was not until 1744 that the allocation of each of the nine partners was associated with a specific lot through a Dutchess County Court process that involved a lottery system, drawn by &quot;two boys...under the age of sixteen.&quot;

<text>Convolvulus is a genus of about 200 to 250 species of flowering plants in the bindweed family Convolvulaceae, with a cosmopolitan distribution. Common names include bindweed and [[morning glory]]; both are names shared with other closely related genera.

==Description==
They are annual or perennial herbaceous vines, bines and (a few species of) woody shrubs, growing to 0.3–3 m tall. The leaves are spirally arranged, and the flowers trumpet-shaped, mostly white or pink, but blue, violet, purple, or yellow in some species.

==Ecology==

Many of the species are invasive weeds; but others are cultivated for their attractive flowers, while some are globally threatened.

&quot;Convolvulus&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including the convolvulus hawk moth, the sweet potato leaf miner (&quot;Bedellia somnulentella&quot;) and the gem; the leaf miner &quot;Bucculatrix cantabricella&quot; feeds exclusively on &quot;C. cantabricus&quot;.

<text>MiniScribe Corporation was a manufacturer of disk storage products, founded in Longmont, Colorado in 1980. MiniScribe designed and sold stepper motor-based hard disk drives with a large amount of onboard logic for the time. They eventually moved into higher-profile voice coil motor designs, and won major contracts with IBM. Massive financial fraud starting in 1987 led to bankruptcy in 1990, when their assets were bought by Maxtor and renamed Maxtor Colorado Corporation.

==Foundation, early slump, and recapitalization==

The company was started by Terry Johnson, who had a 20-year career in the hard drive business at such companies as IBM, Memorex and Storage Technology Corporation. MiniScribe became a major player when it won a series of contracts to supply IBM&#x27;s PC division, and their subsequent rapid growth led to an initial public offering in late 1983, opening for trading in January 1984. However, slow sales of the IBM PC/XT led IBM to dramatically scale back their orders late that year, forcing MiniScribe to lay off 26% of its staff and causing the value of the stock to plummet. Johnson left the company; at the time he stated that he had been planning to do this for some time and that his departure had &quot;absolutely nothing&quot; to do with IBM. Johnson later said &quot;It&#x27;s a very low inertia industry, you can blow your way into it and get blown out of it very quickly&quot;. Roger Gower, who had been recently promoted to President, took over the CEO role as well.

Shortly thereafter the company was recapitalized with a $20 million investment from Hambrecht &amp; Quist (H&amp;Q), a venture capital firm. One of H&amp;Q&#x27;s officers was Quentin Thomas (&quot;QT&quot;) Wiles, a turnaround specialist nicknamed &quot;Dr. Fix-It&quot;. Wiles took over the CEO position from Gower, running the company remotely from his office in Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, with a management team made up primarily of accountants. The company soon returned to profitability, with sales increasing from $114 million at the height of IBM&#x27;s orders, to $603 million by 1988, when they were named the most well-managed company in the disk drive industry. Their major customer at this time was Compaq, but the company was also bidding for major contracts with Apple Computer and Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC).

==Fraud and failure==
In January 1987, the company officers conducted a quick inventory to estimate their accounts prior to an independent review by third party accounting firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand. Their internal inventory count showed that there was a shortfall of between $2 and $4 million. This implied the cost to produce those drives that did sell was higher than initially thought, which, if properly booked against sales, would mean their operating margins would be unimpressive. Instead of reporting this, a number of the managers decided to cover it up by various means. They produced an inflated inventory count, and then broke into the accountants&#x27; lock boxes and replaced their independent count to match their newly inflated numbers. The team continued to roll these numbers forward through the quarters, compounding the problem.

In July 1987, Jesse Parker, director of far east operations, told Wiles that something was amiss. In August, Wiles travelled to Hong Kong and Singapore where he found a complete loss of control. The inventory count from that autumn showed that the numbers had grown to $15 million, mostly in Colorado. A report was prepared to consider various solutions, but Wiles suggested that they continue hiding the problem, ordering all copies of the report be destroyed. This led to the company&#x27;s most infamous cover-up. The managers rented a second warehouse in Colorado, where they personally packed 26,000 bricks into hard drive boxes and shipped them to Singapore to bolster the inventory count. After the count was complete, they recalled those serial numbers as defective units. Instead of writing them off, they checked them into inventory, along with other failed drives that had been returned.

The company continued to post impressive numbers, but there were troubling signs. Among them the company continued to post improving operating margins while the rest of the hard drive industry was suffering from rapidly falling margins due to ongoing downward price pressure. In 1988 the board of directors became concerned when the company&#x27;s reported receivables grew dramatically, indicating a large amount of unpaid billables, while at the same time inventories were also growing, indicating unsold product. Those two numbers are normally at odds. Increased receivables should indicate increased sales, which would normally result in decreased inventory. The directors began an internal investigation in October, while the company reported another record-setting quarter for that period in spite of failing to win either the Apple or DEC contracts.

The investigation revealed that Wiles set iron-clad sales forecasts and pushed these requirements down into the sales team, leaving no room for failure and setting bonuses on beating those figures. The sales team responded by &quot;touching up&quot; reporting documents as they moved up the reporting chain. Wiles responded to these positive reports by setting even higher sales targets, leading to ever-increasing fraud to meet them. Wiles left the company in February 1989, followed by most of the company&#x27;s officers over the next months. The directors report was released in the summer, stating that Wiles and his management team had &quot;perpetrated a massive fraud&quot; in a &quot;company run amok&quot;.

Among the other techniques used to improve the numbers were classic accounting tricks. Failing to write off bad debts, shipping drives to warehouses and booking them as sales (&quot;channel stuffing&quot;), back-dating shipments to allow them to be booked in earlier reporting periods to meet goals, and deliberately shipping defective products repeatedly to different customers so one drive could be booked as multiple sales (leading employees to joke that the only thing being repaired were the worn-out cardboard boxes). When the company embarked on a round of layoffs just before the 1989 Christmas shutdown, including several of the employees who were involved in the brick scheme, they immediately called the Denver area newspapers, who broke the story. Following immediate investigations in Singapore and Colorado the fraud was confirmed.

==Acquisition and aftermath==
The company declared bankruptcy on January 1, 1990, and was quickly liquidated with Maxtor acquiring its assets in a $46 million cash and stock deal in 1990. Since then MiniScribe Corporation was known as Maxtor Colorado Corporation and later merged with its parent. In a subsequent court case, Wiles claimed to have known nothing of these schemes, saying he was duped by the middle management. Several of those middle managers testified that Wiles was aware of the fraud. The court also noted that Wiles sold a considerable number of shares in the company in April and May 1988, immediately prior to reporting a shortfall due to an &quot;elaborate scheme&quot; to manipulate inventory shortfalls. Wiles was convicted of fraud and insider trading in July 1994 following a federal jury trial, and sentenced to 36 months imprisonment. A portion of Wiles&#x27; conviction was overturned on appeal in 1996.

Founder Terry Johnson later helped found CoData with the intent of building a 3.5&quot; hard drive with the capacity of standard 5.25&quot; drives. The company merged with Conner Peripherals in 1986 and as Conner Peripherals became a major vendor for a time. Johnson died near Norman Wells in northern Canada while piloting his Beechcraft Bonanza on July 24, 2010.

<text>Sir Frederick William Alpin Gordon Haultain (November 25, 1857 – January 30, 1942) was a lawyer and a long-serving Canadian politician and judge. His career in provincial and territorial legislatures stretched into four decades. He served as the first premier of the North-West Territories from 1897 to 1905 and is recognized as having a significant contribution towards the creation of the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. From 1905 on he served as Leader of the Official Opposition in Saskatchewan as well as Leader of the Provincial Rights Party. His legislative career ended when he was appointed to the judiciary in 1912.

==Early life==

He was born in Woolwich, England in 1857, the son of Frederick W. Haultain (1821–1882) and Lucinde Helen Gordon (1828–1915), and came to Peterborough, Canada West, with his family in 1860. He grew up in Peterborough and Montreal, where he was educated at the High School of Montreal, later receiving a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Toronto. He later studied law at Osgoode Hall and was called to the bar in Ontario in 1882 and in the North-West Territories in 1884.

==North-West territorial politics==
In 1884, Haultain opened a law practice in Fort Macleod. He also served as Crown prosecutor there for several years, and also was an editor for newspapers in Fort Macleod and Lethbridge. Haultain was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of the North-West Territories in a by-election held on September 5, 1887. He defeated Charles Conybeare by a large margin. Representing the electoral district of Macleod in the North-West Territorial Council from 1887 to 1888. Haultain won his next five elections by acclamation.

The editor of the Calgary Herald once wrote of him saying that &quot;He is a man of academic training and large, clear perception; straightforward and manly even towards his enemies. In some respects, he is the most finished debater ever heard on a Western platform, arraying his Facts in crisp, clear-cut sentences, and then pressing home his argument with logic and Force?&quot;

===Premier===
Hault was appointed premier of the North-West Territories on October 7, 1897. Haultain also served as Attorney General and Commissioner of Education. As premier, Haultain led negotiations for the granting of provincial status. He argued for Alberta and Saskatchewan to be admitted as a single province named Buffalo, and wanted the new province to be governed by non-partisan governments. The federal Liberal government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, however, decided that such a province would challenge the power of Ontario, and Quebec. Instead wanting to carve up the province to create, Alberta and Saskatchewan, in 1905.

Frustrated in negotiations with the federal Liberal government, Haultain became increasingly identified with the Conservative Party and campaigned for it in the 1904 federal election. Laurier&#x27;s Liberals were re-elected.

==Saskatchewan politics==

Haultain led the Provincial Rights Party in the 1905 Saskatchewan provincial election, which was won by the Liberal Party of Saskatchewan. From 1905 to 1912, Haultain sat in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan as leader of the Opposition.

==Later life==

In 1912, the newly elected Conservative federal government of Sir Robert Borden made Haultain Chief Justice of Saskatchewan&#x27;s superior court. Haultain was knighted in 1916. The next year, he became Chief Justice of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, a position that he held until his retirement in 1938.

Haultain died on January 30, 1942, at Montreal.

<text>3i Group plc is a British multinational private equity and venture capital company based in London, England. 3i is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.

==History==
The company was formed in 1945, as the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation (ICFC), by the Bank of England and the major British banks to provide long-term investment funding for small and medium-sized enterprises. Its foundation was inspired by the Macmillan Committee, and resulted from the recognition in the 1930s, given new impetus in the postwar era, that smaller businesses faced a gap in available corporate finance due to banks being unwilling to provide long-term capital and the companies being too small to raise capital from the public markets.

During the 1950s and 1960s, and particularly after 1959 when the shareholder banks allowed it to raise external funds, ICFC expanded significantly. In 1973 ICFC acquired Finance Corporation for Industry, a sister company also formed in 1945 which focused on finance for large companies, and was renamed Finance for Industry (FFI). In the 1980s, FFI became a leading provider of finance for management buyouts, and expanded internationally. In 1983 the company was renamed Investors in Industry, commonly known as 3i.

3i Group was created in 1987 when the banks sold off their stakes to form a public limited company. In 1994 the company was floated on the London Stock Exchange with a market capitalisation of £1.5 billion.

==Operations==
3i invests in mid-market buyouts, growth capital (minority) and infrastructure. Sectors invested in are business and financial services, consumer, industrials and energy, and healthcare.

<text>Smilax ornata is a perennial trailing vine with prickly stems that is native to Mexico and Central America. Common names include sarsaparilla, Honduran sarsaparilla, and Jamaican sarsaparilla. 

It is known in Spanish as &#x27;, which is derived from the words&#x27; meaning &quot;bramble&quot; (from Basque &quot;bramble&quot;), and &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;little grape vine&quot;.

== Uses ==

===Food===
&quot;Smilax ornata&quot; is used as the basis for a soft drink frequently called sarsaparilla. It is also a primary ingredient in old fashioned-style licorice, in conjunction with sassafras, which was more widely available prior to studies of its potential health risks.

===Traditional medicine===
&quot;Smilax ornata&quot; was considered by Native Americans to have medicinal properties, and was a popular European treatment for syphilis when it was introduced from the New World. From 1820 to 1910, it was registered in the U.S. Pharmacopoeia as a treatment for syphilis.

<doc id="499810" wikidata="Q1754773" url="?curid=499810" title="A Mighty Wind">
<text>A Mighty Wind is a 2003 American mockumentary comedy film about a folk music reunion concert in which three folk bands reunite for a television performance for the first time in decades. Co-written (with Eugene Levy), directed, and composed by Christopher Guest, the film is widely acknowledged to reference folk music producer Harold Leventhal as the inspiration for the character of Irving Steinbloom and more broadly parodies the American folk music revival of the early 1960s and its personalities. The film stars Guest and Levy alongside Bob Balaban, John Michael Higgins, Jane Lynch, Michael McKean, Catherine O&#x27;Hara, Parker Posey, Harry Shearer and Fred Willard.

Guest co-stars and reunites many of his company of actors from &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot;, &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot;, and &quot;Best in Show&quot; for this film, including Eugene Levy, Catherine O&#x27;Hara, Michael McKean, Harry Shearer, Fred Willard, Bob Balaban, Ed Begley Jr., Jennifer Coolidge, John Michael Higgins, Jane Lynch and Parker Posey.

==Plot ==
After fictional folk music producer Irving Steinbloom dies, his children Jonathan, Naomi, and Elliott organize a memorial concert, which they hope to feature his three most famous acts: The Folksmen, The New Main Street Singers, and Mitch &amp; Mickey.

The Folksmen trio — Mark Shubb, Alan Barrows, and Jerry Palter — were once the most popular of the acts but have not appeared together in decades. They had several minor hits (each on albums with titles ending &quot;-in&#x27;&quot;), and their most famous song was &quot;Old Joe&#x27;s Place.&quot; Despite not playing or seeing each other for many years, their reunion is very positive and full of good memories, so they diligently begin rehearsing for the concert. Although some tension arises over whether to include &quot;Skeletons of Quinto&quot;, a convoluted, somber song about the Spanish Civil War, in their otherwise upbeat set list, they clearly enjoy working together again.

The New Main Street Singers are the second generation of the original Main Street Singers, formed by George Menschell, the only living member of the original group, who sings and holds a guitar he cannot play. Performers include life-long Main Street Singers fan Terry Bohner and his wife Laurie, a former adult film star, now founders of Witches in Nature&#x27;s Colors (WINC), a coven of modern-day witches that worships the power of color, and former juvenile delinquent Sissy Knox, the daughter of Fred Knox, one of the original Main Street Singers. Their manager, Mike LaFontaine, most famously appeared in a short-lived and mostly forgotten 1970 sitcom, &quot;Wha&#x27; Happened?&quot;, but is constantly puzzling others by quoting his character Li&#x27;l Eddie Dees&#x27; catchphrases, including the show&#x27;s title, which was its tagline. The group is known for their complex harmonies, identical stage outfits, and happy-go-lucky attitude, forming what Menschell terms a &quot;neuftet&quot;.

Mitch Cohen and Mickey Crabbe appeared as Mitch &amp; Mickey, a former couple that released seven albums and ended performances of their most famous song, &quot;A Kiss at the End of the Rainbow,&quot; by kissing each other. After a dramatic break-up years before the events of the film, Mickey seemingly moved on and has married a medical supply salesman, but Mitch broke down emotionally and has never fully recovered. As the pair reunite and rehearse, romantic tension and personal regrets repeatedly imperil their participation in the concert, though they continue to work through it.

The three groups, all of whom have sunk to various levels of musical irrelevance since their respective heyday, agree to the reunion performance, to be held at The Town Hall in New York and televised live on the PBS-like station PBN. The acts rehearse for the show and participate in interviews discussing their activities over the previous years and their feelings about performing again.

The show itself proceeds with only two hitches: the intended opening song for The Folksmen&#x27;s set is played first by the New Main Street Singers (a song called &quot;Never Did No Wanderin&#x27;&quot;, which the Folksmen sing in a rugged, emotional manner consistent with the spirit of the song, while the New Main Street Singers perform it in their usual peppy, carefree way), and Mitch temporarily disappears minutes before he and Mickey are to perform, forcing the Folksmen to extend their set. It turns out that Mitch had gone to buy a rose for Mickey, which she gratefully accepts as they go on stage. They perform &quot;A Kiss at the End of the Rainbow&quot;, and after a suspenseful pause, they do the much-anticipated kiss at the end. In the finale, all three acts sing &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot; together.

Six months after the concert, many of the performers detail subsequent events via interviews. Mickey is performing &quot;The Sure-Flo Song&quot; (about a medical device used for bladder control) at her husband Leonard&#x27;s trade show booth, while Mitch is writing poetry and songs again, claiming to be in a &quot;prolific phase&quot;. Mickey claims that Mitch overreacted to their onstage kiss, while Mitch insists that he no longer has feelings for Mickey, but had worried that Mickey&#x27;s feelings for him might have returned. LaFontaine is trying to drum up interest for a sitcom called &quot;Supreme Folk&quot;, in which the New Main Street Singers star as characters who are Supreme Court judges by day and folk singers sharing a house by night. The Folksmen have reunited, with Shubb, now a transgender woman named Martha, having revamped her wardrobe and continuing to sing in her deep bass voice, followed now by a girlish giggle.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Origins===

Guest, McKean and Shearer first appeared as The Folksmen in a season 10 episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; that aired on November 3, 1984, when Guest and Shearer were both repertory cast members of the show and McKean was that week&#x27;s host. Earlier that year, Guest, McKean and Shearer had appeared as the titular group in the mockumentary &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot;, a parody of aging heavy metal bands. McKean later stated, &quot;I came and hosted a show, and in lieu of another &#x27;Tap&#x27; piece, we did these guys.&quot;

The Folksmen later appeared in Spinal Tap&#x27;s 1992 TV special, &quot;The Return of Spinal Tap&quot;, and the original concept for &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot; was to give The Folksmen their own narrative vehicle.

===Development===
&quot;A Kiss at the End of the Rainbow&quot;, which was composed for the film by Michael McKean and wife Annette O&#x27;Toole, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song.

In the commentary for the DVD release, Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy noted that, in a scene cut from the finished movie, it is explained that Menschell cannot play the guitar. However, just before a performance of the original Main Street Singers, he stained his shirt front and covered it up by holding a guitar for the performance, something he continued to do for all subsequent performances.

==Music==
===Soundtrack===

The official soundtrack, titled &quot;A Mighty Wind: The Album&quot;, was released on April 8, 2003, shortly before the film&#x27;s premiere. It peaked at number 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Soundtracks chart.
Credits adapted from the album&#x27;s liner notes and AllMusic.

===Promotional tour===
Following the release of the film, the cast performed a show in character at the Getty Center in Los Angeles. This was followed by a seven-city U.S. tour in the fall of 2003 to promote the release of the film on DVD. The tour dates were: Philadelphia (Tower Theater, September 19), New York City (The Town Hall, September 20), Washington, D.C. (9:30 Club, September 21), Boston (Orpheum Theatre, September 22), Los Angeles (Wilshire Theatre, November 8), San Francisco (Warfield Theatre, November 9) and Seattle (McCaw Hall, November 14), with an additional performance in Vancouver, BC.

==Reception==
=== Critical response ===
The film received mostly positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 87% based on reviews from 175 critics, and an average rating of 7.35/10, with the sites consensus, &quot;Though not as uproariously funny as Guest&#x27;s previous movies, &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot; is also more heartfelt.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 81% based on reviews from 40 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

&quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;″s Mick LaSalle stated that it &quot;gently caricatures the folk music scene with dozens of delicate brush strokes, creating a picture that&#x27;s increasingly, gloriously funny – as in entire lines of dialogue are lost because the audience&#x27;s laughing so hard.&quot; The review also displayed a drawing of the newspaper&#x27;s character of The Little Man giving a standing ovation (the &quot;Chronicle&quot;″s equivalent of a five-star rating). Roger Ebert stated that &quot;though there were many times when I laughed&quot;, &quot;the edge is missing from Guest&#x27;s usual style&quot; perhaps because he &quot;is too fond of the characters&quot;. Ebert gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four.

=== Awards ===
Michael McKean and Annette O&#x27;Toole were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song, for the song &quot;A Kiss at the End of the Rainbow,&quot; which was performed at the 76th Academy Awards by Levy and O&#x27;Hara (in character). &quot;A Mighty Wind&quot; won the Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media award for Christopher Guest, Eugene Levy, and Michael McKean at the 46th Grammy Awards.

=== Box office ===
The film had a moderate intake for its opening day in April 2003, grossing $307,931 in total. It went on to gross $2,112,140 in 133 theatres for an average of $15,880 per theatre. With a domestic total of $17,583,468 and an international total of $969,240, the film brought in a total of $18,750,246 during its theatrical run.

<text>Kananaskis Country (abbreviated: K-Country) is a multi-use area west of Calgary, Alberta, Canada in the foothills and front ranges of the Canadian Rockies. The area is named for the Kananaskis River, which was named by John Palliser in 1858 after a Cree acquaintance. Covering an area of approximately , Kananaskis Country was formed by the Alberta Government in 1978 to provide an assortment of land uses and designations. Land uses include resource extraction activities (such as forestry, cattle grazing, water, oil and gas), recreation, power generation, and residential communities. Land designations include public land and protected areas.


== Administration and purpose==
The area, which now includes Kananaskis Country, has been administered since 1945 as Improvement District No. 5 (Kananaskis). It was established by the Municipal Affairs branch of the Alberta Government for multiple uses including logging, gas and oil extraction, cattle grazing, recreation and tourism. All activities are planned and facilities are developed with watershed protection as a priority.

Not all areas of Kananaskis Country are covered by the same measure of protection. Areas within Kananaskis Country include provincial parks, provincial recreation areas, wildland provincial parks, ecological reserves and Crown land. All of the aforementioned categories are governed by differing laws.

A management plan approved in March 2003 by the Kananaskis Country restricts further development in the Spray Valley Provincial Park area to preserve the ecological integrity. Restrictions were imposed on off-road vehicles, snowmobiles, horseback riding and biking; however, a site in the Spray Valley is considered for the construction of a small lodge.

Kananaskis Country includes four areas of Crown land (also known as provincial land or public land) called Public Land Use Zones (PLUZ). The largest is the Kananaskis Country Public Land Use Zone which takes up over a quarter of Kananaskis Country&#x27;s land area. The other public land uses zones are Sibbald, Cataract, and McLean. Land use zones do not include provincial parks or provincial recreation areas. Each Public Land Use Zone is managed differently, but permitted activities may include cattle grazing, trapping, mining, oil and gas exploration and production, logging, pipelines, cultivation, or commercial recreation operations. Recreational uses such as camping, mountain biking, hunting, hiking, horseback riding, and skiing are permitted with certain limitations. Motorized recreation is permitted in all zones except Kananaskis Country Public Land Use Zone.

In June 2021, the Alberta Government implemented user fees for all personal and commercial vehicles stopping in Kananaskis Country. The fees, known as a conservation pass, are meant to provide more conservation and safety measures, and improve services and facilities. The fee does not apply to the McLean Land Use Zone, which caters to motorized recreation.

== Recreation and tourism ==

Although Kananaskis Country is a multi-use area, it is noted for recreation and tourism. One of the reasons the area was established was to &quot;alleviate congestion in national parks, and to provide greater recreation opportunities for Albertans&quot;. 

Recreation facilities in Kananaskis include several campgrounds, a golf course, a hotel, a holiday ranch, two alpine ski areas (Nakiska, which hosted alpine skiing and freestyle moguls skiing during the 1988 Winter Olympics and Fortress Mountain Resort and a competitive cross-country ski area, the Canmore Nordic Centre) that the public can use. The Canmore Nordic Centre was the venue for cross-country skiing events during the 1988 Winter Olympics. Most of the development is within Peter Lougheed Provincial Park and along the highway 40 corridor that parallels the Kananaskis River. Kananaskis has many kilometres of hiking, cross-country ski, and horse trails. Other activities popular in Kananaskis include mountain biking, scrambling, climbing, backpacking, hunting, and fishing.

=== Parks ===

Several parks and campgrounds and one ecological reserve are located within Kananaskis. These include:

* Bluerock Wildland Provincial Park
* Bow Valley Provincial Park
* Bow Valley Wildland Provincial Park
* Bragg Creek Provincial Park
* Canmore Nordic Centre Provincial Park
* Don Getty Wildland Provincial Park
* Elbow-Sheep Wildland Provincial Park
* Peter Lougheed Provincial Park
* Plateau Mountain Ecological Reserve
* Sheep River Provincial Park
* Spray Valley Provincial Park

Special areas within Kananaskis Country that are not formally designated as parks or ecological reserves include the Bow Corridor Area, the Elbow River Valley Area, Evan-Thomas Provincial Recreation Area, the Highwood/Cataract Areas, Sentinel Provincial Recreation Area, Stoney Creek Provincial Recreation Area, Strawberry Provincial Recreation Area and the Sibbald Area (Sibbald Lake Provincial Recreation Area, Sibbald Meadows Pond Provincial Recreation Area).

==Special facilities==
A University of Calgary ecological and environmental research station is located nearby, at Barrier Lake. A &quot;Tim Horton Children&#x27;s Foundation&quot; summer camp is also located in the area. Easter Seals Camp Horizon is located within Kananaskis along Highway 66. A YMCA summer camp, Camp Chief Hector, is located alongside the Trans-Canada Highway near exit 114. William Watson Lodge, a facility for people with disabilities, seniors, and their families is located in Peter Lougheed Provincial Park.

==Access==

Kananaskis Country can be accessed by five main highways that run into or through the area: Highway 40, a segment of the Bighorn Highway and also known as Kananaskis Trail; Highway 66, a highway originating near Bragg Creek known as Elbow Falls Trail; Highway 68, a gravel highway originating from the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1) known as Sibbald Creek Trail; Highway 546, west of Turner Valley; and Highway 549 west of Millarville.

== 28th G8 Summit in Canada ==

On June 26 and June 27, 2002, the area hosted the 28th G8 Summit. This annual &quot;Group of 8&quot; Summit was held in Kananaskis Village at the Kananaskis Resort (also called the &quot;Delta Lodge at Kananaskis&quot;). This was the second time Canada used a lodge venue for the G8 Summit, after its inaugural 7th G7 Summit at Montebello, Quebec in 1981. So far, it is the only G8 Summit to be held in western Canada. The 2002 conference pumped some $300-million into the Kananaskis and Alberta economy; however, security cost taxpayers in excess of $200-million.
== Climate ==
Kananaskis experiences a subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfc&quot;).

<doc id="499822" wikidata="Q1584931" url="?curid=499822" title="Sky island">
<text>Sky islands are isolated mountains surrounded by radically different lowland environments. The term originally referred to those found on the Mexican Plateau and has extended to similarly isolated high-elevation forests. The isolation has significant implications for these natural habitats. The American Southwest region began warming up between and 10,000 years BP and atmospheric temperatures increased substantially, resulting in the formation of vast deserts that isolated the sky islands. Endemism, altitudinal migration, and relict populations are some of the natural phenomena to be found on sky islands.

The complex dynamics of species richness on sky islands draws attention from the discipline of biogeography, and likewise the biodiversity is of concern to conservation biology. One of the key elements of a sky island is separation by physical distance from the other mountain ranges, resulting in a habitat island, such as a forest surrounded by desert.

Some sky islands serve as refugia for boreal species stranded by warming climates since the last glacial period. In other cases, localized populations of plants and animals tend towards speciation, similar to oceanic islands such as the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.

==Etymology==
Herpetologist Edward H. Taylor presented the concept of &quot;Islands&quot; on the Mexican Plateau in 1940 at the 8th American Scientific Congress in Washington, D. C. His abstract on the topic was published in 1942.

The sky island concept was later applied in 1943 when Natt N. Dodge, in an article in &quot;Arizona Highways&quot; magazine, referred to the Chiricahua Mountains in southeastern Arizona as a &quot;mountain island in a desert sea&quot;.

In about the same era, the term was used to refer to high alpine, unglaciated, ancient topographic landform surfaces on the crest of the Sierra Nevada, California.

The term was popularized by nature writer Weldon Heald, a resident of southeastern Arizona. In his 1967 book, &quot;Sky Island&quot;, he demonstrated the concept by describing a drive from the town of Rodeo, New Mexico, in the western Chihuahuan desert, to a peak in the Chiricahua Mountains, away and higher in elevation, ascending from the hot, arid desert, to grasslands, then to oak-pine woodland, pine forest, and finally to spruce-fir-aspen forest. His book mentions the concept of biome, but prefers the terminology of life zones, and makes reference to the work of Clinton Hart Merriam. The book also describes the wildlife and living conditions of the Chiricahuas.

Around the same time, the idea of mountains as islands of habitat took hold with scientists and has been used by such popular writers as David Quammen and John McPhee. This concept falls within the study of island biogeography. It is not limited to mountains in southwestern North America but can be applied to mountains, highlands, and massifs around the world.

==Characteristics==

The Madrean sky islands are probably the most studied sky islands in the world. Found in the U.S. states of New Mexico and Arizona and the Mexican states of Chihuahua and Sonora, these numerous mountains form links in a chain connecting the northern end of the Sierra Madre Occidental and the southern Colorado Plateau. Sky islands of the central and northern mountains in the United States are often called island ranges, especially by populations within view of such islands of mountains surrounded by plains such as those found within the Wichita Mountains of southwestern Oklahoma.
Some more northerly examples are the Crazy Mountains, Castle Mountains, Bears Paw Mountains, Highwood Mountains, and Little Rocky Mountains, all in the US state of Montana. Each of these ranges is forested and has tundra and snowpack above treeline, but is not connected to any other range by forested ridges; the ranges are completely surrounded by treeless prairie and/or semi-arid scrubland below. Other well-known sky islands of North America are the Great Basin montane forests, such as the White Mountains in California, and the Spring Mountains near Las Vegas, Nevada. One of the unique aspects of the sky islands of the U.S.-Mexico border region is the mix of floristic affinities, that is, the trees and plants of higher elevations are more characteristic of northern latitudes, while the flora of the lower elevations has ties to the desert and the mountains further south. Some unique plants and animals are found in these sky islands, such as the mountain yucca, Mount Graham red squirrel, Huachuca springsnail, and Jemez Mountains salamander.

Some montane species apparently evolved within their current range, adapting to their local environment, such as the Mount Lyell shrew. However, it has also been noted that some isolated mountain ecosystems have a tendency to lose species over time, perhaps because small, insularized populations are vulnerable to the forces of extinction, and the isolation of the habitat reduces the possibility of colonization by new species. Furthermore, some species, such as the grizzly bear, require a range of habitats. These bears historically made use of the forests and meadows found in the Madrean sky islands, as well as lower-elevation habitats such as riparian zones. (Grizzlies were extirpated from the region in the 20th century.) Seasonal movements between highland and lowland habitats can be a kind of migration, such as that undertaken by the mountain quail of the Great Basin mountains. These birds live in high elevations when free of snow, and instead of migrating south for the winter, they migrate &quot;down&quot;.

Confusing the matter somewhat is the potential for an archipelago of sky islands or even the valleys between them to act not only as a barrier to biological dispersal, but also as a path for migration. Examples of birds and mammals making use of the Madrean archipelago to extend their ranges northward are the elegant trogon and white-nosed coati.

<text>In Latin, Caius is an archaic spelling of the Latin praenomen Gaius, pronounced /ga:ius/. In early Latin, the letter C was used for both /g/ and /k/; and the names Gaius and Gnaeus were spelt Caius and Cnaius and continued to be so in inscriptions, after the letter G was introduced, and C was confined to the /k/ sound. Notably, the name of Gaius Iulius Caesar is abbreviated CIC.

In English, Caius is a latinized spelling of the last name of John Keys of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge.

<doc id="499843" wikidata="Q381951" url="?curid=499843" title="Hilarius (poet)">
<text>Hilarius, also known as Hilary the Englishman (fl. 1125), was a Latin poet who is supposed to have been an Englishman.

==Life==
He was one of the pupils of Pierre Abélard at his oratory of the Paraclete, and addressed to him a copy of verses with its refrain in the vulgar tongue, &quot;Tort avers vos li mestre&quot;, Abelard having threatened to discontinue his teaching because of certain reports made by his servant about the conduct of the scholars.

Later Hilarius may have made his way to Angers. His poems are contained in manuscript supp. lat. 1008 of the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, purchased in 1837 at the sale of M. de Rosny. Quotations from this manuscript had appeared before, but in 1838 it was edited by Champollion Figeac as &quot;Hilarii versus et ludi&quot;.

After 1125 there is no certain trace of him; he may be the same person as the Hilary who taught classical literature at Orléans, mentioned by William of Tyre and Arnulf of Orléans c. 1150, but it is unknown whether Hilarius of Orléans and Hilarius the playwright are separate people, nor if either of them are the same person as the Hilarius who taught at Angers.

==Works==
His works consist chiefly of light verses of the goliardic type. There are verses addressed to an English nun named Eva, lines to Rosa, &quot;Ave splendor puellarum, generosa domina&quot;, and another poem describes the beauties of the priory of Chaloutre la Petite, in the diocese of Sens, of which the writer was then an inmate. One copy of satirical verses seems to aim at the pope himself. Two other poems, originally translated by John Boswell and published in &quot;Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality&quot; (1980), express his love for a &#x27;Boy of Anjou&#x27; and &#x27;An English boy&#x27;.

He also wrote three miracle plays in rhymed Latin with an ad-mixture of French. Two of them, &quot;Suscitatio Lazari&quot; and &quot;Historia de Daniel repraesentanda&quot;, are of purely liturgical type. At the end of &quot;Lazarus&quot; is a stage direction to the effect that if the performance has been given at matins, &quot;Lazarus&quot; should proceed with the Te Deum, if at vespers, with the Magnificat.

The third, &quot;Ludus super iconic Sancti Nicholai&quot;, is founded on a sufficiently foolish legend. Petit de Julleville sees in the play a satiric intention and a veiled incredulity that put the piece outside the category of liturgical drama.

A rhymed Latin account of a dispute in which the nuns of Ronceray at Angers were concerned, contained in a cartulary of Ronceray, is also ascribed to the poet, who there calls himself &quot;Hilarius Canonicus&quot;. The poem is printed in the Bibliothèque de l&#x27;Ecole des Chartes (vol. xxxvu. 1876), and was dated by Paul Marchegay from 1121.

<text>A ranger, park ranger, park warden, field ranger, or forest ranger is a person entrusted with protecting and preserving parklands and protected areas – private, national, state, provincial, or local parks. Their duties include (but are not limited to) law enforcement, wildlife and land management, community engagement and education, recreation area maintenance, and firefighting. Rangers monitor wildlife, remove snares, confront and arrest poachers, identify and remove invasive species, and much more.

==Description==
&quot;Parks&quot; in this context may be broadly defined by some systems in this context and may include forests, wildlife preserves, deserts, beaches, and even protected culturally/historically important manmade environments and monuments. Park rangers are not limited to working in the natural environment. 

Different countries use different names for this occupation. &quot;Warden&quot; is the favored term in Canada, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and many other Commonwealth countries. The profession includes a number of disciplines and specializations, and park rangers are often required to be proficient in more than one.

The nomenclature is more complex in the United States. The National Park Service refers to the position as &quot;Park Ranger&quot; for all law enforcement, interpretive, and fee collection booth rangers. Similarly, within the Bureau of Land Management, interpretive staff members are called &quot;Park Rangers&quot; while law enforcement staff are referred to as &quot;LE Rangers&quot;. &quot;District Rangers&quot; in the U.S. Forest Service do not perform the same duties, instead focusing on administration/management of “Ranger Districts”, large subunits of National Forests. Few other positions in the U.S. Forest Service are officially titled &quot;Ranger&quot;, but there are several positions that perform similar or identical outdoor work including those with the titles &quot;Forester&quot;, &quot;Forestry Technician&quot;, and &quot;Law Enforcement Officer&quot;. Many are referred to colloquially as &quot;rangers&quot; such as Wilderness Rangers, Climbing Rangers, Snow Rangers, Recreation Rangers, and Forest Protection Officers even though they are all officially categorized as &quot;Forestry Technicians&quot;.

==History==
In medieval England, rangers, originally called under-foresters, were the most junior officials employed to &quot;range&quot; through the countryside enforcing the forest law imposed by William the Conqueror to protect the &quot;vert and venison&quot;. Their duties were originally confined to seeing that the Forest Law was enforced in the borders, or purlieus, of the royal forests. Above them were the Foresters-in-Fee (later called Woodwards), then the Verderers, then the Justices in Eyre. Their duties corresponded in some respects with that of a mounted forester.

The term &quot;ranger&quot; seems to correspond to the Medieval Latin word &quot;regardatores&quot; which appeared in 1217 in the Charter of the Forest. &quot;Regardatores&quot; was later rendered as &quot;rangers&quot; in the English translations of the Charter. Others translate it as &quot;regarders&quot;. For example, the fifth clause of the Charter of the Forest is commonly translated: &quot;Our regarders shall go through the forests making the regard as it used to be made at the time of the first coronation of the aforesaid King Henry [II] our grandfather, and not otherwise.&quot; A &quot;regard&quot; is considered to be an inspection of the forest.

The earliest letters patent found mentioning the term refer to a commission of a ranger in 1341. Documents from 1455 state that England had &quot;all manner and singular Offices of Foresters and Rangers of our said Forests&quot;.

One of the first appearances of &quot;ranger&quot; in literature is in Edmund Spenser&#x27;s poem &quot;The Shepheardes Calendar&quot; from 1579: &quot;[Wolves] walk not widely, as they were wont, for fear of rangers and the great hunt.&quot;

The office of Ranger of Windsor Great Park appears to have been created in 1601.

===North America, 17th–19th centuries===
In North America, rangers served in the 17th through 18th-century wars between colonists and Native American Indian tribes. Rangers were full-time soldiers employed by colonial governments to patrol between fixed frontier fortifications in reconnaissance providing early warning of raids. During offensive operations, they acted as scouts and guides, locating villages and other targets for task forces drawn from the militia or other colonial troops. During the Revolutionary War, General George Washington ordered Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Knowlton to select an elite group of men for reconnaissance missions. This unit was known as Knowlton&#x27;s Rangers, and was the first official Ranger unit for the United States; it is the precusor of the modern day Army Rangers.

===Early conservation in the United States, 1866–1916===
The word was resurrected by Americans in the 19th and 20th centuries from the old idioms used for the wardens – royally appointed – who patrolled the deer parks and hunting forests in England.

There is much debate among scholars about which area was the world&#x27;s first national park (Yosemite or Yellowstone), so there is little agreement about who was the first national park ranger. Some argue that Galen Clark was first when, on May 21, 1866, he became the first person formally appointed and paid to protect and administer Yosemite, thus become California&#x27;s and the nation&#x27;s first park ranger. Clark served as the Guardian of Yosemite for 24 years. Others point to Harry Yount who worked as a gamekeeper in Yellowstone National Park in 1880–1881. Prophetically, Yount recommended &quot;the appointment of a small, active, reliable police force...[to] assist the superintendent of the park in enforcing laws, rules, and regulations.&quot; The first permanent appointment of rangers in a national park occurred on September 23, 1898, when Charles A. Leidig and Archie O. Leonard became forest rangers at Yosemite National Park.

One of the earliest uses of the term &quot;ranger&quot; was on badges with the title &quot;Forest Reserve Ranger&quot; which were used from 1898 to 1906 by the U.S. Department of the Interior. These badges were presumably issued to rangers working in the national parks as well as those in the national forests, since both were known as Forest Rangers at that time.

The term &quot;ranger&quot; was also applied to a reorganization of the Fire Warden force in the Adirondack Park after 1899 when fires burned in the park. The name was taken from Rogers&#x27; Rangers, a small force famous for their woodcraft that fought in the area during the French and Indian War in 1755.

==Duties, disciplines, and specializations==

The duties of the modern park ranger are as varied and diverse as the parks where they serve and in recent years have become more highly specialized. Regardless of the regular duties of any one discipline, the goal of all rangers remains to protect the park resources for future generations and to protect park visitors. This goal is accomplished by the professionalism and sometimes overlapping of the different divisions. For example, an interpretive ranger may perform a law enforcement role by explaining special park regulations to visitors and encouraging them to be proper stewards of natural and cultural history. Law enforcement rangers and other park employees may contribute to the mission of the interpretive ranger by providing information to park visitors about park resources and facilities. The spirit of teamwork in accomplishing the mission of protecting the parks and people is underscored by the fact that in many cases, for the U.S. National Park Rangers in particular, all park rangers share a common uniform regardless of work assignment. Similarly, in the U.S. Forest Service, due to the broad landscapes and relatively fewer employees, any field going employee (that meets the background and training requirements) can be certified as an unarmed Forest Protection Officer with the authority to write federal citations even though they are not armed/sworn Forest Service Law Enforcement Officers.

* Law enforcement: Law enforcement rangers have police powers and enforce national, state, provincial, and/or local laws as well as park regulations. In some developing countries, the park rangers patrolling natural preserves may be heavily armed and function as paramilitary organizations against organized poachers or even guerrillas. (Too, some are armed with machine guns to protect expeditions from rhinos and elephants.) In many other developing countries, park rangers have law enforcement authority and do carry firearms as they seek to achieve respect for nature by building good relationships with local communities and the visiting public. In units of the U.S. National Park System, Law Enforcement Rangers are the primary police agency; their services may be augmented by the US Park Police, particularly in the Washington, DC and San Francisco metropolitan areas. The U.S. National Park Service also has a section of &quot;Special Agents&quot; who conduct more complex criminal investigations. According to U.S. Department of Justice statistics, National Park Service Law Enforcement Rangers suffer the highest number of felonious assaults, and the highest number of homicides of all federal law enforcement officers. The City of New York has a uniformed division of Park Rangers called the New York City Parks Enforcement Patrol who are responsible for patrolling the city parks, pools and beaches.
* Interpretation and education: Park Rangers provide a wide range of informational services to visitors. Some Rangers provide practical information—such as driving directions, train timetables, weather forecasts, trip-planning resources, and beyond. Rangers may provide &quot;interpretive programs&quot; to visitors intended to foster stewardship of the resources by the visitor as a method of resource protection. Interpretation in this sense includes (but is not limited to): guided tours about the park&#x27;s history, ecology, or both; slideshows, talks, demonstrations; informal contacts, and historical re-enactments. Rangers may also engage in leading more formalized curriculum-based educational programs, meant to support and complement instruction received by visiting students in traditional academic settings and often designed to help educators meet specific national and/or local standards of instruction. All uniformed rangers, regardless of their primary duties, are often expected to be experts on the resources in their care, whether they are natural or cultural.
* Emergency response: Rangers are often trained in wilderness first aid and participate in search and rescue to locate lost persons in the wilderness. Many national parks require law enforcement rangers to maintain certification as Emergency Medical Responders, Emergency Medical Technicians, or Paramedics. Depending on the needs of the park where assigned, rangers may participate in high-angle rescue, swift-water rescue, may be certified scuba divers, and can become specially trained as helicopter pilots or crew members.
* Firefighting: Rangers are often the first to spot forest fires and are often trained to engage in wildland firefighting and in some cases structural fire fighting. Rangers also enforce laws and regulations regarding campfires and other fires on parklands. In the face of a fire outside their control, rangers will call for help and evacuate persons from the area pending the arrival of additional firefighters.
* Dispatcher: Some rangers work as park protection dispatchers, answering emergency calls and dispatching law enforcement rangers, park fire fighters or Park EMS crews by radio to emergency calls for service. Park Dispatchers provide pre-arrival instructions to callers to help them stay alive until responding units arrive. Dispatchers coordinate multi-agency responses to emergencies within the park boundaries and utilize computer systems to check for criminal histories of subjects stopped by park law enforcement rangers. Park Dispatchers typically perform other duties such as taking lost-and-found reports, monitoring CCTV surveillance cameras and fire alarms. Dispatchers are assigned to the Park Protection Division.
* Scientists and scholars: Rangers are responsible for protecting the natural resources or cultural sites for which they work. This includes obtaining and preserving knowledge about the area. As such, many different types of historians and scientists are employed as rangers. Some scientific positions often filled by rangers include archaeologist, many different types of biologist, ecologist, geologist, hydrologist, paleontologist, soil scientist, volcanologist, etc. Rangers in these positions are expected to study, monitor, and inform others (in the form of published, peer-reviewed scientific papers as well as internally) about their findings. These people add to the knowledge dispersed in interpretive and educational programs, and provide information needed by managers and others to more effectively protect the resource.
* Maintenance: Some rangers perform regular maintenance on infrastructure or equipment such as fire rings as part of their duties — especially in preparing for winter closures and spring reopenings. Rangers are often the first to discover vandalism or weather-related damage to park roads, trails and campgrounds.
* Administration: In many cases administrative staff members are categorized officially as park rangers and may wear the distinct park ranger uniform while working &quot;behind the scenes&quot; to ensure the continued operation of the parks. These rangers may set policy for the parks, or handle park budgets, computers and technology, human resources, or other fields related to the administration of parks. In the case of management these positions are usually filled by individuals who have moved up from other field-based positions. These individuals are often heavily cross trained in order to allow for a knowledge of all other areas and duties under their authority.
* Combat wildlife poaching: The Sabah state government in Malaysia has recruited and trained local rangers to respond to real-time alerts, perform ad hoc operations, support investigations and wildlife conservation efforts to combat wildlife poaching, trafficking and illegal wildlife trade in Sabah.

==Worldwide deficit in developing countries==

The Adopt A Ranger Foundation has calculated that worldwide about 150,000 rangers are needed for the protected areas in developing and transitions countries. There is no data on how many rangers are employed at the moment, but probably less than half the protected areas in developing and transition countries have any rangers at all and those that have them are at least 50% short. This means that there would be a worldwide ranger deficit of 105,000 rangers in the developing and transition countries.

Dr. Kenton Miller, a former director general of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), stated about the importance of rangers: &quot;The future of our ecosystem services and our heritage depends upon park rangers. With the rapidity at which the challenges to protected areas are both changing and increasing, there has never been more of a need for well prepared human capacity to manage. Park rangers are the backbone of park management. They are on the ground. They work on the front line with scientists, visitors, and members of local communities.&quot;

Adopt A Ranger claims that the ranger deficit is the single greatest limiting factor in effectively protecting nature in 75% of the world. Currently, no conservation organization or Western country or international organization addresses this problem. Adopt A Ranger has been incorporated to draw worldwide public attention to the most urgent problem that conservation is facing in developing and transition countries: protected areas without field staff. Specifically, it will contribute to solving the problem by fund raising to finance rangers in the field. It will also help governments in developing and transition countries to assess realistic staffing needs and staffing strategies.

== In popular culture ==
In popular culture, a stereotype of American park rangers has been created by children&#x27;s media such as the &quot;Yogi Bear&quot; cartoon series (Ranger Smith), as well as Disney&#x27;s Ranger Woodlore and the anthropomorphic character Ranger Rick from the magazine of the same name.

In recent years, the work of rangers and the harsh realities they face around the world are being captured in highly produced documentaries and films.

<text>Northern Rock, formerly the Northern Rock Building Society, was a British bank. Based at Regent Centre in Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom, Northern Rock was originally a building society. It demutualised and became Northern Rock bank in 1997, when it floated on the London Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol NRK. 

During the early 2000s the company borrowed substantially to fund mortgages, with the aim of ambitious growth, and also donated large amounts to charitable purposes and communities directly and through sponsorships. The global banking crisis beginning around 2007–08 meant that it was unable to produce income as expected from its loans, and was at risk of being unable to repay the amounts it had borrowed. The news that the bank had approached the government for support with its liquidity led within 24 hours to a public lack of confidence and concerns that savings were at risk, and the bank failed following a bank run as people rushed to withdraw their savings. It was the first British bank in 150 years to fail due to a bank run.

Unable to find a commercial buyer or secure the further government support needed, it was taken into public ownership in 2008, as an alternative to insolvency. By that point the government had extended liquidity support of tens of billions of pounds to Northern Rock. An inquiry concluded that the board had failed to properly protect the bank from the risks inherent in its strategy, or to restrain the executive directors where required, therefore although the bank had sufficient assets, it had become vulnerable.

The branch operations were eventually returned to private ownership when the branches and other retail operations were acquired by Virgin Group in 2012, being rebranded as Virgin Money the same year. The mortgage book of higher risk assets was renamed Northern Rock (Asset Management) and later &quot;NRAM plc&quot;, and remained in public ownership until it was sold to Cerberus Capital Management in 2016. 

 the Northern Rock Shareholder Action Group are continuing their campaign to obtain compensation for the shares that were taken over by the Government when the bank was nationalised during the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

==History==
Northern Rock Building Society was formed in 1965 by the merger of two North East of England building societies, both of which were based in Newcastle-upon-Tyne: the Northern Counties Permanent Building Society (established in 1850) and the Rock Building Society (established in 1865). During the following 30 years, Northern Rock expanded through the acquisition of 53 smaller building societies, most notably the North of England Building Society in 1994.

Along with many other UK building societies in the 1990s, Northern Rock chose to demutualise as a building society and float on the stock exchange as a bank. Throughout this period an argument against demutualisation was that the assets of a mutual society were built up by its members throughout its history, not just by current members, and that demutualisation was a betrayal of the community that the societies were created to serve. Northern Rock chose to address these concerns by establishing the Northern Rock Foundation, which funded community-based projects. At its Stock Exchange flotation on 1 October 1997 (when it converted from a building society to a bank), Northern Rock distributed shares to members with savings accounts and mortgage loans; the flotation share price was £4.51908. It joined the stock exchange as a minor bank.

In 2000, it was promoted to the FTSE 100 Index. After the 2007 crisis, it was demoted to the FTSE 250 in December of that year, before suspension upon nationalisation.

On 14 September 2007 the bank sought and received a liquidity support facility from the Bank of England, following problems in the credit markets caused by the 2008 financial crisis. The bank was more exposed than others to restrictions in the supply of credit because of the way it had funded its expansion. It had borrowed short term on the wholesale money markets and lent long term for mortgages on property. This was a policy well known to cause failures (see Banking School Theory of Crises under Financial Crises) when short-term interest rates rose above long-term rates and insufficient hedging was in place.

The bank was nationalised at 00:01 on 22 February 2008 following two unsuccessful bids to take over the bank, neither being able to fully commit to repayment of taxpayers&#x27; money. In doing so, the Government effectively took ownership of the insolvent institution away from its shareholders, without reimbursement. The media reported cases where some shareholders had their life savings in the shares, which were taken from them. The shares had already lost over 90% of their value prior to nationalisation, and were valued at nil in an independent valuation process, as the government had not guaranteed aid. This would later form part of shareholder&#x27;s action to seek compensation as, at that point, the aid was certain and the company had never stopped operating as a going concern.

A substantial reduction in the staff was announced in 2008, with 800 people made compulsorily redundant in July of that year, and another 500 taking voluntary redundancy. The bank planned to make another 700 redundant by 2011.

On 1 January 2010 the bank was split into two parts, assets and banking. In June 2011 the bank was officially put up for sale back to the private sector, and on 17 November 2011 it was announced that Virgin Money was going to buy Northern Rock plc for £747 million up front and other potential payments of up to £280 million over the next few years. The sale went through on 1 January 2012. The government said it had no plans to sell Northern Rock (Asset Management) and there would be no further job losses, except for those already announced. Virgin also pledged to keep the headquarters of the bank in Newcastle upon Tyne. The combined business now operates under the Virgin Money brand.

On 12 October 2012 Northern Rock plc was renamed Virgin Money plc, and Virgin Money Limited was renamed Northern Rock Limited. By this time the Northern Rock website had effectively become a &#x27;soft redirect&#x27; to Virgin Money&#x27;s website.

In 2024, Nationwide Building Society bought Virgin Money, and aims to rebrand the business to Nationwide in 4 years. After 27 years the business is once again a mutual.

==2007 crisis and nationalisation==

=== Background ===
Under non-executive chairman Matt Ridley and Chief Executive Adam Applegarth, Northern Rock had a business plan which involved borrowing heavily in the UK and international money markets, extending mortgages to customers based on this funding, and then re-selling these mortgages on international capital markets, in a process known as securitisation.

In 2007, there was much press attention given to the growing crisis due to subprime mortgage lending, particularly in the United States. Amid the resultant unease by August 2007, global demand from investors for securitised mortgages had fallen away, and Northern Rock was unable to raise funding by selling its securitised loan books, and therefore became unable to repay short-term loans from the money market. This problem had been anticipated by the financial markets, which drew greater attention to it. The major UK banks also faced the same problems raising funding, but as less of their business model was reliant upon securitisation, the effective freezing of the market in August 2007 was less critical.

=== 2007 crisis and initial responses ===
On 14 September 2007, the bank sought and received a liquidity support facility from the Bank of England, to replace funds it was unable to raise from the money market. Reporting of this complex scenario led to panic among individual depositors, who feared that their savings might not be available should Northern Rock go into receivership. The result was a bank run – the UK&#x27;s first in 150 years – where depositors lined up outside the bank to withdraw all of their savings as quickly as possible, particularly since many other people were doing the same.

As the UK government provided the liquidity support facility, they also exerted pressure on the bank to create a longer-term recovery plan. Over the next few months, there were numerous changes to the board of directors and executive team.

On 19 October, chairman Matt Ridley resigned and was replaced by Bryan Sanderson, a former Managing Director of BP. Chief Executive Adam Applegarth&#x27;s resignation was then announced in mid-November, with the caveat that he would remain with the group until it established independent funding or was purchased. Four non-executive directors, Sir Derek Wanless, Nichola Pease, Adam Fenwick and Rosemary Radcliffe also resigned. A month later, Applegarth left and former Marketing Director, Andy Kuipers, was appointed Chief Executive. Kuipers had been with the bank since the 1990s.

Notably, Dave Jones, the Group Finance Director through the crisis, had only been in his role since the retirement of Bob Bennett in January 2007. Alongside Applegarth, Bennett had been one of the architects of the bank&#x27;s flotation in 1997 and its subsequent substantial growth. He had been wary of its continued aggressive growth strategy, which would continue up until summer 2007, despite the increasing volatility in the markets on which Northern Rock relied. Commentators later suggested that with Bennett&#x27;s retirement, the executive board was dominated by Applegarth. A report by the Financial Services Authority conceded in February 2008 that it had been wrong to consider Northern Rock low risk, and as a result had given the company too little scrutiny.

The group was criticised when it emerged that they had begun to pay in excess of 150 senior staff members substantial retention bonuses. Northern Rock hoped the bonuses would enable them to retain critical staff members at risk of being poached by other companies. It had previously been criticised in 1998 when the pay of the executive team that led the flotation was 40% higher in the year following.

In late 2007, Virgin Money was named as the preferred bidder for the group, with Olivant Group later beginning talks around takeover.

=== Nationalisation ===
On 22 February 2008, the bank was taken into state ownership as a result of two unsuccessful bids to take over the bank, neither being able to fully commit to repayment of taxpayers&#x27; money within three years. The bank was managed at &quot;arm&#x27;s length&quot; by the government through UK Financial Investments.

The bank planned to repay the government debt within three to four years, primarily by encouraging mortgage customers to take their mortgage to another lender. Costs were also reduced by reducing numbers of staff. As of 3 March 2009, the bank was repaying the loan well ahead of target, owing a net balance of only £8.9 billion of the loan which stood at £26.9 billion at the end of 2007.

By October, customers appeared to be regaining confidence in the bank, when it emerged that there had been a surge in the number of new accounts which had been opened. People perceived Northern Rock as a safe place to put their money, given that it was currently government owned. However, there was no guarantee that if Northern Rock was to fail that the government would top-up any compensation over and above the standard £85,000 offered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.

Former shareholders and hedge funds also took legal action in January 2009 to get compensation for their shares; the shareholders lost the case. They also lost their appeals in the British courts, but hoped to take the case to the European courts. However, on 8 December 2009, it was announced that the valuer Andrew Caldwell had decided that the Northern Rock shareholders should get no compensation.

On 23 February 2009, Northern Rock announced that they would be offering £14 billion worth of new mortgages, over the next two years, as a part of their new business plan. This new lending was partly funded by an increase in the government loan and a reversal of previous strategy to pay the loan off as quickly as possible by actively encouraging mortgage customers to leave when their mortgage deal matured. The reason for this change was government policy to increase the availability of credit. This £14 billion was to be split into £5 billion in 2009 and £9 billion in 2010.

Potential buyers for the bank included Virgin Money, National Australia Bank, NBNK, Santander, Blackstone, Tesco, TowerBrook, Yorkshire Building Society and Coventry Building Society. Former Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling had stated that he was in no &quot;hurry&quot; to return the bank to the private sector.

The bank was split into two parts, assets and banking on 1 January 2010. On 15 June 2011, it was announced that the bank was to be sold to a single buyer in the private sector by the end of the year. On 22 March 2011, the bank issued its first mortgage securitisation since the 2007 recession which nearly brought the bank down.

=== Purchase by Virgin Money ===
On 17 November 2011, it was announced that Virgin Money was going to buy Northern Rock plc for £747 million. The sale was completed on 1 January 2012, and by July of that year a further £73 million deferred consideration was paid by Virgin. In 2014 Virgin Money repaid a further £154.5 million that it had received as part of the refinancing package.

=== Northern Rock Shareholder Action Group ===
The Northern Rock Shareholder Action Group (NRSAG) has been active since the Northern Rock crisis began in 2007, seeking fair compensation for the thousands of small shareholders who owned Northern Rock shares. The group is run by a committee of volunteers. The UK Shareholders Association provide administrative and advisory oversight to the group. The Committee reached the conclusion that HM Treasury has made a substantial amount of money from running down the loan book of the bank.

The NRSAG committee made several failed appeals to the Government previously, but the facts were not fully known then, but it is evident now that all loans to the taxpayer have been paid in full at penal rates of interest. That means compensation to shareholders will not be a charge on taxpayers or upon the general public because it is payable out of the surplus funds, built since nationalisation in 2008, as a result of asset disposals.

The NRSAG claim that despite comparable conditions, no other failed bank was handled in this manner during the global financial crisis. Instead, other banks received full Government backing, bailouts and shareholders retained their shares. The Government has earned a sizable surplus in the years after nationalisation, even though any and all Government assistance was completely reimbursed in those years, including interest paid at penal rates at no expense to the UK public. The NRSAG asked the Government to review their original compensation decision, given that the updated and widely confirmed numbers prove a huge surplus. To request an appeal, the NRSAG wrote to the Treasury Select Committee. Also, the group wrote to each MP to back their campaign for fairness and justice.

==Operations==

Northern Rock has been one of the top five mortgage lenders in the United Kingdom in terms of gross lending according to Council of Mortgage Lenders statistics.

As well as mortgages, the bank also deals with savings accounts and insurance. Home and contents insurance was dealt with by AXA whilst Legal &amp; General, whose mortgage book Northern Rock acquired, arranged life insurance investments.

The bank offered credit cards until 2003, when it sold the business to The Co-operative Bank in order to free capital for its rapid growth in mortgage lending, making a profit of more than £7 million. Northern Rock continued to sell credit cards under its own brand through The Co-operative Bank until November 2007; the decision to stop was made before the 2007 crisis.

In 2006 the bank had moved into sub-prime lending via a deal with Lehman Brothers. Although the mortgages were sold under Northern Rock&#x27;s brand through intermediaries, the risk was being underwritten by Lehman Brothers. Mortgages with LTV (&quot;Loan to Value&quot;) ratios of up to 130% were made.

At the time of being bought by Virgin the bank had 75 branches that have since been re-branded under the Virgin Money name. In 2012 Northern Rock began to provide Virgin-branded savings accounts.

==Location==

The bank was based on a large site at the Regent Centre in Gosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne called &quot;Northern Rock House&quot;. It had customer contact centre operations at both &quot;North of England House&quot; in Doxford International Business Park in Sunderland and at its head office. The bank developed a site at Rainton Bridge, which it sold to Npower.

===Gosforth site===
Northern Rock completed the redevelopment of the Gosforth site, &quot;Northern Rock House&quot;, in the 2000s, which saw the development some new buildings as well as the demolition of their original 1960s tower block during Spring 2006.

A new tower block, simply known as &quot;The Tower&quot;, was completed in November 2008, originally intended to create 1500 jobs, and act as the main entrance and focal point of the company headquarters. The local council, Newcastle City Council, purchased the building for £22 million, and leased it to a green support services company, Eaga (now Carillion Energy), as it was surplus to the bank&#x27;s requirements at the time.

The Kielder and Prudhoe buildings of the Gosforth site were completed in the early 1990s, behind which lies the distinctive glass-fronted Alnwick building. The main &quot;Atrium&quot; reception is adjacent to this, opening out onto &quot;Baker Street&quot;, a large covered atrium that housed a restaurant, shop and on-site branch. A number of other buildings, all named after North-Eastern castles are joined to &quot;Baker Street&quot;.

===Outside the UK===
A sub-division in Guernsey was established in February 1996, handling offshore savings and investment accounts. The Guernsey business was shut down on 2 September 2010.

Northern Rock opened a branch in Ireland on 16 November 1999 and the first branch in Northern Ireland followed on 4 April 2007. The first branch of the bank opened in Denmark on 7 February 2007; however as part of the Government restructuring, the Danish operations ceased on 18 June 2008. The €650 million worth of Irish deposits were sold to Permanent TSB in 2011.

==Corporate image==

In 2000 Northern Rock introduced a new corporate identity consisting of a magenta square containing the company name. This replaced the NR &#x27;blocks&#x27; logo. The Northern Rock Foundation also changed its logo in 2003 from the NR &#x27;blocks&#x27; inline with the main company, using the same new typeface. The Red Box Design Group designed all the currently standing buildings at the company&#x27;s headquarters in Gosforth and have contributed to many of the other design aspects of the company, such as the in-branch styling. From 1 October 1997 until the government nationalisation, the bank used the symbol NRK on the London Stock Exchange.

One of Northern Rock&#x27;s final advertising campaigns before the purchase by Virgin was titled &#x27;Works for Me&#x27; and featured local customers. Following the purchase by Virgin, the Northern Rock brand was gradually phased out during 2012. Upon buying Northern Rock, Virgin Money changed their logo to use both Virgin&#x27;s red and Northern Rock&#x27;s magenta colours.

==Board of directors==

Prior to the credit crisis the company had focused on developing its own staff, and most appointments, including the chief executive, were made internally.

At the time of the 2007 financial crisis Matt Ridley was the chairman and Adam Applegarth was the chief executive. Ridley resigned in October 2007 and Applegarth resigned in November 2007, although the latter stayed on in a caretaker role until December 2007. The chief financial officer was Andy Kuipers, who joined the company in 1987. After Applegarth&#x27;s departure, Kuipers became the interim chief executive prior to the nationalisation before retiring on 31 August 2008.

In February 2008, Ron Sandler was appointed executive chairman by the government. Gary Hoffman became chief executive of Northern Rock in October 2008. With the appointment of Gary Hoffman, Ron Sandler changed to a non-executive chairman position.

Since the split of the bank into Northern Rock plc and Northern Rock (Asset Management) plc on 1 January 2010, each company had its boards of directors. On 4 November 2010 Northern Rock announced that Gary Hoffman had left the bank and was to move to NBNK Investments as CEO. One of the stipulations of Hoffman&#x27;s appointment at NBNK was that they could not table a bid for Northern Rock for a period of 12 months.

Prior to being bought by Virgin the board of Northern Rock plc at 8 April 2010 was:
* Chairman: Ron Sandler
* Chief Executive: Gary Hoffman
* Chief Financial Officer: Jim McConville
* Executive Directors: Rick Hunkin
* Non-Executive Directors: Laurie Adams, Richard Coates, Mike Fairey, Mark Pain, Mary Phibbs

==Sponsorship==

The company sponsored many local sports clubs and events, including Newcastle United Football Club, Newcastle Falcons (rugby union), Newcastle Eagles (basketball), Durham and Middlesex County Cricket clubs, professional golfer Paul Eales and the cycling festival Northern Rock Cyclone.

The sponsorship of Newcastle United began in 2003, and was set to expire in 2010, before an extension to 2014. However this extension included a get-out clause in June 2012, which was activated in November 2011. While under government control the bank continued their sponsorship agreement. The five-year deal from 2005 to 2010 was worth £25 million, and the 4-year extension was to be worth between £1.5 million and £10 million. In 2012 after Virgin bought the bank, Virgin Money signed a 2-year deal to sponsor Newcastle United initially using the remaining time of Northern Rock&#x27;s deal that was cut short; this deal was again itself later cut short.

In 2005, to coincide with the Spirit of the Tall Ships Festival, Northern Rock enlisted the help of Red Box Interiors to create a temporary art installation at The Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art on the Gateshead Quay of the Tyne. The art entitled &quot;Northern Rock @ Baltic&quot; included mobile light stem sculptures and large scale external graphics.

Northern Rock sponsored the North East Premier League competition for recreational club cricket. In 2006 Northern Rock sponsored the All*Star Cup celebrity Golf match, which was shown on ITV. The bank also sponsors a junior golf tournament, The Northern Rock Junior Golf Festival, held at Matfen Hall.

In 2007, almost three weeks before the bank had to appeal to the Bank of England for an emergency loan, the bank bought the home ground of Newcastle Falcons Rugby Club, Kingston Park stadium for £15 million. In February 2008, documents relating to the sale came to light, attracting much criticism that the purchase has been made at a time of impending crisis. In late 2008 the bank sold Kingston Park Stadium to Northumbria University for an undisclosed fee. While under government control the bank continued to sponsor Newcastle Falcons; the sponsorship agreement with the Falcons came to an end before the start of the 2010/11 season.

==Northern Rock Foundation==
The company donated substantial amounts annually to its own independent charity, the Northern Rock Foundation.

The nationalisation of Northern Rock had a devastating impact on the local charity sector in the North East, which was funded almost entirely by dividends from Northern Rock. The largest shareholder in the bank was the Northern Rock Foundation, which owned 15% of the bank&#x27;s share capital. The charity did tremendous work with around £235 million spent on local charities and good causes. 

The charity wound up after handing out some of its last grants to good causes across the North East and Cumbria in 2015.

<doc id="499860" wikidata="Q434364" url="?curid=499860" title="Ulf Andersson">
<text>Ulf Andersson (born 27 June 1951) is a leading Swedish chess player. FIDE awarded him the International Master title in 1970 and the Grandmaster title in 1972.

==Chess career==
At his peak, Andersson reached number four on the FIDE rating list. Tournaments which he has won or shared first include the 1969 Swedish Chess Championship, Göteborg 1971, Dortmund 1973, Camagüey 1974, Cienfuegos 1975, Belgrade 1977, Buenos Aires 1978, Hastings 1978–79, Phillips &amp; Drew 1980, Johannesburg 1981, Phillips &amp; Drew 1982, Turin 1982, Wijk aan Zee 1983, Reggio Emilia 1985, Rome 1985, and Rome 1986. Andersson drew a six-game match against former world champion Mikhail Tal in 1983, and played top board in the second USSR versus The Rest of The World Match in 1984. He led the Swedish Chess Olympiad Team during the 1970s and 1980s, and reached his best personal result in the 23rd Chess Olympiad in Buenos Aires 1978, where he finished in third place on first board, after Viktor Korchnoi and Orestes Rodríguez Vargas. Now in his seventies, Andersson still participates in tournaments from time to time.

==Playing style==
Andersson is a very solid . He draws a high percentage of his games against fellow grandmasters . He is renowned as a great player of endgames, especially rook endgames, and is famous for winning seemingly &quot;unwinnable&quot; endgames, often in very long games . Jacob Aagaard wrote about Andersson in his book Excelling at Chess, stating: &quot;He is a very prophylactic player, seeing all kinds of tactics well in advance and avoiding pitfalls with great skill.&quot; Chess writer Dennis Monokroussos once remarked of Andersson&#x27;s style,
For most of us, if we&#x27;re playing a peer and major exchanges occur, a quick draw is the likely result ... for Andersson ... exchanges [are] often not the prelude to a quick draw but the signal that it [is] time for his opponent to start suffering.

==Correspondence play==
Andersson began playing correspondence chess in 1995, and became a correspondence chess grandmaster that same year. Very few players in history have been as successful as Andersson at both forms of chess. For Ulf, who struggled to keep his nerves in check during over-the-board chess and often avoided lines with any risk of loss, it was a relief to have ample time to consider the subtle nuances of each move. His correspondence games tend to be very tactical, which contrasts sharply with his style of play .

While in the process of winning in the &#x27;Norwegian Postal Chess Federation – 50 Years&#x27; tournament, he attained the highest provisional rating in ICCF history, with a score of 2821 on the 1998 list. After earning an established rating in 2002, he finally reached the top of the official rating list .

With computer assistance slowly taking over the world of correspondence chess, Ulf was one of the few players still competing without it in the early 2000s. However, as postal play gave way to faster-paced email tournaments, he found himself having to send moves before feeling satisfied with them to avoid losing on time. Declining a wildcard for the world championship, he quietly finished his last correspondence game in 2003, reflecting in retrospect that he found it too demanding. Despite the changing times he lost only a single official game throughout his correspondence chess career, to Hans-Marcus Elwert in the Millennium Email Chess Tournament, and is as of 2024 still the highest rated inactive player on the ICCF rating list.

<text>was a Japanese camera and optical equipment manufacturer. Currently, it exists as the Pentax Life Care Business Division of Hoya&#x27;s medical endoscope business, as well as the digital camera brand of Ricoh Imaging, a subsidiary of Ricoh.

Pentax, founded in 1919 as a town workshop specializing in polishing eyeglass lenses, developed Japan&#x27;s first single-lens reflex camera, the Asahiflex, in 1952. By 2006, Pentax&#x27;s domestic market share in digital cameras had declined to 4%. In 2007, Pentax was acquired by Hoya and subsequently merged with the company the following year. In 2011, Hoya spun off the Pentax brand&#x27;s digital camera business, which was then acquired by Ricoh, leading to the establishment of Pentax Ricoh Imaging (current Ricoh Imaging).

As a response to growing interest in film photography, Pentax launched the Pentax 17 on June 17, 2024. The Pentax 17 is a half-frame film camera. This launch marks the first Pentax film camera in over two decades.

==Corporate history==
=== Early history ===
The original company was founded as Asahi Optical Co Asahi Kogaku Goshi Kaisha in November 1919 by Kumao Kajiwara, at a shop in the Toshima suburb of Tokyo, and began producing spectacle lenses (which it still manufactures).

In 1938, it changed its name to ; by this time, it was also manufacturing camera/cine lenses. In the lead-up to World War II, Asahi Optical devoted much of its time to fulfilling military contracts for optical instruments. At the end of the war, Asahi Optical was disbanded by the occupying powers, being allowed to re-form in 1948. The company resumed its pre-war activities, manufacturing binoculars and consumer camera lenses for Konishiroku and Chiyoda Kōgaku Seikō (later Konica and Minolta respectively).

===Early 1950s to 2007===
The period around 1950 marked the return of the Japanese photographic industry to the vigorous level of the late 1930s, and its emergence as a major exporter. The newly reborn industry had sold many of its cameras to the occupation forces (having had far more disposable income than the Japanese), which were well received. The Korean War saw a huge influx of journalists and photographers to the Far East, where they were impressed by lenses from companies such as Nikon and Canon for their Leica rangefinder cameras, and also by bodies by these and other companies to supplement and replace the Leica and Contax cameras they were using.
In 1952, Asahi Optical introduced its first camera, the Asahiflex (the first Japanese SLR using 35mm film). The name &quot;Pentax&quot; was originally a registered trademark of the East German VEB Zeiss Ikon (from &quot;Pentaprism&quot; and &quot;Contax&quot;) and acquired by the Asahi Optical company in 1957. Since then the company has been primarily known for its photographic products, distributed 35mm equipment under the name &quot;Asahi Pentax&quot; and medium format 120 6x7cm equipment under the sub brand &quot;Pentax 6x7&quot; (from 1969 to 1990) and &quot;Pentax 67&quot; (from 1990 to 1999). Equipment was exported to the United States from the 1950s until the mid-1970s; being imported by Honeywell Corporation and branded as &quot;Heiland Pentax&quot; and later &quot;Honeywell Pentax&quot;. The company was renamed Pentax Corporation in 2002. It was one of the world&#x27;s largest optical companies, producing still cameras, binoculars, spectacle lenses, and a variety of other optical instruments. In 2004, Pentax had about 6000 employees.

===Merger with Hoya===
In December 2006, Pentax started the process of merging with Hoya Corporation to form &#x27;Hoya Pentax HD Corporation&#x27;. Hoya&#x27;s primary goal was to strengthen its medical-related business by taking advantage of Pentax&#x27;s technologies and expertise in the field of endoscopes, intraocular lenses, surgical loupes, biocompatible ceramics, etc. It was speculated that Pentax&#x27;s camera business could be sold off after the merger. A stock swap was to be completed by October 1, 2007, but the process was called off on April 11, 2007. Pentax president Fumio Urano resigned over the matter, with Takashi Watanuki taking over as president of Pentax. However, despite Watanuki&#x27;s previously stated opposition to a Hoya merger, on May 16 it was reported that Pentax had accepted &quot;with conditions&quot; a sweetened offer from Hoya, according to a source familiar with the matter. Pentax was under increasing pressure from its major shareholders, Sparx Asset Management in particular, to accept Hoya&#x27;s bid.

On August 6, 2007, Hoya completed a friendly public tender offer for Pentax and acquired 90.59% of the company. On August 14, 2007, the company became a consolidated subsidiary of Hoya. On October 29, 2007, Hoya and Pentax announced that Pentax would merge with and into Hoya effective on March 31, 2008. Hoya closed the Pentax-owned factory in Tokyo, and moved all manufacturing facilities to Cebu, Philippines and Hanoi, Vietnam.

===Ricoh Imaging Company===
On July 1, 2011, Hoya stated that it would sell its Pentax camera business to copier and printer maker Ricoh, in a deal the Nikkei business daily reported was worth about 10 billion yen ($124.2 million). On July 29, 2011, Hoya transferred its Pentax imaging systems business to a newly established subsidiary called Pentax Imaging Corporation. On October 1, 2011, Ricoh acquired all shares of Pentax Imaging Corp. and renamed the new subsidiary Pentax Ricoh Imaging Company, Ltd. Hoya will continue to use the Pentax brand name for their medical related products such as endoscopes. On August 1, 2013, the company name was changed to Ricoh Imaging Company Ltd.

==Products==

Asahi Optical Co Ltd is best known for Asahi Pentax 6x7 medium format film cameras and the later Pentax Corporation is best known for Pentax 67 medium format film cameras.

In 1990, the Asahi Optical Co. Ltd renamed the sub-brand from &quot;Pentax 6x7&quot; to Pentax 67. The company produced Pentax 67 cameras until 1999 and ceased trading in 2002.

The success of the &quot;Pentax&quot; series was such that the business eventually renamed itself &quot;Pentax Corporation&quot; after the 35mm product line. Although the corporation ultimately merged into Hoya Corporation, it eventually was purchased by Ricoh, which continues to develop and market digital cameras under the Pentax brand. Currently, Pentax DSLRs are manufactured in Cebu, Philippines, while digital Pentax lenses are manufactured in Hanoi, Vietnam, under Pentax Ricoh Imaging Products.

In June 17, 2024, Pentax launched their latest product, the Pentax 17. The Pentax 17 is a half-frame camera with a fixed zone focusing lens, a magnesium alloy body, and a price tag of $500. The Pentax 17 is the company&#x27;s first film camera in over two decades. 

==Corporate cooperation and competition==
In 2005, Pentax Corporation partnered with Samsung to share work on camera technology and recapture market ground from Nikon and Canon. Pentax and Samsung subsequently released new DSLR siblings from this agreement. The Pentax *ist DS and *istDL2 also appeared as the Samsung GX-1S and GX-1L, while the jointly developed (90% Pentax and 10% Samsung) Pentax K10D and K20D gave birth to the Samsung GX-10 and GX-20 respectively. Some Pentax lenses are also rebranded and sold as Samsung Schneider Kreuznach D-Xenon and D-Xenogon lenses for Samsung DSLRs. However, both brands are completely compatible with Pentax and Samsung DSLRs. In 2017, Samsung announced its departure of the camera market.

Hoya is focusing its main business on the following areas: information technology, eye care, life care, optics, imaging systems. Pentax’s main competitors include Canon, Nikon, Olympus, Panasonic, Sony (imaging/camera business), Fujifilm, Sangi, Kyocera (life care business).

<text>Wang Yung-ching (; 18 January 1917 – 15 October 2008), also called YC Wang, was a Taiwanese businessman. He was best known for being the chairman of Formosa Plastics Corporation, one of Taiwan&#x27;s foremost plastic manufacturing establishments until his retirement in June 2006, where he stepped down at the age of 89. 

In 2008, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked him as the 178th richest person in the world with an estimated net worth of US$5.5 billion.

Despite lacking any formal schooling beyond elementary school, he was ranked 2nd in the &quot;Forbes&quot; list of Taiwan&#x27;s Richest in 2008.

== Early life and career ==
Wang was born in Chyokutan jō, Shinden ku, Shinden shichō, Taihoku Chō (modern-day Chitan Village, Xindian District, New Taipei City) in then-Japan-ruled-Taiwan.

In 1995, Wang signed a contract with Marco Terragni (chairman of Italproducts) to create Inteplast, the biggest company in the world for the production of Cartonplast.

Wang served as the chairman of the board of Formosa Plastics Corporation, one of the largest plastic manufacturers in the world, until June 2006, when he stepped down at the age of 89. He remained chairman of the boards of Nan Ya Plastics Corporation, Formosa Chemistry &amp; Fibre Corporation, and Cyma Plywood &amp; Lumber Co. Ltd, but indicated his intention to gradually resign from these positions to focus on his retirement. He was chairman of Ming-chi Institute of Technology, and Chang Gung Medical Foundation. After his death, Wang&#x27;s position at Chang Gung was taken over by his younger brother Wang Yung-tsai, and then third wife Lee Pao-chu. He had been a vocal supporter of the Three Links between Taiwan and Mainland China.

Wang&#x27;s first marriage was to Wang (née Guo) Yueh-lan, with whom he had no children. His second marriage to Yang Chiao produced Wang&#x27;s first child, making a total of five. Wang later married a third time in 1935 to Lee Pao-chu. Wang and Lee had another five children; Wang fathered a total of ten. His eldest son from his second marriage with Yang Chiao, Winston Wang, founded Grace Semiconductor Manufacturing with Jiang Mianheng, the son of former Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin in 2000. A daughter from his second marriage, Charlene Wang founded Taiwan-based First International Computer, Inc. Another daughter, Cher Wang, founded High Tech Computer (HTC) and VIA Technologies. Among the Wang siblings, Cher has come closest to rivaling her father&#x27;s wealth. In 2011, Forbes estimated Cher Wang&#x27;s personal fortune at $8.8 billion, making her the wealthiest individual in Taiwan at the time.

Wang passed away in his sleep on October 15, 2008 at his home in Short Hills, New Jersey. He was 91 years old.

The family struggles which followed his death led to the discovery that he had engaged in extensive tax evasion and had stashed billions of dollars offshore.

<doc id="499932" wikidata="Q1546934" url="?curid=499932" title="Grimsay">
<text>Grimsay () is a tidal island in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland.

==Geography==
Grimsay is the largest of the low-lying stepping-stones which convey the Oitir Mhòr (North Ford) causeway, a arc of single track road linking North Uist and Benbecula via the western tip of Grimsay. Until it opened in 1960, a ferry linked Carinish (on North Uist) with Gramsdale (on Benbecula), but could only operate at high tide. There was also a ford which could only be crossed close to low water, usually only with a guide. For significant parts of each day the North Ford was too wet to ford and not wet enough to cross by ferry. East of Grimsay lie several smaller islands including Ronay which was inhabited until 1931.

==Inhabitants==
The island&#x27;s population was 169 as recorded by the 2011 census a drop of over 15% since 2001 when there were 201 usual residents. During the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702. The main settlements are Baymore (&quot;Bàgh Mòr&quot;) and Kallin (&quot;Ceallan&quot;) at the eastern end of the island. Grimsay has a harbour at Kallin, which is the base to a sizeable shellfish industry, the island&#x27;s main industry, mostly for lobster, prawns and scallops. Also in Kallin is The Boatshed, a marine repair facility which promotes traditional skills, and employs a full-time boatbuilder and trainee. Three generations of Stewart family built as many as 1,000 boats from three sheds on Grimsay. Grimsay is encircled by a single-track road that links most of the island&#x27;s small croft and fishing settlements together.

==History==
There is a fine example of an Iron-Age wheelhouse on the northeast coast of the island at Bàgh nam Feadag. It is one of the best examples of a wheelhouse on North Uist but does not appear on Ordnance Survey maps.

<doc id="499947" wikidata="Q846861" url="?curid=499947" title="List of sunken nuclear submarines">
<text>Nine nuclear submarines have sunk, either by accident or by scuttling. The Soviet Navy lost five (one of which sank twice), the Russian Navy two, and the United States Navy (USN) two.

Three submarines were lost with all hands: the two from the United States Navy (129 and 99 lives lost) and one from the Russian Navy (118 lives lost). These are amongst the largest losses of life in a submarine (along with the non-nuclear with 102 lives lost and with 130 lives lost). All sank as a result of accident except for , which was scuttled in the Kara Sea when proper decommissioning was considered too expensive. The Soviet submarine carried nuclear ballistic missiles when it was lost with all hands, but as it was a diesel-electric submarine, it is not included in the list. (&quot;K-129&quot; was partly recovered by the U.S. Project Azorian.)

The two USN submarines belonged to Submarine Force Atlantic, in the U.S. Atlantic Fleet. All five of the Soviet/Russian nuclear submarines that remain sunken belonged to the Northern Fleet, while the refloated was in the Pacific Fleet.

Of the nine sinkings, two were caused by fires, two by weapon explosions, two by flooding, one by bad weather, and one by scuttling due to a damaged nuclear reactor. Only &#x27;s reason for sinking is unknown. Eight of the submarines are underwater wrecks in the Northern Hemisphere: five of these in the Atlantic Ocean and three in the Arctic Ocean. The ninth submarine, &quot;K-429&quot;, was raised and returned to active duty after both of her sinkings.

==United States==
*, the first submarine in her class, sank April 10, 1963 during deep-diving trials after reactor scram, loss of propulsion, and a failed attempt to blow the emergency ballast tanks, causing it to exceed crush depth. All 129 on board died, including shipyard personnel supporting the deep-diving tests. Location: east of Cape Cod.
*, a , sank May 22, 1968, evidently due to implosion upon reaching crush depth. The results of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s various investigations into the loss of &quot;Scorpion&quot; are inconclusive. There are various theories about the loss. All 99 men on board died. Location: southwest of the Azores.
*: sank May 15, 1969 while pier-side in shipyard due to improper ballasting. The submarine was eventually completed and commissioned.

==Soviet Union==
*: The only Project 645 submarine (a variant of the Project 627 , with liquid metal cooled reactors), &quot;K-27&quot; was decommissioned in 1979 after many years of difficulty with its reactor. On September 6, 1982, the Soviet Navy scuttled it in shallow water () in the Kara Sea after sealing the reactor compartment. This sinking in shallow water was contrary to the recommendation of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
*: A Project 627 November-class submarine was lost on April 11, 1970 while being towed in rough seas after a fire on board. The submarine&#x27;s crew was initially evacuated to a surface vessel, but 52 re-boarded the surfaced submarine for the towing operation. All 52 sailors died when the submarine flooded and sank, for total losses of 60 crew when counting the 8 who perished on April 8 in the initial fire. Location: Bay of Biscay, northwest of Spain in the North Atlantic Ocean.
*: A Project 667A Yankee I-class submarine was damaged by a fire in a missile tube and explosion on October 3, 1986. It then sank suddenly while being towed after all surviving crewmen had transferred off. Six crew members were killed. Location: east of Bermuda in the North Atlantic Ocean.
*K-278 &quot;Komsomolets&quot;: The only Mike-class sub built sank due to a raging fire April 7, 1989. All but five crewmen evacuated before it sank. A total of 42 crew died, many from smoke inhalation and exposure to the cold waters of the Barents Sea, while 27 crew members survived.
*: A Project 670A Charlie I-class sub sank twice, once at sea from flooding during a test dive (23 June 1983), then two years later (13 September 1985), from flooding at her moorings. Sixteen crew died in the first incident. &quot;K-429&quot; was raised after both sinkings, and was decommissioned two years after the second.

==Russia==
*: The Oscar II-class sub sank in the Barents Sea on August 12, 2000 after an explosion in the torpedo compartment. See Kursk submarine disaster. All 118 men on board were killed. All except the bow section was salvaged.
*: Left to rust for 14 years after being decommissioned, this Soviet-era November-class submarine sank in the Barents Sea on August 28, 2003, when a storm ripped away the pontoons necessary to keep it afloat under tow. Nine of the ten salvage men on board were killed.

<doc id="499949" wikidata="Q956655" url="?curid=499949" title="Alexander Zaitsev (pair skater)">
<text>Alexander Gennadyevich Zaitsev (, born 16 June 1952) is a Russian retired pair skater who represented the Soviet Union. With partner Irina Rodnina, he is a two-time (1976, 1980) Olympic champion, six-time World champion and seven-time European champion. They were coached by Stanislav Zhuk and later Tatiana Tarasova in Moscow.

From 1973 to 1980 they won every event they entered and are, to date, the most decorated pair team of all time.

== Career ==
In April 1972, Zaitsev was recommended by Stanislav Zhuk to Irina Rodnina as a potential partner. She was already a four-time World champion and 1972 Olympic gold medalist with her previous partner Alexei Ulanov, who had left her to skate with Lyudmila Smirnova. Zaitsev was three years younger than Rodnina and was much less seasoned but learned quickly. He was from Leningrad (Saint Petersburg) while she was from Moscow.

Rodnina / Zaitsev&#x27;s music stopped during their short program at the 1973 World Championships, possibly due to a Czech worker acting in retaliation for the suppression of the Prague Spring. Known for intense concentration, they finished the program in silence, earning a standing ovation and a gold medal upon completion, ahead of Smirnova / Ulanov, whom they again defeated in 1974.

In 1974, Rodnina / Zaitsev left Zhuk, with whom the working relationship had become strained, to train with Tatiana Tarasova. They won six consecutive World titles together, as well as seven European gold medals, and won their first Olympic title together in 1976. Rodnina / Zaitsev did not compete during the 1978–79 season because she was pregnant with their son, who was born on 23 February 1979. They returned in 1980 to capture their second Olympic title together and Rodnina&#x27;s third. They then retired from competitive skating. In 2023, Zaitsev&#x27;s medal for the 1980 Olympics was sold at the RR Auction auction house for $93,000 (including the buyer&#x27;s premium). Zaitsev himself said that he had nothing to do with the sale, the medal was kept by the parents of his ex-wife.

After retiring from competition, Zaitsev became a coach and for a time was involved in the administration of the sport.

== Personal life ==
Rodnina and Zaitsev were married in April 1975. Their son, also named Alexander, was born in 1979. The pair later divorced.

<doc id="499963" wikidata="Q232840" url="?curid=499963" title="Honor Blackman">
<text>Honor Blackman (22 August 1925 – 5 April 2020) was an English actress and singer, known for the roles of Cathy Gale in &quot;The Avengers&quot; (1962–1964), Bond girl Pussy Galore in &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (1964), Julia Daggett in &quot;Shalako&quot; (1968), and Hera in &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot; (1963). She is also known for her role as Laura West in the ITV sitcom &quot;The Upper Hand&quot; (1990–1996).

==Early life==
Honor Blackman was born on 22 August 1925 at 200 Cumberland Road, Canning Town, West Ham, England, the daughter of Edith Eliza (Stokes) and Frederick Blackman, a civil service statistician. She attended North Ealing Primary School and Ealing County Grammar School for Girls. For her 15th birthday, her parents gave her acting lessons and began her training at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in 1940. While attending the Guildhall School, Blackman worked as a clerical assistant for the Home Office. Following graduation, she was an understudy in the West End play &quot;The Guinea Pig&quot;. In 1947 she appeared in the Patrick Hastings play &quot;The Blind Goddess&quot; at the Apollo Theatre.

== Career ==

===Films===
Blackman&#x27;s film debut was a nonspeaking part in &quot;Fame Is the Spur&quot; (1947). Her other films include &quot;Quartet&quot; (1948), based on short stories by W. Somerset Maugham, starring Dirk Bogarde; &quot;Diamond City&quot; (1949), &quot;So Long at the Fair&quot; (1950), in which she again appeared with Dirk Bogarde; &quot;Green Grow the Rushes&quot; (1951), alongside Roger Livesey and Richard Burton; &quot;A Night to Remember&quot; (1958), an account of the &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster; the comedy &quot;The Square Peg&quot; (1958); &quot;Life at the Top&quot; (1965) with Laurence Harvey; &quot;The Virgin and the Gypsy&quot; (1970), and the Western films &quot;Shalako&quot; (1968) with Sean Connery and Brigitte Bardot, and &quot;Something Big&quot; (1971) with Dean Martin.
She played Hera in &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot; (1963), which featured stop-motion animation by Ray Harryhausen. She had roles in the films &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot; (2001) and &quot;Jack Brown and the Curse of the Crown&quot; (also 2001).

====James Bond====
During the 1960s, Blackman practised judo at the Budokwai dojo. This helped her prepare for her roles as Cathy Gale in &quot;The Avengers&quot; and Pussy Galore in &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (1964).

Albert R. Broccoli said Blackman was cast opposite Sean Connery in the Bond film on the basis of her success in the British television series &quot;The Avengers&quot;. He knew that most American audiences would not have seen the programme. Broccoli said, &quot;The Brits would love her because they knew her as Mrs. Gale[;] the Yanks would like her because she was so good—it was a perfect combination.&quot;

===Theatre===
In 1968, Blackman appeared opposite John Neville and Hylda Baker in the musical play &quot;Mr &amp; Mrs&quot;, based on the plays of Noël Coward. In the late 1970s, she toured Australia and New Zealand and Canada with Michael Craig and Colleen Clifford in the comedy play &quot;Move Over, Mrs Markham&quot;. In February 1979, she starred in Stephen Barry&#x27;s production of Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Night and Day&quot; at the Perth Playhouse, coinciding with Stoppard&#x27;s presence as a participant in the Festival of Perth.

In 1981, she appeared in a London revival of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; opposite Petula Clark. The production opened to rave reviews and the largest advance sale in British theatre history to that time. She spent most of 1987 at the Fortune Theatre starring as the Mother Superior in the West End production of &quot;Nunsense&quot;.

Blackman returned to the theatre in 2005, touring through 2006 with a production of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, in which she played Mrs. Higgins. She developed a one-woman show, &quot;Word of Honor&quot;, which premiered in October 2006. From April to September 2007, Blackman took over the role of Fraulein Schneider in &quot;Cabaret&quot; at the Lyric Theatre in London&#x27;s West End.

===Television===

Blackman started acting on television in the recurring role of Nicole, secretary/assistant to Dan Dailey&#x27;s character of Tim Collier in the television series &quot;The Four Just Men&quot; (1959). In a 1960 episode of &quot;Danger Man&quot; titled &quot;Colonel Rodriguez&quot; she played Joan Bernard. In an episode of &quot;The Saint&quot; titled &quot;The Arrow of God&quot; (1962), Blackman played an adulterous personal secretary named Pauline Stone, who became one of several suspects in the murder of a despised gossip columnist.

In &quot;The Avengers&quot; from 1962 to 1964, she played Dr Cathy Gale, a self-assured, quick-witted anthropologist who was skilled in judo and had a passion for leather clothes. Gale was unlike any female character seen before on British TV. Blackman left the series after its third season to co-star in the James Bond film &quot;Goldfinger&quot;.

In an episode of &quot;The Avengers&quot;, &quot;Too Many Christmas Trees&quot; (1965), John Steed received a Christmas card from Cathy Gale. Reading the envelope, he says in a puzzled voice, &quot;Whatever can she be doing at Fort Knox ...?&quot; It was an inside joke, as Blackman was filming &quot;Goldfinger&quot; at the time.

In December 1969 and February 1993, Blackman was taken by surprise as the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;. In 1972, Blackman (as a special guest star) and Richard Basehart played a married pair of Shakespearean actors who commit murder in the American crime mystery series &quot;Columbo&quot; (episode &quot;Dagger of the Mind&quot;). In 1983, she appeared in a film production of Agatha Christie″s novel, &quot;The Secret Adversary&quot;, in the role of Rita Vandemeyer, and as Juno/Empress Eugénie in the BBC television production of &quot;Orpheus in the Underworld&quot;.

In 1986, she had a role in &quot;Terror of the Vervoids&quot;, a segment of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot;. From 1990 to 1996, she appeared as Laura West on &quot;The Upper Hand&quot;. In 2003, Blackman took a guest role on &quot;Midsomer Murders,&quot; as ex-racing driver Isobel Hewitt in the episode &quot;A Talent for Life&quot;. In September 2004, she briefly joined the &quot;Coronation Street&quot; cast in a storyline about wife swapping. In 2007, she participated in the BBC TV project &quot;The Verdict&quot;. She was one of 12 well-known figures who made up a jury to hear a fictional rape case. The series was designed to explore the jury system. She was sworn in as a juror as &quot;Honor Kaufmann&quot;. In 2013, she guest-starred in the BBC medical drama &quot;Casualty&quot; and in &quot;By Any Means&quot;.

Blackman also appeared in a number of episodes of &quot;Never the Twain&quot; with Donald Sinden and Windsor Davies as veterinarian Veronica Barton.

===Singing career===
Blackman&#x27;s recording with &quot;The Avengers&quot; co-star Patrick Macnee of &quot;Kinky Boots&quot; (1964), referring to the boots she wore in the show, failed to chart upon its original release, but became a surprise hit in 1990. The song peaked at number five after being played incessantly by BBC Radio 1 breakfast-show presenter Simon Mayo. After her appearance in &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, Blackman recorded a full album of songs titled &quot;Everything I&#x27;ve Got&quot;.

In 1968, Blackman released a 45 rpm record of &quot;Before Today&quot;/&quot;I&#x27;ll Always Be Loving You&quot; (CBS 3896), which were featured in the musical play &quot;Mr &amp; Mrs&quot;. In 1983, she sang as Juno in a special TV production of Jacques Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;Orpheus in the Underworld&quot;.

On 6 July 2009, Blackman released a new single, &quot;The Star Who Fell from Grace&quot;, composed by Jeff Chegwin and Adrian Munsey. She also compèred the James Bond Prom, part of the &quot;Welsh Proms&quot; concert series in 2009.

===Other roles===
Blackman appeared as Anahita in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio drama &quot;The Children of Seth&quot;, released in December 2011.

==Personal life==

Blackman was married to Walter &quot;Bill&quot; Sankey from 1948 to 1954. After their divorce, she married British actor Maurice Kaufmann (1961–75). They appeared together in the thriller film &quot;Fright&quot; (1971) and some stage productions. They adopted two children, Lottie (1967) and Barnaby (1968).

After her divorce from Kaufmann, she did not remarry and stated that she preferred being single. She enjoyed watching football.

Blackman owned a summer house in Islesboro, Maine, United States.

Blackman died at her home in Lewes, East Sussex, on 5 April 2020, aged 94, from natural causes.

===Politics===
Blackman was a British Republican, a member of the Liberal Democrats and was previously a member of the Liberal Party, campaigning for the party during the 1964 general election. She declined a CBE in 2002, as she felt that as a republican it would be hypocritical to accept the award. She publicly supported changing the British electoral system from first-past-the-post to alternative vote for electing members to the House of Commons in the Alternative Vote referendum in 2011.

In 2012, Blackman publicly criticised actor Sean Connery, her Bond co-star in the 1960s, for his status as a tax exile. She said, &quot;I disapprove of him strongly now. Because I don&#x27;t think you should accept a title from a country and then pay absolutely no tax towards it. He wants it both ways. I don&#x27;t think his principles are very high.&quot;

Following the death of Margaret Thatcher in April 2013, when asked about her thoughts on Thatcher, Blackman responded:

<text>Erskine Preston Caldwell (December 17, 1903 – April 11, 1987) was an American novelist and short story writer. His writings about poverty, racism and social problems in his native Southern United States, in novels such as &quot;Tobacco Road&quot; (1932) and &quot;God&#x27;s Little Acre&quot; (1933), won him critical acclaim. 

With cumulative sales of 10 million and 14 million copies, respectively, &quot;Tobacco Road&quot; and &quot;God&#x27;s Little Acre&quot; rank as two of the best-selling American novels, all-time, with the former being adapted into a 1933 play that set a Broadway record for consecutive performances, since surpassed.

==Early years==
Caldwell was born on December 17, 1903, in the small town of White Oak, Coweta County, Georgia. He was the only child of Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church minister Ira Sylvester Caldwell and his wife Caroline Preston (née Bell) Caldwell, a schoolteacher. Rev. Caldwell&#x27;s ministry required moving the family often, to places including Florida, Virginia, Tennessee, South Carolina and North Carolina. When he was 15 years old, his family settled in Wrens, Georgia. His mother Caroline was from Virginia. Her ancestry included English nobility which held large land grants in eastern Virginia. Both her English ancestors and Scots-Irish ancestors fought in the American Revolution. Ira Caldwell&#x27;s ancestors were Scots-Irish and had also been in America since before the revolution and had fought in it.

Caldwell&#x27;s mother, a former teacher, tutored her son at home. Caldwell was 14 when he first attended a school.&lt;ref name=&quot;apnews/Caldwell-Dead&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Caldwell attended but did not graduate from Erskine College, a Presbyterian school in nearby South Carolina.

==Career==

He dropped out of Erskine College to sign aboard a boat supplying guns to Central America. Caldwell entered the University of Virginia with a scholarship from the United Daughters of the Confederacy, but was enrolled for only a year. He then became a football player, bodyguard, and salesman of &quot;bad&quot; real estate.

After two more enrollments at college, Caldwell went to work for the Atlanta Journal, leaving in 1925 after a year, then moving to Maine where he stayed for five years, producing a story that won a Yale Review award for fiction and two novels of the Georgia poor.

Caldwell&#x27;s first published works were &quot;The Bastard&quot; (1929) and &quot;Poor Fool&quot; (1930), but the works for which he is most famous are his novels &quot;Tobacco Road&quot; (1932) and &quot;God&#x27;s Little Acre&quot; (1933). His first book, &quot;The Bastard&quot;, was banned and copies of it were seized by authorities. With the publication of &quot;God&#x27;s Little Acre&quot;, the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice instigated legal action against him for &quot;The Bastard&quot;. Caldwell was arrested at a book-signing there but was exonerated in court.

In 1941, Caldwell reported from the USSR for Life magazine, CBS radio and the newspaper PM. He wrote movie scripts for about five years. Caldwell wrote articles from Mexico and Czechoslovakia for the North American Newspaper Alliance.

==Personal life==

Through the 1930s Caldwell and his first wife Helen managed a bookstore in Maine. Following their divorce Caldwell married photographer Margaret Bourke-White, collaborating with her on three photo-documentaries: &quot;You Have Seen Their Faces&quot; (1937), &quot;North of the Danube&quot; (1939), and &quot;Say, Is This The USA&quot; (1941). During World War II, Caldwell obtained a visa from the USSR that allowed him to travel to Ukraine and work as a foreign correspondent, documenting the war effort there.

After he returned from World War II, Caldwell took up residence in Connecticut, then in Arizona with third wife, June Johnson (J.C. Martin). In 1957, Caldwell married Virginia Moffett Fletcher Caldwell Hibbs, who had drawn illustrations for a recent book of his, moving to Twin Peaks in San Francisco,&lt;ref name=&quot;theatlantic/1958/640113&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; later moving to Paradise Valley, Arizona, in 1977.&lt;ref name=&quot;tucson/caldwells-son&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Of his residence in the San Francisco Bay Area, he once said: &quot;I live outside San Francisco. That&#x27;s not exactly the United States.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;stripes/caldwell-1.21406&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During the last twenty years of his life, his routine was to travel the world for six months of each year, taking with him notebooks in which to jot down his ideas. Many of these notebooks were not published but can be examined in a museum dedicated to him in the town square of Moreland, Georgia, where the home in which he was born was relocated and dedicated to his memory.

Caldwell, a heavy smoker, died from complications of emphysema and lung cancer on April 11, 1987, in Paradise Valley, Arizona. He is buried in Scenic Hills Memorial Park, Ashland, Oregon. Although he never lived there, his stepson and fourth wife, Virginia Moffett Fletcher Caldwell Hibbs, did, and wished him to be buried near his family. Virginia died in December 2017 at age 98.

Caldwell&#x27;s grandson, Adam Hunter Caldwell, is a fine arts instructor at Academy of Art University.&lt;ref name=&quot;hieronymusobjects/adam-caldwell&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Erskine Caldwell&#x27;s political sympathies were with the working class, and he used his experiences with farmers and common workers to write stories portraying their lives and struggles. Later in life he presented public seminars on the typical conditions of tenant-sharecroppers in the South.

Disillusionment with the government led Caldwell to compose a short story published in 1933, &quot;A Message for Genevieve&quot;. In this story a woman journalist is executed by a firing squad after being tried in a secret court on charges of espionage.

==Works==
Caldwell wrote 25 novels, 150 short stories, twelve nonfiction collections, two autobiographies, and two books for young readers. He also edited the influential American Folkways series, a 28-volume series of books about different regions of the United States.

<doc id="499972" wikidata="Q1815399" url="?curid=499972" title="South African Army">
<text>The South African Army is the principal land warfare force of South Africa, a part of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF), along with the South African Air Force, South African Navy and South African Military Health Service. The Army is commanded by the Chief of the Army, who is subordinate to the Chief of the SANDF.

Formed in 1912, as the Union Defence Force in the Union of South Africa, through the amalgamation of the South African colonial forces following the unification of South Africa. It evolved within the tradition of frontier warfare fought by Boer Commando (militia) forces, reinforced by the Afrikaners&#x27; historical distrust of large standing armies. Following the ascension to power of the National Party, the Army&#x27;s long-standing Commonwealth ties were afterwards cut.

The South African Army was fundamentally changed by the end of Apartheid and its preceding upheavals, as the South African Defence Force became the SANDF. This process also led to the rank and age balance of the army deteriorating desperately, though this has greatly improved.

During its history, the South African Army has fought in a number of major wars, including the First and Second World Wars, Rhodesian Bush War, and the long and bitter Border War. The South African Army has also been involved in many peacekeeping operations such as in the Lesotho intervention, Central African Republic Civil War, and multiple counter-insurgencies in Africa; often under the auspices of the United Nations, or as part of wider African Union operations in Southern Africa. It also played a key role in controlling sectarian political violence inside South Africa during the late 1980s and early 1990s.

==History==

After the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910, General Jan Smuts, the Union&#x27;s first Minister of Defence, placed a high priority on creating a unified military out of the separate armies of the union&#x27;s four provinces (the British Cape Colonial Forces, and the forces of the Natal Colony, the Transvaal, and the Orange River Colony). The Defence Act (No. 13) of 1912 established a Union Defence Force (UDF) that included a Permanent Force (or standing army) of career soldiers, an Active Citizen Force of temporary conscripts and volunteers as well as a Cadet organisation. The 1912 law also obliged all white males between seventeen and sixty years of age to serve in the military, but this was not strictly enforced as there were a large number of volunteers. Instead, half of the white males aged from 17 to 25 were drafted by lots into the ACF. For training purposes, the Union was divided into 15 military districts.

Initially, the Permanent Force consisted of five regiments of the South African Mounted Riflemen (SAMR), each with a battery of artillery attached. Dorning says that &#x27;..the SAMR was in reality a military constabulary similar to the Cape Mounted Riflemen, tasked primarily with police work in their respective geographical areas.&#x27; In 1913 and 1914, the new 23,400-member Citizen Force was called on to suppress several industrial strikes on the Witwatersrand.

In accordance with the 1912 Defence Act, the Active Citizen Force was established under Brig. Gen. C.F. Beyers on 1 July 1913. The authorised strength of the ACF and Coast Garrison Force was 25,155 and by 31 December actual strength stood at 23,462.

===First World War===

Following the British declaration of war against Germany on 4 August 1914, South Africa was an extension of the British war effort due to her status as a Dominion within the Empire. Although self-governing, South Africa, along with other Dominions such as Australia, Canada and New Zealand, were only semi-independent from Britain.

General Louis Botha, the then prime minister, faced widespread Afrikaner opposition to fighting alongside Great Britain so soon after the Second Boer War, and had to quell a military rebellion by some of the more extremist elements before he could send an expeditionary force of some 67,000 troops to invade German South West Africa (now Namibia). The German troops stationed there eventually surrendered to the South African forces in July 1915. In 1920 South Africa received a League of Nations mandate to govern the former German colony and to prepare it for independence within a few years, however South African occupation continued, illegally, until 1990.

Later, the South African Infantry Brigade, and various other supporting units such as the South African Native Labour Corps, were deployed to France in order to fight on the Western Front as the South African Overseas Expeditionary Force under British command. The 1st South African Brigade consisted of four infantry battalion sized regiments, representing men from all four provinces of the Union of South Africa, as well as Rhodesia. The 1st Regiment was from the Cape Province, the 2nd Regiment was from Natal and the Orange Free State and the 3rd Regiment was from Transvaal and Rhodesia. The 4th Regiment was called the &quot;South African Scottish&quot; and was raised from members of the Transvaal Scottish and the Cape Town Highlanders; they wore the Atholl Murray tartan. Supporting units included five batteries of heavy artillery, a field ambulance unit, a Royal Engineers signals company and a military hospital.
The most costly action that the South African forces on the Western Front fought in was the Battle of Delville Wood in 1916 – of the 3,000 men from the brigade who entered the wood, only 768 emerged unscathed. Another tragic loss of life for the South African forces during the war was the Mendi sinking on 21 February 1917, when the troopship Mendi – while transporting 607 members of the South African Native Labour Corps from Britain to France – was struck and cut almost in half by another ship.

In addition, the war against the German and Askari forces in German East Africa also involved more than 20,000 South African troops; they fought under General Jan Smuts&#x27;s command when he directed the British campaign against there in 1915. (During the war, the army was led by General Smuts, who had re-joined the army from his position as Minister of Defence on the outbreak of the war.)

Coloured South Africans also saw notable action with the Cape Corps in Palestine.

With a population of roughly 6 million, between 1914 - 1918, over 250,000 South Africans of all races voluntarily served their country. Thousands more served in the British Army directly, with over 3,000 joining the British Royal Flying Corps and over 100 volunteering for the Royal Navy. More than 146,000 whites, 83,000 black Africans and 2,500 Coloureds and Asians also served in either German South-West Africa, East Africa, the Middle East, or on the Western Front in Europe. Suffering roughly 19,000 casualties, over 7,000 South Africans were killed, and nearly 12,000 were wounded during the course of the war. Eight South Africans won the Victoria Cross for gallantry, the Empire&#x27;s highest and prestigious military medal. The Battle of Delville Wood and the sinking of the SS &quot;Mendi&quot; being the greatest single incidents of loss of life.

===Interwar period===
Wartime casualties and post-war demobilisation weakened the UDF. New legislation in 1922 re-established conscription for white males over the age of 21 for four years of military training and service and re-constituted the Permanent Force. UDF troops assumed internal security tasks in South Africa and quelled several revolts against South African domination in South-West Africa. South Africans suffered high casualties, especially in 1922, when an independent group of Khoikhoi – known as the Bondelswarts-Herero for the black bands that they wore into battle – led one of numerous revolts; in 1925, when a mixed-race population – the Basters – demanded cultural autonomy and political independence; and in 1932, when the Ovambo (Ambo) population along the border with Angola demanded an end to South African domination. During the Rand strike of 1922, 14,000 members of the ACF and certain A class reservists were called up.

Expenditure cuts saw the UDF as a whole reduced. The last remaining regiment of the South Africa Mounted Riflemen was disbanded on 31 March 1926 and the number of military districts was reduced from 16 to six on 1 April 1926. The Brigade HQ of the SA Field Artillery was also disbanded. In 1933 the six military districts were redesignated Commands. As a result of its conscription policies, the UDF increased its active-duty forces to 56,000 by the late 1930s; 100,000 men also belonged to the National Riflemen&#x27;s Reserve, which provided weapons training and practice.

===Second World War===

During World War II, the South African Army fought in the East African, North African and Italian campaigns. In 1939, the army at home in South Africa was divided between a number of regional commands. These included Cape Command (with its headquarters at the Castle of Good Hope, Cape Town), Orange Free State Command, Natal Command, Witwatersrand Command (5th and 9th Brigades plus the Transvaal Horse Artillery), Robert&#x27;s Heights and Transvaal Command (HQ Robert&#x27;s Heights) and Eastern Province Command at East London.

With the declaration of war in September 1939, the South African Army numbered only 5,353 regulars, with an additional 14,631 men of the Active Citizen Force (ACF) which gave peace time training to volunteers and in time of war would form the main body of the army. Pre-war plans did not anticipate that the army would fight outside southern Africa and it was trained and equipped only for bush warfare.

One of the problems to continuously face South Africa during the war was the shortage of available men. Due to its racial policies it would only consider arming men of European descent, which limited the available pool of men aged between 20 and 40 to around 320,000. In addition the declaration of war on Germany had the support of only a narrow majority in the South African parliament and was far from universally popular. Indeed, there was a significant minority actively opposed to the war and under these conditions conscription was never an option. The expansion of the army and its deployment overseas depended entirely on volunteers.

The 1st South African Infantry Division took part in several actions in East Africa in 1940, North Africa in 1941 and 1942, including the Second Battle of El Alamein, before being withdrawn to South Africa.

The 2nd South African Infantry Division also took part in a number of actions in North Africa during 1942, but on 21 June 1942 two complete infantry brigades of the division as well as most of the supporting units were captured at the fall of Tobruk.

The 3rd South African Infantry Division never took an active part in any battles but instead organised and trained the South African home defence forces, performed garrison duties and supplied replacements for the South African 1st Infantry Division and the South African 2nd Infantry Division. However, one of this division&#x27;s constituent brigades – 7th South African Infantry Battalion in Phalaborwa – did take part in the invasion of Madagascar in 1942.

The 6th South African Armoured Division fought in numerous actions in Italy from 1944 to 1945.

Of the 334,000 men volunteered for full time service in the South African Army during the war (including some 211,000 whites, 77,000 blacks and 46,000 Cape Coloureds and Asians), about 9,000 were killed in action, though the Commonwealth War Graves Commission has records of 11,023 known South African war dead during World War II.
===Post-war period===
Wartime expansion was again followed by rapid demobilisation after World War II. By then, a century of Anglo-Boer clashes followed by decades of growing British influence in South Africa had fuelled Afrikaner resentment. Resurgent Afrikaner nationalism was an important factor in the growth of the National Party (NP) as the 1948 elections approached.
After the narrow election victory by the NP in 1948, the government began the steady Afrikanerisation of the military; it expanded military service obligations and enforced conscription laws more strictly. Most UDF conscripts underwent three months of Citizen Force training in their first year of service, and an additional three weeks of training each year for four years after that.

In 1948, the new Minister of Defence, Frans Erasmus, aimed &#x27; to level the playing-fields&#x27; within the Union Defence Force, which was strongly British-oriented in usages, structures, uniforms and nomenclature. This developed from an attempt at affirmative action into a &#x27;politically tinged purge&#x27;.

The various Commando units, previously &#x27;Skietverenigings&#x27;, were later classified as Type A, B or C independent Commandos and continued as single-battalion or small independent units. As part of the post-war reorganisation, the Defence Rifle Associations were disbanded in 1948 and replaced by a new Commando organisation with a strength of 90,000 men. At the same time, the Afrikaans-oriented single-battalion regiments founded in 1934 underwent at least one change of name and sometimes more. An early victim was the renowned Middellandse Regiment, which became Regiment Gideon Scheepers in 1954.

It was also decided to establish and maintain two complete army divisions in the UDF: namely 1 SA Infantry Division and 6 SA Armoured Division, consisting of 1, 2, 3, 12, and 13 (CF) Infantry Brigades and the (PF) 11th Armoured Brigade. The divisions were formally established with effect from 1 July 1948, but with the exception of 11 Brigade they were disbanded on 1 November 1949, mainly as a result of difficulties in obtaining volunteer recruits to man the Citizen Force brigades. The 11th Armoured Brigade was itself disbanded on 1 October 1953. In the early 1950s the Union undertook, however, to provide one armoured division for active service in the Middle East in the event of war in the region. To this end some 200 Centurion tanks were ordered, and the first were delivered in July 1952. During Exercise Oranje, conducted in 1956, the Army trialled its Centurions for the first time in a simulated nuclear war situation.

The Defence Act (No. 44) of 1957 renamed the UDF the South African Defence Force (SADF) and established within it some quick-reaction units, or Commandos, to respond to localised threats. The SADF, numbering about 20,000 in 1958, would grow to almost 80,000 in the next two decades.

In 1960 there was another wave of regimental name-changing. Regiment Gideon Scheepers became Regiment Groot Karoo, and three regiments named after famous Boer generals Regiment De La Rey (given its 13 World War 2 battle honours, the most celebrated of the 1934 battalions), Regiment Louw Wepener and Regiment De Wet were inexplicably renamed Regiment Wes-Transvaal, Regiment Oos-Vrystaat and Regiment Noord-Vrystaat. After strenuous efforts, Regiment Wes-Transvaal, Regiment Oos-Vrystaat and Regiment Noord-Vrystaat regained their honoured names.

Following the declaration of the Republic of South Africa in 1961, the &quot;Royal&quot; title was dropped from the names of army regiments like the Natal Carbineers and the Durban Light Infantry, and the Crown removed from regimental badges.

===&quot;Border War&quot; (1966–1989)===

In the early 1960s, the military threat by the South-West Africa People&#x27;s Organisation (SWAPO) and its Communist backers in South West Africa prompted the South African government to increase military service obligations and to extend periods of active duty. The Defence Act (No. 12) of 1961 authorised the minister of defence to deploy Citizen Force troops and Commandos for &quot;riot&quot; control, often to quell anti-apartheid demonstrations, especially when it deteriorated into mob riots with loss of life. The Defence Act (No. 85) of 1967 also expanded military obligations, requiring white male citizens to perform national service, including an initial period of training, a period of active duty, and several years in reserve status, subject to immediate call-up.
From 1966 to 1989 the SADF, with its South West African Territorial Force auxiliary, fought the counter-insurgency South African Border War against SWAPO rebels in South-West Africa (Namibia). These operations included the raising of special units such as the South African 32 Battalion. They also carried out operations in support of UNITA rebels in Angola and against the Cuban troops that supported the Angolan government.

As far as conventional formations were concerned, 7 SA Division and 17, 18 and 19 Brigades were established on 1 April 1965. Difficulties with manning levels saw the disestablishment of 7 SA Division on 1 November 1967 and its replacement by the Army Task Force (HQ) and 16 Brigade.

Also during the 1970s, the SADF began accepting &quot;non-whites&quot; and women into the military as career soldiers, not only as temporary volunteers or reservists; however, the former served mostly, if not exclusively, in segregated units while the latter were not assigned to combat roles. By the end of the 1970s, the South African military was increasingly called upon to confront external threats and internal unrest which started escalating to armed confrontation between the South African state and the liberation forces. Principal among these armed groups was that of the ANC&#x27;s (Spear of the Nation), the AZAPO&#x27;s Azanian People&#x27;s Liberation Army and the PAC&#x27;s Poqo.

In 1973 two new infantry units were established: 7 South African Infantry Battalion (Bourke&#x27;s Luck) and 8 SA Infantry Battalion (Upington), as well as 11 Commando (Kimberley), which to a great extent took over the functions of the Danie Theron Combat School&#x27;s training wing. In 1973 the SADF also took over responsibility for the defence of South West Africa (today Namibia) from the South African Police. During the succeeding months the Army became involved in combat operations for the first time since the Second World War, clashing with groups of SWAPO infiltrating into South West Africa. 

From 1 September 1972 Army Task Force Headquarters was redesignated HQ 7 South African Infantry Division. Two years later, it was decided to organise the Army&#x27;s conventional force into two divisions under a corps headquarters. Both were primarily reserve (Citizen Force) formations, though the division and brigade HQs were Permanent Force. The headquarters of the two divisions were established on 1 August 1974, and 8th Armoured Division was active at its headquarters at Lord&#x27;s Grounds, Durban, until at least 27 September 1992. 1 SA Corps itself was established in August 1974 and was active until 30 January 1977. It appears from Colonel Lionel Crook&#x27;s book on 71 Brigade that four of the six brigades were redesignations of 16, 17, 18, and 19 Brigades. 71 Motorised Brigade was the former 17 Brigade, 72 Brigade was the former 18 Brigade, 73 Brigade was a new formation, 81 Brigade was the former 16 Brigade, 82 Brigade was the former 19 Brigade, and 84 Brigade was new.

In the early 1980s, the Army was restructured in order to counter all forms of insurgency while at the same time maintaining a credible conventional force. To meet these requirements, the Army was subdivided into conventional and counterinsurgency forces. The counterinsurgency forces were further divided into nine territorial commands, each of which was responsible to the Chief of the Army. This force consisted of members of the Permanent Force, Commandos, and a few selected Citizen Force units. The Citizen Force, through the 7 and 8 Divisions, provided the conventional defence force. By July 1987 the number of territorial commands was expanded to ten, and the Walvis Bay military area was often counted as an eleventh. The commands were the Western Province Command (HQ Cape Town, 1959–1998); Eastern Province Command (HQ Port Elizabeth, 1959–1998); Northern Cape Command (HQ Kimberley); Orange Free State Command (HQ Bloemfontein, 1959–1998); Northern Transvaal Command (HQ Pretoria); Witwatersrand Command (HQ Johannesburg, subject of a bombing in 1987); Northwestern Command (HQ Potchefstroom); Eastern Transvaal Command (HQ Nelspruit); Natal Command (Durban), and Far North Command (HQ Pietersburg, which in late 1993 and early 1994 included Regiment Hillcrest which was then part of 73 Motorised Brigade, and 73 Brigade itself). The part-time force also operated in the military area of Walvis Bay.

During this same period, the Engineers and Signals were grouped into the first of the &#x27;type&#x27; formations, the South African Army Engineer Formation (in 1982) and the South African Army Signals Formation (in 1984). Both these formations were made directly responsible to Chief of Army.
In 1984 Northern Transvaal Command was subdivided and Eastern Transvaal Command (Nelspruit) and Far North Command (Pietersburg) formed. The two new Commands were regarded as theatres and as such also had responsibility for conventional operations (and units) within their areas. For example, Far North Command had 73 Motorised Brigade within its area. Southern Cape Command may have been disbanded, and Northern Cape Command established, in 1986. In 1989 the RLI became the conventional reserve for Far North Command. The area of responsibility of each commands followed the boundaries of the Economic Development Regions. Before the dissolution of the territorial commands General Derrick Mgwebi is also reported to have headed Mpumalanga Command.

During the 1980s, the legal requirements for national service were to register for service at age sixteen and to report for duty when called up, which usually occurred at some time after a man&#x27;s eighteenth birthday or on leaving school. National service obligations could be fulfilled by active-duty military service for two years and by serving in the reserves, generally for ten or twelve years. Reservists generally underwent fifty days per year of active duty or training, after their initial period of service. The system was for the most part that the National Service requirement was for 720 days (two years) and subsequent reserve duty was a further 720 days. The reserve duty was broken up depending on the needs of the units and of the individual concerned. This generally worked out as a ninety-day &quot;operational&quot; commitment one year, followed the next year by a thirty-day commitment in addition to any courses, parades or admin evenings that might be required. Members of the Reserve were able to volunteer for further duty in addition to that mandated. This additional, voluntary, service was recognised with the award of the Emblem for Voluntary Service (EVS) (now the Badge for Reserve Voluntary Service (BRVS)) for five years of voluntary service over and above the mandated commitment. The requirements for national service changed several times during the 1980s and the early 1990s in response to national security needs, and they were suspended in 1993.

===Post-1994===

From the early 1990s (after 1992) to 1 April 1997, the SA Army maintained three &#x27;small&#x27; divisions, the 7th (HQ Johannesburg), 8th (HQ Durban) and 9th (HQ Cape Town). They consisted of a reconnaissance battalion, two anti-aircraft defence battalions (AA guns), two battalions of artillery (G-5s and G-6s), a battalion of 127 mm MRLs, an engineer battalion, two battalions of Olifant MBTs, two battalions mounted in Ratel ICVs, and finally two battalions mounted in Buffel APCs. They were all amalgamated into the 7th South African Division on 1 April 1997, and became the 73rd, 74th and 75th Brigades respectively.

On 1 April 1997 Regiment Louw Wepener (Bethlehem), Regiment De Wet (Kroonstad) and Regiment Dan Pienaar (Bloemfontein) were absorbed into Regiment Bloemspruit.

In November 1998 the Army detailed to the Cabinet its plans to reduce army strength from 56,000 to 36,000 by 2002. It was planned to disestablish HQ 7 Division; HQ 44 Parachute Brigade; three other brigade headquarters; and 13 of 21 regular infantry battalions.

7th Division was disbanded on 1 April 1999 and all army battalions were assigned to &#x27;type&#x27; formations, in accordance with the recommendations of the South African Defence Review 1998. The &#x27;type&#x27; formation force structure was implemented in accordance with the recommendations of auditing firm Deloitte and Touche, who were contracted to draw up a plan to make the SA Army more economically efficient. The Deloitte and Touche plan had the army separate its combat forces into &quot;silo&quot; style formations for armour, infantry, artillery, and engineers. Deane-Peter Baker of the South African Institute for Security Studies said that the D&amp;T plan, while alleviating, to an extent, the mistrust of the new South African leadership of the remaining apartheid-era South African Defence Force personnel in middle management positions, reduced the combat effectiveness of the Army, and was seen by 2011 as a mistake. Another mistaken decision was the decision to limit the force design of the SANDF to rely on short logistic lines for highly mechanised mobile forces in defence of national territory, as it causes many supply issues during modern foreign deployments. This is one of the major problems of the army and various solutions are being considered by the government to better equip forces deployed in out-of-area force projection operations.

Though non-white personnel did serve as unarmed labourers with the army in both World Wars, a number of non-whites were employed in segregated units during the Border War, and a number of units were completely desegregated, it was not until 1994 – when South Africa achieved full democracy – that the army as a whole was made open to all races. Today the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) has racial quotas to make sure that White, Black, Coloured, and Indian South Africans are proportionately represented in the armed forces.

During 2006 the Army released its ARMY VISION 2020 guidelines document, in a fresh attempt to reassess the 1998 structures which had proved wanting. The army planned a return to a division based structure, from the previous structure where units are simply provided as needed to the two active brigades. In many respects the plan was an attempt to undo the effects of the Deloitte and Touche-inspired force design that came into effect in 2001. The new plan was to create two divisions and a special operations brigade to conduct mountain, jungle, airborne and amphibious operations. Specialised training would have had to be carried out, as and when funds become available. A works regiment was also to have been created, to help with the maintenance of army and Defence Force buildings and infrastructure. However the plan was not implemented, and appeared to stall until the issue of the 2014 South African Defence Review. With the release of that review in mid-2014 it appears possible that the 2006 planning may be reinvigorated.

Concerns have been raised as to the operational capabilities of the army given the high proportion of the army&#x27;s budget spent on salaries (around 80%) and low amounts budgeted for capital (5%) and operational (15%) capacity. In addition to the large ratio of officers to soldiers, critical skills shortages, high average age of service personnel (48 years), and low proportion that are medically fit enough to be readily deployable (about 10% of personnel).

===Peacekeeping and other operations===

The post-1994 South African Army has been extensively involved in peacekeeping operations under United Nations and African Union command in other African countries such as the United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS), the United Nations Operation in Burundi (ONUB) and the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO), and is doing well with these challenges, despite some pitfalls and budget cuts.

Other operations that the Army was tasked with by government include: Operation Boleas (Lesotho), Operation Fibre (Burundi), Operation Triton (five times in the Comoros), Operation Amphibian (Rwanda), Operation Montego (Liberia), Operation Espresso (Ethiopia), Operation Cordite (Sudan), Operation Teutonic and Operation Bulisa (both in the Democratic Republic of the Congo), Operation Pristine (Ivory Coast), Operation Vimbezela (Central African Republic) and Operation Bongane (Uganda).

The most notable UN deployments since 1994 have been Operation Vimbezela (Central African Republic) and Operation Mistral, the South African contribution to the United Nations mission to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Central African deployment developed rapidly into a combat mission and led to the loss of 15 soldiers from 1 Parachute Battalion in Bangui. The contribution to Ops Mistral, while starting in 2009, became a completely different tasking with the contingent sent in 2013 to the United Nations Force Intervention Brigade, a ~3000-strong intervention brigade that was authorised by the United Nations Security Council on 28 March 2013 through United Nations Security Council Resolution 2098. It is the first United Nations peacekeeping unit that has been specifically tasked to carry out offensive operations against armed rebel groups operating in the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, specifically those that threaten the State authority and civilian security. They can also carry out their mandate without the help of the Congolese Army. The brigade is made up of troops from Tanzania, South Africa and Malawi and has had some successes against rebel groups such as M23. The United Nations Force Intervention Brigade was replaced by the SADC Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2023.

Tanzania and Malawi have committed 2 100 troops to the mission. South Africa has committed 2,900 troops to the mission, of the country&#x27;s 38 572 active army personnel. Based on South African Army standard operating procedures, if 2 900 South African troops are in active combat theatre, 2 900 rehearsing (preparing to replace active duty personnel) and 2 900 in rest and recuperation (R&amp;R), then South Africa has in effect committed 22.5% of its army personnel capacity to the region for a period of 25-years.

All Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries, including South Africa, are working on establishing the SADC Standby Brigade as an element of the African Standby Force. Working towards the creation and strengthening of these regional brigades should contribute to the peace and security of the region. The major challenges that the Army face today is to readdress its current force design, to balance its budget, to integrate new equipment to replace several ageing systems, and to prepare forces for the African Standby Force and African Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises.

==Structure==
Since the Defence Act of 1912, the South African Army has been comprised, in general terms, of three groupings. The first is the standing army, also known since the 1970s as the Permanent Force. A military reserve force was also established by the terms of the 1912 Act and initially designated the Active Citizen Force. The force was established on 1 July 1913. Other designations through the years have included Active Reserve Force, Citizen Force, Conventional Reserve and Territorial Reserve. The Deloitte and Touche plan, as well as various policies over the years have referred to a &#x27;One Force Concept&#x27; where reservists and reserve units are supposed to be treated on an equal footing with the permanent force counterparts. This is often not the case.

Due to the restructuring of the Reserves, the exact number of reserves is difficult to ascertain. However the 2011/12 planning target was 12,400 reserves.

The third grouping was initially the Defence Rifle Associations, which later became the Commandos, a rural self-defence force. There were several thousand other members in the Commandos. Each Commando was responsible for the safeguarding and protection of a specific community (both rural or urban). However, this system was phased out between 2003 and 2008 &quot;because of the role it played in the apartheid era&quot;, according to the Minister of Safety and Security Charles Nqakula. The last commando unit, that at Harrismith in the Free State, was disbanded in March 2008.

South African military ranks are derived from that of the British Armed Forces, with Army ranks derived from the British Army.

The SA Army command structure is as follows:

===Directorates===
*Chief of the SA Army Force Structure - To structure the SA Army in order to provide the SA Army component of the Landward Defence Capability.
*Chief of the SA Army Force Preparation - Responsible for directing, orchestrating and controlling the combat readiness of SA Army Forces
*Chief of the SA Army Corporate Services - Directing corporate resources, services and advice directed towards operationalising the SA Army strategy.
*Inspector General - Provides an internal audit service within the Army strategy.
*Chief of the SA Army Reserves - To give specialist advice to Chief of the SA Army and his staff in all Reserves related issues
*Sergeant Major of the Army - To enhance discipline in the SA Army and enforce standards of discipline.

===Formations and units===

The two standing army brigades are Headquarters 43 South African Brigade and Headquarters 46 South African Brigade. Each of these two headquarters are organised to provide four headquarters groups. Two of these units should be available for deployment at any one time whilst the other two are on leave and in training.

In accordance with the Deloitte and Touche structure plan, the army was reorganised into single-branch &#x27;formations&#x27;:
* South African Armoured Corps
* South African Army Infantry Formation
* South African Army Artillery Formation
* South African Army Air Defence Artillery Formation
* South African Army Engineer Formation
* South African Army Signal Formation
* South African Army Support Formation
* South African Army Training Formation
** Army Combat Training Centre (Lohatla)

Existing and former administrative corps and branches of the South African Army can be seen at South African Army corps and branches.

Many Army units are routinely placed under the nine joint operational-tactical headquarters that the SANDF Chief of Joint Operations supervises directly through Joint Operations Division (IISS 2013). Brigadier-General McGill Alexander took over as General Officer Commanding RJTF South in 2002, but in 2003 he was tasked to close down all the RJTFs.

The South African Army is changing structure into &quot;5 Modern Brigades&quot;. The first of which - The Mechanized brigade has already been established at Lohatlha in the Northern Cape.

Six brigades are taking part in a Division level exercise at Lohatla in 2023. 
- a Mechanized Brigade
- a Motorized Brigade
- an Airborne Brigade 
- a Light Brigade
- a Reserve Brigade
- a Medical Brigade
- Divisional Artillery 
This is merely a restructuring of existing units and the return of the Army to the more traditional brigade structure. More information is being awaited as to the numbering and permanency of these units. The restructuring also has to take place within the very limited existing budget.

== Budget ==
A budget of approximately R15.7 billion was allocated for fiscal year 2023.

The vast majority of army equipment is nearing the end of its service life, with some items (like the Olifant main battle tank) dating from decades ago.

The South African National Defence Force has however started to remedy the situation with the procurement of 244 Badger infantry fighting vehicles under the &quot;Hoefyster&quot; programme. Other procurements are planned and should follow in line with the guideline document – &quot;Army Vision 2020&quot;. The SANDF has launched a project called &quot;African Warrior&quot; which is aimed in modernising the equipment and weapons of the SANDF. The project has been very successful in recent years and the South African Army has now put in service a 21st-century R4 assault rifle.

==Equipment==

The South African Army maintains a wide variety of military equipment.

==Future programmes==
Source

*Project Aorta: A scheme for a new main battle tank. The South African Armoured Corps operated up to a 168 Olifant Mk1B and Mk2 MBT, modified Centurion cruiser tanks. The Centurion tank in its early versions was rushed to the front lines in the closing weeks of the Second World War but failed to arrive in time to see action. Between 90 and 110 MBT were to have formed part of the government&#x27;s ongoing Strategic Defence Package but fell by the wayside for a variety of reasons.
*Project Hoefyster: Partial acquisition of a new generation infantry fighting vehicle. 244 Badger Infantry Combat Vehicles on order at a cost of R8.4 billion. Denel Land Systems awarded contract.
*Project Musuku: Development and partial acquisition of an advanced multi-role light artillery gun capability in the form of the 105 mm &quot;Light Experimental Ordnance&quot;.
*Project Outcome (GBADS III): Planned acquisition of the Umkhonto all weather surface-to-air-missile (AWSAM). No dates as yet.
*Project Protector (GBADS II): Development and partial acquisition of a mobile ground-based air defence system. Possible R3bn budget for land-based Umkhonto IR missile.
*Project Sepula: A new generation armoured personnel carrier for the SA Army to replace the 440+ Mamba and 370+ Casspir that remain in service. The thinking is the Sepula vehicle should have a high level of commonality with the Vistula choice and at least share the drive train to form a &quot;family&quot; of vehicles. Assuming about 90 vehicles a motorised infantry battalion and multiplying that with the number of regular units as well as &quot;some&quot; Reserve Force regiments, about 1000 will be required at a cost of about R3 to R4 million each.
*Project Tladi: &quot;Zone 1&quot; anti-tank. New generation portable infantry A/T rocket launcher to replace RPG7 and FT5.
*Project Vistula: A drive to acquire up to 3000 new tactical 5t and 10t trucks for the SA Army and its sister Services. To replace the SAMIL series.
*Project Warrior: Dismounted soldier system. Acquisition study for low risk items completed 2006. Development plan for complex sub-systems underway.

<text>Haakon, also spelled Håkon (in Norway), [[Hakon]] (in Denmark), [[Håkan]] (in Sweden), or Háukon or Hákon, is an older spelling of the modern Norwegian form of the Old Norwegian masculine first name &quot;Hákon&quot; meaning &quot;High Son&quot; from &quot;há&quot; (high, chosen) and &quot;konr&quot; (son, descendant, kin). An old English form is Hacon as in Haconby, &quot;Hacon&#x27;s Village&quot;. The name appears in Scottish Gaelic as Àcainn, as seen in the place-name Kyleakin, meaning &#x27;Haakon&#x27;s Narrows&#x27;, being named after King Haakon IV of Norway.

<text>Eshowe is the oldest town of European settlement in Zululand, historically also known as Eziqwaqweni, Ekowe or kwaMondi. Eshowe&#x27;s name is said to be inspired by the sound of wind blowing through the more than 4 km2 of the indigenous Dlinza Forest, the most important and striking feature of the town. Although the name is most likely to be derived from the Zulu word for the &quot;Xysmalobium&quot; shrubs, &quot;showe&quot; or &quot;shongwe&quot;.

Today Eshowe is a market town, with a 100 km radius catchment area, two shopping centres, a main bus station serving the hinterland, a major hospital, and several schools.

==History==
In 1860 Cetshwayo, then only a Zulu prince, built a kraal here and named the place Eziqwaqweni &quot;(the abode of robbers)&quot;.
A mission station was established at Eshowe in 1861 once permission had been obtained from the Zulu King Cetshwayo by Norwegian missionary, the Reverend Ommund Oftebro. Later the station was called the KwaMondi Mission Station &quot;(place of Mondi)&quot; after the Zulu name which was given to Oftebro.

== Siege of Eshowe ==

During the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879, Colonel Charles Pearson led the coastal column to Eshowe. This column encountered part of the Zulu army at the Nyezane River, but after a short battle pushed on to the KwaMondi Mission which was fortified and called Fort Ekowe. The forces under Colonel Pearson were besieged for 10 weeks until relieved on April 3 by Lord Chelmsford after the Battle of Gingindlovu.

After the British left, Eshowe was burned down by the Zulus.

== Capital of Zululand ==
After the war Eshowe was established as the capital of Zululand and the home of the British resident in Zululand, Melmoth Osborne. The nearby town of Melmoth is named after him.

In 1887 Eshowe became the capital of Zululand and was officially declared a township in 1891.

In 1947 the British Royal Family (King George VI, Queen Elizabeth, Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret) visited and were welcomed in Eshowe by King Cyprian. The family toured the Dlinza Forest and spent a night in &#x27;The Residency&#x27; in Eshowe.

Eshowe served as the seat of the first Black Diocesan Bishops in South Africa, of the Anglican and Roman Catholic Church. Eshowe is still the seat of the Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Zululand.

<text>Elizabeth Nuttall (née Lynch, formerly McColgan; born 24 May 1964) is a Scottish former middle- and long-distance runner. She won the gold medal in the 10,000 metres at the 1991 World Championships and a silver over the same distance at the 1988 Olympic Games. McColgan earned a silver in the 3000 metres at the 1989 World Indoor Championships. She was a two-time gold medalist in the event at the Commonwealth Games, 1992 World Half Marathon champion and a two-time individual medallist at the World Cross Country Championships. She claimed three victories at the World Marathon Majors: at the 1991 New York City Marathon, 1992 Tokyo Marathon and 1996 London Marathon.

McColgan&#x27;s 10,000 metres best of 30:57.07 set in 1991, moved her to second on the world all-time list at that time and stood as the Scottish record until 2022, when it was broken by her daughter Eilish McColgan. Her marathon best of 2:26:52 set in 1997, stood as the Scottish record until 2019.

==Early life==
Born Elizabeth Lynch, she grew up in the Whitfield area of Dundee and was a pupil of St Saviour&#x27;s RC High School.

She joined her local athletics club, Hawkhill Harriers, aged 12 on the advice of her PE teacher Phil Kearns Coached by Harry Bennett, she soon discovered a talent for distance running and won her first UK titles aged 18. Following Bennett&#x27;s death, McColgan coached herself in preparation for the Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh in 1986. From 1987 to 1989 McColgan was coached by John Anderson, including at the 1988 Olympics, after which she coached herself to the world 10,000m title and to wins in the London, New York and Tokyo marathons. She then met Grete Waitz, who coached her from 1992 to her retirement in 1996.

==Athletics career==
At the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, as Liz Lynch, she took the gold medal in the 10,000 metres, finishing nearly 12 seconds ahead of the nearest competitor and giving the host country its only gold medal in athletics. Earlier that year, she had won the NCAA Division I Indoor Track and Field Championships in the mile representing the University of Alabama. In 1987, she won a silver medal at the World Cross Country Championships in Warsaw representing Scotland (Great Britain would not send a unified team to the World Cross until 1988). She finished behind Annette Sergent of France but ahead of Ingrid Kristiansen. In September, she improved the UK 10,000m record to 31:19.82 while finishing fifth at the World Championships in Rome, in a race won by Kristiansen.

In 1988, now competing as Liz McColgan, she improved her own UK record with 31:06.99 in July to defeat Kristiansen in Oslo. Almost three months later, she ran 31:08.44 to win an Olympic silver medal in the inaugural women&#x27;s 10,000 metres at the Seoul Olympics. She was defeated by the Soviet Union&#x27;s Olga Bondarenko. McColgan won silver in the 3,000 metres at the World Indoor Championships in 1989. In January 1990, she became the only Scot to successfully defend a Commonwealth title at the 1990 games in Auckland, New Zealand, when she again took the gold in the 10,000 metres, as well as bronze in the 3,000 metres. She missed the rest of the 1990 season due to pregnancy, giving birth to her daughter (future Olympic athlete) Eilish in November. Nike dropped her the moment she told them she was pregnant.

Just six weeks after her daughter Eilish was born, she contested an international 5 km race in Florida and won a bronze medal at the 1991 World Cross Country Championships. In June 1991, she ran her lifetime best for the 10,000 m with 30:57.07 in Hengelo, becoming only the third woman to run under 31 minutes, moving to second on the world all-time list behind Kristiansen and narrowly ahead of Bondarenko. This stood as the Scottish record until it was broken by Eilish in 2022. In August 1991, she won gold in the 10,000 metres at the World Championships in Tokyo, Japan. In November of that year at the New York City Marathon, her first marathon, she won with a time of 2:27.23, breaking the record for a debut marathon by three minutes.

In March 1992, McColgan struggled to a 41st-place finish at the World Cross Country Championships in Boston. Then, in the summer, she finished fifth in the 10,000m final at the Barcelona Olympics. In September, she won the inaugural World Half Marathon Championships, where she also helped the British team claim the silver medal in the team competition. Two months later, she won the Tokyo International Women&#x27;s Marathon.

After more than two years struggling with injuries, McColgan finished fifth in the 1995 London Marathon and sixth in the 10,000m final at the 1995 World Championships in Gothenburg. In 1996, she won the London Marathon in a time of 2 hours, 27 minutes and 54 seconds, before finishing 16th in the marathon at the Atlanta Olympics. She finished second in the London Marathons of 1997 and 1998, running her career-best time of 2:26:52 in 1997. She gave her medal to a youngster in the crowd after the 1997 event.

McColgan retired from competing in August 2001 when she fractured a bone in her foot while training for selection for the 2002 Commonwealth Games. However, she returned in 2004 to win the Scottish Indoor Championships 3000 metres (in 9:31). In 2007, she ran the London Marathon, finishing 25th in 2:50:38. She also completed the 2010 New York Marathon in 3:10:54. In 2017, she completed the inaugural Stirling Scottish Marathon in 3:18:32.

==Personal life==
In 1987 she married Northern Irish athlete Peter McColgan; they had five children together - Eilish, Martin, Eamonn, Kieran and Orla. The couple separated in November 2010 and finalised their divorce in March 2013. On 18 January 2014, McColgan married John Nuttall (1967–2023), a coach who worked as head of endurance coaching for British Athletics and later coached in Qatar, becoming step-mother to Nuttall&#x27;s son, para-athlete Luke Nuttall and daughter, British international athlete Hannah Nuttall.

McColgan&#x27;s eldest daughter, Eilish, is also a distance runner. Eilish broke her mother&#x27;s Scottish 10,000 metre record in 2022, and emulated her mother by winning the 10,000 metres at the 2022 Commonwealth Games.

==Awards==
In December 1991, McColgan appeared on &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; and was voted BBC Sports Personality of the Year. She was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire for services to athletics in 1992 and inducted to the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame in 2004.

<doc id="500004" wikidata="Q728415" url="?curid=500004" title="On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences">
<text>The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) is an online database of integer sequences. It was created and maintained by Neil Sloane while researching at AT&amp;T Labs. He transferred the intellectual property and hosting of the OEIS to the OEIS Foundation in 2009, and is its chairman. 

OEIS records information on integer sequences of interest to both professional and amateur mathematicians, and is widely cited. , it contains over 370,000 sequences, and is growing by approximately 30 entries per day.

Each entry contains the leading terms of the sequence, keywords, mathematical motivations, literature links, and more, including the option to generate a graph or play a musical representation of the sequence. The database is searchable by keyword, by subsequence, or by any of 16 fields. There is also an advanced search function called SuperSeeker which runs a large number of different algorithms to identify sequences related to the input.

==History==

Neil Sloane started collecting integer sequences as a graduate student in 1964 to support his work in combinatorics. The database was at first stored on punched cards. He published selections from the database in book form twice:
#A Handbook of Integer Sequences (1973, ), containing 2,372 sequences in lexicographic order and assigned numbers from 1 to 2372.
#The Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences with Simon Plouffe (1995, ), containing 5,488 sequences and assigned M-numbers from M0000 to M5487. The Encyclopedia includes the references to the corresponding sequences (which may differ in their few initial terms) in &quot;A Handbook of Integer Sequences&quot; as N-numbers from N0001 to N2372 (instead of 1 to 2372.) The Encyclopedia includes the A-numbers that are used in the OEIS, whereas the Handbook did not.

These books were well-received and, especially after the second publication, mathematicians supplied Sloane with a steady flow of new sequences. The collection became unmanageable in book form, and when the database reached 16,000 entries Sloane decided to go online – first as an email service (August 1994), and soon thereafter as a website (1996). As a spin-off from the database work, Sloane founded the &quot;Journal of Integer Sequences&quot; in 1998.
The database continues to grow at a rate of some 10,000 entries a year.
Sloane has personally managed &#x27;his&#x27; sequences for almost 40 years, but starting in 2002, a board of associate editors and volunteers has helped maintain the omnibus database.
In 2004, Sloane celebrated the addition of the 100,000th sequence to the database, , which counts the marks on the Ishango bone. In 2006, the user interface was overhauled and more advanced search capabilities were added. In 2010 an OEIS wiki was created to simplify the collaboration of the OEIS editors and contributors. The 200,000th sequence, , was added to the database in November 2011; it was initially entered as A200715, and moved to A200000 after a week of discussion on the SeqFan mailing list, following a proposal by OEIS Editor-in-Chief Charles Greathouse to choose a special sequence for A200000. A300000 was defined in February 2018, and by end of January 2023 the database contained more than 360,000 sequences.

== Non-integers ==
Besides integer sequences, the OEIS also catalogs sequences of fractions, the digits of transcendental numbers, complex numbers and so on by transforming them into integer sequences.
Sequences of fractions are represented by two sequences (named with the keyword &#x27;frac&#x27;): the sequence of numerators and the sequence of denominators. For example, the fifth-order Farey sequence, formula_1, is catalogued as the numerator sequence 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 4 () and the denominator sequence 5, 4, 3, 5, 2, 5, 3, 4, 5 ().
Important irrational numbers such as π = 3.1415926535897... are catalogued under representative integer sequences such as decimal expansions (here 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5, 8, 9, 7, 9, 3, 2, 3, 8, 4, 6, 2, 6, 4, 3, 3, 8, 3, 2, 7, 9, 5, 0, 2, 8, 8, ... ()), binary expansions (here 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, ... ()), or continued fraction expansions (here 3, 7, 15, 1, 292, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 14, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 84, 2, 1, 1, ... ()).

The OEIS was limited to plain ASCII text until 2011, and it still uses a linear form of conventional mathematical notation (such as &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) for functions, &quot;n&quot; for running variables, etc.). Greek letters are usually represented by their full names, &quot;e.g.&quot;, mu for μ, phi for φ.
Every sequence is identified by the letter A followed by six digits, almost always referred to with leading zeros, &quot;e.g.&quot;, A000315 rather than A315.
Individual terms of sequences are separated by commas. Digit groups are not separated by commas, periods, or spaces.
In comments, formulas, etc., codice_1 represents the &quot;n&quot;th term of the sequence.

=== Special meaning of zero ===

Zero is often used to represent non-existent sequence elements. For example, enumerates the &quot;smallest prime of &quot;n&quot;2 consecutive primes to form an &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; magic square of least magic constant, or 0 if no such magic square exists.&quot; The value of &quot;a&quot;(1) (a 1 × 1 magic square) is 2; &quot;a&quot;(3) is 1480028129. But there is no such 2 × 2 magic square, so &quot;a&quot;(2) is 0. This special usage has a solid mathematical basis in certain counting functions; for example, the totient valence function &quot;N&quot;φ(&quot;m&quot;) () counts the solutions of φ(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;m&quot;. There are 4 solutions for 4, but no solutions for 14, hence &quot;a&quot;(14) of A014197 is 0—there are no solutions.

Other values are also used, most commonly −1 (see or ).

=== Lexicographical ordering ===
The OEIS maintains the lexicographical order of the sequences, so each sequence has a predecessor and a successor (its &quot;context&quot;). OEIS normalizes the sequences for lexicographical ordering, (usually) ignoring all initial zeros and ones, and also the sign of each element. Sequences of weight distribution codes often omit periodically recurring zeros.

For example, consider: the prime numbers, the palindromic primes, the Fibonacci sequence, the lazy caterer&#x27;s sequence, and the coefficients in the series expansion of formula_2. In OEIS lexicographic order, they are:
* Sequence #1: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, ... 
* Sequence #2: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 101, 131, 151, 181, 191, 313, 353, 373, 383, 727, 757, 787, 797, 919, 929, ... 
* Sequence #3: 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, ... 
* Sequence #4: 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29, 37, 46, 56, 67, 79, 92, 106, 121, 137, 154, ... 
* Sequence #5: 3, 8, 3, 24, 24, 48, 3, 8, 72, 120, 24, 168, 144, ... 
whereas unnormalized lexicographic ordering would order these sequences thus: #3, #5, #4, #1, #2.

==Self-referential sequences==

Very early in the history of the OEIS, sequences defined in terms of the numbering of sequences in the OEIS itself were proposed. &quot;I resisted adding these sequences for a long time, partly out of a desire to maintain the dignity of the database, and partly because A22 was only known to 11 terms!&quot;, Sloane reminisced.
One of the earliest self-referential sequences Sloane accepted into the OEIS was (later ) &quot;&quot;a&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;n&quot;-th term of sequence A&quot;n&quot; or –1 if A&quot;n&quot; has fewer than &quot;n&quot; terms&quot;. This sequence spurred progress on finding more terms of .
 lists the first term given in sequence A&quot;n&quot;, but it needs to be updated from time to time because of changing opinions on offsets. Listing instead term &quot;a&quot;(1) of sequence A&quot;n&quot; might seem a good alternative if it were not for the fact that some sequences have offsets of 2 and greater.
This line of thought leads to the question &quot;Does sequence A&quot;n&quot; contain the number &quot;n&quot;?&quot; and the sequences , &quot;Numbers &quot;n&quot; such that OEIS sequence A&quot;n&quot; contains &quot;n&quot;, and , &quot;n&quot; is in this sequence if and only if &quot;n&quot; is not in sequence A&quot;n&quot;&quot;. Thus, the composite number 2808 is in A053873 because is the sequence of composite numbers, while the non-prime 40 is in A053169 because it is not in , the prime numbers. Each &quot;n&quot; is a member of exactly one of these two sequences, and in principle it can be determined &quot;which&quot; sequence each &quot;n&quot; belongs to, with two exceptions (related to the two sequences themselves):
*It cannot be determined whether 53873 is a member of A053873 or not. If it is in the sequence then by definition it should be; if it is not in the sequence then (again, by definition) it should not be. Nevertheless, either decision would be consistent, and would also resolve the question of whether 53873 is in A053169.
*It can be proved that 53169 both is and is not a member of A053169. If it is in the sequence then by definition it should not be; if it is not in the sequence then (again, by definition) it should be. This is a form of Russell&#x27;s paradox. Hence it is also not possible to answer if 53169 is in A053873.

===Entry fields===
; ID number
: Every sequence in the OEIS has a serial number, a six-digit positive integer, prefixed by A (and zero-padded on the left prior to November 2004). The letter &quot;A&quot; stands for &quot;absolute&quot;. Numbers are either assigned by the editor(s) or by an A number dispenser, which is handy for when contributors wish to send in multiple related sequences at once and be able to create cross-references. An A number from the dispenser expires a month from issue if not used. But as the following table of arbitrarily selected sequences shows, the rough correspondence holds.
: Even for sequences in the book predecessors to the OEIS, the ID numbers are not the same. The 1973 &quot;Handbook of Integer Sequences&quot; contained about 2400 sequences, which were numbered by lexicographic order (the letter N plus four digits, zero-padded where necessary), and the 1995 &quot;Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences&quot; contained 5487 sequences, also numbered by lexicographic order (the letter M plus 4 digits, zero-padded where necessary). These old M and N numbers, as applicable, are contained in the ID number field in parentheses after the modern A number.
; Sequence data
: The sequence field lists the numbers themselves, to about 260 characters. More terms of the sequences can be provided in so-called B-files. The sequence field makes no distinction between sequences that are finite but still too long to display and sequences that are infinite; instead, the keywords &quot;fini&quot;, &quot;full&quot;, and &quot;more&quot; are used to distinguish such sequences. To determine to which &quot;n&quot; the values given correspond, see the offset field, which gives the &quot;n&quot; for the first term given.
; Name
: The name field usually contains the most common name for the sequence, and sometimes also the formula. For example, 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, () is named &quot;The cubes: a(n) = n^3.&quot;.
; Comments
: The comments field is for information about the sequence that does not quite fit in any of the other fields. The comments field often points out interesting relationships between different sequences and less obvious applications for a sequence. For example, Lekraj Beedassy in a comment to A000578 notes that the cube numbers also count the &quot;total number of triangles resulting from criss-crossing cevians within a triangle so that two of its sides are each &quot;n&quot;-partitioned&quot;, and Neil Sloane points out an unexpected relationship between centered hexagonal numbers () and second Bessel polynomials () in a comment to A003215.
; References
: References to printed documents (books, papers, ...).
; Links
: Links, i.e. URLs, to online resources. These may be:
:# references to applicable articles in journals
:# links to the index
:# links to text files which hold the sequence terms (in a two column format) over a wider range of indices than held by the main database lines

; Formula
: Formulas, recurrences, generating functions, etc. for the sequence.
; Example
: Some examples of sequence member values.
; Maple
: Maple code.
; Mathematica
: Wolfram Language code.
; Program
: Originally Maple and Mathematica were the preferred programs for calculating sequences in the OEIS, each with their own field labels. , Mathematica was the most popular choice with 100,000 Mathematica programs followed by 50,000 PARI/GP programs, 35,000 Maple programs, and 45,000 in other languages.
: As for any other part of the record, if there is no name given, the contribution (here: program) was written by the original submitter of the sequence.
; Crossrefs
: Sequence cross-references originated by the original submitter are usually denoted by &quot;Cf.&quot;
: Except for new sequences, the &quot;see also&quot; field also includes information on the lexicographic order of the sequence (its &quot;context&quot;) and provides links to sequences with close A numbers (A046967, A046968, A046969, A046971, A046972, A046973, in our example). The following table shows the context of our example sequence, A046970:
; Keyword
: The OEIS has its own lexicon: a standard set of mostly four-letter keywords which characterizes each sequence:
:*allocated - An A-number which has been set aside for a user but for which the entry has not yet been approved (and perhaps not yet written).
:*base - The results of the calculation depend on a specific positional base. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 101, 131, 151, 181 ... are prime numbers regardless of base, but they are palindromic specifically in base 10. Most of them are not palindromic in binary. Some sequences rate this keyword depending on how they are defined. For example, the Mersenne primes 3, 7, 31, 127, 8191, 131071, ... does not rate &quot;base&quot; if defined as &quot;primes of the form 2^n − 1&quot;. However, defined as &quot;repunit primes in binary,&quot; the sequence would rate the keyword &quot;base&quot;.
:* bref - &quot;sequence is too short to do any analysis with&quot;, for example, , the number of isomorphism classes of associative non-commutative non-anti-associative anti-commutative closed binary operations on a set of order &quot;n&quot;.
:* changed The sequence is changed in the last two weeks.
:* cofr - The sequence represents a continued fraction, for example the continued fraction expansion of &quot;e&quot; () or π ().
:* cons - The sequence is a decimal expansion of a mathematical constant, such as &quot;e&quot; () or π ().
:* core - A sequence that is of foundational importance to a branch of mathematics, such as the prime numbers (), the Fibonacci sequence (), etc.
:* dead - This keyword used for erroneous sequences that have appeared in papers or books, or for duplicates of existing sequences. For example, is the same as .
:* dumb - One of the more subjective keywords, for &quot;unimportant sequences,&quot; which may or may not directly relate to mathematics, such as popular culture references, arbitrary sequences from Internet puzzles, and sequences related to numeric keypad entries. , &quot;Mix digits of pi and e&quot; is one example of lack of importance, and , &quot;Price is Right wheel&quot; (the sequence of numbers on the Showcase Showdown wheel used in the U.S. game show &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;) is an example of a non-mathematics-related sequence, kept mainly for trivia purposes.
:* easy - The terms of the sequence can be easily calculated. Perhaps the sequence most deserving of this keyword is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ... , where each term is 1 more than the previous term. The keyword &quot;easy&quot; is sometimes given to sequences &quot;primes of the form &quot;f&quot;(&quot;m&quot;)&quot; where &quot;f&quot;(&quot;m&quot;) is an easily calculated function. (Though even if &quot;f&quot;(&quot;m&quot;) is easy to calculate for large &quot;m&quot;, it might be very difficult to determine if &quot;f&quot;(&quot;m&quot;) is prime).
:* eigen - A sequence of eigenvalues.
:* fini - The sequence is finite, although it might still contain more terms than can be displayed. For example, the sequence field of shows only about a quarter of all the terms, but a comment notes that the last term is 3888.
:* frac - A sequence of either numerators or denominators of a sequence of fractions representing rational numbers. Any sequence with this keyword ought to be cross-referenced to its matching sequence of numerators or denominators, though this may be dispensed with for sequences of Egyptian fractions, such as , where the sequence of numerators would be . This keyword should not be used for sequences of continued fractions; cofr should be used instead for that purpose.
:* full - The sequence field displays the complete sequence. If a sequence has the keyword &quot;full&quot;, it should also have the keyword &quot;fini&quot;. One example of a finite sequence given in full is that of the supersingular primes , of which there are precisely fifteen.
:* hard - The terms of the sequence cannot be easily calculated, even with raw number crunching power. This keyword is most often used for sequences corresponding to unsolved problems, such as &quot;How many &quot;n&quot;-spheres can touch another &quot;n&quot;-sphere of the same size?&quot; lists the first ten known solutions.
:* hear - A sequence with a graph audio deemed to be &quot;particularly interesting and/or beautiful&quot;, some examples are collected at the OEIS site.
:* less - A &quot;less interesting sequence&quot;.
:* look - A sequence with a graph visual deemed to be &quot;particularly interesting and/or beautiful&quot;. Two examples out of several thousands are A331124 A347347.
:* more - More terms of the sequence are wanted. Readers can submit an extension.
:* mult - The sequence corresponds to a multiplicative function. Term &quot;a&quot;(1) should be 1, and term &quot;a&quot;(&quot;mn&quot;) can be calculated by multiplying &quot;a&quot;(&quot;m&quot;) by &quot;a&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) if &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot; are coprime. For example, in , &quot;a&quot;(12) = &quot;a&quot;(3)&quot;a&quot;(4) = −8 × −3.
:* new - For sequences that were added in the last couple of weeks, or had a major extension recently. This keyword is not given a checkbox in the Web form for submitting new sequences; Sloane&#x27;s program adds it by default where applicable.
:* nice - Perhaps the most subjective keyword of all, for &quot;exceptionally nice sequences.&quot;
:* nonn - The sequence consists of nonnegative integers (it may include zeroes). No distinction is made between sequences that consist of nonnegative numbers only because of the chosen offset (e.g., &quot;n&quot;3, the cubes, which are all nonnegative from &quot;n&quot; = 0 forwards) and those that by definition are completely nonnegative (e.g., &quot;n&quot;2, the squares).
:* obsc - The sequence is considered obscure and needs a better definition.
:* recycled - When the editors agree that a new proposed sequence is not worth adding to the OEIS, an editor blanks the entry leaving only the keyword line with keyword:recycled. The A-number then becomes available for allocation for another new sequence.
:* sign - Some (or all) of the values of the sequence are negative. The entry includes both a Signed field with the signs and a Sequence field consisting of all the values passed through the absolute value function.
:* tabf - &quot;An irregular (or funny-shaped) array of numbers made into a sequence by reading it row by row.&quot; For example, , &quot;Triangle read by rows giving successive states of cellular automaton generated by &quot;rule 62.&quot;
:* tabl - A sequence obtained by reading a geometric arrangement of numbers, such as a triangle or square, row by row. The quintessential example is Pascal&#x27;s triangle read by rows, .
:* uned - The sequence has not been edited but it could be worth including in the OEIS. The sequence may contain computational or typographical errors. Contributors are encouraged to edit these sequences.
:* unkn - &quot;Little is known&quot; about the sequence, not even the formula that produces it. For example, , which was presented to the Internet Oracle to ponder.
:* walk - &quot;Counts walks (or self-avoiding paths).&quot;
:* word - Depends on the words of a specific language. For example, zero, one, two, three, four, five, etc. For example, 4, 3, 3, 5, 4, 4, 3, 5, 5, 4, 3, 6, 6, 8, 8, 7, 7, 9, 8, 8 ... , &quot;Number of letters in the English name of &quot;n&quot;, excluding spaces and hyphens.&quot;
: Some keywords are mutually exclusive, namely: core and dumb, easy and hard, full and more, less and nice, and nonn and sign.
; Offset
: The offset is the index of the first term given. For some sequences, the offset is obvious. For example, if we list the sequence of square numbers as 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 ..., the offset is 0; while if we list it as 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 ..., the offset is 1. The default offset is 0, and most sequences in the OEIS have offset of either 0 or 1. Sequence , the magic constant for &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; magic square with prime entries (regarding 1 as a prime) with smallest row sums, is an example of a sequence with offset 3, and , &quot;Number of stars of visual magnitude &quot;n&quot;.&quot; is an example of a sequence with offset −1. Sometimes there can be disagreement over what the initial terms of the sequence are, and correspondingly what the offset should be. In the case of the lazy caterer&#x27;s sequence, the maximum number of pieces you can cut a pancake into with &quot;n&quot; cuts, the OEIS gives the sequence as 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29, 37, ... , with offset 0, while Mathworld gives the sequence as 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29, 37, ... (implied offset 1). It can be argued that making no cuts to the pancake is technically a number of cuts, namely &quot;n&quot; = 0, but it can also be argued that an uncut pancake is irrelevant to the problem. Although the offset is a required field, some contributors do not bother to check if the default offset of 0 is appropriate to the sequence they are sending in. The internal format actually shows two numbers for the offset. The first is the number described above, while the second represents the index of the first entry (counting from 1) that has an absolute value greater than 1. This second value is used to speed up the process of searching for a sequence. Thus , which starts 1, 1, 1, 2 with the first entry representing &quot;a&quot;(1) has 1, 4 as the internal value of the offset field.
; Author(s)
: The author(s) of the sequence is (are) the person(s) who submitted the sequence, even if the sequence has been known since ancient times. The name of the submitter(s) is given first name (spelled out in full), middle initial(s) (if applicable) and last name; this in contrast to the way names are written in the reference fields. The e-mail address of the submitter is also given before 2011, with the @ character replaced by &quot;(AT)&quot; with some exceptions such as for associate editors or if an e-mail address does not exist. Now it has been the policy for OEIS not to display e-mail addresses in sequences. For most sequences after A055000, the author field also includes the date the submitter sent in the sequence.
; Extension
: Names of people who extended (added more terms to) the sequence or corrected terms of a sequence, followed by date of extension.

==Sloane&#x27;s gap==
In 2009, the OEIS database was used by Philippe Guglielmetti to measure the &quot;importance&quot; of each integer number. The result shown in the plot on the right shows a clear &quot;gap&quot; between two distinct point clouds, the &quot;uninteresting numbers&quot; (blue dots) and the &quot;interesting&quot; numbers that occur comparatively more often in sequences from the OEIS. It contains essentially prime numbers (red), numbers of the form &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; (green) and highly composite numbers (yellow). This phenomenon was studied by Nicolas Gauvrit, Jean-Paul Delahaye and Hector Zenil who explained the speed of the two clouds in terms of algorithmic complexity and the gap by social factors based on an artificial preference for sequences of primes, even numbers, geometric and Fibonacci-type sequences and so on. Sloane&#x27;s gap was featured on a Numberphile video in 2013.

<doc id="500006" wikidata="Q1247422" url="?curid=500006" title="Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke">
<text>Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke ( 1270 – 23 June 1324) was an Anglo-French nobleman. Though primarily active in England, he also had strong connections with the French royal house. One of the wealthiest and most powerful men of his age, he was a central player in the conflicts between Edward II of England and his nobility, particularly Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster. Pembroke was one of the Lords Ordainers appointed to restrict the power of Edward II and his favourite Piers Gaveston. His position changed with the great insult he suffered when Gaveston, as a prisoner in his custody whom he had sworn to protect, was removed and beheaded at the instigation of Lancaster. This led Pembroke into close and lifelong cooperation with the king. Later in life, however, political circumstances combined with financial difficulties would cause him problems, driving him away from the centre of power.

Though earlier historians saw Pembroke as the head of a &quot;middle party&quot;, between the extremes of Lancaster and the king, the modern consensus is that he remained essentially loyal to Edward throughout most of his career. Pembroke was married twice, and left no legitimate issue, though he did have a bastard son. He is today remembered primarily through his wife Marie de St Pol&#x27;s foundation of Pembroke College, Cambridge, and for his splendid tomb that can still be seen in Westminster Abbey. He was also an important figure in the Wars of Scottish Independence.

==Family and early years==
Aymer was the son of William de Valence, son of Hugh X, Count of La Marche and Isabella of Angoulême. William was Henry III&#x27;s half-brother through his mother&#x27;s prior marriage to King John, and as such gained a central position in the Kingdom of England. He had come to the earldom of Pembroke through his marriage to Joan de Munchensi, granddaughter of William Marshal. Aymer was the third son of his family, so little is known of his birth and early years. He is believed to have been born some time between 1270 and 1275. As his father was on crusade with Lord Edward until January 1273, a date towards the end of this period is more likely. The later date is problematic, however, because his mother by then was in her mid-forties. With the death in battle in Wales of his remaining brother William in 1282 (John, the elder brother, was dead in 1277), Aymer found himself heir to the Earldom of Pembroke. He married Béatrice, daughter of Raoul II of Clermont, sometime before October 1295. 

William de Valence died in 1296, and Aymer inherited his father&#x27;s French lands, but had to wait until his mother died in 1307 to succeed to the earldom. In 1320, his first wife Béatrice de Clermont died. In 1321, Aymer married his second wife Marie de St Pol. Through inheritance and marriages his lands consisted of—apart from the county palatine in Pembrokeshire—property spread out across England primarily in a strip from Gloucestershire to East Anglia, in south-east Ireland (Wexford), and French lands in the Poitou and Calais areas.

In 1297 he accompanied Edward I of England on a campaign to Flanders, and seems to have been knighted by this time. With his French connections he was in the following years a valuable diplomat in France for the English king. In 1302 he was amongst the team of plenipotentiaries appointed by Edward I to negotiate the Treaty of Paris that returned Gascony to Edward.

He also served as a military commander in Scotland, fighting against Robert the Bruce. In 1306 at the Battle of Methven he won the day over Bruce in a sneak attack, only to be soundly defeated by Bruce at Loudoun Hill the next year.

==Ordinances and Piers Gaveston==
Edward I died in 1307 and was succeeded by his son Edward II. The new king at first enjoyed the goodwill of his nobility, Valence among them. Conflict soon ensued, however, connected especially with the enormous unpopularity of Edward&#x27;s favourite Piers Gaveston. Gaveston&#x27;s arrogance towards the peers, and his control over Edward, united the Baronage in opposition to the king. In 1311 the initiative known as the Ordinances was introduced, severely limiting Royal powers in financial matters and in the appointment of officers. Equally important, Gaveston was expelled from the realm, as Edward I had already done once before. Pembroke, who was not among the most radical of the Ordainers, and had earlier been sympathetic with the king, had now realised the necessity of exiling Gaveston.

When Gaveston without permission returned from exile later the same year, a Baronial council entrusted Pembroke and the Earl of Surrey, with the task of taking him into custody. This they did on 19 May 1312, but not long after Thomas of Lancaster, acting with the earls of Warwick, Hereford and Arundel, seized Gaveston and executed him on 19 June. This act had the effect of garnering support for the king and marginalising the rebellious earls. As far as Pembroke was concerned, the seizing and execution of a prisoner in his custody was a breach of the most fundamental chivalric codes, and a serious affront to his honour. The event must therefore be seen as pivotal in turning his sympathies away from the rebels and towards the king.

==Later years==
In the following years, Pembroke worked closely with the king. He was appointed the king&#x27;s lieutenant in Scotland in 1314, and was present at the disastrous English defeat at the Battle of Bannockburn, where he helped lead Edward away from the field of battle. In 1317, however, while returning from a papal embassy to Avignon, he was captured by a Jean de Lamouilly, and held for ransom in Germany. The huge ransom of £10,400 was to cause Pembroke significant financial difficulties for the remainder of his life.

Although ostracised because of the murder of Gaveston, Thomas of Lancaster had regained virtual control of royal government in the period after England&#x27;s defeat at Bannockburn. Proving himself as incapable to rule as Edward, however, he soon grew unpopular. Pembroke was one of the magnates who in the years 1316–1318 tried to prevent civil war from breaking out between the supporters of Edward and those of Lancaster, and he helped negotiate the Treaty of Leake in Nottinghamshire in 1318, restoring Edward to power. Peace did not last long, however, as the king by now had taken on Hugh Despenser the Younger as another favourite, in much the same position as Gaveston. Pembroke&#x27;s attempts at reconciliation eventually failed, and civil war broke out in 1321. In 1322 Lancaster was defeated at the Battle of Boroughbridge in what is now North Yorkshire, and executed. Pembroke was among the earls behind the conviction. Also in 1322, Pembroke founded the Chantry College of Milton near Gravesend.

After Boroughbridge Pembroke found himself in a difficult situation. The opponents of Hugh Despenser and his father had lost all faith in him, but at the same time, he found himself marginalised at court where the Despensers&#x27; power grew more and more complete. On top of this came his financial problems. On 23 June 1324, while on an embassy to France, he suddenly collapsed and died while lodging somewhere in Picardy.

==Legacy==

T. F. Tout in 1914, one of the first historians to make a thorough academic study of the period, considered Pembroke the one favourable exception in an age of small-minded and incompetent leaders. Tout wrote of a &quot;middle party&quot;, led by Pembroke, representing a moderate position between the extremes of Edward and Lancaster. This &quot;middle party&quot; supposedly took control of the royal government through the Treaty of Leake in 1318. In his authoritative study of 1972, J. R. S. Phillips rejects this view. In spite of misgivings with the king&#x27;s favourites, Pembroke was consistently loyal to Edward. What was accomplished in 1318 was not the takeover by a &quot;middle party&quot;, but simply a restoration of royal power.

Aymer and his sister Agnes rented one of the old manor houses of Dagenham in Essex, which has been called Valence House ever since; it is now a museum.

Aymer married twice; his first marriage, before 1295, was to Beatrice, daughter of Raoul de Clermont, Lord of Nesle in Picardy and Constable of France. Beatrice died in 1320, and in 1321 he married Marie de St Pol, daughter of Guy de Châtillon, Count of St Pol and Butler of France. He never had any legitimate children, but he had an illegitimate son, Henry de Valence, whose mother is unknown. Pembroke&#x27;s most lasting legacy is probably through his second wife, who in 1347 founded Pembroke College, Cambridge. The family arms are still represented on the dexter side of the college arms. Aymer de Valence was buried in Westminster Abbey, where his tomb effigy can still be seen as a splendid example of late gothic architecture, elaborating on the design of the nearby tomb of Edmund Crouchback, Earl of Lancaster.

Aymer was portrayed by Sam Spruell in the 2018 movie &quot;Outlaw King&quot; about Robert the Bruce.

<doc id="500011" wikidata="Q1411307" url="?curid=500011" title="Ceropegia">
<text>Ceropegia is a genus of plants within the family Apocynaceae, native to Africa, southern Asia, and Australia. It was named by Carl Linnaeus, who first described this genus in his &quot;Genera plantarum&quot;, which appeared in 1737. Linnaeus referred to the description and picture of a plant in the &quot;Horti Malabarici&quot; as the plant for which the genus was created. In 1753 he named this species as &quot;Ceropegia candelabrum&quot;. Linnaeus did not explain the etymology but later explanations stated that the name &quot;Ceropegia&quot; was from the Greek word &quot;keropegion&quot; κηροπηγɩον. This means &quot;candelabrum&quot; in Latin, which has a broader range than the modern word - &quot;a candlestick, a branched candlestick, a chandelier, candelabrum, or also lamp-stand, light-stand, sometimes of exquisite workmanship&quot;.

An alternative explanation for the name was given later by William Jackson Hooker in 1830 in &quot;Curtis&#x27;s Botanical Magazine&quot; in the description of &quot;Ceropegia elegans&quot;: &quot;From &quot;&quot;, wax, and &quot;&quot;, a fountain, in allusion to the delicate, waxy umbels of some species&quot;. However, four years later Hooker gave the etymology in the description in the same periodical of &quot;Ceropegia lushii&quot; as &quot;remarkable for the peculiar shape of its flowers, frequently arranged in umbels, hence its name κηροπηγɩον, a candelabrum, or lamp-stand&quot;.

They have many common names including lantern flower, parasol flower, parachute flower, bushman&#x27;s pipe, string of hearts, snake creeper, wine-glass vine, rosary vine, and necklace vine.

&quot;Ceropegia&quot; species are traded, kept, and propagated as ornamental plants. In Africa, the roots and leaves of some species are eaten raw and the tubers in India are eaten raw or stewed in curries.

==Appearance==
The stems are vining or trailing in most species, though a few species from the Canary Islands have erect growth habits. Among some species, such as &quot;Ceropegia woodii&quot;, the nodes swell, and the roots similarly expand to form tubers beneath the soil surface. The leaves are simple and opposite, although they can be rudimentary or absent. Especially in certain succulent species, the leaves may also be thick and fleshy.

The flowers have a tubular corolla with five petals most often fused at the tips, forming an umbrella-like canopy, a cage, or appendage-like antennae. Pollination is accomplished by flies, and species can be generalists by attracting multiple families, or extremely specialized. &quot;Ceropegia dolichophylla&quot; releases scents that attract kleptoparasitic flies by mimicking the pheromones released by predatory arthropods in distress. The flowers are often inflated and fused at several points, forming a cage. Flies become momentarily trapped inside, accomplishing pollination as they move about.

==Classification==
The genus &quot;Ceropegia&quot; belongs to the subfamily Asclepiadoideae (milkweeds) within the family Apocynaceae. Species of this genus bear similarities to the carrion flowers or stapelias. There are at least 420 known species. More are being discovered and described regularly. They are distributed throughout most of sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar to the Arabian Peninsula, southeast Asia, the Canary Islands, the tropical Pacific, and Australia.

A generic complex, with many interesting taxonomic problems at both generic and specific level, is formed by three genera: &quot;Ceropegia&quot;, &quot;Brachystelma&quot; and &quot;Riocreuxia&quot;.

==Selected species==

Over 450 species are accepted. Selected species include:

<doc id="500016" wikidata="Q4831488" url="?curid=500016" title="Aymer de Valence (bishop)">
<text>Aymer de Valence ( 1222 – 4 December 1260) was a Bishop of Winchester around 1250.

==Life==
Valence was a half-brother of King Henry III of England; his mother was Isabella of Angoulême, the second wife of King John, his father was Hugh X of Lusignan, the count of La Marche, whom Isabelle married in 1220. He was also the uncle of Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke.

The children of Isabella&#x27;s marriage came to England in 1247 in the hope of obtaining court preferment. Aymer received a prebend in the diocese of London. In 1250 the King, by putting strong pressure upon the electors, succeeded in obtaining the election of Aymer to the see of Winchester on 4 November. The appointment was in every way unsuitable. Aymer was illiterate, ignorant of the English language, and wholly secular in his mode of life. Upon his head was concentrated the whole of the popular indignation against the foreign favourites; and he seems to have deserved this unenviable distinction. However, he received confirmation of his election to the see from Pope Innocent IV on 14 January 1251, along with a dispensation to keep his other ecclesiastical income. 

He played a role in touching off the baronial reform movement of 1258. On 1 April 1258 Aymer sent a posse to attack men of the magnate John fitz Geoffrey at Shere in Surrey, killing one of them. At a parliament opened at Westminster a week later John fitz Geoffrey demanded justice from the king; Henry excused Aymer, his half-brother, and refused justice thus angering the barons. At the Parliament of Oxford in 1258 he and his brothers repudiated the Provisions of Oxford prepared by the barons. He was pursued to Winchester, besieged in Wolvesey Castle, and finally compelled to surrender and leave the kingdom. He had never been consecrated; accordingly in 1259 the chapter of Winchester proceeded to a new election. Aymer, however, gained the support of Pope Alexander IV, and in January 1259, Alexander IV sent Velascus (a Friar Minor) to England to compel the King and the barons to reinstate Aymer to his bishopric at Winchester. He was on his way back to England when he was overtaken by a fatal illness at Paris, having only been consecrated on 16 May 1260 before his death on 4 December 1260. He is buried in Paris.

<text>James Thomas Milton Anderson (July 23, 1878 – December 29, 1946) was the fifth premier of Saskatchewan and the first Conservative to hold the office.

==Early career==
Anderson was chosen as leader of the Conservatives in 1924 and was one of the party&#x27;s three Members of the Legislative Assembly elected in the 1925 election.

==Premiership==
In the 1929 election, the Conservatives were able to exploit patronage scandals surrounding the Liberal government of Saskatchewan Premier James Garfield Gardiner to achieve a major breakthrough by winning 24 seats. The Liberals won 28 seats, with 5 going to the Progressive Party and the remaining 4 to independents. The Liberals tried to form a minority government but were defeated in a motion of no confidence, which allowed Anderson to form a co-operative government, a coalition between the Conservatives, Progressives and Independents.

Anderson was accused of working closely with the Ku Klux Klan, which was a major force in the province in the late 1920s and the early 1930s with an estimated 25,000 members. Pat Emmons, a senior Klan defector, alleged that Anderson and Klan officials regularly met, and the Liberals accused the Conservatives of being a front for the Klan. With few Blacks in the province, and First Nations largely confined to Indian reserves under the informal pass system, the focus of the Klan was against immigration, Catholics, and francophones; as well as opposition to the Gardiner Liberals, who were seen as supporting all three of those groups.

Anderson denied the allegations, but upon gaining power, he took the portfolio of Minister of Education while he was premier and proposed amendments to the Schools Act to ban the instruction of French in public schools and to outlaw the display of religious symbols in all schools, including the Catholic separate school system. The Klan supported those changes and worked hard to elect and defend the Conservative-dominated government.

==Loss of office==
The Anderson government also had to face the onset of the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl, which destroyed the province&#x27;s agrarian economy. Anderson also had to deal with labour unrest culminating in the Estevan Riot of 1931. The government formed the Saskatchewan Relief Commission to try to help those affected by the drought and massive unemployment. Those efforts were insufficient, and in the 1934 elections, the Conservatives lost every seat in the legislature and remained a minor party for 40 years.

== Electoral history ==
=== Saskatchewan general elections, 1925 to 1934 ===

Anderson led the Conservative Party in three general elections, in 1925, 1929 and 1934. They came in third in seats in 1925, formed a minority government in 1929, and were completely eliminated from the Assembly in the 1934 election.

==== 1925 General election ====


In his first general election, Anderson and the Conservatives came in third, although he managed to win a seat in the Legislative Assembly.

1 Premier when election was called; Premier after the election.&lt;br&gt;
2 Co-Leaders of the Opposition after the election.

==== 1929 General election ====


Anderson led the Conservatives to a much improved result in the 1929 election, being only eight seats short of a majority in a hung parliament. Premier Gardiner and the Liberals had four more seats than the Conservatives. Gardiner chose to face the Assembly in hopes of obtaining sufficient support from some of the opposition members to maintain his government. Anderson organized a vote on a confidence motion which defeated the government. Gardiner resigned and Anderson became Premier.

1 Premier when election was called; lost confidence motion in the Assembly after the election; resigned as Premier and became Leader of the Opposition.&lt;br&gt;
2 Co-Leader of the Opposition when the election was called; became Premier after successful vote of non-confidence in the Gardiner government.

==== 1934 General election ====


Anderson was Premier for almost five years and led the Conservatives into the 1934 election, at the depths of the Great Depression and Dirty Thirties. The Conservatives were routed, losing every seat, although they came in second in the popular vote. The Liberals under Gardiner won a massive majority, with all but five seats in the Legislative Assembly. The Farmer-Labour Party formed the Opposition.

1 Leader of the Opposition when election was called; Premier after the election.&lt;br&gt;
2 Party leader during the election, but failed to win seat; role as Leader of the Opposition taken by George Hara Williams.&lt;br&gt;
3 Premier when election was called; lost seat in the election and resigned as Premier.

=== Saskatchewan constituency elections ===

Anderson stood for election five times, all in the riding of Saskatoon City, which returned two members. After becoming Premier after the 1929 general election, he was required by the electoral law at that time to be re-elected in a by-election, which he won by acclamation. He won two contested elections and lost two.

<doc id="500022" wikidata="Q463191" url="?curid=500022" title="Sandis Ozoliņš">
<text>[[Sandis]] Ozoliņš (born 3 August 1972), commonly spelled Sandis Ozolinsh in North America, is a Latvian former professional ice hockey player and coach. During his career in North America, Ozoliņš was a seven-time NHL All-Star, Stanley Cup champion (as a member of the 1995–96 Colorado Avalanche), and Norris Trophy finalist. He is also the all-time leader for goals, assists, points, and games played by a Latvian in the NHL and holds several Colorado Avalanche and San Jose Sharks franchise records. Ozoliņš was also the highest-paid sportsman in Latvian history, before NBA basketball player Andris Biedriņš succeeded him in 2008. He became the head coach of Dinamo in 2017.

Ozoliņš was drafted in the 1991 NHL Entry Draft by the San Jose Sharks as the 8th pick of the 2nd round, 30th overall. He played for the Sharks, Colorado Avalanche, Carolina Hurricanes, Florida Panthers, Mighty Ducks of Anaheim and New York Rangers. He is often considered a prototype &quot;offensive defenseman,&quot; becoming heavily involved in his team&#x27;s offense and scoring opportunities.

In 2014 Ozoliņš was awarded Order of the Three Stars for his long-standing contributions to Latvian ice hockey and sports.

==Playing career==
===Early playing career===
Ozoliņš was drafted 30th overall by the San Jose Sharks in the 1991 NHL Entry Draft and had played for the Kansas City Blades, a minor league team in the International Hockey League. He and Latvian teammate Artūrs Irbe won a Turner Cup with the Blades in 1992.

===National Hockey League===
====San Jose Sharks====
Ozoliņš joined the Sharks in 1992–93, scoring 23 points in 37 games. He missed the majority of his rookie season recovering from a knee injury suffered in a game against Philadelphia on December 30, 1992. After recovering from his injury, Ozoliņš ended the 1993–94 season with an 81-game, 26-goal/64-point sophomore effort, leading the league in goals by a defenceman. Ozoliņš helped the Sharks to move beyond the first round of the playoffs for the first time in franchise history, losing in the conference semifinals.

====Colorado Avalanche====
Ozoliņš began the 1995–96 season with one goal and three assists in seven games for the Sharks before being acquired by the Colorado Avalanche for Owen Nolan on October 26, 1995. In 66 games during his first season, Ozoliņš scored 50 total points, with more than half on the power play. Ozoliņš won the Stanley Cup with the Avalanche in 1996. The following season Colorado won the Presidents&#x27; Trophy. After losing to the Detroit Red Wings in the 1997 conference finals, Ozoliņš finished third in votes for the Norris Trophy, awarded to the league&#x27;s most outstanding defenceman. In the regular season, he scored a career-high 68 points, second in the league for defencemen after Brian Leetch. Ozoliņš scored his first career hat trick on December 6, 1999, against the Vancouver Canucks. 1999 was his final year in Denver, in which Ozoliņš made $4 million as Colorado&#x27;s third-highest paid player.

====Carolina, Florida and Anaheim====
During the 2000 NHL Entry Draft, Ozoliņš was traded to the Carolina Hurricanes for Nolan Pratt and draft picks that became Václav Nedorost, Jared Aulin, and Agris Saviels. The agreement reunited Ozoliņš with fellow Latvian Artūrs Irbe. They had played together in Latvia and San Jose, shared an agent, and together funded a youth hockey organization that buys equipment for children in Latvia. After expiration of Ozoliņš&#x27; Avalanche deal, he signed a five-year contract with Carolina worth more than $25 million. &quot;When you have a player like Sandis, you&#x27;re willing to spend the money,&quot; general manager Jim Rutherford said. Ozoliņš didn&#x27;t help the Hurricanes to advance in the playoffs, playing just one and a half seasons with Carolina before being traded to the Florida Panthers.

Ozoliņš became a Panther after being acquired in 2001–02 mid-season from Carolina along with Byron Ritchie in exchange for Bret Hedican, Kevyn Adams, Tomáš Malec and a draft pick. Ozoliņš made his Panthers debut against Chicago on January 16, 2002. He wore #44 because #8 was already worn by Peter Worrell. Ozoliņš scored 10 goals and 19 assists in the remaining 37 games of the season. The Panthers did not make the playoffs during his time in Florida.

During the 2002–03 season, the Panthers sent Ozoliņš to the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim for Matt Cullen, Pavel Trnka, and a draft pick. During the 2003 NHL All-Star weekend (several days after he had been traded), Ozoliņš skipped the NHL All-Star skills competition where he would have had to wear a Panthers uniform. &quot;Participating in the All-Star Game is one thing, but the skills competition is another,&quot; said Ozoliņš, who was voted as an Eastern Conference starter. &quot;It would look really unusual for a player to be representing his old team, so I thought this was the right thing to do.&quot; He was fined an undisclosed amount by the league. Upon his arrival with the Ducks, Ozoliņš helped the club reach their first Stanley Cup Finals, losing a seven-game series to the New Jersey Devils. In 2003–04, Ozoliņš battled injuries and was limited to 36 games.

====NY Rangers and return to San Jose====
Following the lockout in 2004–05, Ozoliņš was dealt to the New York Rangers at the trading deadline for a third-round draft pick (which the Rangers had obtained earlier in a trade with the San Jose Sharks). With 14 points in 19 games in the 2005–06 season, Ozoliņš helped his team to advance to the playoffs, for which the Rangers had not qualified since 1997. In the next season on December 18, 2006, on the heels of a 6–1 loss to New Jersey, the Rangers placed Ozoliņš on waivers. After clearing waivers, Ozoliņš was assigned to the Hartford Wolf Pack of the American Hockey League (AHL), but a short while later was put on the injured reserve list due to a knee injury.

Ozoliņš later entered into the league&#x27;s substance abuse program following a drunk driving arrest. After playing 2 games for the Worcester Sharks of the AHL and being cleared to play by doctors within the league&#x27;s substance abuse program, he signed a one-year contract with San Jose on November 2, 2007. &quot;That was a big turnaround this summer and I&#x27;m finally comfortable with what I am and what has happened, I actually feel pretty good and I do what I have to do and I do what I was advised to do. And I do it for myself and not for anybody else,&quot; said Ozoliņš. In the 2007–08 NHL season he scored 3 goals and 13 assists in 39 games for the Sharks. He had a notable highlight reel save against the Anaheim Ducks, whereas the puck slipped by goalie Evgeni Nabokov, and Ozoliņš slipped and fell as he made a stick save on the goal line.

===Kontinental Hockey League===
====Dinamo Riga====
After his season with the Sharks, Ozoliņš was offered a one-year contract by the Los Angeles Kings worth $800,000, but he declined it and went on hiatus from hockey for a year.

On July 13, 2009, Ozoliņš unexpectedly signed a one-year deal with KHL home country team Dinamo Riga, with whom he started his senior career in 1990. Ozoliņš got back his #8 – the same number which he wore while playing for Dinamo Riga. Ozoliņš was named a captain for the first time in his career. In the 2009–10 KHL season he was the team&#x27;s leader in points among defensemen, scoring 5 goals and 20 assists in 43 games. In January 2010, Ozoliņš was selected to play on the starting roster for the Jaromír Jágr team in the KHL All-Star game. He was also selected to play in the KHL All-Star skills competition, but, due to a minor injury, only played in the first period and withdrew from the skills competition. On May 18, 2010, Ozoliņš extended his contract with Dinamo for another year, after he declined larger offers from four different KHL teams.

In the first month of the 2010–11 KHL season Ozoliņš was honoured as the league&#x27;s best defenseman after he registered 1 goal and 11 assists in 11 games, at the time being the league&#x27;s leader in assists. He was injured in the November 28 game against HC Sibir and missed all of the December due to broken ribs. In January 2011, Ozoliņš was again selected to play on the starting roster in the KHL All-Star game. Before the start of a 2011–12 KHL season Ozoliņš received an offer from KHL Gagarin Cup 2011 winners Salavat Yulaev Ufa to join the team, but he declined it. During the 2011–12 KHL season, league officials confirmed Ozoliņš as captain of the Western Conference team in the All-Star Game 2012 (which took place on January 21, 2012) versus the Eastern Conference team captained by Sergei Fedorov. On July 12, 2012, Dinamo Riga board member Guntis Ulmanis told Latvian radio station Baltkom that Ozoliņš left KHL team Dinamo Riga as a free agent and could receive lucrative offers from Russian clubs. Since joining Riga, Ozoliņš had 22 goals and 65 assists in 158 regular season KHL appearances, serving as the team captain for every game. During his time with Dinamo Riga, Ozoliņš set several franchise records as a defenseman.

====Atlant Moscow Oblast====
On September 24, 2012, Ozoliņš signed a one-year deal with the KHL team Atlant Moscow Oblast. In his only season with Atlant in 2012–13, Ozoliņš was named team captain and immediately served as a fixture on the blueline, producing 2 goals and 20 points in 42 games.

====Return home====
In the off-season, Ozoliņš made another return as a free agent to Dinamo Riga, signing a one-year contract on May 8, 2013.

==Retirement==
On May 27, 2014, during an interview on national television, he announced his retirement from professional hockey and plans to move into politics. However, he returned to Dinamo Riga as an assistant coach on October 31, 2016. He was promoted to head coach of the team on May 29, 2017. On November 8, 2022, it was announced that Sandis Ozoliņš had been hired as an amateur scout for the Colorado Avalanche organization of whom he won his only Stanley Cup with as a player back in 1996.

==International play==


Ozoliņš, who was born in Latvia, played hockey internationally for the Soviet Union until 1991. His first major international tournament was 1991 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, where he won a silver medal, losing in the gold medal game to Canada. Following the breakup of the Soviet Union, he played under the new flag of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and won a gold medal at the 1992 World Junior Championships. During the tournament, the USSR was formally dissolved and the team was renamed as the Commonwealth of Independent States national junior team. Because Ozoliņš and Sergei Zholtok were from Latvia, which wasn&#x27;t a member of the CIS, some other teams protested, but the protest was denied.

Ozoliņš didn&#x27;t play again internationally until 1998 due to injuries and the NHL playoff schedule. In 1998, after losing with the Avalanche to the Edmonton Oilers in the first round of the playoffs, Ozoliņš was able to rush to Switzerland and made his debut for Latvia in the elite division, where team Latvia had qualified for the second time since its independence in 1991. At that tournament, he registered 1 goal and 2 assists. He again helped his nation at the Men&#x27;s World Ice Hockey Championship; he was able to participate because of the Hurricanes loss in the Conference quarterfinals. Latvia finished the tournament in 13th place. He played in next year&#x27;s championship as well as one game during the 2002 Winter Olympics Ice hockey tournament. In the game versus Slovakia, Ozoliņš registered 4 assists, helping Latvia to a 6–6 tie.

After a three-year absence, Ozoliņš helped Latvia qualify for the 2006 Winter Olympics Ice hockey tournament. It was intended to be his last international tournament; he announced his international retirement to the media following the conclusion of the Olympics. Despite his announced retirement he rejoined team Latvia in their bid to qualify for the 2014 Olympics. The Latvian team, including Ozoliņš, did indeed qualify for the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi (and was named captain), where they upset the Swiss to earn a berth in the quarterfinals, then lost to Canada to finish 8th.

==Personal life==
Ozoliņš was married to his secondary school schoolmate Sandra for more than 15 years, until May 2010 Ozoliņš applied for divorce. He has two sons – Roberts (born in 1994) and Christopher (born in 1996). During the off-season Ozoliņš resides in Denver, Colorado, and most recently in Jūrmala, Latvia. Ozoliņš was the owner of Vilki OP/LaRocca of the Riga Open Championship until it became defunct in 2006. Ozoliņš also owns other Latvian sports ventures, including Latvia&#x27;s first 18-hole golf course, Ozo Golf Club. In December 2009, Ozoliņš was voted as 2009&#x27;s most popular sportsman in Latvia by internet voters.

<text>The Restionaceae, also called restiads and restios, are a family of flowering plants native to the Southern Hemisphere; they vary from a few centimeters to 3 meters in height. Following the APG IV (2016): the family now includes the former families Anarthriaceae, Centrolepidaceae and Lyginiaceae, and as such includes 51 genera with 572 known species. Based on evidence from fossil pollen, the Restionaceae likely originated more than 65 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous period, when the southern continents were still part of Gondwana.

==Description==
The family consists of tufted or rhizomatous, herbaceous plants belonging to a group of monocotyledons that includes several similar families, such as the sedges, rushes, and grasses. They have green, photosynthetic stems and leaves that have been reduced to sheaths. Their flowers are extremely small and in spikelets, which in turn make up the inflorescences. Male and female flowers are on separate plants and, like grasses, are wind-pollinated.

==Distribution==
Plants in the family are distributed on all the southern continents - South America (two spp., &quot;Apodasmia chilensis&quot; and &quot;Gaimardia australis&quot;), Africa south of the Equator and including Madagascar (about 330 spp.) and Australia (about 150 spp.) - in New Zealand (four spp.) and widely distributed in Southeast Asia (one sp.). They are often dominant elements of the flora in the Mediterranean climates of South Africa and Western Australia. They are the defining family in the Western Cape fynbos plant community. The South American species is very similar to one of the New Zealand species, leading to the conjecture that it might have crossed the Pacific in the last 30 million years. The distribution of restios in Africa is irregular, with the same single species occurring in Madagascar, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, and Malawi, while a different species is found in the Chimanimani Mountains of eastern Zimbabwe. Four species are found in the Natal Drakensberg, one of which spills over into Mpumalanga and Limpopo provinces. The vast majority of species, though, are to be found in the Cape Floristic Region and particularly plentiful on hard sandstone formations. The center of diversity lies in the Kogelberg, where more than a third of all Restionaceae may be found. Restionaceae are grown in Kirstenbosch, Cape Town&#x27;s National Botanical Gardens.

A number of the largest African species have become popular as garden ornamentals in many parts of the world, some being useful as accent plants similar to small species of bamboo, but with pendant stems of greater delicacy. Also, many smaller species offer a great variety of decorative features and deserve horticultural attention.

==Taxonomy==
The family Restionaceae has been recognized by most taxonomists. The APG II system of 2003 (unchanged from the APG system, 1998), recognizes this family and assigns it to the order Poales, in the clade commelinids of the monocots. The Cronquist system of 1981 also recognized this family and placed it in the order Restionales, in the subclass Commelinidae in class Liliopsida in division Magnoliophyta.

===Genera===
, Kew&#x27;s Plants of the World Online lists the following 48 genera in the family Restionaceae:

<text>The Hughes Medal is a silver-gilt medal awarded by the Royal Society of London &quot;in recognition of an original discovery in the physical sciences, particularly electricity and magnetism or their applications&quot;. Named after David E. Hughes, the medal is awarded with a gift of £1000. The medal was first awarded in 1902 to J. J. Thomson &quot;for his numerous contributions to electric science, especially in reference to the phenomena of electric discharge in gases&quot;, and has since been awarded over one hundred times. Unlike other Royal Society medals, the Hughes Medal has never been awarded to the same individual more than once.

The medal has on occasion been awarded to multiple people at a time; in 1938 it was won by John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton &quot;for their discovery that nuclei could be disintegrated by artificially produced bombarding particles&quot;, in 1981 by Peter Higgs and Tom Kibble &quot;for their international contributions about the spontaneous breaking of fundamental symmetries in elementary-particle theory&quot;, in 1982 by Drummond Matthews and Frederick Vine &quot;for their elucidation of the magnetic properties of the ocean floors which subsequently led to the plate tectonic hypothesis&quot; and in 1988 by Archibald Howie and M. J. Whelan &quot;for their contributions to the theory of electron diffraction and microscopy, and its application to the study of lattice defects in crystals&quot;.
