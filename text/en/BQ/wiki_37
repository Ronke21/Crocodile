<text>Chappelle&#x27;s Show is an American sketch comedy television series created by comedians Dave Chappelle and Neal Brennan, with Chappelle hosting the show and starring in the majority of its sketches. Chappelle, Brennan, and Michele Armour were the show&#x27;s executive producers. The series premiered on January 22, 2003, on the American cable television network Comedy Central. The show ran for two complete seasons. An abbreviated third season of three episodes aired in 2006, compiled of previously unreleased sketches. 

After numerous delays, production of the third season of &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot; was abruptly ended when Chappelle left the series. Critically acclaimed throughout its run, the series often satirized and examined—through dark and racial humor—race, social stereotypes, masculinity, celebrity culture, and comedy itself. &quot;TV Guide&quot; included it on their list of &quot;TV&#x27;s Top 100 Shows&quot; and it was placed 26th on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s &quot;New TV Classics&quot; ranking.

== Format ==
The show opened with Chappelle being introduced over the instrumental from the song &quot;Hip-Hop&quot;, from the album &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Free&quot; by Dead Prez. Chappelle would perform a short stand up in front of a live audience. The focus would then shift to a prerecorded sketch. The show was notorious for its handling of the topic of sexuality and Chappelle&#x27;s casual usage of racial epithets. Chappelle performed sketches that premiered intricate cultural topics, such as prostitution, the entertainment industry, gun violence, numerous drug references (particularly marijuana, alcohol, PCP, crystal meth and crack cocaine) and music. The show often closed with a musical performance by a hip hop or soul artist.

== Cast ==
=== Frequent or notable guest stars ===
Many guest stars appeared on the show, including &quot;Half Baked&quot; co-stars Guillermo Díaz, Jim Breuer and Snoop Dogg (who was also a musical guest); RZA, GZA and Method Man of the Wu-Tang Clan, Rick James, Damon Dash, Redman, Ice-T, Arsenio Hall, Wayne Brady (the only guest to appear on stage), Mos Def (who was also a musical guest), Eddie Griffin, Susan Sarandon, Q-Tip, Rashida Jones, Jamie Foxx, Carson Daly, Ron Jeremy, Bill Burr, Patrice O’Neal, Rich Vos, Spike Lee, Michael Rapaport and Joe Rogan.

Musical guests included De La Soul, Ludacris, Robert Petkoff, Talib Kweli, Fat Joe, Wyclef Jean, Killer Mike, Big Boi of OutKast, Anthony Hamilton, Kanye West, Common, DMX, Busta Rhymes, Slum Village, John Mayer, Questlove, Cee-Lo Green, Vida Guerra, Erykah Badu and Lil Jon.

==Notable sketches==
Rather than acting out sketches in front of a live studio audience, the sketches were prerecorded with the audience reaction usually used in lieu of a laugh track. According to Neal Brennan in the season-two DVD commentary, the production team never edited in prerecorded laughs, with the exception of the &quot;Dude&#x27;s Night Out&quot; sketch due to the lack of reaction from the audience.
* A Moment in the Life of Lil Jon – Chappelle plays rapper/producer Lil Jon doing normal, everyday tasks, with a vocabulary consisting of almost nothing but the words &#x27;Yeah!&#x27;, &#x27;HWHAT?!&#x27;, and &#x27;O-kay!&#x27; The real Lil Jon appeared in one sketch opposite Chappelle&#x27;s character, with Lil Jon speaking in an excessively dignified accent. The rapper credited the sketch with increasing his visibility. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; put it on its end-of-the-decade, &quot;best-of&quot; list, saying, &quot; We could have filled this list with 100 reasons we miss &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot;, but the biggest one would have to be his riotous celebrity impressions.&quot;
* Charlie Murphy&#x27;s True Hollywood Stories – Charlie Murphy (who also wrote the sketches) retells his encounters with 1980s celebrities, the most popular being the Rick James story. The sketch features Murphy as himself and Chappelle as James, including incidents such as James slapping Murphy and referring to him as &quot;Darkness&quot;, interspersed with cuts from an interview with the actual present-day Rick James, trying to cover up for his past behavior, saying, &quot;Cocaine&#x27;s a hell of a drug.&quot; The sketch spawned one of the show&#x27;s popular catchphrases, &quot;I&#x27;m Rick James, bitch!&quot;, which Chappelle, as James, repeatedly declares. The sketch attained even greater public attention when, in 2005, a candidate for city council in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, also named Rick James but unrelated to the singer, had many of his &quot;Vote Rick James&quot; campaign signs defaced by writing &quot;Vote Rick James bitch!&quot; or stolen by fans of the sketch. The other &quot;True Hollywood Story&quot; depicted Murphy and his crew losing a pickup game of basketball against Prince. Both James and Prince confirmed the stories were true, with James&#x27;s admission coming in unreleased interview footage produced for the skit. Prince&#x27;s confirmation came in an interview with MTV, in which he stated &quot;The whupping is true&quot;. Prince later used an image of Chappelle dressed as Prince as the cover of his single &quot;Breakfast Can Wait&quot;.
* Frontline – A spoof of the PBS series of the same name, it was hosted by Kent Wallace (played by William Bogert). The first &quot;Frontline&quot; sketch, &quot;Blind Supremacy&quot;, featured the life of Clayton Bigsby (played by Chappelle), a blind white supremacist who is not aware that he is actually a black man. Grantland.com writer Rembert Browne deemed this sketch the winner of his &quot;Best Chappelle Sketch Ever&quot;, beating out the Wayne Brady sketch in his 64-sketch, NCAA Tournament style bracket. This sketch was part of the first episode and garnered attention for its extensive use of the word &quot;nigger&quot; (mostly spoken by Chappelle&#x27;s character). The sketch has been compared to the iconic &quot;word association&quot; &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch from 1975 featuring Chevy Chase and Richard Pryor which received similar reactions for its use of the word. Charlie Sheen stated that he was hospitalized in 2010 as a result of developing a hernia from laughing so hard upon viewing the sketch. Other &quot;Frontline&quot; sketches featured stories of racist animal actors and gay versions of everything from the DMV to the KKK.
* Racial Draft – A parody of modern-day pro-sports drafts. Various multiracial or multiethnic celebrities such as Tiger Woods (Chappelle), Lenny Kravitz, the Wu-Tang Clan (playing themselves), O. J. Simpson, Eminem and Madonna were &quot;drafted&quot; into a (potentially) entirely different race, based on their perceived ethnicity or some other cultural appropriations in their act or lifestyle. Elián González was recertified as Hispanic, after being culturally appropriated by white America. Lenny Kravitz was declared 100% Jewish, the Wu-Tang Clan 100% Asian, and Tiger Woods 100% black. Chappelle also played the white announcer/representative, while rapper Mos Def played the black representative; radio personality Angie Martinez played the Hispanic representative.
* WacArnold&#x27;s – Chappelle gets a job as a young man at a fast-food restaurant that portrays itself as providing a community service by offering jobs to disenfranchised, poor youth. A scene-by-scene mock of a 1990 McDonald&#x27;s commercial is followed by Chappelle slowly realizing the job is embarrassing and he does not make enough money to support his family. He gets robbed and harassed on his way to work. During one encounter in the last scene of the sketch, a thug (played by Donnell Rawlings) quips, &quot;Hey Calvin! It&#x27;s a fine line between fries and shakes!&quot; before he breaks into song, &quot;The leanest burger in the world, could be the meanest burger in the world, if you cook it that way!&quot; He follows by stating he has to &quot;stop smoking this shit here&quot; as his friends break out in laughter. The song is a remake of a 1971 song by The Persuaders (also covered by The Pretenders in 1983 and H-Town in 1996) &quot;Thin Line Between Love and Hate&quot;.
* Wayne Brady&#x27;s Show – After Dave Chappelle quits the show in an opening segment that coincidentally mirrored the contract negotiations for the aborted third season, Wayne Brady (portraying himself) takes over as host and is asked to emcee the remaining episodes of the series since Chappelle had already filmed the remaining sketches. Regretting the decision to leave the show, Chappelle returns and confronts Brady. The ensuing confrontation leads to the airing of a flashback to a night of misadventures involving the two that portrays Brady (contrary to his friendly public image) as a murderous, pimping, and seriously disturbed sociopath in the mold of Denzel Washington&#x27;s character Alonzo Harris from the film &quot;Training Day&quot;. Brady had trouble filming the sketch, finding it difficult to say the line &quot;Is Wayne Brady gonna have to choke a bitch?&quot;.
* When Keeping It Real Goes Wrong – A documentary style sketch, it serves as a cautionary tale about when not to &quot;keep it real&quot; (be completely honest). The sketch depicts events in which a character is just minding his business until someone else says or does something that the first character does not like. The character is given a choice: ignore the alleged provocation, or &quot;keep it real&quot; (get confrontational and be antagonistic with whoever provoked him), with the character going with the latter, all the while boasting about how they &quot;keep it real&quot;. Eventually, the character&#x27;s decision backfires severely on him, thus ruining his life, while the person who provoked him is having the time of his life, and the character&#x27;s friends shun the character&#x27;s choice to &quot;keep it real&quot;.
* Player Hater&#x27;s Ball – Guest starring Ice-T, the sketch featured Chappelle and several other regulars attending a convention of &quot;haters&quot;, i.e. people who make hurtful and deprecating comments towards others. The characters all dressed and acted in the manner of flamboyant 1970s pimps. The convention featured an award for &quot;hater of the year&quot; and an ad-libbed segment where the attendees were shown pictures of celebrities such as Rosie O&#x27;Donnell and Kelly Osbourne and delivered put downs. This later spawned a sequel called &quot;Haters in Time&quot; where the haters went back in time to when the Africans were slaves and end up killing one of the slave masters.
* Samuel L. Jackson Beer – Filmed as a long-form ad, the sketch featured a parody of Samuel Adams Beer sponsored by actor Samuel L. Jackson. Chappelle appeared as Jackson, wearing a wig reminiscent of the actor&#x27;s hair style in the 1994 movie &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and dressed in Revolutionary War-era garb similar to the spokesman who had recently appeared in Samuel Adams Beer ads. Chappelle&#x27;s performance played heavily on Jackson&#x27;s propensity for roles which involve angry shouting and copious profanity. At one point when asked to stop yelling by Bill Burr, Chappelle, as Jackson, yells &quot;No, I can&#x27;t stop yelling, &#x27;cause that&#x27;s how I talk! You ain&#x27;t never seen my movies?&quot;

==Recurring characters==
* Tron Carter (played by Chappelle) – a cocaine dealer, he is originally shown in a sketch where he has received reparations for slavery and due to a &quot;hot hand in a dice game&quot; becomes the richest man in America. When asked about the infant he carts around in a stroller, Tron says, &quot;I just bought this baby, cash.&quot; He is also one of the roommates in &quot;The Mad Real World&quot;. Later in a spoof of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, Tron gets the same lenient treatment as those involved in white-collar crime, invoking the &quot;fif&quot; in response to every question. Tron also appeared in the first episode of season three in a sketch in which he described an altercation with Method Man and was tortured by the methods described in the song &quot;Method Man&quot; from &quot;Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)&quot;. In the reparations episode, he is shown gambling in Brooklyn and described as a Harlem resident, but in another episode, he is shown in his house on &quot;Everglade Boulevard&quot; bagging up cocaine and watching the fictitious R. Kelly music video &quot;Piss on You&quot;, and he receives a phone call from the Dade County Police Department, suggesting he lives in Miami.
* Negrodamus – Paul Mooney plays a black prophet and fortune teller (a satire of Nostradamus). In the sketch, people (mostly white) ask him various questions such as &quot;Negrodamus, why do white people love Wayne Brady so much?&quot; to which he replies &quot;White people love Wayne Brady because he makes Bryant Gumbel look like Malcolm X.&quot; (This clip was later shown as a drug hallucination in the Wayne Brady sketch.)
* Tyrone Biggums – Chappelle plays a squeaky-voiced crack addict recognized by his white, blistered lips and constant scratching. His first appearance was in the second episode of season one. He is often heard saying, &quot;I smoke rocks&quot; and &quot;SHAZAM!&quot; Tyrone enjoys eating peanut butter and crack sandwiches, and was the spokesman for &quot;Red Balls&quot;, an energy drink made from cocaine. He also made an appearance in a &quot;Fear Factor&quot; spoof sketch on the &quot;Wayne Brady&#x27;s Show&quot; episode, wherein he was exceptionally willing to do gross challenges, and was nonreactive to the hot coals underneath his feet, which lit his big toenail on fire (the same fire from which he would later light a cigarette). Biggums was featured in &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Wars&quot; segment where he was a cellmate of River Terrace Crew leader General Cornrow Wallace (Mos Def).
* &quot;Silky&quot; Johnson (played by Chappelle) – A notorious player hater, he won the fictitious &quot;Hater of the Year&quot; award twice (one of which was for calling a bomb threat on the Special Olympics), and who later traveled back in time to &quot;hate&quot; in the past.
* Chuck Taylor (played by Chappelle) – The lead &quot;white&quot; anchor on the fictitious &quot;News 3&quot;, he is played by Chappelle in whiteface makeup and a blonde wig. Taylor has appeared in a few sketches, the first of which was the &quot;Reparations&quot; sketch from season one.
* Leonard Washington (played by Chappelle) – Washington first appeared in the first-season sketch &quot;Trading Spouses&quot;, wherein he acted as the patriarch of a white family for a month. Notably, when entering rooms unfamiliar to him, Washington looks out the windows to see if he is being followed. He also expressed his displeasure that many white families do not use washcloths when taking a shower or bath. One of the only things that can make Leonard Washington back down is being shot. When asked for his hometown in the &quot;World Series of Dice&quot; sketch, Washington replied, &quot;Where I&#x27;m from? A little town called none ya goddamn bidness.&quot; He has a wife and a son, T-Mart. He is seemingly unaware of white culture, unknowing of Renée Zellweger (as he stated in &quot;Trading Spouses&quot; after reading &quot;White People Magazine&quot;).
* Ashy Larry (played by Donnell Rawlings) – A shirtless black man with flaky-white skin and chapped lips, he is always seen wearing a pair of white boxer shorts. He appeared in the &quot;World Series of Dice&quot; sketch, in one of Chappelle&#x27;s daydreams during a boring dinner conversation, and was seen holding Chappelle&#x27;s $50 million check in one of the lost episodes. Ashy Larry is also one of the names Wayne Brady calls the PCP he gives to Dave in the Wayne Brady sketch. Rawlings briefly reprised his role as Ashy Larry in the sketch comedy show, &quot;In the Flow with Affion Crockett&quot;, encountering Chappelle (played by Crockett), as well as on the January 18, 2025 episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.
* Robot Dancing Man – Set designer Karl Lake did the robot dance in random places, including a barbershop, club, and a courtroom (in a deleted scene). In the sketches, he is generally not acknowledged, despite the out-of-place behavior, nor does he acknowledge anyone. A few exceptions to this rule have occurred. One of them is during the &quot;Slow-Motion&quot; sketch, in the club, when Dave acknowledges him by saying &quot;The Robot&quot;, and emulating him. Another is when Wayne Brady &quot;takes over&quot; the show, during one of the commercial break introductions; Wayne is looking at Robot Man&#x27;s moves, and proceeds to dance with him. Also, in the opening theme for season three, Charlie Murphy and Donnell Rawlings have hogtied and taken the place of the two men who start off the show. Robot Man is seen in the background doing his dance and the harmonica player yells out &quot;Robot, help us!&quot;, but to no avail.

== Episodes ==
In total, 28 episodes of &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot; produced between 2003 and 2006, in addition to a Music Jump-Off special and four compilation episodes.

===Season 1 (2003)===
===Season 2 (2004)===
===Season 3: &quot;The Lost Episodes&quot; (2006)===

===Specials (2003–04)===
== Third season delays and &quot;The Lost Episodes&quot; ==
During a June 2004 stand-up performance in Sacramento, California, Chappelle left the stage due to audience members interrupting the show by shouting, &quot;I&#x27;m Rick James, bitch!,&quot; a catchphrase from the popular &quot;Rick James&quot; sketch. After a few minutes, Chappelle returned and continued by saying, &quot;The show is ruining my life.&quot; He stated that he disliked working &quot;20 hours a day&quot; and that the popularity of the show was making it difficult for him to continue his stand-up career which was &quot;the most important thing&quot; to him. He also told the audience:

===Initial delays===
The third season of &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot; was scheduled to premiere in February 2005. This date was pushed back to May 31, 2005, when production fell behind schedule in December 2004 because, according to Comedy Central, Chappelle had fallen ill with the flu. He later revealed to Oprah Winfrey that this was untrue and that stress had caused him to leave. On May 4, 2005, just weeks before the anticipated premiere, Comedy Central announced that &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot; would not be ready by the announced date and that production had been suspended &quot;until further notice&quot;. No reason for the delay or suspension was given and no response was given by Chappelle. 

===Chappelle retreats to South Africa===
One week later, it was reported (most notably by &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;) that Chappelle had flown to South Africa on April 28 to stay in an undisclosed psychiatric facility. On May 14, &quot;Time&quot; announced that one of their reporters, Christopher John Farley, had interviewed Chappelle in South Africa, and that no psychiatric treatments were occurring or necessary. Chappelle returned shortly thereafter and quelled rumors of psychiatric or substance-abuse problems, and emphasized that his trip was a &quot;spiritual retreat&quot; intended to keep his sense of reality outside the bubble of intense pressure and fame and to keep his humor fresh. Chappelle would say that he was unhappy with the direction the show had taken, and expressed in an interview with Time magazine his need for reflection in the face of tremendous stress:

===Comedy Central responds===
On July 14, Comedy Central president Doug Herzog announced that Chappelle was welcome back any time, but that the comedian had said he was still not ready to return. Herzog put a positive spin on negotiations, but conceded that he did not expect &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot; to return in 2005. &quot;The New York Times&quot; also reported that Chappelle explained to Herzog, over dinner, that his success was getting to him and that &quot;he wanted to be wrong again sometimes, instead of always being right.&quot; In August, with Herzog and Chappelle having reportedly not spoken since their June 3 meeting, &quot;TV Guide&quot; featured an interview with Charlie Murphy, in which he stated, &quot;&quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot; is over, man. Done... It took me a long time to be able to say those words, but I can say it pretty easy now because it&#x27;s the truth.&quot; Around the same time came confirmation from Comedy Central that co-creator Neal Brennan had left the show, and it was later revealed a rift had formed between him and Chappelle. 

Nonetheless, on December 11, during Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;Last Laugh &#x27;05&quot;, a promotion for the third season of the show was aired.

===Chappelle speaks===
On February 3, 2006, Chappelle made his first television interview since production ceased on season three, on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;. He stated that burnout, losing his creative control, and a work environment that was uncomfortable, were some of the reasons he left the show. He also expressed his contempt for the entertainment industry&#x27;s tone-deafness regarding black entertainers and audiences, &quot;When I see that they put every black man in the movies in a dress at some point in their career, I start connecting the dots.&quot;

Chappelle said that he felt some of his sketches were &quot;socially irresponsible&quot;. He singled out the &quot;pixie sketch&quot;, in which pixies appear to people and encourage them to reinforce stereotypes of their races. In the sketch, Chappelle is wearing blackface and is dressed as a character in a minstrel show. According to Chappelle, a white crew member laughed during its filming in a way that made him uncomfortable, saying, &quot;It was the first time I felt that someone was not laughing with me but laughing at me.&quot; 

He also stated that he would be open to producing the remainder of season three (and perhaps a season four) only if his demands were met, one of which was to ensure that half of the proceeds of future &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot; DVD sales would go to charity. Chappelle expressed disdain at the possibility of his material from the unfinished third season being aired, saying that to do so would be &quot;a bully move&quot;, and that he would not return to the show if Comedy Central were to air the unfinished material. After that announcement, Comedy Central stopped advertising the release of the third season for a period of time.

Chappelle was interviewed for &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot; on December 18, 2005, at Pace University&#x27;s Michael Schimmel Center for the Arts. The show premiered on February 12, 2006. Chappelle said on the program that the death of his father seven years prior influenced his decision to go to South Africa. By throwing himself into his work, he had not taken a chance to mourn his father&#x27;s death. He also said the rumors that he was in drug or psychiatric treatment only persuaded him to stay in South Africa. He said, &quot;I would go to work on the show and I felt awful every day, that&#x27;s not the way it was. ... I felt like some kind of prostitute or something. If I feel so bad, why keep on showing up to this place? I&#x27;m going to Africa. The hardest thing to do is to be true to yourself, especially when everybody is watching.&quot;

===&quot;The Lost Episodes&quot; air===
In April, the network wrapped up production of the third season, taping the live studio audience segments for three episodes. In place of Chappelle, the last episodes were cohosted by regular cast members Charlie Murphy and Donnell Rawlings. Advertised as &quot;The Lost Episodes&quot;, they began airing on July 9, 2006. The third and final episode aired on July 23, 2006. The DVD collection of the lost episodes was released on July 25, 2006.

Chappelle&#x27;s decision to quit the show meant walking away from a $50 million contract with Comedy Central. When asked if he felt guilty about carrying on with the lost episodes without Chappelle, Rawlings replied:
==Release==

The series also airs around the world, with episodes airing on MTV in Germany, Comedy Central in Brazil, The Comedy Network and MuchMusic in Canada, SBS, NITV (sister channel to SBS), The Comedy Channel and 7mate in Australia, and FX in the United Kingdom.

===Home media===
The DVD sets for seasons one and two of &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot; have sold extremely well since their release. As of 2005, the first-season DVD was the best-selling TV series set of all time, beating out other popular shows such as &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (the first season of which held the record beforehand), &quot;American Dad!&quot;, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot;, and &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. According to a 10/17/10 USA Today article, Season 1 has sold over two million copies.

Although the DVDs are &quot;uncensored&quot;, some of the music performances were removed due to licensing issues. Also the episode &quot;Music Jump-Off&quot; which featured Chappelle visiting his old high school, the Duke Ellington School of the Arts, intercut with previously unaired sketches and musical performances, did not make either DVD set.

On October 11, 2005, the first half of the first season was released on UMD.

On May 23, 2006, the first uncensored season was made available for purchase on the iTunes Music Store, and on June 20, the second uncensored season was also made available on iTunes.

On June 5, 2007, Comedy Central released a compilation DVD titled &quot;The Best of Chappelle&#x27;s Show&quot; which highlights 25 of the most popular sketches in all seasons.

On November 20, 2007, Comedy Central released a boxset with season one, season two, and &quot;the Lost Episodes&quot; titled &quot;Chappelle&#x27;s Show – The Series Collection&quot;.

All box sets were released by Paramount Home Entertainment (under the Comedy Central banner).

==== DVD releases ====
===Streaming===
The series is available to be streamed on the Comedy Central app and website. The series is also available to stream on Paramount+, Netflix, and HBO Max. It is free to digitally rent with select public libraries in the United States through Hoopla.

On November 1, 2020, the series became available to stream on Netflix and HBO Max. However, less than two months later, the series was removed from both services following Chappelle&#x27;s commentary concerning his lack of royalties from the show during his appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. On February 11, 2021, Chappelle announced that he had renegotiated his deal with ViacomCBS, and the show returned to the services the following day. Despite the renegotiated deal, Season 3 (the &quot;lost episodes&quot;) were not reposted to Netflix, and has also been withdrawn from other platforms where it was available previously like Crave in Canada.

<text>Jarkko Varvio (April 28, 1972) is a Finnish former ice hockey player who had a very brief stint in the NHL. Varvio was drafted by Minnesota North Stars in the 1992 NHL Entry Draft. He was the top scorer at the 1992 Men&#x27;s World Ice Hockey Championships in Czechoslovakia. However, his only two active seasons in the NHL were in 1993-94 and 1994-95 with the Dallas Stars. In 13 career games, he notched three goals, four assists (for seven points), and had four penalty minutes. Jarkko scored his first NHL goal in his first NHL game, which was also the first game Dallas Stars played as the Stars since leaving Minnesota. After his time with the Stars Varvio bounced around Europe playing in various leagues. Varvio last played for Ravensburg EV in Germany&#x27;s GerObL before retiring in 2005.

<doc id="494604" wikidata="Q860823" url="?curid=494604" title="Japanese aircraft carrier Hōshō">
<text>was the world&#x27;s first commissioned ship that was built as an aircraft carrier, and the first aircraft carrier of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN). Commissioned in 1922, the ship was used for testing carrier aircraft operations equipment, techniques, such as take-offs and landings, and carrier aircraft operational methods and tactics. The ship provided valuable lessons and experience for the IJN in early carrier air operations. &quot;Hōshō&quot; superstructure and other obstructions to the flight deck were removed in 1924 on the advice of experienced aircrews.

&quot;Hōshō&quot; and her aircraft group participated in the Shanghai Incident in 1932 and in the opening stages of the Sino-Japanese War in late 1937. During those two conflicts, the carrier&#x27;s aircraft supported Imperial Japanese Army ground operations and engaged in aerial combat with aircraft of the Nationalist Chinese Air Force. The small size of the ship and her assigned airgroups (usually around 15 aircraft) limited the effectiveness of her contributions to combat operations. As a result, the carrier was placed in after her return to Japan from China and she became a training ship in 1939.

During World War II, &quot;Hōshō&quot; participated in the Battle of Midway in June 1942 in a secondary role. After the battle, the carrier resumed her training role in Japanese home waters for the duration of the conflict and survived the war with only minor damage from air attacks. She was surrendered to the Allies at the end of the war and used to repatriate Japanese troops until she was scrapped in 1946.

==Design and description==
Construction of a seaplane carrier was authorized by the Japanese government in its &quot;eight-six&quot; fleet program of 1918. A planned sister ship, named &quot;Shokaku&quot;, was cancelled in 1922 before any construction started. &quot;Hōshō&quot; was the second warship, after the British , to be built from the keel up as an aircraft carrier, but was launched and completed earlier than &quot;Hermes&quot;.

&quot;Hōshō&quot; was initially designed as a seaplane carrier like with a forward flying-off deck, 32 aircraft, four low-angle guns, and four anti-aircraft (AA) guns. The plan was revised after reports were received from Japanese observers with the Royal Navy in Europe about the desirability to be able to land aircraft on the ship. The new requirements were modeled on after she received her rear flight deck in 1918. The ship was to be capable of and fitted with a forward flight deck, island and funnels amidships, and a large hangar aft. Shortly thereafter based on observations of landing trials on &quot;Furious&quot; and , the world&#x27;s first flush-decked aircraft carrier, &quot;Hōshō&quot;″s flight deck design was revised in April 1919. The island was removed and the funnels were moved to one side to create an unobstructed, full-length flight deck, and the ship was reclassified as an aircraft carrier. The ship&#x27;s hull was based on that of a large cruiser and she was given a small island. Her three funnels were mounted on the starboard side and swiveled to lie horizontal during flight operations. &quot;Hōshō&quot;″s designed speed was reduced to , based on British experiences during World War I.

===General characteristics===
&quot;Hōshō&quot; was completed with an overall length of . She had a beam of and a mean draft of . The ship displaced at standard load, and at normal load. Her crew totaled 512 officers and men. The ship was almost completely unarmored.

===Propulsion===
&quot;Hōshō&quot; had two Parsons geared turbine sets with a total of driving two propeller shafts. Eight Kampon Type B water-tube boilers with a working pressure of and a temperature of provided steam to the turbines, although only four were oil-fired. The other four used a mix of oil and coal. The ship&#x27;s designed speed was 25 knots, but she made from on her sea trials on 30 November 1922. She carried of fuel oil and of coal, an extraordinary total for such a small ship, to give her a range of at .

To reduce rolling and increase stability for aircraft operations, a gyrostabilizer produced by the American Sperry Gyroscope Company was installed. The installation initially proved unreliable as the Japanese technicians were badly trained by Sperry, but eventually the system proved its worth as the technicians gained experience.

===Flight deck arrangements===

&quot;Hōshō&quot;″s flight deck was long and wide. The forward end sloped down at an angle of −5° to help aircraft accelerate during takeoff. A small island was mounted well forward on the starboard side and contained the ship&#x27;s bridge and air-operations control center. The island was fitted with a small tripod mast intended to carry the ship&#x27;s fire-control system. Fifteen different types of arresting gear were evaluated before the British longitudinal wire system was adopted. Low landing speeds of the time meant that aircraft had little difficulty in stopping, but their light weight made them vulnerable to wind gusts that could blow them over the side of the carrier, and the longitudinal wires helped to prevent that. Forward of the island was a collapsible crane for loading aircraft into the forward hangar.

The flight deck, unlike those on Royal Navy carriers, was superimposed on the ship&#x27;s hull rather than constructed as a strength deck supporting the carrier&#x27;s hull structure. A system of lights and mirrors along the flight deck assisted pilots in landing on the carrier.

&quot;Hōshō&quot; was the only Japanese aircraft carrier with two hangars. The forward hangar was and only one deck in height as it was intended to house nine small aircraft, such as fighters. The two-story rear hangar measured at the forward end and at the rear end. It was designed to house six large aircraft, such as torpedo bombers, as well as six reserve aircraft. Each hangar was served by an aircraft elevator. The forward elevator was and the aft elevator measured .

===Air group===

&quot;Hōshō&quot; had a normal capacity of fifteen aircraft, subject to the limitations of her hangars. She was first commissioned with an air group of nine Mitsubishi 1MF (Type 10) fighters and three to six Mitsubishi B1M3 (Type 13) torpedo bombers. In 1928, the fighters were replaced by the A1N1 (Type 3). Three years later the air group consisted of Nakajima A2N (Type 90) fighters and Mitsubishi B2M (Type 89) torpedo bombers. In 1938 Nakajima A4N (Type 95) fighters and Yokosuka B3Y (Type 92) bombers flew from the ship. In 1940 the air group was modernized with Mitsubishi A5M (Type 96) &quot;Claude&quot; fighters and Yokosuka B4Y1 (Type 96) &quot;Jean&quot; bombers.

===Armament===
&quot;Hōshō&quot; was armed with four 50-caliber 14 cm/50 3rd Year Type guns, two on each side. The two forward guns had a firing arc of 150°, including straight ahead, while the rear guns could fire 120° on either side. They fired projectiles at a rate of six to ten rounds per minute with a muzzle velocity of about ; at 35°, they had a maximum range of . A heavy gun armament was provided for &quot;Hōshō&quot;; as carrier doctrine was just evolving at this time, the impracticability of carriers engaging in gun duels had not yet been realized. Her large flight deck and lack of armor made her a vulnerable target in surface battles.

A pair of 40-caliber 8 cm/40 3rd Year Type guns on retractable mounts provided &quot;Hōshō&quot;″s only anti-aircraft defense. They were positioned on the flight deck, just forward of the rear elevator. These guns fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of about ; at 45°, this provided a maximum range of , and they had a maximum ceiling of at 75° elevation. Their effective rate of fire was 13 to 20 rounds per minute.

==Service==

===Early career===
&quot;Hōshō&quot; was laid down by the Asano Shipbuilding Company in Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama, on 16 December 1920. She was launched on 13 November 1921 and towed to Yokosuka Naval Arsenal for completion on 10 January 1922. &quot;Hōshō&quot; was delayed by repeated design changes and late deliveries of equipment, pushing the commissioning date from March to 27 December 1922. She was commissioned lacking much of her aviation equipment, and did not begin landing trials until 22 February 1923. The first landings were made by British pilots under contract, who were quickly replaced by Japanese pilots trained by the British Aviation Mission.
After &quot;Hōshō&quot; was commissioned, experienced aircrews requested changes, and the ship was modified by the shipyard from 6 June to 20 August 1924. The island, tripod mast, and aircraft crane were removed since they partially obstructed the flight deck and obscured pilot visibility. The forward part of the flight deck was made horizontal, and the 8 cm AA guns were moved forward, close to the position of the former island and out of the way of landing operations. Another reason for removal of the island was that the IJN found that it was too small and cramped to be of effective use in controlling air operations or the ship. After the island was removed, the carrier&#x27;s flight operations were controlled from a platform extending from the side of the flight deck, a design that would be repeated in subsequent Japanese aircraft carriers. The ship was then assigned to the 1st Fleet until 15 November 1924.

&quot;Hōshō&quot; was fitted with a net used as a barricade aft of the forward elevator between 10 March and 2 July 1925. It was intended to prevent landing aircraft from colliding with aircraft preparing to take off, and stop them from falling into the open elevator well. The barrier was hydraulically operated and could be erected in three seconds.

As the first of her kind, &quot;Hōshō&quot; provided valuable experience and insight into carrier air operations for the IJN. The ship was used for testing aircraft and equipment, particularly various types of arresting gear and optical landing aids. The lessons learned influenced the design and construction of and the subsequent conversions of battlecruiser and battleship into aircraft carriers. &quot;Hōshō&quot; was actively used to develop carrier operational methods and tactics for the IJN during the 1920s. She was assigned to the First Carrier Division with &quot;Akagi&quot; on 1 April 1928. During the 1930s &quot;Hōshō&quot; was fitted with three different types of transverse arresting gear for trials.

===Shanghai===

Along with &quot;Kaga&quot;, &quot;Hōshō&quot; was assigned to the First Carrier Division and sent to China during the Shanghai Incident that began in January 1932. Operating with the Third Fleet, &quot;Hōshō&quot; arrived at the mouth of the Yangtze River on 1 February. Her aircraft participated in the IJN&#x27;s first aerial combat on 5 February when three fighters, escorting two attack aircraft, were engaged by nine Chinese fighters over Shanghai; one Chinese fighter was damaged, although the Japanese pilots made no claim. Two days later, the two carriers sent some of their aircraft to Kunda Airfield where they flew ground attack missions in support of the Imperial Japanese Army. Between 23 and 26 February, &quot;Kaga&quot; and &quot;Hōshō&quot; bombers attacked Chinese airfields at Hangzhou and Suzhou, destroying a number of Chinese aircraft on the ground. On 26 February, six fighters from &quot;Hōshō&quot;, escorting nine attack aircraft from &quot;Kaga&quot; on one of the bombing raids, shot down three of five Chinese fighters that engaged them. The First Carrier Division rejoined the Combined Fleet on 20 March, after a ceasefire had been declared on 3 March.

===Fourth Fleet incident===
&quot;Hōshō&quot; participated in the Combined Fleet Maneuvers of 1935 during which she was attached to the IJN Fourth Fleet. Caught in a typhoon on 23 September, the carrier and a number of other Japanese ships were badly damaged in what was referred to as the &quot;Fourth Fleet incident.&quot; The ship&#x27;s forward flight deck collapsed and part had to be cut away before the carrier could proceed to Yokosuka for repairs. The Fourth Fleet incident and the Tomozuru Incident of 1934, in which a top-heavy torpedo boat capsized in heavy weather, caused the Japanese command to investigate the stability of all their ships, resulting in a number of design changes to improve stability and increase hull strength.

While the &quot;Hōshō&quot; was at the dockyard between 22 November 1935 and 31 March 1936, her stability was improved; the forward flight deck&#x27;s supports were reinforced and increased in number; the ship&#x27;s AA guns, aircraft crane and upper deck aviation fuel tanks were removed; the funnels were fixed in the horizontal position with their mouths angled slightly downwards; the front sides of &quot;Hōshō&quot;″s forward hangar and bridge were reinforced; and the ship&#x27;s hull was reinforced in the vicinity of her rear hangar to increase her longitudinal strength. At full load, her metacentric height after these changes was . Six twin 13.2 mm Type 93 Hotchkiss machine guns were also fitted.

===Sino-Japanese War===

During the Sino-Japanese War, &quot;Hōshō&quot; rejoined the Third Fleet and supported land operations of the army in Central China in August 1937 with &quot;Ryūjō&quot;, later joined by &quot;Kaga&quot;. The three carriers carried a total of 90 aircraft to the conflict in China, including 15 from &quot;Hōshō&quot;, 27 on &quot;Ryūjō&quot;, and the rest with &quot;Kaga&quot;. Details of the activities of &quot;Hōshō&quot;″s aircraft are scarce, but three of the ship&#x27;s Nakajima A2N fighters shot down a Martin B-10 bomber on 25 July.

The carrier returned to Japan to refuel on 1 September and then sailed to the South China coast, accompanied by &quot;Ryūjō&quot;, and began operations against Chinese forces near Canton, now Guangzhou, on 21 September. That day, &quot;Hōshō&quot; contributed six fighters to escort bombers attacking airfields and the combined force encountered seven Curtiss Hawk III fighters, shooting down two, in addition to a pair of observation planes, for no combat losses of their own. Five of the Japanese fighters ran out of fuel during the return flight and had to ditch in the sea, although the aircrews were rescued. A followup air strike that afternoon was unsuccessfully attacked by the five remaining Hawks, at the cost of one of their own. The Japanese pilots claimed to have shot down sixteen enemy aircraft and an additional probable loss during the day&#x27;s fighting. &quot;Hōshō&quot; and &quot;Ryūjō&quot; returned to the Shanghai area on 3 October and &quot;Hōshō&quot;″s aircraft were temporarily transferred to Kunda airfield to support ground operations. On 17 October, the carrier transferred all of her aircraft to &quot;Ryūjō&quot; and returned to Japan where she was placed in on 1 December.

During this time, her aircraft elevators were enlarged in 1939: the forward elevator to and the rear elevator to . On 12 August 1939 &quot;Hōshō&quot; was deemed useful as a training carrier and, in critical battles, as a platform for A4N1 (Type 95) fighters and B4Y1 (Type 96) torpedo bombers, for as long as those planes remained serviceable. A later investigation determined on 23 December 1940 that she could not operate the latest aircraft types like the Mitsubishi A6M Zero, the Aichi D3A &quot;Val&quot;, or the Nakajima B5N &quot;Kate&quot; in combat. Also, the small size of the carrier&#x27;s airgroup limited the ship&#x27;s potential value to the fleet in any future conflicts.

===World War II===

====Pearl Harbor and Midway====
&quot;Hōshō&quot; began the Pacific War in the Third Carrier Division assigned to the 1st Fleet under Vice Admiral Shirō Takasu. The carrier, captained by Kaoru Umetani, was tasked along with to provide air support, including scouting, anti-submarine patrols, and combat air patrol for the Combined Fleet&#x27;s &quot;Main Body&quot; battle-line of six battleships: , , , , , and . With the Main Body, &quot;Hōshō&quot; sortied from the Inland Sea on 7 December 1941 to provide distant cover for the carrier forces under Chūichi Nagumo which were attacking Pearl Harbor. The battleship force turned back east of Japan, but &quot;Hōshō&quot; became separated on 10 December due to radio silence restrictions while conducting anti-submarine air operations. The ship lost contact because she had launched aircraft near dusk to investigate a submarine sighting. The aircraft returned after dark and landed safely after the carrier turned on its lights. In order to recover the aircraft, however, the carrier and her three escorting destroyers had to steam east and therefore lost sight of the Main Body in the darkness. There does not appear to have been any enemy submarines in Japanese waters at this time. The carrier was located by scout aircraft the next day east of the Main Body and returned to port at Kure on 12 December.
On 29 May 1942, &quot;Hōshō&quot; sortied from Japan with the rest of the fleet for the operation which resulted in the Battle of Midway, providing modest air protection, scouting, and anti-submarine support for the Main Body, now consisting of the battleships , &quot;Nagato&quot;, and &quot;Mutsu&quot;. Her aircraft complement for the operation consisted of eight obsolete Yokosuka B4Y &quot;Jean&quot; torpedo bombers.

With the Main Body trailing behind the carrier striking force, &quot;Hōshō&quot; missed the major portion of the battle in which Nagumo&#x27;s four fleet carriers were ambushed and fatally damaged by US carrier aircraft on 4 June. The next day, the carrier&#x27;s aircraft helped guide the remnants of Nagumo&#x27;s force to a rendezvous with the Main Body as well helped other Japanese warships to rendezvous during and after the battle, including the cruiser . Around the same time, one of &quot;Hōshō&quot;″s aircraft discovered the burning, sinking . Photographs of the abandoned carrier have been described as &quot;among the most dramatic of the war in the Pacific&quot;. The observer aboard the aircraft also reported seeing survivors left behind on &quot;Hiryū&quot; so the destroyer was sent to unsuccessfully search for the wrecked carrier. With the battle lost, a significant strategic defeat for Japan, the carrier returned to Japan with the rest of the fleet, arriving at the Hashirajima anchorage on 14 June.

====Training ship====
After her return to Japan, &quot;Hōshō&quot; was transferred to the Third Fleet, unofficially assigned to the training fleet (later called the Mobile Force Training Force), and officially assigned in October. She conducted flight training in the Inland Sea for aircraft that flew in from shore bases, since no aircraft were based onboard &quot;Hōshō&quot;. On 15 January 1943, the 50th Air Flotilla was created for carrier aircrew training and both &quot;Hōshō&quot; and &quot;Ryūhō&quot; were assigned to the new unit. The two ships provided carrier landing training and served as target ships for torpedo training. In January 1944, &quot;Hōshō&quot; was reassigned to the 12th Air Fleet, then to the Combined Fleet, but continued to perform the same mission of training fleet carrier pilots in the Inland Sea. In this role, &quot;Hōshō&quot; shuttled back and forth between Kure and the Western Inland Sea, spending equal amounts of time at each location.
In order to service new and larger aircraft like the Nakajima B6N &quot;Jill&quot; torpedo bomber and the Yokosuka D4Y &quot;Judy&quot; dive bomber, the flight deck was extended over at each end to a total length of from 27 March to 26 April 1944. &quot;Hōshō&quot; also received new arresting gear and a new crash barrier. The additional weight high up in the ship adversely affected her stability and she was restricted from operations in bad weather lest she capsize. At some point during the war the ship&#x27;s 14 cm guns were removed and she received about twenty 25-millimeter Type 96 autocannons in single mounts. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of ; at 50°, this provided a maximum range of , and an effective ceiling of . The 15-round magazines needed to be changed frequently, and the maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute.

After the modifications, &quot;Hōshō&quot; continued to provide training to navy pilots in the Inland Sea, including acting as a target ship for torpedo training. At 05:30 on 19 March 1945, possibly while berthed at Kure, the carrier was caught in an air raid by carrier aircraft from the United States Task Force 58. &quot;Hōshō&quot;″s flight deck was damaged by three bomb hits which killed six crewmen. Emergency repairs were made and her captain was ordered to keep her in readiness on 10 April. However, this order was revoked two days later and the carrier became a &quot;4th reserve ship&quot; with most of her crew transferred elsewhere. &quot;Hōshō&quot; was taken out of reserve as a &quot;special guard ship&quot; on 1 June and many of her crew were transferred back. During this time, the ship remained moored and camouflaged off Nishinomishima at Kure.

&quot;Hōshō&quot; was slightly damaged by a single bomb or aerial rocket hit when the Allies attacked Kure again on 24 July 1945. Information is scarce on the extent of the ship&#x27;s involvement in the action, but it appears the carrier&#x27;s participation was minimal, as she embarked no aircraft at the time. &quot;Hōshō&quot; was repaired within 15 days, although the ship relocated to Moji two days later.

==Post-war==

The ship was turned over to Allied forces at the time of the surrender of Japan on 2 September and was stricken from the navy list on 5 October. &quot;Hōshō&quot; then served as a repatriation transport to retrieve Japanese servicemen and civilians stationed overseas and return them to Japan. In October and November 1945, accompanied by the cruiser &quot;Kashima&quot;, she carried 700 passengers from Wotje Atoll, 311 from Jaluit Atoll, and an undocumented number from Enewetak Atoll to Uraga, Kanagawa.

In December 1945, &quot;Hōshō&quot;″s overhanging flight deck at the bow was cut off to improve visibility from the bridge and her hangars were modified to carry more passengers. Thereafter, she undertook more repatriation missions beginning with one to Wewak on 5 January 1946 and subsequent trips to China. In total, the carrier made nine repatriation trips before 15 August 1946 and transported about 40,000 passengers. &quot;Hōshō&quot; was transferred to the Home Ministry on 31 August for disposal. She was scrapped in Osaka from 2 September 1946 to 1 May 1947 by the Kyōwa Shipbuilding Company.

<text>Mary Tomlinson (February 24, 1890 – April 10, 1975), professionally known as Marjorie Main, was an American character actress and singer of the Classical Hollywood period, best known as a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer contract player in the 1940s and 1950s, and for her role as Ma Kettle in 10 Ma and Pa Kettle movies. Main started her career in vaudeville and theatre, and appeared in film classics, such as &quot;Dead End&quot; (1937), &quot;The Women&quot; (1939), &quot;Dark Command&quot; (1940), &quot;The Shepherd of the Hills&quot; (1941), &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; (1944), and &quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot; (1956).

==Early life==
Mary Tomlinson was born on February 24, 1890, near Acton, in rural Marion County, Indiana. She was the second daughter of Reverend Samuel J. Tomlinson, a Disciples of Christ minister, and Jennie L. (McGaughey) Tomlinson. Mary&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Doctor Samuel McGaughey, was the Acton physician who delivered her.

At the age of three, Tomlinson moved with her family to Indianapolis, Indiana, where her father was pastor of Hillside Christian Church. Four years later, they moved to Goshen and then Elkhart, Indiana. In the early 1900s, the Tomlinson family settled on a farm near Fairland, Indiana.

After attending public schools in Fairland and Shelbyville, Tomlinson spent a year (1905–06) at Franklin College in Franklin, Indiana, where she was a charter member of what became the present-day Delta Delta Delta sorority, before transferring to the Hamilton School of Dramatic Expression in Lexington, Kentucky. She completed a three-year course of study in 1909 at the age of 19. After graduation, Tomlinson took a job as a dramatics instructor at Bourbon College in Paris, Kentucky, but stayed only a year. Tomlinson later claimed that she was fired from the position after asking for a salary increase.

After Tomlinson left Kentucky, she spent the next several years studying dramatic arts in Chicago and New York City, despite her father&#x27;s disapproval of her career choice. Tomlinson adopted the stage name of Marjorie Main during her early acting career to avoid embarrassing her family.

==Marriage==
Main married widower Stanley LeFevre Krebs, a psychologist and lecturer, on November 2, 1921. They met while she was performing on the Chautauqua circuit. Main accompanied Krebs on the lecture circuit, handling the details of their life on the road. They had no children together, and made their home in New York City. Main performed with touring companies and in New York theaters on a part-time basis throughout her marriage. She also began her Hollywood film career in 1931. Main considered this period &quot;the happiest years of her life.&quot; She returned to a full-time acting career after Krebs died of cancer on September 26, 1935.

The Krebses&#x27; marriage was a nontraditional one. By her accounts, the marriage was happy, but not particularly close. Main claimed to be &quot;brokenhearted&quot; following her husband&#x27;s death, but also explained that his death was &quot;like losing a good friend. Like part of the family.&quot; Main&#x27;s biographer, Michelle Vogel, quotes a later interview in which the actress related: &quot;Dr. Krebs wasn&#x27;t a very practical man. I didn&#x27;t figure on having to run the show, I kinda tired of it after a few years. We pretty much went our own ways, but we was [sic] still in the eyes of the law, man and wife.&quot;

Vogel also revealed that Main had a long-term relationship with actress Spring Byington.

==Career==
===Early years===
Main began her professional career as a performer touring in Chautauqua presentations with a Shakespearean repertory company. After performing for five months in a stock company in Fargo, North Dakota, she began working in vaudeville.

===Stage actress===
In the mid 1910s, Main appeared in several plays, which included touring in &quot;Cheating Cheaters &quot; with John Barrymore in 1916. She also debuted in the Broadway theatre in &quot;Yes or No&quot; in 1918. In addition, Main returned to vaudeville to perform at the Palace Theater in a skit called &quot;The Family Ford&quot; with comedian W. C. Fields. Not all of the early plays in which she appeared were a success. &quot;A House Divided&quot; closed in 1923 after just one performance, but Main continued to find work on the Broadway stage. In 1927, she played Mae West&#x27;s mother in &quot;The Wicked Age&quot;, and in 1928, played opposite Barbara Stanwyck in the long-running stage hit &quot;Burlesque&quot;. Main also appeared in several other Broadway productions: &quot;Salvation&quot; in 1928, &quot;Scarlet Sister Mary&quot; in 1930, &quot;Ebb Tide&quot; in 1931, &quot;Music in the Air&quot; in 1932, and &quot;Jackson White&quot;.

One of Main&#x27;s highest-profile stage performances was in 1935&#x27;s &quot;Dead End&quot; as Mrs. Martin, the mother of gangster Baby Face Martin. She played the role in 460 performances before leaving the show in 1936 to play Lucy, a hotel-keeper/dude-ranch operator, in &quot;The Women&quot;. Main recreated these two roles in film versions of the plays in 1937 and 1939, respectively.

===Film career===
One of Main&#x27;s first feature-film appearances was as an extra in &quot;A House Divided&quot; (1931). She also appeared in &quot;Take A Chance&quot; (1933) and &quot;Crime Without Passion&quot; (1934), and recreated her stage role as a servant in the film version of &quot;Music in the Air&quot; (also 1934), but most of her performance was cut from the film. Main also made a few more films in Hollywood in the 1930s before returning to the stage in New York City.

Samuel Goldwyn signed Main to reprise her stage role as the mother of a gangster for the film version of &quot;Dead End&quot; (1937). Humphrey Bogart was cast as her son. She transferred another strong stage performance to film as the dude-ranch operator in &quot;The Women&quot; (1939).

Main portrayed a diverse set of characters in subsequent films for different studios. These included roles where she was cast as a mother, prison matron, a landlady, aunt, secretary, and a rental agent, among others.

Main was signed to a seven-year Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) contract in 1940, after starring with Wallace Beery in &quot;Wyoming&quot; (1940). She also co-starred in &quot;Dark Command&quot; (1940) with Walter Pidgeon, and appeared in six major films in 1941.

During World War II, Main used her stage and film notoriety to help promote the sale of war bonds for the U.S. War Department. In December 1942, she returned for a visit to central Indiana, where she helped in the sale of more than $500,000 in war bonds.
In the mid-1940s, in an attempt to repeat the great success Wallace Beery had in teaming with Marie Dressler in the early 1930s, MGM cast Main opposite Beery in six more films, including &quot;Barnacle Bill&quot; (1941), &quot;Jackass Mail&quot; (1942), and &quot;Bad Bascomb&quot; (1946). She also played Sonora Cassidy, the chief cook, in &quot;The Harvey Girls&quot; (1946).
Main&#x27;s best-known role was Ma Kettle in the Ma and Pa Kettle film series. She had renewed her contract with MGM for another seven years, which continued until the mid-1950s, when the studio lent her to Universal Pictures to play Ma Kettle for the first time in &quot;The Egg and I&quot; (1947), starring Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray. Main played opposite Percy Kilbride as Pa Kettle and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her performance in the film.

The two Kettle characters proved to be so popular among film audiences that Universal decided to do a series. Main portrayed the Ma Kettle character in nine Ma and Pa Kettle films between 1949 and 1957. Kilbride was her co-star in most of the films, but left after &quot;Ma and Pa Kettle at Waikiki&quot; (1955), the seventh in the series. Main filmed &quot;The Kettles in the Ozarks&quot; (1956) without Kilbride. Parker Fennelly played the Pa Kettle role opposite Main in the final film of the series, &quot;The Kettles on Old MacDonald&#x27;s Farm&quot; (1957) Each film grossed Universal about $3 million, which helped save the studio from a financial collapse. In addition to acting in the films, Main wrote some of the dialogue for her character and created her costumes and make-up.

During this time, Main shuttled back and forth between Universal Studios and MGM. She appeared in several MGM musicals during the 1940s and early 1950s, including, &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; (1944) and &quot;The Belle of New York&quot; (1952). She played Mrs. Wrenley in the studio&#x27;s all-star film &quot;It&#x27;s a Big Country&quot; (1951). Main played her last roles for MGM as Mrs. Hittaway in &quot;The Long, Long Trailer&quot; (1954) and as Jane Dunstock in &quot;Rose Marie&quot; (1954). Main portrayed the widow Hudspeth in the hit film &quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot; (1956). Main&#x27;s final film appearance was in her best-known role as Ma Kettle in &quot;The Kettles on Old MacDonald&#x27;s Farm&quot; (1957)

===Radio and television appearances===
On December 15, 1941, she was part of the cast of Norman Corwin&#x27;s radio program &quot;We Hold These Truths&quot;. She also performed in &quot;The Goldbergs&quot;.

In 1958, Main appeared as a rugged frontierswoman Cassie Tanner in the episodes &quot;The Cassie Tanner Story&quot; and S1 E39 &quot;The Sacramento Story&quot; of the television series &quot;Wagon Train&quot;.

==Later years==
After her retirement from acting, Main lived a quiet, secluded life in Los Angeles. She became interested in spiritualism and the Moral Re-Armament movement.

==Death and legacy==
Main died of lung cancer on April 10, 1975, at the age of 85 at St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital in Los Angeles, where she had been admitted on April 3. Main is buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills, California, beside her husband, Doctor Stanley Krebs.

Main, who is best known for playing &quot;raucous, rough, and cantankerous women&quot; on-screen, was characterized as &quot;soft-spoken, shy,&quot; and &quot;dignified&quot; when she was off-screen. Main became a popular character actress of the 1940s and 1950s. She appeared in diverse roles on the stage and in more than 80 films, including some that became classics, such as &quot;Dead End&quot; (1937), &quot;Dark Command&quot; (1940), &quot;The Shepherd of the Hills&quot; (1941), &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; (1944), and &quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot; (1956), but is best known for her Ma Kettle role in the Ma and Pa Kettle film series. The &quot;cornball humor&quot; of the Kettle films endured in television shows, such as &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; and &quot;Green Acres&quot;, of the 1960s.

<doc id="494630" wikidata="Q889872" url="?curid=494630" title="Coachella">
<text>Coachella (officially called the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and sometimes known as Coachella Festival) is an annual music and arts festival held at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California, in the Coachella Valley in the Colorado Desert. It was co-founded by Paul Tollett and Rick Van Santen in 1999, and is organized by Goldenvoice, a subsidiary of AEG Presents. The event features musical artists from many genres of music, including rock, pop, indie, hip hop and electronic dance music, as well as art installations and sculptures. Across the grounds, several stages continuously host live music.

The festival&#x27;s origins trace back to a 1993 concert that Pearl Jam performed at the Empire Polo Club while boycotting venues controlled by Ticketmaster. The show validated the site&#x27;s viability for hosting large events, leading to the inaugural Coachella Festival being held over the course of two days in October 1999, three months after Woodstock &#x27;99. After no event was held in 2000, Coachella returned on an annual basis beginning in April 2001 as a single-day event. In 2002, the festival reverted to a two-day format. Coachella was expanded to a third day in 2007 and eventually a second weekend in 2012; it is now held on consecutive three-day weekends in April, with the same lineup each weekend. Organizers began permitting spectators to camp on the grounds in 2003, one of several expansions and additions in the festival&#x27;s history. The festival was not held in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Coachella showcases popular and established musical artists as well as emerging artists and reunited groups. It is one of the largest, most famous, and most profitable music festivals in the United States and the world. Each Coachella staged from 2013 to 2015 set new records for festival attendance and gross revenues. The 2017 festival was attended by 250,000 people and grossed $114.6 million. Coachella&#x27;s success led to Goldenvoice establishing additional music festivals at the site, beginning with the annual Stagecoach country music festival in 2007.

==History==
On November 5, 1993, Pearl Jam performed for almost 25,000 fans at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California. The site was selected because the band refused to play in Los Angeles as a result of a dispute with Ticketmaster over service charges applied to ticket purchases. The show established the polo club&#x27;s suitability for large-scale events; Paul Tollett, whose concert promotion company Goldenvoice booked the venue for Pearl Jam, said the concert sowed the seeds for an eventual music festival there.

Around 1997, Goldenvoice was struggling to book concerts against larger companies, and they were unable to offer guarantees as high as their competitors, such as SFX Entertainment. Tollett said, &quot;We were getting our ass kicked financially. We were losing a lot of bands. And we couldn&#x27;t compete with the money.&quot; As a result, the idea of a music festival was conceived, and Tollett began to brainstorm ideas for one with multiple venues. His intent was to book trendy artists who were not necessarily chart successes: &quot;Maybe if you put a bunch of them together, that might be a magnet for a lot of people.&quot; While attending the 1997 Glastonbury Festival, Tollett handed out pamphlets to artists and talent managers that featured pictures of the Empire Polo Club and pitched a possible festival there. In contrast to the frequently muddy conditions at Glastonbury caused by rain, he recalled, &quot;We had this pamphlet... showing sunny Coachella. Everyone was laughing.&quot;

After scouting several sites for their festival, Tollett and Goldenvoice co-president Rick Van Santen returned to the Empire Polo Club during the Big Gig festival in 1998. Impressed by the location&#x27;s suitability for a festival, they decided to book their event there. The promoters had hoped to stage their inaugural festival in 1998 but were unable to until the following year. On July 16, 1999, Goldenvoice announced that the Indio City Council had approved the festival and would provide $90,000 for services such as traffic control and public safety. The funds came with a guarantee of repayment from the promoter, as the city was keen to avoid incurring another loss; the previous year&#x27;s Big Gig festival cost Indio $16,000 due to last-minute changes to the lineup and poor attendance. The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival was officially announced on July 28 with a preliminary lineup of 40 acts; tickets went on sale on August 7.

Coachella&#x27;s announcement came just one week after the conclusion of Woodstock &#x27;99, a festival in July 1999 that was marred by looting, arson, violence, and rapes. Goldenvoice&#x27;s insurance costs increased 40% as a result and the company faced uncertainty regarding Coachella&#x27;s tickets. Organizers were already aiming to provide a &quot;high-comfort festival experience&quot; for Coachella but rededicated themselves to those efforts after Woodstock &#x27;99. Advertisements boasted free water fountains, ample restrooms, and misting tents. Retrospectively, Tollett called the decision to announce a new festival just two months prior to staging it &quot;financial suicide&quot;.

===1999, 2001–2002===
On October 9–10, 1999, the inaugural Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival was held. Headlining the event were Beck, Tool, and Rage Against the Machine; other acts included the Chemical Brothers, Morrissey, A Perfect Circle, Jurassic 5 and Underworld. Originally, promoters had hoped to make the event three days (Friday to Sunday) and even considered the UK group Massive Attack as the third-day headliner. The organizers strove to recreate European music festivals with small crowds in a great setting with plenty of turntables. By booking acts based on artistry rather than radio popularity, Coachella earned the title of &quot;the anti-Woodstock&quot;.

Tickets sold for $50 for each day; about 17,000 tickets sold for the first day, and 20,000 for the second, falling short of the overall attendance goal of 70,000. Attendees were offered free parking and a free bottle of water upon entrance. The event went smoothly, with the well-behaved crowd starkly contrasting with the violence that plagued Woodstock &#x27;99; the biggest challenges to Coachella concertgoers were temperatures exceeding 100 °F and the decisions of which of the 80-plus acts to attend. The festival was well regarded among attendees and critics; Pollstar named it festival of the year, and Robert Hilburn of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said that it &quot;laid the foundation for what someday may be a legacy of its own&quot;. However, Goldenvoice lost $850,000 on the undertaking, forcing the promoter, in Tollett&#x27;s words, to &quot;struggle for almost two years to survive as a company&quot;. Prominent acts, including the headliners, agreed to receive deferred compensation.

Goldenvoice reserved tentative dates for October 2000 to reprise the festival, but ultimately canceled for that year; Tollett blamed it on the oversaturation of music festivals in Southern California. Instead, Goldenvoice partnered with promoter Pasquale Rotella to stage the electronic dance music festival Nocturnal Wonderland at the Empire Polo Club in September 2000.

Goldenvoice opted to bring Coachella back in April 2001 in an attempt to beat the heat. Ticket prices were raised to $65. Organizers encountered difficulty booking acts for the festival and due to &quot;available talent&quot;, were forced to shorten the festival to a single day. Issues with securing a headliner threatened to doom the event until Perry Farrell agreed to bring his reunited group Jane&#x27;s Addiction to the proceedings. Amidst financial concerns, Tollett agreed to sell Goldenvoice to Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) in March 2001 for $7 million. AEG, which had opened Staples Center in Los Angeles two years prior, purchased the promoter to help them find shows to book. The corporation wanted Tollett to continue staging Coachella, understanding that it initially would lose money; Tollett initially retained full control of Coachella as a result of the acquisition. Like its predecessor, the 2001 festival went smoothly; 32,000 people attended, and despite taking a loss again, Tollett estimates it was a &quot;low, low six-figure sum&quot;.

For its third outing, Coachella reverted to a two-day format and took place from April 27–28, 2002. Tollett said that the event was expanded to a second day after more acts began expressing interest in participating. With around 60 artists performing, the festival featured headliners Björk and Oasis, along with a reunion of Siouxsie and the Banshees. Palm Desert natives Queens of the Stone Age became the first local band to play the festival. Multiple changes were made for that year: one less tent was used, reducing the number of stages from five to four, and a fence in the middle of the polo field was removed to increase the openness of the site. The strong supporting acts helped prove to the Indio community that the event could bring in money and take place without conflict. More than 55,000 people attended over the two days, and for the first time, the festival nearly broke even.

===2003–2005===
The 2003 festival took place from April 26–27. Among the 82 acts booked by Goldenvoice were headliners Red Hot Chili Peppers and Beastie Boys, as well as a reunited Iggy Pop and the Stooges. Performances were held on two outdoor stages and in three tents. Ticket prices remained $75 per day, but were increased to $140 for a two-day pass. For the first time, on-site camping was offered; the Indio City Council approved overnight camping at the site, permitting up to four people on each of the 2,252 camping spots. The festival drew 60,000 people, the largest Coachella crowd to that point. The festival began to develop worldwide interest and receive national renown.
In late December 2003, Van Santen died at the age of 41 from flu-related complications. With Tollett left, he sold half of Coachella to AEG in 2004, along with the controlling interest in the festival. The 2004 event featured a lineup of more than 80 acts, with Radiohead and the Cure as headliners, along with a reunion of the Pixies. It was Coachella&#x27;s first sellout, drawing a two-day total of 110,000 people. For the first time, the festival attracted attendees from all 50 US states. The event was critically acclaimed; Hilburn called it &quot;the premier pop music festival in the country&quot;, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; labeled it &quot;America&#x27;s Best Music Festival&quot;. Tollett said that 2004 was the turning point for Coachella, and he credited booking Radiohead with elevating the festival&#x27;s stature and interest among musicians. However, he also described that year&#x27;s event as a missed opportunity, as he passed on a chance to expand it to a third day that could have featured David Bowie as a headliner.

The 2005 event ran from April 30 to May 1 and featured Coldplay and Nine Inch Nails as headliners, along with a reunion of Bauhaus. A planned reunion of Cocteau Twins was ultimately cancelled by the group. Approximately 50,000 people attended each day of the festival.

===2006–2008===

The 2006 event featured headliners Depeche Mode and Tool. Two of the most popular performances were Madonna, who played in an overflowing dance tent, and Daft Punk, whose show featuring a pyramid-shaped stage is cited as one of the most memorable performances in Coachella history. Around 120,000 concertgoers attended the event over two days, garnering Goldenvoice a gross of $9 million.

In 2007, Goldenvoice inaugurated the Stagecoach Festival, an annual country music festival that also takes place at the Empire Polo Club the weekend following Coachella. The new event helped avert complications with organizing Coachella; the polo club&#x27;s owner Alex Haagen III had been planning to redevelop the land unless a new profitable event could be created to make a long-term lease with Goldenvoice financially feasible. Along with the new festival&#x27;s addition, Coachella was permanently extended to three days in 2007. The headlining acts were Red Hot Chili Peppers, the reunited Rage Against the Machine, and Björk, all of whom headlined for the second time. The festival compiled a three-day aggregate attendance of over 186,000, a new best, and grossed $16.3 million.

In 2008, Coachella did not sell out for the first time since 2003. It featured headliners Prince, Roger Waters, and Jack Johnson. Waters&#x27; inflatable prop pig flew away during his set. The 2008 festival drew an attendance of 151,666 and grossed $13.8 million, but lost money, due to tickets not selling out and high booking fees paid for Prince and Roger Waters.

===2009–2011===
The 2009 festival occurred a week earlier than usual. The new dates were April 17, 18 and 19. The event featured headliners Paul McCartney, The Killers, and The Cure. On Friday, McCartney blew past the festival&#x27;s strict curfew by 54 minutes. Sunday, The Cure had their performance end abruptly, with the festival cutting stage power after passing their own curfew by 30 minutes. Notable performances included Franz Ferdinand, M.I.A. (whose 2005 encore set in a tent was a first at the fest), Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and rare appearances from artists Leonard Cohen, Dr. Dog and Throbbing Gristle. The festival drew an aggregate attendance of 152,962 and grossed $15,328,863.

Organizers eliminated single-day ticket sales for 2010, and instead instituted a new policy offering three-day tickets only, which drew mixed reactions. Headliners included Jay-Z, Muse and Gorillaz, and reunions of Faith No More and Pavement. Despite Tollett&#x27;s reservations about holding a festival in 2010 due to the economy, Coachella drew 75,000 spectators each day that year, for an estimated aggregate attendance of 225,000, surpassing previous records. Thousands of fans broke through fences, leading to concerns about overcrowding. The festival grossed $21,703,500. International travel was disrupted by the eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland, resulting in some European acts, such as Frightened Rabbit, Gary Numan and Delphic, canceling their appearances at the festival.

Prior to the 2011 festival, Goldenvoice made several investments and improvements locally to help support Coachella. In addition to funding an additional lane for Avenue 50, which borders the festival, the promoter cleared additional space on the polo grounds by leveling a 250,000-square-foot area and moving horse stables. Lighting and security were also enhanced to help the festival run more smoothly. The headliners for that year&#x27;s event were Kings of Leon, Arcade Fire, Kanye West, and The Strokes, along with another 190 supporting acts. The 2011 festival grossed $24,993,698 from 75,000 paid attendees, for an aggregate attendance of 225,000 across the entire three-day weekend.

===2012–2014===
On May 31, 2011, Goldenvoice announced that beginning with the 2012 festival, Coachella would be expanded to a second, separately-ticketed weekend, with identical lineups for each. Explaining the decision, Tollett said that demand for tickets was up in 2011 even after &quot;operations weren&#x27;t the best [they&#x27;ve] ever had&quot; in 2010 and that he did not want to satisfy that demand by allowing additional attendees to overcrowd the venue. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it a &quot;very risky move&quot; and said there was &quot;no guarantee that demand [would be] high enough to sell out the same bill over two consecutive weekends&quot;. Nonetheless, 2012 tickets sold out in less than three hours.
The 2012 festival featured headliners the Black Keys, Radiohead, and a twin billing of Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. During the latter&#x27;s performances, a projection of deceased rapper Tupac Shakur appeared on-stage (a voice actor performed his introduction lines) and began performing &quot;Hail Mary&quot; and &quot;2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted&quot;. Although the media referred to the technology as a &quot;hologram&quot;, the projection was in fact created using the Musion Eyeliner system, which employs a version of Pepper&#x27;s ghost. Following the performance, the projection disappeared. Dr. Dre had asked permission from Shakur&#x27;s mother Afeni, who said the next day that she was thrilled with the performance. A projection of deceased singer Nate Dogg was also planned, but Dr. Dre decided against it. The 2012 festival grossed $47,313,403 from 158,387 paid attendees across the two weekends; 80,726 tickets were sold for the first weekend, and 77,661 for the second.
Prior to the 2013 festival, it was announced that Goldenvoice had reached a deal with the city of Indio to keep the Coachella and Stagecoach Festivals there through 2030. As part of the agreement, Indio&#x27;s per-ticket share of revenue would increase from $2.33 per ticket to $5.01. Headlining the 2013 festival were Blur, The Stone Roses, Phoenix, and Red Hot Chili Peppers. General admission tickets sold for $349, a $34 increase from the previous year. The festival grossed $67.2 million in ticket sales and was attended by 180,000 people, making it the top music festival in the world. In July 2013, Goldenvoice finalized a $30 million purchase of 280 acres of land surrounding the Empire Polo Club, including the 200-acre Eldorado Polo Club. The land, previously leased from Eldorado, will be used to provide more space for parking and general use for the festival. Tollett said the purchase was intended to &quot;help [Goldenvoice] put in some infrastructure so [they] don&#x27;t have to keep coming back and do the same things each year&quot;.

The 2014 festival, held on April 11–13 and April 18–20, featured 184 artists. A reunited Outkast headlined on Friday, Muse on Saturday, and Arcade Fire on Sunday. General admission tickets sold out in less than 20 minutes, while all other tickets (including VIP tickets in excess of $5,000) sold out in less than 3 hours. That year&#x27;s festival featured 96,500 daily attendees and grossed a record-breaking $78.332 million. For the fourth consecutive year, Coachella was named the Top Festival at the Billboard Touring Awards.

===2015–2017===

The 2015 festival, held on April 10–12 and 17–19, featured headliners AC/DC, Jack White, and Drake, with a surprise appearance by Madonna during the latter&#x27;s weekend one performance. General admission tickets again sold out in less than 20 minutes. The event established new records for tickets sold (198,000) and total gross ($84,264,264) for a festival. The festival won Pollstar&#x27;s award for Major Music Festival of the Year, marking the 10th time in 11 years that Coachella had won the award.

In March 2016, the Indio City Council passed a measure to raise the attendance cap for Coachella from 99,000 to 125,000, stipulating that the capacity would gradually be increased, giving the city time to accommodate the crowds. Goldenvoice increased the venue size by about 50 acres along Monroe Street, Avenue 50, Avenue 52, and Polo Road. The 2016 festival was held on April 15–17 and 22–24, and was headlined by a reunited LCD Soundsystem, a reunited Guns N&#x27; Roses (with original members Axl Rose, Slash, and Duff McKagan), and Calvin Harris. Ice Cube&#x27;s appearance featured a reunion of N.W.A., while Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; first weekend performance featured a guest appearance from Angus Young of AC/DC, who headlined the previous year; the cameo occurred the same day that Rose was announced as the new singer for AC/DC. Weekend two was marked by several tributes to Prince, the 2008 headliner who died just prior to the weekend&#x27;s shows. The festival sold 198,000 tickets and grossed $94.2 million.

In January 2017, reports circulated that AEG owner Philip Anschutz had donated to many right-wing causes, including organizations promoting LGBTQ discrimination and climate change denial. The news led to calls for fans to boycott the festival. Anschutz decried the controversy as &quot;fake news&quot;, saying he would never knowingly contribute to an anti-LGBTQ organization and would cease donations to any such group of which he became aware.

The 2017 edition of Coachella took place from April 14–16 and April 21–23, and featured Radiohead, Lady Gaga, and Kendrick Lamar as headlining artists. Beyoncé was originally announced as a headliner but was forced to withdraw at the advice of her doctors after she became pregnant; she announced that she would instead headline the 2018 festival. Tickets sold out within a few hours of going on sale. The event saw the debut of the new daytime-only Sonora tent. The 2017 festival drew 250,000 attendees and grossed $114.6 million, marking the first time a recurring festival grossed over $100 million. Between the two weekends of Coachella, scenes for the film &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;, starring Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, were filmed on the festival grounds.

===2018–2019===

The 2018 festival featured headlining performances from the Weeknd, Beyoncé, and Eminem. Making up for her cancellation the previous year, Beyoncé became the first African-American woman to headline the festival. Her performances paid tribute to the culture of historically Black colleges and universities, featuring a full marching band and majorette dancers, while incorporating various aspects of Black Greek life, such as a step show along with strolling by pledges. The performances were also influenced by Black feminism, sampling Black authors and featuring on-stage appearances by fellow Destiny&#x27;s Child members Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams as well as sister Solange Knowles. Beyoncé&#x27;s performances received immediate, widespread praise, and were described by many media outlets as historic. &quot;The New York Times&quot; music critic Jon Caramanica wrote, &quot;There&#x27;s not likely to be a more meaningful, absorbing, forceful and radical performance by an American musician this year, or any year soon, than Beyoncé&#x27;s headlining set&quot;. Her performance garnered 458,000 simultaneous viewers on YouTube to become the festival&#x27;s most viewed performance to date, and the entire festival had 41 million total viewers, making it the most livestreamed event ever.

A report in &quot;Teen Vogue&quot; described &quot;rampant&quot; sexual harassment and assault at the 2018 festival, and the author said she was groped 22 times in 10 hours. In response, Goldenvoice announced a new initiative in January 2019 called &quot;Every One&quot;, which comprises &quot;fan resources and policies&quot; to combat sexual misconduct and improve the festival&#x27;s responses to such behavior. &quot;Safety ambassadors&quot; were made available to direct attendees to professional counselors, and specially marked locations were added for attendees to seek services or report incidents of sexual misconduct. One of the program&#x27;s goals stated, &quot;We are taking deliberate steps to develop a festival culture that is safe and inclusive for everyone&quot;.

Coachella celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2019. Taking place from April 12–14 and 19–21, the festival was headlined by Childish Gambino, Tame Impala, and Ariana Grande. At 25 years old, Grande became the youngest artist to headline the festival and just its fourth female headliner. The festival was beset with several challenges. Justin Timberlake was reportedly slated to headline but had to cancel after bruising his vocal cords. Goldenvoice was also forced to abandon plans for Kanye West to headline, as they could not accommodate his request to build a giant dome for his performance in the middle of the festival grounds. West was instead allowed to hold the first public &quot;Sunday Service&quot; performance on Easter on April 21 at the venue&#x27;s campgrounds. West and a gospel choir performed an approximately 33-song set list of his songs as well as classic R&amp;B and gospel covers. The first weekend of the festival suffered audio technical difficulties with several high-profile performances. The following weekend, &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; published a report of the alleged &quot;inhumane treatment&quot; of the festival&#x27;s security guards. The workers cited poor tent conditions, insufficient food and water, long hours in the harsh sun, minimum wages, and poor communication and coordination between the organizers and the subcontracting security firms.

=== 2020–present ===
The 2020 festival was originally scheduled to take place on April 10–12 and April 17–19 with Rage Against the Machine, Travis Scott, and Frank Ocean as the headlining acts. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the festival was initially postponed until October 9–11 and October 16–18, but in June, Riverside County public health officers announced it and Stagecoach had been cancelled altogether due to a ban on public gatherings, as well as lockdowns and travel restrictions. On April 10, a documentary profiling the festival&#x27;s 20-year history, &quot;Coachella: 20 Years in the Desert&quot;, was released on YouTube to coincide with the original start date of the 2020 event. The 2021 festival was also cancelled as a result of pandemic restrictions in California and the threats of the COVID-19 variants.

Coachella returned in 2022 on April 15–17 and April 22–24. The headlining lineup initially comprised Harry Styles, Billie Eilish, Kanye West, and Swedish House Mafia. Less than two weeks before the festival, West withdrew. The vacancy in the Sunday night headliner slot was filled by Swedish House Mafia – who previously had not been scheduled for a specific day – for a joint performance with the Weeknd. While not advertised as a headlining act, Arcade Fire was added to the official 2022 schedule on April 14, a day before the festival&#x27;s first weekend.
The 2023 edition of Coachella, which took place from April 14–16 and April 21–23, was also beset with last-minute lineup changes. The originally announced headliners were Bad Bunny, Blackpink, and Frank Ocean; the former two were Coachella&#x27;s first Latin and Asian headliners, respectively. In the days leading up to the first weekend, Ocean suffered leg injuries from an alleged bicycle accident on the festival grounds. The production for his performance was then scaled down extensively; plans to utilize an ice rink with over 100 skaters were scrapped at the last minute, forcing festival crew to hurriedly melt the ice surface. Ocean began his performance an hour late, and after exceeding the festival curfew by 25 minutes, he abruptly ended his show. He subsequently withdrew from the second weekend, citing recommendations from his doctor. Blink-182, which reunited its classic lineup and had been added to the festival two days before it began, was promoted to fill the second weekend&#x27;s headlining vacancy on Sunday night. After they performed, the trio of DJs Skrillex, Four Tet, and Fred Again – all of whom were added to the lineup the day before the second weekend began – concluded the festival. According to reports, Goldenvoice will incur more than $4 million in losses from the production costs associated with Ocean&#x27;s unused ice rink, more than his booking fee for the performance. The promoters were also fined $133,000 for curfew violations from the opening weekend.

In 2024, it took nearly a month for the first weekend of Coachella to sell out, whereas it normally sells out within a week.

The movie The Idea of You released in spring of 2024 prominently features Coachella.

==Location and festival grounds==
Coachella takes place in Indio, California, located in the Inland Empire region&#x27;s Coachella Valley within the Colorado Desert. Temperatures during the festival&#x27;s history have ranged from on April 14, 2012, to on April 21, 2012. The festival is hosted at the 78-acre Empire Polo Club; when accounting for land used for parking and camping, the event covers a footprint of approximately 642 acres. The site is about 125 miles (200 km) east of Los Angeles.

During the festival, several stages continuously host live music. Two outdoor stages are used, along with several tents named after deserts. The primary stages that have been in use since Coachella&#x27;s inception are:
* Coachella Stage – the main stage that draws the largest crowds. This outdoor stage is where the headlining acts perform.
* Outdoor Theatre – a smaller outdoor stage adjacent to the Coachella Stage
* Mojave – a mid-size tent named after the Mojave Desert that hosts acts across multiple genres and varying stages of development. In 2017, it was moved behind an access road. A year later, it received further changes, as it was enlarged and moved again, this time to the Sahara&#x27;s previous spot near the rose garden.
* Gobi – a mid-size tent named after the Gobi Desert that hosts acts across multiple genres and varying stages of development. Like the Mojave, it was moved behind an access road in 2017.
* Sahara – a large, hangar-like tent named after the Sahara Desert. It generally hosts the top electronic dance music acts. In 2013, the tent was expanded in size, reaching a height of 80 feet. Further changes were made in 2018, as it was built 25 percent larger and relocated west from the row of tents near the Empire Polo Club&#x27;s rose garden to a spot on the Eldorado Polo Club near the festival entrance. The new location offers more shade and alleviates issues with foot traffic. The stage was also moved from one of the open ends of the structure to one of its sides, allowing a wider field of view to attendees.

Additional performance areas have been added over time, including:
* Yuma – a small indoor tent introduced in 2013 that primarily hosts emerging DJs. The tent was intended to be &quot;a sophisticated space that dials down the noise and strobe lights in favor of thoughtful sounds and underground acts&quot;.
* Sonora – a small indoor tent introduced in 2017 to host punk rock and Latin acts 
* Heineken House – a small venue introduced in 2014. It was dedicated to &quot;legendary musical performances&quot; and &quot;live mash-ups from a wide array of musical artists&quot;. Originally designed as a walled structure to provide a club-like atmosphere, it was redesigned in 2019 to feature an open beer garden layout with a slanted roof, eliminating the long waiting lines and giving more visibility to attendees.
* Despacio – a small indoor tent used in 2016. Co-created by James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem, the venue played &quot;slow-simmering disco and vintage club music&quot; on vinyl with the intention of creating a joyful setting. It featured a 50,000 watt sound system and air conditioning.
* Antarctic – an indoor dome introduced in 2017 to screen 360-degree immersive videos. The structure is 120 feet in diameter, features 11,000 square feet in projection space and air conditioning, and can seat 500 people. Obscura Digital produced the film shown in 2017.
* Oasis Dome – Used in 2006 and 2011
* Quasar – An outdoor stage introduced in 2024 for long format DJ sets.

==Art==

In addition to hosting live music, Coachella is a showcase for visual arts, including installation art and sculpture. Many of the pieces are interactive, providing a visual treat for attendees. Throughout the years, the art has grown in scale and outrageousness. Paul Clemente, Coachella&#x27;s art director since 2009, said, &quot;I think the level of detail and finish and artistry and scale and complexity and technology, everything is constantly getting notched up, ratcheted up. We&#x27;re obviously constantly trying to, for lack of a better word, (to) outdo ourselves and make it better for the fans.&quot;

In Coachella&#x27;s early years, art was mostly recycled from the previous year&#x27;s Burning Man festival, due to smaller budgets. Between 2010 and 2015, Goldenvoice shifted its focus from renting pieces to commissioning them specifically for the festival, increasing their budget. Artists are given access to the grounds just 10 days before the festival, giving them a tight timeframe in which to assemble their pieces. Due to the high cost of re-assembly, only about half of them appear again outside of Coachella. Describing the festival&#x27;s importance to art, Cynthia Washburn of art collective Poetic Kinetics said, &quot;With all the exposure here, I think Coachella is becoming as attractive for artists as it is for the musicians.&quot; In 2013, Clemente considered about 300 art proposals, the most in the festival&#x27;s history for the time. Poetic Kinetics has designed several giant moving art installations for past Coachella festivals, including a snail in 2013 (&quot;Helix Poeticus&quot;), an astronaut in 2014 (&quot;Escape Velocity&quot;), and a caterpillar that &quot;metamorphosized&quot; into a butterfly in 2015 (&quot;Papilio Merraculous&quot;). The collective reprised the astronaut for the 2019 festival (&quot;Overview Effect&quot;), with weathering affects applied to the design.

Some of the works have been featured at Art Basel, and involved participants from architecture schools, both local and international. A few of the visual artists, such as Hotshot the Robot, Robochrist Industries, the Tesla Coil (Cauac), Cyclecide, and The Do LaB, alongside avant-garde performance troupe Lucent Dossier Experience, have appeared for several consecutive years. Poster artist Emek has produced limited edition posters every year since 2007.

==Organization==
As the host city to Coachella and the Stagecoach Festival, Indio provides several services such as police and fire protection, private security, medical services, outside law enforcement, and city staff services. These services for the three weekends of festivals totaled $2.77 million in 2012. All public safety needs are coordinated by Indio&#x27;s police department, requiring them to liaise with nearly 12 agencies, including police departments from nearby cities, the sheriff&#x27;s department, California Highway Patrol, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, American Medical Response, and the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control. To avoid disturbing local residents, a curfew for music performances is enforced; since 2010, it has been 1 a.m. on Friday and Saturday nights, an hour later than the previous curfew, and midnight on Sunday nights. Per a 2013 agreement with the City of Indio, Goldenvoice must pay a fine of $20,000 if it exceeds the curfew by five minutes, plus $1,000 for each additional minute beyond that. The fines benefit the city&#x27;s General Fund, which covers operating costs, public work services, and the police and fire departments.

===Environmental sustainability===

Organizers of Coachella manage its carbon footprint by partnering with the organization Global Inheritance to promote several environmentally friendly initiatives. Global Inheritance&#x27;s original project was its &quot;TRASHed :: Art of Recycling&quot; campaign, which challenges local artists to design and decorate recycling bins that are placed across the festival grounds. Another program is &quot;Carpoolchella&quot;; launched in 2007, it rewards festivalgoers who carpool in groups of four or more and display the word &quot;Carpoolchella&quot; on their cars by entering them in a drawing to win VIP tickets for life. Through the 2014 festival, the program had 140,000 participants and more than 70 winners of lifetime festival passes. In 2007, Coachella teamed up with Global Inheritance to start a 10-for-1 recycling program, in which anyone who collects ten empty water bottles receives a free full one. In 2009, the festival introduced $10 refillable water bottles, which purchasers could refill at water stations inside the festival and within the campgrounds. Other programs used at the festival include solar powered DJ booths and seesaws used to charge mobile phones.

About 600 staffers are required to collect the litter that accumulates during the festival. Resources are sorted individually on site before being taken to local landfills and recycling centers. Goldenvoice maintains a goal to &quot;divert 90 percent of [its] recyclable and compostable materials&quot;. In 2013, staff diverted over 577,720,000 pounds of materials, comprising 36,860 tons of aluminum cans, 105,000 tons of cardboard, 65,360 tons of PET plastic, 47,040 tons of scrap metal, and 34,600 tons of glass.

===Camping===
In 2003, Coachella began allowing tent camping as an option for festival lodging. The campground site is on a polo field adjacent to the venue grounds and has its own entrance on the south side of the venue. 2010 introduced many new features, such as re-entry from the campsite to the festival grounds, parking next to your tent, and recreational vehicle camping spots (recreational vehicle camping was offered one year only). For that festival, there were more than 17,000 campers. At the 2012 event, on-site facilities included recycling, a general store, showers, mobile phone charging stations and an internet cafe with free WiFi.

==Talent booking==
Tollett begins to book artists for each festival as early as the previous August. In addition to agent pitches and artists discovered online, the lineup is culled from acts booked by Goldenvoice for their other 1,800 shows each year. Tollett uses the promoter&#x27;s ticketing figures for insight into whom to book, saying: &quot;There are AEG shows all across the country, and I see all their show lists and ticket counts. So I see little things that are happening maybe before some others, because they don&#x27;t have that data.&quot; The booking process takes approximately six months.
According to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, booking fees for most artists playing the festival allegedly start at $15,000 and extend into the &quot;high six figures.&quot; Top-billed artists for 2010 were expected to receive over $1 million. &quot;Billboard&quot;″s sources estimated that non-headline acts can earn anywhere from $500 to $100,000. According to a 2017 profile on Tollett in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, that year&#x27;s headlining performers received $3–4 million. Beyoncé&#x27;s 2018 performances and Ariana Grande&#x27;s 2019 performances reportedly garnered them each $8 million.

In booking the festival, Goldenvoice uses radius clauses that can prevent acts from performing in the vicinity of Coachella for a certain amount of time before and after the festival. The promoter has allowed some of Coachella&#x27;s acts to make appearances in the region prior to the festival and between weekends, but only at events and venues owned or controlled by Goldenvoice&#x27;s parent company AEG; one such example was Jay-Z&#x27;s concert at Staples Center in 2010. Goldenvoice now promotes these events, dubbed &quot;Localchella&quot;, as a series of small warm-up shows for Coachella in Southern California. In May 2018, AEG and its subsidiaries were sued by the Oregon-based Soul&#x27;D Out Festival for anti-competitive practices related to Coachella&#x27;s radius clause. As part of the lawsuit, the clause&#x27;s details were revealed. They stipulate that any artist performing at Coachella:
* Cannot perform at any other North American festival from December 15 to May 1.
* Cannot play any hard ticket shows in Southern California from December 15 to May 1.
* Cannot &quot;advertise, publicize or leak&quot; performances for competing festivals in California, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, or Arizona, or headlining performances in Southern California taking place after May 1 until after May 7.
* Cannot announce festival appearances for the other 45 US states until after the January announcement of Coachella&#x27;s lineup, except for South by Southwest, Ultra Music Festival, and the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival.
* Cannot publicize concerts in California, Arizona, Washington, or Oregon until after the January announcement of Coachella&#x27;s lineup, except for performances in Las Vegas casinos.

Goldenvoice attempts to release the lineup poster as close to New Year&#x27;s Day as possible, so that Coachella is the first major festival of the year to announce its lineup. This gives the promoter a competitive advantage over other festivals, many of which end up sharing headliners by the time they are all announced. The Coachella lineup poster lists its music artists across several lines in gradually decreasing font sizes in descending order of prominence. The line on which an artist&#x27;s name appears as well as their font size is a contentious topic between Goldenvoice and talent agents, as placement on the poster will often dictate an artist&#x27;s future booking fee. Tollett said, &quot;We have so many arguments over font sizes. I literally have over one point size.&quot;

==Promotion and commercial partnerships==
Organizers were initially resistant to accepting sponsorship deals that would help Coachella turn a higher profit. In 2003, Tollett estimated that Goldenvoice could earn an additional $300,000 to $500,000 by adding a corporate sponsor to the festival name, but he did not want to violate the purity of the event. He said, &quot;I hate it when you go to shows and you are bombarded with all this advertising. It just shows a lack of respect for your audience and the music.&quot; Organizers have relaxed their opposition over the years. Brewing company Heineken N.V. has maintained a sponsorship with Coachella since 2002, and is the &quot;official brew&quot; of the festival. The company has sponsored a small performance venue at the festival called the &quot;Heineken House&quot; since 2014, where attendees can drink Heineken beers and keep their cases of Heineken refrigerated. Clothing retailer H&amp;M added a small sponsored tent on the festival grounds in 2015, where attendees could purchase items from the company&#x27;s Coachella-inspired clothing line called &quot;H&amp;M Loves Coachella&quot;. Information technology company HP has sponsored the Antarctic dome since 2017, in addition to hosting a promotional tent. HP&#x27;s promotions included allowing attendees to design and print bandanas and tote bags, capture light drawing GIFs, design kaleidoscopes, and interact with a motion-reactive wall. Tollett still objects to having the primary stages and tents sponsored: &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t let sponsors&#x27; logos on the stages. I feel like when the band is playing it should be you and the band, and it&#x27;s a sacred moment.&quot;

Since 2011, YouTube has live streamed performances from Coachella. Initially, the first weekend was streamed across three separate channels. In 2014, AXS TV began broadcasting the second weekend on television; over 20 hours of live performances from the 2015 festival were broadcast on AXS TV. Performances from the 2015 festival were also broadcast live on Sirius XM satellite radio for the first time. In 2019, YouTube expanded its content for the festival livestream, which included a stream of both weekends of the festival for the first time. Weekend one included a premiere of Donald Glover&#x27;s film &quot;Guava Island&quot;, while weekend two featured &quot;Coachella Curated&quot;, programming hosted by radio personality Jason Bentley that took &quot;a deep dive into the festival experience&quot; by offering &quot;encore and live performances, artist commentary, mini-docs, animated adventures and more&quot;. &quot;Coachella Curated&quot; was reprised for the 2022 festival&#x27;s second weekend. In 2023, Coachella&#x27;s streaming agreement with YouTube was renewed through 2026, and for the first time, performances from all six stages were streamed, covering both weekends.

For 2016, organizers partnered with Vantage.tv to offer virtual reality (VR) content for the festival. Ticket holders received a cardboard VR viewer inspired by Google Cardboard in their Coachella welcome package that could be used with the Coachella VR mobile app (which was released on Android, iOS, and Samsung Gear VR). Content included 360-degree panoramic photos of previous events, virtual tours of the 2016 festival site, interviews, and performances. That same year, YouTube live streamed performances from weekend two in 360 degrees for viewing with VR headsets.

The success of Coachella has led its organizers to partner with other American music festivals. In 2003, Goldenvoice agreed to work with the organizers of Field Day, a New York-based festival modeled after Coachella, to help promote and produce the event, although the show was completely overhauled from its original vision. In September 2014, Goldenvoice announced it had entered into a joint venture with Red Frog Events to help them promote and produce their Firefly Music Festival. In January 2015, a similar agreement was reached with the organizers of the Hangout Music Festival.

Goldenvoice claimed it spent $700,000 in 2015 on &quot;media and related content to promote Coachella&quot;.

===Brand protection===
Goldenvoice has actively protected the Coachella brand. As of April 2018, they filed six lawsuits in the previous two years against outlets that attempted to use the Coachella name or the suffix &quot;chella&quot;. The defendants included the music festival Hoodchella; the film festival Filmchella; energy company Phillips 66, which promoted a Coachella wristband giveaway that the festival&#x27;s terms of services disallows; Sean Combs&#x27;s event &quot;Combschella&quot;; Urban Outfitters; and a Whole Foods location in Palm Desert that promoted a &quot;Wholechella&quot; concert and tasting event. Another lawsuit was filed in September 2021 against radio presenter RaaShaun Casey (also known as DJ Envy) for his hip hop and auto show &quot;Carchella&quot;, which he agreed to rename to &quot;DJ Envy&#x27;s Drive Your Dreams Car Show&quot;. According to Goldenvoice&#x27;s attorneys in one lawsuit, the litigation is one way the promoter attempts to &quot;extensively police unauthorized use of the Coachella Marks&quot;. Although the Coachella name has been in use by a town in the Coachella Valley since before the festival was founded, the festival&#x27;s success has imbued the name with &quot;secondary meaning&quot;, allowing Goldenvoice to trademark it.

In December 2021, Coachella won a restraining order against Live Nation&#x27;s Coachella Day One 22 festival. A judge ruled that Live Nation is likely infringing trademarks by selling tickets to the event nearby.

==Impact and legacy==

According to a 2015 ranking by online ticket retailer Viagogo, Coachella was the second-most in-demand concert ticket, trailing only the Tomorrowland festival.

Coachella is considered a trendsetter in music and fashion. Singer Katy Perry said, &quot;The lineup always introduces the best of the year for the rest of the year.&quot;

Coachella has become known for the variety of distinctive apparel worn by attendees, which primarily include eclectic combinations of colors, materials, and ethnic borrowings. Some activists and journalists have criticized the latter as being cultural appropriation, particularly non-natives wearing Native American-inspired headdresses and body paint.

According to a 2012 economic impact study, Coachella brought $254.4 million to the desert region that year; of that total, Indio received $89.2 million in consumer spending and $1.4 million in tax revenue. Goldenvoice&#x27;s other festival at the Empire Polo Club, Stagecoach, has been called a &quot;cousin&quot; of Coachella, but it has grown at a faster pace, eventually selling out for the first time in 2012 with 55,000 attendees. Together, the two festivals were estimated by experts to have a global impact of $704.75 million in 2016; approximately $403.2 million of that was expected to impact the Coachella Valley, $106 million of which would go to businesses in Indio. The city was expected to gain $3.18 million in ticket taxes from the two festivals in 2016.

The success of Coachella led to Goldenvoice holding additional music festivals at the Empire Polo Club. It founded the country music festival Stagecoach in 2007 and continues to hold it on an annual basis. In 2011, the promoter staged the Big 4 festival, so-named for its quadruple billing of the most prominent bands in thrash metal—Anthrax, Megadeth, Metallica, and Slayer. In 2016, Goldenvoice staged Desert Trip, which featured older rock oriented and legacy acts such as the Rolling Stones, Paul McCartney, and Bob Dylan.

<doc id="494631" wikidata="Q1409587" url="?curid=494631" title="Uchi-deshi">
<text>is a Japanese term for a live-in student/apprentice who trains under and assists a sensei on a full-time basis. The system exists in 
&quot;kabuki&quot;, &quot;rakugo&quot;, &quot;shogi&quot;, &quot;igo&quot;, &quot;aikido&quot;, &quot;sumo&quot;, &quot;karate&quot; and other modern Japanese martial arts.

==Lifestyle==
&quot;Uchi-deshi&quot; usually live in the dōjō or the home of the teacher, or in separate accommodations near the dōjō. The deshi serves the teacher all day, every day. Duties may include cleaning and secretarial work. In contrast to &quot;uchi-deshi&quot;, students who live outside are referred to as . Some dojo have uchideshi rooms right in the dojo.

Historically, an &quot;uchi-deshi&quot; was typically chosen and groomed to become the next head of a school of martial arts when a direct family member was not available. Nowadays, the term is used synonymously as an apprenticeship.

==Related terms==
In modern times, the role is also referred to as . Other terms include and , although these terms are more general and do not necessarily indicate a live-in apprentice. &quot;Senshūsei&quot; and &quot;kenshūsei&quot; often refer to set training programs or goal-oriented training rather than students who have a special relationship with a teacher. For example, &quot;kenshūsei&quot; of the Kodokan dojo began training for Olympic Judo competition in 1960. The term &quot;renshū-sei&quot; (練習生) is used in Japanese pro wrestling. The term &quot;jikideshi&quot; translates to &quot;personal pupil&quot; and is a term used for students who show dedication and commitment to their master and/or school.

<doc id="494640" wikidata="Q815376" url="?curid=494640" title="The Frogs">
<text>The Frogs (; , often abbreviated &quot;Ran.&quot; or &quot;Ra.&quot;) is a comedy written by the Ancient Greek playwright Aristophanes. It was performed at the Lenaia, one of the Festivals of Dionysus in Athens, in 405 BC and received first place.

The play features the comical katabasis of the god of theater Dionysus, with his slave Xanthias, in order to revive the late tragedian Euripides. Dionysus is frustrated with tragedy&#x27;s decline in quality after the playwright&#x27;s recent passing, and concerned about theatre&#x27;s future as the city of Athens struggles in the Peloponnesian War. During the pair&#x27;s journey through the underworld, the god cravenly and unsuccessfully attempts to evade trouble after masquerading as Heracles, still infamous for his prior kidnapping of the guard-dog Cerberus. At the palace of Pluto, Dionysus then adjudicates a fierce debate between Euripides and Aeschylus for the underworld&#x27;s throne of tragic drama. Aeschylus wins due to his pragmatism, and Dionysus ends up reviving him instead. The play&#x27;s title derives from the first choral interlude (parodos), where the chorus, a group of frogs, exasperate Dionysus in song.

A defining work of Old Comedy, &quot;The Frogs&quot; contains a mix of irreverent humor and highbrow satire of Athenian politics, religion and theatre, commenting on poetry&#x27;s moral role in civic and political life. The play is notably characterised by its extensive literary criticism and references: the second half&#x27;s agon between Euripides and Aeschylus examines both figures&#x27; differing approaches to tragedy. In 1974, the play was loosely adapted into a musical of the same name by Stephen Sondheim and Burt Shevelove. This adaptation features the English playwrights George Bernard Shaw and William Shakespeare, in place of Euripides and Aeschylus respectively.

==Plot==
Dionysus is travelling with his slave Xanthias to the underworld. Xanthias, carrying Dionysus&#x27; baggage, attempts to make fun of his heavy load with toilet humour - the jokes he believes the audiences are expecting from this situation - but the god frustratedly pre-empts his remarks. To find a reliable path to Hades, Dionysus seeks advice from his half-brother Heracles, who had been there before in order to retrieve the hell hound Cerberus. Dionysus shows up at his doorstep dressed in a lion-hide and carrying a club. Heracles, upon seeing the effeminate Dionysus dressed up like himself, can&#x27;t help laughing. Dionysus explains his motivation for travelling to Hades: to bring the playwright Euripides back from the dead, in order to correct what he sees as the sorry state of Athens&#x27; tragedians. When Dionysus asks which road is the quickest to get to Hades, Heracles tells him that he can hang himself, drink poison or jump off a tower. Dionysus opts for the longer journey, which Heracles himself had taken, across a lake (possibly Lake Acheron).

When Dionysus arrives at the lake, Charon ferries him across. Xanthias, being a slave, is not allowed in the boat, and has to walk around it, while Dionysus is made to help row the boat. The eponymous chorus of frogs (the only instance of frogs in the play) sing the parodos, the first choral interlude. Their croaking refrain – (Greek: ) – greatly annoys Dionysus, who engages in a mocking debate (agon) with the frogs. When he arrives at the shore, Dionysus meets up with Xanthias, who teases him by claiming to see the frightening monster Empusa. A second chorus composed of spirits of Dionysian Mystics soon appear.

The next encounter is with Hades&#x27; janitor, who mistakes Dionysus for Heracles due to his attire. Still angry over Heracles&#x27; theft of Cerberus, he threatens to unleash several monsters on him in revenge. Frightened, Dionysus trades clothes with Xanthias. A maid then arrives and is happy to see Heracles. She invites him to a feast with virgin dancing girls, and Xanthias is more than happy to oblige, but Dionysus quickly wants to trade back the clothes. Dionysus, back in the Heracles lion-skin, encounters more people angry at Heracles, and so he makes Xanthias trade a third time. When the janitor returns to confront the alleged Heracles, Xanthias offers him his &quot;slave&quot; (Dionysus) for torturing, to obtain the truth as to whether or not he is really a thief. The terrified Dionysus tells the truth that he is a god. After each is whipped, the janitor admits he is unable to tell which one is a god, and takes Dionysus to be verified offstage by Pluto and Persephone. In the parabasis, the chorus comments on the political state of Athens, criticizing its inconsistency with granting citizenships, and its lack of meritocracy.

Working in Pluto&#x27;s palace, Xanthias and another slave delight in mocking their own masters: the latter explains the ongoing contest between Euripides and Aeschylus. Euripides, who had only just recently died, is challenging the great Aeschylus for the seat of &quot;Best Tragic Poet&quot; at the dinner table of Pluto, the ruler of the underworld. (It is explained that Sophocles has foregone participation in the contest, due to his deferentiality towards Aeschylus.) A contest is held with Dionysus as judge. The two playwrights take turns quoting verses from their plays and making fun of the other. Euripides argues the characters in his plays are better because they are more true to life and logical, whereas Aeschylus believes his idealized characters are better as they are heroic and models for virtue. Aeschylus mocks Euripides&#x27; verse as predictable and formulaic by having Euripides quote lines from many of his prologues, each time interrupting the declamation with the same phrase &quot;&quot; (&quot;... lost his little flask of oil&quot;). (The passage has given rise to the term &quot;lekythion&quot; for this type of rhythmic group in poetry.) Euripides counters by demonstrating the alleged monotony of Aeschylus&#x27; choral songs, parodying excerpts from his works and having each citation end in the same refrain (&quot;oh, what a stroke, won&#x27;t you come to the rescue?&quot;, from Aeschylus&#x27; lost play &quot;Myrmidons&quot;). Aeschylus retorts by mocking Euripides&#x27; choral meters and lyric monodies with castanets.

In a first attempt to end the debate, a balance is brought in and each are told to tell a few lines into it. Whoever&#x27;s lines have the most &quot;weight&quot; will cause the balance to tip in their favor. Euripides produces verses of his that mention, in turn, the ship &quot;Argo&quot;, Persuasion and a mace. Aeschylus responds with the river Spercheios, Death and two crashed chariots, each with a dead charioteer. Since the latter verses refer to &quot;heavier&quot; objects, Aeschylus wins, but Dionysus is still unable to decide whom he will revive, so he reveals the intent of his visit: to save the city of Athens, currently at the losing end of the Peloponnesian War, and its dramatic scene by extension. He decides to take the poet who gives the best political advice: firstly, what the Athenians should do with the exiled Alcibiades, and secondly, how each of the poets thinks the city can be saved. Euripides gives cleverly worded but essentially meaningless answers while Aeschylus provides more practical advice, and Dionysus decides to take Aeschylus back instead of Euripides. Pluto allows Aeschylus to return to life so that Athens may be succoured in her hour of need and invites everyone to a round of farewell drinks. Before leaving, Aeschylus proclaims that Sophocles should have his chair while he is gone, not Euripides.

==Critical analysis==
The parodos contains a paradigmatic example of how in Greek culture obscenity could be included in celebrations related to the gods.

===Historical context===
&quot;The Frogs&quot; was written and performed during the final stages of the Peloponnesian War. Sophocles and Euripides, two Greek playwrights regarded as some of the most talented poets of their time, had recently died. During the creation of the narrative, Sparta and its allies had blockaded Athens and within six months after the production of &quot;The Frogs&quot;, Athens was defeated in a battle at sea, surrendering to Sparta.

===Politics===
Kenneth Dover claims that the underlying political theme of &quot;The Frogs&quot; is essentially &quot;old ways good, new ways bad&quot;. He points to the parabasis for proof of this: &quot;The antepirrhema of the parabasis (718–37) urges the citizen-body to reject the leadership of those whom it now follows, upstarts of foreign parentage (730–2), and turn back to men of known integrity who were brought up in the style of noble and wealthy families&quot; (Dover 33). Kleophon is mentioned in the ode of the parabasis (674–85), and is both &quot;vilified as a foreigner&quot; (680–2) and maligned at the end of the play (1504, 1532).

W. Geoffrey Arnott argues that &quot;The Frogs&quot; is used as a tactic to educate and advise the public. There are many passages within the play that paint poets and playwrights as educators and teachers. There is a particular section in which the character “Aeschylus” claims that after he produced his play “Persians”, he educated Athenian audiences to be resilient in vanquishing their enemies. The theme of poets functioning as advisors within The Frogs is driven by the play&#x27;s three main characters: Aeschylus, Euripides, and Dionysus.

Aristophanes himself acts as an educator and advisor regarding political issues through his writing. This is most prevalent during the Parabasis in which the chorus pleads to the audience for the return of exiled oligarchs who had been cast out during the Athenian democracy in 410. This parabasis has been credited as one of the biggest reasons for &quot;The Frogs&quot;&#x27; success at the Lenaea of 405. Its 1st place victory at Lanaea may have assisted in the development of a political environment that held more favor towards those exiled. In 405 those exiled, although not ordered to, were granted the ability to return to Athens and re-collect their citizenship rights under a set of conditions preserved in Andocides’ speech “On the Mysteries”.

&quot;The Frogs&quot; deviates from the pattern of political standpoint offered in Aristophanes&#x27; earlier works, such as &quot;The Acharnians&quot; (425 BC), &quot;Peace&quot; (421 BC), and &quot;Lysistrata&quot; (411 BC), which have all been termed &#x27;peace&#x27; plays. &quot;The Frogs&quot; is not often thus labeled, however – Dover points out that though Kleophon was adamantly opposed to any peace which did not come of victory, and the last lines of the play suggest Athens ought to look for a less stubborn end to the war, Aeschylus&#x27; advice (1463–5) lays out a plan to win and not a proposition of capitulation. Also, &quot;The Frogs&quot; contains solid, serious messages which represent significant differences from general critiques of policy and idealistic thoughts of good peace terms. During the parabasis Aristophanes presents advice to give the rights of citizens back to people who had participated in the oligarchic revolution in 411 BC, arguing they were misled by Phrynichus&#x27; &#x27;tricks&#x27; (literally &#x27;wrestlings&#x27;). Phrynichus was a leader of the oligarchic revolution who was assassinated, to general satisfaction, in 411. This proposal was simple enough to be instated by a single act of the assembly, and was actually put into effect by Patrokleides&#x27; decree after the loss of the fleet at Aegospotami. The anonymous &quot;Life&quot; states that this advice was the basis of Aristophanes&#x27; receipt of the olive wreath, and the author of the ancient Hypothesis says admiration of the parabasis was the major factor that led to the play&#x27;s second production.

&quot;The Frogs&quot;&#x27; influence on political issues at the time of its performance are clear. This can be used as an example to support Aristotle’s claims about society and political participation:“Hence it is evident that the state is a creation of nature, and that man is by nature a political animal. And he who by nature and not by mere accident is without a state, is either a bad man or above humanity; he is like the: Tribeless, lawless, hearthless one,’ whom Homer denounces—the natural outcast is forthwith a lover of war; he may be compared to an isolated piece at draughts.” - Aristotle, Politics 1.2Here Aristotle is arguing that it is in human nature to be involved in politics and being uninvolved is a negative trait. &quot;The Frogs&quot; can be examined through this lens, relating its emphasis on the political change to the attitudes sustained in Athens regarding education and civil duty. Aristotle further claims that theatre is used to comment on societal issues, and present solutions through their demonstration and the use of realism in theatre :“...supposing the charge is &quot;That is not true,&quot; one can meet it by saying &quot;But perhaps it ought to be,&quot; just as Sophocles said that he portrayed people as they ought to be and Euripides portrayed them as they are...” - Aristotle, Poetics 1460bJ.T. Sheppard contends that the exiled general Alcibiades is a main focus of &quot;The Frogs&quot;. At the time the play was written and produced, Athens was in dire straits in the war with the Peloponnesian League, and the people, Sheppard claims, would logically have Alcibiades on their minds. Sheppard quotes a segment of text from near the beginning of the parabasis:&quot;But remember these men also, your own kinsmen, sire and son,

Who have oftimes fought beside you, spilt their blood on many seas;

Grant for that one fault the pardon which they crave you on their knees.

You whom nature made for wisdom, let your vengeance fall to sleep;

Greet as kinsmen and Athenians, burghers true to win and keep,

Whosoe&#x27;er will brave the storms and fight for Athens at your side!&quot;

— Murray translation, from l. 697He states that though this text ostensibly refers to citizens dispossessed of their rights, it will actually evoke memories of Alcibiades, the Athenians&#x27; exiled hero. Further support includes the presentation of the chorus, who recites these lines, as initiates of the mysteries. This, Sheppard says, will also prompt recollection of Alcibiades, whose initial exile was largely based on impiety regarding these religious institutions. Continuing this thought, the audience is provoked into remembering Alcibiades&#x27; return in 408 BC, when he made his peace with the goddesses. The reason Aristophanes hints so subtly at these points, according to Sheppard, is because Alcibiades still had many rivals in Athens, such as Kleophon and Adeimantus, who are both blasted in the play. Sheppard also cites Aeschylus during the prologue debate, when the poet quotes from &quot;The Oresteia&quot;:

This choice of excerpt again relates to Alcibiades, still stirring his memory in the audience. Sheppard concludes by referencing the direct mention of Alcibiades&#x27; name, which occurs in the course of Dionysus&#x27; final test of the poets, seeking advice about Alcibiades himself and a strategy for victory. Though Euripides first blasts Alcibiades, Aeschylus responds with the advice to bring him back, bringing the subtle allusions to a clearly stated head and concluding Aristophanes&#x27; point.

==Place in Greek theatre==
===Development in theatre===

The Frogs proved to be a revolutionary piece of media. Through its fascination with education and authorship, the play greatly advances ideas on criticism in theatre that are still seen in contemporary debates and cultural politics. The text is dissected and analyzed, quite literally weighted, within the play itself, prompting the audience to also do so in their viewership. Lines throughout the play point to the intelligence of the newly literate Athens:&quot;But if you&#x27;re both afraid that our spectators lack a certain amount of knowledge, so as

not to appreciate the fine points of what you say, don&#x27;t worry about that, since that is no longer the case. For they are seasoned veterans and each one has a book and understands the clever stuff. Their minds are superior anyway, but now they&#x27;re really sharpened. So fear not, but scrutinize every topic, for the audience&#x27;s sake at least, since they&#x27;re so sophisticated.&quot;

-Chorus, &quot;The Frogs&quot; (lines 1110-1118)In an Athens filled with educated citizens, dramatic performance traditions can be scrutinized for the audience&#x27;s amusement. Within the wider net of social and political judgment, critiquing poetry can reveal what the audience values and what ideas they promote within the city of Athens. The Frogs can also be identified as a piece dedicated to the poetic tradition as it is reaching the end of its era with the deaths of Sophocles and Euripides. Within the story, poets debate about cultural politics ranging from poetry to education in the newly democratic city. These arguments present questions about what drama should be about, what poets actually teach to their audiences, and the type of language poets and playwrights should use. The Frogs exhibit the ways in which civic life and drama are intertwined, enabling the analysis of theater’s impact on politics and cultural development that has continued today.

===Canonization===
The Frogs acts as an early form of Greek canonization. After the deaths of Euripides and Sophocles, the importance of written work in Ancient Greece became highly regarded throughout the region. Although the two authors could no longer produce new plays, their previous works could remain in the minds of Greek audiences through the form of written text. Since the plays were written down, they could also be reperformed. The Frogs presents the beginnings of the Greek literary canon by displaying Euripides, Aeschylus, and Sophocles as some of the most witty, eloquent, topical, and culturally influential playwrights of the time.

The Frogs highlight Athenian cultures&#x27; transition into a more literary society. Many passages in the play reference the sophisticated intellectualism that became associated with Athenians who could and would often read and write. The play’s focus on featuring famous playwrights of the time emphasizes the scholarly advances occurring during the 5th century BCE, serving the goal of preserving cultural memory.

===Structure===
According to Kenneth Dover, the structure of &quot;The Frogs&quot; is as follows: In the first section Dionysus&#x27; has the goal of gaining admission to Pluto&#x27;s palace, and he does so by line 673. The parabasis follows, (lines 674–737) and in the dialogue between the slaves a power struggle between Euripides and Aeschylus is revealed. Euripides is jealous of the other&#x27;s place as the greatest tragic poet. Dionysus is asked by Pluto to mediate the contest or agon.

Charles Paul Segal argues that &quot;The Frogs&quot; is unique in its structure, because it combines two forms of comic motifs, a journey motif and a contest or &quot;agon&quot; motif, with each motif being given equal weight in the play.

Segal contends that Aristophanes transformed the Greek comedy structure when he downgraded the contest or agon which usually preceded the parabasis and expanded the parabasis into the &quot;agon&quot;. In Aristophanes&#x27; earlier plays, i.e., &quot;The Acharnians&quot; and &quot;The Birds&quot;, the protagonist is victorious prior to the parabasis and after the parabasis is usually shown implementing his reforms. Segal suggests that this deviation gave a tone of seriousness to the play.

===Sophocles===
Sophocles was a very influential and highly admired Athenian playwright who died after the play had already been written, during the first phase of its production. Aristophanes did not have enough time to rewrite the play with Sophocles in it, so he simply added in scattered references to Sophocles&#x27;s recent death, referring to him as a worthy playwright. When Aeschylus leaves the underworld at the end of the play, Sophocles takes his throne. The decision to put Sophocles in the same camp as Aeschylus makes sense, in light of the fact that Sophocles&#x27; tragic style was reminiscent of Aeschylus&#x27;, whereas Euripides represents a new style altogether. This is consistent with the central theme of contrasting old ways and new ways.

==References to the play==
In the Gilbert and Sullivan light opera &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot;, Major-General Stanley, in his introductory song, includes the fact that he &quot;knows the croaking chorus from &quot;The Frogs&quot; of Aristophanes&quot; in a list of all his scholarly achievements.

Hope Mirrlees&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1920) cites the chorus in the opening of her modernist poem: &quot;Brekekekek coax coax we are passing under the Seine&quot; (line 10), which also performs the sound of the metro train.

&quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; references this play with the words &quot;Brékkek Kékkek Kékkek Kékkek! Kóax Kóax Kóax! Ualu Ualu Ualu! Quaouauh!&quot;

The call of the Frog Chorus, &quot;Brekekekéx-koáx-koáx&quot; (Greek: Βρεκεκεκέξ κοάξ κοάξ), followed by a few of Charon&#x27;s lines from the play, formed part of the Yale &quot;Long Cheer&quot;, which was first used in public in 1884, and was a feature of Yale sporting events from that time until the 1960s. Lake Forest Academy&#x27;s teams are known as the &quot;Caxys&quot;, a name derived from a similar cheer.

The Long Cheer was echoed in Yale graduate Cole Porter&#x27;s song &quot;I, Jupiter&quot; in his musical &quot;Out of This World&quot;, in which Jupiter sings &quot;I, Jupiter Rex, am positively teeming with sex,&quot; and is answered by the chorus &quot;Brek-ek-ko-ex-ko-ex-SEX! Brek-ek-ko-ex-ko-ex-SEX!&quot; Other colleges imitated or parodied the long cheer, including Penn, which adopted the cry, &quot;Brackey Corax Corix, Roree&quot;. One of these parodies was the first Stanford Axe yell in 1899, when yell leaders used it during the decapitation of a straw effigy: &quot;Give &#x27;em the axe, the axe, the axe!&quot; The Frog Chorus also figured in a later Axe Yell rendering the last two segments &quot;croax croax&quot;, which was used by the University of California and Stanford University.

In his book &quot;Jesting Pilate&quot;, author Aldous Huxley describes listening to a performance of a poem on the subject of Sicily by the Panjabi poet Iqbal, recited by a Mohammedan of Arab descent at a party in Bombay. Huxley summarized the performance with the statement: &quot;And in the suspended notes, in the shakes and warblings over a single long-drawn syllable, I seemed to recognize that distinguishing feature of the Euripidean chorus which Aristophanes derides and parodies in the &quot;Frogs&quot;&quot;.

==Adaptations==
A musical adaptation with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and a book by Burt Shevelove premiered in 1974 at Yale University&#x27;s Olympic-size swimming pool. The ensemble cast included then Yale students Meryl Streep, Sigourney Weaver and Christopher Durang. It later premiered on Broadway in 2004 with additional songs by Sondheim and revisions to the book by Nathan Lane.

<doc id="494643" wikidata="Q388134" url="?curid=494643" title="Jerry Sloan">
<text>Gerald Eugene Sloan (March 28, 1942 – May 22, 2020) was an American professional basketball player and coach. He played 11 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) before beginning a 30-year coaching career, 23 of which were spent as head coach of the Utah Jazz (1988–2011). NBA commissioner David Stern referred to Sloan as &quot;one of the greatest and most respected coaches in NBA history&quot;. Sloan was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2009.

After playing college basketball with the Evansville Purple Aces, Sloan was selected by the Baltimore Bullets with the fourth overall pick of the 1965 NBA draft. He spent his rookie season with the Bullets before playing the remainder of his career with the Chicago Bulls, retiring due to injuries in 1976. Nicknamed &quot;the Original Bull&quot;, he was a two-time NBA All-Star, a six-time member of the All-Defensive Team and the first player to have his number retired by the Bulls. Sloan then became a coach, and had a career regular-season win–loss record of 1,221–803, placing him third all-time in NBA wins at the time he retired. He was the fifth coach to reach 1,000 NBA victories and is one of two coaches in NBA history to record 1,000 wins with one club (the Utah Jazz). Sloan coached the Jazz to 15 consecutive playoff appearances from 1989 to 2003. He is one of only four coaches in NBA history with 15-plus consecutive seasons that have a winning record. He led Utah to the NBA Finals in 1997 and 1998, but lost to Chicago both times.

After Tom Kelly stepped down as manager of the Minnesota Twins in Major League Baseball in 2001, Sloan became the longest-tenured head coach in American major league sports with their current franchise. He resigned mid-season from the Jazz in 2011 before returning in 2013 as an adviser and scouting consultant.

==Early life==
Born and raised in Gobbler&#x27;s Knob, Illinois, south of McLeansboro, Sloan was the youngest of 10 children and was raised by a single mother after his father died when Jerry was 4 years old. He would wake up at 4:30 a.m. to do farm chores and then walk almost two miles to get to school in time for 7 a.m. basketball practice. After school, he would walk back home from practice. Sloan graduated an all-state player from McLeansboro High School in 1960.

==College career==
Sloan first enrolled at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, withdrew, enrolled at Southern Illinois University, and withdrew once more before attending Evansville, where he played college basketball for the Evansville Purple Aces from 1962 to 1965, where he was named the Indiana Collegiate Conference (ICC) Player of the Year in 1963 and 1965 and a three-time first-team All-ICC selection. He was chosen as the 19th overall pick in the 1964 NBA draft by the Baltimore Bullets but he remained in college and led the Purple Aces to their second in two consecutive Division II national titles.

==Professional career==

Sloan was selected fourth in the 1965 NBA draft by the Baltimore Bullets. The Chicago Bulls, an expansion team, selected Sloan in the 1966 NBA expansion draft. He became known as &quot;the Original Bull&quot;, known for his tenacious defense, leading them to the playoffs in their first season, and to their first and only division title before the Michael Jordan era; after a series of knee injuries, he retired in 1976. He averaged more than 18 points a game in 1970–71, and over 15 points per game three other seasons.
Despite his height of only , his career rebounding average was 7.4 rebounds per game, with one season having an average of 9.1 rebounds. He was a career 72 percent free throw shooter. His number 4 jersey was subsequently retired by the Chicago Bulls in 1978, becoming the first retired jersey in franchise history.
==Coaching career==
While at Evansville, coach Arad McCutchan suggested that Sloan coach at his alma mater. After retiring in 1976, Sloan took the Evansville job, but withdrew after five days. That same season, the Evansville basketball team and coaching staff were killed in a plane crash at Evansville Airport.

Two years later, Sloan was hired by the Bulls as a scout. After one season in this role, he became an assistant coach with the team. In 1979, Sloan was promoted to the position of head coach. He held the position for less than three seasons, winning 94 games and losing 121. He led the team to the playoffs in his second year, but was fired after a poor start during the following campaign.

===Utah Jazz===
After departing Chicago, Sloan became a scout for the Utah Jazz for one season. He then became coach of the Evansville Thunder of the Continental Basketball Association for the 1984 season but never coached a game instead accepting an assistant coach position with the Jazz. After Frank Layden became team president in December 1988, the Jazz chose Sloan as the new head coach. Sloan enjoyed a successful run of 16 consecutive seasons of taking his team to the playoffs, during which time he coached future Hall of Famers Karl Malone and John Stockton, along with other players including Jeff Hornacek, Antoine Carr, Tom Chambers, Mark Eaton, and Jeff Malone.
Sloan led the Jazz to six division championships and 10 seasons with greater than 50 wins. He also took the Jazz to the NBA Finals twice, losing in 1997 and 1998, both times to his old team, the Chicago Bulls, led at the time by Michael Jordan. By the end of this period, he had joined Pat Riley and Phil Jackson as the only coaches with 10 or more seasons winning 50 or more games. After the retirement of long-time Jazz players Malone and Stockton, Sloan coached a younger group of players, including Carlos Boozer, Andrei Kirilenko, Mehmet Okur, and later, Deron Williams.
After John Stockton retired and Karl Malone signed with the Lakers in the summer of 2003, the 2003-2004 Jazz were widely predicted to be the worst team in the NBA and some even predicted that Utah would set the all-time single season record for fewest wins in a season. Despite the very low expectations and despite second leading scorer Matt Harpring being sidelined for 51 games due to a knee injury, Sloan and his team were involved in a battle for the eighth spot in the Western Conference, which would have given Sloan his 17th straight trip to the playoffs. The Jazz were tied with the Denver Nuggets for the eighth and last spot of the playoffs with three games to go in the regular season. The Jazz lost the final two games, causing Sloan to miss the playoffs for the first time in 18 seasons as Jazz coach. After leading a young team in its first year without Stockton and Malone to an unexpected 42–40 record, he finished just behind Hubie Brown of the Memphis Grizzlies in voting for the 2004 NBA Coach of the Year Award.

Sloan collected his 1,000th career win against the Dallas Mavericks on December 11, 2006, in a 101–79 victory, which made him only the fifth coach in NBA history to reach the milestone. After disappointing seasons in 2004–05 and 2005–06, the Jazz in the 2006–07 returned to contention. For this, Sloan was again on many sportswriters&#x27; ballots for Coach of the Year, however, he lost the award to Toronto Raptors head coach Sam Mitchell, who led his team to a franchise record-tying 47 victories and their first Atlantic Division title. Sloan lost the vote 394–301.

The Jazz advanced to the Western Conference finals on May 15, 2007, with a 100–87 win over the Golden State Warriors. It was the sixth time in franchise history that Utah advanced to the conference finals, all coming under Sloan. However, they went on to lose 4–1 to the San Antonio Spurs.

During the 2008–09 season, Sloan reached 1,000 wins as coach of the Jazz on November 7 after beating the Oklahoma City Thunder 104–97 in a Friday night game. He became the first coach in NBA history with 1,000 wins for one team. Sloan returned as head coach of the Jazz for the 2009–10 season, leading the team to a 53–29 record and the playoffs.

Mirroring his tenacity as a player, Sloan was just as fiery as a coach. He was suspended one game for pushing referee Bob Delaney in April 1993. A decade later, Sloan was served a seven-game suspension in 2003 for pushing referee Courtney Kirkland in Sacramento.

In April 2009, Sloan was named to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, in the same class as his former longtime point guard John Stockton. Sloan chose the class of 2006 Hall of Famer Charles Barkley to introduce him during his induction ceremony.

====Resignation as Jazz head coach====
Sloan revealed on February 7, 2011, that he had earlier in the year signed a contract extension to coach the Jazz for the 2011–12 season, which would have been his 24th season as head coach with the Jazz. However, on February 10, 2011, Sloan and assistant Phil Johnson resigned their positions effective immediately. Sloan downplayed reports that conflicts with players prompted his departure. &quot;I&#x27;ve had confrontations with players since I&#x27;ve been in the league&quot;, Sloan said. &quot;There&#x27;s only so much energy left and my energy has dropped.&quot; KSL-TV later asked Sloan whether reported conflicts with guard Deron Williams forced him to leave. &quot;I forced myself out&quot;, Sloan responded. Williams acknowledged that he had a disagreement with Sloan during the previous night&#x27;s game, but he added, &quot;I would never force Coach Sloan out of Utah. He&#x27;s meant more to this town, more to this organization than I have by far. I would have asked out of Utah first.&quot; Sloan&#x27;s last game as head coach came in a 91–86 loss to the Bulls on February 9, and assistant coach Tyrone Corbin was then named as Sloan&#x27;s replacement.

Nearly two weeks later, Williams was involved in a trade on February 23, 2011, that sent him to the New Jersey Nets. Ian Thomsen of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; wrote, &quot;First Jerry Sloan leaves, now Williams is sent away. For two decades we knew who the Utah Jazz were and what they stood for as a franchise. Now we, and they, can have no idea.&quot;

A year later, Karl Malone, who played under Sloan for over 18 years, indicated that Sloan did not feel supported by Kevin O&#x27;Connor and Greg Miller. Longtime San Antonio Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich would later mention him as a mentor for his overall coaching success in the NBA.

====Return to the Jazz====
On June 19, 2013, the Utah Jazz announced that Sloan was returning as an adviser and scouting consultant.

On January 31, 2014, the Jazz honored Sloan by raising a banner featuring the number &quot;1223&quot;, which represents Sloan&#x27;s total number of combined regular season and playoff wins with the Jazz from 1988 to 2011.

==Personal life and death==
Sloan married his high-school sweetheart, Bobbye. After a much-publicized six-year battle against breast cancer, she died of pancreatic cancer in 2004. They had three children and were married 41 years.

In 2006, Sloan married Tammy Jessop, in Salt Lake City. Sloan had a stepson as a result of this marriage.

Sloan was known to wear John Deere hats, and collected antique furniture and dolls.
 He also collected and restored tractors as a hobby. After amassing a collection of 70 tractors, Sloan decided to sell all but two of them after a 35-year-old Allis-Chalmers tractor was stolen.

In April 2016, Sloan was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease and Lewy body dementia. He died on May 22, 2020, at age 78, from complications of the diseases.

==Quotes==

*&quot;These guys have been criticized the last few years for not getting to where we&#x27;re going, but I&#x27;ve always said that the most important thing in sports is to keep trying. Let this be an example of what it means to say it&#x27;s never over.&quot;—after the Utah Jazz defeated the Houston Rockets in game 6 of the 1997 Western Conference finals.
*&quot;I don&#x27;t care if he&#x27;s 19 or 30. If he&#x27;s going to be on the floor in the NBA, he&#x27;s got to be able to step up and get after it. We can&#x27;t put diapers on him one night, and a jockstrap the next night. It&#x27;s just the way it is.&quot;—on second year guard C. J. Miles, the youngest player on the 2006–07 Utah Jazz.
*&quot;Size doesn&#x27;t make any difference; heart is what makes a difference.&quot;

<doc id="494648" wikidata="Q2565553" url="?curid=494648" title="Ryoma Echizen">
<text>is a fictional character and the protagonist of the manga and anime series &quot;The Prince of Tennis&quot; created by Takeshi Konomi. In the series, Ryoma is portrayed as a twelve-year-old tennis prodigy who won four consecutive Junior Tennis Tournaments in America. His father is Nanjiro Echizen, a former tennis pro nicknamed &quot;Samurai Nanjiro&quot;. At his father&#x27;s request, Ryoma returns to Japan in order to attend Seishun Academy (&quot;Seigaku&quot;), a private middle school famous for its tennis team. Due to his cocky attitude, he constantly butts heads with some of his upperclassmen as well as anger most of his opponents in tennis matches. Still, he, along with his team, evolve as tennis players in order to win the National Tennis Tournament. Throughout the story, Ryoma continues to find his own style of tennis by creating original techniques instead of merely being a copy of his father. Ryoma also appears in other media adaptations of the series including musicals, video games, soundtracks, and films.

Ryoma has been fairly popular among readers, having always stayed in the top four most popular characters, even placing first in two of the polls. Also, Ryoma&#x27;s character has been featured in more soundtracks than any other character in the series. His likeness has appeared in numerous types of other merchandise as well, including key chains and clothing. However, in publicized reviews for the anime and manga, his character has received mixed reviews, with his personality being heavily criticized. Reviewers from Anime News Network and DVDTalk both finding Ryoma&#x27;s cocky and &quot;arrogant&quot; attitude difficult to like. Though they both find his tennis skills undeniable, they comment on how that makes it &quot;difficult for the reader to latch on and share in his experiences,&quot; eliminating the tension that comes with underdog appeal. The ANN reviewer, however, believes that some of the highlights of the series are the numerous ways that Ryoma defeats his opponents. On the other hand, Mania comments that Ryoma does not come off as too &quot;over the top or too serious, but just the right level to be intimidating.&quot; And Jeffrey Harris of IGN cites that though Ryoma starts off as &quot;stiff and cold,&quot; he slowly starts to break out of his shell.

==Reception==
According to every &quot;Shonen Jump&quot; character popularity poll of series, Ryoma has been fairly popular among readers; he won both the first and third popularity polls; he ranked second in the second poll; and third in the fourth popularity poll. Also, since Ryoma is the main character of the series, he has been featured on more soundtracks than any other character, with some featuring only himself. Numerous types of other merchandise have been released in his likeness, including key chains, clothing, and mugs. NTT customers voted him as their 15th favorite black haired male anime character.

In publications focused on manga and anime reviews, Ryoma&#x27;s character has received both positive and negative remarks, though his personality is largely criticized. In Anime News Network&#x27;s review of the series&#x27; first manga volume, they comment on how his skills doesn&#x27;t &quot;leave much room for improvement...making it difficult for the reader to latch on and share in his experiences,&quot; and that his character &quot;comes across as dull, cold and untouchable.&quot; However, they remark that the highlights of the volume are the &quot;numerous methods Ryoma takes to make his opponents eat their words on the tennis court.&quot; When a reviewer from the same site reviewed the first DVD volume, he had a similar response in regards to Ryoma&#x27;s skills, in that it eliminates underdog appeal, and describes Ryoma as &quot;terse, reserved, and arrogant, which makes him difficult to like.&quot; John Sinott of DVD Talk echoes the same sentiments in regards to Ryoma&#x27;s personality, seeing him as cocky and unlikeable despite having the talent to back up his attitude. His review of the next two DVD volumes went on to describe how Ryoma&#x27;s impossible tennis moves hindered his ability to enjoy the show, and Park Cooper of MangaLife was similarly surprised at the character&#x27;s unnatural abilities. Chris Beveridge of Mania, however, sees Ryoma as one who does not come off as &quot;over the top or too serious,&quot; yet still cites the character&#x27;s &quot;serious level of confidence,&quot; and also comments on how &quot;Ryoma&#x27;s nature as someone who has seen a good bit of the world comes into play nicely at times.&quot; Though Jeffrey Harris of IGN also sees Ryoma as a &quot;fairly stiff and cold character,&quot; he believes that the character begins to warm up to his teammates and is &quot;slowly breaking out of his shell.&quot; Jian DeLeon of &quot;Complex&quot; magazine named him nineteenth on a list of &quot;The 25 Most Stylish Anime Characters.&quot;

In the book &quot;Manga: An Anthology of Global and Cultural Perspectives&quot;, Ryoma is compared to &quot;Slam Dunk&quot; protagonist Hanamichi Sakuragi as both as unconventional sport manga character who are initially not interested by the sport but instead in showing off their skills.

<doc id="494649" wikidata="Q698481" url="?curid=494649" title="Without You (Badfinger song)">
<text>&quot;Without You&quot; is a song written by Pete Ham and Tom Evans of British rock group Badfinger, and first released on their 1970 album &quot;No Dice&quot;. The power ballad has been recorded by over 180 artists, and versions released as singles by Harry Nilsson (1971) and Mariah Carey (1994) became international number one hits. The Nilsson version was included in 2021&#x27;s &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. Paul McCartney once described it as &quot;the killer song of all time&quot;.

In 1972, writers Ham and Evans received the British Academy&#x27;s Ivor Novello Award for Best Song Musically and Lyrically.

==Badfinger original==
First recorded by the rock group Badfinger, the song was composed by two of its members. Pete Ham wrote a song originally titled &quot;If It&#x27;s Love&quot;, but it had lacked a strong chorus. At the time of writing, the band shared residence with the Mojos at 7 Park Avenue in Golders Green. One evening, in the midst of the parties, songwriting, touring, in Golders Green, Ham and his girlfriend Beverly Tucker were about to go out for the evening. But just as they were leaving Tom Evans said he had an idea for a song – Ham said, &quot;Not tonight, I&#x27;ve promised Bev.&quot; But she thought he would be wondering if he had done the right thing later, if he went out. She told him, &quot;Go into the studio, I&#x27;m fine about it...&quot; He replied, &quot;Your mouth is smiling, but your eyes are sad.&quot; The song Ham wrote that night was called &quot;If it&#x27;s Love&quot; and has the verse &quot;Well I can&#x27;t forget tomorrow, when I think of all my sorrow, I had you there but then I let you go, and now it&#x27;s only fair that I should let you know... if it&#x27;s love&quot;. But Ham wasn&#x27;t happy with the chorus.

Evans&#x27; relationship with his future wife Marianne influenced his lyrics:

Both Ham and Evans said they did not consider the song to have much potential at the time Badfinger recorded it, and the track was slotted to close the first side of their 1970 album &quot;No Dice&quot;. Badfinger&#x27;s recording of the song, which is more brusque than its successors&#x27; versions, was not released as a single in Europe or North America.

&quot;Stereogum&quot; reviewer Tom Breihan said of Badfinger&#x27;s version that it &quot;is strummy and direct, but it also sounds like a blueprint, not a final version. They could’ve turned it into a showstopping ballad, but they didn’t.&quot;

&quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; critic Michael Gallucci rated it as Badfinger&#x27;s 4th-best song, calling it a &quot;quiet gem&quot; that &quot;hits all the right emotional notes.&quot; &quot;Classic Rock&quot; critic Rob Hughes rated it Badfinger&#x27;s 6th-best song, saying it is &quot;less saccharine and more understated [than the Nilsson and Carey versions], delivered with a genuine sense of anguish.&quot; Paul McCartney called it &quot;the killer song of all time.&quot;

The two writers of the song, Ham and Evans, later died by suicide due to legal and financial issues. In Evans&#x27; case, it was a dispute over songwriting royalties for &quot;Without You&quot; that precipitated his action. Songwriting royalties had become the subject of constant legal wrangling for Evans, and in 1983, following an acrimonious argument with his bandmate Joey Molland over the royalties for the song, Evans hanged himself.

==Harry Nilsson version==
===Background and history===

Harry Nilsson, at the time best known for his hit &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Talkin&#x27;&quot; and for composing &quot;One&quot;, recorded by Three Dog Night, heard Badfinger&#x27;s recording of &quot;Without You&quot; at a party, and mistook it for a Beatles song. 

After realising it was not, he decided to cover the song for his 1971 album &quot;Nilsson Schmilsson&quot;. According to Breihan, &quot;He wanted his version of the song to be a stark, heavy solo-piano thing, but [producer Richard] Perry convinced him to turn it into a grand, crashing, theatrical monster-ballad, complete with orchestra.&quot; Gary Wright, who worked with Badfinger on George Harrison&#x27;s projects, played the piano. Also featured are Klaus Voormann (bass), Jim Keltner (drums) and John Uribe (acoustic guitar). The string and horn arrangements are by Paul Buckmaster.

===Commercial performance===
The single was released by RCA in the autumn of 1971, and it first charted on radio stations across the US in early December. &quot;Without You&quot; debuted at number 99 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on 18 December 1971, and on its tenth week, in the chart dated 19 February 1972, started its four-week run at number one, as his only song to peak at that position. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked it as the number-four single of 1972. The record topped &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Easy Listening chart for five weeks.

The record spent five weeks at number one on the UK singles chart, beginning on 11 March, eventually selling almost 800,000 copies. It went to number one in several other countries, including Australia (for five weeks), Ireland (two weeks) and New Zealand (two weeks).

The single was re-released in 1976 where it went back to number one in Ireland for two weeks and peaked at #22 in the UK.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Billboard&quot; said it was &quot;by far [Nilsson&#x27;s] most commercial driving rock ballad in some time.&quot; &quot;Cashbox&quot; said of the single &quot;Couple a winning Badfinger tune with Gary Wright&#x27;s piano and Nilsson&#x27;s wideranging voice, and you&#x27;ve got Harry&#x27;s biggest hit since &#x27;Everybody&#x27;s Talkin&#x27;.&#x27;&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; said that &quot;Nilsson&#x27;s brilliant rendition of this Badfinger song has more than enough of the stuff of which hits are made.&quot; Breihan described the song as &quot;going-for-it schmaltz,&quot; compared with Badfinger&#x27;s &quot;vaguely embarrassed schmaltz&quot;, but basically considered it a &quot;big and silly and down-the-middle breakup ballad.&quot; &quot;SingersRoom&quot; critic Erica Henderson rated it as Nilsson&#x27;s best song, saying that &quot;the song&#x27;s haunting melody and heartbreaking lyrics about lost love have made it a timeless classic&quot; and that &quot;Nilsson’s rendition features soaring vocals, soaring strings, and a melancholic piano that perfectly complement the song’s mournful tone.&quot;

The single, Grammy-nominated for Record of the Year, was produced by Richard Perry, who later explained, &quot;It was a different record for its time. It was a big ballad with a heavy backbeat, and although many artists have cut songs like it since, no one was doing it then.&quot; In 1973, the single won Nilsson the Grammy award for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male. While Nilsson rarely gave live concerts, he did perform the song with Ringo Starr and his All-Starr Band at Caesar&#x27;s Palace in Las Vegas in September 1992.

In 1972 Evans said of finding out that Nilsson had recorded the song as a single:

In 2021, this version was ranked 496th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

==Mariah Carey version==

American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey&#x27;s version, based on Harry Nilsson&#x27;s version rather than the Badfinger original, was released as the third single off &quot;Music Box&quot; in the first quarter of 1994, its US release date of 21 January 1994 by Columbia Records, falling a week after Nilsson had died following a heart attack on 15 January 1994. In the US &quot;Without You&quot; was promoted as a double A-side with &quot;Never Forget You&quot;. While she had heard Nilsson&#x27;s version as a very young girl, Carey&#x27;s decision to remake his hit was based on a chance hearing during the time she was recording &quot;Music Box&quot;: &quot;I heard that song in a restaurant and just knew it would be a huge international hit&quot; recalls Carey. Carey&#x27;s version has been considered very popular on talent shows. &quot;Without You&quot; was later included on some non-US pressings of her compilation albums &quot;#1&#x27;s&quot; (1998) and &quot;#1 to Infinity&quot; (2015), and her 2001 compilation, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;. &quot;Without You&quot; was also included on her 2008 compilation &quot;The Ballads&quot;.

&quot;Without You&quot; reached number three on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for six weeks. &quot;Without You&quot; remains Carey&#x27;s biggest hit across Europe. In the United Kingdom, where Carey had yet to score a number one hit, &quot;Without You&quot; made its UK chart debut at number one where it remained for four weeks in total, and later ended as the 7th best-selling single of 1994 in the United Kingdom. It topped the European Hot 100 Singles chart for two weeks and reached number one for ten weeks in Switzerland; eight weeks in Austria and Sweden; seven weeks in Belgium; five weeks in Ireland and the Netherlands; four weeks in Germany and Iceland; and two weeks in Scotland.

==Other versions==
* in 1975: Ruby Winters (single/ No. 95 R&amp;B)
* in 1977: Susie Allanson (album &quot;A Little Love&quot;) (also 1979 single/ No. 77 C&amp;W); Heart (album &quot;Magazine&quot;)
* in 1983: Herman van Veen (album &quot;On Broadway&quot;); T. G. Sheppard (album &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;) (also single/ No. 12 C&amp;W)
* in 1991: Air Supply (album &quot;The Earth Is...&quot;) (also single/ No. 48 A/C)
* in 2008: Valentina Hasan, a contestant auditioning for the Bulgarian show Music Idol, interpreted the song as &quot;Ken Lee&quot;

==ASCAP and Ivor Novello recognition==

On 15 May 1995, at ASCAP&#x27;s twelfth annual Pop Music Awards in Beverly Hills, California, &quot;Without You&quot; was recognised as one of the 50 most-played songs of 1994 (due largely to Mariah Carey&#x27;s recording). Discrepancies in ASCAP&#x27;s books, resulting from a lawsuit against the Ham and Evans estates by their former manager, incorrectly attributed the song as being composed not only by Ham and Evans, but also by Badfinger&#x27;s other bandmembers, Mike Gibbins and Joey Molland, and their former manager, Bill Collins. This designation and a lack of correction by ASCAP prompted the Ham Estate to boycott the ceremony. The song was also nominated for &quot;Song of the Year&quot; in London at the Ivor Novello Awards.

<text>Richthofen&#x27;s War, subtitled &quot;The Air War 1916–1918&quot;, is a board wargame published by Avalon Hill in 1973 that simulates aerial combat during World War I.

==Description==
&quot;Richthofen&#x27;s War&quot; is a two-player game in which one player controls one or more German airplanes of the First World War, and the other player controls Allied aircraft. 

===Components===
The game box contains:
* 22&quot; x 24&quot; mounted hex grid map of a section of the Western Front, including lines of trenches and no man&#x27;s land
* 80 die-cut counters
* rulebook
* eight scenario cards
* playing aids and charts
* airplane data card
* six-sided die

===Scenarios and gameplay===
The first edition of the game comes with eight scenarios. In some of the scenarios, several alternative pairings of aircraft are given. Using Basic Rules, players control one aircraft each; both have identical flight properties. The Advanced rules allow for more aircraft that have varied flight characteristics.

The second edition released in 1977 has 23 missions that can be played as a campaign game.

==Publication history==
In 1966, Mike Carr designed a game of First World War aerial combat, &quot;Fight in the Skies&quot;, after watching the movie &quot;The Blue Max&quot;. In 1972, Simulations Publications Inc. (SPI) published a similarly-themed aerial combat wargame, &quot;Flying Circus&quot;. The following year, Avalon Hill released the very similar &quot;Richthofen&#x27;s War&quot;, designed by Randall C. Reed, with graphic design and artwork contributed by Reed, Donal Greenwood, Thomas N. Shaw, W. Scott Moores, and Thomas N. Shaw. &quot;The Avalon Hill General Index and Company History&quot; claimed that &quot;Although owing much of its inspiration to &quot;Flying Circus&quot; and &quot;Fight in the Skies&quot;, [&quot;Richthofen&#x27;s War&quot;] was readily recognized as better than its predecessors.&quot; 

Although SPI claimed that &quot;Richthofen&#x27;s War&quot; was virtually identical to their &quot;Flying Circus&quot; game, their own poll showed that &quot;Richthofen&#x27;s War&quot; enjoyed a higher initial popularity when it was released, and continued to be more popular than SPI&#x27;s game at six months and one year after publication. In 1977, four years after its release, &quot;Richthofen&#x27;s War&quot; still placed in the top 50 in SPI&#x27;s poll of wargames. 

Avalon Hill published an expansion set of 27 maneuver cards in 1977.

==Reception==
In &quot;A Player&#x27;s Guide to Table Games&quot;, John Jackson called this game &quot;very likely the best wargame on the market. [...] it requires less time to learn, set up and play than any other likely candidate, and it is easy to add options gradually, from game to game, as you become increasingly familiar with play.&quot; Jackson concluded, &quot;In short, if I were limited to a single wargame, it would be &quot;Richthofen&#x27;s War&quot;.&quot;

In his 1977 book &quot;The Comprehensive Guide to Board Wargaming&quot;, Nicholas Palmer noted &quot;this game has surprised many with its continuing success.&quot; He listed its good points as &quot;an excellent product, clear rules, well balanced between playability and realism, a variety of brisk scenarios, and a good period &#x27;feel&#x27;, with a more interesting mapboard that usual in air games.&quot;

In the 1980 book &quot;The Complete Book of Wargames&quot;, game designer Jon Freeman noted that &quot;the game system is remarkable in its portrayal of the various factors involved in aerial combat during World War I.&quot; Freeman also pointed out that the game could be played by anyone, commenting, &quot;The game has always been among the most enjoyable in the genre and, despite its complexities, can be played by the rankest novice.&quot; He concluded by giving the game an Overall Evaluation of &quot;Excellent&quot;, saying, &quot;The multitude of scenarios possible will keep the game fresh long after less diversified games have become stale. It has something for everyone.&quot; 

Bill Thompson, writing for the Wargame Academy, noted that &quot;Richthofen&#x27;s War&quot; attracts an older demographic, saying, &quot;its forte and foible is its simplicity and familiarity with old time gamers. [...] Game strength is its role as an introductory game and ease of player designed scenarios and campaigns. The introduction of the maneuver card variant added some realism, suspense and refinement.&quot; 
In Issue 22 of &quot;Moves&quot;, Carl Hoffman called SPI&#x27;s &quot;Flying Circus&quot; &quot;a much more limited game&quot; compared to &quot;Richthofen&#x27;s War&quot;.

In &quot;The Guide to Simulations/Games for Education and Training&quot;, Martin Campion compared using this game in the classroom versus rival game &quot;Fight in the Skies&quot; published by TSR, and advised that the TSR game &quot;is the most difficult to learn and play because it does more with smaller details of combat. On the whole, it is not very suitable for class plays. So if I wanted to use a game on this subject, I would use &quot;Richthofen&#x27;s War&quot;.&quot;

==Other recognition==
A copy of &quot;Richthofen&#x27;s War&quot; is held in the collection of the Imperial War Museum (object EPH 2946).

<text>The Seven Network (stylised 7Network, commonly known as Channel Seven or simply Seven) is a major Australian commercial free-to-air television network. It is owned by Seven West Media Limited, and is one of the five main free-to-air television networks in Australia. The network&#x27;s headquarters are located in Sydney.

As of 2014, it was the second-largest network in the country in terms of population reach. The Seven Network shows various nonfiction shows—such as news broadcasts (&quot;Seven News&quot;) and sports programming—as well as fiction shows. In 2011, the network won all 40 out of 40 weeks of the ratings season for total viewers, being the first to achieve this since the introduction of the OzTAM ratings system in 2001. 

As of 2024, the Seven Network is the highest-rated television network nationally, in Australia, ahead of the Nine Network, ABC TV, Network 10 and SBS.

==Headquarters==
Seven&#x27;s administration headquarters are in Eveleigh, Sydney, completed in 2003. National news and current affairs programming are based between flagship station ATN-7 in Sydney and HSV-7 in Melbourne. In 2009, Seven moved its Sydney-based production operations from Epping to a purpose-built high-definition television production facility at the Australian Technology Park in Eveleigh.

==History==
===Origins===
The present Seven Network began as a group of independent stations in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. HSV-7 Melbourne, licensed to The Herald and Weekly Times Ltd (owners of two local papers at the time, &quot;The Herald&quot; and &quot;The Sun&quot;), was launched on 4 November 1956, the first television station in the country to use the VHF7 frequency. ATN-7 Sydney, licensed to Amalgamated Television Services, a subsidiary of Fairfax, was launched on 2 December 1956, signing on as Sydney&#x27;s third television station. The two stations did not immediately share resources, and instead formed content-sharing partnerships with their VHF9 counterparts by 1957: ATN-7 partnered with Melbourne&#x27;s GTV-9, while HSV-7 paired up with Sydney&#x27;s TCN-9. TVW-7 Perth, licensed to TVW Limited, a subsidiary of West Australian Newspapers, publisher of &quot;The West Australian&quot;, began broadcasting almost two years later, on 16 October 1959, as the city&#x27;s first television station. BTQ-7 Brisbane followed on 1 November 1959, signing on as Brisbane&#x27;s second television station. ADS-7 Adelaide was launched on 24 October 1959 as the final capital city VHF7 station. The station later swapped frequencies with SAS-10 on 27 December 1987 as ADS-10 and SAS-7.

HSV-7 began its relationship with the Victorian Football League (now the Australian Football League) in April 1957, when the station broadcast the first live Australian rules football match. Throughout this time, the stations operated independently of each other, with schedules made up of various simple, and relatively inexpensive, programs, such as &quot;Pick a Box&quot; and spinoffs of popular radio shows. In the early 1960s, coaxial cable links, formed initially between Sydney and Melbourne, allowed the sharing of programmes and simultaneous broadcasts of live shows.

In 1960, Frank Packer, the owner of Sydney&#x27;s TCN-9, bought a controlling share of Melbourne&#x27;s GTV-9, in the process creating the country&#x27;s first television network (unofficially called &quot;the National Nine Network&quot;) and dissolving the ATN-7/GTV-9 and the HSV-7/TCN-9 partnerships. Left without their original partners, ATN-7 and HSV-7 joined to form the Australian Television Network in 1963. The new grouping was soon joined by other capital-city channel 7 stations, ADS-7 Adelaide and BTQ-7 Brisbane. The new network began to produce and screen higher-budget programs to attract viewers, most notably &quot;Homicide&quot;, a series which would continue for another 12 years to become the nation&#x27;s longest running drama series. However, it was not until 1970, after the network adopted the Network 7 name, that a national network logo was adopted, albeit still with independently owned and operated stations with local advertising campaigns.

Colour television was introduced across the network in 1975, when a new colour logo was adopted. Rupert Murdoch made an unsuccessful bid for the &quot;Herald and Weekly Times&quot;, owners of HSV-7, in 1979, later going on to gain control of rival ATV-10. Fairfax, however, successfully bought a 14.9% share of the company later in the same year.

===1980s===
The 1980s saw the introduction of stereo sound, as well as a number of successful shows, most notably &quot;A Country Practice&quot; in 1981, and &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot;, which began in 1982. &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; began its 25-year run in July 1981, produced from ADS-7&#x27;s studios in Adelaide. The 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow were shown live on the network the year before. &quot;Neighbours&quot; began on Seven in 1985, but low ratings in Sydney led to the cancellation of the new series at the end of the year, which later moved to Network Ten and went on to achieve international success.

Perth based businessman Robert Holmes à Court, through his business the Bell Group, bought TVW-7 from its original owners, West Australian Newspapers in 1982. It was in 1984 that the network proceeded to drop the &quot;Network 7&quot; branding. &quot;The Herald and Weekly Times&quot;, owner of HSV-7 and ADS-7, was sold to Rupert Murdoch in December 1986 for an estimated A$1.8 billion. Murdoch&#x27;s company, News Limited, sold off HSV-7 to Fairfax soon afterwards, for $320 million. Fairfax went on to axe a number of locally produced shows in favour of networked content from its Sydney counterpart, ATN-7 (also owned by Fairfax at the time).

Cross-media ownership laws introduced in 1987 forced Fairfax to choose between its print and television operations – it chose the former, and later sold off its stations to Qintex Ltd., owned by businessman Christopher Skase. Qintex had previously bought, and subsequently sold off, stations in Brisbane and regional Queensland before taking control of the network. It was also in 1987 that the network returned to the &quot;Australian Television Network&quot; branding. The next year, another new logo was introduced along with evening soap &quot;Home and Away&quot; and a relaunched &quot;Seven National News&quot;, now known as &quot;Seven News&quot;. The network became truly national in 1988 when Skase bought TVW-7 for $130 million. In 1991, the network changed its name once again to the Seven Network, though it had been unofficially using that name for some time before then.

Despite the network&#x27;s successes, a failed $1.5 billion bid for MGM Studios in the same year sent Qintex into receivership. Christopher Skase fled Australia in 1990 to escape extradition. The business&#x27; assets were bundled together by receivers and made into a new company, the Seven Network Limited, in 1991.

===1990s===
&quot;Real Life&quot;, a national current-affairs programme hosted by Stan Grant, similar in format to the Nine Network&#x27;s &quot;A Current Affair&quot;, was launched in 1992 but was later replaced by the more successful &quot;Today Tonight&quot;.

The network was listed on the stock exchange in 1993, soon after the entry of subscription television provider Australis. One of Seven&#x27;s most popular series, &quot;A Country Practice&quot;, ended in 1993 after 1058 episodes. 1993 saw the introduction of &quot;Blue Heelers&quot;, which after a number of timeslot changes, was moved in 1998 to Wednesdays. This was to make room for a new series, medical drama &quot;All Saints&quot;. Both dramas rated quite highly, and along with new lifestyle shows &quot;Better Homes and Gardens&quot; and &quot;The Great Outdoors&quot;, resulted in a stronger ratings position for the network.

In 1995, Sunshine Television, a Seven Network affiliate in regional Queensland, was purchased by the network&#x27;s parent company, Seven Network Limited. Sunshine Television&#x27;s regional stations effectively became a part of the Seven Network, identical in appearance and programming to the rest of the business&#x27; stations. Australian Gladiators Series 1 and Series 2 in 1995-1996 filmed in Brisbane, and Series 3 filmed in Sydney proved popular. &quot;Seven Queensland&quot; won the annual audience ratings for the first time in 1998.

Between 1995 and April 2001, Alan Jackson of Nylex was the non-executive director of Seven, after being asked by Stokes to lead the company.

A successful $1.3 billion bid for United Artists was made in conjunction with Kirk Kerkorian in 1996; the network sold its stake two years later for $US389 million. Seven took control of Australia Television, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s Asian satellite channel, in 1997. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation still maintained a share in the network, and continued to produce news and current affairs programming for it.

===2000s===
During the late 1990s and early 2000s, a state-of-the-art high definition national broadcast facility was constructed in Docklands, Melbourne, replacing the previous facility in Epping, Sydney. This new facility would also house HSV-7&#x27;s Melbourne offices and studios.

The year 2000 saw former Nine executive David Leckie appointed as head of television operations, re-launching the network with an updated logo, and a new advertising campaign timed expressly for the network&#x27;s coverage of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. The opening ceremony was one of the highest-ever rating television programmes in the country, with 6.5 million viewers, contributing to the network winning the ratings year for the first time in twenty-two years.

Digital television was introduced to most of the network&#x27;s coverage area on 1 January 2001. This was soon followed by the gradual introduction of wide screen and high definition programming.

In January 2006, the Seven Network, Pacific Magazines and online portal Yahoo! Australia and New Zealand combined in a joint venture to form Yahoo!7, representing all three companies&#x27; online assets.

7HD was officially announced on 15 September 2007, with the Seven Media Group announcing their intention to start a high definition multichannel, that was initially expected to launch in December 2007. However, 7HD became the first free-to-air commercial television channel introduced to metropolitan areas since 1988, when it launched prior on 15 October 2007, with &quot;25th Hour&quot; being the first programme broadcast at 10:30 pm.

On 14 February 2008, the Seven Media Group and Foxtel officially signed an agreement allowing Seven&#x27;s digital signal to be transmitted via Foxtel&#x27;s cable and satellite services. Seven became available on Foxtel in early 2009.

On 25 September 2009, Seven announced its new digital channel, 7two, which officially launched on 1 November 2009.

===2010s===
On 18 January 2010, Seven launched the online catch-up TV website called &quot;PLUS7&quot;.

On 25 September 2010, in conjunction with the 2010 AFL Grand Final, Seven launched its second multi-digital channel 7mate.

In January 2011, the big red 7 logos were expanded to GWN7 and Prime7&#x27;s rebranding respectively. The news bulletins were renamed as &quot;GWN7 News&quot; and &quot;Prime7 News&quot;. GWN and Prime relaunched on 16 January 2011 at 6:00 pm, digital channels are branded as &quot;7two&quot; and &quot;7mate&quot;.

Seven announced its intention to expand into digital datacasting known as 4ME, a digital channel owned by the Prime Media Group, in December 2011 on channel 64 in Prime7 and regional areas and channel 74 in other areas.

In September 2011, Seven broadcast a report featuring journalist Tim Noonan and writer and adventurer Paul Raffaele visiting Brazil&#x27;s Suruwaha tribe and describing them as child murderers, &quot;Stone Age&quot; relics, and &quot;one of the worst human rights violators in the world&quot;. Survival International, the global movement for tribal people&#x27;s rights, sent a complaint to Seven outlining the many errors and distortions in the report. After the channel refused to correct the inaccuracies in the program, Survival filed a complaint at the Australian Communications and Media Authority, who opened a formal investigation. In September 2012, the network was found guilty by the press regulator of serious violations of the broadcasting code. The ACMA ruled that the Channel was guilty of breaking its racism clause – having &quot;provoked or perpetuated intense dislike, serious contempt or severe ridicule against the Suruwaha people on the grounds of ... national or ethnic origin ... race [or] religion&quot;. It also ruled that the Channel was guilty of broadcasting inaccurate material. Seven sought judicial review, but in June 2014 the Federal Court upheld the ruling.

In October 2012, Seven began cost cutting shedding a number of behind the scenes technical positions and reducing their SNG transponder link capacity on Optus D1 from three (at 12.661,12.671&amp;12.681 GHz) to two (at 12.644&amp;12.653 GHz) which are used by ATN Sydney for Sunrise and national news location uplinks as well as for other local station location uplinks.

In November 2012, Seven changed its on-air theme. This included a new look for programme advisory ratings, programme listings and programme advertisements and promos.

As of 10 December 2013, Seven no longer broadcasts on analogue TV and is now only available through digital TV or digital set-top box.

On 26 June 2015, Racing.com began broadcasting on channel 78 as a joint venture between Seven West Media and Racing Victoria following a blackout of Victorian horse racing by Sky Racing. Initially broadcasting an interim live feed from the Racing.com website, the channel was officially launched on 29 August 2015.

In January 2016, Seven changed its on-air theme. This included a new look for program listings, program advertisements and promos.

On 7 February 2016, during the ad-break of &quot;Molly&quot;, after months of speculation, Seven officially announced their new channel as 7flix on channel 76. 7flix was launched at 6am on 28 February 2016.

7HD returned as a high definition simulcast on channel 70 on 10 May 2016. Initially, the Melbourne and Adelaide markets received 7HD as a HD simulcast of Seven&#x27;s primary channel, while the Sydney, Brisbane and Perth markets received 7HD as a HD simulcast of 7mate; this was to allow Australian Football League (AFL) matches to be broadcast in HD in those markets. Sydney, Brisbane and Perth temporarily received 7HD as a simulcast of the primary channel for the duration of the 2016 Summer Olympics before the change was made permanent during and after the 2017 Australian Open tennis. Up until 16 January 2020, breakaway programming was used to show further AFL matches and Australian cricket matches in HD.

In June 2017, following the acquisition of Yahoo! by Verizon Communications, Seven announced plans to launch a wholly owned standalone service to replace PLUS7. In September 2017, Seven announced the new service would be known as &quot;7plus&quot; and would launch in November 2017. As of September 2017, Seven&#x27;s live streaming service, now named 7Live, is no longer accessible from within the PLUS7 and the Yahoo7 portal.

Seven announced 7food network, a new digital channel, which launched on Channel 74 on 1 December 2018. The announcement with Discovery network follows SBS Food Network losing its deal with Discovery-owned Scripps Network. The channel ceased broadcast on 28 December 2019, just over a year since it launched, though Seven continues to utilise the Food Network branding elsewhere

===2020s===

In June 2020, &quot;Big Brother Australia&quot; made a return on the Seven Network with a rebooted program. Hosted by Sonia Kruger, the series was pre-recorded and not live as in previous series, with the new version of Big Brother described like a &quot;Survivor in a warehouse&quot;, with producers opting to film at a warehouse in Sydney. The exact location is North Head Sanctuary, also known as The Barracks. On the night Big Brother premiered, Seven also changed their on air theme.

On 19 June 2020, it was announced that &quot;The Daily Edition&quot; had been cancelled by the Seven Network after 7 years with hosts Sally Obermeder and Ryan Phelan leaving the network. The final episode aired on 26 June 2020.

In July 2020, the Seven Network unveiled new logos, for its multichannels, beginning with 7mate then 7two and 7flix respectively. The change in logos also included their on demand platform 7plus now stylised as ″7+″ as part of a major branding overhaul of its multi channel stations.

In March 2021, it was announced that the Seven Network would move out of Martin Place to Eveleigh by the end of 2022 after almost two decades.

On 1 November 2021, Seven West Media announced that it would acquire all the shares and subsidiaries of Prime Media Group. This was Seven West Media&#x27;s second attempt at purchasing Prime, after its previous attempt in 2019 was thwarted by Australian Community Media boss Antony Catalano and rival WIN Corporation owner Bruce Gordon, who cited Seven&#x27;s debt problems at the time and its poor ratings performance as their reason for their refusal. This development would mark an end to the Prime branding after 33 years in favour of Seven Network&#x27;s branding, and would see all news bulletins carry the Seven News brand. Prior to this, Prime7 (and sister GWN7 in regional and remote Western Australia) was the only network not to fully use its metro affiliate branding despite carrying Seven branded promos, since WIN Television (except for WIN News) and Southern Cross Austereo use full Nine and Ten network branding on their stations. It was also announced that Seven would look to expand its investment in local news following the merger. Majority of Prime&#x27;s shareholders voted in favour of the deal on 23 December, with the sale completed on 31 December.

Commencing June 2022, Seven moved to a national brand in time for the 2022 Commonwealth Games across all of its regions. Introduced to regional audiences on 6 June 2022, viewers in those markets began to see the Prime7 and GWN7 logos transition into the national Seven branding.

Seven announced in October 2022 it would launch a new free-to-air channel, 7Bravo on 15 January 2023, on LCN 75 in metropolitan areas and LCN 65 in regional areas. As a result ishop TV moved from LCN 65 to LCN 67 in the former Prime7 areas. 7Bravo shows reality shows and true crime. The launch is a partnership between Seven Network and NBCUniversal International Networks &amp; Direct-to-Consumer. 

On 30 November 2022, various channel changes on the Seven Network happened to accommodate for the new 7Bravo channel, including a 7mate SD (Channel 73) switch-off. On the same day, 7Bravo on channel 75 appeared on the Seven multiplex, and ishop TV moving to channel 67 placeholder in Seven regional areas.

In June 2023, 7NEWS moved their operations from Martin Place to their new purpose-built studios in Eveleigh. In July 2023, Sunrise hosted its first broadcast at its new studios. The first edition went to air live at 5.30am on 24 July 2023, with hosts Natalie Barr and Matt Shirvington, newsreader Edwina Bartholomew and sports presenter Mark Beretta, followed by The Morning Show&#x27;s Larry Emdur and Kylie Gillies. For the first time in more than 40 years, the whole Seven Sydney operation, including all staff, were under one roof. The new space offers space five times larger than the previous Martin Place location, with permanent sets for all programs.

In July–August 2023 when the 2023 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup was hosted by Australia and New Zealand, there was some controversy worldwide about broadcasting rights to it, when broadcasters&#x27; offers were very low, and FIFA&#x27;s handling of the rights was also criticised. The Seven Network won the rights to broadcast 15 of the matches. These included four round of 16 games, two quarter-finals, the semi-finals, and the final, along with all of the Matildas games. The pay channel Optus Sport has rights for every game in the tournament. This raised public criticism, with many arguing that the entire tournament should be free-to-air, as was the 2022 (men&#x27;s) World Cup in Qatar, on SBS Television.

In September 2023, a female Queensland contestant in an upcoming Seven Network reality show was charged with multiple counts of indecent treatment of children aged under 16, multiple counts of rape, sexual assault, torture and assaults over a 15-year period. Her partner was also charged with a number of assaults. Seven refused to confirm whether it will cancel or alter the program.

On 22 January 2024, TVSN and Seven West Media signed a new broadcast deal, which means the channel will be on Seven from 1 July 2024, shifting from 10 and WIN Television. TVSN will be on channel 77 in metropolitan areas and regional Queensland, channel 67 in other regional areas and on 7plus nationally.

On 14 April 2024, the network was under-fired for misidentification of Jewish student named Ben Cohen as the perpetrator of 2024 Bondi Junction stabbings

===Additional programs===
&quot;Always Greener&quot;, launched in 2001, received two million viewers in its Sunday timeslot, however, it was axed after its second season due to declining audience numbers.

In 2004, Seven launched the internationally well-known game show &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot; hosted by Andrew O&#x27;Keefe, to the 5.30 pm weekday timeslot as a lead-in to the networks&#x27; struggling flagship news bulletin replacing the network&#x27;s long-running and ever-popular &quot;Wheel Of Fortune&quot; as the show moves to 5pm weekdays, and later in the year &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, based on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, was also launched. The following year, a number of new programmes premiered, from the United States network ABC, including &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; and &quot;Lost&quot;. At the same time, Seven&#x27;s news and public affairs ratings began to increase in viewers, with &quot;Today Tonight&quot; beginning to challenge rival &quot;A Current Affair&quot;, with the new format of &quot;Sunrise&quot; leading to increased competition with its rival, the Nine Network&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot;. Seven&#x27;s evening news bulletins also started to take the lead with successes in most cities.

The network launched a number of new series in 2006, including &quot;Heroes&quot;, &quot;Prison Break&quot;, &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; spin-off &quot;It Takes Two&quot;, &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;, and &quot;My Name Is Earl&quot;, and saw long-running series &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; ending its 13th season run after declining ratings since late 2003. Despite the ongoing success of these programmes, Seven still finished second behind the Nine Network for the fifth time in six years, primarily due to Nine&#x27;s coverage of the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, but the year after, defeated Nine by a significant margin, winning 38 weeks compared to Nine&#x27;s 2, to become the number one network in Australia.

In 2008, Seven launched new local drama &quot;Packed to the Rafters&quot; which became the year&#x27;s top rating show with an average of 1.938 million viewers.

In 2009, a new weekly public affairs show &quot;Sunday Night&quot; launched in the Sunday 6:30 position to a shaky start but by the end of the year was easily winning its slot and rating up to 250,000 more than rival Nine Network&#x27;s long-running &quot;60 Minutes&quot;.

In 2010, Seven launched new AFL- and NRL-based entertainment shows in an effort to take on Nine&#x27;s &quot;The AFL Footy Show&quot; and &quot;The NRL Footy Show&quot; and provide a bargaining chip in negotiations for AFL and NRL broadcast rights. The AFL-based series was called &quot;The Bounce&quot;, hosted by Peter Helliar, however, was pulled from the air after just five episodes. An NRL-based series called &quot;The Matty Johns Show&quot;, hosted by former &quot;Footy Show&quot; host Matthew Johns, lasted one season.

In 2011, Seven put &quot;Packed to the Rafters&quot; on hiatus and put new Melbourne drama &quot;Winners and Losers&quot; in its place, the show won the highest ratings for the night.

In 2013, the Seven Network launched its fifth new drama &quot;A Place to Call Home&quot;, it also achieved high ratings.

In September 2015, the network began &quot;The Chase Australia&quot; which is a spinoff of the British series, &quot;The Chase&quot;, with Chasers Anne Hegerty (from the British series), Brydon Coverdale (winner of $307,000 on &quot;Million Dollar Minute&quot;), Matt Parkinson and Issa Schultz, In 2016, Mark Labbett made his debut as one of the Chasers, joining fellow UK Chaser, Anne Hegerty and in 2018, Shaun Wallace made his debut as its sixth chaser, joining fellow UK chasers Anne Hegerty and Mark Labbett. Seven also launched &quot;800 Words&quot; starring Erik Thomson to high ratings, making it the highest rating drama of 2015.

In June 2020, &quot;Big Brother Australia&quot; made a return on the Seven Network with a rebooted pre-recorded program. It was also announced in 2020, that Seven had acquired the reality series &quot;The Voice Australia&quot; in 2021 as well as a reboot of &quot;Australian Idol&quot;.

Seven confirmed in December 2020 it had commissioned a return to a new &quot;all stars&quot; event version of &quot;Dancing With The Stars&quot;.

The &quot;Australian Idol&quot; reboot would return to the screens of Seven in 2023.

==Programming==

New programs introduced in 2005 led to a ratings increase, following a relatively poor 2004.

From 2010, the Seven Network began to implement the tactic of creating a five to 20-minute delay in the scheduled start time of non-live programming after 7:30 pm in an attempt to minimise viewer channel surfing between prime-time shows. This is done by increasing the duration of the commercial breaks and then decreasing them once the prime-time period is over. This tactic not only disrupts viewer recordings of the shows, but has a dramatic effect on their regional affiliates such as Prime and Southern Cross who must adapt their inserted commercials breaks as the live play-out from Seven&#x27;s Melbourne facility occurs which can cause either both the regional station identification and the Seven identification being displayed with a possible black screen between them or the start of a program being missed entirely by the regional break overlapping.

===Local programs===

The network formerly broadcast catalogue movie and television titles from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer produced in the 1990s prior to 2011, Disney from 1980s to 2023 (now currently shared with 9Go!, 10 Peach and Disney+), Miramax from 2007 to 2012, DreamWorks from 2007 to 2015, and Paramount from the 1990s to 2022.

On 7two, in the early 2010s, they aired classic and silver-screen movies from the Sony Pictures (Columbia &amp; TriStar) catalog.

In 2018 it was reported that Seven had formed an agreement with 20th Century Fox to air selected Fox programming.

Previously, the network had output deals with Sony Pictures Television and NBCUniversal, however changed its deals with both in mid-2013. Seven renegotiated its NBCUniversal deal to continue rights to air existing popular NBC co-produced programs including &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; and &quot;Mrs Brown&#x27;s Boys&quot;, as well as NBC News content. Commiserate with the American network&#x27;s own slump, Seven has not found huge success with an NBC primetime series since 2007. With Sony, Seven has signed a three-year minimum quota deal, where by Seven will agree to purchase a set number of Sony produced US primetime series and selected films each year.

==News and current affairs==
The Seven Network&#x27;s news service is called &quot;Seven News&quot; (formerly &quot;Australian Television News (ATVN)&quot; and &quot;Seven National News&quot;). After trailing for many decades to &quot;Nine News&quot; (previously &quot;National Nine News&quot;) and &quot;10 News First&quot; (previously &quot;Ten Eyewitness News&quot;, &quot;Ten News at Five&quot;, &quot;Ten Evening News&quot; and &quot;Ten News: First at Five&quot;) in most markets, Seven rebounded effective from February 2005 onwards, and claimed to be Australia&#x27;s number one television news and current affairs service. &quot;Seven News&quot; produces &quot;Sunrise&quot;, &quot;The Morning Show&quot;, &quot;Weekend Sunrise&quot;, &quot;Seven Morning News&quot;, &quot;Seven Afternoon News&quot;, &quot;Seven News&quot; (the flagship locally produced 6 pm bulletins) and &quot;The Latest: Seven News&quot;. During the early hours of 4 am to 6 am, Seven rebroadcasts some of American television network NBC&#x27;s news and current affairs programming, including &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;Meet the Press&quot;. Since 1988, Seven also adopted NBC News&#x27; main theme, &quot;The Mission&quot;, as the theme for Seven&#x27;s news programming.

Exclusive contracts with NBC News, ITN and TV3 (New Zealand) for international news coverage.

In recent years, under the guidance of former long-time &quot;Nine News&quot; chief Peter Meakin, Seven&#x27;s news and current affairs division has produced more locally focused content, which has been lifting ratings for key markets such as Sydney and Melbourne. Since February 2005, the ratings of &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;, &quot;Seven News&quot; and &quot;Today Tonight&quot; have gradually increased. &quot;Seven News&quot; was the highest-rating news service nationally in both the 2005 and 2006 ratings seasons. A key aspect of Seven&#x27;s recent ratings dominance in news and current affairs has been attributed to &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;&#x27;s (and, since late 2015, &quot;The Chase Australia&quot;) top rating audience, which provides &quot;Seven News&quot; with a large lead-in audience. Between 2007 and 2010 inclusive, &quot;Seven News&quot; completed a clean sweep across the five capital cities in terms of being the most watched 6 pm news bulletin. On 5 July 2008, Channel Seven introduced a watermark on news and current affairs programmes.

On 25 January 2001, Network Ten, Nine Network, and pay TV provider Foxtel won the rights from Seven to televise AFL games from 2002 to 2006. This ended Seven&#x27;s famous 45-year run as the exclusive AFL football broadcaster. On 5 January 2006 the Australian Football League accepted a bid from Seven and Ten to broadcast AFL games from 2007 to 2011 at a cost of A$780 million. Since 2011, Seven has been the exclusive free-to-air broadcaster of the AFL Premiership Season to at least 2031.

Seven had exclusive Australian free-to-air, pay television, online and mobile telephony broadcast rights to the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. The live telecast of the XXIX Olympiad was shared by both the Seven Network and SBS Television. Seven broadcast the opening and closing ceremonies and mainstream sports including swimming, athletics, rowing, cycling and gymnastics. In stark contrast, SBS TV provided complementary coverage focused on long-form events such as soccer, road cycling, volleyball, and table tennis.

From 2016, Seven became the home of the Summer Olympic Games, Winter Olympic Games and the Summer Paralympic Games. The Network secured the Australian broadcast rights to the Olympic Games. In October 2020, it was named as the Australian broadcast service for the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.

The Seven Network also screened the 2018 Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast in April 2018, and the 2022 Commonwealth Games from Birmingham.

In 2018, the Seven Network, in conjunction with Foxtel, acquired free-to-air broadcasting rights to cricket in Australia. This ended Nine&#x27;s famous 45-year run as the exclusive cricket broadcaster and Ten&#x27;s five-year run as the exclusive Big Bash League broadcaster. The network will televise all men&#x27;s international tests matches, 43 Big Bash League Matches, all women&#x27;s Internationals (T20Is, ODIs and Tests) and 23 Women&#x27;s Big Bash League Matches. The six-year deal starts in 2018/19 and runs until 2023/24. In 2023, Seven announced that it reached an agreement with Cricket Australia to extend its media rights from the 2024-25 season to the 2030-31 season. The new, seven-year agreement between Seven and Cricket Australia includes two Ashes Tests Series as well as two Indian tours of Australia. In addition, Cricket Australia will revamp the BBL to create a shorter tournament that will run for five to six weeks to screen on the Seven network.

In 2020, Seven regained the TV rights to the Supercars Championship, sharing the rights with Foxtel in a deal worth $200 million for 5 years (2021–2025).

The revival version initially broadcast split services: identical main channel programming for Melbourne and Adelaide &amp; continuous programming from 7mate for other metropolitan cities, but in 1080i MPEG-4 HD via Freeview. The split was implemented to allow broadcast of AFL matches in HD. By 16 December 2016, it quietly shifted to the main channel programming on a long-term basis for Sydney, Brisbane and Perth.

====7plus====

It offers on demand episodes of television series and a live streaming service providing live access to Seven, 7two, 7mate, 7flix, 7Bravo and Racing.com.

Following the acquisition of Yahoo! by Verizon Communications in June 2017, Seven announced plans to launch a wholly owned standalone service to replace PLUS7 within the following six months. In September 2017, Seven announced the new service would be known as 7plus and would launch in November 2017.

The service is available in HD, and there are plans to add Chromecast and Apple Airplay support at a later date.

AFL Premiership Season and Cricket matches are not accessible through the 7plus live streaming service due to the digital broadcast rights being owned by Telstra Media and Kayo Sports respectively. &quot;Border Security International&quot; repeats play on the channel&#x27;s live stream in the event&#x27;s place until the match is over and then returns to normal programming.

On 23 July 2020, 7plus introduced a new logo styled as 7+.

===Past===
====PLUS7====

PLUS7 was a catch up TV service run by the Seven Network through its Yahoo7 joint venture with Yahoo!. The service became available on 18 January 2010.

The channel marked the start of Seven&#x27;s new deal with Discovery, Inc., immediately after the end of SBS&#x27;s previous deal with Discovery which saw the creation of SBS Food (formerly SBS Food Network) in 2015. The channel featured shows about food and cooking from around the world. The channel ceased broadcasting on 28 December 2019 after garnering lower than expected ratings and was replaced by a HD simulcast of &quot;7mate&quot; from 16 January 2020.

==Logo and identity history==

The network&#x27;s first logo produced and used across the metropolitan stations in the early 1970s featured the numeral seven inside a ring (similar to the Circle 7 logo used mostly by the American Broadcasting Company for its owned-and-operated stations which ATN-7 used from 1968 to 1969). However, in some states from as early back as 1967 the &quot;Seven eye&quot; appeared and continued right through to 1975. Colour television was introduced across the network and the country on 1 March 1975, along with a new logo incorporating a bright ring of the colours of the visual light spectrum. This logo was used nationally until 23 January 1989, when the recently renamed Seven Network introduced a new red logo with the circle modified to incorporate the &quot;7&quot; (similar to the logo then used by WJLA-TV in Washington). The new logo was rolled out along with evening soap &quot;Home and Away&quot; and a relaunched &quot;Seven Nightly News&quot; (later to become &quot;Seven News&quot;).

The current ribbon logo designed by Cato Brand Partners was launched to coincide with the new millennium celebration on 1 January 2000 and the 2000 Summer Olympics held in Sydney. The ribbon logo was used between 2000 and 2003 in five colour variants: red, orange, yellow, green and blue, to symbolise &quot;passion&quot;, &quot;involving&quot;, &quot;fun&quot;, &quot;life&quot; and &quot;energy&quot; respectively and represents the five stations of the network. The logo was simplified in 2003, effectively becoming simply two angled trapezoids, losing its gradient, shadows and colour-coded usages to become solid red but first it was used in solid white as an on-screen bug from 2000. In 2012, the Seven logo was slightly modified with the shape of it remaining the same, the upper right corner was lighter red than the remaining logo. On 1 February 2016, it reverted to red trapezoids.

== Slogans ==

The Seven Network&#x27;s TV ad campaigns tended to follow NBC (mostly due to Seven&#x27;s semi-close ties with the American network), but at times also used some imaging from fellow US networks ABC and FOX.

<text>Wah Yan College, Hong Kong also referred to by its acronym WYHK, is a Catholic all-boys grant-in-aid secondary education institution run by the Society of Jesus in Wan Chai, Hong Kong. It was founded by on 16 December 1919. It was a non-sectarian school when it was founded, and the Jesuits took over the operation of the school in 1932.

Subsidised by the Government of Hong Kong, WYCHK is a grammar school using English as the medium of instruction (except the subjects Chinese and Chinese History). There are around 60 teachers and 800 students. It is a sister school of Wah Yan College, Kowloon.

The school has an enrolment of approximately 800 students with 60 teachers and a few Irish Jesuit fathers. The supervisor of the school is Rev. Fr. Clement Tsui, S.J., who is an alumnus of the school and a Roman Catholic Jesuit priest, and serves concurrently as Rector of Wan Yan College Chapel, located within the campus under the parish of St. Margaret&#x27;s Church near Leighton Hill. The current principal of the school is Dr. Davis Chan, the second alumnus of St. Joseph&#x27;s College, Hong Kong to become the principal of the college after the founder Mr. Peter Tsui Yan Sau.

==History==
===Chronology===
====The beginnings====
The school was founded by Peter Tsui Yan Sau on 16 December 1919 on the 3rd and 4th floors of 60 Hollywood Road, which houses the Kung-Lee sugar cane juice store (公利真料竹蔗水) and is listed as a Grade II Historic Building. On the first day of school there were only four students. In subsequent years, the school also used 54A Peel Street and 33 Mosque Junction as campuses. As the number of students rose, the school moved to a new campus at 2 Robinson Road (the present site of Bishop Lei Int&#x27;l House and Raimondi College) after Lunar New Year 1921. On 1 October 1922, the school was listed as a Grant-in-aid school. In 1924, a Kowloon branch was established in Mongkok. A hostel in Wah Yan opened in 1927. That same year the first Irish Jesuit Fr John Neary came to Wah Yan and taught religious studies.

====Wah Yan under the Irish Jesuits====

In 1932 the school was transferred to the Society of Jesus, after a long series of negotiations between the original administration and the Jesuit fathers. The transfer was completed on 31 December, and Fr Gallagher, S.J., replaced Lim Hoi Lan as the headmaster. The school was also given a new name: College of Christ the King.

In 1933, the college published the first volume of its yearbook, &quot;The Star&quot;. A house system was introduced in 1934. In 1940 the hostel was closed down.

====Wartime Wah Yan====
In December 1941, with the invasion of Hong Kong by Japanese troops, classes were suspended. Fr Gallagher and Fr McAsey were interned by the Japanese.

During the War, Wah Yan continued operations in Macau for a period of time.

There was another Wah Yan set up during the occupation (called &quot;Wah Yan Chung Hok&quot;, meaning &quot;Wah Yan middle school&quot;) but it closed down shortly before the war ended.

====Post-war development====
After the Japanese troops surrendered, the school reopened on 8 September 1945. Later in the year, Wah Yan Middle School was re-established as the Chinese stream of the school. In March 1946, the Wah Yan Dramatic Society, consisting mainly of alumni of the school and Wah Yan College, Kowloon, commenced activities, and was officially founded the following year. Its first production was &quot;The Thrice Promised Bride&quot;.

A night school was started on 17 February 1948. The next year, an afternoon school opened. In 1950 the Chinese stream of the school was closed down.

In 1951, the classes were renamed &quot;forms&quot;: Class 1 became Form 6, Class 2 became Form 5, and so on. Class 7 and Class 8 were renamed Primary 6 and 5 respectively.

In 1952 the afternoon school was also closed.

====Queens Road East &quot;Mount Parish&quot; era====
In 1954, construction for a new campus at Mount Parish, Wan Chai started. On 27 September 1955 the new campus was formally opened by Sir Alexander Grantham, then Governor of Hong Kong.

The school newspaper, &quot;Starlet&quot;, was established in 1964. In 1971, Wah Yan College, Hong Kong helped to manage the then Pun U Primary School while the Pun U Association remaining the school sponsoring body. The primary school was renamed Pun U Association Wah Yan Primary School, and was established as the feeder primary school. The night school was closed in 1984. The streaming to Arts and Science began in Form 4 in 1986.

On 12 April 1987, the Gordon Wu Hall to the north of the main building was opened. In the same year, Wah Yan achieved its first &quot;10 A&#x27;s&quot; in the HKCEE examinations.

On 8 May 1992, heavy rainfall caused a severe landslide at the junction of Kennedy Road and Queen&#x27;s Road East. It killed the driver of a passing car. The landslide caused the laboratory block to sink. Cracks were found in the playground and a crack in the classroom block had to be covered with stainless steel plates. Six classrooms (2H, 2K, 4H, 4K, 6S2, 7A) were demolished in 1993 as a result of the landslide. They were rebuilt and were reopened in 1998. The same year, three Wah Yan students achieved &quot;10 As&quot; in the HKCEE.

The first version of the school website was set up by Dr Ashley Cheng in 1994. In 1997, the Parent-Teacher Association was established. In 1998, all classrooms were fitted with air-conditioning.

====School development project====
There had been plans to redevelop the school since 1995. However, the initial plans were aborted due to lack of funds and local law restrictions on architecture. In 2001 the Education and Manpower Bureau planned to upgrade all existing schools in Hong Kong to millennium standard, and the college successfully applied for part of the necessary funds for redevelopment. The School Development Project (SDP) was formally launched on 26 January 2003, and works were officially started on 25 May 2003 with the demolition of the old music room block.

The original aims of the SDP were to:
*Upgrade the school campus to millennium standards
*Provide extra classrooms required by the &quot;through-train&quot; education mode
*Construct a new assembly hall that can accommodate all students at the same time

The total cost of the SDP was estimated to be HK$104m. It was to be carried out in three phases:
*Rebuilding the existing music room into a 6-storey multi-use complex. The cost was HK$38.9m.
*Extension of Phase 1. The cost was HK$4.82m.
*Rebuilding the hall. This phase has yet to be completed and the cost is estimated to be HK$57m.

Funding for Phase 1 is by the Hong Kong Government&#x27;s Quality Education Fund and the School Improvement Programme. Funding for Phases 2 and 3 are by fund-raising campaigns hosted by the school.

Phases 1 and 2 (New Annex) have already been completed and were formally opened on 31 January 2006 by Mr Donald Tsang, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong. Phase III consists of a new school hall annexe with a much larger hall that can accommodate all the students in the school. The annexe will also house five extra classrooms and a lecture theatre.

Phase III was originally estimated to be completed by December 2006; however, lack of funds greatly delayed the completion time. In the summer of 2011, works for Phase III finally started while fund-raising was still in progress. The old school hall has already been demolished. In 2014, the new Wu Jieh Yee Building housing the school hall was finished.

===Achievements===

*WYHK counts five winners of the Hong Kong Outstanding Students Awards, ranking 16th (tied with La Salle College, Madam Lau Kam Lung Secondary School of MFBM, and Queen Elizabeth School) among all secondary schools in Hong Kong.
*The Red Cross cadet group of the college has secured first place in the annual drill competition for 7 years consecutively since 2003.
*Wah Yan College, Hong Kong&#x27;s Scout Group (15th Hong Kong Group) won the prestigious Carlton Trophy in 1982, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1994, 1996, 2004, 2008 and 2024.
*In 2007 the student organisation of the college participated in the Lunar New Year Stall Competition co-organised by Shell and the Hong Kong Youth Federation and won the grand prize of $10,000.

==Campus==
The campus at 281 Queens Road East, Wan Chai has an area of about 20,000 m2 (220,000 square feet), located on a small hill known as Mount Parish. It was designed by the late Professor Gordon Brown, the founder of the Architecture Faculty of Hong Kong University.

==Principals==
==Academics==
===New senior secondary curriculum===
Since the academic year of 2009–2010, the school has provided a new curriculum for senior students alongside the planned educational reform by the Hong Kong Government.

The HKDSE subjects that are now offered are Chinese Language, English Language, Mathematics, Liberal Studies, Chinese History, Economics, Ethics and Religious Studies, Geography, History, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, &#x27;Business, Accounting &amp; Financial Studies&#x27;, Music, and &#x27;Information &amp; Communication Technology&#x27;.

Music, Art, Ignatian Value Education, and also Religious Formation, Life Education or Moral &amp; Civic Education will be offered as non-examination subjects.

===Studying overseas===
School statistics show that many of its students participate in overseas exchange programmes organised and subsidised by the school. Many go on to further their studies overseas on a more permanent basis. The most popular destinations are the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada. To assist such students, teachers of the Careers and Further Studies Committee write reference letters and testimonials. The chairwoman of the committee is Miss H.W. Ng, also the chairwoman of the BAFS panel. Wah Yan also has a Post-secondary Education Trust Fund. Six scholarships and grants, each worth more than HK$300,000 per year &quot;(or up to HK$1,200,000 per grant)&quot;, are awarded to suitable Wah Yan students for overseas undergraduate studies every year.

The SA allows the students to participate in the administration of the school in matters concerning their welfare. The primary function of the SA is the organisation and co-ordination of all students; and arrangement of extra-curricular activities in the school.

In the year 2020–21, two cabinet (Novus and Contineo) arose to compete for being the SA. Eventually, Novus won the election by 325 supporting vote, against Contineo&#x27;s 152 supporting votes, becoming the SA of the next academic year.

The Prefects&#x27; main duties include maintaining discipline at school and promoting harmony among students. Prefects&#x27; Board runs a committee system directed under the Head Prefect. The board is also responsible for co-ordinating all internal and external functions held by the school. Every year, approximately 70 prefects are divided into five groups, each with their respective group leaders. Prefects have rights to issue warning slips according to the seriousness of the offence.

There are 1–2 development workshops each school year, aiming to enhance the readiness and qualities of prefects. Before summer, there is also a Prefect Training Camp, to prepare Probationary Prefects and the new cabinet of committee members for the challenges they will face in the upcoming school year.

Wah Yan Star Studio is the college&#x27;s campus TV team. The team handles all audio-visual matters throughout the school year including assemblies and other school events. The team is also responsible for recording the school events and publishing the video recording or describing the events. The team is also free to record and publish interesting videos/dramas filmed by themselves, much like a TV station. All the videos are published online.

The team is considered a school organization and is not interfered by the Student Association.

===Houses===
There are four houses in Wah Yan. Each house has their own colour.
Students entering the school are each allocated permanently into one of the four houses, based on which class the student is allocated to. Loyola house members are assigned to class 1W, Kostka house members to 1Y, Xavier members to 1H, and Berchmans to 1K. Students are mixed up into different classes the following year.

==Students&#x27; awards==

One of them will also be selected as the Student Ambassador who will visit an overseas chapter of the Alumni Association together with the representative from Wah Yan College Kowloon during the summer vacation preceding secondary 6. Until 2011, secondary 6 students competed for the award. In 2011, 3 secondary 5 students taking the first HKDSE and 3 secondary 6 students sitting the last HKALE in 2012 were elected students of the year and one from each group was chosen as the Ambassador.

Notable past winners include Godfrey Lam, currently a Judge of the Court of First Instance of the Hong Kong High Court, and Godwin Leung, a prominent cardiologist in Hong Kong.

To date, 5 students have been awarded the Hong Kong Outstanding Students Awards.

==School symbols==
===School song===
The school song was composed around 1960 by Sr. Carmela Santos, a Sister of St Paul de Chartres (SPC) originally from the Philippines. The lyrics were written by Fr. Patrick McGovern, S.J., who was a teacher in Wah Yan and then a member of the Legislative Council.

===School seal===
The seal of the school is divided into four quarters by a cross in red, set on a blue background. The cross symbolises the love of Jesus Christ for mankind, and the blue background symbolises the sea which surrounds Hong Kong. Five stars are set on the badge, one in each quarter and the remaining one is at the centre of the cross. According to the school, the stars symbolise either the ideas of virtue, wisdom, sportsmanship, co-operation and elegance (), or the ideas of benevolence, justice, courtesy, wisdom and faith ().

== Attempt to switch to DSS system ==

The school administration spent nearly three years exploring the idea of joining the &quot;Direct Subsidy Scheme&quot;, including a rigorous nine-month consultation of stakeholders. This consultation showed strong support for the scheme among parents and alumni while teachers were evenly split on the issue. The Society of Jesus decided to apply for the school to join the scheme in January 2018. The Education Bureau rejected the application.

As a result, the number of secondary 1 places reserved for graduates of the feeder school, Pun U Association Wah Yan Primary School(&quot;PUWY&quot;), will remain at 79. The top 79 primary 6 students will be guaranteed places. PUWY Students may also apply for discretionary places but must go through the same procedures as candidates from other schools.

==Bombs found==
Two bombs, home-made IEDs, were found by a janitor and deactivated by police at the school on 9 December 2019, probably linked to the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests. They contained about of two different types of explosives. One 20-year-old student was arrested in connection with the incident and charged with possession of firearms and public order offences. The suspect was released on bail pending trial. He attempted to flee to Taiwan but was later caught by the Chinese Public Security officers in the South China Sea along with 11 other people prosecuted by Hong Kong authorities for offences under the Hong Kong National Security Law.

<doc id="494664" wikidata="Q235759" url="?curid=494664" title="Ruth Prawer Jhabvala">
<text>Ruth Prawer Jhabvala (; 7 May 19273 April 2013) was a British and American novelist and screenwriter. She is best known for her collaboration with Merchant Ivory Productions, made up of film director James Ivory and producer Ismail Merchant.

In 1951, she married Indian architect Cyrus Jhabvala and moved to New Delhi. She began then to elaborate her experiences in India and wrote novels and tales on Indian subjects. She wrote a dozen novels, 23 screenplays, and eight collections of short stories and was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the Diplomatic Service and Overseas List of the 1998 New Years Honours and granted a joint fellowship by BAFTA in 2002 with Ivory and Merchant. She is the only person to have won both a Booker Prize and an Oscar.

==Early life==
Ruth Prawer was born in Cologne, Germany to Jewish parents Marcus and Eleanora (Cohn) Prawer. Marcus was a lawyer who moved to Germany from Poland to escape conscription and Eleanora&#x27;s father was cantor of Cologne&#x27;s largest synagogue. Her father was accused of communist links, arrested and released, and she witnessed the violence unleashed against the Jews during the Kristallnacht. The family was among the last group of refugees to flee the Nazi regime in 1939, emigrating to Britain. Her elder brother, Siegbert Salomon Prawer (1925–2012), an expert on Heinrich Heine and horror films, was fellow of The Queen&#x27;s College and Taylor Professor of German Language and Literature at the University of Oxford.

During World War II, Prawer lived in Hendon in London, experienced the Blitz and began to speak English rather than German. Charles Dickens&#x27; works and Margaret Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; kept her company through the war years, and she read the latter book while taking refuge in air raid shelters during the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s bombing of London. She became a British citizen in 1948. The following year, her father committed suicide after discovering that 40 members of his family had been murdered during the Holocaust. Prawer attended Hendon County School (now Hendon School) and then Queen Mary College, where she received an MA in English literature in 1951.

== Literary career ==

=== Years in India ===
Ruth Prawer moved to India in 1951 after marrying Indian Parsi architect Cyrus Jhabvala. Her first novel, &quot;To Whom She Will&quot;, was published in 1955. It was followed by &quot;Esmond in India&quot; (1957), &quot;The Householder&quot; (1960) and &quot;Get Ready for Battle&quot; (1963). &quot;The Householder&quot;, with a screenplay by Jhabvala, was filmed in 1963 by Merchant and Ivory. During her years in India, she wrote scripts for the Merchant-Ivory duo for &quot;The Guru&quot; (1969) and &quot;Autobiography of a Princess&quot; (1975). She collaborated with Ivory for the screenplays for &quot;Bombay Talkie&quot; (1970) and &quot;ABC After-school Specials: William - The Life and Times of William Shakespeare&quot; (1973).

In 1975, she won the Booker Prize for her novel &quot;Heat and Dust&quot;, later adapted into a film. That year, she moved to New York where she wrote &quot;The Place of Peace&quot;. Her husband also moved to US permanently in late 1980s, and the couple lived on the east coast until Ruth&#x27;s death in 2013. Cyrus Jhabwala died in Los Angeles in 2014. 

Jhabvala &quot;remained ill at ease with India and all that it brought into her life.&quot; She wrote in an autobiographical essay, &quot;Myself in India&quot; (published in &quot;London Magazine&quot;) that she found the &quot;great animal of poverty and backwardness&quot; made the idea and sensation of India intolerable to her, a &quot;Central European with an English education and a deplorable tendency to constant self-analysis.&quot; Her early works in India dwell on the themes of romantic love and arranged marriages and are portraits of the social mores, idealism and chaos of the early decades of independent India. Writing about her in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, novelist Pankaj Mishra observed that &quot;she was probably the first writer in English to see that India&#x27;s Westernizing middle class, so preoccupied with marriage, lent itself well to Jane Austenish comedies of manners.&quot;

=== Life in the United States ===
Jhabvala moved to New York City in 1975 and lived there until her death in 2013, becoming a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1986. She continued to write and many of her works including &quot;In Search of Love and Beauty&quot; (1983), &quot;Three Continents&quot; (1987), &quot;Shards of Memory&quot; (1995) and &quot;East into Upper East: Plain Tales From New York and New Delhi&quot; (1998) portray the lives and predicaments of immigrants from post-Nazi and post-World War Europe. Many of these works feature India as a setting where her characters go in search of spiritual enlightenment only to emerge defrauded and exposed to the materialistic pursuits of the East. The &quot;New York Times Review of Books&quot; chose her &quot;Out of India&quot; (1986) as one of the best reads for that year. In 1984, she was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship.

In 2005 she published &quot;My Nine Lives: Chapters of a Possible Past&quot; with illustrations by her husband and the book was described as &quot;her most autobiographical fiction to date&quot;.

=== Reception ===
Her literary works were well received, with C. P. Snow, Rumer Godden and V. S. Pritchett describing her work as &quot;the highest art&quot;, &quot;a balance between subtlety, humour and beauty&quot; and as being Chekhovian in its detached sense of comic self-delusion. Salman Rushdie described her as a &quot;rootless intellectual&quot; when he anthologized her in the &quot;Vintage Book of Indian Writing&quot;, and John Updike described her an &quot;initiated outsider&quot;.

Jhabvala initially was assumed to be an Indian among the reading public because of her perceptive portrayals of the nuances of Indian lifestyles. Later, the revelation of her true identity led to falling sales of her books in India and made her a target of accusations about &quot;her old-fashioned colonial attitudes&quot;.

Jhabvala&#x27;s last published story was &quot;The Judge&#x27;s Will&quot;, which appeared in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; on 25 March 2013.

==Merchant Ivory Productions==

In 1963, Jhabvala was approached by James Ivory and Ismail Merchant to write a screenplay for their debut &quot;The Householder&quot;, based on her 1960 novel. During their first encounter, Merchant later said Jhabvala, seeking to avoid them, pretended to be the housemaid when they visited. The film, released by Merchant Ivory Productions in 1963 and starring Shashi Kapoor and Leela Naidu, met with critical praise and marked the beginning of a partnership that resulted in over 20 films.

&quot;The Householder&quot; was followed by &quot;Shakespeare Wallah&quot; (1965), another critically acclaimed film. There followed a series of films, including &quot;Roseland&quot; (1977), &quot;Hullabaloo Over Georgie and Bonnie&#x27;s Pictures&quot; (1978), &quot;The Europeans&quot; (1979), &quot;Jane Austen in Manhattan&quot; (1980), &quot;Quartet&quot; (1981), &quot;The Courtesans of Bombay&quot; (1983) and &quot;The Bostonians&quot; (1984). The Merchant Ivory production of &quot;Heat and Dust&quot; in 1983 won Jhabvala a BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay the following year.

She won her first Academy Award for her screenplay for &quot;A Room with a View&quot; (1986) and won a second in the same category for &quot;Howards End&quot; six years later. She was nominated for a third Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay the following year for &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot;.

Her other films with Merchant and Ivory include &quot;Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bridge&quot; (1990), &quot;Jefferson in Paris&quot; (1995), &quot;Surviving Picasso&quot; (1996), &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Daughter Never Cries&quot; (1998) (the screenplay for which she co-authored with Ivory), &quot;The Golden Bowl&quot; (2000) and &quot;The City of Your Final Destination&quot; (2009), adapted from the eponymous novel by Peter Cameron and was her last screenplay. &quot;Le Divorce&quot; which she co-wrote with Ivory was the last movie that featured the trio of Merchant, Ivory and Jhabvala.

In an interview for the British Film Institute, British actor James Wilby claimed that Jhabvala refused to write the screenplay of the 1987 film &quot;Maurice&quot; despite being &quot;the normal writer&quot; for Merchant-Ivory films. Wilby surmised that Jhabvala may have been uncomfortable with the central subject matter of the film, based on a posthumously published novel by E. M. Forster, which depicted a gay relationship set in Edwardian England. Ivory was reportedly &quot;quite upset&quot; by Jhabvala&#x27;s decision, given the fact that their friendship was &quot;incredibly close.&quot; For her own part, Jhabvala apparently did provide notes for &quot;Maurice&quot;, but claimed she didn&#x27;t wish to write the screenplay&quot;,&quot; as the novel was &quot;sub-Forster and sub-Ivory.&quot;

The Merchant-Ivory duo was acknowledged by the Guinness Book of World Records as the longest collaboration between a director and a producer, but Jhabvala was a part of the trio from the very beginning. She introduced the composer Richard Robbins, who went on to score music for almost every production by Merchant-Ivory beginning with &quot;The Europeans&quot; in 1979, to the duo after meeting him while he was the director of Mannes College of Music, New York. &quot;Madame Sousatzka&quot; (1988) was the one film she wrote that was not produced by Merchant-Ivory.

==Personal life==
In 1951, Prawer married Cyrus Shavaksha Hormusji Jhabvala, an Indian Parsi architect and, later, head of the School of Planning and Architecture, New Delhi. The couple moved into a house in Delhi&#x27;s Civil Lines where they raised three daughters: Ava, Firoza and Renana. In 1975, Jhabvala moved to New York and divided her time between India and the United States. In 1986, she became a naturalized citizen of the United States.

===Death===
Jhabvala died in her home in New York City on 3 April 2013 at the age of 85. James Ivory reported that her death was caused by complications from a pulmonary disorder. Reacting to her death, Merchant Ivory Productions said that Jhabvala had &quot;been a beloved member of the Merchant Ivory family since 1960, comprising one-third of our indomitable trifecta that included director James Ivory and the late producer Ismail Merchant&quot; and that her death was &quot;a significant loss to the global film community&quot;.

<text>NXE Australia Pty Ltd, trading as the Foxtel Group, is an Australian pay television company that operates cable television, direct broadcast satellite television, and IPTV streaming services. It was formed in April 2018, superseding an earlier company from 1995. The service was established as a 50/50 joint venture between News Corp&#x27;s Australian subsidiary (which holds a controlling 65% stake) and Telstra (which holds the remaining 35%). It shares many features with the Sky service in the UK and Ireland — including the iQ box, the electronic programme guide, a similar remote control, and Red Button Active.

==History==

In 1995, a venture between News Corporation (in particular 20th Century Fox Media) and Telstra took place whereby Telstra would transmit a TV signal through its coaxial network and News Corporation would be the basis for offering channel negotiations and connections. Foxtel was formed (&quot;Fox&quot; representing News Corporation&#x27;s Fox and &quot;Tel&quot; representing Telstra). On 23 October 1995, Foxtel commenced a 20 channel service, delivered over the Telstra Hybrid Fibre Coaxial network.

In May 1998, Australis Media, the owner of a satellite television service known as Galaxy, was declared insolvent. In June 1998, Foxtel was able to significantly boost its customer base by acquiring Galaxy subscribers from the liquidator of Australis Media and immediately commenced supplying programming to Galaxy&#x27;s subscribers on an interim basis. In February 1999, Foxtel began offering its own satellite service to new customers.

Publishing &amp; Broadcasting Limited bought half of News Corporation&#x27;s shares in October 1998, giving each quarter ownership.

In 2002, a Content Sharing Agreement between Foxtel and Optus Television was approved by the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission (ACCC).

On 11 July 2011, Austar announced that &quot;it had entered into definitive transaction agreements with Liberty Global, Inc. (LGI) and Foxtel Management Pty Limited (Foxtel) under which Foxtel would acquire Austar by a series of transactions including a scheme of arrangement (Scheme).&quot; This takeover involved a minority shareholder approval on 30 March 2012, the approval of the ACCC on 10 April 2012, and has had approval from a Second Court Hearing. Austar shares were suspended from the ASX on 16 April 2012 and delisted on 27 April 2012. The takeover was completed on 24 May 2012.

News Corporation acquired Consolidated Media Holdings in November 2012, bringing its stake in Foxtel to 50%, up from 25%. On 15 June 2015, Foxtel officially agreed to buyout 15% shares in Ten Network Holdings, subject to approval from the ACCC. Prior to the acquisition, Discovery backed out from bidding partnership with Foxtel. Ten was later fully acquired by American media group CBS Corporation (now Paramount) in 2017.

In June 2017, Foxtel announced that it would be undergoing a major rebrand – the first in its 22-year history – as part of a move to convey an image that &quot;Foxtel is for everyone&quot;. The former logo (inspired from the American Fox network&#x27;s 1996–present logo), described by the company as &quot;quite aggressive, quite arrogant, quite elitist&quot;, would be replaced with an all lowercase logo, and its Foxtel Play service would rebranded to Foxtel Now.

On 6 March 2018, News Corp Australia announced a merger of Fox Sports Australia with Foxtel (co-owned by News Corp Australia and Telstra). News Corp owns a 65 percent stake in the combined entity, with Telstra owning 35 percent. The combining of the two businesses places emphasis on live-streaming sports and entertainment.

On 4 May 2020, it was announced that Foxtel would be closing down its owned &amp; operated music video networks and replacing them with a new suite of MTV, Nick and CMT-branded channels, as part of a wider deal with Paramount.

On 26 February 2022, Foxtel suspended broadcast distribution of the Russian television network RT in Australia. In September 2022, Foxtel extended their partnership with WWE to become Australia&#x27;s exclusive home of WWE. Foxtel is to relocate WWE Network into Foxtel&#x27;s Binge streaming service in January 2023, following the launch of its dedicated linear TV channel in December 2022.

In August 2024, it was reported that News Corp Australia was pursuing a sale of Foxtel, citing third-party interest in the division during a strategic review of its assets. The sale also came amid trends towards cord-cutting and free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) services, and major cuts to News Corp Australia&#x27;s publishing businesses amid declining advertising revenue. An initial suitor was American private equity firm Platinum Equity, but it was later reported that British sports streaming company DAZN was in active negotiations. On 23 December 2024, DAZN announced that it would acquire Foxtel, in a transaction valuing the company at $3.4 billion. As part of the sale, News Corp Australia and Telstra will take 6% and 3% minority stakes in DAZN. The acquisition is expected to be completed in mid-2025.

==Ratings==
Foxtel grew rapidly in 2007, with most of Foxtel&#x27;s highest-ever rating events being broadcast that year, including the 2007 AFC Asian Cup quarter-final between Australia and Japan, which drew an average of 419,000 viewers, an Australian pay television record at that time. This ratings record has since been eclipsed by the 2011 Rugby World Cup on Fox Sports 1 averaging around 500,000 viewers, which was smashed by the 2012 London Olympics Coverage, broadcast on 8 dedicated channels in both HD and SD formats, which saw an average of 946,432 viewers tuning in on the opening weekend, with around 600,000 to 700,000 viewers nightly thereafter.

As of 2012, Fox Sports channels, particularly Fox Footy, average between 90,000 and 300,000 + viewers for NRL/AFL matches throughout the week.
The highest-rated light entertainment shows are &quot;The Simpsons&quot; most weeknights on FOX8 with around 110,000 viewers, as well as Family Guy with around 70,000 viewers. A&amp;E has also recorded healthy audience numbers for its TruTV and A&amp;E US syndicated shows from the US – Pawn Stars (85,000), Hardcore Pawn (85,000), and Storage Wars (90,000). BBC UKTV also consistently rates well with British soaps EastEnders (80,000) and Coronation Street (65,000). The LifeStyle channel has experienced audiences in excess of 100,000 people for its Premiere shows Location Location Location Australia, Grand Designs Australia, Selling Houses Australia, Disney Channel (Australia) and The Real Housewives of Melbourne brings strong ratings.

==Availability==
Foxtel transmitted its cable service via Telstra hybrid fibre-coaxial (HFC) cable into the Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth metropolitan areas, along with the Gold Coast. Foxtel now also transmits its satellite service into these cities as well as all over Australia, including regional areas since the takeover of Austar. Previous Austar customers are now 100% Foxtel customers with the conversion from Austar to Foxtel in regional Australia now complete. Foxtel on Mobile launched on Telstra&#x27;s Next G Network in late 2006 and is now available within Telstra Next G (HSDPA/850 MHz) coverage areas, which covers 99% of the population.

With the transfer in ownership of Telstra&#x27;s HFC network to NBN Co for the provision of broadband services, Foxtel announced in 2022 that it would be abandoning HFC in favour of satellite and IPTV services. The transition was completed in 2023, after which no Foxtel services have been provided via HFC, thus making NBN&#x27;s HFC network all-IP, solely carrying DOCSIS services.

Telstra&#x27;s network and Foxtel were created to combat the threat posed to Telstra&#x27;s local call business by the combination of Optus Television content bundling with Optus&#x27; local telephony services; Foxtel was the content arm of Telstra&#x27;s defence strategy, while Telstra&#x27;s multimedia broadband network was originally the sole delivery system.

In 2002, Foxtel and Optus Television agreed to a content-sharing arrangement. Programming competition between the two companies has now dissipated. Prior to its acquisition by Foxtel in 2011, Austar, a regional pay television operator, also carried most Foxtel programming.
, Foxtel is Australia&#x27;s largest pay television operator, with programming available to over 70% of Australian homes, and delivered to over 1.65 million, either directly or by Foxtel&#x27;s wholesale customers. In April 2008, Foxtel&#x27;s penetration into Australian homes passed 30%. This penetration rate is significantly lower compared with market penetration rates in the US (over 85%) and in Western Europe (over 55%). This is due to the fact that Australian pay-TV fees are significantly more expensive and pay-TV began delivering its service much later in Australia than in the US.

Foxtel announced its maiden annual profit in 2006, more than 10 years after it commenced services. The installation and maintenance of Foxtel services is Telstra&#x27;s responsibility. In many markets Telstra has outsourced installation and maintenance to large communications contractors, including ABB Communications and Siemens-Thiess Communications joint venture.

In 2007, Network 10 formed an agreement with Foxtel to allow them to carry a digital version of Ten&#x27;s programming. Included in the deal is electronic program guide data, which allows Foxtel iQ users to schedule recordings on Ten. Before the agreement, Ten was carried in an analogue format on cable only. In 2008, Seven Network entered an agreement to allow Foxtel to carry its SD signal. In 2008, the first Pay TV package comparison site YouCompare was launched to allow Foxtel packages and pricing to be compared to SelecTV, however this service was ceased along with the ceasing of SelecTV&#x27;s service in late 2010.

On 24 November 2009, Foxtel added 7two to the East Coast (satellite) and 7two and GO! to cable subscribers. ABC3 was recently introduced on 4 December 2009 to all Foxtel and Austar subscribers.

On 20 May 2010, Foxtel and Microsoft announced a new way of receiving Foxtel through Xbox 360&#x27;s online service Xbox LIVE. The service launched November 2010 with 30+ channels and an additional 12 Video-on-demand channels.

HD+ launched with four channels; BBC HD, ESPN HD, Fox Sports HD and a timeshared documentary channel for Discovery HD World and National Geographic HD programming.

===Foxtel Download===
On 1 October 2009, Foxtel launched an online download service which allows all cable and satellite customers to access Foxtel content via their computer. The service were free for customers, who can download programmes from channels within their subscription package. There were one live streaming channel, ESPN3, while the remainder of the service provides episodes of programs from 38 channels. Then CEO, Kim Williams, highlighted that Foxtel planned to expand its live streaming channel range later in the year to coincide with the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics and the launch of thirty new channels for Foxtel Digital and HD. This service has been the source of great controversy as there was no support for Linux, Mac or any 64 bit Windows Operating Systems, leaving many users unable to install the client.
Foxtel Download was discontinued in September 2012, with the service no longer being available to subscribers.

===Mobile Foxtel===
Launched in late 2006 to coincide with Telstra&#x27;s NextG 3G Mobile phone network, Mobile Foxtel (previously Foxtel By Mobile) offers 33 standard channels of programming for a small subscription fee, optimised for mobile devices. the channels on the service were: Sky News National, Your Money, CNN, Fox Sports News, Fox8, The Comedy Channel, MTV, E! Entertainment, Fashion TV, Discovery Mobile, Disney Channel, Eurosport, Union Extreme Sports, Cartoon Network, TV1, National Geographic, ABC, SBS One and Eurosportnews.

With the exception of CNN, Fashion TV, Eurosportsnews, Eurosport, Fox News, BBC World News and Fox Sports News, which were direct simulcasts of the actual channel and Sky News channels which are taken from the Sky News Active service, all channels are pre-produced loops that do not directly correlate to the full scale satellite/cable channel. There were a limit of 200 minutes per month, with 15 minutes per session, may apply to the service, although this has not been strictly enforced.

The service was discontinued on 27 July 2016.

===Foxtel on Xbox 360 and Internet TV===
Foxtel launched in November 2010 for the Xbox 360 games console, offering 38 channels, catch-up television and on-demand movie streaming. It requires both an Xbox Live Gold subscription and a Foxtel subscription. Samsung Smart TVs received the same service at no additional cost in July 2012. This has been replaced with Foxtel Now.

===Presto===

In 2014, Foxtel launched a movie streaming operation &quot;Presto&quot;, which was initially priced at $19.99, but was halved a few months later. Presto was spin-off a television streaming service with Seven West Media in early 2015.

Foxtel announced the Presto service will be closed in January 2017, and customers moved to a Foxtel Now service.

===Fox Movies===
In August 2018, Foxtel launched a streaming VOD (video on demand) movie service called FoxFlicks. This service is available to subscribers who have either the movie pack or platinum pack with the new iQ4 set-top-box. It has since been rebranded as Foxtel Movies.

===Live2Air===
In December 2006, airline Virgin Australia (then known as Virgin Blue) announced a partnership with Foxtel and Austar to introduce a &quot;Live2Air&quot; service on most flights by mid-2007, providing live satellite TV to passengers via the in-flight entertainment system. The Live2Air system offered 24 Foxtel channels and was only available on selected Boeing 737 aircraft, and was phased out beginning in 2012.

==Devices==
Foxtel devices are manufactured by Pace plc on behalf of Foxtel - they have manufactured a variety of devices including:

===Foxtel Standard===
There is a variety of Foxtel standard units. These lack the recording features of the iQ models, but can be connected to a VCR or DVR. Foxtel has phased out the standard boxes for all new installations and provides the iQ3, iQ4 or iQ5 instead. The additional features of the iQ models (such as recording) can be deactivated if the customer does not wish to pay for them, in effect making them operate as if they were a legacy model.

===Foxtel iQ===
Foxtel launched Foxtel iQ in early 2005. It is a timeshifting personal digital recorder in which subscribers are able to record programmes onto a 160 GB hard drive inside the set-top unit for later viewing. Foxtel iQ includes a feature called Series Link, which lets the viewer choose to record all future episodes in a given television series (availability is limited to certain programmes). Foxtel iQ also allows viewers to use live rewind and pause features during television programmes. Two new services, On Demand and Remote Record, launched in 2007. Remote Record was launched on 1 January 2007 and allows users to log into the interactive TV guide on the Foxtel website and then command their iQ at home to record shows, while On-Demand was launched on 8 February 2007. This service is based on Sky+, which was launched on News Corporation&#x27;s UK television platform Sky in 2001.
There are currently two models of Foxtel iQ, with identical functionality to the user but different audio-visual output abilities. Both models have two tuners, allowing users to record two programmes (or record one and watch one) simultaneously.
Pace plc are the set top box provider for iQ, of which they claim that the cable version of iQ is the first DVB-based cable digital video recorder.

The updated version of the original iQ unit is physically smaller, however allows for better quality recordings and HDMI up-scaling as well as an Ethernet Port to allow Box Office downloads. It can also order On-Demand titles without the need of the phone line connected to the model. These boxes are referred to as the iQ1.5, to differentiate them from the original iQ boxes. As of 1 March 2017, these boxes are no longer available to new customers.

===Foxtel iQ2===
The second-generation iQ2 box was launched alongside the Foxtel HD+ service in mid-2008. Equipped with a 320GB HDD, iQ2 is capable of recording 30 hours of HD and 90 hours of SD content and offers, double that of the original iQ. The unit also offers HDMI connectivity.

The iQ2 is equipped with four tuners, of which one is reserved for on demand content. This allows users to record two programs at once while watching a third live.

As of 2011, 75 per cent of Foxtel subscribers are using an iQ series unit, 40 per cent are using Multi-Room, and 40 per cent are using iQ2 (and therefore, HD).

On 2 November 2011, Foxtel started notifying subscribers of the option to upgrade (at an additional one-off $200 upgrade fee) to a 1TB model with 4 times the recording capacity. As of 17 August 2020, these boxes are no longer available to new customers.

===Foxtel iQ3===
Foxtel&#x27;s third-generation model, iQ3, was first referenced by CEO Richard Freudenstein in March 2012, and was released to customers on 23 March 2015. The iQ3 contains increased internet connectivity with the inclusion of Wi-Fi and the ability to re-watch certain broadcast programmes to the start using on-demand technology. The iQ3 includes a 1TB HDD (3x the capacity of the previous iQHD) and a bluetooth remote. After the release, many customers had complaints due to the unstable nature of the iQ3 graphical user interface and additionally accused Foxtel of releasing an &#x27;unfinished product&#x27;. Foxtel denied such claims along with rumours that up to 2,000 iQ3 boxes were quickly launched in response to market rival Netflix launching in Australia in April 2015. As of November 2015, instability issues are yet to be resolved. However, an iQ3 software update in late 2019 allows integration with Netflix titles when connected to a television unit with an application for the service.

===Foxtel iQ4===
Foxtel&#x27;s fourth-generation model, iQ4 was launched in August 2018 and is 4K compatible. Foxtel launched Foxtel 4K—a dedicated 4K channel on 7 October 2018, with the broadcast of the Supercheap Auto Bathurst 1000.

===Foxtel iQ5===
The iQ5 is Foxtel&#x27;s latest set top box which came out in September 2021 and can operate in two different modes depending on what service is available at customer&#x27;s premises. It can be connected to an existing Satellite service, where a dish is already installed and working, or connected to the internet to stream Foxtel content in internet-only mode.

==Advertising on Foxtel==
When Foxtel was launched in 1995, advertising during programmes was banned under Australian Government legislation for the first two years. Foxtel has since significantly increased advertising across its platform, although still today legislation prevents Foxtel and other pay TV businesses from earning more than 50 per cent of their revenue from advertising. Sometimes, viewers are exposed to up to 5 minutes worth of adverts for every 8 minutes of programming. Certain programming on select channels are ad-free such as films or live games on Fox Sports, as well as select premium networks such as Fox Showcase.

==Legislation affecting Foxtel==

===Anti-siphoning===
The Australian anti-siphoning laws also prevent Foxtel and other pay TV suppliers from acquiring exclusive rights to specific sporting events such as cricket, golf, tennis and the football codes. Under the legislation pay TV licensees are prevented from bidding for major sporting events until a right is acquired by the ABC, SBS, Seven, Nine and Ten networks. In 2009, the Minister for Communications announced a review of the legislation. In an Olympics year, the Australian anti-siphoning list runs to over 1300 events and is one of the longest in the world.

==Third party access==
Foxtel prevents users from using their subscription card in a third-party decoder, and requires all users to watch the service on a supplied set-top box, included with the subscription, however some users have reported being able to watch certain channels on a computer with a DVB-C card and using sasc-ng to decrypt the video content using card readers to read the decoding keys stored on the card used in Foxtel&#x27;s iQ.

==Foxtel Networks==
On 24 May 2012, Foxtel merged with Austar, resulting in Foxtel gaining Austar&#x27;s shares in XYZnetworks (which Foxtel closed and created Foxtel Networks), as well as their shares in Main Event.
The channels owned by Foxtel include:

<text>In mathematics, especially in the area of abstract algebra known as ring theory, a free algebra is the noncommutative analogue of a polynomial ring since its elements may be described as &quot;polynomials&quot; with non-commuting variables. Likewise, the polynomial ring may be regarded as a free commutative algebra.

==Definition==
For &quot;R&quot; a commutative ring, the free (associative, unital) algebra on &quot;n&quot; indeterminates {&quot;X&quot;1...,&quot;Xn&quot;} is the free &quot;R&quot;-module with a basis consisting of all words over the alphabet {&quot;X&quot;1...,&quot;Xn&quot;} (including the empty word, which is the unit of the free algebra). This &quot;R&quot;-module becomes an &quot;R&quot;-algebra by defining a multiplication as follows: the product of two basis elements is the concatenation of the corresponding words:

:formula_1

and the product of two arbitrary &quot;R&quot;-module elements is thus uniquely determined (because the multiplication in an &quot;R&quot;-algebra must be &quot;R&quot;-bilinear). This &quot;R&quot;-algebra is denoted &quot;R&quot;⟨&quot;X&quot;1...,&quot;Xn&quot;⟩. This construction can easily be generalized to an arbitrary set &quot;X&quot; of indeterminates.

In short, for an arbitrary set formula_2, the free (associative, unital) &quot;R&quot;-algebra on &quot;X&quot; is 
:formula_3
with the &quot;R&quot;-bilinear multiplication that is concatenation on words, where &quot;X&quot;* denotes the free monoid on &quot;X&quot; (i.e. words on the letters &quot;X&quot;i), formula_4 denotes the external direct sum, and &quot;Rw&quot; denotes the free &quot;R&quot;-module on 1 element, the word &quot;w&quot;.

For example, in &quot;R&quot;⟨&quot;X&quot;1,&quot;X&quot;2,&quot;X&quot;3,&quot;X&quot;4⟩, for scalars &quot;α, β, γ, δ&quot; ∈ &quot;R&quot;, a concrete example of a product of two elements is 

:formula_5.

The non-commutative polynomial ring may be identified with the monoid ring over &quot;R&quot; of the free monoid of all finite words in the &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot;.

==Contrast with polynomials==
Since the words over the alphabet {&quot;X&quot;1, ...,&quot;Xn&quot;} form a basis of &quot;R&quot;⟨&quot;X&quot;1...,&quot;Xn&quot;⟩, it is clear that any element of &quot;R&quot;⟨&quot;X&quot;1, ...,&quot;Xn&quot;⟩ can be written uniquely in the form:

:formula_6

where formula_7 are elements of &quot;R&quot; and all but finitely many of these elements are zero. This explains why the elements of &quot;R&quot;⟨&quot;X&quot;1...,&quot;Xn&quot;⟩ are often denoted as &quot;non-commutative polynomials&quot; in the &quot;variables&quot; (or &quot;indeterminates&quot;) &quot;X&quot;1...,&quot;Xn&quot;; the elements formula_8 are said to be &quot;coefficients&quot; of these polynomials, and the &quot;R&quot;-algebra &quot;R&quot;⟨&quot;X&quot;1...,&quot;Xn&quot;⟩ is called the &quot;non-commutative polynomial algebra over &quot;R&quot; in &quot;n&quot; indeterminates&quot;. Note that unlike in an actual polynomial ring, the variables do not commute. For example, &quot;X&quot;1&quot;X&quot;2 does not equal &quot;X&quot;2&quot;X&quot;1.

More generally, one can construct the free algebra &quot;R&quot;⟨&quot;E&quot;⟩ on any set &quot;E&quot; of generators. Since rings may be regarded as Z-algebras, a free ring on &quot;E&quot; can be defined as the free algebra Z⟨&quot;E&quot;⟩.

Over a field, the free algebra on &quot;n&quot; indeterminates can be constructed as the tensor algebra on an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional vector space. For a more general coefficient ring, the same construction works if we take the free module on &quot;n&quot; generators.

The construction of the free algebra on &quot;E&quot; is functorial in nature and satisfies an appropriate universal property. The free algebra functor is left adjoint to the forgetful functor from the category of &quot;R&quot;-algebras to the category of sets.

Free algebras over division rings are free ideal rings.

<doc id="494670" wikidata="Q172996" url="?curid=494670" title="George Town, Cayman Islands">
<text>George Town is the capital and largest city in the Cayman Islands, located on Grand Cayman. It was named after King George III. , the city had a population of 40,957, making it the largest city (by population) of all the British Overseas Territories.

George Town is the heart of the Cayman Islands financial services industry (there are close to 600 Bank and Trust companies in the Cayman Islands). The Caymanian government offices are located in the city. According to the Globalization and World Cities Research Network in 2016, George Town is classed as a Beta city.

==Government==
The Caymanian government offices are located in George Town. These offices include the Parliament of the Cayman Islands, the Court Houses and the Government Administration Building. The Government Administration Building houses the offices of the Premier and other members of Cabinet, the Deputy Governor and his staff as well as other elected officials and civil servants. The former Old Courts Building located at the corner of Shedden Road and Harbour Drive is now the National Museum of Grand Cayman. The building was built more than 150 years ago and has served the Caymanian government not only as a court building but as a jail and the island&#x27;s first official Post Office.

The Cayman Islands are a British Overseas Territory; however, they are given special autonomy when dealing with domestic affairs. Foreign affairs are the responsibility of the British appointed Governor and the British Government. The British Army will also be called to defend or assist the islands in the event of a natural disaster or military conflict. It is also trusted that the United States would assist the islands in time of need if the UK requests, seeing that the US is closer in proximity to the islands than the UK.

==Politics==
The politics of George Town is dominated by the People&#x27;s Progressive Movement, who won 5 out of the 7 electoral districts in the city during the 2021 general election. They believe in introducing a nationwide welfare program, an increased financial presence in the UK, EU and US, reduced interference by the UK in domestic affairs and funding sustainable development projects across the islands.

==Demographics==

49.6% of the Cayman Islands population live in George Town. It has recorded residents from more than one hundred countries. 37.9% of George Town&#x27;s residents are Caymanian, and 63.8% are immigrants and permanent residents. The vast majority of the city&#x27;s population are immigrants, mostly hailing from Jamaica, the Philippines, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Honduras and India. There is also a growing South African population.

Christianity is the most followed religion in the city, with most being Protestant with a sizable Roman Catholic population. There is also a Jewish center and Islamic Society in the city.

==Geography==
George Town&#x27;s city limits extend from the east at the edge of the South Shore District, north just beyond Owen Roberts International Airport, south to Hog Sty Bay and west to Seven Mile Beach and the West Bay District. George Town&#x27;s famous Seven Mile Beach is a long crescent of coral-sand beach extending up to the West Bay region of Grand Cayman and is the most popular and populated area for tourists on the island.
===Climate===
George Town has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen &quot;Aw&quot;), with a hot and wet season from May through November, and a very warm and dry season from December through April. As with most tropical climates, there is only a slight variation in monthly mean temperatures during the course of the year.


==Economy==

===Finance===

The financial services generated CI$1.2 billion of GDP in 2007 (55% of the total economy), 36% of all employment and 40% of all government revenue. The Cayman Islands ranks fifth internationally in terms of value of liabilities booked and sixth in terms of assets booked. It has branches of 40 of the world&#x27;s 50 largest banks. The Cayman Islands are the second largest captive domicile in the world with more than 700 captives, writing more than US$7.7 billion of premiums and with US$36.8 billion of assets under management. There are more than 9,500 funds under licence with globally recognised legal, audit/accounting and fund administration services (incl. the Big Four auditors). Major law firms such as Maples and Calder and Ogier (law firm) have established themselves in the Cayman Islands. Similarly, large accounting firms such as KPMG, PwC, Ernst &amp; Young and Deloitte are also present. As a result, the Cayman Islands are a leader in captive domiciles, hedge fund registrations and is considered a major international banking centre.

===Tourism===

George Town is a popular port of call for the Caribbean with cruise ships anchoring in George Town Harbour Tuesday through Friday. Cruise ships calling at George Town anchor offshore and ferry their passengers ashore by tenders, also known as shuttle boats. Passengers disembark in George Town, in the centre of the Grand Cayman shopping district and usually remain anchored from early morning until mid-afternoon.

Activities available to tourists in George Town include submarine tours of George Town Harbour, glass-bottom boat tours, snorkelling, scuba-diving, parasailing, charter boat tours, rum distillery tours, art galleries, a historical museum, and of course, shopping and eating. For nightlife, Seven Mile Beach is host to numerous nightclubs and bars. George Town&#x27;s waterfront is also home to a Harley-Davidson shop, a Jimmy Buffett&#x27;s Margaritaville franchise, and a Guy Harvey art studio and restaurant. The Kimpton Seafire Resort and Spa and The Ritz-Carlton Grand Cayman are the most expensive hotels on the island.

<doc id="494671" wikidata="Q4209865" url="?curid=494671" title="Optus Television">
<text>Optus Television is the cable television division of Australian telecommunications company Optus.

==History==
Its immediate predecessor was Optus Vision, a joint venture between Optus and Continental Cablevision, with small shareholdings by media companies Publishing &amp; Broadcasting Limited and Seven Network. It was founded to handle residential cable television and local telephony, while its parent concentrated on corporate, long-distance, satellite and interstate communications. It used a hybrid fibre coaxial cable network to connect homes to its network and subsequently added broadband cable internet access.

Optus Vision used the Optus telecommunications licence as its authority to build a cable network, which it deployed in Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane.

Optus&#x27;s main competition, especially in the metropolitan areas, was Foxtel, a joint venture between Telstra and News Corporation.

Optus negotiated exclusive access to AFL, rugby league, and other sports, and had exclusive access to Disney Channel, ESPN and MTV Australia, but lacked the general entertainment channels Foxtel had. It commenced its cable TV service in September 1995, one month before Foxtel, delivering a limited number of channels to a small number of subscribers, all of whom were connected via its Blacktown Exchange.

From 1995 to 1997, the Super League war waged between the two consortia over lucrative rugby league rights. 
In March 1997, Optus bought out the other shareholders in exchange for equity in itself, to float.

In 2002, it let go of some of its exclusive content contracts, replacing them with non-exclusive ones. MTV Australia, Disney Channel, ESPN and the premium Movie Network channels all became available on Foxtel.

In 2009, Optus Television stopped offering service to new subscribers but maintained it for existing subscribers.

From February 2011, Optus again offered Optus TV featuring Foxtel including IQ2 services.

On 14 February 2016, Singtel-Optus renewed their contract with Astro-Fetch TV in preparation for the 2016/17 EPL season.

=== Satellite broadcasting ===
Optus, along with Austar had a joint venture in the use of Satellite broadcasting for the delivery of Subscription Television. Originally, Foxtel had not previously offered a Satellite service, until purchasing the satellite subscribers from Australis Media within their service area. Until 2004, Foxtel was a customer of the Austar/Optus joint venture.

Optus utilised this joint venture to initially trial and subsequently offer a basic satellite service, named VIP. The service was very select with not many being able to access the service. It was also offered to Norfolk Island and some smart cards were enabled for some residents (who had the required satellite receiving equipment) to take part in a trial of the service. The ability to offer the service came about due to Optus offering a large number of channels to East Coast Television (now a part of Austar). After Optus axed the &quot;VIP&quot; Service, it also sold its share in the joint venture to Austar.

In 2004, the roles reversed and Austar became the customer to Foxtel for satellite delivery.

===Sports programming===

Until 2002, Optus did not offer the Fox Sports sporting channels on their service as Foxtel and Austar did, instead offering channels from Sportsvision (later C7 Sport) and ESPN.

During the Super League/ARL war, the Optus sports channels had the rights to the ARL competition and the Super League rights were held by Fox Sports.

Seven bought Sportsvision, which became Optus and Austar exclusive C7 Sport and progressively lost sporting rights to Fox Sports. During that time Foxtel granted Optus an NRL Channel, screening all of the NRL matches that had previously been shown exclusively on the Foxtel platform.

C7 Sport for some time had attempted to access the Foxtel platform for their service – however Foxtel were hesitant to accede to the request, with one exception being the 2000 Sydney Olympics, where C7 offered two extra channels dedicated to Olympics coverage.

In 2000, Seven and C7 Sport lost the AFL rights to a Nine/Ten and Foxtel-based consortium leaving C7 with only the Olympic Games and Six Nations Championship rugby union rights of major substance.

In March 2002, the commencement of the new AFL broadcasting deal with Foxtel led Optus and Austar to drop C7 Sport from their services, leading to the demise of the channel. Optus replaced the C7 channels with an Optus rebadged version of Fox Sports. Optus dropped the &quot;Optus Sports&quot; name in October 2002.

The dropping of the C7 service led to Optus being a party in the unsuccessful legal action taken by the Seven Network over the demise of the C7 Sport service.

On 13 July 2016, Optus launched Optus Sport, a group of sports channels that were established to televise the Premier League.

== Subscriber numbers ==
For some time, Optus has not explicitly released subscriber numbers for their Optus Television service, however combining them with other services offered under the division of which Optus Television is a part.

Since December 2002, subscriber numbers have dropped considerably to almost half of the 241,000 reported. Since that time, Optus has repositioned its television service to being a major component of bundled services, rather than a service by itself. By August 2010 only 96,000 subscribers remained.

== Optus iTV trials ==
During 2002–2003, Optus trialled interactive digital television over part of its Sydney network. The service was being built from 2000. This service was known as Optus iTV. The service was unique to Optus and had a good deal of positive consumer feedback. The iTV service utilised the Liberate platform instead of OpenTV, as used by Foxtel Digital. The trials were cancelled by Optus after the Content Supply Agreement with Foxtel was reached. One byproduct of the new agreement was the re-engineering of the Optus iTV broadcast centre in Macquarie Park to become the new broadcast centre for Foxtel.

A notable difference between Optus iTV and Foxtel Digital was that the Optus system used the same HFC cable network both for delivery and for the return path, meaning no additional hardware or service was required for this return path. By contrast, the Foxtel Digital system at the time relied on a telephone connection for the return path. The advantage of this system is that it is &quot;platform neutral&quot;, meaning that the same telephone-based return path can be used for both cable and satellite installations.

The Optus iTV system also allowed near video on demand (nvod) not true video on demand. Foxtel Digital now provides Near Video on Demand as well. Featured content broadcast on multiple channels with staggered start times available at frequent intervals. Some new Foxtel Services offer a &quot;Video on Demand&quot; ability for limited product, various transmission paths offer a broader VOD version.

Other potential features of Optus iTV included e-mail and walled garden Internet access.

== Optus TV featuring Foxtel ==

After signing up to the Content Supply Agreement with Foxtel, Optus Television changed their channel lineup to reflect the offerings from Foxtel. Optus were able to have a number of differences between their offering and the Foxtel offering, so that Optus could meet some contractual obligations they had, as well as satisfying a number of requirements placed on the organisation by the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission.

A number of channels that had previously been unique to Optus (in comparison with Foxtel) such as the Odyssey Channel were removed from the Optus line-up, as they competed with channels that Foxtel offered. Other channels crossed from Optus to the Foxtel line-up such as the Ovation Channel. Optus was required to have a number of channels that were unique to their service, though the flagged channels are now available on both platforms without any change in regulation nor penalty.

== Optus TV featuring Foxtel Digital ==
In April 2005, Foxtel granted Optus the right to carry the &quot;Foxtel Digital&quot; platform (one year after being available to Foxtel subscribers) The service would be resold by Optus, utilising the same equipment as Foxtel (such as the Foxtel set top box, remote, NDS technologies for encryption and OpenTV for interactivity delivery).

This agreement also allows for non-exclusive resale rights to the Foxtel Digital service using Satellite Delivery within Foxtel&#x27;s service area.

Commencing trials in November 2005, the service became fully operational in December of the same year.

Optus is believed to be permitting wholesale access to the network so third party broadcasters can sell subscription services over Optus cable.

<doc id="494675" wikidata="Q3858303" url="?curid=494675" title="Intimidation">
<text>Intimidation is a behaviour and legal wrong which usually involves deterring or coercing an individual by threat of violence. It is in various jurisdictions a crime and a civil wrong (tort). Intimidation is similar to menacing, coercion, terrorizing and assault in the traditional sense.

This includes intentional behaviors of forcing another person to experience general discomfort such as humiliation, embarrassment, inferiority, limited freedom, etc and the victim might be targeted based on multiple factors like gender, race, class, skin color, competency, knowledge, wealth, temperament, etc. Intimidation is done for making the other person submissive (also known as cowing), to destabilize/undermine the other, to force compliance, to hide one&#x27;s insecurities, to socially valorize oneself, etc. There are active and passive coping mechanisms against intimidation that include, but are not limited to, not letting the intimidator invade your personal dignity and space, addressing their behavior directly, understanding those behaviors as methods to bypass ethical norms and exploit fear as a means of securing compliance or dominance, or sometimes as final straws the person has to achieve their antisocial goals, avoiding the person, being cautious around them, honing breakaway skills, documenting, etc. Victims of intimidation would reasonably develop apprehension, experience fear of injury or harm, etc from the unwanted behaviors or tools of intimidation that include, and not limited to, condescending, rudeness, sarcasm, disrespecting, patronizing, degrading, disparaging, etc. However, it is not legally necessary to prove that the behavior caused the victim to experience or panic.

Intimidation as a political process is done through national level threats to compel or deter another country to operate in ways the intimidating country wants it to be, an example of political intimidation is putting an embargo on items that the target country depends through import for forcing their compliance. Certain second and third world countries use terrorism as an intimidation tactic. &quot;A terroristic threat is a crime generally involving a threat to commit violence communicated with the intent to terrorize other.&quot; Personal intimidation is considered to be a management strategy to signal/inform potential rivals that they may face significant consequences if they act against the person in charge/management or to get workers in line. Certain forms of intimidation like sexual and racial ones are considered as criminal offense in several civilized countries.

==Description==
Intimidation is derived from the verb intimidate, and it comes from the Latin word , it means to &quot;make timid.&quot; Intimidation is defined as an interaction style that emphasizes on &quot;bullying, exploiting, or manipulating others, solely for one&#x27;s own advantage.&quot; Intimidation may be employed consciously or unconsciously, and a percentage of people who employ it consciously may do so as the result of selfishly rationalized notions of its appropriation, utility or self-empowerment. Intimidation related to prejudice and discrimination may include conduct &quot;which annoys, threatens, intimidates, alarms, or puts a person in fear of their safety...because of a belief or perception regarding such person&#x27;s race, color, national origin, ancestry, gender, religion, religious practice, age, disability or sexual orientation, regardless of whether the belief or perception is correct.&quot;

Intimidation may manifest into coercion or threat with physical contacts, glowering countenance or in its own manner as emotional manipulation, verbal abuse, making someone feel lower than you, purposeful embarrassment and/or actual physical assault. &quot;Behavior may become harassment in forms of epithets, derogatory comments or slurs and lewd propositions, assault, impeding or blocking movement, offensive touching or any physical interference with normal work or movement, and visual insults, such as derogatory posters or cartoons.&quot;

Threatening behaviors may be conceptualized as a maladaptive outgrowth of normal competitive urge for interrelational dominance generally seen in animals. Alternatively, intimidation may result from the type of society in which individuals are socialized, as human beings are generally reluctant to engage in confrontation or threaten violence.

Like all behavioral traits, it exists in greater or lesser manifestation in each individual person over time, but may be a more significant &quot;compensatory behavior&quot; for some as opposed to others. Behavioral theorists often see threatening behaviours as a consequence of being threatened by others, including parents, authority figures, playmates and siblings. For self-defense, use of force is justified when a person reasonably believes that it the force is necessary to defend themself or another against the immediate use of unlawful force.

==As a criminal offense==
===India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Malaysia &amp; Singapore===
Indian Penal Code (IPC), and penal codes of other nations based on IPC such as Singapore Penal Code, Malaysian Penal Code, Pakistan Penal Code, Bangladesh Penal Code, etc make the &quot;criminal intimidation&quot; a punishable offense under the section 503 to 506.

===United States===
&quot;Intimidation&quot; is the name of a criminal offence in several U.S. states. The definitions of the crime of Intimidation differ by state.

In Montana, Intimidation is defined as follows:

Several states have a crime called &quot;ethnic intimidation&quot;. For instance, the law of the state of Michigan reads:

Crimes closely related to intimidation are menacing, coercion, terrorizing, and assault.

In California, making criminal threats is a wobbler and may be charged as either a misdemeanor or a felony under California Penal Code 422. A felony criminal threat is a strike under California&#x27;s three strikes law.

==As a civil offense==

===United States===
Intimidation can also be a civil offense, in addition to a criminal offense, in some U.S. states. For example, in Oregon a violation of the state criminal statute for intimidation results in a civil violation. The plaintiff in the civil suit for intimidation may then secure remedies including an injunction or special and general damages.

<doc id="494681" wikidata="Q460427" url="?curid=494681" title="That's So Raven">
<text>That&#x27;s So Raven is an American television fantasy teen sitcom that was created by Michael Poryes and Susan Sherman, and aired on Disney Channel for four seasons between January 2003 and November 2007. The series centers on Raven Baxter (Raven-Symoné), a teenager with hidden psychic abilities. Episodes show Raven experiencing visions of future events; she must also deal with the social and personal issues of her youth. Raven often misinterprets the events she foresees, and intervenes to prevent a vision from coming true or to protect her friends and family. She uses her skills in fashion design to create elaborate disguises she wears during these schemes. Raven&#x27;s secret is shared with her best friends Eddie Thomas (Orlando Brown) and Chelsea Daniels (Anneliese van der Pol), along with her brother Cory (Kyle Massey) and parents Tanya (T&#x27;Keyah Crystal Keymáh) and Victor (Rondell Sheridan). The series explores supernatural elements, family, friendship, and adolescence.

The Walt Disney Company created the series as its television network&#x27;s first multi-camera sitcom after the success of its earlier single-camera comedy series such as &quot;Even Stevens&quot; and &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot;, the former of which executive producers David Brookwell and Sean McNamara concurrently worked on. Their joint company Brookwell McNamara Entertainment produced &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot;, which premiered on January 17, 2003. The series concluded on November 10, 2007, after becoming the first program on the network to reach 100 episodes, and ended because the actors were aging beyond the show&#x27;s target teenage demographic. All four seasons of the show have been distributed through digital download and on the streaming service Disney+.

&quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot; enjoyed high viewership on broadcast television in the United States, and gave rise to the development of merchandise, soundtrack albums, and video game adaptations. Television critics praised Raven-Symoné for her physical comedy in what is considered her breakthrough role. The series received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Children&#x27;s Program in 2005 and 2007. A spin-off entitled &quot;Cory in the House&quot;, which stars Massey and Sheridan, aired on Disney Channel for two seasons from 2007 to 2008. Raven-Symoné, van der Pol, Sheridan and Keymáh reprised their roles for the spin-off &quot;Raven&#x27;s Home&quot;, which aired for six seasons from 2017 to 2023.

==Premise==
Raven Baxter is a high-school student who has a secret psychic ability that allows her to experience short visions of future events. Often, she finds herself misinterpreting the events she sees, resulting in trouble for herself, her friends and family. Raven keeps her supernatural ability a secret; only her close friends and family are aware of it. Raven attends school alongside her best friends Chelsea, who is described as &quot;ditzy&quot;, and is an environmentalist and an artist; and Eddie, who is an aspiring rapper, is athletic and plays on the school basketball team. Raven lives with her younger brother Cory, an aspiring businessperson, and her parents Victor and Tanya. Victor initially works in a restaurant as a chef, and in the second season he opens his own restaurant called &quot;The Chill Grill&quot;. Tanya halted her studies to raise her family but decided to continue studying law once her children were older; after the third season, she leaves the family to study in England. Raven is an aspiring fashion designer who frequently creates costumes to disguise her identity; she often implements schemes to rectify a situation or her own mistakes. In the fourth season, the show&#x27;s format is slightly revised; Raven works as an intern for the famous fashion designer Donna Cabonna.

The series explores the fantasy of wanting a supernatural power children may experience. It shares similarities with series such as &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot; and other fantasy television programs in which adolescents experience and learn to deal with miraculous abilities. Disney Channel president Rich Ross stated Raven&#x27;s powers are not &quot;dark&quot; but rather a metaphorical representation of the unpredictability of future events. The series does not explore the origin or discovery of Raven&#x27;s powers; however, her grandmother Vivian also has psychic powers. Raven often intervenes in situations to prevent a vision from coming true but she does not regularly try to control her ability or take advantage of it. Her visions sometimes represent a self-fulfilling prophecy. Many of the program&#x27;s stories take place in the high-school setting.

==Production==
===Development===

In the early 2000s, The Walt Disney Company&#x27;s pay television network Disney Channel experienced success with single-camera comedy series &quot;Even Stevens&quot; and &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot;, and others that were also aimed at a pre-adolescent audience. &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot; was intended to appeal to a family audience while having a female character in the comedy lead role. Michael Poryes and Susan Sherman created the series. Sherman first conceived the idea of a buddy comedy for a pre-adolescent audience, and she and Poryes decided to base it around the idea of being able to see the future, which they thought would interest young viewers. The creators pitched the concept to network executives under the working title &quot;The Future is On Me&quot; and later as &quot;Absolutely Psychic&quot;. Poryes said at her audition, Raven-Symoné read for the role of the lead character and for the comedic best-friend character Chelsea, and that she wanted to play Chelsea. Subsequently, a pilot episode in which she starred as the best friend rather than in the central role was filmed but after the test audience responded well to her and producers were impressed, the program was re-written with Raven-Symoné in the main role. Test audiences also responded favorably to the show&#x27;s supernatural premise and its comedy. The series was also retitled &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot;. Poryes also served as an executive producer alongside David Brookwell and Sean McNamara, who concurrently produced &quot;Even Stevens&quot; for Disney Channel. Their joint company, Brookwell McNamara Entertainment produced the program in association with the network. &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot; became Disney Channel&#x27;s first multi-camera sitcom. The series is centered on an African American family in a deliberate attempt to represent the diversity of the network&#x27;s audience.

&quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot; and Raven-Symoné&#x27;s involvement as the titular character Raven were announced in a press release in November 2001. Twenty-one episodes were ordered for the first season, which began filming in Los Angeles, California, in the same month. The series was initially expected to premiere in early 2002 but the whole first season was filmed before it aired on television. The premiere broadcast of &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot;, which included the first four episodes of the series, occurred on Friday, January 17, 2003.

===Casting===
The program and its primary cast were announced in November 2001; Raven-Symoné was revealed to be portraying the titular character Raven; she had previously worked as a child actor on the sitcoms &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; and &quot;Hangin&#x27; with Mr. Cooper&quot;. Raven-Symoné was reported to be Disney&#x27;s first African American female star, and the first African American woman to have her name in the title of a comedy series at the network. Joshua Alston of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; called Raven-Symoné&#x27;s role on the show her &quot;most successful phase&quot; and praised her physical comedy. Marsh cited her humor and commitment to comedy as a reason for her success. She is credited as &quot;Raven&quot; throughout the series.

The supporting cast was also first announced in November 2001. Orlando Brown portrays Raven&#x27;s close friend Eddie and Anneliese van der Pol plays Chelsea, another of Raven&#x27;s friends. Tricia Dixon was originally listed in the casting announcement before van der Pol joined the cast. Kyle Massey portrays Raven&#x27;s younger brother, Cory. Rondell Sheridan portrays Raven&#x27;s father, Victor.

T&#x27;Keyah Crystal Keymáh plays Raven&#x27;s mother Tanya for the first three seasons; she left the show because she had initially expected to only work on three seasons and because she was required to provide full-time care for her ailing grandmother. Within the show&#x27;s storyline, it is explained Tanya has traveled to England to pursue higher education.

Guest stars in the series include Jenifer Lewis as Raven&#x27;s grandmother Vivian and Anne-Marie Johnson as famous fashion designer Donna Cabonna in the show&#x27;s fourth season.

===Writing===
Poryes believed it was important to write the scripts with honesty rather than talking down to the young audience. The writers endeavored to present meaningful stories to children, including lessons about friendship, but tried not to make the messages too &quot;preachy&quot;. The series was written to reflect life as a typical teenager while also incorporating comedy, particularly through its central focus on physical humor. Van der Pol said the actors typically were not permitted to deviate from their scripted lines; however, Ross stated Raven-Symoné would improvise &quot;comic bits&quot;. Alston described the show&#x27;s nature as &quot;goofy&quot; with a &quot;kid-friendly&quot; comedy style, but also noted its complex stories revolving around &quot;ethical challenges&quot;. The episodes did not typically air in the order of their production due to the lack of serialization in their stories.

===Filming and conclusion===
&quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot; was recorded in front of a live studio audience in a set on a sound stage in Los Angeles. Filming of the first season began in November 2001. The series was filmed on two days each week and the child actors attended school on set. Prior to filming, the weekly schedule would also consist of script read-throughs, rewrites and rehearsals. A stunt coordinator was present for Raven-Symoné&#x27;s slapstick and physical stunts.

The series was renewed for a second season in April 2003. Prior to the renewal, a musical episode of &quot;Even Stevens&quot; was aired in 2002; its success among the show&#x27;s audience led network executives to ask Brookwell and McNamara to also produce a musical episode of &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot;. The musical episode of &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot;, entitled &quot;The Road to Audition&quot;, was aired as part of the second season in July 2004. The success of the musical format on both &quot;Even Stevens&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot; gave executives confidence in the appeal and interest of the musical genre, and inspired the development of the television film &quot;High School Musical&quot;.

While it was originally planned for a maximum of three seasons, in June 2005, &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot; was renewed for a fourth season, which would consist of 22 episodes and bring the program&#x27;s total number of episodes to 100. The announcement marked the first time an original Disney Channel series would exceed three seasons and the first to reach 100 episodes for syndication. A film adaptation was also ordered to debut in 2007. Ross called &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot; the network&#x27;s &quot;most successful series&quot;. Production on the season was expected to begin in July and the episodes would be aired over the following two years. Raven-Symoné became a producer on the show&#x27;s fourth season at the age of 19; her roles included having input toward casting, scripts and special effects; however, she rejected the offer to direct an episode. Brookwell and McNamara departed the series at the end of the third season when their company was replaced with Warren &amp; Rinsler Productions. An episode of the series was aired as part of the network crossover special &quot;That&#x27;s So Suite Life of Hannah Montana&quot;, which was aired in July 2006 as a crossover of &quot;The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody&quot; and &quot;Hannah Montana&quot;.

Production of the series finished in January 2006, and by August, president of Disney Channels Worldwide Gary Marsh stated it was unlikely any further episodes would be produced. Due to the heavy focus on high-school stories in the series, the network decided to end the show once the characters were beginning to age beyond their teenage years.

==Reception==
&quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot; was reported to be the highest-rating original program in Disney Channel&#x27;s history, a record previously held by &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot;. The program&#x27;s success led to two Primetime Emmy Awards nominations for Outstanding Children&#x27;s Program, in 2005 and 2007. Alston said the success of &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot; led to Disney Channel changing its approach to original programming. He praised the chemistry between Raven-Symoné, Brown and van der Pol, which he attributed to their real-life friendships. Alston cited the episodes &quot;A Goat&#x27;s Tale&quot; and &quot;Out of Control&quot; as the ones that best represent this dynamic. Raven-Symoné was widely recognized for her charisma and physical comedy in the series; Massey&#x27;s &quot;knack&quot; for physical comedy was also praised.

===Merchandising===

&quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot; became a successful merchandising franchise during its run; the show&#x27;s merchandise includes a series of novels, dolls, board games, lunch boxes, jewelry, a fragrance and a clothing range. A line of video games was also developed; two games were released on the Game Boy Advance and &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven: Psychic on the Scene&quot; was released on the Nintendo DS on November 2, 2006. Soundtrack albums &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot; (2004) and &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven Too!&quot; (2006) feature recordings by some of the cast and guest performers. By 2006, merchandise based on the series had grossed over $400 million.

===Spin-offs and adaptations===
In 2005, Disney ordered a film adaptation of &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot; alongside the program&#x27;s fourth-season renewal, which was planned for a 2007 release. Van der Pol said in 2010 a script for the film had been written but that Raven-Symoné was too busy to be involved at the time of development. The plot would have depicted Raven starting a fashion line with Eddie and Chelsea in France. The film did not enter production.

The network ordered a spin-off series entitled &quot;Cory in the House&quot; starring Massey and Sheridan in May 2006; this was the first time Disney Channel had developed a spin-off of an original series. The series depicts Cory and Victor moving to Washington, D.C., to live in the White House, where Victor begins work as the personal chef of a fictional President of the United States. The series aired for two seasons from 2007 to 2008. Another spin-off, which is entitled &quot;Raven&#x27;s Home&quot;, was first reported in October 2016; Raven-Symoné and van der Pol were both revealed to be reprising their roles as Raven and Chelsea, respectively. The series follows Raven as a divorced mother of children Booker, who has inherited Raven&#x27;s psychic abilities, and Nia. Chelsea, also a divorced mother, moves in with Raven to raise her son Levi. Raven-Symoné is an executive producer on the series, which premiered on July 21, 2017. Sheridan is featured as a guest and returns as a regular character for the program&#x27;s fifth season; Keymáh also guest-stars in the fifth-season finale. The sixth season premiered in April 2023. An Indian adaptation of the series entitled &quot;Palak Pe Jhalak&quot; premiered on Disney Channel in India in September 2015, and incorporates Indian culture and languages.

<doc id="494683" wikidata="Q580995" url="?curid=494683" title="Apotheosis">
<text>Apotheosis (, ), also called divinization or deification (), is the glorification of a subject to divine levels and, commonly, the treatment of a human being, any other living thing, or an abstract idea in the likeness of a deity.

The original sense of apotheosis relates to religion and is the subject of many works of art. Figuratively &quot;apotheosis&quot; may be used in almost any context for &quot;the deification, glorification, or exaltation of a principle, practice, etc.&quot;, so normally attached to an abstraction of some sort.

In religion, apotheosis was a feature of many religions in the ancient world, and some that are active today. It requires a belief that there is a possibility of newly created gods, so a polytheistic belief system. The major modern religions of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism do not allow for this, though many recognise minor sacred categories such as saints (created by a process called canonization). In Christian theology there is a concept of the faithful becoming god-like, called divinization or in Eastern Christianity theosis. In Hinduism there is some scope for new deities. A human may be deified by becoming regarded as an avatar of an established deity, usually a major one, or by being regarded as a new, independent, deity (usually a minor one), or some mixture of the two.

In art, an apotheosis scene typically shows the subject in the heavens or rising towards them, often accompanied by a number of angels, putti, personifications of virtues, or similar figures. Especially from Baroque art onwards, apotheosis scenes may depict rulers, generals or artists purely as an honorific metaphor; in many cases the &quot;religious&quot; context is classical Greco-Roman pagan religion, as in &quot;The Apotheosis of Voltaire&quot;, featuring Apollo. &quot;The Apotheosis of Washington&quot; (1865), high up in the dome of the United States Capitol Building, is another example. Personifications of places or abstractions are also showed receiving an apotheosis. The typical composition was suitable for placement on ceilings or inside domes.

==Ancient Near East==

Before the Hellenistic period, imperial cults were known in ancient Egypt (pharaohs) and Mesopotamia (from Naram-Sin through Hammurabi). In the New Kingdom of Egypt, all deceased pharaohs were deified as the god Osiris, having been identified as Horus while on the throne, and sometimes referred to as the &quot;son&quot; of various other deities.

The architect Imhotep was deified after his death, though the process seems to have been gradual, taking well over a thousand years, by which time he had become associated primarily with medicine. About a dozen non-royal ancient Egyptians became regarded as deities.

==Ancient Greece==


Ancient Greek religion and its Roman equivalent have many figures who were born as humans but became gods, for example Hercules. They are typically made divine by one of the main deities, the Twelve Olympians. In the Roman story Cupid and Psyche, Zeus gives the ambrosia of the gods to the mortal Psyche, transforming her into a goddess herself. In the case of the Hellenistic queen Berenice II of Egypt, herself deified like other rulers of the Ptolemaic dynasty, the court propagated a myth that her hair, cut off to fulfill a vow, had its own apotheosis before becoming the Coma Berenices, a group of stars that still bear her name.

From at least the Geometric period of the ninth century BC, the long-deceased heroes linked with founding myths of Greek sites were accorded chthonic rites in their &quot;heroon&quot;, or &quot;hero-temple&quot;.

In the Greek world, the first leader who accorded himself divine honours was Philip II of Macedon. At his wedding to his sixth wife, Philip&#x27;s enthroned image was carried in procession among the Olympian gods; &quot;his example at Aigai became a custom, passing to the Macedonian kings who were later worshipped in Greek Asia, from them to Julius Caesar and so to the emperors of Rome&quot;. Such Hellenistic state leaders might be raised to a status equal to the gods before death (e.g., Alexander the Great) or afterwards (e.g., members of the Ptolemaic dynasty). A heroic cult status similar to apotheosis was also an honour given to a few revered artists of the distant past, notably Homer.

Archaic and Classical Greek hero-cults became primarily civic, extended from their familial origins, in the sixth century; by the fifth century none of the worshipers based their authority by tracing descent back to the hero, with the exception of some families who inherited particular priestly cults, such as the Eumolpides (descended from Eumolpus) of the Eleusinian mysteries, and some inherited priesthoods at oracle sites.

The Greek hero cults can be distinguished on the other hand from the Roman cult of dead emperors, because the hero was not thought of as having ascended to Olympus or become a god: he was beneath the earth, and his power purely local. For this reason, hero cults were chthonic in nature, and their rituals more closely resembled those for Hecate and Persephone than those for Zeus and Apollo. Two exceptions were Heracles and Asclepius, who might be honoured as either gods or heroes, sometimes by chthonic night-time rites and sacrifice on the following day. One god considered as a hero to mankind is Prometheus, who secretly stole fire from Mount Olympus and introduced it to mankind.

==Ancient Rome==
Up to the end of the Republic, the god Quirinus was the only one the Romans accepted as having undergone apotheosis, for his identification/syncretism with Romulus (see Euhemerism). Subsequently, apotheosis in ancient Rome was a process whereby a deceased ruler was recognized as divine by his successor, usually also by a decree of the Senate and popular consent. The first of these cases was the posthumous deification of the last Roman dictator Julius Caesar in 42 BC by his adopted son, the triumvir Caesar Octavian. In addition to showing respect, often the present ruler deified a popular predecessor to legitimize himself and gain popularity with the people.

A vote in the Roman Senate, in the later Empire confirming an imperial decree, was the normal official process, but this sometimes followed a period with the unofficial use of deific language or imagery for the individual, often done rather discreetly within the imperial circle. There was then a public ceremony, called a , including the release of an eagle which flew high, representing the ascent of the deified person&#x27;s soul to heaven. Imagery featuring the ascent, sometimes using a chariot, was common on coins and in other art.

The largest and most famous example in art is a relief on the base of the Column of Antoninus Pius (d. 161), showing the emperor and his wife Faustina the Elder (d. c. 140) being carried up by a much larger winged figure, described as representing &quot;Eternity&quot;, as personifications of &quot;Roma&quot; and the sit below, and eagles fly above. The imperial couple are represented as Jupiter and Juno.
The historian Dio Cassius, who says he was present, gives a detailed description of the large and lavish public of Pertinax, emperor for three months in 193, ordered by Septimius Severus.

At the height of the imperial cult during the Roman Empire, sometimes the emperor&#x27;s deceased loved ones—heirs, empresses, or lovers, as Hadrian&#x27;s Antinous—were deified as well. Deified people were awarded posthumously the title ( if women) to their names to signify their divinity. Traditional Roman religion distinguished between a (god) and a &quot;divus&quot; (a mortal who became divine or deified), though not consistently. Temples and columns were erected to provide a space for worship.

The imperial cult was mainly popular in the provinces, especially in the Eastern Empire, where many cultures were well-used to deified rulers, and less popular in Rome itself, and among traditionalists and intellectuals. Some privately (and cautiously) ridiculed the apotheosis of inept and feeble emperors, as in the satire &quot;The Pumpkinification of (the Divine) Claudius&quot;, usually attributed to Seneca.

==Asia==

Numerous mortals have been deified into the Taoist pantheon, such as Guan Yu, Iron-crutch Li and Fan Kuai. Song dynasty general Yue Fei was deified during the Ming dynasty and is considered by some practitioners to be one of the three highest-ranking heavenly generals. The Ming dynasty epic &quot;Investiture of the Gods&quot; deals heavily with deification legends.
In the complicated and variable conceptions of deity in Buddhism, the achievement of Buddhahood may be regarded as an achievable goal for the faithful, and many significant deities are considered to have begun as normal humans, from Gautama Buddha himself downwards. Most of these are seen as avatars or re-births of earlier figures.

Some significant Hindu deities, in particular Rama, were also born as humans; he is seen as an avatar of Vishnu. In more modern times, Swaminarayan is an undoubted and well-documented historical figure (1781–1830), who is regarded by some Hindus as an avatar of Krishna, himself another avatar of Vishnu, or as being a still more elevated deity. Bharat Mata (&quot;Mother India&quot;) began as a national personification devised by a group of Bengali intellectuals in the late 19th century, but now receives some worship.

Various Hindu and Buddhist rulers in the past have been represented as deities, especially after death, from India to Indonesia. Jayavarman VII, King of the Khmer Empire (r. 1181–1218) the first Buddhist king of Cambodia, had his own features used for the many statues of Buddha/Avalokitesvara he erected.

The extreme personality cult instituted by the founder of North Korea, Kim Il-Sung, has been said to represent a deification, though the state is avowedly atheist.

==Christianity==

Instead of the word &quot;apotheosis&quot;, Christian theology uses in English the words &quot;deification&quot; or &quot;divinization&quot; or the Greek word &quot;theosis&quot;. Pre-Reformation and mainstream theology, in both East and West, views Jesus Christ as the preexisting God who undertook mortal existence, not as a mortal being who attained divinity (a view known as adoptionism). It holds that he has made it possible for human beings to be raised to the level of sharing the divine nature as 2 Peter 1:4 states that he became human to make humans &quot;partakers of the divine nature&quot;. In John 10:34, Jesus referenced Psalm 82:6 when he stated &quot;Is it not written in your Law, I have said you are gods?&quot; Other authors stated: &quot;For this is why the Word became man, and the Son of God became the Son of man: so that man, by entering into communion with the Word and thus receiving divine sonship, might become a son of God.&quot; &quot;For He was made man that we might be made God.&quot; &quot;The only-begotten Son of God, wanting to make us sharers in his divinity, assumed our nature, so that he, made man, might make men gods.&quot; 
Accusations of self deification to some degree may have been placed upon heretical groups such as the Waldensians.

The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology, authored by Anglican Priest Alan Richardson, contains the following in an article titled &quot;Deification&quot;:

The Roman Catholic Church does not use the term &quot;apotheosis&quot; in its theology. Corresponding to the Greek word &quot;theosis&quot; are the Latin-derived words &quot;divinization&quot; and &quot;deification&quot; used in the parts of the Catholic Church that are of Latin tradition. The concept has been given less prominence in Western theology than in that of the Eastern Catholic Churches, but is present in the Latin Church&#x27;s liturgical prayers, such as that of the deacon or priest when pouring wine and a little water into the chalice: &quot;By the mystery of this water and wine may we come to share in the divinity of Christ who humbled himself to share in our humanity.&quot;

Catholic theology stresses the concept of supernatural life, &quot;a new creation and elevation, a rebirth, it is a participation in and partaking of the divine nature&quot; (cf. ). In Catholic teaching there is a vital distinction between natural life and supernatural life, the latter being &quot;the life that God, in an act of love, freely gives to human beings to elevate them above their natural lives&quot; and which they receive through prayer and the sacraments; indeed the Catholic Church sees human existence as having as its whole purpose the acquisition, preservation and intensification of this supernatural life.

Deification for humans is holistic because people have a body and a soul. It begins immaterially or spiritually in the soul via the infusion of sanctifying grace - such as the fruit of the Holy Spirit - in baptism. Spiritual deification is consummated at entry into Paradise. Full deification is achieved at the resurrection on Judgment Day, via material or physical deification, when the body is deified. Only saints will be fully deified, whereas the damned will only be made immortal. The whole Universe is unconditionally predestined for deification on Judgment Day, save for humans and angels, whose predestination to deification is conditioned on moral behavior.

Despite the theological differences, in Catholic church art depictions of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary in art and the Ascension of Jesus in Christian art share many similarities in composition to apotheosis subjects, as do many images of saints being raised to heaven. These last may use &quot;apotheosis&quot; in their modern titles. Early examples were often of the founders of religious orders, later canonized, with those of Saint Ignatius Loyola in the Church of the Gesù (Andrea Pozzo, 1691–1694, to the side of the nave cupola) and Saint Dominic in Santi Domenico e Sisto (1674–1675) two examples in Rome.

The &quot;Allegory of Divine Providence and Barberini Power&quot; by Pietro da Cortona (1630s) celebrated Pope Urban VIII and his family, combining heraldic symbols including the crossed keys of the papacy and giant bees representing the Barberini family with personifications.

===Eastern Orthodox Church===

In Eastern Orthodox theology, Theosis is the transformation of oneself in union with God. The &quot;theosis&quot; transformation includes a purification of the body and mind (&quot;catharsis&quot;), an illumination via a vision of God (&quot;theoria&quot;). In Eastern Christianity, the purpose of human life is &quot;theosis&quot;. According to Hierotheos (Vlachos), this process is based on direct spiritual insight (&quot;gnosis&quot;) rather than the rational thought or intellectual and academic pursuits primary in Western Christian traditions.

===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), believes in apotheosis along the lines of the Christian tradition of divinization or deification but refers to it as exaltation, or eternal life, and considers it to be accomplished by &quot;sanctification&quot;. They believe that people may live with God throughout eternity in families and eventually become gods themselves but remain subordinate to God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit. While the primary focus of the LDS Church is on Jesus of Nazareth and his atoning sacrifice for man, Latter-day Saints believe that one purpose for Christ&#x27;s mission and for his atonement is the exaltation or Christian deification of man. The third Article of Faith of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints states that all men may be saved from sin by the atonement of Jesus Christ, and LDS Gospel Doctrine (as published) states that all men will be saved and will be resurrected from death. However, only those who are sufficiently obedient and accept the atonement and the grace and mercy of Jesus Christ before the resurrection and final judgment will be &quot;exalted&quot; and receive a literal Christian deification.

A quote often attributed to the early Church leader Lorenzo Snow in 1837, is &quot;As man now is, God once was: As God now is, man may be.&quot; The teaching was taught first by Joseph Smith while he was pointing to in the New Testament; he said that &quot;God himself, the Father of us all, dwelt on an earth, the same as Jesus Christ himself did.&quot; Many scholars also have discussed the correlation between Latter-day Saint belief in exaltation and the ancient Christian theosis, or deification, as set forth by early Church Fathers. Several 

Members of the Church believe that the original Christian belief in man&#x27;s divine potential gradually lost its meaning and importance in the centuries after the death of the apostles, as doctrinal changes by post-apostolic theologians caused Christians to lose sight of the true nature of God and his purpose for creating humanity. The concept of God&#x27;s nature that was eventually accepted as Christian doctrine in the 4th century set divinity apart from humanity by defining the Godhead as three persons sharing a common divine substance. That classification of God in terms of a substance is not found in scripture but, in many aspects, mirrored the Greek metaphysical philosophies that are known to have influenced the thinking of Church Fathers. Latter-day Saints teach that by modern revelation, God restored the knowledge that he is the literal father of our spirits (Hebrews 12:9) and that the Biblical references to God creating mankind in his image and likeness are in no way allegorical. As such, Mormons assert that as the literal offspring of God the Father (Acts 17:28–29), humans have the potential to be heirs of his glory and co-heirs with Christ (Romans 8:16–17). The glory, Mormons believe, lies not in God&#x27;s substance but in his intelligence: in other words, light and truth (Doctrine and Covenants 93:36). Thus, the purpose of humans is to grow and progress to become like the Father in Heaven. Mortality is seen as a crucial step in the process in which God&#x27;s spirit children gain a body, which, though formed in the image of the Father&#x27;s body, is subject to pain, illness, temptation, and death. The purpose of this earth life is to learn to choose the right in the face of that opposition, thereby gaining essential experience and wisdom. The level of intelligence we attain in this life will rise in the Resurrection (Doctrine and Covenants 130:18–19). Bodies will then be immortal like those of the Father and the Son (Philippians 3:21), but the degree of glory to which each person will resurrect is contingent upon the Final Judgment (Revelation 20:13, 1 Corinthians 15:40–41). Those who are worthy to return to God&#x27;s presence can continue to progress towards a fullness of God&#x27;s glory, which Mormons refer to as eternal life, or exaltation (Doctrine and Covenants 76).

The Latter-day Saint concept of apotheosis/exaltation is expressed in Latter-day scriptures (Mosiah 3:19, Alma 13:12, D&amp;C 78:7, D&amp;C 78:22, D&amp;C 84:4, D&amp;C 84:23, D&amp;C 88:68, D&amp;C 93:28) and is expressed by a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles: &quot;Though stretched by our challenges, by living righteously and enduring well we can eventually become sufficiently more like Jesus in our traits and attributes, that one day we can dwell in the Father&#x27;s presence forever and ever&quot; (Neal Maxwell, October 1997).

In early 2014, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints published an essay on the official church website specifically addressing the foundations, history, and official beliefs regarding apotheosis. The essay addresses the scriptural foundations of this belief, teachings of the early Church Fathers on the subject of deification, and the teachings of modern Church leaders, starting with Joseph Smith.

===Wesleyan Protestantism===

Distinctively, in Wesleyan Protestantism theosis sometimes implies the doctrine of entire sanctification which teaches, in summary, that it is the Christian&#x27;s goal, in principle possible to achieve, to live without any (voluntary) sin (Christian perfection). Wesleyan theologians detect the influence on Wesley from the Eastern Fathers, who saw the drama of salvation leading to the deification (apotheosis) of the human, in order that such perfection as originally part of human nature in creation but distorted by the fall might bring fellowship with the divine.

== Druze faith ==
The Druze faith further split from Isma&#x27;ilism as it developed its own unique doctrines, and finally separated from both Ismāʿīlīsm and Islam altogether; these include the belief that the Imam Al-Ḥākim bi-Amr Allāh was God incarnate. Hamza ibn Ali ibn Ahmad is considered the founder of the Druze faith and the primary author of the Druze manuscripts, he proclaimed that God became flesh, assumed a human nature, and became a man in the form of al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah.

Historian David R. W. Bryer defines the Druzes as &quot;ghulat&quot; of Isma&#x27;ilism, since they exaggerated the cult of the caliph al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah and considered him divine; he also defines the Druzes as a religion that deviated from Islam. He also added that as a result of this deviation, the Druze faith &quot;seems as different from Islam as Islam is from Christianity or Christianity is from Judaism&quot;. The Druze deify al-Hākim bi-Amr Allāh, attributing to him divine qualities similar to those Christians attribute to Jesus.

==Music==
Apart from the visual arts, several works of classical music use the term in the titles or works or sections.

In French Baroque music it was an alternative title to tombeau (&quot;tomb&quot; or &quot;tombstone&quot;) for &quot;memorial pieces&quot; for chamber forces to commemorate individuals who were friends or patrons. François Couperin wrote two pieces titled as apotheoses, one for Arcangelo Corelli (&quot;Le Parnasse, ou L&#x27;Apothéose de Corelli&quot;), and one for Jean Baptiste Lully (&quot;L&#x27;Apothéose de Lully&quot;), whose movements have titles such as &quot;Enlévement de Lully au Parnasse&quot; (&quot;The raising of Lully to Parnassus&quot;).

In Romantic music, apotheosis sections usually contain the appearance of a theme in grand or exalted form, typically as a finale. The term is especially associated with the symphonic works of Franz Liszt, where &quot;the main theme, which may by and large be considered as characterizing the hero, is presented in its constituent elements blown up beyond all proportions and, because it is typically slowed down tremendously, is split up into smaller segments&quot;. Such a treatment has often been seen by 20th-century critics as &quot;vacuous bombast&quot;.

Richard Wagner famously used the term metaphorically in describing Beethoven&#x27;s Seventh Symphony as &quot;the apotheosis of the dance&quot;.

Hector Berlioz used &quot;Apotheose&quot; as the title of the final movement of his &quot;Grande symphonie funèbre et triomphale&quot;, a work composed in 1846 for the dedication of a monument to France&#x27;s war dead. Two of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky&#x27;s ballets, &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; and &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;, contain apotheoses as finales; the same is true of Ludwig Minkus&#x27;s &quot;La Bayadère&quot;. Igor Stravinsky composed two ballets, &quot;Apollo&quot; and &quot;Orpheus&quot;, which both contain episodes entitled &quot;Apotheose&quot;. The concluding tableau of Maurice Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Ma mère l&#x27;Oye&quot; is also titled &quot;Apotheose.&quot; Czech composer Karel Husa, concerned in 1970 about arms proliferation and environmental deterioration, named his musical response &quot;Apotheosis for This Earth&quot;. Aram Khachaturian entitled a segment of his ballet &quot;Spartacus&quot; &quot;Sunrise and Apotheosis.&quot;

==Poetry==
Samuel Menashe (1925–2011) wrote a poem entitled &quot;Apotheosis,&quot; as did Barbara Kingsolver. Emily Dickinson (1830–1886) wrote &quot;Love, Poem 18: Apotheosis.&quot; The poet Dejan Stojanović&#x27;s &quot;Dancing of Sounds&quot; contains the line, &quot;Art is apotheosis.&quot; Paul Laurence Dunbar wrote a poem entitled &quot;Love&#x27;s Apotheosis.&quot; Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote a poem entitled &quot;The Apotheosis, or the Snow-Drop&quot; in 1787.

Parodic Apotheoses include the conclusion of Alexander Pope&#x27;s mock heroic &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot;, where the lock of hair that has caused the dispute rises to the heavens:

==Anthropolatry==
Anthropolatry is the deification and worship of humans. It was practiced in ancient Japan towards their emperors. Followers of Socinianism were later accused of practicing anthropolatry. Anthropologist Ludwig Feuerbach professed a religion to worship all human beings while Auguste Comte venerated only individuals who made positive contributions and excluded those who did not.

<text>Grytviken ( ) is a hamlet on South Georgia in the South Atlantic. Formerly a whaling station, it was the largest settlement on the island. Grytviken is located at the head of King Edward Cove within the larger Cumberland East Bay, considered the best harbour on the island. The location&#x27;s name, meaning &quot;pot bay&quot;, was coined in 1902 by the Swedish Antarctic Expedition and documented by the surveyor Johan Gunnar Andersson, after the expedition found old English try pots used to render seal oil at the site. Settlement was re-established on 16 November 1904 by Norwegian Antarctic explorer Carl Anton Larsen on the long-used site of former whaling settlements. 

Grytviken is built on a substantial area of sheltered, flat land and has a good supply of fresh water. Although it was the largest settlement on South Georgia, the island&#x27;s administration was based at the nearby British Antarctic Survey research station at King Edward Point. The whaling station closed in December 1966 when dwindling whale stocks made it financially unviable.

Grytviken no longer has permanent residents but occasionally accommodates researchers and British administrative and military personnel. It is also temporarily inhabited during summer months by a few staff who manage the South Georgia Museum. The settlement has become a popular attraction for Antarctic cruise lines, with many tourists visiting the resting places of polar explorers Sir Ernest Shackleton and Frank Wild in Grytviken&#x27;s graveyard. Grytviken is located west of King Edward Point, the administrative capital of South Georgia and its only remaining continuously inhabited settlement.

== History ==

=== Carl Anton Larsen ===

The settlement at Grytviken was established on 16 November 1904 by the Norwegian sea captain Carl Anton Larsen, as a whaling station for his &quot;Compañía Argentina de Pesca&quot; (Argentine Fishing Company). It was successful, with 195 whales taken in the first season. The whalers used every part of the animals – the blubber, meat, bones and viscera were rendered to extract the oil, and the bones and meat were turned into fertiliser and fodder. Elephant seals were also hunted for their blubber. Around 300 men worked at the station during its heyday, operating during the southern summer from October to March. A few remained over the winter to maintain the boats and factory. Every few months a transport ship would bring essential supplies to the station and take away the oil and other produce. The following year the Argentine Government established a meteorological station.

Carl Anton Larsen, the founder of Grytviken, was a naturalised Briton born in Sandefjord, Norway. In his application for British citizenship, filed with the magistrate of South Georgia and granted in 1910, Captain Larsen wrote: &quot;I have given up my Norwegian citizen&#x27;s rights and have resided here since I started whaling in this colony on the 16 November 1904 and have no reason to be of any other citizenship than British, as I have had and intend to have my residence here still for a long time.&quot; His family in Grytviken included his wife, three daughters and two sons.

As the manager of Compañía Argentina de Pesca, Larsen organised the construction of Grytviken, a remarkable undertaking accomplished by a team of sixty Norwegians between their arrival on 16 November and commencement of production at the newly built whale-oil factory on 24 December 1904.
Larsen chose the whaling station&#x27;s site during his 1902 visit while in command of the ship &quot;Antarctic&quot; of the Swedish Antarctic Expedition (1901–03) led by Otto Nordenskjöld. On that occasion, the name Grytviken (&quot;The Pot Cove&quot;) was given by the Swedish archaeologist and geologist Johan Gunnar Andersson who surveyed part of Thatcher Peninsula and found numerous artefacts and features from sealers&#x27; habitation and industry, including a shallop (a type of small boat) and several try pots used to boil seal oil. One of those try pots, having the inscription &quot;Johnson and Sons, Wapping Dock, London&quot; is preserved at the South Georgia Museum in Grytviken.

Managers and other senior officers of the whaling stations often had their families living together with them. Among them was Fridthjof Jacobsen whose wife Klara Olette Jacobsen gave birth to two of their children in Grytviken; their daughter Solveig Gunbjørg Jacobsen was the first child ever born and raised south of the Antarctic Convergence, on 8 October 1913. Several more children have been born on South Georgia: recently even aboard visiting private yachts.

The whale population in the seas around the island was substantially reduced over the following sixty years until the station closed in December 1966, by which time the whale stocks were so low that their continued exploitation was unviable. Even now, the shore around Grytviken is littered with whale bones and the rusting remains of whale oil processing plants and abandoned whaling ships.

=== Ernest Shackleton ===

Grytviken is closely associated with the explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton. Shackleton&#x27;s Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition set out from London on 1 August 1914, to reach the Weddell Sea on 10 January 1915, where the pack ice closed in on their ship, . The ship was broken by the ice on 27 October 1915. The 28 crew members managed to flee to Elephant Island off Antarctica, bringing three small boats with them. Shackleton and five other men managed to reach the southern coast of South Georgia in . They arrived at Cave Cove, and camped at Peggotty Bluff, from where they trekked to Stromness on the northeast coast. From Grytviken, Shackleton organised a rescue operation to bring home the remaining men.

He again returned to Grytviken during the Shackleton–Rowett Expedition and this is where he died, aged just 47, shortly after New Year&#x27;s Day, prior to the expedition heading south to Antarctica. His widow chose South Georgia as his final resting place so this is where he remained. His grave is located south of Grytviken, alongside those of whalers who had died on the island.

On 27 November 2011, the ashes of Frank Wild, Shackleton&#x27;s &quot;right-hand man,&quot; were interred on the right side of Shackleton&#x27;s grave-site. The inscription on the rough-hewn granite block set to mark the spot reads &quot;Frank Wild 1873–1939, Shackleton&#x27;s right-hand man.&quot; Wild&#x27;s relatives and Shackleton&#x27;s only granddaughter, Alexandra Shackleton, attended a service conducted by Richard Hines, rector of the Falkland Islands. The writer Angie Butler discovered the ashes in the vault of Braamfontein Cemetery, Johannesburg, while researching her book &quot;The Quest for Frank Wild&quot;. She said &quot;His ashes will now be where they were always supposed to be. It just took them a long time getting there.&quot;

=== Falklands War ===

During the Falklands War, Grytviken was captured by Argentine forces in early April 1982 following a brief battle with Royal Marines. The Royal Marines, SAS and SBS retook the settlement three weeks later without a shot being fired in return.

Supported by the corvette on 3 April 1982, ARA &quot;Bahía Paraíso&quot; landed a party of Argentine marines who attacked the platoon of 22 Royal Marines deployed at Grytviken. The two-hour battle resulted in ARA &quot;Guerrico&quot; being damaged and an Argentine Puma helicopter shot down. The Argentine forces sustained three men killed and a similar number of wounded, with one wounded on the British side. The British commanding officer Lieutenant Keith Mills was awarded a Distinguished Service Cross for the defence of South Georgia.

While the British magistrate and other civilians and military present in Grytviken were removed from South Georgia, another 15 Britons remained beyond Argentine reach. The losses suffered at Grytviken prevented Argentina from occupying the rest of the island, with Bird Island base, and field camps at Schlieper Bay, Lyell Glacier and St. Andrew&#x27;s Bay remaining under British control.

On 25 April, the Royal Navy damaged and captured the Argentine submarine at South Georgia. The Argentine garrison in Grytviken surrendered without returning fire. The following day the detachment in Leith Harbour commanded by Captain Alfredo Astiz also surrendered. One prisoner, Felix Artuso, was shot when guards mistakenly believed he was trying to sabotage &quot;Santa Fe&quot;, and was buried at Grytviken Cemetery. The Argentine personnel were removed from the South Sandwich Islands by HMS &quot;Endurance&quot; on 20 June. Due to evidence of an unauthorised visit, the closed station Corbeta Uruguay was destroyed in January 1983.

=== Current situation ===

Along with the surrounding area, the station has been declared an Area of Special Tourist Interest (ASTI).

Grytviken is a popular stop for cruise ships visiting Antarctica, and tourists usually land to visit Shackleton&#x27;s grave. The South Georgia Museum is housed in the manager&#x27;s house of the former whaling station, and is open during the summer tourist season.

The station&#x27;s church is the only building which retains its original purpose; it is still used occasionally for services. There have been several marriages in Grytviken, the first being registered on 24 February 1932, between A.G.N. Jones and Vera Riches.

On 28 January 2007, a service was conducted in remembrance of Anders Hansen (a Norwegian whaler buried at Grytviken Cemetery in 1943) and to celebrate his great-great-grandson Axel Wattø Eide&#x27;s baptism occurring in Oslo the same day.
Multiple wrecks dot Grytviken, and its environs. The ships , and were beached, and left to rust, after decades of service.

== Geography ==
=== Climate ===
Grytviken and King Edward Point have a tundra climate (Köppen &quot;ET&quot;) with long, cold winters and short, cool summers. The highest temperature ever recorded at Grytviken/King Edward Point was on 10 March 1922.

<text>Jēkabs Peterss (, &quot;Yakov Khristoforovich Peters&quot;, ; – 25 April 1938) was a Latvian Communist revolutionary who played a part in the establishment of the Soviet Union. Together with Felix Dzerzhinsky, he was one of the founders and chiefs of the Cheka, the secret police of the Soviet Russia. He was the Deputy Chairman of the Cheka from 1918 and briefly the acting Chairman of the Cheka from 7 July to 22 August 1918.

==Early years==
He was born on 3 December 1886 in Brinken volost of Kreis Hasenpoth, Courland Governorate (now Nīkrāce parish, Skrunda Municipality), the son of Latvian farmers. He became a member of the Latvian Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party in 1904. In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution of 1905 he was arrested in March 1907 for the attempted murder of a factory director in Libau, but was later acquitted by the Riga military court in 1908. Peterss emigrated to England and lived in London, where he was a member of the London Group of the Social Democracy of Latvia and of the British Socialist Party.

=== The Siege of Sidney Street ===
Peterss was a first cousin of Fritz Svaars, a Latvian anarchist, who was suspected of sabotage, robbery and of the murders of a shopkeeper and a policeman during the 1905 revolution, and was arrested and tortured in Riga, but escaped early in 1906. He moved to London, and was one of a gang who tried to rob a jeweler&#x27;s shop in Houndsditch, in December 1910. Caught in the act, they killed three unarmed police officers. Svaars and a fellow anarchist were traced to a house in Sidney Street in January 1911, and opened fire on the police, setting off the Siege of Sidney Street which ended with the deaths of both suspects. Peterss was arrested at his home in Turner Street, London, on 22 December. Unlike his cousin, he did not attempt to resist arrest. In May 1911, he and three other Latvian emigres were tried in the Old Bailey. The judge ordered the jury to acquit Peterss on the charge of murder, for lack of evidence. After he had given evidence under cross-examination, he was acquitted of the separate charge of conspiring to commit a burglary.

=== Family ===
In 1916, he married May Freeman, the daughter of a London banker, by whom he had already fathered a daughter, Maisie Peters-Freeman (born 1914). After the Russian revolution, he invited his wife and daughter to join him there, where they discovered that he had a new family. Maisie was never able to leave Russia and died there in 1971.

==October Revolution==
Peterss returned to Russia in May 1917 after the February Revolution. In Riga, Peterss became one of the leaders of the Social Democracy of Latvia working at the front-lines of the Northern Front. During the German advance he moved to Valmiera where he was an editor of the party newspaper &quot;Cīņa&quot;. Peterss was a peasant representative of the Governorate of Livonia to the Democratic discussion initiated by Kerensky.

Moving to Petrograd, he actively participated in the Bolshevik revolution of October 1917 as a member of the Military-Revolutionary Committee in Petrograd. At that time he was preparing military units for the October Revolution. Afterward, he was a member of Cheka Collegiate, the Deputy Chairman of the Commission, and the chairman of the Revolutionary Tribunal. He participated in the disclosure of the alleged Lockhart plot as well as leading the liquidation of the Left SR mutiny of 1918. Following Dzerzhinsky&#x27;s resignation in the aftermath of the Left SR Uprising, assassination of Mirbach, and the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Peterss briefly served as the chief of the Cheka until Dzerzhinsky resumed his duties. As one of the Cheka&#x27;s leaders, Peterss was responsible for the first major Cheka operations involving killings. These were against alleged anarchists in Petrograd and later in May 1918 against anarchists in Petrograd and Moscow. He also was involved in the investigation of the SR attempt on Lenin&#x27;s life in August 1918 (Fanni Kaplan case), for the indiscriminate Red Terror campaigns and reprisals that followed. He called it a &quot;Hysterical Terror&quot; in the newspaper &quot;Utro Moskvy&quot; (#21) of November 4, 1918. During these times appeared a term &quot;room of souls&quot; in numerous prisons such as Butyrka.

In March 1919, he was appointed as the Chief of internal defense in Petrograd, and then the Commandant of the reinforced raion. Following the retreat of the Yudenich forces he was appointed as the Commandant of the reinforced raion in Kiev in August 1919. Upon the sack of Kiev he was a member of the Military Council in Tula. In winter 1919–20 Peters became the deputy chairman of the Special Committee of the STO in providing military preparations on railways.

==Post-revolution==
In 1920, he represented the Cheka in the Northern Caucasus and served there as the Commissar of the Northern Caucasus Railways. There is a story that when workers in Rostov-on-Don came to him complaining about starvation, Peters told them: &quot;Is this famine, when your Rostov garbage pits are chock-full of various garbage and leftovers? In Moscow, where the garbage pits are completely empty and clean - as if they had been licked clean - there is hunger there!&quot;

In 1920–1922, he was the Cheka plenipotentiary in Turkestan ASSR, where he also was the local party bureau member. There he led numerous operations against the anti-Bolshevik formations of Dutov, Annenkov, Enver Pasha and Dzhanuzakov. He returned to Moscow in 1922 and worked as a high-ranking official in the OGPU, Rabkrin, and as the chief of the Eastern department of the GPU (created on June 2, 1922). In 1930–34, he was chairman of the Moscow Control Commission. 

During the Great Purge, as a part of the so-called &quot;Latvian Operation&quot;, Peterss was arrested and executed by the NKVD on April 25, 1938, at the Kommunarka shooting ground. He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1956.

== Reputation ==
In 1919, an American diplomat testified to Congress that Peterss was, with another Cheka leader Aleksandr Eiduk, considered the &quot;most blood-thirsty monster in Russia&quot;. At that time, Peterss&#x27; influence was vastly overstated by English language newspapers, because he was known to the police in the UK, and because he was the only one of the founders of Cheka who spoke English. On 25 January 1919, &quot;The Times&quot; in London belatedly learnt that the Bolsheviks had been divided over whether to conduct a revolutionary war with Germany, and claimed that &quot;One party is headed by Lenin, the other by Trotsky, Peterss, Radek and Zinovieff...The Trotsky and Peters party believe in heroic measures...&quot; Peterss did not merit a mention in any of Trotsky&#x27;s extensive writings about the period, and certainly was not in the front ranks of the Bolsheviks leadership. As a Chekist, he undoubtedly had many people killed, yet the portrayal of him as &#x27;the most blood-thirsty monster&#x27; contrasts with the opinion of the British diplomat, Robert Bruce Lockhart, who spent a month under arrest in Moscow in 1918 and was interrogated by Peterss. Bruce Lockhart wrote:

<doc id="494687" wikidata="Q7978116" url="?curid=494687" title="Weapons of the Vietnam War">
<text>The Vietnam War involved the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) or North Vietnamese Army (NVA), National Liberation Front for South Vietnam (NLF) or Viet Cong (VC), and the armed forces of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA), Soviet Armed Forces, Korean People&#x27;s Army, Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), United States Armed Forces, Republic of Korea Armed Forces, Royal Thai Armed Forces, Australian Defence Force, and New Zealand Defence Force, with a variety of irregular troops.

Nearly all United States-allied forces were armed with U.S. weapons including the M1 Garand, M1 carbine, M14 rifle, and M16 rifle. The Australian and New Zealand forces employed the 7.62 mm L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle as their service rifle, with the occasional use of the M16 rifle.

The PAVN, although having inherited a variety of American, French, and Japanese weapons from World War II and the First Indochina War (aka French Indochina War), were largely armed and supplied by the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the Soviet Union, and its Warsaw Pact allies. Further, some weapons—notably anti-personnel explosives, the K-50M (a PPSh-41 copy), and &quot;home-made&quot; versions of the RPG-2—were manufactured in North Vietnam. By 1969 the US Army had identified 40 rifle/carbine types, 22 machine gun types, 17 types of mortar, 20 recoilless rifle or rocket launcher types, nine types of antitank weapons, and 14 anti-aircraft artillery weapons used by ground troops on all sides. Also in use, mostly by anti-communist forces, were the 24 types of armored vehicles and self-propelled artillery, and 26 types of field artillery and rocket launchers.

==Communist forces and weapons==

During the early stages of their insurgency, the Viet Cong mainly sustained itself with captured arms (often of American manufacture) or crude, self-made weapons (e.g. copies of the US Thompson submachine gun and shotguns made of galvanized pipes). Most arms were captured from poorly defended ARVN militia outposts.

Communist forces were principally armed with Chinese and Soviet weaponry though some VC guerrilla units were equipped with Western infantry weapons either captured from French stocks during the first Indochina war, such as the MAT-49, or from ARVN units or requisitioned through illicit purchase.

By Autumn of 1967, all Viet Cong battalions were reequipped with arms of Soviet design such as the AK-47 and the RPG-2. Their weapons were principally of Chinese or Soviet manufacture. The period up to the conventional phase in the 1970, the Viet Cong and NVA were mostly limited to mortars, recoilless rifles, and small-arms and had significantly lighter equipment and firepower relative to the US arsenal, relying on ambushes, with superior stealth, planning, marksmanship, and small-unit tactics to face the disproportionate US technological advantage.

Many divisions within the NVA would incorporate armoured and mechanised battalions including the Type 59 tank, BTR-60, Type 60 artillery, and rapidly altered and integrated new war doctrines following the Tet Offensive into a mobile combined-arms force. The North Vietnamese had both amphibious tanks (such as the PT-76) and light tanks (such the Type 62) used during the conventional phase. Experimental Soviet equipment started being used against ARVN forces at the same time, including Man-portable air-defense system SA-7 &quot;Grail&quot; and anti-tank missiles including the AT-3 &quot;Sagger&quot;. By 1975, they had fully transformed from the strategy of mobile light-infantry and using the people&#x27;s war concept used against the United States.
==US weapons==
The American M16 rifle and XM177 carbine, which both replaced the M14, were lighter and considered more accurate than the AK-47 but in Vietnam was prone to &quot;failure to extract&quot;, in which the spent cartridge case remained stuck in the chamber after a round was fired, preventing the next round from feeding and jamming the gun. This was ultimately traced to an inadequately tested switch in propellants from DuPont&#x27;s proprietary IMR 4475 to Olin&#x27;s WC 846, that Army Ordnance had ordered out of concern for standardization and mass production capacity.

The heavily armored, 90 mm gun M48A3 &#x27;Patton&#x27; tank saw extensive action during the Vietnam War and over 600 were deployed with U.S. forces. They played an important role in infantry support though there were a few tank versus tank battles. The M67A1 flamethrower tank (nicknamed the Zippo) was an M48 variant used in Vietnam. The use of this euphemistically nicknamed tank should not be confused with the widespread use of actual Zippo lighters to burn villages, which gave rise to the nickname of &quot;Zippo squads&quot;. (Far from all such squads fielded the tank.) The Zippo nickname was also applied to man-portable flamethrowers. Artillery was used extensively by both sides but the Americans were able to ferry the lightweight 105 mm M102 howitzer by helicopter to remote locations on quick notice. With its range, the Soviet 130 mm M-46 towed field gun was a highly regarded weapon and used to good effect by the PAVN. It was countered by the long-range, American 175 mm M107 Self-Propelled Gun (nicknamed Miller).

The United States had air superiority, though many aircraft were lost to surface-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft artillery. U.S. airpower was credited with breaking the siege of Khe Sanh and blunting the 1972 Easter Offensive against South Vietnam. At sea, the U.S. Navy had the run of the coastline, using aircraft carriers as platforms for offshore strikes and other naval vessels for offshore artillery support. Offshore naval fire played a pivotal role in the Battle of Huế in February 1968, providing accurate fire in support of the U.S. counter-offensive to retake the city.

The Vietnam War was the first conflict that saw wide-scale tactical deployment of helicopters. The Bell UH-1 Iroquois nicknamed &quot;Huey&quot; was used extensively in counter-guerilla operations both as a troop carrier and a gunship. In the latter role it was outfitted with a variety of armaments including M60 machine guns, multi-barrelled 7.62 mm Miniguns and unguided air-to-surface rockets. The Hueys were also successfully used in MEDEVAC and search and rescue roles. Two aircraft which were prominent in the war were the AC-130 &quot;Spectre&quot; Gunship and the UH-1 &quot;Huey&quot; gunship. The AC-130 was a heavily armed ground-attack aircraft variant of the C-130 Hercules transport plane; it was used to provide close air support, air interdiction and force protection. The AC-130H &quot;Spectre&quot; was armed with two 20 mm M61 Vulcan cannons, one Bofors 40 mm autocannon, and one 105 mm M102 howitzer. The Huey is a military helicopter powered by one turboshaft engine, and about 7,000 UH-1 aircraft saw service in Vietnam. At their disposal ground forces had access to B-52 and F-4 Phantom II and others to launch napalm, white phosphorus, tear gas and chemical weapons as well. The aircraft ordnance used during the war included precision-guided munition, cluster bombs, a thickening–gelling agent generally mixed with petroleum or a similar fuel for use in an incendiary device, initially against buildings and later mostly as an anti-personnel weapon that sticks to skin and can burn down to the bone.

The Claymore M18A1, an anti-personnel mine, was widely used. It is command-detonated, directionally shooting 700 steel pellets into the kill zone.

<doc id="494694" wikidata="Q4951964" url="?curid=494694" title="Boxing in the 1950s">
<text>During the 1950s, a couple of relatively new developments changed the world: World War II had only been over for five years when the 1950s began, and television was beginning to make a major impact internationally. In boxing, changes connected to these developments could be seen too, as boxers who fought at the 1940s conflict returned to their homes and many of them were back in the ring. Television producers were in love with sports, which provided the viewer with an opportunity to observe sporting events live, and boxing was not the exception to the rule; many television networks began to feature fights live during the weekends, and the &quot;Gillette Friday Night Fights&quot; proved to be one of the most popular boxing television series in American history.

The dawn of the jet airplane era in 1958 also helped boxing expand worldwide: with airplanes flying faster and more frequently between cities far away from each other, more and more world title fights began to be fought outside the United States. Vic Toweel became South Africa&#x27;s first world boxing champion, Jimmy Carruthers did the same for Australia, Pascual Pérez was the first from Argentina, Yoshio Shirai (who was beaten by Pérez), won Japan&#x27;s first world title, and Hogan Bassey won the first belt for Nigeria.

Popular American fighters in the 1950s proved legendary: Sugar Ray Robinson would still win (and lose) world titles, Rocky Marciano became the only heavyweight world champion in history to retire with perfect record. Jersey Joe Walcott the oldest heavyweight champion (until George Foreman regained the title in 1994), Archie Moore broke the all-time knockout record as well as the record for the oldest champion, at 48, for &quot;any&quot; division, Ezzard Charles proved to be a reliable substitute for Joe Louis as heavyweight champ, and Floyd Patterson emerged as the youngest heavyweight champion in history (coincidentally, he beat Moore for the title left vacant by Marciano). Patterson remained the youngest heavyweight champion in history until November 22, 1986, when a 20-year-old Mike Tyson defeated the 31-year-old WBC Heavyweight Champion Trevor Berbick by TKO in round 2. 

The dark side of boxing once again emerged: Jake LaMotta alleged at a hearing that he had thrown a fight with Billy Fox in exchange for a try at the world Middleweight title, and Jim Norris, an important promoter of the time, was associated with Blinky Palermo and Frankie Carbo, two Mafia members of the time.

== Life and career ==
Takeuchi was born on 1 April 1980 in Urawa, Saitama, Japan. She was &quot;discovered&quot; during spring break in Harajuku after junior high school.

Takeuchi was married to Shidō Nakamura II (who had co-starred with Takeuchi in the film &quot;Be With You&quot;) from 10 May 2005 until their divorce on 29 February 2008. She had a son with Nakamura who was born in November 2005. Prior to the couple&#x27;s divorce, Nakamura had apologized for a drunk driving incident where he was with actress Aya Okamoto and later seen with actress Saki Takaoka. After the drunk driving incident, Takeuchi reportedly moved to live in her management office shortly before filing for divorce in October 2006.

Takeuchi married actor Taiki Nakabayashi on 27 February 2019. Her son, in junior high school at the time was reported to have actively encouraged her second marriage. In November 2019, she announced she was pregnant and gave birth to her second son in January 2020.
Takeuchi was known for her earlier roles, starring in Japanese television dramas such as &quot;Mukodono&quot; (My Husband), &quot;Lunch no Joō&quot; (The Queen of Lunch), &quot;Egao No Hōsoku&quot;, and &quot;Pride&quot;, as well as NHK&#x27;s Asadora television series &quot;Asuka&quot;. In the romantic comedies &quot;Mukodono&quot;, she and Nagase Tomoya played newlyweds and in &quot;Lunch no Joō&quot;, she played a girl with a mysterious past who loves her lunch. In the drama &quot;Egao no Hōsoku&quot;, her character experiences meeting new people while supporting a manga writer and in &quot;Pride&quot;, her character is the love interest of a hockey player portrayed by Takuya Kimura.

Takeuchi&#x27;s earlier films include &quot;Hoshi Ni Negaiwo&quot;, &quot;Yomigaeri&quot;, and &quot;Be with You&quot; (&quot;Ima, Ai ni Yukimasu&quot;).

In 2010, Takeuchi appeared on the science fiction American TV serial &quot;FlashForward&quot; in two episodes (as a character portrayed in five). Director Michael Nankin called her &quot;Japan&#x27;s answer to Audrey Hepburn.&quot; Takeuchi&#x27;s dialogue was in Japanese, but she said the experience caused her to make it a goal to master English as she wished she had been able to communicate better with the other cast members and crew.

In 2018, Takeuchi portrayed the titular character in Hulu/HBO Asia series &quot;Miss Sherlock&quot;, an adaptation of Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes detective stories.

<text>The goal of fisheries management is to produce sustainable biological, environmental and socioeconomic benefits from renewable aquatic resources. Wild fisheries are classified as renewable when the organisms of interest (e.g., fish, shellfish, amphibians, reptiles and marine mammals) produce an annual biological surplus that with judicious management can be harvested without reducing future productivity. Fishery management employs activities that protect fishery resources so sustainable exploitation is possible, drawing on fisheries science and possibly including the precautionary principle.

Modern fisheries management is often referred to as a governmental system of appropriate environmental management rules based on defined objectives and a mix of management means to implement the rules, which are put in place by a system of monitoring control and surveillance. An ecosystem approach to fisheries management has started to become a more relevant and practical way to manage fisheries. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), there are &quot;no clear and generally accepted definitions of fisheries management&quot;. However, the working definition used by the FAO and much cited elsewhere is:
The integrated process of information gathering, analysis, planning, consultation, decision-making, allocation of resources and formulation and implementation, with necessary law enforcement to ensure environmental compliance, of regulations or rules which govern fisheries activities in order to ensure the continued productivity of the resources and the accomplishment of other fisheries objectives.

==Objectives==
===Political===
According to the FAO, fisheries management should be based explicitly on political objectives, ideally with transparent priorities. Political goals can also be a weak part of fisheries management, since the objectives can conflict with each other. Typical political objectives when exploiting a commercially important fish resource are to:
* maximize sustainable biomass yield
* maximize sustainable economic yield
* secure and increase employment
* secure protein production and food supplies
* increase export income

For the most recent several decades, the political goals in fisheries management of commercially important species have been rapidly evolving, primarily driven by (1) a recognition of the response of fish and other target animals to changing climate, (2) new technologies for fishing particularly on the high seas, (3) development of competing policy priorities for aquatic environments leading to a more ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management, and (4) new scientific insights about the processes affecting fish population size and recruitment.
The political objectives operative in recreational fisheries management are often substantially different from those prevalent in commercial fisheries management. For example, catch-and-release regulations are common in some types of recreational fisheries. Thus, biological yield is of less important.

===International objectives===
Fisheries objectives need to be expressed in concrete management rules. In most countries fisheries management rules should be based on the internationally agreed, though non-binding, Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, agreed at a meeting of the U.N.&#x27;s Food and Agriculture Organization FAO session in 1995. The precautionary approach it prescribes is typically implemented in concrete management rules as minimum spawning biomass, maximum fishing mortality rates, etc. In 2005 the UBC Fisheries Centre at the University of British Columbia comprehensively reviewed the performance of the world&#x27;s major fishing nations against the Code.

==Management mechanisms==
Many countries have set up Ministries/Government Departments, named &quot;Ministry of Fisheries&quot; or similar, controlling aspects of fisheries within their exclusive economic zones.
Four categories of management means have been devised, regulating either input/investment, or output, and operating either directly or indirectly:

Technical measures may include:
* prohibiting devices such as bows and arrows, and spears, or firearms
* prohibiting nets
* setting minimum mesh sizes
* limiting the average potential catch of a vessel in the fleet (vessel and crew size, gear, electronic gear and other physical &quot;inputs&quot;.
* prohibiting bait
* snagging
* limits on fish traps
* limiting the number of poles or lines per fisherman
* restricting the number of simultaneous fishing vessels
* limiting a vessel&#x27;s average operational intensity per unit time at sea
* limiting average time at sea

===Catch quotas===
Systems that use &quot;individual transferable quotas&quot; (ITQ), also called individual fishing quota limit the total catch and allocate shares of that quota among the fishers who work that fishery. Fishers can buy/sell/trade shares as they choose.

A large scale study in 2008 provided strong evidence that ITQ&#x27;s can help to prevent fishery collapse and even restore fisheries that appear to be in decline. Other studies have shown negative socio-economic consequences of ITQs, especially on small-sclale fisheries. These consequences include concentration of quota in that hands of few fishers; increased number of inactive fishers leasing their quotas to others (a phenomenon known as armchair fishermen); and detrimental effects on coastal communities.

===Elderly maternal fish===

Traditional management practices aim to reduce the number of old, slow-growing fish, leaving more room and resources for younger, faster-growing fish. Most marine fish produce huge numbers of eggs. The assumption was that younger spawners would produce plenty of viable larvae.

However, 2005 research on rockfish shows that large, elderly females are far more important than younger fish in maintaining productive fisheries. The larvae produced by these older maternal fish grow faster, survive starvation better, and are much more likely to survive than the offspring of younger fish. Failure to account for the role of older fish may help explain recent collapses of some major US West Coast fisheries. Recovery of some stocks is expected to take decades. One way to prevent such collapses is to establish marine reserves, where fishing is not allowed and fish populations age naturally.

===Precautionary principle===
&quot;A Fishery Manager&#x27;s Guidebook&quot; issued in 2002 by the FAO advises that a set of working principles should be applied to &quot;highlight the underlying key issues&quot; of fisheries management.&quot; There are 8 principles that should be considered as a whole in order to best manage a fishery. The first principle focuses on the finite nature of fish stocks and how potential yields must be estimated based on the biological constraints of the population.

In a paper published in 2007, Shertzer and Prager suggested that there can be significant benefits to stock biomass and fishery yield if management is stricter and more prompt. This is supported by recent work on the management of North Sea fisheries in accordance with ranges of acceptable fishing, where fishing at the top of the &quot;acceptable&quot; ranges is many times more risky than fishing near the bottom, but delivers only 20% more yield.
In addition there is growing evidence – and growing recognition by both fishery scientists and small-scale fishermen – that coastal marine protected areas do favour the biodiversity and resilience of ecosystems nearby, significantly enhancing the density, biomass and size of commercially exploited species in local waters.

===Human factors===

Managing fisheries is about managing people and businesses, and not about managing fish. Fisheries are managed by regulating the actions of people. If fisheries management is to be successful, then associated human factors, such as the reactions of anglers and harvesters, are of key importance, and need to be understood.

Management regulations must also consider the implications for stakeholders. Commercial fishermen rely on catches to provide for their families just as farmers rely on crops. Commercial fishing can be a traditional trade passed down from generation to generation. Most commercial fishing is based in towns built around the fishing industry; regulation changes can impact an entire town&#x27;s economy. Cuts in harvest quotas can have adverse effects on the ability of fishermen to compete with the tourism industry.

Effective management of fisheries includes involving all stakeholders in the fishery. To do this successfully, stakeholders need to feel empowered enough to make meaningful contributions to the management process.

Empowerment has a wide application but in this context it refers to a tool that gives people within the fishing communities an opportunity to shape their own future in order to cope with the impacts from large-scale commercial fishing, competition of resources, and other threats that impact fishing communities.

However, there are limits to empowerment in the fisheries management process. Empowerment maintains an involvement on the part of the state in fisheries management and no matter how empowered the other stakeholders are, the success of fisheries is not possible without the legislative powers, financial resources, educational support, and research the government provides.

This concept is not accepted by all, as some communities and individuals argue that the state should withdraw completely and let the local communities handle their own fishery management based on cultural traditions and established practices. Additionally, others have argued that co-management only empowers the wealthy and powerful which in turn solidifies and validates the already existing inequalities of fisheries management.

Empowerment working as a function of co-management, carried out correctly, will not only enable but it will authorize individuals and communities to make meaningful contributions to fisheries management. It is a mechanism that works in a loop, where an individual gains empowerment and encouragement from being a part of the group and the collective action is only successful because of its empowered individuals. In order to effectively and successfully use empowerment as co-management, it is imperative that study programs, guidelines, reading materials, manuals, and checklists are developed and incorporated into all fisheries management.

====Corruption====
Fisheries mismanagement is due, in part, to corruption. Corruption and bribery influence the number of fishing licenses that are distributed and to whom, as well as the negotiation of fishing access agreements. There is evidence of industrial fisheries corruption among the Small Island Developing States of the Pacific Ocean as well as the fisheries off the coast of West Africa. In small-scale fisheries, inspectors who are charged with regulating catch are bribed to give advance notice of surprise inspections and to relax enforcement standards. Some standards are not enforced at all due to bribery, while other infractions may result in smaller fines than mandated. Fishing gear seized during an investigation can also be returned in exchange for a bribe. Corruption of small-scale fisheries has been documented in South Africa and Lake Victoria.

===Data quality===
According to fisheries scientist Milo Adkison, the primary limitation in fisheries management decisions is the absence of quality data. Fisheries management decisions are often based on population models, but the models need quality data to be effective. He asserts that scientists and fishery managers would be better served with simpler models and improved data.

The most reliable source for summary statistics is the FAO Fisheries Department.

==Fisheries law==
Fisheries law is an emerging and specialized area of law which includes the study and analysis of different fisheries management approaches, including seafood safety regulations and aquaculture regulations. Despite its importance, this area is rarely taught at law schools around the world, which leaves a vacuum of advocacy and research.

Fisheries legislation on a national level differs greatly between countries Fisheries may also be managed on an international level. One of the first laws enacted was the &quot;United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (LOS Convention)&quot;, which entered into force in 1994. This law set the foundation for all international agreements related to oceans that followed.

==Effects of climate change==
In the past, changing climate has affected inland and offshore fisheries and such changes are likely to continue. From a fisheries perspective, the specific driving factors of climate change include rising water temperature, alterations in the hydrologic cycle, changes in nutrient fluxes, and relocation of spawning and nursery habitat. Further, changes in such factors would affect resources at all levels of biological organization, including the genetic, organism, population, and ecosystem levels. Understanding how these factors affect fisheries at a more nuanced level stand as challenges that fisheries scientists, across multiple fields, still need to face.

==Population dynamics==
Population dynamics describes the growth and decline of a given fishery stock over time, as controlled by birth, death and migration. It is the basis for understanding changing fishery patterns and issues such as habitat destruction, predation and optimal harvesting rates. The population dynamics of fisheries has been traditionally used by fisheries scientists to determine sustainable yields.

The basic accounting relation for population dynamics is the BIDE model:

: &quot;N&quot;1 = &quot;N&quot;0 + &quot;B&quot; − &quot;D&quot; + &quot;I&quot; − &quot;E&quot;

where &quot;N&quot;1 is the number of individuals at time 1, &quot;N&quot;0 is the number of individuals at time 0, &quot;B&quot; is the number of individuals born, &quot;D&quot; the number that died, &quot;I&quot; the number that immigrated, and &quot;E&quot; the number that emigrated between time 0 and time 1. While immigration and emigration can be present in wild fisheries, they are usually not measured.

Care is needed when applying population dynamics to real world fisheries. In the past, over-simplistic modelling, such as ignoring the size, age and reproductive status of the fish, focusing solely on a single species, ignoring bycatch and physical damage to the ecosystem, has accelerated the collapse of key stocks.

== Environmental impact of fishing ==
The environmental impact of fishing includes issues such as the availability of fish, overfishing, fisheries, and fisheries management; as well as the impact of industrial fishing on other elements of the environment, such as bycatch. These issues are part of marine conservation, and are addressed in fisheries science programs.

Fisheries also have an evolutionary impact on species, especially related to the implementation of minimum landing sizes.

==Ecosystem based fisheries==

According to marine ecologist Chris Frid, the fishing industry points to pollution and global warming as the causes of unprecedentedly low fish stocks in recent years, writing, &quot;Everybody would like to see the rebuilding of fish stocks and this can only be achieved if we understand all of the influences, human and natural, on fish dynamics.&quot; Overfishing has also had an effect. Frid adds, &quot;Fish communities can be altered in a number of ways, for example they can decrease if particular sized individuals of a species are targeted, as this affects predator and prey dynamics. Fishing, however, is not the sole perpetrator of changes to marine life – pollution is another example [...] No one factor operates in isolation and components of the ecosystem respond differently to each individual factor.&quot;

In contrast to the traditional approach of focusing on a single species, the ecosystem-based approach is organized in terms of ecosystem services. Ecosystem-based fishery concepts have been implemented in some regions. In 2007 a group of scientists offered the following &quot;ten commandments&quot;:

* Report to Congress (2009): The State of Science to Support an Ecosystem Approach to Regional Fishery Management National Marine Fisheries Service, NOAA Technical Memorandum NMFS-F/SPO-96.

===Ecosystem modelling software===
Ecopath, with Ecosim (EwE), is an ecosystem modelling software suite. It was initially a NOAA initiative led by Jeffrey Polovina, later primarily developed at the UBC Fisheries Centre of the University of British Columbia. In 2007, it was named as one of the ten biggest scientific breakthroughs in NOAA&#x27;s 200-year history. The citation states that Ecopath &quot;revolutionized scientists&#x27; ability worldwide to understand complex marine ecosystems&quot;. Behind this lies two decades of development work by Villy Christensen, Carl Walters, Daniel Pauly, and other fisheries scientists. As of 2010 there are 6000 registered users in 155 countries. Ecopath is widely used in fisheries management as a tool for modelling and visualising the complex relationships that exist in real world marine ecosystems.

==Performance==
The biomass of certain global fish stocks have been allowed to run down. The biomass of many species have now diminished to the point where it is no longer possible to sustainably catch the amount of fish that could be caught. According to a 2008 UN report, titled &quot;The Sunken Billions: The Economic Justification for Fisheries Reform&quot;, the world&#x27;s fishing fleets incur a &quot;$US 50 billion annual economic loss&quot; through depleted stocks and poor fisheries management. The report, produced jointly by the World Bank and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), asserts that half the world&#x27;s fishing fleet could be scrapped with no change in catch.
&quot;By improving governance of marine fisheries, society could capture a substantial part of this $50 billion annual economic loss. Through comprehensive reform, the fisheries sector could become a basis for economic growth and the creation of alternative livelihoods in many countries. At the same time, a nation&#x27;s natural capital in the form of fish stocks could be greatly increased and the negative impacts of the fisheries on the marine environment reduced.&quot;
The most prominent failure of fisheries management in recent times has perhaps been the events that lead to the collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery. More recently, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists produced a series of journalistic investigations called &quot;Looting the seas&quot;. These detail investigations into the black market for bluefin tuna, the subsidies propping up the Spanish fishing industry, and the overfishing of the Chilean jack mackerel.

==History==
Fisheries have been explicitly managed in some places for hundreds of years. More than 80 percent of the world&#x27;s commercial exploitation of fish and shellfish are harvested from natural occurring populations in the oceans and freshwater areas. For example, the Māori people, New Zealand residents for about 700 years, had prohibitions against taking more than what could be eaten and about giving back the first fish caught as an offering to sea god Tangaroa. Starting in the 18th century attempts were made to regulate fishing in the North Norwegian fishery. This resulted in the enactment of a law in 1816 on the Lofoten fishery, which established in some measure what has come to be known as territorial use rights.
&quot;The fishing banks were divided into areas belonging to the nearest fishing base on land and further subdivided into fields where the boats were allowed to fish. The allocation of the fishing fields was in the hands of local governing committees, usually headed by the owner of the onshore facilities which the fishermen had to rent for accommodation and for drying the fish.&quot;
In Europe, governmental resource protection-based fisheries management is a relatively new idea, first developed for North European fisheries after the first Overfishing Conference held in London in 1936. In 1957 British fisheries researchers Ray Beverton and Sidney Holt published a seminal work on North Sea commercial fisheries dynamics. In the 1960s the work became the theoretical platform for North European management schemes. In North America, both commercial and recreational fisheries have been actively managed for over 150 years. All U.S. states and Canadian provinces have fisheries agencies and their employees implement state, provincial, and federal laws using a broad suite of tools and procedures for both freshwater and marine fisheries.

After some years away from the field of fisheries management, Beverton criticized his earlier work in a paper given at the first World Fisheries Congress in Athens in 1992. &quot;The Dynamics of Exploited Fish Populations&quot; expressed his concerns, including the way his and Sidney Holt&#x27;s work had been misinterpreted and misused by fishery biologists and managers during the previous 30 years. Nevertheless, the institutional foundation for modern fishery management had been laid.

In 1996, the Marine Stewardship Council was founded to set standards for sustainable fishing. In 2010, the Aquaculture Stewardship Council was created to do the same for aquaculture.

A report by Prince Charles&#x27; International Sustainability Unit, the New York-based Environmental Defense Fund and 50in10 published in July 2014 estimated global fisheries were adding $270 billion a year to global GDP, but by full implementation of sustainable fishing, that figure could rise by an extra amount of as much as $50 billion.

<doc id="494706" wikidata="Q1546583" url="?curid=494706" title="Presidential library system">
<text>In the United States, the presidential library system is a nationwide network of 16 libraries administered by the Office of Presidential Libraries, which is part of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). These are repositories for preserving and making available the papers, records, collections and other historical materials of every president of the United States since Herbert Hoover, the 31st president from 1929–1933. In addition to the library services, museum exhibitions concerning the presidency are displayed.

Although recognized as having historical significance, before the mid-20th century presidential papers and effects were generally understood to be the private property of the president. Franklin D. Roosevelt (32nd president, 1933–1945) proposed to leave his papers to the public in a building donated by him on his Hyde Park, New York, estate. Since then, a series of laws established the public keeping of documents and the presidential library system. These laws now seek to create a public archive library for each presidential term, with NARA taking control of the library documents immediately upon expiration of a term of office. Additional provisions govern when the documents are made available to the public. While not sanctioned and maintained by NARA, libraries have also been organized for several presidents who preceded Hoover and the official start of the Presidential Library Office.

The library sites are sometimes referred to as presidential centers. The Barack Obama Presidential Center (44th president, 2009–2017) is the most recent facility, and operates under a new model. The Barack Obama Presidential Library is fully digitized, preserved, and administered by NARA with archival materials lent to the privately operated Presidential Center for display.

==Overview==

For every president since Herbert Hoover, presidential libraries have been established in each president&#x27;s home state in which documents, artifacts, gifts of state and museum exhibits are maintained that relate to the former president&#x27;s life and career both political and professional. Each library also provides an active series of public programs. When a president leaves office, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) establishes a presidential materials project to house and index the documents until a they are required by law to make them available to the public, either in a library building or digitally.

The first presidential library is the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum, dedicated on June 30, 1941. The George W. Bush Presidential Center became the thirteenth on May 1, 2013.

The National Archives and Records Administration uses a passport to promote visiting the Presidential libraries. When a person visits every library, NARA awards them a crystal paperweight.

===Presidential libraries outside NARA===

The presidential library system is made up of thirteen presidential libraries operated fully, or partially, by NARA. Libraries and museums have been established for earlier presidents, but they are not part of the NARA presidential library system, and are operated by private foundations, historical societies, or state governments, including the James K. Polk, William McKinley, Rutherford B. Hayes, Calvin Coolidge, Abraham Lincoln and Woodrow Wilson libraries. For example, the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum is owned and operated by the state of Illinois.

The Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace was not originally part of the presidential library system. While the Nixon Presidential Materials Staff, which administers the Nixon presidential materials under the terms of the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act, is part of NARA, the private nonprofit Richard Nixon Foundation owned and operated the Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace. In January 2004, Congress passed legislation that provided for the establishment of a federally operated Richard Nixon Presidential Library in Yorba Linda, California. In March 2005, the Archivist of the United States and John Taylor, the director of the Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace Foundation, exchanged letters on the requirements to allow the Nixon Library to become the twelfth federally funded presidential library operated by NARA by 2007, while the Nixon Foundation would continue to own the campus and operate the Nixon Library complex with NARA. On October 16, 2006, Dr. Timothy Naftali began his tenure as the first federal director of the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace, and in the winter of 2006 NARA began to transfer the 30,000 presidential gifts from the Nixon Presidential Materials Staff in College Park, Maryland, to the Yorba Linda facility. On July 11, 2007, NARA began its operations at the Nixon Library site and the facility&#x27;s name was changed to Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum.

In May 2012, on the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the Ulysses S. Grant Foundation, it selected Mississippi State University as the permanent location for Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s presidential library. Historian John Simon edited Grant&#x27;s letters into a 32-volume scholarly edition published by Southern Illinois University Press.

On April 30, 2013, both chambers of the North Dakota Legislative Assembly passed a bill appropriating $12 million to Dickinson State University to award a grant to the Theodore Roosevelt Center for construction of a building to be named the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library. To access these funds, the Theodore Roosevelt Center must first raise $3 million from non-state sources. Dickinson State University is also home to the Theodore Roosevelt Digital Library which has formed partnerships with the Library of Congress and Harvard University, among other institutions. They currently have over 25,000 items online.

On April 12, 2016, Harding 2020, a collaboration between the Harding Home, Ohio History Connection, and Marion Technical College, detailed plans to spend $7.3 million to establish the Warren G. Harding Presidential Center. Plans include restoring the Harding Home, Warren G. Harding&#x27;s historic home in Marion, Ohio, and its grounds to its 1920 appearance. A 15,000-square-foot presidential center and museum was built adjacent to the house. Harding&#x27;s presidential papers were moved from its previous location at the Ohio History Connection&#x27;s headquarters in Columbus, Ohio, to the new center. The culmination of the work, was scheduled to be completed by the spring of 2020, to coincide with the 100th anniversary of Harding&#x27;s election to the presidency. The library was scheduled to open initially on May 23, 2020, with a formal dedication ceremony on Friday, July 17, 2020. This was then delayed until September due largely to back orders on construction materials and other issues. Then, the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the opening of the museum until May 12, 2021 

In May 2017, it was announced that the Barack Obama Presidential Center, the planned location of the presidential library of Barack Obama, would not be part of the NARA system, making Obama the first president since Calvin Coolidge not to have a federally owned facility. Instead, in a &quot;new model&quot; the nonprofit Obama Foundation will partner with the NARA on digitization and making documents available. It was announced that the City of Chicago would own the center.

==History==
Historically, all presidential papers were considered the personal property of the president. Some took them at the end of their terms, others destroyed them, and many papers were scattered. Though many pre-Hoover collections now reside in the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress, others are split among other libraries, historical societies, and private collections. However, many materials have been lost or deliberately destroyed.

Lucretia Rudolph Garfield, the wife of James A. Garfield (president from March 4, 1881, until his death on September 19, 1881) added a Memorial Library wing to their family home in Mentor, Ohio, four years after his assassination. The James A. Garfield National Historic Site is operated by the National Park Service and the Western Reserve Historical Society.

===National Archives===
In 1939, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt donated his personal and presidential papers to the federal government. At the same time, Roosevelt pledged part of his estate at Hyde Park, New York, to the United States, and friends of the president formed a non-profit corporation to raise funds for the construction of the library and museum building. Roosevelt&#x27;s decision stemmed from his belief that presidential papers were an important part of the national heritage and should be accessible to the public. He asked the National Archives to take custody of his papers and other historical materials and to administer his library. On June 30, 2013, new interactive and multimedia exhibits developed by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) opened to the public as part of the first renovation of this library since its opening.

In 1950, Harry S. Truman decided that he, too, would build a library to house his presidential papers and helped to galvanize congressional action.

===Presidential Libraries Act of 1955===
In 1955, Congress passed the Presidential Libraries Act of 1955, establishing a system of privately erected and federally maintained libraries. The Act encouraged other presidents to donate their historical materials to the government and ensured the preservation of presidential papers and their availability to the people of the United States. Under this and subsequent acts, nine more libraries have been established. In each case, private and non-federal public sources provided the funds to build the library. Generally, once completed the private organization turned over the libraries to the National Archives and Records Administration to operate and maintain. The library and museum founded for Richard Nixon remained privately owned and managed for many years, but his heirs ultimately reached an agreement for it to become a NARA facility.

Until 1978, presidents, scholars, and legal professionals held the view dating back to George Washington that the records created by the president or his staff while in office remained the personal property of the president and were his to take with him when he left office. The first presidential libraries were built on this concept. NARA successfully persuaded presidents to donate their historical materials to the federal government for housing in a presidential library managed by NARA.

===Deeds of Gift===
Apart from the presidency of Richard Nixon, the handling of presidential records by NARA for the presidencies of Hoover through Carter (1929–1969, and 1973–1980) are governed by their deeds of gift, whereby the public took ownership of the records of each president.

===Nixon presidency and the Preservation Act of 1974===
In the wake of the Watergate scandal, Congress asserted public ownership and control of materials from the Nixon White House (1969–1973), under the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act of 1974.

===Presidential Records Act of 1978===
The Presidential Records Act of 1978 established that the presidential records that document the constitutional, statutory, and ceremonial duties of the president are the property of the United States Government. When the president leaves office, the Archivist of the United States assumes custody of the records. The Act allowed for the continuation of presidential libraries as the repository for presidential records.

===Presidential Libraries Act of 1986===
The made additional changes to presidential libraries, requiring private endowments linked to the size of the facility. NARA uses these endowments to offset a portion of the maintenance costs for the library.

===Presidential Historical Records Preservation Act of 2008===
The amended to authorize grants for Presidential Centers of Historical Excellence.

===Effects of changes in the records laws and modern digital records===
While the libraries for presidents Hoover to George W. Bush eventually conformed to a model whereby the former president funded or fundraised and built a facility for NARA to house the library, presidents are not required to do so under the law (Nixon&#x27;s was not under NARA for many years). Nonetheless, according to NARA as of 2023, recent changes in these laws have increased significantly the amount of endowment the former president must raise, if they do decide to build a NARA owned facility. According to NARA, not only are the digital nature of modern records changing the needs, plans, and lessening space requirements of physical storage, but the significantly increased endowment requirement may lessen the likelihood that present and future presidents will continue to build NARA facilities.

==Holdings==
The thirteen presidential libraries maintain over 400 million pages of textual materials; nearly ten million photographs; over 15 million feet (5,000 km) of motion picture film; nearly 100,000 hours of disc, audiotape, and videotape recordings; and approximately half a million museum objects. These varied holdings make each library a valuable source of information and a center for research on the Presidency.

The most important textual materials in each library are those created by the president and his staff in the course of performing the official duties. Libraries also house numerous objects including family heirlooms, items collected by the president and his family, campaign memorabilia, awards, and the many gifts given to the president by American citizens and foreign dignitaries. These gifts range in type from homemade items to valuable works of art. Curators in presidential libraries and in other museums throughout the country draw upon these collections for historical exhibits.

Other significant holdings include the personal papers and historical materials donated by individuals associated with the president. These individuals may include Cabinet officials, envoys to foreign governments, political party associates, and the president&#x27;s family and personal friends. Several libraries have undertaken oral history programs that have produced tape-recorded memoirs. A third body of materials comprises the papers accumulated by the president prior to, and following, his presidency. Such collections include documents relating to Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s tenure as Governor of New York and Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s long military career.

With the exception of John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Jimmy Carter, every American president since Hoover is or has chosen to be buried at his presidential library. Kennedy is buried at Arlington National Cemetery; Johnson is buried at his ranch in the hill country of Texas, west of Austin; Carter, who passed away on December 29, 2024, is buried near his home in Plains, Georgia. Bill Clinton will be buried at the William Jefferson Clinton Presidential Center in Little Rock. George W. Bush will be buried at the George W. Bush Presidential Center in Dallas. The future burial sites of 44th president Barack Obama, 45th and 47th president Donald Trump, and 46th president Joe Biden are still unknown.

Unlike all other presidents whose libraries are part of the NARA system, Ford&#x27;s library and museum are geographically separate buildings, located in different parts of Michigan; Ford is buried at his museum in Grand Rapids, while the library is in Ann Arbor.

==List of presidential libraries==
This is a list of the presidential libraries. 

==Locations of other presidents&#x27; papers==
Grover Cleveland and Woodrow Wilson left their papers to Princeton University where they may be found at the Seeley G. Mudd Manuscript Library. The Theodore Roosevelt Association collected Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s papers and donated them to Harvard University in 1943, where they reside at its Widener and Houghton libraries.

James Buchanan left his papers to the Historical Society of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, where they may still be found. &quot;The Papers of Andrew Jackson&quot; is a project sponsored by the University of Tennessee at Knoxville to collect Andrew Jackson&#x27;s papers on microfilm. A microfilm edition of Martin Van Buren&#x27;s papers was produced at Pennsylvania State University in 1987; a digital edition of the Papers of Martin Van Buren is being produced at Cumberland University. A similar project is underway on behalf of James Madison by the Universities of Virginia and Chicago.

For many presidents, especially before the development of the NARA system, substantial collections may be found in multiple private and public collections. Until the Obama Administration&#x27;s library is ready for service, its papers are being held in a facility in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, and except for classified materials are available through FOIA since 2023.

<doc id="494707" wikidata="Q2283372" url="?curid=494707" title="Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma">
<text>Sri Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma III (16 April 1813 – 26 December 1846) was the Maharaja of the Kingdom of Travancore. He was a great musician and composer who has to his credit over 400 classical compositions in both Carnatic and Hindustani style.

A code of laws, courts of justice, introduction of English education, construction of an observatory, installation of the first Government printing press, establishment of the first manuscripts library were amongst the many initiatives taken by Swathi Thirunal, as a King, to modernize Travancore.

== Early life ==
Swathi Thirunal was born into the Venad dynasty of the Matrilineal royal family of Travancore, which is now a part of Kerala, on 16 April 1813. He was the second child of Queen Gowri Lakshmi Bayi who ruled Travancore from 1810 to 1815, and Raja Raja Varma Koil Thampuran of Changanasseri Palace, and the elder son. While in the womb itself, he was proclaimed King and thus was referred to as Garbha Sreemaan. He was born in Svati star, and this is the reason why he was named Swathi Thirunal. He reigned under the regency of his mother from 1813 to 1815 and then under the regency of his maternal aunt Gowri Parvati Bayi until 1829. When he was just four months old, his mother invited Colonel John Munro, representative of the East India Company, and his officials and declared in the Durbar that she was entrusting the East India Company with the care of her child and expected the company to co-operate with him in future.

In 1829 Swathi Thirunal reached majority at 16 and assumed full powers of ruler and reigned as the Maharajah of Travancore until his death in 1846. He had an elder sister, Gowri Rukmini Bayi, whose children ascended the Travancore musnud consecutively. Her only daughter was the mother of Moolam Thirunal. He had a younger brother, Uthram Thirunal Marthanda Varma, who succeeded him in 1846 and ruled Travancore until his demise in 1860.

Irayimman Thampi, the famous poet-composer wrote perhaps the most famous Malayalam lullaby &quot;Omanathinkal Kidavo&quot; (), about Swathi Thirunal when he was born.

== Education ==
Both his aunt/foster mother, who was well-versed in music, and his father, a Sanskrit scholar, took special care about his education. Col. Munro also is said to have taken a keen interest in his education. He started learning Malayalam and Sanskrit at the age of six and English at the age of seven. The young Prince studied several languages, including Malayalam, Kannada, Tamil, Hindustani, Telugu, Marathi, Sanskrit, English and Persian. He impressed all his teachers, and even guests from abroad, with his keen understanding of not only languages but also other subjects like geometry. P. Sankunni Menon (A History of Travancore from the Earliest Times, 1878) records an incident between young Swathi Thirunal and Col. Welsh, a visiting British officer, that the word geometry and words like hexagon, heptagon and so on were derived from Sanskrit. Colonel Welsh summed up the boy King&#x27;s genius as follows:Swati Tirunal, now thirteen... took up a book of mathematics and selecting the forty-seventh proposition of Euclid sketched the figure on a country slate but what astonished me most was his telling us in English that Geometry was derived from the Sanskrit, which as Jaw metor (Jyamiti) to measure the earth and that many of our mathematical terms were also derived from the same source such as hexagon, heptagon, octagon... This promising boy is now, I conclude, sovereign of the finest country in India for he was to succeed to the Musnud (throne) the moment he had attained his 16th year.

== Family ==
In 1829, at the age of sixteen, Maharajah Swathi Thirunal married Thiruvattar Ammachi Panapillai Amma Srimathi Ayikutty Narayani Pillai Thankachi, a famed beauty of the Thiruvattar Ammaveedu family, was an expert Carnatic singer and Veena player. Once there was a minor quarrel between Narayani Pillai Ammachi and her husband, the King. The quarrel continued for some days; the Ammachi approached Irayimman Thampi for a solution. According to researchers he then created the famous Malayalam Padam (song) &quot;Prananaathan Enikku Nalkiya&quot; and told the Ammachi to sing it loudly in the King&#x27;s presence; after hearing it the King was pleased and they reconciled immediately. This particular work of Thampi is considered by experts as one of the most beautiful Shringara (erotic) Padams available in Malayalam. Together they had three children but in 1839 Narayani Pillai Ammachi died, leaving behind a son, Thiruvattar Chithira Nal Ananthapadmanabhan Chempakaraman Thampi. A few months later, for the care of the baby, the Maharajah married another lady called Neelamma Pillai Ammachi by adopting her into the Thiruvattar Ammaveedu. He later married Sundara Lakshmi in 1843, a Saiva Mudaliar dancer, after adopting her into Vadasseri Ammaveedu. The story of the dancer Sugandhavalli who didn&#x27;t get along with the King&#x27;s first wife, Narayani Pillai Thankachi, has been disproved by R.P. Raja as nothing but fiction in his research treatise &#x27;New Light on Swathi Thirunal&#x27;. In 1845 the King constructed the Thanjavur Ammaveedu for his third consort. Sundara Lakshmi, a great devotee of Lord Ganapati and Kanjirottu Yakshi Amma, resided there until her death in 1856.

== As Reigning Maharajah of Travancore ==

Swathi Thirunal took over the reins of Travancore from his aunt, Gowri Parvati Bayi (she was the Regent for Swathi Thirunal in his boyhood) at the age of sixteen. He appointed his tutor, Sri Subba Rao, as the Prime Minister (Diwan). One of his first moves was to shift the government secretariat from Kollam (about seventy-five kilometers away) to Thiruvananthapuram. This enabled him to give personal attention to government affairs. He took steps to curb corruption in the government and told even the Diwan to resign when he heard that the Diwan had acted to favour a particular party in a land dispute. He started an English school in Thiruvananthapuram in 1834, which came to be called the Maharajah&#x27;s Government Free School and later became &quot;Maharajah&#x27;s High School&quot; and then &quot;Maharajah&#x27;s College&quot;. It is now the University College. Later, similar schools were started at many other places. He also implemented reforms in the legal sector, starting &quot;Munsif&quot;, &quot;District&quot; and &quot;Appellate Courts&quot; and modernizing laws. He identified one Kandan Menon from Malabar and appointed him as Huzoor Diwan Peshkar to bring about legal reforms. Another of his achievements was to settle many land disputes by carrying out a resurvey of the land, in which also Menon helped him. He also conducted the first census of the state in 1836. As per the census, the population of Travancore was 128,068.

Swathi Thirunal was also instrumental in bringing modern medicine to the state. He appointed a European as the palace physician. He was also given the responsibility of providing medical assistance to local people, for which hospitals were started. It is this post that was known as Surgeon General till the formation of Kerala State. He also started an engineering department, which was placed under the command of one Lieutenant Horsley. The Karamana bridge was built at that time.

=== Criticism ===

Despite the progress achieved in varied fields under Swathi Thirunal&#x27;s reign, the Kingdom of Travancore, like the rest of British India, was in the grip of extreme caste discrimination against Hindu lower classes (dalits). According to the followers of the movement called &quot;Ayya Vazhi&quot; (the path of Ayya Vaikundar) and historians, a social reformer and iconoclast Ayya Vaikundar severely criticized Swathi Thirunal for the then prevalent caste discrimination against the members of the lower classes in Travancore.

== Astronomy and Trivandrum Observatory ==
Another area where Swathi Thirunal took interest was in astronomy. He wished to compare Western findings with Indian knowledge. He had knowledge of observatories in Madras and others. Finding that there was so much in common between western astronomy and Indian (eastern) astrological understanding of planets, stars and the known universe; Swathi Thirunal set the initiative to start an Astronomical Observatory. One of its directors would be his cousin, Raja Rama Varma Rohani Thirunal, who was the contemporary Raja of Mavelikara Palace, an important branch of the ruling Travancore Royal family related to Raja Swathi Thirunal 
Raja Rohani Thirunal (Rohini) was already an established astronomer from India and a member of the British and Canadian Astronomical Societies. 
The observatory benefited from the expertise of local English men, Colonel Fraser and Mr. Caldecott. A cotton mill expert John Caldecott, FRS was interested in astronomy but was self-taught, and later became one of its directors. As an industrial representative in Alapuzha, he used to make instruments for astronomical observations and initially mounted viewing instruments on top of mango tree in Residency of Kollam, Kochi and his Alappuzha homes. Raja Swathi Tirunal saw his collection and asked him to come to Thiruvananthapuram to start a similar set-up.

The current observatory site was chosen on top of a laterite mount near the Kanakakunnu hill, which was observed as having the best western sky views in Eastern hemisphere, being near the equator and the Arabian sea. He was instrumental in buying telescopes and tools to Thiruvananthapuram (via ship route through the Middle east) from England. It became a part of the erstwhile Travancore University, but for some time was administered as an independent government institution. It is now the oldest institution under the Kerala University. Started in 1837, some of the equipment is still to be seen at the Thiruvananthapuram observatory (now under the Department of Physics, University of Kerala). In the early sixties, in relation to Indian Space Research Organisation, ISRO, the founder Dr. Vikram Sarabhai selected this astronomy observatory to study equatorial night skies. He assigned his doctoral students, notably Dr. A.P.J Kalam and Dr. K. Narayanan Nair, to collect data on cosmic rays and ionosphere.

Trivandrum Public Library (now State Central Library) and the Oriental Manuscript Library were started by Swathi Thirunal, the Museum and Zoo in Thiruvananthapuram as well. The Maharajah was also an honorary member of the Royal Asiatic Society from 1843. Maharajah Swathi Thirunal also put an end to the barbaric punishment called the &#x27;SUCHINDRAM KAIMUKKU&#x27; According to which the accused was forced to prove his innocence by dipping his hand in boiled ghee at Suchindram temple, and he was punished if the hand gets burnt. He is also credited with starting the first government press (the only press at that time was CMS Press in Kottayam).

A report on the English schools in Travancore appeared in &quot;The Gardner&#x27;s Magazine&quot; of 1841, wrote about the administrative reforms brought in by Maharajah Swathi Thirunal:Rajah of Travancore, the great promoter of science in the East, was only twenty-eight years of age, and had not reigned more than ten years, yet, during that short period, he had caused himself to be distinguished by his accomplishments as well as by his&#x27; liberality. They would, no doubt, be interested in learning that this prince was educated by his prime minister— a rare tutor for a sovereign.

The Rajah had established schools within his dominions—he had established a mathematical school under English superintendence; but he had done more—he had done what, he was sorry to say, had neither been done in England, Scotland, nor Ireland—be had established a school in every village of his dominions— and be gave education to every child, male and female – a change in Indian customs that might lead to the happiest results. He was informed, on good authority, that there was not a child who had reached eight years of age not capable of reading and writing; but this distinguished prince, not satisfied with advancing the interests of elementary education, had established an observatory, and placed in it an English gentleman, a member of the Royal Society of London, and who was in that room – he meant Mr. Caldecott. In this observatory, observations were carried on with the same success as under British interests. The Rajah had also established a magnetical and meteorological observatory, having been led to do so by becoming acquainted with a report on Meteorology, published by the British Association. And the observations taken there were found to be as accurate as those taken in Edinburgh, Philadelphia, and other places.

== Contributions to music and literature ==
Swathi Thirunal was deeply interested in music right from childhood. Besides being an able ruler, he was a patron of music and was a musician himself. Researchers say that Swathi Thirunal affixed his compositions with the mudra Padmanabha , sarasijanaabha, etc. and its synonyms. His education in music started with the first lessons from Karamana Subrahmania Bhagavathar and Karamana Padmanabha Bhagavathar. Later, he studied music from the then English scholar, Thanjavur Subba Rao as well. He continued to learn music by listening to accomplished musicians and practising himself. He encouraged both broad systems of Indian music, Hindustani and Carnatic music, though he was essentially a connoisseur of the Carnatic music tradition. He is credited with composing over 400 compositions in Carnatic and Hindustani music. Some of his favourite compositions were &quot;Padmanabha Pahi&quot;, &quot;Deva Deva&quot;, &quot;Devanke&quot;, &quot;Sarasijanabha&quot; and &quot;Sree Ramana Vibho&quot;. Swathi Thirunal was fluent in a number of languages including Malayalam, Sanskrit, Marathi, Telugu, Kannada, Hindustani, Bengali, Tamil, Oriya and English. This was a period when music and art were thriving in many parts of south India. The triumvirate of Carnatic music, Tyagaraja (1767–1847), Syama Sastri (1762–1827) and Muthuswami Dikshitar (1775–1835), lived and enriched music during this period. Swathi Thirunal&#x27;s palace also was home to many musicians and artistes of the period, including the famous Thanjavur Quartet brothers, Tyagaraja&#x27;s disciple Kannayya Bhagavathar, Ananthapadmanabha Goswami (a Maharashtrian singer known as Kokilakanthameru swami), Shadkala Govinda Marar, and many others.

The literary works of Maharajah Swathi Thirunal include Bhakti Manjari&#x27;, Syanandurapuravarnana Prabandham, Padmanabhasatakam, Muhanaprasa Antyaprasa Vyavastha, Ajamila, Kuchela Upakhyanas and Utsava Varnana Prabandha.

== Death ==
As a monarch, Swathi Thirunal was incredibly hardworking and supremely committed to his kingdom and people. The appointment of General Cullen as the Resident of Travancore, was the beginning of the end for the Maharajah.
Historian P. Shungunny Menon wrote: &quot;Resident Jerond Cullen assumed almost sovereign authority. Such was his oppressive intrusion in the administration. The king was made totally powerless. Compounding this atrocity was the machinations of his aide Krishna Rao, who schemed with Cullen for his own personal gain.&quot; What ever the reason, the Resident&#x27;s intrusion in the administration was unbearable for the young King. To compound his problems, the deaths of his elder sister, father, wife Narayani and all three children (Narayani&#x27;s) made the Maharajah distraught. He increasingly sought silence and solitude, weakening his mind and body. Thus, at the age of 33, Maharajah Swathi Thirunal died on 26 December 1846.
The demise of Maharajah Swathi Thirunal attracted the attention of even the foreign press. Allen&#x27;s Indian Mail and Register of Intelligence of British &amp;Foreign India, China, &amp; All Parts of the East wrote:
The Journal the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland ran an obituary in 1847 which mourned that,

=== Swathi Sangeethotsavam ===

Prince Rama Varma, renowned South Indian Classical musician and descendant of Swathi Thirunal, organizes the Swathi Sangeethotsavam, a 10-day music festival featuring exclusively the compositions of Maharaja Swathi Thirunal. Eminent Carnatic and Hindustani musicians participate in this unique musical event, which is conducted every year from 4 to 13 January at Kuthira Malika, Thiruvananthapuram and attracts music aficionados from across the globe.

=== Swathi Sangeetha Puraskaram ===
The award Swathi Sangeetha Puraskaram is instituted in the name of Maharajah Swathi Thirunal of Travancore to honour those musicians who have made valuable contributions to the field of music. It is also the highest honour for musicians by the Government of Kerala, India.

<text>The Breguet XIV (in contemporary practice) or Breguet 14 is a French biplane bomber and reconnaissance aircraft of World War I. It was built in very large numbers and production continued for many years after the end of the war.

The Breguet 14 was among the first mass-produced aircraft to use large amounts of aluminium, rather than wood or steel, in its structure. This allowed the airframe to be both lighter and stronger, making the aircraft fast and agile, and it was able to outrun some contemporary fighters.

==Development==
===Background===
The Breguet 14 was designed by aviation pioneer and aeronautical engineer Louis Breguet. Breguet had already built a reputation for producing capable aircraft and for having innovative ideas, including the use of metal in aircraft construction. The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 led to Breguet-built aircraft being ordered by the military air services of several Triple Entente nations. He temporarily abandoned the preferred tractor configuration for a pusher design to satisfy the French general staff, who sought a clear forward view for the observer. 

In spite of the French official preference for pushers, Breguet remained a proponent of tractor aircraft. In June 1916, he began a new design for a military two-seater, the Breguet AV. The French Army&#x27;s &quot;Section Technique de l&#x27; Aéronautique&quot; (STAé) recommended that Breguet use the Hispano-Suiza 8A V-8 engine of . Breguet determined that the Hispano-Suiza lacked sufficient power, and instead chose the Renault V-12 engine previously used in the Breguet Type V.

Two variants of the Breguet AV (Type XIII and Type XIV to the French authorities) were built. Both had a boxy shape that was complemented by a rectangular frontal radiator and the unusual negative or back stagger of its wings. It possessed a sturdy undercarriage, and had ailerons on the upper wing only. The lower wing had flaps along the entire trailing edges, that were forced into their raised position by the air, as the aircraft accelerated to its normal speed, being restricted from moving freely by a set of 12 adjustable rubber bungee cords.

The airframe&#x27;s structure was constructed primarily of duralumin, an aluminium alloy which had been invented in Germany by Alfred Wilm only a decade previously. Many sections, such as the duralumin longerons and spacers, were attached using welded steel-tube fittings and braced using piano wire. The wing spars were rectangular duralumin tubes with either oak or ash shims at the attachment points, wrapped in a sheet steel sheath. The wooden box ribs had fretted plywood webs and ash flanges. The tail unit was built up from welded steel tube, while the elevators featured large horn balances. French officials were initially wary of the Type XIV&#x27;s innovative materials due to a lack of experience with them.

===Into flight===

Louis Breguet took the prototype into the air for the first time on 21 November 1916. In November 1916, the S.T.Aé. had issued requirements for four new aircraft types, and Breguet submitted the XIV for two of those - reconnaissance and bomber.

The prototype was passed to the S.T.Aé on 11 January 1917 for trials and was accepted to fill both roles. The report issued on 7 February 1917 from the trials stated that the prototype had attained a speed of at an altitude of . On 22 February 1917, Breguet asked the S.T.Aé about initiating production and informed them on 2 March that jigs were ready. On 6 March 1917, the first official production order was received by Breguet, calling for 150 Breguet XIV A.2 reconnaissance aircraft and an additional order for 100 XIV B.2 bombers was received on 4 April.
The A.2 was equipped with several cameras, while some also had radios. The lower wing of the 14 B.2 was fitted with Michelin-built bomb racks for thirty-two bombs. To avoid the bomb racks jamming the flaps, a forward extension of the wings was added, while transparent panels were added to the sides of the fuselage to aid in the use of the bomb sight.

By mid-1917, the French authorities ordered a substantial increase in production. Various other companies were contracted to manufacture the type. On 25 April, French aviation company Darracq was requested to manufacture 330 aircraft. On 8 June, 50 were ordered from Farman and on 18 June, Paul Schmitt was issued a contract to produce 200 aircraft. Some of the contractors were unable to commence quantity production of the Breguet 14 until 1918. Following the war, some aircraft were constructed in French military workshops in Indo-China, although these are likely to have been reliant on imported parts.

As an insurance against engine shortages, alternatives to the standard Renault powerplant were installed, both for experimental purposes and in production quantities. Aside from some used in France, many of the Belgian and American Breguet 14s were powered by the Fiat A.12 engine. An improved model of the standard engine, the Renault 12Ff, appeared in summer 1918 and was used on some late production aircraft. Another engine adopted, lighter but less powerful than the Renault unit, was built by French automotive company Lorraine-Dietrich. A number of late production B.2 models were equipped with the American Liberty engine. To distinguish these aircraft, they were designated Breguet XIV B.2 L.

Other minor variants of the Breguet 14 were flown in small numbers during the Great War; these included the XIV B.1 (&quot;Bombardement&quot;) long-range single-seat bomber, the XIV GR.2 (&quot;Grande Raid&quot;) long-range reconnaissance/bomber, the XIV H (&quot;Hydro&quot;) floatplane, the XIV S (&quot;Sanitaire&quot;) air ambulance and the XIV Et.2 (&quot;Ecole&quot;) trainer. Later variants, such as the XIVbis A.2 and XIVbis B.2, had improved wings. A variant with enlarged wings was produced as the XVI Bn.2 (&quot;Bombardement de nuit&quot;) night bomber. Further derivatives of the aircraft included the XVII C.2 (&quot;Chasse&quot;) two-seat fighter, which was only built in small numbers due to the end of the war. Production of the Breguet 14 continued long after the end of the war, only ending in 1926.

==Operational history==

The Breguet 14 was used in large numbers from May 1917 onwards, and at its peak equipped at least 71 escadrilles, and was deployed on both the Western Front, where it participated in number major actions in which it typically acquitted itself well, and in the east, on the Italian front.

For its actions during the Battle of the Lys, the &quot;Section Artillerie Lourde&quot;, equipped with the type, received a citation and was further lauded for its actions during the Allied counter-attack to the German spring offensive. On 9 July 1918, Capitaine Paul-Louise Weiller shot down two enemy aircraft during one sortie while flying the type.

Following its introduction by the French, during 1918, the Breguet 14 was also ordered by the Belgian Army (40 aircraft) and the United States Army Air Service (over 600 aircraft). Around half the Belgian and U.S. aircraft were fitted with Fiat A.12 engines due to shortages of the original Renault 12F. Prior to the Armistice of 11 November 1918 the Breguet 14 was typically assigned to serve in both reconnaissance and bombing roles. By the end of the conflict, the type was reportedly responsible for having dropped over of bombs.

A Breguet 14 played a role in one of the last acts of the war: during November 1918, one aircraft was used to transport a German military officer, Major von Geyer, from Tergnier and Spa. It was covered in large white flags of truce to avoid being attacked.

The type continued to be widely used after the war, equipping the French occupation forces in Germany and being deployed to support French troops in the colonies. A special version was developed for the harsh conditions encountered overseas, designated &quot;14 TOE&quot; (&quot;Théatres des Operations Extérieures&quot;). These saw service in putting down uprisings in Syria and Morocco, in Vietnam and in the French intervention in the Russian Civil War. The last trainer examples were not withdrawn from French military service until 1932.
Other air arms using the type included Brazil (30), China (70), Czechoslovakia (10), Denmark (4), Finland (38), Greece (approximately 42), Japan (2), the Siamese Air Force (42), Uruguay (9) and Spain (approximately 180). The Polish Air Force used 158 Breguet 14s, about 70 of them being used in combat in the Polish-Soviet war. In Japan, Breguet 14s were licence-built by Nakajima. The type was also heavily used in various internal wars in China during the 1920s and 1930s.

Weeks after the signing of the Armistice, the Breguet 14 was used to conduct several long-distance flights to demonstrate its capabilities. On 26 January 1919, a double crossing of the Mediterranean was flown using the type by Lt Roget and Captaine Coli. On 5 April, Roget flew from Lyon to Rome and then to Nice. Roget and Coli later establish a new French long-distance record flying the Breguet 14, flying from Paris to Kenitra, Morocco, a distance of in 11 hours 15 minutes. Aviation pioneer Pierre-Georges Latécoère converted one example to conduct experimental in-flight refuelling operations.

After the war, Breguet manufactured dedicated civil versions of the Breguet 14. The 14 T.2 Salon carried two passengers in a specially modified fuselage. An improved version, the 14 Tbis, was built as both a land-plane and seaplane. The 14 Tbis also formed the basis of the improved 14 Tbis Sanitaire air ambulance version, and 100 mail planes custom-built for Latécoère&#x27;s airline, Lignes Aeriennes Latécoère. After changing its name to &quot;CGEA&quot;, the airline used, among others, 106 Breguet 14s for flights over the Sahara desert. The 18 T was a single 14 T re-engined with a Renault 12Ja engine, equipped to carry four passengers. When production finally ceased in 1928, the total for all versions built had exceeded 7,800 (according to other sources, 8,000 or even 8,370).

<text>Ragam is South India’s largest Cultural fest hosted by National Institute of Technology, Calicut. Ragam blends a series of fine arts, socio-cultural and literary events, along with a variety of workshops, exhibitions and informal events. The fest attracts thousands of visitors to the campus annually and is one of the most popular cultural fests in India.

==History==
Over two decades have passed since the inception of Ragam. The humble yet controversial beginnings of this festival are well-known due to the infamous Rajan case that rocked Kerala in the seventies. Rajan, a student of the then-CREC was taken into police custody during the Emergency period and allegedly died in custody in 1976. In 1977 the All Kerala Rajan memorial music competition was started to commemorate his life. However, the same got discontinued in a few years. Later in 1987 the fest resurfaced as Ragam, an inter-college cultural fest in remembrance of Rajan. In 2006, Ragam was started with a solemn message ready by Eachara Warrier, father of late Rajan.

The prestigious ever-rolling Ragam trophy of &quot;Nataraj&quot;, the trophy awarded to the overall champions at the fest, is considered as one of the most coveted prizes by the colleges in South India. The 31st edition of the fest was conducted in March 2017.

==Pro Shows==
The Ragam pro-shows have always been noted for the celebrities who have performed at NIT Calicut. The shows are staged in the institute Football Ground, with a capacity of over 8000 spectators. Presently the Ragam &quot;nites&quot; include three cultural nites - ‘the inaugural nite’, ‘the highlight pro-show’, ‘the popular nite’.


For the highlight pro-show, NIT Calicut has previously hosted some of the biggest singers in the country including popular youth icon Sunidhi Chauhan, Sukhwinder Singh, Shaan, Krishnakumar Kunnath (KK), Farhan Akhtar, Sonu Nigam and Ankit Tiwari. Most recently for Ragam&#x27;18, spectators had the opportunity to watch Vishal–Shekhar perform live.
