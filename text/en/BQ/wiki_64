[[Pixel art|Pixel art]] is a form of [[digital art]] drawn with [[graphics software|graphical software]] where images are built using [[pixel]]s as the only building block. It is widely associated with the low-resolution graphics from 8-bit and 16-bit era [[computers and writing|computers]], [[Arcade cabinet|arcade machines]] and [[video game console]]s, in addition to other limited systems such as [[LED display]]s and [[graphing calculator]]s, which have a limited number of pixels and colors available. The art form is still employed to this day by pixel artists and game studios, even though the technological limitations have since been surpassed.

Most works of pixel art are also restrictive both in [[file size]] and the number of colors used in their [[palette (computing)|color palette]] because of [[software]] limitations—to achieve a certain aesthetic or simply to reduce the perceived noise. Older forms of pixel art tend to employ smaller palettes, with some video games being made using just two colors (1-bit [[color depth]]). Because of these self-imposed limitations, pixel art presents strong similarities with many traditional restrictive art forms such as [[mosaic]]s, [[cross-stitch]] and [[fuse beads]].

The precise definition of pixel art is a subject of debate, but an artwork is usually considered as such if deliberate thought was put into each individual pixel of the image. Standard [[digital art]]works or low-resolution photographs are also composed of pixels, but they would only be considered pixel art if the individual pixels were placed with artistic intent, even if the pixels are clearly visible or prominent (&quot;see [[#Definition|Definition]]&quot;).

The phrases &quot;&quot;dot art&quot; and &quot;pixel pushing&quot;&quot; are sometimes used as [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]] for pixel art, particularly by Japanese artists. A much more popular variation is the term [[Pixel art|spriting]], which sometimes refers to the activity of making pixel art elements for video games specifically. The concept most likely originated from the word &quot;[[sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]&quot;, which is used in [[computer graphics]] to describe a two-dimensional [[bitmap]] that can be used as a building block in the construction of larger scenes.

==Overview==

===Definition===
The majority of pixel artists agree that an image can only be categorized as pixel art when the pixels play an important individual role in the [[composition (visual arts)|composition]] of the artwork, which usually requires deliberate control over the placement of each individual pixel. When purposefully editing in this way, changing the position of a few pixels can have a drastic effect on the image. Modern pixel art software incorporates tools that automatically place multiple pixels at once (such as fill tools, line tools, and brush tools), therefore defining pixel art as &quot;art in which an artist has placed each individual pixel&quot; is not accurate anymore. The following is a better way to interpret it: &quot;The process that leads to the final artwork is less relevant than the final result. If the pixels play an important individual role in the final [[composition (visual arts)|composition]], it will be broadly regarded as a pixel art piece by most artists independently of the techniques that may have been implemented to achieve that result.&quot;

A common characteristic in pixel art is the low overall color count in the image. Pixel art as a medium mimics a lot of traits found in older video game graphics, rendered by machines capable of only outputting a limited number of colors at once. Additionally, many pixel artists are of the opinion that in most cases, using a large number of colors, especially when very similar to each other in value, is unnecessary, and detracts from the overall cleanliness of the image, making it look messier. Many experienced pixel artists recommend not using more colors than necessary.

===Differences from digital art===
As images get higher in resolution, pixels get harder to distinguish from each other, and the importance of their careful placement is diminished, to the point that the concept of pixel art falls apart. The exact point at which this occurs and the conditions for a piece to be reasonably called &quot;pixel art&quot; have been the source of great disagreement among professionals and enthusiasts.

In general, the construction of a pixel image can be very similar to that of a digital artwork, particularly during the early sketching phases. The part in which the biggest distinction is made is the final pixel-by-pixel polishing.

===Differences from Oekaki===

 is a form of digital art done at small resolutions that present many similarities with pixel art. However, in Oekaki, the placement of individual pixels is not considered as important compared to the general feel of the artwork, giving it a characteristic &quot;messy&quot; or jagged look.

===Automation and algorithms===
There are plenty of algorithms that have been used to facilitate the creation or editing of pixel art, such as using 3D shaders within software like [[Blender (software)|Blender]] to generate complex effects or rotating objects, that are later imported into [[#Software|pixel art software]].

There also exist many [[interpolation (computer graphics)|interpolation]] algorithms calibrated specifically for pixel art.

==History==
===Origin===
Some traditional art forms, like [[counted-thread embroidery]] (including [[cross-stitch]]) and some kinds of [[mosaic]] and [[beadwork]], are very similar to pixel art and could be considered as non-digital counterparts or predecessors. These art forms construct pictures out of small colored units similar to the pixels of modern digital computing.

Some of the earliest examples of pixel art could be found in analog electronic advertising displays, such as the ones from New York City during the early 20th century, with simple monochromatic light bulb matrix displays extant circa 1937. Pixel art as it is known today largely originates from the [[golden age of arcade video games]], with games such as &quot;[[Space Invaders]]&quot; (1978) and &quot;[[Pac-Man]]&quot; (1980), and [[third generation of video game consoles|8-bit consoles]] such as the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (1983) and [[Master System]] (1985).

The term &quot;pixel art&quot; was first published in a journal letter by [[Adele Goldberg (computer scientist)|Adele Goldberg]] and [[Robert Flegal]] of Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in 1982. The practice, however, goes back at least 11 years before that, for example in Richard Shoup&#x27;s [[SuperPaint]] system in 1972, also at Xerox PARC.

===1970s===
Because of the severe restrictions of early graphics, the first instances of pixel art in video games were relatively abstract. The low resolution of computers and game consoles forced game designers to carefully design game assets by deliberate placement of individual pixels, to form recognizable symbols, characters, or items. Simple function-based avatars (or player-surrogates) such as spaceships, cars, or tanks required a minimum of animation and computing power, while enemies, terrain, and power-ups were often represented by symbols or simple designs. Due to the limited hardware of the 1970s, abstraction, as in the case of [[Pong]]&#x27;s relatively simple design, sometimes led to better game readability and commercial success than attempting more detailed representational art.

Although computers had been used to create art since the 1960s and microcomputers were used in the late 1970s and there are examples of digital art utilizing a more pixelated aesthetic, There is no well-known tradition of pixel art from the 1970s that differentiated between the deliberate placement of pixels or the aestheticization of individual pixels in contrast to other forms of digital painting or digital art. For this reason, one could argue that pixel art was not a recognized medium or artform in the 1970s.

===1980s===

In what is sometimes referred to as the golden age of video games or [[golden age of arcade video games]], the 1980s saw a period of innovation in video games, both as a new artform and a form of entertainment. During the early 1980s, video game creators were mainly programmers and not graphic designers. Technological innovation led to market pressure for more representational and &quot;realistic&quot; graphics in games. As graphics improved, it became possible to replace hand-drawn game assets with imported pictures or 3D polygons, which contributed to pixel art developing as a separate art form.

Gradually, professional artists and graphic designers had a bigger impact in the video game industry. [[Sierra Entertainment]] released [[Mystery House]], pixelled by [[Roberta Williams]], and the &quot;[[King&#x27;s Quest]]&quot; series; and [[Lucasfilm Games]] released games such as &quot;[[Maniac Mansion]]&quot;, &quot;[[Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure]]&quot;. Mark J. Ferrari, an artist at Lucasfilm Games, later said:When I was first hired by Lucasfilm Games in 1987 to do artwork for their computer games, pixel graphics was not thought of by anyone as an &#x27;art form&#x27;. The use of pixels was not an aesthetic choice – as it certainly is now. If anything, pixels were an unavoidable and very irksome obstacle to the creation of any &#x27;real art&#x27; for use in the exciting but bewildering new realm of computer entertainment. There were no pixel artists then – at all! There were only traditional artists.
Nevertheless, the aesthetic of 1980s video games had a major impact on contemporary and future pixel art, both in video games, the [[demoscene]] graphics and among independent artists. As computers became more affordable in the 1980s, software such as DEGAS Elite (1986) for the Atari ST, [[Deluxe Paint]] (1985) and Deluxe Paint 2 (1986) for the [[Amiga|Commodore Amiga]], and Paint Magic for the [[Commodore 64]], inspired many later pixel artists to create digital art by careful placement of pixels. In the case of the Commodore 64 and the [[Amstrad CPC]], some early pixel artists used joysticks and keyboards to pixel.

With the rise of the [[demoscene]] movement in Europe in the late 1980s, artists who were proficient with creating pixel art using [[8-bit computing|8-bit computers]] like the Commodore 64 and [[ZX Spectrum]] or [[16-bit computing|16-bit computers]] like the [[Atari ST]] began to publish their pixel art as demos. [[Demogroup]]s would often include coders (programmers), musicians, and graphicians, where graphicians were a common name for graphic designers and/or pixel artists. Although some graphicians worked on adding art to cracked video games ([[crack intro|cracktros]]), the demoscene contributed to artistic communities creating pixel art for its own sake as art. These were often shared via floppy disks that were handed from person to person or via the postal service. The golden age of the demoscene and its associated pixel art milieu, however, is often regarded as beginning in the early 1990s.

===1990s===

Before the 1990s, display systems were mostly based on a small [[8-bit color|4-bit palette]] of imposed colors (16 fixed shades innate to each system, often incompatible with one another). The coming decade greatly improved the graphics standard with the appearance of increased [[color depth]] and [[indexed color|indexed color palettes]] (For example, 512 colors for the [[Atari ST]] and the [[Mega Drive]], 4,096 for the [[Amiga Enhanced Chip Set|Amiga ECS]], 32,768 for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Nintendo]], and 16,777,216 for the [[Amiga AGA]] and the [[VGA]] mode of the PCs). During the 1990s, 2D games with manually painted graphics saw increasing competition from 3-dimensional games and games using pre-rendered 3D assets. Still, pixel art games like [[Flashback (1992 video game)|&quot;Flashback&quot;]], &quot;[[The Secret of Monkey Island]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Chaos Engine]]&quot;, &quot;[[Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike]]&quot;, and &quot;[[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past]]&quot; had a major influence on future artists in the game industry, the contemporary demoscene and the aesthetic of pixel art in later decades.

In addition to pixel art influenced by video games, pixel artists (or graphicians) in the demoscene continued to make pixel art for demos and cracktros. Some demoscene pixel artists active in the 1990s have cited movies and urban graffiti as important influences for their art, particularly in designing logos. In addition to copying sprites from existing video games, demoscene pixel artists also copied the work of popular artists and illustrators such as [[Ian Miller (illustrator)|Ian Miller]] and [[Simon Bisley]]. Competition gradually became an increasingly important part of demoscene gatherings, including pixel art (graphics) competitions, and as teenagers and young adults were the major demographic in these gatherings, a lot of demoscene pixel art referenced familiar fantasy, science fiction and cyberpunk tropes. Demoscene competitions had a major effect in shaping the direction of pixel art. Prominent artists would look for ways to innovate, display superior technique, overcome technical restrictions, and in many cases aim for photorealism through [[anti-aliasing]].

As [[the Internet|the internet]] became more available in the 1990s, pixel artists and demosceners gradually began to spread their pixel art via websites, instant messaging, and online file sharing. While the demoscene was arguably most popular among young men, an online movement began in the late 1990s known as pixel dolls or &#x27;dollz&#x27;, which was popular among young women. The increased popularity of [[online chat]]ting and [[personal web page|personal webpages]] at a time before digital cameras were common led to an increased demand for personal representation through personalized [[avatar (computing)|avatars]]. These avatars often took the form of pixel dolls, being pixel art characters that could be outfitted with different clothing and accessories. As pixel dolls grew more and more common, many pixel artists gradually began to develop this as an independent artform.

===2000s===

The 2000s were a pivotal decade for pixel art establishing itself as an artform practiced around the world, separate from other forms of digital art. In particular, the Pixelation forum and Pixel Joint gallery are credited as the most influential English-speaking online communities, connecting pixel artists all over the world in a way that the mostly Western European demoscene movement had not. Pixelation was a web forum where artists could share pixel art to give and receive feedback. Its main focus was critiquing, developing skills and understanding of pixel art, more so than simply sharing art for the sake of admiration, entertainment, or competition. Pixel Joint is an online gallery where members can submit personal work and comment on other members&#x27; pixel art. It has features such as weekly challenges, a forum, a hall of fame, and a monthly top 10-pixel art competition based on member voting.

Over time, the overlapping but separate communities of Pixelation and Pixel Joint were engaged in online discourse about the nature of pixel art, inspiring widely shared tutorials and arguably contributing to a new paradigm that was different from the pixel art of the 1990s. A major concern was to establish pixel art as its own medium and/or art form, separate from other types of digital art, such as Oekaki. In particular, highly restricted palettes (e.g. a maximum of 8 or 16 colors) were argued by some to be a defining feature of pixel art. One example is the so-called &quot;8 color gentlemen&#x27;s club&quot;, consisting of pixel artists who celebrated pixel art with 8 colors. The use of transparent layers and smudging tools was also considered non-pixel art and unacceptable for the Pixel Joint gallery. Whereas the demoscene had, to a large degree, revolved around physical gatherings and groups of artists, musicians, and programmers collaborating, pixel art communities on Pixel Joint and Pixelation were based mostly on online interaction among individual artists. On Pixel Joint, pixel art made through collaboration between artists was not accepted in the gallery but considered a separate pursuit. The relatively strict ideas of what constituted acceptable pixel art, enforced by moderators on Pixel Joint, led to repeated conflict but also contributed to pixel art standing out as a separate medium at a time when many types of digital paintings were shared on the internet, on websites like DeviantArt. In particular, several prominent artists mention Cure&#x27;s tutorials as significant for learning about pixel art as a separate art medium or art form.

After the golden age of demoscene pixel art in the 1990s, many notable pixel artists of that milieu took a break from pixel art in the 2000s - although some made an early transition to join Pixelation and Pixel Joint, such as Gas 13 and Tomic. While activity did decline, the demoscene continued to explore pixel art on platforms from the late 1980s and early 1990s, particularly using the Commodore 64 and Atari computers.

Pixel doll communities grew rapidly during the 2000s, in large part due to the continued growth of forums, message boards, and chat services. With websites like the Doll Palace, Eden Enchanted, DeviantArt, and many personal websites, pixel dolls were increasingly recognized as a new art form, with public feedback, competition, tutorials, best practices, and rules of conduct. The 2000s were arguably the height of pixel doll popularity, in part because of various online communities that made use of pixel dolls for avatars and the popularity of internet forums in an age before social media. Despite this, there was relatively little interaction between the pixel doll communities and other pixel art communities such as Pixel Joint, Pixelation, or the demoscene.

In video games for computers and consoles during the 2000s, pixel art was largely abandoned in favor of more modern graphics, particularly based on 3D. Many professional game artists who had been working with pixel art either left the industry or switched to other forms of digital art. This arguably contributed to pixel art establishing itself as an independent art form, practiced mostly by independent artists rather than game industry employees. There are a few notable exceptions, such as &quot;[[Habbo|Habbo Hotel]]&quot;, which inspired a great amount of isometric pixel art, and &quot;[[Advance Wars]]&quot;, for [[Game Boy Advance]].

===2010s===

The popularity of pixel art accelerated during the 2010s. One major contribution to this trend was the success of several &#x27;retro&#x27; pixel art games such as &quot;&quot; (2011), &quot;[[Terraria]]&quot; (2011), [[Fez (video game)|&quot;Fez&quot;]] (2012), &quot;[[Papers, Please]]&quot; (2013), &quot;[[Shovel Knight]]&quot; (2014), &quot;[[Undertale]]&quot; (2015), &quot;[[Owlboy]]&quot; (2016), &quot;[[Stardew Valley]]&quot; (2016), &quot;[[Deltarune]]&quot; (2018), [[Celeste (video game)|&quot;Celeste&quot;]] (2018), and &quot;[[Octopath Traveler]]&quot; (2018). Many of these games combined low-resolution game assets with non-pixel art (NPA) elements such as filters, high definition UI, or special effects. The increased attention on pixel art in media and the game industry coincided with the rapid growth of pixel art communities. Owlboy&#x27;s art director, Simon Andersen, explained that he wanted to show the advantages of the pixel as an art medium, pushing the potential of the artistic technique and showcase pixel art done properly, without millions of colors or 3D captures. In contrast, the heavily stylized and abstract &quot;Superbrothers: Sword &amp; Sworcery EP&quot; made extensive use of filters and non-pixel art graphics. Superbrothers: &quot;Sword and Sworcery&quot; also allowed players to share various in-game achievements on [[Twitter]], the #sworcery hashtag went viral, contributing to the renewed interest in pixel art in video games.

Pixel Joint and Pixelation remained important communities with a growing number of contributors, but the 2010s saw the rise of new communities on [[Reddit]], [[DeviantArt]], [[Instagram]], and Twitter. While Pixelation, in particular, had a core of very dedicated, often professional, pixel artists and Pixel Joint had moderators who accepted or rejected submissions to its online gallery, new pixel art communities in social media were naturally less cohesive, yet more open. Not only did social media contribute significantly to the continued growth of pixel art, and more traffic to older pixel art websites, but websites like [[Tumblr]], Twitter, and Instagram also gave significant global attention to new pixel artists outside of the traditional pixel art communities, such as Waneella and Pixel Jeff.
During the 2010s, the demoscene arguably entered a [[silver age]], as several older artists returned to their hobbies after a hiatus. In addition, the increasing popularity of pixel art in this decade also attracted new artists to the demoscene, who had not been active during the 1990s and 2000s. It is important to note that the demoscene and its graphics competitions never stopped, but the 2010s could nevertheless be considered a period of rejuvenation.

As advanced digital painting software like [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]] became more widely available and easier to use, the pixel doll community split into a group of artists using traditional pixel art, known as pixel-shaders, and a group of artists using more advanced tools, known as tool-shaders. As internet forums lost popularity and drawn avatars were increasingly replaced by photos in internet communities, the pixel dolling community gradually became less active in this decade.
Perhaps because of the rise of pixel art in video games and social media, pixel art was also seen in other areas of [[popular culture]] and even made its way to public museums. Ivan Dixon and Paul Robertson received international attention for making a pixel art version of &quot;[[The Simpsons]]&quot;&#x27; introduction sequence. Eboy became well known for their isometric pixel art displays, often used for advertisement or sold as independent art. The work of pixel artists such as Octavi Navarro and Gustavo Viselner was featured in major newspapers and magazines. French urban artist [[Invader (artist)|Invader]] received international attention for his urban pixel art mosaics, seen around the world. Among 1980s-inspired [[synthwave]] artists and groups, pixel art was used to make music videos, such as Valenberg&#x27;s work for [[Perturbator]] and a [[Gunship (band)|Gunship]] music video by pixel artists Jason Tammemagi, Gyhyom, Mary Safro, and Waneella. In 2012, the [[Smithsonian Institution]] museum of Washington created an exhibition called [[The Art of Video Games]], attended by almost 700,000 people.

===2020s===

Although some commenters had predicted the decline of &quot;retro&quot; pixel art after a wave of pixel art games in the 2010s, pixel art has continued to remain popular in the current decade. One major contributing factor seems to have been the COVID-19 pandemic, as people around the world spent more time online, playing games, using social media and developing new hobbies. A second contributing factor seems to have been the rise of [[non-fungible token|NFTs]], as pixel art became an inexpensive way to produce large numbers of artworks. As the market for NFTs grew rapidly, many pixel artists embraced the new technology as a new source of income. Many notable professional artists also expressed skepticism and disapproval of NFTs, citing environmental factors, pyramid scheme claims, and money laundering as reasons for rejecting offers. One of the most profiled examples of pixel artists expressing opposition to NFTs is Castpixel, citing environmental effects and artificial scarcity. Furthermore, as is the case with other forms of digital art, pixel artists have also discovered many cases of plagiarism and fraud by actors who download pixel art without permission to sell as NFTs. Although the discussion around pixel art theft is not new, the issue has certainly become more controversial with the rise of NFTs.

Perhaps linked to the increased influence and attraction of social media platforms like Twitter, [[Mastodon (software)|Mastodon]], Reddit, and Instagram, older pixel art communities on Pixelation and DeviantArt declined in the 2020s. Discord became an important platform for pixel art communities like Pixel Joint, PAD (Pixel Art Discord), Lospec, and Trigonomicon. In the early fall of 2022, Pixelation announced the closing of its webforum and a transition to Twitter.

Pixel art continued to be a popular style in games across platforms, with releases such as &quot;[[Antonball Deluxe]]&quot; (2021), [[Eastward (video game)|&quot;Eastward&quot;]] (2021), &quot;[[Loop Hero]]&quot; (2021), &quot;[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder&#x27;s Revenge]]&quot; (2022), &quot;[[Songs of Conquest]]&quot; (2022), &quot;[[Pizza Tower]]&quot; (2023), and &quot;[[Antonblast]]&quot; (2024). Some argued that the recent wave of pixel art games, released thirty years after the release of the SNES, was largely influenced by nostalgia and freedom from publishers, responding to unoriginal stories in modern video game blockbusters and wanting to integrate contemporary themes, such as ecological concerns and representation of queer characters.

==Techniques==
Pixel art typically involves more careful and deliberate placement of pixels compared to other forms of digital art. Artists use different brush sizes (e.g. 1x1 or 2x2 pixels) and a variety of tools, such as free-hand/pencil, lines, and rectangles. One key difference between pixel art and other digital art is that pixel artists tend to apply a single color at a time, avoiding tools such as soft edges, smudging, and blurring. Agreeing on which tools and techniques are considered non-pixel art (NPA) is something that has caused considerable disagreement in the past. For example, applying layers with different filters that adjust hue or light values is considered a non-pixel art technique, but the resulting art may still be considered pixel art if there&#x27;s a clear foundation of deliberate placement of pixels. To preserve the careful pixel placement, pixel art is preferably stored in a file format utilizing lossless data compression. The JPEG format, for example, is often avoided because of its compression, as it introduces visible artifacts in the image.

Different restrictions are central to pixel art, and these are often traced back to technical limitations of hardware such as Amiga, Commodore 64, NES, and early computers. The two most common restrictions are resolution and palette, and pixel artists often work with a significantly reduced canvas size and number of colors compared to other digital artists. (Lee, p. 276) Examples include Commodore 64 restrictions (320x200 resolution, 16 colors), original ZX Spectrum restrictions (256x192 pixels, 15 colors), and [[Game Boy|GameBoy]] restrictions (160x144 pixels, 4 colors).

Some artists start the process of pixelling by drawing line art, while others begin by blocking in simple shapes and big clusters. Traditionally, pixel art was done on a single layer, similar to painting on a canvas, but modern software permits work with multiple layers, potentially adding animation or transparency to the foreground while keeping a static background.

To deal with the various restrictions of pixel art, such as reduced resolution or colors, pixel artists have traditionally employed several techniques specific to the art form. One widely used technique is [[Dither|dithering]], commonly using noise or a repeating pattern such as a checkerboard or lines to create a third color when seen from a distance. Other common techniques include anti-aliasing (AA) where strong edges are softened by manually placing pixels, and sub-pixelling, changing the colors of pixels to create an illusion of movement.

===Styles===
Because pixel art is a flexible medium, pixel artists can often imitate styles from traditional media, such as impressionism or pointillism in oil painting or cross-hatching in embroidery. Pixel art is not a style itself, but a broad artistic medium. However, there are different styles within pixel art that revolve around pixel placement. One common distinction in style is the use of clusters. A cluster is a field of connected pixels with the same color. The opposite of a cluster is an isolated pixel (1x1) surrounded by pixels of other colors. Cluster size has become an important marker of pixel art styles, where some pixel art uses large clusters and avoids isolated (orphan) pixels, whereas other works use clusters of all sizes in combination with isolated pixels, or even rely primarily on isolated pixels and small clusters for a more grainy, noisy texture. Styles that rely more on small clusters and isolated pixels often have similarities with pointillism and impressionism, whereas pixel art with larger clusters and geometric shapes has similarities with cubism and [[suprematism]]. Although some artists have been known for championing a particular style, many pixel artists alternate between different styles in their works.
===Genres and subjects===
Pixel art is a flexible medium and shares traditions of figure drawing, landscapes, and abstract with traditional media. However, certain genres have emerged as particularly popular. These genres often overlap, but include:

* &quot;[[Isometric video game graphics|Isometric]]&quot;: Pixel art drawn in a near-isometric dimetric projection. Originally used in games to provide a three-dimensional view without using any real three-dimensional processing. Normally drawn with a 1:2 pixel ratio along the X and Y-axis.
* &quot;[[Sprite (computer graphics)|Sprites]]&quot;: Characters and game assets typically drawn in the fashion of platformer games and fighting games such as Streets of Rage or Street Fighter II or JRPGs (Japanese Roleplaying Game) such as Final Fantasy.
* &quot;Pixel dolls&quot;: Also known as dollz. Sets of pixel art characters, usually with customizable appearance and sets of clothing. Often used as avatars for chatting and forums, or in dress-up games.
* &quot;Mock-ups&quot;: Concepts for non-existing pixel art games, including a user interface and other game elements. Retro-style mock-ups based on modern games are called &#x27;demakes&#x27;.

==Software==
Essentially all [[raster graphics editor]]s can be used in some way for pixel art, some of which include features designed to make the process easier. See [[Comparison of raster graphics editors]] for a list of notable raster graphics editors. The following notable programs were designed specifically to facilitate drawing pixel art.

<text>Flow cytometry (FC) is a technique used to detect and measure the physical and chemical characteristics of a population of cells or particles.

In this process, a sample containing cells or particles is suspended in a fluid and injected into the flow cytometer instrument. The sample is focused to ideally flow one cell at a time through a laser beam, where the light scattered is characteristic to the cells and their components. Cells are often labeled with fluorescent markers so light is absorbed and then emitted in a band of wavelengths. Tens of thousands of cells can be quickly examined and the data gathered are processed by a computer.

Flow cytometry is routinely used in basic research, clinical practice, and clinical trials. Uses for flow cytometry include:
* Cell counting
* Cell sorting
* Determining cell characteristics and function
* Detecting microorganisms
* Biomarker detection
* Protein engineering detection
* Diagnosis of health disorders such as blood cancers
* Measuring genome size

A flow cytometry analyzer is an instrument that provides quantifiable data from a sample. Other instruments using flow cytometry include cell sorters which physically separate and thereby purify cells of interest based on their optical properties.

== History ==
The first impedance-based flow cytometry device, using the Coulter principle, was disclosed in U.S. Patent 2,656,508, issued in 1953, to Wallace H. Coulter. Mack Fulwyler was the inventor of the forerunner to today&#x27;s flow cytometers – particularly the cell sorter. Fulwyler developed this in 1965 with his publication in &quot;Science&quot;. The first fluorescence-based flow cytometry device (ICP 11) was developed in 1968 by Wolfgang Göhde from the University of Münster, filed for patent on 18 December 1968 and first commercialized in 1968/69 by German developer and manufacturer Partec through Phywe AG in Göttingen. At that time, absorption methods were still widely favored by other scientists over fluorescence methods. Soon after, flow cytometry instruments were developed, including the Cytofluorograph (1971) from Bio/Physics Systems Inc. (later: Ortho Diagnostics), the PAS 8000 (1973) from Partec, the first FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorting) instrument from Becton Dickinson (1974), the ICP 22 (1975) from Partec/Phywe and the Epics from Coulter (1977/78). The first label-free high-frequency impedance flow cytometer based on a patented microfluidic &quot;lab-on-chip&quot;, Ampha Z30, was introduced by Amphasys (2012).

===Name of the technology===
The original name of the fluorescence-based flow cytometry technology was &quot;pulse cytophotometry&quot; (German: &quot;Impulszytophotometrie&quot;), based on the first patent application on fluorescence-based flow cytometry. At the 5th American Engineering Foundation Conference on Automated Cytology in Pensacola (Florida) in 1976 – eight years after the introduction of the first fluorescence-based flow cytometer (1968) – it was agreed to commonly use the name &quot;flow cytometry&quot;, a term that quickly became popular.

==Flow cytometers==
Modern flow cytometers are able to analyze many thousands of particles per second, in &quot;real time&quot; and, if configured as cell sorters, can actively separate and isolate particles with specified optical properties at similar rates. A flow cytometer is similar to a microscope, except that, instead of producing an image of the cell, flow cytometry offers high-throughput, automated quantification of specified optical parameters on a cell-by-cell basis. To analyze solid tissues, a single-cell suspension must first be prepared.

A flow cytometer has five main components: a flow cell, a measuring system, a detector, an amplification system, and a computer for analysis of the signals. The flow cell has a liquid stream (sheath fluid), which carries and aligns the cells so that they pass single file through the light beam for sensing. The measuring system commonly uses measurement of impedance (or conductivity) and optical systems – lamps (mercury, xenon); high-power water-cooled lasers (argon, krypton, dye laser); low-power air-cooled lasers (argon (488 nm), red-HeNe (633 nm), green-HeNe, HeCd (UV)); diode lasers (blue, green, red, violet) resulting in light signals. The detector and analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) system converts analog measurements of forward-scattered light (FSC) and side-scattered light (SSC) as well as dye-specific fluorescence signals into digital signals that can be processed by a computer. The amplification system can be linear or logarithmic.

The process of collecting data from samples using the flow cytometer is termed &quot;acquisition&quot;. Acquisition is mediated by a computer physically connected to the flow cytometer, and the software which handles the digital interface with the cytometer. The software is capable of adjusting parameters (e.g., voltage, compensation) for the sample being tested, and also assists in displaying initial sample information while acquiring sample data to ensure that parameters are set correctly. Early flow cytometers were, in general, experimental devices, but technological advances have enabled widespread applications for use in a variety of both clinical and research purposes. Due to these developments, a considerable market for instrumentation, analysis software, as well as the reagents used in acquisition such as fluorescently labeled antibodies have been developed.

Modern instruments usually have multiple lasers and fluorescence detectors. The current record for a commercial instrument is ten lasers and 30 fluorescence detectors. Increasing the number of lasers and detectors allows for multiple antibody labeling, and can more precisely identify a target population by their phenotypic markers. Certain instruments can even take digital images of individual cells, allowing for the analysis of fluorescent signal location within or on the surface of cells.

== Hardware ==

=== Fluidics system of a flow cytometer ===
Cells must pass uniformly through the center of focused laser beams to accurately measure optical properties of cells in any flow cytometer. The purpose of the fluidic system is to move the cells one by one through the lasers beam and throughout the instrument. Fluidics in a flow cytometer with cell sorting capabilities also use the stream to carry sorted cells into collection tubes or wells.

==== Hydrodynamic focusing ====

For precise positioning of cells in a liquid jet, hydrodynamic focusing is used in most cytometers. The cells in suspension enter into the instrument enclosed by an outer sheath fluid. The sample core is maintained in the center of the sheath fluid. The sample input rate or how fast the cells flow through to the laser interrogation can be controlled by the pressure of the sheath fluid on the sample core. Under optimal conditions, the central fluid stream and sheath fluid do not mix.

==== Acoustic-assisted hydrodynamic focusing ====
Acoustic focusing technology is used in some flow cytometers to support hydrodynamic focusing. Acoustic waves (&gt;2 MHz) pre-focus the sample before introduction to sheath fluid. The pre-focused sample is then injected into the hydrodynamic core and flowed through the instrument. This may help with increasing data accuracy under high sample input rates.

=== Optics and electronics ===

==== Optical filters ====
Light emitted from fluorophores are in a spectrum of wavelengths, so combining multiple fluorophores may cause overlap. To add specificity, optical filters and dichroic mirrors are used to filter and move light to the detectors such as photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) or avalanche photodiodes (APD). Optical filters are designed as band pass (BP), long pass (LP), or short pass (SP) filters. Most flow cytometers uses dichroic mirrors and band pass filters to select specific bands of the optical spectrum.

==== Prisms, gratings, and spectral flow cytometry ====
Spectral flow cytometry uses prisms or diffraction gratings to disperse the emitted light of a marker across a detector array. This allows for the full spectra from each particle to be measured. The measured spectra from single cells are subsequently unmixed by using reference spectra of all used dyes and the autofluorescence spectrum. This may allow for a wider panel design and the application of new biological markers.

==== Imaging flow cytometry ====
Imaging flow cytometry (IFC) captures multichannel images of cells. Detectors used in imaging platforms can be equipped with charge-coupled device (CCD) or complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) to capture images of individual cells.

==Data analysis==
=== Compensation ===

Each fluorochrome has a broad fluorescence spectrum. When more than one fluorochrome is used, an overlap between fluorochromes can occur. This situation is called spectrum overlap, and must be corrected. For example, the emission spectrum for FITC and PE is one in which the light emitted by the fluorescein overlaps the same wavelength as it passes through the filter used for PE. This spectral overlap is corrected by removing a portion of the FITC signal from the PE signals or vice versa. This process is called color compensation, which calculates a fluorochrome as a percentage to measure itself.

Compensation is the mathematical process by which spectral overlap of multiparameter flow cytometric data is corrected. Since fluorochromes can have wide-ranging spectrum, they can overlap, causing the undesirable result of confusion during the analysis of data. This overlap, known as spillover and quantified in the spillover coefficient, is usually caused by detectors for a certain fluorochrome measuring a significant peak in wavelength from a different fluorochrome. Linear algebra is most often used to make this correction.

In general, when graphs of one or more parameters are displayed, it is to show that the other parameters do not contribute to the distribution shown. Especially when using the parameters which are more than double, this problem is more severe. Currently, no tools have been discovered to efficiently display multidimensional parameters. Compensation is very important to see the distinction between cells.
===Gating===

The data generated by flow cytometers can be plotted in a single dimension to produce a histogram, or in two-dimensional dot plots, or even in three dimensions. The regions on these plots can be sequentially separated, based on fluorescence intensity, by creating a series of subset extractions, termed &quot;gates.&quot; Specific gating protocols exist for diagnostic and clinical purposes, especially in relation to hematology. Individual single cells are often distinguished from cell doublets or higher aggregates by their &quot;time-of-flight&quot; (denoted also as a &quot;pulse-width&quot;) through the narrowly focused laser beam

The plots are often made on logarithmic scales. Because different fluorescent dyes&#x27; emission spectra overlap, signals at the detectors have to be compensated electronically as well as computationally. Data accumulated using the flow cytometer can be analyzed using software. Once the data is collected, there is no need to stay connected to the flow cytometer and analysis is most often performed on a separate computer. This is especially necessary in core facilities where usage of these machines is in high demand.

===Computational analysis===

Recent progress on automated population identification using computational methods has offered an alternative to traditional gating strategies. Automated identification systems could potentially help findings of rare and hidden populations. Representative automated methods include FLOCK in Immunology Database and Analysis Portal (ImmPort), SamSPECTRAL and flowClust in Bioconductor, and FLAME in GenePattern. T-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE) is an algorithm designed to perform dimensionality reduction, to allow visualization of complex multi-dimensional data in a two-dimensional &quot;map&quot;. Collaborative efforts have resulted in an open project called FlowCAP (Flow Cytometry: Critical Assessment of Population Identification Methods,) to provide an objective way to compare and evaluate the flow cytometry data clustering methods, and also to establish guidance about appropriate use and application of these methods.

=== FMO controls ===
Fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls are important for data interpretation when building multi-color panels – in which a cell is stained with multiple fluorochromes simultaneously. FMO controls provide a measure of fluorescence spillover in a given channel and allow for compensation. To generate a FMO control, a sample is stained with all the fluorochromes except the one that is being tested – meaning if you are using 4 different fluorochromes your FMO control must contain only 3 of them (example: fluorochromes – A, B, C, D; FMOs – ABC_, AB_D, A_CD, _BCD).

== Cell sorting by flow cytometry ==
Cell sorting is a method to purify cell populations based on the presence or absence of specific physical characteristics. In flow cytometers with sorting capabilities, the instrument detects cells using parameters including cell size, morphology, and protein expression, and then droplet technology to sort cells and recover the subsets for post-experimental use.

The first prototype sorter was built at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in 1965 by physicist Mack J. Fulwyler by joining a Coulter volume sensor with the newly invented ink jet printer. Live cell cell sorter or fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) was generated by Len Herzenberg, who subsequently won the Kyoto Prize in 2006 for his seminal work.

Flow cytometry cell sorters have a collection system unlike flow cytometry analyzers. The collection process starts when a sample is injected into a stream of sheath fluid that passes through the flow cell and laser intercepts. The stream then carries the cell through a vibrating nozzle which generates droplets with most containing either one cell or no cells. An electrical charging ring is placed just at the point where the stream breaks into droplets and a charge is placed on the ring based immediately prior to fluorescence intensity being measured; the opposite charge is trapped on the droplet as it breaks from the stream and the droplets are therefore charged. The charged droplets then fall through an electrostatic deflection system that diverts droplets into containers based on their charge. In some systems, the charge is applied directly to the stream, and the droplet breaking off retains charge of the same sign as the stream. The stream is then returned to neutral after the droplet breaks off. After collecting, these cells can be further cultured, manipulated, and studied.

== Labels ==
Flow cytometry uses the light properties scattered from cells or particles for identification or quantitative measurement of physical properties. Labels, dyes, and stains can be used for multi-parametric analysis (understand more properties about a cell). Immunophenotyping is the analysis of heterogeneous populations of cells using labeled antibodies and other fluorophore containing reagents such as dyes and stains.

=== Fluorescent labels ===

A wide range of fluorophores can be used as labels in flow cytometry. Fluorophores, or simply &quot;fluors&quot;, are typically attached to an antibody that recognizes a target feature on or in the cell; they may also be attached to a chemical entity with affinity for the cell membrane or another cellular structure. Each fluorophore has a characteristic peak excitation and emission wavelength, and the emission spectra often overlap. Consequently, the combination of labels which can be used depends on the wavelength of the lamp(s) or laser(s) used to excite the fluorochromes and on the detectors available. Flow cytometry uses fluorescence as a quantitative tool; the utmost sensitivity of flow cytometry is unmatched by other fluorescent detection platforms such as confocal microscopy. Absolute fluorescence sensitivity is generally lower in confocal microscopy because out-of-focus signals are rejected by the confocal optical system and because the image is built up serially from individual measurements at every location across the cell, reducing the amount of time available to collect signal.

=== Quantum dots ===
Quantum dots are sometimes used in place of traditional fluorophores because of their narrower emission peaks.

=== Isotope labeling ===

Mass cytometry overcomes the fluorescent labeling limit by utilizing lanthanide isotopes attached to antibodies. This method could theoretically allow the use of 40 to 60 distinguishable labels and has been demonstrated for 30 labels. Mass cytometry is fundamentally different from flow cytometry: cells are introduced into a plasma, ionized, and associated isotopes are quantified via time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Although this method permits the use of a large number of labels, it currently has lower throughput capacity than flow cytometry. It also destroys the analysed cells, precluding their recovery by sorting.

==Cytometric bead array==
In addition to the ability to label and identify individual cells via fluorescent antibodies, cellular products such as cytokines, proteins, and other factors may be measured as well. Similar to ELISA sandwich assays, cytometric bead array (CBA) assays use multiple bead populations typically differentiated by size and different levels of fluorescence intensity to distinguish multiple analytes in a single assay. The amount of the analyte captured is detected via a biotinylated antibody against a secondary epitope of the protein, followed by a streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin treatment. The fluorescent intensity of R-phycoerythrin on the beads is quantified on a flow cytometer equipped with a 488 nm excitation source. Concentrations of a protein of interest in the samples can be obtained by comparing the fluorescent signals to those of a standard curve generated from a serial dilution of a known concentration of the analyte. Commonly also referred to as cytokine bead array (CBA).

== Impedance flow cytometry ==
Impedance-based single cell analysis systems are commonly known as Coulter counters. They represent a well-established method for counting and sizing virtually any kind of cells and particles. The label-free technology has recently been enhanced by a &quot;lab-on-a-chip&quot; based approach and by applying high frequency alternating current (AC) in the radio frequency range (from 100 kHz to 30 MHz) instead of a static direct current (DC) or low frequency AC field. This patented technology allows a highly accurate cell analysis and provides additional information like membrane capacitance and viability. The relatively small size and robustness allow battery powered on-site use in the field.

== Measurable parameters ==
Measurable factors in cellular analysis and flow cytometry include a diverse set of traits and indicators that provide important insights into cell biology and function. Flow cytometry techniques can quantify and evaluate these factors, allowing researchers to investigate and analyze various aspects of cells. Here are some important quantifiable parameters that are frequently investigated:
* Apoptosis: Apoptosis can be quantified by flow cytometry by measuring DNA destruction, mitochondrial membrane potential, permeability alterations, and caspase activity. These measurements reveal important details about planned cell death.
* Cell adherence: Flow cytometry can be used to investigate cell adherence, such as pathogen-host cell adherence. Researchers can quantify and analyze cell adhesion events by utilizing particular markers or fluorescent tags.
* Cell pigments: Chlorophyll and phycoerythrin are pigments found in certain cells. The presence and amounts of these pigments can be measured by flow cytometry, providing information about cellular metabolism and physiological states.
* Cell surface antigens: Flow cytometry is often used to identify and quantify cell surface antigens, also known as Cluster of Differentiation (CD) markers. Researchers can classify cell populations based on surface antigen expression by labeling cells with specific antibodies.

* Cell viability: Flow cytometry can be used as a cell viability assay by utilizing fluorescent dyes or markers that distinguish between live and dead cells. This parameter is critical in determining cell health and response to experimental or therapeutic settings. Viability of the cells in flow cytometry should be around 95% but not less than 90%.
* Circulating tumor cells: Flow cytometry is essential for isolating and purifying circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from blood samples. CTCs can be discovered and examined by targeting certain markers or features, assisting in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment monitoring.
* Characterizing multidrug resistance (MDR): Flow cytometry can be used to characterize multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells by assessing the efflux of fluorescent dyes or particular markers associated with drug resistance mechanisms. This knowledge aids in the understanding and battling of medication resistance in cancer treatment.
* Chromosome analysis and sorting: Flow cytometry can help with chromosome analysis and sorting, allowing for the creation of libraries and the identification of specific chromosomes or chromosomal abnormalities.
* DNA copy number variation: DNA copy number variation can be measured using flow cytometry techniques such as Flow-FISH or BACs-on-Beads technology. These technologies shed light on genetic changes linked to diseases such as cancer.
* Protein expression and modifications: Using fluorescently labeled antibodies or probes, flow cytometry makes it possible to assess protein expression levels and alterations such as phosphorylation. This parameter contributes to a better understanding of protein function and signaling networks.
* Membrane fluidity: Flow cytometry can detect membrane fluidity by utilizing fluorescent probes that are sensitive to membrane characteristics. This parameter gives information on the dynamics and function of cell membranes.
* Total DNA and RNA content: Flow cytometry can measure total DNA and RNA content in cells. This data is useful for cell cycle analyses, proliferation investigations, and determining gene expression changes.
* Monitoring intracellular parameters: Intracellular factors can be measured by flow cytometry, including pH, intracellular ionized calcium and magnesium levels, membrane potential, glutathione levels, and oxidative burst. These data provide information about cellular metabolism, signaling, and oxidative stress.
* Light scattering: Forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) measures are used in flow cytometry to assess cell volume and morphological complexity, respectively. These metrics describe the size, granularity, and shape of cells.
* Transgenic products: Flow cytometry is useful for assessing transgenic products in vivo, particularly fluorescent proteins like as green fluorescent protein (GFP) or similar variations. This enables scientists to investigate gene expression, protein localisation, and cellular dynamics.
* Various combinations: Flow cytometry allows you to integrate many measurable data, such as DNA/surface antigens, to acquire a comprehensive understanding of biological features and functions.

== Applications ==
The technology has applications in a number of fields, including molecular biology, pathology, immunology, virology, plant biology and marine biology. It has broad application in medicine especially in transplantation, hematology, tumor immunology and chemotherapy, prenatal diagnosis, genetics and sperm sorting for sex preselection. Flow cytometry is widely applied to detect sperm cells abnormality associated with DNA fragmentation in male fertility assays. Also, it is extensively used in research for the detection of DNA damage, caspase cleavage and apoptosis. Photoacoustic flow cytometry is used in the study of multi-drug-resistant bacteria (most commonly MRSA) to detect, differentiate, and quantify bacteria in the blood marked with dyed bacteriophages. In neuroscience, co-expression of cell surface and intracellular antigens can also be analyzed. In microbiology, it can be used to screen and sort transposon mutant libraries constructed with a GFP-encoding transposon (TnMHA), or to assess viability. In protein engineering, flow cytometry is used in conjunction with yeast display and bacterial display to identify cell surface-displayed protein variants with desired properties.
The main advantages of flow cytometry over histology and IHC is the possibility to precisely measure the quantities of antigens and the possibility to stain each cell with multiple antibodies-fluorophores, in current laboratories around 10 antibodies can be bound to each cell. This is much less than mass cytometer where up to 40 can be currently measured, but at a higher price and a slower pace.

=== Aquatic research ===
In aquatic systems, flow cytometry is used for the analysis of autofluorescing cells or cells that are fluorescently-labeled with added stains. This research started in 1981 when Clarice Yentsch used flow cytometry to measure the fluorescence in a red tide producing dinoflagellate. The next year researchers published flow cytometric measurements of multiple algal species which could be distinguished based on their fluorescence characteristics. By 1983, marine researchers were assembling their own flow cytometers or using commercially available flow cytometers on seawater samples collected off Bermuda to demonstrate that phytoplankton cells could be distinguished from non-living material and that cyanobacteria could be sorted from a mixed community and subsequently cultured in the lab. Flow cytometry also allowed marine researchers to distinguish between dimly-fluorescing &quot;Prochlorococcus&quot; and heterotrophic microorganisms, a distinction that is difficult with microscopy-based assessments. Advances in technology now allow aquatic scientists to use flow cytometers continuously during research cruises and flow cytometers are used to provide images of individual phytoplankton cells. Marine scientists use the sorting ability of flow cytometers to make discrete measurements of cellular activity and diversity, to conduct investigations into the mutualistic relationships between microorganisms that live in close proximity, and to measure biogeochemical rates of multiple processes in the ocean.

=== Cell proliferation assay ===
Cell proliferation is the major function in the immune system. Often it is required to analyse the proliferative nature of the cells in order to make some conclusions. One such assay to determine the cell proliferation is the tracking dye carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE). It helps to monitor proliferative cells. This assay gives quantitative as well as qualitative data during time-series experiments. This dye binds covalently with the long-lived molecules present inside the cell. When the cells divide, the molecules divide too and, the daughter cells possess half the dye than the parent population. This decrease in the intensity can be visualized by flow cytometry. In literature, this powerful technique of flow cytometry and CFSE has been used to find the efficiency of T-cells in killing the target cells in cancer such as leukemia. In order to visualize the target cell death, both rapid and slow, scientists have used CFSE labelling with antibody staining of certain kinds of cells and fluorescently labelled microbeads. This also gave information regarding the proliferation of the target cells upon the treatment of certain cytokines.

=== Measuring genome size ===
Flow cytometry has been used to measure genome sizes, or more precisely: the amount of DNA in a cell or nucleus. Although genomes can be analyzed with more precision by genome sequencing, this is often difficult due to a high fraction of micro-chromosomes or repetitive sequences which may be missed by sequencing (or which get filtered out during the analysis step when they cannot be assigned to chromosomes). However, flow cytometry is not perfect either. The resulting genome sizes may differ based on the dye used. An analysis of fish genomes resulted in significantly different genome sizes when propidium iodide (PI) and DAPI were used, respectively. For instance, the genome of &quot;Anguilla japonica&quot; was found to contain 1.09 pg of DNA with PI vs. 1.25 pg with DAPI. Similarly, the genome of &quot;Myxocyprinus asiaticus&quot; was found to contain 2.75 pg of DNA (PI) vs. 3.08 pg (DAPI). That is, the differences were on the order of 12–14%.

<doc id="501222" wikidata="Q33417" url="?curid=501222" title="Isan language">
<text>Isan or Northeastern Thai (autonym: /, ; , ) refers to the local development of the Lao language in Thailand, after the political split of the Lao-speaking world at the Mekong River at the conclusion of the Franco-Siamese crisis of 1893. The language is still referred to as Lao by native speakers.

As a variety of the Lao language, Isan belongs to the Southwestern branch of Tai languages in the Kra-Dai language family. It is most closely related to (other than Lao) &quot;tribal&quot; Tai languages such as Phu Thai and Tai Yo. Isan is officially classified as a dialect of the Thai language by the Thai government. Although (Central) Thai is a closely related Southwestern Tai language, it falls within a different subbranch. Central Thai and Isan are mutually intelligible only with difficulty; even though they share over 80% cognate vocabulary, they have very different tonal patterns and vowel qualities, and many commonly-used words in Isan differ from Thai, thus hampering comprehension.

The Lao language has had a long presence in Isan, arriving with migrants who followed the river valleys into Southeast Asia from southern China some time in the 8th to 10th centuries. The region of what is now Isan was nominally under the Lao kingdom of Lan Xang from 1354 to 1707. After the fall of Lan Xang, the Lao splinter kingdoms became tributary states of Siam. During the late 18th and much of the 19th century, Siamese soldiers carried out forced migrations of Lao people from the western bank of the Mekong River to the eastern bank, now Isan. As a result of these massive movements, Isan speakers comprise almost one-third of the population of Thailand and represent more than 80% of the population of Lao speakers overall. Isan is natively spoken by roughly 13-16 million people of the Isan region (2005), although the total population of speakers, including Isan people in other regions of Thailand and those that speak it as a second language, likely exceeds 22 million.

The Lao language in Thailand was preserved due to the Isan region&#x27;s large population, mountains that separated the region from the rest of the country, a conservative culture and ethnic appreciation of local traditions. The language was officially banned from being referred to as the Lao language in official Thai documents at the turn of the 20th century. Assimilatory laws of the 1930s that promoted Thai nationalism, Central Thai culture and mandatory use of Standard Thai led to a diglossic situation with the region&#x27;s inhabitants largely being bilingual and viewing themselves as Thai citizens. Isan is reserved as the language of the home, agrarian economy and provincial life. The Tai Noi script was also banned, thus making Isan a spoken language, although an ad hoc system of using Thai script and spelling of cognate words is used in informal communication.

Isan is also one of the poorest, least developed regions of Thailand, with many Isan people having little education, often employed as laborers, domestics, cooks, taxi drivers, and in other menial jobs. Combined with historic open prejudice toward Isan people, this has fueled a negative perception of the language. Despite its vigorous usage, since the mid-20th century, the language has been undergoing a slow relexification by Thai or language shift to Thai altogether, threatening the vitality of the language. However, with attitudes toward regional cultures becoming more relaxed in the late 20th century onwards, increased research into the language by Thai academics at Isan universities and an ethno-political stance often at odds with Bangkok, some efforts to help stem the slow disappearance of the language are beginning to take root, fostered by a growing awareness and appreciation of local culture, literature and history.

==Classification==

As an umbrella term for the Lao varieties as spoken in Northeastern Thailand, Isan remains essentially the same as the Lao language of Laos, albeit nonetheless differentiated in orthography and some minor lexical elements. Both right and left bank varieties are most closely related to the other Lao-Phuthai (Lao-Phoutai) languages such as Phuthai (Phoutai) and Tai Yo (Tai Gno), all which are mutually intelligible to each other. The Lao-Phuthai languages are closely related and somewhat mutually intelligible with the other Southwestern branch Tai languages such as the Chiang Saen languages, which includes Standard Thai, and the Northwestern languages, comprising the speech of the Dai/Shan peoples. Lao and Thai, despite separate development, were pushed closer together due to proximity and adoption of the same Khmer, Sanskrit and Pali loan words. Lao is distantly related to the various Zhuang languages that comprise the Northern and Central branches of Tai languages, and even more distantly to the other Kra-Dai languages.

Within Thailand, Isan is officially classified as a &#x27;Northeastern&#x27; dialect of the Thai language and is referred to as such in most official and academic works concerning the language produced in Thailand. The use of &#x27;Northeastern Thai&#x27; to refer to the language is re-enforced internationally with the descriptors in the ISO 639-3 and &quot;Glottolog&quot; language codes. Outside of official and academic Thai contexts, Isan is usually classified as a particular sub-grouping of the Lao language such as by native speakers, Laotian Lao and many linguists, it is also classified as a separate language in light of its unique history and Thai-language influence, such as its classification in &quot;Glottolog&quot; and &quot;Ethnologue&quot;.

==Names==
===Endonyms===
Isan people have traditionally referred to their speech as the &quot;Lao&quot; language (, , ). This is sometimes modified with the word &quot;tai&quot; (, , , ) or the related form &quot;Thai&quot; (, , ), which refers to Thailand or the Thai people, thus yielding &quot;Phasa Tai Lao&quot; (, , &#x27;language of the Lao people&#x27;) and &quot;Phasa Thai Lao&quot; (, , &#x27;Lao language of Thailand&#x27;).

&quot;Lao&quot; derives from an ancient Austroasiatic loan into Kra-Dai, *&quot;k.ra:w&quot;, which signified a &#x27;(venerable) person&#x27; and is also ultimately the source of the Isan words &quot;lao&quot; (, , , &#x27;he/she/it&#x27;), and &quot;hao&quot; (, , , &#x27;we/us&#x27;). &quot;Tai&quot; and &quot;Thai&quot; both derive from another Austroasiatic loan into Kra-Dai, *&quot;k.riː&quot;, which signifies a &#x27;(free) person&#x27;. The various Kra–Dai peoples have traditionally used variants of either *&quot;k.riː&quot; or *&quot;k.ra:w&quot; as ethnic and linguistic self-appellations, sometimes even interchangeably.

Isan people tend to refer to themselves and their language as &quot;Lao&quot; only when in settings with other Isan people, where the language can be used freely, typically away from other Thai-speaking people. Isan speakers typically find the term &quot;Lao&quot; offensive when used by outsiders, due to its usage as a discriminatory slur, often insinuating their rural upbringings, superstitious beliefs, links with the Lao people of Laos (i.e., not Thai) and traditional, agrarian lifestyles. In dealings with Lao people from Laos, Isan people may sometimes use &quot;Phasa Lao Isan&quot; or &#x27;Isan Lao language&#x27; or simply &quot;Isan&quot; when clarification is needed as to their origins or why their accents differ. The use of &quot;Lao&quot; or &quot;Lao Isan&quot; identity, although eschewed by younger generations, is making a comeback, but use of these terms outside of private settings or with other Lao people has strong political associations, especially with the far-left political movements advocating greater autonomy for the region.

As a result, younger people have adopted the neologism &quot;Isan&quot; to describe themselves and their language, as it conveniently avoids ambiguity with the Laotian Lao as well as association with movements, historical and current, that tend to be leftist and at odds with the central government in Bangkok. The language is also called affectionately &quot;Phasa Ban Hao&quot; (, , ), which can be translated as either &#x27;our home language&#x27; or &#x27;our village language&#x27;.

===Exonyms===
Isan is known in Thai by the following two names, officially and academically: &quot;Phasa Thai Tawan Ok Chiang Nuea&quot; (, , &#x27;Northeastern Thai language&#x27;), and &quot;Phasa Thai Thin Isan&quot; (, , &#x27;Thai language of the Isan region&#x27;). These names emphasise the official position of Isan speech as a dialect of the Thai language. In more relaxed contexts, Thai people generally refer to the language as &quot;Phasa Thai Isan&quot; () or simply &quot;Phasa Isan&quot; (, , &#x27;Isan language&#x27;).

The term &quot;Isan&quot; derives from an older form (), which in turn is a derivative of Sanskrit &quot;Īśāna&quot; (), which signifies the &#x27;northeast&#x27; or &#x27;northeastern direction&#x27; as well as the name of an aspect of Lord Shiva as guardian of that direction. It was also the name of the Khmer capital of Chenla whose rule extended over the southern part of the region. After the integration of the &quot;Monthon Lao&quot; into Siam in 1893, the Siamese also abolished the use of the terms of &quot;Lao&quot; in place names as well as self-references in the census to encourage assimilation of the Lao people within its new borders. However, due to the distinct culture and language and the need to disassociate the people and region from Laos, the term &quot;Isan&quot; came into being for the region of Isan as well as its ethnic Lao people and their Lao speech, although it originally only referred to districts which now comprise the southern portion of Northeastern Thailand.

Use of &quot;Lao&quot; by native Thai speakers was originally for all Tai peoples that were not Siamese, and was once for Northern Thai people as well, but the term gradually came to be thought of only referring to the ethnic Lao people of Isan and contemporary Laos. When used by Thai people, it is often offensive, given the history of prejudice against Isan people for their distinct culture and language, as well as perceived links with the communist Lao in Laos. Nevertheless, within Northeastern Thailand, &quot;Lao&quot; is the general term used by the various ethnic minorities that speak it as a first, second or third language. Thai speakers may also use &quot;Phasa Ban Nok&quot; (, ), which can translate as &#x27;rural&#x27;, &#x27;upcountry&#x27; or &#x27;provincial language&#x27;. Although it is often used by Thai speakers to refer to the Isan language, since the region is synonymous in Thai minds to rural agriculture, it is also used for any rural, unsophisticated accent, even of Central Thai.

In Laos, the Lao people also refer to the language as &quot;Phasa Lao&quot; (, ), but when necessary to distinguish it from the dialects spoken in Laos, the terms &quot;Phasa Tai Lao&quot; (, , &#x27;Lao language of Thailand&#x27;) and &quot;Phasa Lao Isan&quot; (, , &#x27;Isan Lao language&#x27;) can also be used. In most other languages of the world, &#x27;Isan&#x27; or translations of &#x27;Northeastern Thai language&#x27; are used.

==Geographical distribution==
The homeland of the Isan language is mainly the twenty provinces of Northeastern Thailand, also known as &quot;Phak Isan&quot; (), &#x27;Isan region&#x27; or just &quot;Isan&quot;. The region is covered by the flat topography of the Khorat Plateau. The Lao language was able to thrive in the region due to its historical settlement pattern, which included the vast depopulation of the left bank of the Mekong to the right bank and its geographical isolation from the rest of what is now Thailand. The peaks of the Phetsabun and Dong Phanya Nyen mountains to the west and the Sankamphaeng to the southwest separate the region from the rest of Thailand and the Damlek ridges forming the border with Cambodia. The Phu Phan Mountains divide the plateau into a northern third drained by the Loei and Songkhram rivers and a southern third drained by the Mun River and its predominate tributary, the Si. The Mekong River &#x27;separates&#x27; Isan speakers from Lao speakers in Laos as it is the geopolitical boundary between Thailand and Laos, with a few exceptions.

Isan speakers spill over into some portions of Uttaradit and Phitsanulok provinces as well as the northernmost fringes of Phetsabun to the northwest of the Isan region, with speakers in these areas generally speaking dialects akin to Luang Phrabang. In the southwest, Isan speakers are also found in portions of Sa Kaeo and Phrasinburi provinces. In addition, large numbers of Isan people have left the region for other major cities of Thailand for employment, with large pockets of speakers found in Bangkok and its surrounding areas as well as major cities across the region. Outside of Thailand, it is likely that Isan speakers can also be found in the United States, South Korea, Australia, Taiwan and Germany which house the largest populations of Overseas Thai.

==History==
===Shared history with the Lao language===
===Separate development of the Isan language===
====Integration Period (1893—1932)====
After the French established their protectorate over the left bank Lao-speaking territories that became Laos during the conclusion of the Franco-Siamese crisis of 1893, the right bank was absorbed into Siam which was then ruled by King Wachirawut. To prevent further territorial concessions, the Siamese implemented a series of reforms that introduced Western concepts of statehood, administrative reforms and various measures to integrate the region which was until this point ruled as semi-autonomous out-lying territories nominally under the authority of the Lao kings. With the creation of provinces grouped into districts known as &quot;monthon&quot; (, , ), the power of local Lao princes of the &quot;mueang&quot; in tax collection and administration was moved and replaced by crown-appointed governors from Bangkok which removed the official use of Lao written in Tai Noi in local administration. To achieve this, King Wachirawut had the help of his brother, Prince Damrongrachanuphap who recommended the system. The end of local autonomy and the presence of foreign troops led the Lao people to rebel under the influence of millennialist cult leaders or &quot;phu mi bun&quot; (, , ) during the Holy Man&#x27;s Rebellion (1901—1902), the last united Lao resistance to Siamese rule, but the rebellion was brutally suppressed by Siamese troops and the reforms were fully implemented in the region shortly afterward.

Further reforms were implemented to assimilate and integrate the people of the &quot;Lao &quot;Monthon&quot;&quot; into Siam. References to the &#x27;Lao&#x27; and many cities and towns were renamed, such as the former districts Monthon Lao Gao and Monthon Lao Phuan which were renamed as &#x27;Monthon Ubon&#x27; and &#x27;Monthon Udon&#x27;, respectively, shortly after their creation in 1912. Self-designation as Lao in the census was banned after 1907, with the Lao forced to declare themselves as Thai and speakers of a Thai dialect. The unofficial use of Lao to refer to them was discouraged, and the term &#x27;Isan&#x27;, originally just a name of the southern part of the &#x27;Lao &quot;Monthon&quot;&#x27;, was extended to the entire region, its primary ethnic group and language. The name change and replacement of the Lao language by Thai at the administrative level and reforms to implement Thai had very little effect as the region&#x27;s large Lao population and isolation prevented quick implementation. Monks still taught young boys to read the Tai Noi script written on palm-leaf manuscripts since there were no schools, passages from old literature were often read during festivals and traveling troupes of &quot;mo lam&quot; and shadow puppet performers relied on written manuscripts for the lyrics to poetry and old stories set to song and accompanied by the &quot;khaen&quot; alone or alongside other local instruments. Mountains, lack of roads, large areas without access to water during the dry season and flooding in the wet season continued to shield the Isan people and their language from direct Thai-language influence.

====Thaification (1930s–1960s)====

Suppression of the Isan language came with the &#x27;Thai cultural mandates&#x27; and other reforms that aimed to elevate Central Thai culture and language, reverence to the monarchy and the symbols of state and complete integration into Thailand, known as &#x27;Thaification&#x27;. Most of these reforms were implemented by Plaek Phibunsongkhram, who changed the English name of Siam to &#x27;Thailand&#x27; and whose ultra-nationalistic policies would mark Thailand during his rule from 1938 to 1944 and 1948–1957. These policies implemented an official diglossia. Isan was removed from public and official discourse to make way for Thai and the written language was banned, relegating Isan to an unwritten language of the home. Public schools, which finally were built in the region, focussed heavily on indoctrinating Isan people to revere the Thai monarchy, loyalty to the state and its symbols and mastery of the Thai language, with Isan treated as an inferior dialect. Pride in the language was erased as students were punished or humiliated for using the language in the classroom or writing in Tai Noi, planting the seed for future language shift as the region became bilingual.

The old written language and the rich literature written in it were banned and was not discussed in schools. Numerous temples had their libraries seized and destroyed, replacing the old Lao religious texts, local histories, literature and poetry collections with Thai-script, Thai-centric manuscripts. The public schools also dismissed the old monks from their role as educators unless they complied with the new curriculum. This severed the Isan people from knowledge of their written language, shared literary history and ability to communicate via writing with the left bank Lao. In tandem with its removal from education and official contexts, the Thai language made a greater appearance in people&#x27;s lives with the extension of the railroad to Ubon and Khon Kaen and with it the telegraph, radio and a larger number of Thai civil servants, teachers and government officials in the region that did not learn the local language.

Words for new technologies and the political realities of belonging to the Thai state arrived from Thai, including words of English and Chinese (primarily Teochew) origin, as well as neologisms created from Sanskrit roots. Laos, still under French rule, turned to French, Vietnamese, repurposing of old Lao vocabulary as well as Sanskrit-derived coinages that were generally the same, although not always, as those that developed in Thai. For example, the word or aeroplane (UK)/airplane (US) in Isan was &quot;huea bin&quot; ( ) &#x27;flying boat&#x27;, but was generally replaced by Thai-influenced &quot;khrueang bin&quot; ( ) &#x27;flying machine&#x27;, whereas Lao retained &quot;hua bin&quot; ( ) RTGS &quot;huea bin&quot;. Similarly, a game of billiards in Isan is ( from English via Thai; whereas on the left bank, people play &quot;biya&quot; ( ) from French &quot;billard&quot; . Despite this slow shift, the spoken language maintained its Lao features since most of the population was still engaged in agriculture, where Thai was not needed, thus many Isan people never mastered Thai fully even if they used it as a written language and understood it fine.

====1960s to Present====
The language shift to Thai and the increased influence of the Thai language really came to the fore in the 1960s due to several factors. Roads were finally built into the region, making Isan no longer unreachable for much of the year, and the arrival of television with its popular news broadcasts and soap operas penetrated into people&#x27;s homes at this time. As lands new lands to clear for cultivation were no longer available, urbanization began to occur, as well as the massive seasonal migration of Isan people to Bangkok during the dry season, taking advantage of the economic boom occurring in Thailand with increased western investment due to its more stable, non-communist government and openness. Having improved their Thai during employment in Bangkok, the Isan people returned to their villages, introducing the Bangkok slang words back home and peppering their speech with more and more Thai words.

Around the 1990s, although the perceived political oppression continues and Thaification policies remain, attitudes towards regional languages relaxed. Academics at Isan universities began exploring the local language, history, culture and other folklore, publishing works that helped bring serious attention to preserving the Lao features of the language and landscape, albeit under an Isan banner. Students can participate in clubs that promote local music, sung in the local Lao language, or local dances native to the area. Knowledge about the history of the region and its long neglect and abuse by Siamese authorities and resurrection of pride in local culture are coming to the fore, increasing expressions of &#x27;Isan-ness&#x27; in the region. However, Thaification policies and the language shift to Thai continue unabated. Recognition of the Isan language as an important regional language of Thailand did not provide any funding for its preservation or maintenance other than a token of acknowledgment of its existence.

==Language status==
===Legal status===
&quot;Ethnologue&quot; describes the Isan language as &quot;&#x27;de facto&quot; language of provincial identity&#x27; which &#x27;is the language of identity for citizens of the province, but this is not mandated by law. Neither is it developed enough or known enough to function as the language of government business.&#x27; Although Thailand does recognise the regional Tai languages, including Isan, as important aspects of regional culture and communication, the Isan language and other minority languages are still inferior to the social and cultural prestige of Standard Thai and its government sanctioned promotion in official, educational and national usage. However, the Thaification laws that banned the old Lao alphabet and forced the Lao to refer to themselves and their language as &#x27;Thai Isan&#x27; never banned the language in the home nor the fields and the Isan people steadfastly clung to their spoken language.

The situation is in stark contrast to Laos where the Lao language is actively promoted as a language of national unity. Laotian Lao people are very conscious of their distinct, non-Thai language and although influenced by Thai-language media and culture, strive to maintain &#x27;good Lao&#x27;. Although spelling has changed, the Lao speakers in Laos continue to use a modified form of the &quot;Tai Noi&quot; script, the modern Lao alphabet.

===Spoken status===
According to the EGIDS scale, Isan is at Stage VIA, or &#x27;vigorous&#x27;, meaning the language is used for &#x27;face-to-face communication by all generations and the situation is sustainable&#x27;. Although various studies indicate that Isan is spoken by almost everyone in Northeastern Thailand, the language is under threat from Thai, as Thai replaces the unique vocabulary specific to Lao speakers, and language shift, as more and more children are being raised to speak only Standard Thai. The lack of prestige of the language and the need for Thai to advance in government, education and professional realms or seek employment outside of Northeastern Thailand, such as Bangkok, necessitate the use and mastery of proper Thai over proper Lao.

The language suffers from a negative perception and diglossia, so speakers have to limit their use of the language to comfortable, informal settings. Parents often view the language as a detriment to the betterment of their children, who must master Standard Thai to advance in school or career paths outside of agriculture. The use of the Thai script, spelling cognate words in Isan as they are in Thai, also gives a false perception of the dialectal subordination of Isan and the errors of Isan pronunciation which deviate from Thai. As a result, a generational gap has arisen with old speakers using normative Lao and younger speakers using a very &#x27;Thaified&#x27; version of Isan, increased code-switching or outright exclusive use of Thai. Many linguists and scholars of the Isan language believe that Thai relexification cannot be halted unless the script is returned, but this has little public or government support.

===Written language usage and vitality===

The written language is currently at Stage IX, which on the EGIDS scale is a &#x27;language [that] serves as a reminder of heritage identity for an ethnic community, but no one has more than symbolic proficiency&#x27;. This applies to both the &quot;Tai Noi&quot; script used for secular literature and the &quot;Tua Tham&quot; script previously used for Buddhist texts. Only a handful of people of very advanced age and caretakers of monasteries whose libraries were not destroyed during the Thaification implementation in the 1930s are able to read either script. Evidence for the use of the written language is hard to find, but well-worn murals of very old temples often have small bits of writing in the old script.

In Laos, the orthography is a direct descendant of &quot;Tai Noi&quot; and continues its role as the official written language of the Lao language of the left bank as well as the script used to transcribe minority languages. The Lao written language has unified the dialects to some extent as well, as though the differences between dialects are sharper in Laos than Isan, one common writing system unites them.

===Language threats===
====Negative perceptions====
Acknowledgment of the unique history of the Isan language and the fact it is derived from a closely related albeit separate language is lacking, with the official and public position being that the language is a dialect of Thai. As a result of the great difference from Thai, based on tone, nasal vowels of a different quality and a special set of Lao vocabulary unfamiliar to Thai speakers, it is considered an &#x27;inferior form of Thai&#x27; as opposed to its own separate language. The traditional avoidance of the language in the formal sphere re-enforces the superiority of Thai, which the Isan people have internalized to the point many do not have high opinions of their first language. Combined with vocabulary retentions, many of which sound oddly archaic or have become pejorative in Standard Thai, perpetuate the myth and negative perception of Isan as an uncouth language of rural poverty and hard agricultural life. Due to associations with Laos, the language was also viewed as a potential fifth column for Lao irredentism and the spread of communism into Thailand. It was in the recent past quite common for Isan people to be corrected or ridiculed when they spoke because of their incomplete mastery of Standard Thai.

In polling of language favorability amongst the general population of Thailand, the Isan language ranks last after Standard Thai and the primary Thai dialect of the other regions. As a result of the need for Standard Thai proficiency in order to have better educational and employment prospects and avoid discrimination, anecdotal evidence suggests that more and more Isan children are being raised in the Thai language and are discouraged from using the local language at home. The Thai language has already begun to displace the predominance of Isan in the major market towns, in part because they are often also administrative centers, and in some major cities, universities have attracted students from other regions.

====Code-switching====
Since the late 1930s, Isan has been a bilingual area, with most people using Isan at home and in the village, but due to diglossia, switching to Thai for school, work and formal situations. Like all bilingual societies, Isan speakers often code-switch in and out of the Thai language. For example, in an analysis of the eighty-eight volumes of the comic &quot;หนูหิ่น อินเดอะซิตี้&quot; ( in the city), the Thai language was used 62.91 percent of the time to properly quote someone—such as someone that speaks Thai, 21.19 percent of the time to provide further explanation and 8.61 percent of the time to re-iterate a previous statement for clarification. There are seven areas where the Thai language is employed, aside from direct quotation, such as the following: explanations, interjections, Thai culture, emphasis, re-iterations and jokes.

Although some Isan people may not speak the language well, Thai is a convenient language of clarification, especially between Isan speakers of different dialects that may be unfamiliar with local terms of the other speaker. As Isan does not exist in formal, technical, political or academic domains, it is generally more comfortable for Isan speakers to use Thai in these areas as a result of the diglossia, with many Isan speakers unaware or unfamiliar with native terms and &quot;belles-lettres&quot; that are still used in contemporary Lao. Thai is also sometimes used to avoid Isan features that are stigmatized in Thai, such as retention of vocabulary that is pejorative or archaic as well as Lao pronunciations of cognate words that sound &#x27;folksy&#x27;. Despite the fact that code-switching is a natural phenomenon, younger generations are blurring the distinction between languages, using more Thai-like features and as they forget to switch back to Isan, language shift takes hold.

====Thai-influenced language shift====
The Thai language may not be the primary language of Isan, but Isan people are in constant exposure to it. It is required to watch the ever-popular soap operas, news, and sports broadcasts or sing popular songs, most of it produced in Bangkok or at least in its accent. Thai is also needed as a written language for instructions, to read labels on packages, road signs, newspapers and books. Isan children who may struggle to acquire the language, are forced to learn the language as part of compulsory education and often when they are older, for employment. Although attitudes towards regional cultures and languages began to relax in the late 1980s, the legal and social pressures of Thaification and the need for Thai to participate in daily life and wider society continue. The influence of Thai aside, anecdotal evidence suggests that many older Isan lament the corruption of the spoken language spoken by younger generations and that the younger generations are no longer familiar with the traditional Lao forms used by previous generations.

In a 2016 study of language shift, villagers in an Isan-speaking village were divided by age and asked to respond to various questionnaires to determine lexical usage of Lao terms, with those born prior to 1955, those born between 1965 and 1990 and those born after 1990. The results show what would be expected of a language undergoing language shift. As Isan and Thai already have a similar grammatical structure and syntax, the main variance is in lexical shift, essentially the replacement of Isan vocabulary. The oldest generation, at the time in their 60s or older, uses very normative Lao features little different than those found in Laos. The middle generations, ranging from 35 to 50 years of age, had a greater prevalence of Thai vocabulary, but overall maintained a traditional Isan lexicon, with the Thai terms usually not the primary spoken forms. The youngest generation, although still arguably using very many Lao phrases and vocabulary, had a remarkable replacement of Isan vocabulary, with Thai forms becoming either the primary variant or replacing the Isan word altogether. Similarly, when Isan usage has two variants, generally a common one not understood in Thai and another that is usually a cognate, younger speakers tend to use the cognates with greater frequency, pushing their speech to Thai as older speakers will use them in variance.

Thai loan words were generally localized in pronunciation, easing them into the flow of Isan conversation and unnoticeable to most but the oldest members of the community that preserve &#x27;proper Isan&#x27; usage. Although the youngest generation was still speaking a distinct language, each generation brings the increased risk of the Isan language&#x27;s extinction as it becomes relexified to the point of no longer being a separate language but a dialect of Thai with some Lao influence. The lack of official usage, official support for its maintenance and lack of language prestige hinder attempts to revitalize or strengthen the language against the advance of Thai.

===Continued survival===
The development of &#x27;Isan&#x27; identity and a resurgence in attention to the language has brought increased attention and study of the language. Academics at universities are now offering courses in the language and its grammar, conducting research into the old literature archives that were preserved. Digitizing palm-leaf manuscripts and providing Thai-script transcription is being conducted as a way to both preserve the rapidly decaying documents and re-introduce them to the public. The language can be heard on national television during off-peak hours, when music videos featuring many Isan artists of molam and Isan adaptations of Central Thai luk thung music. In 2003, HRH Princess Royal Sirinthon was the patron of the Thai Youth Mo Lam Competition.

==Phonology==
===Consonants===
====Initials====
Isan shares its consonant inventory with the Lao language whence it derives. The plosive and affricate consonants can be further divided into three voice-onset times of voiced, tenuis and aspirated consonants. For example, Isan has the plosive set of voiced , tenuis which is like the &#x27;p&#x27; in &#x27;spin&#x27; and aspirated like the &#x27;p&#x27; in &#x27;puff&#x27;. Isan and Lao lack the sound and its allophone of Thai, replacing these sounds with in analogous environments. Similarly, is rare. Words in Isan and Lao cognate to Thai word with have either or in their place, although educated speakers in Isan or Laos may pronounce some words with . In Central and Southern Thai, words with may be pronounced as (lambdacism) in casual environments although this is frowned upon in formal or cultivated speech.

Unlike Central and Southern Thai, Isan and Lao have a – distinction, whereas cognate words from Isan and Lao with are all in Central and Southern Thai. Substitution of with , which is not used in Thai, is common in large areas of both Laos and Isan but is not universal in either region, but is particularly associated with areas influenced by Vientiane and Central Lao dialects. The glottal stop occurs any time a word begins with a vowel, which is always built around a null consonant.
* Only used in Sanskrit or Pali loan words.
* Unique to Isan and Lao, does not occur in Thai but is only an allophone of whereas is phonemic.
* Central and Southern Thai spelling does not distinguish from .
* Lao ligature of silent (ຫ) or digraph; Thai digraph with silent (ห).
* Only as syllable-initial consonants.
* Use of is Thai interference in Isan and rare in Laos, usually interference from a northern tribal Tai language, almost always .
* Still taught as part of the alphabet, &#x27;ฃ&#x27; and &#x27;ฅ&#x27; are obsolete and have been replaced by &#x27;ข&#x27; and &#x27;ค&#x27;, respectively.
* Mark of interference from Isan or erudition in Laos. Usually replaced by and even by &#x27;ລ&#x27; in modern Lao writing.
* Used to mark in words that are etymologically .
* All words that begin with vowels must be written with the anchor consonant and are pronounced with a glottal stop.
* Generally used in pre-1970s Lao.
* Only in very casual, informal Thai.
* Allophone of in some dialects.

====Clusters====
Consonant clusters are rare in spoken Lao as they disappear shortly after the adoption of writing. In native words, only /kw/ and /kʰw/ are permissible, but these can only occur before certain vowels due to the diphthongization that occurs before the vowels /aC/, /am/, /aː/ and /aːj/. Isan speakers, who are educated in Thai and often use Thai spelling of etymological vocabulary to transcribe Isan, will generally not pronounce consonant clusters but may do so when code-switching to Thai or when pronouncing high-brow words of Sanskrit, Pali or Khmer derivation. Lao speakers from Laos will sometimes pronounce clusters in these borrowed loan words, but this is restricted to aging speakers of the Laotian diaspora.
* Before /aC/, /aː/, /aːj/ and /am/ diphthongization occurs which assimilates the /w/ so it is only a true cluster in other vowel environments, only occurs in Isan and Lao.

====Finals====
Isan shares with both Lao and Thai a restrictive set of permissible consonant sounds at the end of a syllable or word. Isan, using its current method of writing according to Thai etymological spelling, preserves the spelling to imply the former sound of borrowed loan words even if the pronunciation has been assimilated. Due to spelling reforms in Laos, the letters that can end a word were restricted to a special set of letters, but older writers and those in the Lao diaspora occasionally use some of the more etymological spellings.

In pronunciation, all plosive sounds (besides the glottal stop /ʔ/) are unreleased, as a result, there is no voicing of final consonants or any release of air. The finals /p/, /t/ and /k/ are thus actually pronounced , , and , respectively.

Of the consonant letters, excluding the disused ฃ and ฅ, six (ฉ ผ ฝ ห อ ฮ) cannot be used as a final and the other 36 are grouped as following.
* Where alternative spellings once existed, only these consonants can end words in modern Lao.
* Used in pre-1970s Lao spelling as word-final letters.
* Glottal stop is unwritten but is pronounced at the end of short vowels that occur at the end of a consonant.
* These occur only as parts of diphthongs or triphthongs and are usually included as parts of vowels.

===Vowels===
The vowel structure of Isan is the similar as the central and southern Lao dialects of Laos. The vowel quality is also similar to Thai, but differs in that the two back vowels, close back unrounded vowel /ɯ/ and the close-mid back unrounded vowel /ɤ/, centralized as the close central unrounded vowel /ɨ/ and the mid central vowel /ə/ in some speakers, respectively, as well as in diphthongs that may include these sounds. To Thai speakers, Isan and Lao vowels tend to have a nasal quality.

In many cases, especially diphthongs with /u/ as first element is lengthened in Isan as it is in Standard Lao, so that the word &quot;tua&quot; which means &#x27;body&#x27; (, written the same in Isan) is pronounced in Thai but in Isan as in some dialects, similar to . The symbol &#x27;◌&#x27; indicates the required presence of a consonant, or for words that begin with a vowel sound, the &#x27;null consonant&#x27; &#x27;อ&#x27; or its Lao equivalent, &#x27;ອ&#x27;, which in words that begin with a vowel, represents the glottal stop /ʔ/. Short vowels that end with &#x27;◌ะ&#x27; or Lao &#x27;◌ະ&#x27; also end with a glottal stop.

Thai and Lao are both abugida scripts, so certain vowels are pronounced without being written, taking the form of /a/ in open syllables and /o/ in closed syllables, i.e., ending in a consonant. For example, the Khmer loan word &quot;phanom&quot; or &#x27;hill&#x27; found in many place names in Isan is or &#x27;PH-N-M&#x27; but pronounced , with &#x27;PH&#x27; as the open syllable and &#x27;N-M&#x27; as the closed syllable. In Lao orthography, inherited from Tai Noi, closed syllables are marked with a &#x27;ົ&#x27; over the consonants and the /a/ of open syllables was unwritten, thus or &#x27;Ph-N-o-M&#x27;. In current practice as a result of spelling reforms, all vowels are written out and in modern or &#x27;Ph-a-N-o-M&#x27; is more common thus modern Lao is no longer a true abugida.

====Vowel length====
Vowels usually exist in long-short pairs determined by vowel length which is phonemic, but vowel length is not indicated in the RTGS romanization used in Thai or the BGN/PCGN French-based scheme commonly used in Laos. The Isan word romanized as &quot;khao&quot; can represent both , &#x27;he&#x27; or &#x27;she&#x27;, and , &#x27;white&#x27; which corresponds to and , respectively, which are also romanized as &quot;khao&quot;. In these cases, the pairs of words have the same tone and pronunciation and are differentiated solely by vowel length.
* Unwritten in open syllables.
* Unwritten in closed syllables.

====Diphthongs====

* Considered long vowels for the purpose of determining tone.
* Archaic usage common in pre-1970s Lao.
* The Thai vowel &#x27;ำ&#x27; is a short vowel. In Isan, it is diphthongized after /w/ into /uam/.

====Triphthongs====

* Considered long vowels for the purpose of determining tone.
* Archaic usage common in pre-1970s Lao.

====Tones====
==Grammar==

Isan words are not inflected, declined, conjugated, making Isan, like Lao and Thai, an analytic language. Special particle words function in lieu of prefixes and suffixes to mark verb tense. The majority of Isan words are monosyllabic, but compound words and numerous other very common words exist that are not. Topologically, Isan is a subject–verb–object (SVO) language, although the subject is often dropped. Word order is an important feature of the language.

Although in formal situations, standard Thai is often used, formality is marked in Isan by polite particles attached to the end of statements, and use of formal pronouns. Compared to Thai, Isan sounds very formal as pronouns are used with greater frequency, which occurs in formal Thai, but is more direct and simple compared to Thai. The ending particles เด้อ (doe, ) or เด (de, ) function much like ครับ (khrap, ), used by males, and ค่ะ (kha, ), used by females, in Thai. (Isan speakers sometimes use the Thai particles in place of or after เด้อ or เด.) Negative statements often end in ดอก (dok, ), which can also be followed by the particle เด้อ and its variant.

===Nouns===
Nouns in Isan are not marked for plurality, gender or case and do not require an indefinite or definite article. Some words, mainly inherited from Sanskrit or Pali, have separate forms for male or female, such as &quot;thewa&quot; ( , cf. BGN/PCGN &quot;théva&quot;), &#x27;god&#x27; or &#x27;angel&#x27; (masculine) and &quot;thewi&quot; ( , cf. BGN/PCGN &quot;thévi&quot;), &#x27;goddess&#x27; or &#x27;angel&#x27; (feminine) which derives from masculine &quot;deva&quot; ( and feminine &quot;devī&quot; ( ). This is also common in names of Sanskrit origin, such as masculine &quot;Arun&quot; ( , cf. BGN/PCGN &quot;Aloun&quot;/&quot;Aroun&quot;) and feminine &quot;Aruni&quot; ( , cf. BGN/PCGN &quot;Arouni&quot;/&quot;Alounee&quot;) which derives from &quot;Arun&quot; ) and &quot;Arunī&quot; , respectively. In native Tai words which usually do not distinguish gender, animals will take the suffixes &quot;phu&quot; ( , cf. BGN/PCGN &quot;phou&quot;) or &quot;mae&quot; ( , cf. BGN/PCGN &quot;mè&quot;). For example, a cat in general is &quot;maeo&quot; ( , cf. BGN/PCGN &quot;mèo&quot;), but a tomcat is &quot;maeo phu&quot; () and a queen (female cat) is &quot;maeo mae&quot; (), respectively.

===Classifiers===
Verbs are easily made into nouns by adding the prefixes ความ (khwam) and การ (kan) before verbs that express abstract actions and verbs that express physical actions, respectively. Adjectives and adverbs, which can function as complete predicates, only use ความ.

===Pronouns===
Isan traditionally uses the Lao-style pronouns, although in formal contexts, the Thai pronouns are sometimes substituted as speakers adjust to the socially mandated use of Standard Thai in very formal events. Although all the Tai languages are pro-drop languages that omit pronouns if their use is unnecessary due to context, especially in informal contexts, but they are restored in more careful speech. Compared to Thai, Isan and Lao frequently use the first- and second-person pronouns and rarely drop them in speech which can sometimes seem more formal and distant. More common is to substitute pronouns with titles of professions or extension of kinship terms based on age, thus it is very common for lovers or close friends to call each other &#x27;brother&#x27; and &#x27;sister&#x27; and to address the very elderly as &#x27;grandfather&#x27; or &#x27;grandmother&#x27;.

To turn a pronoun into a plural, it is most commonly prefixed with &quot;mu&quot; ( , cf. BGN/PCGN &quot;mou&quot;) but the variants &quot;tu&quot; ( , cf. BGN/PCGN &quot;tou&quot;) and &quot;phuak&quot; ( , cf. BGN/PCGN &quot;phouak&quot;) are also used by some speakers. These can also be used for the word &quot;hao&quot;, &#x27;we&#x27;, in the sense of &#x27;all of us&#x27; for extra emphasis. The vulgar pronouns are used as a mark of close relationship, such as long-standing childhood friends or siblings and can be used publicly, but they can never be used outside of these relationships as they often change statements into very pejorative, crude or inflammatory remarks.

===Numbers===
===Adjectives and adverbs===
There is no general distinction between adjectives and adverbs, and words of this category serve both functions and can even modify each other. Duplication is used to indicate greater intensity. Only one word can be duplicated per phrase. Adjectives always come after the noun they modify; adverbs may come before or after the verb depending on the word. There is usually no copula to link a noun to an adjective.
* เด็กหนุ่ม (dek num) &quot;A young child.&quot;
* เด็กหนุ่ม ๆ (dek num num) &quot;A very young child.&quot;
* เด็กหนุ่มที่ไว้ (dek num thi wai) &quot;A child who becomes young quickly.&quot;
* เด็กหนุ่มที่ไว้ ๆ (dek num thi wai wai) &quot;A child who becomes young quickly.&quot;

Comparatives take the form &quot;A X กว่า B&quot; (kwa) , A is more X than B. The superlative is expressed as &quot;A X ที่สุด (thi sut) , A is most X.
* เด็กหนุ่มกว่าผู้แก่ (dek num kwa phukae) &quot;The child is younger than an old person.&quot;
* เด็กหนุ่มที่สุด (dek num thi sut) &quot;The child is youngest.&quot;

Because adjectives or adverbs can be used as predicates, the particles that modify verbs are also used.
* เด็กซิหนุ่ม (dek si num) &quot;The child will be young.&quot;
* เด็กหนุ่มแล้ว (dek num laew) &quot;The child was young.&quot;

===Verbs===
Verbs are not declined for voice, number, or tense. To indicate tenses, particles can be used, but it is also very common just to use words that indicate the time frame, such as มื้ออื่น (mue uen) &quot;tomorrow&quot; or มื้อวานนี้ (mue wan ni) &quot;yesterday.&quot;

Negation: Negation is indicated by placing บ่ (bo) /bɔ́ː/ before the word being negated. 
* อีน้องกินหมากเลน (i nong kin mak len) / &quot;Younger sister eats tomatoes.&quot;
* อีน้องบ่กินหมากเลน (i nong bao bo kin mak len) &quot;Younger sister does not eat tomatoes.&quot;

Future tense: Future tense is indicated by placing the particles จะ (cha) or สิ (si) before the verb.
* อีน้องจะกินหมากเลน (i nong cha kin mak len) &quot;Younger sister will eat tomatoes.&quot;
* อีน้องสิกินหมากเลน (i nong see kin mak len) &quot;Younger sister will eat tomatoes.&quot;

Past tense: Past tense is indicated by either placing ได้ (dai) before the verb or แล้ว (laew) after the verb or even using both in tandem for emphasis. แล้ว is the more common one, and can be used to indicate completed actions or current actions of the immediate past. ได้ is often used with negative statements and never for present action.
* อีน้องได้กินหมากเลน (i nong dai kin mak len) &quot;Younger sister ate tomatoes.&quot;
* อีน้องกินหมากเลนแล้ว (i nong kin mak len laew) &quot;Younger sister (just) ate tomatoes.&quot;
* อีน้องได้กินหมากเลนแล้ว (i nong dai kin mak len laew) &quot;Younger sister (definitely) ate tomatoes.&quot;

Present progressive: To indicate an ongoing action, กำลัง (kamlang) can be used before the verb or อยู่ (yu) after the verb. These can also be combined for emphasis. In Isan and Lao, พวม (phuam) /pʰua᷇m/ is often used instead of กำลัง.
* อีน้องกำลังกินหมากเลน (i nong kamlang kin mak len) &quot;Younger sister is eating tomatoes.&quot;
* อีน้องกินอยู่หมากเลน (i nong kin yu mak len) &quot;Younger sister is eating tomatoes.&quot;
* อีน้องพวมกินหมากเลน (i nong phuam kin mak len) &quot;Younger sister is eating tomatoes.&quot;

The verb &#x27;to be&#x27; can be expressed in many ways. In use as a copula, it is often dropped between nouns and adjectives. Compare English &quot;She is pretty&quot; and Isan สาวงาม (literally &quot;lady pretty&quot;). There are two copulas used in Isan, as in Lao, one for things relating to people, เป็น (pen) , and one for objects and animals, แม่น (maen) . 
* นกเป็นหมอ (Nok pen mo) &quot;Nok is a doctor.&quot;
* อันนี้แม่นสามล้อ (an ni maen sam lo) &quot;This is a pedicab.&quot;

===Questions and answers===
Unlike English, which indicates questions by a rising tone, or Spanish, which changes the order of the sentences to achieve the same result, Isan uses question-tag words. The use of question words makes use of the question mark (?) redundant in Isan.

General yes/no questions end in (same as บ่, &quot;no, not&quot;).
* สบายดีบ่ (sabai di bo) &quot;Are you well?&quot;

Other question words
* (changdai) or (yang) /ɲǎŋ/ เฮ็ดจั่งใด (het changdai) &quot;What are you doing?&quot;
* (phai) ใผขายไข่ไก่ (phai khai khai kai) &quot;Who sells chicken eggs?&quot;
* (sai) &quot;Where?&quot; ห้องน้ำอยู่ใส (hong nam yu sai) /hɔ̏ŋ nâːm júː sǎj/ &quot;Where is the toilet?&quot;
* (andai) &quot;Which?&quot; เจ้าได้กินอันใด (chao dai kin andai) &quot;Which one did you eat?&quot;
* (chak) &quot;How many?&quot; อายุจักปี (ayu chak pi) &quot;How old are you?&quot;
* (thodai) &quot;How much?&quot; ควายตัวบทท่อใด (khwai tua bot thodai) &quot;How much is that buffalo over there?&quot;
* แม่นบ่ (maen bo) &quot;Right?, Is it?&quot; เต่าไวแม่นบ่ (Tao vai maen bo) &quot;Turtles are fast, right?&quot;
* แล้วบ่ (laew bo) &quot;Yet?, Already?&quot; เขากลับบ้านแล้วบ่ (khao kap laew bo) &quot;Did he go home already?&quot;
* หรือบ่ (rue bo) &quot;Or not?&quot; เจ้าหิวข้าวหรือบ่ (chao hio khao rue bo) / &quot;Are you hungry or not?&quot;

Answers to questions usually just involve repetition of the verb and any nouns for clarification.
* Question: สบายดีบ่ (sabai di bo) &quot;Are you well?&quot;
* Response: สบายดี (sabai di) &quot;I am well&quot; or บ่สบาย (bo sabai) &quot;I am not well&quot;.

Words asked with a negative can be confusing and should be avoided. The response, even though without the negation, will still be negated due to the nature of the question.
* Question: บ่สบายบ่ (bo sabai bo) &quot;Are you not well?&quot;
* Response: สบาย (sabai) &quot;I am not well&quot; or บ่สบาย (bo sabai) &quot;I am well.&quot;

==Vocabulary==
Isan shares a large corpus of cognate, native vocabulary with other Tai languages of Thailand and Laos. They also share many common words and neologisms that were derived from Sanskrit, Pali, Mon and Khmer and other indigenous inhabitants to Indochina. However, there are traits that distinguish Isan both from Thai and its Lao parent language.

Isan is clearly differentiated from Thai by its Lao intonation and vocabulary. However, Isan differs from Lao in that the former has more English and Chinese loanwords, via Thai, not to mention large amounts of Thai influence. The Lao adopted French and Vietnamese loanwords as a legacy of French Indochina. Other differences between Isan and Lao include terminology that reflects the social and political separation since 1893 as well as differences in neologisms created after this. These differences, and a few very small deviations for certain common words, do not, however, diminish nor erase the Lao character of the language.


A small handful of lexical items are unique to Isan and not commonly found in standard Lao, but may exist in other Lao dialects. Some of these words exist alongside more typically Lao or Thai usages.
==Dialects==
Although Isan is treated separately from the Lao language of Laos due to its use of the Thai script, political sensitivity and the influence of the Thai language, dialectal isoglosses crisscross the Mekong River, mirroring the downstream migration of the Lao people as well as the settlement of Isan from the east to west, as people were forced to the right bank. Isan can be broken up into at least fourteen varieties, based on small differentiations in tonal quality and distribution as well as small lexical items, but these can be grouped into the same five dialectal regions of Laos. As a result of the movements, Isan varieties are often more similar to the Lao varieties spoken on the opposite banks of the Mekong than to other Isan people up- or downstream although Western Lao, formed from the merger of peoples from different Lao regions, does not occur in Laos and is only found in Isan.

Isan may have had historical leveling processes. The settlement of the region&#x27;s interior areas led to dialect mixing and the development of transitional areas. The Vientiane dialect also likely had a major role in bringing Isan varieties closer. The provinces of Loei, Nong Khai and Bueang Kan border areas of Laos where Vientiane Lao is spoken, and together with Nong Bua Lamphu and much of Udon Thani, were long settled by Lao speakers of these dialects from the time of Lan Xang as well as the Kingdom of Vientiane. The destruction of Vientiane and the forced movement of almost the entire population of the city and surrounding region after the Lao rebellion greatly increased the population of Isan, with these Lao people settled across the region.

==Writing systems==

===Tai Noi script===
The original writing system used for Isan was the &quot;Akson Thai Noi&quot; ( , cf. BGN/PCGN &quot;Akson Tai Noy&quot;), &#x27;Little Tai alphabet&#x27; or &quot;To Lao&quot; ( , cf. ), which in contemporary Isan and Lao would be &quot;Tua Lao&quot; ( and , respectively, or &#x27;Lao letters.&#x27; In Laos, the script is referred to in academic settings as the &quot;Akson Lao Deum&quot; ( , cf. RTGS &quot;Akson Lao Doem&quot;) or &#x27;Original Lao script.&#x27; The contemporary Lao script is a direct descendant and has preserved the basic letter shapes. The similarity between the modern Thai alphabet and the old and new Lao alphabets is because both scripts derived from a common ancestral Tai script of what is now northern Thailand which was an adaptation of the Khmer script, rounded by the influence of the Mon script, all of which are descendants of the Pallava script of southern India.

===Thai alphabet===
The ban on the &quot;Tai Noi&quot; script in the 1930s led to the adoption of writing in Thai with the Thai script. Very quickly, the Isan people adopted an &quot;ad hoc&quot; system of using the Thai script to record the spoken Isan language, using etymological spelling for cognate words but spelling Lao words not found in Thai, and with no known Khmer or Indic etymology, similarly to as they would be in the Lao script. This system remains in informal use today, often seen in letters, text messages, social media posts, lyrics to songs in the Isan language, transcription of Isan dialogue and personal notes.

===Tai Tham===
The &quot;Tai Tham&quot; script ( RTGS &quot;akson Thai Tham&quot;, cf. ) were also historically known simply as &quot;tua tham&quot; ( , cf. BGN/PCGN &quot;toua tham&quot;) or &#x27;dharma letters&#x27;. The script is the same as used to write Tai Lanna (Kham Mueang), Tai Lue, Tai Khoen and shares similarities with the Burmese alphabet, all of which are ultimately derived from the Old Mon script. &quot;Tai Tham&quot; was introduced during the reign of Setthathirath who although a prince of Lan Xang, was first crowned king of Lan Na. The dynastic union allowed easy movement of monks from Lan Xang that came to copy the temple libraries to bring back home.

As the name suggests, its use in Lao was restricted to religious literature, either used to transcribe Pali, or religious treatises written in Lao intended solely for the clergy. Religious instructional materials and prayer books dedicated to the laity were written in &quot;Tai Noi&quot; instead. As a result, only a few people outside the temples were literate in the script. In Isan, evidence of the script includes two stone inscriptions, such as the one housed at &quot;Wat Tham Suwannakhuha&quot; in Nong Bua Lamphu, dated to 1564, and another from &quot;Wat Mahaphon&quot; in Maha Sarakham from the same period. Most of the script is recorded on palm-leaf manuscripts, many of which were destroyed during the &#x27;Thaification&#x27; purges of the 1930s; contemporaneously this period of Thai nationalization also ended its use as the primary written language in Northern Thailand.

===Khom script===
The Khom script ( &quot;akson Khom&quot;, cf. Lao ອັກສອນຂອມ, &quot;Aksone Khom&quot;) was not generally used to write the ancient Lao language of Isan, but was often used to write Pali texts, or Brahmanic rituals often introduced via the Khmer culture. &quot;Khom&quot; is the ancient Tai word for the Khmer people, who once populated and ruled much of the area before Tai migration and the assimilation of the local people to Tai languages. It was generally not used to write the Lao language &quot;per se&quot;, but was often found in temple inscriptions, used in texts that preserve Brahmanic mantras and ceremonies, local mantras adopted for use in Tai animistic religion and other things usually concerned with Buddhism, Brahmanism or black magic, such as yantras and &quot;sakyan&quot; tattoos.

<doc id="501234" wikidata="Q4641686" url="?curid=501234" title="60th (2/2nd London) Division">
<text>The 60th (2/2nd London) Division was an infantry division of the British Army raised during World War I. It was the second line-formation of the 47th (1/2nd London) Division, and was the second of two such Territorial Force divisions formed from the surplus of London recruits in 1914.

The divisional insignia was a bee.

== Role ==
At first the division, headquartered at Sutton Veny, Wiltshire, merely supplied the first-line Territorial divisions with drafts to replace losses through casualties. In late 1915 the division began to be equipped for field operations although it was not sent to France until July 1916, after 88 trains had conveyed the men to Southampton from camps around Warminster, Heytesbury, and Codford stations.

Its engagements included the Third Battle of Gaza, the Battle of Beersheba (1917), the Battle of Jerusalem (1917), the Second Transjordan attack on Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt (1918), the Battle of Megiddo (1918), the Battle of Sharon, and the Battle of Nahr el Faliq.

As a &quot;lesser&quot; division it was sent to the minor fronts of Salonika and finally Palestine. In mid-1918, most of its British battalions were replaced with Indian battalions and sent to the Western Front, the division effectively becoming a British Indian Army division.

<text>The United States Intelligence Community (IC) is a group of separate U.S. federal government intelligence agencies and subordinate organizations that work both separately and collectively to conduct intelligence activities which support the foreign policy and national security interests of the United States. Member organizations of the IC include intelligence agencies, military intelligence, and civilian intelligence and analysis offices within federal executive departments.

The IC is overseen by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which is headed by the director of national intelligence (DNI) who reports directly to the president of the United States. The IC was established by Executive Order 12333 (&quot;United States Intelligence Activities&quot;), signed on December 4, 1981, by President Ronald Reagan. The statutory definition of the IC, including its roster of agencies, was codified as the Intelligence Organization Act of 1992 ().

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported in 2010 that there were 1,271 government organizations and 1,931 private companies in 10,000 locations in the United States that were working on counterterrorism, homeland security, and intelligence, and that the intelligence community as a whole would include 854,000 people holding top-secret clearances.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;Intelligence Community&quot; was first used during LTG Walter Bedell Smith&#x27;s tenure as Director of Central Intelligence (1950–1953).

==History==
Intelligence is information that agencies collect, analyze, and distribute in response to government leaders&#x27; questions and requirements. Intelligence is a broad term that may entail for example:

Collection, analysis, and production of sensitive information to support national security leaders, including policymakers, military commanders, and members of Congress. Safeguarding these processes and this information through counterintelligence activities. Execution of covert operations approved by the president. The IC strives to provide valuable insight on important issues by gathering raw intelligence, analyzing that data in context, and producing timely and relevant products for customers at all levels of national security—from the war-fighter on the ground to the president in Washington.

Executive Order 12333 charged the IC with six primary objectives:

* Collection of information needed by the president, the National Security Council, the secretary of state, the secretary of defense, and other executive branch officials for the performance of their duties and responsibilities;
* Production and dissemination of intelligence;
* Collection of information concerning, and the conduct of activities to protect against, intelligence activities directed against the U.S., international terrorist and/or narcotics activities, and other hostile activities directed against the U.S. by foreign powers, organizations, persons and their agents;
* Special activities (defined as activities conducted in support of U.S. foreign policy objectives abroad which are planned and executed so that the &quot;role of the United States Government is not apparent or acknowledged publicly&quot;, and functions in support of such activities, but which are not intended to influence United States political processes, public opinion, policies, or media and do not include diplomatic activities or the collection and production of intelligence or related support functions);
* Administrative and support activities within the United States and abroad necessary for the performance of authorized activities and
* Such other intelligence activities as the president may direct from time to time.
Before the CIA&#x27;s establishment, several military intelligence agencies, and the FBI to a limited extent, fulfilled its role.

==Organization==

The IC is headed by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), whose statutory leadership is exercised through the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). The other members of the IC are:

===List of members===
===Notes===
===Programs===
The IC performs under two separate programs:
* The National Intelligence Program (NIP), formerly known as the National Foreign Intelligence Program as defined by the National Security Act of 1947 (as amended), &quot;refers to all programs, projects, and activities of the intelligence community, as well as any other programs of the intelligence community designated jointly by the director of national intelligence (DNI) and the head of a United States department or agency or by the president. Such term does not include programs, projects, or activities of the military departments to acquire intelligence solely for the planning and conduct of tactical military operations by the United States Armed Forces&quot;. Under the law, the DNI is responsible for directing and overseeing the NIP, though the ability to do so is limited (see the Organization structure and leadership section).
* The Military Intelligence Program (MIP) refers to the programs, projects, or activities of the military departments to acquire intelligence solely for the planning and conduct of tactical military operations by the United States Armed Forces. The MIP is directed and controlled by the under secretary of defense for intelligence. In 2005 the Department of Defense combined the Joint Military Intelligence Program and the Tactical Intelligence and Related Activities program to form the MIP.

Since the definitions of the NIP and MIP overlap when they address military intelligence, the assignment of intelligence activities to the NIP and MIP sometimes proves problematic.

=== Organizational structure and leadership ===

The overall organization of the IC is primarily governed by the National Security Act of 1947 (as amended) and . The statutory organizational relationships were substantially revised with the 2004 Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA) amendments to the 1947 National Security Act.

Though the IC characterizes itself as a federation of its member elements, its overall structure is better characterized as a confederation due to its lack of a well-defined, unified leadership and governance structure. Prior to 2004, the director of Central Intelligence (DCI) was the head of the IC, in addition to being the director of the CIA. A major criticism of this arrangement was that the DCI had little or no actual authority over the budgetary authorities of the other IC agencies and therefore had limited influence over their operations.

Following the passage of IRTPA in 2004, the head of the IC is the director of national intelligence (DNI). The DNI exerts leadership of the IC primarily through statutory authorities under which he or she:
* develops and executes the National Intelligence Program budget;
* establishes objectives, priorities, and guidance for the IC; and
* manages and directs the tasking of, collection, analysis, production, and dissemination of national intelligence by elements of the IC.

Despite these responsibilities, the DNI has no authority to direct and control any element of the IC except his own staff—the Office of the DNI—nor does the DNI have the authority to hire or fire personnel in the IC except those on his or her own staff. The member elements in the executive branch are directed and controlled by their respective department heads, all cabinet-level officials reporting to the president. By law, only the director of the Central Intelligence Agency reports to the DNI.

In light of major intelligence failures in recent years that called into question how well Intelligence Community ensures U.S. national security, particularly those identified by the 9/11 Commission (National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States), and the &quot;WMD Commission&quot; (Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction), the authorities and powers of the DNI and the overall organizational structure of the IC have become subject of intense debate in the United States.

===Interagency cooperation===
Previously, interagency cooperation and the flow of information among the member agencies was hindered by policies that sought to limit the pooling of information out of privacy and security concerns. Attempts to modernize and facilitate interagency cooperation within the IC include technological, structural, procedural, and cultural dimensions. Examples include the Intellipedia wiki of encyclopedic security-related information; the creation of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, National Intelligence Centers, Program Manager Information Sharing Environment, and Information Sharing Council; legal and policy frameworks set by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, information sharing and Executive Order 13388, and the 2005 National Intelligence Strategy.

===Budget===
The United States intelligence budget (excluding the Military Intelligence Program) in fiscal year 2022 was appropriated as $65.7 billion, an increase of $3.4 billion from the $62.3 billion requested and up from $60.8 billion in fiscal year 2021. The total budget of the National Intelligence Program has been public since 2007, due to the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007, which required them to disclose the &quot;aggregate amount of funds appropriated by Congress” for the NIP within 30 days of the end of the fiscal year. The requested budget of the NIP has been public since 2011 due to a requirement enacted by Congress in Section 364 of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010.

About 70 percent of the intelligence budget went to contractors for the procurement of technology and services (including analysis), according to the May 2007 chart from the ODNI. Intelligence spending has increased by a third over ten years ago, in inflation-adjusted dollars, according to the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments.

In a statement on the release of new declassified figures, DNI Mike McConnell said there would be no additional disclosures of classified budget information beyond the overall spending figure because &quot;such disclosures could harm national security&quot;. How the money is divided among the 16 intelligence agencies and what it is spent on is classified. It includes salaries for about 100,000 people, multi billion-dollar satellite programs, aircraft, weapons, electronic sensors, intelligence analysis, spies, computers, and software.

On August 29, 2013 &quot;The Washington Post&quot; published the summary of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence&#x27;s multivolume FY 2013 Congressional Budget Justification, the U.S. Intelligence Community&#x27;s top-secret &quot;black budget&quot;. The IC&#x27;s FY 2013 budget details how the 16 spy agencies use the money and how it performs against the goals set by the president and Congress. Experts said that access to such details about U.S. spy programs is without precedent. Steven Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists, which provides analyses of national security issues, stated that &quot;It was a titanic struggle just to get the top-line budget number disclosed, and that has only been done consistently since 2007 ... but a real grasp of the structure and operations of the intelligence bureaucracy has been totally beyond public reach. This kind of material, even on a historical basis, has simply not been available.&quot; Access to budget details will enable an informed public debate on intelligence spending for the first time, said the co-chair of the 9/11 Commission Lee H. Hamilton. He added that Americans should not be excluded from the budget process because the intelligence community has a profound impact on the life of ordinary Americans.

===Oversight===
Intelligence Community Oversight duties are distributed to both the executive and legislative branches. Primary executive oversight is performed by the President&#x27;s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, the Joint Intelligence Community Council, the Office of the Inspector General, and the Office of Management and Budget. Primary congressional oversight jurisdiction over the IC is assigned to two committees: the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. The House Armed Services Committee and Senate Armed Services Committee draft bills to annually authorize the budgets of DoD intelligence activities, and both the House and Senate appropriations committees annually draft bills to appropriate the budgets of the IC. The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs took a leading role in formulating the intelligence reform legislation in the 108th Congress.

<doc id="501250" wikidata="Q1215575" url="?curid=501250" title="Naproxen">
<text>Naproxen, sold under the brand name Aleve among others, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to treat pain, menstrual cramps, and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, gout and fever. It is taken orally. It is available in immediate and delayed release formulations. Onset of effects is within an hour and lasts for up to twelve hours. Naproxen is also available in salt form, naproxen sodium, which has better solubility when taken orally.
Common side effects include dizziness, headache, bruising, allergic reactions, heartburn, and stomach pain. Severe side effects include an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding, and stomach ulcers. The heart disease risk may be lower than with other NSAIDs. It is not recommended in people with kidney problems. Use is not recommended in the third trimester of pregnancy.
Naproxen is a nonselective COX inhibitor. As an NSAID, naproxen appears to exert its anti-inflammatory action by reducing the production of inflammatory mediators called prostaglandins. It is metabolized by the liver to inactive metabolites.
Naproxen was patented in 1967 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1976. In the United States it is available over-the-counter and as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 88th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 7million prescriptions.

== Medical uses ==
Naproxen&#x27;s medical uses are related to its mechanism of action as an anti-inflammatory compound. Naproxen is used to treat a variety of inflammatory conditions and symptoms that are due to excessive inflammation, such as pain and fever (naproxen has fever-reducing, or antipyretic, properties in addition to its anti-inflammatory activity). Naproxen&#x27;s anti-inflammatory properties may relieve pain caused by inflammatory conditions such as migraine, osteoarthritis, kidney stones, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, gout, ankylosing spondylitis, menstrual cramps, tendinitis, and bursitis. Naproxen has also proven effective for acute post-operative pain.

Naproxen sodium is used as a &quot;bridge therapy&quot; in medication-overuse headache to slowly take patients off other medications.

===Available formulations===
Naproxen sodium is available as both an immediate-release and an extended-release tablet. The extended-release formulations (sometimes called &quot;sustained release&quot;, or &quot;enteric coated&quot;) take longer to take effect than the immediate-release formulations and therefore are less useful when immediate pain relief is desired. Extended-release formulations are more useful for the treatment of chronic, or long-lasting, conditions, in which long-term pain relief is desirable.

===Pregnancy and lactation===
As with all non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs), naproxen use should be avoided in pregnancy due to the importance of prostaglandins in vascular and renal function in the fetus. NSAIDs should especially be avoided in the third trimester. Small amounts of naproxen are excreted in breast milk. However, adverse effects are uncommon in infants breastfed from a mother taking naproxen.

==Adverse effects==
Common adverse effects include dizziness, drowsiness, headache, rash, bruising, and gastrointestinal upset. Heavy use is associated with an increased risk of end-stage renal disease and kidney failure. Naproxen may cause muscle cramps in the legs in 3% of people.

In October 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the drug label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid. They recommend avoiding NSAIDs in pregnant women at 20 weeks or later in pregnancy.

===Gastrointestinal===
As with other non-COX-2 selective NSAIDs, naproxen can cause gastrointestinal problems, such as heartburn, constipation, diarrhea, ulcers and stomach bleeding. Naproxen should be taken orally with, or just after food, to decrease the risk of gastrointestinal side effects. Persons with a history of ulcers or inflammatory bowel disease should consult a doctor before taking naproxen. In U.S. markets, naproxen is sold with boxed warnings about the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration or bleeding. Naproxen poses an intermediate risk of stomach ulcers compared with ibuprofen, which is low-risk, and indometacin, which is high-risk. To reduce stomach ulceration risk, it is often combined with a proton-pump inhibitor (a medication that reduces stomach acid production) during long-term treatment of those with pre-existing stomach ulcers or a history of developing stomach ulcers while on NSAIDs.

===Cardiovascular===
COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs have been linked to increases in the number of serious and potentially fatal cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarctions and strokes. Naproxen is, however, associated with the smallest overall cardiovascular risks. Cardiovascular risk must be considered when prescribing any nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. The drug had roughly 50% of the associated risk of stroke compared with ibuprofen and was also associated with a reduced number of myocardial infarctions compared with control groups.

A study found that high-dose naproxen induced near-complete suppression of platelet thromboxane throughout the dosing interval and appeared not to increase cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, whereas other non-aspirin high-dose NSAID regimens had only transient effects on platelet COX-1 and were associated with a small but definite vascular hazard. Conversely, naproxen was associated with higher rates of upper gastrointestinal bleeding complications compared with other NSAIDs.

== Interactions ==

===Drug–drug interactions===
Naproxen may interact with antidepressants, lithium, methotrexate, probenecid, warfarin and other blood thinners, heart or blood pressure medications, including diuretics, or steroid medicines such as prednisone.

NSAIDs such as naproxen may interfere with and reduce the efficacy of SSRI antidepressants, as well as increase the risk of bleeding greater than the individual bleeding risk of either class of agent, when taken together. Naproxen is not contraindicated in the presence of SSRIs, though concomitant use of the medications should be done with caution. Alcohol consumption increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding when combined with NSAIDs like naproxen in a dose-dependent manner (that is, the higher the dose of naproxen, the higher the risk of bleeding). The risk is highest for people who are heavy drinkers.

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===
Naproxen works by reversibly inhibiting both the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes as a non-selective coxib.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
Naproxen is a minor substrate of CYP1A2 and CYP2C9. It is extensively metabolized in the liver to 6-O-desmethylnaproxen, and both the parent drug and the desmethyl metabolite undergo further metabolism to their respective acylglucuronide conjugated metabolites. An analysis of two clinical trials shows that naproxen&#x27;s time to peak plasma concentration occurs between 2 and 4 hours after oral administration, though naproxen sodium reaches peak plasma concentrations within 1–2 hours.

=== Pharmacogenetics ===
The pharmacogenetics of naproxen has been studied to better understand its adverse effects. In 1998, a small pharmacokinetic (PK) study failed to show that differences in a patient&#x27;s ability to clear naproxen from the body could account for differences in a patient&#x27;s risk of experiencing the adverse effect of a serious gastrointestinal bleed while taking naproxen. However, the study failed to account for differences in the activity of CYP2C9, a drug-metabolizing enzyme that is necessary for clearing naproxen. Studies on the relationship between CYP2C9 genotype and NSAID-induced gastrointestinal bleeds have shown that genetic variants in CYP2C9 that reduce the clearance of major CYP2C9 substrates (like naproxen) increase the risk of NSAID-induced gastrointestinal bleeds, especially for homozygous defective variants.

== Chemistry ==
Naproxen is a member of the 2-arylpropionic acid (profen) family of NSAIDs. The free acid is an odorless, white to off-white crystalline substance. Naproxen free base is lipid-soluble and practically insoluble in water, while naproxen sodium and many other salts are freely soluble in water, often soluble in methanol, and sparingly soluble in alcohol; check the specific solubility of each salt before use. Naproxen has a melting point of 152–155 °C, while naproxen salts tend to have higher melting points.

===Synthesis===
Naproxen has been industrially produced by Syntex starting from 2-naphthol as follows:

==Society and culture==
===Brand names ===
Naproxen and naproxen sodium are marketed under various brand names, including Accord, Aleve, Anaprox, Antalgin, Apranax, Feminax Ultra, Flanax, Inza, Maxidol, Nalgesin, Naposin, Naprelan, Naprogesic, Naprosyn, Narocin, Pronaxen, Proxen, Soproxen, and Xenifar. It is also available as the combination naproxen/esomeprazole magnesium in delayed-release tablets under the brand name Vimovo.

=== Access restrictions ===
Syntex first marketed naproxen in 1976, as the prescription drug Naprosyn. They first marketed naproxen sodium under the brand name Anaprox in 1980. It remains a prescription-only drug in much of the world. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved it as an over-the-counter (OTC) drug in 1994. OTC preparations of naproxen in the U.S. are mainly marketed by Bayer HealthCare under the brand name Aleve and generic store brand formulations in 220mg tablets. In Australia, packets of 275mg tablets of naproxen sodium are Schedule 2 pharmacy medicines, with a maximum daily dose of five tablets or 1375mg. In the United Kingdom, 250mg tablets of naproxen were approved for OTC sale under the brand name Feminax Ultra in 2008, for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea in women aged 15 to 50. In the Netherlands, 220mg and 275mg tablets are available OTC in drugstores, 550mg is OTC only at pharmacies. Aleve became available over the counter in some provinces in Canada on 14 July 2009, but not British Columbia, Quebec or Newfoundland and Labrador; it subsequently became available OTC in British Columbia in January 2010.

==Ecological effects==
Naproxen has been found in groundwater and drinking water in concentrations high enough to have adverse effects on invertebrates including fungi, algae, bacteria and . Naproxen is not thoroughly removed by conventional water treatment methods, and its degradation pathways in the environment are limited. Some methods more successfully remove naproxen from wastewater, including metal-organic complexes and porous carbon. Although the levels are generally low enough to not be acutely toxic, sub-lethal effects may still occur, such as reduced photosynthetic ability.

==Research==
Naproxen may have antiviral activity against influenza. In laboratory research, it blocks the RNA-binding groove of the nucleoprotein of the virus, preventing the formation of the ribonucleoprotein complex—thus taking the viral nucleoproteins out of circulation.

==Veterinary use==
===Horses===
Naproxen is given by mouth to horses at a dose of 10mg/kg and has shown to have a wide safety margin (no toxicity when given at three times the recommended dose for 42 days). It is more effective for myositis than the commonly used NSAID phenylbutazone, and has shown especially good results for treatment of equine exertional rhabdomyolysis, a disease of muscle breakdown; it is less commonly used for musculoskeletal disease.

<doc id="501257" wikidata="Q3201662" url="?curid=501257" title="L'Aiglon">
<text>L&#x27;Aiglon is a play in six acts by Edmond Rostand based on the life of Napoleon II, who was the son of Emperor Napoleon I and his second wife, Empress Marie Louise. The title of the play comes from a nickname for Napoleon II, the French word for &quot;eaglet&quot; (a young eagle).

The title role was created by Sarah Bernhardt in the play&#x27;s premiere on 15 March 1900 at the Théàtre Sarah Bernhardt. 
Fashion designer Jacques Doucet designed her famous white costume. 

In October of the same year, the play (in an English translation by Louis N. Parker) premiered at New York&#x27;s Knickerbocker Theatre, with Maude Adams in the title role.

Its first performance in London was at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in 1901, with Bernhardt again playing the leading role. Rostand had written &quot;L&#x27;Aiglon&quot; specifically for Bernhardt, and it became one of her signature roles.

Clemence Dane made an English translation which was broadcast by the BBC on National Radio in 15 November 1936 and regionally the following day. Marius Goring performed the leading role in this production.

Arthur Honegger and Jacques Ibert composed an opera in five acts, also with the title &quot;L&#x27;Aiglon&quot;, to a libretto by Henri Cain, based on Rostand&#x27;s play. It was first performed at the Opéra de Monte-Carlo in 1937.

<text>In association football, the referee is the person responsible for interpreting and enforcing the Laws of the Game during a match. The referee is the final decision-making authority on all facts connected with play, and is the match official with the authority to start and stop play and impose disciplinary action against players and coaches during a match.

At most levels of play, the referee is assisted by two assistant referees (formerly known as linesmen), who advise the referee on whether the ball leaves the playing area and any infringements of the Laws of the Game occurring outside of the view of the referee. The final decision on any decision of fact rests with the referee, who has authority to overrule an assistant referee. At higher levels of play, the referee may also be assisted by a fourth official who supervises the teams&#x27; technical areas and assists the referee with administrative tasks, and, at the very highest levels, additional assistant referees and/or video assistant referees. Referees and other game officials are licensed and trained by its member national organisations.

==Powers and duties==
The referee&#x27;s powers and duties are described by Law 5 of the Laws of the Game. The referee:

:Overall
:*enforces the Laws of the Game
:*controls the match in cooperation with the other match officials
:*acts as timekeeper, keeps a record of the match and provides the appropriate authorities with a match report, including information on disciplinary action and any other incidents that occurred before, during or after the match
:*supervises and/or indicates the restart of play

:Advantage
:*allows play to continue when an offence occurs and the non-offending team will benefit from the advantage, and penalises the offence if the anticipated advantage does not ensue at that time or within a few seconds
:Disciplinary action
:*punishes the more serious offence, in terms of sanction, restart, physical severity and tactical impact, when more than one offence occurs at the same time
:*takes disciplinary action against players guilty of cautionable and sending-off offences
:*has the authority to take disciplinary action from entering the field of play for the pre-match inspection until leaving the field of play after the match ends (including kicks from the penalty mark). If, before entering the field of play at the start of the match, a player commits a sending-off offence, the referee has the authority to prevent the player taking part in the match (see Law 3.6); the referee will report any other misconduct
:*has the power to show yellow or red cards and, where competition rules permit, temporarily dismiss a player, from entering the field of play at the start of the match until after the match has ended, including during the half-time interval, extra time and kicks from the penalty mark
:*takes action against team officials who fail to act in a responsible manner and warns or shows a yellow card for a caution or a red card for a sending-off from the field of play and its immediate surrounds, including the technical area; if the offender cannot be identified, the senior coach present in the technical area will receive the sanction. A medical team official who commits a sending-off offence may remain if the team has no other medical person available, and act if a player needs medical attention
:*acts on the advice of other match officials regarding incidents that the referee has not seen

As well as other various duties and powers described fully in Law 5 of the Laws of the Game, pursuant to current updates.

== Regulation ==
Referees and assistant referees are regulated at a national level. FIFA requires that each national organisation establish a referees committee composed of former officials that has authority over refereeing in that territory. FIFA also mandate that referees pass tests to show sufficient physical fitness and knowledge of the Laws of the Game, as well as an annual medical. Generally, referees are required to have greater experience to officiate higher level matches (see, for example, the multiple tiers of refereeing in England). The most elite officials, those who are permitted to officiate international games, are listed on the FIFA International Referees List.

==Kit and equipment==

Referees wear a kit distinguishing themselves from the players. Usually this comprises a shirt of a different colour to the players of both teams. 

In the early 20th century, referees wore a blazer, but later this was changed to a shirt similar to that worn by the players. Traditionally, referees almost always wore all black, unless one of the teams was wearing a very dark shirt in which case the referee would wear another colour (usually red) to distinguish themself from both teams. 

At the 1994 World Cup finals, new shirts were introduced that gave officials a choice of burgundy, yellow or white, and at the same time the creation of the Premier League in England saw referees wear green jerseys: both changes were motivated by television considerations. Since then, most referees have worn either yellow or black, but the colours and styles adopted by individual associations vary greatly. For international contests under the supervision of FIFA, Adidas uniforms are worn because Adidas is the current sponsor. FIFA allows referees to wear five colours: black, red, yellow, green and blue. Along with the jersey, referees are required to wear black shorts, black socks (with white stripes in some cases), and black shoes. The badge, which displays the referee&#x27;s license level and year of validity, is often affixed to the left chest pocket.

All referees carry a whistle, a watch, penalty cards, a data wallet with pen and paper, and a coin for determining which team has the choice of ends or kick-off. Most are encouraged to have more than one of each on them in case they drop a whistle or a pen runs out and so on. Often, referees use two watches so that they can use one to calculate time lost for stoppages for the purposes of added time. At the highest levels, referees wear a full duplex radio with customised headset to communicate between with their assistants, and assistant referees use electronic flags, which send a signal to the referee when a button is pushed. In matches with goal-line technology, referees will have on their person a device to receive the system&#x27;s alerts.

===Whistle===
Referees use a whistle to help them control matches. The whistle is sometimes needed to stop, start or restart play but should not be used for all stoppages, starts or restarts. FIFA&#x27;s Laws of the Game document gives guidance as to when the whistle should and should not be used. Overuse of the whistle is discouraged since, as stated in the Laws, &quot;A whistle which is used too frequently unnecessarily will have less impact when it is needed.&quot; The whistle is an important tool for the referee along with verbal, body and eye communication.

Before the introduction of the whistle, referees indicated their decisions by waving a white handkerchief. The whistles that were first adopted by referees were made by Joseph Hudson at Mills Munitions in Birmingham, England. The Acme Whistle Company (based at Mills Munitions Factory) first began to mass-produce pea whistles in the 1870s for the Metropolitan Police Force. It is frequently stated the referee&#x27;s whistle was first used in a game between Nottingham Forest and Sheffield Norfolk in 1878; however the last such fixture known to have taken place between the two clubs was in 1874. The Nottingham Forest account book of 1872 apparently recorded the purchase of an &quot;umpire&#x27;s whistle&quot; and in 1928 an article by R M Ruck about his playing days in the early 1870s referred to the use of a whistle by umpires to indicate an infringement.

The whistle was not mentioned in the Laws of the Game until 1936 when an IFAB Decision was added as footnote (b) to Law 2, stating &quot;A Referee&#x27;s control over the players for misconduct or ungentlemanly behaviour commences from the time he enters the field of play, but his jurisdiction in connection with the Laws of the Game commences from the time he blows his whistle for the game to start.&quot;

In 2007, when IFAB greatly expanded the Laws of the Game, an Additional Instructions section became available, which is a full page of advice on how and when the whistle should be used as a communication and control mechanism by the referee.

==History==
Referees in football were first described by Richard Mulcaster in 1581. In this description of &quot;foteball&quot; he advocates the use of a &quot;judge over the parties&quot;. In the modern era, referees are first advocated in English public school football games, notably Eton football in 1845. A match report from Rochdale in 1842 shows their use in a football game between the Bodyguards Club and the Fearnought Club.

In the early years of the codified sport it was assumed that disputes could be adequately settled by discussion between gentlemen players who would never deliberately commit a foul. However, as play became more competitive, the need for officials grew. Initially there existed two umpires, one per team, who could be appealed to with the referee (the game&#x27;s timekeeper) being &quot;referred&quot; to if the umpires could not agree.

The promotion of referees to the dominant position they occupy today, and the reformation of umpires into the linesmen role, occurred as part of a major restructuring of the laws in 1891.

==Positioning and responsibilities==

The predominant system of positioning and division of responsibility used by football match officials throughout the world is known as the &quot;Diagonal system of control (DSC)&quot;.

The referee has final decision-making authority on all matters. The referee is assisted by two assistant referees who advise the referee. An assistant referee&#x27;s judgement is enforced only if the referee accepts that judgement, and the referee has the authority to unilaterally overrule an assistant referee. The referee is the only official empowered with starting and stopping play, and meting out disciplinary actions such as cautions or send-offs.

The two assistant referees are instructed by the referee to each patrol half of a single touchline on opposite sides of the field. For example, on a field running north–south, one assistant referee (AR) would run on the eastern touchline from the north goal line to the halfway line, while the other assistant referee would run on the western touchline from the south goal line to the halfway line. In general, the assistant referees&#x27; duties would be to indicate (using their flags) when an offside offence has occurred in their half, when a ball has left the pitch, and if a foul has been executed out of the view of the referee (typically in their quadrant of the field). Generally, the ARs will position themselves in line with either the second to last opponent or the ball – whichever is closer to the goal line – to better judge offside infractions. However, the assistant referee will have specific positioning with respect to corner kicks, penalty kicks, and throw-ins.

The referee patrols the length of the field to cover the ground not covered by their two assistants, generally running in a diagonal pattern from the southeast quadrant of the field towards the northwest quadrant; hence the term &quot;diagonal system of control&quot; (DSC). This pattern is not a specific route but a general guideline that should be modified to the style of play, nature of the game, the location of play at a given time, etc. In some cases the referee may even exit the field if it aids in their decision-making ability. The main idea is that the referee and assistants using the DSC should be able to position themselves quickly and easily to observe the important aspects of play (offside, ball in or out of play, goal-scoring opportunities, challenges for the ball) from multiple angles with multiple sets of eyes.

The description above refers to a left diagonal system of control, known as &quot;running a left&quot; or &quot;standard diagonal&quot;. If, before the match, the centre referee on this field decides to run from southwest to northeast, then the assistants must position themselves accordingly and the result will be a right diagonal system of control, otherwise referred to as &quot;running a right&quot; or &quot;reverse diagonal&quot;.

In many cases in England, referees use more of &quot;curve&quot; based on a line running from the edge of the box, and when near the centre circle they then curve to a line level with the other box line. This is similar to the diagonal system, but with the speed of modern football it is easier to keep up with play. This also helps the referee avoid being in a common &quot;passing lane&quot; through the centre circle itself.

In international matches the left-wing diagonal shown above has been universal since the 1960s. It is now predominant across the world. England until recently was an exception to this convention. Until 1974 referees in the Football League were required to run both diagonals during a match, most opting to run from right wing to right wing in the first half before switching to the left-wing diagonal for the second half. The chief reason for this alternation was to avoid linesmen wearing down the same part of the touchline during matches – this was important given the generally lower quality of pitches at the time. However switching diagonal was also justified in terms of allowing officials to patrol different areas of the field during games. From the 1974–75 season English referees were allowed to run the same diagonal throughout the same match. Most initially opted for the right-wing diagonal although over the years the left-wing diagonal became increasingly popular and the preferred choice of most referees by the early 2000s. From 2007–08 the left-wing diagonal has been mandatory in English professional football although some referees at lower levels still use the opposite approach.

Its implementation as a standard practice for referees is attributed to Sir Stanley Rous, former referee and President of FIFA from 1961 to 1974.

==Other systems of control==
While the Laws of the Game mandate a single referee with assistants as described above, other systems are used experimentally or explicitly by some non-FIFA-affiliated governing organizations.

===Dual system (two referees)===
The &quot;dual system&quot;, has two referees with no assistants. The system is used some matches played under the rules of the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) in the United States, and in other youth or amateur matches. Both referees have equal authority, and the decision of one referee is binding on the other. Each referee is primarily responsible for a specific area of the field similar to those of the assistant referees in the diagonal system, except that the referees are allowed and encouraged to move away from the touch line into the field, particularly as play approaches the goal lines. Like the assistant referees in the diagonal system, each referee is responsible for patrolling one touch line and one goal line and determining possession for the restart if the ball goes out of play on either of those two boundaries.

Positioning in the dual system is similar to that used by officials in basketball: each referee is either termed the &quot;lead&quot; or the &quot;trail&quot;, depending on the direction of the attack. If the attack is against the goal to the referee&#x27;s right (when facing the field from their assigned touch line), then that referee is the lead, and the other is the trail. The lead is positioned ahead of the play, even with the second-to-last defender to the extent possible, while the trail is positioned behind the play. Both are responsible for calling fouls and misconduct and determining the restart when the ball goes out of play on one of their assigned boundary lines. Since the lead is in a better position to determine offside, the lead is responsible for calling offside, while the trail provides an extra monitor for fouls and misconduct while the lead&#x27;s attention is focused on offside. When the attack changes direction, the trail becomes the lead and vice versa.

===Double dual system (3 referees)===
The double dual system uses three referees, all equipped with whistles, positioned much as in the traditional diagonal system of control mandated by IFAB. Each referee has the same authority for decision making. It is authorized in the United States for college and high school matches although it is rarely used.

<text>Magrath is a town in Cardston County, Alberta, Canada. Its population was 2,481 in 2021. Magrath is (approximately 25 minutes) south of Lethbridge and (approximately 2.5 hours) south of Calgary.

== History ==

Magrath was established in 1899 by settlers sent by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from Utah and Idaho. These Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints settlers were recruited by the Alberta Railway and Irrigation Company to construct irrigation works in the area funded by British interests by the family of Sir Alexander Galt. The settlers were paid in cash and land in the town. This was the first major irrigation work in Canada and was made possible by the settlers&#x27; experience with the extensive irrigation projects undertaken by their church in Utah and Idaho.

The irrigation system was completed in November 1899 and spanned ninety-miles. It was the first large-scale irrigation system in Canada. The area&#x27;s irrigation canal system supplies water to farmers throughout Southern Alberta and was the first major irrigation project in Canada. In its early years Magrath was known as The Irrigation Capital of Canada, and later as &quot;The Garden City&quot; for its beautiful natural setting and plentiful trees. The design and layout of Magrath was based on the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints &#x27;Plat of Zion&#x27; urban design model. Magrath also has historical links to the internationally recognized British Garden City tradition which was piloted in England during this same period.

Magrath was named after Charles Alexander Magrath, the son-in-law of Sir Alexander Galt. Magrath post office was established 1 March 1900, with Ammon Mercer as first postmaster.

<text>In sociology, the post-industrial society is the stage of society&#x27;s development when the service sector generates more wealth than the manufacturing sector of the economy.

The term was originated by Alain Touraine and is closely related to similar sociological theoretical concepts such as post-Fordism, information society, knowledge economy, post-industrial economy, liquid modernity, and network society. They all can be used in economics or social science disciplines as a general theoretical backdrop in research design.

As the term has been used, a few common themes, including the ones below have begun to emerge.

# The economy undergoes a transition from the production of goods to the provision of services.
# Knowledge becomes a valued form of capital; see Human capital.
# Producing ideas is the main way to grow the economy.
# Through processes of globalization and automation, the value and importance to the economy of blue-collar, unionized work, including manual labor (e.g., assembly-line work) decline, and those of professional workers (e.g., scientists, creative-industry professionals, and IT professionals) grow in value and prevalence.
# Behavioral and information sciences and technologies are developed and implemented (e.g., behavioral economics, information architecture, cybernetics, game theory and information theory).

==Origins==
Daniel Bell popularized the term through his 1974 work &quot;The Coming of Post-Industrial Society&quot;. Although some have credited Bell with coining the term, French sociologist Alain Touraine published in 1969 the first major work on the post-industrial society. The term was also used extensively by social philosopher Ivan Illich in his 1973 paper &quot;Tools for Conviviality&quot; and appears occasionally in Leftist texts throughout the mid-to-late 1960s.

The term has grown and changed as it became mainstream. The term is now used by marketers such as Seth Godin, public policy PhDs such as Keith Boeckelman, and sociologists such as Neil Fligstein and Ofer Sharone. U.S. President Bill Clinton used the term to describe Chinese growth in a round-table discussion in Shanghai in 1998.

==Valuation of knowledge==
The post-industrialized society is marked by an increased valuation of knowledge. This itself is unsurprising, having been foreshadowed in Daniel Bell&#x27;s presumption as to how economic employment patterns will evolve in such societies. He asserts employment will grow faster in the tertiary (and quaternary) sector relative to employment in the primary and secondary sector and that the tertiary (and quaternary) sectors will take precedence in the economy. This will continue to occur such that the &quot;impact of the expert&quot; will expand and power will be monopolized by knowledge.

As tertiary and quaternary sector positions are essentially knowledge-oriented, this will result in a restructuring of education, at least in its nuances. The &quot;new power… of the expert&quot; consequently gives rise to the growing role of universities and research institutes in post-industrial societies. Post-industrial societies themselves become oriented around these places of knowledge production and production of experts as their new foci. Consequently, the greatest beneficiaries in the post-industrial society are young urban professionals. As a new, educated, and politicized generation, more impassioned by liberalism, social justice, and environmentalism, comes into being; the shift of power into their hands, as a result of their knowledge endowments, is often cited as a good thing.

The increasing importance of knowledge in post-industrial societies results in a general increase in expertise through the economy and throughout society. In this manner, it eliminates what Alan Banks and Jim Foster identify as &quot;undesirable work as well as the grosser forms of poverty and inequality&quot;. This effect is supplemented by the aforementioned movement of power into the hands of young educated people concerned with social justice.

Economists at Berkeley have studied the value of knowledge as a form of capital, adding value to material capital, such as a factory or a truck. Speaking along the same lines of their argument, the addition or &#x27;production&#x27; of knowledge, could become the basis of what would undoubtedly be considered &#x27;post-industrial&#x27; policies meant to deliver economic growth.

The valuation of specifically scientific knowledge and technology can paradoxically be devalued by individuals in a post-industrial society as they still expect its benefits but are more sensitized to moral trade-offs and risks.

==Creativity culture==
Similarly, post-industrial society has serviced the creative culture. Many of those most well-equipped to thrive in an increasingly technological society are young adults with tertiary education. As education itself becomes more and more oriented towards producing people capable of answering the need for self-actualization, creativity, and self-expression, successive generations become more endowed with the ability to contribute to and perpetuate such industries. This change in education, as well among the emerging class of young professionals, is initiated by what James D Wright identifies as an &quot;unprecedented economic affluence and the satiation of basic material needs&quot;. Ellen Dunham-Jones as well observes this feature of post-industrial society where &quot;abundant goods [are] equitably distributed [in order that] laborless leisure and self-determination&quot; can be consumed.

The post-industrial society is stressed to be one where knowledge is power and technology is the instrument. Naturally, where one is creatively inclined, they are advantaged by such a society. The doctrine of &quot;speed, mobility, and malleability&quot; is well suited to a dynamic creative industry and as industries of good production decrease in precedence, the way is paved for artists, musicians, and other such types, whose skills are better used by the tertiary and quaternary sector. Urban geographer Trevor Barnes, in his work outlining the Vancouver experience in post-war development, evokes the post-industrial condition, citing the emergence and consolidation of a significant video games industry as a constituent of the elite service sector.

This increased faculty of the post-industrialist society with respects to the creative industry is reflected by the economic history of post-industrial societies. As economic activities shift from primarily primary and secondary sector-based to tertiary, and later quaternary, sector-based, cities in which this shift occurs become more open to exchanges of information. This is necessitated by the demands of a tertiary and quaternary sector: in order to better service an industry focused on finance, education, communication, management, training, engineering, and aesthetic design, the city must become points of exchange capable of providing the most updated information from across the globe. Conversely, as cities become a convergence of international ideas, the tertiary and quaternary sector can be expected to grow.

A cult of &#x27;creatives&#x27; have sprung up embodying and often describing and defending the post-industrial ethos. They argue that businesses that create intangibles have taken a more prominent role in the wake of manufacturing&#x27;s decline.

Actor and then-artistic director of the Old Vic Theatre, Kevin Spacey, has argued the economic case for the arts in terms of providing jobs and being of greater importance in exports than manufacturing (as well as an educational role) in a guest column he wrote for &quot;The Times&quot;.

==Criticism==
Post-industrialism is criticized for the amount of real fundamental change it produces in society, if any at all. A mild view held by Alan Banks and Jim Foster contends that representations of post-industrial society by advocates assume professional, educated elites were previously less relevant than they have become in the new social order, and that changes that have occurred are minor but greatly embellished. More critical views see the entire process as the highest evolution of capitalism, wherein the system produces commodities as opposed to practical goods and is determined privately instead of socially. This view is complemented by the assertion that &quot;the characteristic feature of a modern [that is, post-industrial] society is that it is a technocracy&quot;. Such societies then become notable for their ability to subvert social consciousness through powers of manipulation rather than powers of coercion, reflective of the &quot;ideology of the ruling class [as] … predominantly managerial&quot;. Pope Francis has suggested that &quot;the post-industrial period may well be remembered as one of the most irresponsible in history&quot;, although he follows this comment with &quot;the hope that humanity at the dawn of the twenty-first century will be remembered for having generously shouldered its grave responsibilities&quot;.

In line with the view that nothing fundamental has changed in the transition from industrial societies to post-industrial societies is the insistence of lingering problems from past development periods. Neo-Malthusian in essence, this outlook focuses on post-industrial society&#x27;s continuing struggle with issues of resource scarcity, overpopulation, and environmental degradation, all of which are remnants from its industrial history. This is exacerbated by a &quot;corporate liberalism&quot; that seeks to continue economic growth through &quot;the creation and satisfaction of false needs&quot;, or as Christopher Lasch more derisively refers to it, &quot;subsidized waste&quot;.

Urban development (UD) in the context of post-industrialism is also a point of contention. In opposition to the view that the new leaders of post-industrial society are increasingly environmentally aware, this critique asserts that UD rather leads to environmental degradation, which is rooted in the patterns of development. Urban sprawl, characterised behaviourally by cities &quot;expanding at the periphery in even lower densities&quot; and physically by &quot;office parks, malls, strips, condo clusters, corporate campuses, and gated communities&quot;, is singled out as the main issue. Resulting from a post-industrialist culture of &quot;mobile capital, the service economy, post-Fordist disposable consumerism and banking deregulation&quot;, urban sprawl has caused post-industrialism to become environmentally and socially regressive. Of the former, environmental degradation results from encroachment as cities meet demands on low-density habitation; the wider spread of population consumes more of the environment while necessitating more energy consumption to facilitate travel within the ever-growing city, incurring greater pollution. This process evokes the neo-Malthusian concerns of overpopulation and resource scarcity that inevitably lead to environmental deterioration. Of the latter, &quot;post-industrialism&#x27;s doctrine of … mobility and malleability&quot; encourage a disconnect between communities where social belonging falls into the category of things considered by the &quot;post-Fordist disposable consumer[ist]&quot; attitude as interchangeable, expendable, and replaceable.

Post-industrialism as a concept is highly Western-centric. Theoretically and effectively, it is only possible in the Global West, which its proponents assume to be solely capable of fully realizing industrialization and then post-industrialization. Herman Kahn optimistically predicted the &quot;economic growth, expanded production and growing efficiency&quot; of post-industrial societies and the resultant &quot;material abundance and… high quality of life&quot; to extend to &quot;almost all people in Western societies&quot; and only &quot;some in Eastern societies&quot;. This prediction is treated elsewhere by contentions that the post-industrial society merely perpetuates capitalism.

Recalling the critical assertion that all modern societies are technocracies, T. Roszak completes the analysis by stating that &quot;all societies are moving in the direction of technocracies&quot;. From this, the foremost &quot;suave technocracies&quot; reside in the West, whereas all others are successively graded in descending order: &quot;vulgar technocracies&quot;, &quot;teratoid technocracies&quot;, and finally &quot;comic opera technocracies&quot;. This view importantly presumes one transition and furthermore one path of transition for societies to undergo, i.e. the one that Western societies are slated to complete. Much like the demographic transition model, this prediction does not entertain the idea of an Eastern or other alternative models of transitional development.

===Neologism===
When historians and sociologists considered the revolution that followed the agricultural society they did not call it a &quot;post-agricultural society&quot;. &quot;Post-industrial society&quot; signifies only a departure, not a positive description.

One of the word&#x27;s early users, Ivan Illich, prefigured this criticism and invented the term Conviviality, or the Convivial Society, to stand as a positive description of his version of a post-industrial society.

===Social critique===
A group of scholars (including Allen Scott and Edward Soja) argue that industry remains at the center of the whole process of capitalist accumulation, with services not only becoming increasingly industrialized and automated but also remaining highly dependent on industrial growth.

Some observers, including Soja (building on the theories of the French philosopher of urbanism Henri Lefebvre), suggest that although industry may be based outside of a &quot;post-industrial&quot; nation, that nation cannot ignore industry&#x27;s necessary sociological importance.

Further concerns can be raised regarding the difference in mindset and objectives between those in an industrial society, and those in a post-industrial one. For instance, if the industrial society (producing the raw materials and goods consumed by its peer) were for some reason to cut off supply to the post-industrial nation, there would be little recourse for the latter to ensure that supply chains were not disrupted. Since the society based on ideas would have diminished real product output, the industrial society would be in a position to dictate terms to its counterpart. The response from the &quot;more advanced&quot; nation might be eventually effective or damaging, however it would be hard pressed to bridge the gap until domestic industry could makeup for the lack of imported manufactured goods.

<text>SohamorSohum ( &quot;&quot;) is a Hindu mantra, literally meaning &quot;That (is) I&quot; in Sanskrit, implying &quot;I am that&quot;.

In Vedic philosophy it means identifying Brahman with the universe or ultimate Brahman.

The mantra is also inverted from &#x27; (the [[sandhi]] of&#x27;) to &#x27;. The combination of&#x27; has also been interpreted as &quot;I am Swan&quot;, where the swan symbolizes the Atman.

==Etymology==

The term &#x27; is related to , and the phrase translates to &quot;That (is) I&quot;, according to Monier-Williams. Interpreted as a nominal sentence, it can also be read as &quot;I am the absolute&quot; or &quot;Great truth&quot;. The term is found in Vedic literature, and is a phrase that identifies &quot;One with the universe or the ultimate one reality&quot;.

== History ==

This phrase is found in Principal Upanishads such as the Isha Upanishad (verse 16), which ends:

: (...) तेजो यत्ते रूपं कल्याणतमं तत्ते पश्यामि योऽसावसौ पुरुषः सोऽहमस्मि ॥१६॥
: &quot;The light which is thy fairest form, I see it. I am what that is&quot; (trans. Max Müller)

Soham, or &quot;I am That&quot;, is very common in ancient and medieval literature. Some examples include:

Upanishads

* Sannyasa Upanishads such as Naradaparivrajaka Upanishad, Nirvana Upanishad, Ashrama Upanishad, Maitreya Upanishad and Satyayaniya Upanishad.
* Yoga Upanishads such as &quot;Dhyanabindu Upanishad&quot; and &quot;Yogashikha Upanishad&quot;
* &quot;Hamsa Upanishad&quot;

as well as the classical yoga treatises &quot;Gheranda Samhita&quot; and &quot;Shiva Samhita&quot; all make mention of &quot;soham&quot; and &quot;hamsa&quot; describing its significance and when teaching uniformly teaches So on inhalation and ham on exhalation.

This traditional practice in its several forms and its background is described in numerous other books.

== Hamsa ==

Swami Muktananda - although teaching the traditional So on inhalation and ham on exhalation as a letter from 1968 to Franklin Jones reveals - later published a book teaching Ham on inhalation and sa on exhalation. This practice is described in several later books all referring to Muktananda.

The teaching of Ham on inhalation and sa on exhalation is allegedly alluded to in a text of Kaśmir Śaivism, the &quot;Vijnana Bhairava&quot;:

However, this verse 155b is not found in the &quot;Vijnana Bhairava&quot; first published in 1918 in the Kashmir Series of Text and Studies but is quoted from a commentary by the Abhinavagupta disciple Kṣemarāja in his &quot;Shiva Sutra Vimarshini&quot; (commentary on the Shiva Sutras) in later editions of &quot;Vijnana Bhairava&quot;.

==Yoga==
When used for meditation, &quot;Sohum&quot; acts as a natural mantra to control one&#x27;s breathing pattern, to help achieve deep breath, and to gain concentration.

* &quot;Sooooo...&quot; is the sound of inhalation, and is remembered in the mind along with that inhalation.
* &quot;Hummmm...&quot; is the sound of exhalation, and is remembered in the mind along with that exhalation.

Soham is also considered a mantra in Tantrism and Kriya Yoga, known also as &quot;Ajapa mantra&quot;, &quot;Ajapa Gayatri&quot;, &quot;Hamsa Gayatri&quot;, &quot;Hamsa mantra&quot;, &quot;prana mantra&quot;, &quot;Shri Paraprasada mantra&quot;, &quot;paramatma-mantra&quot;, and as such used notably on its own, in the meditation practice ajapa japa and in the kriya practice shabda sanchalana.

<text>Christopher James Berman (born May 10, 1955), nicknamed &quot;Boomer&quot;, is an American sportscaster. He has been an anchor for &quot;SportsCenter&quot; on ESPN since 1979, joining a month after its initial launch, and hosted the network&#x27;s &quot;Sunday NFL Countdown&quot; program from 1985 to 2016 and &quot;NFL Primetime&quot; from 1987 to 2005 and since 2019. He has also anchored &quot;Monday Night Countdown&quot;, U.S. Open golf, the Stanley Cup Finals, and other programming on ESPN and ABC Sports. Berman calls play-by-play of select Major League Baseball games for ESPN, which included the Home Run Derby until 2016.

A six-time honoree of the National Sports Media Association&#x27;s National Sportscaster of the Year award, Berman was instrumental in establishing ESPN&#x27;s lasting popularity during the network&#x27;s formative years. He is well known for his various catchphrases and quirky demeanor.

In January 2017, ESPN announced that Berman would be stepping down from several NFL-related roles at the network, but would remain at the company. In May 2021, Berman signed a multiyear contract with ESPN to continue to host &quot;NFL Primetime&quot;.

==Early life==
Berman was born in Greenwich, Connecticut, and grew up in Irvington, New York, the son of Peggy Shevell (née Tenenbaum), who worked as a reporter-researcher for &quot;Time&quot; magazine, and James Keliner Berman, a corporate executive vice president. He was raised Jewish. During his childhood, he went to Camp Winnebago in Fayette, Maine. He enrolled at the Hackley School in 1970, and graduated Brown University in 1977 with a degree in history, where he was the sports director of the school&#x27;s radio station, WBRU.

==Career (1977–present)==

Berman&#x27;s sportscasting career began at Hartford&#x27;s WVIT-TV as a weekend sports anchor. He joined ESPN in 1979, a month after its founding, and has been with the network ever since. He is one of ESPN&#x27;s longest-tenured employees, and the only remaining &quot;SportsCenter&quot; anchor from 1979. He spent 31 years as the host of both &quot;Sunday NFL Countdown&quot;, and ten years hosting &quot;Monday Night Countdown&quot;. In addition, during the NFL season, he hosts the evening &quot;SportsCenter&quot; (airing generally at either 7:30 PM Eastern Time or 11 PM Eastern Time) along with Herm Edwards, who replaced Tom Jackson for the 2016 season. Berman often appears on &quot;SportsCenter&quot; at night (midnight to 1 a.m.) hosting brief segments called &quot;Chris Berman&#x27;s two-minute drill&quot;. From 1988 to 1989, he hosted ESPN&#x27;s first game show, &quot;Boardwalk and Baseball&#x27;s Super Bowl of Sports Trivia&quot;.

By 1993, Berman was described as the leader of the ESPN team and one of the most recognizable sportscasters in the business. &quot;The true test is when Chris is on, turn down your TV and open your window. You will hear him. The microphone is nothing but a prop,&quot; said fellow ESPN anchor Keith Olbermann. In December 2008, the Associated Press ran a long retrospective on Berman&#x27;s 30-year career with ESPN. &quot;He is our most important person,&quot; said Norby Williamson, ESPN&#x27;s vice president of production. &quot;He is the face of ESPN,&quot; he added. At the time, Berman noted that his contract with ESPN would expire on his 55th birthday, and that he did not see himself broadcasting into his 60s. In April 2010, however, ESPN extended Berman&#x27;s contract for an undisclosed period of time, only noting that it was a multi-year deal. The contract was eventually revealed to expire at the end of 2016.

Between 1995 and 2006, Berman hosted &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; as well as live coverage of three Super Bowls for ABC Sports. He continued to host &quot;MNF&quot; when ESPN got the rights in 2006.

Berman was a season ticket holder for the Hartford Whalers and was a strong supporter of the team&#x27;s staying in Connecticut. He occasionally makes reference to the team, sometimes even by humming the team&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Brass Bonanza&quot;. Berman has also become a strong backer of the Buffalo Bills in recent years. In an interview with Buffalo Bills reporter and play-by-play voice John Murphy on July 26, 2012, Berman acknowledged that you could call him a &quot;Bills Booster&quot;. This sentiment is also echoed in Berman&#x27;s on-air phrase, &quot;No one circles the wagons like the Buffalo Bills!&quot; In addition, he has been involved with several events relating to the Bills, such as team founder Ralph Wilson&#x27;s induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and Bruce Smith&#x27;s Bills Hall of Fame induction in September 2016. Berman signed a new contract in January 2017 for a reduced schedule, but remains at ESPN.

On October 29, 2018, Berman served as the on-field emcee for Thurman Thomas&#x27;s number retirement ceremony. In May 2019, Berman called a three-game series for the Boston Red Sox Radio Network alongside longtime Red Sox broadcaster Joe Castiglione.

In 2019, Berman and Tom Jackson re-united for a revival of NFL Primetime, streamed exclusively on ESPN+. In addition, they have also hosted the &quot;fastest three minutes&quot; segments on the Monday Night Football halftime show.

Berman signed a multiyear contract with ESPN in May 2021 to continue to host NFL PrimeTime. In the ESPN contract announcement, Berman said &quot;ESPN has been almost two-thirds of my life. I&#x27;m honored that what I do still works.&quot;

===Style===
Berman is well known for his various catchphrases and player nicknames. 
* His mid-play prediction of a touchdown run as &quot;He could...go...all...the...way!&quot; is perhaps his most famous phrase, and one of the first he adopted. It was featured on the &quot;Jock Rock, Volume 2&quot; compilation album.
* His home run calls of &quot;Back, back, back, back...Gone!&quot;, which he implements most commonly during the MLB Home Run Derby.
* A &quot;Whoop!&quot; is uttered during highlights when a player makes a quick move or causes someone to miss or make a mistake.
* &quot;Tick, tick, tick, tick tick tick tick...&quot; during a post-game recap, for a play or moment in which the clock is a factor.
* When a large player such as a lineman runs with the football, Berman describes him as &quot;rumblin&#x27;, bumblin&#x27;, stumblin&#x27;&quot;.
* Berman is known for integrating puns into player nicknames. For example, he dubbed former Minnesota Twins pitcher Bert Blyleven &quot;Bert &quot;Be Home&quot; Blyleven&quot;. He referred to San Diego Chargers running back Eric Bieniemy as &quot;Eric &quot;Sleeping With&quot; Bieniemy&quot;. Other examples include &quot;Young Again&quot; for Oddibe McDowell, “ABCDEFG” for Dallas Cowboys wide receiver CeeDee Lamb and an imitation of a sneeze for Indianapolis Colts quarterback Gardner Minshew, where Berman goes, “min-min-min, MIN-SHEW!”
* When speaking about the Las Vegas Raiders, he will often pronounce them as &quot;the RRRAY-DAHS&quot; in an homage to late owner Al Davis&#x27; accent.
* When a ball carrier breaks a tackle, he will mimic a collision sound after every broken tackle.
* The Detroit Lions have never won an NFC Championship Game and, as such, have never made it to the Super Bowl, earning them a long history of denigration. Thus, when the Lions do something good, Berman will sometimes utter the word, &quot;LIONS???&quot; in a surprised tone.

Berman adopts the persona of his alter ego, &quot;The Swami,&quot; to make predictions on &quot;Sunday NFL Countdown.&quot; For seven consecutive years &quot;The Swami&quot; predicted a Super Bowl between the San Francisco 49ers and the Buffalo Bills, one or the other – but never both – making it during that span.

===Reception===
Many have enjoyed Berman&#x27;s approach over the years, and he has won various awards. A 1990 &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; feature article cited traits that struck a chord with his TV audience: playfulness, humor, and a Fred Flintstone-like persona. The nicknames were called a key to his success. His genuine love of sports was also noted.

However, he has also drawn a good deal of criticism. Over time, his style came to rub quite a few viewers the wrong way. His detractors find him overly bombastic - and worse, unfunny. A &quot;blowhard...tossing out corny clichés&quot; was one description. Columnist Phil Mushnick viewed his &quot;clown act&quot; as forced, self-serving, and stale. &quot;Schtick&quot; is another label that has been applied. A &quot;Paste&quot; article from 2017 noted that the reasons for his appeal were also what made him eventually grow tiresome.

===In other media===
Berman appeared in Adam Sandler&#x27;s 1998 comedy &quot;The Waterboy&quot; as well as Sandler&#x27;s &quot;The Longest Yard&quot; in 2005, playing himself as the play-by-play announcer of the prison football game. Berman also appeared as himself in &quot;Necessary Roughness&quot; in 1991, &quot;The Program&quot; in 1993 (though was a little out of place doing college football), &quot;Little Big League&quot; in 1994, as well as &quot;Eddie&quot; and &quot;Kingpin&quot; in 1996. He made a cameo appearance in the 1995 Hootie and the Blowfish video for the single &quot;Only Wanna Be With You.&quot; Berman made a cameo in the 2013 comedy &quot;Grown Ups 2&quot;. Berman appears in Nutrisystem commercials with Don Shula, Dan Marino, Terry Bradshaw, and Mike Golic, using some of his trademark phrases and nicknames to show how much weight they lost. He also appears in commercials for repair insurer Carshield.

He appears as the host of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; in &quot;ESPN NFL 2K5&quot;; he is also an unlockable free agent.

==Personal life==

Berman married Katherine &quot;Kathy&quot; Alexinski in 1983. She died in a traffic collision in Woodbury, Connecticut on May 10, 2017. Katherine Berman was driving drunk when she crashed into the back of another vehicle, killing herself and the other driver. The couple had two children.

<text>A signal peptide (sometimes referred to as signal sequence, targeting signal, localization signal, localization sequence, transit peptide, leader sequence or leader peptide) is a short peptide (usually 16-30 amino acids long) present at the N-terminus (or occasionally nonclassically at the C-terminus or internally) of most newly synthesized proteins that are destined toward the secretory pathway.
These proteins include those that reside either inside certain organelles (the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi or endosomes), secreted from the cell, or inserted into most cellular membranes. Although most type I membrane-bound proteins have signal peptides, most type II and multi-spanning membrane-bound proteins are targeted to the secretory pathway by their first transmembrane domain, which biochemically resembles a signal sequence except that it is not cleaved. They are a kind of target peptide.

==Function (translocation)==
Signal peptides function to prompt a cell to translocate the protein, usually to the cellular membrane. In prokaryotes, signal peptides direct the newly synthesized protein to the SecYEG protein-conducting channel, which is present in the plasma membrane. A homologous system exists in eukaryotes, where the signal peptide directs the newly synthesized protein to the Sec61 channel, which shares structural and sequence homology with SecYEG, but is present in the endoplasmic reticulum. Both the SecYEG and Sec61 channels are commonly referred to as the translocon, and transit through this channel is known as translocation. While secreted proteins are threaded through the channel, transmembrane domains may diffuse across a lateral gate in the translocon to partition into the surrounding membrane.

==Structure==
The core of the signal peptide contains a long stretch of hydrophobic amino acids (about 5–16 residues long) that has a tendency to form a single alpha-helix and is also referred to as the &quot;h-region&quot;. In addition, many signal peptides begin with a short positively charged stretch of amino acids, which may help to enforce proper topology of the polypeptide during translocation by what is known as the positive-inside rule. Because of its close location to the N-terminus it is called the &quot;n-region&quot;. At the end of the signal peptide there is typically a stretch of amino acids that is recognized and cleaved by signal peptidase and therefore named cleavage site. This cleavage site is absent from transmembrane-domains that serve as signal peptides, which are sometimes referred to as signal anchor sequences. Signal peptidase may cleave either during or after completion of translocation to generate a free signal peptide and a mature protein. The free signal peptides are then digested by specific proteases.
Moreover, different target locations are aimed by different types of signal peptides. For example, the structure of a target peptide aiming for the mitochondrial environment differs in terms of length and shows an alternating pattern of small positively charged and hydrophobic stretches. Nucleus aiming signal peptides can be found at both the N-terminus and the C-terminus of a protein and are in most cases retained in the mature protein.

==Co-translational versus post-translational translocation==
In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes signal sequences may act co-translationally or post-translationally.

The co-translational pathway is initiated when the signal peptide emerges from the ribosome and is recognized by the signal-recognition particle (SRP). SRP then halts further translation (translational arrest only occurs in Eukaryotes) and directs the signal sequence-ribosome-mRNA complex to the SRP receptor, which is present on the surface of either the plasma membrane (in prokaryotes) or the ER (in eukaryotes). Once membrane-targeting is completed, the signal sequence is inserted into the translocon. Ribosomes are then physically docked onto the cytoplasmic face of the translocon and protein synthesis resumes.

The post-translational pathway is initiated after protein synthesis is completed. In prokaryotes, the signal sequence of post-translational substrates is recognized by the SecB chaperone protein that transfers the protein to the SecA ATPase, which in turn pumps the protein through the translocon. Although post-translational translocation is known to occur in eukaryotes, it is poorly understood. It is known that in yeast post-translational translocation requires the translocon and two additional membrane-bound proteins, Sec62 and Sec63.

==Secretion efficiency determination==

Signal peptides are extremely heterogeneous, many prokaryotic and eukaryotic ones are functionally interchangeable within or between species and all determine protein secretion efficiency.

==Nucleotide level features==

In vertebrates, the region of the mRNA that codes for the signal peptide (i.e. the signal sequence coding region, or SSCR) can function as an RNA element with specific activities. SSCRs promote nuclear mRNA export and the proper localization to the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum. In addition SSCRs have specific sequence features: they have low adenine-content, are enriched in certain motifs, and tend to be present in the first exon at a frequency that is higher than expected.

==Alternate secretion mechanisms==
Proteins without signal peptides can also be secreted by unconventional mechanisms. E.g. Interleukin, Galectin. The process by which such secretory proteins gain access to the cell exterior is termed unconventional protein secretion (UPS). In plants, even 50% of secreted proteins can be UPS dependent.

==Nonclassical sequences==
Signal peptides are usually located at the N-terminus of proteins. Some have C-terminal or internal signal peptides (examples: peroxisomal targeting signal and nuclear localisation signal). The structure of these nonclassical signal peptides differs vastly from the N-terminal signal peptides.

==Nomenclature==
Signal peptides are not to be confused with the leader peptides sometimes encoded by leader mRNA, although both are sometimes ambiguously referred to as &quot;leader peptides.&quot; These other leader peptides are short polypeptides that do not function in protein localization, but instead may regulate transcription or translation of the main protein, and are not part of the final protein sequence. This type of leader peptide primarily refers to a form of gene regulation found in bacteria, although a similar mechanism is used to regulate eukaryotic genes, which is referred to as uORFs (upstream open reading frames).

== Signal peptide as a therapeutic target ==
Signal peptide is a potential (therapeutic) antiviral target. Signal peptides with penultimate N-terminus glycine is a target for NMT inhibitors, which inhibit the myristoylation of signal peptides and target the signal peptide for degradation, which affects virus-cellular fusion.

<text>The translocon (also known as a translocator or translocation channel) is a complex of proteins associated with the translocation of polypeptides across membranes. In eukaryotes the term translocon most commonly refers to the complex that transports nascent polypeptides with a targeting signal sequence into the interior (cisternal or lumenal) space of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) from the cytosol. This translocation process requires the protein to cross a hydrophobic lipid bilayer. The same complex is also used to integrate nascent proteins into the membrane itself (membrane proteins). In prokaryotes, a similar protein complex transports polypeptides across the (inner) plasma membrane or integrates membrane proteins. In either case, the protein complex is formed from Sec proteins (Sec: secretory), with the hetero-trimeric Sec61 being the channel. In prokaryotes, the homologous channel complex is known as SecYEG.

This article focuses on the cell&#x27;s native translocons, but pathogens can also assemble other translocons in their host membranes, allowing them to export virulence factors into their target cells.

==Central channel==

The translocon channel is a hetero-trimeric protein complex called SecYEG in prokaryotes and Sec61 in eukaryotes. It consists of the subunits SecY, SecE, and SecG. The structure of this channel, in its idle state, has been solved by X-ray crystallography in archaea. SecY is the large pore subunit. A larger heptameric complex that includes the core trimeric protein and a tetramer is responsible for the transportation of a subset of polypeptides into the endoplasmic reticulum. The distinct features of the channel contribute to its function in the ER membrane. In a side view, the channel has an hourglass shape, with a funnel on each side. The extracellular funnel has a little &quot;plug&quot; formed out of an alpha-helix. In the middle of the membrane is a construction, formed from a pore ring of six hydrophobic amino acids that project their side chains inwards. This ensures selectivity of elements entering the channel. During protein translocation, the plug is moved out of the way, and a polypeptide chain is moved from the cytoplasmic funnel, through the pore ring, the extracellular funnel, into the extracellular space. Hydrophobic segments of membrane proteins exit sideways through the lateral gate into the lipid phase and become membrane-spanning segments.

In bacteria, SecYEG forms a complex with SecDF, YajC and YidC. In eukaryotes, Sec61 forms a complex with the oligosaccharyl transferase complex, the TRAP complex, and the membrane protein TRAM (possible chaperone). For further components, such as signal peptidase complex and the SRP receptor it is not clear to what extent they only associate transiently to the translocon complex.

The channel allows peptides to move in either direction, so additional systems in the translocon are required to move the peptide in a specific direction. There are two types of translocation: co-translational translocation (occurs concurrently with translation), and post-translational translocation (happens after translation). Each is seen in eukaryotes and bacteria. While eukaryotes unfold the protein with BiP and use other complexes to transport the peptide, bacteria use the SecA ATPase.

=== Co-translational translocation (CTT) ===
In co-translational translocation, the translocon associates with the ribosome so that a growing nascent polypeptide chain is moved from the ribosome tunnel into the translocon channel. The co-translational translocation process in eukaryotes involves SRP that guide nascent polypeptide chains to the translocon while they are still associated with the ribosome. The translocon (translocator) acts as a channel through the hydrophobic membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (after the SRP has dissociated and translation is continued). The emerging polypeptide is threaded through the channel as an unfolded string of amino acids, potentially driven by a Brownian Ratchet. Once translation has been completed, a signal peptidase cleaves off the short signal peptide from the nascent protein, leaving the polypeptide free in the interior of the endoplasmic reticulum.

In eukaryotes, proteins due to be translocated to the endoplasmic reticulum are recognized by the signal-recognition particle (SRP), which halts translation of the polypeptide by the ribosome while it attaches the ribosome to the SRP receptor on the endoplasmic reticulum. This recognition event is based upon a specific N-terminal signal sequence that is in the first few codons of the polypeptide to be synthesised. Bacteria also use an SRP, together with a chaperone YidC that is similar to the eukaryote TRAM.

The translocon can also translocate and integrate membrane proteins in the correct orientation into the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. The mechanism of this process is not fully understood but involves the recognition and processing by the translocon of hydrophobic stretches in the amino acid sequence, which are destined to become transmembrane helices. Closed by stop-transfer sequences and opened by embedded signal sequences, the plug alters between its open and closed states to place helices in different orientations.

=== Post-translational translocation (PTT) ===
In eukaryotes, post-translational translocation depends on BiP and other complexes, including the SEC62/SEC63 integral membrane protein complex. In this mode of translocation, Sec63 helps BiP hydrolyze ATP, which then binds to the peptide and &quot;pulls&quot; it out. This process is repeated for other BiP molecules until the entire peptide has been pulled through.

In bacteria, the same process is done by a &quot;pushing&quot; ATPase known as SecA, sometimes assisted by the SecDF complex on the other side responsible for pulling. The SecA ATPase uses a &quot;push-and-slide&quot; mechanism to move a polypeptide through the channel. In the ATP-bound state, SecA interacts through a two-helix finger with a subset of amino acids in a substrate, pushing them (with ATP hydrolysis) into the channel. The interaction is then weakened as SecA enters the ADP-bound state, allowing the polypeptide chain to slide passively in either direction. SecA then grabs a further section of the peptide to repeat the process.

==The ER-retrotranslocon==
Translocators can also move polypeptides (such as damaged proteins targeted for proteasomes) from the cisternal space of the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol. ER-proteins are degraded in the cytosol by the 26S proteasome, a process known as endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein degradation, and therefore have to be transported by an appropriate channel. This &quot;retrotranslocon&quot; is still enigmatic.

It was initially believed that the Sec61 channel is responsible for this retrograde transport, implying that transport through Sec61 is not always unidirectional but also can be bidirectional. However, the structure of Sec61 does not support this view and several different proteins have been suggested to be responsible for transport from the ER lumen into the cytosol.

== Translocon quality control (TQC) ==
Translocons can be clogged by translationally stalled or improperly folded proteins engaging with the complex. This is one of the ways translocons can become dysfunctional; for example in co-translational translocation (CTT), translocon clogging can occur due to translationally stalled ER-targeted proteins. Translocon clogging during post-translational translocation (PTT) may happen when proteins are not properly folded or form aggregates before they are fully translocated. 

Translocon quality control mechanisms in the cell restore translocon function by relieving clogged translocon channels during protein translocation. The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is one of multiple degradation mechanisms under TQC. The process includes clogged protein targeting by the attachment of ubiquitin enzymes for degradation by the proteasome.

<text>Fiji Airways, formerly Air Pacific, is the flag carrier of Fiji. It operates international services from its hubs in Fiji to 27 destinations, and has an extended network of 108 international destinations through its codeshare partners, including Qantas, who also own a stake in the airline. 

The Fiji Airways Group brings in 64 percent of all visitors who fly to Fiji, employs over 1,000 employees, and earns revenues of over FJD$815 million (US$390m).

The first commercial flight as Fiji Airways was made in 1951 but the airline&#x27;s origins date back to Katafaga Estates Ltd. formed in 1947. After being acquired by Qantas in 1958, Katafaga Estates was retooled as a regional airline and renamed Air Pacific. In May 2012, MD/CEO David Pflieger announced that as the final part of the airline&#x27;s successful turnaround, the airline would be returning to its former name of Fiji Airways to reinforce its role as the national airline of Fiji. The Fiji government owns 52% of the airline, the Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF) owns 30% and Qantas 16%, diluted from its previous 46% stake after FNPF purchased their stake in Fiji Airways to raise capital during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the governments of several Pacific island nations holding the remainder.

The airline replaced five of its older Boeing 737s with newer Boeing 737 MAX 8 at a list price of around US$110 million each, beginning in 2018. The airline is also currently leasing two Airbus A350-900 aircraft. The 737 MAX 8s and A330-200s are intended for Fiji Airways&#x27; services within Oceania, while the Airbus A350-900s and A330-300s are intended for services to long-haul destinations such as the United States, Canada and Singapore.

==History==
===Origins===

The airline was founded by Australian aviator Harold Gatty who in 1931 had been the navigator on a record-breaking round-the-world flight with Wiley Post. Gatty moved to Fiji after World War II and registered the airline in 1947 as Katafaga Estates Ltd., after the coconut estate Gatty had established on Fiji&#x27;s eastern island group. Gatty renamed the airline as Fiji Airways in September 1951. The New Zealander Fred Ladd was Fiji Airways&#x27; first Chief Pilot.

===Flight history===
Fiji Airways&#x27; inaugural flight was on 1 September 1951, when a seven-seater de Havilland Dragon Rapide biplane departed Suva&#x27;s Nausori Airport for Drasa Airport near Lautoka, on the west coast of the main island. The airline&#x27;s first international flight to Brisbane, Australia was on 1 June 1973. In 1983 the airline started flights to the US with a route to Honolulu called &quot;Project America&quot;. In December 2009, Air Pacific commenced a twice-weekly service to Hong Kong from Nadi, which was increased to three services in January 2014. In July 2010 Air Pacific announced a new Suva-Auckland service, which was discontinued in 2020.

===Air Pacific===
After Gatty&#x27;s death in 1958, Fiji Airways was acquired by Qantas. Initially, Qantas tried to create international support for a multinational, shared, regional airline. By 1966 Fiji Airways&#x27;s shareholders included the governments of Tonga, Western Samoa, Nauru, Kiribati and the Solomon Islands. By 1968, Qantas, Air New Zealand, British Overseas Airways Corporation and the Fiji government held equal shareholdings.

After Fiji gained independence from Great Britain in 1970, the new national government began buying shares and the airline was renamed Air Pacific to reflect its regional presence.


By the early 1970s, seven Pacific island governments, some still under British rule at the time, held shares in Air Pacific, in addition to shares held by Qantas, Air New Zealand and the British Overseas Airways Corporation. However, the regional airline idea lost support as some of the shareholding Pacific island governments sold their shares and created their own national airlines.

In the 1970s, tourism became the nation&#x27;s leading industry, which made the airline even more important to the Fijian economy; and in 1974 the government of Fiji began increasing its shareholding. By 1978 it owned 93%. In 1987 Qantas purchased 20%. In 1993, the government owned 80%, Qantas 10% and Air New Zealand 2%. Having in 1995 acquired a further 8% from Sea-Com, in 1998 Qantas increased its shareholding to 46%.

In the 1990s the airline relocated its headquarters from the capital city of Suva to the coastal town of Nadi where the main international airport is located. The company also constructed an elaborate aircraft maintenance centre there.

In 2005, Air Pacific acquired Sun Air, a domestic airline, renamed it Pacific Sun and began operations as Air Pacific&#x27;s domestic and regional subsidiary. In May 2012, Managing Director &amp; CEO Dave Pflieger announced that the airline, which was completing a successful turnaround that included restructuring and re-fleeting, would be re-branded as &quot;Fiji Airways&quot; to help enhance sales and marketing of the airline and the south pacific island nation. In June 2014, Pacific Sun was rebranded to Fiji Link.

===Rebranding as Fiji Airways===
In May 2012, the airline announced that it would be rebranding to its original name of Fiji Airways, with the rebranding coinciding with the delivery of the A330 aircraft in 2013. Fiji Airways&#x27; new logo, a &quot;Masi symbol that epitomises Fiji and enhances the new name of Fiji&#x27;s national carrier&quot;, was announced by Managing Director &amp; CEO Dave Pflieger on 17 August 2012. The design was created by local Fijian Masi artist, Makereta Matemosi. The airline&#x27;s new brand identity and colour scheme were fully revealed by the CEO and Prime Minister of Fiji at a formal red-carpet, black-tie event in Suva on 10 October 2012, in conjunction with Fiji Day.

The rebranding to Fiji Airways officially took place on 27 June 2013. The name change aimed to associate the airline more closely with the nation and to be more visible in search results. Also during the rebranding of Air Pacific to Fiji Airways, a new line of uniforms for its cabin crew was launched, and was designed by Fiji-based French designer Alexandra Poenaru-Philp. In China, the name Air Pacific was often confused with Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacific, Philippine airline Cebu Pacific and a Chinese air conditioning company. With the rebranding came a name change for the airline&#x27;s booking classes. The Pacific Voyager (economy) and Tabua Class (business) of Air Pacific became the Fiji Airways&#x27; Economy and Fiji Airways&#x27; Business Class. The airline also launched a new website with the rebranding.

===Fleet history===

Fiji Airways used small de Havilland Dragon Rapide and de Havilland Australia DHA-3 Drover aircraft when it was newly founded. The fleet grew to include two ATR 42 turboprops and two leased jets, a Boeing 747-200B and a Boeing 767. By the late 1990s, the fleet included both Boeing 737 and 767 jets, while the ATR 42 turboprops were used on domestic flights. Air Pacific also operated 2 BAC 111 Srs 479 jet aircraft from 1973 until 1984. These aircraft operated across the airline&#x27;s network including to Australia. The 747 was originally leased from Qantas. In August 1993 it was replaced by a 747 from Air New Zealand. From August 1996, a 747-200 was again leased from Qantas.

The 2000 Fijian coup d&#x27;état devastated the country&#x27;s tourism industry and overall economy, which led to a substantial decrease in travel to Fiji. Faced with a falloff in air traffic, Air Pacific returned one of its two leased Boeing 747s. In 2003, Air Pacific received the first of two Boeing 747-400s it was leasing from Singapore Airlines. They had previously been leased with Ansett Australia until Ansett&#x27;s collapse in 2001.

In 2006, Air Pacific ordered five Boeing 787-9s. In April 2011, Air Pacific announced that it had cancelled its Boeing 787-9 order due to delivery delays of almost four years by Boeing. In October 2011, Air Pacific announced that it had ordered three Airbus A330-200s. In March 2013 the company received its first &quot;Fiji Airways&quot; branded Airbus A330. It was christened &quot;The Island of Taveuni&quot; and had its first flight to Auckland on 2 April. In June, one of the Boeing 747-400s was retired. The other, although &#x27;withdrawn from service&#x27;, was used on an ad-hoc basis when needed. It was retired on 20 November 2013 when it was flown to be scrapped. Today the fleet includes four Airbus A350-900, four Airbus A330-200s, one Airbus A330-300, one Boeing 737-800s, and five Boeing 737 MAX 8s. Fiji Link operates two ATR 72-600, an ATR 42-600 and three de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft. In preparation of the rebranding, Air Pacific retired its Boeing 747-412s from service.

On 2 May 2019, Fiji Airways announced its intention to lease two Airbus A350-900 from Dubai Aerospace Enterprise as a part of their fleet expansion. They operate on routes to Australia, New Zealand and the United States. These A350 frames were originally to be delivered to Hong Kong Airlines, however following the cancellation of that order, they were purchased by Dubai Aerospace Enterprise.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Fiji Airways announced 800 job losses in Fiji on 25 May 2020.

===Airline partnerships===
In partnership with Qantas, Air Pacific helped pioneer the concept of codeshare agreements in the early 1980s. Today, codesharing is an accepted airline practice all over the world. In the 1990s Air Pacific signed a codeshare agreement with Canadian Airlines, allowing it to transport traffic from Toronto on to Auckland, New Zealand. Soon after it struck a codeshare deal with American Airlines.

Qantas, which owned less than 20% of Air Pacific at the time, began a ten-year management contract with the airline in 1985 to help reverse the financial losses the company was struggling with. In 1986, Air Pacific posted a profit of nearly $100,000. In 1987 Qantas paid a reported $3.5 million for a 20 percent stake in Air Pacific. Qantas raised its equity from 17.45 percent to 46 percent in 1998.

On 25 January 1995 Air Pacific and the then Royal Tongan Airlines began a joint leasing of aircraft. The concept came complete with the livery of the two airlines painted on each side of the Boeing 737-300 fuselage.

Fiji Airways has a subsidiary airline Fiji Link (formerly Pacific Sun) that offers domestic flights and flights to the nearby islands of Tonga, Samoa, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. Fiji Airways is also a partner with the frequent flyer programmes of Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, and Qantas.

Fiji Airways code shares with Air Vanuatu, Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong Airlines, Jetstar, Jetstar Asia, Qantas, Samoa Airways, Singapore Airlines, and Solomon Airlines.

Fiji Airways has been a Connect Member of Oneworld since 5 December 2018.

In June 2024, Oneworld and Fiji Airways announced that Fiji Airways would become the alliance&#x27;s 15th full member of the alliance with the transition set to begin immediately and be complete within 12 months. That same month, American Airlines announced that Fiji Airways would join its frequent-flyer program, AAdvantage, sometime within the ensuing year. In November of that year, the airline implemented a complimentary unlimited onboard Wi-Fi system for instant messaging across all classes.

==Corporate affairs==
===Ownership and structure===
Fiji Airways is part of the Air Pacific Group (which includes the national airline, its wholly owned subsidiary Fiji Link, and a 38.75% stake in the Sofitel Fiji Resort &amp; Spa on Denarau Island). The Air Pacific Group itself is owned by the Fijian government (51%), Fiji National Provident Fund (30%) the Australian flag-carrier Qantas (16%), and Air New Zealand and the governments of Kiribati, Tonga, Nauru and Samoa and the Unit Trust of Fiji each hold minor stakes.

===Business trends===
The airline was largely profitable from 1995 to 2004, with the exception of 2001. In the late 2000s, the airline suffered back-to-back losses of FJ$5.2 million for fiscal year 2008–2009 and FJ$65.3 million for 2009–2010. It posted FJ$24.8 in 2009–2010 and FJ$11.4 in 2011–2012, respectively. After switching to a fiscal year that ends on 31 December, the airline reported profits for 9 months in 2013 of FJ$8.3 million. In 2014, the airline posted a FJ$55.6 million profit.

The key trends for Fiji Airways, and the overall Group (including Fiji Link operations), are shown below (as at year ending 31 March until March 2013; year ending 31 December thereafter):

=== Sponsorships ===
In October 2017, Fiji Airways became the official airline of Fiji Rugby. The sponsorship saw Fiji Airways taking over the following Fiji Rugby teams with major naming and branding rights for the next five years: Fiji Airways Flying Fijians (15s team); Fiji Airways National 7s Team; Fiji Airways Fijiana 15s Team (Women&#x27;s 15s team); Fiji Airways Fijiana 7s Team (Women&#x27;s 7s team); Fiji Airways Drua; Fiji Link Referees (all referees in Fiji will be sponsored by and will wear Fiji Link branded apparel).

<text>Yelena Vladimirovna Kondakova (; born 30 March 1957) is the third Soviet or Russian female cosmonaut to travel to space and the first woman to make a long-duration spaceflight. Her first trip into space was on Soyuz TM-20 on 4 October 1994. She returned to Earth on 22 March 1995, after a five-month stay at the Mir space station. Kondakova&#x27;s second flight was as a mission specialist on the United States Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; during mission STS-84 in May 1997. She was the last Russian woman in space until her successor cosmonaut Elena Serova flew to the International Space Station (ISS) on 25 September 2014.

== Personal life ==
Kondakova was born in Mytishchi in the Moscow Oblast of Russia, but grew up near Kaliningrad, Moscow Oblast, with an older brother. In 1973 she graduated from high school in Kaliningrad. In 1980 she graduated from the Bauman Moscow State Technical University, where she specialized in production of aircraft. Kondakova&#x27;s parents both worked at Energia, and her father was concerned about her taking on role as cosmonaut because he was well aware of the dangers involved. Since 1980, she worked as an engineer in the 113th department of NPO Energia (since 1994 - Rocket and Space Corporation Energia named after S.P. Korolev), where she was an employee of the Main Operational Control Group. She was engaged in the long-term planning of space flights and training personnel to work in emergencies, worked on implementing scientific projects and experiments, and carried out research. In 1982-1985, she was a member of the flight control group of the Salyut 7 space station.

She married fellow cosmonaut Valeri Ryumin in 1985 and has one daughter with him. In the same year, she began training and studying the Soyuz-TM spacecraft. She joined the USSR cosmonaut corps 1989.

Kondakova&#x27;s first flight into space began on 4 October 1994 as a flight engineer on the Soyuz TM-20 expedition. She returned to Earth on 22 March 1995 after a 5-month flight on the &quot;Mir&quot; orbital station. Kondakova was the first woman to make a long flight into space.

During her first excursion into space, her husband Valery would often complain about how he desired a more traditional wife who would take care of the home and family. While Kondakova was away in space during this time, Energia appointed Ryumin to work from home and take care of his daughter until Kondakova&#x27;s return.

In August 1996, Kondakova trained at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, United States.

Kondakova&#x27;s second space flight was as a specialist on the American Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; as part of the STS-84 expedition from 15-24 May 1997, under the program of the sixth docking with the &quot;Mir&quot; orbital station.

Kondakova retired from the cosmonaut corps of RSC Energia on 30 December 1999 due to her election as a deputy of the State Duma. From 1999 to 2003, she was a Deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation of the 3rd Convocation from the Fatherland - All Russia party. From 2003 to 2011, she was Deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation of the 4th and 5th convocations from the United Russia party. In 2006 she graduated from the Diplomatic Academy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation.

On 16 August 2011, Kondakova announced her withdrawal from United Russia due to her disagreement with the results of the August intra-party elections.

From 27 March 2012 to 2018, Kondakova was a Trade Representative of the Russian Federation in Switzerland.

<doc id="501339" wikidata="Q7824955" url="?curid=501339" title="Topogenic sequence">
<text>A topogenic sequence is a collective term used for a peptide sequence present at nascent proteins essential for their insertion and orienting in cellular membranes. The sequences are also used to translocate proteins across various intracellular membranes, and ensure they are transported to the correct organelle after synthesis. The position of the sequence may be at the end, e.g. N-terminal signal sequence, or in mid parts of the nascent protein, e.g. stop-transfer anchor sequences and signal-anchor sequences. If the sequence is at the end of the polypeptide, it is cleaved off after entering the ER-lumen (via a translocon) by a signal peptidase, and subsequently degraded.

As an example, the vast majority of all known complex plastid preproteins (an &#x27;unactivated&#x27; protein) encoded in the nucleus possess a topogenic sequence.

<doc id="501340" wikidata="Q509025" url="?curid=501340" title="Big Daddy (1999 film)">
<text>Big Daddy is a 1999 American comedy-drama film directed by Dennis Dugan, written by Steve Franks, Tim Herlihy, and Adam Sandler from a story conceived by Franks, and produced by Sid Ganis and Jack Giarraputo. The film stars Sandler, Joey Lauren Adams, Jon Stewart, Rob Schneider, Dylan Sprouse, Cole Sprouse, and Leslie Mann, with Allen Covert and Josh Mostel in supporting roles. The plot follows a 32-year-old man who gets dumped by his girlfriend for not accepting responsibility and then tries to be responsible by adopting a five-year-old boy who appears on his doorstep.

Produced by Giarraputo&#x27;s Jack Giarraputo Productions in association with Out of the Blue... Entertainment, &quot;Big Daddy&quot; was released in the United States on June 25, 1999, by Columbia Pictures. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, the film was a success at the box office, grossing $235 million on a $34 million budget and becoming Sandler&#x27;s highest-grosser domestically until &quot;Hotel Transylvania 2&quot; (2015). The film was nominated for five Razzies and Sandler won the Worst Actor category.

==Plot==
In New York City, Sonny Koufax is a 32-year-old slacker and law school graduate who hasn&#x27;t taken the bar exam, works one day a week as a toll booth attendant, has his food delivered by his friend Nazo, and lives off a $200,000 compensation from a minor accident. His girlfriend Vanessa threatens to break up with him unless he takes more responsibility. His roommate Kevin Gerrity proposes to his podiatrist girlfriend Corinne before he leaves for China to work on a case for his law firm and she accepts. Corinne vehemently dislikes Sonny because he constantly teases her about her former job at Hooters when she was in medical school.

The next day, Sonny wakes up to find Julian &quot;Frankenstein&quot; McGrath, a five-year-old from Buffalo left at their apartment. A note states that his mother is no longer able to care for him after falling ill and that Kevin is his biological father. Sonny contacts Kevin who is puzzled by the news. Despite his selfishness and lack of parenting skills, Sonny assures him that he will take care of Julian until Kevin returns from China. To win Vanessa back, Sonny introduces her to Julian. However, he discovers that she is now dating Sid, whomdespite being much older than hershe reveres as more motivated and intelligent with a &quot;five-year plan&quot;.

Becoming frustrated with parenting, Sonny poses as Kevin and takes Julian to his social worker Arthur Brooks telling him that Julian should return to his mother. However, Brooks informs Sonny that Julian&#x27;s mother died of cancer and offers to place Julian into a foster home. After this, Sonny rants about it in a phone call to his father, Lenny, who is shocked and infuriated with Sonny for trying to raise a child, due to his irresponsibility. Sonny decides to raise Julian his own way. They develop a strong bond and Julian helps Sonny find a new girlfriend in Corinne&#x27;s lawyer sister Layla. Brooks finds a foster home for Julian and leaves messages for Sonny, but is suspicious when he does not respond.

After a meeting at school where Julian&#x27;s teacher complains about the bad habits he has developed due to Sonny&#x27;s influence, Sonny rethinks his parenting methods and turns Julian&#x27;s behavior around. Days later, Brooks arrives to find out Sonny impersonated Kevin and threatens to have him arrested if he does not hand over Julian. Sonny complies, although Julian is hurt that he has to leave. Sonny contacts Layla to help take legal action.

In court, Layla, Kevin, and Sonny&#x27;s lawyer friends Phil and Tommy represent Sonny, while his friends and even Corinne provide positive testimony for Sonny. Julian also testifies and provides information regarding his birth in Toronto (he moved to Buffalo to be with his mother), which appears to spark Kevin&#x27;s memory. Sonny then calls himself to the stand and asks his father to question him. Despite Lenny&#x27;s fervent belief that he is not father material, Sonny convinces him that he will not fail at being a father (his words touch the men present in court, even Brooks and his prosecution team, who all contact their own fathers to express their love for them). Impressed by Sonny&#x27;s sincerity, Lenny vouches for his son to raise Julian. Nonetheless, Judge Healy states that Sonny should be imprisoned for defrauding the city. However, Kevin refuses to press charges and admits to Corinne about his one-night stand during a past trip to Toronto. Judge Healy grants Kevin custody pending a DNA test. Sonny promises Julian that although he cannot be his father, he will always be there for him. He then passes Julian to Kevin and the two start to bond. Sonny still maintains contact with Julian through Kevin, often meeting up with him for activities such as basketball.

One year later, a more mature and responsible Sonny is now a successful lawyer. He is given a surprise birthday party at Hooters by his friends with Kevin, Corinne, and Julian in attendance. It is shown that he is now is married to Layla and they have a baby. Sonny and Julian are now uncle and nephew since Kevin married Corrine. With Nazo sticking around for a short time due to his other deliveries, Sonny encounters Vanessa working there as a waitress with Sid working as a cook, revealing that his &quot;five-year plan&quot; did not go as she had hoped. Sonny&#x27;s friends and Layla celebrate Sonny&#x27;s birthday.

==Cast==

In addition, Carmen De Lavallade appears as the judge during the custody hearing, Geoffrey Horne appears as Vanessa&#x27;s current boyfriend Sid, while other Adam Sandler film repeat regulars include Edmund Lyndeck as an elderly bar patron named Mr. Herlihy who claims that Sonny &quot;fights like a girl&quot;, Steven Brill as lawyer Ted Castellucci who assists Brooks at the custody hearing, Sandler&#x27;s wife Jackie Sandler as a waitress at the bar Sonny frequents and his niece and nephew Jillian and Jared Sandler as two people named Jillian and Jared. Dennis Dugan has an uncredited appearance as a reluctant trick-or-treat giver.

==Production==
Principal photography took place in New York from September 24 to December 21, 1998. Pete Davidson auditioned for a role. The script was originally titled &quot;Guy Gets Kid&quot; and was considered for Chris Farley.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Big Daddy&quot; has an approval rating of 39% based on 93 reviews, and an average rating of 4.9/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Adam Sandler acquits himself admirably, but his charm isn&#x27;t enough to make up for &quot;Big Daddy&quot;&#x27;s jarring shifts between crude humor and mawkish sentimentality.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 41 out of 100, based on reviews from 26 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B+.

Nathan Rabin of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; called it &quot;Sandler&#x27;s best movie&quot;, noting that &quot;Sandler possesses an innocence that makes the mean-spiritedness inherent in much of his work surprisingly palatable.&quot; Robert Koehler of &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a step forward for Adam Sandler, as well as a strategy to expand his audience. While the loyal male-teen aud[ience] core will not be disappointed with the spate of gags just for them, story contains solid date-movie material.&quot;

Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said: &quot;There&#x27;s no doubt Sandler is talented, but if he persists in believing that, like Elvis, his presence alone covers a multitude of omissions and inconsistencies, he will squander his gift and make a series of forgettable films in the process.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film one-and-a-half out of four stars, describing the main character as &quot;seriously disturbed&quot; and the story as &quot;predictable&quot;, although he did praise Joey Lauren Adams&#x27;s character as &quot;entertaining&quot;.

Director Paul Thomas Anderson is a noted fan of the film, considering it one of his favorites.

<doc id="501350" wikidata="Q5397023" url="?curid=501350" title="Escape from Noise">
<text>Escape from Noise is the fourth studio album by Negativland. It marked the band&#x27;s first release on an established independent record label, SST Records. The album continued to develop the band&#x27;s experimental style, though it also featured shorter, more melodic songs than their previous material. The track &quot;Christianity Is Stupid&quot;, a track featuring samples of evangelist Estus Pirkle from his film &quot;If Footmen Tire You, What Will Horses Do?&quot;, proved to be an enduring signature song. Negativland gained media attention a year later after issuing a press release falsely implying that murderer David Brom had been motivated by the song; this would inspire their subsequent album &quot;Helter Stupid&quot;.

==Release==
The original release of &quot;Escape from Noise&quot; came with a yellow bumper sticker with black letters reading &quot;Car Bomb&quot;, and a booklet outlining the history of the band, along with photos of band members and reviews of previous releases. In the booklet, Crosley Bendix (Don Joyce) describes how the band&#x27;s apartment and studio space were destroyed by a two-alarm fire on the night of &quot;Friday the 13th of February, 1987&quot;.

The fire started in Smart Laundry, a dry cleaning business located at street level below Negativland&#x27;s apartment at 10028 San Pablo Avenue in El Cerrito, California. When he saw flames leaping up past their kitchen window, band member Mark Hosler yelled to his friend Tera Freedman in the next room to call 9-1-1. Hosler and Freedman collected the finished master tapes and artwork for &quot;Escape from Noise&quot; and quickly left the building, just as fire crews arrived. Cleaning solvents in the laundry accelerated the fire and caused extensive damage to the building before fire crews gained control. Afterward, the band grimly assessed the total destruction of the recording equipment and the materials from previous releases before traveling to Los Angeles to meet with SST executives and &quot;reaffirm their album commitment&quot;.

In 1999, Seeland Records reissued the album in a new &quot;un-remixed&quot; edition, adding no bonus tracks and moving the text on the front cover to the booklet. A sticker was placed on the album, saying:
An old album from Negativland: Digitally exacto-remastered 33 rpm compact disc re-issue of Negativland&#x27;s classic 1987 LP with no added bonus tracks of any kind!

Don&#x27;t let the new cover design fool you – your audiophile friends might think that such classics as &quot;Car Bomb&quot; and &quot;Christianity Is Stupid&quot; sound crisper and cleaner on this newly un-remixed edition, but they&#x27;re dead wrong! And even though there are no longer eleven time zones in the Soviet Union (and no Soviet Union, either) this re-release sounds &quot;exactly&quot; the same as the original. The only thing different is the sticker you are reading right now.
The original LP is still in print on SST Records.

In 1988, the group released a press release suggesting that the song &quot;Christianity Is Stupid&quot; was connected to murders by David Brom, and that the group was forced to cancel a planned tour in support of &quot;Escape from Noise&quot;. However, there were no connections with the murders, and the tour was cancelled only due to shortage of funds and free time. Their next album, &quot;Helter Stupid&quot;, made use of the event by sampling news reports on the case.

<text>If terminal sialic acid residues are removed from glycoproteins, the resulting proteins are known as asialoglycoproteins. 

In rats, the exposure of subterminal galactose or GalNAc residues may assist in receptor-mediated endocytosis of asialoglycoproteins by asialoglycoprotein receptors on Kuppfer cells. The human ortholog of this gene is non-functional, but hepatocyte asialoglycoprotein receptors are functional in both humans and rats.

<text>In ethology, territory is the sociographical area that an animal consistently defends against conspecific competition (or, occasionally, against animals of other species) using agonistic behaviors or (less commonly) real physical aggression. Animals that actively defend territories in this way are referred to as being territorial or displaying territorialism.

Territoriality is only shown by a minority of species. More commonly, an individual or a group of animals occupies an area that it habitually uses but does not necessarily defend; this is called its home range. The home ranges of different groups of animals often overlap, and in these overlap areas the groups tend to avoid each other rather than seeking to confront and expel each other. Within the home range there may be a &quot;core area&quot; that no other individual group uses, but, again, this is as a result of avoidance.

==Function==
The ultimate function of animals inhabiting and defending a territory is to increase the individual fitness or inclusive fitness of the animals expressing the behaviour. Fitness in this biological sense relates to the ability of an animal to survive and raise young. The proximate functions of territory defense vary. For some animals, the reason for such protective behaviour is to acquire and protect food sources, nesting sites, mating areas, or to attract a mate.

==Types and size==
Among birds, territories have been classified as six types.

*Type A: An &#x27;all-purpose territory&#x27; in which all activities occur, e.g. courtship, mating, nesting and foraging
*Type B: A mating and nesting territory, not including most of the area used for foraging.
*Type C: A nesting territory which includes the nest plus a small area around it. Common in colonial waterbirds.
*Type D: A pairing and mating territory. The type of territory defended by males in lekking species.
*Type E: Roosting territory. 
*Type F: Winter territory which typically includes foraging areas and roost sites. May be equivalent (in terms of location) to the Type A territory, or for a migratory species, may be on the wintering grounds.

Reports of territory size can be confused by a lack of distinction between home range and the defended territory. The size and shape of a territory can vary according to its purpose, season, the amount and quality of resources it contains, or the geography. The size is usually a compromise of resource needs, defense costs, predation pressure and reproductive needs.

Some species of squirrels may claim as much as of territory.
For European badgers, a home range may be as small as in a good rural habitat, but as large as in a poor habitat. On average, a territory may be approximately , with main setts normally at least apart. In urban areas, territories can be as small as , if they can obtain enough food from bird tables, food waste or artificial feeding in suburban gardens. Spotted hyenas (&quot;Crocuta crocuta&quot;) have highly variable territory sizes, ranging from less than in the Ngorongoro Crater to over in the Kalahari.

In birds, golden eagles (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;) have territories of , least flycatchers&#x27; (&quot;Empidonax minimus&quot;) territories are about and gulls have territories of only a few square centimetres in the immediate vicinity of the nest.

Territories can be linear. Sanderlings (&quot;Calidris alba&quot;) forage on beaches and sandflats. When on beaches, they feed either in flocks or individual territories of 10 to 120 metres of shoreline.

The time to develop territories varies between animals. The marine iguana (&quot;Amblyrhynchus cristatus&quot;) is a lekking reptile. Males start to establish small display territories two months ahead of the mating season.

==Retaining a territory==

Rather than retaining a territory simply by fighting, for some animals this can be a 3-stage process. Many animals create &quot;sign-posts&quot; to advertise their territory. Sometimes these sign-posts are on the boundary thereby demarcating the territory, or, may be scattered throughout the territory. These communicate to other animals that the territory is occupied and may also communicate additional information such as the sex, reproductive status or dominance status of the territory-holder. Sign-posts may communicate information by olfactory, auditory, or visual means, or a combination of these. If an intruder progresses further into the territory beyond the sign-posts and encounters the territory-holder, both animals may begin ritualized aggression toward each other. This is a series of stylised postures, vocalisations, displays, etc. which function to solve the territory dispute without actual fighting as this could injure either or both animals. Ritualized aggression often ends by one of the animals fleeing (generally the intruder). If this does not happen, the territory may be defended by actual fighting, although this is generally a last resort.

===Advertising the territory===
====Scent marking====

Scent marking, also known as territorial marking or spraying when this involves urination, is a behaviour used by animals to identify their territory. Most commonly, this is accomplished by depositing strong-smelling substances contained in the urine, faeces, or, from specialised scent glands located on various areas of the body. Often, the scent contains pheromones or carrier proteins such as the major urinary proteins to stabilize the odours and maintain them for longer. The animal sniffing the scent frequently displays a flehmen response to assist in detecting the mark. Scent marking is often performed by scent rubbing in many mammals. In many mammal species, scent marking is more frequent during the breeding season.

Bears and felids such as leopards and jaguars scent-mark by urinating on or rubbing against vegetation. Prosimians and New World monkeys also use scent marking, including urine washing (self-anointing the body with urine), to communicate. Many ungulates, for example the blue wildebeest, use scent marking from two glands, the preorbital gland and a scent gland in the hoof.

Territorial scent marking may involve behaviours specific to this activity. When a wolf marks its territory, it lifts a hind leg and urinates on a scent post (usually an elevated position like a tree, rock, or bush). This raised leg urination is different from normal urination, which is done while squatting. This posture is exclusive to alpha wolves of either sex, although the alpha male does this most often. The alpha female usually urinates on a scent post that her breeding partner has just urinated on, although during the mating season, the female may first urinate on the ground. All other females in the pack, and also young wolves and low-ranking male wolves, urinate while squatting. Similar urination postures are used by coyotes and golden jackals.

Males and female ring-tailed lemurs (&quot;Lemur catta&quot;) scent-mark both vertical and horizontal surfaces at the overlaps in their home ranges using their anogenital scent glands. To do this, they perform a handstand to mark vertical surfaces, grasping the highest point with their feet while applying the scent.

In the Eastern carpenter bee, &quot;Xylocopa virginica&quot;, both sexes have glands that evolved for marking the nest. Males, although they have the gland, are unable to produce the marking substance. Females secrete it near the nest site entrance to establish their territory.

Wombats use feces to mark their territory. They have evolved specialized intestinal anatomy to produce cubical feces to ensure the feces do not roll away.
====Visual====
Visual sign-posts may be a short-term or long-term mode of advertising a territory. Short-term communication includes the colouration or behaviour of the animal, which can only be communicated when the resident is present. Other animals may use more long-term visual signals such as faecal deposits, or marks on the vegetation or ground. Visual marking of territory is often combined with other modes of animal communication.

Some animals have prominent &quot;badges&quot; or visual displays to advertise their territory, often in combination with scent marking or auditory signals. Male European robins are noted for their highly aggressive territorial behaviour. They attack other males that stray into their territories, and have been observed attacking other small birds without apparent provocation. Such attacks sometimes lead to fatalities, accounting for up to 10% of adult robin deaths in some areas. The red breast of the bird (i.e. badge) is highly visible when it sings (vocal marking) at the boundary of its territory. The ring-tailed lemur (&quot;Lemur catta&quot;) advertises its territory with urine scent marks. When it is urinating for marking purposes, it holds its extremely distinctive tail high in the air adding a visual component to the advertisement; when it is urinating for eliminative purposes, its tail is only slightly raised.
Rhinoceros have poor vision but may use visual marking. Dominant white rhino bulls mark their territory with faeces and urine (olfactory marking). The dung is laid in well defined piles. There may be 20 to 30 of these piles to alert passing rhinoceroses that it is occupied territory. Other males may deposit dung over the piles of another and subsequently the sign-post grows larger and larger. Such a dung heap can become up to five metres wide and one metre high. After defecating, greater one-horned rhinos scratch their hind feet in the dung. By continuing to walk, they &quot;transport&quot; their own smell around the paths, thus establishing a scent-marked trail. Another method of visually marking their territory is wiping their horns on bushes or the ground and scraping with the feet, although this is likely combined with the smell of the marking animal. The territorial male scrape-marks every or so around its territory boundary.

After leaving a urination mark, some animals scrape or dig the ground nearby, thereby leaving a visual advertisement of the territory. This includes domestic dogs.

Several species scratch or chew trees leaving a visual mark of their territory. This is sometimes combined with rubbing on the tree which may leave tufts of fur. These include the Canada lynx (&quot;Lynx canadensis&quot;) and the American black bear (&quot;Ursus americanus&quot;). Many animals have scent glands in their paws or deposit fur during tree-marking, so tree-marking may be a combination of both visual and olfactory advertising of the territory. The male ring-tailed lemur has a specialised adaptation to assist in leaving visual/olfactory territorial marks. On their inner forearm (antebrachial) is a scent gland which is covered by a spur. In a behaviour called &quot;spur marking&quot;, they grasp the substrate, usually a small sapling, and drag the spur over it, cutting into the wood and spreading the gland&#x27;s secretions. When on the ground, ring-tailed lemurs preferentially mark small saplings and when high in the trees, they usually mark small vertical branches.

European wildcats (&quot;Felis silvestris&quot;) deposit their faecal marks on plants with high visual conspicuousness that enhances the visual effectiveness of the signal.

====Auditory====
Many animals use vocalisations to advertise their territory. These are short-term signals transmitted only when the animal is present, but can travel long distances and over varied habitats. Examples of animals which use auditory signals include birds, frogs and canids.

Wolves advertise their territories to other packs through a combination of scent marking and howling. Under certain conditions, wolf howls can be heard over areas of up to . When howling together, wolves harmonize rather than chorus on the same note, thus creating the illusion of there being more wolves than there actually are. Wolves from different geographic locations may howl in different fashions: the howls of European wolves are much more protracted and melodious than those of North American wolves, whose howls are louder and have a stronger emphasis on the first syllable.

===Ritualized aggression===
Animals use a range of behaviours to intimidate intruders and defend their territories, but without engaging in fights which are expensive in terms of energy and the risk of injury. This is ritualized aggression. Such defense frequently involves a graded series of behaviours or displays that include threatening gestures (such as vocalizations, spreading of wings or gill covers, lifting and presentation of claws, head bobbing, tail and body beating) and finally, direct attack.

===Defense===
Territories may be held by an individual, a mated or unmated pair, or a group. Territoriality is not always a fixed behavioural characteristic of a species. For example, red foxes (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;) either establish stable home ranges within particular areas or are itinerant with no fixed abode. Territories may vary with time (season). For example, European robins defend territories as pairs during the breeding season but as individuals during the winter. Resource availability may cause changes in territoriality. For example, some nectarivores defend territories only during the mornings when plants are richest in nectar. In species that do not form pair bonds, male and female territories are often independent, i.e. males defend territories only against other males and females only against other females. In this case, if the species is polygynous, one male territory probably contains several female territories, while in some polyandrous species such as the northern jacana, this situation is reversed.

==Strategies==
Animals may use several strategies to defend their territories.

The first game theory model of fighting is known as the &quot;hawk-dove game&quot;. This model pits a hawk strategy (always try to injure your opponent and only withdraw from the contest if an injury is received) against a dove strategy (always use a non-injurious display if the rival is another dove and always withdraw if the rival is a hawk).

Another strategy used in territory defence is the war of attrition. In this model of aggression, two contestants compete for a resource by persisting while constantly accumulating costs over the time that the contest lasts. Strategically, the game is an auction in which the prize goes to the player with the highest bid, and each player pays the loser&#x27;s low bid.

Some animals use a strategy termed the &quot;dear enemy effect&quot; in which two neighbouring territorial animals become less aggressive toward one another once territorial borders are well-established and they are familiar to each other, but aggression toward unfamiliar animals remains unaffected. The converse of this is the &quot;nasty neighbour effect&quot; in which a territory-holder shows heightened aggression toward neighbouring territory-holders but unaffected aggression to unfamiliar animals or distant territory-holders. These contrasting strategies depend on which intruder (familiar or unfamiliar) poses the greatest threat to the resident territory-holder.

In territory defence by groups of animals, &quot;reciprocal altruism&quot; can operate whereby the cost to the benefactor in helping defend the territory is less than the gains to the beneficiary.

==Resources defended==
An animal chooses its territory by deciding what part of its home range it will defend. In selecting a territory, the size and quality play crucial roles in determining an animal&#x27;s habitat. Territory size generally tends to be no larger than the organism requires to survive, because defending a larger territory incurs greater energy, time and risk of injury costs. For some animals, the territory size is not the most important aspect of territoriality, but rather the quality of the defended territory.

Behavioural ecologists have argued that food distribution determines whether a species is territorial or not, however, this may be too narrow a perspective. Several other type of resource may be defended including partners, potential mates, offspring, nests or lairs, display areas or leks. Territoriality emerges where there is a focused resource that provides enough for the individual or group, within a boundary that is small enough to be defended without the expenditure of excessive effort. Territoriality is often most strong towards conspecifics, as shown in the case of redlip blenny. This is because the conspecifics share exactly the same set of resources.

Several types of resource in a territory may be defended.
Food: Large solitary (or paired) carnivores, such as bears and the bigger raptors require an extensive protected area to guarantee their food supply. This territoriality only breaks down when there is a glut of food, for example when grizzly bears are attracted to migrating salmon.

Food related territoriality is least likely with insectivorous birds, where the food supply is plentiful but unpredictably distributed. Swifts rarely defend an area larger than the nest. Conversely, other insectivorous birds that occupy more constrained territories, such as the ground-nesting blacksmith lapwing may be very territorial, especially in the breeding season during which they not only threaten or attack many kinds of intruders, but have stereotyped display behaviour to deter conspecifics sharing neighbouring nesting spots.

The owl limpet (&quot;Lottia gigantea&quot;) is a large (up to 8 cm in length) limpet. It lives in association with an approximately 1,000 cm^2 area of algal film in which its grazing marks can be seen, whereas the remainder of the rock surface is usually free of any visible film. These areas of algal film represent the territories of the Lottia; within them the animals do all their grazing. They keep their territories free of other organisms by shoving off any intruders: other Lottia, grazing limpets of the genus Acmaea, predatory snails, and sessile organisms such as anemones and barnacles.

Nests and offspring: Many birds, particularly seabirds, nest in dense communities but are nonetheless territorial in defending their nesting site to within the distance they can reach while brooding. This is necessary to prevent attacks on their own chicks or nesting material from neighbours. Commonly the resulting superimposition of the short-range repulsion onto the long-range attraction characteristically leads to the well-known roughly hexagonal spacing of nests. One gets a similar hexagonal spacing resulting from the territorial behaviour of gardening limpets such as species of Scutellastra. They vigorously defend their gardens of particular species of algae, that extend for perhaps 1–2 cm around the periphery of their shells.

The desert grass spider, &quot;Agelenopsis aperta,&quot; often engages in fights over its territory and the most combative spiders have the largest territories.

Some species of penguin defend their nests from intruders trying to steal the pebbles from which the nest is constructed.

Mating opportunities: The striped mouse (&quot;Rhabdomys pumilio&quot;) is group living with one single breeding male and up to 4 communally breeding females per group. Groups typically contain several philopatric adult sons (and daughters) that are believed not to breed in their natal group and all group members participate in territorial defence. Males defend their territory using a nasty neighbour strategy. Group-living male breeders are nearly five times more aggressive towards their neighbours than towards strangers, leading to the prediction that neighbours are the most important competitors for paternity. Using a molecular parentage analysis it has been shown that 28% of offspring are sired by neighbouring males and only 7% by strangers. In certain species of butterflies, such as the Australian painted lady butterfly and the speckled wood butterfly, the male defends territories that receptive females are likely to fly through such as sunny hilltops and sunspots on a forest&#x27;s floor.

Territory defence in male variegated pupfish (&quot;Cyprinodon variegatus&quot;) is dependent on the presence of females. Reduced aggression consistent with the dear enemy effect occurs between conspecific neighbours in the absence of females, but the presence of a female in a male&#x27;s territory instigates comparably greater aggression between the neighbours.

In the Skylark (&quot;Alauda arvensis&quot;), playbacks of neighbour and stranger songs at three periods of the breeding season show that neighbours are dear enemies in the middle of the season, when territories are stable, but not at the beginning of the breeding season, during settlement and pair formation, nor at the end, when bird density increases due to the presence of young birds becoming independent. Thus, this dear enemy territoriality relationship is not a fixed pattern but a flexible one likely to evolve with social and ecological circumstances.

Some species of bees also exhibit territoriality to defend mating sites. For example, in &quot;Euglossa imperialis,&quot; a non-social bee species, males have been observed to occasionally form aggregations of fragrance-rich territories, considered to be leks. These leks serve only a facultative purpose for this species, in which the more fragrance-rich sites there are, the greater the number of habitable territories. Since these territories are aggregated, females have a large selection of males with whom to potentially mate within the aggregation, giving females the power of mate choice. Similar behaviour is also observed in the &quot;Eulaema meriana&quot; orchid bee. Males in this species of bee show alternative behaviours of territoriality and transiency. Transient male bees did not defend territories, but instead flew from one territory to the other. They also did not engage in physical contact with the territorial males. On the other hand, territorial males patrolled an area around a tree and used the same territory for up to 49 days. It also appeared that they gave up territories to new males without violence. Males defend territories solely for mating, and no other resources such as fragrances, nests, nest construction materials, nectar, or pollen are found at these territories.

===Single resource territories===
Although most territories contain multiple (potential) resources, some territories are defended for only one purpose. European blackbirds may defend feeding territories that are distant from their nest sites, and in some species that form leks, for example in the Uganda kob (a grazing antelope) and the marine iguana, males defend the lek site which is used only for mating.

==Polyterritoriality==
Many species demonstrate polyterritoriality, referring to the act of claiming or defending more than one territory. In the European pied flycatcher (&quot;Ficedula hypoleuca&quot;), researchers assert that males exhibit polyterritoriality to deceive females of the species into entering into polygynous relationships. This hypothesis, named the deception hypothesis, claims that males have territories at distances sufficiently great that females are unable to discern already-mated males. The observation that males travelled long distances, ranging from 200m to 3.5 km, to find a second mate supports this argument. The debate about polyterritoriality in this species may initiate research about the evolution and reasons for polyterritoriality in other unrelated species.

<text>Glycosylphosphatidylinositol () or glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) is a phosphoglyceride that can be attached to the C-terminus of a protein during posttranslational modification. The resulting GPI-anchored proteins play key roles in a wide variety of biological processes. GPI is composed of a phosphatidylinositol group linked through a carbohydrate-containing linker (glucosamine and mannose glycosidically bound to the inositol residue) and via an ethanolamine phosphate (EtNP) bridge to the C-terminal amino acid of a mature protein. The two fatty acids within the hydrophobic phosphatidyl-inositol group anchor the protein to the cell membrane.

== Synthesis ==

Glycosylated (GPI-anchored) proteins contain a signal sequence, thus directing them to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The protein is co-translationally inserted in the ER membrane via a translocon and is attached to the ER membrane by its hydrophobic C terminus; the majority of the protein extends into the ER lumen. The hydrophobic C-terminal sequence is then cleaved off and replaced by the GPI-anchor. As the protein processes through the secretory pathway, it is transferred via vesicles to the Golgi apparatus and finally to the plasma membrane where it remains attached to a leaflet of the cell membrane. Since the glypiation is the sole means of attachment of such proteins to the membrane, cleavage of the group by phospholipases will result in controlled release of the protein from the membrane. The latter mechanism is used &quot;in vitro&quot;; i.e. membrane proteins released from membranes in enzymatic assays are glypiated proteins.

== Cleavage ==

Phospholipase C (PLC) is an enzyme known to cleave the phospho-glycerol bond found in GPI-anchored proteins. Treatment with PLC will cause release of GPI-linked proteins from the outer cell membrane. The T-cell marker Thy-1 and acetylcholinesterase, as well as both intestinal and placental alkaline phosphatases, are known to be GPI-linked and are released by treatment with PLC. GPI-linked proteins are thought to be preferentially located in lipid rafts, suggesting a high level of organization within plasma membrane microdomains.

== GPI-anchor synthesis deficiencies ==

=== In humans ===

Defects in the GPI-anchor synthesis occur in rare acquired diseases such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and congenital diseases such as hyperphosphatasia with mental retardation syndrome (HPMRS). In PNH a somatic defect in blood stem cells, which is required for GPI synthesis, results in faulty GPI linkage of decay-accelerating factor (DAF) and CD59 in red blood cells. The most common cause of PNH are somatic mutations in the X-chromosomal gene &quot;PIGA&quot;. However, a PNH case with a germline mutation in the autosomal gene &quot;PIGT&quot; and a second acquired somatic hit has also been reported.
Without these proteins linked to the cell surface, the complement system can lyse the cell, and high numbers of RBCs are destroyed, leading to hemoglobinuria.
For patients with HPMRS, disease-causing mutations have been reported in the genes &quot;PIGV&quot;, &quot;PIGO&quot;, &quot;PGAP2&quot; and &quot;PGAP3&quot;.

=== In other species ===
The variable surface glycoproteins from the sleeping sickness protozoan &quot;Trypanosoma brucei&quot; are attached to the plasma membrane via a GPI anchor.

<text>Sinus Meridiani (Latin &quot;Sinus meridiani&quot;, &quot;Meridian Bay&quot;) is an albedo feature on Mars stretching east-west just south of the planet&#x27;s equator. It was named by the French astronomer Camille Flammarion in the late 1870s.

In 1979-2001, the vicinity of this feature (with size about and coordinates of the center ) was named &quot;Terra Meridiani&quot;.

== Observational history ==
The name Sinus Meridiani was given to a classic albedo feature on Mars by the French astronomer Camille Flammarion in the late 1870s. Prior astronomers, notably the German team of Wilhelm Beer and Johann Heinrich von Mädler and then the Italian Giovanni Schiaparelli, had chosen a particular point on Mars as being the location of its prime meridian when they charted their observations. Accepting suggestions that dark areas on the surface of Mars were seas or oceans, Flammarion named a dark area at that point &quot;Sinus Meridiani,&quot; literally &quot;Meridian Bay,&quot; when he worked on his compilation and analysis of all prior observations of Mars. In 1958, this name was approved by International Astronomical Union.

Since the 1960s, when flybys and access to orbital spacecraft imagery of Mars began to become commonplace, many relief features were named in addition to previously named albedo features. In 1979, a region of Sinus Meridiani was named &quot;Terra Meridiani&quot;, literally &quot;Meridian Land.&quot; In 2001, boundaries of regional features were redefined, and this name was dropped.

== Meridiani Planum ==

The name &quot;Meridiani Planum&quot;, literally &quot;Meridian Plain,&quot; is used to refer specifically to the landing site of Mars Exploration Rover &quot;Opportunity&quot;, in the western portion of Sinus Meridiani. This site was chosen by the Mars Exploration Rover team both for its characteristic as a flat and mostly rock-free plain (and hence a safe landing site), and also as a site which showed the spectral signature of the mineral hematite, which is often a sign of deposition in an aqueous environment.

=== Analysis by &quot;Opportunity&quot; ===

The &quot;Opportunity&quot; rover found that the soil at Meridiani Planum was very similar to the soil at Gusev crater and Ares Vallis; however, in many places at Sinus Meridiani, the soil was covered with round, hard, gray spherules, dubbed &quot;blueberries.&quot; These blueberries were found to be composed almost entirely of the mineral hematite. It was decided that the spectra signal spotted from orbit by 2001 Mars Odyssey was produced by these spherules. Further studies found that the blueberries were concretions formed in the ground by water. Over time, these concretions weathered from what was overlying rock, and then became concentrated on the surface as a lag deposit. The concentration of spherules in bedrock could have produced the observed blueberry covering from the weathering of as little as one meter of rock. Most of the soil consisted of olivine basalt sands that did not come from the local rocks, and is thus speculated to have come from elsewhere.

==== Minerals in dust ====

A Mössbauer spectrum was made of the dust that gathered on &quot;Opportunity&quot;″s capture magnet. The results suggested that the magnetic component of the dust was titanomagnetite, rather than just plain magnetite, as was once thought. Trace amounts of olivine were also detected, which indicated a long arid period on the planet. On the other hand, a small amount of hematite that was present meant that there may have been liquid water for a short time in the early history of the planet. Because the Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT) found it easy to grind into the bedrocks, it is thought that the rocks are much softer than the rocks at Gusev crater.

==== Bedrock minerals ====
Few rocks were visible on the surface where &quot;Opportunity&quot; landed, but bedrock that was exposed in craters was examined by the suite of instruments on the Rover. Bedrock rocks were found to be sedimentary rocks with a high concentration of sulfur in the form of calcium and magnesium sulfates. Some of the sulfates that may be present in bedrocks are kieserite, sulfate anhydrate, bassanite, hexahydrite, epsomite, and gypsum. Salts, such as halite, bischofite, antarcticite, blödite, vanthoffite, or glauberite may also be present.

The rocks contained the sulfates had a light tone compared to isolated rocks and rocks examined by landers/rovers at other locations on Mars. The spectra of these light toned rocks, containing hydrated sulfates, were similar to spectra taken by the Thermal Emission Spectrometer on board the Mars Global Surveyor. The same spectrum is found over a large area, so it is believed that water once appeared over a wide region, not just in the area explored by &quot;Opportunity&quot;.

The Alpha particle X-ray spectrometer (APXS) found rather high levels of phosphorus in the rocks. Similar high levels were found by other rovers at Ares Vallis and Gusev crater, so it has been hypothesized that the mantle of Mars may be phosphorus-rich. The minerals in the rocks could have originated by acid weathering of basalt. Because the solubility of phosphorus is related to the solubility of uranium, thorium, and rare-earth elements, they are all also expected to be enriched in rocks.

When &quot;Opportunity&quot; traveled to the rim of the impact crater Endeavour, it found a white vein that was later identified as being pure gypsum. It was formed when water was discovered to harbor a then-unknown gypsum formation, at the time dubbed &quot;Homestake,&quot; deposited the mineral into a crack in the rock.

=== Evidence for water ===
Examination of bedrocks in Sinus Meridiani showed evidence of the mineral jarosite, which forms only in water. This discovery proved that water once existed in Sinus Meridiani In addition, some rocks showed small laminations with shapes only created by gently flowing water. The first such laminations were found in a rock called &quot;The Dells.&quot; Geologists would say that the cross-stratification showed festoon geometry from transport in subaqueous ripples.

Box-shaped holes in some rocks were caused by sulfates forming large crystals, and then when the crystals later dissolved, holes, called vugs, were left behind. The concentration of the element bromine in rocks was highly variable probably because it is very soluble. Water may have concentrated it in places before it evaporated. Another mechanism for concentrating highly soluble bromine compounds is frost deposition, which, at night, would form very thin films of water that would concentrate bromine in certain spots.

=== Rock from impact ===
One rock, dubbed &quot;Bounce Rock,&quot; was discovered sitting on the sandy plains. It was later found to be ejecta from an impact crater, known as tektites. Its chemistry was different from the bedrock&#x27;s. Containing mostly pyroxene and plagioclase with no olivine, it closely resembled a part, Lithology B, of the shergottite meteorite EETA 79001, a meteorite known to have come from Mars. Bounce rock received its name by being near an airbag bounce mark.

=== Meteorites ===

&quot;Opportunity&quot; found multiple meteorites on the plains of Sinus Meridiani. The first one analyzed with &quot;Opportunity&quot;″s instruments was named &quot;Heatshield Rock,&quot; as it was found near where &quot;Opportunity&quot;″s headshield landed. Examination with the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES), Mossbauer spectrometer, and APXS, lead researchers to classify it as an IAB meteorite. The APXS determined it was composed of 93% iron and 7% nickel. The cobble named &quot;Fig Tree Barberton&quot; is thought to be a stony or stony-iron meteorite (mesosiderite silicate), while &quot;Allan Hills&quot; and &quot;Zhong Shan&quot; may be iron meteorites.

=== Geological history ===

Observations at the site have led scientists to believe that the area was flooded with water a number of times and was subjected to evaporation and desiccation. In the process, sulfates were deposited. After sulfates cemented the sediments, hematite concretions grew by precipitation from groundwater. Some sulfates formed into large crystals, which later dissolved to leave vugs. Several lines of evidence point toward an arid climate in the past billion years or so, but a climate supporting water, at least for a time, in the distant past.

<doc id="501376" wikidata="Q320607" url="?curid=501376" title="Oligosaccharide">
<text>An oligosaccharide (; ) is a saccharide polymer containing a small number (typically three to ten) of monosaccharides (simple sugars). Oligosaccharides can have many functions including cell recognition and cell adhesion.

They are normally present as glycans: oligosaccharide chains are linked to lipids or to compatible amino acid side chains in proteins, by &quot;N&quot;- or &quot;O&quot;-glycosidic bonds. &quot;N&quot;-Linked oligosaccharides are always pentasaccharides attached to asparagine via a beta linkage to the amine nitrogen of the side chain. Alternately, &quot;O&quot;-linked oligosaccharides are generally attached to threonine or serine on the alcohol group of the side chain. Not all natural oligosaccharides occur as components of glycoproteins or glycolipids. Some, such as the raffinose series, occur as storage or transport carbohydrates in plants. Others, such as maltodextrins or cellodextrins, result from the microbial breakdown of larger polysaccharides such as starch or cellulose.
==Glycosylation==
In biology, glycosylation is the process by which a carbohydrate is covalently attached to an organic molecule, creating structures such as glycoproteins and glycolipids.

===&quot;N&quot;-Linked oligosaccharides===

&quot;N&quot;-Linked glycosylation involves oligosaccharide attachment to asparagine via a beta linkage to the amine nitrogen of the side chain. The process of &quot;N&quot;-linked glycosylation occurs cotranslationally, or concurrently while the proteins are being translated. Since it is added cotranslationally, it is believed that &quot;N&quot;-linked glycosylation helps determine the folding of polypeptides due to the hydrophilic nature of sugars. All &quot;N&quot;-linked oligosaccharides are pentasaccharides: five monosaccharides long.

In &quot;N&quot;-glycosylation for eukaryotes, the oligosaccharide substrate is assembled right at the membrane of the endoplasmatic reticulum. For prokaryotes, this process occurs at the plasma membrane. In both cases, the acceptor substrate is an asparagine residue. The asparagine residue linked to an &quot;N&quot;-linked oligosaccharide usually occurs in the sequence Asn-X-Ser/Thr, where X can be any amino acid except for proline, although it is rare to see Asp, Glu, Leu, or Trp in this position.

===&quot;O&quot;-Linked oligosaccharides===

Oligosaccharides that participate in &quot;O&quot;-linked glycosylation are attached to threonine or serine on the hydroxyl group of the side chain. &quot;O&quot;-linked glycosylation occurs in the Golgi apparatus, where monosaccharide units are added to a complete polypeptide chain. Cell surface proteins and extracellular proteins are &quot;O&quot;-glycosylated. Glycosylation sites in &quot;O&quot;-linked oligosaccharides are determined by the secondary and tertiary structures of the polypeptide, which dictate where glycosyltransferases will add sugars.

==Glycosylated biomolecules==
Glycoproteins and glycolipids are by definition covalently bonded to carbohydrates. They are very abundant on the surface of the cell, and their interactions contribute to the overall stability of the cell.

===Glycoproteins===
Glycoproteins have distinct Oligosaccharide structures which have significant effects on many of their properties, affecting critical functions such as antigenicity, solubility, and resistance to proteases. Glycoproteins are relevant as cell-surface receptors, cell-adhesion molecules, immunoglobulins, and tumor antigens.

===Glycolipids===
Glycolipids are important for cell recognition, and are important for modulating the function of membrane proteins that act as receptors. Glycolipids are lipid molecules bound to oligosaccharides, generally present in the lipid bilayer. Additionally, they can serve as receptors for cellular recognition and cell signaling. The head of the oligosaccharide serves as a binding partner in receptor activity. The binding mechanisms of receptors to the oligosaccharides depends on the composition of the oligosaccharides that are exposed or presented above the surface of the membrane. There is great diversity in the binding mechanisms of glycolipids, which is what makes them such an important target for pathogens as a site for interaction and entrance. For example, the chaperone activity of glycolipids has been studied for its relevance to HIV infection.

All cells are coated in either glycoproteins or glycolipids, both of which help determine cell types. Lectins, or proteins that bind carbohydrates, can recognize specific oligosaccharides and provide useful information for cell recognition based on oligosaccharide binding.

An important example of oligosaccharide cell recognition is the role of glycolipids in determining blood types. The various blood types are distinguished by the glycan modification present on the surface of blood cells. These can be visualized using mass spectrometry. The oligosaccharides found on the A, B, and H antigen occur on the non-reducing ends of the oligosaccharide. The H antigen (which indicates an O blood type) serves as a precursor for the A and B antigen. Therefore, a person with A blood type will have the A antigen and H antigen present on the glycolipids of the red blood cell plasma membrane. A person with B blood type will have the B and H antigen present. A person with AB blood type will have A, B, and H antigens present. And finally, a person with O blood type will only have the H antigen present. This means all blood types have the H antigen, which explains why the O blood type is known as the &quot;universal donor&quot;.

Vesicles are directed by many ways, but the two main ways are:
# The sorting signals encoded in the amino acid sequence of the proteins.
# The Oligosaccharide attached to the protein.

The sorting signals are recognised by specific receptors that reside in the membranes or surface coats of budding vesicles, ensuring that the protein is transported to the appropriate destination.

===Cell adhesion===
Many cells produce specific carbohydrate-binding proteins known as lectins, which mediate cell adhesion with oligosaccharides. Selectins, a family of lectins, mediate certain cell–cell adhesion processes, including those of leukocytes to endothelial cells. In an immune response, endothelial cells can express certain selectins transiently in response to damage or injury to the cells. In response, a reciprocal selectin–oligosaccharide interaction will occur between the two molecules which allows the white blood cell to help eliminate the infection or damage. Protein-Carbohydrate bonding is often mediated by hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces.

==Dietary oligosaccharides==
Fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), which are found in many vegetables, are short chains of fructose molecules. They differ from fructans such as inulin, which as polysaccharides have a much higher degree of polymerization than FOS and other oligosaccharides, but like inulin and other fructans, they are considered soluble dietary fibre. Using fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) as fiber supplementations is shown to have an effect on glucose homeostasis quite similar to insulin. These (FOS) supplementations can be considered prebiotics which produce short-chain fructo-oligosaccharides (scFOS). Galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) in particular are used to create a prebiotic effect for infants that are not being breastfed.

Galactooligosaccharides (GOS), which also occur naturally, consist of short chains of galactose molecules. Human milk is an example of this and contains oligosaccharides, known as human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), which are derived from lactose. These oligosaccharides have biological function in the development of the gut flora of infants. Examples include lacto-N-tetraose, lacto-N-neotetraose, and lacto-N-fucopentaose. These compounds cannot be digested in the human small intestine, and instead pass through to the large intestine, where they promote the growth of &quot;Bifidobacteria&quot;, which are beneficial to gut health.

HMOs can also protect infants by acting as decoy receptors against viral infection. HMOs accomplish this by mimicking viral receptors which draws the virus particles away from host cells. Experimentation has been done to determine how glycan-binding occurs between HMOs and many viruses such as influenza, rotavirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The strategy HMOs employ could be used to create new antiviral drugs.

Mannan oligosaccharides (MOS) are widely used in animal feed to improve gastrointestinal health. They are normally obtained from the yeast cell walls of &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;. Mannan oligosaccharides differ from other oligosaccharides in that they are not fermentable and their primary mode of action includes agglutination of type-1 fimbria pathogens and immunomodulation.

===Sources===
Oligosaccharides are a component of fibre from plant tissue. FOS and inulin are present in Jerusalem artichoke, burdock, chicory, leeks, onions, and asparagus. Inulin is a significant part of the daily diet of most of the world&#x27;s population. FOS can also be synthesized by enzymes of the fungus &quot;Aspergillus niger&quot; acting on sucrose. GOS is naturally found in soybeans and can be synthesized from lactose. FOS, GOS, and inulin are also sold as nutritional supplements.

<text>Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) or haemagglutinin[p] (British English) is a homotrimeric glycoprotein found on the surface of influenza viruses and is integral to its infectivity.

Hemagglutinin is a class I fusion protein, having multifunctional activity as both an attachment factor and membrane fusion protein. Therefore, HA is responsible for binding influenza viruses to sialic acid on the surface of target cells, such as cells in the upper respiratory tract or erythrocytes, resulting in the internalization of the virus. Additionally, HA is responsible for the fusion of the viral envelope with the late endosomal membrane once exposed to low pH (5.0–5.5).

The name &quot;hemagglutinin&quot; comes from the protein&#x27;s ability to cause red blood cells (i.e., erythrocytes) to clump together (i.e., agglutinate) &quot;in vitro&quot;.

==Subtypes==
Hemagglutinin (HA) in influenza A virus (IAV) has at least 18 different subtypes. These subtypes are named H1 through H18. H16 was discovered in 2004 on IAVs isolated from black-headed gulls from Sweden and Norway. H17 was discovered in 2012 in fruit bats. Most recently, H18 was discovered in a Peruvian bat in 2013. The first three hemagglutinins, H1, H2, and H3, are found in influenza viruses that infect humans. By phylogenetic similarity, the HA proteins are divided into 2 groups, with H1, H2, H5, H6, H8, H9, H11, H12, H13, H16, H17, and H18 belonging to group 1 and the rest in group 2. The serotype of IAV is determined by the HA and neuraminidase (NA) proteins expressed on its surface. Neuraminidase has 11 known subtypes; hence, influenza viruses are named according to the combinations of HA and NA proteins expressed (e.g., H1N1 and H5N2).

A highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus, A(H5N1), is known to infect humans as well as its original avian hosts, albeit quite infrequently. It has been reported that single amino acid changes in the virus&#x27;s H5 hemagglutinin have been found in human patients that &quot;can significantly alter receptor specificity of avian H5N1 viruses, providing them with an ability to bind to receptors optimal for human influenza viruses.&quot; This finding seems to explain how an H5N1 virus that normally does not infect humans can mutate and become able to efficiently infect human cells. The hemagglutinin of the H5N1 virus has been associated with its high degree of pathogenicity, apparently due to its ease of conversion to an active form by proteolysis.

== Structure ==
HA is a homotrimeric integral membrane glycoprotein. It has C3 molecular symmetry. It is shaped like a cylinder, and is approximately 13.5 nanometres long. HA trimer is made of three identical monomers. Each monomer is made of an intact HA0 single polypeptide chain with HA1 and HA2 regions that are linked by 2 disulfide bridges. Each HA2 region adopts alpha helical coiled coil structure and sits on top of the HA1 region, which is a small globular domain that consists of a mix of α/β structures. The HA trimer is synthesized as inactive precursor protein HA0 to prevent any premature and unwanted fusion activity and must be cleaved by host proteases in order to be infectious. At neutral pH, the 23 residues near the N-terminus of HA2, also known as the fusion peptide that is eventually responsible for fusion between viral and host membrane, is hidden in a hydrophobic pocket between the HA2 trimeric interface. The C-terminus of HA2, also known as the transmembrane domain, spans the viral membrane and anchors protein to the membrane.

;HA1
: HA1 is mostly composed of antiparallel beta-sheets.

;HA2
:HA2 domain contains three long alpha helices, one from each monomer. Each of these helices is connected by a flexible, loop region called Loop-B (residue 59 to 76).

== Function ==

HA plays two key functions in viral entry. Firstly, it allows the recognition of target vertebrate cells, accomplished through the binding to these cells&#x27; sialic acid-containing receptors. Secondly, once bound it facilitates the entry of the viral genome into the target cells by causing the fusion of host endosomal membrane with the viral membrane.

Specifically, the HA1 domain of the protein binds to the monosaccharide sialic acid which is present on the surface of its target cells, allowing attachment of viral particle to the host cell surface. HA17 and HA18 have been described to bind MHC class II molecules as a receptor for entry rather than sialic acid. The host cell membrane then engulfs the virus, a process known as endocytosis, and pinches off to form a new membrane-bound compartment within the cell called an endosome. The cell then attempts to begin digesting the contents of the endosome by acidifying its interior and transforming it into a lysosome. Once the pH within the endosome drops to about 5.0 to 6.0, a series of conformational rearrangement occurs to the protein. First, fusion peptide is released from the hydrophobic pocket and HA1 is dissociated from HA2 domain. HA2 domain then undergoes extensive conformation change that eventually bring the two membranes into close contact.

This so-called &quot;fusion peptide&quot; that was released as pH is lowered, acts like a molecular grappling hook by inserting itself into the endosomal membrane and locking on. Then, HA2 refolds into a new structure (which is more stable at the lower pH), it &quot;retracts the grappling hook&quot; and pulls the endosomal membrane right up next to the virus particle&#x27;s own membrane, causing the two to fuse together. Once this has happened, the contents of the virus such as viral RNA are released in the host cell&#x27;s cytoplasm and then transported to the host cell nucleus for replication.

== As a treatment target ==

Since hemagglutinin is the major surface protein of the influenza A virus and is essential to the entry process, it is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies. These antibodies against flu have been found to act by two different mechanisms, mirroring the dual functions of hemagglutinin:

=== Head antibodies ===
Some antibodies against hemagglutinin act by inhibiting attachment. This is because these antibodies bind near the top of the hemagglutinin &quot;head&quot; (blue region in figure above) and physically block the interaction with sialic acid receptors on target cells.

=== Stem antibodies ===
This group of antibodies acts by preventing membrane fusion (only &quot;in vitro&quot;; the efficacy of these antibodies &quot;in vivo&quot; is believed to be a result of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and the complement system).

The stem or stalk region of HA (HA2), is highly conserved across different strains of influenza viruses. The conservation makes it an attractive target for broadly neutralizing antibodies that target all flu subtypes, and for developing universal vaccines that let humans produce these antibodies naturally. Its structural changes from prefusion to postfusion conformation drives fusion between viral membrane and host membrane. Therefore, antibodies targeting this region can block key structural changes that eventually drive the membrane fusion process, and therefore are able to achieve antiviral activity against several influenza virus subtypes. At least one fusion-inhibiting antibody was found to bind closer to the top of hemagglutinin, and is thought to work by cross-linking the heads together, the opening of which is thought to be the first step in the membrane fusion process.

Examples are human antibodies F10, FI6, CR6261. They recognize sites in the stem/stalk region (orange region in figure at right), far away from the receptor binding site.

In 2015 researchers designed an immunogen mimicking the HA stem, specifically the area where the antibody ties to the virus of the antibody CR9114. Rodent and nonhuman primate models given the immunogen produced antibodies that could bind with HAs in many influenza subtypes, including H5N1. When the HA head is present, the immune system does not generally make bNAbs (broadly neutralizing antibodies). Instead, it makes the head antibodies that only recognize a few subtypes. Since the head is responsible for holding the three HA units together, a stem-only HA needs its own way to hold itself together. One team designed self-assembling HA-stem nanoparticles, using a protein called ferritin to hold the HA together. Another replaced and added amino acids to stabilize a mini-HA lacking a proper head.

A 2016 vaccine trial in humans found many broadly neutralizing antibodies targeting the stem produced by the immune system. Three classes of highly similar antibodies were recovered from multiple human volunteers, suggesting that a universal vaccine that produces reproducible antibodies is indeed possible.

=== Other agents ===
There are also other hemagglutinin-targeted influenza virus inhibitors that are not antibodies:
# Arbidol
# Small Molecules
# Natural compounds
# Proteins and peptides

<doc id="501385" wikidata="Q1604442" url="?curid=501385" title="Ruby Ridge standoff">
<text>The Ruby Ridge standoff was the siege of a cabin occupied by the Weaver family in Boundary County, Idaho, in August 1992. On August 21, deputies of the United States Marshals Service (USMS) came to arrest Randy Weaver under a bench warrant for his failure to appear on federal firearms charges after he was given the wrong court date. The charges stemmed from Weaver&#x27;s sale of a sawed-off shotgun to an undercover federal informant, who had induced him to modify the firearm below the legal barrel length.

During a surveillance operation, officer Art Roderick shot Weaver&#x27;s dog when it ran at them and then pointed his rifle at Weaver&#x27;s 14-year-old son, Samuel, who was armed. Samuel fired back at the marshals, and was shot in the back and killed by the team. In the ensuing exchange of fire, Weaver&#x27;s friend Kevin Harris shot and killed Deputy Marshal William Francis Degan Jr. Weaver, Harris, and members of Weaver&#x27;s immediate family refused to surrender. The Hostage Rescue Team of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI HRT) became involved as the siege was mounted. In the standoff, FBI sniper Lon Horiuchi shot Weaver, then shot Harris, but the second shot also hit and killed Weaver&#x27;s wife Vicki. The conflict was ultimately resolved by civilian negotiators, including veteran activist Bo Gritz, who eventually convinced them to surrender. Harris surrendered and was arrested on August 30; Weaver and his three daughters surrendered the next day.

Extensive litigation followed. Initially, Randy Weaver and Harris were tried on a variety of federal criminal charges, including first-degree murder for the death of Degan. In the successful defense, Weaver&#x27;s attorney Gerry Spence accused the agencies that were involved of criminal wrongdoing, in particular the FBI, the USMS, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), and the United States Attorney&#x27;s Office (USAO) for Idaho. Harris and Weaver were acquitted of all the siege-related charges, and Weaver was only found guilty of violating his bail terms and of failing to appear for a court hearing, both related to the original federal firearms charges. The Weaver family and Harris both filed civil suits against the federal government in response to the firefight and the siege. In August 1995, the Weavers won a combined out-of-court settlement of $3.1 million; Harris was awarded a $380,000 settlement in September 2000. In 1997, a Boundary County prosecutor indicted Horiuchi for the manslaughter of Vicki, but the county&#x27;s new prosecutor controversially closed the case, judging that he would be unlikely to secure a conviction.

The behavior of federal agents during these events drew intense scrutiny. At the end of Weaver&#x27;s trial, the Department of Justice&#x27;s Office of Professional Responsibility formed the Ruby Ridge Task Force (RRTF) in an attempt to investigate Spence&#x27;s charges; their report raised questions about all of the participating agencies&#x27; conduct and policies. Another inquiry was led by the Senate Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology, and Government Information, which held hearings between September 6 and October 19, 1995. It issued a report in which it called for reforms in federal law enforcement in an attempt to prevent a repeat of the losses of life at Ruby Ridge and to restore the public&#x27;s confidence. Several documentaries and books were produced on the siege. The law enforcement&#x27;s response at Ruby Ridge and during the Waco siege roughly six months later were both cited by Timothy McVeigh as his motivation to carry out the Oklahoma City bombing with Terry Nichols.

== Geography ==
Ruby Ridge is the southernmost of four ridges that extend east from the Bottleneck/Roman Nose mountain range toward the Kootenai River. Caribou Ridge lies north of it, and the area between them drains into the Ruby Creek. Weaver insisted that his cabin, located north of the creek, was on Caribou Ridge, and that &quot;Ruby Ridge&quot; was a press invention. Both ridge names predate the Weavers&#x27; arrival, as noted in a Forest Service report on the 1967 Sundance Fire. The standoff occurred approximately from the nearest incorporated city of Bonners Ferry and approximately south of the border with Canada (British Columbia).

== Development ==

Randy Weaver, a former Iowa factory worker and U.S. Army soldier, moved with his wife and four children to northern Idaho during the 1980s so they could &quot;home-school his children and escape what he and his wife Vicki saw as a corrupted world.&quot; In 1978, Vicki, the religious leader of the family, began to have recurrent dreams of living on a mountaintop and believed that the apocalypse was imminent. After the birth of their son, Samuel, the Weavers began selling their belongings and visited the Amish to learn how to live without electricity. They bought of land on Ruby Ridge in 1983 and began building a cabin; the property was in Boundary County on a hillside on Ruby Creek opposite Caribou Ridge, northwest of nearby Naples.

In 1984, Randy Weaver and his neighbor Terry Kinnison had a dispute over a $3,000 land deal. Kinnison lost the ensuing lawsuit and was ordered to pay Weaver an additional $2,100 in court costs and damages. Kinnison wrote letters to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Secret Service, and the county sheriff in which he alleged that Weaver had threatened to kill Pope John Paul II, President Ronald Reagan, and Idaho Governor John V. Evans.

In January 1985, the FBI and the Secret Service launched an investigation into allegations that Weaver had made threats against Reagan and other government and law enforcement officials. On February 12, Weaver and his wife were interviewed by two FBI agents, two Secret Service agents, and the Boundary County sheriff and his chief investigator. The Secret Service had been told that Weaver was a member of Aryan Nations (an antisemitic, neo-Nazi, white supremacist terrorist organization) and that he had a large weapons cache at his residence. Weaver denied these allegations, and the government filed no charges. On three or four occasions, the Weavers had attended Aryan Nations meetings at Hayden Lake, where there was a compound for government resisters and white supremacists/separatists.

The investigation noted that Weaver associated with Frank Kumnick, who was known to associate with members of Aryan Nations. Weaver told the investigators that neither he nor Kumnick was a member of Aryan Nations but he stated that Kumnick was &quot;associated with The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord.&quot; On February 28, Randy and Vicki Weaver filed an affidavit with the county courthouse alleging that their personal enemies were plotting to provoke the FBI into attacking and killing the Weaver family. On May 6, the Weavers sent President Reagan a letter claiming that their enemies may have sent Reagan a threatening letter under a forged signature. In 1992, the prosecutor cited the 1985 letter as an overt act of the Weaver family conspiracy against the federal government.

=== ATF involvement ===
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) first became aware of Weaver in July 1986, when he was introduced to a confidential ATF informant at a meeting at the World Aryan Congress. The informant portrayed himself as a weapons dealer working with motorcycle gangs. Weaver had been invited to the meeting by Kumnick, the original target of the ATF investigation. It was Weaver&#x27;s first time at this Congress. Over the next three years, Weaver and the informant met several times. In July 1989, Weaver invited the informant to his home to discuss forming a group to fight the &quot;Zionist Organized Government&quot;, referring to the U.S. government.

In October 1989, the ATF claimed that Weaver sold the informant two sawed-off shotguns, with the overall length of the guns shorter than the limit set by federal law. In November 1989, Weaver accused the ATF informant of being a spy for the police; Weaver later wrote he had been warned by &quot;Rico V.&quot; The informant&#x27;s handler, Herb Byerly, ordered him to have no further contact with Weaver. Eventually, FBI informant Rico Valentino outed the ATF informant to Aryan Nations security.

In June 1990, Byerly attempted to use the sawed-off shotgun charge as leverage to get Weaver to act as an informant for his investigation into Aryan Nations. Weaver refused to become a &quot;snitch&quot;, and the ATF filed the gun charges in June 1990. The ATF alleged that Weaver was a bank robber with criminal convictions. (Those claims were false: at that time Weaver had no criminal record. The 1995 Senate investigation found: &quot;Weaver was not a suspect in any bank robberies.&quot;) A federal grand jury indicted Weaver in December 1990 for making and possessing, but not for selling, illegal weapons in October 1989.

The ATF concluded it would be too dangerous for agents to arrest Weaver at his property. In January 1991, ATF agents posed as broken-down motorists and arrested Weaver when he and Vicki stopped to assist. Weaver was told of the charges against him, released on bail, and told that his trial would begin on February 19, 1991. On January 22, the judge in the case appointed attorney Everett Hofmeister as Weaver&#x27;s legal representative. The same day, Weaver called probation officer Karl Richins and told him that he had been instructed to contact Richins on that date. Richins did not have the case file at that time, so he asked Weaver to leave his contact information and said he would contact him when he received the paperwork. According to Richins, Weaver did not give him a telephone number. Hofmeister sent Weaver letters on January 19, January 31, and February 5, asking Weaver to contact him to work on his defense within the federal court system.

On February 5, the trial date was changed from February 19 to 20 to give participants more travel time following a federal holiday. The court clerk sent the parties a letter informing them of the date change, but the notice was not sent directly to Weaver, only to Hofmeister. On February 7, Richins sent Weaver a letter indicating that he had the case file and needed to talk with Weaver. This letter erroneously said that Weaver&#x27;s trial date was March 20. On February 8, Hofmeister again attempted to contact Weaver by letter informing him that the trial was to begin on February 20 and that Weaver needed to contact him immediately. Hofmeister also made several calls to individuals who knew Weaver, asking them to have Weaver call him. Hofmeister told U.S. District Court Judge Harold Lyman Ryan that he had been unable to reach Weaver before the scheduled court date.

When Weaver did not appear in court on February 20, Ryan issued a bench warrant for failure to appear in court. On February 26, Ken Keller, a reporter for the &quot;Kootenai Valley Times&quot;, telephoned the U.S. Probation Office and asked whether Weaver did not show in court on February 20 because the letter Richins sent him had an incorrect date. Upon finding a copy of the letter, the Chief Probation Officer, Terrence Hummel, contacted Ryan&#x27;s clerk and informed them of the incorrect date in the letter. Hummel also contacted the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) and Weaver&#x27;s attorney, informing them both of the error. Judge Ryan, however, refused to withdraw the bench warrant.

The USMS agreed to put off executing the warrant until after March 20 in order to see whether Weaver would show up in court on that day. If he were to show up on March 20, the Department of Justice claimed that all indications are that the warrant would have been dropped. But instead, the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office (USAO) called a grand jury on March 14. The USAO did not inform the grand jury of Richins&#x27;s letter and the grand jury issued an indictment for failure to appear.

=== U.S. Marshals Service involvement ===
When the Weaver case passed from the ATF to the USMS, no one informed the marshals that the ATF had attempted to solicit Weaver as an informant.

As the law enforcement arm of the federal courts, the USMS were responsible to arrest and bring in Weaver, now considered a fugitive. Weaver simply stayed in his remote home, threatening to resist any attempt to take him by force.

Weaver was known to have an intense distrust of government. The erroneous Richins letter is believed to have compounded this sentiment and may have contributed to Weaver&#x27;s reluctance to appear for trial. He was suspicious of what he thought were inconsistent messages from the government and his lawyer; he began to think there was a conspiracy against him. Weaver came to believe that he would not receive a fair trial if he were to appear in court. His distrust grew even further when Hofmeister erroneously told him that if he lost the trial, he would lose his land, essentially leaving Vicki homeless, and that the government would take away his children.

USMS officers made a series of attempts to have Weaver surrender peacefully, but he refused to leave his cabin. Weaver negotiated with U.S. Marshals Ron Evans, W. Warren Mays, and David Hunt through third parties from March 5 to October 12, 1991, when Assistant U.S. Attorney Ron Howen directed that the negotiations cease. The U.S. Attorney directed that all negotiations go through Hofmeister, but Weaver refused to talk with him. Marshals began preparing plans to capture Weaver to stand trial on the weapons charges and his failure to appear at the correct trial date.

Although marshals stopped the negotiations as ordered, they made other contact. On March 4, 1992, U.S. Marshals Ron Evans and Jack Cluff drove to the Weaver property and spoke with Weaver, posing as real-estate prospects. At a March 27, 1992, meeting at USMS headquarters, Art Roderick code-named the operation &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;. Surveillance teams were dispatched and cameras set up to record activity at Weaver&#x27;s residence. Marshals observed that Weaver and his family responded to vehicles and other visitors by taking up armed positions around the cabin until the visitors were recognized.

=== Threat source profile ===
Beginning in February 1991, the USMS developed a Threat Source Profile on Weaver. Agents&#x27; failure to integrate new information into that profile was criticized in a 1995 report by a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee:

The Subcommittee is ... concerned that, as Marshals investigating the Weaver case learned facts that contradicted information they previously had been provided, they did not adequately integrate their updated knowledge into their overall assessment of who Randy Weaver was or what threat he might pose. If the Marshals made any attempt to assess the credibility of the various people who gave them information about Weaver, they never recorded their assessments. Thus, rather than maintaining the Threat Source Profile as a living document, the Marshals added new reports to an ever-expanding file, and their overall assessment never really changed. These problems rendered it difficult for other law enforcement officials to assess the Weaver case accurately without the benefit of first-hand briefings from persons who had continuing involvement with him.
Many of the people the USMS used as third party go-betweens on the Weaver case—Bill and Judy Grider, Alan Jeppeson, and Richard Butler—were assessed by the Marshals as more radical than the Weavers. When Deputy U.S. Marshal (DUSM) Dave Hunt asked Grider, &quot;Why shouldn&#x27;t I just go up there ... and talk to him?&quot;, Grider replied, &quot;Let me put it to you this way. If I was sitting on my property and somebody with a gun comes to do me harm, then I&#x27;ll probably shoot him.&quot;
The Subcommittee said that the profile included &quot;a brief psychological profile completed by a person who had conducted no firsthand interviews and was so unfamiliar with the case that he referred to Weaver as &#x27;Mr. Randall&#x27; throughout&quot;. A later memo circulated within the Justice Department opined that:
A review of Weaver&#x27;s DD-214 in an investigation after the events of Ruby Ridge revealed that Weaver had never been a Green Beret or a member of the Special Forces; it was possible he had received some general demolition training as a &quot;combat engineer.&quot;

=== Rivera helicopter incident ===
Following a flyover by a hired helicopter for Geraldo Rivera&#x27;s &quot;Now It Can Be Told&quot; television show on April 18, 1992, the USMS received media reports that Weaver had shot at the helicopter. That day in Idaho, U.S. Marshals were installing surveillance cameras overlooking the Weaver property. In a field report dated April 18, 1992, Marshal W. Warren Mays noted the sighting of a helicopter near the Weaver property but did not report hearing any gunfire. In an interview with a Coeur D&#x27;Alene newspaper, Weaver denied that anyone had fired at the helicopter. When interviewed by the FBI, the helicopter pilot Richard Weiss said that Weaver had not fired on his helicopter. The &quot;Report of the RRTF to the OPR&quot; (1994) said, when the &quot;indictment [of Weaver] was presented to the grand jury, the prosecution had evidence that no shots had been fired at the helicopter.&quot;

Media reports that Weaver had fired on the Rivera helicopter became part of the justification later cited by U.S. Marshal Wayne &quot;Duke&quot; Smith and FBI HRT Commander Richard Rogers in drawing up the Ruby Ridge rules of engagement on August 21–22, 1992. Also, in spite of Weiss&#x27;s repeated denials that shots had been fired at his helicopter, Howen charged that, as Overt Act 32 of the Weavers&#x27; Conspiracy Against the Federal Government, Randy, Vicki, and Harris fired two shots at the Rivera helicopter.

Operation &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; was suspended for three months due to the confirmation hearings for United States Marshals Service Director Henry E. Hudson.

==Encounter near Weaver&#x27;s cabin==
On August 21, 1992, six Marshals were sent to scout the area to determine suitable places away from the cabin to apprehend and arrest Weaver. The marshals, dressed in military camouflage, were equipped with night-vision goggles and M16 rifles. DUSMs Art Roderick, Larry Cooper, and William F. &quot;Bill&quot; Degan formed the reconnaissance team, while DUSMs David Hunt, Joseph Thomas, and Frank Norris formed an observation post (OP) team on the ridge north of the cabin.

At one point, Roderick threw two rocks at the Weaver cabin to test the dog&#x27;s reaction. Later, the dog, &quot;Striker&quot; began following the agents. Weaver&#x27;s friend, Kevin Harris, and Weaver&#x27;s 14-year-old son, Samuel, emerged and followed Striker to investigate. Harris and the younger Weaver said that they were hoping the dog had noticed a game animal as the cabin was out of meat. The recon team (Roderick, Cooper, and Degan) initially retreated through the woods in radio contact with the OP team, but later took up hidden defensive positions.
Later, the OP team and the Weavers claimed the dogs were alerted to the recon team in the woods after neighbors at the foot of the mountain started their pickup truck. Samuel and Harris followed Striker on foot through the woods while Randy, also on foot, took a separate logging trail; Vicki, Sara, Rachel, and baby Elisheba remained at the cabin. The OP team were anxious at first, but then relaxed. Randy encountered the Marshals at the &quot;Y&quot;; Roderick claimed to have yelled, &quot;Back off! U.S. Marshal!&quot; upon sighting Weaver, and Cooper said he had shouted, &quot;Stop! U.S. Marshal!&quot; By their account, Samuel and Striker came out of the woods about a minute later. When the Marshals&#x27; position was revealed by the dog &quot;Striker&quot;, a yellow Labrador Retriever, DUSM Roderick shot and killed the dog. Seeing this, Samuel Weaver reportedly said to the Marshals, &quot;You&#x27;ve killed my dog, you son of a bitch!&quot;, and then shot in the direction of Roderick. DUSM Cooper then shot towards Samuel Weaver and Kevin Harris, who both sought cover. Harris, once finding cover behind a tree stump, then returned fire with a shot that killed DUSM William Francis &quot;Bill&quot; Degan Jr. Samuel Weaver, now retreating up a hill, was then shot in the back and killed by DUSM Cooper.

A later ballistics report showed that nineteen rounds were fired during the fight. DUSM Roderick fired one shot from an M16A1 (which killed &quot;Striker&quot;, the dog, by entering his body two inches from the dog&#x27;s anus, and exiting the chest), then Samuel fired three from a .223 Ruger Mini-14 (at Roderick), Degan fired seven from an M16 (at Harris and Weaver, while moving at least ), and Cooper fired six from a 9 mm Colt submachine gun (at Harris and Weaver), Harris then fired two from a .30-06 M1917 Enfield Rifle (striking and killing DUSM Degan). After the federal agents began firing, Samuel was killed by a shot to the back while retreating. Harris had fired the shot which killed DUSM Degan.

The origin of the shot that killed Samuel was of critical concern in all investigations. At the time of the writing of the &quot;Ruby Ridge: Report&quot; (1996), the Senate Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Government Information, chaired by Senator Arlen Specter, observed that the government&#x27;s position at trial was that Cooper had fired the shot. The Subcommittee engaged additional experts and ultimately declined to draw a final conclusion. The Justice Department&#x27;s Ruby Ridge Task Force (RRTF) report to the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR, 1994) states:

 It was concluded there was no indication he intended to kill or injure Weaver.

Reporter Jess Walter, in his work &quot;Ruby Ridge: The Truth and Tragedy of the Randy Weaver Family&quot; concludes that Cooper fired the bullet that killed Samuel Weaver.

In 1997, Boundary County Sheriff Greg Sprungl conducted an independent search of the &quot;Y&quot;, and his investigator, Lucien Haag, discovered and confirmed that a bullet found in that search matched DUSM Cooper&#x27;s 9 mm Colt submachine gun and contained fibers that matched Samuel&#x27;s shirt, conclusively proving DUSM Cooper shot Weaver in the back as he retreated.

Harris&#x27;s and the federal agents&#x27; accounts differ as to who fired first. In the 1993 trial over charges in Degan&#x27;s death, prosecutors alleged that Harris had fired the first shot. Harris asserted self-defense and was acquitted.

On cross-examination by the defense, ballistics experts called by the prosecution testified that the physical evidence contradicted neither the prosecution&#x27;s nor the defense&#x27;s theories of the gunfight. Martin Fackler testified that Roderick fired the shot or shots that killed Striker, that Degan fired the shot that hit Samuel in the right elbow, that Harris shot and killed Degan, and that Cooper &quot;probably&quot; shot and killed Samuel. 

Roderick and Cooper stated that Striker, the dog, emerged from the woods ahead of Harris and Samuel. According to their account, Degan confronted Harris, who then turned and fatally shot Degan before Degan could fire. Roderick claimed he shot the dog once, after which Samuel fired twice at him, prompting Roderick to return fire. Both Roderick and Cooper testified that they heard multiple gunshots from the Weaver group. Cooper further testified that he fired two three-shot bursts at Harris, causing Harris to fall &quot;like a sack of potatoes,&quot; with leaves flying up in front of him, likely from the impact of a round. After taking cover, Cooper stated that he saw Samuel flee and radioed OP team member Dave Hunt, reporting that he had either wounded or killed Harris.

As described by Randy and Sara Weaver, in their book &quot;The Federal Siege&quot; (1998), Harris&#x27;s version of events differed, as follows. Harris told them Striker was followed out of the woods by Samuel and Harris, and that the dog ran up to Cooper. He said the dog ran to Roderick, who shot it in front of Samuel. Samuel yelled, &quot;You shot my dog, you son of a bitch!&quot;, and fired a shot at Roderick. Harris said that Degan came out of the woods and shot Samuel in the arm. Harris fired and hit Degan in the chest. According to the Weavers, Harris said that Cooper fired at Harris, who ducked for cover, and Cooper fired again, hitting Samuel in the back, who fell. Harris fired about 6 feet (2 m) in front of Cooper, forcing him to take cover. Only then did he hear Cooper identify himself as a U.S. Marshal. Harris said he checked Samuel and found him dead, and ran to the Weavers&#x27; cabin.

After the firefight at the &quot;Y&quot;, Hunt and Thomas went to a neighbor&#x27;s house to call for assistance from the USMS Crisis Center. Norris, Cooper, and Roderick stayed with Degan&#x27;s body at the &quot;Y&quot;. Randy and Vicki went to the &quot;Y&quot; and retrieved Samuel&#x27;s body. Randy, Vicki and Harris placed the body in a guest cabin near the main cabin. From 11:15 a.m. onward, Hunt reported to the Crisis Center in Washington, D.C., that no further gunfire was heard.

== Siege and controversy ==

In the aftermath of the gunfight on August 21 at 11:20 am PDT, DUSM Hunt requested immediate support from Idaho law enforcement, and he also alerted the FBI by notifying it that a Marshal had been killed. Following Hunt&#x27;s phone call, the Marshals Service Crisis Center was activated under the direction of Duke Smith, associate director for Operations. The Marshals Service Special Operations Group (SOG) was alerted to deploy. In response to the USMS call, the Boundary County sheriff&#x27;s office mobilized. Also in response to the USMS request, Idaho Governor Cecil Andrus declared a state of emergency in Boundary County, allowing use of the Idaho National Guard Armory at Bonners Ferry and, after an initial delay, to use National Guard armored personnel carriers (APCs). Soon thereafter, the Idaho State Police arrived at the scene.

FBI Headquarters in Washington, DC, responded by sending the Hostage Rescue Team (HRT) from Quantico to Idaho. Special Agent in Charge (SAC) Eugene Glenn of the Salt Lake City FBI office was appointed Site Commander with responsibility for all active individuals from the FBI, ATF, and USMS. A stand-off ensued for eleven days, as several hundred federal agents surrounded the house, and negotiations for a surrender were attempted.

=== Special ROE and sniper/observer deployment ===
By Saturday, August 22, special rules of engagement (ROE) were drafted and approved by FBI Headquarters and the Marshal Service for use on Ruby Ridge. According to the later RRTF report to the DOJ (1994), the Ruby Ridge ROE were as follows:

# &quot;If any adult in the area around the cabin is observed with a weapon after the surrender announcement had been made, deadly force could and should be used to neutralize the individual.&quot;
# &quot;If any adult male is observed with a weapon prior to the announcement deadly force can and should be employed if the shot could be taken without endangering any children.&quot;
# &quot;If compromised by any dog the dog can be taken out.&quot;
# &quot;Any subjects other than Randy Weaver, Vicki Weaver, Kevin Harris presenting threat of death or grievous bodily harm FBI rules of deadly force apply. Deadly force can be utilized to prevent the death or grievous bodily injury to oneself or that of another.&quot;

(From the sworn statement of FBI SAC Eugene Glenn).

As noted in a footnote to the report in this crucial section:

The ROE were communicated to agents on site, including communication to HRT sniper/observers prior to deployment, communications that included the change of &quot;adult&quot; to &quot;adult male&quot; to exclude Vicki Weaver. Some deployed FBI agents, in particular the sniper/observers, would later describe the adopted ROE as a &quot;green light&quot; to &quot;shoot on sight&quot;.

On Wednesday, August 26, four days after Vicki was killed, the ROE that had been in effect since the arrival of the HRT were revoked. Per Glenn&#x27;s direction, the FBI&#x27;s Standard Deadly Force Policy replaced the ROE to guide the law enforcement personnel that were to be deployed to the cabin perimeter. The FBI rules of deadly force in effect in 1992 stated that:

This was in stark contrast to the permissive ROE adopted for the Ruby Ridge stand-off.

=== Deployment of sniper/observers, ROE understanding ===
On August 22, the second day of the siege, between 2:30 and 3:30 pm, the FBI HRT sniper/observer teams were briefed and deployed to the cabin on foot.

According to the RRTF report to the DOJ, there were various views and interpretations taken of these ROEs by members of FBI SWAT teams in action at the Ruby Ridge site. Denver SWAT team leader Gregory Sexton described them as &quot;severe&quot; and &quot;inappropriate.&quot; Two members of the Denver SWAT team said they were &quot;strong&quot; and a &quot;departure from the ... standard deadly force policy&quot;, &quot;inappropriate&quot;, and of a sort one &quot;had never been given&quot; before. The latter of these two members said that &quot;other SWAT team members were taken aback by the Rules and that most of them clung to the FBI&#x27;s standard deadly force policy.&quot; Another team member responded to the briefing on the ROE with &quot;[y]ou&#x27;ve gotta be kidding.&quot;

But most of the FBI HRT sniper/observers accepted the ROE as modifying the deadly force policy. According to later interviews, HRT sniper Dale Monroe saw the ROE as a &quot;green light&quot; to shoot armed adult males on sight, and HRT sniper Edward Wenger believed that if he observed armed adults, he could use deadly force, but he was to follow standard deadly force policy for all other individuals. Fred Lanceley, the FBI Hostage Negotiator at Ruby Ridge, was &quot;surprised and shocked&quot; at the ROE, the most severe rules he had heard in more than 300 hostage situations. He later characterized the ROE as being inconsistent with standard policy. The 1996 Senate report criticized the ROE as &quot;virtual shoot-on-sight orders.&quot;

=== Sniper shoots: R. Weaver is wounded, V. Weaver is killed ===
Before the negotiators arrived at the cabin, FBI sniper Lon Horiuchi, from a position over north and above the Weaver cabin, shot and wounded Randy Weaver in the back with the bullet exiting his right armpit, while he was lifting the latch on the shed to visit the body of his dead son. (The sniper testified at the later trial that he had put his crosshairs on Weaver&#x27;s spine, but Weaver moved at the last second.) As Weaver, his 16-year-old daughter Sara, and Harris ran back toward the cabin, Horiuchi fired a second bullet, wounding Harris in the chest. This bullet killed Vicki Weaver, who was standing behind the door of the cabin when Harris entered. Vicki was holding the Weavers&#x27; 10-month-old baby Elisheba.

=== Constitutionality of the second shot ===
The RRTF report to the DOJ&#x27;s Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) of June 1994 stated unequivocally in conclusion (in its executive summary) that the rules that allowed the second shot to have been made did not satisfy constitutional standards for legal use of deadly force. The 1996 report of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee&#x27;s Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Government Information, Arlen Specter [R-PA], chair, concurred, with Senator Dianne Feinstein [D-CA] dissenting. The DOJ&#x27;s RRTF report said that the lack of a request for surrender before Agent Horiuchi&#x27;s second shot was &quot;inexcusable&quot;, as Harris and the Weavers were running for cover at the time and did not pose an imminent threat.

The later Justice task force criticized Horiuchi for firing through the door, when he did not know if anyone was on the other side of it. While there is a dispute as to who approved the rules of engagement which Horiuchi followed, the task force condemned the rules of engagement that allowed shots to be fired without a request for surrender.

=== Situational reevaluation, ROE is suspended, the siege ends ===
The FBI&#x27;s HQ and the Site Commanders in Idaho both re-evaluated the situation based on information about what had happened on August 21 which they were receiving from U.S. Marshals Hunt, Cooper and Roderick. On August 23, repeated attempts to negotiate with Weaver via a bullhorn failed; there was no response from the cabin.

On about Monday, August 24, the fourth day of the siege, FBI Deputy Assistant Director Danny Coulson, who did not know that Vicki Weaver had been killed, wrote a memo about the Weavers&#x27; legal position. The memo is recorded in the 1996 report (although it is unclear whether the Senate Subcommittee or Coulson himself censored the word &quot;shit&quot;):

The stand-off was ultimately resolved by civilian negotiators including Bo Gritz, to whom Weaver agreed to speak. The wounded Harris, who had earlier urged Weaver for a mercy killing, was convinced by Gritz&#x27;s mediation to surrender on Sunday, August 30. Harris was removed from the property via stretcher and was then flown by a medical evacuation helicopter (a Bell UH-1N belonging to the U.S. Air Force) to Sacred Heart Medical Center in Spokane. Weaver allowed the removal of his wife&#x27;s body, which Gritz oversaw.
The FBI HRT Commander gave Gritz a deadline to get the remaining Weavers to surrender, and if they did not surrender on the day of the deadline, he said he would resolve the standoff by launching a tactical assault. Weaver and his daughters surrendered the next day; both Harris and Weaver were arrested. Harris was in serious condition at Sacred Heart, but U.S. Marshals did not allow his parents to see him (or talk by telephone) until Monday evening, after a federal court order was issued. Weaver&#x27;s daughters were released to the custody of relatives. Federal officials considered charging Sara, who was 16, as an adult.

Weaver was transferred by military helicopter to the airport at Sandpoint and from there he was flown by USMS jet to Boise. There he was given a brief medical examination at St. Luke&#x27;s Medical Center. He was held at the Ada County jail and arraigned in federal court the following day, Tuesday, September 1.

== Trials of Weaver and Harris ==
Weaver and Harris were charged with a variety of offenses; their trial in U.S. District Court in Boise began in April 1993, and it was presided over by Judge Edward Lodge. In mid-June, Weaver&#x27;s defense attorney, Gerry Spence, rested his case without calling any witnesses for the defense. Instead, he sought to convince the jury through cross-examination which was aimed at discrediting the government&#x27;s evidence and witnesses. In July, Weaver was ultimately acquitted of all of the charges except the charge which he incurred after he missed his original court date and the charge of violating his bail conditions, for which he was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment and fined $10,000 in October. Credited with time served and good behavior, Weaver served less than 16 months and he was released from the Canyon County jail in Caldwell in mid-December.

Harris was defended by attorney David Nevin and he was acquitted of all of the charges. Exactly five years after the incident (August 21, 1997), he was indicted for the first-degree murder of DUSM Bill Degan by Boundary County prosecutor Denise Woodbury, but the charge was dismissed in early October on grounds of double jeopardy, because he had been acquitted of the same charge in the federal criminal trial in 1993.

== Federal investigations of law enforcement ==

Defense counsels for Weaver and Harris alleged throughout their 1993 trial that agents of the ATF, USMS, and FBI were themselves guilty of serious wrongdoing. The Department of Justice (DOJ) created the Ruby Ridge Task Force (RRTF) to investigate events. It delivered a 542-page report on June 10, 1994, to the DOJ Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR). (This RRTF report, originally available in a highly redacted form, later became available in a much more complete form.)

Questions persisted about Ruby Ridge and the subsequent Waco siege, which involved the same agencies and many of the same officials. The Senate Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Government Information held fourteen days of hearings on these incidents and allegations of misconduct, ending on October 19, 1995. The hearings were televised on C-SPAN. The internal 1994 Ruby Ridge Task Force Report and the public 1995 Senate subcommittee report on Ruby Ridge both criticized the rules of engagement by claiming that they were unconstitutional.

A 1995 GAO investigation was conducted on the policies regarding use of force by federal law enforcement agencies. Its report said: &quot;In October 1995, Treasury and Justice adopted use of deadly force policies to standardize the various policies their component agencies had adopted over the years.&quot; The major change was that agencies required a law enforcement agent to have reasonable belief of an &quot;imminent&quot; danger of death or serious physical injury in order to use deadly force. This brought all federal LEA deadly force policies in line with the U.S. Supreme Court rulings &quot;Tennessee v. Garner&quot;, 471 U.S. 1, 18 (1985) and &quot;Graham v. Connor&quot;, 490 U.S. 386 (1989), which applied to state and local law enforcement agencies.

In 1997, Michael Kahoe, the chief of the FBI&#x27;s violent crimes section, pled guilty to obstruction of justice for destroying a report which was critical of the agency&#x27;s role at Ruby Ridge. He was sentenced to 18 months and a $4,000 fine.

== Civil suits ==
Randy Weaver and his daughters filed a wrongful death suit for $200 million which was related to the killing of his wife and son. In an out-of-court settlement in August 1995, the federal government awarded Randy Weaver $100,000 and it also awarded $1 million to each of his three daughters. The government did not admit that it had committed any wrongdoing in relation to the deaths of Samuel and Vicki. On the condition of anonymity, a DOJ official told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that he believed that the Weavers would have probably won the full amount if the case had gone to trial.

The attorney for Harris pressed Harris&#x27;s civil suit for damages, but federal officials vowed that they would never pay someone who had killed a U.S. Marshal. In September 2000, Harris was awarded a $380,000 settlement by the government.

== Criminal charges ==
In 1997, Boundary County prosecutor Denise Woodbury indicted FBI HRT sniper Lon Horiuchi for manslaughter on state charges, just before the statute of limitations for this crime expired. She appointed a special prosecutor to conduct the case. But in 1998 the trial was removed to federal court because Horiuchi had been acting in the line of duty as a federal law enforcement officer. Judge Lodge quickly dismissed the case on grounds of sovereign immunity.

The decision to dismiss charges was reversed (6–5) in 2001 by an &quot;en banc&quot; panel of the Ninth Circuit, which held that enough uncertainty about the facts of the case existed for Horiuchi to stand trial on state manslaughter charges. Boundary County prosecutor Brett Benson, who had defeated Woodbury in the May 2000 primary and won the November election, decided to drop the case. He said he believed that it was unlikely the state could prove the criminal charges, and too much time had passed. He also believed his decision would enable the process of healing in the county. Attorney Stephen Yagman, who had been appointed as the special prosecutor, said that he vehemently disagreed with the decision. He suggested that the case could still be prosecuted if the Boundary County prosecutor later changed again.

== Later life of the Weavers ==
Randy Weaver and his daughter Sara wrote &quot;The Federal Siege at Ruby Ridge&quot; (1998), about the incident, which was published in paperback.

The Weaver family, including Randy, later moved to Kalispell, Montana. Sara and the other two Weaver daughters are employed there. In 2012, after she became a born again Christian, Sara Weaver said that she forgives the federal agents who killed her mother and brother.

Randy Weaver died on May 11, 2022, at the age of 74.

== Domestic terrorism ==

American domestic terrorists Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols claimed that their desire for revenge for the federal government&#x27;s poor handling of the Ruby Ridge and Waco sieges motivated them to perpetrate the Oklahoma City bombing. On April 19, 1995, the second anniversary of the fire that ended the Waco siege, they detonated a truck bomb in front of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building during business hours. 168 people were killed and 680 people were injured, mostly US government employees. 19 of the victims were babies and children, many in the building&#x27;s day-care center. The effects of the blast were equivalent to over 5,000 pounds (2,300 kg) of TNT, and could be heard and felt up to 55 miles (89 km) away; over a third of the building was destroyed.

== In popular culture ==
A CBS miniseries about the Ruby Ridge incident, titled &quot;Ruby Ridge: An American Tragedy&quot;, aired on May 19 and 21, 1996. It was based on the book &quot;Every Knee Shall Bow&quot; by reporter Jess Walter. It starred Laura Dern as Vicki, Kirsten Dunst as Sara, and Randy Quaid as Randy. Later that year the television series was adapted as a full-length TV movie, &quot;The Siege at Ruby Ridge&quot;.

In 1999, bluegrass musician Peter Rowan addressed the events at Ruby Ridge in his song &quot;The Ballad of Ruby Ridge&quot;.

Ruby Ridge was the subject of &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;, Season Three, episode 7, &quot;Identity&quot; (2007). Agent David Rossi says that he was at Ruby Ridge during the siege.

In 2017, it was the focus of the 323rd episode of &quot;American Experience&quot;, the 5th episode of its 29th season.

The standoff, including the shooting of Vicki Weaver, is featured in the first episode of the Paramount Network television miniseries &quot;Waco&quot; (2018).

Tara Westover, in her memoir &quot;Educated&quot; (2018), referred to this incident, noting her own family&#x27;s preparations to defend their isolated home against a potential siege by &quot;the Feds&quot;.

The Ruby Ridge incident was the subject of the first season of the narrative podcast series &quot;Slate Presents&quot;. The four-episode season, titled &quot;Standoff: What Happened at Ruby Ridge?&quot; ran as a stand-alone miniseries hosted by journalist Ruth Graham.

In 2020, the incident was featured in a season of Fox Nation&#x27;s &quot;Scandalous&quot;.

<text>Sir Bernard Rowland Crick (16 December 1929 – 19 December 2008) was a British political theorist and democratic socialist whose views can be summarised as &quot;politics is ethics done in public&quot;. He sought to arrive at a &quot;politics of action&quot;, as opposed to a &quot;politics of thought&quot; or of ideology, and he held that He was a leading critic of behaviouralism.

==Career==
Crick was born in England, the son of Harry Edgar and Florence Clara Crick, and educated at Whitgift School. He read Economics at University College London, obtaining a Bachelor of Science degree, before transferring to the London School of Economics for doctoral study. While working on his Ph.D.—published in 1958 as &quot;The American Science of Politics&quot;—he was a Teaching Fellow at Harvard (1952–1954), Assistant Professor at McGill (1954–1955), and Visiting Fellow at Berkeley (1955–1956). Returning to the United Kingdom in 1956, he obtained his Ph.D. at the LSE and was appointed to an Assistant and later a Senior Lectureship, 1957–1965.

During his period at the LSE, recollections of which appear in his contribution to &quot;My LSE&quot;, Crick craved for greater recognition than his Senior Lecturership signified. LSE&#x27;s promotion system was notoriously slow at the time. When appointed Professor of Political Theory and Political Institutions at Sheffield in 1965, Crick told &quot;Beaver&quot;, the LSE student newspaper, that he was &quot;going to a better place from the point of view of teaching students&quot;. 

Crick was an advisor to British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock during the 1980s. When Labour came to power in 1997, Crick was appointed by his former student David Blunkett to head up an advisory group on citizenship education. The group&#x27;s final report in 1998, known as the Crick Report, led to the introduction of citizenship as a core subject in the National Curriculum. He was knighted in the 2002 new years honours list for &quot;services to citizenship in schools and to political studies&quot;. He authored the 2004 Home Office book &quot;Life in the United Kingdom: A Journey to Citizenship&quot;, which forms the basis for the new citizenship test required by all people naturalising as British citizens.

He taught at the University of Sheffield (1965–1971). and founded a Department of Politics and Sociology, later the Department of Politics, at Birkbeck College, University of London in 1972.

Crick co-authored, with David Millar, an influential pamphlet entitled &quot;Making Scotland&#x27;s Parliament Work&quot;. Later in his life in Scotland, Crick was delighted to be appointed Stevenson Visiting Professor at Glasgow University. Despite his frail health at that time, Crick delivered a series of widely praised and very popular public lectures. Upon his death, Glasgow University marked his contribution by establishing the Bernard Crick Memorial Lecture.

Crick made many other contributions to Scottish political life, from participating in his local Labour Party, to defending Glenogle Baths from closure, to, in his last weeks of life, penning a humorous Op-Ed for &quot;The Scotsman&quot; on the chaos caused by the tram line delays in Edinburgh.

==Private life==
Crick died from prostate cancer at the age of 79, in St. Columba&#x27;s Hospice, Edinburgh. It had been diagnosed about fourteen years earlier.

==Awards and legacy==
The PSA also created the Sir Bernard Crick Awards for Outstanding Teaching in honour of Crick and his work. Two awards are made at the PSA Annual Conference, the Main Prize, and a New Entrant Prize for early career academics. 
Crick was knighted in 2002.

After his death, the University of Sheffield established the Sir Bernard Crick Centre. The centre aims to &#x27;Bridge a number of gaps that appear to have emerged in recent decades (if not before). The first gap concerns the relationship between the governors and the governed in democratic countries.&#x27; The centre also aims to communicate social science to the public – or the social implications of &#x27;hard&#x27; scientific advances – without, in doing so, losing those elements of scholarship that provide depth and context.

Glasgow University also recognised Sir Bernard&#x27;s contribution by establishing an annual memorial lecture series.

==Work on George Orwell==
In 1974, Crick began working on a biography of George Orwell with the help of Orwell&#x27;s second wife Sonia Brownell. The hardback edition rights were used to set up a grant in conjunction with Birkbeck College to fund projects by new writers that would have interested Orwell. In 1980, just before the book was published, a friend of Crick&#x27;s, David Astor, agreed to match the grant. Over the years, there were contributions by Richard Blair, Orwell&#x27;s adopted son, and &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper, among others. Due to a lack of discernible projects, after five years the fund was diverted to produce an annual memorial lecture at Birkbeck College and the University of Sheffield, and also to provide small departmental grants. The lectures continue: they are now hosted each year by the Orwell Foundation (originally established by Crick as the Orwell Prize; see below) at University College London, home of the Orwell Archive; in November 2016 the Orwell Lecture was given by Ian Hislop. Previous lecturers include Rowan Williams and Hilary Mantel. In 2017, the Orwell Foundation and the Sir Bernard Crick Centre re-established a new Orwell Lecture in the North at the University of Sheffield: the inaugural lecture was given by Turner Prize-winning artist Grayson Perry.

In 1993, Crick established the Orwell Prize with sponsorship from &quot;The Political Quarterly&quot; to honour political writing. Initially, two awards were given out each year – one for political journalism and the other for a political book. The first awards in 1994 were received by Anatol Lieven for his book &quot;The Baltic Revolution&quot; and to &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; journalist Neal Ascherson. Crick was on the judging panel until the 2007 awards. BBC official historian Professor Jean Seaton became Director of the prize in 2006 and the prize became a registered charity (The Orwell Foundation) in 2015. The Foundation awards four Orwell Prizes – for political journalism, political writing (non-fiction only), political fiction and Exposing Britain&#x27;s Social Evils – and hosts regular debates, lectures and events, including the Orwell Lecture. Judging panels are appointed each year. In 2008, Crick became active in supporting &quot;Orwell Direct&quot;, a website dedicated to the life and works of Orwell created by Dione Venables, which later became The Orwell Society.

==Ideas==
According to Crick, the ideologically driven leader practises a form of anti-politics in which the goal is the mobilisation of the populace towards a common end—even on pain of death.

==Anti-behaviouralism==
Crick&#x27;s first book, &quot;The American Science of Politics&quot; (1959), attacked the behavioural approach to politics, which was dominant in the United States, and little known in Britain. He identified and rejected their basic premises: that research can discover uniformities in human behaviour, that these uniformities could be confirmed by empirical tests and measurements, that quantitative data was of the highest quality, and should be analysed statistically, that political science should be empirical and predictive, downplaying the philosophical and historical dimensions, and the value-free research was the ideal, with the goal of social science to be a macro theory covering all the social sciences, as opposed to applied issues of practical reform.

==Publications==
Crick&#x27;s works include:
* &quot;The American Science of Politics&quot; (1959)
* &quot;In Defence of Politics&quot; (1962, and five subsequent editions, the last in 2002)

<doc id="501393" wikidata="Q982801" url="?curid=501393" title="Wasim Akram">
<text>Wasim Akram (Punjabi, ; born 3 June 1966) is a Pakistani cricket commentator, coach, and former cricketer and captain of the Pakistan national cricket team. Akram is regarded as one of the greatest bowlers of all time. He is often revered as The Sultan of Swing.
In October 2013, Wasim Akram was the only Pakistani cricketer to be named in an to mark the 150th anniversary of &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot;. As captain, he led Pakistan to the finals of the 1999 Cricket World Cup, where they lost to Australia by 8 wickets. He was a part of the Pakistani squad which won the 1992 Cricket World Cup.

A left-arm fast bowler who could bowl with significant pace, he holds the world record for most wickets in List A cricket, with 881, and is second only to Sri Lankan off-spin bowler Muttiah Muralitharan in terms of ODI wickets, with 502 in total. He is considered to be one of the founders, and perhaps the finest exponent of, reverse swing bowling.

He was the first bowler to reach the 500-wicket mark in ODI cricket, and he did so during the 2003 World Cup. In 2002, Wisden released its only list of the best players of all time. Wasim was ranked as the best bowler in ODI of all time, with a rating of 1223.5, ahead of Allan Donald, Imran Khan, Waqar Younis, Joel Garner, Glenn McGrath and Muralitharan. Wasim took 23 four-wicket hauls in 356 ODI matches played. On 30 September 2009, Akram was one of five new members inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. He was the bowling coach of the Kolkata Knight Riders. However, he took a break from the position for IPL 6, citing a need to spend more time with family in Karachi, and he took a further break from IPL 2017; he was replaced by Lakshmipathy Balaji.

He was working as director and bowling coach of Islamabad United in Pakistan Super League until he left to join Multan Sultans in August 2017. In October 2018, he was named in the Pakistan Cricket Board&#x27;s seven-member advisory cricket committee. In November 2018, he joined PSL franchisee Karachi Kings as President.
The Government of Pakistan awarded him the Hilal-e-Imtiaz on 23 March 2019 for his lifetime achievements in the field of cricket.

== Early and personal life ==

=== Family background ===
Wasim Akram was born on 3 June 1966 to a Punjabi family in Lahore. Akram&#x27;s father, Chaudhary Muhammad Akram Arain, was originally from a village near Amritsar and the family moved to Pakistani Punjab after the partition of India in 1947. Their ancestral village is called Chawinda Devi and the family belongs to the Arain community. 

His father&#x27;s first job was as a court proofreader and he also operated an automotive spare parts business while for some time he ran a single-screen cinema, the &quot;Niagara&quot;, located in the Ferozepur Road, because of which Akram would develop an early love for Hindi cinema.

His mother&#x27;s name is Begum Akram, and he has three siblings: two elder brothers Naeem Akram and Nadeem Akram and a younger sister, Sofia Akram.

=== Education ===
He completed his early education in Lahore from Government Islamia College, Civil Lines, Lahore.

=== Health ===
At the age of 30, Akram was diagnosed with diabetes. &quot;I remember what a shock it was because I was a healthy sportsman with no history of diabetes in my family, so I didn&#x27;t expect it at all. It seemed strange that it happened to me when I was 30, but it was a very stressful time and doctors said that can trigger it.&quot; Since then he has sought to be involved in various awareness campaigns for diabetes.

=== Relationships ===
Akram married Huma Mufti in 1995. They had two sons from their marriage of 14 years: Tahmoor and Akbar. Huma died of multiple organ failure at Apollo Hospital in Chennai, India, on 25 October 2009.

For some years he was linked by the Indian media to former Miss Universe turned actress Sushmita Sen.

On 7 July 2013, it was reported that Akram had become engaged to an Australian woman, Shaniera Thompson, whom he had met while on a visit to Melbourne in 2011. Akram married Shaniera on 12 August 2013, saying he has started a new life on a happy note. He was quoted as saying, &quot;I married Shaniera in Lahore in a simple ceremony, and this is the start of a new life for me, my wife, and for my kids.&quot;

He moved from Lahore to Karachi with his wife and children. On 3 September 2014, the couple tweeted that they were expecting their first baby—the third child of Akram. On 27 December 2014, Shaniera gave birth to a baby girl, Aiyla Sabeen Rose Akram, in Melbourne.

== Domestic career ==
Akram started his career as a tape ball cricketer. He later joined Ludhiana Gymkhana with the help of his friend, Khalid Mahmood. His first class cricket debut was for BCCP Patron&#x27;s Eleven against New Zealand cricket team.

In 1988, Akram signed for Lancashire County Cricket Club in England. From 1988 to 1998, he opened their bowling attack in their NatWest Trophy, Benson and Hedges Cup, and Sunday League tournaments. He was a favourite of the local British fans, who used to sing a song called &quot;Wasim for England&quot; at Lancashire&#x27;s matches. In 1998, with Akram as captain, Lancashire won the NatWest Trophy and Sunday League and finished second in the County Championship, having lost only five matches in all competitions during the season.

== International career ==
=== Test cricket ===
Akram made his Test cricket debut for Pakistan against New Zealand in 1985, and in his second Test match, he claimed 10 wickets. A few weeks prior to his selection in the Pakistan team, he was an unknown club cricketer who had failed to make it even to his college team. He came to the trials at Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore in Pakistan, but for the first two days he did not get a chance to bowl. On the third day, he got a chance; his performance convincing Javed Miandad to insist upon his inclusion in the national team. Akram was hence given an opportunity to play for Pakistan, without any significant domestic experience.

Akram&#x27;s rise in international cricket was rapid during the late 1980s. He was a part of the Pakistan team that toured the West Indies in 1988. However, a groin injury impeded his career in the late 1980s. Following two surgeries, he re-emerged in the 1990s as a fast bowler who focused more on swing and accurate bowling.

Wasim Akram is currently the highest wicket taker for Pakistan in test cricket with 414 wickets.

=== One Day International ===
Akram started his ODI career against New Zealand in Pakistan in 1984 under the captaincy of Zaheer Abbas. He rose to prominence by taking five wickets in his 3rd ODI against Australia in the 1985 Benson &amp; Hedges World Championship. His wickets included those of Kepler Wessels, Dean Jones, and captain Allan Border. Wasim Akram is currently the highest wicket taker for Pakistan in One Day International cricket

=== Early days ===
In the 1984–85 Rothmans Four-Nations Cup and the 1985–86 Rothmans Sharjah Cup, Akram took five wickets with a run rate of less than 3.50. The 1985–1986 Austral-Asia Cup involved Australia, India, New Zealand, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, and was played in Sharjah, UAE. Akram, with the help of Abdul Qadir, bowled out New Zealand&#x27;s batting line-up for 64 in the second semi-final of the cup. Pakistan won that game with more than 27 overs to spare, obtaining one of the biggest wins in Pakistani history. In the final against India, he and Imran Khan shared five wickets. Akram&#x27;s wickets included Dilip Vengsarkar and Ravi Shastri.

In the 1987 Cricket World Cup held for the 1st time in South Asia, Akram struggled on Pakistani pitches; he managed only 7 wickets throughout, with an average of over 40 runs per wicket across all 7 matches. Akram played West Indies, Sri Lanka and England twice. All group matches were played in Pakistan.

In the 1988–89 Benson and Hedges World Series, Akram managed figures of 4 for 25 against Australia.

=== Emergence ===
Akram took his hundredth wicket at Sharjah during the 1989–1990 Champions Trophy, the 2nd Match against West Indies. His 100th wicket was that of Curtly Ambrose. In that match, he took a five-wicket haul for the second time in his career. In the same match, Akram took his first hat-trick against West Indies. All three batsman were bowled out. On 4 May 1990 in Sharjah, Akram took his second ODI hat-trick against Australia. All three batsmen were bowled this time as well.

His best years in the late 1980s were from 1986 to 1989, during which time he took 100 wickets at 22.71 runs per wicket, and his economy rate was less than 3.9 runs per over, with a total of four 4-wicket hauls. His first two hauls against Sri Lanka and Bangladesh came in Sri Lanka in 1986.

Up until December 1991, Akram took 143 wickets in 107 matches, with an average of almost 24 and an economy rate of 3.84.

=== World&#x27;s best ===
Akram was a significant figure in the 1992 Cricket World Cup held in Australia and New Zealand when Pakistan won the tournament. In the final, against England, his innings of 33 runs off 19 balls pushed Pakistan to a score of 249 runs for 6 wickets. Akram then took the wicket of Ian Botham early on during the English batting innings; and, when brought back into the bowling attack later on, with the ball reverse swinging, he produced a spell of bowling which led to Allan Lamb and Chris Lewis being bowled in successive deliveries in one over. His performances earned him the Man of the Match award for the final. In 1993, Akram took two consecutive 4-wicket hauls against Sri Lanka in Sharjah, in which 7 out of 8 wickets were either LBW or bowled.

In the 1992–1993 Total International Series in South Africa (involving Pakistan, West Indies and South Africa), he took 5 wickets against South Africa and got his 200th wicket in his 143rd match. Akram took 46 wickets in calendar year 1993, his best year ever in ODIs. His average was less than 19, with an economy rate of less than 3.8 runs per over. He took six 4-wicket hauls in 1993, the most by him in any year. In the 1996 Cricket World Cup, Akram missed the quarterfinal match against India which Pakistan lost and went out of the World Cup. Wasim&#x27;s great career was often tainted by controversy, not least in the Caribbean in April 1993, his maiden tour as Pakistan&#x27;s captain. During the team&#x27;s stop-over in Grenada, he was arrested along with three teammates—Waqar Younis, Aaqib Javed and Mushtaq Ahmed—and two female British tourists; he was charged with possession of marijuana. Between 1994 and 1996, he took 84 wickets in 39 matches.

From January 1992 to December 1997, Akram played 131 matches and took 198 wickets at an average of 21.86, with 14 4-wicket hauls in ODIs. In September 1998, he first announced his retirement from international cricket and hired a retired judge to help him fight match-fixing allegations levelled against him. Akram called the allegations &quot;a conspiracy, especially within the board&quot;. He added, &quot;Unfortunately I have to leave cricket. When allegations arise you need to fight it out. You can&#x27;t just sit back... I would love to carry on but I simply can&#x27;t. But I&#x27;m happy because I know that I have done nothing wrong.&quot; However, he reconsidered his decision on the insistence of chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), Khalid Mahmood.

=== Late career ===
In 1999, he led Pakistan to the finals of the World Cup where they capitulated and were defeated by Australia in the final by eight wickets with almost 30 overs to spare. This was the start of the match-fixing controversies, as critics believed Akram had set up the match for Australia. However, none of the allegations could be proven.

He was Pakistan&#x27;s best bowler in the 2003 Cricket World Cup, taking 12 wickets in 6 matches. However, Pakistan failed to reach the super six of the tournament, and Akram was one of the eight players to be sacked by the PCB as a result.

== Records ==
Akram won 17 Man-of-the-Match awards in 104 Tests. He took four hat-tricks in international cricket—two in ODIs and two in Tests. As a result, he shares the record for most international hat-tricks with Lasith Malinga. He finished with 22 Man-of-the-Match awards in ODIs. In 199 ODI match wins, he took 326 wickets at under 19 apiece with a run rate of 3.70 and took 18 four-wicket hauls. His 257 not-out against Zimbabwe in 1996 is the highest innings by a number-8 batsman in Tests. He hit 12 sixes in that game, and it stands to this day as the record for the most sixes by any player in a single Test innings.

Prior to his retirement, he was one of eight senior players dropped for the 2003 Sharjah Cup, and was then omitted from the Pakistan squad for the subsequent Bank Alfalah Cup triangular series. Due to his omission from the team, he did not participate in a farewell match. Akram fulfilled his contract play for Hampshire until the end of the English season.

== Post-retirement ==

=== Media career ===
Since retiring from cricket, Akram has worked and taken up commentary for television networks and can currently be seen as a sports commentator for ESPN Star Sports and ARY Digital among others. He did commentary on a variety of sporting tournaments including the 2009 Women&#x27;s Cricket World Cup in Australia, the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 in England, the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy in South Africa, and the 2011 ICC World Cup in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.

=== Coaching career ===
In 2010, Akram was appointed the bowling coach consultant of Kolkata Knight Riders, the Indian Premier League team for Kolkata. Sourav Ganguly was always keen to have Akram as the bowling coach for India, during the former&#x27;s stint as Indian captain. Although this never happened, his dreams were realised to some extent, when Akram was appointed as the bowling coach cum mentor for the franchise.
Akram has thus been playing a vital role in the grooming of Indian pacers like Mohammed Shami and Umesh Yadav, who owe their success in international cricket a lot to the bowling legend.
While working for the Kolkata Knight Riders, he was also responsible for the signing of Pakistani domestic left-arm fast-bowler Mohammad Irfan.
Akram has also been coaching in Pakistan fast bowling camps, his most notable discovery being the teenage Pakistani bowlers Mohammad Amir and Junaid Khan.
Akram has also worked as director and bowling coach of PSL franchise Islamabad United during 2016 and 2017 season. He has also worked with Multan Sultans as director and bowling coach. He is currently chairman and bowling coach of Karachi Kings. He is also currently the Vice President of Kashmir Premier League.

== Playing style and legacy ==

During his professional career he bowled with genuine speed and hostility. Akram was a man possessed of accurate control of line and length, accompanied by seam and swing bowling skills, extended to both inswingers and outswingers. With a very quick bowling action, he could bowl equally well from both sides of the wicket. His mastery of reverse swing with the cricket ball meant he was at his most dangerous towards the end of a bowling innings, and earned him the nickname of one of the &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot;, the other one being Waqar Younis.

As well as often being able to find the edge of the bat, Akram would also focus his bowling attack on the stumps and had a particularly lethal inswinging yorker. Of his 414 Test wickets, 193 were taken caught, 119 were taken leg before wicket and 102 were bowled. In partnership with Waqar Younis, he intimidated international batsmen in the 1990s. Together Wasim and Waqar, known as &quot;the two Ws&quot; of the Pakistani team, were one of the most successful bowling partnerships in cricket.

With the bat he was especially effective against spin bowlers. However, he liked to slog and was criticised for his lack of high scores and giving away his wicket too cheaply. In October 1996 he scored 257 runs not out, of the team&#x27;s total of 553 against lowly Zimbabwe on a typical flat South Asian pitch at Sheikhupura. He also achieved good scores for the Pakistan team such as his scores of 123 and 45* against Australia to take Pakistan to victory in a low scoring match. His batting was also valuable sometimes to the Pakistan ODI side, such as in the Nehru Cup in 1989, when needing six runs in two balls to win the match, he hit the first delivery he faced, from part-time off-spinner and batting legend, Viv Richards, for a six and secured the cup.

West Indian batting great Viv Richards rates Akram as best fast bowler he ever faced after Dennis Lillee.

In December 2012 after Ricky Ponting announced his retirement, he said that Wasim Akram and Curtly Ambrose were the toughest bowlers he had faced &quot;Akram for the exact opposite, you could get a few runs off him, but you just knew there was an unplayable ball around the corner, be it with an old ball or with a new ball,&quot; – Ricky Ponting.

To mark 150 years of the Cricketers&#x27; Almanack, Wisden named him in an all-time Test World XI.

* In One Day Internationals, Akram took 502 wickets in 356 appearances, at an average of 23.52 and scored 3,717 runs, at an average of 16.52.
* Akram was the first bowler in international cricket to take more than 400 wickets in both forms of the game and only Muttiah Muralitharan has since achieved this.
* Akram also held the record for the most wickets in Cricket World Cups, a total of 55 in 38 matches. Australia&#x27;s Glenn McGrath broke the record during the 2007 Cricket World Cup, ending with a final tally of 71 from 39 matches. On passing Wasim&#x27;s record, McGrath said, &quot;Wasim Akram, to me, is one of the greatest bowlers of all time. Left-armer, swung it both ways with the new ball and he was so dangerous with the old ball. To go past him is something I will always remember. Probably the other side of the coin is that if you play long enough, you&#x27;re going to break records here and there.&quot; He is currently the fourth highest wicket taker in world cups.
* Akram is one of the only two bowlers, along with Lasith Malinga, that achieved four or more hat-tricks in international cricket, with two each in Tests and One Day Internationals. He was the third of only four bowlers to have taken two Test cricket hat-tricks, the others being Hugh Trumble, Jimmy Matthews and Stuart Broad. Akram was also the first of only five bowlers to have taken two One Day International cricket hat-tricks. Akram&#x27;s Test hat-tricks are significant, since they were taken in consecutive Test matches in the same series, a game played against Sri Lanka in the 1998-99 Asian Test Championship. Akram is also one of only two bowlers to have taken both a Test match and One Day International hat-trick, the other being Pakistan fast bowler, Mohammad Sami.
* Playing in a Test series against the West Indies at Lahore in 1990–1991, he became one of only six players to have taken four wickets in an over during a Test match. In Akram&#x27;s case, these achievement was not part of a hat-trick, the third ball he delivered to the batting opposition was a dropped catch, which allowed a single run.
* Akram has also achieved the highest score by a number eight batsman in Test cricket when he scored 257 runs not out from 363 balls against Zimbabwe at Sheikhupura. The innings contained 12 sixes which is also a world record for highest number of sixes in any Test innings.
* He also has the joint-third highest number of Man of the Match awards in Test cricket, with seventeen.
* He has scored the second-highest number of runs in One Day International matches by a player who has never scored a One Day International hundred, after Misbah-ul-Haq. His highest score was 86 runs.
* He is the only Test cricketer in the world (as of Feb 2013) to take ten or more wickets three times in a test match and still end up on the losing side.
* He holds the record for facing the most balls in a test match as well as in an innings as number 8 batsman (363 balls)
* First bowler to take 500 ODI wickets and still holds the record for taking the most ODI wickets as seamer (502)
* Wasim Akram is the person to grab 100+ ODI wickets at the same ground. He jointly holds the record for taking the most wickets in ODI history at a single ground (122 at Sharjah Cricket Stadium), tied with Shakib Al Hasan. Waqar Younis, the second person to grab 100+ ODI wickets at a single ground, also did in Sharjah. He ranks second overall with 114 wickets.
* Holds the record for taking the most ODI wickets as captain (158)

== Controversies ==

=== Ball tampering ===
In 1992, after he had been successful against the English batsmen, accusations of ball tampering began to appear in the English media, though no video evidence of foul play was ever found. Akram and Younis had been able to obtain prodigious amounts of movement from both new and old cricket balls. The skill of the reverse swing delivery was relatively unknown in England and around the cricketing world during that period.

=== Match fixing ===
A far larger controversy was created when critics alleged that he was involved in match fixing. An inquiry commission was set up by the Pakistan Cricket Board headed by a Pakistan high court judge, Malik Mohammad Qayyum. The judge wrote in his report that:

<text>Steel Beasts is the name for a family of tank simulators created by eSim Games for Microsoft Windows.

Its subject is contemporary combined arms tactics (with emphasis on modern armoured fighting vehicles) at a company scale. As a consumer game, it is a genre mix of strategy game, action game, simulation game, and wargame of fairly complex gameplay.

&quot;Steel Beasts&quot; (more colloquially known as &quot;SB&quot; to its fans) is distinguished from other simulators by a faithful reproduction of tactical maneuvers and Fire Control Systems as well as various other military facets than when compared to other simulators. The sound samples are mostly authentic, having been recorded from some of the actual armored fighting vehicles depicted in the sim.

Customized versions of &quot;Steel Beasts&quot; have been adopted by the armies of Australia, Austria, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Greece, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and USA for training purposes.

== Steel Beasts ==

Steel Beasts is a modern tank simulator that focuses on the US M1A1 Abrams and German Leopard 2A4 main battle tanks. Both machines are fully drivable and are reproduced in painstaking detail in the game. In addition to these tanks, Steel Beasts models a number of modern armored vehicles such as the Russian T-80, the German Marder, and a variety of armored personnel carriers. Steel Beasts allows the player assume the tank commander&#x27;s or gunner&#x27;s seat in the Abrams and Leopard 2, as well as move to an external camera view in each vehicle. The variety of units in the game (including infantry) allows for a wide range of different scenarios.

The game was announced in March 2000, and was published exclusively through Shrapnel&#x27;s website.

=== Critical reception ===

On the review aggregator GameRankings, the game had an average score of 87% based on 21 reviews. On Metacritic, the game had an average score of 86 out of 100, based on 13 reviews.

Critical response to the original &quot;Steel Beasts&quot; was quite consistent. Reviewers were initially put off by the substandard 640×480 graphics, then highly impressed by the gameplay, immersion and the intelligent-seeming behaviors exhibited by the computerized units.

Bruce Geryk of GameSpot gave the game a rating of 8.8 out 10.

&quot;PC Gamer US&quot; named &quot;Steel Beasts&quot; the best simulation game of 2000. The editors of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; nominated &quot;Steel Beasts&quot; as the best simulation game of 2000, although it lost to &quot;Comanche vs. Hokum&quot;. The editors of &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; also nominated &quot;Steel Beasts&quot; for their 2000 &quot;Simulation of the Year&quot; award.

== Steel Beasts Pro PE ==

Steel Beasts Pro Personal Edition, abbreviated SB Pro PE, is the commercial version of the tank simulator Steel Beasts Pro made by eSim Games for Microsoft Windows. It is an armored fighting vehicle-focused game of combined arms combat tactics at the battalion level and below. Players can directly control a vehicle, and also control multiple vehicles through a map view. Many vehicles, such as the classic M1A1 Abrams and Leopard 2A4, are fully crew-able, have realistic representations of their actual fire control systems and allow players to aim and fire their weapons. More recently, vehicles such as the Leopard 2A6 and M1A2 SEP have been added and are fully crew-able. Other armored fighting vehicles, such as the M2/M3 Bradley, CV90 and Marder are also fully crewable. Crewable vehicles are usually added as a result of military contracts.

As a tactical simulation, artillery is modelled in the sim and the player can call in various types of artillery, from conventional smoke and high-explosive rounds, to DPICM and the FASCAM minefield system.

&quot;SB&quot; also includes a scenario editor, which allows for programming of random or condition-based behavior in the computer-controlled units. Well-designed SB scenarios therefore have a high degree of replayability. In addition to the scenario editor, SB also contains a map editor for creating custom maps depicting different terrain types. In the Fall of 2011, eSim Games announced that they were using Xaitment&#x27;s AI software for pathfinding, movement and behavior modeling.

===Reception===
&quot;Pelit&quot; magazine rated the game 85/100.

<text>The Pomona Valley is located in the Greater Los Angeles Area between the San Gabriel Valley and San Bernardino Valley in Southern California. The valley is approximately east of downtown Los Angeles. 

== History ==
The earliest inhabitants of Pomona Valley were the Gabrielino (Tongva) and Serrano Indians.

On March 1, 1893 the California Assembly voted 54–14 for a new county to form in the region, to be named San Antonio County, with Pomona as its seat. Los Angeles interests in the Senate rejected the concept, however, and today the eastern and western portions of the valley remain divided between San Bernardino and Los Angeles counties (San Antonio Creek).

== Geography ==
The alluvial valley is formed by the Santa Ana River and its tributaries. The Pomona Valley is separated from San Gabriel Valley to the west by the northeastern end of the San Jose Hills, running approximately along State Route 57. The eastern boundaries are the Jurupa Hills and the Cajon Pass, (the eastern end of the San Gabriel Mountains) running near Interstate 15, which separates the Pomona Valley from the San Bernardino Valley. The northern boundary is the San Gabriel Mountains. The Chino Hills are the southern boundary that separates the Pomona Valley from northern Orange County. Historic U.S. Route 66 runs east-west across the north side of Pomona Valley. San Antonio Creek runs right through the center of the valley dividing the valley into west and east, and also acts as a section of the border between Los Angeles County and San Bernardino County. It originates from the San Gabriel Mountains watershed around Mount San Antonio (known locally as Mt. Baldy) and joins the Santa Ana River south of Chino. The Pomona Valley ranges from the city of San Dimas from the far west to Rancho Cucamonga to the far east portion of the valley.

===Climate===
The Pomona Valley experiences a Mediterranean Climate. In contrast to much of the Greater Los Angeles Area, The Pomona Valley can get much hotter summers with high temperatures ranging from the triple digits. Due to its elevation ranging from 800 to 2200 feet, winters in the Pomona Valley can also get cold. Trace amounts of snowfall can occur anywhere above 1500 feet. On the valley floor, average rainfall amounts range anywhere from 12 to 16 inches. Foothill communities can get anywhere from 14 to 18 inches of rain a year. In the fall (fire season), Santa Ana Winds can occur giving strong offshore winds from the Cajon Pass.

==Demographics==
The residents of the Pomona Valley are predominantly Latino and White. In contrast to the San Gabriel Valley, the population of Asian Americans is much smaller. Northern areas of the valley that contain the cities of Claremont, La Verne, and Upland have large Caucasian populations. Central portions of the valley that contain the cities of Pomona, Montclair, Chino, and Ontario have large Hispanic populations. Southern portions of the Pomona Valley such as Chino Hills, and Ontario Ranch contain rather large Asian populations. Rancho Cucamonga, a city in the north west of the valley is very diverse, with large groups of Hispanics, Whites, Asians, and Blacks.

<text>Protein disulfide isomerase (), or PDI, is an enzyme in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in eukaryotes and the periplasm of bacteria that catalyzes the formation and breakage of disulfide bonds between cysteine residues within proteins as they fold. This allows proteins to quickly find the correct arrangement of disulfide bonds in their fully folded state, and therefore the enzyme acts to catalyze protein folding.

== Structure ==
Protein disulfide-isomerase has two catalytic thioredoxin-like domains (active sites), each containing the canonical CGHC motif, and two non catalytic domains. This structure is similar to the structure of enzymes responsible for oxidative folding in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria; an example of this is mitochondrial IMS import and assembly (Mia40), which has 2 catalytic domains that contain a CX9C, which is similar to the CGHC domain of PDI. Bacterial DsbA, responsible for oxidative folding, also has a thioredoxin CXXC domain.
== Function ==

===Protein folding===

PDI displays oxidoreductase and isomerase properties, both of which depend on the type of substrate that binds to protein disulfide-isomerase and changes in protein disulfide-isomerase&#x27;s redox state. These types of activities allow for oxidative folding of proteins. Oxidative folding involves the oxidation of reduced cysteine residues of nascent proteins; upon oxidation of these cysteine residues, disulfide bridges are formed, which stabilizes proteins and allows for native structures (namely tertiary and quaternary structures).

====Regular oxidative folding mechanism and pathway====

PDI is specifically responsible for folding proteins in the ER. In an unfolded protein, a cysteine residue forms a mixed disulfide with a cysteine residue in an active site (CGHC motif) of protein disulfide-isomerase. A second cysteine residue then forms a stable disulfide bridge within the substrate, leaving protein disulfide-isomerase&#x27;s two active-site cysteine residues in a reduced state.

Afterwards, PDI can be regenerated to its oxidized form in the endoplasmic reticulum by transferring electrons to reoxidizing proteins such ER oxidoreductin 1 (Ero 1), VKOR (vitamin K epoxide reductase), glutathione peroxidase (Gpx7/8), and PrxIV (peroxiredoxin IV). Ero1 is thought to be the main reoxidizing protein of PDI, and the pathway of reoxidation of PDI for Ero1 is more understood than that of other proteins. Ero1 accepts electrons from PDI and donates these electrons to oxygen molecules in the ER, which leads to the formation of hydrogen peroxide.

==== Misfolded protein mechanism ====
The reduced (dithiol) form of protein disulfide-isomerase is able to catalyze a reduction of a misformed disulfide bridge of a substrate through either reductase activity or isomerase activity. For the reductase method, a misfolded substrate disulfide bond is converted to a pair of reduced cysteine residues by the transfer of electrons from glutathione and NADPH. Afterwards, normal folding occurs with oxidative disulfide bond formation between the correct pairs of substrate cysteine residues, leading to a properly folded protein. For the isomerase method, intramolecular rearrangement of substrate functional groups is catalyzed near the N terminus of each active site. Therefore, protein disulfide-isomerase is capable of catalyzing the post-translational modification disulfide exchange.

=== Redox signaling ===

In the chloroplasts of the unicellular algae &quot;Chlamydomonas reinhardtii&quot; the protein disulfide-isomerase RB60 serves as a redox sensor component of an mRNA-binding protein complex implicated in the photoregulation of the translation of psbA, the RNA encoding for the photosystem II core protein D1. Protein disulfide-isomerase has also been suggested to play a role in the formation of regulatory disulfide bonds in chloroplasts.

=== Other functions ===

==== Immune system ====
Protein disulfide-isomerase helps load antigenic peptides into MHC class I molecules. These molecules (MHC I) are related to the peptide presentation by antigen-presenting cells in the immune response.

Protein disulfide-isomerase has been found to be involved in the breaking of bonds on the HIV gp120 protein during HIV infection of CD4 positive cells, and is required for HIV infection of lymphocytes and monocytes. Some studies have shown it to be available for HIV infection on the surface of the cell clustered around the CD4 protein. Yet conflicting studies have shown that it is not available on the cell surface, but instead is found in significant amounts in the blood plasma.

==== Chaperone activity ====
Another major function of protein disulfide-isomerase relates to its activity as a chaperone; its b&#x27; domain aids in the binding of misfolded protein for subsequent degradation. This is regulated by three ER membrane proteins, Protein Kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring kinase 1 (IRE1), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). They respond to high levels of misfolded proteins in the ER through intracellular signaling cascades that can activate PDI&#x27;s chaperone activity. These signals can also inactivate translation of these misfolded proteins, because the cascade travels from the ER to the nucleus.

== Activity assays ==

&quot;Insulin turbidity assay&quot;: protein disulfide-isomerase breaks the two disulfide bonds between two insulin (a and b) chains that results in precipitation of b chain. This precipitation can be monitored at 650 nm, which is indirectly used to monitor protein disulfide-isomerase activity. Sensitivity of this assay is in micromolar range.

&quot;ScRNase assay&quot;: protein disulfide-isomerase converts scrambled (inactive) RNase into native (active) RNase that further acts on its substrate. The sensitivity is in micromolar range.

&quot;Di-E-GSSG assay&quot;: This is the fluorometric assay that can detect picomolar quantities of protein disulfide-isomerase and therefore is the most sensitive assay to date for detecting protein disulfide-isomerase activity. Di-E-GSSG has two eosin molecules attached to oxidized glutathione (GSSG). The proximity of eosin molecules leads to the quenching of its fluorescence. However, upon breakage of disulfide bond by protein disulfide-isomerase, fluorescence increases 70-fold.

==Stress and inhibition==

=== Effects of nitrosative stress ===
Redox dysregulation leads to increases in nitrosative stress in the endoplasmic reticulum. Such adverse changes in the normal cellular environment of susceptible cells, such as neurons, leads to nonfunctioning thiol-containing enzymes. More specifically, protein disulfide-isomerase can no longer fix misfolded proteins once its thiol group in its active site has a nitric monoxide group attached to it; as a result, accumulation of misfolded proteins occurs in neurons, which has been associated with the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

=== Inhibition ===
Due to the role of protein disulfide-isomerase in a number of disease states, small molecule inhibitors of protein disulfide-isomerase have been developed. These molecules can either target the active site of protein disulfide-isomerase irreversibly or reversibly.

It has been shown that protein disulfide-isomerase activity is inhibited by red wine and grape juice, which could be the explanation for the French paradox.

<doc id="501400" wikidata="Q2478838" url="?curid=501400" title="Patani (historical region)">
<text>Patani Darussalam (Malay: &quot;Kesultanan Patani Darussalam&quot;, Jawi: كسلطانن ڤطاني دارالسلام, also sometimes Patani Raya or Patani Besar, &quot;Greater Patani&quot;; ) is a historical region and sultanate in the Malay Peninsula. It includes the southern Thai provinces of Pattani, Yala (Jala), Narathiwat (Menara), parts of Songkhla (Singgora) and also parts of Malaysia modern state Kelantan and Besut district in state of Terengganu . Its capital was the town of Patani.

The Patani region has historical affinities with the Singgora (Songkhla), Ligor (Nakhon Si Thammarat), Lingga (near Surat Thani) and Kelantan sultanates dating back to the time when the Patani Kingdom was a semi-independent Malay sultanate paying tribute to the Siamese kingdoms of Sukhothai and Ayutthaya. After Ayutthaya fell to the Burmese in 1767, the Sultanate of Patani gained full independence, but under King Rama I, it again came under Siam&#x27;s control.

In recent years, a secessionist movement has sought the establishment of a Malay Islamic state, Patani Darussalam, encompassing the three southern Thai provinces. This campaign has taken a particularly violent turn after 2001, resulting in an intractable insurgency across southern Thailand and the imposition of martial law.

==Name==

===Founding legend===
According to legend, the founder of Patani was a raja from Kota Malikha named Phaya Tunakpa. Phaya Tunakpa went hunting one day and saw a beautiful albino mouse-deer the size of a goat, which then disappeared. He asked his men where the animal had gone, and they replied: &quot;Pata ni lah!&quot; (&quot;This beach!&quot; in the Patani Malay language). They searched for the mouse-deer but found instead an old man fishing, who identified himself as Che&#x27; Tani. The old man said that he was sent by the raja&#x27;s grandfather to build a new town further beyond but had fallen ill on the journey; as he could not go any further, he stayed at that place. The raja later ordered a town be built at the site where the mouse-deer had disappeared. The town became Patani, which is believed to be named either after &quot;this beach&quot; where the mouse-deer had disappeared, or the old man as Pak Tani meaning &quot;Father Tani&quot;.

===Patani, Pattani===
In Thailand&#x27;s southernmost provinces, &quot;Patani&quot; has become a controversial term used to refer to the area encompassing the provinces of Pattani (with two t&#x27;s), Yala, Narathiwat, and parts of Songkhla, mostly inhabited by Malay Muslims. Patani in Malay is written with one &quot;t&quot;, but in Thai sources with two &quot;t&quot;s. When written in Thai, &quot;Patani&quot; (ปตานี) &quot;pa-ta-ni&quot; sounds markedly different from &quot;Pattani&quot; (ปัตตานี) &quot;pat-ta-ni&quot;. Malays say P’tani (ปตานี), pronounced as &quot;pa-ta-ni&quot; with a very brief first syllable and stress on the second syllable. &quot;P&#x27;tani&quot;, the original Malay word for the region, has been used for a long time and is usually never written in Thai. So while technically being the same word as &quot;P&#x27;tani&quot;, &quot;Patani&quot; with one &quot;t&quot; has a certain separatist political connotation.

==Culture==
From the cultural point of view the term &quot;Patani&quot; may refer to the territories of the historical Sultanate of Patani, as well as to the wider areas that were once under its rule.

===Cultural background: Patani traditions===
The inhabitants of the Patani region have been traditionally part of the Malay culture, having a historical background in which Islam has constituted a major influence.

The Patani people speak a form of the Malay language locally known as Jawi. Patani had a complex and distinct culture that included a rich oral literature, rice harvest ceremonies, colourful paintings on the hulls of &quot;Korlae&quot; boats, and the performances of a kind of &quot;Wayang&quot; theatre. Living in a borderland at the northern end of the Malay Peninsula, over the centuries the Patani people adapted themselves to a life of harmony with the local Chinese, Buddhist, Indian, Arab and Orang Asli communities.

Despite the ethnic affinity of the Patani with their Malay neighbours to the south, The Patani Kingdom was led by sultans who historically preferred to pay tribute to the distant Siamese kings in Bangkok. For many centuries the King of Siam restricted himself to exacting a periodic tribute in the form of Bunga mas, ritual trees with gold leaves and flowers that were a symbolic acknowledgment of Siamese suzerainty, leaving the Patani rulers largely alone.

===The 20th century: forced assimilation===
Until well into the 20th century, the government in Bangkok had relied on local officials in the implementation of policies within the Patani region, including the exemption in implementing Thai Civil Law, which had allowed Muslims to continue their observance of local laws based on Islam regarding issues on inheritance and family. However, by 1934 Marshall Plaek Phibunsongkhram set in motion of a process of Thaification which had as its objective the cultural assimilation of the Patani people, among other ethnic groups in Thailand.

The National Culture Act was enforced as a result of the Thaification process, promoting the concept of &#x27;Thai-ness&#x27; and its centralist aims. Its &quot;Mandate 3&quot; was directly aimed at the Patani people. By 1944, Thai civil law was enforced throughout the land including the Patani region over-riding the earlier concessions to local Islamic administrative practices. The school curriculum was revised to that of a Thai-centric one with all lessons in the Thai language. Traditional Muslim courts that were used to handle civil cases were removed and replaced with civil courts run and approved by the central government in Bangkok. This forced assimilation process and the perceived imposition of Thai-Buddhist cultural practices upon their society became an irritant for the harmonious relationship of the ethnic Malay Patani people and the Thai state.

Denied recognition as a culturally separate ethnic minority, Patani leaders reacted against the Thai government policy towards them and a nationalist movement began to grow, leading to the South Thailand insurgency. Initially the goal of the nationalist movement such as the Patani United Liberation Organisation (PULO) was secession, pursuing an armed struggle towards an independent state where Patani people could live with dignity without having alien cultural values imposed on them.

===The 21st century: traditional culture under threat===
After 2001, the Patani insurgency was taken over by groups whose leaders are mainly Salafist religious teachers who have promoted religion, rejecting the nation-building ideology of the early secessionist movements.
Current insurgent groups proclaim militant jihadism and are not separatist any more. They have extreme and transnational religious goals, such as an Islamic Caliphate, to the detriment of a constructive cultural or nationalistic Patani identity. Salafi-based groups are hostile to the heritage and practices of traditional Malay Muslims, accusing them of being un-Islamic. They are not concerned about Patani cultural values, instead their immediate aim is to make the Patani region ungovernable.

So far, and in the present circumstances, to preserve an identity free of the influence of Militant Islam has been next to impossible for the people of the hapless Patani Region. The activity of the present-day insurgents has changed the face of Patani society by the imposition of extreme religious undercurrents and the enforcement of the stern Salafi rules on local people.

==History==

===Early history===

The area was home to the Hindu-Buddhist kingdom of Langkasuka as early as the second century, as accounts from Chinese travellers attest. Langkasuka reached its peak in the sixth and seventh centuries, and then declined as a major trade center. Pattani subsequently became part of the Hindu-Buddhist Empire of Srivijaya, a maritime confederation based in Palembang, which spanned the seventh to the thirteenth centuries. Regional influence during these early centuries also came from the developing Khmer, Siamese and Malay cultures.

The founding of the Islamic kingdom of Patani is thought to have been around the mid-13th century, with folklore suggesting it was named after an exclamation made by Sultan Ismail Shah, &quot;Pantai Ini!&quot; (&quot;This beach&quot; in the local Malay language). However, some think it was the same country known to the Chinese as Pan Pan.

===Siamese rule===

Patani came under Thai rule briefly during the Sukhothai period, and more extensively during the later Ayuthaya period.

In 1791 and 1808, there were rebellions within Pattani against Thai rule, following which Pattani was divided into 7 largely autonomous states (&quot;Mueang&quot;): Pattani, Nongchik, Saiburi (Teluban), Yala (Jala), Yaring (Jambu), Ra-ngae (Legeh) and Raman. All were ruled by the King of Ligor.

In 1909 Great Britain and Thailand signed the Bangkok Treaty of 1909. The British recognised Thailand&#x27;s sovereignty over Pattani, and, in return, Thailand gave up the kingdoms of Kedah, Kelantan, Perlis and Terengganu to the British. All seven mueang were reunited into a monthon and incorporated into the kingdom. Later, the central government in Bangkok renamed certain localities with Thai versions of their names and merged some of the mueang.

When the monthon system was dissolved in 1933, three provinces remained: Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat.

===Greater Malay Patani state===
On 8 December 1941, during the Second World War, the Japanese invaded Thailand, and crossed Pattani to invade British Malaya. The Thai government, led by Marshall Plaek Phibunsongkhram became an active ally of Japan by promising to help Thailand retake some territorial claims back from the British and the French. This included Sirat Malai, the former Malay dependencies of Kelantan, Trengganu, Kedah, and Perlis. It is arguable that this move not only gave more territory to the Thai state but on the contrary, it strengthened the old Malay ties between the Pattani region and the northern Malayan peninsula states.

Tengku Mahmud Mahyuddin, a prominent Pattani leader and the son of the last Raja of Pattani, allied himself with the British in the hopes that Pattani would be granted independence after an Allied victory. His main support came from ethnic Malays displeased by the nationalistic policies of the Phibun regime, which were seen by the southern Malays as forcing them to give up their own language and culture and the economic hardship that ensued as a result of alleged mismanagement. According to Ockey, even leading Thai politicians such as Pridi Phanomyong and Seni Pramot were among those that &quot;overtly or covertly&quot; supported this resistance against the Japanese. During this time the electoral seats for in this region were mainly held by non-Muslim representatives except Satun. Mahyuddin assisted the British by launching guerrilla attacks against the Japanese. In 1945, a petition by Malay leaders led by Tengku Abdul Jalal demanded that Britain guarantee independence for the southernmost provinces of Thailand. At the war&#x27;s end, the Greater Malay Pattani State (Negara Melayu Patani Raya) flag did fly briefly in Pattani. However, since the British had no power over Thailand, the Thai continued to rule over Pattani, while the British kept Thailand stable as a counterweight to the communist insurgency in Malaya. This led to the formation of several insurgent groups seeking the independence of Pattani.

After World War II had ended, the US had wanted to treat Thailand as an ally because of the resistance movement against the Japanese during the war but the British on the other hand had wanted to treat it as a defeated enemy. With this notion in the balance, the newly elected government led by Pridi had to address the issue of the South. With the aid of advisor Chaem Phromyong, a Muslim, the government began policies of accommodation and integration of the South. With the closure of the war, the government also approved the Patronage of Islam Act. This act recognised the work and role of religious figures in the South and gave them authority once more in the affairs of the Muslims in that region. Coincidentally, this act also paved the way for Haji Sulong to become the president of the Pattani Islamic Committee in 1945. It was from this appointment that Sulong began to take an interest in the restoration of the Islamic courts which had earlier been abolished by the Phibun regime. Ockey points out that Sulong was not entirely pleased with the restoration process because the authority in the Islamic courts was still preceded by the presence of a judge from the Ministry of Justice alongside the Muslim judge in cases. However, the negotiations over this supposed unhappiness was in the form of meetings to discuss terms and not open confrontation. These peaceful attempts at resolution would all come to an end in November 1947 when Pridi was forced out of power by opposing army personnel.

===Secessionist movements in Patani===
During World War II, along with the Greater Patani Malay Movement led by Tengku Mahmud Mahyuddin, another resistance force under the leadership of Islamic scholar Haji Sulong Tokmina also fought against the Japanese. Their stated goal was to create an Islamic republic in Patani, which frequently put it at odds with Prince Tengku Mahmud, who wanted to reestablish the Pattanese Sultanate.

Haji Sulong had emerged at a time when the region of Pattani was in need of new political direction. His appearance supposedly gave new light to the nationalistic intents of the Malays in the region based on Islamic principles. Haji Sulong was born in 1895 to a family in Kampong Anak Rhu. He had completed his Islamic studies locally before being sent by his father to further education in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. There in Mecca, he apparently met up with and studied with famous Islamic scholars and teachers. He even opened a school in Mecca and had students from all over the world study under him. Eventually he married and settled in Mecca. During this period, there was a wave of nationalism sweeping the world in the earlier part of the 20th century and Sulong himself was exposed to Arab nationalism. Sulong&#x27;s return to Pattani happened almost by chance due to the death of his first infant son to alleviate the grief of his family.

Upon his return, he had apparently looked upon the plight of the Pattani region being a distant shadow of its former glory as the &#x27;cradle of Islam&#x27; in Southeast Asia. According to Thai historian Thanet, this notion set him into action. From teaching in a khru (small Muslim village school), he eventually opened up a to spread his teachings due to his popularity amongst villagers. Even Pridi Phanomyong visited Haji Sulong at his school and it soon became the most popular Islamic school in Thailand. According to Thanet, the rise of Islamic nationalism in the South is not only attributed to Haji Sulong himself but also the religious students who &#x27;were inclined towards modernism&#x27; from the northern states in Malaya. Haji Sulong was an ulama who openly distrusted the government&#x27;s involvement in the religious affairs of the community. His conviction in the matter stemmed from his ideal that a community cannot be established in the south as long as it is solely under Thai rule.

On 3 April 1947, a commission of inquiry by the Bangkok government was sent to the four Muslim states in the South to check on the apparent plight of the Muslims living there. It was during this time that the Provincial Islamic Council of Pattani drafted out a seven-point demand to the central government in Bangkok which sought for the betterment of Muslims in the region. According to Thanet, the commission of inquiry pointed to Haji Sulong as the leader behind the conceptualisation of this demands. Prime Minister Thamrong brought the seven point demand for consideration with his cabinet and then decided that they could not be met because he felt that the existing structure of the Bangkok government was still (then) adequate to govern the Pattani region. He concluded that an exclusive reorganisation of the governmental structure in the area to suit the people there would then &quot;divide the country&quot;.

By the late part of 1947, Haji Sulong and his supporters realised that their efforts with the government to negotiate better terms for the Muslims in the south was not working. They then decided to adopt a policy of non-co-operation and this included the boycott of the January 1948 elections. Moreover, at this time, the Pridi government had been ousted in a coup by the military which meant a return to the old rigid ways towards the southern states. During this period, Haji Sulong and his associates were arrested and charged for treason. This was a move purported by Phibun even though he was not back yet in power according to Thanet&#x27;s research (Phibun returned to power a few months after in April 1948). This arrests were soon followed by clashes between Muslim villagers and the police/military forces at Duson Nyior. This event was known was the Dusun Nyior Incident which was led by a religious leader by the name of Haji Abdul Rahman. The ensuing violence involved over 1000 men in open battle and led to the deaths of an estimated 400 Malay Muslim peasants and 30 policemen. After the clashes had been settled, there was an exodus of Malays across the border to Malaya. There was even a petition by the Pattani Muslims to the United Nations to step in to broker the separation of the southern states to join the Federation of Malaya.

While on trial, the court provided many descriptions of the alleged activities that Haji Sulong had carried out to incite unrest amongst the people. This include accusations that he held meetings which invoked &quot;arousing rebellious feelings among the people almost to the point of creating unrest in the kingdom&quot;. According to Thanet, the most serious accusation was that he incited the people to seek for self-government with the intention of inviting Tengku Mahmud Mayuddin, who was the son of the last raja of Pattani, to preside as leader over the four southern provinces. On top of this, the prosecution also stated that Haji Sulong had recommended that Islamic law be implemented and if the government did not comply to the said demands, Haji Sulong would then urge the Malay population to make their complaints heard until the government did something about it. Haji Sulong was convicted and spent time in jail until 1952 and after his release, he was ordered by the government to give up his public activities and subject himself to checks by the police on demand. The prosecutor in that trial wanted to press for a heavier sentence, citing evidence that Haji Sulong was planning something bigger to the scale of a rebellion. Originally as a result of the state&#x27;s prosecution citing these evidences, the sentence had been longer but due to the willingness of Haji Sulong to co-operate in the investigations, the court reduced the sentence to four years and eight months. In 1954, Haji Sulong, his eldest son Ahmad and some of his associates were told to report to a police station at Songkhla. Upon leaving to report to the station, they were never seen or heard from again. After his disappearance, his family inquired about his whereabouts but never got any answers. In 1957, his son Ameen Tokmina ran for parliament in the elections in the hope that a position in the government could help him look for more information.

Today, the goals and ideas of Haji Sulong Tokmina are still carried on by minor resistance groups interested in creating an Islamic republic. After the war, though, British and Thai policies essentially removed the possibility of an independent republic in Pattani. The British originally had the intention to deliver on their promise to the anti-Japanese Malay leaders in South Thailand that they would either create an independent territory out of the Malay-based southern Thai states or incorporate them in British Malaya as a punishment of Thailand for aiding the Japanese conquest of Malaya and profiting from it. However, they were dissuaded by the USA who needed Thai rice to feed the war-ravaged region and Thai friendship to face up to the possibility of China&#x27;s fall to the Chinese communist army.

===Current insurgency===

Patani separatist groups, most notably the Barisan Revolusi Nasional-Koordinasi (BRN-C), began to use increasingly violent tactics after 2001. There have been suggestions of links between the BRN-C and foreign Islamist groups, such as Jemaah Islamiyah, however the strength of these relationships remains unknown.

<text>Shannon Matilda Wells Lucid (born January 14, 1943) is an American biochemist and retired NASA astronaut. She has flown in space five times, including a prolonged mission aboard the Russian space station &quot;Mir&quot; in 1996, and is the only American woman to have stayed on &quot;Mir&quot;. From 1996 to 2007, Lucid held the record for the longest duration spent in space by an American and by a woman. She was awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in December 1996, making her the tenth person and the first woman to be accorded the honor.

Lucid is a graduate of the University of Oklahoma, where she earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in chemistry in 1963, a master&#x27;s degree in biochemistry in 1970, and a PhD in biochemistry in 1973. She was a laboratory technician at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation from 1964 to 1966, a research chemist at Kerr-McGee from 1966 to 1968, and a research associate at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation from 1973 to 1978.

In 1978, Lucid was recruited by NASA for astronaut training with NASA Astronaut Group 8, the first class of astronauts to include women. She flew in space five times: on STS-51-G, STS-34, STS-43, STS-58, and her mission to &quot;Mir&quot;, for which Lucid traveled to the space station on with STS-76 and returned six months later with STS-79. She was the NASA Chief Scientist from 2002 to 2003 and a capsule communicator (CAPCOM) at Mission Control for numerous Space Shuttle missions, including STS-135, the final mission of the Space Shuttle program. Lucid announced her retirement from NASA in 2012.

==Early life==
Shannon Wells was born in Shanghai, Republic of China, on January 14, 1943, the daughter of Joseph Oscar Wells, a Baptist missionary, and his wife Myrtle, a missionary nurse. Due to America&#x27;s ongoing war with Japan, when she was six weeks old, the family was detained by the Japanese, who had occupied Shanghai at the time. The three of them were imprisoned in an internment camp but were released during a prisoner exchange later that year. They returned to the United States on the Swedish ocean liner and stayed in the US until the end of the war.

After the war ended, the family returned to China but decided to leave again after the Chinese Communist Revolution in 1949. They moved to Lubbock, Texas, and then settled in Bethany, Oklahoma, the family&#x27;s original hometown, where Wells graduated from Bethany High School in 1960. She was fascinated by stories of the American frontier and wanted to become an explorer. She concluded that she had been born too late for this, but discovered the works of Robert Goddard, the American rocket scientist, and decided that she could become a space explorer. Wells sold her bicycle to buy a telescope so she could look at the stars, and began building her own rockets. Shortly after graduating from high school, Wells earned her private pilot&#x27;s license with instrument and multi-engine ratings and bought a preowned Piper PA-16 Clipper that she used to fly her father to revival meetings. She applied for jobs as a commercial pilot, but was rejected, as women were not yet accepted for training as commercial pilots in the United States.

Wells attended Wheaton College in Illinois, where she majored in chemistry. She then transferred to the University of Oklahoma, where she earned her bachelor&#x27;s degree in chemistry in 1963. She was a teaching assistant in the University of Oklahoma&#x27;s Department of Chemistry from 1963 to 1964 and a senior laboratory technician at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation in Oklahoma City, from 1964 to 1966. She then became a research chemist at Kerr-McGee, an oil company there. At Kerr-McGee she met Michael F. Lucid, a fellow research chemist. They married in 1967, and their first child, Kawai Dawn, was born in 1968.

Afterward, Lucid left Kerr-McGee and returned to the University of Oklahoma as graduate assistant in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, where she pursued a master&#x27;s degree in biochemistry. She sat for her final examinations two days after the birth of her second daughter, Shandara Michelle, in 1970. She went on to earn her PhD in biochemistry in 1973, writing her thesis on the &quot;Effect of Cholera Toxin on Phosphorylation and Kinase Activity of Intestinal Epithelial Cells and Their Brush Borders&quot; under the supervision of A. Chadwick Cox. She then returned to the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation as a research associate. A third child, Michael Kermit, was born in 1975.

==NASA career==
===Selection and training===
On July 8, 1976, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) issued a call for applications for at least 15 pilot candidates and 15 mission specialist candidates. For the first time, new selections would be considered astronaut candidates rather than fully-fledged astronauts until they finished training and evaluation, which was expected to take two years. The enactment of the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 reinforced the promise of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to address the persistent and entrenched employment discrimination against women, African Americans and minority groups in American society. While they had never been explicitly precluded from becoming NASA astronauts, none had ever been selected either. This time, minorities and women were encouraged to apply. Lucid&#x27;s was one of the first of 8,079 applications received.
As one of 208 finalists, Lucid was invited to come to the Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas, for a week of interviews, evaluations and examinations, commencing on August 29, 1977. She was part of the third group of twenty applicants to be interviewed, and the first one that included women. The eight women in the group included Rhea Seddon, Anna Sims, Nitza Cintron and Millie Hughes-Wiley. On January 16, 1978, NASA announced the names of the 35 successful candidates, of whom 20 were mission specialist candidates. Of the six women in this first class with female astronauts, Lucid was the only one who was a mother at the time of being selected. George Abbey, the Director of Flight Crew Operations at JSC and the chairman of the selection panel, later stated that this was not taken into consideration during the selection process.

Group 8&#x27;s name for itself was &quot;TFNG&quot;. The abbreviation was deliberately ambiguous; for public purposes, it stood for &quot;Thirty-Five New Guys&quot;, but within the group itself, it was known to stand for the military phrase, &quot;the fucking new guy&quot;, used to denote newcomers to a military unit. Much of the first eight months of their training was in the classroom. Because there were so many of them, the TFNGs did not fit easily into the existing classrooms, so for classroom instruction they were split into two groups, red and blue, led by Rick Hauck and John Fabian respectively. Classroom training was given on a wide variety of subjects, including an introduction to the Space Shuttle program, space flight engineering, astronomy, orbital mechanics, ascent and entry aerodynamics and space flight physiology. Those accustomed to military and academic environments were surprised that subjects were taught, but not tested. Training in geology, a feature of the training of earlier classes, was continued, but the locations visited changed because the focus was now on observations of the Earth rather than the Moon.

Astronaut candidates had to complete survival training, be able to swim and scuba dive, and master the basics of aviation safety, as well as the specifics of the spacecraft they would have to fly. Water survival training was conducted with the 3613th Combat Crew Training Squadron at Homestead Air Force Base in Florida and parasail training at Vance Air Force Base in Oklahoma. On August 31, 1979, NASA announced that the 35 astronaut candidates had completed their training and evaluation, and were now officially astronauts, qualified for selection on space flight crews. Their training, which had been expected to last eighteen to twenty-four months, had been completed in fourteen. That of subsequent classes was shortened to twelve months.

Each of the new astronauts specialized in certain aspects of the Space Shuttle program, providing astronaut support and input. Lucid was involved with Spacelab 1 crew training, and the development of the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL) at JSC and Rockwell International&#x27;s Flight Systems Laboratory (FSL) in Downey, California. She also worked on the Hubble Space Telescope and rendezvous proximity operations. She was at Edwards Air Force Base as a member of the exchange crew for the landing of the STS-5 mission in November 1982. The exchange crew took over from the flight crew after they had landed, and handled the post-flight activities. She was an astronaut support person (ASP) at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) for the STS-8 mission in August 1983. Also known as a &quot;Cape Crusader&quot;, an ASP was an astronaut who supported vehicle and payload testing at KSC, and strapped the flight crew into their seats before takeoff. For the STS-41-B mission in February 1984 she was the backup ASP and once again a member of the exchange crew.

===STS-51-G===
On November 17, 1983, Lucid was assigned to her first flight, the STS-51-A mission. Tentatively scheduled for October 24, 1984, the mission would be commanded by Daniel Brandenstein, with pilot John O. Creighton and Lucid, Fabian and Steven R. Nagel as mission specialists. She would be the last of the six women in the TFNG group to fly. Due to slippages, the crew was reassigned to the STS-51-D mission in August 1984. This mission had a different payload, and it was scheduled to be launched on March 18, 1985. The mission was scrubbed just three weeks before the launch date. In May 1985 the crew was reassigned to the STS-51-G mission. A French astronaut, Patrick Baudry, and a Saudi Arabian prince, Sultan bin Salman Al Saud were assigned as payload specialists.
STS-51-G lifted off from Launch Complex 39A at KSC in the on June 17, 1985. The seven-day mission was to deploy three communications satellites: Morelos I for Mexico, Arabsat-1B for the Arab League, and Telstar 303 for the United States. The satellites were launched on successive days during the first three days of the mission. Lucid and Fabian operated the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) to deploy the satellites, which were boosted into geostationary transfer orbits by Payload Assist Module (PAM-D) booster stages.

Lucid also used the RMS to deploy the Spartan (Shuttle Pointed Autonomous Research Tool for Astronomy) satellite, which performed 17 hours of X-ray astronomy experiments while separated from the Space Shuttle, while Fabian handled its retrieval 45 hours later. In addition to the satellite deployments, the crew activated the Automated Directional Solidification Furnace (ADSF), six Getaway Specials and participated in biomedical experiments. &quot;Discovery&quot; landed at Edwards Air Force Base in California on June 24. The mission was accomplished in 112 orbits of the Earth, traveling in 169 hours and 39 minutes (just over one week).

The publicity tour that usually followed a Space Shuttle mission included a trip to Saudi Arabia. Married women were not permitted to travel to Saudi Arabia without their husband, and Michael Lucid was unavailable, so Lucid decided not to go. A devout Christian, she disapproved of the way Saudi Arabia treated women. When the rest of the crew arrived in Riyadh, her absence was noted. This prompted a call from King Fahd of Saudi Arabia to President Ronald Reagan. Lucid went to Saudi Arabia and shook hands with the king, but she stayed for only one day.

===STS-34===

After the STS-51-G mission, Lucid was assigned to Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM) duty. She served as the CAPCOM for the STS-51-J mission in October 1985, the STS-61-A mission in November 1985, STS-61-B mission in November and December 1985, and the STS-61-C mission in January 1986. The January 1986 Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster later that month halted Space Shuttle operations for 32 months while NASA conducted investigations and remediation. Flight crews were stood down. One consequence of the disaster was the &quot;Galileo&quot; project, an unmanned probe to Jupiter, which lost both its launch window and its ride due to the cancelation of the Shuttle-Centaur project.

On November 30, 1988, NASA announced that &quot;Galileo&quot; would be deployed by the on the STS-34 mission, which was scheduled for October 12, 1989. The mission was commanded by Donald E. Williams, with pilot Michael J. McCulley and Lucid, Ellen S. Baker and Franklin Chang-Diaz as mission specialists. The launch was delayed for five days due to a faulty Space Shuttle main engine controller, and then for an additional day due to bad weather. &quot;Atlantis&quot; lifted off from KSC on October 18.

As the lead mission specialist, Lucid was primarily responsible for the &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft, and initiated its deployment by pressing a button to separate &quot;Galileo&quot; from &quot;Atlantis&quot;. &quot;Galileo&quot; was successfully deployed six and a half hours into the flight using the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS). As this was much less powerful than the Shuttle-Centaur upper stage, &quot;Galileo&quot; had to employ a gravity assist from Venus and two from Earth, and it took six years instead of two for the &quot;Galileo&quot; to reach Jupiter. &quot;Both Ellen and I sighed a great sigh of relief, because we figured Galileo was not our concern at that point, because we&#x27;d gotten rid of it,&quot; Lucid reported. &quot;Happiness was an empty payload bay and we got happier and happier as the IUS and Galileo went further away from us.&quot; 

The mission also conducted a five-day Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SSBUV) experiment carried in the cargo bay, and experiments related to growth hormone crystal distribution (GHCD) and polymer morphology (PM), a sensor technology experiment (STEX), a mesoscale lightning experiment (MLE), a Shuttle Student Involvement Program (SSIP) experiment that investigated ice crystal formation in zero gravity, and a ground-based Air Force Maui Optical Station (AMOS) experiment. Lucid and Chang-Diaz operated the PM experiment, which used a laptop computer to collect two gigabytes of data from an infrared spectrometer to study the effects of microgravity on minerals. The crew filmed their activities with an IMAX camera. The mission completed 79 orbits of the Earth, traveling in 119 hours and 39 minutes before landing at Edwards Air Force Base on October 23.

===STS-43===
In May 1990 NASA announced that Lucid was assigned to the crew of the STS-43 mission, which was scheduled to be flown in &quot;Discovery&quot; in April 1991. The mission was commanded by John E. Blaha, with Michael A. Baker as the pilot and Lucid, G. David Low, and James C. Adamson as the mission specialists. The objective of the mission was to deploy TDRS-E, a communications satellite that would form part of NASA&#x27;s Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System.
The launch date was postponed to July 23, and the orbiter was changed to &quot;Atlantis&quot;. The launch was delayed by a day to replace a faulty integrated electronics assembly that controlled the separation of the orbiter and the external tank, and then the countdown was halted with five hours to go due to a faulty main engine controller, and the launch was postponed to August 1. Unfavorable weather prompted yet another 24-hour delay. &quot;Atlantis&quot; lifted off on August 2.
The crew deployed TDRS-E without incident using the IUS. The crew also conducted 32 physical, material and life science experiments, mostly related to the Extended Duration Orbiter and Space Station &quot;Freedom&quot;. These included experiments with the Space Station Heat Pipe Advanced Radiator ElementII (SHAREII), the Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultra-Violet (SSBUV) instrument, Tank Pressure Control Equipment (TPCE), and Optical Communications Through Windows (OCTW). There was also an auroral photography experiment (APE-B), a protein crystal growth experiment, testing of the bioserve / instrumentation technology associates materials dispersion apparatus (BIMDA), investigations into polymer membrane processing (IPMP), the space acceleration measurement system (SAMS), a solid surface combustion experiment (SSCE), use of the ultraviolet plume imager (UVPI); and the Air Force Maui optical site (AMOS) experiment.

&quot;Atlantis&quot; performed 142 orbits of the Earth, traveling in 213 hours and 21 minutes. STS-43 was the eighth mission to land at KSC, and the first one scheduled to do so since STS-61-C in January 1986.

===STS-58===

On December 6, 1991, Lucid was assigned to STS-58, the Spacelab Life Sciences2 (SLS-2) mission. This was the second mission dedicated to the study of human and animal physiology on Earth and in spaceflight. The techniques developed for this flight were intended to be precursors of those to be conducted on the Space Station &quot;Freedom&quot; and subsequent long-duration space flights. Fellow TFNG Rhea Seddon was designated as the mission payload commander, with David Wolf, like Seddon a medical doctor, as the other mission specialist. Originally scheduled as one mission, the number of Spacelab Life Sciences objectives and experiments had grown until it was split into two missions, the first of which, STS-40/SLS-1, was flown in June 1991. The rest of the crew were not named until August 27, 1992. Blaha was designated the mission commander, with pilot Richard A. Searfoss and William S. McArthur Jr. as a fourth mission specialist. A payload specialist, Martin J. Fettman, was assigned to the mission on October 29.

The with SLS-2 on board lifted off from KSC on October 18, 1993. During the fourteen-day flight the crew performed neurovestibular, cardiovascular, cardiopulmonary, metabolic and musculoskeletal medical experiments on themselves and 48 rats. The crew investigated the phenomenon of bone density loss. They also studied the effects of microgravity on their sensory perception, and the mechanism of space adaptation syndrome. To study this, on the second day of the mission Lucid and Fettman wore headsets, known as accelerometer recording units, which recorded their head movements during the day. Along with Seddon, Wolf and Fettman, Lucid collected blood and urine samples from the crew for metabolic experiments. They also drew blood from the tails of the rats to measure how weightlessness affected their red blood cell counts. They performed sixteen engineering tests aboard &quot;Columbia&quot; and twenty Extended Duration Orbiter Medical Project experiments. The mission completed 225 orbits of the Earth, traveling five million miles in 336 hours, 13 minutes and 1 second. Landing was at Edwards Air Force Base, California. On completion of this flight, Lucid had logged 838 hours and 54 minutes in space.

=== Shuttle–Mir ===

In 1992 the United States and Russia reached an agreement on cooperation in space so that Russian cosmonauts could fly on the Space Shuttles, and American astronauts on the Russian &quot;Mir&quot; space station. The prospect of a long stay on &quot;Mir&quot; was not one calculated to appeal to most astronauts: they had to learn Russian and train at Star City for a year to spend several months on board &quot;Mir&quot; carrying out science experiments with Russian cosmonauts. &quot;I was wondering what it would be like to spend a long period of time in space,&quot; Lucid later recalled. &quot;I told everybody I wanted to do it, and they couldn&#x27;t find anybody else who had volunteered. So they said: &#x27;Well OK, go do it.&#x27;&quot; In January 1995 Lucid and Blaha joined fellow astronauts Bonnie Dunbar and Norman Thagard for &quot;Mir&quot; training in Star City. On March 30, 1995, NASA announced that Lucid would be the second astronaut to stay aboard &quot;Mir&quot;, after Thagard, who arrived on the space station on March 16.

Lucid&#x27;s mission to &quot;Mir&quot; commenced on March 22, 1996, with liftoff from KSC aboard &quot;Atlantis&quot; on the STS-76 mission. &quot;Atlantis&quot; docked with &quot;Mir&quot; on March 24, and Lucid became the first American woman to live on the station. She joined cosmonauts Yuri Onufriyenko and Yuri Usachov, neither of whom spoke English. During the course of her stay aboard &quot;Mir&quot;, Lucid performed numerous life science and physical science experiments. She lit candles to study the behavior of fire in a microgravity environment; studied the way that quail embryos developed in their shells; grew protein crystals; and cultivated wheat in a tiny greenhouse. She injected herself with an immune system stimulant and collected blood and saliva samples to study the effects of microgravity on the immune system.
In her free time, she read books. One novel she enjoyed immensely was &quot;The Mirror of Her Dreams&quot;, but she reached the end only to find that it ended on a cliffhanger. &quot;I floated there, alone in Spectra, in stunned disbelief, holding only volume one,&quot; she later recalled. &quot;I was stranded, the impossibility of running to the local bookstore forefront in my mind... How could my daughter have done this to me? Who would send only one volume of a two-volume set to her mother in space?&quot; She arranged for the second volume to be sent on the next Progress resupply freighter. She left her books on &quot;Mir&quot; for later astronaut visitors, but they became inaccessible after the Progress M-34 collision in June 1997. Thagard had warned Lucid about the Russians&#x27; fondness for jellied fish and borscht. She brought a supply of M&amp;M&#x27;s and jello with her, and lived on a combination of Russian and American food.

Lucid&#x27;s return journey to KSC was made aboard &quot;Atlantis&quot;. The STS-79 mission docked with &quot;Mir&quot; on September 18, bringing Blaha as her relief, and landed back at KSC on September 26, 1996. One of the catches that released her helmet from the neck ring became stuck, and technicians had to use pliers and a screwdriver to remove it. During her stay on &quot;Mir&quot;, Lucid had spent nearly 400 hours exercising on a stationary bicycle and a treadmill, and was able to stand and walk off &quot;Atlantis&quot;. Administrator of NASA Daniel Goldin presented her with a giftwrapped box of M&amp;M&#x27;s, a gift from President Bill Clinton, since she had told him that she craved them.

In completing this mission Lucid traveled in 188 days, 4 hours, 0 minutes. This included 179 days on &quot;Mir&quot;. Her stay on &quot;Mir&quot; was not expected to last so long but her return was delayed twice, extending her stay by about six weeks. As a result of her time aboard &quot;Mir&quot;, she held the record for the most hours in orbit by a non-Russian, and most hours in orbit by a woman until June 16, 2007, when her record for longest duration spaceflight by a woman was exceeded by Sunita Williams on the International Space Station.

===CAPCOM===
Lucid had a short cameo in the 1998 film &quot;Armageddon&quot;. From 2002 to 2003, she served as Chief Scientist of NASA. Starting in 2005, she served as lead CAPCOM on the Planning (overnight) shift at the Mission Control for sixteen Space Shuttle missions, including STS-135, the final mission. On January 31, 2012, she announced her retirement from NASA.

==Later life==
Lucid retired from NASA to take care of her husband Mike, who had dementia. He died on December 25, 2014. She later wrote about this experience in her book &quot;No Sugar Added: One Family&#x27;s Saga of Dementia and Caretaking&quot; (2019). She wrote about her experiences on &quot;Mir&quot; in &quot;Tumbleweed: Six Months Living on Mir&quot; (2020).

==Awards and honors==
Lucid was awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in December 1996 (for her mission to &quot;Mir&quot;), making her the tenth person and first woman to be given this honor. She was also awarded the NASA Space Flight Medal in 1985, 1989 (twice), 1991, 1993 and 1996; the NASA Exceptional Service Medal in 1988, 1990, 1992 and 2003 (twice); and the NASA Distinguished Service Medal in 1994 and 1997. She was inducted into the International Space Hall of Fame in 1990, the Oklahoma Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1993, the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1998, and the United States Astronaut Hall of Fame in 2014. In 2002 &quot;Discover&quot; magazine recognized her as one of the fifty most important women in science.

<text>Ini Kamoze ( , born Cecil Campbell; 9 October 1957) is a Jamaican reggae artist who began his career in the early 1980s and rose to prominence in 1994 with the signature song &quot;Here Comes the Hotstepper&quot;. The single topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 as well as record charts in Denmark and New Zealand, reaching number four on the UK Singles Chart.

==Career==
He made his first single, &quot;World Affairs&quot;, in 1981. Kamoze then released a 12-inch single &quot;Trouble You A Trouble Me&quot;/&quot;General&quot; in 1983.

His self-titled debut album was released in 1984 as a six track mini-LP on Island Records. In the album notes he describes himself as a &quot;pencil thin... disentangled... six-foot vegetarian&quot;. The album included the song &quot;World a Music (Out in the Streets They Call It Merther)&quot;, which was to be sampled by Damian Marley on his 2005 hit &quot;Welcome to Jamrock&quot;. The album was recorded with and produced by Sly and Robbie, with whom he also toured internationally along with Yellowman and Half Pint. By 1988, however, Kamoze had effectively disappeared from the music scene following lukewarm reactions to his intermittent releases.

Kamoze founded his own label, releasing a compilation album &quot;Selekta Showcase&quot; which featured a popular Kamoze single titled &quot;Stress&quot;. Four years later he released his next album, &quot;16 Vibes of Ini Kamoze&quot;.

In 1994, Kamoze released the song which would become his signature, &quot;Here Comes the Hotstepper&quot;. Adopting another nickname from the song title, Kamoze would become known as the &quot;Hotstepper&quot;, from the patois for a man on the run from the law. The song was originally recorded with Philip &quot;Fatis&quot; Burrell and later remixed by Salaam Remi, and initially featured on a reggae music compilation &quot;Stir It Up&quot;, released on the Epic label. &quot;Here Comes the Hotstepper&quot; was not an entirely new composition, having roots in the song &quot;Land of 1000 Dances&quot;, which was a number one R&amp;B hit for Wilson Pickett in 1966 and was first recorded by Chris Kenner in 1962 and reprised in 1963 by Fats Domino. The remixed version of the track also incorporates the bass line from Taana Gardner&#x27;s 1981 single &quot;Heartbeat&quot;. The song appeared on the soundtrack to the fashion-industry satire feature film &quot;Prêt-à-Porter&quot;. &quot;Here Comes the Hotstepper&quot; remains Kamoze&#x27;s only US number one hit (see Hot 100 No. 1 Hits of 1994).

The success of the single sparked an intense bidding war with several major labels hoping to sign him. Kamoze signed a seven-album deal with Elektra Records in November 1994.

Kamoze&#x27;s career after this high-water mark featured the compilation album &quot;Here Comes the Hotstepper&quot; which was released in 1995 by Columbia Records (against Kamoze&#x27;s wishes), around the same time as his first album for Elektra, &quot;Lyrical Gangsta&quot;.

Both the riddim (known as &quot;World Jam&quot;) and the hook of Damian Marley&#x27;s 2005 hit &quot;Welcome to Jamrock&quot; were sampled from Kamoze&#x27;s 1984 track &quot;World-A-Music&quot;. The opening line – &quot;Out in the streets, they call it merther&quot; – has been sampled in countless drum and bass and dubstep tracks. His dub version of &quot;Here Comes the Hotstepper&quot;, otherwise known as &quot;I&#x27;m Steppin&#x27; it Hotter This Year&quot;, released in 1993, remains a dancehall anthem.

In 2005, Kamoze recorded and released a double album, &quot;Debut&quot;, on which he re-recorded a number of tracks from earlier in his career. &quot;Debut&quot; was released on his own 9 Sound Clik label.

In 2009, Kamoze released &quot;51 50 Rule&quot; on 9SoundClik. The album includes tracks such as &quot;Rapunzel&quot; (feat. Maya Azucena) and &quot;Hungry Daze&quot;. The album also had some guest features from Sizzla (&quot;R.A.W&quot;), and Busy Signal (&quot;Ta Da Bang&quot;). This was his second album released on the 9 Sound Clik label.

The artist&#x27;s most recent album release is 2016&#x27;s &quot;Ini Kamoze Meets Xterminator: Tramplin&#x27; Down Babylon&quot; on his label, 9SoundClik. This is a collection of newly recorded and previously recorded tracks that were originally released as singles on Xterminator Records by producer Phillip &quot;Fattis&quot; Burrell.

Kamoze has also written a book on the history of Port Royal, and a play, &quot;Runnings&quot;.

His name means &quot;mountain of the true God&quot;.

<text>Interstate 355 (I-355), also known as the Veterans Memorial Tollway, is an Interstate Highway and tollway in the western and southwest suburbs of Chicago in the U.S. state of Illinois. Like most other toll roads in the northeastern portion of the state, I-355 is maintained by the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority (ISTHA). I-355 runs from I-80 in New Lenox north to I-290 in Itasca, a distance of . With the exception of a expansion in 2009, from U.S. Route 34 (US 34, Ogden Avenue) to 75th Street, the highway is six lanes wide for its entire length.

The tollway authority opened I-355 as the North–South Tollway in 1989 to ease congestion on Illinois Route 53 (IL 53), a parallel two-lane state highway in central DuPage County. Initially, I-355 ran from I-55 north to I-290. The new highway helped cut travel times for commuters traveling north and south in the county. According to commercial real estate developers at the time, the new tollway also opened the western suburbs of Chicago to commercial and industrial development.

On November 11, 2007, the tollway authority opened a southern extension of I-355, which runs between I-55 and I-80. The extension was routed through Will County and a small portion of Cook County, which together formed one of Illinois&#x27; fastest-growing regions at the time. The tollway authority expected the extension to cut travel times in the region by 20 percent. Upon the extension&#x27;s opening, the tollway authority changed the name of the tollway to &quot;Veterans Memorial Tollway&quot;.

==History==

===Early history===
From 1963 to 1970, the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) planned and built a new expressway north from Army Trail Road through Schaumburg to the Northwest Tollway (now the Jane Addams Memorial Tollway). After its completion, IDOT rerouted IL 53 onto this new expressway from Rohlwing Road.

The original alignment of I-355 was defined in the Chicago Area Transportation Study (abbreviated CATS) Transportation Plan of April 1962. The plan called for a supplemental system of limited-access expressways to be built in the Chicago metropolitan area by 1980, and defined corridors where the expressways were to be located. Most of these corridors, including the Des Plaines River expressway, the Crosstown Expressway running north–south along the west side of Chicago, and most of a proposed northern extension of IL 53 were scrapped because of intense local opposition.

Initially, state and county officials anticipated building a freeway for the expressway south of Army Trail Road, similar to the existing freeway north of Army Trail Road. In 1979, Chicago mayor Jane Byrne canceled plans for the proposed Crosstown Expressway. Following the move, Congress gave the rights to half of the $200 million (equivalent to $ in ) that had been earmarked for the Crosstown Expressway to DuPage County. However, county officials found this amount insufficient for construction of the new freeway. The officials then handed authority for the project over to the tollway authority, and spent the money on other projects in the county.

In June 1984, Republican minority leader of the Illinois House of Representatives James &quot;Pate&quot; Philip helped push through legislation authorizing the construction of the tollway, then referred to as simply the DuPage Tollway. Officials at the Morton Arboretum, one of the nation&#x27;s premier woodland research centers, promptly filed a federal lawsuit to block construction of the tollway. They also promised to prevent the tollway authority from obtaining environmental approval from federal officials.

In April 1985, the two agencies came to an agreement regarding construction of the new tollway. To protect the arboretum from salt spray and other pollutants caused by cars on the tollway, the tollway authority agreed to build I-355 below grade around the perimeter of the arboretum. The tollway authority would build a water collection system to divert runoff from the arboretum. In addition, they would build earthen berms along the new road, preventing salt spray from damaging arboretum plants. In exchange, the DuPage County Forest Preserve District agreed to a 99-year lease providing of its land to the arboretum for the development of an &quot;urban vegetation laboratory&quot;. Under the agreement, Morton Arboretum agreed to charge DuPage County residents lower admissions one day of the week, build a bicycle path connecting the arboretum to nearby forest preserves, and begin a joint clean-streams program to improve the water quality of DuPage County&#x27;s lakes and streams. In January 1986, the tollway paid out $2.5 million (equivalent to $ in ) to a trust fund as a part of the settlement to help finance the arboretum&#x27;s new programs.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released a preliminary environmental impact statement on March 13, 1986. At a public hearing a month later, arboretum executives and Woodridge officials strongly criticized the report as &quot;fatally flawed&quot; and a repeat of tollway-provided research, including typographical errors. The opposition also cited outdated and inaccurate data regarding wetlands replacement, salt dispersion, and the lack of compensation to residents for lowered property values. The tollway authority agreed to run the road below-grade at 75th Street instead of as a elevated highway. In addition, they agreed to spend an extra $1 million (equivalent to $ in ) on the redesigned elevation and interchange.

The Corps of Engineers issued a permit for the tollway on October 8, 1986, rejecting last-minute concerns from the Sierra Club to reroute the toll road around sections of Churchill Woods Prairie, between Glen Ellyn and Lombard. The permit allowed the first two earth moving contracts issued by the tollway authority to move forward. The tollway authority put the total cost of of new pavement at $450 million (equivalent to $ in ). Of the total cost, $325 million (equivalent to $ in ) was allocated for construction, $30 million (equivalent to $ in ) to alleviating environmental concerns, including moving and enlarging of wetlands, and $30 million (equivalent to $ in ) for utility relocation. Work in 1987 consisted primarily of excavation, embankment building and land acquisition.

Because of problems with pavement on other roads in the system and anticipation of heavy traffic on the new Interstate, the tollway authority decided to pave I-355 with pavement expected to last 20 years. Construction workers laid concrete on the tollway to a thickness of over an sub-base. The new pavement also incorporated fly ash and less cement, allowing the pavement to achieve maximum strength faster than pure concrete.

One of the last issues settled prior to the opening of the tollway was the highway&#x27;s number. Originally, tollway officials designated the new road I-355. Early in 1988, however, the tollway administration received a letter from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) indicating that the highway should be designated as Interstate 455. FHWA policy at the time dictated that auxiliary Interstate routes that join two other Interstate Highways should start with an even number. IDOT argued the highway more closely resembles a spur from I-55. Ultimately, the tollway authority kept the I-355 designation.

Governor James R. Thompson and U.S. Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner dedicated the North–South Tollway on December 22, 1989. When it opened, officials estimated travel times from Schaumburg to Oak Brook would be reduced from 55 minutes to 34 minutes, and from Wheaton to Darien from 60 to 34 minutes. Tollway officials also estimated that 200,000 cars per day would use I-355. This figure has since been shown to be slightly optimistic, with maximum average daily traffic values approaching 170,200 only at the northern end of the Interstate. The initial length of I-355 was from I-55 north to I-290.

===Opening===

I-355 opened at the stroke of midnight on December 24, 1989. As a Christmas gift, the first two days of operation were free. Because of lower traffic counts at the north and south ends of the highway and lack of construction money, tollway officials built the road with four lanes from North Avenue (IL 64) to the Ronald Reagan Memorial Tollway (I-88) on the north end, and around I-55 on the south end. As early as 1991, tollway officials had drawn up plans to widen the highway to three lanes in each direction. Widening from North Avenue to Butterfield Road (IL 56) took place in 1995. The old lines marking the former shoulder can still be seen in the right lane as a result of the tollway authority&#x27;s attempt to grind them away.

After the new road opened, congestion decreased considerably on nearby north–south arteries. The DuPage County Division of Transportation calculated that congestion had decreased on IL 53 by 20%, and the volume of cars on nearby north–south roads IL 53, IL 59 and IL 83 had decreased. On IL 53 between Ogden Avenue and Roosevelt Road, traffic counts sank from 21,400 to 11,800 vehicles per day. In addition, traffic on the exit ramp from the Tri-State Tollway (I-294) to I-55 dropped 10 percent in 12 months. Drivers also reported decreases in travel time from one end of the county to the other of up to 40 minutes. However, the opening of the tollway also greatly increased congestion on I-290 near the northern terminus. A construction project in the summer months of 1990 widened I-290 just north of the tollway, at a cost of $2–2.5 million (equivalent to $– in ).

In spite of the apparent success of the tollway opening, traffic counts and projected toll revenues were initially lower than projected, with an estimated 65,000 motorists per day traveling along the tollway, generating $55,000–65,000 (equivalent to $– in ) in daily toll revenues. In addition, a spate of lawsuits were filed regarding the payment of contractors and subcontractors. Numerous liens filed by subcontractors against the tollway were settled in June, 1990 at a cost of $10.1 million (equivalent to $ in ). The tollway authority released an additional $1 million (equivalent to $ in ) in May 1992 to further settle claims made by the general contractor, entering arbitration soon afterwards to settle another $1.6–27 million (equivalent to $– in ) the contractor claimed it was owed. By 2005, average annual daily traffic values had risen to a range of 77,400 to 170,200 vehicles per day.

As early as 1989, the tollway authority had discussed implementing automatic toll collection across the entire system to relieve congestion caused by traffic stopping at mainline toll barriers. The tollway authority began testing I-Pass, the tollway system&#x27;s electronic payment method, on the entire stretch of I-355 in 1993 at various tollbooths; by September 1994, every plaza on I-355 accepted I-Pass. By 1998, the tollway authority had installed dedicated I-Pass lanes (lanes specifically set aside for electronic toll collections) at both mainline toll barriers. In 1999, I-355 became the first tollway to receive I-Pass Express Lanes (also known as open road tolling, or ORT). With the installation of the express lanes, vehicles with I-Pass could be tolled at highway speeds of . In 2005, the tollway authority widened the express lanes from two lanes to three lanes in each direction. This allowed the number of express lanes to match the number of travel lanes on the tollway.

Unlike the other tollways in the tollway system at the time, there were no oases on the Veterans Memorial Tollway when it was opened. This is primarily due to the widespread access to food and fuel throughout the western suburbs when construction began in the late 1980s. When the southern extension was opened in Will County in 2007, that segment of road also did not have any oases.

===Southern extension===

In addition to the original alignment of I-355, the Transportation Plan of April 1962 included the concept of a route that ran from Bolingbrook south to Joliet. After the northern portion of I-355 opened in 1989, the Illinois General Assembly authorized the tollway authority to begin studying the southern extension of I-355.

The discovery of the Hine&#x27;s Emerald Dragonfly, an endangered species, and related concerns for the environmental health of the Des Plaines River wetlands in 1995, ignited a series of legal challenges that delayed construction of the I-355 extension for several years. The Sierra Club filed a lawsuit in 1996 to block planning of the southern extension. In January 1997, a federal judge sided with the Sierra Club, halting construction of the southern extension while the state appealed. In 1999, the state dropped its appeal and amended the environmental impact study (EIS) to meet the Sierra Club&#x27;s concerns. The state released the supplemental EIS in 2000, and in 2002 the FHWA issued a Record of Decision, allowing construction of the tollway to proceed after six years of delays. Land acquisition and utility relocation took place in 2004. Governor Rod Blagojevich&#x27;s $5.6 billion Congestion-Relief Program for the Illinois Tollway passed the General Assembly in September 2004, with $729.3 million being set aside for the extension (equivalent to $ and $ in , respectively). Bidding on an excavation contract passed on November 18, 2004 with construction beginning several days later.

To document and reduce the impact of construction on the dragonfly&#x27;s habitat, construction crews agreed to keep carcasses of any dragonfly kills. In addition, the tollway authority funded the construction of separate habitats for the dragonfly near the Waterfall Glen Forest Preserve in Lemont and in two other preserves in Cook and Will counties. In late 2005, construction began on the roadway of the southern extension of I-355 from I-55 in Bolingbrook to I-80 in New Lenox.

Another controversy erupted in February 2006, when the tollway authority threatened to build the tollway with no interchanges unless the suburbs through which the new extension ran contributed $20 million (equivalent to $ in ) for construction of the interchanges. This marked the first time that the tollway authority had required local municipalities to contribute funds for interchange construction. The towns of Homer Glen, Lemont, New Lenox, Lockport and Will County agreed in a June 2006 intergovernmental agreement to provide $20 million in both cash and in-kind contributions for the interchanges.

The southern extension is expected to become an economic catalyst for municipalities located along the tollway. The Village of New Lenox estimates that it will receive an additional $12 million in sales taxes after its two malls are built out. In Lockport, officials have announced that new Home Depot and SuperTarget stores are planned for the areas near 159th Street and I-355. Commercial developers are also building large warehouse facilities in areas near the Lockport interchanges.

One of &quot;the most impressive engineering feats on the state&#x27;s of toll roads&quot; is the Des Plaines River Valley Bridge, a bridge over the Des Plaines River, the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, the Illinois and Michigan Canal, Bluff Road, New Avenue, numerous railroads, and a major Commonwealth Edison utility corridor. The bridge is long, and constituted $125 million of the cost of the extension. Work on the bridge included the construction of 34 piers and elevation of existing high-voltage electricity lines to accommodate the highway. To limit the number of piers in the valley, the tollway authority built the bridge with both pre-stressed bulb tee girders and post-tensioned segmental concrete girders. This was $12 million (equivalent to $ in ) cheaper than the concrete box girder design option, and $50 million (equivalent to $ in ) less than the steel plate girder design option. A design-build clause in the original contract for the bridge, in addition to success in the design-build contracts on the 2004–07 Tri-State Tollway widening and reconstruction, allowed project managers to redesign and build the new bridge.

The tollway authority held a ribbon cutting and dedication ceremony on Veterans Day (November 11), 2007, officially renaming the entire length of I-355 the Veterans Memorial Tollway. Ceremonies were held on the tollway near the 127th Street interchange in Lemont, at 147th Street in Homer Glen, and at US 6 in New Lenox. In addition to the dedication, the tollway authority sponsored a Charity Walk/Run/Roll and &quot;Roll the Tollway&quot;, a charity pre-opening bicycle ride on the highway&#x27;s south extension. After noting the success of the festival, a tollway spokesman announced plans to repeat the event annually, including the closure of the entire southern extension. He later clarified the tollway&#x27;s position, indicating that while the extension would probably not be closed in its entirety in the future, a possible ride across the Des Plaines River Valley Bridge may be held. At around 10:00 p.m. on November 11, a group of Illinois State Police vehicles and tollway maintenance vehicles escorted the first motorists southbound along the I-355 extension, stopping at each interchange to remove barricades. By the time the maintenance crews began to remove barricades along the northbound lanes of the extension, a group of 50 to 60 vehicles had gathered behind the crews.

===Veterans Memorial Trail===
As part of constructing the southern extension, the tollway authority donated a corridor to local municipalities for the construction of a multi-use trail, named the Veterans Memorial Trail, that will run along most of the length of the tollway from I-80 to I-55. Completion of the trail is expected to cost $10 million, with funding to be provided by local communities along the path. A new construction fund for the trail was created from registration fees collected for &quot;Roll the Tollway&quot;. The Active Transportation Alliance announced on January 29, 2008 that about $108,000 (equivalent to $ in ) was raised through &quot;Roll the Tollway&quot;. Of this amount, $70,000 (equivalent to $ in ) was set aside for preliminary engineering studies on the bicycle trail. The remaining amount was directed towards advocacy efforts for the Chicago Bicycle Federation and other local bicycle clubs.

The initial engineering phase of the bike trail has been completed in the form of the I-355 Area Trails Master Plan, a framework created by Housel Lavigne Associates designed to distribute the work of creating and funding the trail among local communities. The Forest Preserve District of Will County has begun work on the Veterans Memorial Trail from International Parkway, Woodridge, to 135th Street, Romeoville, and will then extend the trail to US 6 in the Village of New Lenox. This addition will link the trail to a number of businesses in New Lenox, including a shopping mall currently being constructed, Silver Cross Hospital, and medical offices. The Omnibus Appropriations Act included $470,000 (equivalent to $ in ) in federal funding for construction of the first phase of the trail.

==Route description==

The southern terminus of I-355 is northeast of New Lenox, where the highway intersects I-80. I-355 is routed north and slightly west through rural, hilly portions of Will County. Just after the US 6 interchange (mile 1.0), tollway drivers pay a toll at Spring Creek Toll Plaza, the only toll plaza on the southern extension of I-355. It continues north through the rural sections of Will County, having exits that serve the towns of Homer Glen and Lockport. At 135th Street (approximately mile 8.0) in Lemont, I-355 briefly enters Cook County. After an interchange at 127th Street (mile 9.0), I-355 crosses over the Des Plaines River on the Des Plaines River Valley Bridge before returning to Will County. Shortly north of the bridge, I-355 intersects I-55 at Bolingbrook (mile 12.5). Multiple flyover ramps connect all directions of both highways.

North of I-55, I-355 continues to run almost due north through the established western suburbs of Chicago in DuPage County. Travelers pay another toll just north of Boughton Road, at the Boughton Road Toll Plaza (mile 13.5). Continuing north, I-355 has another multiple flyover interchange with I-88 (miles 19.5 and 23.0), officially designated the Ronald Reagan Memorial Tollway. On the southern end of the interchange, northbound I-355 has exits to both directions of I-88. I-355 then swings below I-88 and runs side-by-side with the other tollway for . Southbound exits to both directions of I-88 are at the northern end of the interchange. At the Army Trail Road Toll Plaza (mile 29.0), through traffic pays the last toll of the tollway. I-355 has no tolls north of the Army Trail Road exit (mile 30) in Addison. There is one untolled exit (mile 31.5) at US 20 (Lake Street) north of the tollway. I-355 terminates at the I-290 interchange near the border of the villages of Itasca and Addison.

As a result of a toll rate increase effective January 1, 2012, the northernmost two toll plazas (Boughton Road and Army Trail Road) charge $1.90 cash and $0.95 for cars with I-Pass and E-ZPass. The Spring Creek Toll Plaza charges $3.80 for travelers paying with cash and $1.90 for I-Pass and E-ZPass. All three toll plazas force traffic paying with cash to exit right into an area separate from the dedicated I-Pass lanes. Drivers paying with cash then pay their tolls at staffed plaza tollbooths. I-Pass and E-ZPass equipped cars and trucks are permitted to stay on the mainline and pay tolls at highway speeds in the tollway&#x27;s ORT lanes.

On I-355, the only control cities that are actual cities are Joliet, St. Louis, Missouri, and from I-80, Rockford. Other control cities on I-355 are limited to general areas of suburban Chicago. For example, control cities for I-355 while on I-55 are &quot;West Suburbs&quot; and &quot;Southwest Suburbs&quot;. The control city for areas north of I-88 are &quot;Northwest Suburbs&quot;.

Because of increasing congestion, the Veterans Memorial Tollway has been widened to eight lanes between 75th Street and US 34. The tollway authority added the , $60.4-million project (equivalent to $ in ) to its Congestion Relief Plan in mid-2007, and the new lanes opened on October 24, 2009.

<text>Kontakt-5 is a type of second-generation explosive reactive armour (ERA) originating in the Soviet Union. Due to the shortcomings of Kontakt-1, NII Stali developed a new type of reactive armor, Kontakt-5, so that it also affects the penetration characteristics of APFSDS projectiles, unlike Kontakt-1. In addition, Kontakt-5 is not just additional armor, but is clearly integrated into the vehicle hull. The Kontakt-5 modules have a significantly thicker steel upper side. Depending on the module, they contain one or two 4S22 reactive elements. The explosive of a 4S22 element has the TNT equivalent of 330 g. It is sensitive enough to be activated by impacts from armor-piercing projectiles as well as shaped charge warheads. Kontakt-5 produces a stronger defensive detonation than Kontakt-1 and the thicker steel flyer plate thrown at the APFSDS projectile breaks or bends it. The increase in defensive capability led to the development of more advanced APFSDS projectiles.

Kontakt-5 was first observed on a T-80U in 1985. Later, the T-72B, T-84 and T-90 tanks were also equipped with Kontakt-5. In addition, the T-55, T-62 and BMP-3 tank models can also be equipped or upgraded with Kontakt-5. According to the manufacturer, Kontakt-5 is the first type of reactive armor that effectively protects armored vehicles against tandem shaped charges.

Total mass of Kontakt-5 reactive armor: 2.8 - 3.0 t,
Protective effect (RHA equivalent):
against APFSDS: 200 – 250 mm,
against shaped charges (HEAT): 600 mm,

==Description==

Introduced on the T-80U tank in 1985, Kontakt-5 is made up of &quot;bricks&quot; of explosive sandwiched between two metal plates. The plates are arranged in such a way as to move sideways rapidly when the explosive detonates. This forces an incoming kinetic energy penetrator or shaped charge jet to cut through more armour than the thickness of the plating itself since &quot;new&quot; plating is constantly fed into the penetrating body. A kinetic energy penetrator is also subject to powerful sideways forces which may cut the rod into two or more pieces. This significantly reduces the penetrating capabilities of the penetrator, since the penetrating force will be dissipated over a larger volume of armour.

Newer KE penetrators like the US M829A3 were &quot;driven by the need to counter KE-effective explosive reactive armor (ERA)&quot;.

Relikt was designed by the Russian army in response to the new developments. Relikt is the 3rd generation of Russian ERA, and is claimed to be twice as effective as Kontakt-5. It can be installed on T-72B and T-90 tanks and was adopted in 2006. The Russian Army T-72B3M main battle tank incorporates Relikt. Developed by NII Stali, Relikt uses a completely new composition of explosives to achieve dynamics protection. Unlike Kontakt-1, it works equally reliably against both low-velocity and high-velocity missiles, doubling protection against shaped charges and increasing anti-tank guided missile protection by 50 percent. Relikt defends against tandem warheads and reduces penetration of APFSDS rounds by over 50 percent.

Kontakt-5 armour is employed by Russia, Ukraine, India (T-90S) and Serbia (on M-84AS MBT), among others.

Monolith (which is often confused with the &quot;Malachit&quot; that was used on the Objekt.187) is the latest (4th) generation Russian explosive reactive armor, mounted on Armata project vehicles.

<text>Robert Don Hunter Dougan () is an Australian composer, known for his genre-blending music. Mixing elements of orchestral music, trip hop, and bluesy vocals, his work is tangentially relatable to electronic music. He is known primarily for his breakthrough 1995 single &quot;Clubbed to Death (Kurayamino Variation)&quot;, further popularised by 1999&#x27;s &quot;The Matrix&quot; soundtrack. &quot;Clubbed to Death&quot; was re-released on his debut album &quot;Furious Angels&quot; in 2002, seven years after its initial release, as well as providing several variations of the song, most notably the Kurayamino variation; he has also provided a variation of the Moby song &quot;Porcelain&quot;. In 1995, he teamed up with Rollo Armstrong to remix the U2 song &quot;Numb&quot;; the remix was titled &quot;Numb (Gimme Some More Dignity Mix)&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Dougan was born in Melbourne, Australia in 1969 to Don and Margaret. One of six children, he was raised in Sydney, where he attended Saint Ignatius&#x27; College, Riverview and, later, the National Institute of Dramatic Art, where he studied acting. In one interview he recalled the only albums in the family home were of Beethoven, Louis Armstrong, Cleo Laine and Ennio Morricone. In 1990, he travelled to London and began to work in music with his friend Rollo, both of whom had worked together and released material in Australia. He moved permanently to London in 1996.
==Career==
From 1991 to 1995, Dougan was a producer and remix artist. In 1994, his remixes started charting in the United Kingdom. He also released his first single, &quot;Hard Times&quot;.

In 1995, his hit single &quot;Clubbed to Death&quot; gave him a recognised name in the UK dance club scene. He produced half a dozen remixes of it, including the &quot;Kurayamino Variation&quot;. His label Mo&#x27; Wax Records was pleased and commissioned the follow-up, &quot;Clubbed to Death 2&quot; (later the bonus track on the album). CTD2 was never released as a single, but appeared on the James Lavelle disc of the 1996 DJ mix compilation album, &quot;Cream Live 2&quot;. During this time, he&#x27;s said to have contributed music to &quot;Impossible Princess&quot;, the studio album of fellow Australian, Kylie Minogue.

&quot;Furious Angels&quot; was not released on Mo&#x27; Wax, but Dougan eventually released it as a single in 1998 on Rollo&#x27;s label Cheeky Records. Dougan worked for the following six years, doing remixes and licensing his tracks, in order to self-produce the album, which was backed by a full orchestra and a full choir. &quot;Furious Angels&quot; also featured as the musical score accompanying the introduction sequence for the 2000 racing simulation game &quot;Grand Prix 3&quot;.

In 1999, his exposure increased dramatically when his &quot;Clubbed to Death (Kurayamino Variation)&quot; was featured on the soundtrack of &quot;The Matrix&quot;. He contributed two more tracks to the soundtrack of 2003&#x27;s &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;, &quot;Château&quot; and &quot;Kung Fu&quot; (a shortened version of &quot;Furious Angels&quot; made for &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;). Some of the orchestral material for these tracks was recorded at 20th Century Fox Newman Scoring Stage where &quot;Star Wars&quot; had been scored. &quot;I&#x27;m Not Driving Anymore (instrumental)&quot; was also used for the trailer of the film and as background music for the DVD menu. The song was also featured in the 2001 racing movie &quot;Driven&quot; with vocals. He credits this career breakthrough to support of American DJ Jason Bentley.

In 2002 in the UK, and 2003 in the rest of the world, Dougan released his debut album &quot;Furious Angels&quot;, which was met with &quot;Generally favorable&quot; reviews from critics. Later in 2003, a two-disc re-release of &quot;Furious Angels&quot; featured all-instrumental versions on the second disc. 

In 2006, Dougan was reportedly writing &quot;a couple of songs&quot; for Sugababes (for whom he produced the single &quot;Too Lost in You&quot;), and working on two albums of his own — one original, one classical.

A short film made for jewelry designer Solange Azagury-Partridge, &quot;The Letter&quot;, directed by Laurence Dunmore and starring Thandie Newton and Jason Isaacs features new music by Rob Dougan; the short film, however, does not mention the title of the song.

In May 2015, Dougan released &quot;The 22nd Sunday in Ordinary Time Sessions&quot; on his official site. The EP, recorded at London&#x27;s Air Lyndhurst Studios with a 84-piece orchestra and 50-voice choir, consists of five instrumental songs and a 20-minute film of the sessions.

In October 2016, Dougan released &quot;Misc. Sessions&quot; EP on his official site. The EP, recorded at Abbey Road Studios with a 10-piece and 50-piece string section, consists of five tracks, with orchestra and instrumental mixes and an 18-minute film.

In 2018 Dougan compiled and released &quot;&quot; his first solely instrumental release, comprising 21 tracks available for the first time on vinyl, CD and digital download. The album was released via direct-to-fan company PledgeMusic just at the time that the organisation announced it was experiencing issues and had failed to pay many artistes the monies that had been pledged to them. In a personal project update posted on 18 February, Rob confirmed that he had been affected by the issues but, having already released the album digitally, had met the costs of physical releases himself, with the CD, vinyl and accompanying book due for release on 4 March 2019.

In February 2019, Dougan released &quot;The Life of the World to Come&quot;, a brand new four track EP which includes &quot;The Life of the World to Come&quot;, &quot;Beautiful Things&quot;, &quot;Quasimodo&#x27;s Dream&quot; and &quot;And Then I Think of You&quot;. Each song was released with an accompanying instrumental version and two of the tracks were cover versions - &quot;Beautiful Things&quot; written by Leslie Bricusse and &quot;Quasimodo&#x27;s Dream&quot; by The Reels. The EP is published by Engard Ltd and was released by Dougan himself via Gumroad.

==Style==
Dougan&#x27;s vocal style has been compared to Tom Waits and Leonard Cohen, his composition approach to that of film score composers John Barry and Barry Adamson. He frequently uses orchestral elements in his music, notably Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Enigma Variations&quot; in &quot;Clubbed to Death (The First Mix).&quot; Though placed in the camp of dance and techno, in an interview with &quot;the Guardian&quot; early in his career, Dougan distanced himself from the genre, identifying more strongly with Classical music:&quot;I&#x27;m associated with dance music, with electronica, which makes me feel ill. I only learnt all the boring computer crap as a means to an end. Virtually all musicians these days use computers, but if you write a book on a computer, nobody calls it electronic writing... I know it&#x27;s not a fashionable attitude, but there is a musical hierarchy, and writing a song is not the same as writing a symphony. Classical music is a lot harder to do: it&#x27;s richer, and it will leave you with more.&quot; 

== Non-musical activities ==
In 2004, Dougan founded a vineyard called La Pèira in the Terrasses du Larzac region of France.

<text>Chaffey College is a public community college in Rancho Cucamonga, California. The college serves students in Chino, Chino Hills, Fontana, Montclair, Ontario, Rancho Cucamonga and Upland. It is the oldest community college in California.

==History==
The school was established in Ontario, California, in 1883, when city founders and brothers George and William Chaffey donated land and established an endowment for a private college. The private school was founded as the Chaffey College of Agriculture through the University of Southern California; USC, also a private university, had been founded three years earlier in nearby Los Angeles. The cornerstone of the new school was laid on March 17, 1883, at Fourth and Euclid in Ontario; it opened on October 15, 1885. The original institution included a secondary school and was run by USC until 1901. During this period, Chaffey&#x27;s football team had a 1–1 series with the young USC football team, winning 32–6 in 1893 and losing 38–0 in 1897.
Financial troubles forced the school to close in 1901. The building was taken over by the city and became the home of Ontario High School (now Chaffey High School). In 1906 the Chaffey endowment was legally separated from USC and reorganized to benefit the newly created Chaffey Union High School District. When Ontario High school opened to students from Upland in 1911, its present name was adopted. In 1916, the Chaffey Junior College of Agriculture was added as a postgraduate department to the high school. The school&#x27;s buildings were renovated and additional buildings added during the New Deal.

A separate junior college district was created in 1922 and in 1957 bonds were approved in support of a complete separation of the high school and college facilities. The current location in Rancho Cucamonga opened in the spring of 1960. The college&#x27;s mascot is the Panther.

President Bill Clinton visited Chaffey in 1996, announcing a proposal to finance two years of community college education to expand the basic education of all Americans to 14 years. Chaffey launched its online education program in 1999.

Voters in 2002 approved the Measure L bond, providing up to $230 million in bonds during a 10-year period for the Facilities Master Plan. Through Measure L, Chaffey built its Chino campus in 2002 and expanded the Fontana campus, which opened in 1996. In 2017, Chaffey was named a top 10 community college in the nation by the Aspen Institute. Philanthropist MacKenzie Scott awarded Chaffey with a $25 million gift in 2021 because of Chaffey’s dedication to equity.

The college’s passage of Measure P in 2018 allowed Chaffey to make repairs, upgrades and improvements at its three campuses. Plans are underway to build a fourth campus in Ontario.

== Academics ==
Chaffey offers associate degrees and certificates. Chaffey offers one of the oldest aviation programs in the United States.

==Athletics==
The college athletic teams are nicknamed the Panthers. Teams compete in the Inland Empire Athletic Conference and National Central Conference annually.

<doc id="501440" wikidata="Q1046135" url="?curid=501440" title="Empower Field at Mile High">
<text>Empower Field at Mile High is an American football stadium in Denver, Colorado. Its primary tenant is the Denver Broncos of the National Football League (NFL). It opened in 2001 to replace the Broncos&#x27; original home, the old Mile High Stadium. The venue was previously home of the Denver Outlaws lacrosse team and the Colorado Rapids soccer team. It has also played host to countless concerts and served as the venue for Barack Obama&#x27;s acceptance of the Democratic presidential nomination at the 2008 Democratic National Convention.

The stadium is nicknamed &quot;Mile High&quot; due to not only its predecessor, but due to the city&#x27;s elevation of 1 mile or above sea level. Given the difficulty of competing at altitude, as well as the notoriously loud fans, the Broncos are known to have one of the best home field advantages in the NFL.

On March 24, 2022, a fire broke out that damaged some suites and many seats on the third level. The fire was caused by sparks from a welding torch.

== Financing ==

=== Legislative effort ===
The Broncos&#x27; pursuit of the new stadium included a lobbying effort that included 13 lawyers and tens of thousands of dollars. This effort was directed at the passing of SB 171 which put Referendum 4A on the November 1998 ballot. SB 171 was sponsored by Representative Doug Dean (R) from Colorado Springs. Members of the state legislature claimed that this was one of the largest lobbying efforts they had seen.

In November 1998, Denver voters passed referendum 4A which was in favor of the construction of a new football stadium to replace the existing Mile High Stadium. The referendum was included on the ballots of six Colorado counties that comprise the Denver Metropolitan area. The referendum called for the extension of a tenth of a percent sales tax on transactions within the Metro area to go towards the cost of issuing a $224.9 million bond. This tax was originally established in 1990 when the Colorado Rockies sought public financing for Coors Field. Financing and construction for the stadium was monitored by the Metropolitan Football Stadium District (MFSD). The MFSD is a subdivision of the State of Colorado that, &quot;was created for the purpose of planning, acquiring land and constructing a professional football stadium&quot;. The MFSD is also responsible for implementing the MFSD tax. The extension of the original stadium tax came into effect on January 1, 2001.

The funding deal between the Broncos and the State of Colorado called for the team to pay 25% of the estimated cost of $400 million while the state would pay the other 75% of the cost. Part of the agreement stipulated that the MFSD would collect half of the 10 year, $120 million naming rights deal with Invesco Funds Group. Upon Sports Authority&#x27;s bankruptcy, the Broncos agreed to pay the MFSD $3.6 million to assume ownership of the naming rights of the stadium.

== Corporate partners ==

=== Naming rights ===

Invesco paid $120 million for the original naming rights in 2001, before Sports Authority secured them in August 2011.

Despite its sponsor&#x27;s liquidation and closure in 2016, the Sports Authority name remained on the stadium for two years afterwards because of regulatory hurdles. The Broncos announced on January 2, 2018, that the stadium&#x27;s exterior signage would be removed. The stadium took on a temporary name, Broncos Stadium at Mile High, for the remainder of 2018 - including the 2018 NFL season - and part of 2019 before a new corporate naming rights agreement with Colorado-based Empower was announced on September 4, 2019.

=== Concessions ===
Concessions are currently run by Aramark Corporation. Aramark took over concession at the beginning of the 2019 season as Empower Retirement assumed the naming rights. As part of their offerings, Aramark has partnered with several Denver restaurants to provide a more robust selection of food options. The new partners include Frank Bonanno, a Denver restaurateur known for his many popular restaurants around downtown Denver.

== Improvements ==
On December 21, 2012, the Broncos announced a $30 million renovation project prior to the start of the 2013 season, including a new HD LED video board on the stadium&#x27;s south end zone that tripled the size of the video board used in the early 2000s.

In 2013, it was revealed that a Neil Smith Kansas City Chiefs jersey was buried somewhere near the 50-yard line by a couple of out-of-state contractors during renovations, despite Smith&#x27;s play on the Broncos&#x27; Super Bowl XXXII and XXXIII-winning teams. The curse the contractors hoped to create did not occur as the Broncos won another Super Bowl two years later, Super Bowl 50.

In an effort to be selected as a host city for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the MFSD invested $8.3 million on stadium improvements to satisfy FIFA&#x27;s requirements. Included in the improvements are the addition of LED lights as well as locker room and seating upgrades.

On December 14, 2022, the Broncos announced more than $100 million in upgrades to the stadium that would be completed during the off season and in time for the 2023 season. Upgrades include expanding the video board and an all-inclusive hospitality club on field level. In August 2023, the Broncos debuted the improvements, including the new scoreboard, measuring wide by tall, making it the fifth largest screen in any NFL stadium.

== Controversies ==

=== Naming rights ===
During construction of the new stadium, Denver mayor, Wellington Webb opposed the sale of the stadium&#x27;s naming rights. At this time, the potential partners were AT&amp;T, Janus Capital, and Invesco Funds Group. A group called Friends of Mile High created a poll asking whether fans preferred the old name or would be fine with a corporate sponsor. The poll found that 70% of respondents preferred to keep the name as Mile High despite a potential loss of $89 million in revenue for the state.

Many fans opposed a corporate name and wished to retain the previous venue&#x27;s name, &quot;Mile High Stadium.&quot; &quot;The Denver Post&quot; initially refused to use the Invesco label and referred to it as Mile High Stadium for several years before changing its policy and adding Invesco to articles.

On August 16, 2011, the Metropolitan Stadium District announced Invesco would immediately transfer the naming rights to Englewood-based Sports Authority in a 25-year agreement worth $6 million per year. In August 2016, the Denver Broncos paid $3,601,890 to the Metropolitan Football Stadium District to purchase the naming rights to the stadium. As the naming rights change began to occur, the MFSD sought permission to install larger signs on the newly named stadium. Residents of the neighborhood sought to block the installation of new signs in an effort to keep light pollution down. Neighborhood complaints included concerns about light pollution as well as the aesthetic value of the Sports Authority sign that the MFSD hoped to install on the stadium.

In 2016, several Colorado legislators attempted to pass a bill in the Colorado State Legislature that would require the &quot;Mile High&quot; moniker regardless of any naming rights deal, citing the large public contribution to the stadium&#x27;s construction; the bill failed to pass out of a Senate Committee in May 2016.

Many citizens of the surrounding neighborhoods have expressed discontent with the impact of the stadium on their environment. Residents have complained about the increased traffic and frequent public urination by intoxicated fans on game days.

=== Financing ===
A 2016 study by the Brookings Institution has found that the federal government lost out on significant tax revenue in their deal with the Broncos to pay for the stadium. The study of 36 professional football stadiums found that the tax-exempt municipal bonds caused $49 million in lost tax revenue for the federal government. Additionally, the income tax break that bond holders could claim cost the government an additional $5 million.

==Usage==

The stadium is used primarily for American football games. It is the home field for Denver&#x27;s National Football League team, the Denver Broncos. The stadium previously hosted one of the city&#x27;s Major League Lacrosse teams, the Denver Outlaws. In college football, it has hosted the rivalry game between the Colorado State University Rams and the University of Colorado Boulder Buffaloes. It is also used for the CHSAA class 4A and 5A Colorado high school football state championship games, and has been used for the CBA Marching Band Finals.

In addition, it has been used for a Drum Corps International (DCI) Championship in 2004 and the annual Drums Along the Rockies competition. It is also used for concerts, music festivals and other events, and was home to the city&#x27;s Major League Soccer franchise, the Colorado Rapids, before that team built and moved into Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods Park in suburban Commerce City.

On June 23, 2018, England played New Zealand in a rugby league match at the stadium. England won the match 36–18.

==Location==
The construction of the stadium marked the completion of a six-year sporting venue upgrade program in Denver, including the construction of Coors Field and of Pepsi Center. As with the other venues, the stadium was constructed to be easily accessible. It sits along Interstate 25 near the Colfax Avenue and 17th Avenue exits. It is also bordered by Federal Boulevard, a major Denver thoroughfare, on the west side. A dedicated light rail station also serves the stadium. The stadium is located in the Sun Valley neighborhood.

==Stadium culture and traditions==

A home game tradition (carried over from the original Mile High Stadium) is the &quot;Incomplete Chant.&quot; At Broncos home games, when the opposing team throws an incomplete pass, the stadium announcer will state &quot;Pass thrown by [the opposing quarterback] intended for [the opposing intended receiver] is...&quot; at which time the fans complete the sentence by shouting &quot;IN-COM-PLETE!!&quot;. The Broncos filed to register a trademark for the chant in 2020. In a tradition carried over from Mile High Stadium, the stadium&#x27;s public-address announcer will give the final official attendance for the game, including the number of unused tickets; in response, Broncos fans &quot;boo&quot; the no-shows. During the stadium&#x27;s first years, in another tradition that was carried over from Mile High, Broncos fans on one side of the stadium would chant &quot;Go&quot; and fans on the other side would respond &quot;Broncos,&quot; back and forth chanting for several minutes. That tradition has since died out. Another long-term tradition is famed rowdiness of fans seated in the &quot;South Stands,&quot; although this tradition has diminished significantly as well. Finally, especially in the upper two decks, the fans create their own &#x27;Mile High Thunder&#x27; (and warm themselves) by stamping their feet on the stadium&#x27;s floors. The old Mile High Stadium was built with bare metal, and the &#x27;Thunder&#x27; reverberated readily. The new stadium was built with steel floors to preserve this unique acoustic feature.

The stadium also continued the tradition of displaying Bucky the Bronco, a high replica of Roy Rogers horse, Trigger, on top of the main scoreboard.

The stadium has sold out every Denver Broncos&#x27; home game since its inception in , extending the &quot;sold-out&quot; streak that began during the team&#x27;s tenure at Mile High Stadium, where every home game had been sold out since (though due to NFL policy, local TV broadcasts of sold-out games did not start until ).

==Notable events==

===NFL events===
On September 10, 2001, the stadium hosted its first regular season NFL game, in which the Broncos defeated the New York Giants 31–20. In a pre-game ceremony, Broncos legends John Elway, Steve Atwater, Randy Gradishar, Haven Moses, Billy Thompson, Floyd Little, Dennis Smith, and Karl Mecklenburg helped to &quot;Move the Thunder&quot; from the old Mile High Stadium to the new home of the Broncos. As this inaugural game happened to fall on the day before 9/11, it has been referenced by survivor Pasquale Buzzelli in an interview with Joe Budden.

The stadium has hosted several NFL playoff games. It hosted the 2005 AFC Divisional playoff game, in which Denver defeated the New England Patriots 27–13. The following week, it hosted the AFC Championship Game, which the Broncos lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers, 34–17. On January 8, 2012, the stadium hosted its third NFL playoff game, an AFC Wild Card playoff game against the Steelers. The Broncos won in overtime, 29–23. On January 12, 2013, the stadium hosted its fourth NFL playoff game, an AFC Divisional playoff game against the Baltimore Ravens. The Broncos lost to the Ravens 38–35 in double overtime.

On October 29, 2007, a record crowd of 77,160 watched the Broncos lose to the Green Bay Packers 19–13 on Monday Night Football on the first play from scrimmage in overtime.

===Other notable events===

The stadium has hosted other sports events. The first football game held (college, on September 1, 2001; attendance 75,022) was the Rocky Mountain Showdown, when the University of Colorado Buffaloes defeated the Colorado State University Rams 41–14. On July 2, 2005, it hosted the 2005 Major League Lacrosse All-Star Game. In 2006, Major League Lacrosse placed the expansion Outlaws in Denver.

In August 1977, 1978 and 2004, it hosted the Drum Corps International (DCI) World Championships, and every July hosts Drums Along the Rockies, which is a major competition in the annual DCI summer tour. Drums Along the Rockies is the longest-running event held at any Mile High named stadium, from 1963 through 2019. Although canceled in 2020 due to the COVID Pandemic, the event returned in 2021.

On August 28, 2008, Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama accepted the Democratic Party&#x27;s nomination for President of the United States here, moving the 2008 Democratic National Convention from Ball Arena. Approximately 84,000 people attended Obama&#x27;s speech, exceeding the normal capacity of the stadium due to the placement of audience on the field.

On April 13, 2019, the stadium hosted its first AMA Supercross Championship event.

On April 27, 2019, the stadium hosted its first Monster Jam show. On April 23, 2022, it hosted another.

The stadium was a candidate venue for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, however it was not chosen by FIFA as one of the 16 venues to host to the tournament.

==Denver Broncos Ring of Fame==
The Denver Broncos Ring of Fame was created in 1984 by team owner Pat Bowlen to honor former players and administrators who played significant roles in the franchise&#x27;s history. The names and years of service (and in most cases, jersey numbers) of the men inducted into the ring are displayed on the Level 5 facade of the stadium. There is no specific number of new members that may be chosen for induction in any given year; in many years, no new members were inducted.

While the Ring of Fame was carried over from the old stadium to the new, the names were re-ordered to separate the inductees who served the team during the pre-Pat Bowlen (the team&#x27;s owner until 2019 and founder of the Ring) era from those who served during Bowlen&#x27;s ownership. One of the most noticeable changes was the move of John Elway&#x27;s name to the center of the ring, located directly between the goalposts of the north end zone.

==Colorado Sports Hall of Fame Museum==
The Colorado Sports Hall of Fame Museum opened in August 2001. It is located at Gate #1 on the west side of the stadium.

==2022 fire==
A fire broke out on March 24, 2022, destroying several sections of third row seats and fourth-level suites, though no injuries were reported. The fire caused damage to approximately &quot;1000 feet of seating.&quot; The cause of the fire was determined to be from a welding torch being used on an expansion joint. The fire also forced Empower Field at Mile High staff to reorganize events scheduled to take place at the stadium. The damage was said to be a &quot;real challenge&quot; to repair in time for the next Denver Broncos regular season, due to damage to steel risers and difficulties in procuring replacement materials.

<text>Cream was a music promotion trio (Darren Hughes, James Barton and Andy Carroll&lt;ref name=&quot;dmcworld/ibiza-scandal&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;) that originally began hosting a weekly house music club night&lt;ref name=&quot;theguardian/influential-nightclubs&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc/35189624&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (1992–2002)&lt;ref name=&quot;liverpoolecho/9520760&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; at the now-demolished Nation nightclub (formerly &quot;Snobs Disco&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;uncoverliverpool/30-years-cream&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;) in Wolstenholme Square in Liverpool. It ran in this format from October 1992 to June 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;ministryofsound/vhs-cream-1995&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Cream has counted Steve Lawler and Yousef amongst its resident DJs.

Cream also hosts the dance music festival Creamfields every August in Daresbury, Cheshire. Creamfields has won the award for Best Dance Event at the UK Festival Awards a record six times since the awards began 10 years ago, most recently in December 2014. In 2010, they also won the Music Week award for &quot;Festival of the Year&quot;.

In 2012, Live Nation acquired the Creamfields Festival Brand from Cream on a contract basis .

Cream&#x27;s home in Wolstenholme Square, Liverpool, was demolished in 2016 as part of an urban regeneration project. Plans to build a new home for the nightclub as part of the development were retrospectively removed from the planning application.

==Cream Ibiza==
Every Thursday during the Ibiza clubbing season Cream hosts a club night at Amnesia.

==Releases==
The label has had a history of releasing DJ mix albums, originally from their own label and later Deconstruction Records (1995–98), Virgin/EMI (1998–03), WEA (2004–05), Ministry of Sound (2006–11) and New State Recordings (2011–present). Releases from the club have been acclaimed. One of its earlier releases, Paul Oakenfold&#x27;s &quot;Goa Mix&quot;, originally broadcast on radio, was described by Resident Advisor as &quot;groundbreaking in its cinematic two-hour scope&quot; and an &quot;&quot;Essential Mix&quot; frequently cited as the best and favorite by both listeners and DJs.&quot; &quot;Cream Live Two&quot; (1996) featured &quot;Q&quot;&#x27;s 1997 list of &quot;The 10 Best DJ Mix Albums...Ever!&quot;. &quot;Cream Beach 2002&quot; (2002) was noted by AllMusic as an example of how, &quot;as usual, Cream has gone out of its way to compile an album appropriately, and impressively, suited for such [communal] occasions.&quot; Paul Oakenfold&#x27;s &quot;Creamfields&quot; (2004) was subsequently nominated for &quot;Best Electronic/Dance Album&quot; at the 2005 Grammy Awards. Many of their albums have also been commercially successful, most evidently so with &quot;Cream Anthems 2001&quot; (2000), which reached number 1 in the UK Compilation Chart.

<doc id="501447" wikidata="Q2610844" url="?curid=501447" title="600-cell">
<text>In geometry, the 600-cell is the convex regular 4-polytope (four-dimensional analogue of a Platonic solid) with Schläfli symbol {3,3,5}.
It is also known as the C600, hexacosichoron and hexacosihedroid.
It is also called a tetraplex (abbreviated from &quot;tetrahedral complex&quot;) and a [[polytetrahedron]], being bounded by tetrahedral cells.

The 600-cell&#x27;s boundary is composed of 600 tetrahedral cells with 20 meeting at each vertex.
Together they form 1200 triangular faces, 720 edges, and 120 vertices.
It is the 4-dimensional analogue of the icosahedron, since it has five tetrahedra meeting at every edge, just as the icosahedron has five triangles meeting at every vertex.
Its dual polytope is the 120-cell.

== Geometry ==

The 600-cell is the fifth in the sequence of 6 convex regular 4-polytopes (in order of complexity and size at the same radius).
It can be deconstructed into twenty-five overlapping instances of its immediate predecessor the 24-cell, as the 24-cell can be deconstructed into three overlapping instances of its predecessor the tesseract (8-cell), and the 8-cell can be deconstructed into two instances of its predecessor the 16-cell.

The reverse procedure to construct each of these from an instance of its predecessor preserves the radius of the predecessor, but generally produces a successor with a smaller edge length.
The 24-cell&#x27;s edge length equals its radius, but the 600-cell&#x27;s edge length is ~0.618 times its radius, which is the golden ratio.

=== Coordinates ===

==== Unit radius Cartesian coordinates ====
The vertices of a 600-cell of unit radius centered at the origin of 4-space, with edges of length ≈ 0.618 (where φ = ≈ 1.618 is the golden ratio), can be given as follows:

8 vertices obtained from

:(0, 0, 0, ±1)

by permuting coordinates, and 16 vertices of the form:

The remaining 96 vertices are obtained by taking even permutations of

:(±, ±, ±, 0)

Note that the first 8 are the vertices of a 16-cell, the second 16 are the vertices of a tesseract, and those 24 vertices together are the vertices of a 24-cell.
The remaining 96 vertices are the vertices of a snub 24-cell, which can be found by partitioning each of the 96 edges of another 24-cell (dual to the first) in the golden ratio in a consistent manner.

When interpreted as quaternions, these are the unit icosians.

In the 24-cell, there are squares, hexagons and triangles that lie on great circles (in central planes through four or six vertices).
In the 600-cell there are twenty-five overlapping inscribed 24-cells, with each vertex and square shared by five 24-cells, and each hexagon or triangle shared by two 24-cells.
In each 24-cell there are three disjoint 16-cells, so in the 600-cell there are 75 overlapping inscribed 16-cells.
Each 16-cell constitutes a distinct orthonormal basis for the choice of a coordinate reference frame.

The 60 axes and 75 16-cells of the 600-cell constitute a geometric configuration, which in the language of configurations is written as 605754 to indicate that each axis belongs to 5 16-cells, and each 16-cell contains 4 axes.
Each axis is orthogonal to exactly 15 others, and these are just its companions in the 5 16-cells in which it occurs.

==== Hopf spherical coordinates ====
In the 600-cell there are also great circle pentagons and decagons (in central planes through ten vertices).

Only the decagon edges are visible elements of the 600-cell (because they are the edges of the 600-cell). The edges of the other great circle polygons are interior chords of the 600-cell, which are not shown in any of the 600-cell renderings in this article (except where shown as dashed lines).

By symmetry, an equal number of polygons of each kind pass through each vertex; so it is possible to account for all 120 vertices as the intersection of a set of central polygons of only one kind: decagons, hexagons, pentagons, squares, or triangles. For example, the 120 vertices can be seen as the vertices of 15 pairs of completely orthogonal squares which do not share any vertices, or as 100 &quot;dual pairs&quot; of non-orthogonal hexagons between which all axis pairs are orthogonal, or as 144 non-orthogonal pentagons six of which intersect at each vertex.
This latter pentagonal symmetry of the 600-cell is captured by the set of Hopf coordinates (𝜉&quot;i&quot;, 𝜂, 𝜉&quot;j&quot;) given as:

: ({&lt;10}, {≤5}, {&lt;10})

where {&lt;10} is the permutation of the ten digits (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9) and {≤5} is the permutation of the six digits (0 1 2 3 4 5).
The 𝜉&quot;i&quot; and 𝜉&quot;j&quot; coordinates range over the 10 vertices of great circle decagons; even and odd digits label the vertices of the two great circle pentagons inscribed in each decagon.

=== Structure ===

==== Polyhedral sections ====
The mutual distances of the vertices, measured in degrees of arc on the circumscribed hypersphere, only have the values 36° = , 60° = , 72° = , 90° = , 108° = , 120° = , 144° = , and 180° = 𝜋.
Departing from an arbitrary vertex V one has at 36° and 144° the 12 vertices of an icosahedron, at 60° and 120° the 20 vertices of a dodecahedron, at 72° and 108° the 12 vertices of a larger icosahedron, at 90° the 30 vertices of an icosidodecahedron, and finally at 180° the antipodal vertex of V.
These can be seen in the H3 Coxeter plane projections with overlapping vertices colored.

These polyhedral sections are &quot;solids&quot; in the sense that they are 3-dimensional, but of course all of their vertices lie on the surface of the 600-cell (they are hollow, not solid).
Each polyhedron lies in Euclidean 4-dimensional space as a parallel cross section through the 600-cell (a hyperplane).
In the curved 3-dimensional space of the 600-cell&#x27;s boundary surface envelope, the polyhedron surrounds the vertex V the way it surrounds its own center.
But its own center is in the interior of the 600-cell, not on its surface.
V is not actually at the center of the polyhedron, because it is displaced outward from that hyperplane in the fourth dimension, to the surface of the 600-cell.
Thus V is the apex of a 4-pyramid based on the polyhedron.

==== Golden chords ====
The 120 vertices are distributed at eight different chord lengths from each other.
These edges and chords of the 600-cell are simply the edges and chords of its five great circle polygons.
In ascending order of length, they are , , , , , , , and .

Notice that the four hypercubic chords of the 24-cell (, , , ) alternate with the four new chords of the 600-cell&#x27;s additional great circles, the decagons and pentagons.
The new &quot;golden chord&quot; lengths are necessarily square roots of fractions, but very special fractions related to the golden ratio including the two golden sections of , as shown in the diagram.

==== Boundary envelopes ====

The 600-cell &quot;rounds out&quot; the 24-cell by adding 96 more vertices between the 24-cell&#x27;s existing 24 vertices, in effect adding twenty-four more overlapping 24-cells inscribed in the 600-cell.
The new surface thus formed is a tessellation of smaller, more numerous cells and faces: tetrahedra of edge length ≈ 0.618 instead of octahedra of edge length 1.
It encloses the edges of the 24-cells, which become invisible interior chords in the 600-cell, like the and chords.
Since the tetrahedra are made of shorter triangle edges than the octahedra (by a factor of , the inverse golden ratio), the 600-cell does not have unit edge-length in a unit-radius coordinate system the way the 24-cell and the tesseract do; unlike those two, the 600-cell is not radially equilateral.
Like them it is radially triangular in a special way, but one in which golden triangles rather than equilateral triangles meet at the center.
Only a few uniform polytopes have this property, including the four-dimensional 600-cell, the three-dimensional icosidodecahedron, and the two-dimensional decagon.
(The icosidodecahedron is the equatorial cross section of the 600-cell, and the decagon is the equatorial cross section of the icosidodecahedron.)
Radially golden polytopes are those which can be constructed, with their radii, from golden triangles.

The boundary envelope of 600 small tetrahedral cells wraps around the twenty-five envelopes of 24 octahedral cells (adding some 4-dimensional space in places between these curved 3-dimensional envelopes).
The shape of those interstices must be an octahedral 4-pyramid of some kind, but in the 600-cell it is not regular.

==== Geodesics ====
The vertex chords of the 600-cell are arranged in geodesic great circle polygons of five kinds: decagons, hexagons, pentagons, squares, and triangles.
The = 𝚽 edges form 72 flat regular central decagons, 6 of which cross at each vertex.
Just as the icosidodecahedron can be partitioned into 6 central decagons (60 edges = 6 × 10), the 600-cell can be partitioned into 72 decagons (720 edges = 72 × 10).
The 720 edges divide the surface into 1200 triangular faces and 600 tetrahedral cells: a 600-cell. The 720 edges occur in 360 parallel pairs, apart.
As in the decagon and the icosidodecahedron, the edges occur in golden triangles which meet at the center of the polytope.
The 72 great decagons can be divided into 6 sets of 12 non-intersecting Clifford parallel geodesics, such that only one decagonal great circle in each set passes through each vertex, and the 12 decagons in each set reach all 120 vertices.

The chords form 200 central hexagons (25 sets of 16, with each hexagon in two sets), 10 of which cross at each vertex (4 from each of five 24-cells that meet at the vertex, with each hexagon in two of those 24-cells).
Each set of 16 hexagons consists of the 96 edges and 24 vertices of one of the 25 overlapping inscribed 24-cells.
The chords join vertices which are two edges apart.
Each chord is the long diameter of a face-bonded pair of tetrahedral cells (a triangular bipyramid), and passes through the center of the shared face.
As there are 1200 faces, there are 1200 chords, in 600 parallel pairs, apart.
The hexagonal planes are non-orthogonal (60 degrees apart) but they occur as 100 &quot;dual pairs&quot; in which all 3 axes of one hexagon are orthogonal to all 3 axes of its dual.
The 200 great hexagons can be divided into 10 sets of 20 non-intersecting Clifford parallel geodesics, such that only one hexagonal great circle in each set passes through each vertex, and the 20 hexagons in each set reach all 120 vertices.

The chords form 144 central pentagons, 6 of which cross at each vertex.
The chords run vertex-to-every-second-vertex in the same planes as the 72 decagons: two pentagons are inscribed in each decagon.
The chords join vertices which are two edges apart on a geodesic great circle.
The 720 chords occur in 360 parallel pairs, = φ apart.

The chords form 450 central squares, 15 of which cross at each vertex (3 from each of the five 24-cells that meet at the vertex).
The chords join vertices which are three edges apart (and two chords apart).
There are 600 chords, in 300 parallel pairs, apart.
The 450 great squares (225 completely orthogonal pairs) can be divided into 15 sets of 30 non-intersecting Clifford parallel geodesics, such that only one square great circle in each set passes through each vertex, and the 30 squares (15 completely orthogonal pairs) in each set reach all 120 vertices.

The = φ chords form the legs of 720 central isosceles triangles (72 sets of 10 inscribed in each decagon), 6 of which cross at each vertex.
The third edge (base) of each isosceles triangle is of length .
The chords run vertex-to-every-third-vertex in the same planes as the 72 decagons, joining vertices which are three edges apart on a geodesic great circle.
There are 720 distinct chords, in 360 parallel pairs, apart.

The chords form 400 equilateral central triangles (25 sets of 32, with each triangle in two sets), 10 of which cross at each vertex (4 from each of five 24-cells, with each triangle in two of the 24-cells).
Each set of 32 triangles consists of the 96 chords and 24 vertices of one of the 25 overlapping inscribed 24-cells.
The chords run vertex-to-every-second-vertex in the same planes as the 200 hexagons: two triangles are inscribed in each hexagon. The chords join vertices which are four edges apart (and two chords apart on a geodesic great circle).
Each chord is the long diameter of two cubic cells in the same 24-cell.
There are 1200 chords, in 600 parallel pairs, apart.

The chords (the diagonals of the pentagons) form the legs of 720 central isosceles triangles (144 sets of 5 inscribed in each pentagon), 6 of which cross at each vertex.
The third edge (base) of each isosceles triangle is an edge of the pentagon of length , so these are golden triangles. The chords run vertex-to-every-fourth-vertex in the same planes as the 72 decagons, joining vertices which are four edges apart on a geodesic great circle.
There are 720 distinct chords, in 360 parallel pairs, apart.

The chords occur as 60 long diameters (75 sets of 4 orthogonal axes with each set comprising a 16-cell), the 120 long radii of the 600-cell.
The chords join opposite vertices which are five edges apart on a geodesic great circle.
There are 25 distinct but overlapping sets of 12 diameters, each comprising one of the 25 inscribed 24-cells. There are 75 distinct but overlapping sets of 4 orthogonal diameters, each comprising one of the 75 inscribed 16-cells.

The sum of the squared lengths of all these distinct chords of the 600-cell is 14,400 = 1202.
These are all the central polygons through vertices, but the 600-cell does have one noteworthy great circle that does not pass through any vertices (a 0-gon).
Moreover, in 4-space there are geodesics on the 3-sphere which do not lie in central planes at all.
There are geodesic shortest paths between two 600-cell vertices that are helical rather than simply circular; they correspond to isoclinic (diagonal) rotations rather than simple rotations.

All the geodesic polygons enumerated above lie in central planes of just three kinds, each characterized by a rotation angle: decagon planes ( apart), hexagon planes ( apart, also in the 25 inscribed 24-cells), and square planes ( apart, also in the 75 inscribed 16-cells and the 24-cells).
These central planes of the 600-cell can be divided into 4 orthogonal central hyperplanes (3-spaces) each forming an icosidodecahedron.
There are 450 great squares 90 degrees apart; 200 great hexagons 60 degrees apart; and 72 great decagons 36 degrees apart.
Each great square plane is completely orthogonal to another great square plane.
Each great hexagon plane is completely orthogonal to a plane which intersects only two vertices (one long diameter): a great digon plane.
Each great decagon plane is completely orthogonal to a plane which intersects &quot;no&quot; vertices: a great 0-gon plane.

==== Fibrations of great circle polygons ====
Each set of similar great circle polygons (squares or hexagons or decagons) can be divided into bundles of non-intersecting Clifford parallel great circles (of 30 squares or 20 hexagons or 12 decagons).
Each fiber bundle of Clifford parallel great circles is a discrete Hopf fibration which fills the 600-cell, visiting all 120 vertices just once. Each discrete Hopf fibration has its 3-dimensional &quot;base&quot; which is a distinct polyhedron that acts as a &quot;map&quot; or scale model of the fibration.
The great circle polygons in each bundle spiral around each other, delineating helical rings of face-bonded cells which nest into each other, pass through each other without intersecting in any cells and exactly fill the 600-cell with their disjoint cell sets.
The different fiber bundles with their cell rings each fill the same space (the 600-cell) but their fibers run Clifford parallel in different &quot;directions&quot;; great circle polygons in different fibrations are not Clifford parallel.

===== Decagons =====

The fibrations of the 600-cell include 6 fibrations of its 72 great decagons: 6 fiber bundles of 12 great decagons. The 12 Clifford parallel decagons in each bundle are completely disjoint. Adjacent parallel decagons are spanned by edges of other great decagons.

Each fiber bundle delineates 20 helical rings of 30 tetrahedral cells each, with five rings nesting together around each decagon. The Hopf map of this fibration is the icosahedron, where each of 12 vertices lifts to a great decagon, and each of 20 triangular faces lifts to a 30-cell ring.
Each tetrahedral cell occupies only one of the 20 cell rings in each of the 6 fibrations.
The tetrahedral cell contributes each of its 6 edges to a decagon in a different fibration, but contributes that edge to five distinct cell rings in the fibration.

The 12 great circles and 30-cell rings of the 600-cell&#x27;s 6 characteristic Hopf fibrations make the 600-cell a geometric configuration of 30 &quot;points&quot; and 12 &quot;lines&quot; written as 302125.
It is called the Schläfli double six configuration after Ludwig Schläfli, the Swiss mathematician who discovered the 600-cell and the complete set of regular polytopes in &quot;n&quot; dimensions.

===== Hexagons =====
The fibrations of the 24-cell include 4 fibrations of its 16 great hexagons: 4 fiber bundles of 4 great hexagons. The 4 Clifford parallel hexagons in each bundle are completely disjoint. Adjacent parallel hexagons are spanned by edges of other great hexagons.
Each fiber bundle delineates 4 helical rings of 6 octahedral cells each, with three rings nesting together around each hexagon.
Each octahedral cell occupies only one cell ring in each of the 4 fibrations.
The octahedral cell contributes 3 of its 12 edges to 3 different Clifford parallel hexagons in each fibration, but contributes each edge to three distinct cell rings in the fibration.

The 600-cell contains 25 24-cells, and can be seen (10 different ways) as a compound of 5 disjoint 24-cells.
It has 10 fibrations of its 200 great hexagons: 10 fiber bundles of 20 great hexagons. The 20 Clifford parallel hexagons in each bundle are completely disjoint. Adjacent parallel hexagons are spanned by edges of great decagons. Each fiber bundle delineates 20 helical rings of 6 octahedral cells each, with three rings nesting together around each hexagon. 
The Hopf map of this fibration is the dodecahedron, where the 20 vertices each lift to a bundle of great hexagons.
Each octahedral cell occupies only one of the 20 6-octahedron rings in each of the 10 fibrations.
The 20 6-octahedron rings belong to 5 disjoint 24-cells of 4 6-octahedron rings each; each hexagonal fibration of the 600-cell consists of 5 disjoint 24-cells.

===== Squares =====
The fibrations of the 16-cell include 3 fibrations of its 6 great squares: 3 fiber bundles of 2 great squares. The 2 Clifford parallel squares in each bundle are completely disjoint. Adjacent parallel squares are spanned by edges of other great squares.
Each fiber bundle delineates 2 helical rings of 8 tetrahedral cells each.
Each tetrahedral cell occupies only one cell ring in each of the 3 fibrations.
The tetrahedral cell contributes each of its 6 edges to a different square (contributing two opposite non-intersecting edges to each of the 3 fibrations), but contributes each edge to both of the two distinct cell rings in the fibration.

The 600-cell contains 75 16-cells, and can be seen (10 different ways) as a compound of 15 disjoint 16-cells.
It has 15 fibrations of its 450 great squares: 15 fiber bundles of 30 great squares. The 30 Clifford parallel squares in each bundle are completely disjoint. Adjacent parallel squares are spanned by edges of great decagons. Each fiber bundle delineates 30 cell-disjoint helical rings of 8 tetrahedral cells each. 
The Hopf map of this fibration is the icosidodecahedron, where the 30 vertices each lift to a bundle of great squares.
Each tetrahedral cell occupies only one of the 30 8-tetrahedron rings in each of the 15 fibrations.

===== Clifford parallel cell rings =====
The densely packed helical cell rings of fibrations are cell-disjoint, but they share vertices, edges and faces.
Each fibration of the 600-cell can be seen as a dense packing of cell rings with the corresponding faces of adjacent cell rings face-bonded to each other.
The same fibration can also be seen as a minimal &quot;sparse&quot; arrangement of fewer &quot;completely disjoint&quot; cell rings that do not touch at all.

The fibrations of great decagons can be seen (five different ways) as 4 completely disjoint 30-cell rings with spaces separating them, rather than as 20 face-bonded cell rings, by leaving out all but one cell ring of the five that meet at each decagon.
The five different ways you can do this are equivalent, in that all five correspond to the same discrete fibration (in the same sense that the 6 decagonal fibrations are equivalent, in that all 6 cover the same 600-cell).
The 4 cell rings still constitute the complete fibration: they include all 12 Clifford parallel decagons, which visit all 120 vertices.
This subset of 4 of 20 cell rings is dimensionally analogous to the subset of 12 of 72 decagons, in that both are sets of completely disjoint Clifford parallel polytopes which visit all 120 vertices.
The subset of 4 of 20 cell rings is one of 5 fibrations &quot;within&quot; the fibration of 12 of 72 decagons: a fibration of a fibration.
All the fibrations have this two level structure with &quot;subfibrations&quot;.

The fibrations of the 24-cell&#x27;s great hexagons can be seen (three different ways) as 2 completely disjoint 6-cell rings with spaces separating them, rather than as 4 face-bonded cell rings, by leaving out all but one cell ring of the three that meet at each hexagon.
Therefore each of the 10 fibrations of the 600-cell&#x27;s great hexagons can be seen as 2 completely disjoint octahedral cell rings.

The fibrations of the 16-cell&#x27;s great squares can be seen (two different ways) as a single 8-tetrahedral-cell ring with an adjacent cell-ring-sized empty space, rather than as 2 face-bonded cell rings, by leaving out one of the two cell rings that meet at each square.
Therefore each of the 15 fibrations of the 600-cell&#x27;s great squares can be seen as a single tetrahedral cell ring.

The sparse constructions of the 600-cell&#x27;s fibrations correspond to lower-symmetry decompositions of the 600-cell, 24-cell or 16-cell with cells of different colors to distinguish the cell rings from the spaces between them.
The particular lower-symmetry form of the 600-cell corresponding to the sparse construction of the great decagon fibrations is dimensionally analogous to the snub tetrahedron form of the icosahedron (which is the &quot;base&quot; of these fibrations on the 2-sphere).
Each of the 20 Boerdijk-Coxeter cell rings is &quot;lifted&quot; from a corresponding &quot;face&quot; of the icosahedron.

=== Constructions ===
The 600-cell incorporates the geometries of every convex regular polytope in the first four dimensions, except the 5-cell, the 120-cell, and the polygons {7} and above.
Consequently, there are numerous ways to construct or deconstruct the 600-cell, but none of them are trivial.
The construction of the 600-cell from its regular predecessor the 24-cell can be difficult to visualize.

==== Gosset&#x27;s construction ====
Thorold Gosset discovered the semiregular 4-polytopes, including the snub 24-cell with 96 vertices, which falls between the 24-cell and the 600-cell in the sequence of convex 4-polytopes of increasing size and complexity in the same radius.
Gosset&#x27;s construction of the 600-cell from the 24-cell is in two steps, using the snub 24-cell as an intermediate form.
In the first, more complex step (described elsewhere) the snub 24-cell is constructed by a special snub truncation of a 24-cell at the golden sections of its edges.
In the second step the 600-cell is constructed in a straightforward manner by adding 4-pyramids (vertices) to facets of the snub 24-cell.

The snub 24-cell is a diminished 600-cell from which 24 vertices (and the cluster of 20 tetrahedral cells around each) have been truncated, leaving a &quot;flat&quot; icosahedral cell in place of each removed icosahedral pyramid.
The snub 24-cell thus has 24 icosahedral cells and the remaining 120 tetrahedral cells.
The second step of Gosset&#x27;s construction of the 600-cell is simply the reverse of this diminishing: an icosahedral pyramid of 20 tetrahedral cells is placed on each icosahedral cell.

Constructing the unit-radius 600-cell from its precursor the unit-radius 24-cell by Gosset&#x27;s method actually requires &quot;three&quot; steps.
The 24-cell precursor to the snub-24 cell is &quot;not&quot; of the same radius: it is larger, since the snub-24 cell is its truncation.
Starting with the unit-radius 24-cell, the first step is to reciprocate it around its midsphere to construct its outer canonical dual: a larger 24-cell, since the 24-cell is self-dual.
That larger 24-cell can then be snub truncated into a unit-radius snub 24-cell.

==== Cell clusters ====
Since it is so indirect, Gosset&#x27;s construction may not help us very much to directly visualize how the 600 tetrahedral cells fit together into a curved 3-dimensional surface envelope, or how they lie on the underlying surface envelope of the 24-cell&#x27;s octahedral cells.
For that it is helpful to build up the 600-cell directly from clusters of tetrahedral cells.

Most of us have difficulty visualizing the 600-cell &quot;from the outside&quot; in 4-space, or recognizing an outside view of the 600-cell due to our total lack of sensory experience in 4-dimensional spaces, but we should be able to visualize the surface envelope of 600 cells &quot;from the inside&quot; because that volume is a 3-dimensional space that we could actually &quot;walk around in&quot; and explore.
In these exercises of building the 600-cell up from cell clusters, we are entirely within a 3-dimensional space, albeit a strangely small, closed curved space, in which we can go a mere ten edge lengths away in a straight line in any direction and return to our starting point.

===== Icosahedra =====
The vertex figure of the 600-cell is the icosahedron.
Twenty tetrahedral cells meet at each vertex, forming an icosahedral pyramid whose apex is the vertex, surrounded by its base icosahedron.
The 600-cell has a dihedral angle of .

An entire 600-cell can be assembled from 24 such icosahedral pyramids (bonded face-to-face at 8 of the 20 faces of the icosahedron, colored yellow in the illustration), plus 24 clusters of 5 tetrahedral cells (four cells face-bonded around one) which fill the voids remaining between the icosahedra.
Each icosahedron is face-bonded to each adjacent cluster of 5 cells by two blue faces that share an edge (which is also one of the six edges of the central tetrahedron of the five).
Six clusters of 5 cells surround each icosahedron, and six icosahedra surround each cluster of 5 cells.
Five tetrahedral cells surround each icosahedron edge: two from inside the icosahedral pyramid, and three from outside it.

The apexes of the 24 icosahedral pyramids are the vertices of a 24-cell inscribed in the 600-cell.
The other 96 vertices (the vertices of the icosahedra) are the vertices of an inscribed snub 24-cell, which has exactly the same structure of icosahedra and tetrahedra described here, except that the icosahedra are not 4-pyramids filled by tetrahedral cells; they are only &quot;flat&quot; 3-dimensional icosahedral cells, because the central apical vertex is missing.

The 24-cell edges joining icosahedral pyramid apex vertices run through the centers of the yellow faces.
Coloring the icosahedra with 8 yellow and 12 blue faces can be done in 5 distinct ways.
Thus each icosahedral pyramid&#x27;s apex vertex is a vertex of 5 distinct 24-cells, and the 120 vertices comprise 25 (not 5) 24-cells.

The icosahedra are face-bonded into geodesic &quot;straight lines&quot; by their opposite yellow faces, bent in the fourth dimension into a ring of 6 icosahedral pyramids.
Their apexes are the vertices of a great circle hexagon.
This hexagonal geodesic traverses a ring of 12 tetrahedral cells, alternately bonded face-to-face and vertex-to-vertex. The long diameter of each face-bonded pair of tetrahedra (each triangular bipyramid) is a hexagon edge (a 24-cell edge).
There are 4 rings of 6 icosahedral pyramids intersecting at each apex-vertex, just as there are 4 cell-disjoint interlocking rings of 6 octahedra in the 24-cell (a hexagonal fibration).

The tetrahedral cells are face-bonded into triple helices, bent in the fourth dimension into rings of 30 tetrahedral cells.
The three helices are geodesic &quot;straight lines&quot; of 10 edges: great circle decagons which run Clifford parallel to each other.
Each tetrahedron, having six edges, participates in six different decagons and thereby in all 6 of the decagonal fibrations of the 600-cell.

The partitioning of the 600-cell into clusters of 20 cells and clusters of 5 cells is artificial, since all the cells are the same.
One can begin by picking out an icosahedral pyramid cluster centered at any arbitrarily chosen vertex, so there are 120 overlapping icosahedra in the 600-cell.
Their 120 apexes are each a vertex of five 24-vertex 24-cells, so there are 5*120/24 = 25 overlapping 24-cells.

===== Octahedra =====
There is another useful way to partition the 600-cell surface, into 24 clusters of 25 tetrahedral cells, which reveals more structure and a direct construction of the 600-cell from its predecessor the 24-cell.

Begin with any one of the clusters of 5 cells (above), and consider its central cell to be the center object of a new larger cluster of tetrahedral cells.
The central cell is the first section of the 600-cell beginning with a cell.
By surrounding it with more tetrahedral cells, we can reach the deeper sections beginning with a cell.

First, note that a cluster of 5 cells consists of 4 overlapping pairs of face-bonded tetrahedra (triangular dipyramids) whose long diameter is a 24-cell edge (a hexagon edge) of length .
Six more triangular dipyramids fit into the concavities on the surface of the cluster of 5, so the exterior chords connecting its 4 apical vertices are also 24-cell edges of length .
They form a tetrahedron of edge length , which is the second section of the 600-cell beginning with a cell.
There are 600 of these tetrahedral sections in the 600-cell.

With the six triangular dipyamids fit into the concavities, there are 12 new cells and 6 new vertices in addition to the 5 cells and 8 vertices of the original cluster.
The 6 new vertices form the third section of the 600-cell beginning with a cell, an octahedron of edge length , obviously the cell of a 24-cell.
As partially filled so far (by 17 tetrahedral cells), this octahedron has concave faces into which a short triangular pyramid fits; it has the same volume as a regular tetrahedral cell but an irregular tetrahedral shape.
Each octahedron surrounds 1 + 4 + 12 + 8 = 25 tetrahedral cells: 17 regular tetrahedral cells plus 8 volumetrically equivalent tetrahedral cells each consisting of 6 one-sixth fragments from 6 different regular tetrahedral cells that each span three adjacent octahedral cells.

Thus the unit-radius 600-cell may be constructed directly from its predecessor, the unit-radius 24-cell, by placing on each of its octahedral facets a truncated irregular octahedral pyramid of 14 vertices constructed (in the above manner) from 25 regular tetrahedral cells of edge length ≈ 0.618.

===== Union of two tori =====
There is yet another useful way to partition the 600-cell surface into clusters of tetrahedral cells, which reveals more structure and the decagonal fibrations of the 600-cell.
An entire 600-cell can be assembled around two rings of 5 icosahedral pyramids, bonded vertex-to-vertex into two geodesic &quot;straight lines&quot;.
The 120-cell can be decomposed into two disjoint tori.
Since it is the dual of the 600-cell, this same dual tori structure exists in the 600-cell, although it is somewhat more complex.
The 10-cell geodesic path in the 120-cell corresponds to the 10-vertex decagon path in the 600-cell.

Start by assembling five tetrahedra around a common edge.
This structure looks somewhat like an angular &quot;flying saucer&quot;.
Stack ten of these, vertex to vertex, &quot;pancake&quot; style.
Fill in the annular ring between each pair of &quot;flying saucers&quot; with 10 tetrahedra to form an icosahedron.
You can view this as five vertex-stacked icosahedral pyramids, with the five extra annular ring gaps also filled in.
The surface is the same as that of ten stacked pentagonal antiprisms: a triangular-faced column with a pentagonal cross-section.
Bent into a columnar ring this is a torus consisting of 150 cells, ten edges long, with 100 exposed triangular faces, 150 exposed edges, and 50 exposed vertices.
Stack another tetrahedron on each exposed face.
This will give you a somewhat bumpy torus of 250 cells with 50 raised vertices, 50 valley vertices, and 100 valley edges.
The valleys are 10 edge long closed paths and correspond to other instances of the 10-vertex decagon path mentioned above (great circle decagons).
These decagons spiral around the center core decagon, but mathematically they are all equivalent (they all lie in central planes).

Build a second identical torus of 250 cells that interlinks with the first.
This accounts for 500 cells.
These two tori mate together with the valley vertices touching the raised vertices, leaving 100 tetrahedral voids that are filled with the remaining 100 tetrahedra that mate at the valley edges.
This latter set of 100 tetrahedra are on the exact boundary of the duocylinder and form a Clifford torus.
They can be &quot;unrolled&quot; into a square 10×10 array.
Incidentally this structure forms one tetrahedral layer in the tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb.
There are exactly 50 &quot;egg crate&quot; recesses and peaks on both sides that mate with the 250 cell tori.
In this case into each recess, instead of an octahedron as in the honeycomb, fits a triangular bipyramid composed of two tetrahedra.

This decomposition of the 600-cell has symmetry [10,2+,10], order 400, the same symmetry as the grand antiprism.
The grand antiprism is just the 600-cell with the two above 150-cell tori removed, leaving only the single middle layer of 300 tetrahedra, dimensionally analogous to the 10-face belt of an icosahedron with the 5 top and 5 bottom faces removed (a pentagonal antiprism).

The two 150-cell tori each contain 6 Clifford parallel great decagons (five around one), and the two tori are Clifford parallel to each other, so together they constitute a complete fibration of 12 decagons that reaches all 120 vertices, despite filling only half the 600-cell with cells.

===== Boerdijk–Coxeter helix rings =====
The 600-cell can also be partitioned into 20 cell-disjoint intertwining rings of 30 cells, each ten edges long, forming a discrete Hopf fibration which fills the entire 600-cell.
Each ring of 30 face-bonded tetrahedra is a cylindrical Boerdijk–Coxeter helix bent into a ring in the fourth dimension.

The 30-cell ring is the 3-dimensional space occupied by the 30 vertices of three cyan Clifford parallel great decagons that lie adjacent to each other, 36° = = one 600-cell edge length apart at all their vertex pairs.
The 30 magenta edges joining these vertex pairs form a helical triacontagram, a skew 30-gram spiral of 30 edge-bonded triangular faces, that is the Petrie polygon of the 600-cell.
The dual of the 30-cell ring (the skew 30-gon made by connecting its cell centers) is the Petrie polygon of the 120-cell, the 600-cell&#x27;s dual polytope.
The central axis of the 30-cell ring is a great 30-gon geodesic that passes through the center of 30 faces, but does not intersect any vertices.

The 15 orange edges and 15 yellow edges form separate 15-gram helices.
Each orange or yellow edge crosses between two cyan great decagons.
Successive orange or yellow edges of these 15-gram helices do not lie on the same great circle; they lie in different central planes inclined at 36° = to each other.
Each 15-gram helix is noteworthy as the edge-path of an isocline, the geodesic path of an isoclinic rotation.
The isocline is a circular curve which intersects every &quot;second&quot; vertex of the 15-gram, missing the vertex in between.
A single isocline runs twice around each orange (or yellow) 15-gram through every other vertex, hitting half the vertices on the first loop and the other half of them on the second loop.
The two connected loops forms a single Möbius loop, a skew {15/2} pentadecagram.
The pentadecagram is not shown in these illustrations (but see below), because its edges are invisible chords between vertices which are two orange (or two yellow) edges apart, and no chords are shown in these illustrations.
Although the 30 vertices of the 30-cell ring do not lie in one great 30-gon central plane, these invisible pentadecagram isoclines are true geodesic circles of a special kind, that wind through all four dimensions rather than lying in a 2-dimensional plane as an ordinary geodesic great circle does.

Five of these 30-cell helices nest together and spiral around each of the 10-vertex decagon paths, forming the 150-cell torus described in the grand antiprism decomposition above.
Thus &quot;every&quot; great decagon is the center core decagon of a 150-cell torus. The 600-cell may be decomposed into 20 30-cell rings, or into two 150-cell tori and 10 30-cell rings, but not into four 150-cell tori of this kind. The 600-cell &quot;can&quot; be decomposed into four 150-cell tori of a different kind.

==== Radial golden triangles ====
The 600-cell can be constructed radially from 720 golden triangles of edge lengths which meet at the center of the 4-polytope, each contributing two radii and a edge.
They form 1200 triangular pyramids with their apexes at the center: irregular tetrahedra with equilateral bases (the faces of the 600-cell).
These form 600 tetrahedral pyramids with their apexes at the center: irregular 5-cells with regular tetrahedron bases (the cells of the 600-cell).

==== Characteristic orthoscheme ====

Every regular 4-polytope has its characteristic 4-orthoscheme, an irregular 5-cell.
The characteristic 5-cell of the regular 600-cell is represented by the Coxeter-Dynkin diagram , which can be read as a list of the dihedral angles between its mirror facets.
It is an irregular tetrahedral pyramid based on the characteristic tetrahedron of the regular tetrahedron.
The regular 600-cell is subdivided by its symmetry hyperplanes into 14400 instances of its characteristic 5-cell that all meet at its center.

The characteristic 5-cell (4-orthoscheme) has four more edges than its base characteristic tetrahedron (3-orthoscheme), joining the four vertices of the base to its apex (the fifth vertex of the 4-orthoscheme, at the center of the regular 600-cell). If the regular 600-cell has unit radius and edge length , its characteristic 5-cell&#x27;s ten edges have lengths , , around its exterior right-triangle face (the edges opposite the &quot;characteristic angles&quot; 𝟀, 𝝉, 𝟁), plus , , (the other three edges of the exterior 3-orthoscheme facet the characteristic tetrahedron, which are the &quot;characteristic radii&quot; of the regular tetrahedron), plus , , , (edges which are the characteristic radii of the 600-cell).
The 4-edge path along orthogonal edges of the orthoscheme is , , , , first from a 600-cell vertex to a 600-cell edge center, then turning 90° to a 600-cell face center, then turning 90° to a 600-cell tetrahedral cell center, then turning 90° to the 600-cell center.

==== Reflections ====
The 600-cell can be constructed by the reflections of its characteristic 5-cell in its own facets (its tetrahedral mirror walls).
Reflections and rotations are related: a reflection in an &quot;even&quot; number of &quot;intersecting&quot; mirrors is a rotation.
For example, a full isoclinic rotation of the 600-cell in decagonal invariant planes takes &quot;each&quot; of the 120 vertices through 15 vertices and back to itself, on a skew pentadecagram2 geodesic isocline of circumference 5𝝅 that winds around the 3-sphere, as each great decagon rotates (like a wheel) and also tilts sideways (like a coin flipping) with the completely orthogonal plane.
Any set of four orthogonal pairs of antipodal vertices (the 8 vertices of one of the 75 inscribed 16-cells) performing such an orbit visits 15 * 8 = 120 distinct vertices and generates the 600-cell sequentially in one full isoclinic rotation, just as any single characteristic 5-cell reflecting itself in its own mirror walls generates the 120 vertices simultaneously by reflection.

==== Weyl orbits ====
Another construction method uses quaternions and the Icosahedral symmetry of Weyl group orbits formula_1 of order 120. The following are the orbits of weights of D4 under the Weyl group W(D4):
: O(0100) : T = {±1,±e1,±e2,±e3,(±1±e1±e2±e3)/2}
: O(1000) : V1
: O(0010) : V2
: O(0001) : V3

With quaternions formula_2 where formula_3 is the conjugate of formula_4 and formula_5 and formula_6, then the Coxeter group formula_7 is the symmetry group of the 600-cell and the 120-cell of order 14400.

Given formula_8 such that formula_9 and formula_10 as an exchange of formula_11 within formula_4, we can construct:

* the snub 24-cell formula_13
* the 600-cell formula_14 
* the 120-cell formula_15

=== Rotations ===
The regular convex 4-polytopes are an expression of their underlying symmetry which is known as SO(4), the group of rotations about a fixed point in 4-dimensional Euclidean space.

The 600-cell is generated by isoclinic rotations of the 24-cell by 36° = (the arc of one 600-cell edge length).

==== Twenty-five 24-cells ====
There are 25 inscribed 24-cells in the 600-cell.
Therefore there are also 25 inscribed snub 24-cells, 75 inscribed tesseracts and 75 inscribed 16-cells.

The 8-vertex 16-cell has 4 long diameters inclined at 90° = to each other, often taken as the 4 orthogonal axes or basis of the coordinate system.

The 24-vertex 24-cell has 12 long diameters inclined at 60° = to each other: 3 disjoint sets of 4 orthogonal axes, each set comprising the diameters of one of 3 inscribed 16-cells, isoclinically rotated by with respect to each other.

The 120-vertex 600-cell has 60 long diameters: &quot;not just&quot; 5 disjoint sets of 12 diameters, each comprising one of 5 inscribed 24-cells (as we might suspect by analogy), but 25 distinct but overlapping sets of 12 diameters, each comprising one of 25 inscribed 24-cells.
There &quot;are&quot; 5 disjoint 24-cells in the 600-cell, but not &quot;just&quot; 5: there are 10 different ways to partition the 600-cell into 5 disjoint 24-cells.

Like the 16-cells and 8-cells inscribed in the 24-cell, the 25 24-cells inscribed in the 600-cell are mutually isoclinic polytopes.
The rotational distance between inscribed 24-cells is always in each invariant plane of rotation.

Five 24-cells are disjoint because they are Clifford parallel: their corresponding vertices are apart on two non-intersecting Clifford parallel decagonal great circles (as well as apart on the same decagonal great circle).
An isoclinic rotation of decagonal planes by takes each 24-cell to a disjoint 24-cell (just as an isoclinic rotation of hexagonal planes by takes each 16-cell to a disjoint 16-cell).
Each isoclinic rotation occurs in two chiral forms: there are 4 disjoint 24-cells to the &quot;left&quot; of each 24-cell, and another 4 disjoint 24-cells to its &quot;right&quot;.
The left and right rotations reach different 24-cells; therefore each 24-cell belongs to two different sets of five disjoint 24-cells.

All Clifford parallel polytopes are isoclinic, but not all isoclinic polytopes are Clifford parallels (completely disjoint objects).
Each 24-cell is isoclinic &quot;and&quot; Clifford parallel to 8 others, and isoclinic but &quot;not&quot; Clifford parallel to 16 others.
With each of the 16 it shares 6 vertices: a hexagonal central plane.
Non-disjoint 24-cells are related by a simple rotation by in an invariant plane intersecting only two vertices of the 600-cell, a rotation in which the completely orthogonal fixed plane is their common hexagonal central plane.
They are also related by an isoclinic rotation in which both planes rotate by .

There are two kinds of isoclinic rotations which take each 24-cell to another 24-cell.
&quot;Disjoint&quot; 24-cells are related by a isoclinic rotation of an entire fibration of 12 Clifford parallel &quot;decagonal&quot; invariant planes.
(There are 6 such sets of fibers, and a right or a left isoclinic rotation possible with each set, so there are 12 such distinct rotations.)
&quot;Non-disjoint&quot; 24-cells are related by a isoclinic rotation of an entire fibration of 20 Clifford parallel &quot;hexagonal&quot; invariant planes.
(There are 10 such sets of fibers, so there are 20 such distinct rotations.)

On the other hand, each of the 10 sets of five &quot;disjoint&quot; 24-cells is Clifford parallel because its corresponding great &quot;hexagons&quot; are Clifford parallel.
(24-cells do not have great decagons.)
The 16 great hexagons in each 24-cell can be divided into 4 sets of 4 non-intersecting Clifford parallel geodesics, each set of which covers all 24 vertices of the 24-cell.
The 200 great hexagons in the 600-cell can be divided into 10 sets of 20 non-intersecting Clifford parallel geodesics, each set of which covers all 120 vertices and constitutes a discrete hexagonal fibration.
Each of the 10 sets of 20 disjoint hexagons can be divided into five sets of 4 disjoint hexagons, each set of 4 covering a disjoint 24-cell.
Similarly, the corresponding great &quot;squares&quot; of disjoint 24-cells are Clifford parallel.

==== Rotations on polygram isoclines ====
The regular convex 4-polytopes each have their characteristic kind of right (and left) isoclinic rotation, corresponding to their characteristic kind of discrete Hopf fibration of great circles. For example, the 600-cell can be fibrated six different ways into a set of Clifford parallel great decagons, so the 600-cell has six distinct right (and left) isoclinic rotations in which those great decagon planes are invariant planes of rotation. We say these isoclinic rotations are &quot;characteristic&quot; of the 600-cell because the 600-cell&#x27;s edges lie in their invariant planes. These rotations only emerge in the 600-cell, although they are also found in larger regular polytopes (the 120-cell) which contain inscribed instances of the 600-cell.

Just as the geodesic &quot;polygons&quot; (decagons or hexagons or squares) in the 600-cell&#x27;s central planes form fiber bundles of Clifford parallel &quot;great circles&quot;, the corresponding geodesic skew &quot;polygrams&quot; (which trace the paths on the Clifford torus of vertices under isoclinic rotation) form fiber bundles of Clifford parallel &quot;isoclines&quot;: helical circles which wind through all four dimensions.
Since isoclinic rotations are chiral, occurring in left-handed and right-handed forms, each polygon fiber bundle has corresponding left and right polygram fiber bundles.
All the fiber bundles are aspects of the same discrete Hopf fibration, because the fibration is the various expressions of the same distinct left-right pair of isoclinic rotations.

Cell rings are another expression of the Hopf fibration.
Each discrete fibration has a set of cell-disjoint cell rings that tesselates the 4-polytope.
The isoclines in each chiral bundle spiral around each other: they are axial geodesics of the rings of face-bonded cells.
The Clifford parallel cell rings of the fibration nest into each other, pass through each other without intersecting in any cells, and exactly fill the 600-cell with their disjoint cell sets.

Isoclinic rotations rotate a rigid object&#x27;s vertices along parallel paths, each vertex circling within two orthogonal moving great circles, the way a loom weaves a piece of fabric from two orthogonal sets of parallel fibers.
A bundle of Clifford parallel great circle polygons and a corresponding bundle of Clifford parallel skew polygram isoclines are the warp and woof of the same distinct left or right isoclinic rotation, which takes Clifford parallel great circle polygons to each other, flipping them like coins and rotating them through a Clifford parallel set of central planes.
Meanwhile, because the polygons are also rotating individually like wheels, vertices are displaced along helical Clifford parallel isoclines (the chords of which form the skew polygram), through vertices which lie in successive Clifford parallel polygons.

In the 600-cell, each family of isoclinic skew polygrams (moving vertex paths in the decagon {10}, hexagon {6}, or square {4} great polygon rotations) can be divided into bundles of non-intersecting Clifford parallel polygram isoclines.
The isocline bundles occur in pairs of &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; chirality; the isoclines in each rotation act as chiral objects, as does each distinct isoclinic rotation itself.
Each fibration contains an equal number of left and right isoclines, in two disjoint bundles, which trace the paths of the 600-cell&#x27;s vertices during the fibration&#x27;s left or right isoclinic rotation respectively.
Each left or right fiber bundle of isoclines &quot;by itself&quot; constitutes a discrete Hopf fibration which fills the entire 600-cell, visiting all 120 vertices just once.
It is a &quot;different bundle of fibers&quot; than the bundle of Clifford parallel polygon great circles, but the two fiber bundles describe the &quot;same discrete fibration&quot; because they enumerate those 120 vertices together in the same distinct right (or left) isoclinic rotation, by their intersection as a fabric of cross-woven parallel fibers.

Each isoclinic rotation involves pairs of completely orthogonal invariant central planes of rotation, which both rotate through the same angle.
There are two ways they can do this: by both rotating in the &quot;same&quot; direction, or by rotating in &quot;opposite&quot; directions (according to the right hand rule by which we conventionally say which way is &quot;up&quot; on each of the 4 coordinate axes).
The right polygram and right isoclinic rotation conventionally correspond to invariant pairs rotating in the same direction; the left polygram and left isoclinic rotation correspond to pairs rotating in opposite directions.
Left and right isoclines are different paths that go to different places.
In addition, each distinct isoclinic rotation (left or right) can be performed in a positive or negative direction along the circular parallel fibers.

A fiber bundle of Clifford parallel isoclines is the set of helical vertex circles described by a distinct left or right isoclinic rotation.
Each moving vertex travels along an isocline contained within a (moving) cell ring.
While the left and right isoclinic rotations each double-rotate the same set of Clifford parallel invariant planes of rotation, they step through different sets of great circle polygons because left and right isoclinic rotations hit alternate vertices of the great circle {2p} polygon (where p is a prime ≤ 5).
The left and right rotation share the same Hopf bundle of {2p} polygon fibers, which is &quot;both&quot; a left and right bundle, but they have different bundles of {p} polygons because the discrete fibers are opposing left and right {p} polygons inscribed in the {2p} polygon.

A simple rotation is direct and local, taking some vertices to adjacent vertices along great circles, and some central planes to other central planes within the same hyperplane. (The 600-cell has four orthogonal central hyperplanes, each of which is an icosidodecahedron.)
In a simple rotation, there is just a single pair of completely orthogonal invariant central planes of rotation; it does not constitute a fibration.

An isoclinic rotation is diagonal and global, taking &quot;all&quot; the vertices to &quot;non-adjacent&quot; vertices (two or more edge-lengths away) along diagonal isoclines, and &quot;all&quot; the central plane polygons to Clifford parallel polygons (of the same kind).
A left-right pair of isoclinic rotations constitutes a discrete fibration.
All the Clifford parallel central planes of the fibration are invariant planes of rotation, separated by &quot;two&quot; equal angles and lying in different hyperplanes.
The diagonal isocline is a shorter route between the non-adjacent vertices than the multiple simple routes between them available along edges: it is the &quot;shortest route&quot; on the 3-sphere, the geodesic.

==== Decagons and pentadecagrams ====
The fibrations of the 600-cell include 6 fibrations of its 72 great decagons: 6 fiber bundles of 12 great decagons, each delineating 20 chiral cell rings of 30 tetrahedral cells each, with three great decagons bounding each cell ring, and five cell rings nesting together around each decagon. The 12 Clifford parallel decagons in each bundle are completely disjoint. Adjacent parallel decagons are spanned by edges of other great decagons. Each fibration corresponds to a distinct left (and right) isoclinic rotation of the 600-cell in 12 great decagon invariant planes on 5𝝅 isoclines.

The bundle of 12 Clifford parallel decagon fibers is divided into a bundle of 12 left pentagon fibers and a bundle of 12 right pentagon fibers, with each left-right pair of pentagons inscribed in a decagon.
12 great polygons comprise a fiber bundle covering all 120 vertices in a discrete Hopf fibration.
There are 20 cell-disjoint 30-cell rings in the fibration, but only 4 completely disjoint 30-cell rings.
The 600-cell has six such discrete decagonal fibrations, and each is the domain (container) of a unique left-right pair of isoclinic rotations (left and right fiber bundles of 12 great pentagons). Each great decagon belongs to just one fibration, but each 30-cell ring belongs to 5 of the six fibrations (and is completely disjoint from 1 other fibration).
The 600-cell contains 72 great decagons, divided among six fibrations, each of which is a set of 20 cell-disjoint 30-cell rings (4 completely disjoint 30-cell rings), but the 600-cell has only 20 distinct 30-cell rings altogether.
Each 30-cell ring contains 3 of the 12 Clifford parallel decagons in each of 5 fibrations, and 30 of the 120 vertices.

In these &quot;decagonal&quot; isoclinic rotations, vertices travel along isoclines which follow the edges of &quot;hexagons&quot;, advancing a pythagorean distance of one hexagon edge in each double 36°×36° rotational unit.
In an isoclinic rotation, each successive hexagon edge travelled lies in a different great hexagon, so the isocline describes a skew polygram, not a polygon.
In a 60°×60° isoclinic rotation (as in the 24-cell&#x27;s characteristic hexagonal rotation, and below in the &quot;hexagonal&quot; rotations of the 600-cell) this polygram is a hexagram: the isoclinic rotation follows a 6-edge circular path, just as a simple hexagonal rotation does, although it takes &quot;two&quot; revolutions to enumerate all the vertices in it, because the isocline is a double loop through every other vertex, and its chords are chords of the hexagon instead of hexagon edges. But in the 600-cell&#x27;s 36°×36° characteristic &quot;decagonal&quot; rotation, successive great hexagons are closer together and more numerous, and the isocline polygram formed by their 15 hexagon &quot;edges&quot; is a pentadecagram (15-gram). It is not only not the same period as the hexagon or the simple decagonal rotation, it is not even an integer multiple of the period of the hexagon, or the decagon, or either&#x27;s simple rotation. Only the compound {30/4}=2{15/2} triacontagram (30-gram), which is two 15-grams rotating in parallel (a black and a white), is a multiple of them all, and so constitutes the rotational unit of the decagonal isoclinic rotation.

In the 30-cell ring, the non-adjacent vertices linked by isoclinic rotations are two edge-lengths apart, with three other vertices of the ring lying between them.
The two non-adjacent vertices are linked by a chord of the isocline which is a great hexagon edge (a 24-cell edge).
The chords of the 30-cell ring (without the 600-cell edges) form a skew triacontagram{30/4}=2{15/2} which contains 2 disjoint {15/2} Möbius double loops, a left-right pair of pentadecagram2 isoclines.
Each left (or right) bundle of 12 pentagon fibers is crossed by a left (or right) bundle of 8 Clifford parallel pentadecagram fibers.
Each distinct 30-cell ring has 2 double-loop pentadecagram isoclines running through its even or odd (black or white) vertices respectively. The pentadecagram helices have no inherent chirality, but each acts as either a left or right isocline in any distinct isoclinic rotation.
The 2 pentadecagram fibers belong to the left and right fiber bundles of 5 different fibrations.

At each vertex, there are six great decagons and six pentadecagram isoclines (six black or six white) that cross at the vertex.
Eight pentadecagram isoclines (four black and four white) comprise a unique right (or left) fiber bundle of isoclines covering all 120 vertices in the distinct right (or left) isoclinic rotation.
Each fibration has a unique left and right isoclinic rotation, and corresponding unique left and right fiber bundles of 12 pentagons and 8 pentadecagram isoclines.
There are only 20 distinct black isoclines and 20 distinct white isoclines in the 600-cell.
Each distinct isocline belongs to 5 fiber bundles.

Two 15-gram double-loop isoclines are axial to each 30-cell ring. The 30-cell rings are chiral; each fibration contains 10 right (clockwise-spiraling) rings and 10 left (counterclockwise spiraling) rings, but the two isoclines in each 3-cell ring are directly congruent. Each acts as a left (or right) isocline a left (or right) rotation, but has no inherent chirality.
The fibration&#x27;s 20 left and 20 right 15-grams altogether contain 120 disjoint open pentagrams (60 left and 60 right), the open ends of which are adjacent 600-cell vertices (one edge-length apart).
The 30 chords joining the isocline&#x27;s 30 vertices are hexagon edges (24-cell edges), connecting 600-cell vertices which are &quot;two&quot; 600-cell edges apart on a decagon great circle.

These isocline chords are both hexa&quot;gon&quot; edges and penta&quot;gram&quot; edges.

The 20 Clifford parallel isoclines (30-cell ring axes) of each left (or right) isocline bundle do not intersect each other.
Either distinct decagonal isoclinic rotation (left or right) rotates all 120 vertices (and all 600 cells), but pentadecagram isoclines and pentagons are connected such that vertices alternate as 60 black and 60 white vertices (and 300 black and 300 white cells), like the black and white squares of the chessboard.
In the course of the rotation, the vertices on a left (or right) isocline rotate within the same 15-vertex black (or white) isocline, and the cells rotate within the same black (or white) 30-cell ring.

==== Hexagons and hexagrams ====
The fibrations of the 600-cell include 10 fibrations of its 200 great hexagons: 10 fiber bundles of 20 great hexagons. The 20 Clifford parallel hexagons in each bundle are completely disjoint. Adjacent parallel hexagons are spanned by edges of great decagons. Each fibration corresponds to a distinct left (and right) isoclinic rotation of the 600-cell in 20 great hexagon invariant planes on 4𝝅 isoclines.

Each fiber bundle delineates 20 disjoint directly congruent cell rings of 6 octahedral cells each, with three cell rings nesting together around each hexagon.
The bundle of 20 Clifford parallel hexagon fibers is divided into a bundle of 20 black great triangle fibers and a bundle of 20 white great triangle fibers, with a black and a white triangle inscribed in each hexagon and 6 black and 6 white triangles in each 6-octahedron ring.
The black or white triangles are joined by three intersecting black or white isoclines, each of which is a special kind of helical great circle through the corresponding vertices in 10 Clifford parallel black (or white) great triangles. The 10 chords of each isocline form a skew decagram {10/3}, 10 great pentagon edges joined end-to-end in a helical loop, winding 3 times around the 600-cell through all four dimensions rather than lying flat in a central plane. Each pair of black and white isoclines (intersecting antipodal great hexagon vertices) forms a compound 20-gon icosagram {20/6}2{10/3}.

Notice the relation between the 24-cell&#x27;s characteristic rotation in great hexagon invariant planes (on hexagram isoclines), and the 600-cell&#x27;s own version of the rotation of great hexagon planes (on decagram isoclines). They are exactly the same isoclinic rotation: they have the same isocline. They have different numbers of the same isocline, and the 600-cell&#x27;s isocline chord is shorter than the 24-cell&#x27;s isocline chord because the isocline intersects more vertices in the 600-cell (10) than it does in the 24-cell (6), but both Clifford polygrams have a 4𝝅 circumference. They have different isocline polygrams only because the isocline curve intersects more vertices in the 600-cell than it does in the 24-cell.

==== Squares and octagrams ====
The fibrations of the 600-cell include 15 fibrations of its 450 great squares: 15 fiber bundles of 30 great squares. The 30 Clifford parallel squares in each bundle are completely disjoint. Adjacent parallel squares are spanned by edges of great decagons. Each fibration corresponds to a distinct left (and right) isoclinic rotation of the 600-cell in 30 great square invariant planes (15 completely orthogonal pairs) on 4𝝅 isoclines.

Each fiber bundle delineates 30 chiral cell rings of 8 tetrahedral cells each, with a left and right cell ring nesting together to fill each of the 15 disjoint 16-cells inscribed in the 600-cell. Axial to each 8-tetrahedron ring is a special kind of helical great circle, an isocline. In a left (or right) isoclinic rotation of the 600-cell in great square invariant planes, all the vertices circulate on one of 15 Clifford parallel isoclines.

The 30 Clifford parallel squares in each bundle are joined by four Clifford parallel 24-gram isoclines (one through each vertex), each of which intersects one vertex in 24 of the 30 squares, and all 24 vertices of just one of the 600-cell&#x27;s 25 24-cells. Each isocline is a 24-gram circuit intersecting all 25 24-cells, 24 of them just once and one of them 24 times. The 24 vertices in each 24-gram isocline comprise a unique 24-cell; there are 25 such distinct isoclines in the 600-cell. Each isocline is a skew {24/5} 24-gram, 24 φ chords joined end-to-end in a helical loop, winding 5 times around one 24-cell through all four dimensions rather than lying flat in a central plane. Adjacent vertices of the 24-cell are one chord apart, and 5 φ chords apart on its isocline. A left (or right) isoclinic rotation through 720° takes each 24-cell to and through every other 24-cell.

Notice the relations between the 16-cell&#x27;s rotation of just 2 invariant great square planes, the 24-cell&#x27;s rotation in 6 Clifford parallel great squares, and this rotation of the 600-cell in 30 Clifford parallel great squares. These three rotations are the same rotation, taking place on exactly the same kind of isocline circles, which happen to intersect more vertices in the 600-cell (24) than they do in the 16-cell (8). In the 16-cell&#x27;s rotation the distance between vertices on an isocline curve is the diameter. In the 600-cell vertices are closer together, and its φ chord is the distance between adjacent vertices on the same isocline, but all these isoclines have a 4𝝅 circumference.

=== As a configuration ===
This configuration matrix represents the 600-cell. The rows and columns correspond to vertices, edges, faces, and cells. The diagonal numbers say how many of each element occur in the whole 600-cell. The non-diagonal numbers say how many of the column&#x27;s element occur in or at the row&#x27;s element.

formula_16

Here is the configuration expanded with &quot;k&quot;-face elements and &quot;k&quot;-figures. The diagonal element counts are the ratio of the full Coxeter group order, 14400, divided by the order of the subgroup with mirror removal.
== Symmetries ==
The icosians are a specific set of Hamiltonian quaternions with the same symmetry as the 600-cell.
The icosians lie in the &quot;golden field&quot;, (&quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot;) + (&quot;c&quot; + &quot;d&quot;)i + (&quot;e&quot; + &quot;f&quot;)j + (&quot;g&quot; + &quot;h&quot;)k, where the eight variables are rational numbers.
The finite sums of the 120 unit icosians are called the icosian ring.

When interpreted as quaternions, the 120 vertices of the 600-cell form a group under quaternionic multiplication.
This group is often called the binary icosahedral group and denoted by &quot;2I&quot; as it is the double cover of the ordinary icosahedral group &quot;I&quot;.
It occurs twice in the rotational symmetry group &quot;RSG&quot; of the 600-cell as an invariant subgroup, namely as the subgroup &quot;2IL&quot; of quaternion left-multiplications and as the subgroup &quot;2IR&quot; of quaternion right-multiplications.
Each rotational symmetry of the 600-cell is generated by specific elements of &quot;2IL&quot; and &quot;2IR&quot;; the pair of opposite elements generate the same element of &quot;RSG&quot;.
The centre of &quot;RSG&quot; consists of the non-rotation &quot;Id&quot; and the central inversion &quot;−Id&quot;.
We have the isomorphism &quot;RSG ≅ (2IL × 2IR) / {Id, -Id}&quot;.
The order of &quot;RSG&quot; equals = 7200.
The quaternion algebra as a tool for the treatment of 3D and 4D rotations, and as a road to the full understanding of the theory of rotations in 4-dimensional Euclidean space, is described by Mebius.

The binary icosahedral group is isomorphic to SL(2,5).

The full symmetry group of the 600-cell is the Coxeter group H4.
This is a group of order 14400.
It consists of 7200 rotations and 7200 rotation-reflections.
The rotations form an invariant subgroup of the full symmetry group.
The rotational symmetry group was first described by S.L. van Oss.
The H4 group and its Clifford algebra construction from 3-dimensional symmetry groups by induction is described by Dechant.

== Visualization ==
The symmetries of the 3-D surface of the 600-cell are somewhat difficult to visualize due to both the large number of tetrahedral cells, and the fact that the tetrahedron has no opposing faces or vertices. One can start by realizing the 600-cell is the dual of the 120-cell. One may also notice that the 600-cell also contains the vertices of a dodecahedron, which with some effort can be seen in most of the below perspective projections.

=== 2D projections ===
The H3 decagonal projection shows the plane of the van Oss polygon.

=== 3D projections ===
A three-dimensional model of the 600-cell, in the collection of the Institut Henri Poincaré, was photographed in 1934–1935 by Man Ray, and formed part of two of his later &quot;Shakesperean Equation&quot; paintings.

== Diminished 600-cells ==
The snub 24-cell may be obtained from the 600-cell by removing the vertices of an inscribed 24-cell and taking the convex hull of the remaining vertices. This process is a &quot;diminishing&quot; of the 600-cell.

The grand antiprism may be obtained by another diminishing of the 600-cell: removing 20 vertices that lie on two mutually orthogonal rings and taking the convex hull of the remaining vertices.

A bi-24-diminished 600-cell, with all tridiminished icosahedron cells has 48 vertices removed, leaving 72 of 120 vertices of the 600-cell. The dual of a bi-24-diminished 600-cell, is a tri-24-diminished 600-cell, with 48 vertices and 72 hexahedron cells.

There are a total of 314,248,344 diminishings of the 600-cell by non-adjacent vertices. All of these consist of regular tetrahedral and icosahedral cells.
== Related polytopes and honeycombs ==
The 600-cell is one of 15 regular and uniform polytopes with the same H4 symmetry [3,3,5]:
It is similar to three regular 4-polytopes: the 5-cell {3,3,3}, 16-cell {3,3,4} of Euclidean 4-space, and the order-6 tetrahedral honeycomb {3,3,6} of hyperbolic space. All of these have tetrahedral cells.
This 4-polytope is a part of a sequence of 4-polytope and honeycombs with icosahedron vertex figures:
The regular complex polygons 3{5}3, and 5{3}5, , in formula_17 have a real representation as &quot;600-cell&quot; in 4-dimensional space. Both have 120 vertices, and 120 edges. The first has Complex reflection group 3[5]3, order 360, and the second has symmetry 5[3]5, order 600.

<text>The Malabar trogon (Harpactes fasciatus) is a species of bird in the trogon family. It is found in the forests of India and Sri Lanka. In India it is mainly found in the Western Ghats, hill forests of central India and in parts of the Eastern Ghats. They are insectivorous and although not migratory, may move seasonally in response to rain in hill forest regions. Like in other trogons, males and females vary in plumage. The birds utter low guttural calls that can be heard only at close quarters and the birds perch still on a branch under the forest canopy, often facing away from the viewer making them easy to miss despite their colourful plumage.

==Description==

Like most other trogons, these birds are brightly coloured and sexually dimorphic. The male has a slaty black head and breast with a white border to the black bib separating it from the crimson on the underside. The back is olive-brown to chestnut. The wing coverts are black with fine white vermiculations. They have 12 tail feathers that are graduated. The central tail-feathers are chestnut with a black tip, with the second and third pairs from the middle having more black than chestnut. The outer three pairs have long white tips. The female lacks the contrasting black and crimson and has only a slightly darker head and breast that shades into the olive brown on the back while the crimson of the underside of the male is replaced by ochre. In both sexes, the beak is bluish as is the skin around the eye. The iris is dark brown and the feet are pale bluish. The nostrils are covered by tufts of filoplumes. The feet are heterodactyl, a feature unique to the trogons, with the digits I and II facing back and digits III and IV pointing forward. In most birds I, II and III face forward while IV faces back and in zygodactyly II and III face forward while I and IV face backwards.

Several populations have been named. The central Indian subspecies &quot;legerli&quot;, named by Walter Norman Koelz on the basis of a single specimen obtained from the foot of Mahendra Giri in Orissa is not always recognized, but said to be slightly larger, longer winged and brighter than &quot;malabaricus&quot; of the Western Ghats. The nominate race found in the central wet zone of Sri Lanka is smaller and the upperparts are brighter.

==Behaviour and ecology==
These birds usually perch still, especially when alarmed and will sometimes clinging laterally to branches. When calling they sometimes raise and lower their tail. The call is a series of guttural or purring notes. The song of the male is a series of percussive calls. The breeding season in India is mainly February to May (before the Monsoons) while it is March to June in Sri Lanka. 

When they sit still, the appear hunched. The Hindi name used by hunters is and refers to the hunched neckless appearance as if dressed in a fakir&#x27;s (robe). The Marathi name is while it is called in Kannada. In Kerala it is known as (literally &quot;fire-crow&quot;). In Sri Lanka, it is known as &quot;loha wannichcha&quot;.
Malabar trogons feed exclusively on insects and fruits have not been noted in their diet unlike in the New World trogons. Seeds have however been reported in the diet of Sri Lankan specimens. In the forests of Sri Lanka, they are often found in mixed-species foraging flocks where they may sometimes be subject to kleptoparasitism by drongos. A study in Kerala found that they foraged mainly at 5 to 10 m with females tending to forage lower within the canopy. When foraging on bark, they propped themselves using their tail like woodpeckers, especially on decaying tree stumps. They sometimes descend to the ground and search for insects under leaf litter. They will sometimes fly and try to flush prey and then hover to pick up prey. They may also hang upside down to reach prey on vertical tree surfaces. Prey are often mashed or struck on a branch between the mandibles before feeding on them or prior to feeding young. The contact call is a series of about five low intensity while these were of higher intensity in territorial fights. The alarm call is a and a similar call is also delivered prior to roosting. Although their flight is fast, they are reluctant to fly. In the Nilgiri hills they are altitudinal migrants and are found in the higher reaches only during summer. The nest is made in rotting trees or stumps that are easy to carve and pulverize using their bills. The male and female take turns to excavate the nest using their bills. It may take about a month to excavate the nest. The floor is made out of the wood powder and no extra lining is added. Two eggs were seen to be the normal clutch in a study in Kerala although older works suggest that the typical clutch is of three eggs. The eggs are laid with a gap of two days and incubated by both males and females with the females usually incubating at night. The incubation period is about 19 days. The hatchlings are fed mainly caterpillars for the initial period and later provided bugs, flies and orthopterans. The parents do not remove the excreta of the nestlings from the nest. The adults continue to feed the fledged juveniles for nearly 5 to 6 months. They are socially monogamous with pair bonds lasting more than a season.

Sri Lankan birds have been seen to plunge into water from an overhanging branch to bathe.

A species of endoparasitic cestode, &quot;Triaenorhina burti&quot; has been described from the species.

==Status==
The species is becoming rarer in many parts of India and it is thought to be sensitive to forest fragmentation. Salim Ali noted it as being common in some areas of the Surat Dangs where it is now rare. One of his records is from Ajwa in Vadodara district which is believed to be a typographical error for Ahwa further south. Tickell collected specimens from Dampara in Dholbhum.
