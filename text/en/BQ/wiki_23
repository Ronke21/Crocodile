<text>Hurtigruten (), formally Kystruten Bergen-Kirkenes (&quot;coastal route Bergen-Kirkenes&quot;), is a Norwegian public coastal route transporting passengers that travel locally, regionally, and between the ports of call, and also cargo between ports north of Tromsø.

Hurtigruten provides daily, year-round, and consistent traffic between Bergen and Kirkenes with 34 ports of call on northbound and 33 ports of call on southbound sailings. The Ministry of Transport and Communications in Norway has set minimum capacity requirements of 320 passengers, 120 berths, and cargo for 150 Euro-pallets. The current agreement with the privately held company Hurtigruten AS entered into force on 1 January 2012 and expired on 31 December 2019, with an optional 1-year extension. Since 2021, Havila Kystruten AS has operated alongside Hurtigruten AS on the coastal route.

As of April 2022, one of the ships of Havila Kystruten, MS Havila Capella, was taken out of service; because of sanctions as a result of the 2022 Invasion of Ukraine, the ship no longer had insurance; &quot;the 4 ships of&quot; the company were at that time financed by a Russian company.

== History ==
Hurtigruten was established in 1893 by government contract to improve communications along Norway&#x27;s long, jagged coastline. began the first round-trip journey from Trondheim on 2 July 1893 bound for Hammerfest, with calls at Rørvik, Brønnøysund, Sandnessjøen, Bodø, Svolvær, Lødingen, Harstad, Tromsø, and Skjervøy. The ship arrived at Svolvær on Monday 3 July at 8 pm after 35½ hours and at Hammerfest on Wednesday 5 July after 67 hours. She was commanded by the founder of the route Richard With. At that time this was the fastest route between northern and southern Norway, and this resulted in the route being named Hurtigruten (express route). As of 2008, the Trondheim–Svolvær trip took 33 hours and the Trondheim–Hammerfest trip took 41 hours 15 min.

Before Hurtigruten opened, only Vesteraalens Dampskibsselskab was willing to make the trip through the then poorly-charted waters; the voyage was especially difficult during the long, dark winters. The company had for itself made detailed sailing instructions. Hurtigruten was a substantial breakthrough for communities along its path. Mail from central Norway to Hammerfest, which used to take three weeks in summer and five months in winter, could now be delivered in seven days.

Encouraged by Vesteraalens&#x27; early success, several other shipping companies obtained a concession to operate the route, extended to run between Bergen in the southwest and Kirkenes in the far northeast. A fleet of 11 ships visits each of the 34 ports daily, both northbound and southbound.

Until the 1940s, most ports north of Trondheim could not be reached by road from Oslo, so the sea was the only means of access. Beginning in the 1960s, the role of Hurtigruten changed, in part because of the construction of a local airport network and road improvements. Operating subsidies were gradually phased out, and the operators put more emphasis on tourism. New, bigger, and more luxurious ships were introduced in the 1980s, with attention given to hot tubs, bars, restaurants, and other comforts. However, Hurtigruten still serves important passenger and cargo needs, and operates 365 days a year. The last two independent shipping companies, Ofotens og Vesteraalens Dampskibsselskab (OVDS) and Troms Fylkes Dampskibsselskap (TFDS), merged on 1 March 2006 as the Hurtigruten Group, a year later becoming Hurtigruten ASA. In 2015, Hurtigruten was delisted from the Oslo stock exchange after the company was acquired by the private equity group TDR Capital.


==New contracts==
The Ministry of Transport and Communications in Norway announced in 2017 that the Hurtigruten contract was split into three contracts. The contracts were put up for bid and in the end, two were granted to Hurtigruten AS and one to Havila Kystruten AS, with each operating seven and four ships respectively. The two companies alternate departure days for the entire route from Bergen to Kirkenes.

The four new vessels from Havila will run on LNG and battery power. LNG will cut CO₂ emissions by 25%, and the battery power will yield additional savings. The vessels will be named Havila Capella, Havila Castor, Havila Polaris, and Havila Pollux. All four vessels were built at Tersan shipyard in Turkey.

Existing vessels from Hurtigruten will be modernized and renovated to meet the new requirements. MS Eirik Raude, MS Trollfjord and MS Otto Sverdrup are all getting modernized and renovated with a scandinavian interior style.

The ships will be fitted with filters and LNG-compatible engines to reduce emissions by 25%. The ships will also get hybrid motors, and battery packs.

==Places visited on coastal route==
In order, northbound:
==Live television broadcast==
As part of its slow television series, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation transmitted non-stop the Hurtigruten ship &#x27;s 134-hour voyage from Bergen to Kirkenes, which started on June 16, 2011.

==Post-World War II accidents and incidents==
Before World War II, a number of ships perished, usually because they ran aground in bad visibility.

Most of the Hurtigruten fleet was sunk during World War II.

In September 1954 ran aground in Raftsundet at night. The ship started taking on water and eventually sank. Of the 157 passengers and 46 crew members on board, five died.

On 8 January 1958, a fire broke out on board MS &quot;Erling Jarl&quot; while the vessel was docked at Bodø. Fourteen people died of smoke inhalation. Today a memorial to the incident stands at Bodø.

On 21 October 1962 MS &quot;Sanct Svithun&quot; ran onto a reef in the maritime area Folda in Nord-Trøndelag because of a major navigational error after leaving Trondheim. Of 89 persons on board (passengers, crew and two postal officers) 41 died.

In 2011 suffered an engine room fire, leading to two deaths among the crew.

<text>The longspurs, genus Calcarius, are a group of birds in the family Calcariidae. The name refers to the long claw on the hind toe of each foot. The genus formerly included the thick-billed longspur, &quot;Rhyncophanes mccownii&quot;, which is now placed in a separate genus.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Calcarius&quot; was introduced in 1802 by the German naturalist Johann Matthäus Bechstein to accommodate a single species, &quot;Fringilla lapponica&quot; Linnaeus 1758, which therefore becomes the type species by monotypy. The genus name is from Latin &quot;calcaria&quot; meaning &quot;spurs&quot;.

These are chunky ground-feeding birds with long wings which are usually seen in open areas. Males declare ownership of a territory by singing during short flights over it. The male&#x27;s breeding plumage is much brighter than his winter plumage. These birds gather in large flocks in winter. The longspurs are all found in North America; the Lapland longspur, or Lapland bunting, is also found in Europe and Asia.

==Species==
The genus contains three species:

<text>Johann Jacob Löwenthal (; 15 July 1810 – 24 July 1876) was a professional chess master. He was among the top 3 players of the 1850s.

== Biography ==

Löwenthal was born in Budapest, the son of a Jewish merchant. He was educated at the gymnasium of his native city. In 1846, he won a match against Carl Hamppe in Vienna (with 5 wins, 4 losses, and no draws). He received a civil appointment under the administration of Lajos Kossuth in 1848. On the downfall of the latter, Löwenthal was expelled from Hungary, and he emigrated to America in 1849. In 1851, he went to London and resided permanently in England thereafter. At the Manchester tournament of 1857, Löwenthal defeated Adolf Anderssen for first place.
During his 1850 visit to New Orleans, Löwenthal played Paul Morphy on two separate occasions, losing a total of three games straight. He was one of the first masters to play a match against Morphy after the latter&#x27;s arrival in London in 1858. Morphy won with a score of nine wins, three losses, and two draws. &quot;...I am convinced that I was vanquished by superior strength,&quot; Löwenthal said about the match, as reported by an English writer named Frederick Edge, who wrote extensively about Morphy and other famous players in a book called &quot;The Exploits and Triumphs, in Europe, of Paul Morphy, the Chess Champion&quot;. No doubt aware that chess was Löwenthal&#x27;s only source of livelihood, and conscious to not be considered a professional player himself, Morphy, after winning the match stakes of £100, presented Löwenthal with a gift of furniture valued at £120 for his new house.

Just days after being defeated by Morphy, Löwenthal had his greatest success by winning the British Chess Association Congress knockout tournament in Birmingham, England, on 27 August 1858. His prize was £63.

In 1860, Löwenthal took advantage of Morphy&#x27;s extreme popularity to create a collection of the American master&#x27;s games titled &quot;Morphy&#x27;s Games of Chess&quot;. According to Morphy&#x27;s biographer David Lawson, Morphy was friendly to Löwenthal and therefore agreed to sign his name to material in the book, which was purported to be written by Morphy but in fact was not.

For a time, Löwenthal served as club secretary of the St. George&#x27;s Chess Club in London. He taught chess and invented the first . He helped organise an international tournament in 1862, and then published a .

Löwenthal was for some time chess editor of &quot;The Illustrated News of the World&quot; and of &quot;The Era&quot;. He was editor also of &quot;The Chess Players&#x27; Magazine&quot; (1863–1867). In 1860, he published Morphy&#x27;s &quot;Games of Chess, with Analytical and Critical Notes&quot;.

When Löwenthal became ill in 1874 and could no longer financially support himself, a collection was taken up for him. Lord Randolph Churchill and many others contributed to the charity fund. Under the influence of W. G. Ward, with whom he played chess, Löwenthal became a Roman Catholic. He died on 24 July 1876 at St. Leonards-on-Sea, near Hastings, at the age of 66.

<doc id="491312" wikidata="Q1200976" url="?curid=491312" title="Regnal name">
<text>A regnal name, regnant name, or reign name is the name used by monarchs and popes during their reigns and subsequently, historically. Since ancient times, some monarchs have chosen to use a different name from their original name when they accede to the monarchy. 
The regnal name is usually followed by a regnal number, written as a Roman numeral, to differentiate that monarch from others who have used the same name while ruling the same realm. In some cases, the monarch has more than one regnal name, but the regnal number is based on only one of those names, for example Charles X Gustav of Sweden. If a monarch reigns in more than one realm, they may carry different ordinals in each one, as some realms may have had different numbers of rulers of the same regnal name. For example, the same person was both King James VI of Scotland and King James I of England.

The ordinal is not normally used for the first ruler of the name, but is used in historical references once the name is used again. Thus, Queen Elizabeth I of England was called simply &quot;Elizabeth of England&quot; until the accession of Queen Elizabeth II almost four centuries later in 1952; subsequent historical references to the earlier queen retroactively refer to her as Elizabeth I. However, Tsar Paul I of Russia, King Umberto I of Italy, King Juan Carlos I of Spain, Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia and Pope John Paul I all used the ordinal I (first) during their reigns. In spoken English, such names are pronounced as &quot;Elizabeth the First&quot;, &quot;George the Sixth&quot;, etc.

In some countries in Asia, monarchs took or take era names. While era names as such are not used in many monarchies, sometimes eras are named after a monarch (usually long-lived), or a succession of monarchs of the same name. This is customary; there is no formal or general rule. For example, the whole period during which a succession of four Georges (George I, II, III, and IV) of the Hanoverian dynasty reigned in Great Britain became known as the Georgian era. Conversely, although there were many Edwards, the Edwardian era always refers to the reign of Edward VII at the beginning of the 20th century.

==Monarchies==

===Ancient rulers===

Ancient rulers in many parts of the world took regnal names or throne names which were different from their personal name. This is known to be true, for instance, of several kings of Assyria, and appears to be the case for several kings of Judah. In Ancient Egypt, Pharaohs took a number of names—the &quot;praenomen&quot; being the most commonly used, on occasion in conjunction with their personal name.

=== Africa ===
==== Ethiopia ====
In the Ethiopian Empire, especially during the Solomonic dynasty, many Emperors would take a throne name, though this was not a general practice; a great number of rulers would remain known during their reign by their birth names. Yekuno Amlak, the founder of the Solomonic dynasty, took his father&#x27;s name, Tasfa Iyasus, as his throne name. Yagbe&#x27;u Seyon, his son and heir, took the throne name Salomon after the biblical figure. Amda Seyon took the throne name Gebre Mesqel, &quot;slave of the cross&quot;; Tewodros I was Walda Ambasa, &quot;son of the lion&quot;; Sarwe Iyasus was Mehreka Nañ &quot;distributor of your [the Lord&#x27;s] mercy&quot;; etc. Tafari Makonnen, the last sovereign Emperor of Ethiopia, took as his throne name Haile Selassie, meaning &quot;Power of the Trinity&quot;.

==== Nigeria ====
In the various extant traditional states of Nigeria, the regnal names of the titled monarchs, who are known locally as the traditional rulers, serve two very important functions within the monarchical system. Firstly, seeing as how most states are organised in such a way as to mean that &quot;all&quot; of the legitimate descendants of the first man or woman to arrive at the site of any given community are considered its dynastic heirs, their thrones are usually rotated amongst almost endless pools of contending cousins who all share the names of the founders of their houses as primary surnames. In order to tell them all apart from one another, secondary surnames are also used for the septs of each of the royal families that are eligible for the aforementioned rotations, names that often come from the names of state of the first members of their immediate lineages to rule in their lands. Whenever any of their direct heirs ascend the thrones, they often use their septs&#x27; names as reign names as well, using the appropriate ordinals to differentiate themselves from the founders of the said septs. An example of this is found in the kingdom of Lagos, where the Adeniji-Adele family is distinguished from their numerous Adele cousins by the word &quot;Adeniji&quot;, which was actually the first name of the reigning founder of their branch of the dynasty, the Oba Adeniji Adele II. This distinction notwithstanding, both groups of dynasts (as well as a number of other ones that do not have the name Adele as an official surname, such as that of the Oloye Adekunle Ojora, a prominent nobleman of royal descent) are part of what is known as the Adele Ajosun Ruling House of Lagos.

Beyond that which is described above, regnal names also serve in Nigeria and indeed in much of Africa as chronological markers in much the same way that those of Europe do (e.g. the &quot;Victorian&quot; era). Whenever one hears of a person describing what happened at the time when so and so ruled over any particular place or people, what he or she is actually saying is that an event happened within a finite period of time, one that is equal to the duration of the reign of the monarch in question. Now seeing as how it is possible (and in fact common, particularly among the southern tribes) for one individual to have several different names and aliases in a single life, a certain degree of uniformity in usage is required if the history of an entire state is to be tied to his or her name. It is for this reason that when new monarchs are enthroned, the uniqueness of their names is usually considered to be a matter of considerable importance (even when it is caused by nothing more than the adding of ordinals to them or the allowing of more than a generation to pass before their subsequent usage). An example of this can be found in the kingdom of Benin, where the throne name of Erediauwa I became the surname of all of his immediate family in the Eweka royal house of the state, thus nominally tying them and their descendants to the era of his reign. This is especially obvious when their branch&#x27;s name is compared to the last names of the said king&#x27;s brothers and their heirs, named the Akenzuas after his father Akenzua II, and his uncles and their heirs, named the Ewekas after his grandfather Eweka II.

In the case of the comparatively small number of Nigerian monarchs, such as Obi Nnaemeka Achebe of Onitsha, who do not make use of regnal names as a result of a variety of reasons, pre-coronation names are maintained during their reigns.

=== Asia ===
==== Sinosphere ====
Monarchies of the Chinese cultural sphere practiced naming taboo, wherein the personal names of the rulers were to be avoided.

Monarchs could adopt or be honored with regnal names (; ) during their reign or after they had abdicated.

Since the Shang dynasty, Chinese sovereigns could be honored with temple names (; ) after their death, for the purpose of ancestor worship. Temple names consisted of two or three Chinese characters, with the last word being either (; &quot;progenitor&quot;) or (; &quot;ancestor&quot;). Since the Zhou dynasty, Chinese monarchs were frequently accorded posthumous names (; ) after their death. Posthumous names were adjectives originally intended to determine the achievements and moral values, or the lack thereof, of one&#x27;s life. Since both titles were accorded only after one&#x27;s death, they were not effectively regnal names. As a result of Chinese cultural and political influence, temple names and posthumous names were adopted by monarchs of Korea and Vietnam, whereas monarchs of Japan adopted only posthumous names.

Since 140 BC, during the reign of the Emperor Wu of Han, Chinese sovereigns often proclaimed era names (; ) for the purpose of identifying and numbering years. Prior to the Ming dynasty, it was common for Chinese monarchs to proclaim more than one era name during a single reign, or that a single era name could span the reigns of several rulers. Monarchs of the Ming and Qing dynasties, however, often adopted only one era name throughout their reign. Thus, Chinese sovereigns of the Ming and Qing dynasties came to be highly associated with the corresponding era name of their reign and are commonly known by their respective era name with few exceptions, although era names were not effectively regnal names. The era name system was also adopted by rulers of Korea, Vietnam and Japan, with Japan still using the system to this day.

The following table provides examples from China, Japan, Korea and Vietnam to illustrate the differences between monarchical titles in the Sinosphere. Bold characters represent the most common way to refer to the monarchs.

===Europe===

====Hungary====
During the Middle Ages, when the House of Árpád disappeared in 1301, two of the monarchs who claimed the throne and were crowned chose a different name. Otto III, Duke of Bavaria became Bela V of Hungary, taking the name of his maternal grandfather, Béla IV of Hungary. On the other hand, Wenceslaus III of Bohemia signed his royal documents in Hungary as Ladislas, this being a very traditional name in the Kingdom.

Later during the first half of the 14th century, Charles I of Hungary signed as &quot;Carolus rex&quot;, but in fact his birth name was the Italian &quot;Caroberto&quot;. This is why he is often referred to by Hungarian historians as &quot;Charles Robert of Hungary&quot;.

====Netherlands====
All ruling male members of the House of Orange-Nassau bore the name Willem (William). The current king of the Netherlands was christened Willem-Alexander. During an interview in 1997 he said he intended to rule under the name of Willem IV, but he had a change of mind. In a televised interview just before his inauguration, he announced he would continue to use the name Willem-Alexander, saying &quot;I spent 46 years of my life under the name Willem-Alexander, and specifically under the nickname of Alexander. I think it would be weird to discard that because I become king of the country.&quot; Furthermore, he said he did not consider himself &quot;a mere number&quot;, adding that regnal numbers reminded him of Dutch cattle naming conventions.

====Poland====
When the House of Piast disappeared and the Lithuanian House of Jagiellon was elected in the figure of the High Duke Jogaila, this monarch took the name of Władysław II, in honour of the previous Polish king (Władysław I the Elbow-high) with this traditional name. Similarly, when the Elector of Saxony, Frederick Augustus I, was elected king in 1697, he took the name of Augustus II. His son Frederick Augustus II crowned in 1734, also took the name of Augustus, becoming Augustus III.

====Portugal====
The monarchs of Portugal have traditionally used their first baptismal name as their regnal name upon their accession. The only notable exception was Sancho I, who was born Martin of Burgundy (&quot;Martinho de Borgonha&quot;, in Portuguese). As he was a younger son, Martin was expected to join the clergy, and was named after Saint Martin of Tours, on whose feast day he had been born. When the heir apparent, Henry, died, the prince&#x27;s name was changed to Sancho, one with a more established royal tradition in the other Iberian monarchies (Navarre, Castile and Aragon).

====United Kingdom====
Though most monarchs of the United Kingdom have used their first baptismal name as their regnal name, on three occasions monarchs have chosen a different name.

First, Queen Victoria had been christened Alexandrina Victoria, but took the throne under the name Victoria.

When Victoria&#x27;s son, Prince Albert Edward, became king in 1901, he took the regnal name Edward VII, against the wish of his late mother. The new king declared that he chose the name Edward as an honoured name borne by six of his English predecessors, and that he preferred that the name Albert be only associated in royal history with his father.

In 1936, after the abdication crisis, Prince Albert, Duke of York, assumed the throne. His full name was Albert Frederick Arthur George, but he became King George VI rather than &quot;King Albert&quot;.

====Scotland====
When John, Earl of Carrick ascended the throne in 1390, it was deemed imprudent for him to take the regnal name of &quot;John II&quot;, due to the turbulent reigns of recent kings named John (John Balliol, John of England, and John II of France). Furthermore, royal propaganda of the time held that John Balliol had not been a legitimate king of Scots, making the new king&#x27;s regnal number also a difficult issue. To avoid these problems, John took the regnal name of &quot;Robert III&quot;, honouring his father and great-grandfather.

Upon the 1952 accession of Elizabeth II, the title &quot;Elizabeth II&quot; caused controversy in Scotland as there had never been a Scottish &quot;Elizabeth I&quot;. Winston Churchill suggested that British sovereigns would use either the Scottish or the English number, whichever was higher; this convention fit the pattern of prior reigns since the Acts of Union 1707, all subsequent monarchs either having higher regnal numbers in England (namely William IV, Edward VII, and Edward VIII) or had names not used before the Union (George and Victoria). New Royal Mail post boxes in Scotland bearing the cypher &quot;ER&quot;, were vandalised, after which, to avoid further problems, post boxes and Royal Mail vehicles in Scotland bore only the Crown of Scotland. A legal case, &quot;MacCormick v. Lord Advocate&quot; (1953 SC 396), contested the right of the Queen to title herself &quot;Elizabeth II&quot; in Scotland, arguing that to do so would be a breach of the Act of Union. The case, however, was dismissed on the grounds that the pursuers had no title to sue the Crown, and also that the numbering of monarchs was part of the royal prerogative, and thus not governed by the Act of Union.

====Roman Empire====
The Roman Emperors usually had the titles of &quot;Imperator Caesar Augustus&quot; in their names (which made these regnal names). Caesar came from the cognomen of Gaius Julius Caesar, Imperator meant Commander and Augustus meant venerable or majestic. The name usually went in two ways, Imperator (Praenomen, Nomen and Cognomen) Caesar Augustus or Imperator Caesar (Praenomen, Nomen and Cognomen) Augustus. Also, Imperator became a Praenomen of Roman Emperors, Augustus and Caesar became a cognomen of theirs.

==Religious offices==

===Catholic Church===

Immediately after a new pope is elected, and accepts the election, he is asked by the Dean of the College of Cardinals, &quot;By what name shall you be called?&quot; The new pope chooses the name by which he will be known. The senior Cardinal Deacon, or Cardinal Protodeacon, then appears on the balcony of Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica to proclaim the new Pope, informing the world of the man elected Pope, and under which name he would be known during his reign.

&lt;poem&gt;
Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum:
Habemus Papam!
Eminentissimum ac Reverendissimum Dominum,
Dominum [forename],
Sanctæ Romanæ Ecclesiæ Cardinalem [surname],
qui sibi nomen imposuit [papal name].
&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
I announce to you a great joy:
We have a Pope,
The Most Eminent and Most Reverend Lord,
Lord [forename],
Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church [surname],
who conferred upon himself the name [papal name].
&lt;/poem&gt;
During the first centuries of the church, priests elected bishop of Rome continued to use their baptismal names after their elections. The custom of choosing a new name began in AD 533 with the election of Mercurius. Mercurius had been named after the Roman god Mercury, and decided that it would not be appropriate for a pope to be named after a Roman god. Mercurius subsequently decreed that he would be known as John II. Since the end of the tenth century the pope has customarily chosen a new name for himself during his Pontificate; however, until the 16th century some pontiffs used their baptismal names.

The last pope to use his baptismal name was Pope Marcellus II in 1555, a choice that was even then quite exceptional. The names chosen by popes are not based on any system other than general honorifics. They have been based on immediate predecessors, mentors, political similarity, or even after family members—as was the case with Pope John XXIII. The practice of using the baptismal name as papal name has not been ruled out and future popes could elect to continue using their original names after being elected pope.

Often the new pontiff&#x27;s choice of name upon being elected to the papacy is seen as a signal to the world of whom the new pope will emulate or what policies he will seek to enact. Such is the case with Benedict XVI who, in fact, explained the reasons for his choice of name during his first General Audience in St. Peter&#x27;s Square, on 27 April 2005. On that occasion, he said that he wanted to remember &quot;Pope Benedict XV, that courageous prophet of peace, who guided the Church through turbulent times of war&quot;, and also &quot;Saint Benedict of Nursia, co-patron of Europe, whose life evokes the Christian roots of Europe&quot;.

There has never been a Pope Peter II. Even though there is no specific prohibition against choosing the name Peter, bishops elected to the Papacy have refrained from doing so even if their own given name was Peter. This is because of a tradition that only Saint Peter should have that honor. In the 10th century John XIV used the regnal name &quot;John&quot; because his given name was Peter. While some antipopes did take the name Peter II, their claims are not recognized by the mainstream Roman Catholic Church, and each of these men only either has or had a minuscule following that recognized their claims.

Probably because of the controversial Antipope John XXIII, new popes avoided taking the regnal name John for over 600 years until the election of Angelo Cardinal Roncalli in 1958. Immediately after his election, there was some confusion as to whether he would be known as John XXIII or John XXIV. Cardinal Roncalli thus moved to immediately resolve by declaring that he would be known as John XXIII.

In 1978, Albino Luciani became the first pope to use two names for his regnal name when he took the name John Paul I, including the &quot;I&quot;. He took the &quot;John Paul&quot; name to honor both John XXIII and Paul VI. With the unexpected death of John Paul I a little over a month later, Karol Wojtyła took the name John Paul II to honor his immediate predecessor.

Antipopes also have regnal names, and also use the ordinal to show their position in the line of previous pontiffs with their names. For example, David Bawden took the name Michael I when declared pope in 1990.

===Coptic Church===
Coptic popes also choose regnal names distinct from their given names.
=== Islamic caliphates ===
The use of regnal names () was uncommon in the Medieval Islamic era until the Abbasid Caliphate, when the first Abbasid caliph, Abu al-Abbas Abdullah ibn Muhammad, who overthrew the Umayyad dynasty, used the as-Saffah (&quot;the Blood-Shedder&quot;). This name carried a messianic association, a theme that would be continued by as-Saffah&#x27;s successors. The use of regnal names among the caliphs lasted throughout the reign of the Abbasid Caliphate, until the institution was deposed after the defeat of the Mamluk Sultanate and the capture of Caliph al-Mutawakkil III by the Ottoman Army in 1517.

The Fatimid caliphs adopted the Abbasid use of the to assert their claims of authority.

<doc id="491316" wikidata="Q255388" url="?curid=491316" title="Unit fraction">
<text>A unit fraction is a positive fraction with one as its numerator, 1/. It is the multiplicative inverse (reciprocal) of the denominator of the fraction, which must be a positive natural number. Examples are 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, etc. When an object is divided into equal parts, each part is a unit fraction of the whole.

Multiplying two unit fractions produces another unit fraction, but other arithmetic operations do not preserve unit fractions. In modular arithmetic, unit fractions can be converted into equivalent whole numbers, allowing modular division to be transformed into multiplication. Every rational number can be represented as a sum of distinct unit fractions; these representations are called Egyptian fractions based on their use in ancient Egyptian mathematics. Many infinite sums of unit fractions are meaningful mathematically.

In geometry, unit fractions can be used to characterize the curvature of triangle groups and the tangencies of Ford circles. Unit fractions are commonly used in fair division, and this familiar application is used in mathematics education as an early step toward the understanding of other fractions. Unit fractions are common in probability theory due to the principle of indifference. They also have applications in combinatorial optimization and in analyzing the pattern of frequencies in the hydrogen spectral series.

==Arithmetic==
The unit fractions are the rational numbers that can be written in the form formula_1 where formula_2 can be any positive natural number. They are thus the multiplicative inverses of the positive integers. When something is divided into formula_2 equal parts, each part is a formula_4 fraction of the whole.

===Elementary arithmetic===
Multiplying any two unit fractions results in a product that is another unit fraction:
formula_5
However, adding, subtracting, or dividing two unit fractions produces a result that is generally not a unit fraction:
formula_6

formula_7

formula_8

As the last of these formulas shows, every fraction can be expressed as a quotient of two unit fractions.

===Modular arithmetic===
In modular arithmetic, any unit fraction can be converted into an equivalent whole number using the extended Euclidean algorithm. This conversion can be used to perform modular division: dividing by a number formula_9, modulo formula_10, can be performed by converting the unit fraction formula_11 into an equivalent whole number modulo formula_10, and then multiplying by that number.

In more detail, suppose that formula_9 is relatively prime to formula_10 (otherwise, division by formula_9 is not defined modulo formula_10). The extended Euclidean algorithm for the greatest common divisor can be used to find integers formula_17 and formula_18 such that Bézout&#x27;s identity is satisfied:
formula_19
In modulo-formula_10 arithmetic, the term formula_21 can be eliminated as it is zero modulo formula_10. This leaves
formula_23
That is, formula_17 is the modular inverse of formula_9, the number that when multiplied by formula_9 produces one. Equivalently,
formula_27
Thus division by formula_9 (modulo formula_10) can instead be performed by multiplying by the integer formula_17.

==Combinations==
Several constructions in mathematics involve combining multiple unit fractions together, often by adding them.

===Finite sums===
Any positive rational number can be written as the sum of distinct unit fractions, in multiple ways. For example,
:formula_31
These sums are called Egyptian fractions, because the ancient Egyptian civilisations used them as notation for more general rational numbers. There is still interest today in analyzing the methods used by the ancients to choose among the possible representations for a fractional number, and to calculate with such representations. The topic of Egyptian fractions has also seen interest in modern number theory; for instance, the Erdős–Graham problem and the Erdős–Straus conjecture concern sums of unit fractions, as does the definition of Ore&#x27;s harmonic numbers.
In geometric group theory, triangle groups are classified into Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic cases according to whether an associated sum of unit fractions is equal to one, greater than one, or less than one respectively.

===Infinite series===
Many well-known infinite series have terms that are unit fractions. These include:
* The harmonic series, the sum of all positive unit fractions. This sum diverges, and its partial sums formula_32 closely approximate the natural logarithm of formula_2 plus the Euler–Mascheroni constant. Changing every other addition to a subtraction produces the alternating harmonic series, which sums to the natural logarithm of 2: formula_34
* The Leibniz formula for π is formula_35
* The Basel problem concerns the sum of the square unit fractions: formula_36 Similarly, Apéry&#x27;s constant is an irrational number, the sum of the cubed unit fractions.
* The binary geometric series is formula_37

===Matrices===
A Hilbert matrix is a square matrix in which the elements on the antidiagonal all equal the unit fraction formula_38. That is, it has elements
formula_39
For example, the matrix
formula_40
is a Hilbert matrix. It has the unusual property that all elements in its inverse matrix are integers. Similarly, defined a matrix whose elements are unit fractions whose denominators are Fibonacci numbers:
formula_41
where formula_42 denotes the Fibonacci number. He calls this matrix the Filbert matrix and it has the same property of having an integer inverse.

===Adjacency and Ford circles===

Two fractions formula_43 and formula_44 (in lowest terms) are called adjacent if formula_45 which implies that they differ from each other by a unit fraction:
formula_46
For instance, formula_47 and formula_48 are adjacent: formula_49 and formula_50. However, some pairs of fractions whose difference is a unit fraction are not adjacent in this sense: for instance, formula_51 and formula_52 differ by a unit fraction, but are not adjacent, because for them formula_53.

This terminology comes from the study of Ford circles. These are a system of circles that are tangent to the number line at a given fraction and have the squared denominator of the fraction as their diameter. Fractions formula_43 and formula_44 are adjacent if and only if their Ford circles are tangent circles.

==Applications==
===Fair division and mathematics education===
In mathematics education, unit fractions are often introduced earlier than other kinds of fractions, because of the ease of explaining them visually as equal parts of a whole. A common practical use of unit fractions is to divide food equally among a number of people, and exercises in performing this sort of fair division are a standard classroom example in teaching students to work with unit fractions.

===Probability and statistics===

In a uniform distribution on a discrete space, all probabilities are equal unit fractions. Due to the principle of indifference, probabilities of this form arise frequently in statistical calculations.

Unequal probabilities related to unit fractions arise in Zipf&#x27;s law. This states that, for many observed phenomena involving the selection of items from an ordered sequence, the probability that the item is selected is proportional to the unit fraction formula_4.

===Combinatorial optimization===
In the study of combinatorial optimization problems, bin packing problems involve an input sequence of items with fractional sizes, which must be placed into bins whose capacity (the total size of items placed into each bin) is one. Research into these problems has included the study of restricted bin packing problems where the item sizes are unit fractions.

One motivation for this is as a test case for more general bin packing methods. Another involves a form of pinwheel scheduling, in which a collection of messages of equal length must each be repeatedly broadcast on a limited number of communication channels, with each message having a maximum delay between the start times of its repeated broadcasts. An item whose delay is formula_57 times the length of a message must occupy a fraction of at least formula_58 of the time slots on the channel it is assigned to, so a solution to the scheduling problem can only come from a solution to the unit fraction bin packing problem with the channels as bins and the fractions formula_58 as item sizes.

Even for bin packing problems with arbitrary item sizes, it can be helpful to round each item size up to the next larger unit fraction, and then apply a bin packing algorithm specialized for unit fraction sizes. In particular, the harmonic bin packing method does exactly this, and then packs each bin using items of only a single rounded unit fraction size.

===Physics===

The energy levels of photons that can be absorbed or emitted by a hydrogen atom are, according to the Rydberg formula, proportional to the differences of two unit fractions. An explanation for this phenomenon is provided by the Bohr model, according to which the energy levels of electron orbitals in a hydrogen atom are inversely proportional to square unit fractions, and the energy of a photon is quantized to the difference between two levels.

Arthur Eddington argued that the fine-structure constant was a unit fraction. He initially thought it to be 1/136 and later changed his theory to 1/137. This contention has been falsified, given that current estimates of the fine structure constant are (to 6 significant digits) 1/137.036.

<doc id="491319" wikidata="Q3297716" url="?curid=491319" title="Wrigley Field (Los Angeles)">
<text>Wrigley Field was a ballpark in Los Angeles, California. It hosted minor league baseball teams in the region for more than 30 years. It was the home park for the Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League (PCL), as well as for the Los Angeles Angels of Major League Baseball (MLB) during its inaugural season in 1961. The park was designed by Zachary Taylor Davis, who had designed MLB stadiums Comiskey Park and Wrigley Field in Chicago, Illinois. The ballpark was used as the backdrop for Hollywood films about baseball, the 1960 TV series &quot;Home Run Derby&quot;, jazz festivals, beauty contests, and civil rights rallies.

==History==
Called Wrigley&#x27;s &quot;Million Dollar Palace&quot;, Wrigley Field was built in South Los Angeles in 1925, and was named after William Wrigley Jr., a chewing gum magnate. Wrigley owned the first tenants, the Los Angeles Angels, a PCL team, and its parent club, the Chicago Cubs. In 1925, the Angels moved to Wrigley Field. Wrigley&#x27;s Major League stadium (originally &quot;Weeghman Park,&quot; then &quot;Cubs Park&quot;) on the north side of Chicago was renamed Wrigley Field in 1926.

Wrigley Field in Los Angeles was built to resemble Spanish-style architecture. It was the first of the two ballparks to bear Wrigley&#x27;s name. Wrigley owned Santa Catalina Island where the Cubs conducted spring training in that island&#x27;s city of Avalon.

The playing field was aligned northeast (home plate to center field) at an elevation of above sea level. The boundary street in right field (east) was Avalon Boulevard, with a small parking lot. The other boundaries of the block were 41st Place (north, left field), 42nd Place (south, first base line), and San Pedro Street (west, third base line and a larger parking lot).

Lights were added to the park in 1930. Chicago&#x27;s Wrigley Field added lights in 1988, when night games were added to the Cubs&#x27; home schedule.

==Baseball==
===Minor League Baseball 1925–1957===

For 33 seasons, 1925 to 1957, the park was home to the Angels, which was a farm team of the Chicago Cubs. For 11 seasons, (1926–1935, 1938) the park was the home of PCL team, the Hollywood Stars. In 1930, the Angels and Stars combined to draw more than 850,000 fans. The Stars moved to a new ballpark, Gilmore Field, west of the Pan Pacific Auditorium. Angel players included Dodgers manager and Hall of Fame member Tommy Lasorda, Phillies, Expos, Twins and Angels manager Gene Mauch, actor Chuck Connors, Gene Baker, and Andy Pafko. The parent club, Chicago Cubs, was the first major league team to play at Wrigley, when it played the Angels in a spring training game in 1926. On March 20, 1949, the major league Cubs played the defending world champion Cleveland Indians in a spring training game before 24,517 people.
On February 21, 1957, the Dodgers bought a team in Fort Worth, Texas, Wrigley Field, the Angels franchise and their territorial rights for $3 million. L.A. Wrigley&#x27;s minor league baseball days ended when the Brooklyn Dodgers of the National League transferred to Los Angeles in 1958. The PCL Angels franchise relocated as the Spokane Indians to Avista Stadium in Spokane, Washington.

The Dodgers considered using Wrigley Field, the Rose Bowl in Pasadena and the Los Angeles Coliseum. The team opted for four seasons in the 93,000-seat L.A. Coliseum, which had a 251-foot foul line in left field, while awaiting construction of Dodger Stadium, with a seating capacity of 56,000.

===Major League Baseball: Los Angeles Angels===
In October 1960, MLB expanded the American League from eight to 10 teams. Teams were awarded to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. The L.A. franchise was awarded to Gene Autry and Bob Reynolds, and was called the Los Angeles Angels.

The home opener on April 27 was a 4–2 loss to the Minnesota Twins before a crowd of 11,931. In attendance were Vice President Richard Nixon, Casey Stengel, Ford Frick, Joe Cronin, and Ty Cobb.

On October 1, 1961, the Cleveland Indians beat the Angels, 8–5, before 9,868 fans. Steve Bilko hit the last home run in Wrigley.

The 1961 Angels were led in hitting by Albie Pearson with a .288 batting average, in home runs by Leon Wagner with 28, and runs batted in by Ken Hunt with 84. The pitching staff was led by Ken McBride with 12 wins. Future World Series winning manager Chuck Tanner played in seven games. The team drew 603,510 fans.

==Professional boxing==
Wrigley was used frequently for boxing. Six world title boxing bouts were held there, including the 1939 Joe Louis-Jack Roper fight. Sugar Ray Robinson also boxed at Wrigley Field. Robinson won the Middleweight Championship on May 18, 1956, knocking out Carl Olson before 18,000 fans. On August 18, 1958, in a Heavyweight Championship fight, Floyd Patterson defeated Roy Harris with 17,000 in attendance.

== Football ==
===1938 NFL Pro-Bowl===
Several weeks after the completion of the season, the first NFL Pro Bowl was held at Wrigley Field on January 15, 1939. Sammy Baugh was among those on the rosters that matched the champion New York Giants against All-Star NFL players.

===Pepperdine University===
The Pepperdine Waves college football team played home games at Wrigley Field in 1948.

==Soccer==
On May 28, 1959, the park hosted a soccer friendly match between England and the United States; England won in front of 13,000.
On June 1, 1960, Scottish Champions Hearts defeated England&#x27;s Manchester United 4–0 in front of a crowd of 11,000. The U.S. Men&#x27;s National Team played a World Cup qualifier against Mexico on November 6, 1960, drawing 3–3 before 9,500 people.

Wrigley Field hosted the replay of the 1964 National Challenge Cup final between the Los Angeles Kickers and Philadelphia Ukrainians. The Kickers won 2–0.

==Movies and television filming==
Being closer to Hollywood than the other major league baseball fields at the dawn of motion pictures, Wrigley Field was a popular place to film baseball movies. The first film known to have used Wrigley as a shooting location was 1927&#x27;s &quot;Babe Comes Home&quot;, a silent film starring Babe Ruth. Some well-known movies filmed there were &quot;The Pride of the Yankees&quot; (1942) and &quot;Damn Yankees&quot; (1958). When Frank Capra filmed the public rally scene at Wrigley for &quot;Meet John Doe&quot; in August 1940, massive sprinklers simulated a downpour because the director included one rainy scene in each movie as good luck. The &quot;film noir&quot; classic &quot;Armored Car Robbery&quot; (1950) had its title heist set at Wrigley.

The ballpark later found its way into television, serving as the backdrop for the &quot;Home Run Derby&quot; series in 1960, a popular show filmed in 1959 which featured one-on-one contests between baseball&#x27;s top home run hitters, which had a revival in 1989 when it aired on ESPN, and later on ESPN Classic. Episodes of shows as diverse as &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; (&quot;The Mighty Casey&quot;, 1960), &quot;The Munsters&quot; (&quot;Herman The Rookie&quot;, 1965), and &quot;Mannix&quot; (&quot;To Catch a Rabbit&quot;, 1969) were also filmed there. Some closeups were filmed there for insertion into the 1951 film &quot;Angels in the Outfield&quot;, a film otherwise set at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh. A 1932 movie short starring Babe Ruth, titled &quot;Just Pals&quot;, was also filmed at Wrigley Field.

== Jazz concerts ==
Leon Hefflin, Sr. produced the first largest outdoor jazz entertainment event of its kind, the Cavalcade of Jazz, held at Wrigley as part of the Central Avenue jazz scene and showcased over 125 artists from 1945 to 1956. The Cavalcade of Jazz concerts were the stepping stone to success for such stars as Toni Harper, Dinah Washington, Roy Milton, Frankie Lane and others. He also hosted a beauty contest at the events. His first COJ show starred Count Basie &amp; His Orchestra, Joe Liggins &amp; His Honeydrippers, Valaida Snow, Big Joe Turner, the Peters Sisters, Slim &amp; Bam (Slim Gaillard and Bam Brown), and more artists on September 23, 1945, with a crowd of 15,000.

==Demolition==
Following the Angels&#x27; departure after the 1961 season, Wrigley Field had no regular tenants. By then the park was owned by the city, and various events were staged. On May 26, 1963, a large crowd attended a civil rights rally featuring Martin Luther King Jr. By 1966 the park was being used for soccer matches.

In October 1968, the ballpark was renamed Gilbert Lindsay Community Center as a first step in renovating the site. Demolition was underway by January 1969. The resulting city park has a ball field in the northwest corner of the property, which was once a parking area. The diamond is locally known as &quot;Wrigley Field&quot;, and is the home of Wrigley Little League baseball and softball. The original site of the Wrigley diamond and grandstand is occupied by the Kedren Community Mental Health Center and another parking lot.

<doc id="491320" wikidata="Q1534777" url="?curid=491320" title="Gold bug">
<text>&quot;Gold bug&quot; (sometimes spelled &quot;goldbug&quot;) is a term frequently employed in the financial sector and among economists in reference to persons who are extremely bullish on the commodity gold as an investment or a standard for measuring wealth. Depending on the circumstances the term can have one or a combination of closely related and often overlapping themes that extend beyond the support for gold as an investment, including in some cases the use of the term as a pejorative.

==Various themes on the term==
* An investor or speculator who is very bullish in buying the commodity gold, or similarly themed financial products such as junior mining companies, gold certificates, bullion ETFs, and other derivative instruments related to precious metals.
* A person who opposes or criticizes the use of &quot;fiat currency&quot; and supports a return to the use of the gold standard or some other currency system based on the value of gold and other &quot;hard&quot; assets.
* Someone who considers one commodity, usually gold, &quot;the appropriate measure of wealth, regardless of the quantity of other goods and services that it can buy&quot;.
*A person, often with views summarized above, that subscribes to &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; relating to gold &amp; silver, frequently including but not limited to, alleged manipulation of the price of precious metals and the supposed disappearance of gold held by the United States Government at Fort Knox. The Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee (GATA) is a small but prominent promoter of such conspiracy theories within the gold bug community. However, such persons are widely dismissed as cranks and their beliefs as fringe by reputable economists, business leaders and government officials.

===History===
The concept, in the second sense, was popularized in the 1896 U.S. presidential election, when William McKinley supporters took to wearing gold lapel pins, gold neckties, and gold headbands in a demonstration of support for gold against the &quot;silver menace&quot;.

===Notable gold bugs===

<text>The Limey is a 1999 American crime film directed by Steven Soderbergh and written by Lem Dobbs. The film features Terence Stamp, Lesley Ann Warren, Luis Guzmán, Barry Newman, Nicky Katt, and Peter Fonda. The plot concerns an English career criminal (Stamp) who travels to the United States to investigate the recent suspicious death of his daughter. It was filmed on location in Los Angeles and Big Sur.

Critical reception was positive, but the film was not a financial success upon release. The film was nominated for five Independent Spirit Awards, including Best Film, Best Director, and Best Screenplay. Stamp and Guzmán were nominated for Best Male Lead and Best Supporting Male Lead respectively.

==Plot==
English criminal Wilson travels to Los Angeles to investigate the death of his daughter, Jenny, who was reported to have died in a car accident; however, Wilson suspects murder. Recently released from prison after nine years, he is a hardened man. Arriving in Los Angeles, he questions Jenny&#x27;s friends Eduardo and Elaine. Finding that they pass his initial inquiry, he elicits their help in investigating Jenny&#x27;s death. One suspect who emerges is Terry Valentine, the wealthy record producer Jenny was dating. Valentine was briefly involved in drug trafficking which was managed through his security consultant, Avery. Wilson locates a warehouse used by the drug trafficker and asks about Valentine. They insult his daughter and beat him. Wilson returns to the warehouse, shooting dead all but one of the employees.

Wilson and Eduardo sneak into a party held at Valentine&#x27;s house. Once there, Wilson searches for evidence of Valentine&#x27;s involvement. He finds and steals a picture of Jenny. Attracting suspicion from Avery, Wilson is accosted by a guard whom he head-butts and throws over a railing to his death. Wilson and Eduardo flee, only to be chased by Avery, who rams their car and shoots at them. He and Eduardo escape but not before Avery hears Eduardo call out Wilson&#x27;s name.

Back with Elaine and Eduardo, Wilson reminisces about his earlier life with his daughter, whom he remembers only as a child. Worried her father would be sent away to prison, she would often threaten to call the police whenever she found evidence of the crimes he was involved in or planning. He recalls she had never followed through on her threats because she loved him and it eventually became a sad joke between them. However, his life of crime put a strain on his family. He ended up in prison after the men he was involved with sold him out to the police.

Avery hires a hitman, Stacy, to track down and kill Wilson. Stacy is prevented from making the hit by agents of the DEA, who have been monitoring Valentine. Wilson and Elaine are then taken to meet the head agent, who makes it clear the DEA is after the dealer who used Valentine to launder drug money, and that the agents do not intend to interfere with Wilson&#x27;s personal mission. He lets Wilson see their file on Valentine, including a photograph and address of a second home in Big Sur. Meanwhile, Stacy and his partner, angry at their beating at the hands of the DEA agents, plot to double cross Avery.

Avery moves Valentine to the house in Big Sur. That night, Wilson enters the grounds. Avery&#x27;s guards shoot an intruder who turns out to be Stacy and engages in a shootout with his partner, Uncle John, resulting in several deaths and also fatally wounding Avery. Valentine takes Avery&#x27;s gun away from him and leaves him to die as he flees to the beach with Wilson in pursuit. Betrayed, Avery takes out his spare gun and aims it at Wilson but lowers it, allowing him to pursue Valentine. Valentine shoots at Wilson then falls and breaks his ankle. He continues to shoot at the approaching Wilson but misses and after running out of bullets, he begs for his life. Valentine tells Wilson that Jenny found out about his drug ties and threatened to call the police on him (reminding Wilson of what she had done as a child to him) and in his attempt to stop her Valentine banged Jenny against a wall, accidentally killing her. In an effort to deflect attention from Valentine, Avery staged the car accident. Wilson knows Jenny would never have turned Valentine in. He turns away, allowing Valentine to live. Wilson makes his farewells to Elaine and Eduardo and returns to London.

A younger Wilson plays the folk love song Colours on the guitar, while a woman strokes his hair.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Directing===
Steven Soderbergh uses atypical flashback sequences, and includes several scenes (largely without dialogue) from a much older Terence Stamp movie, Ken Loach&#x27;s 1967 directorial debut &quot;Poor Cow.&quot; Soderbergh uses the scenes to create a hazy back story to show Stamp&#x27;s character as a young man, his criminal past, his relationship with Jenny&#x27;s mother and child Jenny&#x27;s disapproving attitudes towards his crooked lifestyle. Wilson often speaks in a Cockney rhyming slang. The title refers to the American slang &quot;limey&quot;, which refers to Britons.

===Editing===
Soderbergh and film editor Sarah Flack utilize a variety of unorthodox editing techniques in &quot;The Limey&quot;. The film frequently features dialogue and background sound from previous or future scenes juxtaposed with a current scene. Dialogue from one conversation, for instance, may find itself dispersed throughout the film, articulated for the first time long after its chronological moment has passed, as a sort of narrative flashback superimposed over later conversation, to complete a character&#x27;s thought or punctuate a character&#x27;s emphasis. Background sound may be disjointed in the film and shifted to enhance another scene by suggesting continuation, similarity, or dissimilarity. For example, Wilson is in a hotel room, and turns on the shower, and then Wilson is in an aeroplane looking out of the window, while the shower can be heard.

==Release==
&quot;The Limey&quot; was first presented at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival on May 15. It was also featured at the Toronto International Film Festival, the Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema, and the Hong Kong International Film Festival.

A limited release in the US began on October 8, 1999, and did poorly at the box office. Its first week&#x27;s gross was $187,122 (17 screens) and the total receipts for the run were $3,193,102. The film was in wide release for seventeen weeks (115 days), and was shown in 105 theaters.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Critical reception of &quot;The Limey&quot; was largely positive. The review aggregator Metacritic reported an average rating of 73 out of 100.

Edward Guthmann, film critic of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, praised the direction and screenplay, and wrote, &quot;&quot;The Limey&quot; ... is a first-rate crime thriller and further proof that Soderbergh is one of our great contemporary film stylists. Taut, imaginative and complex, this is one of the best American films of the year and a wonderful antidote to the numbing sameness of [some] movies.&quot; Critic Janet Maslin wrote of Terence Stamp&#x27;s work, &quot;Stamp plays the title role furiously, with single-minded intensity, wild blue eyes and a stentorian roar shown off in the film&#x27;s early moments ... Glimpses of young, dreamily beautiful Stamp and his no less imposing latter-day presence are used by Soderbergh with touching efficacy.&quot;

The film critic for &quot;Variety&quot; magazine, Emanuel Levy, lauded the crime drama and liked the direction of the picture, the acting, and the screenplay, yet thought the film &quot;lacks secondary characters and subplots.&quot; He wrote, &quot;&quot;The Limey,&quot; Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s new crime picture, continues the helmer&#x27;s artistic renewal, evident last year in the superbly realized &quot;Out of Sight.&quot; Pic&#x27;s most interesting element is the positioning of two icons of 1960s cinema, the very British Terence Stamp and the very American Peter Fonda, as longtime enemies in what&#x27;s basically a routine revenge thriller ... [and] one has no problem praising the bravura acting of the entire ensemble and the pic&#x27;s impressive technical aspects. Warren, Guzman and Barry Newman give maturely restrained performances in line with the film&#x27;s dominant texture. A supporting turn by Joe Dallessandro, Andy Warhol&#x27;s and Paul Morrissey&#x27;s regular, accentuates pic&#x27;s reflexive nature as a commentary on a bygone era of filmmaking.&quot;

Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave &quot;The Limey&quot; 3 stars out of a possible 4. Despite the unusual editing, Ebert described the plot as &quot;basic Ross Macdonald&quot;, a reference to the mystery writer whose 1950s and &#x27;60s best-sellers set in southern California typically featured doom visited on the young adult children of wealthy parents with dark secrets. Stamp and Fonda, both aging icons of the 1960s, represent different sides of the counterculture: &quot;It is a nice irony that both Valentine and Wilson (the Stamp character) made their money from rock music: Valentine by selling the tickets, Wilson by stealing the receipts of a Pink Floyd concert.&quot;

<doc id="491326" wikidata="Q1345767" url="?curid=491326" title="Pietro Frua">
<text>Pietro Frua (2 May 1913 - 28 June 1983) was one of the leading Italian coachbuilders and car designers during the 1950s and 1960s.

==Early years==
Frua was born in Turin, the centre of coachbuilding in northern Italy. He was the fourth son of Angela, a tailor, and Carlo Frua, an employee of Fiat.

After school he was educated as a draftsman at the Scuola Allievi Fiat, where he underwent his apprenticeship.

==Design career==
Frua&#x27;s professional career began at the age of 17, when he joined Stabilimenti Farina as a draftsman. At the age of 22, he became Director of Styling at the Stabilimenti Farina, already a leading Turin coachbuilder employing several hundred people. Some credit him with having influenced early designs of the iconic Vespa while at Farina. That was where Frua had his first contact with Giovanni Michelotti, who became his successor as Head of Styling after he started his own studio in 1938.

During World War II car-styling work was scarce and Frua had to turn to designing children&#x27;s cars, electric ovens and kitchen units, as well as a monocoque motorscooter.

Frua planned for post-war times: in 1944 he bought a bombed-out factory, hired 15 workers (including Sergio Coggiola, who founded his own carrozzeria in 1966) and equipped himself to design and build cars.
His first known car is a 1946 Fiat 1100C spyder. Maserati was one of the first clients who contracted Frua for the styling of their new 2-litre, 6-cylinder sports car, the A6G. From 1950 to 1957, Frua built 19 Spyders and seven coupés in three different design series – including some on the A6 GCS racing chassis.

In 1957, Frua sold his small coachbuilding company to Carrozzeria Ghia in Turin, and Ghia director Luigi Segre appointed him head of Ghia Design. In this short period, Frua was responsible for the successful Renault Floride, which experienced well-deserved commercial success (about 117,000 were sold in ten years). This success led to a disagreement between Segre and Frua over the car&#x27;s “paternity”, and Frua left Ghia to start his own design studio again.

At the same time, Pelle Petterson designed his Volvo P1800 under the attentive eye of Frua and, not surprisingly, it is often attributed to Frua&#x27;s pen. From 1957 to 1959, Frua also designed several cars for Ghia-Aigle, the former Swiss subsidiary of Ghia Turin, already independent at that time. Giovanni Michelotti was his predecessor in this position.

After Ghia-Aigle finished coachbuilding, a former employee, Adriano Guglielmetti, started his own business and founded Carrosserie Italsuisse in Geneva. Again Pietro Frua did the drawings and, most probably, built all the prototypes for this company. After a Corvair-like styled pontoon-Beetle in 1960, Italsuisse showed a Maserati 3500 GTI Coupé on the Italsuisse stand at the 1961 Motor Show in Geneva, together with two tasteful bodies on Studebaker chassis. In 1964 a lovely little Spyder followed with Opel Kadett mechanics.

During the 1960s Pietro Frua was among the most prominent car designers in Italy. The “Frua line” was synonymous with the good taste of a single man. He followed each car&#x27;s realization to the last detail of fully functional one-offs and prototypes, often driving them to their presentation at the motor shows in Europe.

===Glas===

In 1963, at the age of 50 and at the peak of his career, Frua designed a range of cars for Glas, Germany&#x27;s smallest car-maker. This included the GT Coupé and Cabriolet as well as the larger V8-engined 2600, often called &quot;Glaserati&quot; for its likeness with Frua&#x27;s Maserati-designs. These were built until 1968 as the BMW GT, after BMW had bought Glas. 
===Maserati Mistral===

Also in 1963, Maserati showed the Frua-bodied four-door Quattroporte which, after several one-offs, re-established Frua&#x27;s connection with this manufacturer. Two years later, the Mistral was shown, cementing Frua&#x27;s status in the mid-sixties. With these cars Maserati was positioned into a new market of luxury and powerful, understated cars.

===AC Frua===

In 1965, AC showed the powerful, Frua-bodied 7-litre AC Frua Spyder, which drew from the Mistral&#x27;s shape. A coupé followed in 1967. In the same year, the Swiss racing driver and Ferrari importer Peter Monteverdi started to build a Frua-bodied sport coupé, the Chrysler engined Monteverdi High Speed 375S. He also designed the Monteverdi 2000 GTI, but this remained a one-off. Due to Frua&#x27;s limited capacities, the production of the following High Speed models went to Fissore in Turin. However, the Monteverdi Hai 450 is believed to have been designed by Frua.

At the end of the 1960s, Frua tried in vain to prolong his success with Glas by making a dozen proposals to BMW. BMW decided to make it on their own.

Although he was not the principal designer, Frua produced the bodywork and did final assembly and detailing for Peter Kalikow&#x27;s Momo Mirage prototypes in the early 1970s. Frua had been recommended to Kalikow by Derek Hurlock, chairman and managing director of AC Cars, in part because of his work on the AC Frua.

In the 1970s Frua reduced the frequency of his presentations, but in the sixth decade of his life he still demonstrated his good taste and craftsmanship to the younger ones who already had taken their role in the industrial process. There was no longer a demand to build completely detailed and functional prototypes in less than ten weeks, and no more customers for special bodied one-offs. One of his last designs to enter series production was the two-door GT Maserati Kyalami first shown at the 1976 Geneva Motor Show.

==Later years==
In 1982 Pietro Frua developed cancer and had unsuccessful surgery in the autumn of that year. He married his long-time assistant, Gina, shortly before he died on 28 June 1983, a few weeks after his 70th birthday.

<doc id="491327" wikidata="Q6975138" url="?curid=491327" title="National Puzzlers' League">
<text>The National Puzzlers&#x27; League (NPL) is a nonprofit organization focused on puzzling, primarily in the realm of word play and word games. Founded in 1883, it is the oldest puzzlers&#x27; organization in the world. It originally hosted semiannual conventions in February and September of each year, but conventions are now held annually, in July.

==History==
On July 4, 1883, twenty-eight word puzzlers, mostly young men, met at Pythagoras Hall in New York City and founded the Eastern Puzzlers&#x27; League; they then celebrated the event by paying a penny each to walk across the newly dedicated Brooklyn Bridge. Renamed the National Puzzlers&#x27; League in 1920, the organization has been in continuous existence ever since that first meeting and is the oldest puzzlers&#x27; organization in the world.

The league&#x27;s official publication began as &quot;The Eastern Enigma&quot;. It originally contained few, if any, puzzles, and instead reported on business transacted at puzzlers&#x27; conventions, presented verses and skits composed by members, and relayed debates on the controversial puzzling topics of the day, such as obsolete words, esoteric references, and new types of puzzles.

Early editors rarely served more than a year at a time, and the publication schedule was often irregular. The January 1900 issue initiated a puzzle department called &quot;Penetralia&quot;, which appeared regularly until 1903. &quot;Penetralia&quot; was resumed in the February 1910 issue, when &quot;The Eastern Enigma&quot; began monthly publication, and has continued to appear ever since. On the organization&#x27;s name change, the magazine was retitled &quot;The Enigma&quot;; it continues to be published monthly and has now reached over 1200 issues.

A puzzle renaissance in the 1920s and 1930s led to a high point in NPL membership, during which it adopted the slogan &quot;The National Intellectual Pastime of America&quot;. In 1935, president Everett M. Smith invented the word Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis at the annual League meeting. The biennial conventions were covered by major newspapers and wire services. During World War II, the Signal Intelligence Service recruited several NPL members as government cryptographers based on their puzzling experience.

In the 1960s, membership slumped significantly, but began rebounding in the &quot;modern&quot; puzzling era with the promotional efforts of Dmitri Borgmann, Ross Eckler, and others. Many of the leading puzzle editors and constructors in America are members; author and member Willard Espy said of the league&#x27;s expertise, &quot;I&#x27;m a little nervous talking about wordplay with this group ... it&#x27;s like talking about religion with God.&quot;

==Membership==
Each NPL member generally chooses a &quot;nom&quot; (short for &quot;nom de plume&quot;) upon joining, an often cryptic pen name which serves as a nickname when communicating with fellow members (see below for an example). The use of pseudonyms, also commonly practiced by the compilers of cryptic crosswords, originally helped &quot;to break down barriers of occupation or social class&quot;. It is also an opportunity for wordplay and self-description.

NPL members are known collectively as &quot;the Krewe&quot; and individually as &quot;puzzlers&quot;, &quot;Krewe members&quot;, or &quot;NPLers&quot;. As of 2018 the organization had about 700 members, of whom about 200 attend the group&#x27;s convention each year.

Puzzle professional Will Shortz (whose &quot;nom&quot;, WILLz, is a play on his name - Will+&quot;short Z&quot;) is a long-standing member and officer of the NPL, serving as its historian and as co-puzzle director (as of 2022) for the annual convention.

==Publications==
&quot;The Enigma&quot;, the NPL&#x27;s official publication, is distributed monthly to its members. It provides a medium for members to share their original word puzzles for fellow members to enjoy. &quot;The Enigma&quot; also contains articles and announcements of interest to its members.

The NPL has also published several editions of &quot;Guide to The Enigma&quot; (formerly &quot;Key to Puzzledom&quot;); a mini-sample of the puzzles in &quot;The Enigma&quot;, available free to prospective members from the editor; a member directory; and book compilations of hard cryptograms and cryptic crosswords.

==Puzzles==
&quot;The Enigma&quot; specializes in the types of puzzles that flourished in the 19th century; the crossword, invented as late as 1913, is spurned by the journal, which relegates it to the category of &quot;extras&quot;. However, all of its puzzles are based on wordplay and linguistics.

The NPL groups puzzles into four primary categories. The oldest two are the &quot;flat&quot; (which has a one-line answer) and the &quot;form&quot; (which has a multi-line answer). Flats (verse puzzles and anagrams) were a leading type of wordplay before black-squared crosswords were invented. They seem strange to modern puzzlers, because they require inferring words from context, which is not now a familiar solving technique. Nonetheless, flats today still make up most of the puzzles in &quot;The Enigma&quot;. Cryptograms and extras, as well as catchall categories for rule-breaking puzzles, were added later. More information on these puzzle types can be found at the NPL&#x27;s official website.

==Conventions==
The NPL holds an annual convention, usually in July. The location varies, but has historically been a major North American city. In keeping with the members&#x27; love of word play, the name of the convention varies with the location: This con&#x27;s in Wisconsin for Milwaukee; BeaCon for Boston; ConTex for Austin, Texas; OreCon for Portland, Oregon.

Examples of convention activities include word games, trivia games, hidden puzzles (which must be found before they can be solved), local field trips to places of NPL interest, library trivia hunts, and an &quot;extravaganza&quot; (a multi-stage puzzlehunt that requires team effort to solve). In addition to the puzzles presented as part of the convention, many members bring puzzles of their own invention, which attendees work on in small groups, often late at night.

<doc id="491329" wikidata="Q7499225" url="?curid=491329" title="Shiva (1990 film)">
<text>Shiva is a 1990 Indian Hindi-language action drama film written and directed by Ram Gopal Varma. It was a remake of Varma&#x27;s debut Telugu film, &quot;Siva&quot; (1989). The film has Nagarjuna (in his Hindi debut) and Amala in lead roles with Raghuvaran and J. D. Chakravarthy as the antagonists. All four actors reprise their roles from the original Telugu film. The film became a blockbuster. The success led to Ram Gopal Varma directing a prequel in 2006.

==Plot==
The film opens in a classroom in VAS College of Arts &amp; Sciences. After the classes, upon the directions of a college student, JD, a bunch of goons led by Ganesh savagely assaults a group of students right outside the college gate. It&#x27;s later made clear that JD was settling some campus scores and that the incident resulted in at least one student leaving the college, deepening the fear for JD on the campus.

It turns out that JD is the (unopposed) president of the college students&#x27; union and the leader of a notorious campus gang, powerful enough to prevent the college principal from taking disciplinary actions against their unsavory conduct, which includes eve-teasing and insulting professors. JD&#x27;s connections, through Ganesh, reach a gangster named Bhavani Chaudhury, whose criminal network lends muscle to a local politician, Tilak Dhari.

Shiva is a new student at college. He joins a small group of friends, including Prakash and Asha. Shiva&#x27;s confident gait and tough attitude led to JD locking horns with him. An inevitable fight ensues, in which Shiva and friends beat up JD&#x27;s gang in broad daylight within the campus. Emboldened by the incident, Shiva&#x27;s friends plan to fight the students&#x27; union elections. Shiva proposes the nerdy friend Naresh to stand for the presidency. He also rebuffs Ganesh&#x27;s initial warning to stay out of politics.

When Ganesh attempts to use force, Shiva beats him back too. The matter comes before Bhavani. Bhavani is mildly annoyed, but he studies Shiva as a potential replacement for JD. At his behest, Naresh is assaulted and rendered unable to run. At this point, Shiva accepts the nomination and decides to run.

Meanwhile, Bhavani has other troubles. He refuses to side with the worker&#x27;s union leader, Krishna Rao. Krishna Rao takes his plight to Shiva who agrees to help in return for muscle, and Rao provides this by calling upon the workers. Around this time, Asha expresses a romantic interest in Shiva. The friendship progresses, and they eventually marry.

The stage is now set. Bhavani launches a set of sniper attacks on those close to Shiva. Shiva retaliates in kind and takes out many of Bhavani&#x27;s leaders. Tilak Dhari notices that Shiva is launching a fitting response to Bhavani and decides to stop supporting him. Angered, humiliated, and defeated, Bhavani strikes Shiva&#x27;s home and finds Asha. When he learns that Ganesh has already been presented in court and an arrest warrant has been issued for him, Bhavani kills Asha and Tilakdhari for betrayal and leaves.

A final fight ensues in which eventually Shiva manages to kill Bhavani, ridding the city of one of its most terrifying anti-social elements, while personally coming to terms with the fact that he has lost almost everything in the bargain.

<doc id="491335" wikidata="Q1201144" url="?curid=491335" title="Soccer mom">
<text>Soccer mom is a term that broadly refers to an American, Canadian, or Australian, middle-class, suburban woman who spends a significant amount of her time transporting school-age children to youth sporting events or other activities (whether or not they are soccer related). It came into widespread use during the 1996 United States presidential election and over time has come to take on an unfavorable connotation.

==History==

The phrase &quot;soccer mom&quot; generally refers to a married, American, middle-class woman who lives in the suburbs and has school-age children. She is sometimes portrayed in the media as busy or overburdened and driving a minivan or SUV. She is also described as putting the interests of her family, and most importantly her children, ahead of her own. The phrase derives from the literal, specific description of a mother who transports and watches her children play soccer. It was also used in names of organizations of mothers who raised money to support their children&#x27;s soccer teams.

The first reference to the term &quot;soccer mom&quot; in the United States national media has been traced to 1982. In that year, the husband of the treasurer of the &quot;Soccer Moms booster club&quot; of Ludlow, Massachusetts, stole $3,150 raised for the benefit of a local soccer league ().

Indices of American magazines and newspapers show relatively little usage of the term until 1995, when, during an election for Denver city council, Susan B. Casey ran with the slogan: &quot;A Soccer Mom for City Council.&quot; Casey, who held a Ph.D. and managed presidential election campaigns, used the slogan as a way of assuring voters they could trust her to be &quot;just like them,&quot; denoting herself as &quot;everyneighbor.&quot; The phrase addressed anxiety about women&#x27;s achievements, and the stereotype that smart, accomplished women were not able to manage professional careers while showing love for their family. Casey won the election with 51 percent of the vote.

The term came into widespread use around the time of the 1996 Republican National Convention. Its first use in a news article about that election appeared in the July 21, 1996, edition of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. E. J. Dionne, the article&#x27;s author, quoted Alex Castellanos (at the time a senior media advisor to Bob Dole) as suggesting that Bill Clinton was targeting a voting demographic whom Castellanos called the &quot;soccer mom&quot;. The soccer mom was described in the article as &quot;the overburdened middle income working mother who ferries her kids from soccer practice to scouts to school.&quot; The article suggested that the term &quot;soccer mom&quot; was a creation of political consultants. Castellanos was later quoted in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; as saying: &quot;She&#x27;s the key swing consumer in the marketplace, and the key swing voter who will decide the election.&quot;

Media interest in soccer moms picked up as the election approached. The number of articles on soccer moms in major newspapers increased from a combined total of 12 for the months of August and September to a total of 198 for October and November. The intense media focus stemmed in large part from the media&#x27;s belief that soccer moms had become the most sought-after group of swing voters in the 1996 elections. In the end, suburban women favored Clinton by 53 to 39 percent, while suburban men voted for Dole.

During the election, the soccer mom&#x27;s most frequently mentioned attribute cited in major newspaper articles was that she was a mother or a woman who had children. The soccer mom&#x27;s next most frequently mentioned characteristics were that &quot;she lives in the suburbs (41.2% of the articles); is a swing voter (30.8%); is busy, harried, stressed out, or overburdened (28.4%); works outside the home (24.6%); drives a minivan (usually a Volvo) station wagon or sport utility vehicle (20.9%); is middle-class (17.1%); is married (13.7%); and is white (13.3%).&quot;

Soccer moms received so much attention during the election that the American Dialect Society voted &quot;soccer mom&quot; Word of the Year for 1996. Columnist Ellen Goodman of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; called 1996 &quot;the Year of the Soccer Mom.&quot; The Associated Press named soccer moms, along with the Macarena, Bob Dole, and &quot;Rules Girls&quot; as four phenomena that would be forever associated with the year 1996.

==Criticism==
Soccer moms have been accused of forcing their children to participate in too many after-school activities, overparenting them in concerted cultivation rather than letting them enjoy their childhood.

In 2003, the car manufacturer Nissan, who had for several years courted the &quot;soccer-mom&quot; image, started marketing their Quest minivan as &quot;stylish, sexy and desirable&quot;.

==Related terms==
===Security moms===
During the 2004 presidential campaign, pundits started talking about the security mom, which was deemed to be a powerful voting bloc. Security moms were supposed to be concerned primarily with issues such as the war in Iraq, domestic terrorism, and the security of their children.

There is evidence, however, that security moms did not exist in great enough numbers to influence the 2004 election outcome. Democratic women tended to be most interested in healthcare, which Democratic front runner John Kerry abandoned as a talking point, and may explain Kerry&#x27;s difficulty in garnering their support.

===Hockey mom===
Hockey mom is a term widely used in Canada and northern United States (including Alaska), in which mothers often take their children to hockey rinks. The first article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that used &quot;hockey mom&quot; as a demographic term was a 1999 review of the Chevrolet Silverado, a full-size pickup truck. In the article, the truck is described as a &quot;smooth and gutsy&quot; vehicle that &quot;ought to please everyone from hockey mom to cattle hauler&quot;.

Former Alaska governor Sarah Palin, the US Republican vice-presidential candidate in 2008, described herself as a &quot;hockey mom&quot; as far back as her 2006 gubernatorial race. In her speech at the 2008 Republican National Convention and in stump speeches following the convention, she joked that the only difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull was lipstick, suggesting that hockey moms are tough. &quot;Hockey partisans&quot; on the Internet claim that hockey moms are &quot;a bit more intense than their soccer counterparts, both in terms of the commitments they make to the sport and the intensity with which they cheer their kids.&quot;

<doc id="491342" wikidata="Q1233944" url="?curid=491342" title="Doctrine of lapse">
<text>The doctrine of lapsation was a policy of annexation initiated by the East India Company in the Indian subcontinent for the princely states, and applied until the year 1858, the year after Company rule was succeeded by the British Raj under the British Crown. 

The policy is associated with James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie.

Elements of the doctrine of lapse continued to be applied by the post-independence Indian government to derecognise individual princely families until 1971, when the recognition of former ruling families was discontinued under the 26th amendment to the Indian constitution by the Indira Gandhi government.

== Doctrine ==
According to the doctrine, any Indian princely state under the suzerainty of the East India Company, the dominant imperial power in the Indian system of subsidiary alliances, would have its princely status abolished, and therefore be annexed into directly ruled British India, if the ruler was either &quot;manifestly incompetent or died without a male heir&quot;. This supplanted the long-established right of an Indian sovereign without an heir to choose a successor.

The policy is most commonly associated with Dalhousie, who was the East India Company&#x27;s Governor-General of India of British India between 1848 and 1856. However, the doctrine was articulated by the Court of Directors of the Company as early as 1834, and several smaller states had already been annexed under this doctrine before Dalhousie took over the post of Governor-General.

By the use of the doctrine of lapse, the Company took over the princely states of Satara (1848), Jaitpur, Sambalpur (1849), Baghal (1850), Udaipur (Chhattisgarh State) (1852), Jhansi (1854), Nagpur (1854), Tanjore and Arcot (1855). Awadh (1856) is widely believed to have been annexed under the doctrine, but in fact was annexed by Dalhousie under the pretext of mis-governance. Mostly claiming that the ruler was not ruling properly, the Company added about four million pounds sterling to its annual revenue by this doctrine. However, Udaipur State would later have local princely rule reinstated in 1860.

With the increasing power of the East India Company, discontent simmered among many sections of Indian society, included disbanded soldiers; these rallied behind the deposed dynasties during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, also known as the Sepoy Mutiny. Following the rebellion, in 1858, the new British Viceroy of India, whose rule replaced that of the East India Company, renounced the doctrine.

=== Doctrine of lapse before Dalhousie ===
Dalhousie vigorously applied the lapse doctrine for annexing Indian princely states, but the policy was not solely his invention.

The princely state of Kittur, ruled by Kittur Chennamma (the queen at the time), was taken over by the East India Company in 1824, when after the death of her husband and son she adopted a new son and attempted to make him heir to the throne, which the British refused to accept. This development has similarities with the later &#x27;doctrine of lapse&#x27;, which the Court of Directors of the East India Company articulated early in 1834. As per this policy, the Company annexed Mandvi in 1839, Colaba and Jalaun in 1840, and Surat in 1842.

== The impact of the doctrine of lapse ==
The doctrine of lapse was widely considered illegitimate by many Indians. By 1848, the British had immense power in India, since they were the &quot;de facto&quot; direct rulers of territories such as the Madras, Bombay, and Bengal Presidencies, Assam, Mysore, and the Punjab, as well as the indirect rulers of princely states of Rajputana, Sindh, Patiala, the Carnatic, and many others.

Most of the rulers of the remaining states which had not yet been annexed by the British were in a weak position against their mighty forces. Not willing to spend huge amounts of money and soldiers, the Indian rulers had little option but to give in to this policy. This caused increased resentment against the British Empire in India, and was one of the causes of the Uprising of 1857.

==Princely states annexed under the doctrine==

==In independent India==

In late 1964, Maharaja Rajendra Prakash of Sirmur, the last recognized former ruler of Sirmur State, died without either leaving male issue or adopting an heir before his death, although his senior widow subsequently adopted her daughter&#x27;s son as the successor to the family headship. The Indian government, however, decided that in consequence of the ruler&#x27;s death, the constitutional status of the family had lapsed. The doctrine of lapse was likewise invoked the following year when the last recognized ruler of Akkalkot State died in similar circumstances.

<doc id="491343" wikidata="Q2641407" url="?curid=491343" title="UltraSPARC">
<text>The UltraSPARC is a microprocessor developed by Sun Microsystems and fabricated by Texas Instruments, introduced in mid-1995. It is the first microprocessor from Sun to implement the 64-bit SPARC V9 instruction set architecture (ISA). Marc Tremblay was a co-microarchitect.

== Microarchitecture ==

The UltraSPARC is a four-issue superscalar microprocessor that executes instructions in in-order. It includes a nine-stage integer pipeline.

=== Functional units ===

The execution units were simplified relative to the SuperSPARC to achieve higher clock frequencies - an example of a simplification is that the ALUs were not cascaded, unlike the SuperSPARC, to avoid restricting clock frequency.

The integer register file has 32 64-bit entries. As the SPARC ISA uses register windows, of which the UltraSPARC has eight, the actual number of registers is 144. The register file has seven read and three write ports. The integer register file provides registers to two arithmetic logic units and the load/store unit. The two ALUs can both execute arithmetic, logic and shift instructions but only one can execute multiply and divide instructions.

The floating-point unit consists of five functional units. One executes floating point adds and subtracts, one multiplies, one divides and square-roots. Two units are for executing SIMD instructions defined by the Visual Instruction Set (VIS). The floating-point register file contains thirty-two 64-bit registers. It has five read ports and three write ports.

=== Cache ===

The UltraSPARC has two levels of cache, primary and secondary. There are two primary caches, one for instructions and one for data. Both have a capacity of 16 KB.

The UltraSPARC required a mandatory external secondary cache. The cache is unified, has a capacity of 512 KB to 4 MB and is direct-mapped. It can return data in a single cycle. The external cache is implemented with synchronous SRAMs clocked at the same frequency as the microprocessor, as ratios were not supported. It is accessed via the data bus.

== Fabrication ==

It contained 3.8 million transistors. It was fabricated in Texas Instruments&#x27; EPIC-3 process, a 0.5 μm complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) process with four levels of metal. The UltraSPARC was not fabricated in a BiCMOS process as Texas Instruments claimed it did not scale well to 0.5 μm processes and offered little performance improvement. The process was perfected on TI&#x27;s MVP digital signal processor (DSP) with some features missing such as three levels of metal instead of four and a 0.55 feature size, before it was used to fabricate the UltraSPARC to avoid a repeat of the fabrication problems encountered with SuperSPARC.

== Package ==

The UltraSPARC is packaged in a 521-contact plastic ball grid array (PBGA).

<doc id="491351" wikidata="Q3413640" url="?curid=491351" title="Fourth International Posadist">
<text>The Fourth International Posadist is a Trotskyist international organisation. It was founded in 1962 by J. Posadas, who had been the leader of the Latin America Bureau of the Fourth International in the 1950s, and of the Fourth International&#x27;s section in Argentina. Between their split from the International Secretariat of the Fourth International in 1962 and Posadas&#x27; death in 1981, Posadists developed a strain of communism that included several fringe ideas, which brought them into conflict with more mainstream left-wing groups.

Posadism attempts to introduce elements of ufology into Marxist thought. Arguing that only communism can allow the development of interplanetary travel, they concluded that visiting aliens from other planets must live in highly advanced communist societies and are bound to help Earth-based communists with bringing about the world revolution.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
When the Fourth International (FI) split in 1953, Posadas and his followers sided with Michel Pablo and the International Secretariat of the Fourth International (ISFI). The Posadists began quarrelling with the majority of the ISFI in 1959 over the question of nuclear war with Posadas being a proponent as, he claimed, it would destroy capitalism and clear the way for socialism. The Posadists finally split with the ISFI in 1962 to form the Fourth International (Posadist). The group initially had a following in several countries, particularly among railway workers in Cuba, tin workers in Bolivia and farm workers in Brazil.

There was a significant Posadist group in Cuba. Posadist guerrillas fought alongside Castro and Che Guevara in the 1959 revolution. When the Posadists split from the Fourth International in 1962, they took the Cuban section with them, meaning no other Trotskyist group was represented in Cuba in the 1960s.

The Posadist group was accused by Soviet-friendly forces in Cuba of arguing that the Cuban government should forcibly expel the American military base at Guantanamo Bay and of trying to organize workers in the town of Guantánamo to march on the nearby military base. That was taken as a justification by the government for imposing a ban on them, Castro denouncing their influence as &quot;pestilential&quot; at the Tricontinental Conference held in January 1966. Cuban Posadists went on to claim that Castro had Guevara killed when, it turned out, he was actually in Bolivia fighting with the guerrilla movement there. Conversely, after Guevara was executed by Bolivian authorities, Posadas claimed in 1967 that Che Guevara was not actually dead but was being kept in prison by Castro&#x27;s government. By 1968, a Posadist movement began to develop in Europe; however, the ufology elements of the movement caused it to fail to garner much traction.

=== Decline and resurgence ===
In the late 1960s, the Posadists became increasingly interested in UFOs, claiming they were evidence of socialism on other planets. The organization soon began to wane in influence and membership, aided by an increasingly paranoid Posadas who expelled many of its members by 1975.

Posadas&#x27; death in 1981 meant the virtual dissolution of the organization, with only a few isolated groups continuing to operate to the present day. In the United Kingdom, the Revolutionary Workers&#x27; Party (Trotskyist) was founded in 1963 by Posadist members of the Revolutionary Socialist League and despite several schisms and a dwindling membership, it continued to publish its newspaper &quot;Red Flag&quot; until 2000.

In recent years (as of 2018), interests in the Posadists, particularly in regard to their views in ufology, has increased. Several satirical and non-satirical &quot;neo-Posadist&quot; groups emerged on social media, making Posadas &quot;one of the most recognizable names in the history of Trotskyism&quot;.

== Theories ==

=== Posadist society ===
Posadists advocate for a society akin to those proposed by general Marxist theory. A proletarian revolution will destroy the bourgeois state, replacing it with a socialist state.

=== Nuclear first strike ===
At the height of the Cold War, Posadas thought that nuclear war was inevitable. He asserted that the nuclear-armed socialist states should launch a preemptive nuclear attack that would destroy the nuclear capabilities of capitalist countries. Additionally, he believed that a nuclear catastrophe between the United States and USSR would spark the world revolution.

Posadas vocally opposed the Partial Test Ban Treaty signed in 1963 by the United States, the USSR, and the United Kingdom, believing that a nuclear war between the US and the USSR was inevitable and desirable, and would create the conditions for socialism, with the &quot;workers&#x27; states&quot; winning and resetting society.

=== Scientific progress ===
Posadas was highly interested in the way scientific advancement could improve human lives when used for the common good, rather than for profit. In an essay written entitled &quot;Childbearing in space, the confidence of humanity, and Socialism&quot; (1978), he espoused his vision of a Utopian future under the guidance of science:

Posadas was also a supporter of space exploration by the former USSR and the People&#x27;s Republic of China. He praised an alleged plan by the USSR to have a woman give birth in space, considering such endeavors the mark of an advanced society:
These views are in line with the more mainstream positions of Russian cosmism and transhumanism.

=== Ufology ===

Posadas was the author of a number of works with an unconventional slant and towards the end of his life he tried to create a synthesis of Trotskyism and Ufology. His most prominent thesis from this perspective was the 1968 pamphlet &quot;Flying saucers, the process of matter and energy, science, the revolutionary and working-class struggle and the socialist future of mankind&quot; which exposed many of the ideas associated today with Posadism. Here, Posadas claims that while there is no proof of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe, the science of the time makes their existence likely. Furthermore, he claims that any extraterrestrials visiting earth in flying saucers must come from a socially and scientifically advanced civilisation to master inter-planetary travel, and that such a civilisation could have only come about in a post-capitalist world.

Believing visiting aliens to be naturally non-violent and only here to observe, Posadas argues that humans must call on them to intervene in solving the Earth&#x27;s problems, namely &quot;to suppress poverty, hunger, unemployment and war, to give everyone the means to live in dignity and to lay the bases for human fraternity&quot;. The means to achieving this end remained within the mainstream Trotskyist and included ending capitalism as well as the bureaucracy of the workers&#x27; states and establishing a socialist society.

Despite Posadas himself never publishing anything on the subject after 1968, ufology nonetheless became an important part of Posadism. After his death in 1981, some Posadists continued to explore the subject, notably Dante Minazzoli, Paul Schulz, and Werner Grundmann. Others, however, have distanced themselves from the more unconventional notions and have claimed that Posadas&#x27; interest in extraterrestrial life was a marginal point that was blown out of proportions.

== Member parties ==
The Fourth International Posadist claims the following parties as members. It is unknown how many of these organisations still exist or how many members they have. However it is unlikely there are more than a hundred members of the Posadist movement throughout the world. The organization currently lists contacts in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, however only Uruguay has a functioning party.

<doc id="491353" wikidata="Q2389289" url="?curid=491353" title="Occupational injury">
<text>An occupational injury is bodily damage resulting from working. The most common organs involved are the spine, hands, the head, lungs, eyes, skeleton, and skin. Occupational injuries can result from exposure to occupational hazards (physical, chemical, biological, or psychosocial), such as temperature, noise, insect or animal bites, blood-borne pathogens, aerosols, hazardous chemicals, radiation, and occupational burnout.

While many prevention methods are set in place, injuries may still occur due to poor ergonomics, manual handling of heavy loads, misuse or failure of equipment, exposure to general hazards, and inadequate safety training.

==Worldwide==
It has been estimated that worldwide there are more than 350,000 workplace fatalities and more than 270 million workplace injuries annually. In 2000 there were approximately 2.9 billion workers worldwide. Occupational injuries resulted in the loss of 3.5 years of healthy life for every 1,000 workers. 300,000 of the occupational injuries resulted in a fatality.

The most common occupations associated with these hazards vary throughout the world depending on the major industries in a particular country. Overall, the most hazardous occupations are in farming, fishing, and forestry. In more developed countries, construction and manufacturing occupations are associated with high rates of spine, hand, and wrist injuries.

==By country==
===United States===
In the United States in 2012, 4,383 workers died from job injuries, 92% of which were men, and nearly 3 million nonfatal workplace injuries &amp; illness were reported which cost businesses a collective loss of $198.2 billion and 60 million workdays. In 2007, 5,488 workers died from job injuries, 92% of which were men, and 49,000 died from work-related injuries. NIOSH estimates that 4 million workers in the U.S. in 2007 sustained non-fatal work related injuries or illnesses.

Within the U. S. construction industry, the most common work-related fatal injury occurs from worksite falls. Fall prevention is essential. Federal regulations and industry consensus standards provide specific measures and performance-based recommendations for fall prevention and protection. However, persistent unsafe practices and low safety culture across many industries define steady fall injury rates each year. Reducing fall injury and death rates require:

* Implementing new effective fall prevention and protection technologies
* Using appropriate PPE like harnesses, fall guards, and slip-resistant footwear
* Improving the work safety culture by educating the workforce

According to data from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, an average of 15 workers die from traumatic injuries each day in the United States, and an additional 200 workers are hospitalized.

In a study in the state of Washington, injured workers were followed for 14 years to determine the long term effects of work injury on employment. The work injuries resulted in an average of 1.06 years of lost productivity for each of the 31,588 allowed claims.

In 2010, 25% of occupational injuries and illnesses that were not fatal but caused work absences were related to injuries to the upper limb.

====Dangerous sectors====
In the U.S. the Bureau of Labor Statistics makes available extensive statistics on workplace accidents and injuries. For example:


====Common injuries====
As in the United Kingdom, slips, trips and falls (STF) are common and account for 20-40% of disabling occupational injuries. Often these accidents result in a back injury that can persist to a permanent disability. In the United States, a high risk of back injuries occurs in the health care industry. 25% of reported injuries in health care workers in the state of Pennsylvania are for back pain. Among nurses, the prevalence of lower back pain may be as high as 72% mostly as a result of transferring patients. Some of these injuries can be prevented with the availability of patient lifts, improved worker training, and allocation of more time to perform work procedures. Another common type of injury is carpal tunnel syndrome associated with overuse of the hands and wrists. Studies on a cohort of newly hired workers have thus far identified forceful gripping, repetitive lifting of &gt; 1 kg, and using vibrating power tools as high risk work activities.

Additionally, noise exposure in the workplace can cause hearing loss, which accounted for 14% of reported occupational illnesses in 2007. Many initiatives have been created to prevent this common workplace injury. For example, the Buy Quiet program encourages employers to purchase tools and machines that produce less noise and the Safe-In-Sound Award was created to recognize companies and program that excel in the area of hearing loss prevention.

Accidental injection or needlestick injuries are a common injury that plague agriculture workers and veterinarians. The majority of these injuries are located to the hands or legs, and can result in mild to severe reactions, including possible hospitalization. Due to the wide variety of biologics used in animal agriculture, needlestick injuries can result in bacterial or fungal infections, lacerations, local inflammation, vaccine/antibiotic reactions, amputations, miscarriage, and death. Due to daily human-animal interactions, livestock related injuries are also a prevalent injury of agriculture workers, and are responsible for the majority of nonfatal worker injuries on dairy farms. Additionally, approximately 30 people die of cattle and horse-related deaths in the United States annually.

====Employees at risk====

Perhaps the most important personal factor that predisposes to an increased risk is age. In the United States in 1998 17 million workers were over age 55 and by 2018 this population is expected to more than double. Workers in this age group are more likely to develop lower back pain that may be worsened by work conditions that normally do not affect a younger worker. Older workers are also more likely by be killed in a construction related fall. They are also at higher risk for injury due to age-related hearing loss, visual impairment, and use of multiple prescription medications that has been linked to higher rates of work injuries. In addition to age, other personal risk factors for injury include obesity particularly its associated risk with back injury, and depression.

Lack of proper education or training can also predispose an individual to an occupational injury. For example, there is limited needlestick injury awareness among agriculture workers, and there is a need for comprehensive programs to prevent needlestick injuries on livestock operations. Proper animal handling techniques and training, or stockmanship, can also decrease the risk of livestock injury. A handler&#x27;s timing, positioning, speed, direction of movement, and sounds made will affect the behavior of an animal and consequently the safety of the handler. The agriculture industry has begun to focus more on proper education and training, and has made a variety of resources available to producers. For example, organizations like the Upper Midwest Agriculture Safety and Health Center (UMASH) have a variety of informational fact sheets and training videos easily accessible online. Additionally, organizations like Beef Quality Assurance offers stockmanship training seminars and demonstrations.

====Regulation====
In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) sets and enforces national standards for occupational safety across all sectors.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, a total of 111 fatal injuries happened in a single year. According to the HSE, a total of 111 workers died in work related injuries in the UK during 2019–20. The biggest cause for these fatal injuries was falling from heights that alone was responsible for 29 deaths during the same year. Other causes include injuries from moving vehicles and other objects, and contact with the moving machinery.

In the United Kingdom in 2013–2014, 133 people were killed at work. Of those 133 people, 89 were employed, while 44 were self-employed. In 2013–2014, an estimated 629,000 injuries occurred at work. Of these injuries 629,000 injuries, 203,000 led to more than 3 days absence from work. Of these, over 148,000 resulted in them being absent from work for more than 7 days. In the UK, there are workplace injury advice guides online offering support on dealing with occupational injuries injuries.

====Dangerous sectors====
* Construction: 42 deaths
* Agriculture: 27 deaths
* Waste and Recycling: four deaths
* Other: 60 deaths

Of all the workplace accidents that resulted in death, the most common were falls from height, contact with moving machinery and being struck by a vehicle. These types of accidents resulted in over half of all recorded deaths.

====Common injuries====

Slips, trips and falls account for over a third of all injuries that happen at work. Incorrect handling of items was the most common cause of injuries that led to absences from work of more than 7 days. In 2010–2011, injuries to the upper limb injuries made up 47% of non-fatal injuries at work in the UK.

In all, over 1,900,000 working days were lost in 2013–2014 due to slips, trips and falls.

====Employees at risk====

Unsurprisingly, occupation is the biggest influence on the risk of workplace injuries. Workers new to the job are at a much higher risk of injury than more experienced staff, while shift workers and part-time staff also have a greater risk of being injured at work.

The research shows that the amount of time employees worked was strongly linked to muscle and joint issues in the neck, lower back, left elbow, and right wrist.

====Employer prosecutions====
The Health &amp; Safety Executive (HSE) prosecuted 582 cases in 2013–2014, with at least one conviction secured in 547 cases (94%).

Local authorities prosecuted a total of 92 cases during the same period, with at least one conviction achieved in 89 cases (97%).

A total of 13,790 notices were issued by the HSE and local authorities, with over £16,700,000 issued in fines.

===Taiwan===
Traumatic injuries to the upper limbs are the most frequent type of injury at work in Taiwan. In 2010, there were 14,261 occupational injuries recorded in 2010 and 45% of these involved trauma to the upper limbs.

==Prevention==

There are many methods of preventing or reducing industrial injuries, including anticipation of problems by risk assessment, safety training, control banding, personal protective equipment safety guards, mechanisms on machinery, and safety barriers. In addition, past problems can be analyzed to find their root causes by using a technique called root cause analysis. A 2013 Cochrane review found low-quality evidence showing that inspections, especially focused inspections, can reduce work-related injuries in the long term.

<doc id="491357" wikidata="Q191104" url="?curid=491357" title="Sean Bean">
<text>Sean Bean (born Shaun Mark Bean; 17 April 1959) is an English actor. After graduating from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, he made his professional debut in a production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; in 1983 at The Watermill Theatre. Retaining his Yorkshire accent, he first found mainstream success for his portrayal of Richard Sharpe in the ITV series &quot;Sharpe&quot;, which originally ran from 1993 to 1997.

Bean made his film debut in the historical drama &quot;Caravaggio&quot; (1986) and received further attention for his roles in &quot;Stormy Monday&quot; (1988) and &quot;Patriot Games&quot; (1992). He played the main antagonist Alec Trevelyan in the James Bond film &quot;GoldenEye&quot; (1995) and had a supporting role in the action thriller &quot;Ronin&quot; (1998). Bean achieved international recognition for portraying Boromir in the fantasy trilogy &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (2001–2003). Following the success of &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, Bean appeared in a variety of films, including in the science fiction &quot;Equilibrium&quot; (2002), the heist &quot;National Treasure&quot; (2004), Odysseus in the historical war epic &quot;Troy&quot; (2004), the mystery thriller &quot;Flightplan&quot; (2005), the action horror &quot;Black Death&quot; (2010), and the science fiction &quot;The Martian&quot; (2015).

His television roles include the BBC anthology series &quot;Accused&quot; and &quot;Broken&quot;, Ned Stark in the HBO fantasy drama &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, and the ITV historical drama series &quot;Henry VIII&quot; and &quot;Legends&quot;. As a voice actor, Bean has been featured in the video games &quot;The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion&quot;, &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization VI&quot;, and the feature films &quot;Wolfwalkers&quot; and &quot;Mummies&quot; among others. Since 2002, Bean has been the main voiceover for O2 adverts. In 2022, Bean won the British Academy Television Award as Leading Actor in &quot;Time&quot;, a BBC One drama.

==Early life==

Shaun Mark Bean was born in the Handsworth suburb of Sheffield on 17 April 1959, the son of Rita (née Tuckwood) and Brian K. Bean (born 1934). He has a younger sister, Lorraine. His paternal grandfather, Harold Bean Jr. (1914–2001), served in the Royal Navy in the Second World War and was a stud mill labourer who later became a pacifist. His father owned a fabrication company that employed 50 people, including Bean&#x27;s mother, who worked as a secretary. Despite becoming relatively wealthy, the family never moved away from the council estate as they preferred to remain close to friends and family. As a child, Bean smashed a glass door during an argument, which left a piece of glass embedded in his leg that briefly impeded his walking, and left a large scar. This prevented him from pursuing his ambition of playing football professionally.

Bean first attended a local school, Handsworth Junior School, before going to Athelstan School until he was 12, when he went to study at Brook School. In 1975, Bean left Brook Comprehensive School with O levels in Art and English. After a job at a supermarket and another for the local council, he started work at his father&#x27;s firm. Once a week, he attended Rotherham College of Arts and Technology to study welding. While at college, he came upon an art class, and decided to pursue his interest in art. After attending courses at two other colleges, one for half a day and the other for less than a week, he returned to Rotherham College, where he enrolled in a drama course. After some college plays and one at Rotherham Civic Theatre, he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), starting a seven-term course in January 1981.

==Career==
===1983–1994: Early work, &quot;Sharpe&quot;===
Bean graduated from RADA in 1983, making his professional acting debut later that year as Tybalt in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; at the Watermill Theatre in Newbury. His early career involved a mixture of stage and screen work. As an actor, he adopted the Irish spelling of his first name. His first national exposure came in an advert for Barbican non-alcoholic lager. In 1984, he starred in &quot;David and Jonathan&quot; by William Douglas-Home at the Redgrave Theatre in Farnham. Between 1986 and 1988, he was a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company, appearing in productions of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, &quot;The Fair Maid of the West&quot;, and &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. He appeared in his first film, Derek Jarman&#x27;s &quot;Caravaggio&quot; (1986), opposite Tilda Swinton, playing Ranuccio Tomassoni, followed by the same director&#x27;s &quot;War Requiem&quot; (1988). He had the protagonist role in &quot;Stormy Monday&quot; (1988), directed by Mike Figgis. In 1989, he starred as the evil Dominic O&#x27;Brien in &quot;The Fifteen Streets&quot;, where he gained a dedicated following.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Bean became an established actor on British television. In 1990, Bean starred in Jim Sheridan&#x27;s adaptation of the John B. Keane play &quot;The Field&quot;. Also in 1990, his role as the journalist Anton in &quot;Windprints&quot; examined the difficult problems of apartheid in South Africa. He appeared in the BBC productions &quot;Clarissa&quot; (1991) (with Saskia Wickham and Lynsey Baxter) and &quot;Lady Chatterley&quot; (1993) (with Joely Richardson). In 1996, he combined his love of football with his career to finally achieve his childhood dream of playing for Sheffield United, starring as Jimmy Muir in the film &quot;When Saturday Comes&quot;. Although the film was not critically acclaimed, Bean received credit for a good performance. In August 1997, Bean appeared in what became a famous Sky Sports commercial for the upcoming 1997–98 Premier League season. His football-related work continued in 1998 when he narrated &quot;La Coupe de la Gloire&quot;, the official film of the 1998 FIFA World Cup held in France.

Bean&#x27;s critical successes in &quot;Caravaggio&quot; and &quot;Lady Chatterley&quot; contributed to his emerging image as a sex symbol, but he became most closely associated with the character of Richard Sharpe, the maverick Napoleonic Wars rifleman in the ITV television series &quot;Sharpe&quot;. The series was based on Bernard Cornwell&#x27;s novels about the Peninsular War, and the fictional experiences of a band of soldiers in the famed 95th Rifles. Starting with &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Rifles&quot;, the series followed the fortunes and misfortunes of Richard Sharpe as he rose from the ranks as a Sergeant, promoted to Lieutenant in Portugal, to Lieutenant Colonel by the time of the Battle of Waterloo.

Bean was not the first actor to be chosen to play Sharpe. As Paul McGann was injured while playing football two days into filming, the producers initially tried to work around his injury, but it proved impossible and Bean replaced him. The series ran continuously from 1993 to 1997, with three episodes produced each year. It was filmed under challenging conditions, first in Ukraine and later in Portugal. After several years of rumours, more episodes were produced: &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Challenge&quot; (2006) and &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Peril&quot; (2008). Both of these were released as two cinema-length 90-minute episodes per series. With a role as enigmatic Lord Richard Fenton in the TV miniseries &quot;Scarlett&quot;, Bean made the transition to Hollywood feature films. His first notable Hollywood appearance was that of an Irish republican terrorist in the 1992 film adaptation of &quot;Patriot Games&quot;. While filming his death scene, Harrison Ford hit him with a boat hook, giving him a permanent scar. Bean&#x27;s rough-cut looks made him a patent choice for a villain, and his role in &quot;Patriot Games&quot; was the first of several villains that he would portray, all of whom die in gruesome ways.

===1995–2011: &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;===

In the 1995 film &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, Bean portrayed James Bond&#x27;s nemesis Alec Trevelyan (MI6&#x27;s 006). He played the weak-stomached Spence in &quot;Ronin&quot; (1998), a wife-beating ex-con in &quot;Essex Boys&quot; (2000), and a malevolent kidnapper/jewel thief in &quot;Don&#x27;t Say a Word&quot; (2001). He was also widely recognised as villainous treasure hunter Ian Howe in &quot;National Treasure&quot;, and played a villainous scientist in &quot;The Island&quot; (2005). In the independent film &quot;Far North&quot;, he plays a Russian mercenary who gets lost in the tundra and is rescued by an Inuit woman and her daughter, whom he later pits against one another.

Bean&#x27;s most prominent role was as Boromir in Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy. His major screen time occurs in the first instalment, &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;. He appears briefly in flashbacks in &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;, as well as in a scene from the extended edition of &quot;The Two Towers&quot;. Before casting finished, rumours circulated that Jackson had considered Bean for the role of Aragorn, but neither Bean nor Jackson confirmed this in subsequent interviews. Bean&#x27;s fear of flying in helicopters caused him difficulties in mountainous New Zealand, where the trilogy was filmed. After a particularly rough ride, he vowed not to fly to a location again; in one instance, he chose to take a ski lift into the mountains while wearing his full costume (complete with shield, armour, and sword) and then hike the final few miles.

Other roles gave more scope for his acting abilities. In 1999&#x27;s &quot;Extremely Dangerous&quot;, his character walked a fine line between villain and hero. He became a repentant, poetry-reading Grammaton cleric who succumbs to his emotions in 2002&#x27;s &quot;Equilibrium&quot;, a quirky alien cowboy in 2003&#x27;s &quot;The Big Empty&quot;, and a sympathetic and cunning Odysseus in the 2004 film &quot;Troy&quot;. He appeared with other Hollywood stars in Moby&#x27;s music video &quot;We Are All Made of Stars&quot; in February 2002. In the same year, he returned to the stage in London performing in &quot;Macbeth&quot;. Due to popular demand, the production ran until March 2003. In 2005, Bean had sizeable roles in the films &quot;Flightplan&quot; and &quot;North Country&quot;.

Bean has done voice-over work, mostly in the British advertising industry. He has featured in television adverts for O2, Morrisons and Barnardos as well as for Acuvue and the Sci-Fi Channel in the United States. He also does the voice-over for the National Blood Service&#x27;s television and radio campaign. Bean has also filmed a TV ad for Yorkshire Tea, a United Kingdom brand of tea. For the role playing video game, &quot;The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion&quot;, he voiced Martin Septim. Bean&#x27;s distinctive voice has also been used in the intro and outro segments of the BBC Formula 1 racing coverage for the 2011 and 2012 seasons.

Bean completed a one-hour pilot, &quot;Faceless&quot;, for US television. He has also appeared in &quot;Outlaw&quot; (2007), an independent British remake of the 1986 horror film &quot;The Hitcher&quot;; here he used an American accent again. In 2009, he appeared in the &quot;Red Riding&quot; trilogy as the malevolent John Dawson. He also appeared in &quot;Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians: The Lightning Thief&quot; (2010), playing the role of Zeus, the king of Mount Olympus and god of the sky, thunder, and lightning. Also that year, Bean starred in &quot;Cash&quot;, playing the lead role of Pyke Kubic, a dangerous man determined to recover his wealth in a bad economy. &quot;Cash&quot; explored the role money plays in today&#x27;s hard economic times. Bean also played the villain&#x27;s twin brother, Reese. Bean starred in the first season of &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, HBO&#x27;s adaptation of the &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; novels by George R. R. Martin, playing the part of Lord Eddard &quot;Ned&quot; Stark. Bean and Peter Dinklage were the two actors whose inclusion show runners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss considered necessary for the show to become a success, and for whose roles no other actors were considered. His portrayal won him critical praise; as &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; reviewer put it, he &quot;portrayed Ned as a man who knew he lived in the muck but hoped for better and assumed everyone else would come along for the ride.&quot; HBO&#x27;s promotional efforts focused on Bean as the show&#x27;s leading man and best-known actor.

===2012–present: Further film and television roles===
In 2012, Bean appeared in four films: &quot;Soldiers of Fortune&quot;; &quot;Cleanskin&quot;, in which he plays a secret service agent faced with the task of pursuing and eliminating a suicide bomber and his terrorist cell; Tarsem Singh&#x27;s Snow White adaptation, &quot;Mirror Mirror&quot;; and the sequel &quot;Silent Hill: Revelation&quot;, in which he reprised his role as Christopher Da Silva. Also that year, Bean co-starred in the ABC drama series &quot;Missing&quot;, and appeared as cross-dressing teacher Simon in the opening episode of the second season of UK television series &quot;Accused&quot;, a role which would earn him a Royal Television Society best actor award.

Bean starred in the espionage television series &quot;Legends&quot; as Martin Odum, an FBI agent who takes on various fabricated identities to go undercover. The show was canceled after its second season. An intensive viral marketing campaign was centred on the hashtag #DontKillSeanBean, focusing on the various deaths of his past characters and promising his character in &quot;Legends&quot; would not suffer the same fate. The campaign culminated with a Funny or Die exclusive video featuring Bean filming a scene for the show where he&#x27;s become so accustomed to dying on screen that he expects his character to die a bizarrely gruesome death despite the simplicity of the scene.

From 2015 to 2017, Bean starred in the ITV Encore drama series &quot;The Frankenstein Chronicles&quot;. In that time, he also starred in multiple notable films including &quot;Jupiter Ascending&quot;, &quot;Pixels&quot;, and &quot;The Martian&quot;. In 2017, Bean starred in the BBC series &quot;Broken&quot; as the troubled priest Father Michael Kerrigan, which earned him a BAFTA award for Best Actor. In 2019, Bean played a damaged veteran in the TV drama &quot;World on Fire&quot;, basing his interpretation on his late paternal grandfather.

On 31 May 2020, Bean appeared on Josh Gad&#x27;s YouTube series &quot;Reunited Apart&quot; which reunites the cast of popular movies through video-conferencing, and promotes donations to non-profit charities. The episode saw Bean reunited with fellow &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; castmates Sean Astin, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd, Ian McKellen, Dominic Monaghan, Viggo Mortensen, Miranda Otto, John Rhys-Davies, Andy Serkis, Liv Tyler, Karl Urban, and Elijah Wood, plus composer Howard Shore, writer Philippa Boyens and director Peter Jackson.

In 2021, the actor was reunited with Jimmy McGovern (author of &quot;Broken&quot; and &quot;Accused&quot;) and Stephen Graham (his co-star in &quot;Tracie&#x27;s Story&quot;) for the 3-part BBC prison drama &quot;Time&quot;.

Bean starred alongside Nicola Walker in Stefan Golaszewski&#x27;s drama series &quot;Marriage&quot; (2022), which opened to mixed reviews from both critics and viewers.

===Personality===

Bean is often described as &quot;down to earth&quot; and has retained his Yorkshire accent. He says that he does not mind being considered as a &quot;bit of rough&quot; by women. He has developed a reputation as a loner, a label that he considers unfair. He has described himself instead as quiet, and interviewers confirm that he is a &quot;man of few words&quot;, with one interviewer calling him &quot;surprisingly shy&quot;. He admits that he can be a workaholic; he reads books or listens to music in his spare time, and is a skilled pianist. He is also a keen gardener, welder, and sketcher. Popular in his home county, a 2018 poll for Yorkshire Day saw Bean ranked the second greatest Yorkshireman ever behind Monty Python comedian, and fellow Sheffielder, Michael Palin.

===Acting style===
Despite being professionally trained, Bean adopted an instinctive style of acting that some say makes him especially well-suited to portraying his characters&#x27; depths. He has said that the most difficult part is at the start of filming when trying to understand the character. After achieving this, he can snap in and out of character instantly. This ability to go from the quiet man on set to the warrior Boromir &quot;amazed&quot; Sean Astin during filming of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;. Other fans include directors Mike Figgis and Wolfgang Petersen, who described working with Bean as a &quot;beautiful thing&quot;.

===Deaths of characters===
For many years, Bean&#x27;s characters died on screen, a phenomenon that gained notoriety on the internet and in &quot;The Lord of The Rings&quot;, &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; and &quot;James Bond&quot; fandoms and had become an Internet meme. Bean&#x27;s favourite on-screen death is Boromir in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;: &quot;I thought his death was very heroic and triumphant and poignant. It had pathos.&quot; In September 2019, Bean revealed that he had begun turning down roles that would have his character killed because his screen death had become predictable.

==Personal life==
Bean has been married five times and divorced four times. He married his secondary school sweetheart Debra James on 11 April 1981, and they were divorced in 1988. He met actress Melanie Hill at RADA, and they were married on 27 February 1990. Their first daughter was born in October 1987, and their second was born in September 1991. Their marriage ended in divorce in August 1997. During the filming of &quot;Sharpe&quot;, Bean met actress Abigail Cruttenden, and they were married on 22 November 1997. Their daughter was born in November 1998. They were divorced in July 2000. In addition to his three children, Bean has four grandchildren.

Bean began dating actress Georgina Sutcliffe in 2006. After cancelling their planned January 2008 wedding on the eve of the ceremony for &quot;personal reasons&quot;, he married Sutcliffe at the Marylebone Town Hall in London on 19 February 2008. During allegations that Bean physically abused Sutcliffe in 2009, domestic disturbances resulted in the police being called to their home in Belsize Park on three occasions. Bean and Sutcliffe&#x27;s separation was announced on 6 August 2010, and a decree nisi was granted on 21 December 2010. He married Ashley Moore on 30 June 2017.

Bean has been a fan of Sheffield United (the &quot;Blades&quot;) since he was eight years old, and has a tattoo on his left shoulder that reads &quot;100% Blade&quot;. He opened their Hall of Fame in 2001 and, after making a six-figure contribution to the club&#x27;s finances, was on their board of directors between 2002 and 2007 to help raise the profile of the club. He stepped down in 2007 to &quot;go back to being an ordinary supporter&quot; where he feels at home. During his time there, he had a dispute with Neil Warnock, former manager of Sheffield United, after Warnock claimed that Bean stormed into his office and shouted at him in front of his wife and daughter when the club had just been relegated from the Premier League. Bean denies it, calling Warnock &quot;bitter&quot; and &quot;hypocritical&quot;. He wrote the foreword and helped to promote a book of anecdotes called &quot;Sheffield United: The Biography&quot;. He also follows Yorkshire County Cricket Club.

Bean has a tattoo of the number nine on his shoulder, written using Tengwar, in reference to his involvement in the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; films and the fact that his character was one of the original nine companions of the Fellowship of the Ring. Seven of the other actors of &quot;The Fellowship&quot; (Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd, Ian McKellen, Dominic Monaghan, and Viggo Mortensen) have the same tattoo, while John Rhys-Davies, whose character was also one of the original nine companions, arranged for his stunt double to get the tattoo instead.

Aligned with the British left, in 2015 Bean expressed support for Jeremy Corbyn and for &quot;old Labour&quot;, the era before Tony Blair rebranded the party as New Labour; Bean also spoke of his admiration for Tony Benn.

Bean is a Christian and a gardener in his spare time.

==Awards and honours==
In his home city of Sheffield, he has received several honours and acclaims, including an honorary doctorate from Sheffield Hallam University in 1997 and a Doctor of Letters in English Literature from the University of Sheffield in July 2007. He was selected as one of the inaugural members of Sheffield Legends (the Sheffield equivalent of the Hollywood Walk of Fame) and a plaque in his honour has been placed in front of Sheffield Town Hall. Bean commented: &quot;I did get a doctorate from Sheffield Hallam University about 11 or 12 years ago so now I&#x27;m a double doctor. But this was wonderful, especially from my home city.&quot;

<text>The Central Black Earth Region or the Central-Chernozem Region is a segment of the Eurasian Black Earth belt that lies within Central Russia and comprises Voronezh Oblast, Lipetsk Oblast, Belgorod Oblast, Tambov Oblast, Oryol Oblast and Kursk Oblast. Between 1928 and 1934, these regions briefly united as the Central Black Earth Oblast, with the centre in Voronezh.

The Black Earth Region is famous for its high-quality chernozem (Russian for &#x27;black earth&#x27;) soil. Although its importance has been primarily agricultural, the Soviets developed the Chernozem Region as an industrial region based on the iron ores of the Kursk Magnetic Anomaly.

The area contains a biosphere nature reserve called Central Black Earth Nature Reserve (), which was created in 1935 within the Kursk and Belgorod oblasts. A prime specimen of forest steppe in Europe, the nature reserve consists of typical virgin land (целина, &quot;celina&quot;) steppes and deciduous forests.

 was the First Secretary of Communist Party&#x27;s Regional Committee for the Central Black Earth Region (1928–1934).

==History==
On 14 May 1928, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee and Government of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic passed a directive on the formation of the Central Black Earth Oblast using the territory of the former Voronezh, Kursk, Oryol and Tambov Governorate Governorates with its centre as the city of Voronezh.

The composition of the Central Black Earth Oblast was determined on 16 July 1928, and its districts were founded on 30 July of the same year. Later, from 1929 to 1933, these districts were revised several times.

On 3 June 1929, Voronezh, the centre of the region, was designated as an independent administrative unit directly subordinate to the regional Congress of Soviets and its executive committee.

On 16 September 1929, the Voronezh Okrug was abolished, and its territory became the Stary Oskol and Usman Okrugs.

<text>Roy Emerson Stryker (November 5, 1893 – September 27, 1975) was an American economist, government official, and photographer. He headed the Information Division of the Farm Security Administration (FSA) during the Great Depression, and launched the documentary photography program of the FSA. It hired photographers to travel across the United States and document people in different areas and settings as part of showing the state of people in rural areas in those years. Specific projects were conceived to help assess effects of government programs.

He later worked several years on a documentary project for Standard Oil, established the Pittsburgh Photographic Library (PPL), consulted with other companies, and taught photo-journalism at University of Missouri. In his later years he returned to the West, living at last in Colorado.

==Life==
After serving in the infantry in World War I, Stryker went to Columbia University, where he studied economics. He used photography to illustrate his economics texts and lectures. At Columbia, he worked with Rexford Tugwell. When Tugwell became part of Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s Resettlement Administration, Stryker followed him. Tugwell and Stryker refocused the attention of the Resettlement Administration to document the problems of the heartland, and in 1935 Stryker became the head of the Historical Section (Information Division) of the RA. The RA was renamed as the Farm Security Administration, and Stryker set up the photo-documentary project.

Stryker was a manager of the FSA&#x27;s photographic project. The photographers involved attested to his skill in getting good work from them. He ensured that the photographers were well briefed on their assigned areas before being sent out, and that they were properly funded. However, Stryker has been criticized for his destructive editing, as he would sometimes physically deface negatives by punching holes in them. 
&quot;Roy was a little bit dictatorial in his editing and he ruined quite a number of my pictures, which he stopped doing later. He used to punch a hole through a negative. Some of them were incredibly valuable,&quot; photographer and artist Ben Shahn has been quoted saying.

Stryker also made sure that mainstream publications had access to FSA photographs. This both helped focus public attention on the plight of the rural poor and set up the commercial careers of his photographers. Overall, from 164,000 developed negatives, some 77,000 different finished photographic prints were made for the press, plus 644 color images.

Photographers hired by Stryker for the FSA included Dorothea Lange, Arthur Rothstein, Walker Evans, Ben Shahn, John Vachon, Marion Post Wolcott, Russell Lee, Jack Delano, Gordon Parks, John Collier, Carl Mydans, and Edwin and Louise Rosskam.

During World War II, the photographic unit of the FSA was reassigned to the Office of War Information. It was used to produce what was essentially propaganda and disbanded after a year. At the same time, the US Congress disbanded the FSA. The holdings of the FSA&#x27;s photographic unit were transferred to the Library of Congress.

Stryker resigned from the government. He worked for Standard Oil in its public relations documentary project from 1943 to 1950, hiring some of the photographers he had worked with at FSA. 
In selecting photographers for projects at Standard Oil (SO), Stryker sought those who possessed what he described as an 
&quot;insatiable curiosity, the kind that can get to the core of an assignment, the kind that can comprehend what a truck driver, or a farmer, or a driller or a housewife thinks and feels and translate those thoughts and feelings into pictures that can be similarly comprehended by anyone.&quot;

Photographers on the SO project included, among others: Berenice Abbott, Gordon Parks and Todd Webb; as well as Esther Bubley, Harold Corsini, Russell Lee, Arnold S. Eagle, Elliott Erwitt and Sol Libsohn, who would later follow Stryker to his next project in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. After suggesting topics he wanted to be documented, Stryker gave his photographers the freedom to pursue their individual approaches to their subjects. As with all his projects, Stryker was adamant that his staff understand their subjects and their context before going out on an assignment.

From 1950 to 1952, Stryker worked to establish the Pittsburgh Photographic Library (PPL). In 1960, the collection was transferred to the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh.

After leaving the PPL, Stryker directed a documentation project at Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corporation. Thereafter, he accepted consulting jobs on occasion and conducted seminars on photo-journalism at the Journalism School of University of Missouri. Stryker eventually returned to the West in the 1960s. He died in Grand Junction, Colorado.

The Roy Stryker Papers, including manuscripts, correspondence, and vintage prints from the Stryker-directed projects: Farm Security Administration (FSA), the Standard Oil (New Jersey) Co. and Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel, are held in Photographic Archives, Archives and Special Collections, University of Louisville.

<text>Juana Manuela Gorriti Zuviria (15 June 1818 – 6 November 1892) was an Argentine writer with extensive political and literary links to Bolivia and Peru. She held the position of First Lady of Bolivia from 1848 to 1855.

With the publication of &quot;La quena&quot; (1851), Gorriti became recognized as the earliest novelist in what would become Argentina. In &quot;La quena,&quot; Gorriti challenged the notion of poverty, ignorance, tyranny, and the oppression of women, writing, &quot;A day shall come in which man&#x27;s science will discover those treasures; but by then men will be free and equal, and they shall use wealth to serve humanity! The reign of worries and despotism will have ended, and only man&#x27;s genius will rule the world, it reside upon the head of a European, or upon that of an Indian.&quot; Gorriti&#x27;s commitment to women&#x27;s issues sparked the interest of both women and men, including Abel Delgado. His essay, &quot;La educación social de la mujer&quot;, (&quot;The Social Education of Woman,&quot; 1892) discussed male and female spheres and justified women&#x27;s participation in law and politics.

==Biography==
Juana Manuela Gorriti was born on 15 June 1818, in Rosario de la Frontera, in the province of Salta in the north of Argentina. She came from a wealthy upper-class family and attended a convent school when she was eight. She was born to José Ignacio de Gorriti and Feleciana Zuviria. Her father was a politician and soldier, and signed the Argentine Declaration of Independence on 9 July 1816. She was also the niece of the infamous guerrilla . Her family supported the Unitarians during the politically challenging era of Juan Manuel de Rosas, a conservative governor of Buenos Aires Province. In 1831, when Gorriti was thirteen, the federal caudillo Facundo Quiroga forced Gorriti and much of her family into exile.

Goritti&#x27;s family settled in Tarija, Bolivia, where she met her future husband, Manuel Isidro Belzú, who was a captain in the Bolivian Army at the time. They married when she was fifteen, and they had two daughters. As his career advanced, their marriage suffered, and he abandoned her in 1842 after nine years together. Gorriti did not receive the divorce papers until fourteen years later, after his assassination. After her return to Argentina, she died on 6 November 1892, in Buenos Aires at the age of 74.

== Salons ==
In Lima, the coastal city where she lived, she developed a name as an influential journalist and started to host &quot;tertulias&quot; on a regular basis. These salons would be attended by fashionable and mostly well-educated men and women, such as Ricardo Palma and Manuel González Prada, Mercedes Cabello de Carbonera, Clorinda Matto de Turner and Teresa González de Fanning. They would meet to discuss literature and social progress, themes that Gorriti felt passionate about and would include in much of her literature. Her tertulias, often described as salons for the intellectual elite, fostered discussions on literature, politics, and women&#x27;s rights. These gatherings inspired works such as Teresa González de Fanning&#x27;s essays advocating for female education and emancipation, highlighting their significant role in shaping feminist discourse in the region.

By organizing and hosting her &quot;tertulias&quot;, Gorriti provided a great opportunity for female writers to come together and discuss literature, progress, and the progress of women. Many of the attendees would later go on to write more about these subjects, including Teresa González de Fanning, who founded an enlightened women&#x27;s movement.

== Women&#x27;s rights ==
Gorriti was an ardent feminist before the term itself was invented, and her dedication to women&#x27;s rights showed in many of her journals. Through her writings, she instructed and inspired women to take on the gender roles more commonly found in Europe and North America. Through ‘The Argentina Dawn’, Gorriti addressed issues such as women’s access to education and the importance of redefining domestic roles. In her article &#x27;The Future of Women,&#x27; she argued for integrating women into intellectual and public life, advocating for equality through education and social reform. She wanted women to be heard, to educate themselves, and not be afraid to go against social norms. Gorriti redefines domestic spaces as sites of resistance, exploring how women could navigate societal expectations. Her narratives challenge traditional portrayals of gender roles, offering a progressive perspective on women’s autonomy and identity. Gorriti’s narratives frequently explored the intersections of race and gender, shedding light on the layered oppressions faced by women in 19th-century Latin America [7] In works such as ‘El Lucero de Maná’, she portrayed characters navigating societal constraints tied to gender and ethnicity, emphasizing the need for inclusivity in the feminist movement. Gorriti’s works also critiqued societal norms and cultural expectations surrounding women. For instance, in her writings on fashion and societal pressures, Gorriti questioned the emphasis on superficial appearances as a measure of female worth. Her essays often discussed intellectual achievements as the true indicators of women’s progress and emancipation.

== First Lady of Bolivia ==
Manuel Isidoro Belzú, husband to Gorriti, went on to become president of Bolivia in 1848. He survived an assassination attempt two years later and ruled for a further five years until retiring in 1855, having sponsored his son-in-law, Jorge Córdova, to succeed him. Córdova was overthrown in a coup d&#x27;état two years later and was succeeded by José María Linares, who in turn was ousted by his Minister of War, José María de Achá in 1861. Achá survived for three years until replaced, through another coup, by General Mariano Melgarejo. Belzú raised an army against Melgarejo who, according to unconfirmed rumours, invited him to the presidential palace and shot him during a fake embrace. He died on 23 March 1865.

== Battlefield nurse ==
In 1866, the Spanish Navy shelled ports on Peru&#x27;s and Chile&#x27;s coastlines, including the port of Lima, where Gorriti served as a battlefield nurse. Gorriti received a military honor from Peru for her heroic acts of saving injured Peruvian soldiers. She also risked her life evacuating the wounded when the Spanish surrendered at Callao. For her heroism, and Florence Nightingale-like actions, Gorriti was seen as a Peruvian freedom fighter and was awarded the Second Star of May by the Peruvian government. She wrote about these events in numerous articles and short stories, later collected and published in the &quot;Album of Lima&quot; founded by herself and her friend and fellow writer Carolina Freyre de Jaimes.

== Return to Argentina ==
In 1878, Gorriti returned to Argentina. Despite facing challenges such as divorce and exile, Gorriti remained a respected and influential figure, celebrated for her literary and social contributions. Gorriti became a mother to two daughters, Edelmira Belzu and Mercedes Belzu de Dorado. Her daughter Mercedes became sick in Peru in 1879, but Gorriti could not go to her because of the war between Chile and Peru over the provinces of Tacna and Arica. Mercedes died later that year. Gorriti also founded the newspaper &quot;The Argentina Dawn&quot;, in which she published many articles on the rights and education of women. When she died, Argentines hailed her as a famous, instructive, influential journalist of her day.

== Literary contributions ==
Gorriti left Bolivia for Peru, where her literary life would take off. When she initially arrived in Peru she had no financial support or resources. Gorriti founded an all-girls school in Bolivia, where she dedicated her life to teaching and writing. She was an ardent feminist, and it showed in many of her journals. Gorriti wrote several short novels and numerous short stories. Her novels include &quot;El Pozo de Yocci&quot; (&quot;The Yocci Well&quot;), a love story, ghost story and Gothic horror rolled into one, set in one of the most critical periods in the history of the Argentine Republic, contrasting the idealistic patriotism behind the War of Independence with the savagery of the civil wars that followed. This was followed by &quot;La oasis de la vida&quot; (&quot;The Oasis of Life&quot;), a melodramatic novel written in the 1880s. &quot;La tierra natal&quot; (&quot;The Native Land&quot;), her last major work, published in 1889, relates a physical journey through northern Argentina, back to the places where she had lived over the course of her lifetime, as well as a voyage back through her memories of the people and events she had known and experienced along the way.

Two of her most famous short stories are &quot;La hija del mazorquero&quot; and &quot;El lucero de manantial&quot;; both are melodramatic tales with a strong anti-Rosista political message. These are powerful examples of how literature intertwines with political critique. Both works are set in melodrama, a hallmark of Gorriti&#x27;s style, and serve as allegories for Argentina&#x27;s national identity during the controversial regime of Juan Manuel de Rosas (1829–1852).

In &quot;La hija del mazorquero&quot;, Gorriti critiques the brutal methods and authoritarian governance associated with Rosas, particularly through the depiction of characters tied to the &quot;mazorca&quot; (Rosas&#x27; secret police). Similarly, &quot;El lucero de manantial&quot; uses symbolic imagery and dramatic narrative to show the corruption under Rosas&#x27; rule. Gorriti was not only a literary figure but also a voice of resistance.

Gorriti also founded the newspaper &quot;The Dawn of Argentina&quot; (&quot;La Alborada del Plata&quot;) with fellow poet Numa Pompilio Llona.

Her intermittent three-year stay in Lima resulted in the publication of &quot;La Quena&quot;, a short but influential novella, in the prestigious newspaper &quot;El Comercio&quot;. Later, as Peruvian politics began to stabilize, she contributed to the &quot;Revista de Lima&quot; with stories like &quot;El Angel Caido&quot; and &quot;Si haces mal no esperes bien&quot;.

Gorriti&#x27;s stories are finely crafted and bear witness to trends in South American literature of the 19th century.

<text>Tan Dun (, ; born 18 August 1957) is a Chinese-born American composer and conductor. A leading figure of contemporary classical music, he draws from a variety of Western and Chinese influences, a dichotomy which has shaped much of his life and music. Having collaborated with leading orchestras around the world, Tan is the recipient of numerous awards, including a Grawemeyer Award for his opera &quot;Marco Polo&quot; (1996) and both an Academy Award and Grammy Award for his film score in Ang Lee&#x27;s &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; (2000). His &quot;oeuvre&quot; as a whole includes operas, orchestral, vocal, chamber, solo and film scores, as well as genres that Tan terms &quot;organic music&quot; and &quot;music ritual.&quot;

Born in Hunan, China, Tan grew up during the Cultural Revolution and received musical education from the Central Conservatory of Music. His early influences included both Chinese music and 20th-century classical music. Since receiving a DMA from Columbia University in 1993, Tan has been based in New York City. His compositions often incorporate audiovisual elements; use instruments constructed from organic materials, such as paper, water, and stone; and are often inspired by traditional Chinese theatrical and ritual performance. In 2013, he was named a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador.

==Biography==
Tan Dun was born in 1957 in a village in Changsha in Hunan, China. As a child, he was fascinated by the rituals and ceremonies of the village shaman, which were typically set to music made with natural objects such as rocks and water. Due to the bans enacted during the Cultural Revolution, he was discouraged from pursuing music and was sent to work as a rice planter on the Huangjin commune. He joined an ensemble of other commune residents and learned to play traditional Chinese string instruments. Following a ferry accident that resulted in the death of several members of a Peking opera troupe, Tan Dun was called upon as a violist and arranger. This initial success earned him a seat in the orchestra, and from there he went to study at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing in 1977. While at the Conservatory, Tan Dun came into contact with composers such as Toru Takemitsu, George Crumb, Alexander Goehr, Hans Werner Henze, Isang Yun, and Chou Wen-Chung, all of whom influenced his sense of musical style.

In 1986, he moved to New York City as a doctoral student at Columbia University, once again studying with Chou Wen-Chung, who had studied under Edgard Varèse. At Columbia, Tan Dun discovered the music of composers such as Philip Glass, John Cage, Meredith Monk, and Steve Reich, and began incorporating these influences into his compositions. He completed his dissertation, &quot;Death and Fire: Dialogue with Paul Klee&quot;, in 1993. Inspired by a visit to the Museum of Modern Art, &quot;Death and Fire&quot; is a short symphony that engages with the paintings of Paul Klee. On 15 June 2016, he created the Grand Opening Theme Song of Shanghai Disney Resort. On 1 August 2019 he was appointed as dean of the Bard College Conservatory of Music.

==Music==
===Opera===

During his time at Columbia University, Tan Dun composed his first opera, a setting of nature poems by Qu Yuan called &quot;Nine Songs&quot; (1989). The poems are sung in both Classical Chinese and contemporary English alongside a small ensemble of Western and Chinese instruments. Among these are a specially built set of 50 ceramic percussion, string, and wind instruments, designed in collaboration with potter Ragnar Naess. To emphasize the shamanistic nature of Qu Yuan&#x27;s poetry, the actors dance and move in a ritualized manner.

Tan Dun&#x27;s second work in the genre, &quot;Marco Polo&quot; (1996), set to a libretto by Paul Griffiths, is an opera within an opera. It begins with the spiritual journey of two characters, Marco and Polo, and their encounters with various historic figures of literature and music, including Dante Alighieri, William Shakespeare, Scheherazade, Sigmund Freud, John Cage, Gustav Mahler, Li Po, and Kublai Khan. These sections are presented in an abstract, Peking opera style. Interwoven with these sections are the travels of the real-life Marco Polo, presented in a Western operatic style. Though the score calls for traditional Western orchestral instrumentation, additional instruments are used to indicate the location of the characters, including recorder, rebec, sitar, tabla, singing bowls, Tibetan horn, sheng, and pipa. The opera won the Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition in 1998.

That same year, Tan Dun premiered his next opera, &quot;The Peony Pavilion&quot;, an adaptation of Tang Xianzu&#x27;s 1598 Kunqu play of the same name. Directed by Peter Sellars in its original production, Tan Dun&#x27;s work is performed entirely in English, though one of the characters must be trained in Peking or Kunqu style. The small ensemble of six musicians performs electronics and Chinese instruments onstage with the actors. Stylistically, the music is a blend of Western avant-garde and Chinese opera.

At this point in his career, Tan Dun had created many works for &quot;organic instruments,&quot; i.e. instruments constructed from materials such as paper, water, ceramic, and stone. For his fourth opera, &quot;Tea: A Mirror of Soul&quot; (2002), co-authored by librettist Xu Ying, organic instruments factor prominently into the structure of the opera itself. The title of each act corresponds to the materials of the instruments being used, as well as the opera&#x27;s plot. The first act, entitled &quot;Water, Fire&quot;, opens with a tea ceremony onstage while percussionists manipulate glass bowls of water. The second act, &quot;Paper&quot;, features music on rice paper drums and depicts the characters&#x27; search for &quot;The Classic of Tea&quot;, the first book to codify tea production and preparation in China. The third and final act, &quot;Ceramic, Stones&quot;, depicts the death of the protagonist&#x27;s love. Percussionists play on pitched flowerpots, referred to as &quot;Ceramic chimes&quot; in the score.

Tan Dun&#x27;s most recent opera, &quot;The First Emperor&quot; (2006), was commissioned by the Metropolitan Opera with the title role created for Plácido Domingo. Co-authored by Tan Dun and Chinese novelist Ha Jin, the opera focuses on the unification of China under Qin Shi Huang, first emperor of the Qin dynasty, and his relationship with the musician Gao Jianli. Like Tan Dun&#x27;s previous operas, &quot;The First Emperor&quot; calls for Chinese instruments in addition to a full orchestra, including guzheng and bianzhong. The original Met production was directed by Zhang Yimou, with whom Tan Dun had collaborated on the film &quot;Hero&quot;.

===Film and multimedia===
Tan Dun earned more widespread attention after composing the score for Ang Lee&#x27;s &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; (2000), for which he won an Academy Award, a Grammy Award, and a BAFTA Award. Other film credits include the aforementioned &quot;Hero&quot; (Zhang Yimou, 2002), Gregory Hoblit&#x27;s &quot;Fallen&quot; (1998), and Feng Xiaogang&#x27;s &quot;The Banquet&quot; (2006).

Following the composition of the film score for &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;, Tan Dun rearranged the music to create the &quot;Crouching Tiger Concerto&quot; for cello, video, and chamber orchestra. Containing edited footage from the film, this work reverses the role of music in film by treating video as secondary. This same technique was later applied to his film scores for &quot;Hero&quot; and &quot;The Banquet&quot;, resulting in the larger work known as the &quot;Martial Arts Cycle&quot;.

In 2002, Tan Dun continued experimenting with application of video in music &quot;The Map&quot;, also for cello, video, and orchestra. &quot;The Map&quot; features documentary footage depicting the lives of China&#x27;s Tujia, Miao, and Dong ethnic minorities. The musicians onstage, including the cello soloist, interact with the musicians onscreen—a duet of live and recorded performance. The work was premiered and commissioned by the Boston Symphony Orchestra with Yo-Yo Ma.

Tan Dun&#x27;s most recent multimedia work, &quot;Nu Shu: The Secret Songs of Women&quot; (2013), is a 13-movement work for video, solo harp, and orchestra. Following years of ethnomusicological research in Hunan, the work captures the sounds of Nüshu script, a phonetic writing system devised by women speakers of the Xiangnan Tuhua dialect who had been disallowed from receiving formal education. Considered a dying language, Tan Dun&#x27;s research resulted in a series of short films of women singing songs written in Nüshu, which are presented alongside the orchestral performance. As with &quot;The Map&quot;, the songs in the video are used in counterpoint to the live music.

===&quot;Orchestral Theatre&quot; series===
In the 1990s, Tan Dun began working on a series of orchestral pieces that would analyze the relationship between performer and audience by synthesizing Western classical music and Chinese ritual. According to the composer, If we look at the idea of &#x27;art music&#x27; with its firm separation of performer and audience, we see that its history is comparatively short. Yet the history of music as an integral part of spiritual life, as ritual, as partnership in enjoyment and spirit, is as old as humanity itself.

In the first piece of the series, &quot;Orchestral Theatre I: O&quot; (1990), members of the orchestra make various vocalizations—chanting nonsense syllables, for instance—while playing their instruments using atypical techniques. For examples, the harp is played as a gushing, and the violins are played as percussion instruments.

&quot;Orchestral Theatre II: Re&quot; (1992) expands the concept of ritual by involving the audience. The orchestra is split, with the strings, brass, and percussion onstage, while the woodwinds surround the audience. The score also calls for two conductors, with one facing the stage, and the other facing the audience. The latter conductor cues the audience to hum along with the orchestra in certain sections of the music. The work&#x27;s namesake derives from humming the solfège pitch &quot;re&quot;.

The third piece in the series, &quot;Red Forecast (Orchestral Theatre III)&quot; (1996), involves more staging elements than its predecessors, adding television monitors, lighting, and even stage directions for the musicians. In this multimedia work, the orchestra is led by both a human conductor and a virtual conductor who appears on the monitors. While the human conductor leads, the monitors depict a variety of images from the 1960s and the Cold War: a collage of Mao Zedong, the Cultural Revolution, Martin Luther King Jr., John F. Kennedy, The Beatles, Nikita Khrushchev, and hydrogen bomb testing. In addition to the video, an audio recording of a weather forecast is played.

The final piece in the series, &quot;The Gate (Orchestral Theatre IV)&quot; (1999), focuses on three women of literary fame: Yu from &quot;The Hegemon-King Bids His Concubine Farewell&quot;, Juliet from &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, and Koharu from &quot;The Love Suicides at Amijima&quot;. Based on the theme of sacrifice for love, &quot;The Gate&quot; is structured as a theme and variations. The style of each section corresponds to its respective character&#x27;s country of origin. Additionally, Yu is played by a Peking opera singer (Shi Min), Juliet by a Western opera soprano (Nancy Allen Lundy), and Koharu by a Japanese puppeteer (Jusaburō Tsujimura). As in &quot;Orchestra Theatre II: Re&quot;, the orchestra is distributed onstage and amongst the audience. &quot;The Gate&quot; also incorporates video, but unlike the prerecorded images used in &quot;Red Forecast&quot;, a projection screen displays live images of the three actress-soloists, manipulated in real time by a video artist. The video artist for the 1999 premiere was Elaine J. McCarthy.

===Organic music===
Many of Tan Dun&#x27;s works call for instruments made of materials such as paper, stone, or water, but the compositions that he classifies as &quot;organic music&quot; feature these instruments most prominently. The first major work for organic instruments was his &quot;Water Concerto for Water Percussion and Orchestra&quot; (1998), dedicated to Toru Takemitsu. According to the composer, the sounds made by the soloist are inspired by the sounds of everyday life growing up in Hunan. Basins are filled with water, and the contents are manipulated with bowls, bottles, hands, and other devices. Other water instruments used include the waterphone. Various means of amplification are used, including contact microphones on the basins.

The techniques devised in the &quot;Water Concerto&quot; were used again in Tan Dun&#x27;s &quot;Water Passion After St. Matthew&quot; (2000). Written to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the death of Johann Sebastian Bach, the work for chorus, orchestra, and water percussion follows the Gospel of Matthew, beginning with Christ&#x27;s baptism. The chorus doubles on tingsha, and the soprano and bass soloists double on xun. The score also requires Mongolian overtone singing from the soloists. As with &quot;Orchestral Theatre I: O&quot;, members of the orchestra play their instruments with techniques borrowed from non-Western traditions.

Tan Dun&#x27;s next major organic work, &quot;Paper Concerto for Paper Percussion and Orchestra&quot; (2003), explores the acoustic range of paper. Instruments constructed from differing thicknesses of paper are used as cymbals, drums, or reeds. Additionally, sheets of paper are shaken or struck. These sounds are amplified primarily through wireless microphones worn by the musicians. This work was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic for the opening of the Walt Disney Concert Hall.

&quot;Earth Concerto for stone and ceramic percussion and orchestra&quot; (2009) draws from Gustav Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Das Lied von der Erde (The Song of the Earth)&quot;, which in turn draws from the poetry of Li Po. Ceramic instruments include percussion instruments similar to those Tan Dun had used in previous works, as well as wind instruments and xun.

===Symphonies, concertos, and chamber works===
In the mid-1990s, Tan Dun began working on another series of orchestral works known as the &quot;Yi&quot; series, named for the &quot;I Ching&quot; (Yi Jing in pinyin). Each numbered work in the series builds upon the original, &quot;Yi°: Concerto for Orchestra&quot; (published 2002), by adding a solo instrument. The first concerto in the series, &quot;Yi1: Intercourse of Fire and Water&quot; (1994), was written for and premiered by cellist Anssi Karttunen. The second work, &quot;Yi2: Concerto for Guitar and Orchestra&quot; (1996), combines flamenco and pipa techniques and was premiered by Sharon Isbin.

Originally titled &quot;Secret Land&quot;, Tan Dun wrote a concerto for 12 solo cellos and orchestra called &quot;Four Secret Roads of Marco Polo&quot; (2004). Commissioned and premiered by the Berlin Philharmonic, the work is a musical exploration of the Silk Road. To achieve these sounds, the cello soloists employ sitar and pipa techniques.

Tan Dun wrote a concerto for Lang Lang titled &quot;Piano Concerto: &quot;The Fire&quot;&quot; (2008), a commission by the New York Philharmonic. The concerto is reportedly inspired by the composer&#x27;s love for martial arts, and the soloist is instructed to play certain passages of the music with fists and forearms. Other more tranquil sections evoke ancient Chinese instruments such as the guqin.

In 2008, Tan Dun was commissioned by Google and YouTube to write an inaugural symphony for the YouTube Symphony Orchestra (YTSO) project. The resultant work, Internet Symphony No. 1 &quot;Eroica&quot;, was recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra and uploaded to YouTube in November 2008, thus beginning the open call for video audition submissions. Voted on by members of the YouTube community as well as professional musicians, the YTSO was assembled of 96 musicians from over 30 countries. In April 2009, a mashup video of the submissions was premiered at Carnegie Hall, followed by a live performance of the work.

Tan Dun has also conducted the BBC Scottish Symphony to record parts of the album &quot;Away from Xuan&quot; by fellow composer Chen Yuanlin, released in 2009.

He composed a symphonic poem for piano for pianist Yuja Wang titled &quot;Farewell My Concubine for Peking Opera Soprano and Piano&quot;.

The work was commissioned by Guangzhou Symphony Orchestra and made its world premiere on 31 July 2015 in Xinghai Concert Hall with the orchestra conducted by Long Yu and Wang as piano soloist.

===Theatre-inspired works===
Though not explicitly opera, many of Tan Dun&#x27;s works borrow operatic elements, in terms of both melody and staging. For example, his violin concerto, &quot;Out of Peking Opera&quot; (1987, revised 1994), quotes jinghu fiddling music often heard in Peking opera. Additionally, &quot;Ghost Opera&quot; (1994), for pipa and string quartet, includes minimal sets and lighting. Originally composed on commission for Kronos Quartet and Wu Man, &quot;Ghost Opera&quot; has been performed globally and recorded by Kronos for Nonesuch Records.

<text>Chernozem ( ), also called black soil, regur soil or black cotton soil, is a black-colored soil containing a high percentage of humus (4% to 16%) and high percentages of phosphorus and ammonia compounds. Chernozem is very fertile soil and can produce high agricultural yields with its high moisture-storage capacity. Chernozems are a Reference Soil Group of the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB).

== Distribution ==

The name comes from the Russian terms for black (чёрный &quot;čjornyj&quot;) and soil, earth or land (земля &quot;zemlja&quot;). The soil, rich in organic matter presenting a black color, was first identified by the Russian geologist Vasily Dokuchaev in 1883 in the tallgrass steppe or prairie of Eastern Ukraine and Western Russia.

Chernozem covers about 230 million hectares of land. There are two &quot;chernozem belts&quot; in the world. One is the Eurasian steppe that extends from eastern Croatia (Slavonia), along the Danube (northern Serbia, northern Bulgaria (Danubian Plain), southern and eastern Romania (Wallachian Plain and Moldavian Plain), and Moldova, to northeast Ukraine across the Central-Chernozem Strip of Central and Southern Russia into Siberia. The other stretches from the Canadian Prairies in Manitoba through the Great Plains of the United States as far south as Kansas. 

Chernozem layer thickness may vary widely, from several centimetres up to 1.5 metres (60 inches) in Ukraine, as well as the Red River Valley region in the northern United States and Canada (location of the prehistoric Lake Agassiz).

The terrain can also be found in small quantities elsewhere (for example, in 1% of Poland, Hungary, and Texas). It also exists in Northeast China, near Harbin. The only true chernozem in Australia is located around Nimmitabel, some of the richest soils on the continent.

Previously, there was a black market for the soil in Ukraine. The sale of agricultural land was illegal in Ukraine from 1992 to 2020, but the soil, transported by truck, could be traded legally. According to the Kharkiv-based Green Front NGO, the black market for illegally acquired chernozem in Ukraine was projected to reach approximately US$900 million per year in 2011.

== Canadian and United States soil classification ==
Chernozemic soils are a soil type in the Canadian system of soil classification and the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB).

Chernozemic soil type &quot;equivalents&quot;, in the Canadian system, WRB, and U.S. Department of Agriculture soil taxonomy:

== Theories of Chernozem origin ==
* 1761: Johan Gottschalk Wallerius (plant decomposition) 
* 1763: Mikhail Lomonosov (plant and animal decomposition)
* 1799: Peter Simon Pallas (reeds marsh)
* 1835: Charles Lyell (loess)
* 1840: Sir Roderick Murchison (weathered from Jurassic marine shales) 
* 1850: Karl Eichwald (peat) 
* 1851: А. Petzgold (swamps)
* 1852: Nikifor Borisyak (peat)
* 1853: Vangengeim von Qualen (silt from northern swamps) 
* 1862: Rudolf Ludwig (bog on place of forests)
* 1866: Franz Josef Ruprecht (decomposed steppe grasses) 
* 1879: First chernozem papers translated from Russian 
* 1883: Vasily Dokuchaev published his book &quot;Russian Chernozem&quot; with a complete study of this soil in European Russia.
* 1929: Otto Schlüter (man-made)
* 1999: Michael W. I. Schmidt (neolithic biomass burning)

As seen in the list above, the 19th and 20th-century discussions on the pedogenesis of Chernozem originally stemmed from climatic conditions from the early Holocene to roughly 5500 BC. However, no single paleo-climate reconstruction could accurately explain geochemical variations found in Chernozems throughout central Europe. Evidence of anthropomorphic origins of stable pyrogenic carbon in Chernozem led to improved formation theories. Vegetation burning could explain Chernozem&#x27;s high magnetic susceptibility, the highest of the major soil types. Soil magnetism increases when soil minerals goethite and ferrihydrite convert to maghemite on exposure to heat. Temperatures sufficient to elevate maghemite on a landscape scale indicate the influence of fire. Given the rarity of such natural phenomena in the modern day, magnetic susceptibility in Chernozem likely relates to control of fire by early humans.

Humification can darken soils (melanization) absent a pyrogenic carbon component. Given the symphony of pedogenic processes that contribute to the formation of dark earth, Chernozem summarizes different types of black soils with the same appearance but different formation histories.

<doc id="491379" wikidata="Q4743513" url="?curid=491379" title="American Computer Science League">
<text>ACSL, or the American Computer Science League, is an international computer science competition among more than 300 schools. Originally founded in 1978 as the Rhode Island Computer Science League, it then became the New England Computer Science League. With countrywide and worldwide participants, it became the American Computer Science League. It has been in continuous existence since 1978. 
Each yearly competition consists of four contests. All students at each school may compete but the team score is the sum of the best 3 or 5 top scores. Each contest consists of two parts: a written section (called &quot;shorts&quot;) and a programming section. Written topics tested include &quot;what does this program do?&quot;, digital electronics, Boolean algebra, computer numbering systems, recursive functions, data structures (primarily dealing with heaps, binary search trees, stacks, and queues), Lisp programming, regular expressions and finite-state automata, bit string flicking, graph theory, assembly programming and prefix/postfix/infix notation.

==Divisions==
There are five divisions in ACSL: Elementary, Classroom, Junior, Intermediate, and Senior. The Elementary Division is a non-programming competition for grades 3 - 6. It tests one topic per contest. The Classroom Division is a non-programming competition for all grades and consists of a 10 question test on 4 topics each contest. Junior Division is recommended for middle school students (no students above the ninth grade may compete in it). Intermediate and Senior Divisions are for secondary school students, Intermediate being easier and Senior being more difficult. At the All-Star Contest, the Junior teams consist of 5 members each while the Senior and Intermediate teams can consist of 3 or 5 members. Each team competes against other same-sized teams in its division.

==Regular season==
The Regular Season, in which individual students compete to get their school team qualified for the All-Star Contest, consists of four rounds. These rounds consist of a programming part and a written part. In the programming part, students have 72 hours to complete a program in any computer language to perform the given task. In the written part, students have a total of 30 minutes to answer 5 questions based on given topics. Students then receive a score of up to 10 points (5 for written and 5 for programming). For the Classroom Division, students receive 45 minutes to solve 10 written problems. For the Elementary Division, students have 30 minutes to solve 5 written problems. Prizes are awarded to top scoring teams and students based upon cumulative scores after the fourth contest.

==Finals contest==
The Finals Contest is held online on the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend each year. Top students are invited to participate in the contest. Students in the Junior, Intermediate, and Senior divisions start in the morning with a 3-hour block in which to solve 2 programming problems. All divisions have a one-hour quiz (20 multiple choice questions) on topics that are covered in the written questions in the Regular Season rounds. The scores of the programming and theory sections are added together to determine the winners in each division.

<doc id="491380" wikidata="Q5298869" url="?curid=491380" title="Dorset Street, Dublin">
<text>Dorset Street (; &quot;Sráid Dorset&quot; in Irish) is an important thoroughfare on the north side of Dublin, Ireland, and was originally part of the &quot;Slighe Midh-Luchra&quot;, Dublin&#x27;s ancient road to the north that begins where the original bridging point at Church Street is today. Subsequently, yet prior to the street being given its current name in the 18th century, the road was known as &quot;Drumcondra Lane&quot; and was shown on maps as such. It is divided into Dorset Street Lower (northeast end) and Dorset Street Upper (southwest end).

==Location and layout==

The street runs northeast from Abbey Street and Bolton Street at Dominick Street junction, north of Parnell Square and Mountjoy Square, and leads into Drumcondra Road at Binn&#x27;s Bridge on the Royal Canal. It makes up part of the most common route from Dublin Airport to the city centre, and the R132 regional road follows Dorset Street for part of its route. It meets the R135 route at the junctions with Blessington Street, location of the Blessington Street Basin, and St. Mary&#x27;s Place; other major roads feeding onto this spine street include North Circular Road, Gardiner Street, Eccles Street, North Frederick Street, and Granby Row.

Physically the street rises up from the Liffey valley at its southwestern end to its apex at roughly where it meets with Blessington and North Frederick Streets; proceeding north-west the street slopes down again on the approach to Binn&#x27;s Bridge at the Royal Canal.

Some early Georgian houses are dotted along the street, primarily identifiable by the stone Gibbsian doorcase entrances, and close to the crossroads with Blessington and North Frederick Streets. Much of the street redeveloped during the Victorian era, with a number of significant buildings built, such as the Gothic style stone-built Dominican priory, designed by J. L. Robinson in 1884–87 at the corner of Dominick Street, while across from it is the red brick Italianate former fire station, designed by C. J. McCarthy and completed in 1903. Much of the street consists of vernacular Victorian terraces, with shops opening straight onto footpaths at ground-floor level.

During the latter part of the twentieth century, stretches of the street were again redeveloped by Dublin Corporation for social housing flat complexes near Dominick Street.

== Naming and pronunciation ==
Until 1728, the street was marked on maps as Drumcondra Lane. Dorset Street was named after Lionel Cranfield Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1756. While the English county of Dorset is pronounced with the first syllable stressed, &quot;Dorset Street&quot; is pronounced locally (by Northsiders) as Street, with emphasis on the second syllable of &quot;Dorset&quot;.

== History ==

=== St. Joseph&#x27;s Place Housing Scheme ===
St Joseph&#x27;s Place housing scheme has been in planning for many years, which date back as far as 1896. The scheme contained 80 units, with a high density of 30 dwellings per acre. The area named &quot;White&#x27;s Lane&quot; required major improvements, as the houses were simply inhabitable by means of spatial planning, cleanliness, conveniences, sanitization and many more basic human needs that were desperately needed. Hence under the Housing of the Working Class Act, 1890, the improvement scheme for this area was published in October, but by June there was still only partial approval for the loan in order to commence construction. This was due to the displacement of tenants during this time who were sent to areas such as Lurgan Street, Linenhall Street, and Church Street but would not stay in these areas during the construction period for various reasons such as costs and poor sanitation in the houses, and the following year, tenants then began to request compensation for their displacement.

The scheme was then outlined by the City surveyor, Mr Harty, who proposed that the land be completely cleared and constructed an entirely new scheme. This plan consisted of the construction of 80 cottages. Each of them is to be one storey high, and a site to construct a boys&#x27; national school. This scheme came to life in July 1896 and has not greatly changed since. St. Joseph&#x27;s Place still consists of these classic one-storey cottages.

== Historic residents ==
* Irish author Seán O&#x27;Casey and Irish dramatist and educator Thomas Sheridan were born on this street.
* Seán O&#x27;Casey was born at number 85, since demolished and replaced by a branch of the Bank of Ireland (now disused), his family having previously occupied numbers 6 and 23½ before moving there. At the time, the street was considered to be a reasonably fashionable location in Dublin.
* Playwright, Westminster Parliament member, and son of Thomas, Richard Brinsley Sheridan was born on this street at number 12 in 1751; Brinsley Sheridan&#x27;s works include &quot;The Critics&quot; and &quot;A School for Scandal&quot;.
* No 16 - &quot;site of&quot; - was the residence of United Irishman Napper Tandy in 1779
* No 68 - &quot;site of&quot; - home to Peadar Kearney (1883–1942); Songwriter and author of the national anthem, &quot;The Soldier&#x27;s Song&quot;, also known in Irish as Amhrán na bhFiann. Kearney was born at this address, and by trade became a house painter and theatre set decorator, as too did his more famous nephew, the playwright Brendan Behan, who also lived nearby at Russell Street.

==Today==

The street has been improved at its northern end with new trees and lighting in the 2010s. A Maldron hotel was built in conjunction with Senator Donie Cassidy now sits on the site of the former National Wax Museum (and before that Plaza Cinema and Bethesda Chapel). Road engineering by Dublin City Council, designed primarily to facilitate cars. The street features a number of pubs, including Joxer Daly&#x27;s, as referenced by Seán O&#x27;Casey in &quot;Juno and the Paycock&quot;, fast food outlets, an assortment of small retail units, and apartments and small offices.

The Dorest Street flats on Upper Dorset Street were demolished in October 2024 to make way for a redevelopment of the site for more social housing. The majority of the flats had been vacant for a decade and had attracted anti-social behaviour.

<doc id="491386" wikidata="Q324744" url="?curid=491386" title="Fiat G.91">
<text>The Fiat G.91 is a jet fighter aircraft designed and built by the Italian aircraft manufacturer Fiat Aviazione, which later merged into Aeritalia.

The G.91 has its origins in the NATO-organised NBMR-1 competition started in 1953, which sought a light fighter-bomber (officially, the competition was seeking a &quot;Light Weight Strike Fighter&quot;) to be adopted as standard equipment across the air forces of the various NATO nations. The G.91 was specifically designed to fulfil the requirements of this competition, being relatively lightweight and capable of operating from austere airstrips while also being armoured and suitably armed while remaining relatively affordable in comparison to many frontline fighters. On 9 August 1956, the prototype conducted its maiden flight. After reviewing multiple submissions, the G.91 was picked as the winning design of the NBMR-1 competition.

During 1961, the G.91 entered into operational service with the Italian Air Force, and with the West German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; in the following year. Various other nations adopted it, such as the Portuguese Air Force, who made extensive use of the type during the Portuguese Colonial War in Angola and Mozambique. The G.91 remained in production for 19 years, during which a total of 756 aircraft were completed, including the prototypes and pre-production models. The assembly lines were finally closed in 1977. The G.91 was also used as a basis for a twin-engined derivative: the Fiat/Aeritalia G.91Y. The G.91 had a relatively lengthy service life, outlasting the Cold War and being finally withdrawn in 1995. It was displaced by newer types such as the Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet and the Aermacchi MB-326.

==Development==
===Origins===

As a result of experiences from the Korean War alongside newly developed concepts of aerial cooperation, the members of NATO recognised a need to reequip their inventories with suitable jet-powered ground attack aircraft. In December 1953, NATO Supreme Command issued specifications for a new light tactical support aircraft. European manufacturers were invited to submit their designs for this requested &quot;Light Weight Strike Fighter&quot; role. The G.91 was designed to this specification by the Italian engineer Giuseppe Gabrielli, hence the &quot;G&quot; designation. The competition was intended to produce an aircraft that was light, small, expendable, equipped with basic weapons and avionics and capable of operating with minimal ground support. These specifications were developed for two reasons: the first was the nuclear threat to large air bases, many cheaper aircraft could be better dispersed, and the other was to counter the trend towards larger and more expensive aircraft.
The specified technical requirements included a 1,100 m (3,610 ft) takeoff distance over a 15 m (49 ft) obstacle, the capability to operate from semi-prepared grass airstrips and roads, a maximum speed of Mach 0.95, a range of 280 km (170 mi) with 10 minutes over the target while possessing a maximum of 2,200 kg (4,850 lb) empty weight and 4,700 kg (10,360 lb) max weight. Equipment requirements were the presence of armoured protection for the pilot and the fuel tanks along with alternative arrangements of 4 × 12.7 mm (.5 in) machine guns or 2 × 20 mm or 30 mm autocannon. These operational specifications were viewed as not being straightforward to fulfil at that time.

The challenge of providing an engine that matched the requirements of lightness and power, reliability and ease of maintenance was solved by using the Bristol Siddeley Orpheus turbojet then at the start of development in the UK. Development of this engine was aided by substantial contribution from the US Mutual Weapons Development Programme. Nine of the ten designs to be subsequently submitted for the competition were powered by the Orpheus engine.

In order to evaluate the bids that various aircraft manufacturers submitted in response, a special Advisory Group for Aeronautical Research and Development (AGARD) committee conducted extensive evaluations. The designs were required within two months of the competition, in which time an assortment of submissions were made, mainly by European companies. Besides the G.91, these included the Northrop N-156, Dassault Mystère XXVI, Sud-Est Baroudeur, Aerfer Sagittario 2 and the Breguet Br.1001 Taon. On 18 March 1953, these submitted designs formally began to be assessed by the AGARD committee, which was under the chairmanship of Theodore von Kármán. The initial project selection process took 18 months to complete.

===Fly-off and selection===
On 3 June 1955, it was announced that the Fiat G.91 had been selected as the design with the most promise. Out of the submissions, the two winning projects were, in order: the Breguet Br.1001 Taon and the Fiat G.91. A third aircraft design was subsequently added: the Dassault Mystère XXVI. As a result of the G.91&#x27;s selection, an immediate order was received for three prototypes and a total of 27 pre-production aircraft. Fiat quickly set about developing the concept to the prototype phase; noticeable changes in the design occurred during this phase, such as increases in the aircraft&#x27;s maximum weight due to the addition of supplementary equipment and structural strengthening measures.

On 9 August 1956, the prototype G.91 conducted its maiden flight at the Caselle airfield, Turin, Italy; it was flown by Chief Test Pilot Riccardo Bignamini. Accordingly, the G.91 had achieved a seven-month head start over the Dassault prototype and almost a year ahead of the Breguet Taon. An intensive series of test flights followed the type&#x27;s maiden flight, these were not without setbacks. The most serious problem discovered during these was the presence of aeroelastic vibrations, leading to a series of investigative flights to resolve this condition. On 20 February 1957, during a test flight intended to explore the limits of the aircraft&#x27;s speed-load envelope, difficulties led to the destruction of the first G.91 prototype. The cause of the prototype&#x27;s loss was linked to problems encountered with the horizontal control system which had led to structural failure; this led to the tail assembly being subjected to rigorous testing to identify the cause of the failure.

The re-engineering work that had been performed to cure the vibration problem was very extensive and resulted in the second prototype being fitted with a larger tail, a six cm (two in) higher canopy, and the addition of a ventral fin. The second prototype had other modifications, including the installation of a full armament and a more powerful Orpheus engine capable of 4,850 lbf. In July 1957, the second prototype performed its first flight; it was not immediately sent to participate in the final evaluation process. Both the third and fourth G.91 prototypes were later sent to France to continue the evaluation flights.
The final selection of the competing designs was planned for late 1957. In September 1957, at the Centre d&#x27;Essais en Vol at Brétigny-sur-Orge, in France, the three rival aircraft types met for evaluation trials. During these trials, the Italian aircraft is claimed to have delivered an impressive performance. In January 1958, the Fiat G.91 was officially declared the winner of the competition.

In April 1958, following a meeting of NATO defence ministers, an agreement was formed that the G.91 would be the first NATO lightweight strike fighter, and that it was to be followed in 1961 by &quot;a developed version&quot; of the Breguet Taon. In May 1958, a production meeting was scheduled to discuss the production of the aircraft with financial support from the United States; the Americans would provide some of the finance for the French, German and Italian aircraft, in addition to paying for the Turkish aircraft. The defence ministers reached an agreement to order 50 aircraft for each country.

Given the large economic and commercial interests at stake, there was a certain amount of controversy surrounding this decision. After the loss of the first G.91 prototype, the French government preferred to pursue development of the locally designed Étendard instead. The British government similarly ignored the competition to concentrate on Hawker Hunter production for the same role. The Italian government had elected to order the G.91 for the Italian Air Force prior to the results of the competition being known. These pre-production machines would later go on to serve for many years with the Italian aerobatic team, the &quot;Frecce Tricolori&quot;, designated as the &quot;G.91 PAN&quot;.

===Production===
By 1957, Fiat Aviazione was in the process of establishing the first production line for the G.91 at their facility at Turin-Aeritalia Airport, Piedmont, Italy. In total, Fiat constructed 174 G.91s of various variants for Italy, along with an additional 144 G.91 R/3 variants for West Germany (including 50 that had been ordered and then cancelled by Greece and Turkey). The first order was for 50 aircraft from Aeritalia, then Dornier and other German firms had an order for 232 machines, which was later increased to 294. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; (German Air Force) also bought 44 G.91T/3 two-seat trainers and another 22 were produced in Germany, ending production in 1972.

The German order involved a production run of 294 G.91s that were domestically constructed in Germany under a license production arrangement by Flugzeug-Union Süd, a consortium of former competitors Messerschmitt, Heinkel and Dornier; Messerschmitt produced the forward fuselage and tail assembly, Dornier manufactured the center fuselage along with final assembly and flight testing, while Heinkel fabricated the wing. The G.91 holds the distinction of being the first combat aircraft to be manufactured in Germany since the Second World War. On 20 July 1961, the first German-built G.91 conducted its first flight from Oberpfaffenhofen Airfield.

Aeritalia also negotiated a comprehensive license manufacturing agreement for the Orpheus engine that powered the type. Messier-Bugatti-Dowty produced the aircraft&#x27;s undercarriage.

The G.91 was also considered by a number of nations, including Austria, Norway, and Switzerland. During early 1961, four G.91s were shipped to the United States in order to participate in a formal evaluation program for the United States Army; these aircraft were subjected to several evaluation trials, the majority of which taking place within Alabama and New Mexico. The US Army studied the use of the type as a possible Forward Air Control aircraft. However, the service subsequently relinquished all fixed-wing aircraft operations to the United States Air Force, and thus the prospective G.91 procurement was not pursued.

==Design==

The Fiat G.91 is a lightweight tactical ground attack aircraft. It is a subsonic aircraft that was designed for both simplicity and agility. A key function of the aircraft is its short-field capability, having been constructed with a rugged airframe to withstand the demands imposed by high-intensity operations and the use of semi-prepared airstrips; the undercarriage is furnished with low-pressure tyres for the same purpose. The standard mission of the G.91 was the attack of targets within a 170-mile radius of its base with a typical loiter time of ten minutes, travelling at maximum speed in the combat area and traversing at cruise speeds. The G.91 is typically powered by a single Bristol Siddeley Orpheus turbojet engine. 

The all-metal fuselage uses conventional and straightforward construction methods, being a semi-monocoque design manufactured in three sections. The forward section, which was produced separate to the others before being rivetted to the centre fuselage, contains various radio navigation and communication equipment such as radio direction finder, transponder, ultra high frequency (UHF) radio, and identification friend or foe (IFF); the nose typically contained a total of three cameras. The cockpit is positioned directly above the chin-mounted air intake for the engine. It is surrounded on three sides with steel armour plating, the glass windshield is also armoured. The cockpit is furnished with a Martin-Baker Mk.4 ejector seat; it is both pressurised and equipped with manually controlled climate controls.

The center fuselage section houses the armament bay, which is set beneath the cockpit, and the seven split fuel tanks, which are protected against damage from ground fire by armour plating. The armament bay can accommodate up to four 12.7 mm (0.50 in) M2 Browning machine guns with 300 rounds of ammo per gun, or alternatively up to two 30 mm (1.18 in) DEFA cannons with 120 rounds per cannon. Other munitions included various rockets and bombs; while gun pods and external drop tanks can be installed on hardpoints fitted on the wing. Both weapons and ammunition in the armament bay were mounted on panel doors, which could be easily removed and quickly swapped by two men during rearming on the ground. In addition, various access panels are incorporated to enable simple field maintenance duties to be readily performed on the type.

The G.91 is equipped with a swept wing, which uses an all-metal two-spar structure; the outer panels can all be detached for transportation or easy replacement, while the center section is integral with the fuselage. It is swept at a 37-degree angle at quarter-chord with a thickness-to-chord ratio of 10 per cent. The wing features single-slotted flaps and hydraulically-actuated ailerons. The tailplane is electrically actuated and had irreversible hydraulic elevators fitted with an artificial feel system as well as hydraulically-actuated air brakes and a drogue parachute located at the base of the rudder for rapid deceleration.

For the purpose of readily carrying out operations from austere airstrips, Fiat developed purpose-built ground support equipment for the easy and rapid servicing of the aircraft. Specifically, the equipment needed to inspect, maintain, resupply, and repair the G.91 were designed to possess minimal weight and size to facilitate transportation. Fiat also completed a study to add hooks onto the aircraft for the purpose compatibility with arresting gear and aircraft catapult for further increased short field performance; a number of production aircraft in Luftwaffe service were outfitted as such.

==Operational history==

===Italy===
On 20 February 1958, the first pre-production G.91 conducted its maiden flight. In August 1958, the 103mo &quot;Gruppo&quot;, 5a &quot;Aerobrigata&quot;, called &quot;Caccia Tattici Leggeri&quot; (Light Tactical Fighter Group), was formed for the purpose of conducting operational evaluation of the aircraft, initially based at Pratica di Mare Air Force Base. In 1959, the 103Mo were transferred to Frosinone Airport for trialling the austere basing capabilities of the G.91, including operating from various types of terrain. The unit also performed exercises in the vicinity of Venice, such as at Maniago and Campoformido, in the presence of NATO officials; during this stage of the trials, German pilots also flew the aircraft.

In 1961, the next operational unit to be formed was 14mo &quot;Gruppo&quot;, &quot;Seconda Aerobrigata&quot;. This unit had its role shifted to tactical support, because its groups were 14mo, 103mo (dispatched from 5 A/B to this &quot;Aerobrigade&quot;) and 13mo (only in reserve). All of them were based at Treviso-Sant&#x27;Angelo.

During 1964, the pre-production aircraft of 103mo &quot;Gruppo&quot; were replaced by production standard G.91 R/1 combat aircraft; thus 16 of the pre-production aircraft were converted for service with the Italian aerobatic team, the &quot;Frecce Tricolori&quot;; these conversions, which had their armament removed and other modifications such as the addition of pitch dampers, ballast, and smoke tanks beneath the wings, were designated as the &quot;G.91 PAN&quot;. The G.91 PAN reportedly accumulated roughly 1,500 flight hours per year, and had an average efficiency in excess of 90 per cent.

In late 1964, the first batch of two-seater G.91T/1 aircraft, which had lengthened fuselage to accommodate an additional seat for training purposes, was delivered to the &quot;Scuola Volo Basico Avanzato&quot; (Amendola flying school for advanced jet training). These aircraft were used for the further training of pilots that had recently graduated from the Aermacchi MB-326 jet trainer.

In 1995, the last G.91 was phased out and retired by Italy.

===Germany===

In September 1960, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; received their first two Fiat-built G.91 R/3 aircraft. An initial five G.91R/3 aircraft were delivered to &quot;Erprobungstelle 61&quot; for trials with subsequent deliveries being allocated to &quot;Aufklärungsgeschwader 53&quot; (53rd Reconnaissance Group) based at Erding, near Munich along with &quot;Waffenschule 50&quot; (Weapons School 50). On 20 July 1961, the first Dornier-built G.91 performed its first flight. The G.91R/3 equipped four newly formed &quot;Leichte Kampfgeschwader&quot; (light attack wings), often being used to replace older aircraft such as the American-built Republic F-84F Thunderstreak.

In October 1961, &quot;Aufklärungsgeschwader 53&quot; became the first operational G.91 unit to achieve active status; in late May 1962, this same unit proceeded to carry out its first operational training flights. During 1962 and 1963, the Luftwaffe conducted a series of trials to determine the capabilities of the type in terms of austere and unfavourable climate performance, including an overseas deployment to Béchar Province, Algeria, to test the G.91&#x27;s versatility and operational efficiency within such climate conditions.

An additional 45 G.91 T/3 Fiat-built two-seat trainer aircraft were ordered for the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, the first 35 being allocated to &quot;Waffenschule 50&quot; with the balance of the order divided between operational units. In early 1961, &quot;Waffenschule 50&quot; began its first training courses for pilot instructors. Of these, 22 aircraft were built by Dornier between 1971 and 1973; this variant were used to train Weapons Systems Officers for the F-4 Phantom.

Fifty G.91 R/4 aircraft were taken up from a cancelled Greek/Turkish order but were deemed to be unsuitable for operational use. Alternatively, these were used as training aircraft and were operated solely by &quot;Waffenschule 50&quot;. When the initial training programme was completed, all R/4 aircraft were retired in 1966 and 40 surviving airframes were sold to Portugal. Other R/4 aircraft remained in Germany and were transferred to ground instructional use or for static displays at recruitment presentations.

It has been claimed that the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; had intended to equip a further four wings with the G.91R/3; however, initial operating experience with the type had allegedly left the Luftwaffe disappointed with the aircraft&#x27;s performance and thus the intended further orders for the type were cut. A number of Luftwaffe G.91s were emblazoned with a &quot;pig&quot; emblem, this has been interpreted as a comment on the aircraft&#x27;s lacklustre performance.

On 1 January 1970, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; fleet consisted of 310 G.91 R/3 and 40 G.91T aircraft; by 1976, only 20 of the G.91 R/3 aircraft had been lost to accidents, a loss rate of 6 per cent. During the early 1980s, the G.91 R/3 was replaced in German service by the Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet which operated in the same role; the last G.91 aircraft were officially retired in 1982.

===Portugal===
From 1961, Portugal became involved in fighting against nationalist movements in its African overseas territories, the series of conflicts becoming known as the Portuguese Colonial War. Portugal had deployed a detachment of F-86 Sabres to Portuguese Guinea in August 1961, prior to the outbreak of major fighting, but was forced to withdraw the jet fighters back to Europe owing to pressure from the United States and the United Nations, who imposed an arms embargo. This left a gap in air cover for Portugal&#x27;s African colonies, both in the close air support role, and in the air defence role.

In 1965, as the scale of fighting increased, Portugal attempted to purchase 100 surplus Canadian built Sabre Mk 6s from West Germany, but instead, it was offered 40 G.91R/4s, which had originally been built for Greece and Turkey and which differed from the rest of the Luftwaffe G.91s sufficiently to create maintenance problems in exchange for allowing Germany to build and use an airbase at Beja in Portugal for training.

G.91s arrived in Portuguese Guinea in 1966, equipping &quot;Esquadra 121 Tigres&quot; based at Bissau, and being used for reconnaissance and close support with rockets, napalm and bombs against PAIGC rebels. When the PAIGC started to be supplied with Soviet-made Strela 2 (NATO designation SA-7 Grail) MANPADS in early 1973, these immediately became a threat to Portuguese air superiority. On 25 March 1973, and 28 March, two FAP G.91s were shot down by missiles within three days, with a further two lost to conventional ground fire later in the year. (By comparison, only two G.91s had been lost in Guinea from 1966 to 1973.) A final G.91 was lost to a missile on 31 January 1974, while Strelas were also responsible for the loss of a T-6 Texan and two Do.27K-2s.
G.91s deployed to Mozambique at the end of 1968, equipping &quot;Esquadra 502 Jaguares&quot; ininitally at Beira, later moving to Nacala, with a second squadron &quot;Esquadra 702 Escorpiões&quot; (Scorpions) forming in September 1970 at Tete, flying against FRELIMO forces. FRELIMO also received Strelas in 1973, although unlike elsewhere, the Portuguese in Mozambique did not lose any aircraft to missiles with Chinese support, even if it forced Portuguese pilots to change their tactics. The only G.91 destroyed in combat in Mozambique was the serial number &quot;5429&quot;, flown by Lt. Emilio Lourenço: his plane was destroyed and Lourenço killed by a premature detonation of its bombs while flying a strike against rebel positions on 15 March 1973.

In 1973, with the United Nations weapons embargo against Portugal, the Air Force faced problems purchasing further numbers of close air support aircraft. An attempt was then made to acquire more Fiat G.91s from Germany by having Dornier disassembling the aircraft and then selling them as spare parts to Switzerland and Spain. These spare parts would be later sold to Portugal and assembled locally with different serial numbers. However, the deal did not follow through as the German government vetoed it.

In April 1974, the Portuguese government fell in the Carnation Revolution, with the new government seeking to grant its colonies independence. Portugal withdrew its G.91s from Guinea when it was granted independence in 1974, with its forces also leaving Mozambique. One of the G.91 squadrons was briefly deployed to Angola in late 1974, in order to try to prevent fighting between rival National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA) and National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) forces, being finally withdrawn back to Portugal in January 1975.

In 1976, a second purchase of 14 G.91 R/3s and 7 G.91 T/3 trainers was made from Germany, which were followed by further aircraft when the G.91 was withdrawn from &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; service in from 1980 to 1982, giving a total of 70 R/3s and 26 T/3s, although not all of these entered service, with many being broken up for spare parts. Portugal finally phased out the last of its G.91s in 1993.

===Others===
On 6 September 1961, the first G.91 R/4 was delivered to the Hellenic Air Force (HAF) for evaluation purposes. The G.91 R/4 variant, of which 25 aircraft were intended to be delivered to both Greece and Turkey, employed the same armament as the G.91 R/1 while using the equipment of the R/3 variant. However, both Greece and Turkey would ultimately not induct any G.91s, these aircraft were instead passed onto Germany&#x27;s inventory instead.

==Variants==


&quot;Data from:&quot; Warpaint No.49:Fiat G.91

Trainer and reconnaissance variants were produced right from the start of G.91 production, but the basic design of the aircraft remained virtually unchanged throughout almost the entire production run of the aircraft. The one major difference is that the R series aircraft were single-seaters, while the T series aircraft had two seats. To accommodate the extra seat, the T series aircraft had a slightly longer fuselage.
;G.91: Prototypes and pre-production aircraft.
;G.91A: A single prototype, built to test wing slats and fuel tanks in the wings.
;G.91BS/1: (BS – Battle Surveillance) Derived from the G.91T with improved avionics and photographic equipment, not built.

The drogue being attached to an extension of the winch around the trailing edge, above the wing. Other modifications included a large blade aerial above the centre fuselage and an anti-collision light at the forward end of the dorsal fin.
;G.91Y:An additional 67 aircraft built by Aeritalia were significantly different from earlier versions. These single-seat aircraft, based on the longer trainer version, designated G.91Y and nicknamed &quot;Yankee&quot;, replaced the original single Bristol Siddeley Orpheus engine with two General Electric J85 units in a &quot;completely re-engineered structure&quot; giving 60% more power and doubling the tankage for increased range with 75% more payload. The G.91Y first flew on 12 December 1966 and displayed an improvement in speed, range, payload, and manoeuvrability. The maximum speed was increased to 1,110 km/h (690 mph, 600 kn, Mach 0.91). The machine guns were replaced by a pair of DEFA 552 30 mm cannon with 125 rounds per gun. All the aircraft built served with the Italian Air Force.
;G.91YT:A projected two-seat version of the G.91Y, not built.
;G.91YS:Proposed version of the G.91Y for Switzerland, one built.

<text>Abbasanta (, , literally &quot;holy water&quot;; ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Oristano, Sardinia, Italy. It is on the main road between Macomer and Oristano.

==Description==
Abbasanta sits on a lava plateau rich in cork oaks, olive trees and &quot; (mastic trees). The plateau arose from the lava flow of the Montiferru volcano.
The landscape of the lava plateau is characterised by pastures that are enclosed by stone walls that surround the &#x27; built in the 18th century. In the surrounding countryside, there are still some typical shelters (&#x27;) made of stones and boughs by the shepherds.

In the village the stone houses are characteristic. They are low and with few floors, without sheds, but usually with a back courtyard where some space is reserved for the domestic animals. This is a quite common architectural dwelling in an area traditionally involved in sheep farming rather than agriculture.

The front room of the house is often a courtyard for chickens, in the centre of which there is the hearth (&quot;), used for hanging and drying cured pork meat. Later, fireplaces replaced the hearths.

==History==
In Roman times, the town, called &quot;Ad Medias&quot;, was in the territory of the Æchilenenses or Cornenses.

The village was built all around the two churches of Santa Amada and Santa Caterina (dedicated to Catherine of Alexandria). There was a clear separation between social classes.

Until the 1950s the use of Italian and Sardinian language had distinct and complementary functions. Italian was the official language, used by the public administration, while Sardinian was the language spoken at home and among friends. The characteristic expressions of the dialect are usually inspired by the peasant and pastoral world. Many proverbs refer to the values of honesty, friendship, fidelity (of the woman), loyalty, parsimony and obedience to the divine will.

==Main sights==
The whole of the Abbasanta plateau is rich in archaeological sites. Very close to the village is the nuraghe Losa.

A country church is set on the site of Sant&#x27;Agostino (dedicated to Augustine of Hippo). Around the rural church, there are some characteristic small houses (in Sardinian language &#x27; or &#x27;) that host the pilgrims during the religious feasts.

<text>Deep River is a town in Renfrew County, Ontario, Canada. Located along the Ottawa River, it lies about north-west of Ottawa on the Trans-Canada Highway. Deep River is opposite the Laurentian Mountains and the Province of Quebec.

The name &quot;Deep River&quot; purportedly derives from the notion that the Ottawa River reaches its greatest depth of just outside the township. Although this is not official, the Ottawa River reaches a depth of in Moose Bay, which is located on the Holden Lake reservoir from the Des Joachim dam, west of Deux-Rivières.

The primary industry centres on research at the Chalk River location of Canadian Nuclear Laboratories (CNL), a facility of the Chalk River Laboratories about 10 km east of Deep River on Highway 17. The facility is named for and primarily accessed via the nearby town of Chalk River although the site is technically in Deep River.

== History ==

Plans for the construction of this planned community began in 1944 by the federal government as part of the Manhattan Project, to accommodate employees of the nearby Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories (CRNL). Along with Los Alamos, New Mexico, and Oak Ridge, Tennessee, Chalk River was an offshoot of the nuclear effort for the allies and scientists, engineers, and tradesmen from around the world who came to work on the Manhattan Project. After World War II, Canada continued on with research into the atom, and dedicated the country to the peaceful uses that could be derived from putting the atom to use. Deep River was situated far enough upwind and upriver of the Chalk River research reactors to avoid radioactive fallout.

John Bland, an architecture professor at McGill University, developed the town&#x27;s first master plan in 1944. Bland located the town between the existing Highway 17 and the Ottawa River. He designed a system of streets that generally followed the contours of the area&#x27;s topography. Residential neighborhoods stretched out from a commercial and service-sector core. Straight and broad avenues ran along contour lines, and narrower and winding streets lay at right angles to discourage non-local traffic from entering neighborhoods. Parks and schools were located strategically throughout the town. The streets were named after local flora, Canadian politicians and famous scientists such as Ernest Rutherford and Charles Darwin.

At the same time, its economy and development were further boosted by the construction of the Des Joachim Hydroelectric Generating Station and dam on the Ottawa River at Rolphton, which opened on June 28, 1950.

The town was the subject of a &quot;Maclean&#x27;s Magazine&quot; article in 1958 by the noted Canadian journalist, editor, and author Peter C. Newman. Entitled, &quot;Deep River: Almost the Perfect Place to Live,&quot; the article took a sardonic take on the town as a very odd and isolated place populated by mostly young, male, highly-educated, and bored scientists and technicians struggling to find things to do with their time: &quot;The Utopian town where our atomic scientists live and play has no crime, no slums, no unemployment and few mothers-in-law.&quot;

Deep River was incorporated as a town in 1957.

In 1962, the experimental Nuclear Power Demonstration, or NPD power, reactor started up as a prototype for later CANDU reactors. This was operated by Ontario Hydro, which later used it as a training facility for new employees in its nuclear division. That brought many more temporary residents to the town. The NPD was shut down in 1987; the nuclear fuel was removed from the site, along with non-radioactive equipment, leaving in place only the building shell and the nuclear components (reactor, tanks, pipes etc.) that had become radioactive to wait for further decommissioning. The facility has been waiting for final demolition and permanent disposal of the radioactive nuclear components for over 30 years.

== Geography ==

Deep River is located at a latitude of 46°06&#x27; north and longitude 77°30&#x27; west, in the Boreal Forest biozone, and has an area of 50.87 square kilometres. The town sits on the section of the Ottawa River referred to as &quot;La Rivière Creuse&quot; (the &quot;Deep River&quot;) by 17th-century French explorers, and which later was at the heart of Canada&#x27;s 19th-century timber trade.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Deep River had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

Special Note: The 1956 Population of 3,669 is the Population of the Deep River I.D. OR Deep River Improvement District which was created in 1951-1956 after June 1st, 1951, according to Statistics Canada as written up in the 1956 Census Of Canada, CS98, Volume 1, Population, Table 5, Page 33. The 1961 Census Of Canada in its CS92-539, Table 6, Page 113, further clarifies this 1956 claim by saying that the Deep River Improvement District was actually created on April 16, 1956 out of territories once belonging to the Townships of Rolph, Buchanan, Wylie And McKay, and that the 1956 Improvement District then became an Incorporated Town in 1959 as is listed elsewhere here.

== Recreation, arts and culture ==
Deep River boasts many active clubs. Among the numerous community accomplishments is the creation of the Deep River Symphony Orchestra, formed in 1951, making Deep River one of the smallest towns to have a symphony orchestra. The Deep River Choral Group, and Deep River Community Band also host multiple concerts every year. Cross-country skiing is a popular winter recreation. Avid skiers of the Deep River Cross-Country Ski Club created the Silver Spoon trails and an annual race that brings contestants from across Ontario. Another popular event is &quot;Summerfest&quot;, a festival held once every two years, hosting many local and famous artists including Sloan, Wide Mouth Mason, Amanda Wilkinson, Daniel Lanois, Mobile, and K&#x27;naan. The festival also organizes many recreational events, including the Cross-River Swim.

Deep River is generally known to have picturesque scenery, excellent boating along the broad river, and good hiking in the hills across the Ottawa River. Deep River also has a community pool, fire department, police department, ski hill, golf course, curling rink, yacht and tennis club, and library.

Deep River is home to two museums: The Canadian Clock Museum, home to an extensive collection of clocks from The Arthur Pequegnat Clock Company, and the Society for the Preservation of Canada&#x27;s Nuclear Heritage, founded in 2017, which collects, safeguards, and promotes documents, artifacts, memorabilia, and knowledge associated with the history of the Canadian nuclear industry.

== Education ==
Deep River was last home to four schools in 2005 for students from junior kindergarten through grade 12:

* T.W. Morison Public School - now closed, it used to be for students junior kindergarten to grade 6. As decided by the school board on October 26, 2009, Morison Public School was closed down and moved into Mackenzie High School for the 2011-2012 school year in favour of making Mackenzie a JK-12 &quot;education centre.&quot;
* Keys Public School - now closed, it used to house students grade 5 to grade 8. At the end of the 2004-2005 school year, Keys Public School was officially closed down due to budget cuts in the school board. The Junior half of Keys (grades 5 and 6) was moved to Morison Public School, and the Intermediate half (grades 7 and 8) joined Mackenzie, separated by name only (though Mackenzie students are not allowed in the Keys Wing). It was predicted Morison would close down at the end of the 2006-2007 school year (for same above mentioned reasons) and would join Mackenzie High School as well, but was delayed in a decision to close until October 2009. In 2011, with the creation of Mackenzie Community School, Keys ceased to exist; it was named for nuclear scientist David A. Keys. The Keys Public School building was rented by AECL (Atomic Energy Canada Limited) for use as an office building. There have since been small changes to the building such as new fences, change in parking, security cameras and codes and badge scanners for doors.
* Mackenzie High School - for students grades 9 to 12 (the building now houses Keys Public School). Ceased to exist as of 2011 in name; amalgamated with Keys Public School and T.W. Morison Public School to create Mackenzie Community School. It was originally named for C. J. Mackenzie, who served as head of Canada&#x27;s National Research Council.
* Mackenzie Community School - for students JK to grade 12. Created in 2011 after the amalgamation of T.W. Morison Public School, Keys Public School, and Mackenzie High School; the school is housed in the previously named Mackenzie High School building. All sports team adopted the colours (Purple and Gold) and mascot (Mustangs) of Mackenzie High School. The school building also houses and hosts numerous community groups and activities.
* St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic School - for students JK to grade 8

The Deep River Summer Music Camp attracts around 100 students for a two week day-camp every summer.

The Deep River Science Academy hosted university and high-school students in creating numerous science projects in cooperation with many of the knowledge-economy enterprises of the area. The Academy ceased operations in 2016.

<text>Nasri Shamseddine (, also spelled Nasri Chamseddine; 27 June 1927 – 18 March 1983) was a Lebanese singer and actor.

==Biography==
Shamseddine was born Nasreddine Moustapha Shamesedine () in the village of Joun, in the southern part of the Chouf mountains to Shia family.

He became a teacher of the Arabic language first in the town of Chebaa and then the Al Jaafarieh Schools-Tyr in Tyre. During that time he started performing concerts singing and playing the &quot;oud&quot;. Shamseddine was first featured at the Baalbek International Festival in the early 1950s, where he also presented poems. He became not only a specialist in singing Lebanese folklore, but also in singing in different Arabic dialects. His works included collaborations with composers and singers like Melhem Barakat, Zaki Nassif, the Rahbani brothers, Halim Al-Roumi, Sabah, Wadih Al Safi, and Philemon Wehbe. Most prominently, performed with Fairuz from 1960 until little after the beginning of the Lebanese Civil War in 1978.

Shamseddine&#x27;s &quot;Œuvre&quot; consists of more than 500 songs. He held concerts in a number of countries and won awards in Brazil, France, Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Kuwait, and Syria. 

He suffered a heart attack shortly before a concert in Damascus in 1983. Shamseddine later collapsed and died on stage during the performance due to a cardiac arrest which followed the attack.

<text>Pierre François Verhulst (28 October 1804, in Brussels – 15 February 1849, in Brussels) was a Belgian mathematician and a doctor in number theory from the University of Ghent in 1825. He is best known for the logistic growth model.

==Logistic equation==
Verhulst developed the logistic function in a series of three papers between 1838 and 1847, based on research on modeling population growth that he conducted in the mid 1830s, under the guidance of Adolphe Quetelet; see for details.

Verhulst published in the equation:

:formula_1

where &quot;N&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) represents number of individuals at time &quot;t&quot;, &quot;r&quot; the intrinsic growth rate, and &quot;formula_2&quot; is the density-dependent crowding effect (also known as intraspecific competition). In this equation, the population equilibrium (sometimes referred to as the carrying capacity, &quot;K&quot;), formula_3, is
:formula_4.

In he named the solution the logistic curve.

Later, Raymond Pearl and Lowell Reed popularized the equation, but with a presumed equilibrium, &quot;K&quot;, as

:formula_5

where &quot;K&quot; sometimes represents the maximum number of individuals that the environment can support. In relation to the density-dependent crowding effect, formula_6. The Pearl-Reed logistic equation can be integrated exactly, and has solution

:formula_7

where &quot;C&quot; = 1/&quot;N&quot;(0) − 1/&quot;K&quot; is determined by the initial condition &quot;N&quot;(0). The solution can also be written as a weighted harmonic mean of the initial condition and the carrying capacity,

:formula_8

Although the continuous-time logistic equation is often compared to the logistic map because of similarity of form, it is actually more closely related to the Beverton–Holt model of fisheries recruitment.

The concept of R/K selection theory derives its name from the competing dynamics of exponential growth and carrying capacity introduced by the equations above.

<doc id="491403" wikidata="Q212127" url="?curid=491403" title="William Perkins (theologian)">
<text>William Perkins (1558–1602) was an influential English cleric and Cambridge theologian, receiving a B.A. and M.A. from the university in 1581 and 1584 respectively, and also one of the foremost leaders of the Puritan movement in the Church of England during the Elizabethan era. Although not entirely accepting of the Church of England&#x27;s ecclesiastical practices, Perkins conformed to many of the policies and procedures imposed by the Elizabethan Settlement. He did remain, however, sympathetic to the non-conformist puritans and even faced disciplinary action for his support.

Perkins was a prolific author who penned over forty works, many of which were published posthumously. In addition to writing, he also served as a fellow at Christ&#x27;s College and as a lecturer at St. Andrew&#x27;s Church in Cambridge. He was a firm proponent of Reformed theology, particularly the supralapsarian theology of Theodore Beza. In addition, he was a staunch defender of Protestant ideals, specifically the five solae with a particular emphasis on solus Christus and sola Scriptura.

== Early life ==

Perkins was born to Thomas and Anna Perkins at Marston Jabbett in the parish of Bulkington, Warwickshire, England in 1558, the year in which the Protestant Elizabeth I succeeded her Catholic sister Mary as Queen of England. Perkins lived his entire life under Elizabeth I, dying one year before the Queen&#x27;s death in 1603. Perkins&#x27;s relationship with Elizabeth was ambiguous: on the one hand, she was Good Queen Bess, the monarch under whom England finally and firmly became a Protestant nation; on the other hand, Perkins and the other members of the Puritan movement were frustrated that the Elizabethan settlement had not gone far enough and pushed for further Reformation.

Little is known of Perkins&#x27; childhood and upbringing. Sometime in his early life he was rendered lame which forced him to write with his left hand. His family was evidently of some means, since in June 1577, at age 19, Perkins was enrolled as a pensioner of Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge being trained in the tradition of the Reformed scholastic framework. He would receive his BA in 1581 and his MA in 1584.

According to an unverifiable story, Perkins was convicted of the error of his ways after he heard a Cambridge mother say to her child, &quot;Hold your tongue, or I will give you to drunken Perkins yonder.&quot; Whether or not the story is true, it is clear that Perkins had a religious awakening sometime between 1581 and 1584 during his time at Cambridge. Thomas Fuller&#x27;s biographical profile of Perkins portrayed him as &quot;very wild in his youth,&quot; skilled in mathematics, possessed of &quot;a rare felicity in speedy reading of books,&quot; and preaching, early in his ministry, with a sternness that he mitigated in later years:He would pronounce the word &quot;damn&quot; with such an emphasis, as left a doleful echo in his auditors&#x27; ears a good while after... . But in his older age he altered his voice and remitted much of his former rigidness; often professing that to preach mercy was that proper office of the ministers of the Gospel.Perkins&#x27;s sermons, wrote Fuller, &quot;were not so plain but that the piously learned did admire them, nor so learned but that the plain did understand them.&quot;

Perkins thus began a lifelong association with the &quot;moderate-puritan&quot; wing of the Church of England which held views similar to those of the continental Calvinist theologians Theodore Beza, Girolamo Zanchi, and Zacharias Ursinus. Perkins&#x27;s circle at Cambridge included Laurence Chaderton and Richard Greenham.

== Perkins as clergyman and Cambridge fellow ==

Following his ordination, Perkins also preached his first sermons to the prisoners of the Cambridge jail. On one celebrated occasion, Perkins encountered a young man who was going to be executed for his crimes and who feared he was shortly going to be in hell: Perkins convinced the man that, through Christ, God could forgive his sins, and the formerly distraught youth faced his execution with manly composure as a result.

In 1584, after receiving his MA degree, Perkins was elected as a fellow of Christ&#x27;s College, a post he held until 1594. In 1585, he became a Lecturer of St Andrew the Great in Cambridge, a post he held until his death.

== Perkins&#x27;s churchmanship ==

As a &quot;moderate Puritan&quot;, Perkins was firmly opposed to non-conformists and other separatists who refused to conform to the Church of England. He also opposed the Elizabethan regime&#x27;s program of imposing uniformity on the church. For example, when Archbishop of Canterbury John Whitgift imprisoned Francis Johnson for Johnson&#x27;s support of a presbyterian form of church polity, Perkins defended Johnson. This was not an isolated incident, and he appeared before the commission more than once.
On 13 January 1587, Perkins preached a sermon denouncing the practice of kneeling to receive Communion, and was ultimately called before the Vice-Chancellor as a result. During the final set of trials against Puritan ministers in 1590–1591, Perkins confirmed that he had discussed the &quot;Book of Discipline&quot; with Puritan ministers, but claimed that he could not remember whom he had talked to.

Perkins married Timothye Cradocke of Grantchester on 2 July 1595. (He had previously resigned his fellowship at Christ&#x27;s College, since only unmarried men could be fellows.) They became the parents of seven children, three of whom died in youth from various causes, and one of whom was born after Perkins himself had died.

== Theological opinions ==

Perkins was a proponent of &quot;double predestination&quot; and was a major player in introducing the thought of Theodore Beza to England. He viewed the Reformed concept of the Covenant of Grace, which is central to Reformed soteriology and double predestination, to be a doctrine of great consoling value. He was responsible for the publication in English of Beza&#x27;s famous chart about double predestination. Writing less than a century after Perkins&#x27;s death, his biographer Thomas Fuller recounted an objection that Perkins&#x27;s views on double predestination often prompted:Some object that his doctrine, referring all to an absolute decree, hamstrings all industry, and cuts off the sinews of men&#x27;s endeavours towards salvation. For, ascribing all to the wind of God&#x27;s Spirit, (which bloweth where it listeth,) he leaveth nothing to the oars of man&#x27;s diligence, either to help or hinder to the attaining of happiness, but rather opens a wide door to licentious security.
In addition to adopting a Reformed soteriology, Perkins also strongly held to the doctrines of &quot;solo Christo&quot; and &quot;sola Scriptura&quot; which &quot;serve as the twin foundation stones for what Perkins conceived as biblical preaching.&quot; He was also a major proponent of literal interpretation using the &quot;regula fidei&quot;, or Rule of Faith. This principle advocates that the unclear portions of scripture ought to be interpreted by the clear portions rather than by tradition or speculation. He did, however, leave room for figurative or analogical language when context demands.

== Influence ==
Although relatively unknown to modern Christians, Perkins has had an influence that is felt by Christians all around the world. and was highly regarded in the Elizabethan Church. In addition, Perkins&#x27;s views on double predestination made him a major target of Jacobus Arminius, the Dutch Reformed clergyman who opposed the doctrine of predestination. He also was influential in the theological development of the American puritan philosopher and theologian Jonathan Edwards. In addition, some consider the hermeneutics of Perkins to be a model that ought to be emulated.

In his lifetime, Perkins attained enormous popularity, with sales of his works eventually surpassing even Calvin&#x27;s. When he died, his writings were selling more copies than those of many of the most famous of the Reformers combined.

From his position at Cambridge, Perkins was able to influence a whole generation of English churchmen. His pupils include:

* William Ames, Puritan theologian whose &quot;Marrow of Theology&quot; was the most popular systematic theology of the time became professor of theology at Franeker, Netherlands
* John Robinson, the founder of congregationalism in Leiden and pastor of the group which went on to found the Plymouth Colony
* Thomas Goodwin, Congregationalist minister and Puritan theologian who was a vital part of the Westminster Assembly
* Paul Baynes, Puritan preacher and successor to Perkins as lecturer at the church of St Andrew the Great in Cambridge
* Samuel Ward, Puritan preacher and master of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge
* Phineas Fletcher, a poet
* Thomas Draxe, English puritan and theologian
* Thomas Taylor, Puritan preacher and Doctor of Divinity at Cambridge
* James Ussher, Archbishop of Armagh
* James Montagu, master of Sidney Sussex and later bishop of Winchester
* Richard Sibbes, Puritan preacher of Gray&#x27;s Inn and Master at Catherine&#x27;s Hall known for his eloquence and comforting sermons
* John Cotton, Colonial American Puritan minister and theologian of the Massachusetts Bay Colony
* Thomas Hooker, Colonial American Puritan minister and founder of the Connecticut Colony
* Thomas Shepard, Colonial American Puritan minister and theologian known for his leadership in the Antinomian Controversy

== Death ==

In 1602, Perkins suffered from &quot;the stone&quot;. After several weeks of suffering, he died on 22 October 1602 at age 44.

James Montagu preached his funeral sermon, taking as his text Joshua 1.2, ‘Moses my servant is dead’. He was buried in St. Andrew&#x27;s, the church which he had pastored for eighteen years.

<text>The Society of United Irishmen was a sworn association, formed in the wake of the French Revolution, to secure representative government in Ireland. Despairing of constitutional reform, and in defiance both of British Crown forces and of Irish sectarian division, in 1798 the United Irishmen instigated a republican rebellion. Their suppression was a prelude to the abolition of the Irish Parliament in Dublin and to Ireland&#x27;s incorporation in a United Kingdom with Great Britain.

Espousing principles they believed had been vindicated by American independence and by the French Declaration of the Rights of Man, the Presbyterian merchants who formed the first United society in Belfast in 1791 vowed to make common cause with their Catholic-majority fellow countrymen. Their &quot;cordial union&quot; would upend the landed Anglican Ascendancy and hold government accountable to a reformed Parliament.

As it radiated out from Belfast and from Dublin, the society drew on the structure and ritual of freemasonry to recruit among tradesmen, artisans and tenant farmers, many of whom had been organised in their own clubs and secret fraternities. Following its proscription in 1794, its goals were restated in uncompromising terms. Catholic emancipation and parliamentary reform became the call for universal manhood suffrage and a republic. Sharing a common democratic programme, and trading on the prospect of French assistance, agents were active in organising &quot;United&quot; societies in Scotland and in England with whom it was hoped action might be co-ordinated. 

Beginning in May 1798, martial-law seizures and arrests forced the conspiracy in Ireland into the open. The result was a series of local risings suppressed in advance of the landing, in August, of a small French expeditionary force.

In the wake of the rebellion, the British government pressed a union with Great Britain upon the Irish Parliament and transferred its unreformed, exclusively Protestant, representation to Westminster. In 1803, a renewed republican conspiracy, organised on strictly military lines, failed to elicit a response in what had been the United heartlands in the north, and misfired with an aborted rising in Dublin.

Exiles formed a United Irish society in the United States where, during the Quasi War with France, it attracted the hostile attention of the governing Federalist Party. There were reports of United Irish oath taking as a prelude to mutinies in the British Navy, and in Newfoundland and New South Wales.

Since the rebellion&#x27;s centenary in 1898, Ireland&#x27;s major political traditions, unionist, nationalist and republican, have claimed and disputed the legacy of the United Irishmen, and of the union they sought to effect between Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter.

==Background==
===Dissenters: &quot;Americans in their hearts&quot;===
The Society was formed at a gathering in a Belfast tavern in October 1791. With the exception of Thomas Russell, a former India-service army officer originally from Cork, and Theobald Wolfe Tone, a Dublin barrister, the participants who resolved to reform the government of Ireland on &quot;principles of civil, political and religious liberty&quot; were Presbyterians. As Dissenters from the established Anglican (Church of Ireland) communion, they were conscious of having shared, in part, the civil and political disabilities of the Kingdom&#x27;s dispossessed Roman Catholic majority.

Although open to them as Protestants, the Parliament in Dublin offered little opportunity for representation or redress. Two-thirds of the Irish House of Commons represented boroughs in the pockets of Lords in the Upper House. Belfast&#x27;s two MPs were elected by the thirteen members of the corporation, all nominees of the Chichesters, Marquesses of Donegall. Swayed by Crown patronage, parliament, in any case, exercised little hold upon the executive, the Dublin Castle administration which through the office of the Lord Lieutenant continued to be appointed by the King&#x27;s ministers in London. Ireland, the Belfast conferees observed, had &quot;no national government&quot;. She was ruled &quot;by Englishmen, and the servants of Englishmen&quot;

Faced with the tithes, rack rents and sacramental tests of this Ascendancy, and with the supremacy of the English interest, Presbyterians had been voting by leaving Ireland in ever greater numbers. From 1710 to 1775 over 200,000 sailed for the North American colonies. When the American Revolutionary War commenced in 1775, there were few Presbyterian households that did not have relatives in America, many of whom would take up arms against the Crown.

Most of the Society&#x27;s founding members and leadership were members of Belfast&#x27;s first three Presbyterian churches, all in Rosemary Street. The obstetrician William Drennan, who in Dublin composed the United Irishmen&#x27;s first test or oath, was the son of the minister of the First Church; Samuel Neilson, owner of the largest woollen warehouse in Belfast, was in the Second Church; Henry Joy McCracken, born into the town&#x27;s leading fortunes in shipping and linen-manufacture, was a Third Church member. Despite theological differences (the First and Second Churches did not subscribe to the Westminster Confession of Faith, and the Third sustained an Old Light evangelical tradition), their elected, Scottish-educated, ministers inclined in their teaching toward conscience rather than doctrine. In itself, this did not imply political radicalism. But it could, and (consistent with the teachings at Glasgow of the Ulster divine Francis Hutcheson) did, lead to acknowledgement from the pulpit of a right of collective resistance to oppressive government. In Rosemary Street&#x27;s Third Church, Sinclare Kelburn preached in the uniform of an Irish Volunteer, with his musket propped against the pulpit door.

Assessing security on the eve of the American War, the British Viceroy, Lord Harcourt, described the Presbyterians of Ulster as Americans &quot;in their hearts&quot;.

===The Volunteers and Parliamentary Patriots===

For the original members of the Society, the Irish Volunteers were a further source of prior association. Formed to secure the Kingdom as the British garrison was drawn down for American service, Volunteer companies were often little more than local landlords and their retainers armed and drilled. But in Dublin, and above all in Ulster (where they convened provincial conventions) they mobilised a much wider section of Protestant society.

In April 1782, with Volunteer cavalry, infantry, and artillery posted on all approaches to the Parliament in Dublin, Henry Grattan, leader of the Patriot opposition, had a Declaration of Irish Rights carried by acclaim in the Commons. London conceded, surrendering its powers to legislate for Ireland. In 1783 Volunteers converged again upon Dublin, this time to support a bill presented by Grattan&#x27;s patriot rival, Henry Flood, to abolish the proprietary boroughs and to extend the existing, &quot;Protestant&quot;, forty-shilling freehold county franchise. But the Volunteer moment had passed. Having accepted defeat in America, Britain could again spare troops for Ireland, and the limits of the Ascendancy&#x27;s patriotism had been reached. Parliament refused to be intimidated.

In 1784, beginning in Belfast (the &quot;Boston of Ireland&quot;), disappointed Volunteers in Ulster began taking Catholics into their ranks to form &quot;united&quot; companies. Belfast&#x27;s First Company acted in the firm conviction that &quot;a general Union of &quot;all&quot; the inhabitants of Ireland is necessary to the freedom and prosperity of this kingdom&quot;. The town&#x27;s Blue Company followed suit, and on 30 May 1784 both companies paraded before St Mary&#x27;s Chapel, Belfast&#x27;s first Catholic church, to mark its inaugural mass.

With the news in 1789 of revolutionary events in France enthusiasm for constitutional reform revived. In its Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen France and Civil Constitution of the Clergy, the greatest of the Catholic powers, was seen to be undergoing its own Glorious Revolution. In his &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot; (1790), Edmund Burke had sought to discredit any analogy with 1688 in England. But on reaching Belfast in October 1791, Tone found that Thomas Paine&#x27;s response to Burke, the &quot;Rights of Man&quot; (of which the new society was to distribute thousands of copies for as little as a penny apiece), had won the argument.

Three months before, on 14 July, the second anniversary of the Fall of the Bastille was celebrated with a triumphal Volunteer procession through Belfast and a solemn Declaration to the Great and Gallant people of France: &quot;As Irishmen, We too have a country, and we hold it very dearso dear... that we wish all Civil and Religious Intolerance annihilated in this land.&quot; Bastille Day the following year was greeted with similar scenes and an address to the French National Assembly hailing the soldiers of the new republic as &quot;the advance guard of the world&quot;.

==Belfast and Dublin debates==
===First resolutions===
It was in the midst of this enthusiasm for events in France that William Drennan proposed to his friends &quot;a benevolent conspiracy — a plot for the people&quot;, the &quot;Rights of Man and [employing the phrase coined by Hutcheson] the Greatest Happiness of the Greater Number its end — its general end Real Independence to Ireland, and Republicanism its particular purpose.&quot; 

When Drennan&#x27;s friends gathered in Belfast, they declared that in a &quot;great era of reform, when unjust governments are falling in every quarter of Europe; ... when all government is acknowledged to originate from the people,&quot; the Irish people find themselves with &quot;NO NATIONAL GOVERNMENT — we are ruled by Englishmen, and the servants of Englishmen whose object is the interest of another country&quot;. Such an injury could be remedied only by &quot;a Cordial Union among ALL THE PEOPLE OF IRELAND&quot; and &quot;by a complete and radical reform of the Representation of the People in Parliament&quot;.

They urged their fellow countrymen to follow their example: to &quot;form similar Societies in every quarter of the kingdom for the promotion of Constitutional knowledge, the abolition of bigotry in religion and policies, and the equal distribution of the Rights of Man through all Sects and Denominations of Irishmen&quot;.

The &quot;conspiracy&quot;, which at Tone&#x27;s suggestion called itself the Society of the United Irishmen, had moved beyond Flood&#x27;s Protestant patriotism. English influence, exercised through the Dublin Castle Executive, would be checked constitutionally by a parliament in which &quot;all the people&quot; would have &quot;an equal representation.&quot; Unclear, however, was whether the emancipation of Catholics was to be unqualified and immediate. The previous evening, witnessing a debate over the Catholic Question between the town&#x27;s leading reformers (members of the Northern Whig Club) Tone had found himself &quot;teased&quot; by people agreeing in principle to Catholic emancipation, but then proposing that it be delayed or granted only in stages.

===The Catholic Question===

Thomas Russell had invited Tone to the Belfast gathering in October 1791 as the author of &quot;An Argument on behalf of the Catholics of Ireland&quot;. In honour of the reformers in Belfast, who arranged for the publication of 10,000 copies, this had been signed A Northern Whig. Being purportedly of French Huguenot descent, Tone may have had an instinctive empathy for the religiously persecuted, but he was &quot;suspicious of the Catholics priests&quot; and hostile to what he saw as &quot;Papal tyranny&quot;. (In 1798 Tone applauded Napoleon&#x27;s deposition and imprisonment of Pope Pius VI).

For Tone the argument on behalf of the Catholics was political. The &quot;imaginary Revolution of 1782&quot; had failed to secure a representative and national government for Ireland because Protestants had refused to make common cause with Catholics. In Belfast, the objections to doing so were rehearsed for him again by the Reverend William Bruce. Bruce spoke of the danger of &quot;throwing power into hands&quot; of Catholics who were &quot;incapable of enjoying and extending liberty,&quot; and whose first interest would be to reclaim their forfeited lands.

In his &quot;Argument&quot; Tone insisted that, as a matter of justice, men cannot be denied rights because an incapacity, whether ignorance or intemperance, for which the laws under which they are made to live are themselves responsible. History, in any case, was reassuring: when they had the opportunity in the Parliament summoned by James II in 1689, and clearer title to what had been forfeit not ninety but forty years before (in the Cromwellian Settlement), Catholics did not insist upon a wholesale return of their lost estates. As to the existing Irish Parliament &quot;where no Catholic can by law appear&quot;, it was the clearest proof that &quot;Protestantism is no guard against corruption&quot;.

Tone cited the examples of the American Congress and French National Assembly where &quot;Catholic and Protestant sit equally&quot; and of the Polish Constitution of May 1791 (also celebrated in Belfast) with its promise of amity between Catholic, Protestant and Jew. If Irish Protestants remained &quot;illiberal&quot; and &quot;blind&quot; to these precedents, Ireland would continue to be governed in the exclusive interests of England and of the landed Ascendancy.

The Belfast Catholic Society sought to underscore Tone&#x27;s argument. Meeting in April 1792 they declared their &quot;highest ambition&quot; was &quot;to participate in the constitution&quot; of the kingdom, and disclaimed even &quot;the most distant thought of [...] unsettling the landed property thereof&quot;.

On Bastille Day 1792 in Belfast, the United Irishmen had occasion to make their position clear. In a public debate on An Address to the People of Ireland, William Bruce and others proposed hedging the commitment to an equality of &quot;all sects and denominations of Irishmen&quot;. They had rather anticipate &quot;the gradual emancipation of our Roman Catholic brethren&quot; staggered in line with Protestant concerns for security and with improving Catholic education. Samuel Neilson &quot;expressed his astonishment at hearing... any part of the address called a Catholic question.&quot; The only question was &quot;whether Irishmen should be free.&quot; William Steel Dickson, with &quot;keen irony&quot;, wondered whether Catholics were to ascend the &quot;ladder&quot; to liberty &quot;by intermarrying with the wise and capable Protestants, and particularly with us Presbyterians, [so that] they may amend the breed, and produce a race of beings who will inherit the capacity from us?&quot;

The amendment was defeated, but the debate reflected a growing division. The call for Catholic emancipation might find support in Belfast and surrounding Protestant-majority districts where already in 1784, admitting Catholics, Volunteers had begun to form &quot;united companies&quot;. West of the River Bann, and across the south and west of Ireland where Protestants were a distinct minority, veterans of the Volunteer movement were not as easily persuaded. The Armagh Volunteers, who had called a Volunteer Convention in 1779, boycotted a third in 1793. Under Ascendancy patronage they were already moving along with the Peep o&#x27; Day Boys, battling Catholic Defenders in rural districts for tenancies and employment, toward the formation in 1795 of the loyalist Orange Order.

===Equal representation===
In 1793, the Government itself breached the principle of an exclusively Protestant Constitution. Dublin Castle put its weight behind Grattan in the passage of a Catholic Relief Act. Catholics were admitted to the franchise (but not yet to Parliament itself) on the same terms as Protestants. This courted Catholic opinion, but it also put Protestant reformers on notice. Any further liberalising of the franchise, whether by expunging the pocket boroughs or by lowering the property threshold, would advance the prospect of a Catholic majority. Outside of Ulster and Dublin City, in 1793 the only popular resolution in favour of &quot;a reform&quot; of the Irish Commons to include &quot;persons of all religious persuasion&quot; was from freeholders gathered in Wexford town.

Beyond the inclusion of Catholics and a re-distribution of seats, Tone and Russell protested that it was unclear what members were pledging themselves to in Drennan&#x27;s original &quot;test&quot;: &quot;an impartial and adequate representation of the Irish nation in parliament&quot; was too vague and compromising. But within two years, the Dublin society had agreed on reforms that went beyond the dispensation they had celebrated in the French Constitution of 1791. In February 1794, they published, in the &quot;Dublin Evening Post&quot; and the &quot;Northern Star&quot;, a call for &quot;universal manhood suffrage&quot;. In the exercise of political rights, property, like religion, was to be excluded from consideration.

The new democratic programme was consistent with the transformation of the society into a broad popular movement. Thomas Addis Emmet recorded an influx of &quot;mechanics [artisans, journeymen and their apprentices], petty shopkeepers and farmers&quot;. In Belfast, Derry, other towns in the North, and in Dublin, some of these had been maintaining their own Jacobin Clubs. 

Writing to her brother, William Drennan, in 1795 Martha McTier describes the &quot;Irish Jacobins&quot; as an established democratic party in Belfast [they had issued an address calling for a universal franchise in December 1792] composed of &quot;persons and rank long kept down&quot; and [although joined in their proceedings by well-to-do United Irishmen such as the banker William Tennant],chaired by a &quot;radical mechanick&quot; (sic).

When April 1795 the new Lord Lieutenant, Earl Fitzwilliam, after publicly urging Catholic admission to parliament was recalled and replaced by Ascendancy hard-liner, Earl Camden, these low-ranked clubists entered United Irish societies in still greater numbers. With the Rev. Kelburn (much admired by Tone as a fervent democrat), they doubted that there &quot;was any such thing&quot; as Ireland&#x27;s &quot;much boasted constitution&quot;, and had urged their &quot;fellow-citizens of every denomination in Ireland, England, and Scotland,&quot; to pursue &quot;radical and complete Parliamentary reform&quot; through national conventions. In May, delegates in Belfast representing 72 societies in Down and Antrim rewrote Drennan&#x27;s test to pledge members to &quot;an equal, full and adequate representation of all the people of Ireland&quot;, and to drop the reference to the Irish Parliament (with its Lords and Commons). 

This Painite radicalism had been preceded by an upsurge in trade union activity. In 1792 the &quot;Northern Star&quot; reported a &quot;bold and daring spirit of combination&quot; (long in evidence in Dublin) appearing in Belfast and surrounding districts. Breaking out first among cotton weavers, it then communicated to the bricklayers, carpenters and other trades. In the face of &quot;demands made in a tumultuous and illegal manner&quot;, Samuel Neilson (who had pledged his woollen business to the paper) proposed that the Volunteers assist the authorities in enforcing the laws against combination. James (Jemmy) Hope, a self educated weaver, who joined the Society in 1796, nonetheless was to account Neilson, along with Russell (who in the &quot;Star&quot; positively urged unions for labourers and cottiers), McCracken, and Emmet, the only United Irish leaders &quot;perfectly&quot; understood the real causes of social disorder and conflict: &quot;the conditions of the labouring class&quot;.

Observing that property was &quot;merely the collection of labour&quot;, in a handbill of March 1794 Dublin United Irishmen had argued that &quot;the scattered labour of the lowest ranks&quot; was &quot;as real and ought to be as really represented&quot; as the &quot;fixed and solid property&quot; that presently monopolised Parliament. In offering manhood suffrage, it made a direct appeal to these ranks, &quot;the poorer classes of the community&quot;: Are you overloaded with burdens you are but little able to bear? Do you feel many grievances, which it would be too tedious, and might be &quot;unsafe&quot;, to mention? Believe us, they can be redressed by such reform as will give you your just proportion of influence in the legislature, AND BY SUCH A MEASURE ONLY. In the &quot;explosion&quot; of handbills, pamphlets and newspapers in 1790s, a small number of tracts &quot;directly addressed economic inequalities&quot;. &quot;Union doctrine; or Poor man&#x27;s catechism&quot; (1796?) proposed he confiscating the lands of the Established Church to finance care for pregnant women and the elderly, and education for the young.

As a body, however, United Irishmen did not propose the forms that such redress might take in a democratic national assembly. Operating on the principle that they should &quot;attend those things in which we all agree, [and] to exclude those in which we differ&quot;, the Society did not itself tie the prospect of popular suffrage to an economic or social programme. Beyond the disclaimer of wholesale Catholic restitution, the Society advanced no scheme or principle of land reform; in Tone&#x27;s recollection it never &quot;entertained&quot; ideas of &quot;an agrarian law&quot;. Jemmy Hope might be clear that this should not be &quot;a delusive fixity of tenure [that allows] the landlord to continue to draw the last potato out of the warm ashes of the poor man&#x27;s fire&quot;.But for the great rural mass of the Irish people this was an existential question upon which neither he nor any central resolution spoke for the Society.

===Women===

As were the Presbyteries, Volunteer companies and Masonic lodges through which they recruited, the United Irishmen were a male fraternity. In serialising William Godwin&#x27;s &quot;Enquiry Concerning political Justice&quot; (1793), the &quot;Northern Star&quot; had advised them of the moral and intellectual enlightenment found in an &quot;equal and liberal intercourse&quot; between men and women. The paper had also reviewed and commended Mary Wollstonecraft&#x27;s Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792). But the call was not made for women&#x27;s civic and political emancipation. In publishing excerpts from Wollstonecraft&#x27;s work, the &quot;Star&quot; focussed entirely upon issues of female education.

In the rival &quot;News Letter&quot;, William Bruce argued that this was disingenuous: the &quot;impartial representation of the Irish nation&quot; the United Irishmen embraced in their test or oath implied, he argued, not only equality for Catholics but also that &quot;every woman, in short every rational being shall have equal weight in electing representatives&quot;. Drennan did not seek to disabuse Bruce as to &quot;the principle&quot;he had never seen &quot;a good argument against the right of women to vote&quot;. But in a plea that recalled objections to immediate Catholic emancipation, he argued for a &quot;common sense&quot; reading of the test of which he was the author. It might be some generations, he proposed, before &quot;habits of thought, and the artificial ideas of education&quot; are so &quot;worn out&quot; that it would appear &quot;natural&quot; that women should exercise the same rights as men, and so attain their &quot;full and proper influence in the world&quot;.

In Belfast Drennan&#x27;s sister Martha McTier and McCracken&#x27;s sister Mary-Ann, and in Dublin Emmett&#x27;s sister Mary Anne Holmes and Margaret King, shared in the reading of Wollstonecraft and of other progressive women writers. As had Tone on behalf of Catholics, Wollstonecraft argued that the incapacities alleged to deny women equality were those that law and usage themselves impose. Mary Ann McCracken, in particular, was articulate in taking to heart the conclusion that women had to reject &quot;their present abject and dependent situation&quot; and secure the liberty without which they could &quot;neither possess virtue or happiness&quot;.

Women formed associations within the movement. In October 1796 the &quot;Northern Star&quot; published a letter from the secretary of the Society of United Irishwomen. This blamed the English, who made war on the new republics, for the violence of the American and French Revolutions. Denounced as a &quot;violent republican&quot;, Martha McTier was the immediate suspect, but denied any knowledge of the society. The true author may have been her friend Jane Greg, described by informants as &quot;very active&quot; in Belfast &quot;at the head of the Female Societies&quot; (and by General Lake as being &quot;the most violent creature possible&quot;).

Mary Ann McCracken took Drennan&#x27;s test but stood aloof from the &quot;female societies.&quot; No women with &quot;rational ideas of liberty and equality for themselves&quot;, she objected, could consent to a separate organisation. There could be &quot;no other reason having them separate, but keeping the women in the dark&quot; and making &quot;tools of them&quot;.

In final months before the rising, the paper of the Dublin society, &quot;The Press&quot;, published two direct addresses to Irish women, both of which &quot;appealed to women as members of a critically-debating public&quot;: the first signed Philoguanikos (probably the paper&#x27;s founder, Arthur O&#x27;Connor), the second signed Marcus (Drennan).While both appealed to women to take sides, Philoguanikos was clear that women were being asked to act as political beings. He scorns those &quot;brainless bedlams [who] scream in abhorrence of the idea of a female politician&quot;. (Among those who took the Society test in response to the appeal were the writers Henrietta Battier and Margaret King).

The letters of Martha McTier and Mary Ann McCracken testify to the role of women as confidantes, sources of advice and bearers of intelligence. R.R. Madden, one of the earliest historians of the United Irishmen, describes various of their activities in the person of an appropriately named Mrs. Risk. By 1797 the Castle informer Francis Higgins was reporting that &quot;women are equally sworn with men&quot; suggesting that some of the women assuming risks for the United Irish cause were taking places beside men in an increasingly clandestine organisation. Middle-class women, such as Mary Moore, who administered the Drennan&#x27;s test to William James MacNeven, were reportedly active in the Dublin United Irishmen.

On the role in the movement of peasant and other working women there are fewer sources. But in the 1798 uprising they came forward in many capacities, some, as celebrated in later ballads (&quot;Betsy Gray&quot; and &quot;Brave Mary Doyle, the Heroine of New Ross&quot;), as combatants. Under the command of Henry Luttrell, Earl Carhampton (who, in a celebrated case in 1788, Archibald Hamilton Rowan had accused of child rape), troops treated women, young and old, with great brutality.

== Spread and radicalisation ==

===Jacobins, Masons and Covenanters===

Jacques-Louis de Bougrenet de La Tocnaye, a French émigré who walked the length and breadth of Ireland in 1796–97, was appalled to encounter in a cabin upon the banks of the lower Bann the same &quot;nonsense on which the people of France fed themselves before the Revolution&quot;. A young labourer treated him to a disposition on &quot;equality, fraternity, and oppression&quot;, &quot;reform of Parliament&quot;, &quot;abuses in elections&quot;, and &quot;tolerance&quot;, and such &quot;philosophical discourse&quot; as he had heard from &quot;foppish talkers&quot; in Paris a decade before. In 1793, a magistrate in that same area, near Coleraine, County Londonderry, had been complaining of &quot;daily incursions of disaffected people... disseminating the most seditious principles&quot;.Until his arrest in September 1796, Thomas Russell (later celebrated in a popular ballad as &quot;The man from God-knows-where&quot;) was one such agitator. Recruiting for the Society, he ranged from Belfast as far as Counties Donegal and Sligo.

In recruiting the first societies among the tenant farmers and market-townsmen of north Down and Antrim, Jemmy Hope made conscious appeal to what he called &quot;the republican spirit&quot; of resistance &quot;inherent in the principles of Presbyterian community&quot;. While presbyteries were divided politically, as they were theologically, leadership was found among church ministers and their elders, and not least from those who were foremost in championing the Scottish Covenanting tradition. Of those whobowing to &quot;no king but Jesus&quot;were elected to preach by the Reformed Presbytery in Ulster, it is estimated that half were implicated in the eventual rebellion. In Antrim thousands filled fields to hear the itinerant Reformed preacher William Gibson prophesyin the tradition that saw the Antichrist defeated in the overthrow of the Catholic Church in Francethe &quot;immediate destruction of the British monarchy&quot;. On the pages of the &quot;Northern Star&quot; he was joined by Thomas Ledlie Birch of Saintfield who (although adhering to the Synod of Ulster) likewise anticipated the &quot;overthrow of the Beast&quot;. 

Allies were also found in the growing network of masonic lodges. Although it was the rule that &quot;no politics must be brought within the doors of the Lodge&quot;, masons were involved in the Volunteer movement and their lodges remained &quot;a battleground for political ideas&quot;. As United Irishmen increasingly attracted the unwelcome attention of Dublin Castle and its network of informants, masonry did become both a cover and a model. Drennan, himself a mason, from the outset had anticipated that his &quot;conspiracy&quot; would have &quot;much of the secrecy and somewhat of the ceremonial of Free-Masonry&quot;.

=== The New System ===
From February 1793, the Crown was at war with the French Republic. This led immediately to heightened tensions in Belfast. On 9 March, a body of dragoons rampaged through the town, purportedly provoked by taverns displaying the likenesses of Dumouriez, Mirabeau and Franklin. They withdrew to barracks when, as related by Martha McTier, about 1,000 armed countrymen came into the town and mustered at McCracken&#x27;s Third Presbyterian. Further &quot;military provocations&quot; saw attacks on the homes of Neilson and others associated with the &quot;Northern Star&quot; (wrecked for the final time, and closed, in May 1797). Legislation impressed from Westminster banned extra-parliamentary conventions and suppressed the Volunteers, by then largely a northern movement. They were replaced by a paid militia, its ranks partially filled with conscripted Catholics, and by Yeomanry, an auxiliary force led by local gentry. In May 1794 the Society itself was proscribed.

The difficulties posed by the repression were &quot;compounded&quot; by the news from France. Increasingly, this persuaded liberal middle-class opinion of a link between &quot;the march of democracy&quot; and the guillotine.

Undaunted, those committed to the pro-French Painite line drafted a constitution for a &quot;new system&quot;. Approved in May 1795 by a Belfast conference of Down and Antrim societies, it sought to reconcile the democratic principles of the republic to come with the requirements of a coordinated, clandestine, organisation. Local societies were to split and replicate so as to remain within a range of 7 to 35 members, and, through delegate conferences, to commission a new five-man provincial directory. Selection to this &quot;committee of public welfare&quot; was by ballot, but in order to preserve secrecy, returning officers were sworn to inform only those elected of the results. Together with directors&#x27; capacity to co-opt additional members, this implied an executive free to take its own counsel.

In June 1795, four members of the Ulster executiveNeilson, Russell, McCracken and Robert Simmsmet with Tone as he passed through Belfast en route to America and atop Cave Hill swore their celebrated oath &quot;never to desist in our efforts until we had subverted the authority of England over our country, and asserted our independence&#x27;&quot;. In months that followed, while Tone (travelling via Philadelphia to Paris) lobbied for French assistance, they directed the creation of a shadow military organisation. Under elective command, each society was to drill a company, three companies were to form a battalion, and ten battalions, representing thirty societies, were to coordinate, under a &quot;colonel&quot;, as a regiment. From a shortlist drawn up by the colonels, the executive would then appoint an adjutant-general for the county.

===Alliance with the Catholic Defenders===

Aware that many of those who had lent their names to the original reform project recoiled from the prospect of insurrection, in March 1796 Tone recorded his understanding of the new resolve: &quot;Our independence must be had at all hazards. If the men of property will not support us, they must fall; we can support ourselves by the aid of that numerous and respectable class of the community, the men of no property&quot;.

The greatest body, existing, of men of no property, and with whom alliance was to be sought if a union of Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter was to take to the field, were the Defenders. A vigilante response to Peep O&#x27;Day raids upon Catholic homes in the mid-1780s, by the early 1790s the Defenders (drawing, like the United Irishmen, on the lodge structure of the Masons) were a secret oath-bound fraternity ranging across Ulster and the Irish midlands. Despite their professed loyalism (members had originally to swear allegiance to the King) Defenderism developed an increasingly seditious character. Talk in the lodges was of a release from tithes, rents and taxes, and of a French invasion that might allow the repossession of Protestant estates. Arms-buying delegations were sent to London.

Defenders and United Irishmen began to seek one another out. Religion was not a bar to joining the Defenders. In Dublin, in particular, where the Defenderism appealed strongly to a significant body of radical artisans and shopkeepers, Protestants (Napper Tandy prominent among them) joined in the determination to make common cause. Early in 1796, the Dublin Defenders sent a delegation to Belfast for the purpose of laying a &quot;foundation&quot; for a union between parties that, while equally hostile to the state, had been &quot;kept wholly distinct&quot;.

Oaths, catechisms and articles of association supplied to Dublin Castle nonetheless suggest the Defenders were developing a kind of Catholic liberation theology their own version of Gibson&#x27;s millenarianism. Apocalyptic biblical allusions and calls to &quot;plant the true religion&quot; sat uneasily with the rhetoric of inalienable rights and fealty to a &quot;United States of France and Ireland&quot;.
Oblivious to the anti-clericalism of the French Republic, many Defender rank-and-file viewed the French through a Jacobite, not Jacobin, lens, as Catholics at war with Protestants. Although Hope and McCracken did much to reach out to the Defenders, recognising the sectarian tensions (Simms reported to Tone that &quot;it would take a great deal of exertion&quot; to keep the Defenders from &quot;producing feuds&quot;), the Belfast Executive chose emissaries from its small number of Catholics.

With their brother-in-law John Magennis, in 1795 the United Irish brothers, Bartholomew and Charles Teeling, sons of a wealthy Catholic linen manufacturer in Lisburn, appear to have had command over the Down, Antrim and Armagh Defenders. United Irishmen were able to offer practical assistance: legal counsel, aid and refuge. Catholic victims of the Armagh disturbances and of the Battle of the Diamond (at which Charles Teeling had been present) were sheltered on Presbyterian farms in Down and Antrim, and the goodwill earned used to open the Defenders to trusted republicans. Emmet records these as being able to convince Defenders of something they had only &quot;vaguely&quot; considered, namely the need to separate Ireland from England and to secure its &quot;real as well as nominal independence&quot;.

What was decisive, however, was not their agreed political programme: final emancipation and a complete reform of representation. From Dungannon, where he had command, General John Knox, reported that local republicans had been &quot;obliged to throw in the bait of the Abolition of Tithes, Reduction of Rents etc.&quot;. Nothing less would rouse &quot;the lower orders of Roman Catholics&quot; (and nothing less, he suggested, would in time reconcile them to the alternative to separation, a union with Great Britain).

=== Dublin and the Catholic Committee ===

The Society that Tone had helped establish with Drennan in Dublin on his return from Belfast in November 1791 held themselves aloof from the Jacobin, Defender and other radical clubs in the capital. The city&#x27;s United men also shied away from the New System adopted in Ulster. Whereas Belfast had 16 societies in 1795 (and 80 by the spring of 1797), Dublin, with ten times the population, maintained just one general society comprising, at its height in March 1793, 350 to 400 members.

From the outset, the Dublin society had been distinguished by the presence of those described by Edmund Burke as the &quot;new race of Catholics&quot;: representatives of the emergent Catholic mercantile and professional middle class. Among them were prominent members of the Catholic Committee, including its chairman John Keogh. With Tone as his accompanying secretary, in January 1793 Keogh had led a Committee delegation to London where they had an audience with the king. The Catholic Relief Act followed in April. Having only acquired such recognition, many were loath to abandon the appearance of strict constitutionality. Announcing that there were paid informers in their midst, as early as January 1794 Neilson had urged the Dublin society to re-form on the Ulster model. In October there was discussion of a society of sections of 15 members each, each society returning one representative to a central committee. But the idea of coordinating behind closed doors was rejected on the grounds that &quot;the United Irishmen, as a legal, constitutional reform movement, would not engage in any activity which could not bear the scrutiny of the public or the Castle&quot;.

Keogh&#x27;s dismissal of Edmund Burke&#x27;s son, Richard Burke, as Committee secretary in 1792, and his replacement by Tone, a known democrat, did suggest a political shift. The British Prime Minister Pitt was already canvassing support for a union of Ireland and Great Britain in which Catholics could be freelybecause securelyadmitted to Parliament. London might yet be an ally in relieving Catholics of the last of the Penal Law restrictions, but it would be as a permanent minority in the enlarged Kingdom, not as a national majority in Ireland. Even that prospect was uncertain. Although tempered since the Gordon Riots, Anti-Popery remained an important strain in English politics. Meanwhile, Drennan recalls, &quot;Catholics were being driven to despair&quot; and were prepared to &quot;go to extremities&quot; rather than again be denied political equality.

Drennan was nonetheless sceptical of Catholic intentions. Suspecting that their object remained &quot;selfish&quot; (i.e. focused on emancipation rather than on separation and democratic reform) and recognizing their alarm at the anti-clericalism of the French Republic, Drennan, up until his trial for sedition in May 1794, promoted what he called an &quot;inner Society&quot; in Dublin, &quot;Protestant but National&quot;.

In April 1794, matters were brought to a head by the arrest of the Reverend William Jackson. An agent of the French Committee of Public Safety, Jackson had been having meetings with Tone in the prison cell of Archibald Hamilton Rowan. Whether because of his association with the Catholic Committee or his family&#x27;s connections, Tone was allowed to go into American exile, while Rowan, who was serving time for distributing Drennan&#x27;s seditious appeal to Volunteers, managed to flee the country. The scandal induced Thomas Troy, Catholic Archbishop of Dublin and Papal legate, to caution against the &quot;fascinating illusions&quot; of French principles and, in advance of the Society&#x27;s proscription, to threaten any Catholic taking the United test with excommunication. Lingering hopes of a return to open agitation were dashed in March the following year when, after endorsing Catholic admission to Parliament, the newly arrived Lord Lieutenant, William Fitzwilliam was summarily recalled.

Encouraged by the presence in Dublin of veterans of the northern movement, such as Samuel Nielson, Thomas Russell, and James Hope, members of the Dublin society regrouped with previously neglected lower-rank Jacobins and Defenders. A series of ephemeral organisations (The Philanthropic Society, the Huguenots, the Illuminati, the Druids&#x27; Lodges...) were used as a cover for their activities in Dublin and for the spread of the movement into the provinces. The result was the creation, in stark contrast to the original society, of a mass-based organization. Concentrated in the poorer, western quarters of the city, by May 1798 a new United Irish coalition claimed some 10,000 members (and another 9,000 in Dublin county).

=== Mobilisation and repression ===
On 15 December 1796, Tone arrived off Bantry Bay with a French fleet carrying about 14,450 men, and a large supply of war material, under the command of Louis Lazare Hoche. A gale prevented a landing. Hoche&#x27;s unexpected death on his return to France was a blow to what had been Tone&#x27;s adept handling of the politics of the French Directory. With the forces (and ambition) that might have allowed a second attempt upon Ireland, Hoche&#x27;s rival, Napoleon, sailed in May 1798 for Egypt.

Bantry Bay nonetheless made real the prospect of French intervention for which it was clear the forces available to the Crown were unprepared. At the same time, the government was shutting down attempts at political conciliation. In the new year, it announced that any further discussion in parliament of grievances serving in the country as &quot;pretexts for treasonable practices&quot; would result in adjournment.

In April 1797, William Orr was charged under the Insurrection Act with administering the United test to two soldiers. The movement&#x27;s first acclaimed martyr, he was hanged in October. Orr&#x27;s arrest in Antrim signalled the onset of General Lake&#x27;s &quot;dragooning of Ulster&quot;. For the authorities its urgency was underscored by public expressions of solidarity with those detained. The &quot;Northern Star&quot; reported that after Orr was detained, between five and six hundred of his neighbours assembled and brought in his entire harvest. When Samuel Nielson was taken in September, fifteen hundred people were said to have dug his potatoes in seven minutes. Such &quot;hasty diggings&quot; (traditionally accorded by families visited by misfortune) often occasioned mustering and drilling men, shouldering their spades, marching four to six deep accompanied by the sounding of horns. In May 1797, Yeomanry and Fencibles charged one such gathering near Cootehill in Cavan killing eleven and injuring many more.

With his troops&#x27; reputation for half-hanging, pitch-capping and other interrogative refinements travelling before him, at the end of 1797 Lake tuned his attention to disarming Leinster and Munster. As in the north, following Bantry societies in the south flooded with new members. In Leinster the new system took hold: the various republican clubs and cover lodges, and much of Defender network, were marshalled through delegate committees under a provincial executive in Dublin Among others who were to serve on the executive were Thomas Addis Emmet; Richard McCormick, Tone&#x27;s replacement as secretary to the Catholic Committee; the Sheares brothers (witnesses to the execution of Louis XVI) and two disillusioned parliamentary patriots: the future Napoleonic general Arthur O&#x27;Connor and the popular Lord Edward Fitzgerald.

==&quot;Unionising&quot; in Britain==
===United Scotsmen===
The war with France was also used to crush reformers in Great Britain, costing the United Irishmen the liberty of friends and allies. In 1793 in Edinburgh, Thomas Muir, whom Rowan and Drennan had feted in Dublin, with three other of his Friends of the People were sentenced to transportation to Botany Bay (Australia). The judge seized on Muir&#x27;s connection to the &quot;ferocious&quot; Mr. Rowan (Rowan had challenged Robert Dundas, the Lord Advocate of Scotland, to a duel) and on the United Irishmen papers found in his possession.

There followed in England the 1794 Treason Trials and, when these collapsed, the 1795 Treason Act and Seditious Meetings Act. The measures were directed at the activities of the London Corresponding Society and other radical groups among whom, as ambassadors for the Irish cause, Roger O&#x27;Connor and Jane Greg had been cultivating understanding and support.

In the face of the repression, sections of the democratic movement in both Scotland and in England began to regard universal suffrage and annual parliaments as a cause for physical force. Political tours by United Irishmen in the winter of 1796–7, and as conditions deteriorated in Ulster a growing tide of migrants, helped to promote such thinking and foster an interest in establishing societies on the new model Irish example.

When the authorities first became aware of the United Scotsmen early in 1797, in their view it was as little more than a Scottish branch of the United Irishmen. The Resolutions and Constitution of the United Scotsmen (1797) was &quot;a verbatim copy of the constitutional document of the United Irishmen, apart from the substitution of the words &#x27;North Britain&#x27; for &#x27;Irishmen&#x27;&quot;. At their height, during a summer of anti-militia riots, the United Scotsmen counted upwards of 10,000 members, the backbone formed (as had increasingly been the case for Belfast and Dublin societies) by artisan journeymen and weavers.

===United Englishmen, United Britons===
With the encouragement of Irish and Scottish visitors, the manufacturing districts of northern England saw the first cells of the United Englishmen formed in late 1796. Their clandestine proceedings, oath-taking, and advocacy of physical force &quot;mirrored that of their Irish inspirators&quot;, and they followed the Ulster system of parish-based cells (societies capped at thirty or thirty-six).

Describing himself as an emissary of the United Irish executive, the Catholic priest James Coigly (a veteran of unionising activities during the Armagh Disturbances) worked from Manchester with James Dixon, a cotton spinner from Belfast, to spread the United system to Stockport, Bolton, Warrington and Birmingham. In London Coigly conferred with those Irishmen who had hastened the radicalisation of the London Corresponding Society: among them United Irishman Edward Despard, brothers Benjamin and John Binns, and LCS president Alexander Galloway. Meetings were held at which delegates from London, Scotland and the regions resolved &quot;to overthrow the present Government, and to join the French as soon as they made a landing in England&quot;.

The resolution of the &quot;United Britons&quot; was discussed by the Irish leaders in Dublin in July 1797. Although addressed to the prospect of French assistance, in Ulster the suggestion that &quot;England, Scotland and Ireland are all one people acting for one common cause&quot;, encouraged militants to believe that liberty could be won even if &quot;the French should never come here&quot;.

At the end of February 1798, as he was about to embark on a return mission to Paris, Coigly was arrested carrying to the French Directory a further address from the United Britons. While its suggestion of a mass movement primed for insurrection was scarcely credible, it was deemed sufficient proof of the intention to induce a French invasion. The United movement in Britain was broken up by internment and Coigly was hanged.

===Alleged role in the 1797 naval mutinies===
In justifying the suspension of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; the authorities were more than ready to see the hand not only of English radicals but also, in the large Irish contingent among the sailors, of United Irishmen in the Spithead and Nore mutinies of April and May 1797. The United Irish were reportedly behind the resolution of the Nore mutineers to hand the fleet over to the French &quot;as the only government that understands the Rights of Man&quot;. Much was made of Valentine Joyce, a leader at Spithead, described by Edmund Burke as a &quot;seditious Belfast clubist&quot; (and recorded by R. R. Madden as having been an Irish Volunteer in 1778).

That the Valentine Joyce in question was Irish and a republican has been disputed, and while that &quot;rebellious paper, the &quot;Northern Star&quot;&quot; may have circulated as reported among the mutineers, no evidence has emerged of a concerted United Irish plot to subvert the fleet. In Ireland there was talk of seizing British warships as part of a general insurrection, but it was only after the Spithead and Nore mutinies that United Irishmen awoke to the effectiveness of formulating sedition within the Royal Navy.

There were a number of mutinies instigated by Irish sailors in 1798. Aboard HMS &quot;Defiance&quot; a court martial took evidence of oaths of allegiance to the United Irishmen and sentenced eleven men to hang.

==1798 Rebellion==
===The call from Dublin===

The movement never realised the national directory envisaged in the constitution of May 1795. Its leadership remained split between the executives of the two organised provinces, Ulster and Leinster. In June 1797, they met together in Dublin to consider northern demands for an immediate rising. The meeting broke up in disarray, with many of the Ulster delegates, fearful of arrest, fleeing abroad. In the north, the United societies had not recovered from their decapitation the previous September through the arrests (personally supervised by Castlereagh) that, in addition to Neilson, had netted Thomas Russell, Charles Teeling, Henry Joy McCracken and Robert Simms. Their removal had opened up the leadership in Belfast to less reliable elements, including government informants.

The initiative passed to the Leinster directory. The southern organisation remained too weak in the summer of 1797 to respond to the call for immediate action. But in the winter of 1797–98, its organisation consolidated in existing strongholds such as Dublin, Kildare and Meath, and broke new ground in the midlands and the south-east. In February 1798, a return prepared by Fitzgerald computed the number United Irishmen, nationwide, at 269,896. It is certain that the figure was not a measure of the number prepared to turn out, particularly in the absence of the French. Most would have been able to arm themselves only with simple pikes (of these the authorities had seized in the previous year 70,630 compared to just 4,183 blunderbusses and 225 musket barrels). The movement, nonetheless, had withstood the government&#x27;s countermeasures, and seditious propaganda and preparation continued.

In March 1798, almost the entire Leinster provincial committee were seized along with two directors, MacNevan and Emmet, together with all their papers. Faced with the breaking-up of their entire system, Fitzgerald, joined by Neilson who had been released in ill health from Kilmainham Prison, and the Sheares brothers, resolved on a general uprising for 23 May. The United army in Dublin was to seize strategic points in the city, while the armies in the surrounding counties would throw up a cordon and advance into its centre. As soon as these developments were signalled by halting mail coaches from the capital, the rest of the country was to rise.

On the appointed day the signal was duly given, but the rising in the city was aborted. The Yeomanry had been forewarned; Fitzgerald had been mortally wounded on the 19th, and on the morning of the 23rd, Neilson, who had been critical to the planning, was seized. Tens of thousands did turn out across the country, but in what proved to be a series of uncoordinated local uprisings.

===The South===

Some historians conclude that what connects the United Irishmen to most widespread and sustained of the uprisings in 1798 are &quot;accidents of time and place, rather than any real community of interest&quot;. Daniel O&#x27;Connell, who abhorred the rebellion, may have been artful in proposing that there had been no United Irishmen in Wexford. But his view that the uprising in Wexford had been &quot;forced forward by the establishment of Orange lodges and the whipping and torturing and things of that kind&quot; was to be widely accepted

The Wexford Rebellion broke not in the securely Catholic south of the county, where there had been greater political organisation, but in the sectarian-divided north and centre which had seen previous agrarian disturbances. The absence of an at least belated United organisation is disputed, but it is agreed with the earliest historian of Wexford rising, Edward Hay, that the trigger was the arrival on 26 May 1798 of the notorious North Cork Militia.

The insurgents swept south through Wexford Town meeting their first reversal at New Ross on 30 May. There followed the massacre of loyalist hostages at Scullabogue and, after a Committee of Public Safety was swept aside, at Wexford Bridge. A &quot;striking resemblance&quot; has been proposed to the 1792 September massacre in Paris&quot;, and it is noted that there were a small number of Catholics among the loyalists killed, and of Protestants among the rebels present. But for loyalists the sectarian nature of the outrages was unquestioned and was used to great effect in the north to secure defections from the republican cause. Much was made of the report that in their initial victory over the North Cork Militia at Oulart Hill the rebels had been commanded by a Catholic priest, Father John Murphy.

After a bombardment and rout of upwards of 20,000 rebels upon Vinegar Hill on 21 June remnants of the &quot;Republic of Wexford&quot; marched north through the Midlandsthe counties thought best organised by the Executivebut few joined them. Those in the region who had turned out on 23 May had already been dispersed. On 20 July, re-joining insurgents in Kildare, the few hundred remaining Wexford men surrendered. All but their leaders benefited from an amnesty intended by the new Lord Lieutenant, Charles Cornwallis to flush out remaining resistance. The law was pushed through the Irish Parliament by the Chancellor, Lord Clare. A staunch defender of the Ascendancy, Clare was determined to separate Catholics from the greater enemy, &quot;Godless Jacobinism.&quot;

Contending with marauding bands of rebel survivors (the Babes in the Wood and the Corcoran gang), Wexford did not see martial law lifted until 1806. In continued expectation of the French, and kept informed by Jemmy Hope of Robert Emmet&#x27;s plans for a renewed uprising, Michael Dwyer sustained a guerrilla resistance in the Wicklow mountains until the end of 1803.

===The North===

The northern executive had not responded to the call on 23 May. The senior Dublin Castle secretary, Edward Cooke, could write: &quot;The quiet of the North is to me unaccountable; but I feel that the Popish tinge of the rebellion, and the treatment of France to Switzerland [the Protestant Cantons were resisting occupation] and America [the Quasi naval war], has really done much, and, in addition to the army, the force of Orange yeomanry is really formidable.&quot;In response to the claim that &quot;in Ulster, there are 50,000 men with arms in their hands, ready to receive the French,&quot; the Westminster Commons was assured that while &quot;almost all Presbyterians... were attached to the popular, or, what has been called, the republican branch of the constitution, they are not to be confounded with Jacobins or banditti&quot;.

When Robert Simms, despairing of French aid, resigned his United Irish command in Antrim on 1 June, McCracken seized the initiative. He proclaimed the First Year of Liberty on 6 June. There were widespread local musters but before they could coordinate, most were burying their arms and returning to their farms and workplaces. The issue had been decided by the following evening. McCracken, commanding a body of four to six thousand, failed, with heavy losses, to seize Antrim Town.

In Down, Dickson, who had stood in for Russell, was arrested with all his &quot;colonels&quot;. Under the command of a young Lisburn draper, Henry Monro, there was a rising on 9 June. Following a successful skirmish at Saintfield several thousand marched on Ballynahinch where they were completely routed.

Shortly before the Battle of Ballynahinch on the 12th, The Defenders of County Down are said, in some reports, to have withdrawn. John Magennis, their county Grand Master, was allegedly dismayed by Munro&#x27;s discounting of a night attack upon the carousing soldiery as &quot;unfair&quot;. Defenders had been present at Antrim, but in the march upon the town tensions with the Presbyterian United Irish may have caused some desertions and a delay in McCracken&#x27;s planned attack.

Confident of being able to exploit tensions between Presbyterians and Catholics, the government not only amnestied the rebel rank-and-file it recruited them for the Yeomanry. On 1 July 1798 in Belfast, the birthplace of the United Irishmen movement, it is said that every man was wearing the Yeomanry&#x27;s red coat. As he enlisted former United Irishmen into his Portglenone Yeomanry Corps, Anglican clergyman Edward Hudson claimed that &quot;the brotherhood of affection is over&quot;. On the eve of following his leader to the gallows, one of McCracken&#x27;s lieutenants, James Dickey, is reported by Henry Joy (a hostile witness) as saying: &quot;the Presbyterians of the north perceived too late that if they had succeeded in their designs, they would ultimately have had to contend with the Roman Catholics&quot;.

A spirit of resistance was nonetheless sustained. The authorities were persuaded in May 1799 that County Down had been &quot;re-regimented and re-officered&quot; and until the spring of 1802, while hopes could still be entertained of a French landing, United veterans continued night-time arms raids and assaults upon loyalists, especially in Antrim. Here, however, they were now organised in Defender cells (from whose oaths references to religion had been notably dropped).

===The West===
On 22 August 1798, 1,100 French landed at Killala in County Mayo. After prevailing in a first engagement, the Races of Castlebar, but unable to make timely contact with a new rising in Longford and Meath, General Humbert surrendered his forces on 8 September. The last action of the rebellion was a slaughter of some 2000 poorly-armed insurgents outside Kilala on the 23rdrefugees from the Armagh Disturbances among themled by a scion of Mayo&#x27;s surviving Catholic gentry, James Joseph MacDonnell.

On 12 October, a second French expedition was intercepted off the coast of Donegal, and Tone was taken captive. Regretting nothing done &quot;to raise three million of my countrymen to the ranks of citizen,&quot; and lamenting only those &quot;atrocities committed on both sides&quot; during his exile, Tone on the eve of execution took his own life.

==The United Irish Directory and renewed conspiracy, 1798–1805==
===Restoring a United network===
After the collapse of the rebellion, the young militants William Putnam McCabe (the son of founding member Thomas McCabe) and Robert Emmet (the younger brother of Thomas Addis Emmet), together with veterans Malachy Delaney and Thomas Wright, sought to restore a United organisation. With the support and advice of state prisoners Thomas Russell and William Dowdall, they recruited on a strictly military basis. Rather than be open to nomination, under the &quot;New Plan of Organisation&quot; the membership would be selected personally by officers acting on the authority of a national directorate.. The strategy was again to solicit a French invasion with the promise of simultaneous risings in Ireland and England. To this end McCabe set out for France in December 1798, stopping first in London.

In England, the united network in had been disrupted in the wake of Coigley&#x27;s arrest in March. But the influx of refugees from Ireland (from Manchester there were reports of as many as 8,000 former rebels living in the city);. the angry response of workers to the Combination Acts, and growing protest over food shortages encouraged renewed organisation among former conspirators. A military system and pike manufacture began to spread across the mill districts of Lancashire and Yorkshire, and regular meetings resumed between county and London delegates resumed. Initiates were given card-printed oaths committing them to both &quot;The Independence of Great Britain and Ireland&quot; and &quot;The Equalisation of Civil, Political and Religious Rights&quot;. All plans, in England and Ireland, however were predicated on a French invasion.

Hopes were dashed by the Treaty of Amiens in March 1802. They revived again when the war resumed in May 1803. But as in 1798, Napoleon had committed elsewhere the naval and military forces that might have made a descent upon Ireland possible. Instead of returning to Ireland, General Humbert had been tasked in 1803 with the re-enslavement of Haiti.

===Emmet&#x27;s Rebellion===
In February 1803 Edward Despard was convicted of conspiring with the united network in London (disaffected soldiers and labourers, many of them Irish) to assassinate the King and seize the Tower of London and to spark insurrection in the mill towns of the north. Undaunted by the defeat of what he acknowledged as &quot;this similar attempt in England,&quot; and with no further consideration of French aid, Emmet planned to seize Dublin Castle.

Through a series of mishaps, the callout in Dublin on 23 July 1803 resulted only in a series of street skirmishes, and in September Emmet followed Despard to the gallows. On the promise of arms, Dwyer&#x27;s guerrilla fighters in Wicklow and men in Kildare had been willing to act, but in the north, Russell and Hope found in United and Defender veterans alike the spirit of rebellion quite broken. Before his arrest, and with all else lost, Emmet asked Myles Byrne to return to Paris to plead afresh for intervention.

In October 1805, any remaining hopes of a return of the French were blasted by the destruction of the French and Spanish fleets at Cape Trafalgar. (It was left to Walter Cox, in 1811, to imagine what might have been: his &quot;Proposed Speech of Bonaparte to [the Irish] Parliament)&quot;. A French Irish Legion (reinforced by 200 former United Irishmen sold by the British government as indentured mine labourers to Prussia, and joined for a time by William Dowdall and Arthur O&#x27;Connor) was redeployed to counter-insurgency in Spain. The United network unwound. McCabe, and other exiles, started seeking terms with the British government for a political surrender and return.

== United Irish in new world exile ==

=== American Society of United Irishmen ===
In October 1799, Castlereagh received a report from Jamaica that many United Irish prisoners, &quot;incautiously drafted&quot; into regiments for service in the West Indies, had taken to the hills to fight alongside the Maroons and &quot;such of the French as were in the island&quot;. The alarm spoke to a fear current both in the West Indies and in the United States (then engaged in its own Quasi War with the French) that Irish Jacobins would conspire in the cause not only of France but also of her putative allies, her former slaves in the Haitian Revolution.

In May 1798, the Federalist (and English) pamphleteer William Cobbett began publishing in Philadelphia accounts of a &quot;Conspiracy, Formed by the United Irishmen, With the Evident Intention of Aiding the Tyrants of France In Subverting the Government of the United States.&quot; Convening in the city&#x27;s African Free School, and admitting free blacks, Irish émigrés had formed a society committed not only to an Irish republic but also to the proposition (to which each member attested) that &quot;a free form of government, and uncontrouled [sic] opinion on all subjects, [are] the common rights of all the human species&quot;. For Cobbett, this was proof sufficient of an intention to organise slave revolts and &quot;thus involve the whole country in rebellion and bloodshed&quot;.

Proposed by Tone&#x27;s confidante in America, a veteran Volunteer, Freemason and United Irishman from Tyrone, James Reynolds, this American Society of United Irishmen appears to have had chapters in several ports-of-entry including, in addition to Philadelphia, Baltimore, New York and Wilmington, although, given the lack of record, it is unlikely that their membership ran into the thousands claimed by Cobbett. It operated a cell-structure, with each section containing no more than eight people meeting weekly to discuss political works and correspondence. Sections sent delegates to state committee, which in turn elected a general executive in Philadelphia. Offices were rotated on a regular basis.

Protesting the Alien and Sedition Acts, in an open letter to George Washington one of their principals, William Duane (former editor in London of the LCS paper &quot;The Telegraph&quot;), defended a vision of citizenship capable both of encompassing &quot;the Jew, the savage, the Mahometan, the idolator, upon all of whom the sun shines equally&quot;, and of conceding &quot;the right of the people to make and alter their constitutions of government&quot;. But by 1800–1801, United men were organised as Jeffersonian Democrats in Hibernian societies, and in the War of 1812 realised what may have been the extent of their ambition: the opportunity to &quot;strike a blow against the British Empire&quot; and, in so doing, to secure &quot;their place in American society&quot;.

=== &quot;United Irish&quot; mutinies in Newfoundland and New South Wales ===
The British colonies of Newfoundland and New South Wales provided the more credible reports of United Irish subversion. In Newfoundland, two-thirds of the colony&#x27;s main settlement, St. John&#x27;s, were Irish, as were most of the island&#x27;s locally-recruited British garrison. In April 1800, there were reports that upwards of 400 men had taken a United Irish oath, and that eighty were resolved to kill their officers and seize their Protestant governors at Sunday service. The mutiny (for which 8 were hanged) may have been less a United Irish plot, than an act of desperation in the face of brutal living conditions and officer tyranny. Yet the Newfoundland Irish would have been aware of the agitation in the homeland for civil equality and political rights. There were reports of communication with United men in Ireland from before &#x27;98 rebellion; of Paine&#x27;s pamphlets circulating in St John&#x27;s; and, despite the war with France, of hundreds of young Waterford men still making a seasonal migration to the island fisheries, among them defeated rebels who are said to have &quot;added fuel to the fire&quot; of local grievance.

In March 1804, stirred by news of Emmet&#x27;s rising, several hundred United Irish convicts in New South Wales tried to seize control of the penal colony and to capture ships for a return to Ireland. Poorly armed, and with their leader Philip Cunningham seized under a flag of truce, the main body of insurgents were routed in an encounter loyalists celebrated as the Second Battle of Vinegar Hill.

It was not the fulfilment of their hopes, but some United Irishmen sought vindication in the Acts of Union that in 1801 abolished the parliament in Dublin and brought Ireland directly under the Crown in Westminster. Archibald Hamilton Rowan, in Hamburg, hailed &quot;the downfall of one of the most corrupt assembles that ever existed&quot;, and predicted that the new United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland would see &quot;the wreck&quot; of the old Ascendancy.

Drennan was at first defiant, urging Irishmen to enter into a &quot;Solemn League and Covenant [to] maintain their country&quot;. But later, in the hope that Westminster might in time realise the original aim of his conspiracy&quot;a full, free and frequent representation of the people&quot;he seemed reconciled. &quot;What&quot;, he reasoned, &quot;is a country justly considered, but a free constitution&quot;?

In his last years, in the 1840s, Jemmy Hope chaired meetings of the Repeal Association. Hope had his doubts about the nature of the movement Daniel O&#x27;Connell launched in the wake of Catholic Emancipation in 1829 to reverse the Acts of Union and to restore the Kingdom of Ireland under the Constitution of 1782. The Presbyterian districts in the north in which he believed &quot;the republican spirit&quot; had run strongest were never again to support an Irish parliament, and in respect of &#x27;98 evinced a form of &quot;collective amnesia&quot;. A radical opposition to Anglican landlordism continued, but it was &quot;carefully differentiated from national separatism&quot;. The United spirit was also quick to wane among Catholics to whom, as Hope noted, the Dissenters in the north appeared to have been &quot;the first to abandon&quot; the &quot;business&quot; they had begun.

In 1799, in Philadelphia, Thomas Ledlie Birch published his &quot;Letter from An Irish Emigrant&quot; (1799) which maintained that the United Irish had been &quot;goaded&quot; into insurrection by &quot;rapines, burnings, rapes, murders, and other sheddings of blood&quot;. But, in Ireland the first public rehabilitation (preceding Madden&#x27;s monumental &quot;The United Irishmen, their lives and times&quot;) came in 1831 with &quot;The Life and Death of Lord Edward Fitzgerald&quot; (1831), described by the author, Ireland&#x27;s national bard, Thomas Moore as a &quot;justification of the men of &#x27;98the &quot;ultimi Romanorum&quot; of our country&quot;. In 1832 Moore declined a voter petition to stand as a Repeal candidate. He protested that he could not pretend, with O&#x27;Connell, that the consequence of Repeal would be anything less than a real separation from Great Britain, something possible only if Catholics were again &quot;joined by dissenters&quot;.

In breaking with O&#x27;Connell, Young Irelanders proposed to forge this renewed unity in the struggle for tenant rights and land ownership. Gavan Duffy recalled from his youth a Quaker neighbour who had been a United Irishman and had laughed at the idea that the issue was kings and governments. What mattered was the land from which the people got their bread. Instead of indulging &quot;Gallic passions&quot; and singing La Marseillaise, what the men of &#x27;98 should have borrowed from the French was &quot;their sagacious idea of bundling the landlords out of doors and putting tenants in their shoes&quot;.

For O&#x27;Connell, who believed Dublin Castle had deliberately fomented the rebellion as a pretext for abolishing the Irish parliament, unionist sentiment in the north was simply the product of continued Protestant privilege. Were this abolished with the repeal of the Union, &quot;the Protestant community would with little delay melt into the overwhelming majority of the Irish nation&quot;. For republicans, it remained the &quot;sad irony&quot; of 1798 that by a system of often marginal advantages &quot;the descendants of the republican rebels&quot; were &quot;persuaded&quot; to regard &quot;the &#x27;connection with England&#x27; as the guarantee of [their] dignity and rights.&quot;

Unionists argued that, focused on breaking &quot;the connection with England&quot;, Repealers, Home-Rulers and republicans misrepresented the true object of the United Irishmen. There was, they insisted, no irony and no paradox in descendants of the United Irish entering a Solemn League of Covenant to maintain their country as the United Kingdom. Had their forefathers been offered a Union under the constitution as it later developed there would have been &quot;no rebellion&quot;: &quot;Catholic Emancipation, a Reformed Parliament, a responsible Executive and equal laws for the whole Irish peoplethese&quot;, they maintain, were &quot;the real objects of the United Irishmen&quot;. Later, in Northern Ireland, Edna Longley noted the tendency of Protestant writers to &quot;use 1798 rather than 1916 as the radical benchmark&quot;and as one which might suggest &quot;difference rather than solidarity&quot; with the new Irish state in the south.

Noting that &quot;the United Irishmen were, after all, anything but united&quot;, a major history of the movement observes that &quot;the legacy of the United Irishmen, however interpreted, has proved as divisive for later generations as the practice of this so-called union did in the 1790s&quot;. Writing on the 200th anniversary of the uprising, the historian John A. Murphy, suggests that what can be commemoratedother differences asideis &quot;the first time entrance of the plain people on the stage of Irish history.&quot; The United Irishmen had &quot;promoted egalitarianism and the smashing of deference.&quot; After their defeat in the Battle of the Big Cross in June 1798 (the only United uprising in Munster where local Defenderism, the &quot;Rightboys&quot;, had been crushed a decade before, and a strong Cork city United organization had been broken in April), the Clonakilty Catholics were harangued in their chapel by Rev. Horace Townsend, chief magistrate and Protestant vicar.Reflect with remorse and repentance on the wicked and sanguinary designs for which you forged so many abominable pikes... Surely you are not foolish enough to think that society could exist without landlords, without magistrates, without rulers... Be persuaded that it is quite out of the sphere of country farmers and labourers to set up as politicians, reformers, and law makers... What Townsend and the Ascendancy feared most of all were &quot;the manifestations of an incipient Irish democracy&quot;. &quot;In the long run,&quot; concludes Murphy, &quot;the emergence of such a democracy, rudimentary and inchoate, was the most significant legacy&quot; of the United Irishmen.

<text>Padgate is a suburb of the town of Warrington, in the civil parish of Poulton-with-Fearnhead, in the Warrington district, in the ceremonial county of Cheshire, England.

==History==

===Overview===
Historically part of Lancashire, until 1838 Padgate was an area of farmland in the Fearnhead district. It was only with the establishment of a parish and the building of Christ Church Padgate that a recognisable community arose. 
Following boundary changes in 1974, Padgate, along with the rest of Warrington, became part of the county of Cheshire. It is now a largely residential, suburban district. It was the site of an R.A.F training camp and home of a teacher training college, now the Padgate Campus of the University of Chester.

Padgate has a railway station, three churches, a number of schools, a community centre and, next to the railway line, a large area of land and playing fields known as Bennett&#x27;s Recreation Ground. This was the home of the Woolston Rovers rugby league side and also the Cheshire Cadets Drum and Bugle Corps with their headquarters Kennedy Hall. This is also home to Greenall&#x27;s Padgate St Oswald&#x27;s reserves football team of the Mid Cheshire Football League reserve division. Greenall&#x27;s Padgate St Oswald&#x27;s first team play at Tetley Walker&#x27;s Club, Long Lane, Warrington.
The centre of Padgate (the area around the railway station, Christ Church and the community centre) is separated from the main commercial centre by Padgate Lane, which connects the two, approximately three quarters of a mile apart.

Padgate is in the parliamentary constituency of Warrington North.

Geographically the area is on the east side of Warrington. It is north of the River Mersey and enclosed to the east by the M6 motorway. Topographically the land in the area is flat, being in the Mersey valley.

Padgate Brook, a tributary of the Mersey, runs to the western edge of Padgate, and is in turn fed by numerous smaller waterways (Spittle Brook, Blackbrook, Spa Brook, Cinnamon Brook, Cross Brook, Cockshot Burn) originating in Peel Hall Meadows and other outlying rural stretches of land to the north. To the east, Birchwood Brook also feeds the Mersey.

===RAF Station===
During the Second World War, Padgate had a small RAF Station. It was used as a training camp for National Servicemen after the war. The camp was built on the site of a former Quaker Farm, the entrance to which was situated on Station Road.

The site of the former RAF station was demolished in the mid-to-late 1970s, and has since been largely covered by a housing estate, bordered by Bennett&#x27;s Rec and the railway line to the south, Fearnhead to the north-east, and Blackbrook and Cinnamon Brow to the north. Padgate Academy is also sited on this land.

The main entrance to the RAF camp was on what is now Station Road North. Although the RAF site is now largely invisible its legacy lives on in local place names – Insall Road running east–west in parallel to the A574 is named after the one-time commanding officer of the site, and the local high school was known from 2009 to 2013 as Lysander Community High, the Westland Lysander being one of the aircraft linked to the former RAF base.

Remnants of the camp&#x27;s presence can still be seen in some parts of the land, for example the brickwork from the rifle range can still be seen close to the railway footbridge in the south-west corner of the former site.

===University of Chester Padgate Campus===
The university campus (which despite being known as the Padgate Campus is in fact in the neighbouring village of Fearnhead) belonging to the University of Chester was used as a camp for Canadian servicemen during the Second World War. In 1946, it became a teacher training college and in the late 1960s was re-named to Padgate College of Education. In honour of the historical usage, part of the site was named Canada Hall.

The campus is now home to 384 students. A variety of degree courses are on offer, including degrees in journalism and sport-related subjects. The campus houses an SU bar named bar twenty ten. There are 8 halls of residence and also a residential cul-de-sac called College Close.

The University of Chester announced the closure of the campus on 22 January 2021 outlining intentions to relocate teaching to buildings in Warrington town centre.

==Geography==
Five kilometres (3 mi) east of Warrington town centre, Padgate lies between the Liverpool and Greater Manchester urban areas. It is 35 kilometres (22 mi) east of Liverpool, 26 kilometres (16 mi) west of Manchester, and 47 kilometres (29 mi) northeast of Chester. 
The suburb is crossed to the south by the river Mersey and is close to the Manchester Ship Canal. A small tributary of the Mersey, Padgate Brook, runs through it roughly north–south, joining the Mersey to the south.

==Main sights==
Its parish church, Christ Church (1838), is a listed building, the former rectory (built approximately 2 years later) associated with the church is locally listed. Christ Church has an affiliated Church of England Primary School nearby which also dates, in its present form, from around the same time. In 2016, work commenced on the building of a new vicarage in the grounds adjacent to the church. This new vicarage became the residence of the vicar in early 2017, and the old rectory is now a private residence.

There are two other churches in the area: Padgate Methodist Church and St. Oswald&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church.

==Transport==
Padgate has an unstaffed railway station on the Manchester-Liverpool line served by the local stopping service. Up until the mid-1970s, the station was fully staffed and a row of cottages (still extant) next to the station were designed as residences for the station staff.

The M6 motorway is located some km east, and nearest exit is &quot;Warrington-Irlam-A57&quot;. The A roads serving Padgate are the A50, A57 and A574.

<doc id="491416" wikidata="Q77204" url="?curid=491416" title="Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff">
<text>Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff (10 March 178826 November 1857) was a German poet, novelist, playwright, literary critic, translator, and anthologist. Eichendorff was one of the major writers and critics of Romanticism. Ever since their publication and up to the present day, some of his works have been very popular in German-speaking Europe.

Eichendorff first became famous for his 1826 novella &quot;Aus dem Leben eines Taugenichts&quot; (freely translated: &quot;Memoirs of a Good-for-Nothing&quot;) and his poems. The &quot;Memoirs of a Good-for-Nothing&quot; is a typical Romantic novella whose main themes are wanderlust and love. The protagonist, the son of a miller, rejects his father&#x27;s trade and becomes a gardener at a Viennese palace where he subsequently falls in love with the local duke&#x27;s daughter. As, with his lowly status, she is unattainable for him, he escapes to Italy – only to return and learn that she is the duke&#x27;s adopted daughter, and thus within his social reach. With its combination of dream world and realism, &quot;Memoirs of a Good-for-Nothing&quot; is considered to be a high point of Romantic fiction. One critic stated that Eichendorff&#x27;s &quot;Good-for-Nothing&quot; is the &quot;personification of love of nature and an obsession with hiking.&quot; Thomas Mann called Eichendorff&#x27;s &quot;Good-for-Nothing&quot; a combination of &quot;the purity of the folk song and the fairy tale.&quot;

Many of Eichendorff&#x27;s poems were first published as integral parts of his novellas and stories, where they are often performed in song by one of the protagonists. The novella &quot;Good-for-Nothing&quot; alone contains 54 poems.

== Biography ==

=== Origin and early youth ===
Eichendorff, a descendant of an old noble family, was born in 1788 at Schloß Lubowitz near Ratibor (now Racibórz, Poland) in Upper Silesia, at that time part of the Kingdom of Prussia. His parents were the Prussian officer Adolf Freiherr von Eichendorff (1756–1818) and his wife, Karoline née Freiin von Kloche (1766–1822), who came from an aristocratic Roman Catholic family. Eichendorff sold the family estates in Deutsch-Krawarn, Kauthen, and Wrbkau and acquired Lubowitz Castle from his mother-in-law. The castle&#x27;s Rococo reconstruction, which was begun by her, was very expensive and almost bankrupted the family. Young Joseph was close to his older brother Wilhelm (1786–1849). From 1793 to 1801, they were home-schooled by tutor Bernhard Heinke. Joseph began writing diaries as early as 1798, witnesses to his budding literary career. The diaries present many insights into the development of the young writer, ranging from simple statements about the weather to notes about finances to early poems. At a young age, Eichendorff was already well aware of his parents&#x27; financial straits. On 19 June 1801, the thirteen-year old noted in his diary: &quot;Father travelled to Breslau, on the run from his creditors,&quot; adding on 24 June, &quot;mom become terribly faint.&quot; With his brother Wilhelm, Joseph attended the Catholic Matthias Gymnasium in Breslau (1801–1804). While previously preferring chapbooks, he was now introduced to the poetry of Matthias Claudius and Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;La Henriade&quot;, an epic poem about the last part of the wars of religion and Henry IV of France in ten songs. In 1804 his sister Luise Antonie Nepomucene Johanna was born (died 1883), who was to become a friend of Austrian writer Adalbert Stifter. After their final exams, both brothers attended lectures at the University of Breslau and the Protestant Maria-Magdalena-Gymnasium. Eichendorff&#x27;s diary from this time shows that he valued formal education much less than the theatre, recording 126 plays and concerts visited. His love for Mozart also goes back to these days. Joseph himself seems to have been a talented actor and his brother Wilhelm a good singer and guitar player.

=== College days ===
Together with his brother Wilhelm, Joseph studied law and the humanities in Halle an der Saale (1805–1806), a city near Jena, which was a focal point of the &quot;Frühromantik&quot; (Early Romantics). The brothers frequently attended the theatre of Lauchstädt, 13 km where the Weimar court theatrical company performed plays by Goethe.
In October 1806 Napoleon&#x27;s troops took Halle and teaching at the university ceased. To complete their studies, Wilhelm and Joseph went to the University of Heidelberg in 1807, another important centre of Romanticism. Here Eichendorff befriended romantic poet Otto Heinrich von Loeben (1786–1825), met Achim von Arnim (1781–1831) and possibly Clemens Brentano (1778–1842). 
In Heidelberg, Eichendorff heard lectures by Joseph Görres, a leading member of the Heidelberg Romantic group, a &quot;hermitic magician&quot; and &quot;formative impression&quot;, as Eichendorff later explained.
In 1808 the brothers finished their degrees, after which they undertook an educational journey to Paris, Vienna, and Berlin. In Berlin they came into closer contact with Romantic writers such as Clemens Brentano, Adam Müller, and Heinrich von Kleist. To further their professional prospects, they travelled to Vienna in 1810, where they concluded their studies with a state examination diploma. Wilhelm procured employment in the Austrian civil service, while Joseph went back home to help his father with managing the estate.

=== Love affairs ===
From Eichendorff&#x27;s diaries we know about his love for a girl, Amalie Schaffner, and another love affair in 1807–08 during his student days in Heidelberg with one Käthchen Förster. His deep sorrow about the unrequitted love for the nineteen-year-old daughter of a cellarman inspired Eichendorff to one of his most famous poems, &quot;Das zerbrochene Ringlein&quot; (&quot;The Broken Ring&quot;).

=== Military service ===
In his deep desperation over this unhappy infatuation, Eichendorff craved death in military exploits as mentioned in his poem Das zerbrochene Ringlein:
Although Chase&#x27;s translation weakens the second line from &quot;blut’ge Schlacht&quot; (&quot;bloody battle&quot;) to &quot;in fight&quot; this, actually, happens to be much closer to the historical truth, since Eichendorff&#x27;s participation in the Lützow Free Corps seems to be a myth – in spite of some authorities asserting the contrary.

In 1813, when conflict flared up again, Eichendorff tried to join the struggle against Napoleon, however he lacked the funds to purchase a uniform, gun, or horse, and, when he finally managed to get the money necessary, the war was all but over.

=== Betrothal, marriage and family life ===
His parents, to save the indebted family estate, hoped that Eichendorff would marry a wealthy heiress, however he fell in love with Aloysia von Larisch (1792–1855), called &#x27;Luise&#x27;, the seventeen-year-old daughter of a prominent, yet impoverished Catholic family of nobles. The betrothal took place in 1809, the same year Eichendorff went to Berlin to take up a profession there. In 1815, the couple was married in Breslau&#x27;s St. Vinzenz church and that same year Eichendorff&#x27;s son Hermann was born, followed in 1819 by their daughter Therese. In 1818, Eichendorff&#x27;s father died and in 1822 his mother. The death of his mother resulted in the final loss of all the family&#x27;s estates in Silesia.
=== Child mortality ===
During the period, infant mortality was very high. Both Eichendorff&#x27;s brother Gustav (born 1800) and his sister Louise Antonie (born 1799) died in 1803 at a very young age, as did two of Eichendorff&#x27;s daughters between 1822 and 1832. The poet expressed the parental sorrow after this loss in the famous cycle &quot;Auf meines Kindes Tod&quot;. One of the poems in this series conveys an especially powerful sense of loss in this era:
=== Travels of a transferee ===

With his literary figure of the &quot;Good-for-Nothing&quot; Eichendorff created &quot;the&quot; paradigm of the wanderer. The motif itself had been central to romanticism since Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder and Ludwig Tieck undertook their famous &quot;Pfingstwanderung&quot; (Whitsun excursion) in the Fichtel Mountains in 1793, an event that began the Romantic movement. Travels through Germany, Austria, and France rounded off Eichendorff&#x27;s education, however, he himself was not much of a hiker. Apart from some extensive marches on foot during his school and college days (for example from Halle to Leipzig, to see popular actor Iffland), he only undertook one lengthy tour, traversing for seventeen days the Harz mountains with his brother in 1805, a trip partly undertaken using the stagecoach, as witnessed by his diary. Eichendorff was less of a romantic wanderer, but rather displaced again and again by changes of location necessitated by his official activities. The following trips, mainly undertaken by coach or boat, are documented:
=== Eichendorff as civil servant ===
 Eichendorff worked in various capacities as Prussian government administrator. His career began in 1816 as unpaid clerk in Breslau. In November 1819, he was appointed assessor and in 1820 consistorial councilor for West and East Prussia in Danzig, with an initial annual salary of 1200 thalers. In April 1824, Eichendorff was relocated to Königsberg as &quot;Oberpräsidialrat&quot; (chief administrator) with an annual salary of 1600 thalers. In 1821, Eichendorff was appointed school inspector and, in 1824, &quot;Oberpräsidialrat&quot; in Königsberg. In 1831, he moved his family to Berlin, where he worked as Privy Councilor for the Foreign Ministry until his retirement in 1844.

=== Death and burial ===

Eichendorff&#x27;s brother Wilhelm died in 1849 in Innsbruck. That same year, there was a Republican uprising and the Eichendorffs fled to Meißen and Köthen, where a little house was purchased for his daughter Therese (now a von Besserer-Dahlfingen) in 1854. In 1855, he was much affected by the death of his wife. In September he traveled to Sedlnitz for the christening of his grandchild. Shortly after he made his very last trip, dying of pneumonia on 26 November 1857 in Neiße. He was buried the next day with his wife.

== Growth of a Romanticist ==
=== Artistic influences ===

The two writers who had the greatest early influence on Eichendorff&#x27;s artistic development were Friedrich Schlegel, who established the term &quot;romantisch&quot; (romantic) in German literature, and Joseph Görres. While the writers who gathered around Schlegel inclined more to philosophy and aesthetic theory, the adherents of Görres became mainly known as writers of poetry and stories. Both movements, however, greatly influenced intellectual life in Germany by emphasising the individual, the subjective, the irrational, the imaginative, the personal, the spontaneous, the emotional, the visionary, and the transcendental over classical precepts. One of their fundamental ideas was the &quot;unity of poetry and life&quot;.

Eichendorff shared Schlegel&#x27;s view that the world was a naturally and eternally &quot;self-forming artwork&quot;, Eichendorff himself used the metaphor that &quot;nature [was] a great picture book, which the good Lord has pitched for us outside.&quot; Arnim&#x27;s and Brentano&#x27;s studies and interpretations of the Volkslied (folk song) deeply influenced Eichendorff&#x27;s own poetry and poetology.

Arnim&#x27;s and Brentano&#x27;s anthology &quot;Des Knaben Wunderhorn: Alte deutsche Lieder&quot;, a collection of songs about love, soldiers, wandering, as well as children&#x27;s songs, was an important source for the Romantic movement. Similar to other early 19th-century anthologists such as Thomas Percy, Arnim and Brentano edited and rewrote the poems in they collected. &quot;Everything in the world happens because of poetry, to live life with an increased sense and history is the expression of this general poetry of the human race, the fate performs this great spectacle,&quot; is what Arnim said in a letter to Brentano (9 July 1802).

== Eichendorff&#x27;s poetical style ==
=== Range ===
Although Eichendorffs poetry includes many metric forms ranging from very simple elegiac couplets and stanzas to sonnets, his main artistic focus was on poems imitating folk songs.
A comparison of forms shows that Eichendorff&#x27;s &quot;lyricism&quot; is &quot;directly influenced by Brentano and Arnim&quot;.

=== Naturalness and artificiality ===
Following the model of &quot;Des Knaben Wunderhorn&quot;, Eichendorff uses simple words (&#x27;naturalness&#x27;), adding more meaning (&#x27;artificiality&#x27;) than dictionary definitions would indicate. In this sense, &quot;His words are rich in connotative power, in imaginative appeal and in sound.&quot;

=== Emblematic imagery ===
Certain expressions and formulas used by Eichendorff, which are sometimes characterised by critics as pure cliché, actually represent a conscious reduction in favour of emblematics. In Görres&#x27; poetology &quot;nature is speaking&quot; us. But before it can happen, the wonderful song sleeping in each thing must be woken up by the poet&#x27;s word: One notable example used by Eichendorff is the &quot;Zauberwort&quot; (magic word) – and one of Eichendorff&#x27;s most celebrated poems, the four-line stanza &quot;Wünschelrute&quot; (divining rod), is about finding such a &quot;Zauberwort&quot;:

=== Main motifs ===

The titles of Eichendorff&#x27;s poems show that, besides the motif of wandering, the two other main motifs of his poetry were the passing of time (transience) and nostalgia. Time, for Eichendorff, is not just a natural phenomenon but, as Marcin Worbs elaborated: &quot;Each day and each of our nights has a metaphysical dimension.&quot; The morning, on the other hand, evokes the impression that &quot;all nature had been created just in this very moment,&quot; while the evening often acts as a &quot;mysterium mortis&quot; with the persona pondering transience and death.

Eichendorff&#x27;s other main motif, nostalgia, is described by some critic as a phenomenon of infinity. However, there is a number of different interpretations. According to Helmut Illbruck: The &quot;simple-minded Taugenichts (...) feels continually homesick and can never come to rest.&quot; Katja Löhr distinguishes between nostalgia as an emotion consisting of two components — longing and melancholy: &quot;The inner emotion of longing is to long for, the inner emotion of melancholy is to mourn. As an expression of deep reflection, longing corresponds with intuition (&quot;Ahnen&quot;), grieving with memory.&quot; Theodor W. Adorno, who set out to rescue Eichendorff from his misled conservative admirers, attested: &quot;He was not a poet of the homeland, but rather a poet of homesickness&quot;. In sharp contrast, Natias Neutert saw in Eichendorff&#x27;s nostalgia a dialectical unity of an &quot;unstable equilibrium of homesickness and wanderlust at once&quot;.

== Religiosity ==
For a long time it had been argued that Eichendorff&#x27;s view of Romanticism had been subordinate to religious beliefs. More recently, however, Christoph Hollender has noted that Eichendorff&#x27;s late religious and political writings were commissioned works, while his poetry represents a highly personal perspective.

== Eichendorff&#x27;s own résumé ==
Eichendorff summed up the Romantic epoch stating that it &quot;soared like a magnificent rocket sparkling up into the sky, and after shortly and wonderfully lighting up the night, it exploded overhead into a thousand colorful stars.&quot;

== Legacy ==
While other authors (such as Ludwig Tieck, Caroline de la Motte Fouqué, Clemens Brentano and Bettina von Arnim) adapted the themes and styles of their writing to the emerging realism, Eichendorff &quot;stayed true to the emblematic universe of his literary Romanticism right through to the 1850s,&quot; Adorno stated: &quot;Unconsciously Eichendorff&#x27;s unleashed romanticism leads right up to the threshold of modernism&quot;.

== Set to music ==

With approximately 5000 musical settings, Eichendorff is the most popular German poet set into music. &quot;The magical, enchanting lyricism of his poetry almost seems to be music itself,&quot; as it is praised. His poems have been set to music by many composers, including Schumann, Mendelssohn, Max Bruch, Johannes Brahms, Hugo Wolf, Didia Saint Georges, Richard Strauss, Hans Pfitzner, Pauline Volkstein,Hermann Zilcher, Alexander Zemlinsky, Max Reger, and even Friedrich Nietzsche.

His poems also inspired orchestral music, such as Reger&#x27;s &quot;Eine romantische Suite&quot; as well as electronic arrangements by Qntal.

<text>Sir Thomas Muir (25 August 1844 – 21 March 1934) was a Scottish mathematician, remembered as an authority on determinants.

==Life==

He was born in Stonebyres in South Lanarkshire, and brought up in the small town of Biggar. He was educated at Wishaw Public School.

At the University of Glasgow he changed his studies from classics to mathematics after advice from the future Lord Kelvin. After graduating he held positions at the University of St Andrews and the University of Glasgow. From 1874 to 1892 he taught at Glasgow High School. In 1882 he published &quot;Treatise on the theory of determinants&quot;; then in 1890 he published a &quot;History of determinants&quot;. In his 1882 work, Muir rediscovered an important lemma that was first proved by Cayley 35 years earlier: In Glasgow he lived at Beechcroft in the Bothwell district.

In 1874 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, His proposers were William Thomson, Lord Kelvin, Hugh Blackburn, Philip Kelland and Peter Guthrie Tait. He won the Society&#x27;s Keith Prize for 1881-1883 and a second time in 1895–1897. He served as the Society&#x27;s Vice President 1888 to 1891. He won the Gunning Victoria Jubilee Prize for 1912 to 1916.

From 1892 to 1915 he was in South Africa as Superintendent General of Education, and also working at the University of the Cape. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and in 1900 a Fellow of the Royal Society. He was installed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1901 and knighted by King George V in the 1915 Birthday Honours.

Shortly after his arrival at the Cape, the Uitenhage Public School in the Eastern Cape, originally established in 1822 by Scots educator James Rose Innes, was renamed the Muir Academy, later becoming Muir College, which is nowadays believed to be the oldest secondary school in South Africa. The progressive development of this and other schools during Muir&#x27;s tenure as Superintendent-General of Education was strongly influenced by Muir&#x27;s belief in the importance of subjects requiring manual dexterity (woodwork and needlework) and the teaching of mathematics, science and nature study. He also improved the training of teachers - when he arrived in the Cape there was only one training college, but when he retired 23 years later there were twelve.

From 1906 onwards he published a five-volume expansion of his history of determinants, the final part (1929) taking the theory to 1920. A further book followed in 1930.

He died on 21 March 1934 in Rondebosch in South Africa.

His name now attaches to a duality theorem on relations between minors. In more abstract language, it is a general result on the equations defining Grassmannians as algebraic varieties.

==Family==

In 1876 he married Margaret Bell. The distinguished geophysicist Athelstan Spilhaus was their grandson.

<text>Vištytis (, , Yiddish: ווישטינעץ &quot;Vishtinets&quot;) is a small town in Marijampolė County, Vilkaviškis District Municipality in southwestern Lithuania on the border with Russia and close to the border with Poland. It is the administrative center of Vištytis eldership (seniūnija). 

==Geography==
The town is situated on the northeastern shore of Lake Vištytis, close to the Russian border (Kaliningrad Oblast). 

The town has preserved its street structure and market square since the 18th century. Vištytis Regional Park is near the town. Southwest is Vištytis hill fort, and in a nearby village, Nebūtkiemis is a big &quot;Vištytis&quot; stone, preserved geological artifact.

==History==

Vištytis was established in the first half of the 16th century, on the border with the Duchy of Prussia. The first mention of the Višytis manor dates from 1538. Around it a settlement of Lithuanian, Polish and German inhabitants started to grow rapidly. On September 8, 1570, Sigismund II Augustus, in his capacity as Grand Duke of Lithuania, granted Vištytis town rights and coat of arms. It was a royal town of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was the first town in the region. In 1589, local starost Krzysztof Jeśman granted land to Jews to build a synagogue.

In 1776 Vištytis lost its town rights, although some administration remained in the town, as it is known from the records in 1785 and 1790. Town representatives participated in the Great Sejm and succeeded in regaining town rights, although it did not get a royal privilege. That caused conflict with local elders, and the case was taken to the court. The outcome of the court is not clear, but the town preserved some of autonomy in the 19th century.

Following the Third Partition of Poland, it was annexed by Prussia in 1795. In 1807, it became part of the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw, and after its dissolution in 1815, it became part of newly established Russian-controlled Congress Poland. In the 19th century, a major industry in Vištytis was the manufacture of brushes. After the railroad line from Königsberg to Russia was constructed in 1861 through Kybartai, some kilometers to the north, the town declined rapidly. Beginning in the 1850s, a significant number of the town&#x27;s Jews emigrated to Germany, the United States, and South Africa. As of 1890, 31% of the city&#x27;s registered residents were in emigration in the US and Germany.

===20th century===

During World War I, in 1915, the town was devastated by Imperial Russian troops retreating after the Winter Battle of the Masurian Lakes, and afterwards it was occupied by Germany.

With the end of World War I, Poland and Lithuania regained independence as separate countries, and the town was disputed. Local Poles formed a Polish municipal committee headed by wójt Józef Kałwajć and gathered over 1,000 signatures on a petition to incorporate the town to Poland, wanting to belong administratively to Suwałki County, while local Lithuanians formed a Lithuanian municipal committee, recognizing the sovereignty of Vilkaviškis County within Lithuania. The rival Polish-Lithuanian dual authority lasted until May 1919, when a Lithuanian militia entered the town and forced the Polish committee to disband and recognize the local Lithuanian authorities. Local Poles continued passive resistance to Lithuanian authority.

After the 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, the Lithuanian territory up to the border at Vištytis was occupied by Soviet forces. Immediately after the launch of Operation Barbarossa on 22 June 1941, the town was conquered by Wehrmacht forces. During the Holocaust, all of Vištytis&#x27; Jews were murdered, mainly by local collaborators in the town. The exact number murdered is unclear; estimates range from 200 - 400 Jews (out of the town&#x27;s general population of around 1000). First the men were shot, then the women - but, to save bullets, the Jewish children were killed by having their heads bashed against the trees in the town park. A memorial to the victims was later erected by the Soviets near a windmill called Grist Mill, but the plaque made no mention that those buried in the nearby fields were Jews. Later, a &#x27;Jewish&#x27; tombstone was erected that noted what happened.

Renewed city coat of arms was granted by the President of Lithuania on May 3, 1999.

<text>Baron Skelmersdale, of Skelmersdale in the County Palatine of Lancaster, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1828 for the former Member of Parliament for Westbury, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Clitheroe and Dover, Edward Bootle-Wilbraham. His grandson, the second Baron (the son of the Hon. Richard Bootle-Wilbraham), was a Conservative politician and served in the Conservative administrations of Disraeli and Lord Salisbury. In 1880 he was created Earl of Lathom, in the County Palatine of Lancaster, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. However, the earldom became extinct on the death of his grandson, the third Earl, in 1930. The barony passed to the last Earl&#x27;s second cousin once removed, the fifth Baron, who was the grandson of a younger son of the first Baron. On his death, the title was inherited by his cousin, the sixth Baron.

His son, the seventh Baron, served in junior ministerial positions in the Conservative administrations of Margaret Thatcher and was as one of the ninety-two elected hereditary peers allowed to remain after the passing of the House of Lords Act of 1999. , the title is held by his son, the eighth Baron, who succeeded him in that year.

<text>Big Brother Brasil is the Brazilian version of the &quot;Big Brother&quot; reality franchised television show based on the original Dutch television series of the same name, that was created in 1997 by John de Mol Jr.. It is the second one with more finished seasons (only after the American version) and the only one with more than 20 years of uninterrupted annual transmission in the same channel.

The show is based on a group of strangers, known as housemates, living together twenty-four hours a day in the &quot;Big Brother&quot; house, isolated from the outside world (primarily from mass media, such as newspapers, telephones, television and the internet) while having all their steps followed by cameras around-the-clock, with no privacy for three months.

The housemates compete for the chance to win the grand prize by avoiding weekly eviction, until the last housemate remains at the end of the season that can claim the grand prize. The show&#x27;s current host is journalist Tadeu Schmidt.

TV Globo&#x27;s website and a Globo-owned pay-per-view channel offer round-the-clock coverage. Sabrina Sato (season 3) used to be one of the hosts of Panico na TV and now hosts her own TV program, Juliana Alves (season 3) and Grazi Massafera (season 5) are soap opera actresses at TV Globo, Íris Stefanelli and Flávia Vianna (season 7) were reporters for many years in a show called TV Fama. The five can be considered the most successful contestants of the show, although none of them have won the show. The only three winners who enjoyed success after the show are Jean Wyllys, who had been following a political career as a federal deputy since winning the fifth season until leaving Brazil in 2019. Thelma Assis, who became a TV presenter for the station, in addition to having contracts with several brands. And Juliette Freire who became an internet phenomenon by reaching 24 million Instagram followers during the show&#x27;s 21st season. After the show, she devoted herself to building a successful music career.

The twentieth season of the show had the biggest participation in the world of votings in an eviction, reaching over 1.5 billion votes. The previous record, also achieved by &quot;Big Brother Brasil&quot; in the same season, was 416 million votes. Advertising quotas reached R$78 million, with a total collection of R$530 million.

== The House ==
The &quot;Big Brother Brasil&quot; house is located inside Estúdios Globo, the Globo&#x27;s production center in Rio de Janeiro. The house is considered by most &quot;Big Brother&quot; specialists as the biggest and most extravagant house of all &quot;Big Brothers&quot;.

The external area of the house is approximately 700 square meters (m2) while the internal areas is about 200 m2. The house has three bedrooms (two for the regular contestants and one for week&#x27;s Head of Household), a living room, two bathrooms (one inside a bedroom), a big garden, two kitchens (one for the Haves and another for the Have-nots), a gym, a Jacuzzi, a pool, a laundry room, a Diary Room and a separate area, called &quot;another dimension&quot;, which was once the white bedroom (ninth and tenth seasons) and the surprise bedroom (eleventh season).

== Show format ==
=== Launch night ===
On the night of the Live Launch several members of the public, who have passed through several audition processes, enter the House to become Housemates of the Big Brother House. Once inside the house the Housemates will live together and have no contact with the outside world.

=== Head of Household (Líder) ===
Except in the first week, after each eviction (Portuguese: &quot;paredão&quot;, a term which literally means &quot;big wall&quot;), housemates compete to become the &quot;Head of Household&quot; (&quot;líder&quot;), by winning a weekly physical endurance challenge, based on a specific skill, a general knowledge quiz or, even sometimes through a luck event.

The &quot;Líder&quot; receives perks such as their own private bedroom, photos or gifts from home, and maid service. The &quot;Líder&quot; is awarded immunity from the week&#x27;s nomination (except in the fifteenth and sixteenth seasons where instead the &quot;Líder&quot; won a cash prize) and also has the power to directly nominate one housemate for eviction, in addition, the &quot;Líder&quot; is the tiebreaker for the house&#x27;s nomination vote. Although one housemate normally retains the Leader rewards and responsibilities for the week, exceptions have occurred.

In a &quot;double eviction&quot; week, the first &quot;Líder&quot; only reigns for a short period (between an hour and three days) while the second &quot;Líder&quot; reigns for the rest of the week. When this occurs, the first &quot;Líder&quot; is normally not provided the perks awarded in a normal eviction week. Another exception is when two housemates share the &quot;Líder&quot; position, such as in the third week of the sixth season and in the first week of the seventh season.

=== Power of Immunity ===
In the third season, a weekly &quot;Power of Immunity&quot; (&quot;anjo&quot;, a term which literally means &quot;angel&quot;) is introduced and determined. This housemate may choose any other housemate to protect from facing the eviction. However, in the seventh season, another selected house mate was given the &quot;Power of Veto&quot; to nullify the saving power.

Since the eighth season, Power of Immunity winner was also given a bad side (called &quot;monstro&quot;, a term which literally means &quot;monster&quot;), where that housemate, besides protecting someone from elimination, must &quot;punish&quot; one or more contestants, obliging them to do an unpleasing task or forbidding them to go to the party.

=== Estaleca or food competition ===
On Sundays, a competition allow the housemates to win food (until the fourth season) or estalecas (from the fifth season onwards) for the week. Most competitions are games of skill, although the housemates may work individually, in teams, or as one group.

Introduced in the fifth season, the &quot;Estaleca&quot; (Z$) is the official currency of the house. Each contestant has their own credit card with a set amount of Estalecas. Contestants may use their currency to purchase food for the house.

The winners of the week&#x27;s Estaleca competition earn the right to do all the shopping, choosing what the entire house will eat for the upcoming week. As in the real stock market, the Estalecas can suffer some speculative attacks and thus the value of the groceries may inflate or deflate.

=== Sunday live nominations ===
First the PoI winner and HoH nominate their choices for their respective abilities. Then, each one of the remaining contestants go into the Diary Room, and vote on the contestant they wish to face an elimination match. The highest voted contestant is sent to the elimination match to face the person nominated by the HoH and an audience poll starts (either by telephone, SMS or Internet) to pick which of the nominated contestants shall be eliminated.

Since the twenty season, the nominated housemates compete against each other for one last chance to save themselves from eviction. The housemates nominated by the HoH are not eligible to compete and are guaranteed to face Brazil&#x27;s vote.

=== Tuesday live eviction ===
On Eviction Night, the poll result is shown and the highest voted housemate is eliminated and evicted from the house. The evicted housemate must to get ready to leave immediately. Once they leave the House they are greeted by the live crowd and the show host.

=== Live Final and the winner ===
In the Live Final, only two to three housemates remain in the house, after surviving numerous evictions. The public are then asked to vote for their favourite surviving Housemate to win the prize. The winner is announced and the final three surviving housemates leaving the house together, treated to a cheering crowd.

=== Spin-offs ===
During each edition, Multishow broadcasts &quot;A Eliminação&quot;, an aftershow featuring a recap of the previous week, and an interview with the latest housemate to be evicted. Gshow Multishow, and Globoplay air &quot;Mesacast BBB&quot; (formerly &quot;Fora de Casa&quot;), a daily show hosted by former contestant Ana Clara Lima

During the 22nd season, Globo introduced the spin-off programming block &quot;Cinema do Lider&quot; (lit. &quot;Leader&#x27;s Cinema&quot;, now &quot;Cine BBB&quot;) following &quot;Big Brother Brasil&quot; on Wednesday nights beginning 26 January 2022. It carries films available on the Globoplay streaming service, and the HoH has the ability to invite housemates to private screenings of the films in the house. The block was originally intended to fill a timeslot that was intended for the broadcast TV premiere of &quot;Filhas de Eva&quot;, which had been delayed due to slow advertising sales.

== Celebrities ==
Usually Big Brother contestants are already forgotten by the time of the next season, but there are a few exceptions of contestants who became national stars. Juliana Alves, Sabrina Sato, Grazi Massafera, Íris Stefanelli and Juliette Freire are probably the biggest celebrities coming out of the reality show.

Sabrina Sato became a personality on the country after appearing in the third season. She posed naked twice for Playboy magazine and is one of the hosts of &quot;Pânico na TV&quot;, a very popular TV show among teenagers and Rede TV!&#x27;s most-watched show. She was one of Record Network&#x27;s biggest contracts and is also the spokesperson for several companies. She is one of the judges of &quot;The Masked Singer Brasil&quot; and makes appearences on TV Globo.

After her participation in the fifth season, where she was billed as extremely charismatic and nice, Grazielli Massafera also became a huge celebrity appearing in over 130 magazine covers, posing naked for Playboy magazine, starring in over 13 commercials and winning an important role on TV Globo&#x27;s 9 o&#x27;clock soap opera &quot;Páginas da Vida&quot;, where she received bad critics. Grazi is now a public and critically acclaimed actress and one of the most popular celebrities in the country and married Cauã Raymond, one of Brazil&#x27;s most popular and eligible young actors. In 2016, she was nominated for the International Emmy Award for Best Actress.

Íris Stefanelli attracted huge attention during her time in the house and achieved extreme popularity, thanks to her charisma. She became a personality in the country after appearing in the seventh season, She received a big paycheck to pose naked for Playboy. Globo decided not to take into consideration &quot;Siri&quot; (as she was nicknamed in the house) huge popularity and decided not to give her a long-term contract. She was contracted by small RedeTV! to co-host celebrities show &quot;TV Fama&quot;. Her lucrative deal was highlighted by the media. Íris is still a host on the show after the huge buzz that ensued her participation on the house.

Another contestant Jean Wyllys started his career in politics after participating in the program and was elected federal deputy in 2010, 2014 and 2018.
Thelma Assis became a tv presenter and model. Juliette Freire became a singer, scoring her first EP on pre-saves on Spotify on Brazil .

== Game ==
=== &quot;My Big Brother&quot; ===
A mobile version of &quot;Big Brother&quot; was released in 2005, called &quot;My Big Brother&quot;, and reproduced the entire show, in real-time, inside mobile phones. Big Brother Brasil is also on software and is manufactured by Continuum Entertainment and Brasoft Studios.

=== &quot;Big Game BBB&quot; ===
&quot;Big Game BBB&quot; appeared in the 22nd season of &quot;Big Brother Brasil&quot; and brought some news, but, in addition to the program itself, this edition also marked the launch of &quot;Big Game BBB&quot;, a free virtual game by Globo in which reality fans can guess about the dynamics of the week and see who does better in the bets.

== Controversy and criticism ==
&quot;Big Brother Brasil 3&quot; began on January 14, 2003, and was controversial. One of the contestants was the current Miss Brazil, Joseane Oliveira. Rules of the Miss Brazil contest forbid participation of married women but Joseane stated she was single. As a consequence of the exposure during the reality show, some magazines discovered she was married even before winning the beauty contest.

Once the marriage was proven, Joseane was stripped of her crown, and Thaisa Tomsem was crowned Miss Brazil 2002. Also, contestant Dilson Walkarez was not aware of Joseane relationship&#x27;s status and tried to start a romantic relationship with her during the show. Due to her refusals, he felt unmotivated and left the show voluntarily. Housemate Harry Grossman replaced him at February 26 and became the first housemate not to enter the show on its first day.

During &quot;Big Brother Brasil 8&quot;, the contestant Juliana Goes fainted during an endurance task where the contestants had to remain perfectly still inside a glass chamber. Newspapers and websites accused the show of being inhumane. However, the show was unaffected by the negative press.

In &quot;Big Brother Brasil 10&quot;, Marcelo Dourado, a returning contestant from BBB4, was accused of being homophobic but that was ignored and he eventually won his second season.

But the biggest scandal of the show happened on &quot;Big Brother Brasil 12&quot; when contestant Daniel Echaniz was accused of raping one of the contestants. He was expelled during the first week and denied the accusations, which were eventually dropped.

In &quot;Big Brother Brasil 19&quot;, only a few days after the beginning of the show, contestant Vanderson Brito faced rape accusations published online by his former girlfriend. He was expelled after police subpoenaed him for an interview, violating the house rule of having no contact with the outside world. Contestant Hariany Almeida was also expelled, after a party night where she was drunk lead to her pushing another contestant, violating the house rule of no violence. The show also faced considerable criticism as the house divided into two groups, separated by class and race, which lead to considerable racist comments and even police investigations regarding religious intolerance.

In &quot;Big Brother Brasil 21&quot;, the contestant Karol Conká behavior and actions towards other housemates garnered a very negative reception from the viewers and public personalities. This included Karol&#x27;s encouragement of outcasting certain housemates, aggressive comments that sparked discussions regarding psychological abuse and prejudiced comments that ranged from gaslighting, xenophobia, religious intolerance and sexual harassment, resulting in her cancellation with loss of followers on social networks and being evicted with the highest rejection of all the seasons, with 99.17% of the votes.

In 2011, Brazilian sociologist Silvia Viana Rodrigues wrote a thesis at University of São Paulo analyzing reality shows as spectacles that proliferate rituals of suffering. She analyzes such rituals in various cultural products from Hollywood and Brazilian television, with special attention to Big Brother Brasil. When investigating the openly eliminatory and cruel face of the game, Silvia Viana points out that such characteristics are liable to be entertainment with great and crucial public engagement because such processes of elimination, competition, exclusion, the affirmation of the war of all against all, of self-management and personal self-control through socio-emotional skills, entrepreneurship, the banality of evil, the naturalization of torture, the &quot;battle for survival&quot; logic and the incorporation of Nazi language and elements are already part of contemporary social life, especially in the context of work under neoliberalism. The thesis was later published as a book.

<text>Baron Seaford, of Seaford in the County of Sussex, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 1 July 1826 for Charles Ellis, a Jamaican sugar planter and slave-owner who had earlier represented Heytesbury, Seaford and East Grinstead in the House of Commons. In 1798 he married the Hon. Elizabeth Catherine Caroline Hervey, daughter of John Hervey, Lord Hervey, eldest son of Frederick Augustus Hervey, 4th Earl of Bristol and 5th Baron Howard de Walden. In 1803 Lord Seaford&#x27;s four-year-old son Charles Ellis inherited the barony of Howard de Walden from his great-grandfather and became the sixth Baron Howard de Walden (this title was created by writ in 1597; see the Baron Howard de Walden for earlier history of this peerage). In 1845 he also succeeded his father as second Baron Seaford.

Charles married in 1828 Lady Lucy Cavendish-Bentinck, daughter of William Bentinck, 4th Duke of Portland, and his wife Henrietta Scott. Through this marriage a substantial fortune came into the Ellis family, mainly based on property ownership in central London, and also their family Kilmarnock estate and Dean Castle, which was in use until 1975 and his since been run by East Ayrshire Council. His grandson, the eighth and fourth Baron, assumed in 1917 by Royal Licence his great-grandmother&#x27;s surname of Scott in addition to that of Ellis. He was succeeded by his son, the ninth and fifth Baron respectively. On his death in 1999 the two baronies separated.

The barony of Howard de Walden fell into abeyance between the late Baron&#x27;s four daughters, while the barony of Seaford, which could only be inherited through male lines, was passed on to his second cousin once removed, the sixth and () present holder of the title. He is the great-grandson of the Hon. William Charles Ellis, second son of the second Baron Seaford. Lord Seaford is also high in line of succession to the barony of Howard de Walden.

However, by Royal Warrant dated 25 June 2004, the Queen called the Barony of Howard de Walden out of abeyance in favour of the eldest daughter, Mary Hazel Caridwen Czernin (born 1935). In 1957 she had married Joseph Czernin, son of Count Franz Josef Czernin, a member of one of the oldest and most prominent noble families of the former Kingdom of Bohemia, now Czech Republic. By her husband she has five daughters and a son, Peter Joseph Czernin (born 1966), who is heir to the title.

<doc id="491440" wikidata="Q7552729" url="?curid=491440" title="Society of the United Scotsmen">
<text>The Society of the United Scotsmen was an organisation formed in Scotland in the late 18th century and sought widespread political reform throughout Great Britain. It grew out of previous radical movements such as the &quot;Friends of the People Society&quot;, and was inspired by the events of the French and American revolutions. Their aims were largely the same as those of the &quot;Society of the United Irishmen&quot;.

Societies of United Scotsmen had existed from the early 1790s, but it was only upon a delegation of United Irishmen arriving in Scotland to muster support for their cause that the United Scotsmen became more organised and more overtly revolutionary. The United Scotsmen were particularly adept at gaining support from the working classes of Scotland who stood to gain by becoming politically enfranchised, as the Society sought.

The aim of the Society was universal suffrage and annually elected parliaments, with a strong streak of republicanism running through it as well. By the mid-1790s the society may have had around 3,000 members.

Owing to its aims and activities the United Scotsmen had to remain a secret society, and organised themselves into cells of no more than 16 people which would send delegates to larger bodies on occasion. This way it meant the organisation was more difficult to penetrate, but it also meant that many members did not know other members of the organisation.

The society was further boosted when the Parliament passed the &quot;Militia Act 1797&quot; which allowed for the conscription of young men into the army. This proved vastly unpopular with many ordinary Scots, and in August 1797 there were large protests across the country which were brutally suppressed, with many protesters killed (e.g. Massacre of Tranent).

The United Scotsmen hoped to get support from the Dutch as well as the French, and there were plans for the Dutch to land in Scotland with some 50,000 troops and to take over the Scottish Central Belt. However the Royal Navy intercepted a Dutch fleet and defeated them at the Battle of Camperdown in October 1797. Further hopes for French assistance were ruined when a French fleet was dispatched to England in the hope of encouraging English radicals (there was also a Society of the United Englishmen) to rise against His Majesty&#x27;s Government. However radical activity was not as entrenched there as in Scotland, or Ireland in particular. If they had dispatched the fleet to either of these countries then they may have met with more success.

Various leaders of the United Scotsmen were arrested and tried. For example, George Mealmaker was sentenced to 14 years transportation. Other leaders such as Robert Jaffrey, David Black, James Paterson and William Maxwell were all found guilty of seditious activity. The last record of a United Scotsmen member having been tried before the courts was the trial in 1802 of Thomas Wilson. The United Scotsmen were (along with the United Irishmen) pronounced an illegal organisation and legal measures tightened up control of the press as well to halt radical activity.

However, the radical activity continued in Scotland and in 1820 there was another radical rising (one of whose leaders, James Wilson, had been a member of the United Scotsmen).

<doc id="491442" wikidata="Q485217" url="?curid=491442" title="Prior Analytics">
<text>The Prior Analytics (; ) is a work by Aristotle on reasoning, known as syllogistic, composed around 350 BCE. Being one of the six extant Aristotelian writings on logic and scientific method, it is part of what later Peripatetics called the &quot;Organon&quot;. 

The term &quot;analytics&quot; comes from the Greek words &quot;analytos&quot; (ἀναλυτός, &#x27;solvable&#x27;) and &quot;analyo&quot; (ἀναλύω, &#x27;to solve&#x27;, literally &#x27;to loose&#x27;). However, in Aristotle&#x27;s corpus, there are distinguishable differences in the meaning of ἀναλύω and its cognates. There is also the possibility that Aristotle may have borrowed his use of the word &quot;analysis&quot; from his teacher Plato. On the other hand, the meaning that best fits the &quot;Analytics&quot; is one derived from the study of Geometry and this meaning is very close to what Aristotle calls &quot;episteme&quot; (επιστήμη), knowing the reasoned facts. Therefore, Analysis is the process of finding the reasoned facts.

In the &quot;Analytics&quot; then, &quot;Prior Analytics&quot; is the first theoretical part dealing with the science of deduction and the &quot;Posterior Analytics&quot; is the second demonstratively practical part. &quot;Prior Analytics&quot; gives an account of deductions in general narrowed down to three basic syllogisms while &quot;Posterior Analytics&quot; deals with demonstration.

==Legacy==

Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Prior Analytics&quot; represents the first time in history when Logic is scientifically investigated. On those grounds alone, Aristotle could be considered the Father of Logic for as he himself says in &quot;Sophistical Refutations&quot;, &quot;When it comes to this subject, it is not the case that part had been worked out before in advance and part had not; instead, nothing existed at all.&quot;

=== Ancient commentaries ===
In the third century AD, Alexander of Aphrodisias&#x27;s commentary on the &quot;Prior Analytics&quot; is the oldest extant and one of the best of the ancient tradition and is available in the English language.

In the sixth century, Boethius composed the first known Latin translation of the &quot;Prior Analytics&quot;, however, this translation has not survived, and the &quot;Prior Analytics&quot; may have been unavailable in Western Europe until the eleventh century, when it was quoted from by Bernard of Utrecht. 

The so-called &quot;Anonymus Aurelianensis III&quot; from the second half of the twelfth century is the first extant Latin commentary, or rather fragment of a commentary.

=== Modern reception ===
Modern work on Aristotle&#x27;s logic builds on the tradition started in 1951 with the establishment by Jan Łukasiewicz of a revolutionary paradigm. His approach was replaced in the early 1970s in a series of papers by John Corcoran and Timothy Smiley—which inform modern translations of &quot;Prior Analytics&quot; by Robin Smith in 1989 and Gisela Striker in 2009.

A problem in meaning arises in the study of &quot;Prior Analytics&quot; for the word &quot;syllogism&quot; as used by Aristotle in general does not carry the same narrow connotation as it does at present; Aristotle defines this term in a way that would apply to a wide range of valid arguments. In the &quot;Prior Analytics&quot;, Aristotle defines syllogism as &quot;a deduction in a discourse in which, certain things being supposed, something different from the things supposed results of necessity because these things are so.&quot; In modern times, this definition has led to a debate as to how the word &quot;syllogism&quot; should be interpreted. At present, &quot;syllogism&quot; is used exclusively as the method used to reach a conclusion closely resembling the &quot;syllogisms&quot; of traditional logic texts: two premises followed by a conclusion each of which is a categorical sentence containing all together three terms, two extremes which appear in the conclusion and one middle term which appears in both premises but not in the conclusion. Some scholars prefer to use the word &quot;deduction&quot; instead as the meaning given by Aristotle to the Greek word &quot;syllogismos&quot; (συλλογισμός). Scholars Jan Lukasiewicz, Józef Maria Bocheński and Günther Patzig have sided with the Protasis-Apodosis dichotomy while John Corcoran prefers to consider a syllogism as simply a deduction.

<text>Baron Stratheden, of Cupar in the County of Fife, and Baron Campbell, of St Andrews in the County of Fife, are two titles in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The titles were created in 1836 and 1841 respectively. The barony of Stratheden was created for the Hon. Mary, Lady Campbell, wife of the prominent lawyer and Whig politician Sir John Campbell, and daughter of James Scarlett, 1st Baron Abinger. Sir John Campbell, who in 1836 served as Attorney-General in the Whig administration of Lord Melbourne, had twice been overlooked for the office of Master of the Rolls, and was about to tender his resignation to Melbourne as a result of this. However, he was talked out of resigning when it was decided that, in recognition of the value of his services, his wife should be raised to the peerage. Five years later he was himself created Baron Campbell on his appointment as Lord Chancellor of Ireland. He later held office as Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain.

Both Lady Stratheden and Lord Campbell were succeeded by their eldest son, the second Baron. He had previously represented Cambridge and Harwich in the House of Commons as a Liberal. He never married and was succeeded by his younger brother, the third Baron. On his death the titles passed to his grandson, the fourth Baron. He was a Brigadier in the army. He had no sons and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fifth Baron. the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s grandson, the seventh Baron, who succeeded in 2011.

<doc id="491451" wikidata="Q331718" url="?curid=491451" title="Absalom and Achitophel">
<text>Absalom and Achitophel is a celebrated satirical poem by John Dryden, written in heroic couplets and first published in 1681. The poem tells the Biblical tale of the rebellion of Absalom against King David; in this context it is an allegory used to represent a story contemporary to Dryden, concerning King Charles II and the Exclusion Crisis (1679–1681). The poem also references the Popish Plot (1678).

==Satire==
&quot;Absalom and Achitophel&quot; is &quot;generally acknowledged as the finest political satire in the English language&quot;. It is also described as an allegory regarding contemporary political events, and a mock heroic narrative. On the title page, Dryden himself describes it simply as &quot;a poem&quot;.

In the prologue, &quot;To the Reader&quot;, Dryden states that &quot;the true end of satire is the amendment of vices by correction&quot;. He also suggests that in &quot;Absalom and Achitophel&quot; he did not let the satire be too sharp to those who were least corrupt: &quot;I confess I have laid in for those, by rebating the satire, where justice would allow it, from carrying too sharp an edge.&quot;

&quot;Absalom and Achitophel&quot; has inspired a great deal of discussion regarding satire: how satire was defined when Dryden wrote, and how this poem contrasts with the ancient models of Horace, Virgil, and Juvenal. Dryden himself is considered a father of the modern essay, and one of literature&#x27;s most important critics of the literary form, particularly in his essay &quot;A Discourse Concerning the Original and Progress of Satire&quot;, where he writes a history of satire &quot;from its first rudiments of barbarity, to its last polishing and perfection&quot;. He also offers a definition of satire:

Heinsius, in his dissertations on Horace, makes it for me, in these words; &quot;Satire is a kind of poetry, without a series of action, invented for the purging of our minds; in which human vices, ignorance, and errors, and all things besides, which are produced from them, in every man, are severely reprehended; partly dramatically, partly simply, and sometimes in both kinds of speaking; but for the most part figuratively, and occultly; consisting in a low familiar way, chiefly in a sharp and pungent manner of speech; but partly, also, in a facetious and civil way of jesting; by which, either hatred, or laughter, or indignation is moved.&quot;

At one point in the essay, &quot;A Discourse Concerning the Original and Progress of Satire&quot;, Dryden mentions &quot;Absalom and Achitophel&quot;:

The nicest and most delicate touches of satire consist in fine raillery … How easy it is to call rogue and villain, and that wittily? But how hard to make a man appear a fool, a blockhead, or a knave, without using any of those opprobrious terms? … The character of Zimri in my Absalom, is, in my opinion, worth the whole poem: &#x27;Tis not bloody, but &#x27;tis ridiculous enough. And he for whom it was intended, was too witty to resent it as an injury … And thus, my lord, you see I have preferred the manner of Horace, and of your Lordship, in this kind of satire, to that of Juvenal.

==Biblical background==
The story of Absalom&#x27;s rebellion against his father, King David, is told in the Old Testament of the Bible, in the Second Book of Samuel (). The beautiful Absalom is distinguished by his extraordinarily abundant hair, which is thought to symbolise his pride (). When David&#x27;s renowned advisor, Achitophel, joins Absalom&#x27;s rebellion, another advisor, Hushai, plots with David to pretend to defect and give Absalom advice that plays into David&#x27;s hands. The result is that Absalom takes the advice of the double agent Hushai over the good advice of Achitophel. Achitophel, realising that the rebellion is doomed to failure, goes home and hangs himself. Absalom is killed (against David&#x27;s explicit commands) after getting caught by his hair in the thick branches of a great oak tree: &quot;His head caught fast in the oak, and he was left hanging between heaven and earth, while the mule that was under him went on&quot; (NRSV 2 Sam. 18:9). The death of his son, Absalom, causes David enormous personal grief.

A second allegory in the poem, beginning on line 425, is the Parable of the Prodigal Son, which can be found in the New Testament in the Gospel of Luke, chapter 15, verse 11–32. It is the tale of a son who asks for his birthright early, loses it, and returns to his father, who then takes pity on him and shares with him his remaining fortune. The father&#x27;s forgiveness contrasts with the response of David towards Achitophel, but still the story works well for a theme that deals with problems of ascension, and Dryden uses similarities and differences in the two stories to express the poem&#x27;s themes. Ideas from this second allegory occur throughout the poem.

==Historical background==
In 1681 in England, Charles II was aged 51. He had a number of mistresses and had produced a number of illegitimate children. One of these was James Scott, the Duke of Monmouth, who was very popular, both for his personal charisma and for his fervor for the Protestant cause. Charles had no legitimate child to be his heir, and his brother, the future King James II, was openly a Roman Catholic. When Charles&#x27;s health suffered, there was a panic in the House of Commons over the potential for the nation being ruled by a Roman Catholic king. The Earl of Shaftesbury had sponsored and advocated the Exclusion Bill, which would prevent James from succeeding to the throne, but this bill was blocked by the House of Lords on two occasions. In the spring of 1681, at the Oxford Parliament, Shaftesbury appealed to Charles to legitimise Monmouth. Monmouth was caught preparing to rebel and seek the throne, and Shaftesbury was suspected of fostering this rebellion. The poem was written, possibly at Charles&#x27;s behest, and published in early November 1681. On 24 November 1681, Shaftesbury was seized and charged with high treason. A trial before a jury picked by Whig sheriffs acquitted him.

Later, after the death of his father, the Duke of Monmouth—unwilling to see his uncle James become King—executed his plans and went into full revolt. The Monmouth Rebellion was put down, and in 1685 the Duke was executed.

==Synopsis==
Dryden&#x27;s poem tells the story of the first foment by making Monmouth into Absalom, the beloved boy, Charles into David (who also had done some philandering), and Shaftesbury into Achitophel. It paints Buckingham, an old enemy of Dryden&#x27;s (see &quot;The Rehearsal&quot; for one example), into Zimri, the unfaithful servant. The poem places most of the blame for the rebellion on Shaftesbury, and makes Charles a very reluctant and loving man who has to be king before father. The poem also refers to some of the Popish Plot furore.

==Analysis==

===Plot analysis===
There are many different ways of understanding Dryden&#x27;s poem &quot;Absalom and Achitophel&quot;. The most common reading compares &quot;the connections between fatherhood and kingship&quot;. Through biblical allusions Dryden connects ancient fatherhood with current events not only to show a precedent, but also to show how it connects with a royal&#x27;s responsibilities. Dryden uses the fatherly indulgence of David (lines 31-33) to explore the legitimacy of Absalom&#x27;s succession. Dryden uses an old story, The Prodigal Son, to create a clear picture of how self-indulgent love creates unfair conflict. Throughout the poem the relationship of fatherhood and kingship is united.

Another way of reading Dryden&#x27;s poem is through a &quot;mother plot.&quot; Susan Greenfield proposes that the mentions of maternity and women are an important part of the poem&#x27;s royalist resolution. In this reading the blame is transferred to the females, saying that only the female power of life threatens the political order and should be hindered. It is due to female desires and a female&#x27;s ability to create life that the whole mess is created.

===Renaissance element===
Within the renaissance philosophers and writers were interested in the idea of superiority of bastards. It was a common idea at that time that bastards were better than their legitimate counterparts. Lines 19 and 20 explore this idea when they say &quot;whether, inspired by some diviner lust,/his father got him with a greater gust&quot;. It was thought that the greater passion and desire that went into making bastards made them better. An inclusion of this idea in a satirical piece could have many implications. Heidi Kelchner proposes that &quot;we should consider Dryden&#x27;s reference to the heated manner in which Absalom was conceived-used ironically as part of a mock panegyric of Absalom&quot;.

==A second part written by Nahum Tate==
&quot;Absalom and Achitophel&quot; stands alone as a complete poem by John Dryden as it was published in 1681. Its success led others to encourage Dryden to continue the story, to keep up with current events of the time. Dryden declined the suggestion, but his friend Nahum Tate took it up and wrote a second part, publishing it the following year, 1682. According to the bookseller Jacob Tonson, Tate was aided by Dryden&#x27;s advice and editorial direction. Dryden also anonymously contributed a few lines that satirized Thomas Shadwell and Elkanah Settle, who in Dryden&#x27;s passage are named Og and Doeg. Tate&#x27;s second part recycles a number of Dryden&#x27;s ideas and lines, but has not impressed the critics, though Dryden&#x27;s contribution stands out from what surrounds it.

<doc id="491454" wikidata="Q2746434" url="?curid=491454" title="Religion in Brazil">
<text>The predominant religion in Brazil is Christianity, with Catholicism being its largest denomination.

In 1891, when the first Brazilian Republican Constitution was set forth, Brazil ceased to have an official religion and has remained secular ever since, though the Catholic Church remained politically influential into the 1970s. The Constitution of Brazil guarantees freedom of religion and strongly prohibits the establishment of any religion by banning government support or hindrance of religion at all levels.

==Overview==
Brazil possesses a richly spiritual society formed from the meeting of the Catholic Church with the religious traditions of enslaved Africans and indigenous people. This confluence of faiths during the Portuguese colonization of Brazil led to the development of a diverse array of syncretistic practices within the overarching umbrella of Brazilian Catholicism, characterized by traditional Portuguese festivities. Until recently, Catholicism was overwhelmingly dominant. Changes in the 21st century have led to a growth in secularism (no religious affiliation) and to Evangelical Protestantism. A 2020 poll indicates that around 50% of Brazilians consider themselves Catholic, down from 90% in 1970. Despite falling in most of the country, Catholicism remains strong in most of the Northeast. Some analysts have projected Protestants to possibly outnumber Catholics around 2030, with the Catholic Church membership dropping to 38.6%, the Protestant membership in hundreds of independent denominations rising to 39.8%, and the non-Christian population (including the non-affiliated) rising to over 20%. However, in another 2020 study by the Association of Religion Data Archives, 70.57% of the population were Catholic, 15.12% Protestant, 12.23% Independent, 0.12% Orthodox (Eastern or Oriental), and 0.09% unaffiliated Christian.

In the 2010 census, 64.63% of the population declared themselves as Catholic, 22.2% as Protestant, 8% as non-religious, and 5.2% as followers of other religions (mostly Spiritists or Kardecists who follow the doctrines of Allan Kardec, Umbandists, Candomblers, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and minorities of Buddhists, Jews, Muslims, and other groups). In ARDA&#x27;s 2020 study, Spiritists were the second-largest religion practiced among the Brazilian population at 4.83%. Other religions including the Baha&#x27;i Faith, Buddhism, Chinese folk religions, Afro-Brazilian religions, Hinduism, Judaism, Islam, and new religious movements made up 1.37% of the population in the same study.

Brazilian religions are very diversified and inclined to syncretism. In recent decades, there has been a great increase of Neo-Pentecostal churches and in Afro-Brazilian religions, which had decreased the number of members of the Roman Catholic Church as of 2000. The number of Umbandists and Candomblers could be significantly higher than the official census figure since many of them continue to this day to disguise their religion under &quot;Catholic&quot; syncretism. About 90% of Brazilians declared some sort of religious affiliation as of 2004.

Religious intolerance is a crime in Brazil, and several laws ensure freedom of worship and protection for those who profess their faith. The Federal Constitution of 1988 (Arti.5, Clause IV) guarantees that &quot;freedom of conscience and belief is inviolable, ensuring the free exercise of religious cults and guaranteeing, in accordance with the law, the protection of places of worship and their liturgies.&quot;

The Brazilian Penal Code (Decree-Law 2,848/1940), establishes as a crime the act of &quot;publicly mock someone based on their beliefs or religious function, stop or disturb a religious ceremony or practice, or publicly disrespect acts or objects of religious worship.&quot; The penalty for these acts is imprisonment for one month to one year or a fine. Law n. 14.532/2023 added paragraph three to Article 140 of the Penal Code, which determines that, in the case of the crime of insult, if it consists of elements related to religion or the condition of an elderly or disabled person, the penalty for the crime will be imprisonment for one to three years and a fine.

==Christianity==

===Catholicism===

Brazil has the largest number of Catholics in the world. Catholicism has been Brazil&#x27;s main religion since the beginning of the 16th century. It was introduced among the Native Brazilians by Jesuits missionaries during colonial times, there was no freedom of religion. All Portuguese settlers and Brazilians were compulsorily bound to the Catholic faith and were bound to pay tithes to the church. After Brazilian independence, the first constitution introduced freedom of religion in 1824, but Catholicism was kept as the official religion. The Imperial Brazilian government paid a salary to Catholic priests and influenced the appointment of bishops. The political-administrative division of the municipalities accompanied the hierarchical division of the bishoprics in &quot;&quot;freguesias&quot; (parishes). There was also some hindrances to the construction of temples and cemeteries that belonged to the Catholic Church. The first Republican Constitution in 1891 separated religion from state and made all religions equal in the Codes of Law, but the Catholic Church remained very influential until the 1970s. For example, due to the strong opposition of the Catholic Church, divorce was not allowed in Brazil until 1977 even if a separated couple observed a different religion.

The Catholic faith practiced in Brazil is full of popular festivities rooted in centuries-old Portuguese traditions, but also heavily influenced by African and Native Brazilian usage. Popular traditions include pilgrimages to the National Shrine of Our Lady of Aparecida (&quot;Nossa Senhora Aparecida&quot;), the patron saint of Brazil, and religious festivals like the &quot;Círio de Nazaré&quot; in Belém and the &quot;Festa do Divino&quot;&quot; in many cities of Central Brazil. Areas that received many European immigrants in the last century, especially Italian and German, have Catholic traditions closer to that practiced in Europe.

The largest proportion of Catholics is concentrated in the Northeast (59%) and South (53%) regions. The smallest proportion of Catholics is found in the Center-West region (49%). The State of Piauí has the largest proportion of Catholics (85%) and the State of Rio de Janeiro has the smallest one (45.19%). Among the state capitals, Teresina has the largest proportion of Catholics in the country (86.010%), followed by Aracaju, Fortaleza, Florianópolis and João Pessoa.

Alternatively, in the 20th century, former Catholic bishop Carlos Duarte Costa founded the Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church after disagreements with clerical celibacy and other doctrines.

=== Protestantism ===

Protestantism in Brazil largely originated with American missionaries in the second half of the 19th century, following up on efforts that began in the 1830s. Evangelical Protestantism and Pentecostalism has grown very rapidly in Brazil since the late 20th century. The 2010 census reported that 22.2% of the Brazilian population was Protestant, or about 44 million people. Brazil has many versions of Protestantism. These include neo-Pentecostals, old Pentecostals, and Traditional Protestants (most of them Baptists, Presbyterians and Methodists) predominantly from Minas Gerais to the South. The Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil, part of the Anglican Communion, has some 120,000 members. Centers of neo-Pentecostalism are Londrina in Paraná state, as well the cities of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte (capital of Minas Gerais), especially the suburban and nearby areas of these cities. Lutherans are concentrated mostly in the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and in countryside regions of the states of Rio de Janeiro and Espírito Santo.

As of the year 2000, the largest proportion of Protestants was found in North (19.8%), Central-West (18.9%) and Southeast (17.5%) regions. Among the state capitals, Rio de Janeiro has the largest proportion of non-Pentecostal Protestants in the country (10.07%), followed by Vitória, Porto Velho, Cuiabá and Manaus. But Goiânia is the state capital with the largest proportion of Pentecostal Protestants in the country (20.41%), followed by Boa Vista, Porto Velho, Belém and Belo Horizonte. A 2023 IPSOS survey found that 38% of Brazilians identified as Catholic and 29% as Protestant, and a 2020 ARDA survey estimated that 70.57% of its population was Catholic and 15.12% Protestant.

While Catholicism was politically dominant before the secularization of Brazil, Protestants have been involved in influencing Brazilian and international politics; Evangelical Protestant influence has also been implicated in the attempted 2022 Bolsonarist coup. Following Bolsonaro&#x27;s 2024 indictment, the country&#x27;s Evangelical Caucus threatened a reactionary response.

=== Orthodoxy ===
The Eastern Orthodox Church is also present in Brazil. The Orthodox Metropolitan Cathedral, located in São Paulo, is the See of the Archdiocese of the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch in São Paulo. It is an example of Byzantine architecture that can be appreciated in South America. Its construction, which began in the 1940s, was inspired by the Basilica of Hagia Sophia of Istanbul and was inaugurated in January 1954. According to IBGE, there were 131,571 Orthodox Christians in Brazil. There are also Oriental Orthodox communities in Brazil.

===Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses===
In 2022, according to the denomination, Brazil had 909,879 Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses with 12,439 congregations and a ratio of 1 Witness to 238 residents. However, the 2010 census reported nearly 1.4 million people listed themselves as members.

=== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ===
The Latter-day Saints arrived in Brazil in 1913 through German immigrants, but proselytizing efforts only began in 1929. It is the fastest-growing church in Brazil in terms of membership. According to the religious institution&#x27;s records, it has about 1.5 million members, making Brazil the third country in the world with the most members, behind only the United States and Mexico. The Church has 36 missions, 2,172 congregations, 21 temples, and 524 Family History Centers.

According to the Church&#x27;s doctrine, these temples perform sacred ordinances such as vicarious baptism, celestial marriage, and family sealing, in addition to being places of learning and spirituality. Only baptized and worthy members are allowed to enter the temples. The Church also holds worship meetings on Sundays in its chapels throughout Brazil, which are open to the public.

The Church is active in community assistance in Brazil, notably through the &quot;Helping Hands&quot; program. This initiative mobilizes members and volunteers in activities such as blood donation, food drives, support for natural disasters, health and education campaigns, and revitalization of public spaces. The church undertakes these actions to contribute to the well-being of its members and local communities.

Despite being Christians, they believe themselves to be the restored Church of Christ on Earth. Therefore, they are part of the Restorationist branch and not affiliated with any other traditional religious movements such as Catholicism, Protestantism, Spiritism, or other Christian denominations, although they respect all denominations.

== Non-Christian religions ==
There are small populations of people professing Buddhism, Judaism, Islam, Shinto, Rastafari and many other religions. They comprise 21st century immigrants from East Asia, the Middle East, or of recent immigrant descent.
=== African and indigenous religions ===
Afro-Brazilian religions are syncretic religions, such as Candomblé, that have many followers, mainly Afro-Brazilians. They are concentrated mainly in large urban centers in the Northeast, such as Salvador, Recife, or Rio de Janeiro in the Southeast. The cities of São Paulo, Porto Alegre and Florianópolis have a great number of followers, but in the South of Brazil the most common African influenced Ritual is Almas e Angola, which is an Umbanda like a ritual. Nowadays, there are over 70 &quot;terreiros&quot; (temples) in Florianópolis, which are the places where the rituals run. In addition to Candomblé which arose through a process of syncretism between several of the traditional religions of West Africa, especially that of the Yoruba, and the Roman Catholic form of Christianity, there is also Umbanda, a syncretic Brazilian religion that blends African traditions with Roman Catholicism, Spiritism, and Indigenous American beliefs. There are also Catholics, Protestants, and other kinds of Christians who hold a dual belief system and go to both churches and terreiros.

Candomblé, Umbanda, Batuque, Xango, and Tambor de Mina are Afro-Brazilian religions influenced by the native cults brought by black slaves shipped from Africa to Brazil. These black slaves would summon their gods, called Orixas, Voduns, or Inkices with chants and dances they had brought from Africa. These cults were persecuted throughout most of Brazilian history, largely because they were believed to be pagan or even satanic. However, the Brazilian republic government legalized all of them on the grounds of the necessary separation between the State and the Church in 1889.

In current practice, Umbanda followers leave offerings of food, candles, and flowers in public places for the spirits. Candomblé terreiros have similar practices, and there are a number of festivals that occur yearly especially in the Northeast, with celebrations such as the famous Iyemanja Festival and the Waters of Oxala.

From Bahia northwards there are different practices such as Catimbo, and Jurema with heavy indigenous elements. All over the country, but mainly in the Amazon rainforest, there are many Indians still practicing their original traditions. Many of their beliefs and use of naturally occurring plant derivatives are incorporated into African, Spiritualists, and folk religions.

These religions have suffered increasing hostility from Protestant churches, with attacks on temples and the defacement of statues of the gods. In recent years measures have been taken to counter religious conflict.

=== Spiritism ===

Spiritism is a religion, founded in the 19th century by the French educator Allan Kardec, which proposes the study of &quot;the nature, origin, and destiny of spirits, and their relation with the corporeal world&quot;. Spiritism follows Jesus&#x27;s moral teachings, and therefore its status as a non-Christian religion is an object of debate between its followers and mainstream Christians. It is the largest non-Christian religion in Brazil as of 2020. It studies topics such as life after death, reincarnation, spirits, moral teachings and much more.

=== Buddhism ===
Buddhism is probably the largest of all minority religions, with about 215,000 followers, and, as of 2020, forming 0.25% of the religious population. Brazil is home to the third-largest Buddhist population in the Americas, after the United States and Canada. This is mostly because of the large Japanese Brazilian community. About a fifth of the Japanese Brazilian community are followers of Buddhism. Japanese Buddhist sects like Jodo Shinshu, Nichiren Buddhism (most notably the Soka Gakkai), and Zen are the most popular. Tibetan Buddhism (Vajrayana) is also present, since Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche founded the Khadro Ling center in Três Coroas, Rio Grande do Sul (where he lived until his death in 2002), and many other institutions across the country. However, in recent years both Chinese Mahayana and South East Asian Theravāda sects are gaining popularity. Buddhism was introduced to Brazil in the early twentieth century, by Japanese immigrants, although now, 60% of Japanese Brazilians are now Christian due to missionary activities and intermarriage. Nevertheless, Japanese Brazilian culture has a substantial Buddhist influence. A number of Buddhist organizations and groups are also active in Brazil, with nearly 150 temples spread across the states.

=== Judaism ===

The first Jews arrived in Brazil as &quot;cristãos-novos&quot; (New Christians) or conversos, names applied to Jews or Muslims who converted to Catholicism, most of them forcibly. According to the Inquisition reports, many New Christians living in Brazil during colonial times were condemned for secretly observing Jewish customs.

In 1630, the Dutch conquered portions of northeast Brazil and permitted the open practice of any religion. Many Jews came from the Netherlands to live in Brazil in an area dominated by the Dutch. Most of them were descendants of the Portuguese Jews who had been expelled from Portugal in 1497. In 1636, the Kahal Zur Israel Synagogue, the first synagogue in the Americas was built in Recife, the capital of Dutch Brazil. The original building remains to this day, but the Jews were forced to leave Brazil when the Portuguese-Brazilians retook the land in 1654.

The first Jews that stayed in Brazil and openly practiced their religion came when the first Brazilian constitution granted freedom of religion in 1824, just after the independence. They were mainly Moroccan Jews.

The first wave of Sephardic Jews was exceeded by the larger wave of immigration by Ashkenazi Jews that came at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries, mainly from Russia, Poland, Belarus and Ukraine. A final significant group came, fleeing Nazism or the destruction that followed World War II.

Brazil has the second-largest Jewish population in Latin America of 120,000 people, making up a total of 0.06% of Brazil&#x27;s population in 2010. As of 2017, Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s Jewish population was 22,000, with 24 active synagogues and São Paulo has a Jewish population of 44,000.

=== Islam ===
By Pew in 2010, there were 204,000 Muslims in Brazil, representing 0.1% of the total population. The Federation of Muslim Associations of Brazil estimates there are about 1.5 million Muslims and others say about 400,000 to 500,000. There are over 150 mosques where Muslims perform their daily prayers.

Islam in Brazil may be presumed to have first been practiced by African slaves brought from West Africa. Scholars note that Brazil received more enslaved Muslims than anywhere else in the Americas. During Ramadan, in January 1835, a small group of black slaves and freedmen from Salvador da Bahia, inspired by Muslim teachers, rose up against the government in the Malê Revolt, the largest slave rebellion in Brazil. (Muslims were called &quot;malê&quot; in Bahia at this time, from Yoruba &quot;image&quot; that designated a Yoruba Muslim.) Fearing the example might be followed, the Brazilian authorities began to watch the &quot;malês&quot; very carefully and in subsequent years intensive efforts were made towards conversions to Catholic Christianity and erase the popular memory of and affection towards Islam. However, the African Muslim community was not erased overnight, and as late as 1910 it is estimated there were still some 100,000 African Muslims living in Brazil.

A recent trend has been the increase in conversions to Islam among non-Arab citizens.

=== Hinduism ===

Most of the Brazilian Hindus are ethnic East Indians. However, there are new converts due to the missionary effects of Hare Krishnas.

There are as many as 1500 PIOs in the Indian community in Brazil, and only 400 NRIs since foreign nationals can acquire local citizenship without any discrimination after 15 years of domicile in this country. Brazil has also no bar against dual citizenship. But in recent years, it has been granting immigration visas only in high technology fields. The only exceptions are the Sindhis in Manaus (who have formed an Indian Association with about a hundred members) and the Goans in São Paulo.

Besides the PIOs, there are Hindu organizations such as ISKCON as well as Brahma Kumaris which are very active in Brazil. The number of adherents of these organizations is not officially recorded but is estimated to be a few thousand. The Vedic Astrology, vedanga of Hinduism, is increasingly popular in Brazil, especially by the efforts of the Academia Brasileira de Astrologia Védica (ABAV) which promotes this branch of the Vedic culture in the country.

===Positivist Church of Brazil===

Many confuse Spiritism with Afro-Brazilian Religions like Umbanda, Candomblé, and others that have a following of almost 600,000 adherents. One of the most unusual features of the rich Brazilian spiritual landscape are the sects that use ayahuasca (an Amazonian entheogenic tea), including Santo Daime, União do Vegetal, and Centro de Cultura Cósmica. This syncretism, coupled with ideas prevalent during the military dictatorship, has resulted in a church for the secular, based on philosopher Auguste Comte&#x27;s principles of positivism, based at the Positivist Church of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro. 

=== Baháʼí Faith ===

The Baháʼí Faith in Brazil started in 1919 with Baháʼís first visiting the country that year, and the first Baháʼí Local Spiritual Assembly in Brazil was established in 1928. There followed a period of growth with the arrival of coordinated pioneers from the United States finding national Brazilian converts and in 1961 an independent national Baháʼí community was formed. During the 1992 Earth Summit, which was held in Brazil, the international and local Baháʼí community were given the responsibility for organizing a series of different programs, and since then the involvement of the Baháʼí community in the country have continued to multiply. The Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on &quot;World Christian Encyclopedia&quot;) estimated some 42,100 Baháʼís in Brazil in 2010.

=== Japanese new religions ===

There are, in Brazil, many followers of Japanese new religions like Oomoto, PL Kyodan, Seicho-no-Ie and the Church of World Messianity. The total number of adherents, if merged, maybe in the hundreds of thousands. 

== Beliefs ==

<text>A rigid inflatable boat (RIB), also rigid-hull inflatable boat or rigid-hulled inflatable boat (RHIB), is a lightweight but high-performance and high-capacity boat constructed with a rigid hull bottom joined to side-forming air tubes that are inflated with air to a high pressure so as to give the sides resilient rigidity along the boat&#x27;s topsides. The design is stable, light, fast and seaworthy. The inflated collar acts as a life jacket, ensuring that the vessel retains its buoyancy, even if the boat is taking on water. The RIB is an evolutionary development of the inflatable boat with a rubberized fabric bottom that is stiffened with flat boards within the collar to form the deck or floor of the boat.

==History==
===Origins in Wales===
The concept of configuring a rigid hull surrounded by an inflated, compartmentalized buoyancy tube from prow to transom originated and evolved from the problems that plagued existing rubberized fabric bottom inflated motorboats: fabric wear-through and poor sea keeping due to lack of immersed hull structural rigidity. A solution was sought starting at Atlantic College, the first of now 18 United World Colleges, which had opened on the southern coast of Wales in 1962, founded partly by the same man who had earlier originated Outward Bound in Aberdovey Scotland during the Second World War for instilling ‘resilience’ and moral fortitude in youth. 

Development of the RIB was originally undertaken by students and staff at under the direction of retired Royal Navy Admiral Desmond Hoare, who headed the 6th form (senior secondary) college.

A series of experimental and prototype solutions for effectively combining a hard hull form with a pressurized, air-filled rubber infused nylon fabric (called Hypalon) sponson lasted for over a decade. The RHIB craft developed at Atlantic College served as an effective seafront activities safety and rescue boat for the college&#x27;s fleet of sailing dinghies on the often challenging Bristol Channel, and the college went on to become an Inshore Lifeboat Station for the RNLI in 1963, carrying out countless rescues over the next 50 years. 

The Royal National Lifeboat Institution had been operating entirely inflated small motorized boats for close to shore rescue recovery that where nautically limited in their capacity, range, endurance, sea keeping and sea worthiness and top speed.

The RNLI&#x27;s &quot;B-Class Atlantic Inshore Lifeboat&quot; (including the Atlantic 21, the Atlantic 75, and Atlantic 85) was named in honor of the college&#x27;s role in its development. The Atlantic College Lifeboat Station was decommissioned by the RNLI in 2013. The video RIB History at UWC Atlantic College provides a visual historical summary.

In 1964, Rear-Admiral Hoare and his students at Atlantic College replaced the torn bottom of their sailing activity rescue inflatable boat with a plywood sheet glued to the inflatable tubes. This proved a successful modification but was rather uncomfortable at speed offshore, and so the hull was rebuilt with a shallow-vee bow entry transitioning to a nearly flat section stern. This boat was named &quot;Atlanta&quot; and later that year an Atlantic College RIB was displayed at the London Boat Show.

By 1966 the students had built a further five rigid inflatable boats – the &quot;Aphrodite&quot; and &quot;Triton&quot; for the college&#x27;s own use, and the &quot;X1&quot; and &quot;X2&quot; which were made under a development agreement with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) and were launched in 1965 by Queen Elizabeth II. They were taken by the RNLI for trials at Gorleston (&quot;X1&quot;) and Great Yarmouth (&quot;X2&quot;) from which they returned to Atlantic College in Spring 1967. &quot;X3&quot; was an experimental vortex-lift hull funded by a private developer and was not greatly successful.

By that time Hoare had concluded that for the conditions under which they operated a boat of around long was optimum which led to &quot;X4&quot; (launched 1966), &quot;X5&quot; and &quot;X6&quot; (launched 1967), and &quot;X7&quot; to &quot;X8&quot; (launched 1968). These boats were used to support the college&#x27;s sailing activities and also to fulfil the college&#x27;s responsibility as an inshore lifeboat station for the RNLI – a responsibility it discharged up until 2013. At the same time, work started on a smaller series of beach-launchable boats, – ft long, designated &quot;MX1&quot;–&quot;MX6&quot;) to support lifeguards on local beaches.

All the above boats’ hulls were built from plywood. In summer 1968, student Paul Jefferies designed and constructed a hull (&quot;X10&quot;) from fiberglass, which was not a success due to lack of strength. However, that development led to the building of &quot;Psychedelic Surfer&quot;, a twin-engined RIB, built in three weeks by two college students (Willem de Vogel and Otto van Voorst, assisted by Roy Thomson, college carpenter) for John Caulcutt, Graeme Dillon and Simon de’Ath to race in the 1969 Round Britain Powerboat Race, in which it finished 19th (out of 65 starters) and became the darling the fleet.

From that time, the RNLI transferred development to its research centre in Cowes, who took the Atlantic College designs and developed from them the &quot;Atlantic 21&quot; class of inshore lifeboats which entered service from 1970 through 2007. Atlantic 21-class lifeboat provides a class history of this vessel.

The first commercially saleable RIB was introduced in 1967 by Tony and Edward Lee-Elliott of Flatacraft, and patented by Admiral Desmond Hoare in 1969 after research and development at Atlantic College.

The first commercial RIB is believed to be the Avon Rubber &quot;Searider&quot; which was launched at the January 1969 London Boat Show.

The 108th Engineering Heritage Award by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers was presented to UWC Atlantic College on 30 July 2017 by Carolyn Griffiths, President of the IMeche, for its development of the X Alpha Rigid Inflatable Boat.

The definitive history of the development of the RHIB was written by David Sutcliffe, successor head of Atlantic College following Desmond Hoare’s retirement. 

On Canada’s west coast Strait of Juan de Fuca near Race Rocks students of sister Pacific College along with Atlantic College sea rescue service grads in 1974 home built the first RHIB based on the Atlantic 21 surfing, open transom version in North America and the first inboard - outboard stern drive RHIB. These craft were loaned to the Pacific Region Cdn Coast Guard (Department of Transport) new inshore rescue boat service for trial and evaluation prior to CWLucas (now Zodiac) Hurricane fast hard hull inflatables being adopted by that service.

===Introduction to North America===

In the mid-1970s Avon tubes for two 21-foot RHIBs were ordered by the recently opened sister school of Atlantic College that had been established on the west coast of Canada, the Lester B. Pearson United World College of the Pacific, at Pedder Bay near Race Rocks, British Columbia in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Three former Atlantic College students built the first hull during the summer of 1974. Three more graduates who likewise were trained as RNLI inshore lifeboat coxswains worked at the school during its inaugural year and coached some Pacific College students to build and operate the two boats, which were referred to as X-27, propelled by twin outboard engines and X-28, propelled by inboard-outboard stern drive.

During summer, the college loaned their fast rescue craft to the Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) on the west coast, which was introducing rigid inflatables into its then new summer seasonal inshore rescue boat service operation. Meanwhile, CCG inshore rescue stations on the Great Lakes were started up utilizing 5.4 metre (18 ft) Avon Seariders in the late 1970s. The CCG&#x27;s inshore rescue boat crews included university students during the summer, in part due to the success of the student crews operating these ever-buoyant rescue craft at the Atlantic and Pearson Colleges.

===Introduction to the southern hemisphere===

The first inflatable boat manufacturer in the Southern Hemisphere is Lancer Industries Ltd, of Auckland, New Zealand in 1971. The founder Chris Marks had visited Europe and brought the concept to NZ. He pioneered many of the initial inflatable boat construction and material methods. Lancers innovate designs and engineering approach to inflatable design still applies and the company holds many patents. Lancer is noted for manufacturing large RIBs, in 1987 it provided tubes for a 17m RIB and then 19 the late 1990s Protector (Rayglass) of New Zealand built two 20m RIB support boats for the Americas Cup which were tubes by Lancer.

In 1976 Steve Schmidt introduced the RHIB concept to New Zealand under the brand Naiad. While it was slow to be accepted for the first few years, it gained momentum with police, Rescue, marine farmers and Government agencies.

The Naiad RHIB developed by Steve Schmidt differed from the existing RHIB designs in two ways. It had a twin skin, incorporating an air retaining inner and a robust replaceable outer. These were held in place by tracks. This system allowed for easy removal of the outer or inner for repair or replacement. The other feature was the unusually deep variable V hull with extreme turned down chines aft.

In 1978 the demand grew for more protection in the form of an integral cabin and outboard well to protect the crew in adverse conditions. Though basic to start with cabins soon became more sophisticated. Naiad were one of the early pioneers in designing RHIBs and models range from 2.5m to 23m.

In the 2010s, the traditional RHIB was reimagined using High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) as the hull material. HDPE, an engineered polymer, possesses a number of properties which make it a superior marine construction material for RHIB&#x27;s. Of note, it absorbs vibration leading to a quieter, more comfortable ride, with less slamming load transferred to operators. HDPE does not corrode, or suffer from electrolysis, reducing maintenance costs and increasing operational availability. It was the PFG Group, of Hobart, Tasmania, who recognised and applied the advantages into RHIB construction. In partnership with One2Three Naval Architects, Stuart Downham of PFG developed a range of RHIB designs and builds which have such significantly favourable characteristics in the water that the future of RHIB&#x27;s and high performance small watercraft will shift towards HDPE as the preferred hull material.

In 1979, Gemini Marine based in Cape Town started building RIBs for the local market. Early on they joined forces with the NSRI and started to design and build rescue craft for the South African Sea Rescue Institution.

==General characteristics==


RIBs are commonly four to nine metres (13 to 28 ft) long, although they can range in length between 2.5 and 18 metres (7.5 and 55 ft). A RIB is often propelled by one or more outboard motors or an inboard motor turning a water jet or stern drive. Generally, the power of the motors is in the range of .
RIBs are used as rescue craft, safety boats for sailing, dive boats or tenders for larger boats and ships. Their shallow draught, high maneuverability, speed and relative immunity to damage in low-speed collisions are advantages in these applications.

RIBs up to about seven metres in length can be towed on trailers on the road; this, coupled with their other properties, is making them increasingly attractive as leisure craft.

===Performance===
RIBs are designed with planing hulls. Due to their low weight, RIBs often outperform some types of similarly sized and powered boats.

RIBs can also generally cope better with rougher seas, although this may be partially due to an increased level of confidence in knowing that a RIB is hard to sink, and better absorption of heavy loads by the flexible tubes, which therefore make heavy seas less unpleasant.

The maximum speed of the RIB depends on its gross weight, power, length and profile of hull, and sea conditions. A typical seaborne RIB, with six passengers, engines, in Beaufort force 2 is very likely to have a top speed of around . High-Performance RIBs may operate with a speed between , depending on the size and weight.

==Uses==

Uses include work boats (supporting shore facilities or larger ships) in trades that operate on the water, military craft, where they are used in patrol roles and to transport troops between vessels or ashore, and lifeboats.

RIBs and ordinary inflatable boats are often used by scuba divers to reach dive sites.
==Construction==
===Hull===
The hull is made of steel, wood, aluminium, or more commonly, a combination of wood for the structure and glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) composite for the shaped and smooth surface. Some manufacturers also weave Kevlar into the GRP sheets for extra strength. The hull of a RIB is shaped to increase the performance of the boat in the water by optimising its hydroplaning characteristics. &quot;Deep-V&quot; hulls cut through waves easily but require greater engine power to start planing than &quot;shallow-V&quot; hulls, which plane at lower speed but with a more uncomfortable ride. As with the design of most boat hulls they represent a compromise of different design characteristics. Modern &quot;all round&quot; RIB hulls combine a deep v hull at the bow which flattens out to present a broad planing pad. This is a flat area on the rear of the hull designed to allow the boat to have a stable surface to plane on.

===Tubes===
The tubes are usually constructed and then partitioned with separate chambers to reduce the effect of a puncture, each with a valve to add or remove air and more recently pressure release valves. Larger boats (7m+) have six or more chambers with a valve and pressure release for each chamber. If only one of these chambers is punctured, the rest of the chambers will still provide buoyancy, providing redundancy. In recent years, tubes tend to be fitted with both valves and pressure relief valves. As temperature increases, the air inside the tube expands, opening the pressure release valves. This prevents the tubes bursting from overpressure. Common materials for the tubes are Hypalon and PVC (Polyvinyl chloride), though some manufacturers use PU (Polyurethane).

====Hypalon====
Chlorosulfonated Polyethylene(csm) registered under the trade name hypalon.

Tubes made of hypalon (csm/cr) are easy to manufacture and can be repaired with simple puncture repair kits. Hypalon (csm) is not airtight and so must be combined with neoprene (cr) when used to build tubes. Tubes made with Hypalon and Neoprene layers can last up to twice as long as PVC tubes and have been known to last over 20 years. Hypalon is probably the most popular material used for the construction of RIBs manufactured in the UK. 

====Polyvinyl chloride====
As a material for building tubes, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) has the disadvantage of lacking flexibility. To make it supple, an additive is used with the polymer. This additive vaporizes as the material ages, making the PVC brittle and allowing it to crack. A PVC tube is the cheapest option and can last approximately 10–15 years.

PVC does have some advantages, it is cheap, it can be welded, and it is guaranteed for longer than hypalon. PVC RIBs are usually very well made and with welded seams they are less prone to blowouts and leaks. 

A newer form of PVC has made its way into production. Known as valmex it is said to have a blackout layer on the inside to reduce UV damage to the adhesives usually used to fix tubes to the hulls and various other parts.

====Polyurethane====
Tubes made of polyurethane (PU) are difficult to manufacture and are consequently not often used for RHIB construction. PU has an advantage of being very tough, it can be made knife-proof or bulletproof. Earlier PU had a disadvantage of aging quickly, but newer types are much more resistant to degradation when exposed to ultraviolet-light. The issue with most of the older PU built RIBs is theUV rays and heat penetrate the fabric and, much like with PVC, destroy the adhesive bond. More recent fabrics are said to have a blackout layer to help combat UV rays.

While PU tubes have been thermal welded, fittings and attachments will still usually be bonded using adhesives. A high-quality PU-made tube lasts over 20 years. PU tubes are often to be found on commercial RIBs, in applications where strength and durability are needed. Replacing the tubes when they wear out usually costs one third as much as the complete RIB.
===Wheelhouse/cabins===

Larger RIBs can have hard-tops or wheelhouses made of GRP or aluminium. Wheelhouses offer protection from the elements to both the crew and passengers – and can also protect equipment such as suspension seats and navigation equipment. Some RIB manufacturers, particularly those popular in Ireland and the West Coast of Scotland provide optional canopies which form fabric and perspex wheelhouses but can be easily removed in good weather. Increasingly, RIBs are becoming available with small cabins (usually with accommodation for two people and in some cases sea toilets or chemical toilets), widening the application of RIBs as cruising craft.

==== Seafari setup ====
Seafari boats are set up to accommodate tourists for a typically smaller duration. Typical setups use jockey seating to accommodate passengers. Coding in the UK and the EU typically limits the number of passengers to 12 while in some countries, such as Poland, more seats are placed on the boat. Thrill rides are common with high speeds and turns adding to their lure.

===Tube replacement===

Often also known as tube replacement, collar replacement, retubing, re-tube, this is where the old damaged or worn out tube is removed and new tubes are fitted, this is common practice and are known to be replaced with new hypalon, pvc and Polyurethane Tubes however most commonly hypalon unless the boat has a slide on tube rail, luff system implemented.

==Foldable rigid inflatable boat (FRIB)==
A foldable rigid inflatable boat has a 3-section articulated folding rigid hull. The hull sections have interlocking tabs and slots, held together by the pressure in the tubes. Once assembled it&#x27;s difficult to tell they fold. Once inflated, they are fully rigid.

==Flying inflatable boat (FIB)==

A flying inflatable boat, or FIB, is a RIB with microlight-type wings and air propeller. &quot;FIB&quot; is used as a model name by Polaris Motor of Italy for their Polaris FIB.

==Amphibious rigid inflatable boat (amphibious RIB)==

The amphibious rigid inflatable boat is designed with a four wheels drive system consisting of motorized, retractable and steerable wheels.

<text>United States Ship (abbreviated as USS or U.S.S.) is a ship prefix used to identify a commissioned ship of the United States Navy and applies to a ship only while it is in commission. Before commissioning, the vessel may be referred to as a &quot;pre-commissioning unit&quot; (PCU), but is officially referred to by name with no prefix. After decommissioning, it is referred to by name with no prefix, though people commonly refer to those ships with the prefix &quot;ex-&quot;, as in ex-&quot;ship name&quot;. In-service but non-commissioned Navy ships go by the prefix USNS, which stands for United States Naval Ship.

From the early beginnings of the U.S. Navy there had been no standard method of referring to U.S. Navy ships until 1907 when President Theodore Roosevelt issued Executive Order 549 on 8 January stating that all U.S. Navy ships were to be referred to as &quot;The name of such vessel, preceded by the words, United States Ship, or the letters U.S.S., and by no other words or letters&quot;.

Today&#x27;s Navy Regulations define the classification and status of naval ships and craft:

#The Chief of Naval Operations shall be responsible for ... the assignment of classification for administrative purposes to water-borne craft and the designation of status for each ship and service craft.
#Commissioned vessels and craft shall be called &quot;United States Ship&quot; or &quot;U.S.S.&quot;
#Civilian crewed ships, of the Military Sealift Command or other commands, designated &quot;active status, in service&quot; shall be called &quot;United States Naval Ship&quot; or &quot;U.S.N.S.&quot;
#Ships and service craft designated &quot;active status, in service,&quot; except those described by paragraph 3 of this article, shall be referred to by name, when assigned, classification, and hull number (e.g., &quot;HIGH POINT PCH-1&quot; or &quot;YOGN-8&quot;).

<text>Rasmus Villads Christian Ferdinand Winther (29 July 1796 – 30 December 1876) was a Danish lyric poet. 

He was born at Fensmark near Næstved, where his father was the vicar. He went to the University of Copenhagen in 1815, and studied theology, taking his degree in 1824. He began to publish verse in 1819, but no collected volume appeared until 1828. Meanwhile, from 1824 to 1830, Winther was supporting himself as a tutor. A large inheritance from his uncle, Rasmus Winther, allowed him in 1830 to travel to Italy for a year. In 1835 a second volume of lyric poems appeared, and in 1838 a third. In 1841 King Christian VIII of Denmark appointed Winther to travel to Mecklenburg to instruct Princess Mariane, on the occasion of her betrothal to the Crown Prince of Denmark, in the Danish language. When he was over fifty, Winther married.

Further collections of lyrics appeared in 1842, 1848, 1850, 1853, 1865 and 1872. In 1851 he, who had for most of his life been pestered by heavy debts, received a pension from the state as a poet, and for the next quarter of a century he resided mainly in Paris.

Besides the nine or ten volumes of lyrical verse mentioned above, Winther published &quot;Hjortens Flugt&quot; (&quot;The Stag&#x27;s Flight&quot;), an epical romance in verse (1855). Taking place in 15th century South Zealand, written in Nibelungenlied stanzas and probably inspired by Byron&#x27;s &quot;Mazeppa&quot;, it tells about young love, demonic forces and witchcraft with a running stag as the reappearing motive of the untamed forces of Nature. However, in the lyric intervals it also praises the idylls and freedom of Nature. In generations it became a traditional confirmation present for Danish youths in that respect competing with Paludan-Müller&#x27;s &quot;Adam Homo&quot;.

Many of Winther&#x27;s shorter poems have won popularity and have been transformed into songs, for instance &quot;Flyv fugl, flyv&quot; – (&quot;Fly, Bird, fly&quot;), and some of the verses from his collection &quot;Til Een&quot;, 1842, (&quot;For One&quot;), a tribute to his wife. A classic is also the small humorous epic poem for children: &quot;Flugten til Amerika&quot; 1830, (Engl. Transl. &quot;The Flight to America&quot;, 1976). Besides must be mentioned &quot;In the Year of Grace&quot;, a novel (1874); and other works in prose.

As a lover of woman and Nature, Winther is perhaps one of the Danish authors who is most closely connected to the concept of a romantic poet. Many later Danish lyrics have been inspired by his verses. His special ability of making Nature accompanying the action and his elegant and, compared with his time, rather sensual tributes to women was something new. Through &quot;The Stag&#x27;s Flight&quot;, his main work, he won the name of &quot;The Singer of Zealand&quot;.

He died in Paris, but his body was brought to Denmark, and was buried in the heart of the woods.

<text>Holger Henrik Herholdt Drachmann (9 October 1846 – 14 January 1908) was a Danish poet, dramatist and painter. He was a member of the Skagen artistic colony and became a figure of the Scandinavian Modern Breakthrough Movement.

==Early years==
Drachmann was born in Copenhagen, Denmark. He was the son of Andreas Georg Drachmann (1810–1892) and Wilhelmine Marie Stæhr (1820–1857). His father was a surgeon with the Royal Danish Navy. The family belonged to the German-speaking congregation at St. Peter&#x27;s Church (&quot;Sankt Petri Kirke&quot;) in Copenhagen.

Owing to the early death of his mother, he was left much to his own devices and developed a fondness for semi-poetical performances, organising his companions in heroic games, in which he himself took such roles as those of Royal Danish Naval heroes Peder Tordenskjold and Niels Juel.
==Skagen==
Drachmann first visited Skagen in 1872 with the Norwegian painter Frits Thaulow. He frequently returned, associating with the growing colony of artists known as the Skagen Painters (&quot;Skagensmalerne&quot;) although his painting took second place to his writing. In 1903, he and his third wife Soffi settled in Skagen&#x27;s Vesterby in their Villa Pax. Later in life, Drachmann returned to art, often painting pictures of ships and the sea.

== Personal life==
Holger was sent to Bornholm to learn to paint. There he met his first wife Vilhelmine Erichsen (1852–1935), whom he married in 1871 in Gentofte. They had one daughter, Eva. In 1874, his marriage ended. He was then involved with a married woman named Polly for a short while. Shortly after she gave birth to a daughter, she broke contact with him. He then met with a young girl in Hamburg by the name of Emmy. They fell in love and got married. They adopted Polly&#x27;s daughter and had four more children of their own. In 1887, she became seriously ill, and one of their daughters died the same year. Perhaps suffering from stress, he fled into a relation with cabaret singer Amanda Nielsen (1866–1953), whom he called Edith and who became his biggest muse. He would have many muses in his life, but on his deathbed he said that his two biggest muses were &quot;Vilhelmine&quot; and &quot;Edith&quot;. He died in Copenhagen and is buried in the sand dunes at Grenen, near Skagen. After his death his Skagen home, Drachmanns Hus, became a museum.
==Career ==

Behind in his studies, he did not enter university until 1865, leaving it in 1866 to become a student at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. From 1866 to 1870, he learned, under Professor C F Sørensen, to become a marine painter, with some success. In about 1870 he came under the influence of Danish critic and scholar Georg Brandes (1842–1927) and without abandoning art, began to devote most of his time more to literature. At various periods he travelled very extensively in England, Scotland, France, Spain and Italy, and his literary career began by his sending letters about his journeys to the Danish newspapers.

After returning home, he settled for some time on the island of Bornholm, achieving fame for his painting of seascapes and ships in storms. He then issued his earliest volume of poems in 1872 with &quot;Digte&quot;, going on to join the group of young Radical writers who followed Brandes. Drachmann was unsettled, and still doubted whether his real strength lay in the pencil or in the pen. By this time he had enjoyed a surprising experience of life, especially among sailors, fishermen, students and artists, and the issues of the Franco-German War and the Paris Commune had persuaded him that a new and glorious era was at hand.

His volume of lyrics, &quot;Dæmpede Melodier&quot; (&quot;Muffled Melodies&quot;, 1875), proved that Drachmann was a poet with a real vocation, and he began to produce books in prose and verse with great rapidity. &quot;Ungt Blod&quot; (&quot;Young Blood&quot;, 1876) contained three realistic stories of contemporary life. But he returned to his true field in his most famous work, the collection of poems &quot;Sange ved Havet; Venezia&quot; (&quot;Songs of the Sea; Venice&quot;, 1877), and won the passionate admiration of his countrymen by his prose work, with interludes in verse, called &quot;Derovre fra grænsen&quot; (&quot;Over the Frontier there&quot;, 1877), a series of impressions made on Drachmann by a visit to the scenes of the war with Germany. Drachman&#x27;s novel &quot;En Overkomplet&quot; (1876) was followed by &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; (1877), which despite reference to the medieval legend and Wagner&#x27;s opera from 1845, is a contemporary love story set in Fredensborg. The poems from the novel were set by various Danish composers, including Peter Heise&#x27;s cycle &quot;Farlige Drømme&quot;.

During the succeeding years he visited most of the principal countries of the world, but particularly familiarizing himself, by protracted voyages, with the sea and with the life of man in maritime places. In 1879 he published &quot;Ranker og Roser&quot; (&quot;Tendrils and Roses&quot;), amatory lyrics of a very high order of melody, in which he showed a great advance in technical art. To the same period belongs &quot;Paa sømands tro og love&quot; (&quot;On the Faith and Honor of a Sailor&quot;, 1878), a volume of short stories in prose.

It was about this time that Drachmann broke with Brandes and the Radicals, and set himself at the head of a sort of nationalist or popular-Conservative movement in Denmark. He continued to celebrate the life of the fishermen and sailors in books, whether in prose or verse, which were the most popular of their day. &quot;Paul og Virginie&quot; and &quot;Lars Kruse&quot; (both 1879); &quot;Østen for sol og vesten for maane&quot; (&quot;East of the Sun and West of the Moon&quot;, 1880); &quot;Puppe og Sommerfugl&quot; (&quot;Chrysalis and Butterfly&quot;, 1882); and &quot;Strandby Folk&quot; (1883) were among these. At the beginning of the 1890s he again joined the Brandes fraction without giving up his national motives. His many changing sides has often been regarded as opportunism but were probably caused by his eternal enthusiasm and longing for a positive fundament of his art.

In 1882, Drachmann published his fine translation, or paraphrase, of Byron&#x27;s &quot;Don Juan&quot;. In 1885, his romantic play &quot;Der var engang&quot; (&quot;Once upon a Time&quot;) had a great success on the boards of the Royal Danish Theatre in Copenhagen, and has remained a classic. His tragedies &quot;Vølund Smed&quot; (&quot;Wayland the Smith&quot;, 1894) and &quot;Brav-karl&quot; (1897) established him as the most popular playwright of Denmark. In 1894, he published a volume of fantastic &quot;Melodramas&quot; in rhymed verse, a collection which contains some of Drachmann&#x27;s best work.
His novel &quot;Med den brede Pensel&quot; (&quot;With a Broad Brush&quot;, 1887) was followed in 1890 by &quot;Forskrevet&quot;, the history of a young painter, &quot;Henrik Gerhard&quot;, and his revolt against his bourgeois surroundings. Closely connected to this novel is &quot;Den hellige Ild&quot; (&quot;The Sacred Fire&quot;, 1899), in which Drachmann speaks in his own person. There is practically no story in this autobiographical volume, which abounds in lyrical passages. In 1899, he produced his romantic play &quot;Gurre&quot;; in 1900 a brilliant lyrical drama, &quot;Hallfred Vandraadeskjald&quot;; and in 1903, &quot;Det grønne Haab&quot;.

==Legacy==
Drachmann is one of the most popular Danish poets of modern time though much of his work is now forgotten. He unites modern rebellionist attitudes and a really romantic view of women and history. His personal appearance often almost overshadowed his literary merits and in many ways he played the role of the &quot;typical&quot; bohemian poet with a turbulent private life. His relationship with various women (his &quot;muses&quot;) often made a great scandal but it was the fuel of his inspiration. Especially &quot;Edith&quot;, a cabaret singer who was his mistress during the 1890s and inspired much of his best love poetry. His often rhetorical approach to poetry and occasional &quot;wordiness&quot; has led some critics to compare him with English poet, playwright and novelist Algernon Charles Swinburne (1837–1909).

<text>USS &quot;Whipple&quot; (DD- 217/AG-117), a was the second ship of the United States Navy named in honor of Commodore Abraham Whipple (1733–1819), who served in the Continental Navy.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Whipple&quot; was laid down on 12 June and launched 6 November 1919 from William Cramp &amp; Sons; sponsored by Mrs. Gladys V. Mulvey, great-great-great granddaughter of Abraham Whipple; and commissioned on 23 April 1920.

==Service history==

===1920 to World War II===
Following shakedown training out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, &quot;Whipple&quot; returned to Philadelphia for post-shakedown availability. The destroyer sailed for the Near East on 29 May 1920 and arrived at Constantinople (renamed Istanbul in 1923), Turkey, on 13 June. For the next eight months, she operated in the region of the Black Sea and eastern Mediterranean, under the overall command of Admiral Mark L. Bristol, Commander, U.S. Naval Detachment in Near Eastern Waters. At this time, the entire Near East was in turmoil due to changes caused by, and in the wake of, World War I.

&quot;Whipple&quot; delivered mail to the destroyer at Samsun, Turkey, on 16 June and landed British American Tobacco company representatives whom the destroyer had transported from Constantinople. She next visited Sevastopol, in the Russian Crimea, and Constanţa, Romania. Unexpectedly ordered to Batum, Georgia, &quot;Whipple&quot; departed Samsun on 6 July and made to reach her destination the next day. There, she attended the peaceful transfer of the city to Georgia&#x27;s control from British troops, which had been stationed there since the end of World War I.

&quot;Whipple&quot; then shifted south for a brief cruise along the Levantine coast during which she visited Beirut and Damascus, Syria and Port Said, Egypt, before she returned to Constantinople on 18 August. While she was making this cruise, the sweeping Navy-wide designation of hull numbers took place and &quot;Whipple&quot; was classified as DD-217 on 17 July 1920. The destroyer next resumed her previous routine on the Black Sea route, carrying mail between ports (including dispatches for consulates and the like), and observing conditions prevailing at the ports visited in Romania, Russia, and Asiatic Turkey.

While underway on 19 October, &quot;Whipple&quot; sighted distress signals from Greek steamer &quot;Thetis&quot; and proceeded to the stricken vessel&#x27;s assistance, as she lay aground off Constanţa. After 10 hours, the destroyer succeeded in freeing &quot;Thetis&quot; from her predicament and earned a commendation from her division commander. The citation lauded Lieutenant Commander Bernard&#x27;s display of initiative and his excellent handling of the ship in shoal waters with a heavy sea running. &quot;The whole affair,&quot; the citation concluded, &quot;... reflected great credit on the &quot;Whipple&quot; and the United States Naval Service.&quot;

In the meantime, while &quot;Whipple&quot; conducted her patrols, the situation in the Russian Civil War was changing. &quot;Whipple&quot; convoyed the disabled American steamer SS &quot;Haddon&quot; into Constantinople and later fueled at Constanţa where she learned that Russian Bolshevik troops were approaching the Crimea. Baron General Pyotr Wrangel, commanding the White Russian forces in the area, pulled his force back to Sevastopol in a rear-guard action, from where the Whites evacuated to sea in a wide variety of craft to escape the oncoming Bolshevik forces.

&quot;Whipple&quot; arrived at Sevastopol on the morning of 14 November and reported to Vice Admiral Newton A. McCully for orders. Hundreds of boats were present in the harbor, often crammed to the gunwales with evacuating White Russians. In addition to &quot;Whipple&quot;, cruiser and two destroyers, and , stood by to evacuate selected individuals bearing passes from Admiral McCully.

During the entire time &quot;Whipple&quot; remained at Sevastopol, her main battery was trained out and manned. Armed boat crews carried evacuees out to the ship while her landing force stood in readiness. As her last boatload pushed off from shore, Bolshevik troops reached the main square and began firing on the fleeing White Russians; &quot;Whipple&quot; had completed the mission just in time.

&quot;Whipple&quot; then towed a barge loaded with wounded White Russian troops out of range of the Bolshevik guns and then turned the tow over to &quot;Humphreys&quot;. As &quot;Whipple&quot; passed &quot;Overton&quot;, McCully, on the latter&#x27;s bridge, called out by megaphone &quot;well done, &quot;Whipple&quot;.&quot; The last American vessel out of Sevastopol, the destroyer headed for Constantinople with her passengers, both topside and below decks. Each carried very few belongings, had no food, and possessed very little money. Many were sick or wounded.

After disembarking the refugees at Constantinople, &quot;Whipple&quot; resumed her station ship and mail carrying duties with the Near Eastern Naval Detachment and continued the task through the end of 1920 and into the spring of 1921. On 2 May 1921, the destroyer, along with her division mates, sailed for the Far East, transiting the Suez Canal and called at Bombay, India; Colombo, Ceylon; Batavia, Java; Singapore, Straits Settlements; and Saigon, French Indochina. She arrived at her new home port, Cavite, Philippine Islands, near Manila, on 29 June. For the next four years, the destroyer served in the Asiatic Fleet, &quot;showing the flag&quot; and standing ready to protect American lives and property in strife-torn China. She operated out of Cavite in the winter months, conducting tactical exercises in the Philippines until heading north to North China ports in the spring for summer operations out of Tsingtao.

Warfare between local warlords around Shanghai in late 1924 and early 1925 resulted in &quot;Whipple&#x27;s&quot; being called upon to serve as a transport. On 15 January 1925, the Marine Detachment from went ashore to protect American property, while about the same time, an expeditionary force of Marines, led by Captain James P. Schwerin, USMC, embarked in &quot;Whipple&quot;, , and . The three destroyers landed the Marines on 22 January, relieving the 28-man detachment from the gunboat at that time.

On 18 May 1925, &quot;Whipple&quot; and her division sailed for the United States, via Guam, Midway, and Pearl Harbor, and arrived at San Diego on 17 June. Five days later, the ship got underway for the United States East Coast; and she arrived at Norfolk on 17 July. She next operated off the U.S. East Coast from Maine to Florida and cruised to Guantanamo Bay for maneuvers with the Fleet. During this time, &quot;Whipple&quot; put ashore a landing force in Nicaragua to protect American lives and property threatened by the banditry and unrest. On four separate instances, in late 1926 and early 1927, a landing party from the destroyer served on shore, earning the ship the Second Nicaraguan Campaign Medal.

&quot;Whipple&quot; departed Norfolk on 26 May 1927 to begin a cruise with her division to northern European ports. She then steamed south for a brief tour in the Mediterranean before departing Gibraltar on 29 January 1928 and heading for Cuba. She conducted operations in the Caribbean out of Guantanamo Bay, until 26 March when she set course for the United States West Coast. She operated in the Pacific out of the Destroyer Base at San Diego, California, until 1 August 1929. &quot;Whipple&quot; departed the U.S. West Coast, bound for the Asiatic Station and her second tour with the Asiatic Fleet.

&quot;Whipple&quot; spent the next decade with the Asiatic Fleet, watching the rising ascendancy of Japan over China and the Far East. She resumed the routine common to ships of her type with the Fleet: winter exercises in the Philippine Islands and summer maneuvers out of Tsingtao, China, with cruises to Chinese coastal ports in the interim. On 8 February 1932 she collided with the British steamer in the Yangtze at Shanghai, China, and suffered severe damage.

While on exercises in Subic Bay during the spring of 1936, &quot;Whipple&quot; and the destroyer collided on 14 April. The latter suffered such serious damage in the accident that she had to be scrapped. As a consequence, &quot;Whipple&quot;, whose own bow had been bent around until it faced sternward, received &quot;Smith Thompson&quot;&#x27;s undamaged bow and soon reentered active service.

Meanwhile, tension between China and Japan continued to worsen, particularly in North China. These long-simmering antagonisms erupted in open fighting near Peking on 7 July 1937, which soon became an all-out war in the vicinity. Two weeks later, a small squadron of Asiatic Fleet units, including &quot;Whipple&quot;, sailed from Chefoo on 24 July. The destroyer, in company with , &quot;Barker&quot;, and , rendezvoused with on the 25th, en route to the coast of Siberia. The five ships arrived at Vladivostok, USSR, on the 28th.

The visit, the first by American men-of-war since the establishment of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union in 1933, lasted until 1 August when the five ships headed back to China. Within the next fortnight, while the Fleet continued its routine, hostilities broke out between Chinese and Japanese forces at Shanghai, and the Second Sino-Japanese War entered a new phase.

The Fleet continued its mission of observing the conflict, standing ready to evacuate Americans from Chinese ports should the occasion arise. By mid-1938, when the war had moved inland and up the Yangtze, the Fleet resumed its former routine. &quot;Whipple&quot; and her division mates, in company with , visited Bangkok, Siam, in June 1938.

The Japanese captured most of the major coastal cities and ports and those along the lower Yangtze, and opportunities for trouble multiplied for the western nations still trying to maintain their interests in China. In the spring of 1939, one such occasion came at Amoy, China, where a Chinese gunman shot a Japanese citizen. The Japanese responded by landing Special Naval Landing Force personnel near the International Settlement of Koolangsu. The British and Americans did likewise, landing bluejackets from and the British light cruiser &quot;Birmingham&quot;. By September 1939, &quot;Whipple&quot; was serving as station ship at Amoy, her landing force ashore and Captain John T. G. Stapler, Commander, South China Patrol, embarked on board.

At 2355 on 3 September 1939, &quot;Whipple&quot;″s deck log noted that France had declared war on Germany, two days after German troops invaded Poland. World War II had begun in Europe, substantially altering the balance of power in the Orient as Britain pulled out much of her China Station fleet to bolster the Home and Mediterranean Fleets. &quot;Whipple&quot; operated on neutrality patrol off the Philippines into 1941, as Admiral Thomas C. Hart prepared the small Asiatic Fleet for war.

===World War II===
On 25 November 1941, two days in advance of the &quot;war warning&quot; which predicted that hostile Japanese action in the Pacific Ocean was imminent, Admiral Hart dispatched Destroyer Division (DesDiv) 57 (&quot;Whipple&quot;, , and ) with the destroyer tender , to Balikpapan, Borneo, to disperse the surface ships of his fleet from their vulnerable position in Manila Bay.

Originally slated to join a British force based around the battleship and the battlecruiser , &quot;Whipple&quot;″s mission was aborted when Japanese land-based torpedo planes and high-level bombers sank both of these capital ships in the South China Sea off Kuantan, Malaya, on 10 December. &quot;Whipple&quot; arrived at Singapore on 11 December and departed on 14 December, bound for the Netherlands East Indies.

Fighting a desperate rearguard action in the face of a swift-moving and well-organized enemy, the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDA) force faced formidable obstacles as they withdrew to the &quot;Malay Barrier.&quot; During this time, &quot;Whipple&quot; conducted escort and patrol duties into February 1942. On 12 February, the destroyer got underway from Prigi Bay, Java, in a dense fog. As she headed for Tjilatjap, on the south coast of Java, she was struck a glancing blow by the Royal Netherlands Navy light cruiser &quot;De Ruyter&quot;. As the Dutch ship emerged from the murk, &quot;Whipple&quot; alertly swung left to avoid a collision, a move that averted more serious damage. Drydocked at Tjilatjap on 13 February, &quot;Whipple&quot; ascertained the damage to be minor and rejoined the fleet for active service.

At 1640 on 26 February, &quot;Whipple&quot; and sister ship &quot;Edsall&quot; departed Tjilatjap to rendezvous with the seaplane tender off the south coast of Java. Making contact with her at 0629 on 27 February, the destroyers took up screening positions to escort the vulnerable ship and its vital cargo of 32 P-40 fighters and U.S. Army Air Force (USAAF) personnel to Tjilatjap. At 1150, lookouts spotted nine Japanese high-level bombers approaching from the east. Four minutes later, a stick of bombs splashed around &quot;Langley&quot;, which was clearly the focus of Japanese attention. During a second attack shortly after noon, the three warships put up brisk antiaircraft fire.

&quot;Langley&quot;″s evasive maneuvers were not sufficient to prevent the Japanese hitting her with several bombs at 1212, setting the former aircraft carrier on fire and causing flooding.

&quot;Whipple&quot; broke off firing at 1224 as the attackers veered away in a northeasterly direction. She and &quot;Edsall&quot; approached &quot;Langley&quot; to assist, and shortly thereafter, four Japanese fighter planes dove on them, but were driven off with one plane damaged by antiaircraft fire.

&quot;Langley&quot; was so severely damaged that her captain gave the order to abandon ship at 1325, and &quot;Whipple&quot; came alongside to rescue survivors, using two of the destroyer&#x27;s life rafts, a cargo net slung over the side, and a number of lines trailed over the side. &quot;Whipple&quot; picked up 308 men from &quot;Langley&#x27;s&quot; crew and passengers while &quot;Edsall&quot; picked up 177 survivors. At 1358, the rescue completed, &quot;Whipple&quot; stood off to scuttle &quot;Langley&quot;, opening fire at 1429 with her 4-inch main battery. After nine rounds of 4-inch and two torpedoes, &quot;Langley&quot; settled lower and lower but refused stubbornly to sink. Soon, orders arrived directing &quot;Whipple&quot; and &quot;Edsall&quot; to clear the area prior to any more bombing attacks.
Both destroyers departed the area and subsequently rendezvoused with the oiler off Christmas Island to transfer the &quot;Langley&quot; survivors to the oiler. At 1020 on 27 February, three Japanese twin-engined bombers attacked Christmas Island. One singled out &quot;Whipple&quot; and dropped a stick of bombs which missed the rapidly dodging destroyer. The three ships headed south to get out of Japanese land-based aircraft range and completed transferring the survivors to On 28 February, &quot;Whipple&quot; began transferring &quot;Langley&quot; crew members to &quot;Pecos&quot;, completing the task by 0800 on 1 March. While one destroyer transferred personnel, the other circled and maintained an antisubmarine screen. When the transfer was completed, the two destroyers parted company with the oiler. Changing course in anticipation of orders to retire from Java, &quot;Whipple&quot; prepared to send a message relative to these orders when the destroyer&#x27;s chief radioman heard a call for help over the radio from &quot;Pecos&quot;, then under attack by Japanese bombers near Christmas Island.

&quot;Whipple&quot; sped to the scene to render assistance if possible. Throughout the afternoon, as the destroyer closed the oiler, all hands on board prepared knotted lines and cargo nets for use in picking up survivors. &quot;Whipple&quot; went to general quarters at 1922 when she sighted several small lights off both bows.

&quot;Whipple&quot; slowly closed and began picking up survivors of &quot;Pecos&quot;. After interrupting the proceedings to conduct an unsuccessful attack on a submarine thought to be nearby, she returned to the task and continued the search until she had received 231 men from the oiler. &quot;Whipple&quot; soon cleared the area, believing that a Japanese aircraft carrier was close. Within a few days, Java fell to the Japanese who were gradually consolidating their expanding &quot;Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.&quot; &quot;Whipple&quot; joined what remained of the Asiatic Fleet in Australian waters.

Subsequently sailing to Melbourne, Australia, and arriving on 23 March, &quot;Whipple&quot; operated with Australian and New Zealand Navy warships on convoy escort duties along the Great Barrier Reef until 2 May. She departed Sydney on that day, bound for the New Hebrides Islands, American Samoa and Hawaii, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 6 June. Together with sister ship &quot;Alden&quot;, &quot;Whipple&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 8 June for San Francisco, escorting an eastward-bound convoy to the U.S. west coast, arriving on the 18th.

During a yard availability at Mare Island Naval Shipyard, the destroyer&#x27;s topside weight was cut down as 20-millimeter antiaircraft guns replaced two banks of her torpedo tubes. Thus modified for convoy escort work, &quot;Whipple&quot; put to sea to commence the first of seven round-trip convoy escort missions from the U.S. west coast to Hawaii which lasted into the spring of 1943.

Standing out of San Francisco Bay on 11 May 1943, &quot;Whipple&quot; sailed for the Caribbean with a convoy routed through the Panama Canal for Santa Anna Bay, Curaçao, Netherlands West Indies. After the cargo ships loaded a petroleum cargo, the convoy pushed on for Cuba and arrived at Guantanamo Bay on 29 May. From Guantanamo, the destroyer escorted a convoy to Trinidad but returned to the Cuban base on 19 June before heading north to the New York Navy Yard for voyage repairs.

Later departing New York on 10 July, &quot;Whipple&quot; escorted a group of ships which rendezvoused with a convoy bound for Casablanca, French Morocco, and Gibraltar. Returning to Charleston, South Carolina, on 27 August, the destroyer put to sea on 7 September as a unit in a slow tow convoy bound via the Caribbean Sea to Recife, Brazil. &quot;Whipple&quot; headed north soon thereafter, guarding a convoy to Trinidad, and then up the eastern seaboard to Charleston, making port on 19 November.

After another convoy escort run from Norfolk to Guantanamo Bay and the Panama Canal Zone, &quot;Whipple&quot; joined three other destroyers in completing the offensive antisubmarine task group based around the escort carrier . Departing Norfolk on 5 January 1944, the group went to sea to hunt German U-boats active in the Atlantic Ocean.

On 16 January, aircraft from &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; sighted three U-boats on the surface, fueling, some 300 miles off Flores Island. Carrier-based Avengers attacked the group and sank in the ensuing attack. After replenishing at Casablanca, the group returned to the high seas and searched convoy lanes for signs of German submarines until arriving at Norfolk on 16 February. Detached from the antisubmarine group soon thereafter, &quot;Whipple&quot; underwent voyage repairs at the Boston Navy Yard. On 13 March, the destroyer departed the U.S. east coast in company with Convoy UGS-36, bound for the Mediterranean Sea.

In the early morning darkness of 1 April, German planes - Dornier Do 217s and Junkers Ju 88s - came in low and fast to attack the convoy. Keeping up a heavy fire with her 20-millimeter batteries, &quot;Whipple&quot; sent up a substantial part of the heavy barrage which drove off the 30 German planes and saved the convoy from substantial damage. Arriving at Bizerte, Tunisia, on 3 April, the destroyer subsequently returned to Norfolk on 30 April.

For the remainder of 1944 and into the spring of 1945, &quot;Whipple&quot; performed convoy escort duties off the U.S. east coast, across the Atlantic Ocean to Casablanca, and occasionally into the Caribbean Sea. She was commanded by Captain Richard N. Reeves (USNR).

===Post-World War II===
Arriving at New London, Connecticut, on 6 June 1945, &quot;Whipple&quot; was redesignated an auxiliary, AG-117. After acting as a target ship for submarines off New London, the erstwhile destroyer entered the New York Navy Yard on 9 July for conversion to a high-speed target vessel.

On 5 August, &quot;Whipple&quot; departed New York for duty in the Pacific. Transiting the Panama Canal, the target ship proceeded via San Diego to Hawaii and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 30 August. She subsequently served as a target vessel for submarines of the Pacific training command until 21 September.

The need for her services no longer required, &quot;Whipple&quot; departed Pearl Harbor and proceeded to the U.S. East Coast, arriving at Philadelphia on 18 October. She was decommissioned on 9 November 1945, and her name was struck from the Navy list on 5 December. Stripped for scrap, the hulk was sold on 30 September 1947 to the Northern Metals Company of Philadelphia.

<text>John Heslop-Harrison FRS FAAAS (10 February 1920 – 8 May 1998) was a British soldier and botanist.

==Early life and education==
He was born in Middlesbrough to John William Heslop-Harrison and his wife Christian Henderson, the last of three children. His older brother was George Heslop-Harrison.

Soon after John&#x27;s birth, his father, at the time a teacher at Middlesbrough High School, accepted a position at the University of Durham as a lecturer in zoology, and the family moved to Birtley, his father&#x27;s place of birth. For seven years the family lived in a small wooden cabin formerly used to house World War I refugees until Jack&#x27;s father, upon his promotion to Professor of Botany, felt rich enough to buy his own house. When he was four he attended the Elizabethville Infant School, later moving to the Elizabethville Elementary School until he was 11, when he was accepted into the Chester-le-Street Secondary School. He completed the Higher School Certificate Examinations in 1938, scoring highly in chemistry and physics but not highly enough in mathematics to win the State Scholarship he required to go to the universities of Oxford or Cambridge. He took the King&#x27;s College Scholarship Examination as well, not doing well enough in chemistry to get in. After returning from a holiday in Rùm he found that one of the boys above him had dropped out, and he was now applicable for a scholarship of £60 a year to attend King&#x27;s College, Newcastle, which he did in October 1938 to study chemistry, zoology and botany.

==University life==
At university he was taught by Meirion Thomas and Kathleen B Blackburn, who had been a collaborator with his father. He also met Yolande Massey, his future wife; they took the same courses and frequently competed for top marks. The city suffered irregular bombing raids during World War II, one of which happened during one of his final examination papers, forcing them to stop and go to the service tunnels they used as an air-raid shelter. He eventually graduated with first-class honours in Biology, as did Yolande.

==World War II==
Due to his position as a university student Heslop-Harrison was given deferred entry to the armed forces after the introduction of conscription. He was provisionally given a place on a radio operator course, and as a result spent some of his remaining time at the university doing a course at the physics department on electronic wave theory, something which had no relation whatsoever to his eventual position. He was trained to operate radio equipment in relation to radar and geolocation, and towards the end of the course also got to handle the then-new cavity magnetron. He graduated first in his course and chose to be posted to Orkney. He was given a position at an AA battery near Dounby with the equivalent rank to that of second lieutenant, something the battery commander was not happy with since Heslop-Harrison was effectively a civilian. He was next commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps on 17 April 1942, and was later moved to South Ronaldsay. As part of his technical work he was a frequent visitor to the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) base on the Orkney mainland, and, after his commanding officer finally lost patience with the operating officer, Heslop-Harrison was offered a position as operator of the complex and a promotion to captain, which he accepted. He officially transferred to REME on 1 October 1942.

His time at Orkney was (for the most part) boring. After the beginning of the V2 attacks he took part in the efforts to develop a radar capable of tracking their trajectories, but after a few failed attempts at developing such a device the project was called off with the Allied occupation of V2 launching sites.

In March 1945 he was posted to 21 Army Group Headquarters in Brussels, where he was tasked with retrieving a sample of the fungus &quot;Eremothecium ashbyi&quot; from the Dutch National Mycological Collection at Baarn; it had proved useful in synthesising vitamin B, something in demand in post-war Europe. After VE day he was again reposted, this time to join T-force, teams tasked to retrieve technological data from German research facilities as they were discovered. His team proceeded to Pelzerhaken, near Denmark, where many of the scientists uprooted by allied bombings had been based. Here the team found research into infra red detection, radar systems and U-boat signature masking.

==Academic life==
After completion of his reports he was discharged from the army to work for Glaxo in penicillin production, but soon left to become a junior lecturer at King&#x27;s College. A year later, finding it difficult to cope with an underfunded department, he moved to Queen&#x27;s University in Belfast. The department was small, consisting of a professor, a lecturer and a second (part-time) lecturer, and when Heslop-Harrison applied to take a PhD there was nobody qualified to supervise him. He acted as a guide at the 1949 International Phytogeographic Excursion where he met W. H. Pearsall, who before leaving offered him a place as a lecturer at University College London, with the understanding that he would be shortly made a Reader should everything work out.

He moved to UCL in 1950, becoming a Reader in 1953, but returned to Queen&#x27;s in 1954. It was here he began spelling his name as Heslop-Harrison; with a colleague of his called Douglas Harrison letters were regularly delivered to the wrong person. He did not personally get involved in research, but regularly assisted other scientists with various papers and theses. He left Queen&#x27;s again in 1960 to become a professor of botany at the University of Birmingham

At Birmingham the university was in the process of unifying its various biology departments in one School of Biological Sciences, something he oversaw and became Chair of in 1963. In 1967 he was awarded the Trail-Crisp Medal by the Linnean Society of London, and the same year became the first Chairman of the Institute of Plant Development at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. In March 1970 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and delivered the Royal Society&#x27;s Croonian Lecturein 1974. In 1970 he received an honorary degree from Queen&#x27;s, something that was apparently prized more than others due to his history with the institution. He relinquished it in 1995 due to the increasing political instability in Northern Ireland.

==Director at Kew==
In 1970 he was formally offered the position of Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, a much-prized position. He spent about a year as &quot;director-designate&quot; without official duties or pay and spent much of this time researching for his position, meaning that by the time he was officially appointed he had a clear idea of the direction in which he wanted to take the Gardens. In 1974 he delivered the Royal Society&#x27;s Croonian Lecture, and his presentation was well received. He made large changes to the way the institute worked but clashed with the government, who funded the institute, and eventually resigned in 1976, the first Director to do so since the position was created in 1822.

==After Kew==
After leaving Kew, he was offered a position as Royal Society Research Professor at Aberystwyth University, which he accepted, becoming thoroughly engrossed in research; from his departure from Kew onwards he published 106 papers. In 1982 he was awarded the Darwin Medal of the Royal Society jointly with his wife, and the same year was made a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1982 he received an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Bath. In 1985 he retired as Research Professor due to the age requirement, but both he and Yolande were made Honorary Visiting Workers. In 1996 he was awarded the Linnean Medal and the Royal Medal. He died on 8 May 1998.

<text>John William Heslop Harrison, (1881–1967) was a professor of Botany at Kings College, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, specialising in the genetics of moths. He is now best remembered for a widely recognised academic fraud.

==Early life and education==
He was born in Birtley on 22 January 1881, the son of George Heslop-Harrison, a pattern-maker at Birtley Iron Works. He was educated at Bede College School in Durham then Rutherford School for Boys in Newcastle upon Tyne. His mother was a keen gardener, and other influences such as his uncle, Rev J E Hull, and neighbour, Charles Robson, led him to an early interest in botany and natural history.

He then studied at Durham College of Science, where he obtained a BSc degree in 1903. He did further postgraduate study at the University of Newcastle, gaining an MSc degree in 1916 and a DSc in 1917.

In 1921 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (FRSE). His proposers were James Hartley Ashworth, Sir Thomas Hudson Beare, Percy Hall Grimshaw, and James Ritchie. He served as the Society&#x27;s Vice-President 1945–1948. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1928.

He died in Birtley, Tyne and Wear on 23 January 1967.

==Career==

From 1903 to 1905 he was a schoolmaster in Gateshead and then until 1917 in Middlesbrough.

In 1917 he began lecturing in Genetics and Botany at the University of Newcastle being given a professorship in 1927. He remained in this role until retiring in 1946.

===Rùm===

In 1948 he was determined by John Raven, a University of Cambridge classics tutor, to have made false claims to have discovered certain plant species on the island of Rùm on the west coast of Scotland. Whether or not such grasses were on Rùm is pivotal to a theory that the islands escaped the last ice age. The fraud claim is described – and its veracity supported – in Karl Sabbagh&#x27;s 1999 book, &quot;A Rum Affair&quot;. In 2008 further proof about the forgeries committed by Heslop-Harrison emerged.

===Lamarckian experiments===

Heslop Harrison was described as a loner who avoided as much contact as possible with other professionals and conducted most of his experiments at his home in Birtley, Tyne and Wear. He was a supporter of Lamarckian evolution from his experiments with moths and sawflies. According to researcher Michael A. Salmon &quot;Heslop Harrison claimed to have experimental proof that physical changes in the life of an individual moth or sawfly could be passed on to its progeny, according to the theory of Lamarck... For example, Heslop Harrison thought that melanism resulted from the effect of pollution on individual moths which somehow altered their genes. When others attempted to repeat his experiment, however, they always seemed to come up with different results.&quot;

In the 1920s, Heslop Harrison conducted experiments on the peppered moth, claiming to have evidence for the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Other scientists failed to replicate his results. His experiments were criticised by J. B. S. Haldane.

==Family==
In 1906 he married Christian Watson Henderson. Their eldest son was George Heslop-Harrison FRSE who also came to fame as an entomologist.

Heslop Harrison&#x27;s fourth son was Jack Heslop-Harrison who became director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in 1970. His daughter Helena married the botanist William Andrew Clark.

<text>A paper machine (or paper-making machine) is an industrial machine which is used in the pulp and paper industry
to create paper in large quantities at high speed. Modern paper-making machines are based on the principles of the Fourdrinier Machine, which uses a moving woven mesh to create a continuous paper web by filtering out the fibres held in a paper stock and producing a continuously moving wet mat of fibre. This is dried in the machine to produce a strong paper web.

The basic process is an industrialised version of the historical process of hand paper-making, which could not satisfy the demands of developing modern society for large quantities of a printing and writing substrate. The first modern paper machine was invented by Louis-Nicolas Robert in France in 1799, and an improved version patented in Britain by Henry and Sealy Fourdrinier in 1806.

The same process is used to produce paperboard on a paperboard machine.

==Process sections==

Paper machines usually have at least five distinct operational sections:

* Forming section, commonly called the wet end, is a continuous rotating wire mesh which removes water from the paper by sucking it out of suspension via vacuum.
* Press section, where the wet fibre web passes between large rolls loaded under high pressure to squeeze out as much water as possible.
* Drying section, where the pressed sheet passes partly around, in a serpentine manner, a series of steam heated drying cylinders. Drying removes the water content down to a level of about 6%, where it will remain at typical indoor atmospheric conditions. Infra-red driers are also used to supplement cylinder drying where required.
* Size Press section, where the semi-dried paper is applied with a thin layer of starch and/ or other chemicals to improve several paper properties, reduce dusting and air permeability, increase stiffness, bursting strength and short span compression 
* Calender section, where the dried paper is smoothened under high loading and pressure. Only one &quot;nip&quot; (where the sheet is pressed between two rolls) is necessary in order to hold the sheet, which shrinks through the drying section and is held in tension between the press section (or breaker stack if used) and the calender. Extra nips give more smoothing, but at some expense to paper strength. The calendar section can either be a part of the machine (On-line) or in a separate part of the paper mill (Off-line).
* Reel section, where paper coming out of the machine is wound onto individual spools for further processing.
There can also be a coating section to modify the surface characteristics with coatings such as kaolin clay, alternatively known as china clay. This section can be on-line or off-line as well.

== History ==
Before the invention of continuous paper making, paper was made in individual sheets by stirring a container of pulp slurry and either pouring it into a fabric sieve called a sheet mould or dipping and lifting the sheet mould from the vat. While still on the fabric in the sheet mould, the wet paper was pressed to remove excess water. The sheet was then lifted off to be hung over a rope or wooden rod to air dry.

=== Fourdrinier machine ===

In 1799, Louis-Nicolas Robert of Essonnes, France, was granted a patent for a continuous paper making machine. At the time, Robert was working for Saint-Léger Didot, with whom he quarreled over the ownership of the invention. Didot believed that England was a better place to develop the machine but due to the turbulence of the French Revolution, he could not go there himself, so he sent his brother-in-law, John Gamble, an Englishman living in Paris. Through a chain of acquaintances, Gamble was introduced to the brothers Sealy and Henry Fourdrinier, stationers of London, who agreed to finance the project. Gamble was granted British patent 2487 on October 20, 1801. The Fourdrinier machine used a specially woven fabric mesh conveyor belt (known as a &quot;wire,&quot; as it was once woven from bronze) in the forming section, where a slurry of fibre (usually wood or other vegetable fibres) is drained to create a continuous paper web. The original Fourdrinier forming section used a horizontal drainage area, referred to as the &quot;drainage table&quot;.

With the help of Bryan Donkin, a skilled and ingenious mechanic, an improved version of the Robert original was installed at Frogmore Paper Mill, Apsley, Hertfordshire, in 1803, followed by another in 1804. A third machine was installed at the Fourdriniers&#x27; own mill at Two Waters. The Fourdriniers also bought a mill at St Neots intending to install two machines there, and the process and machines continued to develop.

Close to Frogmore Mill in Apsley, John Dickinson designed and built an alternate machine type; a Cylinder Mould Machine in 1809.

Thomas Gilpin is most often credited for creating the first U.S. cylinder type papermaking machine at Brandywine Creek, Delaware in 1817. This machine was a cylinder mould machine. The Fourdrinier machine wasn&#x27;t introduced into the USA until 1827.

=== Similar designs ===
Records show Charles Kinsey of Paterson, NJ had already patented a continuous process papermaking machine in 1807. Kinsey&#x27;s machine was built locally by Daniel Sawn and by 1809 the Kinsey machine was successfully making paper at the Essex Mill in Paterson. Financial stress and potential opportunities created by the Embargo of 1807 eventually persuaded Kinsey and his backers to change the mill&#x27;s focus from paper to cotton and Kinsey&#x27;s early papermaking successes were soon overlooked and forgotten.

Gilpin&#x27;s 1817 patent was similar to Kinsey&#x27;s, as was the John Ames patent of 1822. The Ames patent was challenged by his competitors, asserting that Kinsey was the original inventor and Ames had been stealing other people&#x27;s ideas, their evidence being the employment of Daniel Sawn to work on his machine.

=== Related inventions ===
The method of continuous production demonstrated by the paper machine influenced the development of continuous rolling of iron and later steel and other continuous production processes.

== Pulp types and their preparations ==

The plant fibres used for pulp are composed mostly of cellulose and hemi-cellulose, which have a tendency to form molecular linkages between fibres in the presence of water. After the water evaporates the fibres remain bonded. It is not necessary to add additional binders for most paper grades, although both wet and dry strength additives may be added.

Rags of cotton and linen were the major source of pulp for paper before wood pulp. Today almost all pulp is of wood fibre. Cotton fibre is used in speciality grades, usually in printing paper for such things as resumes and currency.

Sources of rags often appear as waste from other manufacturing such as denim fragments or glove cuts. Fibres from clothing come from the cotton boll. The fibres can range from 3 to 7 cm in length as they exist in the cotton field. Bleach and other chemicals remove the colour from the fabric in a process of cooking, usually with steam. The cloth fragments mechanically abrade into fibres, and the fibres get shortened to a length appropriate for manufacturing paper with a cutting process. Rags and water dump into a trough forming a closed loop. A cylinder with cutting edges, or knives, and a knife bed is part of the loop. The spinning cylinder pushes the contents of the trough around repeatedly. As it lowers slowly over a period of hours, it breaks the rags up into fibres, and cuts the fibres to the desired length. The cutting process terminates when the mix has passed the cylinder enough times at the programmed final clearance of the knives and bed.

Another source of cotton fibre comes from the cotton ginning process. The seeds remain, surrounded by short fibres known as linters for their short length and resemblance to lint. Linters are too short for successful use in fabric. Linters removed from the cotton seeds are available as first and second cuts. The first cuts are longer.

The two major classifications of pulp are chemical and mechanical. Chemical pulps formerly used a sulphite process, but the kraft process is now predominant. Kraft pulp has superior strength to sulphite and mechanical pulps and kraft process spent pulping chemicals are easier to recover and regenerate. Both chemical pulps and mechanical pulps may be bleached to a high brightness.

Chemical pulping dissolves the lignin that bonds fibres to one another, and binds the outer fibrils that compose individual fibres to the fibre core. Lignin, like most other substances that can separate fibres from one another, acts as a debonding agent, lowering strength. Strength also depends on maintaining long cellulose molecule chains. The kraft process, due to the alkali and sulphur compounds used, tends to minimize attack on the cellulose and the non-crystalline hemicellulose, which promotes bonding, while dissolving the lignin. Acidic pulping processes shorten the cellulose chains.

Kraft pulp makes superior linerboard and excellent printing and writing papers.

Groundwood, the main ingredient used in newsprint and a principal component of magazine papers (coated publications), is literally ground wood produced by a grinder. Therefore, it contains a lot of lignin, which lowers its strength. The grinding produces very short fibres that drain slowly.

Thermomechanical pulp (TMP) is a variation of groundwood where fibres are separated mechanically while at high enough temperatures to soften the lignin.

Between chemical and mechanical pulps there are semi-chemical pulps that use a mild chemical treatment followed by refining. Semi-chemical pulp is often used for corrugating medium.

Bales of recycled paper (normally old corrugated containers) for unbleached (brown) packaging grades may be simply pulped, screened and cleaned. Recycling to make white papers is usually done in a deinking plant, which employs screening, cleaning, washing, bleaching and flotation. Deinked pulp is used in printing and writing papers and in tissue, napkins and paper towels. It is often blended with virgin pulp.

At integrated pulp and paper mills, pulp is usually stored in high density towers before being pumped to stock preparation. Non integrated mills use either dry pulp or wet lap (pressed) pulp, usually received in bales. The pulp bales are slushed in a [re]pulper.

== Stock (pulp) preparation ==

Stock preparation is the area where pulp is usually refined, blended to the appropriate proportion of hardwood, softwood or recycled fibre, and diluted to as uniform and constant as possible consistency. The pH is controlled and various fillers, such as whitening agents, size and wet strength or dry strength are added if necessary. Additional fillers such as clay, calcium carbonate and titanium dioxide increase opacity so printing on reverse side of a sheet will not distract from content on the obverse side of the sheet. Fillers also improve printing quality.

Pulp is pumped through a sequence of tanks that are commonly called &quot;chests&quot;, which may be either round or more commonly rectangular. Historically these were made of special ceramic tile faced reinforced concrete, but mild and stainless steels are also used. Because fibre and fillers are denser than water and tend to settle out quickly and also fibres are attracted together to form clumps called floc, low consistency pulp slurries are kept agitated in these chests by propeller like agitators near the pump suction at the chest bottom.

In the following process, different types of pulp, if used, are normally treated in separate but similar process lines until combined at a blend chest:

From high density storage or from slusher/pulper the pulp is pumped to a low density storage chest (tank). From there it is typically diluted to about 4% consistency before being pumped to an unrefined stock chest. From the unrefined stock chest stock is again pumped, with consistency control, through a refiner. Refining is an operation whereby the pulp slurry passes between a pair of discs, one of which is stationary and the other rotating at speeds of typically 1,000 or 1,200 RPM for 50 and 60 Hz AC, respectively. The discs have raised bars on their faces and pass each other with narrow clearance. This action unravels the outer layer of the fibres, causing the fibrils of the fibres to partially detach and bloom outward, increasing the surface area to promoting bonding. Refining thus increases tensile strength. For example, tissue paper is relatively unrefined whereas packaging paper is more highly refined. Refined stock from the refiner then goes to a refined stock chest, or blend chest, if used as such.

Hardwood fibres are typically 1 mm long and smaller in diameter than the 4 mm length typical of softwood fibres. Refining can cause the softwood fibre tube to collapse resulting in undesirable properties in the sheet.

From the refined stock, or blend chest, stock is again consistency controlled as it is being pumped to a machine chest. It may be refined or additives may be added en route to the machine chest.

The machine chest is basically a consistency levelling chest having about 15 minutes retention. This is enough retention time to allow any variations in consistency entering the chest to be levelled out by the action of the basis weight valve receiving feedback from the on line basis weight measuring scanner. (Note: Many paper machines mistakenly control consistency coming out of the machine chest, interfering with basis weight control.)

== Operation ==
There are four main sections on this paper machine. The forming section makes the pulp into the basis for sheets along the wire. The press section, which removes much of the remaining water via a system of nips formed by rolls pressing against each other aided by press felts that support the sheet and absorb the pressed water. The dryer section of the paper machine, as its name suggests, dries the paper by way of a series of internally steam-heated cylinders that evaporate the moisture. Calenders are used to make the paper surface extra smooth and glossy. In practice calender rolls are normally placed vertically in a &quot;stack&quot;.


=== Forming section or wet end ===
From the machine chest stock is pumped to a head tank, commonly called a &quot;head tank&quot; or &quot;stuff box&quot;, whose purpose is to maintain a constant head (pressure) on the fiber slurry or &quot;stock&quot; as it feeds the basis weight valve. The stuff box also provides a means allowing air bubbles to escape. The consistency of the pulp slurry at the stuff box is in the 3% range. Flow from the stuff box is by gravity and is controlled by the basis weight valve on its way to the fan pump suction where it is injected into the main flow of water to the fan pump. The main flow of water pumped by the fan pump is from a whitewater chest or tank that collects all the water drained from the forming section of the paper machine. Before the fiber stream from the stuff box is introduced, the whitewater is very low in fiber content. The whitewater is constantly recirculated by the fan pump through the headbox and recollected from the wire pit and various other tanks and chests that receive drainage from the forming wire and vacuum assisted drainage from suction boxes and wet fiber web handling rolls. On the way to the head box the pulp slurry may pass through centrifugal cleaners, which remove heavy contaminants like sand, and screens, which break up fibre clumps and remove oversized debris. The fan pump ultimately feeds the headbox, whether or not any centrifugal cleaners or screens are present.

The purpose of the headbox is to create turbulence in order to keep the fibers from clumping together and to uniformly distribute the slurry across the width of the wire. Wood fibers have a tendency to attract one another, forming clumps, the effect being called flocculation. Flocculation is lessened by lowering consistency and or by agitating the slurry; however, de-flocculation becomes very difficult at much above 0.5% consistency. Minimizing the degree of flocculation when forming is important to physical properties of paper.

The consistency in the headbox is typically under 0.4% for most paper grades, with longer fibres requiring lower consistency than short fibres. Higher consistency causes more fibres to be oriented in the z direction, while lower consistency promotes fibre orientation in the x-y direction. Higher consistency promotes higher calliper (thickness) and stiffness, lower consistency promotes higher tensile and some other strength properties and also improves formation (uniformity). Many sheet properties continue to improve down to below 0.1% consistency; however, this is an impractical amount of water to handle. (Most paper machine run a higher headbox consistency than optimum because they have been sped up over time without replacing the fan pump and headbox. There is also an economic trade off with high pumping costs for lower consistency).

The stock slurry, often called &quot;white water&quot; at this point, exits the head box through a rectangular opening of adjustable height called the &quot;slice&quot;, the white water stream being called the &quot;jet&quot; and it is pressurized on high speed machines so as to land gently on the moving fabric loop or &quot;wire&quot; at a speed typically between plus or minus 3% of the wire speed, called &quot;rush&quot; and &quot;drag&quot; respectively. Excessive &quot;rush&quot; or &quot;drag&quot; causes more orientation of fibres in the machine direction and gives differing physical properties in machine and cross directions; however, this phenomenon is not completely avoidable on Fourdrinier machines.

On lower speed machines at 700 feet per minute, gravity and the height of the stock in the headbox creates sufficient pressure to form the jet through the opening of the slice. The height of the stock is the head, which gives the headbox its name. The speed of the jet compared to the speed of the wire is known as the &quot;jet-to-wire ratio&quot;. When the jet-to-wire ratio is less than unity, the fibres in the stock become drawn out in the machine direction. On slower machines where sufficient liquid remains in the stock before draining out, the wire can be driven back and forth with a process known as &quot;shake&quot;. This provides some measure of randomizing the direction of the fibres and gives the sheet more uniform strength in both the machine and cross-machine directions. On fast machines, the stock does not remain on the wire in liquid form long enough and the long fibres line up with the machine. When the jet-to-wire ratio exceeds unity, the fibers tend to pile up in lumps. The resulting variation in paper density provides the antique or parchment paper look.

Two large rolls typically form the ends of the drainage section, which is called the &quot;drainage table&quot;. The &quot;breast roll&quot; is located under the flow box, the jet being aimed to land on it at about the top centre. At the other end of the drainage table is the suction (&quot;couch&quot;) roll. The couch roll is a hollow shell, drilled with many thousands of precisely spaced holes of about 4 to 5 mm diameter. The hollow shell roll rotates over a stationary suction box, normally placed at the top centre or rotated just down machine. Vacuum is pulled on the suction box, which draws water from the web into the suction box. From the suction roll the sheet feeds into the press section.

Down machine from the suction roll, and at a lower elevation, is the &quot;wire turning roll&quot;. This roll is driven and pulls the wire around the loop. The wire turning roll has a considerable angle of wrap in order to grip the wire.

Supporting the wire in the drainage table area are a number of drainage elements. In addition to supporting the wire and promoting drainage, the elements de-flocculate the sheet. On low speed machines these table elements are primarily &quot;table rolls&quot;. As speed increases the suction developed in the nip of a table roll increases and at high enough speed the wire snaps back after leaving the vacuum area and causes stock to jump off the wire, disrupting the formation. To prevent this drainage foils are used. The foils are typically sloped between zero and two or three degrees and give a more gentle action. Where rolls and foils are used, rolls are used near the headbox and foils further down machine. Ultrasonic foils can also be used, creating millions of pressure pulses from imploding cavitation bubbles which keep the fibres apart, giving them a more uniform distribution.

Approaching the dry line on the table are located low vacuum boxes that are drained by a barometric leg under gravity pressure. After the dry line are the suction boxes with applied vacuum. Suction boxes extend up to the couch roll. At the couch the sheet consistency should be about 25%.

=== Variations of the Fourdrinier forming section ===
The forming section type is usually based on the grade of paper or paperboard being produced; however, many older machines use a less than optimum design. Older machines can be upgraded to include more appropriate forming sections.

A second headbox may be added to a conventional fourdrinier to put a different fibre blend on top of a base layer. A &quot;secondary headbox&quot; is normally located at a point where the base sheet is completely drained. This is not considered a separate ply because the water action does a good job of intermixing the fibers of the top and bottom layer. Secondary headboxes are common on linerboard.

A modification to the basic Fourdrinier table by adding a second wire on top of the drainage table is known as a top wire former. The bottom and top wires converge and some drainage is up through the top wire. A top wire improves formation and also gives more drainage, which is useful for machines that have been sped up.

The Twin Wire Machine or Gap former uses two vertical wires in the forming section, thereby increasing the de-watering rate of the fibre slurry while also giving uniform two sidedness.

There are also machines with entire Fourdrinier sections mounted above a traditional Fourdrinier. This allows making multi-layer paper with special characteristics. These are called top Fourdriniers and they make multi-ply paper or paperboard. Commonly this is used for making a top layer of bleached fibre to go over an unbleached layer.

Another type forming section is the cylinder mould machine invented by John Dickinson in 1809, originally as a competitor to the Fourdrinier machine. This machine uses a mesh-covered rotating cylinder partially immersed in a tank of fibre slurry in the wet end to form a paper web, giving a more random distribution of the cellulose fibres. Cylinder machines can form a sheet at higher consistency, which gives a more three dimensional fibre orientation than lower consistencies, resulting in higher caliper (thickness) and more stiffness in the machine direction (MD). High MD stiffness is useful in food packaging like cereal boxes and other boxes like dry laundry detergent.

Tissue machines typically form the paper web between a wire and a special fabric (felt) as they wrap around a forming roll. The web is pressed from the felt directly onto a large diameter dryer called a &quot;yankee&quot;. The paper sticks to the yankee dryer and is peeled off with a scraping blade called a &quot;doctor&quot;. Tissue machines operate at speeds of up to 2000 m/min.

=== Press section ===

The second section of the paper machine is the press section, which removes much of the remaining water via a system of nips formed by rolls pressing against each other aided by press felts that support the sheet and absorb the pressed water. The paper web consistency leaving the press section can be above 40%. Pressing is the second most efficient method of de-watering the sheet (behind free drainage in the forming section) as only mechanical action is required.

The number of press rolls, their arrangement and the arrangement and type of felts used are influenced by the grades of paper being produced and the desired operational characteristics of the machine.

Press felts historically were made from wool. However, today they are nearly 100% synthetic. They are made up of a polyamide woven fabric with thick batt applied in a specific design to maximise water absorption.

Presses can be single or double felted. A single felted press has a felt on one side and a smooth roll on the other. A double felted press has both sides of the sheet in contact with a press felt. Single felted nips are useful when mated against a smooth roll (usually in the top position), which adds a two-sidedness—making the top side appear smoother than the bottom. Double felted nips impart roughness on both sides of the sheet. Double felted presses are desirable for the first press section of heavy paperboard.

Simple press rolls can be rolls with grooved or blind drilled surface. More advanced press rolls are suction rolls. These are rolls with perforated shell and cover. The shell made of metal material such as bronze or stainless steel is covered with rubber or a synthetic material. Both shell and cover are drilled throughout the surface. A stationary suction box is fitted in the core of the suction roll to support the shell being pressed. End face mechanical seals are used for the interface between the inside surface of the shell and the suction box. For the smooth rolls, they are typically made of granite rolls. The granite rolls can be up to long and in diameter.

Conventional roll presses are configured with one of the press rolls is in a fixed position, with a mating roll being loaded against this fixed roll. The felts run through the nips of the press rolls and continues around a felt run, normally consisting of several felt rolls. During the dwell time in the nip, the moisture from the sheet is transferred to the press felt. When the press felt exits the nip and continues around, a vacuum box known as an Uhle Box applies vacuum (normally -60 kPa) to the press felt to remove the moisture so that when the felt returns to the nip on the next cycle, it does not add moisture to the sheet.

Some grades of paper use suction pick up rolls that use vacuum to transfer the sheet from the couch to a lead in felt on the first press or between press sections. Pickup roll presses normally have a vacuum box that has two vacuum zones (low vacuum and high vacuum). These rolls have a large number of drilled holes in the cover to allow the vacuum to pass from the stationary vacuum box through the rotating roll covering. The low vacuum zone picks up the sheet and transfers, while the high vacuum zone attempts to remove moisture. Unfortunately, at high enough speed centrifugal force flings out vacuumed water, making this less effective for dewatering. Pickup presses also have standard felt runs with Uhle boxes. However, pickup press design is quite different, as air movement is important for the pickup and dewatering facets of its role.

Crown Controlled Rolls (also known as CC Rolls) are usually the mating roll in a press arrangement. They have hydraulic cylinders in the press rolls that ensure that the roll does not bow. The cylinders connect to a shoe or multiple shoes to keep the crown on the roll flat, to counteract the natural &quot;bend&quot; in the roll shape due to applying load to the edges.

Extended Nip Presses (or ENP) are a relatively modern alternative to conventional roll presses. The top roll is usually a standard roll, while the bottom roll is actually a large CC roll with an extended shoe curved to the shape of the top roll, surrounded by a rotating rubber belt rather than a standard roll cover. The goal of the ENP is to extend the dwell time of the sheet between the two rolls thereby maximising the de-watering. Compared to a standard roll press that achieves up to 35% solids after pressing, an ENP brings this up to 45% and higher—delivering significant steam savings or speed increases. ENPs densify the sheet, thus increasing tensile strength and some other physical properties.

=== Dryer section ===
The dryer section of the paper machine, as its name suggests, dries the paper by way of a series of internally steam-heated cylinders that evaporate the moisture. Steam pressures may range up to 160 psig. Steam enters the end of the dryer head (cylinder cap) through a steam joint and condensate exits through a siphon that goes from the internal shell to a centre pipe. From the centre pipe the condensate exits through a joint on the dryer head. Wide machines require multiple siphons. In faster machines, centrifugal force holds the condensate layer still against the shell and turbulence generating bars are typically used to agitate the condensate layer and improve heat transfer.

The sheet is usually held against the dryers by long felt loops on the top and bottom of each dryer section. The felts greatly improve heat transfer. Dryer felts are made of coarse thread and have a very open weave that is almost see through, It is common to have the first bottom dryer section unfelted to dump broke on the basement floor during sheet breaks or when threading the sheet.

Paper dryers are typically arranged in groups called &quot;sections&quot; so that they can be run at a progressively slightly slower speed to compensate for sheet shrinkage as the paper dries. Some grades of paper may also stretch as they run through the machine, requiring increasing speed between sections. The gaps between sections are called &quot;draws&quot;.

The drying sections are usually enclosed to conserve heat. Heated air is usually supplied to the pockets where the sheet breaks contact with the driers. This increases the rate of drying. The pocket ventilating tubes have slots along their entire length that face into the pocket. The dryer hoods are usually exhausted with a series of roof mounted hood exhausts fans down the dryer section.

=== Size Press ===
Additional sizing agents, including resins, glue, or starch, can be added to the web to alter its characteristics. Sizing improves the paper&#x27;s water resistance, decreases its ability to fuzz, reduces abrasiveness, and improves its printing properties and surface bond strength. These may be applied at the wet (internal sizing) or on the dry end (surface sizing), or both. At the dry end sizing is usually applied with a &quot;size press&quot;. The size press may be a roll applicator (flooded nip) or Nozzle applicator . It is usually placed before the last dryer section. Some paper machines also make use of a &#x27;coater&#x27; to apply a coating of fillers such as calcium carbonate or china clay usually suspended in a binder of cooked starch and styrene-butadiene latex. Coating produces a very smooth, bright surface with the highest printing qualities.

=== Calender section ===
A calender consists of two or more rolls, where pressure is applied to the passing paper. Calenders are used to make the paper surface extra smooth and glossy. It also gives it a more uniform thickness. The pressure applied to the web by the rollers determines the finish of the paper.

=== Reel section ===

After calendering, the web has a moisture content of about 6% (depending on the furnish). The paper is wound onto metal spools using a large cylinder called a &quot;reel drum&quot;. Constant nip pressure is maintained between the reel drum and the spool, allowing the resulting friction to spin the spool. Paper runs over the top of the reel drum and is wound onto the spool to create a &quot;master roll&quot;.

To be able to keep the paper machine running continuously, the reel must be able to quickly switch from winding a finished roll to an empty spool without stopping the flow of paper. To accomplish this, each reel section will have two or more spools rotating through the process. Using an overhead crane, empty spools will be loaded onto two &quot;primary arms&quot; above the reel drum. When the master roll reaches its maximum diameter, the arms will lower the new spool into contact with the reel drum and a machine behind the drum will run a tape along the moving sheet of paper, swiftly tearing it and attaching incoming paper onto the new spool. The spool is then lowered onto the &quot;secondary arms&quot;, which steadily guide the spool away from the reel drum as the diameter of paper on the spool increases.
The roll hardness should be checked, obtained and adjusted accordingly to insure that the roll hardness is within the acceptable range for the product.

===Winder section===
Reels of paper wound up at the end of the drying process are the full trimmed width, minus shrinkage from drying, of the web leaving the wire. In the winder section reels of paper are slit into smaller rolls of a width and roll diameter range specified by a customer order. To accomplish this the reel is placed on an unwind stand and the distances between the slitters (sharp cutting wheels), are adjusted to the specified widths for the orders. The winder is run until the desired roll diameter is reached and the rolls are labeled according to size and order before being sent to shipping or the warehouse. A reel usually has sufficient diameter to make two or more sets of rolls.

== Glossary ==
broke: waste paper made during the paper making process, either made during a sheet break or trimmings. It is gathered up and put in a repulper for recycling back into the process.

consistency: the percent dry fiber in a pulp slurry.

couch: French meaning &quot;to lie down&quot;. Following the couch roll the sheet is lifted off the wire and transferred into the press section.

dandy roll: a mesh covered hollow roll that rides on top of the Fourdrinier. It breaks up fiber clumps to improve the sheet formation and can also be used to make an imprint, as with laid paper. See also watermark.

fan pump: the large pump that circulates white water from the white water chest to the headbox. The pump is a special low pulse design that minimizes the effect of vane pulses which would cause uneven basis weight of paper in the machine direction known as &quot;barring&quot;. The flow from the fan pump may go through screens and cleaners, if used. On large paper machines fan pumps may be rated in tens of thousands of gallons per minute.

felt: a loop of fabric or synthetic material that goes between press rolls and serves as a place to receive the pressed out water. Felts also support the wet paper web and guide it through the press section. Felts are also used in the dryer section to keep the sheet in close contact with the dryers and increase heat transfer.

filler: a finely divided substance added to paper in the forming process. Fillers improve print quality, brightness and opacity. The most common fillers are clay and calcium carbonate. Titanium dioxide is a filler but also improves brightness and opacity. Use of calcium carbonate filler is the commonly used in alkaline papermaking, while kaolin clay is prevalent in acidic papermaking. Alkaline paper has superior ageing properties.

formation: the degree of uniformity of fiber distribution in finished paper, which is easily seen by holding paper up to the light.

headbox: the pressure chamber where turbulence is applied to break up fiber clumps in the slurry. The main job of the headbox is to distribute the fiber slurry uniformly across the wire.

nip: the contact area where two opposing rolls meet, such as in a press or calender.

pH: the degree of acidity or alkalinity of a solution. Alkaline paper has a very long life. Acid paper deteriorates over time, which caused libraries to either take conservation measures or replace many older books.

size: a chemical or starch, applied to paper to retard the rate of water penetration. Sizing prevents &quot;bleeding&quot; of ink during printing, improving the sharpness of printing.

slice: the adjustable rectangular orifice, usually at the bottom of the headbox, through which the whitewater jet discharges onto the wire. The slice opening and water pressure together determine the amount and velocity of whitewater flow through the slice. The slice usually has some form of adjustment mechanism to even out the paper weight profile across the machine (CD profile), although a newer method is to inject water into the whitewater across the headbox slice area, thereby using localized consistency to control CD weight profile.

stock: a pulp slurry that has been processed in the stock preparation area with necessary additives, refining and pH adjustment and ready for making paper

web: the continuous flow of un-dried fiber from the couch roll down the paper machine

white water: filtrate from the drainage table. The white water from the table is usually stored in a white water chest from which it is pumped by the fan pump to the headbox.

wire: the woven mesh fabric loop that is used for draining the pulp slurry from the headbox. Until the 1970s bronze wires were used but now they are woven from coarse mono-filament synthetics similar to fishing line but very stiff.

== Materials ==

Stainless steels are used extensively in the Pulp and Paper industry for two primary reasons, to avoid iron contamination of the product and their corrosion resistance to the various chemicals used in the paper making process. Type 316 stainless steel is a common material used in paper machines.
