<text>The Lake Shore Limited is an overnight passenger train operated by Amtrak between Chicago and the Northeastern United States, with sections to New York City and Boston. The central segment of the route runs along the southern shore of Lake Erie. East of Chicago, the &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot; follows the former main line of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway to South Bend, Toledo, Cleveland, and Buffalo. From here the train takes the Empire Corridor through Rochester and Syracuse to Albany–Rensselaer station in Rensselaer, New York. At that station, the train divides, with one section continuing to Springfield and Boston in Massachusetts, while the other continues along the Empire Corridor to New York City. The train is scheduled for – hours for the between Chicago and New York, and –22 hours for the between Chicago and Boston.

The train is descended from the New York Central Railroad&#x27;s train of the same name, which operated on nearly the same Chicago–New York/Boston route from 1897 to 1956. Amtrak briefly revived the train as the Chicago–New York Lake Shore in 1971–72. The &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot; was introduced as a Chicago–New York/Boston train in 1975. During fiscal year 2023, &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot; carried 351,049 passengers.

== History ==
===Prior service===

The &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot; is named after one of its predecessors that ran on the famed Water Level Route of the New York Central Railroad (NYC). Like the present day &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot;, the NYC edition offered service between New York and Boston and Chicago, although the New York Central used LaSalle Street Station. The New York Central annulled the &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot; in 1956 as part of a system-wide reorganization. Service over the Water Level Route continued until the formation of Amtrak, with the last route being the &quot;New England States&quot; and an unnamed Penn Central successor.

===&quot;Lake Shore&quot;===
Amtrak assumed operation of most intercity passenger trains in the United States on May 1, 1971, including those of Penn Central. Service west of Buffalo was not included in Amtrak&#x27;s initial system map. Instead, Chicago–New York traffic was handled by the &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; using the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s main line via Pittsburgh, while Albany–Boston did not have any train service.

Just nine days later, on May 10, 1971, Amtrak debuted the Chicago–New York &quot;Lake Shore&quot; on the former route of the New York Central&#x27;s &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot;. The daily service was scheduled for 17 hours 30 minutes and carried train numbers 60 and 61. The &quot;Lake Shore&quot; was the only train to serve Cleveland, Ohio, which had been the largest city left out of the initial system. Amtrak introduced the route on the understanding that Ohio and New York would assume two-thirds of the cost of the train. The plan included a Michigan-funded connection between Toledo and Detroit, but this was cancelled due to poor track conditions.

The &quot;Lake Shore&quot; was the last long-haul train to use Cleveland&#x27;s Union Terminal, with the last departure occurring on December 31, 1971. For the last week of the &quot;Lake Shore&quot;&#x27;s runs Amtrak used a temporary platform near the Detroit–Superior Bridge, west of the terminal, to avoid incurring a year&#x27;s fees ($250,000) for a week&#x27;s use. Amtrak discontinued the train on January 6, 1972, after New York failed to meet its funding obligations.

===&quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot;===
The present-day &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot; began running October 31, 1975, with both New York and Boston sections. The initial timetable served Cleveland during daytime hours, westbound travelers arrived at 7:30 AM and departed for New York City at 11:20 pm. Amtrak&#x27;s October 1981 timetable pushed the westbound Cleveland departure to 12:35 AM.

On October 15, 1979, the &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot; became the first Amtrak service to use rebuilt Heritage Fleet equipment with head end power. The &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot; was the last train to use the decaying Buffalo Central Terminal, departing on October 28, 1979. Since then it has used . Its New York terminus changed from Grand Central Terminal to Pennsylvania Station in 1991 following the opening of the Empire Connection.

On the night of August 3, 1994, around 3:45 am, the westbound &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot;, with two locomotives and fifteen cars, and carrying roughly 320 passengers, and nineteen crew members, derailed on Conrail-owned tracks (now owned by CSX) near Batavia, New York. The initial derailment of the wheels of the third car on the train, occurred at milepost 403.7, and the train traveled for another three miles, until the general derailment of the train, at milepost 406.7. In all, fourteen cars derailed, with some sliding down an embankment, and 118 passengers and crew members were injured. However, there were no fatalities. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause were the wheels coming off a section of flattened rail.

Low demand and cost-cutting led Amtrak to drop through service to Boston between 2003 and 2008; passengers made a cross-platform transfer to a shuttle train. Service to Poughkeepsie began on November 8, 2010. In 2010–11, Amtrak studied restoring the Hammond–Whiting station stop just east of the Illinois-Indiana border (which had been dropped in 2003), but ultimately did not restore it due to the difficulty of routing trains to the station&#x27;s single platform.

Due to planned repair work on the Freedom Tunnel, Spuyten Duyvil Bridge, and Track 19 in New York&#x27;s Penn Station, the New York section was discontinued from May 26 to September 3, 2018. Passengers traveling to New York City could transfer at Albany–Rensselaer to &quot;Empire Service&quot; trains, which operated into Grand Central Terminal during the outage.

In January 2019, Amtrak removed the baggage car from the Boston section of the train, thereby eliminating all checked baggage and bike service between Boston and Albany. The New York section retained its baggage car. From October 1, 2020, to May 31, 2021, daily service was reduced to three trains per week due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

====Dining changes====

During the 2000s and 2010s the &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot; carried either a Horizon Fleet or Amfleet lounge car. Between November 2007 and December 2009, maintenance problems led Amtrak to withdraw the Heritage diners and substitute Amfleet Cafe-based diner-lites, a move that became a source of passenger displeasure and a liability for the route, as the Heritage cars could prepare fresh food on board. In July 2016, Amtrak once again replaced the Lake Shore&#x27;s full-service dining car with an Amfleet II diner-lite. This was due to Heritage shortages, as well as a multi-year delay in delivery of the new CAF Viewliner II cars, including 25 diners.

In June 2018, Amtrak replaced the Amfleet II diner-lites with Viewliner II diners and adjusted the on board service by serving a selection of primarily-cold, exclusively pre-packaged boxed meals. The dining car is also now available as lounge space for sleeping car passengers even outside of meal times, but is closed to coach passengers. In January 2019, Amtrak significantly updated the boxed meal service to offer a full continental buffet at breakfast, and multiple hot entrées for lunch and dinner.

In October 2019, Amtrak again modified the on board dining service for sleeping car passengers by serving the pre-prepared meals on new reusable trays instead of in single use boxes to improve the meal presentation along with a refresh of the entree choices.

=== Possible future ===
Amtrak published its Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) for the &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot; in September 2011. One idea was to change the train&#x27;s eastbound departure time from Chicago to be earlier. It currently departs at 9:30 pm, to facilitate connections from often-late West Coast trains. The improved departure time would add $2 million in yearly revenue. Amtrak considered more radical changes to the operations of the &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot;, including a re-route over the Chicago–Detroit Line to Dearborn, but rejected them. This would be the first full New York City to Chicago train via Michigan since the New York Central&#x27;s &quot;Wolverine.&quot;

In the late 1990s, Amtrak considered adding an infill station at Dunkirk, New York, between Buffalo and Erie. Dunkirk was listed as a stop with service &quot;to commence on a date to be announced&quot; on several timetables, but the stop was never added. In 2021, Amtrak again proposed adding a station between Buffalo and Erie in Chautauqua County, New York, in either Dunkirk or Westfield. Plans moved forward in 2022 to study the exact placement of the stop.

== Operations ==
===Route===
The &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot; consists of a New York section (train number 48 eastbound, 49 westbound) and a Boston section (448 eastbound, 449 westbound), which run combined between Chicago and Albany. The distance between Chicago and New York is , while the distance between Chicago and Boston is .

The train operates over the trackage of five railroad companies. From Chicago to Cleveland, the train rides the Chicago Line, which belongs to Norfolk Southern Railway, and is also used by Amtrak&#x27;s Chicago-Miami, train, the . From Cleveland to Hoffmans, the &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot; rides on trackage belonging to the following CSX Transportation subdivisions: Cleveland Terminal, Erie West, Buffalo Terminal, Rochester, Syracuse Terminal, Mohawk, Selkirk, and Hudson.

The New York section operates on Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Hudson Line from to Spuyten Duyvil in the Bronx. Amtrak tracks are used twice: between Hoffmans and Poughkeepsie; and from the Bronx to Penn Station. The New York section only stops to discharge passengers southbound. Northbound trains only stop at Croton-Harmon and Poughkeepsie to receive passengers.

The Boston section runs on the trackage of several companies as well. The train travels on Amtrak&#x27;s Post Road Branch from Rensselaer to nearby Schodack, from Schodack to Worcester on CSX&#x27;s Berkshire and Boston subdivisions, and from Worcester to South Station on the Framingham/Worcester Line track owned and operated by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA). This section only stops eastbound to discharge passengers from Worcester eastward, while westbound trains only stop to receive passengers at Back Bay and Framingham.

There is a short distance of trackage between Hudson and Schenectady that allows for operations. The Boston section is frequently delayed to the high amount of freight traffic on the single-track railroad between Albany and Worcester.
=== Stations ===
=== Consist ===

As of February 2019, the &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot; typically has two P42DC locomotives (or one P32AC-DM locomotive between New York and Albany), one Viewliner baggage car, three Amfleet II coaches, one Amfleet I split Business/Cafe car, one Viewliner II diner (exclusively accessible to sleeper passengers), and three Viewliner Sleepers. , Viewliner II sleepers were expected to be added to the &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot; that September.

In normal service, at Albany, the train splits into its Boston and New York sections. The New York section uses a single dual-mode P32AC-DM for third-rail power in Pennsylvania Station. West of Albany, power is provided by two or three GE Genesis P42DC or P40DC diesel locomotives, which continue on to Boston.

===Ridership===
During fiscal year 2019, the &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot; carried 357,682 passengers, an increase of 5.9% from FY2018. In FY2016, the train had a total revenue of $28,563,624, an increase of 0.2% over FY2015.

In FY 2010, only fifteen percent of passengers traveled between endpoints (Chicago and Boston or New York), although those travelers contributed 27 percent of ticket revenue. The remainder traveled to and from intermediate stations. According to Amtrak, passengers making connections in Chicago accounted for &quot;a significant portion&quot; of the &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot;&#x27;s ridership and revenues.

<doc id="498227" wikidata="Q4998091" url="?curid=498227" title="Burak Eldem">
<text>Burak Eldem (born 1961) is a Turkish writer/researcher, a former radio and TV programmer, web developer and journalist. He is the author of &quot;2012: Rendez-vous With Marduk&quot; (also known as &quot;2012: Appointment With Marduk&quot; - 2003), &quot;Fraternis: Lost Books, Secret Brotherhood&quot; (2006) and &quot;Talismans Protect Thee&quot; (2004). The first two titles belong to a trilogy about the history of civilization, which he named &quot;The Hidden History&quot;. The latter is a science-fiction novel on immortality, ancient secrets and international conspiracies. His latest work &quot;Sunset Fandango&quot;, sequel to &quot;Talismans&quot;, was published in November 2007.

==Early life and journalism==
Eldem spent his early childhood in Ankara, the capital of Turkey. His father, Atilla Eldem, was a well-known actor of the Ankara State Theatre and his mother was a high school literature teacher. He is also a great-grandson of İbrahim Edhem Pasha, Grand Vizier (Sadrazam) of Ottoman Sultan Abdulhamid II. Eldem moved to Istanbul in 1975 when his father died and continued his high school education in this city. Graduated from Boğaziçi University&#x27;s Tourism Management department and then Marmara University&#x27;s Business Administration Faculty, but never intended to be a business executive; his main interests were writing and history.

His journalism career began in 1984, writing feature articles for Turkish arts and culture magazines; among them were &quot;Gösteri&quot;, &quot;Sanat Olayı&quot; and &quot;Milliyet Sanat&quot;, the most popular publications of the early eighties. His writings mostly concentrated on post-World War II counter-culture movements in Western World, particularly the avant-garde literature of the fifties and particularly in rock music. His colorful analysis on the Beat Generation literature and the Flower Power movement of the sixties, were welcomed by young urban intellectuals. In 1985, his first book was published by Imge Publications, titled &quot;Bob Marley and Reggae&quot;; a biography of Jamaican reggae star and a summary of the Rastafarian movement, slightly emphasising its politics, its elements of anti-imperialism. The same year he published &quot;The History of Rock Music&quot;; a research on the roots of jazz, blues and rock music, as a sociological and political phenomenon of the twentieth century capitalist world.

Eldem was among the founders of the monthly music and counter-culture magazine &quot;Studyo Imge&quot; (now considered as a cult) and became its first editor in early 1985. In 1986, his third book came: &quot;From May Flower to the Song of Peace&quot;; a work on American protest folk music of sixties, centered around the singer Joan Baez. The same year he began to write for the daily newspaper Cumhuriyet (The Republic) and became its one of the most popular freelance writers. In early 1988, he was hired for Playboy magazine&#x27;s Turkish edition as the editorial director and ran that position until 1990. Between 1991 and 1996, he prepared and presented documentary music programs for Turkish television (TRT).

In 1997, he shifted his career towards &quot;new media&quot; working as a contributing editor and a columnist at ZDNet&#x27;s Turkish edition; then in 2000, he became the portal manager of the leading internet content provider and ISP &quot;Ixir&quot;. He also ran a personal web site named &quot;Atlantis&quot;, where he shared his research on humanities and particularly on ancient history.

==Researcher and novelist==

Eldem has published dozens of articles and essays on archaeo-astronomy, along with unorthodox interpretations of sacred texts and papyri. His writings on ancient Mesopotamian cosmology and Mayan astronomy eventually became the basis and nucleus of a trilogy, named &quot;The Hidden History&quot;. The first volume was published in 2003: the best-selling &quot;2012: Rendez-vous With Marduk&quot;.

Examining, adapting and developing the work of Zecharia Sitchin, the book refers to the hypothetical Planet X, and suggests an orbital period of 3661 solar years with a return date in 2012. Eldem also suggests that the number 3661 was written as &quot;three wedges&quot; with cuneiform in Mesopotamian sexagesimal mathematics: One wedge each for 3600&#x27;s, 60&#x27;s and units digits. This cuneiform sign, claims Eldem, was misinterpreted by Jewish exiles in Babylon and the enigmatic 666 was created: the Number of the Beast was actually the number of solar years in Marduk&#x27;s orbital period.

The book became a best-seller in Turkey in 2004 and Eldem was criticized by religious writers for being an atheist, denying the Old Testament prophets such as Moses, promoting the theory of evolution, accusing Moses and Aaron of inventing the concept of God in order to reassure themselves following natural disasters such as floods.

On the other hand, his works had very positive critics from some of the outstanding writers and journalists of the Turkish Press, like Engin Ardıç and Serdar Turgut, the editor-in-chief of daily newspaper &quot;Akşam&quot; (The Evening). Ardıç, a very popular writer, columnist and former TV commentator, also contributed to &quot;2012: Rendez-vous With Marduk&quot; by writing its foreword.

The same year came his first novel, &quot;Seni Tılsımlar Korur&quot; &quot;Talismans Protect Thee&quot;; a semi-fantastic fiction on immortality, a five thousand years old dark secret which had been hidden from humanity, a dark international conspiracy and a top secret research on human DNA. &quot;Talismans&quot; became one of the best-selling novels of 2005 in Turkey.

Eldem&#x27;s second book of &quot;The Hidden History&quot; trilogy, &quot;&quot; was published in April 2006. &quot;Fraternis&quot; focuses on alleged lost records of ancient wisdom; a mysterious, legendary collection of writings, traces of which he says can be found under various names like &quot;The Sibylline Books&quot;, &quot;Corpus Hermetica&quot; or &quot;The Lost Books of Phoenicians&quot;.

Eldem prepared an eight-days article series in April 2005 for the daily newspaper Akşam, which presented a mini summary of &quot;2012: Rendez-vous With Marduk&quot;. Since then, he publishes his articles only at his official website and once in a month contributes to the online magazine &quot;Derki&quot;.

<doc id="498228" wikidata="Q1821552" url="?curid=498228" title="Carbon–carbon bond">
<text>A carbon–carbon bond is a covalent bond between two carbon atoms. The most common form is the single bond: a bond composed of two electrons, one from each of the two atoms. The carbon–carbon single bond is a sigma bond and is formed between one hybridized orbital from each of the carbon atoms. In ethane, the orbitals are sp3-hybridized orbitals, but single bonds formed between carbon atoms with other hybridizations do occur (e.g. sp2 to sp2). In fact, the carbon atoms in the single bond need not be of the same hybridization. Carbon atoms can also form double bonds in compounds called alkenes or triple bonds in compounds called alkynes. A double bond is formed with an sp2-hybridized orbital and a p-orbital that is not involved in the hybridization. A triple bond is formed with an sp-hybridized orbital and two p-orbitals from each atom. The use of the p-orbitals forms a pi bond.

==Chains and branching==
Carbon is one of the few elements that can form long chains of its own atoms, a property called catenation. This coupled with the strength of the carbon–carbon bond gives rise to an enormous number of molecular forms, many of which are important structural elements of life, so carbon compounds have their own field of study: organic chemistry.
Branching is also common in C−C skeletons. Carbon atoms in a molecule are categorized by the number of carbon neighbors they have:
* A primary carbon has one carbon neighbor.
* A secondary carbon has two carbon neighbors.
* A tertiary carbon has three carbon neighbors.
* A quaternary carbon has four carbon neighbors.

In &quot;structurally complex organic molecules&quot;, it is the three-dimensional orientation of the carbon–carbon bonds at quaternary loci which dictates the shape of the molecule. Further, quaternary loci are found in many biologically active small molecules, such as cortisone and morphine.

==Synthesis==
Carbon–carbon bond-forming reactions are organic reactions in which a new carbon–carbon bond is formed. They are important in the production of many human-made chemicals such as pharmaceuticals and plastics. The reverse reaction, where a carbon-carbon bond is broken, is known as carbon-carbon bond activation.

Some examples of reactions which form carbon–carbon bonds are the aldol reaction, Diels–Alder reaction, Grignard reaction, cross-coupling reactions, the Michael reaction and the Wittig reaction.

The directed synthesis of desired three-dimensional structures for tertiary carbons was largely solved during the late 20th century, but the same ability to direct quaternary carbon synthesis did not start to emerge until the first decade of the 21st century.

==Bond strengths and lengths==
The carbon-carbon single bond is weaker than C-H, O-H, N-H, H-H, H-Cl, C-F, and many double or triple bonds, and comparable in strength to C-O, Si-O, P-O, and S-H bonds, but is commonly considered as strong.

The values given above represent C-C bond dissociation energies that are commonly encountered; occasionally, outliers may deviate drastically from this range.

==Extreme cases==
===Long, weak C-C single bonds===
Various extreme cases have been identified where the C-C bond is elongated. In Gomberg&#x27;s dimer, one C-C bond is rather long at 159.7 picometers. It is this bond that reversibly and readily breaks at room temperature in solution:
In the even more congested molecule hexakis(3,5-di-&quot;tert&quot;-butylphenyl)ethane, the bond dissociation energy to form the stabilized triarylmethyl radical is only 8 kcal/mol. Also a consequence of its severe steric congestion, hexakis(3,5-di-&quot;tert&quot;-butylphenyl)ethane has a greatly elongated central bond with a length of 167 pm.

===Twisted, weak C-C double bonds===
The structure of tetrakis(dimethylamino)ethylene (TDAE) is highly distorted. The dihedral angle for the two N2C ends is 28º although the C=C distance is normal 135 pm. The nearly isostructural tetraisopropylethylene also has a C=C distance of 135 pm, but its C6 core is planar.

===Short, strong C-C triple bonds===
On the opposite extreme, the central carbon–carbon single bond of diacetylene is very strong at 160 kcal/mol, as the single bond joins two carbons of sp hybridization. Carbon–carbon multiple bonds are generally stronger; the double bond of ethylene and triple bond of acetylene have been determined to have bond dissociation energies of 174 and 230 kcal/mol, respectively. A very short triple bond of 115 pm has been observed for the iodonium species [HC≡C–I+Ph] [CF3SO3–], due to the strongly electron-withdrawing iodonium moiety.

<doc id="498230" wikidata="Q770386" url="?curid=498230" title="Southwest Chief">
<text>The Southwest Chief (formerly the Southwest Limited and Super Chief) is a long-distance passenger train operated by Amtrak on a route between Chicago and Los Angeles through the Midwest and Southwest via Kansas City, Albuquerque, and Flagstaff mostly on the BNSF&#x27;s Southern Transcon, but branches off between Albuquerque and Kansas City via the Topeka, La Junta, Raton, and Glorieta Subdivision. Amtrak bills the route as one of its most scenic, with views of the Painted Desert and the Red Cliffs of Sedona, as well as the plains of Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, and Colorado.

During fiscal year 2023, the &quot;Southwest Chief&quot; carried 253,838 passengers, a 13.5% increase from FY2022. However, this is a 25% decrease from its pre-COVID-19 pandemic ridership of 338,180 passengers in FY2019. The route grossed in revenue during FY 2016, a 3.8% decrease from FY 2017.

== History ==


The &quot;Southwest Chief&quot; is the successor to the &quot;Super Chief&quot;, which was inaugurated in 1936 as the flagship train of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. For most of its existence, it was &quot;all-Pullman&quot;, carrying sleeping cars only. The Santa Fe merged the &quot;Super Chief&quot; with its all-coach counterpart, the &quot;El Capitan&quot;, in 1958. The merged train was known as the &quot;Super Chief/El Capitan&quot;, but retained the train numbers used by the &quot;Super Chief&quot;, 17 westbound and 18 eastbound.

When Amtrak was created, ATSF was initially willing to retain the famed &quot;Chiefs.&quot; However, any railroad that opted out of Amtrak would have been required to operate &quot;all&quot; of its passenger routes until at least 1976. This led to the 1 May, 1971, Santa Fe turning over all of its main passenger services to Amtrak. Initially Amtrak retained the &quot;Super Chief&quot;/&quot;El Capitan&quot; names with Santa Fe&#x27;s permission. From June 11 to September 10, 1972, Amtrak operated the &quot;Chief&quot;, a second Chicago–Los Angeles train along the same route, reviving the name of another notable Chicago–Los Angeles sleeper train operated by the Santa Fe. This was the only occasion on which Amtrak ran a second train to duplicate a long-distance service outside the New York–Florida corridor. Amtrak dropped the &quot;El Capitan&quot; designation on April 19, 1973, truncating only the name to &quot;Super Chief&quot;, and on March 7, 1974, the Santa Fe directed Amtrak to stop using the &quot;Super Chief&quot; and &quot;Texas Chief&quot; (another notable service originally operated by Santa Fe and which between Chicago and Emporia, Kansas shared route with the &quot;Super Chief/El Capitan&quot;. Amtrak also took over that service in 1971, although after complaints filed by Santa Fe, it was renamed &quot;Lone Star&quot;.) names due to a perceived reduction in the quality of services, after the Amtrak takeover. In October 1980 the Limited began running with the new coaches Superliner I built by Pullman-Standard, being the fourth of Amtrak&#x27;s western long-distance trains to be equipped with the new coaches (already running with such cars were the &quot;San Francisco Zephyr&quot;, &quot;Desert Wind&quot; and &quot;Empire Builder&quot;). On November 30, 1981, Amtrak replaced the ex-&quot;Super Chief&quot; &quot;Pleasure Dome&quot; and &quot;Hi-Level&quot; cars on the &quot;Southwest Limited&quot; with new superliners, completing the replacement of the original old &quot;Super Chief&quot; cars with the new cars. The old Hi-Level coaches used on the &quot;El Capitan&quot; inspired the design for the Superliners. Santa Fe managers, impressed by the design of the new Superliners, permitted Amtrak to restore the name &quot;Chief&quot; to the train, and Amtrak renamed it the &quot;Southwest Chief&quot; on October 28, 1984. In September 1993, the &quot;Chief&quot; was the first of Amtrak&#x27;s western long-distance trains to receive the new Superliner II sleeping coaches built by Bombardier Transportation.

In 1979, the &quot;Southwest Chief/Limited&quot; route between Kansas City and Emporia was shifted in order to maintain service to Topeka and Lawrence, which would otherwise have lost service when the &quot;Texas Chief/Lone Star&quot; was discontinued. Until the 1979 realignment via Topeka, service operated via the direct route between Kansas City and Emporia, via Olathe, Gardner and Ottawa.

===1990s===

The western portion of the Pasadena Subdivision was converted to the Gold Line in the 1990s, requiring the &quot;Southwest Chief&quot; to be rerouted to the San Bernardino Subdivision between Los Angeles and San Bernardino. Eastbound service was rerouted on November 28, 1993, replacing the stops at and with . Westbound service was rerouted on January 15, 1994. An additional stop at was added on April 29, 2002.

Prior to 1996, the &quot;Southwest Chief&quot; operated in Illinois between Chicago and via the ATSF&#x27;s Chillicothe Subdivision, stopping at , , and Chillicothe. Following the merger between Burlington Northern and Santa Fe that gave birth to BNSF in 1995, a connector track was built near Cameron, southwest of Galesburg, which would allow freight and passenger trains to transfer from the Chillicothe Subdivision to the BN Mendota Subdivision, the former Chicago and Aurora Railroad / Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy - CB&amp;Q tracks. The &quot;Chief&quot; was rerouted by the Mendota Subdivision through , , and to Galesburg, a route shared with the &quot;California Zephyr&quot; long distance service, and the Amtrak Midwest &quot;Illinois Zephyr and Carl Sandburg&quot; services. &quot;Southwest Chief&quot; service to Joliet, Streator and Chillicothe was dropped as part of the realignment, although Joliet continues to see Amtrak service from other trains. The &quot;Chief&quot; realignment through the Cameron Connector to the Mendota Sub tracks caused Amtrak to concentrate all of its Galesburg operations in the present station, and the station building along the former Santa Fe line was closed and later demolished.

In January 1994, the &quot;Southwest Chief&quot; was rerouted between San Bernardino and Los Angeles onto the Santa Fe Third District via Fullerton and Riverside. Previously, it served Pasadena and Pomona via the Santa Fe Pasadena Subdivision, which was closed to all through traffic following damage to a bridge over the eastbound lanes of Interstate 210 in Arcadia during the Northridge Earthquake.

Between 1997 and 1998, Amtrak operated the &quot;Southwest Chief&quot; in conjunction with the Washington–Chicago &quot;Capitol Limited&quot;. The two trains used the same Superliner equipment sets and passengers traveling on both trains could remain aboard during the layover in Chicago. Originally announced in 1996, Amtrak planned to call this through service &quot;National Chief&quot; and assign it its own numbers (15/16), but the name and numbers were never used. Amtrak dropped the practice with its May 1998 timetable.

=== 2010s ===
The &quot;Southwest Chief&quot; was one of five routes studied for possible performance improvements by Amtrak in FY 2012.

The part of the &quot;Southwest Chief&#x27;s&quot; route in western Kansas, southeastern Colorado, and northeastern New Mexico faced uncertainty throughout the 2010s.

In 2010, BNSF said that Amtrak would have to pay for all track maintenance on the portion of the &quot;Southwest Chief&quot;″ route between La Junta and Lamy (Raton and Glorieta Subdivisions), because BNSF does not run any freight trains over this segment. BNSF also said that they would be lowering the track class on the portion of the &quot;Southwest Chief&#x27;s&quot; route between Hutchinson and La Junta from Class IV to Class III and decreasing the passenger train speed limit from to .

In return, BNSF proposed rerouting the &quot;Southwest Chief&quot; from the affected sections of track to its Southern Transcon via Wichita, Amarillo, and Clovis—the same route once used by the &quot;San Francisco Chief&quot;. To avoid a reroute, Amtrak sought help from the affected states—Kansas, Colorado, and New Mexico. The states eventually contributed money toward rebuilding and rehabilitating the tracks—much of it obtained from federal transportation grants—and the route was not changed.

However, this same part of the &quot;Southwest Chief&#x27;s&quot; route was threatened again in 2018 when it became the focal point of a struggle to determine whether to continue Amtrak as a national network or to operate regional stand-alone networks. The issue arose when Amtrak introduced new requirements for the third renewal grant and raised previously undiscussed technical issues. A letter dated May 31, 2018, co-signed by 11 Senators, condemned the action and urged providing the match. In an open letter, former Amtrak President and CEO Joseph H. Boardman said, &quot;The &quot;Southwest Chief&quot; issue is the battleground whose outcome will determine the fate of American’s national interconnected rail passenger network&quot;.

In June 2018, Amtrak announced that it was considering the replacement of rail service along the Kansas portion of the &quot;Southwest Chief&quot; with Amtrak Thruway buses between Albuquerque and Dodge City, where train service east to Chicago would resume. Senators in the affected area succeeded in offering an amendment to a funding bill. Per a press release from the office of co-sponsor Senator Jerry Moran, &quot;This amendment would provide resources for maintenance and safety improvements along the Southwest Chief route and would compel Amtrak to fulfill its promise of matching funding for the successful TIGER IX discretionary grant ... In addition, this amendment would effectively reverse Amtrak’s decision to substitute rail service with bus service over large segments of the route through FY2019&quot;.

===2020s===

In February 2020, USDOT granted $225,000 toward studying a &quot;Southwest Chief&quot; spur train service that would run to Colorado Springs, Colorado, via Pueblo. This follows prior plans to add service to Pueblo and connect with the proposed Front Range Passenger Rail service between Denver and Pueblo. It would have also run along former Colorado &amp; Southern tracks through Walsenburg, reconnecting with its current alignment at Trinidad.

In May 2022, the Missouri General Assembly approved $1 million of state funds to establish a &quot;Southwest Chief&quot; infill station in Carrollton, between the Kansas City and La Plata stations. If approved by the governor, the state funds would have to be matched by local agencies.

===Incidents===
On October 2, 1979, the &quot;Southwest Limited&quot; derailed at Lawrence, Kansas. Of the 30 crew and 147 passengers on board, two were killed and 69 were injured. The cause was excessive speed on a curve. Underlying causes included the engineer&#x27;s unfamiliarity with the route and speed restriction signage having been removed during track repairs.

On August 9, 1997, the eastbound &quot;Southwest Chief&quot; derailed about 5 miles northeast of Kingman, Arizona, when a bridge whose undergirding had been washed out by a flash flood and severe rains, collapsed under the weight of the train, which was traveling close to . While the lead locomotive stayed on the track, the three locomotives, nine passenger cars, and seven baggage and mail cars derailed. All stayed upright. One car straddled the gap of the washed out portion of the bridge. No one was killed out of the 325 passengers and crew aboard the train, though 154 were injured.

On October 16, 1999, the westbound &quot;Southwest Chief&quot; suffered a minor derailment near Ludlow, California, following the Hector Mine earthquake. All the cars stayed upright and four passengers were injured.

On March 15th, 2000, at 2 in the morning, the “Southwest Chief” was rounding a curve outside of Chicago and left the tracks. Again, like 1997 and 1999 incidents, there were zero fatalities.

On March 14, 2016, the &quot;Southwest Chief&quot; derailed from Cimarron, Kansas. Of 14 crew and 128 passengers, 20 were injured. Investigators determined the train derailed after the tracks were knocked out of alignment by a runaway truck from a nearby farm operation that had rolled down a hill and struck the tracks after its owners failed to secure the parking brake.

On June 27, 2022, the eastbound &quot;Southwest Chief&quot; derailed after striking a dump truck at a level crossing near Mendon, Missouri. Of 12 crew and 275 passengers, 3 deaths and 150 injuries have been reported; the driver of the truck also died.

== Operations ==

The &quot;Southwest Chief&quot; runs up to along a significant portion of its route, made possible by automatic train stop systems originally installed by the Santa Fe Railway. Of Amtrak&#x27;s long-distance routes, only the &quot;Texas Eagle&quot; runs faster (with a maximum speed of through much of Illinois).

During the spring and summer, volunteer rangers with the Trails and Rails program from the National Park Service travel on board and provide a narrative between La Junta, Colorado, and Albuquerque, New Mexico. Beginning in May 2013, Trails and Rails volunteers also boarded to provide narration between Chicago and La Plata, Missouri.

From June through August, the &quot;Southwest Chief&quot; is used by Scouts traveling to and from Philmont Scout Ranch via the Raton station. During those months, Raton station is staffed by Amtrak employees and handles checked baggage.

=== Equipment ===
The &quot;Southwest Chief&quot; runs Superliner train sets. Trains typically consist of two P40 or P42 locomotives, a baggage car, three or four sleeper cars, a dining car, sightseer lounge and three coach cars. If demand warrants, a fourth coach is added between Chicago and Kansas City. Private cars or deadhead cars also sometimes ride along. 

As is already happening on all its long-distance routes, Amtrak will replace the P42DCs with modern Siemens ALC-42 locomotives by 2027, and the Superliner cars with new long-distance cars by 2032.

== Route ==

The westbound train is Amtrak number 3 (number 4 eastbound). Upon leaving Chicago Union Station, the train travels along the Metra BNSF Railway Line and the Mendota Subdivision, with an intermediate stops in Naperville, Mendota and Galesburg, Illinois.

After leaving Galesburg, the train enters the Cameron Connector and then enters the Southern Transcon. Between Niota, Illinois and Fort Madison, Iowa, the train crosses the Mississippi River via the historic Santa Fe Swing Span Bridge before stopping at the historic Santa Fe station. Until 2021 the service stopped at the station located in the BNSF yard, west of Fort Madison downtown. After leaving Fort Madison, the train travels in a southwest direction, stopping at La Plata, before arriving shortly after 9 p.m. at Kansas City Union Station. Before reaching Kansas City, the train crosses the Missouri River via the Sibley Bridge.

After Kansas City, the train travels overnight through southern Kansas, with stops at Lawrence, Topeka, Newton, Hutchinson, Dodge City and Garden City, before stopping at Lamar, the service&#x27;s first stop in Colorado, shortly before sunrise.

The portion of the route between La Junta and Albuquerque (Raton and Glorieta Subdivisions) is known for having some of the last active semaphores on a Class I railroad mainline, dating back to the ATSF era. Little and/or no freight traffic on those portions of the Chief&#x27;s route is what caused the semaphores to last until the present day, although over time many were removed by both BNSF and NMDOT. whilst no longer in active use, they currently remain at their present location. 

In August 2024, the last semaphores located on the NMDOT (former 4th Santa Fe District / Glorieta Sub) section of the line, between WSS Lamy and Waldo Siding near Cerrillos were replaced, leaving only 11 blades currently in operation between Wagon Mound and Colmor, in the BNSF Raton Subdivision. From BNSF there is no timeline when the 11 last semaphores will be replaced.

<doc id="498233" wikidata="Q420061" url="?curid=498233" title="Aldol">
<text>In organic chemistry, an aldol is a structure consisting of a hydroxy group (-OH) two carbons away from either an aldehyde or a ketone. The name combines the suffix &#x27;ol&#x27; from the alcohol and the prefix depending on the carbonyl group, either &#x27;ald&#x27; for an aldehyde, or &#x27;ket&#x27; for a ketone, in which case it referred to as a &#x27;ketol&#x27;. An aldol may also use the term β-hydroxy aldehyde (or β-hydroxy ketone for a ketol). The term &quot;aldol&quot; may refer to 3-hydroxybutanal.

Aldols are the product of a carbon-carbon bond-formation reaction, giving them wide applicability as a precursor for a variety of other compounds.

==Synthesis and reactions==

Aldols are usually synthesized from an aldol addition reaction using two aldehydes or an aldehyde and a ketone for a ketol. These reactions may also be done intramolecularly to form 5 or 6 member rings or for stereoselective syntheses in the active area of asymmetric synthesis.

Aldols may also undergo a condensation reaction in which the hydroxy group is replaced by a pi bond. The final structure is a reactive α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compound, which can also be used in a variety of other reactions:
:RC(O)CH2CH(OH)R&#x27; → RC(O)CH=CHR&#x27; + H2O

== Applications ==
Aldols synthesized from two aldehydes are usually unstable, often producing secondary compounds such as diols, unsaturated aldehydes, or alcohols. Hydroxypivaldehyde is a rare example of a distillable aldol. The aldol 3-hydroxybutanal is a precursor to quinaldine, which is a precursor to the dye quinoline Yellow SS.

Aldols are also used as intermediates in the synthesis of polyketide natural products and drugs such as Oseltamivir and Epothilone.

<text>The Texas Eagle is a long-distance passenger train operated daily by Amtrak on a route between Chicago, Illinois, and San Antonio, Texas, with major stops in St. Louis, Little Rock, Dallas, Fort Worth, and Austin. Three days per week, the train joins the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; in San Antonio and continues to Los Angeles via El Paso and Tucson. The combined route is the longest in the United States and the second-longest in the Americas, after the &quot;Canadian&quot;.

Prior to 1988, the train was known simply as the Eagle.

Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Texas Eagle&quot; is the direct successor of the Missouri Pacific Railroad and Texas and Pacific Railway train of the same name, which was inaugurated in 1948 and ultimately discontinued in 1971. The route of Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Texas Eagle&quot; is longer (Chicago to San Antonio versus St. Louis to San Antonio), but much of today&#x27;s route is historically a part of the original &quot;Texas Eagle&quot; route. St. Louis to Texarkana and Taylor, Texas, to San Antonio travels over former Missouri Pacific Railroad trackage, while the Texarkana to Fort Worth segment traverses the former Texas and Pacific Railway. The T&amp;P merged with MoPac in 1982; in turn MoPac was acquired by Union Pacific in 1986.

The &quot;Eagle&quot; began on October 2, 1981, as a restructuring of the &quot;Inter-American&quot;, which had operated a daily schedule from Chicago to Laredo, Texas, via San Antonio since 1973. From 1979 onward, it operated a section to Houston, Texas, which diverged at Temple, Texas. The new &quot;Eagle&quot; dropped the Houston section, while its southern terminus was cut back from Laredo to San Antonio. The new train carried Superliner equipment, replacing the Amfleet coaches on the &quot;Inter-American&quot;. In addition, the new train ran on a thrice-weekly schedule with a through car on the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; to Los Angeles, although the latter was not announced until the April 1982 timetable.

On November 15, 1988, Amtrak revived a Houston section, this time diverging at Dallas and running over the route of the Southern Pacific&#x27;s &quot;Sunbeam.&quot; It was the first time passenger traffic had served that route since 1958. Amtrak had intended to operate the &quot;Lone Star&quot; over this route back in the 1970s, but dropped the plan in the face of obstruction from the Southern Pacific. With the change, Amtrak revived the name &quot;Texas Eagle&quot; for the thrice-weekly Chicago-San Antonio/Houston train, while the off-day Chicago–St. Louis train remained the &quot;Eagle&quot;. This section would be discontinued on September 10, 1995. On April 4, 2013, Amtrak opened a new station in Hope, Arkansas, the hometown of former U.S. president Bill Clinton. was added on November 17, 2016, serving Iron County, Missouri.

In August 2023, Amtrak approved construction of a new station in De Soto, Missouri for trains to stop at between St. Louis and Arcadia Valley.

===COVID-19 pandemic===

As part of Amtrak&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in greatly depressed ridership, service was reduced to tri-weekly throughout the corridor October 11, 2020. In March 2021, Amtrak announced plans to return the &quot;Texas Eagle&quot; to its pre-pandemic schedule on May 24, 2021. However, the train began operating on a five days per week schedule in January 2022 due to a resurgence of the virus caused by the Omicron variant and remained so until March 2022.

===Proposed changes===
In the August 2009 issue of &quot;Trains&quot;, Brian Rosenwald, Amtrak&#x27;s chief of product management, noted that the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; might be replaced by an extension of the &quot;Texas Eagle&quot; to Los Angeles: &quot;We projected the revenue and looked at the logistics, and with a little bit of rescheduling came to the conclusion that we can make this happen with the equipment we have, and the additional revenue the train earns will more than cover the increased operating costs&quot;. The move would restore a connection to the &quot;Coast Starlight&quot; in both directions, and move boarding in Maricopa and Tucson, Arizona, to civilized times. &quot;We are putting a stake in the ground: Triweekly needs to disappear,&quot; Rosenwald said. While the route of the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; would not be entirely replaced, the performance improvements listed explain what will happen:
*Conversion to daily Chicago–Los Angeles train
*Shortening of the schedule by 9 hours
*San Antonio–New Orleans stub service on a daily basis to connect with this train
*Use of the Diner-Lounge on the stub service

These changes would, in turn, create a through-car change similar to that of the &quot;Empire Builder&quot;. Such service would originate from Los Angeles and split at San Antonio, and vice versa from New Orleans.

Amtrak suspended plans to convert the &quot;Texas Eagle/Sunset Limited&quot; into a daily train when UP opposed it, arguing that to run daily service, Amtrak would first have to invest more than $750millions in infrastructure improvements along the route west of San Antonio. UP has subsequently made investments to increase the capacity of the Sunset Route by constructing new sidings and double track sections along the Route.

Passenger totals would double with daily service, according to the PRIIA study that looked at &quot;Texas Eagle&quot;/&quot;Sunset Limited&quot; service. It forecast an incremental improvement of more than 100,000 passengers from the daily service, which is already running in excess of 100,000 a year. However, Amtrak still lacks the equipment and funds needed to move to daily service.

In June 2021, Senator Jon Tester of Montana added an amendment to the Surface Transportation Investment Act of 2021 which would require the U.S. Department of Transportation (not Amtrak itself) to evaluate daily service on all less frequent long-distance trains, meaning the &quot;Texas Eagle/Sunset Limited&quot; and &quot;Cardinal&quot;. The bill passed the Senate Commerce Committee with bipartisan support, and was later rolled into President Biden&#x27;s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), which Congress passed on November5, 2021. The report is known as the Amtrak Daily Long-Distance Service Study and must be delivered to Congress within two years.

In June 2023, Amtrak submitted an application for a federal grant to increase &quot;Texas Eagle/Sunset Limited&quot; service to operate daily.

==Operation==
===Route===
, the southbound &quot;Texas Eagle&quot; (train 21) departs Chicago 1:45 pm, running between Chicago and its first station stop in , parallel to the Illinois and Michigan Canal, along first the Canadian National&#x27;s Freeport Subdivision and then Joliet Subdivision, which is also used by Metra&#x27;s Heritage Corridor and Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Lincoln Service&quot;. From Joliet, the train travels along Union Pacific rails, often parallel to Interstate 55, making station stops in , Bloomington–Normal, Lincoln, Springfield, (a flag stop), and before crossing the Mississippi River to make its stop at St. Louis&#x27; Gateway Multimodal Transportation Center, scheduled for 7:13 pm. After St. Louis, the train skirts the Ozark Mountains, stopping in Poplar Bluff, Missouri, before crossing the state line into Arkansas. In Arkansas, the train stops in , the state capital of , and the stations at , , , and , on the Arkansas–Texas border.

Continuing into Texas, the train makes station stops in , (bus connection with Houston), , and , which has connections to via Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Heartland Flyer&quot;, and from there the train travels on BNSF trackage. The train continues on, making stops in , , (where the train resumes traveling on the Union Pacific), , the state capital of , and , with a scheduled arrival into at 9:55 pm (the next day). A sleeping car and a coach (designated internally as train 421) are conveyed to the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays, departing San Antonio at 2:45 am.

The northbound &quot;Texas Eagle&quot; (train 22) leaves San Antonio at 7 am, splitting from the eastbound &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; (train 422) on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Sundays. The train arrives in Chicago at 1:44 pm the next day.

=== Stations ===
===Equipment===

The normally assigned consist on the &quot;Texas Eagle&quot; includes:

* GE Genesis locomotive
* Superliner sleeper
* Superliner diner-lounge
* 2 Superliner coaches
Three times a week, one coach and one sleeping car operate between Los Angeles and Chicago on the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot; and &quot;Texas Eagle&quot; as train 421/422. To provide extra capacity, an additional Superliner coach operates between Chicago and St. Louis.

The &quot;Texas Eagle&quot; formerly carried a Superliner Sightseer Lounge car. It was removed from the train in October 2020 in response to reduced demand from the COVID-19 pandemic but is expected to return in March 2025. Amtrak plans to replace the P42DCs with modern Siemens ALC-42 locomotives by 2027, and the Superliner cars with new long-distance cars by 2032.

<text>King Jie (; traditionally 1728–1675 BCE) was the 17th and last ruler of the Xia dynasty of China. He is traditionally regarded as a tyrant and oppressor who brought about the collapse of a dynasty.

Around 1600 BCE, Jie was defeated by Tang of Shang, bringing an end to the Xia dynasty that lasted about 500 years, and a rise to the new Shang dynasty.

==Etymology==
&quot;Jié&quot; (variant: ) (&lt; Old Chinese: ) (ZS) means &quot;outstanding&quot; and later &quot;hero&quot;; with regards to Chinese, it is cognate to &quot;qiè&quot; (&lt; OC ) (ZS) &quot;martial&quot;; with regards to languages other than Chinese, it is cognate to either &quot;strength; champion, athlete&quot;, or Mizo: &quot;brave, resolute&quot;.

The rime dictionary &quot;Guangyun&quot; later associates this Xia king&#x27;s name (or epithet) &quot;Jié&quot; with &quot;zhé&quot; &quot;to dismember, to cut asunder&quot;. &quot;Kangxi dictionary&quot; states that 磔 (&quot;zhé&quot;) is synonymous with &quot;pìgū&quot; &quot;to cut asunder and open up&quot;, in &quot;Rites of Zhou&quot;; and that &quot;the ancients asserted that the fierce and devious ( &quot;jiéxiá&quot;) ones are brutal and violent ( &quot;xiōngbào&quot;), as if they were cutting [things] asunder ( &quot;zhé&quot;).&quot;

Historian Pei Yin (裴骃) cites &quot;Rules for Posthumous Names&quot; ( &quot;Shìfǎ&quot;) (attributed to the Duke of Zhou), that &quot;Jié&quot; was meant for those who harmed and killed numerous people.

==Early years==
Jie is generally known as Xia Jie (夏桀) or Jie of Xia. His given name was Lü Gui (履癸). Jie ascended to the throne in the year of &quot;Renchen&quot; (壬辰). Initially, his capital was in Zhenxun. He lived there for three years and constructed his tilt palace. About the same time, he destroyed the pyramid of Rong (容台), and quelled a rebellion by the Quanyi people (aka &quot;Fei Barbarians&quot;) after they entered Qi, near Fen.

His parents were Fa of Xia and his wife.
==King of Xia==

===Ruling===
Jie is known to have lived a lavish lifestyle with slaves and treated his people with extreme cruelty. His style of ruling was reckless and filled with sex, luxury and entertainment. He generally disliked people who criticized him, and many were indeed afraid of him.

In the sixth year of Jie&#x27;s regime, he entertained envoys from vassals and neighbors. He received an envoy from the Qizhong barbarian people (歧踵戎). In the 11th year, he summoned all his vassals to his court. The Youmin Kingdom (有緡) did not come, so Jie attacked and conquered it.

In his 13th year of ruling, he moved his capital from Zhenxun to &#x27;South of the river&#x27; (河南). About that time, he began using the Nian (輦), or sedan chair, on which he was carried by servants.

The next year, he led an army to Minshan. There, he found two of the King of Minshan&#x27;s daughters, Wan(琬) and Yan(琰). They were unmarried and very beautiful, so he took them as his wives, renaming them Zhao (苕) and Hua (華). He abandoned his original wife Mo Xi (妹喜) and built a pyramid on top of the Tilt Palace for them to live in.

===Alcohol lake===

According to Liu Xiang&#x27;s book &quot;Lienü zhuan&quot; written much later, around 18 BC, Jie was corrupted by his infatuation with his concubine Mo Xi (妺喜 or 末喜), who was beautiful, but completely lacking in virtue. Among other things, she liked to drink, enjoyed music, and also had a penchant for jugglers and sing-song girls. Apparently, she had Jie order a lake of wine made. They both sailed about in the alcohol lake in an orgy of drunken naked men and women bathing and drinking. She then commanded 3,000 men to drink the lake dry, only to laugh when they all drowned. This event was also recorded in Han Ying&#x27;s book &quot;Han shi waizhuan&quot;.

===Jie&#x27;s cuisine===
A great deal of effort was spent on Jie&#x27;s cuisine and his requirements. Vegetables had to come from the northwest, fish had to be from the East Sea, seasonings and sauces had to come from ginger that grew in the south, and sea salt had to come from the north. Several hundred people were employed just to supply Jie with his meals. Anyone that got his meal wrong was beheaded.

Jie was also a known alcoholic, but he did not drink regular wine. He drank a specific type of high-quality wine (清醇). The people working for him who could not supply this drink were killed. Many people died because of this. While he was drinking wine it was also required that he ride on someone&#x27;s back like a horse.

In one incident Jie was riding the back of a top chancellor like a horse. After a while the chancellor was tired to the point that he could no longer crawl or move. He asked King Jie to spare him. Jie immediately dragged him out to be executed. Another chancellor, Guan Longfeng (關龍逢), told the king that he was losing the trust of his people along with the Xia dynasty&#x27;s rivers and mountains (江山). After yelling at Guan, he too was dragged out to be killed.

==Collapse of the Xia dynasty==

=== The rise of Shang ===
The Xia dynasty held suzerainty over a number of kingdoms, one of which was the Kingdom of Shang. During Jie&#x27;s reign, Shang grew in power, initially at the expense of Xia&#x27;s other vassals. A person by the name of Zi Lü (履子) was able to win many supporters from as many as 40 smaller kingdoms. Zi, who became known as Tang of Shang, recognized that Jie mistreated the people and used this as a way to convince other supporters. In one speech Tang of Shang said that creating chaos is not something he wanted, but given the terror of Jie, he has to follow the Mandate of Heaven and use this opportunity to overthrow Xia. He also pointed out that even Jie&#x27;s own military generals would not obey his orders.

In the 15th year of Jie&#x27;s reign, Tang of Shang began moving Lü (履) to the capital Bo. About two years later Shang sent his minister Yi Yin as an envoy to Jie. Yi remained in the Xia capital for about three years, before returning to Shang.

The Shang&#x27;s power continued to grow. In the 26th year of Jie&#x27;s reign, Shang conquered Wen. Two years later, Shang was attacked by Kunwu (昆吾), and several years of war between Shang and Kunwu followed. Despite this setback, Shang continued to expand on a number of fronts, gathering vassal troops in Jingbo (景亳). The Shang army and allied forces conquered Mixu (密須) (today&#x27;s 密縣), Wei, and attacked Gu (顧), which was also conquered the following year. Around the same time Zhong Gu, chief historian of Jie, fled from the Xia to the Shang.

===Natural disasters===
As Jie&#x27;s reign went on, the histories record unusual and increasingly dire natural phenomena. These began in the 10th year of Jie&#x27;s reign, when five stars were seen in the sky in alignment and a meteor shower occurred, followed by an earthquake.

In the 29th year of Jie&#x27;s reign he tried to dig a water-tunnel through the Qu mountain, but the next year the mountain collapsed with a landslide. There was also a disaster at Linsui (聆隧) in the winter.

Records from the later Qin dynasty say that during the last year of Jie&#x27;s reign, ice formed during the summer mornings and frost occurred through July. Heavy rainfall toppled buildings, hot and cold weather arrived in disorder, and crops failed. Some scientists correlate this event with a volcanic winter, possibly due to the Minoan eruption of Thera at around 1600 BC.

===Battle of Mingtiao===

In the 32nd year of Jie&#x27;s reign, Tang of Shang dispatched troops from Er (陑) to simultaneously attack Xia and Kunwu. Kunwu was quickly defeated. By this time, the Xia were getting weaker near the Yellow River while the Shang were becoming stronger.

Jie&#x27;s forces fought with the Shang forces at Mingtiao in a heavy thunder storm and were defeated.

Jie himself escaped and fled to Sanzong. The Shang forces, under their general Wuzi (戊子), pursued Jie to Cheng, captured him at Jiaomen and deposed him, bringing the Xia dynasty to an end. Eventually, Jie was released in Nanchao. Jie eventually died of illness. Tang of Shang succeeded him as king, and inaugurated the Shang dynasty.

== Family ==
King Jie had a wife named Mo Xi (妺喜) who was blamed for the fall of the Xia dynasty, but he later abandoned her for the King of Minshan&#x27;s daughters Wan and Yan whom Jie renamed Zhao and Hua. King Jie had no known children with his wives. It is alleged that Chunwei, the possible ancestor of the Xiongnu ruling elite, was his son.

<text>The Northern Pacific Railway was an important transcontinental railroad that operated across the northern tier of the western United States, from Minnesota to the Pacific Northwest. It was approved and chartered in 1864 by the 38th Congress of the United States in the national / federal capital of Washington, D.C., during the last years of the American Civil War (1861-1865), and given nearly of adjacent land grants, which it used to raise additional money in Europe (especially in President Henry Villard&#x27;s home country of the new German Empire), for construction funding.

Construction began in 1870 and the main line opened all the way from the Great Lakes to the Pacific Ocean, just south of the United States-Canada border when Ulysses S. Grant, drove in the final &quot;golden spike&quot; completing the line in western Montana Territory (future State of Montana in 1889), on September 8, 1883. The railroad had about of track and served a large area, including extensive trackage in the western Federal territories and later states of Idaho, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, Oregon, Washington, and Wisconsin. In addition, the N.P. had an international branch running north to Winnipeg, capital of the province of Manitoba, in the newly organized Canada. The main activities were shipping wheat and other farm products, cattle, timber, and minerals; bringing in consumer goods, transporting passengers; and selling land.

The Northern Pacific was headquartered in Minnesota, first in Brainerd, then in the state capital of Saint Paul. It had a tumultuous financial history; the N.P. merged with other lines over a century later in 1970 to form the modern Burlington Northern Railroad, which in turn merged with the famous Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway to become the renamed BNSF Railway in 1996, operating in the western U.S.

==History==
===Organization===

The 38th United States Congress chartered the Northern Pacific Railway Company on July 2, 1864, with the goals of connecting the Great Lakes with Puget Sound on the northwestern coast of the United States on the Pacific Ocean, opening vast new lands for farming, ranching, lumbering and mining, and linking the federal territory of Washington and state of Oregon to the rest of the country (plus connecting the northern Great Plains of central Canada to the northern states of the U.S. and especially its Midwestern big cities, manufacturing centers and markets.

The U.S. Congress granted the Northern Pacific Railroad a generous potential bonanza of of land adjacent to the line in exchange for building rail transportation to an undeveloped western territory. Josiah Perham was elected its first president on December 7, 1864. It could not use all the land and in the end took just under two-thirds of the allotted grant of 40 million acres.

===Jay Cooke takes control===
For the next six years, backers of the road struggled to find financing. Though John Gregory Smith, succeeded Perham as second president on January 5, 1865, groundbreaking did not take place until February 15, 1870, at Carlton, Minnesota, west of Duluth (western port town on Lake Superior of the Great Lakes). The backing and promotions of famed New York City / Wall Street financier Jay Cooke, in the summer of 1870 brought the first real momentum to the railway company.

Over the course of 1871, the Northern Pacific pushed westward from Minnesota into the Dakota Territory (present-day state of North Dakota). Surveyors and construction crews had to maneuver through swamps, bogs, and tamarack forests. The difficult terrain and insufficient funding delayed by six months the construction phase in Minnesota. The N.P. also began building its line north from Kalama, Washington Territory, on the Columbia River just outside of Portland, Oregon, towards the Puget Sound. Four small construction locomotive engines were purchased, the &quot;Minnetonka&quot;, &quot;Itaska&quot;, &quot;Ottertail&quot; and &quot;St. Cloud&quot;, the first of which was shipped to Kalama by ship all around the continent of South America and the Cape Horn to the Pacific Ocean. In Minnesota, the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad completed construction of its line stretching from Saint Paul east to Lake Superior at Duluth in 1870. It was leased to the Northern Pacific line six years later in the American Centennial celebration year of 1876 and was eventually absorbed by the Northern Pacific. The famed &quot;North Coast Limited&quot; was the Northern Pacific&#x27;s flagship passenger train and the Northern Pacific itself was built along the trail first blazed by the famed Lewis and Clark expedition first exploring the new Louisiana Purchase and the further American West in 1804 and 1805.

The Northern Pacific reached Fargo, Dakota Territory (now North Dakota) on the border between Dakota Territory and Minnesota early in June 1872. The following year, in June 1873, the N.P. reached the shores of the upper Missouri River at Edwinton, Dakota Territory (now the state capital of Bismarck, North Dakota). In the west sector, the N.P. track extended north from Kalama. Surveys were carried out in the Dakota Territory protected by 600 troops of the horse cavalry of the United States Army, under command of Civil War hero, General Winfield Scott Hancock, nicknamed &quot;Hancock the Superlative&quot; but defeated Democratic Party candidate in the 1880 presidential election.

Fabricating shops and foundries were established in Brainerd, Minnesota, a town named by the N.P. second President John Gregory Smith for Lawrence Brainerd, the father of his wife Anna Elizabeth Brainerd and a close friend and colleague. It was here further back on the line where the Railway established its first temporary offices and headquarters. A severe stock market crash and financial collapse in the East after 1873, led by the Credit Mobilier Scandal and the Union Pacific Railroad stock fraud, caused a nationwide economic recession and financial panic in New York City&#x27;s Wall Street financial district, stopping further railroad building for twelve years during the latter 1870s and early 1880s.

In 1886, the company restarted and put down of main line across the northern Dakotas, with an additional from the west in Washington Territory. On November 1, General George Washington Cass (formerly of the U.S. Army), became the third president of the company. General Cass had been a vice-president and on the board of directors earlier of the Pennsylvania Railroad, one of the major dominant Eastern lines and would lead the Northern Pacific through some of its most difficult times in the later 19th century.

Attacks on survey parties and construction crews as they approached the Yellowstone region by Sioux, Cheyenne, Arapaho, and Kiowa native warriors in northern Dakota and Minnesota Territories became so prevalent that the company received protection from additional mounted troops in units of the U.S. Army.

===Settlement===

In 1886, the Northern Pacific also opened colonization / emigration offices in Europe especially the newly unified German Empire and north to the kingdoms of Scandinavia, with good reliable steamship lines, attracting Nordic farmers with package deals of cheap land and transportation and purchase deals in the similar cold higher latitudes of climate of the north-central North America continent, but with richer unplowed expansive soil. The success of the N.P. was based on the abundant crops of wheat and other grains already grown and the attraction to settlers of the lower Red River Valley of the Red River of the North, Minnesota, Missouri and Mississippi Rivers basins along the Minnesota-Dakota border in the decade between 1881 and 1890.

The Northern Pacific reached Dakota Territory at Fargo in 1872 and began its career as one of the central factors in the economic growth of the future Dakotas Territory and later its twin states North and South. The climate, although very cold in the continental interior heartland was still suitable for wheat, which was in high demand in the eastern and Mid-Western rapidly developing industrial cities of the United States and even growing exports overseas to Europe. Most of the settlers were German and Scandinavian immigrants who bought the land cheaply and raised large families. They shipped huge quantities of wheat to Minneapolis, then Milwaukee, Chicago and St. Louis connected by rail. while buying all sorts of farming equipment and home supplies (some ordered and delivered through the beginnings of published mail-order catalogs from the big cities warehouses, to be shipped in by rail.

The N.P. used its federal land grants as security to borrow money to build its system. The federal government kept every other alternate section of land, and gave it away free to native and immigrant homesteaders / farmers under the Homestead Act of 1862. At first the railroad sold much of its holdings at low prices to land speculators in order to realize quick cash profits, and also to eliminate sizable annual tax bills. By 1905, the railroad company&#x27;s land policies changed, after it was judged a costly mistake to have sold much of the land at wholesale prices. With better railroad service and improved more educated and scientific methods of farming and soil conservation in future decades in the special unique conditions on the Great Plains. The Northern Pacific then easily sold what had been heretofore termed &quot;worthless&quot; land directly to farmers at good prices. By 1910 the railroad&#x27;s holdings in the new state of North Dakota had been greatly reduced.

===Panic of 1873 and first bankruptcy===
In 1873, Northern Pacific made impressive strides before a terrible stumble. Rails from the east reached the Missouri River on June 4. After several years of study, Tacoma, Washington Territory near the Pacific Coast and Puget Sound for waterborne shipping port facilities was selected as the road&#x27;s western terminus on July 14, 1873.

For the previous three years the financial house of Jay Cooke and Company in New York City had been throwing money into the construction of the Northern Pacific. As with many western transcontinentals, the staggering costs of building a railroad into a vast wilderness prairie had been drastically underestimated. Cooke had little success in marketing the N.P.R.R. bonds in Europe and overextended his house in meeting overdrafts of the mounting construction costs. Cooke overestimated his managerial skills and failed to appreciate the limits of a banker&#x27;s ability to be also a promoter, and the danger of freezing his assets in the bonds of the Northern Pacific. Cooke and Company went bankrupt on September 18, 1873. Soon the financial Panic of 1873 engulfed the United States, business and financial community extending to numerous industries beginning an economic depression that was one of the worse in American history prior to the infamous Great Depression of the 1930s, sixty years into the future. The downturn ruined or nearly paralyzed newer railroads throughout the country.

The Northern Pacific however luckily survived bankruptcy that year, due to austerity measures put in place by President Cass. In fact, working with last-minute loans from Director John C. Ainsworth of Portland, the Northern Pacific still completed the line north along the Pacific Ocean and U.S. west coast from Kalama to Tacoma, a distance of , before the end of 1873. On December 16, the first steam locomotive train arrived in Tacoma. But by the next year in 1874 the company was approaching insolvency.

Northern Pacific slipped into its first bankruptcy on June 30, 1875. President Cass resigned to become the court-appointed receiver of the company, and Charles Barstow Wright became its fourth president. Frederick Billings, namesake of future Billings, Montana, formulated a reorganization plan which was put into effect.

Throughout 1874 to 1876, elements of the 7th Cavalry Regiment of the U.S. Army under the command of Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer, operating out of Fort Abraham Lincoln and Fort Rice in the Dakota Territory conducted expeditions to protect the railroad survey and construction crews in Dakota and Montana Territories.

===Frederick Billings and first reorganization===
In 1877, construction resumed in a small way. Northern Pacific pushed a branch line southeast from Tacoma to Puyallup, Washington and on to the coal fields around Wilkeson, Washington. Much of the coal was destined for export through Tacoma to San Francisco, California, where it would be thrown into the fireboxes of Central Pacific Railroad&#x27;s steam engines locomotives.

This small amount of construction was one of the largest projects the company would undertake in the years between 1874 and 1880. That same year the company built a large shop complex at Edison, Washington (now part of south Tacoma metropolitan area). The Edison Shops became the largest on the system for building and repairing freight cars due to the easy access of cheap lumber. The Brainerd Shops to the east remained as the largest locomotive repair facility throughout the steam era. Another shops / foundry site was located at the center mid-way of the mainline in Livingston, Montana, which became the primary diesel engine maintenance facility after 1955. In St. Paul, Minnesota were the Como Shops, which maintained most of the passenger car fleet, and the Gladstone Shops, which closed in 1915.

On May 24, 1879, Frederick H. Billings became the fifth president of the company. Billings&#x27; tenure would be short but ferocious. Reorganization, bond sales, and improvement in the U.S. economy allowed Northern Pacific to strike out across the upper Missouri River by letting a contract to build of railroad west of the river. The railroad&#x27;s new-found strength, however, would be seen as a threat in certain quarters.

===Henry Villard, Gold Creek, Golden Spike===
German-born former war correspondent / journalist and later newspaper / magazine publisher Henry Villard (6th President N.P.R.R. 1881-1884), had raised capital for western railroads in Europe (especially in the recently unified German Empire), from 1871 to 1873. After returning to New York City in 1874, he invested on behalf of his clients in railroads in Oregon. Through Villard&#x27;s work, most of these lines became properties of the European creditors&#x27; holding company, the Oregon and Transcontinental Company.

Of the lines held by the Oregon and Transcontinental, the most important was the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company, which ran east from Portland, Oregon along the left bank of the Columbia River to a connection with the Union Pacific Railroad&#x27;s Oregon Short Line at the confluence of the Columbia River and the Snake River near Wallula, Washington. The Union Pacific and Central Pacific lines had completed the first trans-continental route 12 years earlier in 1869.

Within a decade of his return, Villard was head of a transportation empire in the Pacific Northwest that had but one real competitor, the Northern Pacific Railroad. The Northern Pacific&#x27;s trans-continental route completion threatened the holdings of Villard in the Northwest, and especially in Portland. Portland unfortunately could possibly become a second-class city if the Puget Sound&#x27;s deeper and larger ports at Tacoma and nearby Seattle, Washington, were further developed and connected to the East by rail.

Villard, who had been building a monopoly of river and rail transportation in Oregon for several years, now launched a daring raid. Using his European connections and a reputation for having &quot;bested&quot; Jay Gould in a battle for control of the Kansas Pacific Railroad years before, Villard solicited and raised $8,000,000 million dollars from his associates. This was his famous &quot;Blind Pool,&quot; Villard&#x27;s associates were not told what the money would be used for. In this case, the funds were used by him to purchase control of the Northern Pacific.


Despite a tough fight, Billings and his backers were forced to capitulate; he resigned the presidency June 9, 1881. Ashbel H. Barney, former President of Wells Fargo &amp; Company (bankers and famous Western stagecoach line), served briefly as interim caretaker of the railroad from June 19 to September 15, when Villard was elected sixth president by the stockholders. For the next two years, Villard and the Northern Pacific rode the whirlwind.

In 1882, of main line and of branch line were completed, bringing totals to and , respectively. On October 10, 1882, the line from Wadena, Minnesota, to Fergus Falls, Minnesota, opened for service. The upper Missouri River was bridged with a million-dollar span on October 21, 1883. Until then, crossing of the Missouri had had to be managed with a ferry boat service for most of the year; in winter, when ice was thick enough, rails were laid across the river itself.

Former Union Army General Herman Haupt, another veteran of the Civil War, builder then of the wartime United States Military Railroad lines and the civilian Pennsylvania Railroad, organized the Northern Pacific Beneficial Association in 1881. Inspired by the progressive medical care and insurance program then being introduced in the German Empire in Europe and a forerunner of the modern health maintenance organization, the N.P.B.A. ultimately established a series of four medical hospitals across the N.P.R.R. route system in Saint Paul, Minnesota; Glendive, Montana; Missoula, Montana; and Tacoma, Washington, to care for its railroad employees, retirees, and their families.

On January 15, 1883, the first N.P.R.R. train reached Livingston, Montana, at the eastern foot of the Bozeman Pass. Livingston, like Brainerd and South Tacoma before it, would grow to encompass a large backshop handling heavy repairs for the Northern Pacific Railroad equipment. It would also mark the east–west dividing line on the Northern Pacific route system.
Villard pushed hard for the completion of the Northern Pacific in 1883. His crews laid an average of a mile and half () of track each day. In early September, as the line neared completion. To celebrate, and to gain national publicity for investment opportunities in his region, Villard chartered four trains to carry guests from the East to Gold Creek in western Montana Territory No expense was spared, and the list of dignitaries included Frederick Billings, former 18th President Ulysses S. Grant (served 1869-1877), only two years before his tragic death from cancer, and Villard&#x27;s in-laws, the family of famed longtime abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, who had just died four years earlier. On September 8, 1883, the Gold Spike was driven near Gold Creek in the Montana Territory.

===Direct to Puget Sound===
Villard&#x27;s fall was swifter than his ascendancy. Like Jay Cooke, he was now consumed by the enormous costs of constructing the railroad. Wall Street bears attacked the stock shortly after the Golden Spike, after the realization that the Northern Pacific was a very long road with very little business. Villard himself suffered a nervous breakdown in the days after the driving of the Golden Spike, and he left the presidency of the Northern Pacific in January 1884.

Again, the presidency of the Northern Pacific was handed to a professional railroader, Robert Harris, former head of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. For the next four years, until the return of the Villard group, Harris worked at improving the property and ending its tangled relationship with the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company.

Throughout the mid-1880s, the Northern Pacific pushed to reach Puget Sound directly, rather than by means of a roundabout route that followed the Columbia River. Surveys of the Cascade Mountains, carried out intermittently since the 1870s, began anew. Virgil Bogue, a veteran civil engineer, was sent to explore the Cascades again. On March 19, 1881, he discovered Stampede Pass. In 1883, John W. Sprague, the head of the new Pacific Division, drove the Golden Spike to mark the beginning of the railroad from what would become Kalama, Washington. He resigned a months later due to impaired health.

In 1884, after the departure of Villard, the Northern Pacific began building toward Stampede Pass from Wallula in the east and the area of Wilkeson in the west. By the end of the year, rails had reached Yakima, Washington in the east. A gap remained in 1886.

In January of that year, Nelson Bennett was given a contract to construct a tunnel under Stampede Pass. The contract specified a short amount of time for completion, and a large penalty if the deadline were missed. While crews worked on the tunnel, the railroad built a temporary switchback route across the pass. With numerous timber trestles and grades which approached six percent, the temporary line required two M class 2-10-0s—the two largest locomotives in the world (at that time)—to handle a tiny five-car train. On May 3, 1888, crews holed through the tunnel, and on May 27 the first train passed through directly to Puget Sound.

===Villard and the Panic of 1893===
Despite this success, the Northern Pacific, like many U.S. roads, was living on borrowed time. From 1887 until 1893, Henry Villard returned to the board of directors. Though offered the presidency, he refused. An associate of Villard dating back to his time on the Kansas Pacific, Thomas Fletcher Oakes, assumed the presidency on September 20, 1888.

In an effort to garner business, Oakes pursued an aggressive policy of branch line expansion. In addition, the Northern Pacific experienced the first competition in the form of James Jerome Hill and his Great Northern Railway. The Great Northern, like the Northern Pacific before it, was pushing west from the Twin Cities towards Puget Sound, and would be completed in 1893.

Mismanagement, sparse traffic, and the Panic of 1893 sounded the death knell for the Northern Pacific and Villard&#x27;s interest in railroading. The company slipped into its second bankruptcy on October 20, 1893. Oakes was named receiver and Brayton Ives, a former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, became president.

===Railroad labor dispute===
In 1894, the 10th Cavalry Regiment of the U.S. Army was involved in protecting property of the Northern Pacific Railroad from striking workers.

===From Villard to Morganization===
For the next three years, the Villard-Oakes interests and the Ives interest feuded for control of the Northern Pacific. Oakes was eventually forced out as receiver, but not before three separate courts were claiming jurisdiction over the Northern Pacific&#x27;s bankruptcy. Things came to a head in 1896, when first Edward Dean Adams was appointed president, then less than two months later, Edwin Winter.

Ultimately, the task of straightening out the muddle of the Northern Pacific was turned over to J. P. Morgan. Morganization of the Northern Pacific, a process which befell many U.S. roads in the wake of the Panic of 1893, was handed to Morgan lieutenant Charles Henry Coster. The new president, beginning September 1, 1897, was Charles Sanger Mellen.

Though James J. Hill had purchased an interest in the Northern Pacific during the troubled days of 1896, Coster and Mellen would advocate, and follow, a staunchly independent line for the Northern Pacific for the next four years. Only the early death of Coster from overwork, and the promotion of Mellen to head the Morgan-controlled New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in 1903, would bring the Northern Pacific closer to the orbit of James J. Hill.

===Hill, Harriman and the Northern Pacific Corner===
In the late 1880s, the Villard regime, in another one of its costly missteps, attempted to stretch the Northern Pacific from the Twin Cities to the all-important rail hub of Chicago, Illinois. A costly project was begun in creating a union station and terminal facilities for a Northern Pacific which had yet to arrive.

Rather than build directly down to Chicago, perhaps following the Mississippi River as the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy had done, Villard chose to lease the Wisconsin Central. Some backers of the Wisconsin Central had long associations with Villard, and an expensive lease was worked out between the two companies which was only undone by the Northern Pacific&#x27;s second bankruptcy.

The ultimate result was that the Northern Pacific was left without a direct connection to Chicago, the primary interchange point for most of the large U.S. railroads. Fortunately, the Northern Pacific was not alone. James J. Hill, controller of the Great Northern Railway, which was completed between the Twin Cities and Puget Sound in 1893, also lacked a direct connection to Chicago. Hill went looking for a road with an existing route between the Twin Cities and Chicago which could be rolled into his holdings and give him a stable path to that important interchange. At the same time, E. H. Harriman, head of the Union Pacific Railroad, was also looking for a road which could connect his company to Chicago.

The road both Harriman and Hill looked at was the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy. To Harriman, the Burlington was a road which paralleled much of his own and offered tantalizing direct access to Chicago. For Hill as well, there was the possibility of a high-speed link directly with Chicago. Though the Burlington did not parallel the Great Northern or the Northern Pacific, it would give them a powerful railroad in the central West. Harriman was the first to approach the Burlington&#x27;s aging leader, the irascible Charles Elliott Perkins. The price for control of the Burlington, as set by Perkins, was $200 a share, more than Harriman was willing to pay. Hill met the price, and control of the Burlington was divided equally at about 48.5 percent each between the Great Northern and the Northern Pacific.

Not to be outdone, Harriman now came up with a crafty plan: buy a controlling interest in the Northern Pacific and use its power on the Burlington to place friendly directors upon its board. On May 3, 1901, Harriman began his stock raid which would become known as the Northern Pacific Corner. By the end of the day, he was short just 40,000 shares of common stock. Harriman placed an order to cover this, but was overridden by his broker, Jacob Schiff, of Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co. Hill, on the other hand, reached the vacationing Morgan in Italy and managed to place an order for 150,000 shares of common stock. Though Harriman might be able to control the preferred stock, Hill knew the company bylaws allowed for the holders of the common stock to vote to retire the preferred.

In three days, the Harriman-Hill imbroglio managed to wreak havoc on the stock market. Northern Pacific stock was quoted at $150 a share on May 6 and is reported to have traded as much as $1,000 a share behind the scenes. Harriman and Hill now worked to settle the issue for brokers to avoid panic. Hill, for his part, attempted to avoid future stock raids by placing his holdings in the Northern Securities Company, a move which would be undone by the Supreme Court in 1904 under the auspices of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. Harriman was not immune either; he was forced to break up his holdings in the Union Pacific Railroad and the Southern Pacific Railroad a few years later.

===From Hill to Howard Elliott===
In 1903, Hill finally got his way with the House of Morgan. Howard Elliott, another veteran of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, became president of the Northern Pacific on October 23. Elliott was a relative of the Burlington&#x27;s crusty chieftain Charles Elliott Perkins, and more distantly the Burlington&#x27;s great backer, John Murray Forbes. He had spent 20 years in the trenches of Midwest railroading, where rebates, pooling, expansion and rate wars had brought ruinous competition. Having seen the effects of having multiple railroads attempt to serve the same destination, he was very much in tune with James J. Hill&#x27;s philosophy of &quot;community of interest,&quot; a loose affiliation or collusion among roads in an attempt to avoid duplicating routes, rate wars, weak finances and ultimately bankruptcies and reorganizations. Elliott would be left to make peace with the Hill-controlled Great Northern; the Harriman-controlled Union Pacific; and, between 1907 and 1909, the last of the northern transcontinentals, the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, more commonly known as the Milwaukee Road.

===Into the twentieth century===
The Northern Pacific steadily improved after the turn of the century. Together with the Great Northern, the Northern Pacific also gained control of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, gaining important access to Chicago, the central Middle West and Texas, as well as the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway, an important route through eastern and southern Washington. Its physical plant was upgraded continuously, with double tracking in key areas and automatic block signaling along its entire main line. This in turn gave way to centralized traffic control, microwave communications, and radio communications as time progressed.

The Northern Pacific continuously maintained and upgraded its equipment and service. The road helped pioneer the 4-8-4 Northern type steam engine and the 2-8-8-4 Yellowstone. It was also among the first railroads in the country to dieselize—beginning with General Motors’ FTs in 1944—albeit among the last to complete dieselization, not doing so until 1960 owing to low cost (albeit low quality) coal reserves in Wyoming.

The Northern Pacific&#x27;s premier passenger train, the &quot;North Coast Limited&quot;, was among the safest and finest in the nation, suffering only one passenger fatality in nearly seventy years of operation.

By 1900, most of the remaining land-grant holdings were located west of Montana, in the &quot;western district&quot;. The railroad still hoped to sell this land, both to provide operating funds and to populate the region to provide new markets to sustain the railroad. Nearly all the good farmlands had been sold, leaving large tracts of grazing land or timber. The grazing acreage was poor quality and difficult to sell. However, the timber lands were of high quality; much of these were sold to Frederick Weyerhaeuser.

===Unification of the Hill Lines===
In later years, Louis W. Menk became president of the Northern Pacific, and then he brought it together with the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad, the Great Northern Railway, and the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway on March 2, 1970, to form the Burlington Northern Railroad. The merger was allowed despite a challenge in the Supreme Court, essentially reversing the outcome of the 1904 Northern Securities ruling. A portion of the former Northern Pacific mainline in Montana was spun off to form the Montana Rail Link. However, as of January 10, 2022, BNSF terminated its lease of the former Northern Pacific right-of-way to the MRL which is set to return to the direct management of the BNSF.

==Divisions==

In 1949, the Northern Pacific&#x27;s headquarters in Saint Paul presided over a system of , which of main line, of branch line under seven operating divisions.

===Lake Superior===
Headquartered in Duluth, Minnesota, the Lake Superior Division&#x27;s main routes were from Duluth to Ashland, Wisconsin, Duluth to Staples, Minnesota, and Duluth to White Bear Lake, Minnesota. The division encompassed 631 route miles: 356 in main line and 274 in branches.

===St. Paul===
Headquartered in St. Paul, Minnesota in the company&#x27;s Railroad and Bank Building, the St. Paul Division&#x27;s main routes were from Saint Paul to Staples, Saint Paul to White Bear Lake, and Staples to Dilworth, Minnesota. The division encompassed 909 route miles: 310 in main line and 599 in branches.

===Fargo===
Headquartered in Fargo, North Dakota, the Fargo Division&#x27;s main routes were from Dilworth to Mandan, North Dakota. The division encompassed 1,167 route miles: 216 in main line and 951 in branches.

===Yellowstone===
Headquartered in Glendive, Montana, the Yellowstone Division&#x27;s main routes were from Mandan, North Dakota, to Billings, Montana, and from Billings to Livingston, Montana. The division encompassed 875 route miles: 546 in main line and 328 in branches.

===Rocky Mountain===
Headquartered in Missoula, Montana, the Rocky Mountain Division&#x27;s main routes were from Livingston to Paradise, Montana via Helena, Montana and Mullan Pass, and from Logan, Montana, to Garrison, Montana, via Butte, Montana, and Homestake Pass. The division encompassed 892 route miles: 563 in main line and 330 in branches. It was home to the principal central district repair facility at Livingston, Montana.

===Idaho===
Headquartered in Spokane, Washington, the Idaho Division&#x27;s main routes were from Paradise, Mont., to Yakima, Washington, via Pasco, Washington. The division encompassed 1,123 route miles: 466 in main line and 657 in branches.

===Tacoma===
Headquartered in Tacoma, Washington, the Tacoma Division&#x27;s main routes were from Yakima to Stuck Junction, near future Auburn, Washington, Seattle, Washington to Sumas, Washington, on the border with British Columbia, Canada, and from Seattle to Portland, Oregon. The division encompassed 1,034 route miles: 373 in main line and 661 in branches. It was home to the principal west end repair facility at South Tacoma, Washington.

As the railroad expanded, immigrants, families, and single men moved to the Pacific Northwest. Tacoma&#x27;s population grew rapidly: in 1880 there were 1,098 residents, and in 1889 there were 36,000.

==Passenger service==
The &quot;North Coast Limited&quot; was the premier passenger train operated by the Northern Pacific Railway between Chicago and Seattle via Butte, Montana and Homestake Pass. It commenced service on April 29, 1900, served briefly as a Burlington Northern train after the merger on March 2, 1970, and ceased operation on April 30, 1971, the day before Amtrak began service. The Chicago Union Station to Saint Paul leg of the train&#x27;s route was operated by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad along its Mississippi River mainline through Wisconsin.

The Northern Pacific&#x27;s secondary transcontinental passenger train was the &quot;Alaskan,&quot; until it was replaced by the &quot;Mainstreeter&quot; on November 16, 1952. The &quot;Mainstreeter&quot;, which operated via Helena, Montana and Mullan Pass, continued in service through the Burlington Northern merger until Amtrak Day (May 1, 1971). It had been reduced to a Saint Paul to Seattle train after the last run of the former Burlington Route &quot;Black Hawk&quot; on April 12–13, 1970.

The Northern Pacific also participated in the &quot;Coast Pool Train&quot; service between Portland and Seattle with the Great Northern Railway and the Union Pacific Railroad. NP and GN &quot;Coast Pool Trains&quot; lasted until Amtrak.

There were several other passenger trains which were discontinued before the Burlington Northern merger. These included:
* Saint Paul to International Falls, Minnesota;
* Saint Paul to Duluth, Minnesota (which at one time was also a pool operation, with Great Northern Railway and the Soo Line);
* Duluth to Staples, Minnesota;
* Saint Paul to Jamestown, North Dakota (the last remnant of the Alaskan);
*Fargo, North Dakota to Winnipeg, Manitoba;
* Minneapolis to Taylors Falls commuter rail;

===The Route of &quot;the Great Big Baked Potato&quot;===

Hazen Titus was appointed as the line&#x27;s dining car superintendent in 1908. He learned that Yakima Valley farmers were unable to sell their potato crops because the potatoes they were growing were simply too large; they fed them to the hogs. Titus learned that a single potato could weigh from two to five pounds, but that smaller potatoes were preferred by the end buyers of the vegetable because many people considered large potatoes inedible due to their thick, rough skin.

Titus and his staff discovered the &quot;inedible&quot; potatoes were delicious after baking in a slow oven. He contracted to purchase as many potatoes as the farmers could produce that were more than two pounds in weight. Soon after the first delivery of &quot;Netted Gem Bakers&quot;, they were offered to diners on the North Coast Limited beginning in early 1909. Word of the line&#x27;s specialty offering traveled quickly, and before long it was using &quot;the Great Big Baked Potato&quot; as a slogan to promote the railroad&#x27;s passenger service. Hollywood stars were hired to promote it. When an addition was built for the Northern Pacific&#x27;s Seattle commissary in 1914, a &quot;Railway Age&quot; reporter wrote, &quot;A large trade mark, in the shape of a baked potato, 40 ft. long and 18 ft. in diameter, surmounts the roof. The potato is electric lighted and its eyes, through the electric mechanism, are made to wink constantly. A cube of butter thrust into its split top glows intermittently.&quot; Premiums such as postcards, letter openers, and spoons were also produced to promote &quot;The Route of the Great Big Baked Potato&quot;; the slogan served the Northern Pacific for about 50 years.

*Adna Anderson (1827–1889), engineer-in-chief, February 18, 1880, to January 1888. In October 1886, he was also named second vice-president of the Northern Pacific. He completed the line between Saint Paul, Minnesota, and Wallula (where it connected with the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company&#x27;s line to Portland), witnessing the driving of the last spike on September 8, 1883. Thereafter, he evaluated possible routes for the Cascade Division, intended to connect the NP at some point near the mouth of the Snake River with Tacoma, Washington on Puget Sound. Preliminary reconnaissance and surveys began in March 1880, and in autumn, 1883, Anderson concluded that the line should be built through Stampede Pass.
*John William Kendrick (1853–1924), chief engineer, January 1888, to July 1893. From July 1893, to February 1, 1899, he was general manager of the reorganized Northern Pacific Railway.
*Edwin Harrison McHenry (1859 – August 21, 1931), chief engineer, July 1893, to September 1, 1901. Subsequently, he was chief engineer for the Canadian Pacific Railway and then fourth vice-president of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad.

==Locomotives==

==Trademark==
In search of a trademark, the Northern Pacific considered and rejected many designs. Edwin Harrison McHenry, the Chief Engineer, was struck with a geometric design, a Taijitu in the Korean flag he saw while visiting the Korean exhibit at the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair in 1893. The idea came to him that it was just the symbol for the long-sought-for trademark. With a slight modification, and rendered in red and black, the symbol became the railroad&#x27;s trademark.

In 1876, photographer Frank Jay Haynes began contract work with the railroad for publicity photographs. In 1881 he met Charles Fee and through his 20-year friendship with Fee, Haynes became known as the &quot;Official Photographer of the N.P.R.R&quot;. His &quot;Northern Pacific Views&quot; photographically documented over the years, the routes, destinations, infrastructure and equipment of the railroad.

<doc id="498255" wikidata="Q1027170" url="?curid=498255" title="Aldol condensation">
<text>An aldol condensation is a condensation reaction in organic chemistry in which two carbonyl moieties (of aldehydes or ketones) react to form a β-hydroxyaldehyde or β-hydroxyketone (an aldol reaction), and this is then followed by dehydration to give a conjugated enone.

The overall reaction equation is as follows (where the Rs can be H)
Aldol condensations are important in organic synthesis and biochemistry as ways to form carbon–carbon bonds.

In its usual form, it involves the nucleophilic addition of a ketone enolate to an aldehyde to form a β-hydroxy ketone, or aldol (aldehyde + alcohol), a structural unit found in many naturally occurring molecules and pharmaceuticals.

The term &quot;aldol condensation&quot; is also commonly used, especially in biochemistry, to refer to just the first (addition) stage of the process—the aldol reaction itself—as catalyzed by aldolases. However, the first step is formally an addition reaction rather than a condensation reaction because it does not involve the loss of a small molecule.

==Mechanism==

The first part of this reaction is an Aldol reaction, the second part a dehydration—an elimination reaction (Involves removal of a water molecule or an alcohol molecule). Dehydration may be accompanied by decarboxylation when an activated carboxyl group is present. The aldol addition product can be dehydrated via two mechanisms; a strong base like potassium &quot;t&quot;-butoxide, potassium hydroxide or sodium hydride deprotonates the product to an enolate, which eliminates via the E1cB mechanism, while dehydration in acid proceeds via an E1 reaction mechanism. Depending on the nature of the desired product, the aldol condensation may be carried out under two broad types of conditions: kinetic control or thermodynamic control. Both ketones and aldehydes are suitable for aldol condensation reactions. In the examples below, aldehydes are used.

=== Base-catalyzed aldol condensation ===
The mechanism for base-catalyzed aldol condensation can be seen in the image below. 
The process begins when a free hydroxide (strong base) strips the highly acidic proton at the alpha carbon of the aldehyde. This deprotonation causes the electrons from the C–H bond to shift and create a new C–C pi bond. The new pi bond then acts as a nucleophile and attacks the remaining aldehyde in the solution, resulting in the formation of a new C–C bond and regeneration of the base catalyst. In the second part of the reaction, the presence of base leads to elimination of water and formation of a new C–C pi bond. The product is referred to as the aldol condensation product.

=== Acid-catalyzed aldol condensation ===
The mechanism for acid-catalyzed aldol condensation can be seen in the image below. 
== Crossed aldol condensation ==

A crossed aldol condensation is a result of two dissimilar carbonyl compounds containing α-hydrogen(s) undergoing aldol condensation. Ordinarily, this leads to four possible products as either carbonyl compound can act as the nucleophile and self-condensation is possible, which makes a synthetically useless mixture. However, this problem can be avoided if one of the compounds does not contain an α-hydrogen, rendering it non-enolizable. In an aldol condensation between an aldehyde and a ketone, the ketone acts as the nucleophile, as its carbonyl carbon does not possess high electrophilic character due to the +I effect and steric hindrance. Usually, the crossed product is the major one. Any traces of the self-aldol product from the aldehyde may be disallowed by first preparing a mixture of a suitable base and the ketone and then adding the aldehyde slowly to the said reaction mixture. Using too concentrated base could lead to a competing Cannizzaro reaction.

==Examples==
The Aldox process, developed by Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon, converts propene and syngas to 2-ethylhexanol via hydroformylation to butyraldehyde, aldol condensation to 2-ethylhexanal and finally hydrogenation.

Pentaerythritol is produced on a large scale beginning with crossed aldol condensation of acetaldehyde and three equivalents of formaldehyde to give pentaerythrose, which is further reduced in a Cannizzaro reaction.
== Scope ==
Ethyl 2-methylacetoacetate and campholenic aldehyde react in an Aldol condensation. The synthetic procedure is typical for this type of reaction. In the process, in addition to water, an equivalent of ethanol and carbon dioxide are lost in decarboxylation.
Ethyl glyoxylate 2 and glutaconate (diethyl-2-methylpent-2-enedioate) 1 react to &quot;isoprenetricarboxylic acid&quot; 3 (isoprene (2-methylbuta-1,3-diene) skeleton) with sodium ethoxide. This reaction product is very unstable with initial loss of carbon dioxide and followed by many secondary reactions. This is believed to be due to steric strain resulting from the methyl group and the carboxylic group in the &quot;cis&quot;-dienoid structure.

Occasionally, an aldol condensation is buried in a multistep reaction or in catalytic cycle as in the following example:

In this reaction an &quot;alkynal&quot; 1 is converted into a cycloalkene 7 with a ruthenium catalyst and the actual condensation takes place with intermediate 3 through 5. Support for the reaction mechanism is based on isotope labeling.

The reaction between menthone ((2&quot;S&quot;,5&quot;R&quot;)-2-isopropyl-5-methylcyclohexanone) and anisaldehyde (4-methoxybenzaldehyde) is complicated due to steric shielding of the ketone group. This obstacle is overcome by using a strong base such as potassium hydroxide and a very polar solvent such as DMSO in the reaction below:
The product can epimerize by way of a common intermediate—enolate A—to convert between the original (&quot;S&quot;,&quot;R&quot;) and the (&quot;R&quot;,&quot;R&quot;) epimers. The (&quot;R&quot;,&quot;R&quot;) product is insoluble in the reaction solvent whereas the (&quot;S&quot;,&quot;R&quot;) is soluble. The precipitation of the (&quot;R&quot;,&quot;R&quot;) product drives the epimerization equilibrium reaction to form this as the major product.

== Other condensation reactions ==

There are other reactions of carbonyl compounds similar to aldol condensation:

* When the base is an amine and the active hydrogen compound is sufficiently activated the reaction is called a Knoevenagel condensation.
* In a Perkin reaction the aldehyde is aromatic and the enolate generated from an anhydride.
* Claisen-Schmidt condensation between an aldehyde or ketone having an α-hydrogen with an aromatic carbonyl compound lacking an α-hydrogen.
* A Claisen condensation involves two ester compounds.
* A Dieckmann condensation involves two ester groups in the &quot;same molecule&quot; and yields a cyclic molecule
* In the Japp–Maitland condensation water is removed not by an elimination reaction but by a nucleophilic displacement
* A Robinson annulation involves an α,β-unsaturated ketone and a carbonyl group, which first engage in a Michael reaction prior to the aldol condensation.
* In the Guerbet reaction, an aldehyde, formed &quot;in situ&quot; from an alcohol, self-condenses to the dimerized alcohol.

<text>Curtis Ousley (born Curtis Montgomery; February 7, 1934 – August 13, 1971), known professionally as King Curtis, was an American saxophonist who played rhythm and blues, jazz, and rock and roll. A bandleader, band member, and session musician, he was also a musical director and record producer. A master of the instrument, he played tenor, alto, and soprano saxophone. He played riffs and solos on hit singles such as &quot;Respect&quot; by Aretha Franklin (1967), and &quot;Yakety Yak&quot; by The Coasters (1958) and his own &quot;Soul Twist&quot; (1962), &quot;Soul Serenade&quot; (1964), and &quot;Memphis Soul Stew&quot; (1967).

==Early life==
Curtis Montgomery was born in Fort Worth, Texas, the son of Ethel Montgomery, and was adopted, with his sister Josephine Allen (died 2019), by Josie and William Ousley. Curtis attended I.M. Terrell High School, and studied and performed music with schoolmate Ornette Coleman (1930–2015).

==Career==
Curtis started playing saxophone at the age of twelve in the Fort Worth area. He took interest in many musical genres including jazz, rhythm and blues, and popular music. As a student pursuing music, he turned down college scholarships in order to join the Lionel Hampton Band. During his time with Hampton, he was able to write and arrange music and learn guitar. In 1952 Curtis decided to move to New York and became a session musician, recording for such labels as Prestige, Enjoy, Capitol, and Atco. He recorded with Nat Adderley, Wynton Kelly, Buddy Holly, and Andy Williams as well as playing on Waylon Jennings&#x27; first ever recording in 1958. 

Stylistically, Curtis took inspiration from saxophonists Lester Young, Louis Jordan, Illinois Jacquet, Earl Bostic, and Gene Ammons. Known for his syncopated and percussive style, he was both versatile and powerful as a musician. He put together a group during his time as a session musician that included Richard Tee, Cornell Dupree, Jerry Jemmott, and Bernard Purdie.

===Move into rock===
Curtis enjoyed playing both jazz and rhythm and blues but decided he would make more money as a rhythm and blues musician. In a 1971 interview with Charlie Gillett he said: &quot;I love the authentic rhythm and blues more than anything, and I also like to live well.&quot; From the 1950s until the mid-1960s, he worked as a session musician, recording under his own name and with others such as The Coasters, with whom he recorded &quot;Yakety Yak&quot; and &quot;Charlie Brown&quot;, among others. Buddy Holly hired him for session work, during which they recorded &quot;Reminiscing.&quot; Holly wrote this song, but gave Curtis the songwriting credit for flying down to the session. His best-known singles from this period are &quot;Soul Twist&quot;—his highest-charting single, reaching number one on the R&amp;B chart and number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop chart—and &quot;Soul Serenade.&quot; He provided backing on a number of songs for LaVern Baker, including her 1958 hit single &quot;I Cried a Tear&quot;, where his saxophone became &quot;a second voice&quot;.

In 1965 he moved to Atlantic Records and recorded his most successful singles, &quot;Memphis Soul Stew&quot; and &quot;Ode to Billie Joe&quot; (1967). In 1966 Curtis recorded 3 songs with Jimi Hendrix, &quot;Linda Lou&quot;, &quot;Baby How About You&quot; and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Take It&quot;. Unissued, the tapes were later destroyed in a fire at Atlantic&#x27;s master tape library. He worked with The Coasters, and led Aretha Franklin&#x27;s backing band the Kingpins. The Kingpins opened for the Beatles during their 1965 performance at Shea Stadium. Curtis produced records, often working with Jerry Wexler and recorded for Groove Records during this period, including the Joe South song &quot;Games People Play&quot; with guitarist Duane Allman. One unique session came in 1963, when Curtis provided the honking sax backing for &quot;Mad Magazine&quot;&#x27;s novelty burping record, &quot;It&#x27;s a Gas.&quot;

In March 1971 he appeared with Aretha Franklin and the Kingpins at the Fillmore West, which resulted in two live albums: &quot;Aretha Live at Fillmore West&quot;, and Curtis&#x27; own &quot;Live at Fillmore West&quot;. In July 1971, Curtis recorded saxophone solos on &quot;It&#x27;s So Hard&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Be a Soldier&quot; from John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Imagine&quot;. Along with the Rimshots, he recorded the original theme song for the 1971 hit television show &quot;Soul Train,&quot; titled &quot;Hot Potatoes&quot;.

On June 17, 1971, Curtis played at the Montreux Jazz Festival, in the Casino Kursaal, with Champion Jack Dupree, backed by Cornell Dupree on guitar, Jerry Jemmott on bass and Oliver Jackson on drums. The recording of the concert was later released as the 1973 album &quot;King Curtis &amp; Champion Jack Dupree – Blues at Montreux&quot; on the Atlantic label.

==Death==
Curtis was stabbed late on the night of August 12, 1971, during an argument with Juan Montanez who was loitering on Curtis&#x27;s front steps with an unidentified female. He was discovered on the stoop outside his Manhattan apartment at 50 West 86th Street. Curtis was attempting to access the fusebox to the apartment (his central air conditioning system was tripping the breaker) when he confronted Montanez, who refused to move from the entrance. A fight ensued and Montanez stabbed Curtis. Curtis was transferred to Roosevelt Hospital, where he died early on the morning of August 13, 1971. In March 1972, Montanez had his charge reduced from second degree murder to second degree manslaughter in exchange for pleading guilty. He was released on December 5, 1977, from the Wallkill Correctional Facility for good behavior.

On the day of Curtis&#x27;s funeral, Atlantic Records closed their offices. Jesse Jackson administered the service and as the mourners filed in, Curtis&#x27;s band, the Kingpins, played &quot;Soul Serenade&quot;. Among those attending were Ousley&#x27;s immediate family, including sister Josephine Ousley Allen, other family members, Aretha Franklin, Cissy Houston, Brook Benton and Duane Allman. Franklin sang the closing spiritual &quot;Never Grow Old&quot; and Stevie Wonder performed &quot;Abraham, Martin and John and now King Curtis&quot;. Allman went on to honor Curtis by interweaving a medley of &quot;Soul Serenade&quot; into the band&#x27;s rendition of &quot;You Don&#x27;t Love Me&quot;, first in a show at the Academy of Music on East 14th Street in Manhattan on August 15, and later during a live in-studio recording at A&amp;R Studios in Manhattan on August 26, recorded for posterity and released on LP as part of the band&#x27;s &quot;Dreams&quot; compilation in 1989.

==Portrayals==
In the film &quot;The Buddy Holly Story&quot; (1978), King Curtis was played by actor Craig White. He appears in the scene at New York&#x27;s Apollo Theater, which would have taken place between August 16–22, 1957. during Holly&#x27;s Irvin Feld Tour. In the television series &quot;Genius: Aretha Franklin&quot; he is portrayed by actor Marque Richardson.
The novelty instrumental Yakety Sax by Boots Randolph is based on Curtis&#x27;s solo in the Coasters&#x27; Yakety Yak.

==Awards==
In 1970, a year before his death, Curtis won the Best R&amp;B Instrumental Performance Grammy for &quot;Games People Play&quot;. He was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 6, 2000.

<doc id="498263" wikidata="Q157962" url="?curid=498263" title="Thutmose I">
<text>Thutmose I (sometimes read as Thutmosis or Tuthmosis I, Thothmes in older history works in Latinized Greek; meaning &quot;Thoth is born&quot;) was the third pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty of Egypt. He received the throne after the death of the previous king, Amenhotep I. During his reign, he campaigned deep into the Levant and Nubia, pushing the borders of Egypt farther than ever before in each region. He also built many temples in Egypt, and a tomb for himself in the Valley of the Kings; he is the first king confirmed to have done this (though Amenhotep I may have preceded him).

Thutmose I&#x27;s reign is generally dated to 1506–1493 BC, but a minority of scholars—who think that astrological observations used to calculate the timeline of ancient Egyptian records, and thus the reign of Thutmose I, were taken from the city of Memphis rather than from Thebes—would date his reign to 1526–1513 BC. He was succeeded by his son Thutmose II, who in turn was succeeded by Thutmose II&#x27;s sister, Hatshepsut.

==Family==

Thutmose never called himself &quot;Son of the King&quot;, hence is believed to be born in non-royal family, to woman named Senseneb and an unknown father. Queen Ahmose, who held the title of Great Royal Wife of Thutmose, was probably the daughter of Ahmose I and the sister of Amenhotep I; but she was never called &quot;king&#x27;s daughter,&quot; so there is some doubt about this, and some historians believe she was Thutmose&#x27;s sister. Assuming she was related to Amenhotep, one might speculate that she was married to Thutmose in order to guarantee succession. This is known not to be the case for two reasons. First, Amenhotep&#x27;s alabaster bark built at Karnak associates Amenhotep&#x27;s name with Thutmose&#x27;s name well before Amenhotep&#x27;s death. Second, Thutmose&#x27;s first-born son with Ahmose, Amenmose, was apparently born long before Thutmose&#x27;s coronation. He can be seen on a stela from Thutmose&#x27;s fourth regnal year hunting near Memphis, and he became the &quot;great army-commander of his father&quot; sometime before his death, which was no later than Thutmose&#x27;s own death in his 12th regnal year. Thutmose had another son, Wadjmose, and two daughters, Hatshepsut and Nefrubity, by Ahmose. Wadjmose died before his father, and Nefrubity died as an infant. 

Thutmose had also one son by his another wife, Mutnofret, who was likely a daughter of Ahmose I and a sister of Amenhotep I. This son succeeded him as Thutmose II, whom Thutmose I married to his daughter, Hatshepsut. It was later recorded by Hatshepsut that Thutmose willed the kingship to both Thutmose II and Hatshepsut, but this is considered propaganda by Hatshepsut&#x27;s supporters to legitimise her claim to the throne when she later assumed power.

==Reign==
===Dates and length of reign===

A heliacal rising of Sothis was recorded in the reign of Thutmose&#x27;s predecessor, Amenhotep I, which has been dated to 1517 BC, assuming the observation was made at Thebes. The year of Amenhotep&#x27;s death and Thutmose&#x27;s subsequent coronation can be accordingly derived, and is dated to 1506 BC by most modern scholars. But if the observation were made at either Heliopolis or Memphis, as a minority of scholars argue, Thutmose would have been crowned in 1526 BC. Manetho records that Thutmose I&#x27;s reign lasted 12 years and 9 months (or 13 years) as a certain Mephres in his Epitome. This data is supported by two dated inscriptions from Years 8 and 9 of his reign bearing his cartouche found inscribed on a stone block in Karnak. Accordingly, Thutmose is usually given a reign from 1506 BC to 1493 BC (low chronology), but a minority of scholars date it from 1526 BC to 1513 BC (high chronology).

===Military achievements===

Upon Thutmose&#x27;s coronation, Nubia rebelled against Egyptian rule. According to the tomb autobiography of Ahmose, son of Ebana, Thutmose traveled up the Nile and fought in the battle, personally killing the Nubian king. Upon victory, he had the Nubian king&#x27;s body hung from the prow of his ship, before he returned to Thebes. After that campaign, he led a second expedition against Nubia in his third year in the course of which he ordered the canal at the first cataract—which had been built under Sesostris III of the 12th Dynasty—to be dredged in order to facilitate easier travel upstream from Egypt to Nubia. This helped integrate Nubia into the Egyptian empire. This expedition is mentioned in two separate inscriptions by the king&#x27;s son Thure:
In the second year of Thutmose&#x27;s reign, the king cut a stele at Tombos, which records that he built a fortress at Tombos, near the third cataract, thus permanently extending the Egyptian military presence, which had previously stopped at Buhen, at the second cataract.

==== Campaign in the Levant and Syria ====
Thutmose&#x27;s Tombos stele indicates that he had already fought a campaign in Syria; hence, his Syrian campaign may be placed at the beginning of his second regnal year. This second campaign was the farthest north any Egyptian ruler had ever campaigned. 

Although it has not been found in modern times, he apparently set up a stele when he crossed the Euphrates River. During this campaign, the Syrian princes declared allegiance to Thutmose. But after he returned, they discontinued tribute and began fortifying against future incursions. Thutmose celebrated his victories with an elephant hunt in the area of Niy, near Apamea in Syria, and returned to Egypt with strange tales of the Euphrates, &quot;that inverted water which flows upstream when it ought to be flowing downstream.&quot; The Euphrates was the first major river the Egyptians had ever encountered that flowed from the north, which was downstream on the Nile, to the south, upstream on the Nile. Thus the river became known in Egypt as simply &quot;inverted water.&quot;

Textual sources from the time of Thutmose I include references to Retenu, Naharin, and the &#x27;land of Mitanni&#x27;. The last is believed to be the first historical reference to that kingdom.

Many Levantine sites were destroyed in the middle of the 16th century B.C., and these destructions have often been attributed to the military campaigns of Thutmose I, or of his predecessor Amenhotep I. Initially these campaigns may have aimed at defeating the power of the Hyksos, who were formerly strong in this area.

As many as 20 sites in the Levant suffered destruction at this time. For example, the fiery destruction of Stratum XVIII at Gezer has been assigned to the second half of the 16th century BCE, the time of Amenhotep I and Thutmose I, based on the pottery and scarabs discovered in the destruction debris.

It does not appear that the Egyptians&#x27; aim at this stage was to control the area permanently, because they established no permanent presence in the area. This happened later, during the 18th dynasty.

==== Rebellions in the south ====
Thutmose had to face one more military threat, another rebellion by Nubia in his fourth year. His influence accordingly expanded even farther south, as an inscription dated to his reign has been found as far south as Kurgus, south of the fourth cataract. He inscribed a large tableau on the Hagar el-Merwa, a quartz outcrop c. 40m long and 50m wide 1200 meters from the Nile, on top of several local inscriptions. This is the furthest south the Egyptian presence is attested. During his reign, he initiated a number of projects that effectively ended Nubian independence for 500 years. He enlarged a temple to Sesostris III and Khnum, opposite the Nile from Semna. There are also records of specific religious rites the viceroy of El-Kab was to have performed in the temples in Nubia in proxy for the king. He also appointed a man called Turi to the position of viceroy of Kush, also known as the &quot;King&#x27;s Son of Cush.&quot; With a civilian representative of the king permanently established in Nubia, Nubia did not dare revolt as often as it had and was easily controlled by future Egyptian kings.

===Building projects===
Thutmose I organized great building projects during his reign, including many temples and tombs, but his greatest projects were at the Temple of Karnak under the supervision of the architect Ineni. Before Thutmose, Karnak probably consisted only of a long road to a central platform, with a number of shrines for the solar bark along the side of the road. Thutmose was the first king to drastically enlarge the temple. He had the fifth pylon built along the temple&#x27;s main road, along with a wall around the inner sanctuary and two flagpoles to flank the gateway. Outside of this, he built a fourth pylon and another enclosure wall. Between pylons four and five, he had a hypostyle hall constructed, with columns made of cedar wood. This type of structure was common in ancient Egyptian temples, and supposedly represents a papyrus marsh, an Egyptian symbol of creation. Along the edge of this room he built colossal statues, each one alternating wearing the crown of Upper Egypt and the crown of Lower Egypt. Finally, outside of the fourth pylon, he erected four more flagpoles and two obelisks, although one of them, which now has fallen, was not inscribed until Thutmose III inscribed it about 50 years later. The cedar columns in Thutmose I&#x27;s hypostyle hall were replaced with stone columns by Thutmose III, but at least the northernmost two were replaced by Thutmose I himself. Hatshepsut also erected two of her own obelisks inside Thutmose I&#x27;s hypostyle hall.
In addition to Karnak, Thutmose I also built statues of the Ennead at Abydos, buildings at Armant, Ombos, el-Hiba, Memphis, and Edfu, as well as minor expansions to buildings in Nubia, at Semna, Buhen, Aniba, and Quban.

Thutmose I was the first king who definitely was buried in the Valley of the Kings. Ineni was commissioned to dig this tomb, and presumably to build his mortuary temple. His mortuary temple has not been found, possibly because it was incorporated into or demolished by the construction of Hatshepsut&#x27;s mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahri. His tomb, however, has been identified as KV38. In it was found a yellow quartzite sarcophagus bearing the name of Thutmose I, but Thutmose III may have moved his body into the tomb of Hatshepsut, KV20, which also contains a sarcophagus with the name of Thutmose I on it.

==Death==
===Burial===
Thutmose I was originally buried and then reburied in KV20 in a double burial with his daughter Hatshepsut rather than KV38, which could only have been built for Thutmose I during the reign of his grandson Thutmose III based on &quot;a recent re-examination of the architecture and contents of KV38.&quot; The location of KV20, if not its original owner, had been known since the Napoleonic expedition of 1799 and, in 1844, the Prussian scholar Karl Richard Lepsius had partially explored its upper passage, but all its passageways &quot;had become blocked by a solidified mass of rubble, small stones and rubbish which had been carried into the tomb by floodwaters&quot; and only during the 1903–04 excavation season did Howard Carter, after two previous seasons of strenuous work, clear its corridors and enter its double burial chamber. Here, among the debris of broken pottery and shattered stone vessels from the burial chamber and lower passages, were the remnants of two vases made for Queen Ahmose Nefertari, which formed part of Thutmose I&#x27;s original funerary equipment; one of the vases contained a secondary inscription that says that Thutmose II made it &quot;as his monument to his father.&quot; Other vessels that bore Thutmose I&#x27;s names and titles had also been inscribed by his son and successor, Thutmose II, along with fragments of stone vessels made for Hatshepsut before she herself became king as well as other vessels that bore her royal name of &#x27;Maatkare&#x27;, which would have been made only after she took the throne.
But Carter also discovered two separate coffins in the burial chamber. Hatshepsut&#x27;s beautifully carved sarcophagus &quot;was discovered open with no sign of a body, and with the lid lying discarded on the floor&quot;; it is now housed in the Cairo Museum along with a matching yellow quartzite canopic chest. A second sarcophagus was found lying on its side with its almost undamaged lid propped against the wall nearby; it was eventually presented to Theodore M. Davis, the excavation&#x27;s financial sponsor, as a gesture of appreciation for his support. Davis in turn presented it to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The second quartzite sarcophagus had originally been engraved with the name of &quot;the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Maatkare Hatshepsut&quot;, but when it was complete, Hatshepsut decided to commission an entirely new sarcophagus for herself and donated the existing finished sarcophagus to her father, Thutmose I. The stonemasons then attempted to erase the original carvings by restoring the surface of the quartzite so that it could be re-carved with the name and titles of Tuthmose I instead. This quartzite sarcophagus measures 7 feet long by 3 feet wide with walls 5  inches thick and bears a dedication text that records Hatshepsut&#x27;s generosity towards her father:
Thutmose I was not destined to lie alongside his daughter after Hatshepsut&#x27;s death. Thutmose III, Hatshepsut&#x27;s successor, decided to reinter his grandfather in an even more magnificent tomb, KV38, featuring another yellow sarcophagus dedicated to Thutmose I and inscribed with texts that proclaim this pharaoh&#x27;s love for his deceased grandfather. Unfortunately, Thutmose I&#x27;s remains were disturbed late during the 20th dynasty when KV38 was plundered; the sarcophagus&#x27;s lid was broken and all this king&#x27;s valuable precious jewelry and grave goods were stolen.
===Mummy===

Thutmose I&#x27;s mummy was discovered in the Deir el-Bahri Cache above the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut, revealed in 1881. It had been interred along with those of the 18th- and 19th-dynasty leaders Ahmose I, Amenhotep I, Thutmose II, Thutmose III, Ramesses I, Seti I, Ramesses II, and Ramesses IX, as well as the 21st-dynasty pharaohs Pinedjem I, Pinedjem II, and Siamun.

Thutmose I&#x27;s original coffin was taken over and reused by a later pharaoh of the 21st dynasty. The mummy of Thutmose I was thought to be lost, but Egyptologist Gaston Maspero, largely on the strength of familial resemblance to the mummies of Thutmose II and Thutmose III, believed he had found his mummy in the otherwise unlabelled mummy #5283. This identification has been supported by subsequent examinations, revealing that the embalming techniques used came from the appropriate period of time, almost certainly after that of Ahmose I and made during the 18th dynasty.

Gaston Maspero described the mummy as follows:
James Harris and Fawzia Hussien (1991) conducted an X-ray survey on New Kingdom royal mummies and examined Thutmose I&#x27;s mummified remains. The study found that Thutmose I&#x27;s mummy had all the craniofacial characteristics common among Nubian populations and a “typical Nubian morphology”.

A 2020 genetic study performed by a team under Zahi Hawass on the Amarna royal mummies also featured the unidentified royal mummy previously thought to be Thutmose I in the control samples. The study indicated that the mummy belonged to haplogroup L, which is mainly observed in southern, western and central Asia (highest in the Indian subcontinent). 

What was thought to be his mummy could be viewed in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. But in 2007, Hawass announced that the mummy previously thought to be Thutmose I is that of a 30-year-old man who died as a result of an arrow wound to the chest. Because of the young age of the mummy and the cause of death, it was determined that the mummy was probably not that of Thutmose I. The mummy has the inventory number CG 61065. In April 2021 the mummy was moved to the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization along with those of 17 kings and four queens in an event termed the Pharaohs&#x27; Golden Parade.

<doc id="498265" wikidata="Q200305" url="?curid=498265" title="Milo Đukanović">
<text>Milo Đukanović (, ; born 15 February 1962) is a Montenegrin politician who served as the President of Montenegro from 2018 to 2023, previously serving in the role from 1998 to 2002. He also served as the Prime Minister of Montenegro (1991–1998, 2003–2006, 2008–2010 and 2012–2016) and was the long-term president of the Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro, originally the Montenegrin branch of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, which governed Montenegro alone or in a coalition from the introduction of multi-party politics in the early 1990s until its defeat in the 2020 parliamentary election. He is the longest-ruling contemporary politician in Europe, having held key positions in the country for over 33 years. However, he was defeated by the 36-year-old centrist former economy minister, Jakov Milatović, after the presidential run-off held on 2 April 2023.

When Đukanović first emerged on the political scene, he was a close ally of Slobodan Milošević during the anti-bureaucratic revolution (1988–1989) and the dissolution of SFR Yugoslavia (1991–1992). His cabinet actively participated in the siege of Dubrovnik (1991–1992). Đukanović supported Momir Bulatović&#x27;s agreement on Lord Carrington&#x27;s terms, which resulted in the 1992 Montenegrin independence referendum, where voters decided to remain in FR Yugoslavia. In 1996, however, Đukanović distanced himself from Milošević and the federal government, abandoning the traditional joint Serbian and Montenegrin vision in favour of Montenegrin nationalism, which supported state independence and a separate Montenegrin identity. That led to the division of the party and the split of Bulatović&#x27;s pro-unionist faction. Shortly afterward, Đukanović defeated Bulatović in the 1997 presidential election by a thin margin. In 1999, he negotiated with Western countries in an attempt to limit airstrikes in Montenegro during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, while later Đukanović oversaw the implementation of the Deutsche Mark as the new currency in Montenegro, replacing the Yugoslav dinar.

Following the overthrow of Milošević (2000), he signed an agreement with the new Serbian government that led to the Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro (2003), which allowed for Montenegrin independence. Three years later, the 2006 independence referendum led to a formal separation from the state union and the proclamation of the new Constitution of Montenegro (2007). Đukanović has pursued NATO and EU accession policy, resulting in Montenegro&#x27;s NATO membership in 2017. Over the course of his premiership and presidency, he oversaw the privatization of public companies to foreign investors and firms. Several corruption scandals of the ruling party triggered 2019 anti-government protests, while a controversial religion law sparked another wave of protests. For the first time in three decades, in the 2020 parliamentary election, the opposition won more votes than Đukanović&#x27;s ruling party and its partners.

Some observers have described Đukanović&#x27;s rule as authoritarian or autocratic, as well as a kleptocracy. His brother Aco Đukanović, the owner of Montenegro&#x27;s first private bank, had the upper hand in privatisations, while his sister, the lawyer Ana Kolarevic, controlled the judiciary for a long time. DPS clientelist networks dominated all segments of social life, making party membership necessary to start a business or obtain a position in the administration. In 2020, the Freedom House classified Montenegro as a hybrid regime rather than a democracy, mentioning the years of increasing state capture, abuse of power, and strongman tactics employed by Đukanović. He is often described as having strong links to the Montenegrin mafia. Đukanović was listed among the twenty richest world leaders according to the British newspaper &quot;The Independent&quot; in May 2010, which described the source of his estimated £10 million wealth as &quot;mysterious&quot;. In October 2021, Đukanović and his son Blažo were mentioned in Pandora Papers, linking them to two trusts on British Virgin Islands.

==Early life==
Đukanović was born in Nikšić on 15 February 1962, to Radovan and Stana Đukanović (). His given name is derived from that of a paternal relative who had fought alongside Đukanović&#x27;s grandfather Blažo during World War I; the name was selected by Đukanović&#x27;s paternal grandmother. Đukanović&#x27;s paternal ancestors, members of the Ozrinići tribe who hailed from the village of Čevo, had settled in the Nikšić area following the Battle of Vučji Do in 1876. Prior to the birth of Đukanović&#x27;s older sister Ana in 1960, Đukanović&#x27;s father had worked as a judge in Bosnia and Herzegovina, before relocating to Nikšić with his family and taking up residence in the Đukanović family&#x27;s ancestral village, Rastovac. Đukanović&#x27;s mother was a nurse. His younger brother Aleksandar Đukanović (Aco) was born in 1965. Đukanović completed his primary and secondary education in Nikšić, before relocating to Titograd to attend Veljko Vlahović University&#x27;s Faculty of Economics. He graduated in 1986 with a diploma in tourism studies. Đukanović was an avid basketball player in his youth.

==Political career==
===Early activism===
In 1979, while still in high school, Đukanović joined the Yugoslav Communist League (SKJ), the only political party allowed by law in the Yugoslavian one-party political system. His father Radovan was already an influential member within the party&#x27;s Montenegrin branch, which initially opened many doors for him. By 1986, he was a presidency member of Socialist Youth Alliance&#x27;s (SSO) Montenegrin branch as well as the presidency member of its federal-level parent organization.

As a member of the party&#x27;s various youth bodies he quickly stood out from the pack, earning a nickname &quot;Britva&quot; (&#x27;Straight razor&#x27;) for his direct and forceful rhetoric. Progressing steadily up the party ladder, by 1988 Đukanović became a member of the League&#x27;s highest decision-making body, the Central Committee of the 13th Congress (CK SKJ). It turned out to be the committee&#x27;s last sitting and he became its youngest member ever.

Within days in January 1989, the trio ousted Miljan Radović, the chairman of the Montenegrin Communist League and Božina Ivanović, the Presidents of the Presidency of Montenegro, replacing them with politically obedient confidants Veselin Vukotić and Branko Kostić, respectively. President of the Executive Council Vuko Vukadinović initially survived the coup d&#x27;etat, but within months he was on his way out as well, to be replaced with Radoje Kontić. Đukanović and the others galvanized public opinion within the republic by organizing workers and bussing them to the capital Titograd to protest in front of the Assembly.

===First three terms as Prime Minister of Montenegro (1991–1998)===
The 1990 Montenegrin parliamentary election in early December resulted in a remarkable victory for the League of Communists of Montenegro, who won 83 parliament seats out of the total 125. On 15 February 1991, Đukanović was, somewhat surprisingly, appointed Prime Minister of the first democratically elected government by President Momir Bulatović and with the blessing of Serbian President Slobodan Milošević.

Later in 1991, the Montenegrin Communist League finished its transformation into the Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro (DPS). Đukanović&#x27;s office was secured after the 1992 parliamentary election. Held in December, they were called early due to the disintegration of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the formation of a new state entity, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In the elections, the DPS won an absolute majority, 46 seats out of the total 85.

Đukanović&#x27;s government sent troops to fight seceding Croatia as he opposed the fallout of Yugoslavia caused by Slovenian independence and rebellions in other areas. Đukanović&#x27;s cabinet actively participated in the siege of Dubrovnik from the autumn of 1991 until spring 1992, which resulted in the city suffering heavy structural damage. The surrounding area of Konavli also suffered due to looting raids. During this period Đukanović was one of the most vociferous hawks in the Montenegrin government. Some of his notable statements from this period include a proclamation about &quot;starting to hate chess because of the šahovnica (the chequerboard Croatian coat-of-arms)&quot;.

Đukanović campaigned for the modification of the internal borders of the ex-Yugoslav republics saying: &quot;it&#x27;s time to once and for all establish the firmest border possible with Croatia, but it will be a border a lot more just and realistic than the existing one that was drawn-up by Bolshevik map makers&quot;.

On the domestic political front in 1992, Đukanović became involved in a fierce political clash with Montenegrin artist and antiwar activist Jevrem Brković, which resulted in Brković&#x27;s exile to Croatia, which lasted until 1998. On this occasion, Đukanović stated: &quot;Every smart Montenegrin and every honest man in this land mentions the name of the traitor Jevrem Brković with hatred, who in pure vanity betrayed his people and knowingly spreads anti-Yugoslav speeches across Zagreb, while the Ustašas, again like in 1941, bleed the defenseless Serbian civilians.&quot;

====Carrington&#x27;s proposal and crises in 1992====
The siege of Dubrovnik had enormous consequences for Yugoslavia&#x27;s international standing. The European Economic Community invited Lord Carrington and representatives from Yugoslavia to negotiate the Carrington plan on 19 October 1991, in The Hague. Milošević rejected the proposal of a &quot;loose federation of independent states&quot;, and preferred a centralized Yugoslavia with institutional powers in Belgrade. However, in open defiance to Milošević, Đukanović supported Momir Bulatović&#x27;s agreement on Carrington&#x27;s terms. Yet in a sharp turn, the Narodna Stranka (People&#x27;s Party) called for an emergency session in the Montenegrin parliament, during which Bulatović was accused of treason. Đukanović defended Bulatović in the parliamentary hearing. As Bulatović&#x27;s deputy, Đukanović was invited to negotiations with Milošević and Borisav Jović, after which a clause was added to the Carrington proposal such that a republic could decide to stay in Yugoslavia through a referendum. This resulted in the referendum on 1 March 1992, where voters in Montenegro decided to remain in Yugoslavia.

On 6 August 1992, a local warlord named Milika &quot;Čeko&quot; Dačević occupied police headquarters in Pljevlja after a vehicle used by his personal envoy was seized. In what quickly developed into an emergency, over half of the city&#x27;s police surrendered to Dačević. As a result, Đukanović and Bulatović participated in negotiations with Dobrica Ćosić and Života Panić. One of Dačević&#x27;s accomplices from Čajniče, Duško Kornjača, threatened to kill all of the Muslims in Pljevlja unless Dačević was released. During the meeting, Đukanović asked whether Montenegro could rely on the Army of Yugoslavia to protect the Muslims in Pljevlja. Đukanović and Bulatović ultimately negotiated the disarmament of Dačević&#x27;s men. However, Pljevlja&#x27;s Muslims were subject to multiple incidents up to 1995, particularly in the village of Bukovica where 6 Muslim inhabitants were killed from 1992.

====Split from Yugoslav leadership====
In November 1995, Đukanović and Svetozar Marović visited the Pentagon at the invitation of the United States, where they allegedly offered the Port of Bar as a logistics venue for international peacekeeping in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The meeting at the Pentagon was criticized by Yugoslavia&#x27;s ruling parties at the time. The vice-chairman of the Serbian Radical Party, Milinko Gazdić, claimed that his party had proof that Đukanović and Marović were appealing to the United States for Montenegro&#x27;s eventual secession from Yugoslavia. This did not deter Đukanović from visiting Bill Clinton during his re-election campaign for the 1996 presidential elections in the United States. Some of Đukanović&#x27;s critics claimed that he discussed donating to Clinton&#x27;s campaign that year.

Đukanović&#x27;s communication with Milošević began to deteriorate after a disagreement on how to address the hyperinflation of the Yugoslav dinar in 1993. He then expressed opposition to the Dayton Agreement, which he criticized as being anti-Serb. In what was his most open criticism to date, he publicly blasted Milošević in an interview with the Belgrade weekly &quot;Vreme&quot;, calling him &quot;a man of obsolete political ideas&quot;.

As a war of words erupted with Milošević and his wife Mira, Đukanović wrote a letter of support to the students demonstrating in the 1996–97 protests in Serbia. In a stark contrast, Momir Bulatović refused to attack Milošević. This set the stage for the split between Đukanović and Bulatović, whose partnership had stood remarkably strong up to that point. In spite of the initial disconnect in the DPS leadership, the party overwhelmingly won the 1996 parliamentary election.

On 10 March 1997, after a trip to Washington, D.C. for Montenegro&#x27;s Trade Mission by the initiative of Ratko Knežević, &quot;The Washington Times&quot; published a letter allegedly written by Đukanović to congressmen Nick Rahall and Bruce Vento. Congressmen Rahall and Vento had traveled to Belgrade during the student protests, even appearing in a &quot;Zajedno&quot; opposition meeting. A week after &quot;The Washington Times&quot; publication, &quot;Politika&quot; ran the letter on its front page on 18 March, adding the title: &quot;Milo Đukanovic continues endeavoring to break up FR Yugoslavia and Serbia.&quot; Even though the letter did not actually mention Montenegrin secession, Đukanović denied writing the letter and said it was a forgery.

Another development which further distanced Đukanović from Milošević and Bulatović was his friendship with Vukašin Maraš, with whom he worked in the Automotive Association of Yugoslavia as a secondary job. On 28 July 1994, customs inspector Pavle Zelić informed the Federal Assembly of Yugoslavia that approximately 4–5 million DM was found in boxes in AMSJ&#x27;s office, and that he was not given a chance to count the money. In 1997, &quot;DT Magazin&quot; published a story reporting that the money was a part of a laundering operation involving the importing of cigarettes, whisky, oil, and other scarce goods during the sanctions against Yugoslavia, although most of the report could not be proven with the exception of the fact that the customs had been terminated after an agreement with Montenegrin customs chief Radosav Sekulić, Maraš, Đukanović, and Ana Begović. The AMSJ affair was one of the early points in the breakup of Đukanović&#x27;s affair with Bulatović.

In a more serious affair, in January 1996, Đukanović and Maraš met with MI6 agent Joseph &quot;Joe&quot; Busby in Hotel Yugoslavia in Belgrade, where the idea of Montenegro declaring independence from the state union with Serbia was first mentioned to a foreign representative.

On at least two occasions, in 1996 and in May 1997, Bulatović requested the resignation of Maraš. Instead, Đukanović kept Maraš as a security assistant to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Maraš initiated Operation Ljubović, an overnight raid of the &quot;Ljubović&quot; hotel in Podgorica five days before the 1997 election in which Đukanović ran, incriminating Bulatović&#x27;s campaign of recruiting racketeers. Those arrested were released after the election and relieved of all charges by 2002.

Bulatović&#x27;s actual departure from the DPS took place on 11 July 1997, when the DPS GO (&quot;Glavni odbor&quot;) committee held a closed doors session, selecting Milica Pejanović-Đurišić to replace Bulatović as the party president. The party split had enormous implications, ultimately setting the stage for a confrontation between Đukanović and Bulatović inevitable. This manifested in the 1997 Montenegrin presidential election held in October, which Đukanović won by a thin margin. Clinton envoy Robert Gelbard testified about meeting Đukanović before and after the election in front of the U.S. Senate during the &quot;Prospects for Democracy in Yugoslavia&quot; hearings on 29 July 1999. Initially demanding greater autonomy, Đukanović and his supporters advocated Montenegrin nationalism, which supported independence and a separate Montenegrin identity. The key point for an active change of policy towards independence is the deprivation of Montenegro&#x27;s federal rights by the Milošević federal regime.

===Presidency during the Kosovo War===
Shortly after his inauguration in 1998, Đukanović told Gelbard and some foreign ambassadors about his vision of an independent Montenegro in the &quot;Gorica&quot; villa. Đukanović said that Gelbard and the ambassadors disagreed with him at the time, as they preferred Đukanović to work with the opposition in Belgrade.

On 24 March 1999, NATO began bombing Yugoslavia. During the bombings, Jean-David Levitte claimed that Đukanović asked Bill Clinton for airstrikes to remove Milošević. Curious about Levitte&#x27;s claim, Jacques Chirac called Đukanović to ask if the Clinton requests were true. Đukanović told Chirac that &quot;every bomb that fell in Montenegro threatened to weaken my government.&quot; Chirac subsequently contacted Clinton and arranged limitations on airstrikes in Montenegro. Shortly after the bombings ceased, Đukanović oversaw the implementation of the Deutsche Mark as the new currency in Montenegro, replacing the Yugoslav Dinar.

In a speech in June 2016, Đukanović told an audience that &quot;1999 was a year of critical importance for the choice of an independent Montenegrin way. That meaning the rejection of the self-destructive war with NATO, and secondly, the implementation of the Deutsche Mark a few months later.&quot;

===Transition from Yugoslavia===
In June 2000, he apologised to Croatia for the Montenegrin participation in the siege of Dubrovnik, saying: &quot;On my own behalf and on behalf of all the citizens of Montenegro I want to apologise to all citizens of Croatia, particularly in Konavli and Dubrovnik for all the pain and material damage inflicted by any member of the Montenegrin people.&quot;

After the overthrow of Milošević, Đukanović faced a dilemma as he no longer could use Milošević&#x27;s international standing to argue for Montenegro&#x27;s independence from Yugoslavia. In early 2002, Đukanović was subject to an investigation on international cigarette trafficking by the public prosecutor Giuseppe Scelsi of Bari. Simultaneously, he was involved in negotiations ahead of the Belgrade agreement, and Javier Solana tried persuading him to abstain from independence at least temporarily and that Montenegro should remain in Yugoslavia. After the meetings with Solana, Đukanović signed the Belgrade Agreement on 14 March 2002, in addition to the signatures of Filip Vujanović, Zoran Đinđić, Vojislav Koštunica, and Miroljub Labus. The agreement led to the Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro. It mandated that after a period of three years, Montenegro could hold a referendum on the question of independence. In a bid to prolong his executive powers, Đukanović and Prime Minister Vujanović agreed a job-swap that same year. Đukanović did not run for president in the 2002 election and Vujanović replaced him as the DPS candidate. On 25 November 2002, Đukanović resigned as president, several months before the end of his term, in order to become prime minister again. Vujanović, who had resigned as prime minister at the start of the month to become Speaker of the Montenegrin Parliament, was sworn in as acting president. Đukanović took office as prime minister on 8 January 2003. Vujanović succeeded him as president on 22 May 2003.

The 2006 Montenegrin independence referendum resulted in Montenegro declaring independence from the state union with Serbia. After the declaration of independence, Montenegro&#x27;s Parliament appointed Đukanović as the first Minister of Defense. Đukanović also acted as the president of the National Council for Sustainable Growth, a member of the Council for European Integration, and the president of the Agency for Promotion of Foreign Investment&#x27;s managing board. After independence had been achieved, Đukanović&#x27;s brand of Montenegrin nationalism was no longer useful.

===Resignation and first retirement (2006–2008)===
On 3 October 2006, it was announced that Đukanović was stepping down as prime minister, despite the victory of his Coalition for a European Montenegro in the September 2006 parliamentary election, although he would remain leader of the Democratic Party of Socialists. On 4 October, he endorsed Željko Šturanović as his successor. The choice of Šturanović was considered a compromise between Đukanović and Svetozar Marović, as Đukanović&#x27;s first candidate was Igor Lukšić, the Minister of Finance.

Đukanović formally ceased to be the Prime Minister on 10 November 2006, as the new Government was elected by Parliament of Montenegro. He cited his reasons for stepping down as &quot;being tired of politics&quot;, and wishing to try himself out as a businessman. Đukanović served as a member of Parliament from October 2006 to February 2008. He announced that he might be willing to run in the April 2008 presidential election but eventually decided against it, allowing Vujanović to easily win a second term.

Đukanović headed the proclamation of the new Constitution of Montenegro on 22 October 2007. He received support from almost all DPS municipal boards and committees. Since 2006, Đukanović has opened five private businesses, the latest called Global Montenegro on 25 February 2008, and bought actions in his brother&#x27;s bank, altogether amassing property worth millions of euros. His other four companies are: Universitas, Capital Invest, Primary Invest, and Select Investments.

===Fifth term as prime minister (2008–2010)===

On 20 February 2008, President Vujanović nominated Đukanović as prime minister after Šturanović resigned due to illness. He was accordingly elected as prime minister on 29 February 2008. His party won the 2009 parliamentary election.

From 2008, Đukanović&#x27;s time in the office was marked with advancing EU and NATO integration processes, in which Montenegro mostly went ahead of its neighbors. In the meantime, on 9 October 2008, Montenegro recognized Kosovo&#x27;s independence, becoming the fourth former Yugoslav republic to recognize Kosovo. In the 2009 parliamentary election, Đukanović&#x27;s coalition again won a majority of seats.

Montenegro submitted its application for EU membership in December 2008. On 22 July 2009, EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn handed over the commission&#x27;s Questionnaire to Đukanović in Podgorica and on 9 December 2009, Đukanović delivered to Rehn Montenegro&#x27;s replies to the commission&#x27;s Questionnaire in Brussels. Later that year Montenegro achieved visa liberalisation with the EU. On 1 May 2010, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) entered into force. On 17 December 2010, Montenegro became an official EU candidate. As for Montenegro&#x27;s NATO accession bid, the Allies decided to grant its request to join the Membership Action Plan (MAP) in December 2009.

===Resignation and second retirement (2010–2012)===
After giving indications he would step down once the European Union granted official candidate status to Montenegro&#x27;s membership application, which it did on 17 December 2010, Đukanović resigned as prime minister on 21 December 2010. His party&#x27;s leadership proposed Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Igor Lukšić to lead the new government. Lukšić was confirmed as the new prime minister by the Parliament of Montenegro on 29 December 2010.

Just like when he stepped down last time, Đukanović again retained the DPS party chairmanship. Furthermore, he did not rule out possible future campaigns for public office, including a 2013 run for President of Montenegro or a run for another tenure as prime minister.

===Sixth term as prime minister (2012–2016)===

After the parliamentary election on 14 October 2012, Đukanović informed President Vujanović that he was capable of forming a government. His cabinet was approved by Parliament on 4 December 2012 and Đukanović returned to the office of prime minister on the same day. Together with Viktor Orbán of Hungary, Đukanović was a runner-up to Vladimir Putin for the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project&#x27;s 2014 &quot;Person of the Year in Organized Crime&quot; award, recognizing &quot;the person who does the most to enable and promote organized criminal activity.&quot; He later won the award in 2015.

In 2016, following 2016 Montenegrin parliamentary election, Đukanović retired for a third time and stepped down as prime minister. However, he still remained the leader of DPS.

===Re-election to presidency (2018)=== 

In 2018, it was announced Đukanović would be his party&#x27;s candidate for the 2018 presidential election. It was the second time Đukanović ran for president, the last time having been in the controversial 1997 election. He won the election by a large margin, as opposition parties by and large campaigned for independent candidate Mladen Bojanić.

In 2020, the Freedom House reported that years of increasing state capture, abuse of power, and strongman tactics employed by Đukanović have tipped his country over the edge – for the first time since 2003, Montenegro is no longer categorized as a democracy and became a hybrid regime.
===2020 election===

For the first time in three decades and for the first time since the introduction of multi-party politics in Montenegro, the opposition won more votes than Đukanović&#x27;s ruling DPS. The OSCE and the ODIHR announced in preliminary findings that the 2020 elections were competitive and held in a highly polarized atmosphere especially regarding issues of church and national identity. They further concluded the election date had not been held in accordance with the Constitution, there had been no independent campaign coverage, and the ruling party had profited unjustifiably through widespread abuse of office and state resources.

On 1 September 2020, Đukanović accused Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić and Belgrade-based media of interfering in the internal politics of Montenegro, as well of alleged trying to revive a &quot;Greater Serbia policy&quot;.

=== Economic policy ===
The economic policy of Đukanović was focused on the development of tourism and privatisation. The Tivat shipyard, which was the pride of the Yugoslav navy, was bought by Canadian billionaire Peter Munk after Montenegro&#x27;s independence and converted into a marina for rich foreigners. The Podgorica aluminium smelter – the country&#x27;s only major industry – was sold in 2005 to Russian businessman Oleg Deripaska, who also joined forces with British banker Jacob Rothschild and French oligarch Bernard Arnault in a project to build &quot;a new Monaco&quot; on the shores of the Adriatic. Much of the former military land has been sold to investors, including the children of Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Egyptian billionaire Samih Sawiris, who are building a luxury complex and residences. Criminal networks have also taken advantage of the frenetic development of tourist activities and invested in hotel, casino and leisure park projects. The Splendid Hotel, the most emblematic of these constructions, hosted the lavish weddings of the children of Montenegro&#x27;s most powerful &quot;godfather&quot;, Branislav Mićunović, in the presence of the country&#x27;s elites.

Privatisation has encouraged corruption and enriched those close to the government. Thus, according to Milka Tadić Mijović, president of the Centre for Journalistic Investigation, &quot;those at the top take the biggest share of the corruption. Over the past thirty years, most of the state-owned companies have been privatised in a covert way. Ðukanović and his family have become the richest people in the country. His brother Aleksandar, who was unemployed, controls the capital of the largest financial institution in Montenegro, Prva Banka. His sister Ana, who was a judge during the privatisations, owns one of the biggest law firms. A foreign investor who does not want to have problems will be well advised to use the services of this firm.

This policy has also contributed to reinforcing regional disparities and social inequalities. By 2018, unemployment rose to 36.6% in the northern part of the country, compared to 3.9% in the coastal region, while a quarter of the population lived below the poverty line (2018).

==Controversies==

===Allegations of tobacco smuggling===
In July 2003, the prosecutor&#x27;s office in Naples linked Đukanović with an organised crime racket worth billions of euros. Đukanović called a press conference in Podgorica to deny the allegations as a &quot;loathsome political trick&quot;, aimed at criminalising him and his country. Djukanovic has long been dogged by suspicions that he was involved in tobacco smuggling in Italy.

On 16 April 2003, the Judge for Preliminary Inquiries in Naples rejected the Antimafia Commission&#x27;s request for a warrant for Đukanović&#x27;s arrest, claiming him to be immune from arrest as Prime Minister of Montenegro. The commission had been investigating him for some time, since at least May 2002 and had further requested his arrest as a precautionary measure.

The case was appealed to the Naples Court of Review, which ruled in Đukanović&#x27;s favor. Besides claiming his immunity, he was described as not socially dangerous as well as ignorant that he was committing crimes. The case was then once again appealed, to the Court of Cassation (Corte di Cassazione). On 28 December 2004, this court ruled in favor of the Antimafia Commission. It argued that as Montenegro was not a sovereign state, Đukanović had no diplomatic immunity.

After the independence referendum, Đukanović&#x27;s lawyer, Enrico Tuccillo, said that &quot;The referendum has confirmed the premise of the Prime Minister, Milo Đukanović, about the sovereignty of Montenegro: therefore no doubt can now remain about the immunity, granted to heads of state and of government, which Đukanović enjoyed and enjoys.&quot;

On 27 March 2008, Đukanović made a low-profile visit to the prosecutor&#x27;s office in Bari. He was questioned for six-and-a-half hours and answered about 80 prosecutor&#x27;s questions regarding the accusations against him. On this occasion, Đukanović&#x27;s lawyer said that he had written evidence proving that, at the time when his client submitted the request to give a statement to the Italian prosecution authorities in Bari, he did not occupy any public office whatsoever and, therefore, had no intention of hiding behind immunity in the first place. In April 2009, the prosecution authorities finally dropped the case against Đukanović.

According to court documents, &quot;Montenegro has been a haven for illegal trafficking, where criminals acted with impunity, while the ports of Bar and Kotor were used as logistic bases for motor boats, with protection which was guaranteed by the government.&quot; In December 2009, Francesco Forgione, a former Italian MP who led the Italian Parliament&#x27;s Anti-Mafia Commission from 2006 to 2008, published a book titled &quot;Mafia Export&quot; which cited the Montenegrin mafia and Djukanovic as one of the organisers of international cigarette smuggling between 1994 and 2000. By 2000, the illegal trade was worth several billion dollars annually, according to EU and US agencies.

=== Pandora Papers and malversation ===
Đukanović was featured in the Pandora Papers, a leak of financial documents which were published in early October 2021. It was reported that Đukanović and his son Blažo have been passing money to offshore accounts since 2012, when they established secret asset management agreements behind a network of companies in more than five countries. He and his son established two trusts namely the Victoria Trust and Capecastel Trust. Đukanović admitted that he founded Victoria Trust while he was not a public office holder, that he had no business transactions or open bank accounts, and he claimed that at the end of the year, he transferred the ownership of his trust to Blažo. Đukanović&#x27;s cabinet also stated that this leak is &quot;a part of series of attempts to discredit Đukanović and his family members&quot; and that the trusts only existed &quot;on paper&quot;. Similar to this case, Đukanović previously denied owning businesses in other countries.

Prime Minister Zdravko Krivokapić called for investigation of Đukanović&#x27;s family, while the Foreign Affairs Minister Đorđe Radulović commented on this situation by saying that &quot;Đukanović misused his diplomatic passport when opening his private companies&quot;. Đukanović was also mentioned in a money laundering affair in which Rezart Taçi intervened with Đukanović for a transfer from the &quot;president&#x27;s bank&quot;.

===Smears against journalists===
Đukanović has a track record of attacking critical journalists and media outlets, smearing them as a &quot;media mafia&quot;, claiming they are linked to organised crime, and calling them &quot;rats&quot;, &quot;monsters&quot;, &quot;enemies of the state&quot;.

===Anti-government riots===

In 2015, the investigative journalists&#x27; network OCCRP has named Milo Đukanović &quot;Person of the Year in Organized Crime&quot;. The extent of Đukanović&#x27;s corruption led to street demonstrations and calls for his removal.

Several thousand protesters demanding the resignation of Milo Đukanović and the formation of an interim government marched in the centre of the capital Podgorica on the evening of 25 October 2015. Montenegrin police fired tear gas at opposition supporters, while chasing away the demonstrators with armored vehicles.

===Sandžak===
Muamer Zukorlić stated that Milo Đukanović previously promised that Bosniaks will have their autonomy within Montenegro, but that he went on to break their deal and that therefore his &quot;conscience is not clear&quot;.

===Religion law===

As of December 2019 Montenegrin parliament proclaimed a controversial religion law which &quot;de jure&quot; transfers the ownership of church buildings and estates from the Serbian Orthodox Church in Montenegro to the Montenegrin state. In February 2020 Đukanović called the citizens protesting against the newly proclaimed religion law &quot;a lunatic movement&quot;. The religion law is seen as a major factor in Đukanović and the DPS&#x27; defeat during the 2020 elections.

===Cetinje enthronement crisis===

After it was announced that the enthronement ceremony of Joanikije Mićović of the Serbian Orthodox Church as the Metropolitan of Montenegro and the Littoral would be held in Cetinje, the Church&#x27;s ecclesiastical seat, on 5 September 2021, Đukanović called for the ceremony to be held elsewhere and stated that he would be present at the protest that day unless this was done. On 26 August, he chaired a session of the Defence and Security Council with all top officials of Montenegro attending. The Council session addressed the &quot;security challenges caused by the announced enthronement of the Metropolitan of Montenegro and the Littoral&quot; and urged &quot;all socio-political actors&quot; to keep peace and respect the Constitution and laws. On 4 September, on the eve of the scheduled enthronement, Đukanović arrived in the town of Cetinje along with some of his DPS colleagues. Both the Metropolitan and the Patriarch were flown to Cetinje by helicopter and then led into the monastery by heavily armed riot police holding bulletproof vests over their bodies to protect them, as riot police used tear gas to disperse protesters who hurled rocks and bottles at them and fired guns into the air. No fewer than 20 people were injured and police arrested more than a dozen people, including the security advisor to Đukanović, Veselin Veljović.
Following the enthronement, Đukanović, called it the government&#x27;s Pyrrhic victory and &quot;a great embarrassment of the Serbian Church and the government of Montenegro&quot;; he later elaborated saying that the enthronement came as another one in a series of episodes in the renewed offensive of Serbian nationalism on Montenegro, the Krivokapić administration being &quot;in the service of the Church of Serbia, which is an instrument for implementing the &quot;Greater Serbia project&quot;, the official state policy of Belgrade&quot;. Montenegrin officials accused Đukanović and his party of an &quot;attempted coup&quot; following the riots. On 22 September, the Montenegrin parliament launched an inquiry to the Constitutional Court to rule if Đukanović had violated constitutional articles by backing the protesters. The Constitutional Court ultimately judged him not guilty on 4 February 2022.

<text>Chiac (or &quot;Chiak&quot;, &quot;Chi’aq&quot;), is a patois of Acadian French spoken mostly in southeastern New Brunswick, Canada. Chiac is frequently characterized and distinguished from other forms of Acadian French by its borrowings from English and is thus often mistakenly considered a form of Franglais. 

The word &quot;Chiac&quot; can also sometimes be used to refer to ethnic Acadians of rural southeastern New Brunswick, who are not considered French Canadian historically and ethnically because of their separate and distinctive history. They are considered ethnically as &quot;Chiac-Acadian&quot; or simply &quot;Chiac&quot;.

==Characteristics==
As a major modern variety of Acadian-French, Chiac shares most phonological particularities of the dialect. However, Chiac contains far more English loanwords compared to other Canadian French dialects. Many of its words also have roots in the Eastern Algonquian languages, most notably Mi&#x27;kmaq. Loanwords generally follow French conjugation patterns; &quot;Ej j&#x27;va aller watcher un movie&quot; uses the English-derived loanword &quot;watch&quot; as if it were an &quot;-er&quot; verb. The most common loans are basic lexical features (nouns, adjectives, verb stems), but a few conjunctions and adverbs are borrowed from English (&quot;but, so, anyway&quot;).

==History==
Chiac originated in the community of specific ethnic Acadians, known as &quot;Chiacs, Chiaks or Chi&#x27;aq&quot;, living on the southeast coast of New Brunswick, specifically near the Shediac Bay area.

While some believe that Chiac dates back as far as the 17th or the 18th centuries, others believe it developed in the 20th century, in reaction to the dominance of English-language media in Canada, the lack of French-language primary and secondary education, the increased urbanization of Moncton, and contact with the dominant Anglophone community in the area. The origin of the word &quot;Chiac&quot; is not known; some speculate that it is an alteration of &quot;Shediac&quot; or &quot;Es-ed-ei-ik&quot;.

==Geographic distribution==
Chiac is mostly spoken by native speakers of Acadian French in the southeastern region of New Brunswick. Its speakers are primarily located in the Westmorland County of southeastern New Brunswick and further north along the coast in adjacent Kent County.

Further north along the coast, Acadian French resembling Quebec French is more common as the border with Quebec is approached. To the immediate east, west, and south, fully bilingual speakers of French and English are found, and the regions beyond typically have unilingual Anglophones.

==In culture==
Acadian writers, poets, and musicians such as Lisa LeBlanc, Radio Radio, Fayo, Cayouche, Les Hay Babies, 1755, Antonine Maillet and many others have produced works in Chiac.

Chiac is also featured in Acadieman, a comedy about &quot;The world&#x27;s first Acadian Superhero&quot; by Dano Leblanc.

<doc id="498284" wikidata="Q446179" url="?curid=498284" title="Erma Franklin">
<text>Erma Vernice Franklin (March 13, 1938 – September 7, 2002) was an American gospel and soul singer. Franklin recorded the original version of &quot;Piece of My Heart&quot;, written and produced by Jerry Ragovoy and Bert Berns in 1967, for which she was nominated for a Grammy Award. A cover version of the same song was recorded the following year by Big Brother and the Holding Company, with lead vocals by Janis Joplin. Franklin was the elder sister of American singer/musician Aretha Franklin.

==Biography==
===Early life and family===
Erma Franklin was born in Shelby, Mississippi, United States, the oldest daughter of Barbara (née Siggers) and the Reverend C. L. Franklin. She was raised in Detroit, Michigan, where her father was pastor of the New Bethel Baptist Church. She was raised by both parents until the age of 10, when her parents separated for the final time. Her mother took her eldest sibling, half-brother Vaughn, with her to Buffalo, New York, in 1948. Barbara Siggers-Franklin died four years later, on March 7, 1952, in Buffalo. 

Franklin studied Business at Clark Atlanta University (then named &quot;Clark College&quot;).

===Career===
During her childhood, Erma and her sisters Aretha and Carolyn sang at New Bethel Baptist Church. When Aretha became a recording artist, Erma provided backing vocals and toured with her. Erma sang backup for her sister Aretha on Aretha&#x27;s signature tune &quot;Respect&quot;.

In 1967, Erma Franklin sang the original version of &quot;Piece of My Heart&quot;, which was a top 10 soul hit in the U.S. and rose to number 62 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. The track was co-written and produced by Bert Berns. In the UK, Franklin&#x27;s version was used in a Levi&#x27;s jeans commercial (&quot;Cinderella&quot; AKA &quot;Night and Day&quot;), leading to a resurgence of interest in the song. The single was re-released in the UK in 1992 and peaked on the UK Singles Chart at number 9.

Franklin told an interviewer that when she first heard Janis Joplin&#x27;s version on the radio, she did not recognize it because of the vocal arrangement.

In the mid-1970s, Franklin left the music industry, apart from occasional engagements with her sister. She was one of the special guests on Aretha&#x27;s 1986 Showtime cable television special — filmed at Detroit&#x27;s Music Hall — and also performed on June 28, 1990, at Nelson Mandela&#x27;s rally at Tiger Stadium.

===Personal life and death===
Franklin married Thomas Garrett and gave birth to their two children: Thomas Jr. and Sabrina. For 25 years, Franklin worked for the Boysville Holy Cross Community Center, a Detroit organization that helps homeless and disadvantaged minority children. Franklin died of cancer in Detroit, on September 7, 2002, aged 64. She is interred at Detroit&#x27;s historic Woodlawn Cemetery.

<doc id="498286" wikidata="Q1418632" url="?curid=498286" title="Turkana Boy">
<text>Turkana Boy, also called Nariokotome Boy, is the name given to fossil KNM-WT 15000, a nearly complete skeleton of a &quot;Homo erectus&quot; youth who lived 1.5 to 1.6 million years ago. This specimen is the most complete early hominin skeleton ever found.
It was discovered in 1984 by Kamoya Kimeu on the bank of the Nariokotome River near Lake Turkana in Kenya. 

Estimates of the individual&#x27;s age at death range from 7 to 11 years old.

==Adolescence and maturity==

Although the specimen is largely considered male due to the shape of the pelvis, the sex is ultimately undetermined due to its prepubescent age. Estimates of the age at death depend on whether the maturity stage of the teeth or skeleton is used, and whether that maturity is compared to that of Homo sapiens or to chimpanzees. A key factor is that modern humans have a marked adolescent growth spurt, whereas chimpanzees do not. Initial research assumed a modern human type of growth, but recent evidence from other fossils suggests this was less present in early hominins. This difference affects the estimates of both the age and the likely stature of the specimen as a fully grown adult.

Alan Walker and Richard Leakey in 1993 estimated the boy to have been about 11–12 years old based on known rates of bone maturity. Walker and Leakey (1993) said that dental dating often gives a younger age than a person&#x27;s actual age.

Christopher Dean (M. C. Dean) of University College London, in a 2009 &quot;Nova&quot; special, estimated that the Turkana Boy was 8 years old at death.

==Morphology==
The specimen comprises 108 bones, making it the most complete early human skeleton discovered. The Smithsonian estimates that he was tall and weighed when he died, and may have been close to his adulthood height. In adulthood, Turkana Boy might have reached tall and massed . The pelvis is narrower than in &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, which is most likely for more efficient upright walking. This further indicates a fully terrestrial bipedalism, which is unlike older hominin species that show a combined feature of bipedalism and tree climbing. The Boy was relatively tall, which increased his body surface area that would enhance heat dissipation and prevent heat stress under the hot sun.

The overall KNM-WT 15000 skeleton still had features (such as a low sloping forehead, strong brow ridges, and the absence of a chin) not seen in &quot;H. sapiens&quot;. However, there are significant defining characters, such as bigger brain size (880 cc). The arms and legs are slightly longer indicating effective bipedality. The nose is projecting like those of humans rather than the open flat nose seen in other apes. Body hair may also have been thinner (most likely naked) and possibly with increased sweat glands to hasten cooling. However, despite the appearance shown in the reconstruction of Turkana Boy, it&#x27;s unlikely he actually had dark skin. The emergence of skin pigmentation in the genus Homo dates to about 1.2 million years ago. Genetic analysis suggests that high activity in the melanocortin 1 receptor, which produces dark skin, dates back to approximately that time.

==Vocal capabilities==
The fossil skeleton and other fossil evidence, such as Acheulean stone tools, prompt the majority of scientists to conclude that &quot;Homo erectus&quot; – unlike their more primitive ancestors – became efficient hunters. The social structure would probably have become more complex with a larger brain volume; the Broca&#x27;s area of the brain allows speech and is noted by a slight slant on the cranium. Turkana Boy&#x27;s thoracic vertebrae are narrower than in &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. This would have allowed him less motor control over the thoracic muscles that are used in modern humans to modify respiration to enable the sequencing upon single exhalations of complex vocalisations.

==Disease==
Early studies indicated that Turkana Boy suffered from a congenital disorder, either dwarfism or scoliosis. This was because the rib bones appeared asymmetrical to the spine, at the time attributed to skeletal dysplasia. However, in 2013, a study showed that when the rib bones were rearranged, they became symmetrical against the spine, and that an unusual structure of the vertebrae was characteristic of the early hominins. However, the fossil definitely showed lumbar disc herniation, an injury implicated with the specimen&#x27;s death. The specimen also had a diseased mandible.

==Display==
The fossil is held in the National Museums of Kenya and a cast is on display.

<doc id="498304" wikidata="Q1764144" url="?curid=498304" title="Steiner tree problem">
<text>In combinatorial mathematics, the Steiner tree problem, or minimum Steiner tree problem, named after Jakob Steiner, is an umbrella term for a class of problems in combinatorial optimization. While Steiner tree problems may be formulated in a number of settings, they all require an optimal interconnect for a given set of objects and a predefined objective function. One well-known variant, which is often used synonymously with the term Steiner tree problem, is the Steiner tree problem in graphs. Given an undirected graph with non-negative edge weights and a subset of vertices, usually referred to as terminals, the Steiner tree problem in graphs requires a tree of minimum weight that contains all terminals (but may include additional vertices) and minimizes the total weight of its edges. Further well-known variants are the &quot;Euclidean Steiner tree problem&quot; and the &quot;rectilinear minimum Steiner tree problem&quot;.

The Steiner tree problem in graphs can be seen as a generalization of two other famous combinatorial optimization problems: the (non-negative) shortest path problem and the minimum spanning tree problem. If a Steiner tree problem in graphs contains exactly two terminals, it reduces to finding the shortest path. If, on the other hand, all vertices are terminals, the Steiner tree problem in graphs is equivalent to the minimum spanning tree. However, while both the non-negative shortest path and the minimum spanning tree problem are solvable in polynomial time, no such solution is known for the Steiner tree problem. Its decision variant, asking whether a given input has a tree of weight less than some given threshold, is NP-complete, which implies that the optimization variant, asking for the minimum-weight tree in a given graph, is NP-hard. In fact, the decision variant was among Karp&#x27;s original 21 NP-complete problems. The Steiner tree problem in graphs has applications in circuit layout or network design. However, practical applications usually require variations, giving rise to a multitude of Steiner tree problem variants.

Most versions of the Steiner tree problem are NP-hard, but some restricted cases can be solved in polynomial time. Despite the pessimistic worst-case complexity, several Steiner tree problem variants, including the Steiner tree problem in graphs and the rectilinear Steiner tree problem, can be solved efficiently in practice, even for large-scale real-world problems.

==Euclidean Steiner tree==

The original problem was stated in the form that has become known as the Euclidean Steiner tree problem or geometric Steiner tree problem: Given &quot;N&quot; points in the plane, the goal is to connect them by lines of minimum total length in such a way that any two points may be interconnected by line segments either directly or via other points and line segments.

While the problem is named after Steiner, it has first been posed in 1811 by Joseph Diez Gergonne in the following form: &quot;A number of cities are located at known locations on a plane; the problem is to link them together by a system of canals whose total length is as small as possible&quot;.

It may be shown that the connecting line segments do not intersect each other except at the endpoints and form a tree, hence the name of the problem.

The problem for has long been considered, and quickly extended to the problem of finding a star network with a single hub connecting to all of the &quot;N&quot; given points, of minimum total length.
However, although the full Steiner tree problem was formulated in a letter by Gauss, its first serious treatment was in a 1934 paper written in Czech by Vojtěch Jarník and . This paper was long overlooked, but it already contains &quot;virtually all general properties of Steiner trees&quot; later attributed to other researchers, including the generalization of the problem from the plane to higher dimensions.

For the Euclidean Steiner problem, points added to the graph (Steiner points) must have a degree of three, and the three edges incident to such a point must form three 120 degree angles (see Fermat point). It follows that the maximum number of Steiner points that a Steiner tree can have is , where &quot;N&quot; is the initial number of given points. (all these properties were established already by Gergonne.)

For &quot;N&quot; = 3 there are two possible cases: if the triangle formed by the given points has all angles which are less than 120 degrees, the solution is given by a Steiner point located at the Fermat point; otherwise the solution is given by the two sides of the triangle which meet on the angle with 120 or more degrees.

For general &quot;N&quot;, the Euclidean Steiner tree problem is NP-hard, and hence it is not known whether an optimal solution can be found by using a polynomial-time algorithm. However, there is a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for Euclidean Steiner trees, i.e., a &quot;near-optimal&quot; solution can be found in polynomial time. It is not known whether the Euclidean Steiner tree problem is NP-complete, since membership to the complexity class NP is not known.

==Rectilinear Steiner tree==
The rectilinear Steiner tree problem is a variant of the geometric Steiner tree problem in the plane, in which the Euclidean distance is replaced with the rectilinear distance. The problem arises in the physical design of electronic design automation. In VLSI circuits, wire routing is carried out by wires that are often constrained by design rules to run only in vertical and horizontal directions, so the rectilinear Steiner tree problem can be used to model the routing of nets with more than two terminals.

==Steiner tree in graphs and variants==
Steiner trees have been extensively studied in the context of weighted graphs. The prototype is, arguably, the Steiner tree problem in graphs. Let be an undirected graph with non-negative edge weights c and let be a subset of vertices, called terminals. A Steiner tree is a tree in &quot;G&quot; that spans &quot;S&quot;. There are two versions of the problem: in the optimization problem associated with Steiner trees, the task is to find a minimum-weight Steiner tree; in the decision problem the edge weights are integers and the task is to determine whether a Steiner tree exists whose total weight does not exceed a predefined natural number &quot;k&quot;. The decision problem is one of Karp&#x27;s 21 NP-complete problems; hence the optimization problem is NP-hard. Steiner tree problems in graphs are applied to various problems in research and industry, including multicast routing and bioinformatics.

A special case of this problem is when &quot;G&quot; is a complete graph, each vertex corresponds to a point in a metric space, and the edge weights &quot;w&quot;(&quot;e&quot;) for each &quot;e&quot; ∈ &quot;E&quot; correspond to distances in the space. Put otherwise, the edge weights satisfy the triangle inequality. This variant is known as the metric Steiner tree problem. Given an instance of the (non-metric) Steiner tree problem, we can transform it in polynomial time into an equivalent instance of the metric Steiner tree problem; the transformation preserves the approximation factor.

While the Euclidean version admits a PTAS, it is known that the metric Steiner tree problem is APX-complete, i.e., unless P = NP, it is impossible to achieve approximation ratios that are arbitrarily close to 1 in polynomial time. There is a polynomial-time algorithm that approximates the minimum Steiner tree to within a factor of formula_1;
however, approximating within a factor formula_2 is NP-hard. For the restricted case of Steiner Tree problem with distances 1 and 2, a 1.25-approximation algorithm is known. Karpinski and Alexander Zelikovsky constructed PTAS for the dense instances of Steiner Tree problems.

In a special case of the graph problem, the Steiner tree problem for quasi-bipartite graphs, &quot;S&quot; is required to include at least one endpoint of every edge in &quot;G&quot;.

The Steiner tree problem has also been investigated in higher dimensions and on various surfaces. Algorithms to find the Steiner minimal tree have been found on the sphere, torus, projective plane, wide and narrow cones, and others.

Other generalizations of the Steiner tree problem are the k&quot;-edge-connected Steiner network problem and the k&quot;-vertex-connected Steiner network problem, where the goal is to find a &quot;k&quot;-edge-connected graph or a &quot;k&quot;-vertex-connected graph rather than any connected graph. A further well-studied generalization is the survivable network design problem (SNDP) where the task is to connect each vertex pair with a given number (possibly 0) of edge- or vertex-disjoint paths.

The Steiner problem has also been stated in the general setting of metric spaces and for possibly infinitely many points.

==Approximating the Steiner tree==

The general graph Steiner tree problem can be approximated by computing the minimum spanning tree of the subgraph of the metric closure of the graph induced by the terminal vertices, as first published in 1981 by Kou et al. The metric closure of a graph &quot;G&quot; is the complete graph in which each edge is weighted by the shortest path distance between the nodes in &quot;G&quot;. This algorithm produces a tree whose weight is within a factor of the weight of the optimal Steiner tree where &quot;t&quot; is the number of leaves in the optimal Steiner tree; this can be proven by considering a traveling salesperson tour on the optimal Steiner tree. This approximate solution is computable in O(|S| |V|²) polynomial time by first solving the all-pairs shortest paths problem to compute the metric closure, then by solving the minimum spanning tree problem.

Another popular algorithm to approximate the Steiner tree in graphs was published by Takahashi and Matsuyama in 1980. Their solution incrementally builds up the Steiner tree by starting from an arbitrary vertex, and repeatedly adding the shortest path from the tree to the nearest vertex in &quot;S&quot; that has not yet been added. This algorithm also has O(|&quot;S&quot;| |&quot;V&quot;|²) running time, and produces a tree whose weight is within of optimal.

In 1986, Wu et al. improved dramatically on the running time by avoiding precomputation of the all-pairs shortest paths. Instead, they take a similar approach to Kruskal&#x27;s algorithm for computing a minimum spanning tree, by starting from a forest of |&quot;S&quot;| disjoint trees, and &quot;growing&quot; them simultaneously using a breadth-first search resembling Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm but starting from multiple initial vertices. When the search encounters a vertex that does not belong to the current tree, the two trees are merged into one. This process is repeated until only one tree remains. By using a Heap (data structure) to implement the priority queue and a disjoint-set data structure to track to which tree each visited vertex belongs, this algorithm achieves O(|&quot;E&quot;| log |&quot;V&quot;|) running time, although it does not improve on the cost ratio from Kou et al.

A series of papers provided approximation algorithms for the minimum Steiner tree problem with approximation ratios that improved upon the ratio. This sequence culminated with Robins and Zelikovsky&#x27;s algorithm in 2000 which improved the ratio to 1.55 by iteratively improving upon the minimum cost terminal spanning tree. More recently, however, Byrka et al. proved an formula_3 approximation using a linear programming relaxation and a technique called iterative, randomized rounding.

==Parameterized complexity of Steiner tree==

The general graph Steiner tree problem is known to be fixed-parameter tractable, with the number of terminals as a parameter, by the Dreyfus-Wagner algorithm. The running time of the Dreyfus-Wagner algorithm is formula_4, where is the number of vertices of the graph and is the set of terminals. Faster algorithms exist, running in formula_5 time for any formula_6 or, in the case of small weights, formula_7 time, where is the maximum weight of any edge. A disadvantage of the aforementioned algorithms is that they use exponential space; there exist polynomial-space algorithms running in formula_7 time and formula_9 time.

It is known that the general graph Steiner tree problem does not have a parameterized algorithm running in formula_10 time for any formula_11, where is the number of edges of the optimal Steiner tree, unless the Set cover problem has an algorithm running in formula_12 time for some formula_11, where and are the number of elements and the number of sets, respectively, of the instance of the set cover problem. Furthermore, it is known that the problem does not admit a polynomial kernel unless formula_14, even parameterized by the number of edges of the optimal Steiner tree and if all edge weights are 1.

== Parameterized approximation of Steiner tree ==
While the graph Steiner tree problem does not admit a polynomial kernel unless formula_14 parameterized by the number of terminals, it does admit a polynomial-sized approximate kernelization scheme (PSAKS): for any formula_16 it is possible to compute a polynomial-sized kernel, which looses only a formula_17 factor in the solution quality.

When parameterizing the graph Steiner tree problem by the number of non-terminals (Steiner vertices) in the optimum solution, the problem is W[1]-hard (in contrast to the parameterization by the number of terminals, as mentioned above). At the same time the problem is APX-complete and thus does not admit a PTAS, unless P = NP. However, a parameterized approximation scheme exists, which for any formula_16 computes a formula_19-approximation in formula_20 time. Also a PSAKS exists for this parameterization.

==Steiner ratio==

The Steiner ratio is the supremum of the ratio of the total length of the minimum spanning tree to the minimum Steiner tree for a set of points in the Euclidean plane.

In the Euclidean Steiner tree problem, the Gilbert–Pollak conjecture is that the Steiner ratio is formula_21, the ratio that is achieved by three points in an equilateral triangle with a spanning tree that uses two sides of the triangle and a Steiner tree that connects the points through the centroid of the triangle. Despite earlier claims of a proof, the conjecture is still open. The best widely accepted upper bound for the problem is 1.2134, by .

For the rectilinear Steiner tree problem, the Steiner ratio is exactly formula_22, the ratio that is achieved by four points in a square with a spanning tree that uses three sides of the square and a Steiner tree that connects the points through the center of the square. More precisely, for formula_23 distance the square should be tilted at formula_24 with respect to the coordinate axes, while for formula_25 distance the square should be axis-aligned.

<doc id="498306" wikidata="Q2922711" url="?curid=498306" title="Bowl game">
<text>In North America, a bowl game, or simply bowl, is one of a number of postseason college football games primarily played by NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) teams. For most of its history, the FBS did not use a playoff tournament to determine an annual national champion, instead relying on a vote by sportswriters or coaches. In place of such a playoff, cities developed regional festivals featuring bowls. Prior to 2002, bowl game statistics were not included in players&#x27; career totals. Despite moves to establish a permanent system to determine the FBS national champion on the field such as the Bowl Coalition from 1992 to 1994, the Bowl Alliance from 1995 to 1997, the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) from 1998 to 2013, and the College Football Playoff (CFP) from 2014 through the present some bowls are still held.

Bowls originally featured the very best teams in college football, with strict bowl eligibility requirements for teams to receive invitations to participate. The number grew from 10 team-competitive (as compared to all-star) bowls in 1971 to 43 in 2023. Now the NCAA allows teams with 6–6 records and, since the 2001 season, sometimes even losing 5–6 and 5–7 seasons to participate to fill the slots. More than a quarter of 2023 bowl teams did not have winning records.

The term &quot;bowl&quot; originated from the Rose Bowl stadium, site of the first postseason college football games. The Rose Bowl Stadium, in turn, takes its name and bowl-shaped design from the Yale Bowl, the prototype of many football stadiums in the United States. The term has since become almost synonymous with any major American football event, generally college football, with some significant exceptions. Out of the dozens of modern bowls, two examples are the Egg Bowl, the annual game between the Mississippi State Bulldogs and the Ole Miss Rebels, and the Iron Bowl, the annual game between the Alabama Crimson Tide and the Auburn Tigers. In professional football, the National Football League (NFL) holds the Super Bowl and Pro Bowl.

The term has crossed over into both Canadian football and North American soccer. A notable example is the annual Banjo Bowl between the Winnipeg Blue Bombers and Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League (CFL). In U Sports football, the two national semi-final games are named the Mitchell Bowl and the Uteck Bowl. Many North American soccer championship matches were titled the &#x27;Soccer Bowl&#x27;, including the United States men&#x27;s college soccer championship from 1950 to 1952, the North American Soccer League championship from 1975 to 1984, and the North American Soccer League (II) championship from 2013 to 2017.

==History==

The history of the bowl game began with the 1902 Tournament East-West football game, sponsored by the Tournament of Roses Association between Michigan and Stanford, a game which Michigan won 49–0. The Tournament of Roses eventually sponsored an annual contest starting with the 1916 Tournament East-West Football Game. With the 1923 Rose Bowl it began to be played at the newly completed Rose Bowl stadium, and thus the contest itself became known as the Rose Bowl Game. The name &quot;bowl&quot; to describe the games thus comes from the Rose Bowl stadium. Other cities saw the promotional value for tourism that the Tournament of Roses parade and Rose Bowl carried and began to develop their own regional festivals which included college football games. The label &quot;bowl&quot; was attached to the festival name, even though the games were not always played in bowl-shaped stadiums.

The historic timing of bowl games, around the new year, is the result of two factors—warm climate and ease of travel. The original bowls began in warm climates such as Southern California, Louisiana, Florida, and Texas as a way to promote the area for tourism and business. Since commercial air travel was either non-existent or very limited, the games were scheduled well after the end of the regular season to allow fans to travel to the game site. While modern travel is more convenient, all but 5 of 41 bowl games () are still located in cities below approximately 36° N.

Currently, college football bowl games are played from mid-December to early January. As the number of bowl games has increased, the number of games a team would need to win to be invited to a bowl game has decreased. With a 12-game schedule, a number of teams with only 5 wins have been invited to a bowl game.

, the University of Alabama has played in more bowl games than any other school, with 69 appearances (counting College Football Playoff semifinals and finals). Alabama also holds the record for most bowl victories with 41.

Florida State held the record of consecutive bowl berths at 36 bowl appearances from 1982 to 2017. However, it is not recognized by the NCAA since the NCAA vacated FSU&#x27;s 2006 Emerald Bowl victory over UCLA due to an academic issue.

The Rose Bowl was the only major college bowl game in 1930. By 1940, there were five major college bowl games: the Rose Bowl, the Sugar Bowl (established in 1935), the Cotton Bowl Classic (1937), the Orange Bowl (1935), and the Sun Bowl (1935). By 1950, the number had increased to eight games. This slate of eight bowl games persisted through 1960, but by 1970 the number had increased again, to 11 games. The number continued to increase, to 15 games in 1980, to 19 games in 1990, 25 games in 2000, 35 games in 2010, and 41 games by 2015 (40 games plus two teams playing a second game to determine the National Champion). Up until around the 1950s, the small number of games were played solely on New Year&#x27;s Day, with the only major exception being if the holiday occurred on a Sunday. The tradition of not playing bowl games on Sunday initially started from the Rose Parade and Rose Bowl not being held on Sundays for fear of spooking horses tied at churches, but in later years was done to avoid conflict with NFL games. For the 2016–17 bowl season, the 41 games require a little over three weeks, starting December 17 and ending on January 9. While bowl games were originally exclusive to warm cities thought of as winter vacation destinations, indoor stadiums allow games to be played in colder climates.

The attendance of 106,869 for the 1973 Rose Bowl set the Rose Bowl Stadium record, and an NCAA bowl game attendance record. The Rose Bowl stadium still is the largest capacity stadium and the Rose Bowl game has the highest attendance for postseason bowl games.

In the 1990s, many bowl games began to modify or abandon their traditional names in favor of selling naming rights. While some include the traditional name in some form (e.g. the &quot;Rose Bowl Game presented by Northwestern Mutual&quot;), others have eliminated their traditional name in favor of solely using their corporate sponsor&#x27;s name (e.g. the former &quot;Citrus Bowl&quot; became the &quot;Capital One Bowl&quot; for some time after the financial services company Capital One bought the naming rights; it later reverted to its original name in 2015).

Prior to 1992, most bowls had strict agreements with certain conferences. For example, the Rose Bowl traditionally invited the champions of the Pac-10 and the Big Ten conferences. The Sugar Bowl invited the SEC champion and the Orange Bowl hosted the Big 8 conference champion. These conference tie-ins led to situations where the top-ranked teams in the country could not play each other in a bowl game. The national championship was decided after the bowls, solely by voters for various media polls, who tried to decide which team was best, sometimes based on wins against far inferior teams. As a result, there could be multiple championship titles and no single champion. This led to the term &quot;Mythical National Championship&quot;, which is still used to describe high school national champions, since high school sports have state championship tournaments but not national.

=== Attempts to determine a national champion ===

Because of the vested economic interests entrenched in the various bowl games, the longer regular season compared to lower divisions of college football, and a desire not to have college players play several rounds of playoff games during final exams and winter recess, the Division I Bowl Subdivision long avoided instituting a playoff tournament to determine an annual national champion. Instead, the National Champion in the Football Bowl Subdivision has traditionally been determined by a vote of sports writers and other non-players.

In 1995, the Bowl Alliance, formed by the major bowls and conferences, put in place a system where the two highest ranked teams would play each other, even if they were each affiliated with a different bowl. However, the Pac-10 and Big Ten and the Rose Bowl did not participate. Number 1 vs Number 2 bowl match-ups became far more likely, but were not guaranteed. After the 1997 season, undefeated Michigan was ranked first in both major polls, but as the Big Ten champion, they played eighth-ranked Pac-10 champion Washington State in the Rose Bowl. The top Bowl Alliance team, #2 and unbeaten Nebraska, faced one-loss, third-ranked Tennessee in the Orange Bowl. Michigan won by five on New Year&#x27;s Day and the next night, Nebraska beat Tennessee (playing with an injury-hobbled Peyton Manning) by 25. The AP kept Michigan as the champion, but the Coaches&#x27; Poll jumped Nebraska, playing its final game for retiring coach Tom Osborne, in part because of their more lopsided victory against a more highly ranked opponent.

The following season, the Rose Bowl, Pac-10, and Big Ten joined the other bowls and major conferences to form the Bowl Championship Series. The BCS attempted to match the two highest ranked teams in the country based upon calculations from various sources, including statistics and coaches&#x27; polls, with one of the four bowl games in the consortium, the Rose Bowl, Fiesta Bowl, Sugar Bowl, and Orange Bowl, rotating the role of &quot;national championship.&quot; In 2006, a dedicated BCS Championship Game rotated among the BCS venues. The BCS Championship Game, while separate from the four main bowls, was still rotated among their sites. The Coaches Poll was contractually obligated to recognize the winner of the game as its national champion. However, other polls such as the AP Poll may deviate and pick a different team, particularly in years when multiple teams were equally worthy of reaching the game. In 2003, for instance, one-loss LSU won the BCS National Championship over Oklahoma, but the AP crowned one-loss USC champion after its Rose Bowl win.

For the 2014–15 season, the BCS was replaced by a new consortium, the College Football Playoff (CFP). The new system used a four-team single-elimination tournament, with its participants selected and seeded by a committee; the semi-final games were rotated between pairs of the six member bowls yearly, branded as the &quot;New Year&#x27;s Six&quot;: the Rose Bowl and Sugar Bowl, then Orange Bowl and Cotton Bowl Classic, and then the Fiesta Bowl and Peach Bowl. The winners from the two semi-final bowls advanced to the College Football Playoff National Championship, played at a neutral site determined using bids. Members of the New Year&#x27;s Six that were not hosting semi-final games reverted to their traditional tie-ins. The CFP then expanded to a 12-team format for the 2024–25 season, with members of the New Year&#x27;s Six now either hosting the quarter-finals and semi-finals on a rotating basis. Like its predecessors, and in contrast to the officially sanctioned NCAA tournaments at lower levels, the College Football Playoff is not officially recognized as an NCAA championship.

==Professional bowl games==

The National Football League also used the name &quot;bowl&quot; for some of its playoff games. While the NFL Championship was not named a Bowl initially, the league instituted the Pro Bowl as the name of its all-star game in 1951, and introduced the Bert Bell Benefit Bowl (also known as the Playoff Bowl) as a matchup of the two second-place teams in each division from 1960 to 1969.

When the professional football AFL–NFL merger occurred in 1970, the AFL–NFL World Championship Game became the NFL&#x27;s championship and is now known as the Super Bowl, as it has been named since 1968 (the name was coined by Lamar Hunt after watching his daughter play with a super ball). There has also been the American Bowl, a preseason match held overseas, and various one-time games informally nicknamed bowls, such as the Bounty Bowl, Ice Bowl, Snow Bowl, Freezer Bowl, Fog Bowl, Mud Bowl, Tuna Bowl, Manning Bowl, Harbaugh Bowl, Kelce Bowl and the proposed (but ultimately canceled) China Bowl.

As a result, other professional football leagues used or use the name Bowl for their championships, such as the World Football League (World Bowl), NFL Europe (World Bowl), Arena Football League (ArenaBowl), Indoor Football League (United Bowl), Great Lakes Indoor Football League (Great Lakes Bowl) and American Indoor Football Association (AIFA Championship Bowl). The Canadian Football League nicknames one of their rivalries as the Banjo Bowl and another QEW Bowl (also known as the Battle of Ontario); like most Canadian sports leagues, however, the CFL&#x27;s championship is instead known as a cup (in the CFL&#x27;s case, the Grey Cup).

==Bowl games today==
===Postseason bowls===

At the NCAA top level of football, the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS, previously known as Division I-A from 1978 through 2005), teams must earn the right to be bowl eligible, generally by winning at least six games and by not having a losing record at the end of their regular season schedule. They can then be invited to a bowl game based on their finishing placement in their conference, and tie-ins that their conference has to various bowl games. Alternately, a bowl-eligible team may receive an at-large invitation to a bowl game, independent of conference tie-ins.

Bowls are popular among coaching staffs because the NCAA allows college teams going to bowl games extra weeks of practice they would otherwise not have, and bowl games pay the teams for their participation. Teams belonging to a conference split the money with their conference mates. For the 2010 season, 70 of the 120 Division I FBS teams played in a bowl game.

An association of the bowl games themselves, independent of the NCAA, has existed since at least 1989. Originally known as the Football Bowl Association, the organization announced a rebranding as &quot;Bowl Season&quot; in October 2020. It aims to work &quot;with all existing bowls to promote the benefits of the entire bowl system&quot;.

NCAA bowl season generally lasts from mid-December to early January with the first week of bowl games usually featuring teams from the Group of Five conferences (American Athletic Conference, Conference-USA, Mid-American Conference, Mountain West Conference, Sun Belt Conference and FBS Independents with the exception of Notre Dame) with bowl games featuring mainly teams from the Power Four conferences (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, SEC and FBS Independent Notre Dame) coming in the second week.

===Non-FBS bowl games===
At lower levels, teams play in playoff tournaments with a national championship game at a neutral site, making invitational bowl games less popular than in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS).

The Division I Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) features only one bowl game, the Celebration Bowl, formerly the Heritage Bowl. It invites the top teams from historically black colleges and universities, one from the SWAC and one from the MEAC. The SWAC has historically had a longer regular season that extends past Thanksgiving weekend, preventing its teams from participating in the FCS tournament and more closely mirroring the FBS.

At the Division II level there are currently four postseason bowls for teams that did not qualify for the DII playoffs: the Live United Texarkana Bowl, Heritage Bowl, America&#x27;s Crossroads Bowl, and Florida Beach Bowl. All four of the Division II bowls are played on the first weekend of December.

At the NCAA Division III level, all bowls that are currently played are recent developments (starting in 2008 or later). For the 2017 season, 10 bowls were scheduled to be played by teams that did not qualify for the DIII playoffs: a six-bowl series organized for ECAC teams, a two-bowl series organized between the Centennial Conference and MAC, the New York State Bowl (between Liberty League and Empire 8), and the New England Bowl (between the ECFC, MSCAC, CCC and NEWMAC).

Prior to 2008, the ECAC also held the ECAC Bowl (1989–2003) for Division I-AA and the North Atlantic Bowl (2007), the last of which is now integrated into the conference&#x27;s six-bowl series. Additionally, the Division III championship game has historically been known as the Amos Alonzo Stagg Bowl.

Outside the NCAA, the Victory Bowl is sponsored by the NCCAA, a group that does not restrict its membership to either NCAA or NAIA. The NAIA does not have any invitational postseason bowl games. Starting with the now defunct Wheat Bowl, the NAIA found it easier to schedule bowl games early in the season rather than late—this allowed the schedule to accommodate large college bowl games and high school sports; one such extant example is the College Fanz First Down Classic, a pre-season bowl game for NAIA teams.

In Canadian football, the Mitchell Bowl and Uteck Bowl are held as the semi-final games for Canada&#x27;s university football national championship. The bowl winners go on to play each other for the Vanier Cup. The Mitchell Bowl is always hosted by either the Canada West or Ontario conference champion, while the Uteck Bowl is always hosted by either the Atlantic Canada or Quebec conference champion.

===All-star bowl games===
Following team-competitive bowl games, a series of all-star bowl games round out the postseason schedule. These games seek to showcase the best departing college players. Such college all-star games include the East–West Shrine Bowl, the Senior Bowl, and the Hula Bowl. Other all-star games, now defunct, include the North–South Shrine Game, and NFLPA Collegiate Bowl.

===Special games and rivalries===
There have also been pre-season and regular-season games carrying the &quot;bowl&quot; moniker, including the Mirage Bowl, the Glasnost Bowl and the Canadian Football League&#x27;s Banjo Bowl.

Examples of bowl games that are not part of the postseason include the Iron Bowl and the Egg Bowl.

Recently, the term &quot;bowl&quot; has been added to other games that have some special note or sub-plot to the actual game, in college or the National Football League. An example of this is the Bowden Bowl given to games where Florida State and Clemson were coached by the father-son duo of Bobby Bowden and Tommy Bowden, respectively.

Games between two very poor teams and/or of a very poor standard of play have been jokingly referred to as the &quot;Toilet Bowl&quot;.

Other, related, national championship games in Germany include the German Flag Bowl (est. 2000), German Junior Flag Bowl (1999) and a German Indoor Flag Bowl (2000).

They typically contain hota (&quot;Canna indica&quot;) seeds inside them. Before the hota seeds are added, the hosho is boiled in salted water and the inside is scraped out with a corncob, newspaper plug, or woven wire. Removing the debris inside the hosho allows for a more sharp and percussive tone.

The hosho are used to accompany Shona music, especially mbira music. Hosho plays several key roles in Zimbabwean music. Oliver Mtukudzi insists that it’s what keeps musicians on the same page. Hosho doesn&#x27;t add thickness to mbira performance all due to its dense sound quality. It is also a good start in learning Mbira. This is because it helps beginners to observe patterns and learn from mbira masters by looking over their shoulders. Moreover, hosho has acted as a way for women to join mbira performance.

Hosho make a rattling sound that western ears may be unaccustomed to hearing. However, this accompaniment is essential when playing mbira and/or marimba music. So essential, in fact, that extra vibrating elements such as mirlitons (buzzing membranes made from spider webs) are attached to the resonating tubes of marimbas and machachara (miniature Hosho made from seashells or bottle caps) are attached to the mbira and its deze. Mbiras and marimbas from Africa; and even other instruments, such as drums, will have some kind of rattles associated with their use.

Many hosho styles emphasize the second pulse of the triplet. This creates an off beat articulation that follows the bass notes of the mbira&#x27;s &quot;kutsihnira&quot; part.

From a western perspective the hosho are seen as accompanying instruments to mbira, when in actuality they are seen as the lead instruments by the mbira players.
Hosho goes well too with Makwa. Makwa clapping is a very common aspect of musical practices but very often underlooked or rather not discussed as much. Whistling is one other feature that’s usually distinctive, common but rarely talked about. Makwa plays significant roles in Zimbabwe Ngoma and mbira ensembles. It adds that sharpness that’s usually heard over other instruments. This adds that the timbral element to many musical forms giving room for alterations hence more musical creations

A smaller version of the hosho is made of a wild orange called a damba, tied together with sticks and filled with hota seeds or pebbles.

Other related percussion instruments from Zimbabwe include the magavhu (leg rattle) and ngoma (drum).

One of Zimbabwes most respected Hosho players is Tendai Kazuru from Mbira deNharira.

<text>Lake Turkana () is a saline lake in the Kenyan Rift Valley, in northern Kenya, with its far northern end crossing into Ethiopia. It is the world&#x27;s largest permanent desert lake and the world&#x27;s largest alkaline lake. By volume it is the world&#x27;s fourth-largest salt lake after the Caspian Sea, Issyk-Kul, and Lake Van (passing the shrinking South Aral Sea), and among all lakes it ranks 24th.

Lake Turkana is now threatened by the construction of the Gilgel Gibe III Dam in Ethiopia due to the damming of the Omo river which supplies most of the lake&#x27;s water.

Although the lake commonly has been—and to some degree still is—used for drinking water, its salinity (slightly brackish) and very high levels of fluoride (much higher than in fluoridated water) generally make it unsuitable for drinking directly, and it has also been a source of diseases spread by contaminated water. Increasingly, communities on the lake&#x27;s shores rely on underground springs for drinking water. The same characteristics that make it unsuitable for drinking, limit its use in irrigation. The climate is hot and very dry.

The rocks of the surrounding area are predominantly volcanic. Central Island is an active volcano, emitting vapour. Outcrops and rocky shores are found on the east and south shores of the lake, while dunes, spits and flats are on the west and north, at a lower elevation.

On-shore and off-shore winds can be extremely strong, as the lake warms and cools more slowly than the land. Sudden, violent storms are frequent. Three rivers (the Omo, Turkwel and Kerio) flow into the lake, but lacking outflow, its only water loss is by evaporation. Lake volume and dimensions vary. For example, its level fell by between 1975 and 1993. Despite the lack of outflow, in ecology it is often regarded as a part of—or at least associated with—the Nile basin because of its prehistoric connection to this system and the similarities in their aquatic faunas.

Due to local temperatures (its surface water typically is , and the mean air temperature of the region generally is similar or slightly higher), aridity and geographic inaccessibility, the lake retains its wild character. Nile crocodiles are found in great abundance on the shore flats. The rocky shores are home to scorpions and carpet vipers. The lake is rich in fish and fishing is very important to the local economy, but this is threatened by falling water levels and overfishing.

Lake Turkana National Parks are now listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Sibiloi National Park lies on the lake&#x27;s eastern shore, while Central Island National Park and South Island National Park lie in the lake. Both are known for their Nile crocodiles.

An abundance of hominid fossils have been discovered in the area surrounding Lake Turkana.

The area still sees few visitors, being two days&#x27; drive from Nairobi. The lake is also an imaginary boundary of the Rendille and Borana and Oromo to the Turkana land. The area is primarily clay-based and is more alkaline than seawater.

== Toponymy ==

After the independence of Kenya, the president, Mzee Jomo Kenyatta, renamed it in 1975 after the Turkana, the predominant tribe there. The Turkana refer to the lake as &quot;Anam Ka&#x27;alakol&quot;, meaning &quot;the sea of many fish&quot;. It is from the name Ka&#x27;alakol that Kalokol, a town on the western shore of Lake Turkana, east of Lodwar, derives its name. The previous indigenous Turkana name for Lake Turkana was &quot;Anam a Cheper&quot;. Natives who live around Lake Turkana include the Turkana, Rendille, Gabbra, Daasanach, Hamar Koke, Karo, Nyagatom, Mursi, Surma, and Molo peoples. For the location of many of these peoples, refer to the dialect map in the article.

=== Lake Rudolf ===
The lake was originally named Lake Rudolf (in honour of Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria) by Count Sámuel Teleki de Szék and his second-in-command Lieutenant Ludwig Ritter Von Höhnel, a Hungarian and an Austrian, on 6 March 1888. They were the first Europeans to have recorded visiting the lake after a long safari across East Africa. The lake kept its European name during the colonial period of British East Africa. However, the existence of the lake and its shape and location were well known in Europe long before Teleki conceived of his visit.

=== Jade Sea ===
At some unknown time, the lake acquired an alternative name as the &quot;Jade Sea&quot; from its turquoise colour seen approaching from a distance. The colour comes from algae that rise to the surface in calm weather. This is likely also a European name.

=== Basso Narok ===
J. W. Gregory reported in &quot;The Geographical Journal&quot; of 1894 that it was called &quot;Basso Narok&quot;, meaning &quot;Black Lake&quot; in the Samburu language. Likewise, the nearby Ethiopian Lake Chew Bahir is called &quot;Basso Naibor&quot; in Samburu, meaning &quot;White Lake&quot;. The Samburu are among the dominant tribes in the lake Turkana region when the explorers came.&quot; What the native form of this phrase was, what it might mean, and in which language is not clear.

== Biology ==

=== Biomes ===

The major biomes are the lake itself, which is an aquatic biome, and the surrounding region, which is classified as desert and xeric shrubland. The Chalbi Desert is east of the lake. During moister times, a dry grassland appears, featuring &quot;Aristida adcensionis&quot; and &quot;A. mutabilis&quot;. During drier times, the grass disappears. The shrublands contain dwarf shrubs, such as &quot;Duosperma eremophilum&quot; and &quot;Indigofera spinosa&quot;. Near the lake are doum palms.

=== Plankton ===

Both phytoplankton and zooplankton are found in the lake. Of the former, cyanobacteria are represented by &quot;Microcystis aeruginosa&quot; and microalgae by &quot;Botryococcus braunii&quot;. Also present are &quot;Anabaenopsis arnoldii&quot;, &quot;Planctonema lauterbornii&quot;, &quot;Oocystis gigas&quot;, &quot;Sphaerocystis schroeteri&quot;, and some others. The zooplankton includes copepods, cladocerans and protozoans.

=== Fish ===

Compared to other large African lakes, Turkana has relatively few fish species. The lake holds about 50 fish species, including 12 endemics: the cichlids &quot;Haplochromis macconneli&quot;, &quot;H. rudolfianus&quot;, &quot;H. turkanae&quot; and &quot;Hemichromis exsul&quot;, the barb &quot;Enteromius turkanae&quot;, the catfish &quot;Chrysichthys turkana&quot;, the robber tetras &quot;Brycinus ferox&quot; and &quot;B. minutus&quot;, the Rudolf lates &quot;Lates longispinis&quot;, the lampeyes &quot;Lacustricola jeanneli&quot; and &quot;Micropanchax rudolfianus&quot;, and the cyprinid &quot;Neobola stellae&quot;. Non-endemics include species such as Nile tilapia, mango tilapia, bichirs, the elephantfish &quot;Mormyrus kannume&quot;, African arowana, African knifefish, &quot;Distichodus niloticus&quot;, the Nile perch and numerous others. During the early Holocene, the water level of the lake was higher, and it overflowed into the Nile River, allowing fish and crocodiles access. Consequently, the non-endemic fishes in the lake are mainly riverine species of Nilotic origin. Some of the non-endemics do not breed in the lake, but migrate up the Omo River and other affluents to breed. The lake is heavily fished.

=== Birds ===

The Lake Turkana region is home to hundreds of species of birds native to Kenya. The East African Rift System also serves as a flyway for migrating birds, bringing in hundreds more. The birds are essentially supported by plankton masses in the lake, which also feed the fish.

Some birds more common to Turkana are the little stint, the wood sandpiper, and the common sandpiper. The African skimmer (&quot;Rhyncops flavirostris&quot;) nests in the banks of Central Island. The white-breasted cormorant (&quot;Phalacrocorax lucidus&quot;) ranges over the lake, as do many other waterbirds. The greater flamingo wades in its shallows. Heuglin&#x27;s bustard (&quot;Neotis heuglinii&quot;) is found in the east of the lake region.

=== Reptiles ===

The lake formerly contained Africa&#x27;s largest population of Nile crocodiles: 14,000, as estimated in a 1968 study by Alistair Graham.

The lake also has a large population of large water turtles, particularly in the area of Central Island. The Turkana mud turtle is endemic to the lake.

=== Mammals ===

Over the dry grasslands ranges a frail population of grazing mammals and predators. The grazers are chiefly Grevy&#x27;s zebra, Burchell&#x27;s zebra, the beisa oryx, Grant&#x27;s gazelle, the topi and the reticulated giraffe. They are hunted by the lion and the cheetah. Elephants and the black rhinoceroses are no longer seen, although Teleki reported seeing (and shooting) many. Closer to the dust is the cushioned gerbil (&quot;Gerbillus pulvinatus&quot;).

== Geology ==

Lake Turkana is an East African Rift feature. A rift is a weak place in the Earth&#x27;s crust due to the separation of two tectonic plates, often accompanied by a graben, or trough, in which lake water can collect. The rift began when East Africa, impelled by currents in the mantle, began separating from the rest of Africa, moving to the northeast. Currently, the graben is 320 km wide in the north of the lake, 170 km in the south. This rift is one of two, and is called the Great or Eastern Rift. There is another to the west, the Western Rift.

Lake Turkana is a unique feature of the East African landscape. Besides being a permanent desert lake, it is the only lake that retains the waters originating from two separate catchment areas of the Nile. The Lake Turkana drainage basin draws its waters mainly from Kenya Highlands and Ethiopian Highlands.

The basement rocks of the region have been dated by two analytical determinations to 522 and 510 million years ago (mya). No rift was in the offing at that time. A rift is signalled by volcanic activity through the weakened crust. The oldest volcanic activity of the region occurred in the Nabwal Hills northeast of Turkana and is dated to 34.8 mya in the late Eocene.

The visible tectonic features of the region result from extensive extrusions of basalt over the Turkana-Omo basin in the window 4.18–3.99 mya. These are called the Gombe Group Basalts. They are subdivided into the Mursi Basalts and the Gombi Basalts.

The two latter basalts are identified as the outcrops forming the rocky mountains and badlands around the lake. In the Omo portion of the basin, of the Mursi Basalts, the Mursi Formation is on the west side of the Omo, the Nkalabong on the Omo, and the Usno and Shungura east of the Omo. Probably the best known of the formations are the Koobi Fora on the east side of Turkana and the Nachukui on the west.

Short-term fluctuations in lake level combined with periodic volcanic ash spewings over the region have resulted in a fortuitous layering of the ground cover over the basal rocks. These horizons can be dated more precisely by chemical analysis of the tuff. As this region is believed to have been an evolutionary nest of hominins, the dates are important for generating a diachronic array of fossils, both hominoid and nonhominoid—that is, both &quot;ape (includes hominins)&quot; and &quot;non-ape&quot;. Many thousands have been excavated.

Terraces representing ancient shores are visible in the Turkana Basin. The highest is 100 m above the surface of the lake (only approximate, as the lake level fluctuates), which occurred about 9500 years ago, at the end of the Pleistocene as part of the African humid period. It is generally theorised that Turkana was part of the upper Nile system at that time, connecting to Lake Baringo at the southern end and the White Nile in the north, and that volcanic land adjustments severed the connection. Such a hypothesis explains the Nile species in the lake, such as the crocodiles and the Nile perch. High water levels also occurred approximately 9000, 6000 and 5000 years ago, each of which were followed by drops in lake level of more than 40m in less than 200 years. It is thought that changes in the position of the Congo Air Boundary affected the ability of moisture from the Atlantic Ocean to reach eastern Africa, which had a profound influence on the level of Lake Turkana and adjacent water bodies.

The archaeoastronomical site Namoratunga, which has been dated to circa 300 BCE, is located near Lake Turkana.

== Anthropology ==

Hominin fossils of some of the earliest human ancestors have been found in the Turkana Basin. Lake Turkana is considered the cradle of human life because of the diverse hominid species found living millions of years apart in this desert landscape. These fossils have facilitated human understanding of the dynamic human evolution process and imply that they descended from more than one common ancestor, diverging into multiple lineages.

The changing forest environment forced the early humans to adapt to a more open grassland that increased their exposure to threatening predators. Volcanic ash and drier climates were ideal for preserving these human fossils but it also caused the lake to shrink or disappear at times. 

In a dry riverbed, the Lomekwi 3 site recovered primitive hammers, anvils, and cutting tools. However, the emergence of Acheulean technology no longer assumes that tool use was a distinguishing factor among &quot;Homo&quot; species as Australopithecus afarensis were also using simple tools prior to the appearance of the genus &quot;Homo&quot;, over 3.3 million years ago.

&quot;Australopithecus anamensis&quot; fossils discovered by Meave Leakey in 1994 date to around 4 million years ago, setting the beginning date of bipedalism back half a million years. Richard Leakey has led numerous anthropological expeditions in the area which have led to many important discoveries of hominin remains.

The two-million-year-old skull 1470 was found in 1972. It was originally thought to be &quot;Homo habilis&quot;, but the scientific name &quot;Homo rudolfensis&quot;, derived from the old name of this lake (Rudolf) was proposed in 1986 by V. P. Alexeev. In 1984, the Turkana Boy, a nearly complete skeleton of a &quot;Homo ergaster&quot; juvenile, was discovered by Kamoya Kimeu. More recently, Meave Leakey discovered a 3.5 million-year-old skull there, designated &quot;Kenyanthropus platyops&quot; (&quot;the flat-faced man of Kenya&quot;).

Marta Mirazón Lahr discovered early evidence of human warfare at the site of Nataruk, located near the shore of an ancient and larger Lake Turkana, and where numerous human skeletons showing major traumatic injuries to the head, neck, ribs, knees and hands are argued to be evidence of inter-group conflict between nomadic hunter-gatherers 10,000 years ago. With over 230 individuals found at the Koobi Fora site along the western shore, and scattered &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; skeletons with bone marks along the eastern shore at the Nataruk Site, this region provides considerable insight to the way these early humans thrived and survived the inconsistent climate along the lake shore and beyond. 

&quot;Homo erectus&quot; is the closest of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;″ ancestors and contended to be the first hominin to cross the Levantine corridor out of Africa into Europe and Asia 1.8 million years ago. 

Many language groups are represented in the area around Lake Turkana, which is evidence for numerous migrations of diverse people over thousands of years. The current language groups include at least three separate subgroups of the Nilotic (Nilo-Saharan) and Cushitic (Afro-Asiatic) language families, which have further subdivided into more than 12 languages surrounding the lake today. In the early Holocene (during the Holocene Climatic Optimum), lake levels were high and fishing and foraging were the primary subsistence economies. This was mostly supplanted by animal-based agriculture by 5000 years ago, when the lake level was in a period of rapid fluctuation. During the later Holocene, human responses to climatic changes included intensive fishing when lake level was high and a shift to cattle herding when the level dropped. Megalithic graves are found widely distributed on the lake shores and appear to correspond to the period when domesticated animals were first introduced to the region about 5000 years ago, while later, the dead were buried in small grave cairns. People who live in the region today commonly practice mixed subsistence, switching between hunting, fishing and animal herding based on what is feasible in a given year. However, the construction of infrastructure like Christian missionary stations, energy extraction (wind, oil) and NGO aid distribution points have made the region more connected to and dependent on outside resources for subsistence. Traditional modes of subsistence like pastoralism and fishing are now supplemented by the cash-based economy.

== Wind power ==
The Lake Turkana Wind Power consortium (LTWP) plans to provide 310 MW of power to Kenya&#x27;s national electricity grid by tapping the unique wind conditions around the lake. The plan calls for 365 wind turbines, each with a nameplate capacity of 850 kilowatts. As of October 2016 155 turbines had been installed with completion expected in 2017. It will be the largest wind power project in Africa.

Full commercial operation achieved in March 2019. 100% Capacity Factor (meaning full 310 MW generated) achieved in March 2021.

==Dams==
The Gibe III dam is already under construction by Ethiopia along its Omo River, with general recognition that it will cause a major decrease in river flow downstream and a serious reduction of inflow to Kenya&#x27;s Lake Turkana, which receives 90 per cent of its waters from the river. According to the ARWG [citation needed] report, these changes will destroy the survival means of at least 200,000 pastoralists, flood-dependent agriculturalists and fishers along the Omo River and 300,000 pastoralists and fishers around the shores of Lake Turkana – plunging the region&#x27;s ethnic groups into cross-border violent conflict reaching well into South Sudan, as starvation confronts all of them.

The report offers a devastating look at a deeply flawed development process fueled by the special interests of global finance and African governments. In the process, it identifies major overlooked or otherwise minimised risks, not the least of which is a U.S. Geological Survey estimation of a high risk for a magnitude 7 or 8 earthquake in the Gibe III dam region.

===Impact on Lake Turkana===
The magnitude of the impact that the dam and possible irrigation projects induced by the dam will have on the water level of Lake Turkana is controversial. A hydrological study conducted for the African Development Bank in November 2010 concluded that the filling of the dam will reduce the lake&#x27;s water level by two metres, if no irrigation will be undertaken. Irrigation would cause a further drop in the lake level.[29]

Friends of Lake Turkana, a Kenyan organisation representing indigenous groups in northwestern Kenya whose livelihoods are linked to Lake Turkana, had previously estimated that the dam could reduce the level of Lake Turkana by up to 10 meter affecting up to 300,000 people.[30] This could cause the brackish water to increase in salinity to where it may no longer be drinkable by the indigenous groups around the lake. Currently, the salinity of the water is about 2332 mg/L, and it is estimated that a 10-meter decrease in the water level of Lake Turkana could cause the salinity to rise to 3397 mg/L.[20] Raising salinity could also drastically reduce the number of fish in the lake, which the people around Lake Turkana depend on for sustenance and their livelihoods. According to critics, this &quot;will condemn the lake to a not-so-slow death.&quot;[9]

According to dam proponents, the impact on Lake Turkana will be limited to the temporary reduction in flows during the filling of the reservoir. Various sources state that the filling could take between one and three wet seasons.[9][26] The total storage volume of the reservoir of Gibe III dam will be between 11.75 and 14 billion cubic meter, depending on sources. According to the firm that builds the dam this would reduce the water level in the lake by &quot;less than 50 cm per year for three years&quot; and that salinity &quot;will not change in any way&quot;.[26]

According to the International Lake Environment Committee, 90% of Lake Turkana&#x27;s water is delivered by the Omo River on which the Dam would be built.[31] With no outlet, Lake Turkana loses 2.3 meters of water every year to evaporation, and its level is sensitive to climatic and seasonal fluctuations. For purposes of comparison, the historic level of Lake Turkana declined from a high of 20m above today&#x27;s level in the 1890s to the same level as today in the 1940s and 1950s. Then it increased again gradually by 7 metres to reach a peak around 1980, and subsequently decreased again.[31]

The Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) summary of the project did not assess the impact of the dam on the water level and water quality of Lake Turkana.[32] The director of Kenya&#x27;s Water Services Regulatory Board, John Nyaoro, argued that the dam would have no negative impact on Lake Turkana.[33]

A Kenya Government report in 2021 estimated that the surface area of Lake Turkana had increased by 10% between 2010 and 2020.

<text>Philip Danforth Armour Sr. (16 May 1832 – 6 January 1901) was an American meatpacking industrialist who founded the Chicago-based firm of Armour &amp; Company. Born on a farm in upstate New York, he initially gained financial success when he made $8,000 during the California gold rush from 1852 to 1856. He later opened a wholesale soap business in Cincinnati, then moved it to Milwaukee. 

During the American Civil War, Armour capitalized on the opportunity to sell meat to the United States Army, making millions in the process. In 1875, he moved his base to Chicago. His innovations included bringing live hogs to the metropolis for slaughter, inventing an assembly line system for the dis-assembly of hogs, canning the product, economy of scale and efficiency in detail. He systematically utilized waste products, boasting that he made use of &quot;everything but the squeal&quot;. The introduction of refrigerated rail cars opened a national market for him and competitors such as Gustavus Swift. Armour expanded into banking and speculation on the futures market for pork and wheat by 1900, his plants employed 15,000 workers; his own wealth was in the range of $50 million (~$ in ). The urgent Army need for meat during the Spanish–American War of 1898 led to highly publicized complaints about &quot;embalmed beef.&quot; Armour retired from business in 1899, and devoted himself to philanthropy in the Chicago area, including low-cost housing for industrial workers, and the major institution of higher education, the Armour Institute of Technology (now part of Illinois Institute of Technology).

Armour was born in Stockbridge, New York, to Danforth Armour and Juliana Ann Brooks. He was one of eight children and grew up on his family&#x27;s farm. Armour was descended from colonial settlers of Scottish and English origin, with his surname originating in Scotland. He was educated at Cazenovia Academy in New York until the school expelled him for taking a ride in a buggy. Among his first jobs was that of Driver on upstate New York&#x27;s Chenango Canal which ran through Madison County at that time and would have been a busy thoroughfare. At the age of 19, Armour left New York with about 30 other people for California, joining the great California gold rush. They walked most of the way from New York to California. Before the journey, Armour &quot;had received several hundred dollars from his parents,&quot; making him, for the most part, &quot;the financier of the party,&quot; according to biographer Edward N. Wentworth. In California, Armour eventually started his own business, employing out-of-work miners to construct sluices, which controlled the waters that flowed through the mined rivers. In only a few years, Armour had turned his business into a profitable enterprise, earning himself about $8,000 by the time he had turned 24.

With his sizable fortune in hand, Armour then moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, starting a wholesale grocery business. In Milwaukee, Armour formed business partnerships with Frederick Miles in the grain business in 1859. He worked with Miles for three years before he partnered with John Plankinton in the meatpacking industry, creating the company Plankinton, Armour &amp; Company. Philip helped Plankinton start up &quot;a new plant on the Menominee River so that the firm could handle government pork contracts.&quot; They experienced prompt success through the distribution of sought after meats, produce, and grains to westward-moving settlers and fortune-seekers. It was also during this period when Armour married Malvina Belle Ogden in 1862. Armour demonstrated his uncanny ability as a young businessman by taking advantage of changing meat prices during and after the Civil War. According to Deborah S. Ing, author of Philip Armour&#x27;s biography in the American National Biography Online, &quot;the most important business coup of Armour&#x27;s early career occurred near the end of the Civil War when he predicted heavy Confederate losses and thus the dropping of pork prices…he made contracts with buyers at $40 per barrel before prices plummeted to $18 when the war ended in a Union victory. This deal netted him a profit of $22 per barrel or a total of $1 million to $2 million.&quot; Armour&#x27;s savvy decision elevated the status of Plankinton, Armour &amp; Co., allowing the firm to expand into other cities. 

Later with his brother, Herman, he again entered the grain business and built several meat packing plants in the Menomonee River Valley. After individually prospering in three different regions, Philip, Herman and Joseph reconvened in 1867 to form the flagship Armour &amp; Company in Chicago, which packed hogs exclusively for the first eight years of its existence. The company which soon became the world&#x27;s largest food processing and chemical manufacturing enterprise, headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. Armour &amp; Co. was the first company to produce canned meat and also one of the first to employ an &quot;assembly-line&quot; technique in its factories.

In the winter of 1879–1880, Armour traveled to Wyandotte County, Kansas, after becoming disturbed to hear that emancipated blacks from the deep South had arrived there unprepared for the midwestern winter. Armour returned to Chicago and raised funds for the stranded Exodusters, reporting, &quot;I talked with a great many of them and was surprised at their intelligence. I asked them where they thought they were going. They said only North to escape persecution. . . . They had no idea that they were going to a land of plenty or idleness, but simply to a land of freedom.&quot; In all, Armour raised $1,200 from Chicago businesses ($200 from his own Armour and Company, $200 from the unrelated Armour, Dole &amp; Co. (owned by George Armour), $200 from Field, Leiter &amp; Co. (later known as Marshall Field &amp; Company), $100 from N.K. Fairbank &amp; Co. (owned by N.K. Fairbank), and $50 each from ten others).

In order to get his meat products to market Armour followed the lead of rival Gustavus Swift when he established the Armour Refrigerator Line in 1883. Armour&#x27;s endeavor soon became the largest private refrigerator car fleet in the U.S., which by 1900 listed over 12,000 units on its roster, all built in Armour&#x27;s own car plant. The General American Transportation Corporation would assume ownership of the line in 1932.

In the late 1880s, he was solicited by Peter Demens to invest in his Orange Belt Railroad running across central Florida, and one of the depots was named in his honor. In 1900, while terminally ill he wintered in Southern California, probably due to his association with Demens, and his namesake son Philip Jr. came to visit, caught pneumonia and suddenly died on January 29. The next winter Philip Sr. was too ill to travel to California, and died in Chicago. 

His meatpacking plants pioneered new principles of large-scale organization and refrigeration to the industry. Armour implemented the assembly line in order to speed up production, was one of the first to reduce the tremendous waste when slaughtering of hogs by refining and selling waste products. His biggest concern was ensuring that every part of the animal was made useful, &quot;thus, out of meatpacking came auxiliary industries such as glue, fertilizer, margarine, lard, [and] gelatin.&quot; Armour famously declared that he made use of &quot;everything but the squeal&quot;. By developing these profitable manufacturing innovations and expanding the reach of his company, Armour &amp; Co. became one of the largest meatpacking firms in America by the 1890s. It earned an estimated $110 million in 1893 and established Armour&#x27;s position as one of the great industrialists of the Gilded Age.

==Labor issues==
Since the end of the Civil War, labor activists in Chicago had been fighting for powerful labor unions that would negotiate the eight-hour day and higher wages. At a time when the living wage for a five-member family was $15.40 a week, the workers at Armour &amp; Company only earned about $9.50 a week. After Armour&#x27;s butchers had publicly called for better pay and improved job security in the early 1880s, Armour kicked out the union workers and blacklisted the leaders of the strike. In the weeks before the Haymarket bombing of May 4, 1886, Armour had even encouraged his colleagues to equip a militia to suppress future labor actions. In the book &quot;Death in the Haymarket&quot;, historian James Green notes that the supplies included &quot;a good machine gun, to be used by them in case of trouble&quot;. Over the course of his career, Armour had broken three major strikes that had directly concerned his factories, blacklisting all of the union leaders involved. &quot;The New York Times&quot; emphasized in its reporting how greatly Armour &quot;cares for his labor&quot; without any sense of irony. &quot;Although his workers lived and worked in squalid conditions,&quot; the PBS series &quot;American Experience&quot; reports, &quot;Armour was known as a philanthropist&quot;.

==Embalmed beef scandal==
The company&#x27;s reputation was tarnished further in 1898, when Major General Nelson A. Miles, Commanding General of the United States Army, claimed that the major meatpacking companies of Chicago—including Armour&#x27;s—were sending chemically-treated meat to soldiers fighting in the Spanish–American War. An investigation followed, but no definite verdict was reached. Skeptics would claim that Armour simply bribed the panel while Armour would defend his innocence for the rest of his life. Even so, the damage was done. The evidence that was found provided fodder for the muckraking novel by Upton Sinclair entitled &quot;The Jungle&quot;, which was published in February 1906 and became a bestseller. Armour&#x27;s reputation never recovered from the 1898–1899 scandal.

==Death and legacy==

In 1893, Armour donated $1 million to found the Armour Institute of Technology (a privately endowed coeducational college), which merged with the Lewis Institute to become Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) in 1940. Both Armour Square Park, which is adjacent to both IIT and Rate Field as well as the surrounding neighborhood of Armour Square on Chicago&#x27;s South Side are named in honor of him. The Armour brothers Joseph and Philip founded the Armour Mission, an educational and healthcare center. In 1900 his son, Philip D. Armour Jr., died.
Armour died at age 69 on January 6, 1901, of pneumonia at his Chicago home. He was survived by his wife, Malvina Belle Ogden whom he had married in 1862, and by his son, J. Ogden Armour. His family call him &quot;P. D.&quot;

The town of Armour, South Dakota, was named for him in 1885, and the town of Armourdale, Kansas, (now the district of Armourdale in Kansas City, Kansas) in 1881. To acknowledge his investment in the Orange Belt Railroad, in 1889 a depot was named &quot;Armour&quot; near St. Petersburg, Florida. Streets in Cudahy, Wisconsin, (a Milwaukee suburb founded by meat packing magnate Patrick Cudahy) as well as Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, where the Armour family had a summer estate, also bear his name. Philip D. Armour Elementary School in South Chicago, and streets of north Redondo Beach, California, are named after prominent American businessmen of the industrial revolution. Armour Lane is one of them. 

The Union Pacific Railroad uses Armour Yellow as one of its official colors, the same hue used by Armour refrigerated cars in the early 20th century.

<doc id="498332" wikidata="Q715450" url="?curid=498332" title="North Korean abductions of Japanese citizens">
<text>Abductions of Japanese citizens from Japan by agents of the North Korean government took place during a period of six years from 1977 to 1983. Although only 17 Japanese citizens (eight men and nine women) are officially recognized by the Japanese government as having been abducted, there may have been hundreds of others. The North Korean government has officially admitted to abducting 13 Japanese citizens.

There are testimonies that many non-Japanese citizens, including eight citizens from European countries and one from the Middle East, have been abducted by North Korea.

==Background==
In the 1970s, a number of Japanese citizens disappeared from coastal areas in Japan. The people who had disappeared were average Japanese people who were opportunistically abducted by operatives lying in wait. Although North Korean agents were suspected, the opinion that North Korea had nothing to do with the disappearances was widely held. Most of the missing were in their 20s; the youngest, Megumi Yokota, was 13 when she disappeared in November 1977, from the Japanese west coast city of Niigata.

Some of the victims were abducted to teach Japanese language and culture at North Korean spy schools. Older victims were also abducted for the purpose of obtaining their identities. It is speculated that Japanese women were abducted to have them become wives to a group of North Korea–based Japanese terrorists belonging to the Yodo-go terrorist group after a 1970 Japan Airlines hijacking and that some may have been abducted because they happened to witness activities of North Korean agents in Japan, which may explain Yokota&#x27;s abduction at such a young age.

For a long time, these abductions were denied by North Korea and its sympathizers (including Chongryon and the Japan Socialist Party) and were often considered a conspiracy theory. Despite pressure from Japanese parent groups, the Japanese government took no action.

There are claims that this issue has been used by Japanese nationalists, including former Japanese Prime Ministers Yoshihide Suga and the late Shinzō Abe, to &quot;further militarize&quot;, push for revision of the Constitution to reduce constitutional limits on the army, revise the Basic Education Law, and pursue other political goals. Such claims have been criticized by Kyoko Nakayama, the special adviser in Tokyo to the Japanese prime minister on the abduction issue, who said &quot;This is about rescuing our citizens [from ongoing abduction]... They deserve all possible support to regain their freedom and dignity. It is our duty to retrieve them.&quot; (See Norimitsu Onishi.)

== Talks between North Korea and Japan in 2002 and aftermath ==
On September 17, 2002, then Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi visited North Korea to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Il for the First Japan–North Korea Summit, which eventually resulted in the Japan–North Korea Pyongyang Declaration. To facilitate normalization of relations with Japan, Kim admitted North Korea had abducted at least 13 Japanese citizens and issued an oral apology:
During the meeting, North Korea also provided death certificates for eight people whom the North claimed were dead, but admitted in 2004 that these certificates had been hastily drafted shortly beforehand. For several reasons, the Japanese government and NGOs question whether or not those eight people are actually dead.

According to Russian scholar Andrei Lankov, the North Korean disclosure was a strategic mistake. What was intended to be a gesture of honesty was met with outrage within both the Japanese government and the general public, as the allegations that were previously thought of as conspiracy theories had proved to be true. Japan retaliated by trying to isolate North Korea by cutting trade and other exchanges. In Lankov&#x27;s view, the North Korean government will &quot;probably think twice&quot; before making similar confessions in the future. The ordeal was also unnecessary because North Korea had ample supply of willing Japanese speakers through Chongryon.

=== Return of five victims ===
Later, North Korea allowed the five victims that it said were alive to return to Japan, on the condition that they return later to North Korea. The victims (whose identities were confirmed by DNA testing, dental records, and fingerprint analysis) were returned to Japan on October 15, 2002. The five repatriated victims were Fukie Chimura (née Hamamoto), Yasushi Chimura, Yukiko Hasuike (née Okudo), Kaoru Hasuike, and Hitomi Soga, the wife of Charles Robert Jenkins, who remained in North Korea. However, the Japanese Government, listening to the pleas of the general public and the abductees&#x27; families, told North Korea that the victims would not be returning. North Korea claimed that this was a violation of the agreement and refused to continue further talks.

=== Children/spouses of returned victims reunited ===
The three children of the Chimura family and the two children of the Hasuike family, who were born in North Korea, were allowed to rejoin their parents in Japan following the second visit of Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi to Pyongyang on May 22, 2004. They returned to Japan on July 18, 2004. According to their parents and other relatives, all five children expressed a desire to remain in Japan and live as Japanese citizens.

Hitomi Soga was able to reunite with her husband and children, but through a more circuitous route. Her husband, Charles Robert Jenkins, was a defector from the United States Army who fled to North Korea where he eventually met and married Soga. Fearing a court-martial, Jenkins and their two daughters initially met Soga in Jakarta, Indonesia, on July 9, 2004, eventually returning together to Japan on July 18. Two months later, on September 11, 2004, Jenkins reported to the army base at Camp Zama, Japan, served a light sentence after being found guilty of desertion and aiding the enemy, and was dishonorably discharged from the army. Charles then lived on Sado Island in Japan with his family until his death in 2017.

=== Further evidence and investigations ===
In November 2004, North Korea returned the cremated remains of two people, stating that they were those of Megumi Yokota and Kaoru Matsuki, who the North claimed died after being abducted. Subsequent Japanese DNA testing determined that those remains belonged to neither of the two. However, the independent scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot; published an article highly critical of this testing, which was performed at Teikyo University by Tomio Yoshii, a relatively junior faculty member (lecturer) in a forensics department, without a professor being present. Yoshii later acknowledged that he had no previous experience in the analysis of cremated specimens. This mistake—intentional or not—further strained relations between Japan and North Korea.

In an interview with Japanese police, Yasushi Chimura and Kaoru Hasuike, two of the abductees allowed to return to Japan in 2002, identified two of their abductors as Sin Gwang-su (known also as Sin Kwang-su) and a man known as &quot;Pak&quot;. The National Police Agency has requested the arrests of Sin Gwang-su and Choi Sung-chol for the abductions of Japanese nationals. Sin reportedly told police in South Korea that he had been personally ordered by Kim Jong Il to carry out abductions.

In March 2006, Osaka police raided six facilities, including the North Korean Chamber of Commerce, in an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the June 1980 disappearance of one of the alleged abductees, Tadaaki Hara. All six facilities were linked to Chongryon, a pro-North Korean residents&#x27; organization in Japan. A police spokesman said that the head of Chongryon at the time was suspected of cooperating in his abduction.

===Situation since 2004===

Badge worn in support of returning victims to Japan (often worn as [[lapel pin]] [[[:ja:ブルーリボン運動 (北朝鮮拉致問題)|ja]]])
The North Korean government continues to claim that there were only 13 abductees and that the issue has been resolved with the return of the five victims. However, the Japanese government claims that the issue has not been properly resolved and that all evidence provided by North Korea is forged.

By May 2004, five abductee victims and their families (10 in total) returned from North Korea. However, a number of alleged victims are still missing. Although then Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroyuki Hosoda commented on December 24, 2004, that &quot;unless honest measures are taken swiftly, we cannot help but impose strict measures&quot;, hinting at possible sanctions.

The victims&#x27; support group has also looked to the United Nations (UN) for help. UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in a speech given in the Japanese Diet on February 24, 2004, mentioned the issue, sympathized with the victims and their families, and expressed wishes for a complete settlement. Later that year, the United States Congress passed the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004. The victims&#x27; families and their supporters expressed gratitude toward the United States government and president.

In 2004, the Japanese Diet passed two laws designed to restrict trade with North Korea. On November 2, 2005, the United Kingdom led 45 countries, including the United States and Japan, in submitting a proposal condemning North Korea to the United Nations. On December 16, this proposal was passed by the UN General Assembly with 88 supporting, 21 opposing, and 60 abstention votes. In particular, China and Russia opposed this proposal and the South Korean government abstained. The proposal condemned North Korea for &quot;systematic humanitarian violations&quot; and mentioned the abduction issue, the existence of concentration camps and the abuse against North Korean defectors sent back to North Korea. United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice expressed support for the abduction issue. On April 27, 2006, Sakie Yokota, mother of abductee Megumi Yokota, testified in a United States House of Representatives subcommittee about the abduction issue. The next day, Yokota met with US President George W. Bush to ask for the United States&#x27; help in resolving the abduction issue. The President called the meeting &quot;one of the most moving meetings&quot; in his presidency and questioned North Korea&#x27;s actions. On June 13, 2006, the North Korean Human Rights Bill, calling for sanctions to be placed on North Korea, was tabled in the Japanese Diet.

In October 2011, South Korean intelligence agencies reported they believed dozens of South Korean and Japanese abduction victims were moved to Wonhwa-ri in South Pyongan Province; this group may have included Megumi Yokota, Yaeko Taguchi, and Tadaaki Hara.

Following Kim Jong Il&#x27;s death in December 2011, former abductee Kaoru Hasuike expressed a wish for the Japanese government to &quot;carefully analyze the state of affairs in North Korea and do its best to secure the safety of abductees still left there&quot;. The abduction issue has become very central to Japan&#x27;s North Korea policy and Japan&#x27;s participation in the Six-Party Talks. Most importantly, &quot;Tokyo has kept conditioning its provision of economic incentives, widely deemed to be crucial to a comprehensive and lasting solution of the nuclear conundrum, on the establishment of diplomatic relations with North Korea—a development which in turn hinges on a resolution of the abduction issue.&quot;

On August 29, 2013, families of victims including the Yokotas testified at a UN team hearing. In May 2014, after talks with Japan, North Korea agreed to probe the abductees issue. On 4 July 2014, Japan eased several of its sanctions on North Korea after talks between the two countries. Pyongyang agreed to reopen investigations about the abduction cases. In October 2014, a Japanese delegation visited North Korea.

In March 2015, after talks with North Korea failed to produce results, Japan extended its sanctions for another 24 months. These include barring North Korean ships from entering Japanese ports and limits on trade with the country. These sanctions have expired in March 2017.

In February 2019, it was announced by Japanese government sources that Minoru Tanaka, a restaurant worker believed to have been kidnapped in or around 1978, has been living in Pyongyang with his wife and children since then. North Korean authorities had previously denied any involvement with Tanaka&#x27;s disappearance, and no immediate reaction was available.

&quot;Mainichi Shimbun&quot; reported in 2019 on May 20 that a man from Chiba that was listed as likely abducted by North Korea was found in Japan and no connections were to North Korea involving his disappearance in 1992. The number of suspected kidnappings of Japanese citizens by North Korea dropped to 882 people.

&quot;Japan Times&quot; reported in 2019 on August 7 that a man listed as likely abducted by North Korea was found in Japan and no connections were to North Korea involving his disappearance in 1974. The number of suspected kidnapping of Japanese by North Korea dropped to 881 people.

&quot;Tokyo Reporter&quot; has reported in 2019 on September 8 that the Japanese police confirmed Takeshi Saito is dead when the body was found in Japan in April 2018. The number of suspected kidnapping of Japanese by North Korea is at 880.

According to the National Police, as of September 10, 2019, 879 Japanese citizens were suspected kidnapped by North Korea. The number was reduced to 871 on July 12, 2022

Following the resignation of long-serving Prime Minister Shinzō Abe in 2020 for health reasons, his replacement, Yoshihide Suga, claimed he wanted &#x27;to make a breakthrough&#x27; regarding the situation, and went on to discuss the possibility of a meeting between himself and Kim Jong Un to discuss the issue. However, Suga resigned in 2021 before he could meet with Kim Jong Un. Suga&#x27;s successor, Fumio Kishida, did not comment on the abduction issue.

North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui restated Pyongyang&#x27;s policy of rejecting any contact with Japan on March 29, 2024, and declared that holding discussions with Tokyo is of minimal importance to her country. Minister Choe criticized Japan&#x27;s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida&#x27;s announcement on March 28, 2024, that Japan would continue addressing issues regarding North Korea, including the abduction of Japanese nationals in the past.

==List of victims==
Seventeen nationals are officially recognized by the Japanese government as victims of the abduction issue. The sixteenth, Minoru Tanaka, was added to the list on April 27, 2005, following discovery of evidence supporting the assertion that he was abducted. The seventeenth victim, Kyoko Matsumoto, was added to the list in November 2006.

==Other abductions by North Korea==
North Korea has also perpetrated abductions in South Korea, which has the highest number of citizens abducted by the North. The number of South Korean abductees is put at 3,800 in total, with an estimated 485 or 486 abductees still in North Korean captivity.

In December 1969, a Korean Air Lines YS-11 was hijacked by a North Korean agent soon after taking off from Gangneung. The pilot was forced to fly to and land in North Korea. The crew, aircraft, and seven of the passengers have yet to be returned. North Korea claims that this was an act of asylum by the pilot, but it is considered to be another case of abduction.

In the 1970s, many women were abducted from Lebanon and in July 1977 there was an attempt to abduct a Korean pianist/actress and her husband from Yugoslavia.

There are testimonies that several others have been abducted, including two Chinese (Macau), two Dutch, three French, three Italians, a Jordanian, four Malaysians, and a Singaporean. There is also some evidence that suggests that a missing American citizen, David Sneddon, was kidnapped while traveling in China in 2004 by North Korean agents and brought to somewhere just outside Pyongyang to be the personal English language tutor for Kim Jong Un.

The UN Commission on Human Rights investigated the abductees issue, as part of the Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea. Abductee Hitomi Soga has also testified that citizens of Romania and Thailand were among the abductees. The family of an abduction victim from Thailand has been identified and the Japanese government is working with the Thai government to resolve the issue.

According to the Committee for Democratization of North Korea (CDNK), North Korean agents are also believed to have abducted roughly 200 citizens of the People&#x27;s Republic of China from the late 1990s onward, mostly ethnic Koreans from frontier towns in northeast China who provided aid to North Korean defectors. The kidnapped victims were then imprisoned in North Korea. The Chinese government reportedly has not officially requested the repatriation of any of these victims, a policy the CDNK describes as aimed at preserving harmony in the countries&#x27; bilateral relations.

==Controversies==
There is controversy about whether the remains of Megumi Yokota returned by North Korea to Japan are genuine or not. The Japanese government tested them and claims they are not. But in February 2005, the British scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot; published an article in which the Teikyo University DNA analyst who did the tests, Tomio Yoshii, acknowledged that the results could be inconclusive. Likewise, the technique used is reportedly no longer used professionally in the United States due to the ease with which contamination can occur. According to the Japanese Foreign Ministry, the remains are not available for further testing.

Another controversy arose when, in May 2012, Japan strongly protested when a top American diplomat linked the issue of North Korean abductions of Japanese citizens with the issue of abduction to Japan by Japanese parents away from non-Japanese parents.

==In fiction==
The protagonist of the novel &quot;The Orphan Master&#x27;s Son&quot; spends several years during the early part of the book helping with and organizing abductions of Japanese citizens to North Korea. These abductions and some of their victims remain an important secondary theme for the rest of the book.

<text>Fernando Francisco González Ciuffardi (; born 29 July 1980) is a Chilean former professional tennis player. During his career, he reached at least the quarterfinals of all four major tournaments. He contested his only major final at the 2007 Australian Open, losing to top-seeded Roger Federer. González is the fourth man in history to have won an Olympic tennis medal in every color, with gold in doubles and bronze in singles at Athens 2004, and silver in singles at Beijing 2008. The gold medal that González won partnering Nicolás Massú at the 2004 Olympics in men&#x27;s doubles was Chile&#x27;s first-ever Olympic gold medal. During his career, González defeated many top players, including Lleyton Hewitt, Andre Agassi, Federer (all while they held the top spot), Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, Andy Roddick, Juan Carlos Ferrero, Carlos Moyá, Gustavo Kuerten, Marat Safin, Pete Sampras, and Andy Murray. González qualified twice for the year-end Masters Cup event and was runner-up at two Masters Series tournaments. González was known for having one of the strongest forehands on the tour. In Spanish he is nicknamed &quot;El Bombardero de La Reina&quot; (&quot;The Bomber from La Reina&quot;) and &quot;Mano de Piedra&quot; (&quot;Hand of Stone&quot;).

==Tennis career==
===Early years===

At the age of four, González split his time playing both football and tennis. His father, an amateur tennis player, was able to persuade his son to choose tennis over football. González began playing tennis at the age of six and moved with his family to La Reina, in eastern Santiago, where he practiced with his coach Claudio González (no relation) at &quot;Club La Reina&quot; three times a week.

In 1988, when he was eight years old, González and his father spent a month and a half in the United States, training and participating in tennis championships. In 1992, his entire family moved to the U.S. for four years. They settled in Miami, where González honed his skills at the Patricio Apey Academy.

González played his first junior match in August 1995 at the age of 15, at a grade 5 tournament in El Salvador. As a junior, he won the US Open boys&#x27; doubles (with compatriot Nicolás Massú) in 1997, and the French Open singles (defeating a young Juan Carlos Ferrero in the final) and doubles (with Venezuelan José de Armas) in 1998. That year, at the age of 17, he made his Davis Cup debut in Chile&#x27;s tie against Argentina, losing in four sets to Franco Squillari. He won his first Davis Cup tie in a doubles rubber, partnering with Massú. González reached as high as No. 4 in the world in singles and No. 2 in doubles.

González achieved success at the Futures level in 1998. In the three Futures events held in Chile that year, he reached two semifinals and defeated Italian Enzo Artoni in the final in Santiago.

===1999–2004===
González became a professional in 1999. Early in the year, he played mainly at the Futures level. He reached his first Challenger quarterfinal in Edinburgh and played his first ATP tournament in Washington, where he defeated Ivan Ljubičić in the first round before losing to Marc Rosset.

González won his first ATP Tour title in May 2000 when he defeated Massú at the U.S. Men&#x27;s Clay Court Championships final in Orlando, Florida. It was the first all-Chilean ATP final since Jaime Fillol defeated Ricardo Acuña in the 1982 Itaparica final.

In January 2001, González played at the Australian Open for the first time, losing in the first round to Guillermo Coria in four sets. In May, he made his debut at Roland Garros&#x27;s main singles draw, reaching the second round. He continued to play Challengers and smaller ATP events throughout the year, with notable results including a final at the Montevideo Challenger (losing to David Nalbandian), and semifinals at Zagreb and Lima.

In February 2002, González won his second career ATP title in Viña del Mar by defeating Nicolás Lapentti in the final. Later that year, he won his third title in Palermo, Italy, and reached the semifinals at the Cincinnati Masters (defeating seeded Tim Henman and Andy Roddick en route), and the quarterfinals at the US Open. In September, he surpassed former No. 1 player Marcelo Ríos as the top Chilean in the singles rankings and was one of the most improved players on the ATP Tour, jumping 123 positions in the ATP singles rankings.

In May 2003, González reached the quarterfinals of Hamburg and the French Open. In between, he won the World Team Cup for Chile, winning all his singles and doubles matches. Later that year, he reached the finals of Washington and Metz and made the Stuttgart semifinals. In doubles, he and partner Tommy Robredo reached the semifinals in Miami.

In February 2004, González repeated his Viña del Mar title by defeating Gustavo Kuerten in the final. He also retained the World Team Cup with Chile. In August, at the Olympic Games in Athens, he and doubles partner Massú gave their country its first-ever Olympic gold medal when they defeated Nicolas Kiefer and Rainer Schüttler of Germany to win the men&#x27;s doubles tournament. He also won a bronze medal in the men&#x27;s singles. González had to play the bronze medal match against Taylor Dent and the doubles final on the same day. Additionally, he saved match points in both games, most notably four match points in the doubles final in the fourth-set tiebreak.

===2005===
González began the season by taking the title in Auckland, New Zealand, which was his first hard court title. In April, he won his first ATP doubles tournament (and second after the Olympics) in Valencia (clay) with doubles partner Martín Rodríguez. After reaching the quarterfinals at Wimbledon in June, he went on to win the ATP tournament in Amersfoort (clay), Netherlands, in the following month. He further proved his all-court versatility by winning the indoors-carpet singles title at Basel and also won the doubles title in the same tournament with partner Agustín Calleri. His results in 2005 were good enough for him to attend the year-end Masters Cup in Shanghai first as a reserve and then as a player after the withdrawal of Andre Agassi following his first match. González became the first Chilean to win a Masters match when he beat Mariano Puerta and missed out on making the semifinal—and finishing the year as No. 11—after losing to Gastón Gaudio in a match in which he had three match points.

===2006===
In April, González became the third Chilean (after Ríos and Massú) to break into the top 10 singles ranking. In May, he reached No. 10 in the world after winning a quarterfinal match at the Monte-Carlo Masters, shortly after parting ways with longtime coach Horacio de la Peña. He was then replaced by Larry Stefanki. After reaching his first Masters Series singles final in Madrid (losing to Roger Federer in straight sets) in October, he ascended to world No. 7. He finished the year ranked No. 10.

===2007===
In January, González reached the Australian Open singles final, becoming the first Chilean to have reached the quarterfinals in all four Grand Slam tournaments ,and the fourth Chilean (third male) to reach a Grand Slam final. En route to the final, he defeated Evgeny Korolev, Juan Martín del Potro, Lleyton Hewitt, James Blake, world No. 2 Rafael Nadal, and Tommy Haas. He lost to world No. 1, Roger Federer, in (relatively close) straight sets. On 29 January, he jumped to No. 5, his best career singles ranking, only five points behind No. 4. In May, he became the first Chilean to reach the finals of the Rome Masters since Ríos won the title in 1998. At the US Open, González was upset by Teymuraz Gabashvili in a five-set thriller. From July to August, González went on a five-match losing streak, which ended in September when he captured the China Open tournament title in Beijing. In November, he became the first Chilean since Ríos in 1998 to directly qualify for the Tennis Masters Cup. In his opening match, he staged a huge upset by beating top-ranked Federer for the first time in eleven encounters. He then lost to Andy Roddick and Nikolay Davydenko, finishing last in his group. He ended the season at No. 7, his highest year-end ranking to date.

===2008===
At the Australian Open in January, González failed to defend all his points from the previous year, causing him to fall from No. 7 to No. 24 in the ATP singles rankings. However, he bounced back the following week, winning his home event at Viña del Mar for the third time and rising to No. 16. In May, he won his tenth ATP title at the BMW Open in Munich. The following month, he reached the quarterfinals of the French Open for the second time, losing to top seed Roger Federer in four sets.

In August, González represented Chile at the Beijing Olympics in both singles and doubles events, where he was his country&#x27;s standard-bearer at the opening ceremony. As in Athens 2004, he partnered with Massú in doubles, but was unable to defend his gold, exiting in the first round. In singles, he improved his Olympic record, clinching a silver medal after beating James Blake in the semifinals. In the gold medal match, he lost in straight sets to Rafael Nadal.

At the US Open in September, he lost in the fourth round to former local champion Andy Roddick, 2–6, 4–6, 1–6. He ended the season at No. 15. In November, at the end of the season, Stefanki stopped coaching González after receiving a job offer from Roddick. On 12 December, González announced he had hired former Argentine player Martín Rodríguez as his new full-time coach for 2009.

===2009===
In the first round of the Australian Open, González prevailed in a five-set thriller over Lleyton Hewitt, which lasted for 3 hours and 7 minutes. In the third round, he came back from two sets down to defeat Richard Gasquet of France in a match that lasted over four hours, with a score of 3–6, 3–6, 7–6, 6–2, 12–10. However, he bowed out of the tournament with a straight-sets defeat against world No. 1 and eventual champion Rafael Nadal in the fourth round.

At the Viña del Mar tournament in February, González claimed victory once again, taking the title for the fourth time in five finals. He overpowered all of his opponents with a solid display of tennis and did not drop a set throughout the entire tournament. In the final, he defeated his good friend José Acasuso, 6–1, 6–3. With this win, he returned to the top 15 in singles.

In early March, González missed the Davis Cup tie against Croatia due to a back injury. In April, he resigned from the Chile Davis Cup team, citing a violation of a confidentiality agreement. The local tennis federation had disclosed the amount of money won by the players at the tie against Australia. He conditioned his return on the resignation of the federation&#x27;s current directive and promised to relinquish all his future Davis Cup proceeds for the &quot;benefit of younger players.&quot;

At the start of the clay-court season, González reached the semifinals in Barcelona and Rome. However, he had to withdraw from Munich and Madrid after twisting his ankle while signing autographs in Rome. At the French Open, he reached the semifinals for the first time by beating third seed Andy Murray in the quarterfinals. In the semifinals, he played Robin Söderling, who had previously defeated top seed Rafael Nadal and Nikolay Davydenko. González came just two games away from winning that match during the fifth set, after holding an advantage of 4–1.

At the US Open, González reached the quarterfinals for the second time, beating seventh seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the fourth round. He was defeated by third seed Rafael Nadal in a match repeatedly delayed by rain. The match was suspended on Thursday night with González trailing, 6–7, 6–6, down 2–3 in the tiebreaker. When the match resumed on Saturday, González was visibly flat, losing the remaining four points in the tiebreaker and not winning a game in the third set.

With his notable performances at the French and US Open, González achieved a career-high 14 victories in Grand Slam events during the year.

===2010===
González won against Olivier Rochus, Marsel İlhan, and Evgeny Korolev at the Australian Open, but lost to Andy Roddick in the fourth round in a tense and controversial five-set match that lasted for 3 hours and 25 minutes. During the match, there was a disputed set point in the fourth set when a Roddick forehand winner was called out. Roddick challenged the call and Hawk-eye technology revealed that the ball was in. Therefore, Roddick won the set. González believed the point should have been replayed as he was in the right position and could have made a play on the ball if it had been called in. González lost the match 3–6, 6–3, 6–4, 5–7, 2–6.

Afterwards, González participated in the Movistar Open, which was held in Santiago for the first time that year instead of Viña del Mar, where he had won the previous two years. He made it to the semifinals but lost to Thomaz Bellucci in three sets despite being a break up in the second set and only two games away from victory.

In the Abierto Mexicano Telcel, González made it to the semifinals, defeating Sam Querrey, Victor Hănescu, and Eduardo Schwank in three sets before suffering a bad loss to David Ferrer. He then chose to skip the 1000 Masters in Indian Wells to travel to areas affected by the 8.8 magnitude earthquake in Chile.

In early March, González and his teammates defeated Israel in the Davis Cup to advance Chile to the quarterfinals. He then returned to the ATP Tour Masters 1000 in Miami, where he lost in the fourth round to Robin Söderling. He also hosted a benefit for the Chilean earthquake victims called Champions for Chile, appearing alongside Andy Roddick, Jim Courier, and Gustavo Kuerten.

During the clay season, González played only one tournament in Houston, where he reached the quarterfinals. At Roland Garros, he was defeated in the second round and was sidelined for almost three months with a knee injury.

González returned to play in New Haven, where he lost in the second round to Radek Štěpánek. At the US Open, he retired from his first-round match against Ivan Dodig. On 21 September, González announced that he would undergo surgery on his right hip and possibly his right knee on 4 October, and was expected to be out for eight to nine months.

===2011===
González announced he would return to Belgrade for &quot;the start of the end of my career.&quot; He defeated Alexandr Dolgopolov in the first round of Wimbledon and made it to the third round, but lost to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in straight sets.

===2012===
On 9 February 2012, González announced that he would retire from professional tennis after the Miami Masters. He played his last professional match on 21 March 2012 at Miami, losing in three sets to Nicolas Mahut in the first round.

==Personal life==
González was born in Santiago. His father, Fernando González Ramírez, is the manager of the Molina flour mill in Santiago, and his mother, Patricia Ciuffardi, a housewife of Italian descent. He has an older sister, Patricia, and a younger sister, Jéssica. He studied primary school at Colegio de La Salle and finished secondary school at Colegio Terra Nova.

Since 2017, he had been in a relationship with retired Argentine field hockey player Luciana Aymar, and they have two children: a son, Félix, born in 2019, and a daughter, Lupe, born in 2021.

In July 2022, González announced that he and his family would be moving to Miami.

<text>René González (August 5, 1918 – May 9, 1982) was a Cuban professional baseball player. A native of Cienfuegos, Cuba, González was a first baseman/outfielder who batted and threw right-handed.

González was a consistent hitter who spent most of his career in Mexican baseball (1947–1949, 1951–1956), where he won three consecutive batting titles (1952–54) including the Triple Crown in 1952. An eight-time .300 hitter, he collected 1144 hits in 3459 at-bats for a .331 batting average during nine seasons.

In 1950, González played for the New York Cubans in the Negro leagues.

After that he played for the Patriotas de Venezuela club of the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League during the 1951–1952 season. He finished with a .357 batting average and led the league in home runs (10), RBI (56), hits (74), doubles (18) and slugging % (.739). Later, he played as a 
reinforcement for the Navegantes del Magallanes in the 1951 Caribbean Series, where he led the Venezuelan offensive with a .333 average and two home runs, while his 11 RBI topped the tournament.

González also played in Cuba and Nicaragua up until 1958, his last season. Following his baseball retirement he returned to his Cuba homeland, where he died aged 63.

In 1993 he was inducted into the Mexican Professional Baseball Hall of Fame.

<doc id="498348" wikidata="Q546963" url="?curid=498348" title="Guinea Pig (film series)">
<text>is a Japanese horror (and later, black comedy) series that consists of six films, as well as two making-of documentaries. The series&#x27; original concept, was envisioned by manga artist Hideshi Hino (who wrote and directed two films in the series). The series primarily focuses on situations involving graphic violence, gore, mutilation, torture, and murder.

The &quot;Guinea Pig&quot; series has garnered controversy for its depictions of violence. One or more entries in the series were suspected to have influenced Tsutomu Miyazaki, a serial killer who kidnapped and murdered four young girls. The second film in the series, &quot;Guinea Pig 2: Flower of Flesh and Blood&quot;, was supposedly withdrawn from the market, and has achieved particular notoriety because of an incident in which American actor Charlie Sheen is said to have watched the film and believed that it depicted the actual killing and dismemberment of a real woman, prompting him to report it to authorities.

The &quot;Guinea Pig&quot; films were released on DVD by distributor Unearthed Films. As a tribute to the Japanese film series, Unearthed Films began producing a series of horror films titled &quot;American Guinea Pig&quot;.

==Films==
===&quot;Devil&#x27;s Experiment&quot; (1985)===

 is a 1985 film directed by Satoru Ogura, and the first entry in the series. The film depicts a group of men who kidnap and graphically torture a young woman in a variety of ways—these include hitting her, kicking her, pinching her with pliers, forcing her to endure sound torture, burning her with hot oil, pouring maggots and offal on her, hanging her up in a net, and poking a needle through one of her eyes.

===&quot;Flower of Flesh and Blood&quot; (1985)===

 is a 1985 film written and directed by Hideshi Hino, based on his horror manga works, and is the second entry in the series. The plot revolves around a man dressed as a samurai who drugs and abducts a woman, takes her to his home, dismembers her, and adds her body parts to a collection.

This entry in the series has been called &quot;notorious&quot;. It garnered controversy for its graphic content and was reportedly withdrawn from the market after being examined by a number of Japanese boards of education. It was also suspected to have influenced serial killer Tsutomu Miyazaki—also known as the Otaku Murderer—who abducted and murdered four young girls in the Saitama and Tokyo prefectures. Miyazaki had an extensive collection of videotapes, many of which were horror films; one of the &quot;Guinea Pig&quot; films was reported to have been found in Miyazaki&#x27;s collection, though writer-director Hino has asserted that it was not &quot;Flower of Flesh and Blood&quot;.

In 1991, American actor Charlie Sheen is said to have obtained a copy of the film from film writer and critic Chris Gore. Upon watching and becoming convinced that what was on screen was a genuine snuff film that depicted the dismemberment and killing of a woman, Charlie Sheen quickly reported it to authorities in which the Federal Bureau of Investigation purportedly opened an inquiry into those involved in the film&#x27;s production and distribution. Any official investigations were dropped after it was demonstrated that special effects were used to simulate the violence in the film. This incident, and the frequency with which it has been recounted by &quot;hard core&quot; fans of horror films, has been compared to an urban legend.

===&quot;He Never Dies&quot; (1986)===

, also known as &quot;Guinea Pig 3: He Never Dies&quot;, is a 1986 film directed by Masayuki Hisazumi (or Masayuki Kusumi). After an introduction given by an American reporter discussing strange cases from around the world, the story begins, centering around an unlucky salaryman named Hideshi. One evening, Hideshi attempts to slit his wrists, and finds that he cannot feel pain. He then discovers that he has somehow become immortal, and invites a co-worker to his home, asking that he bring sharp gardening utensils with him. When his co-worker arrives, Hideshi plays a practical joke on him by using the tools to mutilate himself, then ends up decapitating himself with a set of gardening shears, terrifying the co-worker to the point of fainting during the ordeal. Eventually, the co-worker’s girlfriend enters Hideshi’s apartment to see why her fiancé was taking so long, only to find Hideshi’s still-living head on a blood-spattered coffee table. Rather than being scared by the gory scene, the girlfriend is confused by how Hideshi is still alive. She goes to wake her boyfriend, and then the two begin to clean the apartment so Hideshi doesn’t get in trouble with his landlord. As the others get to work cleaning, Hideshi announces that he has become more confident, and would like to return to his job the next day.

Though &quot;He Never Dies&quot; features graphic imagery, it is more darkly comedic in tone than its predecessors and its successors except &quot;Devil Woman Doctor&quot;.

===&quot;Mermaid in a Manhole&quot; (1988)===
 is a 1988 film written and directed by Hideshi Hino, based again on his horror manga works. Sources differ on whether it is the fourth or sixth film in the series. In a 2009 interview with &quot;Vice&quot;, Hino said that he had &quot;nothing to do with&quot; the fourth &quot;Guinea Pig&quot; film, implying that he does not consider &quot;Mermaid in a Manhole&quot; to be the fourth entry in the series. However, Stephen Biro, co-founder of the home video distribution company Unearthed Films, listed &quot;Mermaid in a Manhole&quot; as the fourth film in the series. In his book &quot;The Encyclopedia of Japanese Horror Films&quot;, Salvador Jimenez Murguía claims that it was &quot;the sixth &quot;Guinea Pig&quot; film to be produced, although it was released fourth.&quot;

The plot of &quot;Mermaid in a Manhole&quot; follows an artist who has become estranged from his wife. One day while visiting the sewers beneath the street, he encounters a mermaid that he had once met as a child. After noticing that she has boils growing on her body, the artist offers to help her, and brings the mermaid to his house to continue illustrating her. Over time, her illness gets worse, and eventually she begins suffering the symptoms of a horrendous infestation in which countless worms of various sizes burst out of the boils on her body. On the verge of death, she begs the artist to kill her, and he does, stabbing her to death then dismembering her body. Later, the artist&#x27;s two neighbours, who were intrigued by what the artist had been doing after one of them found a fish head in the trash, go to investigate, but flee after they come across the artist holding the pieces of the mermaid while listlessly singing about her death.

When the local police take control of the scene and investigate, they find that instead of the dismembered body being that of a mermaid, it is that of a human woman. The neighbours are interviewed, and everyone suspects the artist to have killed his wife, a statement which the investigation finds to be true; hallucinating, the schizophrenic artist had murdered his wife, who had been suffering from stomach cancer. Now imprisoned, the artist sits, manically muttering to himself about how he was sure he had killed the mermaid. Yet, despite all the evidence against it, a single scale was found in the bathtub in the artist&#x27;s house, belonging to an unidentified species.

Unlike its predecessors, &quot;Mermaid in a Manhole&quot; is more of a body horror film, has more of a storyline and has a tone that is significantly more poignant and falls more into the tragedy genre than the other films in the series. For these reasons, &quot;Mermaid in a Manhole&quot; is generally considered to be one of the best films in the series and is a fan favorite.

===&quot;Android of Notre Dame&quot; (1988)===
 is a 1988 film directed by Kazuhito Kuramoto. It revolves around a scientist who tries to find a cure for his sister&#x27;s grave illness. The scientist needs a &quot;guinea pig&quot; to perform experiments on. A stranger approaches the scientist, offering a body for the experiments, for which the scientist will pay. When the experiments do not go well, the scientist becomes enraged and hacks the body to pieces. The stranger approaches the scientist again and supplies another body so the experiments can continue.

===&quot;Devil Woman Doctor&quot; (1990)===
 is a 1990 film directed by Hajime Tabe. Much like &quot;Mermaid in a Manhole&quot;, sources differ on whether &quot;Devil Woman Doctor&quot; is the fourth or sixth entry in the series. The front cover art for the VHS release of the film by Sai Enterprise describes it as the fourth film in the series. According to Salvador Jimenez Murguía: &quot;despite being chronologically labeled as the fourth in the series, [&quot;Devil Woman Doctor&quot;] is often referred to as the final [&quot;Guinea Pig&quot;] film.&quot;

&quot;Devil Woman Doctor&quot; tells the story of a female doctor played by Japanese drag actor Peter. The film takes the form of several vignettes in which she encounters numerous patients, including a family whose heads explode if they get upset and a woman whose heart explodes when she becomes scared, a man with dissociative identity disorder who finds a new life as a street comedian, a yakuza member who has a sentient tumour with a human face growing on his stomach, and a zombie who lives a relatively normal life with his still-living girlfriend. The doctor then saves a woman from an animate internal organ before meeting a man who sweats blood, and attempts to remove a living tattoo from another patient, who she eventually has to flay alive to finally remove the troublesome ink. In the final scene, a group of four men discuss their particularly bizarre conditions. The first patient produces soybean paste under his feet and can spit eggs containing infant aliens from his mouth, the second has an elastic penis, the third constantly emits smoke from his body, and the fourth has a heart which moves around inside him. The Devil Woman Doctor then arrives on the scene and proclaims to the audience that each of the four conditions presented by the patients are incurable. As the credits roll, several of the film&#x27;s characters hit each other with metal discs coated in sharp metal spikes, causing large amounts of blood to spurt from them, though no one appears to be seriously injured despite the graphic scene. Rather than horror, the tone of this installment is more akin to extremely violent and surreal slapstick comedy.

==Other releases==
===Making-of documentaries===
In 1986, , a making-of documentary about the production of the first three &quot;Guinea Pig&quot; films, was released. The existence of behind-the-scenes footage demonstrating special effects used in the &quot;Guinea Pig&quot; series is thought to have assuaged fears about the &quot;Guinea Pig&quot; films being snuff films.

, a behind-the-scenes look at the production of &quot;Devil Woman Doctor&quot;, was released in 1990.

===&quot;Slaughter Special&quot; (1991)===
In 1991, , a &quot;best-of&quot; special which showcases highlights from the series, was released.

==Home media==
In the 1980s, the &quot;Guinea Pig&quot; films were released on VHS by a variety of companies, including Midnight 25 Video, Japan Home Video, MAD Video, and Sai Enterprise.

In the early 2000s, distributor Unearthed Films released the &quot;Guinea Pig&quot; films and the associated making-of documentaries on DVD. Each release was a double feature containing two films: &quot;Devil&#x27;s Experiment&quot; / &quot;Android of Notre Dame&quot;, &quot;Mermaid in a Manhole&quot; / &quot;He Never Dies&quot;, &quot;Flower of Flesh and Blood&quot; / &quot;Making of Guinea Pig&quot;, and &quot;Devil Woman Doctor&quot; / &quot;Making of Devil Woman Doctor&quot;. The following year, Unearthed Films released a DVD box set containing the six &quot;Guinea Pig&quot; films, the two making-of documentaries and the &quot;Slaughter Special&quot;.

==Legacy==
As a tribute to the &quot;Guinea Pig&quot; series, Unearthed Films began producing a horror film series known as &quot;American Guinea Pig&quot;. The films in this series are as follows: &quot;American Guinea Pig: Bouquet of Guts and Gore&quot; (2014), &quot;American Guinea Pig: Bloodshock&quot; (2015), &quot;American Guinea Pig: The Song of Solomon&quot; (2017), and &quot;American Guinea Pig: Sacrifice&quot; (2017).

<doc id="498351" wikidata="Q1540152" url="?curid=498351" title="VMU">
<text>The Visual Memory Unit (VMU), also referred to as the (VMS) in Japan, is the primary memory card produced by Sega for the Dreamcast home video game console. The device features a monochrome liquid crystal display (LCD), multiplayer gaming capability (via connectors at the top), second screen functionality, a real-time clock, file manager, built-in flash memory, and sound capability. Prior to the launch of the Dreamcast, a special Godzilla edition VMU, preloaded with a virtual pet game, was released on July 30, 1998, in Japan.

While its most basic function is as a removable storage device, the VMU may also serve as an auxiliary display during normal gameplay and, through the use of additional software (distributed as extras on Dreamcast GD-ROMs), acts as a handheld game console. Console-like features of the VMU include a screen, speaker, proper directional pad, four action buttons, the ability to connect and interact with other VMUs, and the ability to download additional games.

==Hardware==
For use as a memory card and second screen, the VMU is plugged directly into one of two slots on a Dreamcast controller (up to two VMUs may be plugged in each controller, and eight VMUs per Dreamcast console).

Upon initial use, the player is prompted to set the date and time, and then select from a group of bitmap images to serve as the default background for the VMU (various Dreamcast titles may offer players additional background images for the unit). This image is displayed while the Dreamcast console is in the operating system menu.

When operated independently of the Dreamcast console, the VMU acts as a file manager, clock/calendar (with selectable clock animations), and handheld game console. VMUs may also connect to each other directly to facilitate file transfer or multiplayer gaming.

The VMU runs on two CR-2032 lithium batteries which are inserted into the rear of the VMU under a screw-secured lid. Without battery power, the VMU still functions as a memory card and auxiliary display, but cannot play downloaded mini-games. Additionally, a VMU without battery power will beep when the Dreamcast is powered on (if the VMU is inserted into a connected Dreamcast controller)

The VMU has 128 KB of flash memory, but by default 28 KB is reserved for system use leaving 100 KB for data storage, which is divided into 200 &#x27;blocks&#x27; – one block equaling 512 bytes. In recent years, homebrew programs like Dream Explorer (aka VMU Tool) have allowed users to unlock an extra 44 blocks (22 KB) of this reserved space increasing the overall VMU capacity to 244 blocks. However, a handful of games might be unable to detect the memory card if this is done, although none have been reported apart from DreamKey/DreamPassport and Metropolis Street Racer.

==Minigames and in-game features==
Several titles for the Dreamcast include mini-games that can be downloaded onto a VMU. The &quot;Sonic Adventure&quot; series, for instance, include the &quot;Chao Adventure&quot; mini-games (&quot;Chao Adventure&quot; and &quot;Chao Adventure 2&quot; which features more activities and items). In the games, players can transfer Chao eggs to the VMU and partake in various activities to increase the stats of their hatched Chao, whereupon they can upload their improved Chao back into the Dreamcast game. &quot;Sega GT&quot; includes &quot;Pocket GT&quot;, a top-down racer in the style of the 8-bit &quot;SpyHunter&quot; games.

In other video games, statistics such as the current health condition are displayed on the VMU for convenience (as in &quot;Resident Evil: Code Veronica&quot;) or to enhance multi-player gaming (for example, &quot;NFL 2K2&quot; allowed the VMU to display secret plays not viewable to other players).

There are also numerous homebrew games, original creations and ports of famous games that are freely available on the internet and can be installed and played on a VMU. These games include: &quot;Metroid&quot;, &quot;VMU Mini Pacman&quot;, &quot;Breakout&quot;, &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, &quot;Tetris&quot;, &quot;VMU Fighter&quot; (a side-scrolling shoot &#x27;em up), &quot;VMU Football&quot; (an American football game), &quot;VMU-a-Sketch&quot; (a digital Etch-a-sketch pad), and &quot;3D FPS&quot; (a first-person-shooter).

==Variants==
Multiple Dreamcast memory cards with no VMU features have been released. The cards therefore omit a display screen, input buttons, speaker and built-in clock. Some have the same 128 KB storage as the VMU, equivalent to 200 blocks, while others have multiple &quot;pages&quot; with each acting as a 128 KB memory card. In the latter case, a button or switch allows the user to select the desired memory card. This is due to the Dreamcast having a limit of 128 KB per individual memory card.

===4x Memory Card===

Sega released an official 4x Memory Card which offered four times the data storage of a standard VMU, with 800 blocks. It was released in Japan on December 14, 2000, as &quot;Memory Card 4X&quot;, and in the US as &quot;4x Memory Card&quot;. A button is used to select one of four &quot;pages&quot;, and a series of four orange LED on the card indicates which of these is currently in use. Not all games are compatible, so Sega released a list of incompatible games.

A limited edition &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; 4x Memory Card was also released in Japan to coincide with the game&#x27;s release. It was coloured blue and featured the &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; logo printed onto the casing.

The 4x Memory Card did not make it to retail in Europe, despite a planned release (along with the Dreamcast Broadband Adapter which was also unreleased in Europe) due to the Dreamcast&#x27;s unforeseeably short lifespan – although unofficial third party 4x Memory Cards were released in Europe.

===Third-party memory cards===
The Nexus Memory Card is a third party version of the Visual Memory Unit that features four times the memory of a stock VMU with 800 blocks (4 megabit / 512 kilobytes) but lacks an LCD screen. The card is divided into 4 pages each with 200 blocks, each page can be selected using a button on the top left of the card. The Nexus Memory Card is slightly larger than the normal VMU and can be connected to a personal computer by USB, Parallel or Serial cable. A 3200 block (16 megabit / 2 megabytes) version of the Nexus is also available, but this model has been known to be unstable.

Nyko released two memory cards for the Dreamcast: the Jumbo Memory Pak X2 with twice the storage as a VMU, and the Hyperpak with four times the storage. The Hyperpak could also act as a Jump Pak by setting its switch to rumble mode.

The Performance Memory Card was a third-party basic memory card with the same 200 blocks of storage as a VMU. The Performance Mega Memory Card acted like a 4X Memory Card. It used a switch on its back to select the desired memory card &quot;page&quot;. Unlike other memory cards however, the Performance model had to be removed from the controller before the &quot;page&quot; could be switched.

In September 2023, following a successful crowdfunding campaign, Dreamware Enterprises released an aftermarket VMU update called the VM2. The VM2 features a backlit screen, a rechargeable battery with USB-C support, and MicroSD storage.

==Reception==

In a 10-year retrospective, GamesRadar called the VMU &quot;one of our favorite storage devices&quot;. They offered praise for the originality of the device, as well its flexibility and commented that newer systems should have revisited the concept. However, they lamented that most games didn&#x27;t find a useful purpose for it and that the device drained batteries quickly. In 2024, &quot;Time Extension&quot; called the VMU &quot;an important evolution of the memory card concept&quot;.

<doc id="498356" wikidata="Q1212384" url="?curid=498356" title="The Colour Out of Space">
<text>&quot;The Colour Out of Space&quot; is a science fiction/horror short story by American author H. P. Lovecraft, written in March 1927. In the tale, an unnamed narrator pieces together the story of an area known by the locals as the &quot;blasted heath&quot; (most likely after a line from either Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; or Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;) in the hills west of the fictional town of Arkham, Massachusetts. The narrator discovers that many years ago a meteorite crashed there, poisoning every living being nearby: vegetation grows large but foul-tasting, animals are driven mad and deformed into grotesque shapes, and the people go insane or die one by one.

Lovecraft began writing &quot;The Colour Out of Space&quot; immediately after finishing his previous short novel, &quot;The Case of Charles Dexter Ward&quot;, and in the midst of final revision on his horror fiction essay &quot;Supernatural Horror in Literature&quot;. Seeking to create a truly alien life form, he drew inspiration from numerous fiction and nonfiction sources. First appearing in the September 1927 edition of Hugo Gernsback&#x27;s science fiction magazine &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, &quot;The Colour Out of Space&quot; became one of Lovecraft&#x27;s most popular works, and remained his personal favorite of his short stories. It has been adapted to film several times, as &quot;Die, Monster, Die!&quot; (1965), &quot;The Curse&quot; (1987), &quot;Colour from the Dark&quot; (2008), &quot;The Colour Out of Space&quot; (&quot;Die Farbe&quot;) (2010) and &quot;Color Out of Space&quot; (2019).

==Synopsis==
The narrator, an unnamed surveyor from Boston, describes his attempts to uncover the secrets behind a shunned place referred to by the locals of the hills west of Arkham as the &quot;blasted heath&quot;. Unable to garner any information from the townspeople, the protagonist seeks out an old and allegedly crazy man by the name of Ammi Pierce, who relates his experiences with a farmer named Nahum Gardner and his family who used to live on the property.

A meteorite crashed into Nahum&#x27;s land over fifty years prior, in June 1882. At the time, local scientists take a sample from the meteorite, and are perplexed by several strange behaviors that it exhibits. The sample disappears overnight after being stored in a glass beaker. When attempting to take a second sample from the meteorite, the scientists reveal a globule encased in the meteorite emitting a strange color. It was &quot;only by analogy that they called it a color at all&quot;, as it fell outside of the range of anything known in the visible spectrum. One of the scientists hits the globule with a hammer, and it disintegrates. Overnight, the meteorite disappears after being struck by bolts of lightning.

The following season, Nahum&#x27;s crops grow unnaturally large and abundant. When he discovers that, despite their appearance, they are inedible, he becomes convinced that the meteorite has poisoned the soil. Over the following year, the problem spreads to the surrounding plants and animals, altering them in unusual ways. All of the vegetation on the farm begins to become grey and brittle.

Mrs. Gardner goes mad, and Nahum decides to keep her locked in the attic. Over time, the family becomes isolated from the neighboring farmers, and Pierce becomes their only contact with the outside world. Pierce informs Nahum that their well water has gone bad and suggests digging and drinking from a new one, but Nahum refuses to take his advice. Thaddeus, one of Nahum&#x27;s sons, also goes mad, and Nahum locks him in a different room of the attic. The livestock start to take on disturbing forms and die off. Like the crops, their meat is inedible. Thaddeus dies in the attic, and Nahum buries his remains behind the farm. Merwin, another of Nahum&#x27;s sons, vanishes while retrieving water from the contaminated well.

After weeks of no contact with Nahum, Pierce visits the farmstead. He meets Nahum in his house, and realizes that he, like his wife and son, has also gone mad. When asked about Zenas, Nahum&#x27;s last son who was accounted for, Nahum tells Pierce that Zenas &quot;lives in the well&quot;. Pierce ascends the stairs to the attic and finds that Mrs. Gardner has taken on a horrible form. It is implied that Pierce kills her in an act of mercy. When he descends the stairs, he finds that Nahum too has become horribly deformed. Nahum has a moment of lucidity and tells Pierce that the color that arrived on the meteorite is responsible, and that it has been siphoning the life out of the surrounding area. Shortly afterwards, Nahum dies.

Pierce leaves and returns to the farmstead with six men. The group discovers both Merwin&#x27;s and Zenas&#x27;s eroding skeletons at the bottom of the well, along with the bones of several other creatures. As they reflect upon their discoveries in the house, the color begins to pour out from the well. The trees start to convulse, and the greyed organic material on the farm begins to faintly glow with the color. The men flee the house as the color flies from the well into the sky and disappears. Pierce alone turns back after the color has gone and witnesses some residual part of the color attempt to ascend briefly, only to fail and return to the well. The knowledge that part of the color still resides on Earth is sufficient to disturb his mental state. When some of the men return the following day, they find only Pierce&#x27;s dead horse, acres of grey dust, and untouched inorganic matter. Upon hearing the rumors of what has taken place, many of the residents of the surrounding area decide to move away.

==Background==
Lovecraft began writing &quot;The Colour Out of Space&quot; in March 1927, immediately after completing &quot;The Case of Charles Dexter Ward&quot;. As he wrote the tale, however, he was also typing the final draft of his essay on horror fiction, &quot;Supernatural Horror in Literature&quot;. Although the author himself claimed that his inspiration was the newly constructed Scituate Reservoir in Rhode Island, Lovecraft scholar S. T. Joshi believes that the planned Quabbin Reservoir in Massachusetts must have influenced him as well. American writer and pulp fiction enthusiast Will Murray cites paranormal investigator Charles Fort, and the &quot;thunderstones&quot; (lightning-drawing rocks that may have fallen from the sky) he describes in &quot;The Book of the Damned&quot;, as possible inspirations for the behavior of the meteorite. Andy Troy argues that the story was an allegory for the coverage of the Radium Girls scandal in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, with the symptoms of the Gardners matching the newspaper&#x27;s description of radium necrosis. Edward Guimont and Horace A. Smith have proposed that the March 1926 rocket test flight by Robert H. Goddard on a farm in Auburn, Massachusetts may also have served as an influence on the story.

Lovecraft was dismayed at the all-too human depiction of aliens in other works of fiction, and his goal for &quot;Colour&quot; was to create an entity that was truly alien. In doing so, he drew inspiration from a number of sources describing colors outside of the visible spectrum. Most notably, Joshi points to Hugh Elliott&#x27;s &quot;Modern Science and Materialism&quot;, a 1919 nonfiction book that mentions the &quot;extremely limited&quot; senses of humans, such that of the many &quot;aethereal waves&quot; striking the eyes, &quot;The majority cannot be perceived by the retina at all&quot;. Lovecraft had used this concept previously, in his 1920 short story, &quot;From Beyond&quot;. Completed by the end of March, &quot;The Colour Out of Space&quot; first appeared in Hugo Gernsback&#x27;s science fiction magazine &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; in September 1927. The story was illustrated by J. M. de Aragón, an artist who produced occasional artwork for the magazine.

==Reception and legacy==
&quot;The Colour Out of Space&quot; became the only work from &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; to make Edward O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s anthology of &quot;The Best American Short Stories&quot;, appearing in the 1928 &quot;Roll of Honor&quot;. Gernsback paid Lovecraft only $25 (approximately $ in present-day terms) and was late in doing so, leading Lovecraft to refer to the publisher as &quot;Hugo the Rat&quot;. He never again submitted anything to the publication. Lovecraft did not write another major short story until the following year, when he authored &quot;The Dunwich Horror&quot;, although he did pen &quot;History of the Necronomicon&quot; and &quot;Ibid&quot; as minor works in-between, as well as an account of a Halloween night&#x27;s dream that he called &quot;The Very Old Folk&quot;.

In addition to being Lovecraft&#x27;s personal favourite of his short stories, critics generally consider &quot;The Colour Out of Space&quot; one of his best works, and the first with his trademark blending of science fiction and horror. Lovecraft scholar Donald R. Burleson referred to the tale as &quot;one of his stylistically and conceptually finest short stories&quot;. Joshi praises the work as one of Lovecraft&#x27;s best and most frightening, particularly for the vagueness of the description of the story&#x27;s eponymous horror. He also lauded the work as Lovecraft&#x27;s most successful attempt to create something entirely outside of the human experience, as the entity&#x27;s motive (if any) is unknown and it is impossible to discern whether or not the &quot;colour&quot; is emotional, moral, or even conscious. His only criticism is that it is &quot;just a little too long&quot;. E. F. Bleiler described &quot;The Colour Out of Space&quot; as &quot;an excellent story, one of Lovecraft&#x27;s finest works; in my opinion the best original story to appear in &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;&quot;. The text of &quot;The Colour Out of Space&quot;, like many of Lovecraft&#x27;s works, has fallen into public domain and can be accessed in several compilations of the author&#x27;s work, as well as on the Internet. It also had a strong influence on Brian Aldiss&#x27;s &quot;The Saliva Tree&quot;, which has been seen as a rewriting of Lovecraft&#x27;s tale. In 1984, the novel &quot;The Color Out of Time&quot; by Michael Shea was published as a sequel to the original novelette.

===Film adaptations===
The 1965 film &quot;Die, Monster, Die!&quot;, directed by Daniel Haller, is based on &quot;The Colour Out of Space&quot;. The film stars Nick Adams, Suzan Farmer, and Boris Karloff. Lovecraft scholar Don G. Smith claims that, of the scenes that are derived from Lovecraft&#x27;s work, the &quot;blasted heath doesn&#x27;t live up to Lovecraft&#x27;s description&quot; and asserts that, overall, the film does not capture Lovecraft&#x27;s intent to &quot;...play...with the idea of an alien life form completely different from anything humans can imagine&quot;. Smith considers Haller&#x27;s work an imitation of Roger Corman&#x27;s Edgar Allan Poe films, rather than a serious attempt to adapt Lovecraft&#x27;s tale. Another adaptation, &quot;The Curse&quot; (1987), was directed by David Keith and stars Wil Wheaton, Claude Akins, Cooper Huckabee, and John Schneider. It more closely follows the plot of Lovecraft&#x27;s work, albeit set in the 1980s. Lovecraft scholar Charles P. Mitchell referred to the film as faithful to the author&#x27;s original work, but Mitchell claimed that &quot;[t]he last twenty minutes of the film are so disjointed that they virtually ruin the entire film.&quot;

The 2008 film &quot;Colour from the Dark&quot;, directed by Ivan Zuccon, is an adaptation set in Italy. The film stars Michael Segal, Debbie Rochon, Marysia Kay, Gerry Shanahan, and Eleanor James. Bloody Disgusting praised the film, stating Zuccon &quot;managed to do the famous writer&#x27;s twisted tale of unseen terror a really fair share of justice by capturing the bleak, grotesque and utterly frightening atmosphere of the source material very, very well&quot;. The 2010 film &quot;Die Farbe&quot; (&quot;The Color&quot;), directed by Huan Vu, is an adaptation set in Germany. It is shot mainly in black and white, the exception being the &quot;Colour&quot; itself. S. T. Joshi described it as &quot;the best Lovecraft film adaptation ever made&quot;. The 2018 film &quot;Annihilation&quot;—itself based on the 2014 novel of the same name by Jeff VanderMeer—contains numerous plot similarities with Lovecraft&#x27;s story, most prominently a colorful alien entity that crash lands on earth and begins mutating nearby plant and animal life.

A new version was adapted by writer/director Richard Stanley and released in 2019 under the title &quot;Color Out of Space&quot;. This film stars Nicolas Cage and Joely Richardson, and was produced by Elijah Wood through his production company SpectreVision. It has a contemporary setting but keeps Lovecraft&#x27;s plot intact. It is intended to be the first film in a trilogy of Lovecraft adaptations set in a shared universe.

Stephen King says that his 1987 novel &quot;The Tommyknockers&quot;, in which residents of a small town in rural Maine are physically and mentally affected by the emanations from an alien ship unearthed in the nearby woods, and which also features a major character named Gardner, was strongly influenced by &quot;The Colour Out of Space&quot;. Like many of his works at that time, it was adapted into a TV miniseries, broadcast in 1993; in 2018 it was reported to be in development as a feature film.

<text>Madeline Bassett is a fictional character in the Jeeves stories by English comic writer P. G. Wodehouse, being an excessively sentimental and fanciful young woman to whom Bertie Wooster intermittently, and reluctantly, finds himself engaged.

==Life and character==

The daughter of Sir Watkyn Bassett and the cousin of Stephanie &quot;Stiffy&quot; Byng, Madeline has golden hair, a treacly voice, a tinkling, silvery laugh and when she sighs, it sounds &quot;like the wind going out of a rubber duck&quot;. Bertie Wooster describes her in &quot;Right Ho, Jeeves&quot; as &quot;a pretty enough girl in a droopy, blonde, saucer-eyed way but not the sort of breath-taker that takes the breath&quot;, though elsewhere he describes her as &quot;physically in the pin-up class&quot;. He also notes that she is excessively mushy and fanciful, regularly espousing whimsical beliefs about gnomes and stars. She plays piano and is apt to sing folk songs, especially when she is trying to cheer herself up. She was educated at Roedean. Madeline enjoys reading Christopher Robin and Winnie the Pooh and the works of Rosie M. Banks. Inspired by the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley to become a vegetarian, she nonetheless has no knowledge of cooking.

While generally calm, she is capable of giving out an angry glare that could match even that of Bertie&#x27;s Aunt Agatha. Bertie is surprised to learn this in &quot;Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves&quot;, when he asks her hypothetically what would happen if Gussie Fink-Nottle ate steak and kidney pie (against her wish for him to be vegetarian). She questions Bertie if Gussie has been doing so. As Bertie states: &quot;I had never supposed that she had it in her to give anyone a piercing look, but that is what she gave me now. I don&#x27;t think even Aunt Agatha&#x27;s eyes have bored more deeply into me.&quot;

Her first appearance is in &quot;Right Ho, Jeeves&quot;. She meets and befriends Angela Travers and also meets Angela&#x27;s cousin Bertie Wooster during a stay in Cannes. She mistakenly believes that Bertie is in love with her and is gazing at her with long, dumb, searching looks. When he tries to tell her subtly that &quot;someone&quot; (Gussie Fink-Nottle) has feelings for her, Madeline incorrectly thinks that Bertie is talking about himself. To his great relief, she turns him down, as she is in love with Gussie; she assures Bertie that, if ever her engagement to Gussie were to fail, Bertie is the first person she would look to as a replacement fiancé. Since Bertie&#x27;s personal code does not allow him to insult her by correcting her misunderstanding or rejecting her offer, he is thereafter under threat of having to marry her if she rejects her first choice.

She becomes engaged (and disengaged) frequently in the novels, having idealistic standards that sometimes her fiancé cannot live up to. She becomes engaged to Bertie and Gussie in &quot;Right Ho, Jeeves&quot; and to Bertie and then back to Gussie in &quot;The Code of the Woosters&quot;. Her engagement to Gussie holds during &quot;The Mating Season&quot;, in which she visits an old friend of hers, Hilda Gudgeon, with whom she was educated at Roedean. Gussie later elopes with Emerald Stoker and Madeline becomes engaged variously to Bertie and Roderick Spode (Lord Sidcup) in &quot;Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves&quot; and again to Bertie and then back to Spode in &quot;Much Obliged, Jeeves&quot;. Ultimately, she is engaged to Spode and appears to be on her way to becoming the next Countess of Sidcup.

Direct speech:
* &quot;&#x27;Every time a fairy sheds a tear, a wee bit star is born in the Milky Way.&#x27;&quot;
* &quot;&#x27;When I was a child, I used to think that rabbits were gnomes, and that if I held my breath and stayed quite still, I should see the fairy queen.&#x27;&quot;
* &quot;&#x27;Beautiful smiling flowers, all wet with the morning dew. How &quot;happy&quot; flowers seem, Hilda.&#x27;&quot;
* &quot;&#x27;One morning we had walked in the meadows and the grass was all covered with little wreaths of mist, and I said didn&#x27;t he sometimes feel that they were the elves&#x27; bridal veils...&#x27;&quot;
* &quot;&#x27;And that evening we were watching the sunset, and I said sunsets always made me think of the Blessed Damozel leaning out from the gold bar of heaven...&#x27;&quot;
* &quot;&#x27;Today I danced on the lawn before breakfast, and then I went round the garden saying good morning to the flowers.&#x27;&quot;
* &quot;&#x27;I think I shall always be a fragrant memory, always something deep in your heart that will be with you like a gentle, tender ghost as you watch the sunset on summer evenings while the little birds sing their off-to-bed songs in the shrubbery.&#x27;&quot;

Attributed speech:
* &quot;Well, I mean to say, when a girl suddenly asks you out of a blue sky if you don&#x27;t sometimes feel that the stars are God&#x27;s daisy-chain, you begin to think a bit.&quot; – Narration by Bertie Wooster about Madeline
* &quot;&#x27;She holds the view that the stars are God&#x27;s daisy chain, that rabbits are gnomes in attendance on the Fairy Queen, and that every time a fairy blows its wee nose a baby is born...&#x27;&quot; – Said by Bertie about Madeline

<text>The Battle of Krithia Vineyard (6–13 August 1915) was fought during the Gallipoli Campaign during the First World War. It was originally intended as a minor British action at Helles on the Gallipoli peninsula to divert attention from the imminent launch of the August Offensive, but instead, the British commander, Brigadier General H.E. Street, mounted a futile and bloody series of attacks that in the end gained a small patch of ground known as &quot;The Vineyard&quot;.

== Prelude ==
The original commander of the British VIII Corps at Helles, Lieutenant General Aylmer Hunter-Weston, had departed the peninsula in July, following the last Helles offensive—the Battle of Gully Ravine. His replacement, Lieutenant General Francis Davies, arrived in early August but had not yet assumed command of the corps when a series of diversions were due to be launched from Anzac and Helles to divert Ottoman attention from the planned landing at Suvla and the break out from Anzac. Consequently, the Helles diversion was planned and conducted by the VIII Corps&#x27; chief of staff, Brigadier General H.E. Street, who proved himself an able student of Hunter-Weston&#x27;s battle strategy.

== Battle ==
Due to a shortage of artillery, the attack was split into two parts with the 88th Brigade of the 29th Division (with support on its right flank from the 1/5th Battalion, Manchester Regiment) attacking on the afternoon of 6 August while the 125th and 127th Brigades of the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division would attack early the following morning. The 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division and the 63rd (Royal Naval) Division in Corps reserve. They were facing four Ottoman divisions, three of which were fresh, while there were two more divisions in reserve.

The 88th Brigade&#x27;s attack managed to capture some Ottoman trenches, which were recaptured by the Ottoman 30th Regiment during a counter-attack. The British attacked again and once more captured some trenches, but the Ottomans counter-attacked again and drove them out. The British failed to hold any ground and the 88th Brigade reported casualties of 1,905 men, (fully 2/3 of the original Brigade strength), effectively destroying them as a fighting force. At around 9:40 am on the morning of 7 August the 42nd Division attacked on the right of the 88th Brigade&#x27;s sector. The 127th Brigade managed to break through the line held by the Ottoman 13th Division, but were forced back by an Ottoman counter-attack.

The Ottomans counter-attacked repeatedly from 7 August to 9 August and the fighting in the area continued until 13 August when it finally subsided. Afterwards, this sector of the Helles front would remain one of the busiest and most violent for the remainder of the campaign.

== Aftermath ==
Two Victoria Crosses were awarded during the fighting at Krithia Vineyard. Lieutenant (temporary Captain) William Thomas Forshaw of the 1/9th Battalion Manchester Regiment, Territorial Force, of the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division, and Private David Ross Lauder of the 1/4th Royal Scots Fusiliers, Territorial Force, of the 52nd (Lowland) Division. The British casualties in the first 24 hours of fighting, covering the original attacks of the 88th Brigade and the 125th and 127th Brigades of the 42nd Division, were 3,469 (134 Officers and 3,335 other ranks). The total British casualties for the duration of the battle were probably in excess of 4,000. The Ottoman casualties for the period of the battle were estimated to be around 7,500.

As for the other diversion at Lone Pine, the attack failed to fulfill its goal of tying down the Ottoman reinforcements away from the main offensive. As early as the morning of 7 August, regiments were being dispatched from Helles to the main front in the Sari Bair range.

<text>The Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad was a railroad that operated in the Midwestern United States. Commonly referred to as the Burlington Route, the Burlington, CB&amp;Q, or as the Q, it operated extensive trackage in the states of Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, Wisconsin, Wyoming, and also in Texas through subsidiaries Colorado and Southern Railway, Fort Worth and Denver Railway, and Burlington-Rock Island Railroad. Its primary connections included Chicago, Minneapolis–Saint Paul, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Denver. Because of this extensive trackage in the midwest and mountain states, the railroad used the advertising slogans &quot;Everywhere West&quot;, &quot;Way of the &quot;Zephyrs&quot;&quot;, and &quot;The Way West&quot;.

In 1967, it reported 19,565 million net ton-miles of revenue freight and 723 million passenger miles; corresponding totals for C&amp;S were 1,100 and 10 and for FW&amp;D were 1,466 and 13. At the end of the year, CB&amp;Q operated 8,538 route-miles, C&amp;S operated 708, and FW&amp;D operated 1,362 (these totals may or may not include the former Burlington-Rock Island Railroad). In 1970, it merged with the Northern Pacific Railway and the Great Northern Railway to form the Burlington Northern Railroad.

==History==

===1848–1882===
The earliest predecessor of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, the Aurora Branch Railroad, was chartered by act of the Illinois General Assembly on October 2, 1848. The charter was obtained by citizens of Aurora and Batavia, Illinois, who were concerned that the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad would bypass their towns in favor of West Chicago on its route; at the time, that was the only line running west from Chicago. The Aurora Branch was built from Aurora, through Batavia, to Turner Junction in what is now West Chicago. The line was built with old strap rail and minimal, if any, grading. Using a leased locomotive and cars, the Aurora Branch ran passenger and freight trains from Aurora to Chicago via its own line from Aurora to Turner Junction and one of the G&amp;CU&#x27;s two tracks east from there to Chicago. The G&amp;CU required the Aurora Branch to turn over 70 percent of their revenue per ton-mile handled on that railroad; as a result, in the mid-1850s, surveys were ordered to determine the best route for a railroad line to Chicago.

The line from Aurora to Chicago was built through the fledgling towns of Naperville, Lisle, Downers Grove, Hinsdale, Berwyn, and the west side of Chicago. It was opened in 1864, and passenger and freight service began. Regular commuter train service started in 1864 and remains operational to this day, making it the oldest surviving regular passenger service in Chicago. Both the original Chicago line, and to a much lesser extent, the old Aurora Branch right of way, are still in regular use today by the Burlington&#x27;s present successor BNSF Railway.

The company was renamed Chicago and Aurora Railroad on June 22, 1852, and given expanded powers to extend from Aurora to a point north of LaSalle; this extension, to Mendota, was completed on October 20, 1853. Another amendment, passed February 28, 1854, authorized the company to build east from Aurora to Chicago via Naperville, and changed its name to Chicago and Southwestern Railroad. The latter provision was never acted upon, and was repealed by an act of February 14, 1855, which instead reorganized the line as the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. The new railroad was formed by the consolidation of the Chicago and Aurora Railroad, the Central Military Tract, the west end of the Peoria &amp; Oquawka, and the Northern Cross Railroad companies. With a steady acquisition of locomotives, cars, equipment, and trackage, the Burlington Route was able to enter the trade markets in 1862. From that year to date, the railroad and its successors have paid dividends continuously, and never run into debt or defaulted on a loan—the only Class I U.S. railroad for which this is true.

After extensive trackwork was planned, the Aurora Branch changed its name to the Chicago and Aurora Railroad in June 1852, and to Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad in 1856, and shortly reached its two other namesake cities, Burlington, Iowa, and Quincy, Illinois. In 1868 CB&amp;Q completed bridges over the Mississippi River at both Burlington and Quincy, giving the railroad through connections with the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad (B&amp;MR) in Iowa and the Hannibal &amp; St. Joseph Railroad (H&amp;StJ) in Missouri. In 1860 the H&amp;SJ carried the mail to the Pony Express upon reaching the Missouri River at St. Joseph, Missouri. In 1862 The first Railway Post Office was inaugurated on the H&amp;StJ to sort mail on the trains way across Missouri.

The B&amp;MR continued building west into Nebraska as a separate company, the Burlington &amp; Missouri River Rail Road, founded in 1869. During the summer of 1870 it reached Lincoln, the newly designated capital of Nebraska and by 1872 it reached Kearney, Nebraska. That same year the B&amp;MR across Iowa was absorbed by the CB&amp;Q. By the time the Missouri River bridge at Plattsmouth, Nebraska, was completed the B&amp;MR in Nebraska was well on its way to Denver. That same year, the Nebraska B&amp;MR was purchased by the CB&amp;Q, which completed the line to Denver by 1882.

Early repair shops for rolling stock were built by the Aurora Branch Railroad in Chicago, but the first true shop site was established at Aurora, Illinois in 1855. These were capable of repairing and building locomotives, freight cars, and passenger cars. Other shop sites were established or inherited from predecessor lines as the system grew. By the early 1900s, the shops at Aurora served the Chicago Division, the shops in Galesburg, Illinois served the Galesburg Division, the shops in Hannibal, Missouri served the St. Louis Division, the shops in West Burlington, Iowa and in Creston, Iowa served the Iowa Division, and the shops in Denver, Colorado served the McCook and Red Cloud Divisions. The latter were the final steam era shops built for the CB&amp;Q, completed in 1922.

===1882–1901===
Burlington&#x27;s rapid expansion after the American Civil War was based upon sound financial management, dominated by John Murray Forbes of Boston and assisted by Charles Elliott Perkins. Perkins was a powerful administrator who eventually forged a system out of previously loosely held affiliates, virtually tripling Burlington&#x27;s size during his presidency from 1881 to 1901.

Ultimately, Perkins believed the Burlington Railroad must be included into a powerful transcontinental system. Though the railroad stretched as far west as Denver and Billings, Montana, it had failed to reach the Pacific Coast during the 1880s and 1890s, when construction was less expensive. Though approached by E. H. Harriman of the Union Pacific Railroad, Perkins felt his railroad was a more natural fit with James J. Hill&#x27;s Great Northern Railway. With its river line to the Twin Cities, the Burlington Route formed a natural connection between Hill&#x27;s home town (and headquarters) of St. Paul, Minnesota, and the railroad hub of Chicago. Moreover, Hill was willing to meet Perkins&#x27; $200-a-share asking price for the Burlington&#x27;s stock. By 1900, Hill&#x27;s Great Northern, in conjunction with the Northern Pacific Railway, held nearly 100 percent of Burlington&#x27;s stock.

By 1899, the company had rostered 1,205 locomotives, 936 passenger cars and 40,720 freight cars.

In 1901, a rebuffed Harriman tried to gain an indirect influence over the Burlington by launching a stock raid on the Northern Pacific. Though Hill managed to fend off this attack on his nascent system, it led to the creation of the Northern Securities Company, and later, the &quot;Northern Securities Co. v. United States&quot; ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court.

====Burlington strike of 1888====
The only major strike in the line&#x27;s history came in 1888, the Burlington railway strike of 1888. Unlike most strikes, which were based on unskilled workers, this one was based on the highly skilled well-paid engineers and firemen, a challenge to management prerogatives. A settlement would have been much cheaper, but President Perkins was determined to assert ownership rights and destroy the union threat. The fight dragged on 10 months before the financially and emotionally exhausted strikers finally gave up, and Perkins declared a total victory. However, he had spent heavily on strikebreakers, lawsuits, and police protection, hurting the balance sheets and putting the railroad in a poor position to face the nationwide depression of the Panic of 1893.

===1901–1945===

Following the purchase of the Burlington by GN and NP, expansion continued. In 1908, the CB&amp;Q purchased both the Colorado and Southern Railway and the Fort Worth and Denver Railway, giving it access south to Dallas and the Gulf of Mexico ports in Houston and Galveston. It also extended its reach south in the Mississippi Valley region by opening up a new line from Concord, Illinois, south to Paducah, Kentucky. It was during this period that the Burlington was at its largest, exceeding just over 12,000 route miles in 14 states by the 1920s. With the First World War having the same effect on the railroad as on all other railroads, during the 1920s, the Burlington Route had an increasingly heavy amount of equipment flooding the yards. With the advent of the Great Depression, the CB&amp;Q held a good portion of this for scrap.

In 1929, the CB&amp;Q created a subsidiary, the Burlington Transportation Company, to operate intercity buses in tandem with its railway network. On January 1, 1932, the CB&amp;Q received a new president; former Great Northern Railroad president Ralph Budd. By which time, the CB&amp;Q was facing a decline in passenger ridership from the Depression, and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt was exploring ways to help the rail industry improve. Ralph Budd subsequently asked for a streamlined stainless-steel train to be built, and this resulted in the railroad introducing the famous &quot;Zephyrs&quot;. As early as 1897, the railroad invested in alternatives to steam power, namely, internal-combustion engines. The railroad&#x27;s shops in Aurora had built a three-horsepower distillate motor in that year, but it was not reliable (requiring a massive 6,000-pound flywheel), and it had issues with overheating (even with the best metals of the day, its cylinder heads and liners would warp and melt in a matter of minutes), so it was therefore deemed impractical. Diesel engines of that era were obese, stationary monsters and were best suited for low-speed, continuous operation. 

It was not reliable for a railroad locomotive; there was no diesel engine suitable for that purpose then. Always innovating, the railroad purchased &quot;doodlebug&quot; gas-electric combine cars from Electro-Motive Corporation (EMC) and built their own, sending them out to do the jobs of a steam locomotive and a single car. After the positive results the doodlebug cars created, and after having purchased and used three General Electric steeple-cab switchers powered by distillate engines, Ralph Budd requested the Winton Engine Company to design and construct a light, powerful diesel engine that could stand the rigors of continuous, unattended daily service.

The experiences of developing these engines can be summed up shortly by General Motors Research vice-president Charles Kettering: &quot;I do not recall any trouble with the dip stick.&quot; Ralph Budd, accused of gambling on diesel power, chirped that &quot;I knew that the GM people were going to see the program through to the very end. Actually, I wasn&#x27;t taking a gamble at all.&quot; The manifestation of this gamble was the eight-cylinder Winton 8-201A engine that powered the &quot;Burlington Zephyr&quot; (built 1934) on its record-breaking run, and it opened the door for developing the long line of diesel engines that has powered Electro-Motive locomotives for the next seventy years. In 1936, the CB&amp;Q would become one of the founding members of the Trailways Transportation System, and still provides intercity service to this day as Burlington Trailways.

1940 was the final year the CB&amp;Q added steam locomotives to their roster, having completed construction on their O-5A class locomotives at the West Burlington, Iowa shops. With their freight traffic weighing 31 million tons that year, the CB&amp;Q saw no further necessity for any more steam or diesel locomotives to be added to their roster. In 1942, following the United States&#x27; entrance into World War II, the railroad&#x27;s freight traffic increased to 49 million tons, with Ralph Budd (now named President Roosevelt&#x27;s federal transportation commissioner) poised to ensure his company would help the war effort. In 1943, the War Production Board authorized EMC (now reincorporated as EMD) to construct sixteen FT locomotives for delivery to the CB&amp;Q the following year, by which time, the road&#x27;s freight traffic peaked 57 million tons.

===1945–1970===
After World War II ended, the CB&amp;Q began ordering additional diesel locomotives from EMD, as part of a $140-million program to dieselize their roster. August 31, 1949, was Ralph Budd&#x27;s final day as president of the railroad before he would retire during that year&#x27;s Chicago Railroad Fair, and Harry C. Murphy succeeded him in September. Dieselisation of the CB&amp;Q&#x27;s commercial passenger operations was completed on September 26, 1952, when the last of the 4-6-2 locomotives that operated for the Chicago-Aurora suburban service were retired; the remaining steam locomotives on the CB&amp;Q were primarily reassigned as freight haulers and yard switchers. The first division on the CB&amp;Q to be fully dieselized was the Casper Division in Wyoming, where EMD GP7 road switchers were delivered in 1951.In 1955, regular performance on class 3 overhauls on steam locomotives were discontinued, and Harry C. Murphy opted for the railroad&#x27;s remaining steam fleet to use up their previously-restored mileage throughout the next year. By which time, the majority of the Burlington&#x27;s steam fleet were relegated to operate east of Lincoln, Nebraska, with only two steam locomotives held for back-up service west of Lincoln. The final division on the CB&amp;Q to be fully dieselized was the Beardstown Division in Southern Illinois, where 2-8-2 locomotive No. 4997 worked the last commercial steam assignment for the railroad at Herrin Junction on January 27, 1959 (the only major U.S. railroads to operate revenue steam after this date were Union Pacific, Illinois Central, Nickel Plate Road, Norfolk and Western, Grand Trunk Western, Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range, and Lake Superior and Ishpeming). CB&amp;Q subsidiary Colorado and Southern eventually ended their commercial steam operations on October 11, 1962, when 2-8-0 No. 641 pulled a final freight train on the Leadville-Climax branch in Colorado.

On July 1, 1965, Harry Murphy retired from his position as president of the CB&amp;Q (he remained on the railroad as a director until October), and former Frisco Railway president Louis W. Menk took over as president and CEO. During his presidency, Louis Menk explored ways to reduce costs for the CB&amp;Q&#x27;s passenger operations and to reshape the road&#x27;s freight operations. Passenger service was markedly reduced, as people had shifted to using private automobiles for transportation. In late 1966, Louis Menk became president of the Northern Pacific, leaving William John Quinn in charge of the CB&amp;Q.

As the financial situation of American railroading continued to decline throughout the 1960s, forcing restructuring across the country, the CB&amp;Q merged with the Great Northern, Northern Pacific, and the Spokane, Portland and Seattle (SP&amp;S) railroads on March 2, 1970, to form the Burlington Northern Railroad (BN), with Louis Menk serving as the company&#x27;s first president and CEO (twenty-six years later, the BN and Santa Fe Railroads merged to become the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway (BNSF)). Most passenger operations would be assumed in 1971 by Amtrak.
==== Steam program ====
Beginning in the summer of 1955, the CB&amp;Q hosted a series of occasional steam excursion trains per request of railfan clubs, such as the Illinois Railroad Club. Harry C. Murphy was a steam fan who recognized the popularity in steam locomotives, and he authorized additional steam excursion trains to take place on the railroad throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s. Twenty-one steam locomotives of varying classes took part in the CB&amp;Q&#x27;s new steam excursion program, only two of which remained operational by 1961: 2-8-2 No. 4960 and 4-8-4 No. 5632. In 1962, the CB&amp;Q&#x27;s passenger department began sponsoring the excursion runs by offering ticket discounts to paying customers, and the Burlington began to host several school trains for school students.

In 1964, steam excursion operations on the railroad had dwindled, in the wake of rising operation and maintenance costs and a loss of experienced steam locomotive mechanics; the only factors that kept the CB&amp;Q&#x27;s steam program going were public demand and Harry Murphy&#x27;s passion for steam. In the process of reducing operating costs for the railroad, Harry Murphy&#x27;s successor, Louis Menk, ordered for the CB&amp;Q&#x27;s steam excursion program to be shut down by August 1, 1966. Despite a subsequent public outcry and protest over the program&#x27;s cancellation, the No. 4960 locomotive pulled the railroad&#x27;s final excursion train on July 17.

==The Burlington &quot;Zephyrs&quot;==

The railroad operated a number of streamlined passenger trains known as the &quot;Zephyrs&quot; which were one of the most famous and largest fleets of streamliners in the United States. The &quot;Burlington Zephyr&quot;, the first American diesel-electric powered streamlined passenger train, made its noted &quot;dawn-to-dusk&quot; run from Denver, Colorado, to Chicago, Illinois, on May 26, 1934. On November 11, 1934, the train was put into regularly scheduled service between Lincoln, Nebraska, and Kansas City, Missouri. Although the distinctive, articulated stainless steel trains were well known, and the railroad adopted the &quot;Way of the &quot;Zephyrs&quot;&quot; advertising slogan, they did not attract passengers back to the rails &quot;en masse&quot;, and the last one was retired from revenue service with the advent of Amtrak.

The &quot;Zephyr&quot; fleet included:

*&quot;Pioneer Zephyr&quot; (Lincoln–Omaha–Kansas City) 
*&quot;Twin Cities Zephyr&quot; (Chicago–Minneapolis-St. Paul)
*&quot;Mark Twain Zephyr&quot; (St. Louis–Burlington) 
*&quot;Denver Zephyr&quot; (Chicago–Denver)
*&quot;Nebraska Zephyr&quot; (Chicago–Lincoln)
*&quot;Sam Houston Zephyr&quot; (Houston–Dallas-Ft. Worth) 
*&quot;Ozark State Zephyr&quot; (Kansas City–St. Louis)
*&quot;General Pershing Zephyr&quot; (Kansas City–St. Louis)
*&quot;Silver Streak Zephyr&quot; (Kansas City–Omaha–Lincoln) 
*&quot;Ak-Sar-Ben Zephyr&quot; (Chicago–Lincoln) 
*&quot;Zephyr Rocket&quot; (St. Louis–Burlington–Minneapolis-St. Paul), jointly with Rock Island 
*&quot;Texas Zephyr&quot; (Denver–Dallas-Ft. Worth)
*&quot;American Royal Zephyr&quot; (Chicago–Kansas City)
*&quot;Kansas City Zephyr&quot; (Chicago–Kansas City)
*&quot;California Zephyr&quot; (Chicago–Oakland): Chicago–Denver handled by CB&amp;Q; Denver–Salt Lake City by Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad; Salt Lake City–Oakland by Western Pacific Railroad

Other named passenger trains which operated on the Burlington included:
*&quot;Adventureland&quot; (Kansas City-Billings)
* &quot;Aristocrat&quot; (Chicago–Denver): replaced the &quot;Colorado Limited&quot;
* &quot;Ak-Sar-Ben&quot; (Chicago–Lincoln): replaced &quot;Nebraska Limited&quot; and replaced by &quot;Ak-Sar-Ben Zephyr&quot;
* &quot;American Royal&quot; (Chicago–Kansas City): replaced by the &quot;American Royal Zephyr&quot;.
*&quot;Atlantic Express&quot; (Seattle-Tacoma-Chicago): jointly with Northern Pacific Railway
* &quot;Black Hawk&quot; (Chicago–Twin Cities overnight)
* &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; (Denver-Yellowstone) Seasonal tri-weekly service between Denver, and Yellowstone National Park via Cody, Wyoming
*&quot;Chicago Limited&quot; (Chicago-Denver)
* &quot;Coloradoan&quot; (Chicago–Denver): replaced by the &quot;Aristocrat&quot;
*&quot;Denver Limited&quot; (Denver-Chicago)
* &quot;Exposition Flyer&quot; (Chicago–Oakland) in conjunction with D&amp;RGW and WP before the launching of the &quot;California Zephyr&quot;
* &quot;Empire Builder&quot;: handled Great Northern Railway&#x27;s flagship between Chicago and Minneapolis
* &quot;Fast Mail&quot; (Chicago–Lincoln)
* &quot;Mainstreeter&quot;: handled the Northern Pacific Railway&#x27;s secondary transcontinental between Chicago and Minneapolis
* &quot;Nebraska Limited&quot; (Chicago–Lincoln): replaced by the &quot;Ak-Sar-Ben&quot;
* &quot;North Coast Limited&quot;: handled Northern Pacific Railway&#x27;s flagship between Chicago and Minneapolis
* &quot;North Pacific Express&quot; (Chicago-Seattle-Tacoma): jointly with Northern Pacific Railway
* &quot;Overland Express&quot; (Chicago-Denver). This train, along with &quot;The Aristocrat&quot; and the &quot;Colorado Limited&quot;, were promoted as companion trains to the streamlined &quot;Denver Zephyr&quot;
* &quot;Shoshone&quot;: (Denver-Billings) operated between Denver and Billings, Montana; referred to affectionately as &quot;The Night Crawler&quot;
* &quot;Western Star&quot;: handled the Great Northern Railway&#x27;s secondary transcontinental between Chicago and Minneapolis
* &quot;Zephyr Connection&quot;: (Denver-Cheyenne) offered daytime service along Colorado&#x27;s Front Range between Denver and Cheyenne, Wyoming

The &quot;California Zephyr&quot; is still operated daily by Amtrak as trains Five (westbound) and Six (eastbound). Another Amtrak train, the &quot;Illinois Zephyr&quot;, is a modern descendant of the &quot;Kansas City Zephyr&quot; and the &quot;American Royal Zephyr&quot; services.

== Preserved locomotives ==
Multiple locomotives from the Burlington have been preserved, including two Zephyr power units, thirty-five steam locomotives, and thirty-four diesel locomotives.

* Pioneer (locomotive) (4-2-0) – A It was built by Baldwin in 1837 as the very first steam locomotive to operate in Chicago, Illinois, as well as being the oldest locomotive to be used by the Burlington. It is currently on static display at the Chicago History Museum without a tender.
* 35 (A-2 4-4-0) – It has made an appearance at the 1933 Chicago World&#x27;s Fair, as well as the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair(as Union Pacific 119) and the Chicago Railroad Fair in 1948. It is currently on static display at the Patee House Museum in St. Joseph, Missouri.
* 114 (GE U28B) – It has been painted as Transkentucky Transportation Railroad 260. It is currently awaiting restoration to be repainted back to its Burlington appearance by the Illinois Railway Museum in Union, Illinois.
* 504 (EMD SD24) – It is currently operational and used for pulling occasional tourist trains at the Illinois Railway Museum in Union.

==Innovations==
The Burlington was a leader in innovation; among its firsts were use of the printing telegraph (1910), train radio communications (1915), streamlined passenger diesel power (1934) and vista-dome coaches (1945). In 1927, the railroad was one of the first to use Centralized Traffic Control (CTC) and by the end of 1957 had equipped of its line. It played a central role in bringing air brakes to freight service.

The railroad had one of the first hump classification yards at its Cicero Avenue Yard in Chicago, allowing an operator in a tower to line switches remotely and allowing around-the-clock classification. The company also tested the twin cylinder car.

<text>The Cuban Five, also known as the Miami Five, are five Cuban intelligence officers (Gerardo Hernández, Antonio Guerrero, Ramón Labañino, Fernando González, and René González) who were arrested in September 1998 and later convicted in Miami, Florida of conspiracy to commit espionage, conspiracy to commit murder, acting as an agent of a foreign government, and other illegal activities in the United States. The Five were in the U.S. to observe and infiltrate the Cuban-American groups Alpha 66, the F4 Commandos, the Cuban American National Foundation, and Brothers to the Rescue. They were part of () composed of at least 27 Cuban spies.

The Cuban government acknowledged that the five were intelligence agents in 2001, after denying it for three years. It said they were spying on Miami&#x27;s Cuban exile community, not the U.S. government. Cuba says that the men were sent to South Florida in the wake of several terrorist bombings in Havana organized by anti-communist terrorist Luis Posada Carriles, a former Central Intelligence Agency operative.

The Five appealed their convictions, and concerns about the fairness of their trial received international attention. A three-judge panel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta overturned their convictions in 2005, citing the &quot;prejudices&quot; of Miami&#x27;s anti-Castro Cubans, but the full court later denied the five&#x27;s bid for a new trial and reinstated the original convictions. In June 2009 the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the case. In Cuba, the Five are viewed as national heroes and portrayed as having sacrificed their liberty in the defense of their country.

René González was released from prison on October 7, 2011, having completed thirteen years of his sentence, with three years of probation in the U.S. remaining. He was allowed to return to Cuba for his father&#x27;s funeral on April 22, 2013, and a federal judge allowed him to stay there provided that he renounce his U.S. citizenship. Fernando González was released on February 27, 2014. The remaining members were released on December 17, 2014, in a prisoner swap with Cuba for an American intelligence officer, identified by a senior American as Rolando Sarraff Trujillo. The exchange of prisoners coincided with Cuba&#x27;s release of American contractor Alan Phillip Gross, although the governments characterized the release of Gross as being unrelated to the prisoner exchange. The release of the Cuban Five was broadly part of a temporary easing of relations between the U.S. and Cuba, known as the Cuban Thaw. 

==Background==
In 1960s and 1970s, there were several attacks against Cuban civilians by U.S.-based exile groups such as Coordination of United Revolutionary Organizations (CORU), Alpha 66, and Omega 7. In a 2001 report by Cuba&#x27;s Permanent Mission to the United Nations, the Cuban government cataloged 3,478 deaths as a result of &quot;terrorism&quot;, &quot;aggression&quot;, &quot;acts of piracy and other actions&quot;. The events cited span the course of four decades and pertain to attacks such as the bombing of Cubana Flight 455 by men trained by the Central Intelligence Agency, the CIA-supported Bay of Pigs invasion, and the Escambray Rebellion between the government and anti-communist rebels in the Escambray Mountains (see also Operation Mongoose). As a result, the Cuban government had long sought to combat these groups. Their efforts include the use of spies sent to operate in the U.S. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and other U.S. organizations had been monitoring the activities of Cuban spy suspects for more than 30 years.

==History==

===Activities===
The &quot;Cuban Five&quot; were Cuban intelligence officers who were part of &quot;La Red Avispa&quot;, or Wasp Network, which the FBI dismantled with 10 arrests in 1998.

The court found that they had infiltrated Brothers to the Rescue, a Miami-based organization that flew small aircraft over the Florida straits in efforts to rescue rafters fleeing Cuba, and had on some flights intentionally violated Cuban airspace and dropped leaflets. On February 24, 1996, two Brothers to the Rescue aircraft were shot down by Cuban military jets in international airspace while flying away from Cuban airspace, killing four U.S. citizens aboard.

The U.S. government also accused the remaining four of lying about their identities and sending 2,000 pages of unclassified information obtained from U.S. military bases to Cuba. The network received clandestine communications from Cuba via the Cuban &quot;Atención&quot; numbers station.

U.S. government organizations, including the FBI, had been monitoring Cuban spy activities for over 30 years, but made only occasional arrests. However, after the two Brothers to the Rescue aircraft were shot down by Cuban MiGs in February 1996 and four U.S. citizens were killed, on the basis of information sent to Cuba by an infiltrator of the group, the Clinton administration launched a crackdown. According to U.S. attorney José Pertierra, who acts for the Venezuelan government in its attempts to extradite Luis Posada Carriles, the crackdown was aided by the cooperation of the Cuban authorities with the FBI in 1997. The Cubans provided 175 pages of documents to FBI agents investigating Posada Carriles&#x27;s role in the 1997 bombings in Havana, but the FBI failed to use the evidence to follow up on Posada. Instead, they used it to uncover the spy network that included the Cuban Five. He was not arrested until 1998.

At least two of the agents formed romantic relationships during their deployments. One married an American woman, while another proposed during a relationship that lasted at least a decade. After the agents were exposed, the spouse in the first case sued the Cuban government for rape on the basis that sexual intercourse had been procured by fraud.

==Arrests, convictions and sentences==
All five were arrested in Miami on September 12, 1998 and were indicted by the U.S. government on 25 counts, including charges of false identification and conspiracy to commit espionage. Seven months later, Gerardo Hernández was indicted for conspiracy to commit murder in connection with the shoot-down of the Brothers to the Rescue aircraft.

The trial began in November 2000 in the U.S. District Court for Southern Florida in Miami and lasted seven months. In June 2001, the jury returned verdicts of guilty on all counts, including the charge of first-degree murder against Hernández.

In December 2001, the members of the group were sentenced to prison terms: two life terms for Hernández, to be served consecutively; life for Guerrero and Labañino; 19 years for Fernando González; and 15 years for René González. In addition, the prosecution sought the post-release deportation of the three Cuban-born members, and for the two US-born members, a post-release sentence of &quot;incapacitation&quot;, imposing specific restrictions on them after their release, which would be enforced by the FBI. The restrictions would prohibit them from &quot;associating with or visiting specific places where individuals or groups such as terrorists, members of organizations advocating violence, and organized crime figures are known to be or frequent.&quot;

In 2011, NPR reported some of the people associated with this group were imprisoned in a Communication Management Unit, a section within a federal prison that restricts and monitors all external communications.

=== Appeals ===

After the arrests, motions by the defense for a change of venue, on the basis that Miami was a venue too associated with exile Cubans, were denied, despite the fact that the trial began just five months after the heated Elian Gonzalez affair. The jury did not include any Cuban-Americans but 16 of the 160 members of the jury pool &quot;knew the victims of the shootdown or knew trial witnesses who had flown with them.&quot; On August 9, 2005, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in Atlanta unanimously overturned the convictions and sentences of the Cuban Five and ordered a new trial outside Miami, saying that the Cuban exile community and the trial publicity made the trial unfavorable and prejudicial to the defendants. This was the first time a Federal Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a trial court&#x27;s finding with respect to venue. However, on October 31, 2005 the Atlanta court agreed to a U.S. government request to review the decision, and in August 2006 the ruling for a new trial was reversed by a 10–2 vote of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeal sitting &quot;en banc&quot;. Charles R. Wilson wrote the opinion of the majority.

On June 4, 2008, a three-judge panel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the convictions of the &quot;Five&quot; but vacated and remanded for resentencing in district court the sentences of Guerrero, Labañino, and Fernando González. The court affirmed the sentences of Gerardo Hernandez and Rene Gonzalez. The court held that the sentencing judge had made six serious errors and remanded the case back to the same court. The decision was drawn up by William Pryor. In January 2009, the Five appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Twelve amicus curiae briefs were filed.

In May 2009, in response to the request for Supreme Court of the United States review of the panel decision by Judge Pryor, Solicitor General Elena Kagan, on behalf of President Barack Obama, filed a brief asking that the petition for a writ of certiorari be denied. On June 15, 2009, the Supreme Court denied review.

On October 13, 2009, Antonio Guerrero&#x27;s sentence was reduced to 21 years and 10 months. On December 8, 2009, Ramón Labañino and Fernando González&#x27;s sentences were reduced to 30 years and to 17 years and 9 months, respectively.

==== Plans for appeal ====
Cuban Five defense lawyer Leonard Weinglass died on March 23, 2011. Following his death, civil rights lawyer Martin Garbus took over the case. On June 13, 2012, Garbus held a press conference where he revealed a new strategy based upon proof that the United States government had paid numerous reporters and press outlets to create media pressure on the jurors to convict.

===International criticism of the convictions, and U.S. response===

Following their conviction, there was an international campaign for the case to be appealed. In the United States, the campaign was most conspicuously represented by the National Committee to Free the Cuban Five which was represented in twenty U.S. cities and over thirty countries.

On May 27, 2005, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights adopted a report by its Working Group on Arbitrary Detention stating its opinions on the facts and circumstances of the case and calling upon the U.S. government to remedy the situation. Among the report&#x27;s criticisms of the trial and sentences, section 29 stated:
Amnesty International criticized the U.S. treatment of the Cuban Five as &quot;unnecessarily punitive and contrary both to standards for the humane treatment of prisoners and to states&#x27; obligation to protect family life&quot;, as the wives of René Gonzáles and Gerardo Hernández were denied visas to visit their imprisoned husbands.

The U.S. Government has responded to these claims, stating that the prisoners have received over a hundred visits from family members granted visas. The government contends that the wives of González and Hernández are members of the Cuban Intelligence Directorate, and thus pose a risk to the national security of the United States:

Eight international Nobel Prize winners filed an amicus brief with the National Committee to Free the Cuban Five in 2009.

In the United Kingdom, among other actions, 110 Members of Parliament wrote an open letter to the U.S. Attorney General in support of the Five.

In April 2009, a Brazilian human rights group, Torture Never Again, awarded the Five its Chico Mendes Medal, alleging that their rights had been violated, declaring that &quot;their mail is censored and their visiting rights are very restricted.&quot;

In 2011, Brazilian writer Fernando Morais wrote &quot;The Last Soldiers of the Cold War&quot;, about the Cuban Five. The book is based on over 40 interviews and documents of the governments of United States and Cuba. Martin Garbus, the attorney representing the Cuban Five, has released a book about the case titled &quot;North of Havana, The Untold Story of Dirty Politics, Secret Diplomacy, and the Trial of the Cuban Five&quot;.

===Release===
René González was put on parole for three years starting 2011. He was allowed to return to Cuba for his father&#x27;s funeral on April 22, 2013, with the understanding that he would return to Florida to fulfill his three years of probation, but on May 3 a federal judge ruled that he could remain in Cuba provided that he renounce his United States citizenship.

In May 2012, it was reported that the U.S. had declined an exchange of prisoners proposed by the Cuban government, that would have seen the Cuban Five returned to Cuba in exchange for USAID contractor Alan Gross, imprisoned in Cuba for illegally distributing communications equipment. American officials did not consider Gross, whom they viewed as unjustly detained for a comparatively minor offense, equivalent to spies, one of whom had been convicted of murder.

Fernando González was released on February 27, 2014. He returned to Cuba and campaigned for the release of the remaining three.

As secret negotiations toward an exchange of prisoners proceeded, U.S. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, while on a trip to visit Gross in prison, met with Adriana Pérez O&#x27;Connor, whose husband Hernández was in prison for life. She asked him to arrange a way for her to become pregnant by her husband. Leahy made her case to U.S. officials, who arranged for Hernández to provide his sperm for artificial insemination. When Pérez became pregnant, officials negotiating the prisoner exchange worried that her pregnancy would make their dealings public before they were ready to announce a deal. Leahy reported that prison conditions for Gross improved after he had assisted Pérez and Hernández.

The prisoner exchange took place in December 2014 as part of a broader agreement to move toward the normalization of Cuba–United States relations. In addition to the three remaining Cubans who were returned to Cuba, Rolando Sarraff Trujillo, a Cuban who had worked as an agent for American intelligence until his arrest in November 1995 was returned to the United States. Sarraff was described as a key figure in Cuban intelligence, a cryptologist who provided the Central Intelligence Agency with information that helped the CIA arrest Cuban spies long after Sarraff&#x27;s arrest and imprisonment. The exchange of prisoners coincided with Cuba&#x27;s release of American contractor Alan Phillip Gross, jailed in Cuba since December 2009, although both governments characterized the release of Gross as unrelated to the prisoner exchange.

<doc id="498369" wikidata="Q4019305" url="?curid=498369" title="Whatever and Ever Amen">
<text>Whatever and Ever Amen is the second album by Ben Folds Five, released on March 18, 1997. Three singles were released from the album, including the lead single, &quot;Battle of Who Could Care Less&quot;, which received significant airplay on alternative radio and on MTV, and peaked at number 26 on the UK Singles Chart and number 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart, and the band&#x27;s biggest hit, &quot;Brick&quot;, which was a top-40 song in numerous countries.

A remaster was made available on March 22, 2005. All of the extra tracks had been previously released (as b-sides, soundtrack contributions, etc.) except for a cover of the Buggles song &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot;, which is a staple of Ben Folds Five&#x27;s live show.

==Title, recording and cover==
===Title===
While recording the album, Folds told the &quot;Sheffield Electronic Press&quot; in November 1996 that the album would likely either be titled &quot;Cigarette&quot; or &quot;The Little Girl With Teeth&quot;. The title &quot;Whatever and Ever Amen&quot; comes from a line in the song &quot;Battle of Who Could Care Less&quot;.

===Cover===
The album&#x27;s original cover featured individual photos of Folds, Sledge, and Jessee, along with a hand-drawn Ben Folds Five logo, and a hand-drawn &quot;Whatever and Ever Amen.&quot; The cover of the 2005 remastered version moved the album&#x27;s title from the top left corner to the center and added a fourth photo of all three bandmates sitting together.

===Recording===
The album was recorded in the front room of a house in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Folds said, &quot;You can&#x27;t go for perfection in a house. The spiritual comet of the song comes by every so often and lots of technical things are going to be going wrong when that happens. Our producer, Caleb is very good at knowing when the ghost blew through the house. People don&#x27;t buy records for the accuracy.&quot; The first release for their new label, Epic, Folds said the record company did not get to hear the recording until it was finished, saying, &quot;they knew what they were getting into.&quot;

==Track notes==
Near the end of the Nerdist podcast #132, Folds mentioned that the lyrics for &quot;Cigarette&quot; were taken from a newspaper article he claimed was about a man, Fred Jones, who &quot;felt conflicted&quot; after finding his wife had a changed personality due to a brain tumor, on the basis that she was not the same person he had married. (The article, from a 1991 edition of &quot;The Tennessean&quot;, is actually about the implanted epidural catheter procedure that brought Jones and his wife renewed peace after her years of pain.) The &quot;sequel&quot; track, &quot;Fred Jones Part Two&quot;, is on Folds&#x27; first solo album, &quot;Rockin&#x27; the Suburbs&quot;.

The track &quot;Steven&#x27;s Last Night in Town&quot; was written about Ben Folds&#x27; friend Stephen Short, a Grammy-Award-winning record producer and manager.

An early mix of &quot;Song for the Dumped&quot; appeared on the soundtrack album for the movie &quot;Mr. Wrong&quot;, but the song did not actually appear in the movie. The soundtrack was released on February 6, 1996, a full year before the release of &quot;Whatever and Ever Amen&quot;.

===Hidden tracks===
The first pressing of &quot;Whatever and Ever Amen&quot; features a clip of an actual argument in the studio between Folds, Sledge and Jessee, inserted between &quot;Brick&quot; and &quot;Song for the Dumped&quot;. Speaking to &quot;The Shrubbery&quot; in 1999, Folds said that the clip &quot;was a painfully documented real argument that kept bringing up bad feelings. We decided to get rid of it and let the first pressings be collectors ... Better to keep the band together. It was ugly.&quot;

The first pressing featured another hidden track, on the album&#x27;s last track, &quot;Evaporated&quot;, and in the negative space of track 1 on the Digitally Remastered version. The clip is at a live concert, where band roadie Leo Overtoom yells out, &quot;I&#x27;ve got your hidden track right here: Ben Folds is a fuckin&#x27; asshole!&quot; A short video clip of this is featured in the video &quot;A Video Portrait&quot; released alongside the album.

==Legacy==
Nick Hornby writes one of his essays in the book &quot;31 Songs&quot; about &quot;Smoke&quot;.

<doc id="498372" wikidata="Q360737" url="?curid=498372" title="Andrew Niccol">
<text>Andrew Niccol (born 10 June 1964) is a New Zealand screenwriter, producer, and director. He wrote and directed &quot;Gattaca&quot; (1997), &quot;Simone&quot; (2002), &quot;Lord of War&quot; (2005), &quot;In Time&quot; (2011), &quot;The Host&quot; (2013), and &quot;Good Kill&quot; (2014). He wrote and co-produced &quot;The Truman Show&quot;, which earned him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and won him the BAFTA Award in the same category. His high-concept science fiction films tend to explore social, cultural and political issues; artificial realities, simulations and the male gaze are frequent themes in his work.

His film &quot;Good Kill&quot; was selected to compete for the Golden Lion at the 71st Venice International Film Festival.

==Early and personal life==
Niccol was born in Paraparaumu, New Zealand, and grew up in Auckland, where he attended Auckland Grammar School beginning in 1973. He left New Zealand at age 21 and began directing TV ads in London, which he did for more than ten years before his directorial debut, &quot;Gattaca&quot; (1997). During production of &quot;Simone&quot;, he met model and actress Rachel Roberts, with whom he has two children, Jack, born in 2003 (who also played &quot;Young Nicolai&quot; in the 2005 film &quot;Lord of War&quot;) and Ava, born in 2008.

==Career==
===Directing===
Niccol has directed the films &quot;Gattaca&quot; (1997), &quot;Simone&quot; (2002), &quot;Lord of War&quot; (2005), &quot;In Time&quot; (2011), &quot;The Host&quot; (2013), and &quot;Good Kill&quot; (2014) (reuniting after 17 years with actor Ethan Hawke in a lead role; Hawke also appeared in &quot;Lord of War&quot; as a supporting character named Jack Valentine). He has also directed a short film entitled &quot;The Minutes&quot; (2012), which is a documentary-esque, narrative tie-in to &quot;In Time&quot; that describes in more detail the world and characters from the film.

For his directorial debut and first film (which he also wrote), &quot;Gattaca&quot; (1997), he won a Best Film award from the Sitges - Catalan International Film Festival and both a Special Jury Prize and the Fun Trophy from the Gérardmer Film Festival.

For his film &quot;Lord of War&quot; (2005), he received a Special Recognition for Excellence in Filmmaking from the National Board of Review.

In June 2021, Niccol was named as the director and writer of a film based on the Christchurch mosque shootings called &quot;They Are Us&quot;. The filmmakers&#x27; choice to focus on Ardern&#x27;s response rather than the victims generated criticism within New Zealand. In response to public backlash, Niccols confirmed that the film&#x27;s development had been put on hold until a full consultation with the New Zealand Muslim community had been conducted.

===Writing and producing===
Niccol&#x27;s breakthrough screenplay was his script for the film &quot;The Truman Show&quot; (1998), directed by Peter Weir and starring Jim Carrey. He also served as a producer on the film. The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay (Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen) and a Golden Globes nomination for Best Screenplay in 1999 and won a BAFTA award for Best Screenplay, a Saturn Award for Best Writing or Best Writer, an Awards Circuit Community Award for Best Original Screenplay and Best Motion Picture, a Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (shared with Peter Weir), and an Online Film Critics Society Award for Best Original Screenplay.

<text>In biology, an identification key, taxonomic key, or frequently just key, is a printed or computer-aided device that aids in the identification of biological organisms.

Historically, the most common type of identification key is the dichotomous key, a type of single-access key which offers a fixed sequence of identification steps, each with two alternatives. The earliest examples of identification keys originate in the seventeenth, but their conceptual history can be traced back to antiquity. Modern multi-access keys allow the user to freely choose the identification steps and any order. They were traditionally performed using punched cards but now almost exclusively take the form of computer programs.

== History ==

The conceptual origins of the modern identification key can be traced back to antiquity. Theophrastus categorized organisms into &quot;subdivisions&quot; based on dichotomous characteristics. The seventeenth-century Chinese herbalist, Pao Shan, in his treatise &quot;Yeh-ts&#x27;ai Po-Iu&quot;, included a systematic categorization of plants based on their apparent characteristics specifically for the purposes of identification.

Seventeenth-century naturalists, including John Ray, Rivinius, and Nehemiah Grew, published examples of bracketed tables. However, these examples were not strictly keys in the modern sense of an analytical device used to identify a single specimen, since they often did not lead to a single end point, and instead functioned more as synopses of classification schemes.

The first analytical identification key is credited to Lamarck who included several in his 1778 book, &quot;Flore Françoise.&quot; Lamarck&#x27;s key follows more or less the same design as the modern dichotomous, bracketed key.

Alphonso Wood was the first American to use identification keys in 1845. Other early instances of keys are found in the works of Asa Gray and W. H. Evans.

=== Terminology ===
Identification keys are known historically and contemporarily by many names, including analytical key, entomological key, artificial key, diagnostic key, determinator, and taxonomic key

Within the biological literature, identification keys are referred to simply as &quot;keys&quot;. They are also commonly referred to in general as dichotomous keys, though this term strictly refers to a specific type of identification key (see Types of keys).

== Use ==
Identification keys are used in systematic biology and taxonomy to identify the genus or species of a specimen organism from a set of known taxa. They are commonly used in the fields of microbiology, plant taxonomy, and entomology, as groups of related taxa in these fields tend to be very large. However, they have also been used to classify non-organisms, such as birds nests, and in non-biological sciences such as geology. Similar methods have also been used in computer science

A user of a key selects from a series of choices, representing mutually exclusive features of the specimen, with the aim to arrive at the sole remaining identity from the group of taxa. Each step in the key employs a &quot;character&quot;: a distinguishing feature of an organism that is conveniently observable.

== Types of keys ==
Identification keys are sometimes also referred to as &quot;artificial keys&quot; to differential them from other diagrams that visualize a classification schemes, often in the form of a key or tree structure. These diagrams are called &quot;natural keys&quot; or &quot;synopses&quot; and are not used for identifying specimens. In contrast, an artificial identification key is a tool that utilizes characters that are the easiest to observe and most practical for arriving at an identity. Identification keys can be divided into two main types.

=== Single-access key ===
A single-access key (also called a sequential key or an analytical key), has a fixed structure and sequence. The user must begin at the first step of the key and proceed until the end. A single-access key has steps that consist of two mutually exclusive statements (&quot;leads&quot;) is called a &quot;dichotomous key&quot;. Most single-access keys are dichotomous. A single-access key with more than two leads per step is referred to as &quot;polytomous.&quot;

==== Presentational variants ====
Dichotomous keys can be presented in two main styles: linked and nested. In the linked style (also referred to as &quot;open,&quot; &quot;parallel, linked, and juxtaposition&quot;), each pair of leads (called a &quot;couplet&quot;) are printed together. In the nested style (also referred to as &quot;closed,&quot; &quot;yoked, and indented&quot;), the subsequent steps after choosing a lead are printed directly underneath it, in succession. To follow the second lead of the couplet, the user must skip over the nested material that follows logically from the first lead of the couplet. Nested keys are more commonly known as &quot;indented&quot;, but unfortunately this refers to an accidental (albeit frequent) rather than essential quality. Nested keys may be printed without indentation to preserve space (relying solely on corresponding lead symbols) and linked keys may be indented to enhance the visibility of the couplet structure.

=== Multi-access keys ===
A multi-access key (free-access key, or polyclave) allows a user to specify characters in any order. Therefore, a multi-access key can be thought of as &quot;the set of all possible single-access keys that arise by permutating the order of characters.&quot; While there are print versions of multi-access keys, they were historically created using punched card systems. Today, multi-access keys are computer-aided tools.

==Key construction==

An early attempt to standardize the construction of keys was offered by E. B. Williamson in the June 1922 volume of Science. More recently, Richard Pankhurst published a guidelines and practical tips for key construction in a section of his 1978 book, &quot;Biological Identification.&quot;

Identification errors may have serious consequences in both pure and applied disciplines, including ecology, medical diagnosis, pest control, forensics, etc.

=== Computer-aided key construction ===
The first computer programs for constructing identification keys were created in the early 1970s. Since then, several popular programs have been developed, including DELTA, XPER, and LucID.

Single-access keys, until recently, have been developed only rarely as computer-aided, interactive tools. Noteworthy developments in this area are the commercial LucID Phoenix application, the FRIDA/Dryades software, the &quot;KeyToNature&quot; Open Key Editor, and the open source WikiKeys and jKey application on biowikifarm.

<doc id="498383" wikidata="Q10167591" url="?curid=498383" title="Initial value problem">
<text>In multivariable calculus, an initial value problem (IVP) is an ordinary differential equation together with an initial condition which specifies the value of the unknown function at a given point in the domain. Modeling a system in physics or other sciences frequently amounts to solving an initial value problem. In that context, the differential initial value is an equation which specifies how the system evolves with time given the initial conditions of the problem.

== Definition ==
An initial value problem is a differential equation
:formula_1 with formula_2 where formula_3 is an open set of formula_4,
together with a point in the domain of formula_5
:formula_6
called the initial condition.

A solution to an initial value problem is a function formula_7 that is a solution to the differential equation and satisfies
:formula_8

In higher dimensions, the differential equation is replaced with a family of equations formula_9, and formula_10 is viewed as the vector formula_11, most commonly associated with the position in space. More generally, the unknown function formula_7 can take values on infinite dimensional spaces, such as Banach spaces or spaces of distributions.

Initial value problems are extended to higher orders by treating the derivatives in the same way as an independent function, e.g. formula_13.

== Existence and uniqueness of solutions ==

The Picard–Lindelöf theorem guarantees a unique solution on some interval containing &quot;t&quot;0 if &quot;f&quot; is continuous on a region containing &quot;t&quot;0 and &quot;y&quot;0 and satisfies the Lipschitz condition on the variable &quot;y&quot;.
The proof of this theorem proceeds by reformulating the problem as an equivalent integral equation. The integral can be considered an operator which maps one function into another, such that the solution is a fixed point of the operator. The Banach fixed point theorem is then invoked to show that there exists a unique fixed point, which is the solution of the initial value problem.

An older proof of the Picard–Lindelöf theorem constructs a sequence of functions which converge to the solution of the integral equation, and thus, the solution of the initial value problem. Such a construction is sometimes called &quot;Picard&#x27;s method&quot; or &quot;the method of successive approximations&quot;. This version is essentially a special case of the Banach fixed point theorem.

Hiroshi Okamura obtained a necessary and sufficient condition for the solution of an initial value problem to be unique. This condition has to do with the existence of a Lyapunov function for the system.

In some situations, the function &quot;f&quot; is not of class &quot;C&quot;1, or even Lipschitz, so the usual result guaranteeing the local existence of a unique solution does not apply. The Peano existence theorem however proves that even for &quot;f&quot; merely continuous, solutions are guaranteed to exist locally in time; the problem is that there is no guarantee of uniqueness. The result may be found in Coddington &amp; Levinson (1955, Theorem 1.3) or Robinson (2001, Theorem 2.6). An even more general result is the Carathéodory existence theorem, which proves existence for some discontinuous functions &quot;f&quot;.

==Examples==
A simple example is to solve formula_14 and formula_15. We are trying to find a formula for formula_10 that satisfies these two equations.

Rearrange the equation so that formula_7 is on the left hand side

: formula_18

Now integrate both sides with respect to formula_19 (this introduces an unknown constant formula_20).

: formula_21
: formula_22

Eliminate the logarithm with exponentiation on both sides

: formula_23

Let formula_24 be a new unknown constant, formula_25, so

: formula_26

Now we need to find a value for formula_24. Use formula_15 as given at the start and substitute 0 for formula_19 and 19 for formula_7

: formula_31
: formula_32

this gives the final solution of formula_33.

;Second example
The solution of

: formula_34

can be found to be

: formula_35

Indeed,

: formula_36
Third example

The solution of

formula_37
formula_38

formula_39

Applying initial conditions we get formula_40, hence the solution:

formula_41. 
However, the following function is also a solution of the initial value problem:

formula_42

The function is differentiable everywhere and continuous, while satisfying the differential equation as well as the initial value problem. Thus, this is an example of such a problem with infinite number of solutions.

<text>The Pere Marquette Railway was a railroad that operated in the Great Lakes region of the United States and southern parts of Ontario in Canada. It had trackage in the states of Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, and the Canadian province of Ontario. Its primary connections included Buffalo; Toledo; and Chicago. 
The company was named after Jacques Marquette, a French Jesuit missionary who founded Michigan&#x27;s first European settlement, Sault Ste Marie.

== History ==

The Pere Marquette was incorporated on November 1, 1899, in anticipation of a merger of three Michigan-based railroad companies that had been agreed upon by all parties. It began operations on January 1, 1900, absorbing the following companies:
* Flint &amp; Pere Marquette Railroad (F&amp;PM)
* Detroit, Grand Rapids &amp; Western Railroad (DGR&amp;W)
* Chicago &amp; West Michigan Railway (C&amp;WM)

The first shop facilities were inherited from the Flint and Pere Marquette in Saginaw, Michigan. However, the city of Grand Rapids, Michigan was chosen as the primary repair facility for rolling stock in 1905, which became known as the Wyoming Shops after the neighborhood in which they were located. Wyoming Yard was one of the system&#x27;s primary freight classification yards. The shops were renovated and expanded in 1923 after those of Saginaw were downgraded, and converted to service diesel engines in 1946. The massive roundhouse began to be slowly demolished in the 1970s and finally removed completely by CSX by 1984.

The company was reincorporated on March 12, 1917, as the Pere Marquette Railway. In the 1920s the Pere Marquette came under the control of Cleveland financiers Oris and Mantis Van Sweringen. These brothers also controlled the New York, Chicago &amp; St. Louis Railroad (Nickel Plate), the Erie Railroad and the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway, and planned to merge the four companies. However, the ICC did not approve the merger and the Van Sweringens eventually sold their interest in the Pere Marquette to the C&amp;O in 1929. The company continued to operate separately as the Pere Marquette Railway until being fully merged into the C&amp;O on June 6, 1947. Forty years later, the C&amp;O was absorbed into CSX Transportation.

In 1984, Amtrak named its passenger train between Chicago and Grand Rapids, Michigan, the &quot;Pere Marquette&quot;.

The train in the 2004 film &quot;The Polar Express&quot; was modeled after steam locomotive Pere Marquette 1225. The film also included audio recordings of the locomotive in operation. It is the locomotive that Chris Van Allsburg said was the inspiration for the book, having seen it as a child when it was on the Michigan State University campus. The locomotive was scheduled to be at the premiere in Grand Rapids, where the writer was born, but was canceled because of interferences with the schedule of CSX. It is now housed and maintained at the Steam Railroading Institute in Owosso, Michigan.

=== Surviving steam locomotives ===

* PM 1223 - 2-8-4 &quot;Berkshire&quot; displayed at Chinook Pier in Grand Haven, Michigan. PM 1223 is the oldest surviving example of the 2-8-4s in America.
* PM 1225 - 2-8-4 &quot;Berkshire&quot; operational by the Steam Railroading Institute in Owosso, Michigan. PM 1225 appears in the motion-capture form in the 2004 Christmas movie &quot;The Polar Express.&quot;

== 1907 wreck ==
On July 20, 1907, an excursion train carrying 800 passengers from Ionia to Detroit collided near Salem with a freight train, killing 31 and injuring 101. The accident apparently happened because of a hand-written schedule on unlined paper whose columns did not line up, and was misread by the freight crew. The Interstate Commerce Commission investigation also cited safety violations, including use of pine instead of oak for car walls and the omission of steel plates required for mail cars. This was Michigan&#x27;s worst rail disaster.

== Routes and current disposition ==

* Toledo Division – Saginaw, Michigan, to Alexis and (via trackage rights over Ann Arbor Railroad) Toledo, Ohio (In use by CSX Transportation south of Plymouth, leased to Lake State Railway north of Plymouth)
* Ludington Division – Saginaw to Ludington, Michigan (Partially now part of the Pere Marquette Rail-Trail, between Baldwin and Ludington in use with Marquette Rail, and Saginaw to Midland used by Lake State Railway Company, with the rest of the line removed in 1991; the ferry closed in 1990)
* Detroit Division – Detroit to Grand Rapids, Michigan (In use by CSX)
* Grand Rapids Division – Elmdale, Michigan, to Saginaw (Alma-Saginaw in use by Mid-Michigan Railroad)
* Chicago Division – Grand Rapids to Porter, Indiana, and (via trackage rights over various lines) Chicago (In use by CSX)
** La Crosse Branch – New Buffalo, Michigan, to La Crosse, Indiana (Abandoned north of Wellsboro, Indiana, by C&amp;O in 1989, most tracks removed; Wellsboro to La Crosse in use by the Chesapeake and Indiana Railroad)
* Petoskey Division – Grand Rapids to Bay View, Michigan, was the basis for the Pere Marquette&#x27;s longest route, the Chicago and Detroit-Bay View &quot;Resort Special.&quot; (In use by Marquette Rail between Grand Rapids and Manistee and by the Great Lakes Central Railroad between Grawn and Williamsburg, with the rest dismantled in 1983 after being abandoned by C&amp;O in 1982)
* Canadian Division – Lines in Canada, including Windsor, Ontario, and Sarnia, Ontario, via Blenheim, Ontario, to St. Thomas, Ontario, and St Thomas east to Buffalo, New York, via trackage rights over the Canada Southern (Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway trackage rights over CASO from Welland, Ontario, to Buffalo via Niagara Falls, Ontario).
* Saginaw Subdivisions – Saginaw to Port Huron, Michigan, via two routes and to Bay City, Michigan (Mostly abandoned between 1951 and 1988, some sections in use with the Huron and Eastern Railway)

== Car ferries ==

The Pere Marquette operated a number of rail car ferries on the Detroit and St. Clair rivers and on Lake Erie and Lake Michigan. The PM&#x27;s fleet of car ferries, which operated on Lake Michigan from Ludington, Michigan, to Milwaukee, Kewaunee, and Manitowoc, Wisconsin (see SS Badger), were an important transportation link avoiding the terminal and interchange delays around the southern tip of Lake Michigan and through Chicago. Their superintendent for over 30 years was William L. Mercereau.

=== Pere Marquette 18 ===

On September 10, 1910, the SS Pere Marquette No. 18 was bound for Milwaukee from Ludington, Michigan, with a load of 29 railroad freight cars and 62 people on board. Near midnight, the vessel began to take on massive amounts of water. The captain dumped nine railroad cars into Lake Michigan in a failed attempt to prevent the ship from sinking. The SS Pere Marquette 17, traveling nearby, picked up the distress call and sped to assist the distressed vessel. Shortly after SS Pere Marquette 17 arrived, the Pere Marquette 18 sank, resulting in the loss of 29 out of 62 total people onboard.
The location of the wreck was unknown until July 23, 2020 when shipwreck hunters Ken Merryman and Jerry Eliason confirmed the location using sonar and drop cameras at a depth of approximately 500 feet (152 meters).
