<text>Sheila James Kuehl (born February 9, 1941) is an American politician and retired actress, who served as a member of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors for the 3rd District from 2014 to 2022. Kuehl was California&#x27;s first openly gay state legislator, having previously served in the California State Senate and the California State Assembly, where she was the Assembly&#x27;s first female speaker pro tem.

== Early life ==
Kuehl was born Sheila Ann Kuehl in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Her father, Arthur, was an airplane construction worker at Douglas Aircraft. He was Catholic and her mother, Lillian, was Jewish. As a child actress, Kuehl performed under the stage name Sheila James.

At age seven, Kuehl began to take tap dancing lessons. In one recital, Kuehl played an assistant in a skit called &quot;The Old Sleuth&quot; where she sat under a table listening for clues. To indicate she was listening, Kuehl made faces, which caused the audience to laugh and encouraged her to make more faces, resulting in more laughter. The skit was ruined, but the drama teacher, Mrs. Meglin, was impressed. Kuehl later recalled that Meglin told her mother, &#x27;The kid&#x27;s pretty funny. Can she read?&#x27; And my mother said, &#x27;Oh, yeah, she can read, she skipped two grades, she&#x27;s really very good.&#x27; Mrs. Meglin said, &#x27;There&#x27;s a radio series holding interviews...at an agent&#x27;s office on Sunset Boulevard. Would you be interested in taking her to the interview? All she has to do is read...&#x27;
So we went for the interview and there were like 150 or 200 kids there and all you did was read. And I was called back...and eventually I got the part in what probably was the last family radio series before it went all music and news...&#x27;&quot;

== Career ==
=== Radio ===
Having landed the role at the age of eight, Kuehl (billed as Sheila James) starred with radio and film veterans Penny Singleton, Gale Gordon, Bea Benaderet, and Jim Backus on the family radio program &quot;The Penny Williamson Show&quot; airing live from Studio B of the NBC studios in Hollywood. Airing in the adjacent studios were the popular drama &quot;The Cisco Kid&quot; and &quot;The Bob Hope Show&quot; with Doris Day (whom Kuehl admired). Kuehl would later cite her interaction with the other NBC radio talent as influential in forming her professionalism and comedy skills. The show centered around Singleton playing Penny Williamson, a widow selling real estate in a small town to support two daughters (played by Kuehl and Mary Lee Robb). The show was &quot;a light-hearted pitch for women&#x27;s liberation, portraying Penny and her daughters as highly competent, self-sufficient females&quot; dealing with bungling suitors competing for Penny&#x27;s affections.

=== Television ===
Due to her radio talent, Kuehl&#x27;s agent convinced her parents to take her to auditions for a television role. Kuehl was signed to play Jackie, Stuart Erwin&#x27;s tomboy daughter, in the television series &quot;The Stu Erwin Show&quot; (also known as &quot;Trouble with Father&quot;), which ran from 1950 to 1955. Kuehl later recalled &quot;The same 200 kids I think were there for the interview [as had been for the radio audition] and I was called back and called back and called back and eventually I got that part. And beginning in 1950, I did that series for six years.&quot;

After &quot;The Stu Erwin Show&quot; ended, Kuehl continued to work as an actress while going to school. Her academic success allowed her to skip two grades; by sixteen she was attending the University of California, Los Angeles. As her college studies continued she moved into a sorority house and began spending summers as a counsellor for a children&#x27;s camp. At the age of eighteen, while working at the camp, Kuehl met a twenty-one year-old counsellor named Kathy and fell in love. Kuehl would later recall &quot;It was just a funny attraction that neither of us would acknowledge. Then, one night she and I were sitting together at her place. She was rubbing my back and we just, like, went to bed. It was wonderful. But then we stayed up all night wondering if we were really sick.&quot; They concluded that they were &quot;sick&quot; but that nothing could be done. Kuehl later recalled &quot;There was no movement then. There was nothing to read. I knew no lesbians. We just figured this was a rare thing and that we were two women who&#x27;d fallen in love and that we had to keep it a secret because nobody would approve. We didn&#x27;t dare tell a soul.&quot; After that summer, with Kathy going to school in San Diego, the two exchanged passionate letters daily for a year.

====&quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot;====
During this time, Kuehl began acting the role for which she is probably best known – her portrayal of teen-aged genius Zelda Gilroy, the would-be girlfriend of the title character in the television series &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot;, which aired on CBS from 1959 to 1963. Zelda was originally intended to be a one-shot character in the early &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot; episode &quot;Love is a Science,&quot; but &quot;Dobie&quot; creator Max Shulman liked Kuehl and had her signed on as a semiregular cast member.

Kuehl later recalled how she landed the part. &quot;Well, when you&#x27;re an actor with an agent, no matter how old you are, you go on interviews. I went on lots of interviews for lots of guest shots... and I had done two [episodes] on &quot;Love that Bob&quot; [&quot;The Bob Cummings Show&quot;] with Bob Cummings and Dwayne Hickman, who played his nephew, and the director Rod Amateau, so I had met all the people who eventually were going to be much of the team for &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot;. In 1959, I was at UCLA, and I went on an interview for &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot; and I walked on the set and they all said, &#x27;Oh, hi, we know your work, you&#x27;re fine. Just go across the street and meet Max Schulman [the writer director].&#x27; As it turned out, Max and I were the same height, and he was like buried behind the desk when I walked in. And he said, &#x27;What&#x27;s the first line?&#x27; And I said, &#x27;I love you.&#x27; And he said, &#x27;You&#x27;re hired!&#x27;&quot;

Signing a contract with &quot;Dobie&quot; producer 20th Century Fox Television required Kuehl, then 18 and in college studying theater, to change her major to English, so that Shulman, also a successful author, could act as her proctor on set to allow her to continue her studies. Kuehl earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English from the University of California at Los Angeles in 1962, during the show&#x27;s final season.

Having signed a contract in 1960 to do 21 shows for the next season of &quot;Dobie&quot;, that same year Kuehl was elected an officer in both the university student government and in her sorority. Despite this success, things became difficult that summer when love letters to Kathy that she had accidentally left at the sorority house were found by the cleaning staff and turned over to the alumnae council of the sorority. When she returned from summer vacation, the council (while speaking in coded language and carefully avoiding the word &quot;lesbian&quot;) confronted Kuehl with the letters demanding an explanation. Kuehl later recalled that at first, she tried to deny it and failing that, &quot;I then just clammed up and took my sorority pin off and put it on the table and left. I cried all the way home.&quot; She was officially expelled from the sorority and despite assurance that no one would be told why, she was aware that rumors were spreading. Some of the members of the sorority refused to speak to her afterwards and avoided her. Kuehl moved back in with her parents under the cover story that she was homesick, but was still a member of the sorority of which they knew she loved being a part. Whenever her parents knew of a sorority meeting taking place, to prevent discovery, Kuehl would go to a coffee shop during that time and return with a story about the events of the meeting that she had not attended.

Despite Kathy moving to Los Angeles and their being able to see each other daily, the social sacrifices Kuehl was contemplating put a strain on their relationship. Kuehl later recalled, &quot;By then, the whole idea of being queer was so overwhelming and scary. Not the sexuality, but the loss of everything. To be that way for good meant no family, no children, no career, nor normalcy, no parents. It seemed at that point that I should really get out of it. I told [Kathy] I didn&#x27;t want to see her any longer.&quot; Kuehl had seen a man casually on and off during her relationship with Kathy and began working to make it more serious. They kissed, but they did not have sex and they almost got engaged. Kuehl could not get Kathy off her mind and broke up with the man to resume the relationship with her. Kuehl&#x27;s closeted relationship with Kathy continued until the beginning of the 1970s, and had lasted 12 years before they broke up.

After &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot; ended its run, Kuehl (as &quot;Sheila James&quot;) co-starred with Kathleen Nolan, formerly of &quot;The Real McCoys&quot;, in the short-lived ABC television series &quot;Broadside&quot;, a female version of &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot;, in its 1964–65 season.

Opportunities for acting work steadily diminished and Kuehl was forced to sell her Malibu house. She later recalled this period, saying, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t even get a commercial.&quot; Due to worries about her career and being closeted, she fell into a serious depression and developed a drinking problem. She was able to move forward after seeking help. She then moved in with her then-girlfriend, Kathy, and began working at the UCLA student activities office helping students organize around the rising political movements of the 1960s.

Kuehl made television guest appearances on &quot;National Velvet&quot;; &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot;; &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot;; &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;; &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;; &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie &amp; Harriet&quot;; &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot;; and &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; from 1963 to 1970. On &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;, Kuehl joined the Bradley sisters in a band called The Ladybugs, which was created to compete with Beatlemania. Kuehl, along with Jeannine Riley, Pat Woodell, and Linda Kaye Henning appeared as moptop singers performing &quot;I Saw Him Standing There&quot; on a March 1964 episode of Sullivan&#x27;s show, just weeks after the Beatles had performed &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot;.

By the end of the decade, acting roles had dried up for her. Though Kuehl &quot;can&#x27;t state with certainty that she was blacklisted&quot; from further acting jobs over her sexuality, she claims that afterwards, &quot;with few exceptions, the phone stopped ringing.&quot; A pilot for a &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot; spin-off, in which the character Zelda was the lead, was produced, but the president of CBS, Jim Aubrey, thought Kuehl was &quot;too butch&quot; to be a star for their network. Subsequently, the pilot was not promoted and did not sell, but Kuehl was not told about this immediately. Rather, she was informed by the director, Rod Amateau, when she arrived to shoot the following episodes. She was devastated by the news.

Kuehl&#x27;s only acting roles beyond 1970 were in two &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot; reunion projects - a 1977 sitcom pilot produced by James Komack, &quot;Whatever Happened to Dobie Gillis?&quot;, and a 1988 television movie sequel, &quot;Bring Me the Head of Dobie Gillis&quot;. In both productions, Dobie had married Zelda and the two were running the Gillis family grocery store and raising a teenaged son named Georgie Gillis.

Reflecting on the lasting impact of her role as Zelda, Kuehl told an interviewer, &quot;First, there were no smart girls on television, period. All the girls were better looking than me, but dumb. I didn&#x27;t mean the actresses were dumb, but that was sort of what you had to be in those days. So, a smart girl, brash, did not know she was a loser, which was sort of the theme for all the characters on &quot;Dobie Gillis&quot;…you just keep doing what you are doing because you don&#x27;t know there&#x27;s anything wrong with you. And the other thing, of course, 20 years later I started getting letters from young women saying, &#x27;You were such a role model for me,&#x27; and now that the women&#x27;s movement had started, I could see why. An independent, smart girl, knew what she wanted, went after it, but not in a mean way. And always by the end of the show, if you were doing anything dishonest against your friends, you would repent, because friendship was always the most important thing.&quot;

=== Law ===
After leaving the acting profession in the early 1970s, Kuehl became an adviser to students in campus activist groups at her alma mater, UCLA, and eventually became an associate dean of students. When Kuehl was passed over for a promotion that was given to a man, Kuehl felt that her treatment had been unfair and became interested in a legal career to address the position of women in the workplace.

In 1975, at age 34, after being denied admission into UCLA, Kuehl was accepted at Harvard Law School. In her third year she was elected class marshal and president of the student council. She received her J.D. in 1978. During her final year, she chaired the celebration of the 25th anniversary of the first group of women to be admitted to the law school, and became the second woman to win Harvard&#x27;s prestigious Ames Moot Court Competition, judged by a panel including Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. Kuehl recalled that the Justice &quot;strode over to me, clasped my hand in his two huge hands and said, &#x27;Lady, I like your style.&#x27;&quot; Kuehl was recognized in the ABA&#x27;s Law Student Division magazine as one of the nation&#x27;s top five law students.

It was while at Harvard that Kuehl came to grips with her sexuality. She later recalled: 

After law school, Kuehl became an associate at Richards, Watson &amp; Gershon in Los Angeles, where her practice focused on municipal law. She later became an associate at Bersch &amp; Kaplowitz in Beverly Hills, practicing family, anti-discrimination, and civil rights law.

While working in private practice in Los Angeles Kuehl began fund-raising for the Sojourn Center for Battered Women (which she eventually served as chair). Staff from other shelters soon began asking Kuehl for legal advice and training in domestic-violence law. Kuehl later recalled this time saying &quot;I had to learn what there was, which wasn&#x27;t much.&quot; She then joined a handful of other lawyers in trying to assist in crafting legislation on the issue which included a bill that required judges in custody cases to consider evidence of domestic violence.

In the 1980s Kuehl became an adjunct law professor at the University of Southern California, and later an associate professor at Loyola Law School where she taught courses on family law, sex discrimination, and education.

During her 1986 inauguration as president of the Women Lawyers&#x27; Association of Los Angeles, Kuehl introduced Torie Osborn as her partner in the same manner that previous presidents had introduced their husbands. The incident became the lead story of California&#x27;s daily law journal. (The pair would later separate in 1991, but remained close friends).

In 1989, along with Abby Leibman and Jenifer McKenna, Kuehl formed the California Women&#x27;s Law Center to promote gender issues, including expanding the rights of divorced women and reforming hiring procedures in male-dominated professions, such as law enforcement.

== California State Assembly ==
Kuehl was elected to the California State Assembly in 1994, becoming the first openly gay person elected to the California legislature. While running for office, Kuehl found she was able to offset some negative stereotypes people had about lesbians thanks to their familiarity with her role as Zelda. She told an interviewer, &quot;When people know gay people personally, they tend to feel differently about the whole community. And all of a sudden, here&#x27;s a person that they knew very well that they found out was lesbian.&quot;

In office, Kuehl became a founding member of the California Legislative LGBT Caucus. She recalled &quot;My Democratic colleagues were enormously welcoming. I mean it was more than I could have expected. I walked into my first Democratic caucus and Antonio Villaraigosa, Kevin Murray, Barbara Friedman, John Burton, and probably three or four other folks came up to me and said, &#x27;We don&#x27;t want you to have to eat lunch by yourself, so we are the honorary Gay and Lesbian Caucus.&#x27; It was lovely.&quot;

When Kuehl was elected as a Democrat to the California Assembly in 1994, a Republican majority was seated for the first time in 20 years. This was due largely as an out-flowing of the enthusiasm stoked up by Newt Gingrich&#x27;s strategy supporting Republicans for congressional and senatorial seats. Kuehl recalled, &quot;The Republican majority was quite a different kind of Republican, not a moderate, not a Rockefeller Republican. They were primarily Bible-thumpers and very right-wing. So, it was not the most welcoming Republican group, though they loved Zelda Gilroy, and it was very difficult for them because they already liked me so much…. And to their surprise, we all got along very well. ...The Republicans were pretty horrible about LGBT stuff. They all virtually said stuff like, &#x27;Well, they&#x27;re all spawn of the devil, oh, but not you, Sheila….&#x27;&quot;

One of the first acts Kuehl did while in the Assembly was to introduce a bill (The Dignity for All Students Act – AB 222) to protect public-school students from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The bill was supported by most of her fellow Democrats whom Kuehl later recalled were brought &quot;into a space where they were in a civil rights movement where they had never been at their age and they were feeling it and felt good about themselves when they would stand up and support me.&quot; The debate was cited by the media, such as the LA Times, for its moving speeches, most notably Assemblyman Tom Torlakson&#x27;s support of the bill which included a here-to unknown revelation that his brother had been bisexual and died of AIDS. The bill failed to pass the Assembly by one vote (it was opposed by 37 lawmakers, including seven Democrats). Supporters of the bill blamed &quot;a state-wide public relations campaign by anti-gay groups aimed at moderate Democrats&quot; which &quot;featured mailers, newspaper ads and protests largely targeted at Latino lawmakers.&quot; Kuehl&#x27;s opponents also held that the &quot;proposal would open the door to a sweeping gay agenda in public schools.&quot; Republican Assemblyman Bruce Thompson claimed the bill wasn&#x27;t about &quot;civil rights, but it&#x27;s about special rights [for homosexuals],&quot; and it&#x27;s &quot;the issue that will divide this state and country more than any other.&quot;

While in the assembly, Kuehl served as speaker pro tempore during the 1997–98 legislative session, becoming the first woman in California history to hold the position. Kuehl served three full terms (six years) in the California Assembly, which was the maximum allowed under term limits that had been adopted in 1990.

== California State Senate ==
After three terms in the Assembly, she was elected to the California State Senate in 2000, beating Assemblyman Wally Knox in the Democratic primary and becoming the first openly gay person elected to the Senate. Re-elected in 2004 with 65.7% of the vote, she was repeatedly voted the &quot;smartest&quot; member of the California Legislature.

In 2002 Kuehl co-authored the Religious Freedom and Civil Marriage Protection Act that defined marriage as a civil contract between two persons. The bill went on to pass the state legislature – the first time a state legislative body in the USA voted to approve same-sex marriage rather than respond to a court order to do so. The bill was vetoed on September 7, 2005, by Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. who held that the matter should be decided by the courts or by popular referendum.

In 2004, Gavin Newsom, the mayor of San Francisco, held that denying homosexuals the right to marry was a violation of the due process clause in the California Constitution and allowed them to go forward (until a later Court order was made). After the mayor&#x27;s announcement Kuehl presided over a number of same-sex marriages on the steps of San Francisco&#x27;s City Hall rotunda. Among those whose wedding she officiated was Assemblymember Jackie Goldberg (who authored AB 205, a sweeping domestic partner benefits law) and her partner for twenty-eight years Sharon Stricker (a poet and activist). The couple&#x27;s newly married son and daughter-in-law were in attendance. Kuehl also officiated over the weddings of Torie Osborn and her partner, Lydia Vaias; Jehan Agrama and Dwora Fried; Patti Giggans and Ellen Ledley; Barrie Levy and Linda Garnets; and Avi Rose and Ron Strochlic. Assemblymember Mark Leno (who had recently introduced a bill to change the family code to allow marriage equality) also attended the ceremonies giving a blessing in English and Hebrew to the couples.

Also in 2004, Kuehl authored Senate Bill 1234, an omnibus act intended to protect Californians from hate crimes, which the bill defined as criminal acts committed in whole or in part because of the victims&#x27; actual or perceived disability, gender, nationality, race or ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation or association with persons with any of those characteristics. The bill targeted crimes, not First Amendment-protected speech. It also protected undocumented immigrants from deportation due to reporting hate crimes, increased civil protections from discrimination, and provided for law enforcement training concerning crimes against homeless persons and law enforcement response to homelessness; the bill was later enacted into law.

In 2006, Kuehl sponsored a bill to prohibit the adoption by any school district in California of any instructional material that discriminates against persons based on their gender or sexual orientation.

Throughout her career as a legislator, Kuehl took a leadership role on health care policy. Her foremost objective was securing passage of legislation to establish a single-payer health care system in California. SB 840 passed both houses of the legislature in 2006, but was vetoed by Schwarzenegger; it was reintroduced in 2007. SB 840 passed both houses of the California legislature in August 2008 and was, again, vetoed by Schwarzenegger.

On January 28, 2008, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Kuehl planned to vote against a health care plan sponsored by Governor Schwarzenegger and supported by a majority of Democrats in the Assembly, while opposed by a majority of Republicans. Her opposition along with the opposition of Senator Leland Yee led the &quot;Times&quot; to predict that California&#x27;s widely touted healthcare bill – widely but inaccurately called &quot;universal&quot; coverage – would be effectively killed. However, by the time the bill came to the Senate Health Committee, chaired by Kuehl, all but one of the Democratic Senators on the committee had grave doubts about the bill and, after an eleven-hour hearing on the bill and an intervening week to caucus, on January 28, 2008, one Democrat voted yes, three abstained and three (including Kuehl), along with all Republicans, voted in opposition.

During her time in the state Legislature Kuehl authored bills pertaining to domestic violence, child support services, family leave, and discrimination based on gender, disability and sexual orientation. Later when speaking to an interviewer she reflected &quot;I was a women&#x27;s rights attorney and a law professor. My interest was primarily issues of equality on the basis of gender, whether it was workplace discrimination, protection from domestic violence and sexual assault, child care, custody issues for married women. That was my area of expertise, so we started with that. I had participated in writing virtually all of the domestic violence laws, and then brought bills to expand them once I was [in Sacramento]. I knew, that as the only gay person, it would fall to me to bring protective bills. And I chose the most difficult one first, because anything having to do with children is a flashpoint for the opposition. And so it was very difficult.&quot;

Kuehl served in the California Senate for two terms (eight years) the maximum allowed under term limits adopted in 1990.

== Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors ==
On November 4, 2014, Supervisor Kuehl was elected to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. She assumed office on December 1, 2014, thus becoming the first openly LGBTQ person to ever serve on the Board. As the representative of Los Angeles County&#x27;s 3rd Supervisorial District, she serves nearly two million residents, and is responsible for managing 431 square miles of land stretching from the Pacific ocean to Los Feliz, and from Venice up to San Fernando. In 2018, she served as chair of the Board of Supervisors.

In her capacity as Supervisor, she served as chair of the Board of Commissioners of First 5 LA, First Vice Chair of the board of directors of LA Metro, and sat on the Board of the new Community Choice Aggregation (CCA) known as the Clean Power Alliance.

In her first three years on the Board, she undertook or collaborated in a number of initiatives and motions. A partial list of her work includes raising the minimum wage, creating a Citizens&#x27; Oversight Commission for the Sheriff&#x27;s Department, providing funding and services for LA County&#x27;s homeless population and those trying to find and keep affordable housing.

Kuehl previously had a ten-year romantic relationship with Torie Osborn, who served as a deputy mayor in L.A. Osborn went on to support Kuehl&#x27;s run for Supervisor and joined her staff as principal deputy for strategy and policy.

Los Angeles County limits its Supervisors to three consecutive four-year terms in accord with a 2002 measure. When running for the office she was asked if she missed acting and responded that the camaraderie in public service mirrored her favorite aspect of acting, and then stated &quot;I suppose if I get to be a supervisor and then I&#x27;m termed out, I&#x27;ll be, you know, fairly elderly but still able to do things, and then I guess my ambition would be to be Betty White for a couple of years.&quot;

Reflecting on her political career Kuehl told an interviewer, &quot;I was very proud of the fact that I wasn&#x27;t too frightened to run for office as a gay person. [You imagine] people making anonymous phone calls in the middle of the night to tell you you&#x27;re a horrible person only in worse language than that, or imagine getting spat at. It&#x27;s the same thing people go through about coming out. But it turns out to be much better than you expect.&quot;

On November 24, 2020, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted to uphold the county ban on outdoor dining, with Kuehl voting in favor of the ban and referring to the ongoing situation as a &quot;serious health emergency&quot;.

In 2022, UCLA named her the Edward A. Dickson Alum of the Year.

On September 14, 2022, deputies from the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department served Kuehl with a search warrant. The warrant is related to an investigation into Kuehl&#x27;s involvement with an alleged &quot;pay to play&quot; scheme; a former County official claimed that Kuehl and others improperly awarded a series of contracts for sexual harassment training programs. A few days after the raids, the California Department of Justice took over the investigation. In an August 2024 court approved agreement ending the investigation, they stated there was &quot;insufficient evidence to support the filing of any criminal charges&quot;.

<text>Patrick Wayne Swayze ( ; August 18, 1952 – September 14, 2009) was an American actor, singer, songwriter, and dancer. Known for his romantic, tough, and comedic roles in blockbusters and cult films, Swayze was nominated for three Golden Globes and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1997.

Swayze received recognition for acting in the drama film &quot;The Outsiders&quot; (1983), the action film &quot;Red Dawn&quot; (1984), and the miniseries &quot;North and South&quot; (1985–1986). His breakthrough came with the romantic drama film &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; (1987), receiving a Golden Globe nomination. He rose to further prominence in the action films &quot;Road House&quot; (1989) and &quot;Point Break&quot; (1991), and received two more Golden Globe nominations for his roles in the supernatural romance film &quot;Ghost&quot; (1990) and the road comedy film &quot;To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar&quot; (1995). He also starred in the cult thriller &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; (2001).

Outside of acting, Swayze co-wrote and recorded the song &quot;She&#x27;s Like the Wind&quot; for the &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; soundtrack album, which peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. He was also recognized for his public image and looks, and was named &quot;Sexiest Man Alive&quot; by &quot;People&quot; magazine in 1991. In 2009, Swayze died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 57.

==Early life==
Patrick Wayne Swayze was born on August 18, 1952, in Houston, Texas, the second child of Patsy Swayze (née Karnes; 1927–2013), a dancer, choreographer, and dance instructor, and Jesse Wayne Swayze (1925–1982), an engineering draftsman. He had an older sister, Vickie (1949–1994), two younger brothers, actor Don (born 1958) and Sean (born 1962), and a younger sister, Bambi, who was adopted (born 1966). Swayze&#x27;s paternal ancestor was Englishman John Swasey (1619–1706) from Bridport in Dorset. During the Puritan migration to New England between 1620 and 1640, Swasey traveled aboard the &quot;Recovery&quot;, ultimately arriving in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He married Katherine Kinge from Essex and eventually had seven children. Their grandson, Samuel, a judge, was among the first to use the Swayze spelling. His uncle Bruce Swayze was a professional wrestler.

Until age 20, Swayze lived in the Oak Forest neighborhood of Houston, where he attended St. Rose of Lima Catholic School, Oak Forest Elementary School, Black Middle School, Waltrip High School, and San Jacinto College Central. During this time, he pursued multiple artistic and athletic skills, such as ice skating, classical ballet, and acting in school plays. He also played football during high school, hoping to receive a football scholarship for college until a knee injury ended his career. He had a low Vietnam draft lottery number of 141, which was called in 1970, and he should have been drafted, but might have used his knee injury as a way to avoid service. He concurrently practiced martial arts such as Wushu, Taekwondo, and Aikido, which he used to channel his &quot;self-deprecating rage.&quot; In 1972, he moved to New York City to complete his formal dance training at the Harkness Ballet and Joffrey Ballet schools.

The American choreographer Eliot Feld planned a ballet for Swayze and Mikhail Baryshnikov, prevented by Swayze&#x27;s knee reconstruction.

==Career==

=== 1980s ===

Patrick Swayze&#x27;s first professional appearance was as a dancer for the Disney Theatrical Group in a show called &quot;Disney on Parade&quot;. He then starred in the role of Danny Zuko in one of the replacement casts for the long-running Broadway production of &quot;Grease&quot;. In 1979, he made his film debut as Ace in &quot;Skatetown, U.S.A.&quot; At the height of the popularity of disco, he starred in a Pabst Blue Ribbon commercial of him going on a date at a disco-themed nightclub with Pabst&#x27;s then-jingle set to disco music. He appeared in the &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; episode &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; in 1981 as Private Sturgis, whose wounds are minor, but who is found to be terminally ill with leukemia. That same year, he appeared in the TV movie &quot;Return of the Rebels&quot; with Barbara Eden, and then in 1983, had a brief stint on the short-lived TV series &quot;The Renegades&quot;, playing a gang leader named Bandit.

Swayze became better known to the film industry after appearing in &quot;The Outsiders&quot; in 1983 as the older brother of C. Thomas Howell and Rob Lowe. In the same year, Swayze played a Marine Corps trainer in Vietnam rescue film &quot;Uncommon Valor&quot; with Gene Hackman. The following year, Swayze, Howell, and Howell&#x27;s friend and fellow &quot;The Outsiders&quot; actor, Darren Dalton, reunited in &quot;Red Dawn&quot;, along with Jennifer Grey. In 1986, Lowe and Swayze reunited in &quot;Youngblood&quot;. Swayze&#x27;s first major dramatic success was in the 1985 television miniseries &quot;North and South&quot;, set during the American Civil War.

Swayze starred in 1987&#x27;s &quot;Dirty Dancing,&quot; a low-budget movie, planned for only a one-week release, after which it was to go to video. Swayze played resort dance instructor Johnny Castle, alongside his frequent co-star, Jennifer Grey. The story enabled Swayze to dance and romance Grey and showcase his professional dance training. In addition to acting and dancing, Swayze co-composed and sang one of the songs on the soundtrack for &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s Like the Wind.&quot; The song became a top 10 hit that has since been covered by other artists. Swayze had originally co-written the song with Stacy Widelitz for the film &quot;Grandview, U.S.A.&quot; in 1984. &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot;″s coming-of-age story first became a surprise hit, and then achieved enormous international success. It was the first film to sell one million copies on video and, as of 2009, it had earned over $214 million worldwide. The film also generated several alternative, or derivative, versions, ranging from a television series to stage productions to a computer game. Swayze received a Golden Globe Award nomination for the role. After &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot;, Swayze found himself in great demand and appeared in several films, including &quot;Road House&quot; in 1989 with Sam Elliott, Ben Gazzara, and Kelly Lynch.

=== 1990s ===

In the supernatural romantic thriller &quot;Ghost&quot; (1990), Swayze starred as Sam Wheat opposite Demi Moore, Whoopi Goldberg, and Tony Goldwyn. &quot;Ghost&quot; was the highest-grossing film of 1990 and the most rented videocassette of 1991. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture and Swayze earned another Golden Globe nomination for his acting. It was also Swayze who convinced the producers to hire Goldberg, who thanked Swayze in her acceptance speech when she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. The scene where he and Moore use a pottery wheel has become an iconic moment. In the following year, he starred alongside &quot;Youngblood&quot; castmate Keanu Reeves in another major action hit, &quot;Point Break&quot;, and &quot;People&quot; magazine named him the &quot;Sexiest Man Alive.&quot;

For his contributions to the film industry, Swayze was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1997. Swayze was injured in May 1997 while filming HBO&#x27;s &quot;Letters from a Killer&quot; near Ione, California, when he fell from a horse and hit a tree. Both of his legs were broken, and he suffered four detached tendons in his shoulder. Filming was suspended for two months. The film aired in 1998, and Swayze slowly recovered from his injuries, but he had trouble resuming his career until 2000, when he co-starred in &quot;Forever Lulu&quot;, with Melanie Griffith.

In 1995, Swayze appeared in the movie &quot;To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar,&quot; starring alongside Wesley Snipes and John Leguizamo as three drag queens whose car breaks down on a cross-country trip, leaving them stranded in a small town.

=== 2000s ===

In 2001, he appeared in &quot;Donnie Darko&quot;, where he played a motivational speaker who is revealed to be a closeted pedophile. The film later obtained a cult following. After this, he co-starred with Billy Bob Thornton and Charlize Theron in &quot;Waking Up in Reno&quot;, which focuses on two redneck couples taking a road trip from Little Rock to Reno to see a monster truck rally. In 2004, he played Allan Quatermain in &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; and had a cameo appearance in the &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; prequel &quot;Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights&quot; as an unnamed dance instructor.

In 2003, Swayze co-produced and also starred in the fictional dance film &quot;One Last Dance&quot;, along with his real-life wife Lisa Niemi. The story revolves around an actual dance production, &quot;Without a Word&quot;, which was choreographed by Alonzo King. Swayze and Niemi also produced the film, starred in it, and composed some of the music.

Swayze made his debut in London&#x27;s West End in the musical &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; as Nathan Detroit on July 27, 2006, alongside Neil Jerzak and Jordan McGhee, and remained in the role until November 25, 2006. His previous appearances on the Broadway stage included productions of &quot;Goodtime Charley&quot; in 1975 and &quot;Chicago&quot; (as Billy Flynn). Swayze also provided the voice for Cash the country music band dog in &quot;The Fox and the Hound 2&quot; (2006), and in 2007 he starred in the film &quot;Christmas in Wonderland&quot;. Swayze played an aging rock star in &quot;Powder Blue&quot; (2009), co-starring his younger brother Don in their first film together.

In his final role, Swayze starred as FBI agent Charles Barker in the A&amp;E drama &quot;The Beast&quot;, which was filmed in Chicago. Swayze was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer shortly after filming the pilot episode, but continued working on the show while receiving treatment. &quot;The Beast&quot; premiered on January 15, 2009, and ran for one season. Reviewer Alan Sepinwall wrote: &quot;[When] you watch Swayze in &quot;The Beast&quot;, [you] realize that this is the best performance of his career—that the opportunity to play a part like this, and to play it as well as he is, may be fueling his ability to keep fighting against the cancer. And you realize, in an odd silver lining, that the cancer may, in turn, be fueling the performance.&quot;

== Personal life ==

Swayze was married to Lisa Niemi for 34 years from June 12, 1975, until his death. They had no children, but Lisa had suffered one miscarriage. They met in 1970 when Swayze was 18 years old. Niemi, 14 at the time, was taking dance lessons from Swayze&#x27;s mother. In a 2008 interview, Swayze stated that Niemi was the inspiration for his song &quot;She&#x27;s Like the Wind&quot; (1987).

In 1989, Swayze said, &quot;I&#x27;ve always felt there was something different in there (my personality), but I was scared to look. For I fear I wouldn&#x27;t find anything. That&#x27;s the reason I got into Soka Gakkai Buddhism, and earlier in life took EST training, was into therapy, into transcendental meditation. I was trying to support that side of myself. But, you know, in Texas, there isn&#x27;t much support for that part of you. I finally found what I was looking for in the Soka Gakkai tradition of Buddhist practice.&quot; Swayze said he loved looking into various belief systems and faiths, how it matters to other people, and how respecting other religious teachings is important to him.

Swayze publicly recounted his 10-year battle with alcoholism after his father&#x27;s death. He entered rehabilitation in the 1990s, and after recovery, Swayze temporarily withdrew from show business, staying on his ranches in California and Las Vegas, to breed Arabian horses. His best-known horse was Tammen, a chestnut Arabian stallion.

Swayze, who was an FAA-licensed pilot with an instrument rating, made the news on June 1, 2000, while flying with his dogs in his twin-engined Cessna 414 N414PS, from Van Nuys, California, to Las Vegas, New Mexico. His plane developed a pressurization problem, causing Swayze to make a precautionary landing on a dirt road in a housing complex in Prescott Valley, Arizona. The plane&#x27;s right wing struck a light pole, but Swayze was unharmed. According to the police report, witnesses said that Swayze appeared to be extremely intoxicated and asked for help to remove evidence from the crash site, namely an open bottle of wine and a 30-pack of beer. He made himself unavailable to police for several hours. It was later determined that the alcohol in question was not in the cabin, but stored in external storage compartments inaccessible in flight, and the probable cause of the accident was Swayze&#x27;s physical impairment due to the cumulative effects of carbon monoxide from engine exhaust byproducts, carbon monoxide from heavy tobacco use, and the loss of an undetermined amount of cabin pressurization, resulting in hypoxia.

On December 27, 2006, Swayze and Niemi, who was also a licensed pilot, experienced a second incident while flying the Cessna 414 together en route to their New Mexico ranch. During the climb from their origin airport, they experienced a loss of power followed by a total failure of their right engine. Niemi, who was in the pilot&#x27;s seat for the flight, successfully landed the plane in Van Nuys. After this second incident, the couple decided to sell it in favor of a Beechcraft Super King Air, N400KW, which they purchased through their company Prop Jocks Inc. in June 2007.

== Illness and death ==
In late December 2007, just after filming the pilot episode for &quot;The Beast&quot;, Swayze began to suffer a burning feeling in his stomach caused by a blockage of his bile ducts. Three weeks later, in mid-January 2008, he was diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer. He traveled to the Stanford University Medical Center for chemotherapy and treatment with the experimental drug vatalanib, which doctors hoped would cut off the blood supply to the tumor.

On March 5, 2008, a Reuters article reported that Swayze &quot;has a very limited amount of disease, and he appears to be responding well to treatment thus far.&quot; Swayze&#x27;s doctor confirmed that the actor was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer but insisted he was not as close to death as reports suggested. Despite repeated tabloid claims that his death was imminent, Swayze continued to actively pursue his career.

In early May 2008, a number of tabloids reported that Swayze underwent surgery to remove part of his stomach after the cancer had spread. Reports also stated that he rewrote his will, transferring his property to his wife. In a statement made on May 28, Swayze said he continued to respond well to treatment at Stanford University Medical Center. In late May 2008, he was seen at a Los Angeles Lakers basketball game, his first public appearance since his diagnosis. In June 2008, he reportedly said, &quot;My treatments are working and I am winning the battle.&quot;

Swayze appeared on the ABC, NBC, and CBS simulcast of &quot;Stand Up to Cancer&quot; in September 2008 to appeal to the general public for donations for the initiative. Swayze said to a standing ovation, &quot;I dream that the word &#x27;cure&#x27; will no longer be followed by the words &#x27;it&#x27;s impossible.&#x27; Together, we can make a world where cancer no longer means living with fear, without hope, or worse.&quot; After the show ended, Swayze remained onstage and talked to other cancer patients; executive producer Laura Ziskin (herself battling advanced breast cancer, which claimed her own life) said, &quot;He said a beautiful thing: &#x27;I&#x27;m just an individual living with cancer.&#x27; That&#x27;s how he wants to be thought of. He&#x27;s in a fight, but he&#x27;s a fighter.&quot; On December 2, 2008, Swayze denied claims made by tabloids that the cancer had spread to his liver.

In an interview with Barbara Walters, which aired in January 2009, Swayze admitted that he had &quot;a tiny little mass&quot; in his liver, but told Walters that he wanted the media to report that he was &quot;kicking it.&quot; When Walters asked him if he was using any holistic or alternative methods of treatment besides chemotherapy, Swayze said he was using some Chinese herbs. He then voiced his opposition to the unsupported claims made by proponents of alternative therapies.

On January 9, 2009, Swayze was hospitalized with pneumonia, which was said to be a complication of chemotherapy for his cancer. On January 16, he was released from the hospital to rest at home with his wife. On April 19, 2009, doctors informed Swayze that the cancer had again metastasized to his liver. Swayze was a smoker for 40 years, and he once made reference to smoking 60 cigarettes a day. He stated that his chain smoking probably &quot;had something to do with&quot; the development of his disease, and continued to smoke cigarettes while undergoing treatment for cancer.

Swayze died with family at his side on September 14, 2009, at the age of 57. Swayze&#x27;s death occurred 20 months after his cancer diagnosis. Swayze&#x27;s publicist confirmed to CNN that he had died of pancreatic cancer. His body was cremated and his ashes were scattered over his New Mexico ranch.

<text>Robert Edward Sheldon, Baron Sheldon PC (born Isaac Ezra Shamash; 13 September 1923 – 2 February 2020) was a British Labour Party politician and life peer who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Ashton under Lyne from 1964 to 2001.

==Early life and career==
Isaac Ezra Shamash was born in Manchester to a family of Jewish immigrants from Iraq. His parents were Jack, a textile exporter, and Betty Shamash. His family always called him Bobby and so he changed his name by deed poll in 1943.

Sheldon was educated at Upper Latimer School, trained in engineering at Burnley and Stockport technical colleges, and awarded an external degree from the University of London. He joined the Labour Party in 1945 and later served as a Manchester City Councillor. Sheldon worked as director of his family textile firm.

==Political career==
Sheldon first stood for Parliament in Manchester Withington at the 1959 general election and was elected as MP for Ashton under Lyne at the 1964 general election a post he held until 2001.

He was one of the four directors of the Left Wing Coffee House from 1959 to 1963 in Manchester as well as Joel Barnett, and Edmund Dell, in addition to the chief funder, Harold Lever.

Sheldon caused difficulty for the first Wilson government in his support for devaluation of the pound, which the Prime Minister and Chancellor strongly opposed. When Chancellor James Callaghan refused to answer his question on the issue in Parliament, there was a run on the pound.

He was also staunchly pro-EU, supporting Britain&#x27;s entry into the European Common Market and later advocating for membership of the European Monetary Union. Sheldon was known for his association with fellow MPs Joel Barnett and Edmund Dell, the three of whom met in Manchester during their youth.

He briefly served as Civil Service Minister after Labour returned to power in 1974 but was appointed as a Treasury Minister later in the same year. Sheldon was promoted to Financial Secretary to the Treasury from 1975 to 1979 and was made a Privy Counsellor in 1977.

He served as Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury from 1981 until 1983, when he became Chair of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC). In his final term in the House of Commons, Sheldon stepped down from the PAC to chair both the Liaison Committee and Standards and Privileges Committee.

He stood down from the Commons at the 2001 general election, and was created a life peer as Baron Sheldon, of Ashton-under-Lyne in the County of Greater Manchester, on 22 June 2001. Sheldon retired from the House of Lords on 18 May 2015.

== Personal life ==
Sheldon married his first cousin Eileen Shamash in 1945, with whom he had a son and daughter. Eileen died in 1969 and he married again to Mary Shield in 1971. His daughter, Gillian Sargeant, later became a Labour Councillor on Barnet London Borough Council.

In 2000, he collapsed on the street of a heart attack and was resuscitated by a passer-by, who happened to be former Olympic swimmer Duncan Goodhew. He eventually died of a heart attack on 2 February 2020.

On 11 February 1999, Mirko Banjac, at the time Deputy Chair of the House of Representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina, instituted a request for, among other issues, the evaluation of the constitutionality of the Law on the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Ministries of Bosnia and Herzegovina (&quot;Official Gazette of Bosnia and Herzegovina, No. 4/97&quot;) which foresaw the existence of two Co-Chairs and a Vice-Chair of the Council of Ministers. In its decision the Court had, among other things, stated the following:

The Court gave the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina a three-month period from the date of publication of its decision in the Official Gazette of Bosnia and Herzegovina to bring the contested provisions of the Law in conformity with the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina. After the Parliamentary Assembly failed to do that, the Court, acting upon the request of the applicant and pursuant to its decision of 14 August 1999 and the legal standpoint cited in the reasons of the decision, established that certain provisions of the Law on Ministers and Ministries shall cease to be valid.

<doc id="493913" wikidata="Q3391846" url="?curid=493913" title="Plate armour">
<text>Plate armour is a historical type of personal body armour made from bronze, iron, or steel plates, culminating in the iconic suit of armour entirely encasing the wearer. Full plate steel armour developed in Europe during the Late Middle Ages, especially in the context of the Hundred Years&#x27; War, from the coat of plates (popular in late 13th and early 14th century) worn over mail suits during the 14th century, a century famous for the Transitional armour, in that plate gradually replaced chain mail.

In Europe, full plate armour reached its peak in the 15th and 16th centuries. The full suit of armour, also referred to as a panoply, is thus a feature of the very end of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance period. Its popular association with the &quot;medieval knight” is due to the specialised jousting armour which developed in the 16th century.

Full suits of Gothic plate armour and Milanese plate armour were worn on the battlefields of the Burgundian Wars, Wars of the Roses, Polish–Teutonic Wars, Eighty Years&#x27; War, French Wars of Religion, Italian Wars, Hungarian–Ottoman Wars,
Ottoman–Habsburg wars, Polish–Ottoman Wars, a significant part of the Hundred Years&#x27; War, and even the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The most heavily armoured troops of the period were heavy cavalry, such as the gendarmes and early cuirassiers, but the infantry troops of the Swiss mercenaries and the Landsknechts also took to wearing lighter suits of &quot;three quarters&quot; munition armour, leaving the lower legs unprotected.

The use of plate armour began to decline in the early 17th century, but it remained common both among the nobility (e.g., the Emperor Ferdinand II, Louis XIII, Philip IV of Spain, Maurice of Orange and Gustavus Adolphus) and the cuirassiers throughout the European wars of religion. After the mid-17th century, plate armour was mostly reduced to the simple breastplate or cuirass worn by cuirassiers, with the exception of the Polish Hussars that still used considerable amounts of plate. This was due to the development of the musket, which could penetrate armour at a considerable distance. For infantry, the breastplate gained renewed importance with the development of shrapnel in the late Napoleonic Wars. The use of steel plates sewn into flak jackets dates to World War II, and was replaced by more modern materials such as fibre-reinforced plastic, since the mid-20th century.

Mail armour is a layer of protective clothing worn most commonly from the 9th to the 13th century, though it would continue to be worn under plate armour until the 15th century. Mail was made from hundreds of small interlinking iron or steel rings held together by rivets. It was made this way so that it would be able to follow the contour of the wearer&#x27;s body, maximizing comfort. Mail armour was designed mainly to defend against thrusting and cutting weapons, rather than bludgeons. Typical clothing articles made of mail at the time would be hooded cloaks, gloves, trousers, and shoes. From the 10th to the 13th century, mail armour was so popular in Europe, that it was known as the age of mail.

== Early history ==

Partial plate armour, made out of bronze, which protected the chest and the lower limbs, was used by the ancient Greeks, as early as the late Bronze Age. The Dendra panoply protected the entire torso on both sides and included shoulder and neck protections. Less restrictive and heavy armour would become more widespread in the form of the muscle cuirass during classic antiquity before being superseded by other types of armour. Parthian and Sassanian heavy cavalry known as Clibanarii used cuirasses made out of scales or mail and small, overlapping plates in the manner of the manica for the protection of arms and legs. Plate armour in the form of the Lorica segmentata was used by the Roman empire between the 1st century BC and 4th century AD.

Single plates of metal armour were again used from the late 13th century on, to protect joints and shins, and these were worn over a mail hauberk. Gradually the number of plate components of medieval armour increased, protecting further areas of the body, and in barding those of a cavalryman&#x27;s horse. Armourers developed skills in articulating the lames or individual plates for parts of the body that needed to be flexible, and in fitting armour to the individual wearer like a tailor. The cost of a full suit of high quality fitted armour, as opposed to the cheaper munition armour (equivalent of ready-to-wear) was enormous, and inevitably restricted to the wealthy who were seriously committed to either soldiering or jousting. The rest of an army wore inconsistent mixtures of pieces, with mail still playing an important part.

== Japan ==

In the Kofun period (250–538), iron plate cuirasses (&quot;tankō&quot;) and helmets were being made. Plate armour was used in Japan during the Nara period (646–793); both plate and lamellar armours have been found in burial mounds, and &quot;haniwa&quot; (ancient clay figures) have been found depicting warriors wearing full armour.

In Japan, the warfare of the Sengoku period (1467–1615) required large quantities of armour to be produced for the ever-growing armies of foot soldiers (&quot;ashigaru&quot;). Simple munition-quality chest armours (&quot;dō&quot;) and helmets (&quot;kabuto&quot;) were mass-produced.

In 1543, the Portuguese brought matchlock firearms (&quot;tanegashima&quot;) to Japan. As Japanese swordsmiths began mass-producing matchlock firearms and firearms became used in war, the use of Lamellar armour (&quot;ō-yoroi&quot; and &quot;dō-maru&quot;), previously used as samurai armour, gradually decreased. Japanese armour makers started to make new types of armour made of larger iron plate and plated leather. This new suit of armour is called &quot;tōsei gusoku&quot; (gusoku), which means modern armour. The type of &quot;gusoku&quot;, which covered the front and back of the body with a single iron plate with a raised center and a V-shaped bottom like plate armour, was specifically called &quot;nanban dou gusoku&quot; (&quot;Western style &quot;gusoku&quot;) and was used by some samurai. Japanese armour makers designed bulletproof plate armour called &quot;tameshi gusoku&quot; (&quot;bullet tested&quot;), which allowed soldiers to continue wearing armour despite the heavy use of firearms in the late 16th century.

In the 17th century, warfare in Japan came to an end, but the samurai continued to use plate armour until the end of the samurai era in the 1860s, with the known last use of samurai armour occurring in 1877, during the Satsuma rebellion.

By about 1420, complete suits of plate armour had been developed in Europe. A full suit of plate armour would have consisted of a helmet, a gorget (or bevor), spaulders, pauldrons with gardbraces to cover the armpits as was seen in French armour, or besagews (also known as rondels) which were mostly used in Gothic Armour, rerebraces, couters, vambraces, gauntlets, a cuirass (breastplate and backplate) with a fauld, tassets and a culet, a mail skirt, cuisses, poleyns, greaves, and sabatons. The very fullest sets, known as garnitures, more often made for jousting than war, included pieces of exchange, alternate pieces suiting different purposes, so that the suit could be configured for a range of different uses, for example fighting on foot or on horse. By the Late Middle Ages even infantry could afford to wear several pieces of plate armour. Armour production was a profitable and pervasive industry during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.

A complete suit of plate armour made from well-tempered steel would weigh around . The wearer remained highly agile and could jump, run and otherwise move freely as the weight of the armour was spread evenly throughout the body. The armour was articulated and covered a man&#x27;s entire body completely from neck to toe. In the 15th and 16th centuries, plate-armoured soldiers were the nucleus of every army. Large bodies of men-at-arms numbering thousands, or even more than ten thousand men (approximately 60% to 70% of French armies were men-at-arms and the percentage was also high in other countries), were fighting on foot, wearing full plate next to archers and crossbowmen. This was commonly seen in the Western European armies, especially during the Hundred Years War, the Wars of the Roses or the Italian Wars.

European leaders in armouring techniques were Northern Italians, especially from Milan, and Southern Germans, who had somewhat different styles. But styles were diffused around Europe, often by the movement of armourers; the Renaissance Greenwich armour was made by a royal workshop near London that had imported Italian, Flemish and (mostly) German craftsmen, though it soon developed its own unique style. Ottoman Turkey also made wide use of plate armour, but incorporated large amounts of mail into their armour, which was widely used by shock troops such as the Janissary Corps.

=== Effect on weapon development ===
Plate armour gave the wearer very good protection against sword cuts, as well against spear thrusts, and provided decent defense against blunt weapons.

The evolution of plate armour also triggered developments in the design of offensive weapons. While this armour was effective against cuts or strikes, their weak points could be exploited by thrusting weapons, 
such as estocs, poleaxes, and halberds. The effect of arrows and bolts is still a point of contention with regard to plate armour. The evolution of the 14th-century plate armour also triggered the development of various polearms. They were designed to deliver a strong impact and concentrate energy on a small area and cause damage through the plate. Maces, war hammers, and pollaxes (poleaxes) were used to inflict blunt force trauma through armour. Strong blows to the head could result in concussion, even if the armour is not penetrated.

Fluted plate was not only decorative, but also reinforced the plate against bending under striking or blunt impact. This offsets against the tendency for flutes to catch piercing blows. In armoured techniques taught in the German school of swordsmanship, the attacker concentrates on these &quot;weak spots&quot;, resulting in a fighting style very different from unarmoured sword-fighting. Because of this weakness, most warriors wore a mail shirt (haubergeon or hauberk) beneath their plate armour (or coat-of-plates). Later, full mail shirts were replaced with mail patches, called gussets, which were sewn onto a gambeson or arming jacket. Further protection for plate armour was the use of small round plates called besagews, that covered the armpit area and the addition of couters and poleyns with &quot;wings&quot; to protect the inside of the joint.

== Renaissance ==
German so-called Maximilian armour of the early 16th century is a style using heavy fluting and some decorative etching, as opposed to the plainer finish on 15th-century white armour. The shapes include influence from Italian styles. This era also saw the use of closed helms, as opposed to the 15th-century-style sallets and barbutes. During the early 16th century, the helmet and neckguard design was reformed to produce the so-called Nürnberg armour, many of them masterpieces of workmanship and design.

As firearms became better and more common on the battlefield, the utility of full armour gradually declined, and full suits became restricted to those made for jousting which continued to develop. The decoration of fine armour greatly increased in the period, using a range of techniques, and further greatly increasing the cost. Elaborately decorated plate armour for royalty and the very wealthy was being produced. Highly decorated armour is often called parade armour, a somewhat misleading term as such armour might well be worn on active military service. Steel plate armour for Henry II of France, made in 1555, is covered with meticulous embossing, which has been subjected to blueing, silvering and gilding.

Such work required armourers to either collaborate with artists or have artistic skill of their own; another alternative was to take designs from ornament prints and other prints, as was often done. Daniel Hopfer was an etcher of armour by training, who developed etching as a form of printmaking. Other artists such as Hans Holbein the Younger produced designs for armour. The Milanese armourer Filippo Negroli, from a leading dynasty of armourers, was the most famous modeller of figurative relief decoration on armour.

=== Infantry ===
Reduced plate armour, typically consisting of a breastplate, a burgonet, morion or cabasset and gauntlets, however, also became popular among 16th-century mercenaries, and there are many references to so-called munition armour being ordered for infantrymen at a fraction of the cost of full plate armour. This mass-produced armour was often heavier and made of lower quality metal than fine armour for commanders.

=== Jousting ===
Specialised jousting armour produced in the late 15th to 16th century was heavier, and could weigh as much as , as it was not intended for free combat, it did not need to permit free movement, the only limiting factor being the maximum weight that could be carried by a warhorse of the period.

The medieval joust has its origins in the military tactics of heavy cavalry during the High Middle Ages. Since the 15th century, jousting had become a sport (&quot;hastilude&quot;) with less direct relevance to warfare, for example using separate specialized armour and equipment.

During the 1490s, emperor Maximilian I invested a great deal of effort in perfecting the sport, for which he received his nickname of &quot;The Last Knight&quot;.
&quot;Rennen&quot; and &quot;Stechen&quot; were two sportive forms of the joust developed during the 15th century and practiced throughout the 16th century. The armours used for these two respective styles of the joust were known as &quot;Rennzeug&quot; and &quot;Stechzeug&quot;, respectively. The &quot;Stechzeug&quot; in particular developed into extremely heavy armour which completely inhibited the movement of the rider, in its latest forms resembling an armour-shaped cabin integrated into the horse armour more than a functional suit of armour. Such forms of sportive equipment during the final phase of the joust in 16th-century Germany gave rise to modern misconceptions about the heaviness or clumsiness of &quot;medieval armour&quot;, as notably popularised by Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot;.

The extremely heavy helmets of the &quot;Stechzeug&quot; are explained by the fact that the aim was to detach the crest of the opponent&#x27;s helmet, resulting in frequent full impact of the lance to the helmet.

By contrast, the &quot;Rennen&quot; was a type of joust with lighter contact. Here, the aim was to hit the opponent&#x27;s shield. The specialised &quot;Rennzeug&quot; was developed on the request of Maximilian, who desired a return to a more agile form of joust compared to the heavily armoured &quot;full contact&quot; &quot;Stechen&quot;. In the &quot;Rennzeug&quot;, the shield was attached to the armour with a mechanism of springs and would detach itself upon contact.

== Early modern period ==
Plate armour was widely used by most armies until the end of the 17th century for both foot and mounted troops such as the cuirassiers, London lobsters, dragoons, demi-lancers and Polish hussars. The infantry armour of the 16th century developed into the &quot;Savoyard&quot; type of three-quarters armour by 1600.

Full plate armour was expensive to produce and remained therefore restricted to the upper strata of society; lavishly decorated suits of armour remained the fashion with 18th-century nobles and generals long after they had ceased to be militarily useful on the battlefield due to the advent of inexpensive muskets.

The development of powerful firearms made all but the finest and heaviest armour obsolete. The increasing power and availability of firearms and the nature of large, state-supported infantry led to more portions of plate armour being cast off in favour of cheaper, more mobile troops. Leg protection was the first part to go, replaced by tall leather boots. By the beginning of the 18th century, only field marshals, commanders and royalty remained in full armour on the battlefield, more as a sign of rank than for practical considerations. It remained fashionable for monarchs to be portrayed in armour during the first half of the 18th century (late Baroque period), but even this tradition became obsolete. Thus, a portrait of Frederick the Great in 1739 still shows him in armour, while a later painting showing him as a commander in the Seven Years&#x27; War (c. 1760) depicts him without armour.

== Modern body armour ==

Body armour made a brief reappearance in the American Civil War with mixed success. During World War I, both sides experimented with shrapnel armour, and some soldiers used their own dedicated ballistic armour such as the American Brewster Body Shield, although none were widely produced. The heavy cavalry armour (cuirass) used by the German, British, and French empires during the Napoleonic Wars, were actively used until the first few months of World War I, when French cuirassiers went to meet the enemy dressed in armour outside of Paris. The cuirass represents the final stage of the tradition of plate armour descended from the Late Middle Ages. Meanwhile, makeshift steel armour for protection against shrapnel and early forms of ballistic vests began development from the mid-19th century to the present day.

Plate armour was also famously used in Australia by the Kelly Gang, a group of four bushrangers led by Edward &quot;Ned&quot; Kelly, who had constructed four suits of improvised armour from plough mouldboards and whose crime spree culminated with a violent shootout with police at the town of Glenrowan in 1880. The armour was reasonably effective against bullets and made Kelly seem almost invincible to the policemen, who likened him to an evil spirit or Bunyip with one constable reporting that &quot;[I] fired at him point blank and hit him straight in the body. But there is no use firing at Ned Kelly; he can&#x27;t be hurt&quot;, however it left sections of the groin and limbs exposed; during the infamous &quot;Glenrowan Affair&quot;, gang member Joe Byrne was killed by a bullet to the groin, Kelly was captured after a fifteen-minute last stand against police (having sustained a total of 28 bullet wounds over his body), and the remaining two members are thought to have committed suicide shortly after. Although the recovered suits were almost immediately mismatched, they have since been reorganized and restored and today remain as a powerful symbol of the Australian outback.

In 1916, General Adrian of the French army provided an abdominal shield which was light in weight (approx. one kilogram) and easy to wear. A number of British officers recognised that many casualties could be avoided if effective armour were available.

The first usage of the term &quot;flak jacket&quot; refers to the armour originally developed by the Wilkinson Sword company during World War II to help protect Royal Air Force (RAF) air personnel from flying debris and shrapnel. The Red Army also made use of ballistic steel body armour, typically chestplates, for combat engineers and assault infantry.

After World War II, steel plates were soon replaced by vests made from synthetic fibre, in the 1950s, made of either boron carbide, silicon carbide, or aluminium oxide. They were issued to the crew of low-flying aircraft, such as the UH-1 and UC-123, during the Vietnam War. The synthetic fibre Kevlar was introduced in 1971, and most ballistic vests since the 1970s are based on kevlar, optionally with the addition of trauma plates to reduce the risk of blunt trauma injury. Such plates may be made of ceramic, metal (steel or titanium) or synthetic materials.

<text>Boris Lvovich Rosing (; – 20 April 1933) was a Russian scientist and inventor of television.

== Biography ==
Boris Rosing was born in Saint Petersburg into the family of a government official. His father, Lev Nikolaevich Rozing, served on the commission for military service (conscription) under Czar Alexander II. Rozing was a descendant of the noble Rozing family, founded by Dutch immigrant Peter Rozing. Lev developed an interest mathematics and technology, including recent inventions, which he communicated to his son. From 1879 to 1887, Boris studied at St. Petersburg&#x27;s Vvdensky gymnasium, from which he graduated with a gold medal. There, he distinguished himself in his studies of the exact sciences, literature and music. He then studied physics and mathematics at St. Petersburg University, which was a major research center. The distinguished faculty included the chemist Dmitri Mendeleev and the mathematicians Pafnuty Chebyshev and Andrey Markov. After graduating with honors in 1891, he remained at the university to pursue graduate studies in physics. The subject of his dissertation was magnetic hysteresis. He discovered hysteresis in the lengths of iron wires in the presence of cyclic magnetic fields, a phenomenon that was discovered independently by the Japanese investigator Hantaro Nagaoka. He subsequently became a physics instructor at the St. Petersburg Institute of Technology. Starting in 1894, he also taught physics at the Konstantinovsky Artillery School, and from 1906, he lectured on electrical and magnetic measurements as part of women&#x27;s polytechnic courses. During 1894–1900, he continued his studies of magnetism but also worked on several practical electrical problems. He taught at the St. Petersburg Institute of Technology until 1918. He then conducted research at the Leningrad Experimental Electrotechnical Laboratory from 1924 to 1928 and at the Central Laboratory for Wire Communications from 1928 to 1931.

==Television==

Rosing&#x27;s interest in television — or the &quot;electric telescope&quot;, as he called it — began in 1897. Others had tried to develop a mechanical version of television. Rosing recognized the shortcomings of mechanical television; he thought that the image should be displayed electrically on a cathode-ray tube (CRT). By 1902, Rosing began actual experimentation to test his ideas: he constructed a simple apparatus for electrically deflecting the beam of a CRT, which allowed him to draw figures on the tube&#x27;s screen. At that time, mechanical devices scanned an image onto a selenium photoresistor, the resistance of which varied in response to the light striking it. However, selenium photoresistors responded to changes in light levels too slowly to accurately reproduce moving images. Therefore, Rosing used a photocell, a piece of alkaline metal in a vacuum tube which emitted electrons in response to light. Once Rosing had developed a rudimentary working television that incorporated his two innovations — a photocell detector and a CRT display — he filed a patent application in Russia on 25 July 1907 and — on the improved version of his system, which included magnetic deflection coils around the CRT — on 2 March 1911. He followed up with a demonstration of which a report was published in the &quot;Scientific American&quot; with diagrams and full description of the invention&#x27;s operation. During 1912–1914, he did theoretical and experimental work on magnetic lenses. In 1918, he co-founded the North Caucasian Polytechnic Institute, now the Kuban State Technological University. In the early 1920s he resided in Krasnodar (formerly: Ekaterinodar), near the Black Sea. There, in 1920, he co-founded the Ekaterinodar Physical-Mathematical Society and became its chairman, and in 1923, he wrote his booklet &quot;The Electric Telescope: Vision at a distance&quot;.

Rosing&#x27;s invention expanded on the designs of Paul Nipkow and his mechanical system of rotating lenses and mirrors. Accordingly, Rosing&#x27;s system employed a mechanical camera device, but used very early CRTs (developed in Germany by Karl Ferdinand Braun) as a receiver. Rosing&#x27;s Braun Tubes consisted of two parallel metal plates that were used to electrically shift the electron beam itself before it was scanned and reached the screen. These two plates were connected electrically to the photoelectric cell in the camera. Depending on the output of the photoelectric cells, the beam would be deflected up or down before entering the concentrating plate. Since this movement increased or decreased the number of electrons passing between the plates, it had the effect of varying the brightness of the electron beam. The system was primitive, but it was definitely one of the first experimental demonstrations where the CRT was employed for the purposes of television.
V. K. Zworykin, who pioneered television in the United States and Germany, was a pupil of Rosing and assisted him in some of his laboratory work. In 1925, B. Rosing advised and helped young inventor Boris Grabovsky apply for a patent (issued under No 5592) of a fully electronic TV set, called Telefot.

Rosing continued his television research until 1931 when he was exiled as a counter-revolutionary to Kotlas without right to work, but in 1932 was moved to Archangelsk, where took up physics at the Forestry Technology Institute. Rosing died in exile in 1933 of cerebral hemorrhage. He was buried in the Arkhangelsk Vologda (formerly: Kuznechevskaya) cemetery.

<text>The Lockheed WP-3D Orion is a highly modified P-3 Orion used by the Aircraft Operations Center division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The aircraft are operated by officers of the NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps. Only two of these aircraft exist, each incorporating numerous features for the role of collecting weather information. During the Atlantic hurricane season, the WP-3Ds are deployed for duty as hurricane hunters. The aircraft also support research on other topics, such as Arctic ice coverage, air chemistry studies, and ocean water temperature and current analysis.

==Design==
The WP-3Ds are equipped with three weather radars, C band radar in the nose and on the lower fuselage, and an X-band radar in the aircraft&#x27;s tail. They are also equipped with the ability to deploy dropsondes into storm systems, and have onboard temperature sensors, and other meteorological equipment. While the aircraft are not specially strengthened for flying into hurricanes, their decks were reinforced to withstand the additional equipment load.

It has a &quot;barber&#x27;s pole sampler&quot; (named for its red and white stripes) that protrude from the aircraft&#x27;s front, a tail Doppler weather radar, and other unique-looking instruments hanging from the wing.

==Operational history==
NOAA currently operates two WP-3Ds nicknamed &quot;Miss Piggy&quot; and &quot;Kermit&quot;, and their logos feature the characters created by Jim Henson Productions. NOAA&#x27;s other hurricane hunting aircraft, the Gulfstream IV-SP, is named &quot;Gonzo&quot;; they complement the fleet of WC-130 aircraft operated by the United States Air Force 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron. As of 2014, the two Orions had each flown more than 10,000 hours and flown into more than 80 hurricanes. In 2024, NOAA announced plans to replace these two aircraft with modified C-130Js, and they are scheduled to be retired by 2030.

Between 2015 and 2017, the aircraft received major overhauls, costing a total of $35 million. This work was performed by the United States Navy&#x27;s Fleet Readiness Center Southeast in Jacksonville Florida. The work included new wings and engines and upgraded radars and avionics. NOAA anticipates that these changes will allow the aircraft to fly until between 2032 and 2037.

<text>John Joseph Montgomery (February 15, 1858 – October 31, 1911) was an American inventor, physicist, engineer, and professor at Santa Clara University in Santa Clara, California, who is best known for his invention of controlled heavier-than-air flying machines.

In the 1880s Montgomery, a native of Yuba City, California, made manned flight experiments in a series of gliders in the United States in Otay Mesa in San Diego, California. Although not publicized in the 1880s, these early flights were first described by Montgomery as part of a lecture delivered at the International Conference on Aerial Navigation at Chicago, 1893. These independent advances came after gliding flights by European pioneers such as George Cayley&#x27;s coachman in England (1853) and Jean-Marie Le Bris in France (1856). Although Montgomery never claimed firsts, his gliding experiments of the 1880s are considered by some historians and organizations to have been the first controlled flights of a heavier-than-air flying machine in America or in the Western Hemisphere, depending on the source.

Montgomery devised different control methods for his gliders, including weight shifting for roll and an elevator for pitch (1884). Subsequent designs used hinged, pilot-operated trailing edge flaps on the wings (1885–1886) for roll control, and later, full wing warping systems for roll (1903–1905) and for both pitch and roll (1911).

==Education==
Montgomery attended St. Ignatius High School, graduating in 1873. At age 16 he attended the preparatory division at Santa Clara College from 1874 to 1876 to prepare for college.

Montgomery attended St. Ignatius College, now known as the University of San Francisco. Here, he studied under Fathers Joseph Bayma, S.J., and Joseph Neri, S.J., two gifted and influential educators. As a student in San Francisco, Montgomery must have mentioned his desire to build a flying machine, according to Fogel and Harwood. They include an observation in their book, made by Montgomery&#x27;s contemporary, Rev. Fred Morrison, S.J.: “In those days anyone who even mentioned ‘man being able to fly’ was considered a little bit off. So, when John was in the vicinity, there was a general tapping of heads, which in our present day would be the sign that the party was crazy.” At St. Ignatius College, Montgomery received a Bachelor of Arts in physics in 1879 and a master&#x27;s degree in physics in 1880. He also received an honorary PhD in physics from Santa Clara University in 1901.

==Ornithology==
In the early 1880s Montgomery began studying the anatomy of a variety of large soaring birds to determine their basic characteristics like wing area, weight and curved surfaces. He made detailed observations of birds in flight, especially large soaring birds such as eagles, hawks, vultures and pelicans which soared on thermals near San Diego Bay.

He initially attempted to achieve manned flight with ornithopters. In 1883, he built and experimented with a series of three ornithopters but found that human strength was insufficient to generate the necessary lift. He abandoned flapping-wing flight, preferring instead to emulate soaring birds with fixed-wing craft. He reasoned that it would be possible to solve the physics of gliding and soaring flight and then add a motor.

==Fixed-wing gliders==
Montgomery first tested his concepts for the design, construction and control of gliders with small-scale, free flight models. His first glider in 1883-84 had a cambered airfoil based on the curve of the seagull wing. Pitch was controlled by an operable elevator and roll was controlled by pilot weight shift. Yaw was uncontrolled. This aircraft design served as the basis for three gliders over the period 1883–1886. In the spring of 1884, Montgomery made flights of up to 600 feet (180 m) from the rim of Otay Mesa. During experiments with this craft, Montgomery found that the glider would not respond well to side gusts. He returned to ornithology and noted how turkey vultures had significant dihedral and twisted their wings as a form of lateral balance.

Emulating these control methods, in 1884-1885 he incorporated hinged flaps into the trailing edge of a second glider. These were held under spring tension for automatic balance in gusts, but were also connected through cables to the pilot&#x27;s seat so they could be operated mechanically by the pilot for roll control. In essence these flaps were early ailerons. The second glider had a flat plate airfoil, considerable dihedral for stability and an operable elevator for pitch control. Montgomery devised an inclined rail system so the piloted glider could roll from the top of a hill and attain flight speed.

In the winter of 1885–86, Montgomery constructed a third glider. It had a cambered airfoil modeled after the wings of a vulture, though the leading and trailing edges were turned upward slightly. The wing, spanwise, was &quot;gull&quot; shaped. Controls allowed the pilot to vary the angle of incidence of the left and right wing either in unison or independently. Dihedral and an operable elevator were also included. Montgomery concluded that a better understanding of aerodynamics was needed for the design of a proper airfoil.

In an 1893 speech, Montgomery said that flights were made in these three craft during the period 1884–1886, with the occasional assistance of at least three friends and two younger brothers. Of the flight trials with the second craft (of 1885) Octave Chanute&#x27;s account in 1893 noted &quot;several trials were made, but no effective lift could be obtained.&quot; Of the third craft (of 1886) Chanute wrote &quot;this last apparatus proved an entire failure, as no effective lifting effect could be obtained from the wind sufficient to carry the 180 lbs. it was designed to bear.&quot;&quot;

Montgomery&#x27;s own account made clear that he considered the technology of the second and third gliders of 1885 and 1886 as effective, but the airfoil designs were a disappointment in terms of lift-generation as they produced much shorter gliding flights in comparison to the first craft of 1884. He realized he was getting increasingly farther from understanding the mechanism of lift and began controlled laboratory experiments to investigate airfoils. In 1886, he briefly considered filing a patent caveat for lateral balancing, but did not.

==Aerodynamics==
About 1885 Montgomery began a long series of experiments with a whirling arm device, a smoke chamber, a water current table and large wooden surfaces angled into the wind in order to understand the physics of flow around curved surfaces. He also used dried bird wings placed in wind currents to observe the effect. His work in the 1880s confirmed that mechanical systems used by a pilot could preserve lateral balance and some degree of equilibrium in gliding flight. His experiments also confirmed the value of a cambered surface for obtaining lift.

In 1893 Montgomery visited the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, intending initially to attend a lecture by electrical expert Nikola Tesla. Upon arrival, he heard of the International Conference on Aerial Navigation to take place the first week of August. He introduced himself to Octave Chanute and Albert F. Zahm, who were collaborating in chairing the conference. He did not present a paper, but was subsequently invited by Chanute and Zahm to participate in the conference by giving two lectures of his own. His first focused on his experiments with surfaces in air and water currents. This talk was revised into an article and included in the conference proceedings. The article was later published in the July 1894 edition of &quot;Aeronautics.&quot; With encouragement from Chanute, Montgomery decided to give a second lecture. Although he refrained from providing enough detail that might be useful to designers, he did discuss use of hinged wing sections for lateral control. His second lecture was not published as part of the conference proceedings, because Chanute thought Montgomery wanted to seek patent protection. Instead, Chanute presented his own comments on Montgomery&#x27;s flight experiments in his article series &quot;Progress in Flying Machines&quot;, which was published serially in the &quot;American Engineer and Railroad Journal&quot; in 1893, and in the following year as a book of the same name. Montgomery reprised his second lecture in a talk to the Aeronautical Society of New York in 1910, and the contents were later published in several journals and books.

From 1893 to 1895, while teaching at Mount St. Joseph&#x27;s College in Rohnerville, California, Montgomery conducted further experiments into the physics of flow over a wing and lift generation using a smoke chamber and water table. From these experiments he developed a theory of lift based on vorticity, or what modern aerodynamicists refer to as a &quot;circulation theory&quot; or &quot;lifting-line theory&quot;. Montgomery compiled his results into a 131-page manuscript titled &quot;Soaring Flight&quot; and attempted to have it published by Matthias N. Forney and the editors of &quot;Scientific American&quot; with the help of Octave Chanute. Chanute was reluctant to endorse it due to his disagreements with some of its theoretical content and suggested that it be edited to distinguish between experimental results and theoretical inferences. &quot;Scientific American&quot; rejected the manuscript, but later published an abstract. Chanute also directed one of his collaborators, Augustus Herring, to study the manuscript, as he considered it instructive in understanding &quot;ground effect.&quot;

==Invention==
In 1884 Montgomery received a patent for a process to vulcanize and de-vulcanize India rubber. In 1895 and again in the period 1901 to 1904, Montgomery occasionally supplemented his aeronautical research with work in other branches of science, including electricity, communication, astronomy and mining. In 1895 he received four patents (American, German, British, and Canadian) for improvements in the efficiency of petroleum burning furnaces. In 1897 he took a teaching position at Santa Clara College and directed study of wireless telegraphy with Father Richard Bell. They were first to successfully transmit messages from Santa Clara College to San Francisco. Montgomery also patented two gold concentrator devices to assist miners in extracting gold from beach sands (see patent list).

==Tandem-wing gliders==
In early 1903, veteran balloonist Thomas Scott Baldwin sought Montgomery&#x27;s knowledge of aeronautics. Baldwin had also been assisting August Greth in constructing and experimenting with an airship (dubbed the &quot;California Eagle&quot;) at San Jose, California. Baldwin wanted improved propeller designs for dirigibles. He stopped working with Greth and came to Santa Clara College for an extended period to learn aeronautics from Montgomery. Their work together included wind tunnel tests at the college. At Baldwin&#x27;s suggestion, they entered into a business arrangement in 1904 to make public exhibitions with manned Montgomery gliders launched at high altitudes from unmanned Baldwin balloons. By late May 1904, Montgomery made test flights with a new glider. However, Baldwin abandoned their collaboration and instead constructed his own airship (the &quot;California Arrow&quot;) at San Jose incorporating Montgomery&#x27;s propeller design and a 7-horsepower motorcycle engine (the &quot;Hercules&quot; of G.H. Curtiss Mfg Co.). The &quot;California Arrow&quot; would be first in America to make repeated circuits under control. During a protracted period of acrimony between Montgomery and Baldwin, Baldwin entered the &quot;California Arrow&quot; in the aeronautic competition at the St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair in November, 1904 and took first place.

In the fall of 1904 Montgomery conducted tests of his tandem-wing glider, the &quot;Montgomery Aeroplane&quot;, with associates Frank Hamilton and Daniel J. Maloney. On March 16, 17 and 20, 1905, in Aptos, California, Daniel Maloney made several successful flights in the glider at Leonard&#x27;s ranch (Rancho San Antonio, now known as Seascape), after releasing from a hot-air balloon at high altitude. The resulting glides were well-controlled, and flights lasted up to 13 minutes. News of these flights received attention in both the U.S. and Europe. After this success, Montgomery gave a press conference to provide for the first time a history of his efforts in aeronautics and announced a patent application for his aeroplane and methods of wing warping. On April 29, 1905, Montgomery, Maloney, and Hamilton provided a public demonstration of the &quot;Montgomery Aeroplane&quot;, rechristened that day as &quot;The Santa Clara&quot; in honor of Santa Clara College. In view of hundreds of spectators and members of the press, Maloney released from the balloon at an approximate altitude of 4,000 feet above Santa Clara College. Maloney performed a series of pre-determined maneuvers and made a soft landing near the college grounds. This exhibition brought widespread recognition for Montgomery and was generally accepted as a milestone in aviation. In the following months Montgomery and Maloney made many exhibitions with &quot;The Santa Clara&quot; and another tandem wing glider &quot;The California&quot; in the San Francisco bay area. On July 18, 1905, Maloney was killed when a rope from the balloon damaged the glider during the ascent, causing structural failure after release. Despite this, Montgomery continued experiments with other tandem-wing gliders and pilots for some time.

==&quot;Evergreen&quot;==
Following the catastrophic 1906 San Francisco earthquake, Montgomery&#x27;s gliding experiments were curtailed until 1911. Montgomery began experimenting with a new control system in which pitch and roll of the glider were managed by wing warping, while the tail assembly was fixed. Montgomery intended to add a motor and apply for a patent. This glider, &quot;The Evergreen&quot; (named after the Evergreen district of San Jose, California where flight tests occurred), was flown by Montgomery as well as another aeronaut Reinhardt more than 50 times in October 1911.

==Death==
On October 31, 1911, Montgomery was attempting to land &quot;Evergreen&quot; at low speed and encountered turbulence, which caused a stall. He crashed and died from his injuries at the site. The hillside (now known as &quot;Montgomery Hill&quot;) is just behind Evergreen Valley College. John J. Montgomery was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma, California on November 3, 1911.

==&quot;Gallant Journey&quot;==
In 1946, Columbia Pictures released &quot;Gallant Journey&quot;, a full-length movie based on John J. Montgomery&#x27;s life and work. The film was directed by William A. Wellman, and starred Glenn Ford as Montgomery, Janet Blair as his wife Regina (née Cleary), whom he had married in 1910, and Charles Ruggles. The stunt pilots for the film were Paul Mantz, Paul Tuntland and Don Stevens. The film included several different historical reenactments of Montgomery&#x27;s glider flights. &quot;Gallant Journey&quot; premiered in San Diego, California on September 2, 1946, and had its full national release September 24, 1946. As part of the publicity for the movie, Columbia Pictures sponsored a cross-country Boston to Los Angeles tour featuring a 1911 vintage auto, the same vintage as Montgomery&#x27;s last flight. William Wellman had served previously in the U.S. Army Air Corps and was stationed as an officer at Rockwell Field, San Diego, California and Glenn Ford had also served in San Diego during World War II.

==Recognition==
===Historical landmarks===

Two California Historical Landmarks are associated with Montgomery:

*Montgomery Memorial, Otay Mesa. The Montgomery Memorial was dedicated on May 21, 1950, and features a silver static test wing panel for the Consolidated B-32 Dominator mounted upright that is visible for miles. It is also associated with a recreation center near the location of his first glides (Montgomery-Waller Recreation Center, San Diego, California). The memorial was designed by pioneering modernist Lloyd Ruocco.
*Montgomery Hill, San Jose near Evergreen Valley College. Evergreen Valley College also honors his memory with a green space (Montgomery Grove), a lecture hall (Montgomery Hall), and an observatory (Montgomery Hill Observatory). On March 15, 2008, a sculpture was unveiled at San Felipe and Yerba Buena roads in San Jose, California as a tribute to Montgomery. The 30-foot-tall steel structure of a glider wing was placed on a 32-foot-diameter plaza (later designated Montgomery Plaza) designed by San Francisco artist Kent Roberts.

===Airports and aviation clubs===
In 1919, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors changed the name of the Marina Flying Field just east of Crissy Field to &quot;Montgomery Field.&quot; From 1920 to 1944 Montgomery Field served as an airmail facility. This field still exists along the Embarcadero as Marina Green.

On May 20, 1950, Montgomery Field (KMYF) in San Diego, California, one of the busiest general aviation airports in the world, was named in his honor.

Civil Air Patrol Squadron 36 in San Jose, California is named the &quot;John J. Montgomery Memorial Cadet Squadron 36&quot; in his honor. Their motto is &quot;Exceed the Challenge.&quot; Experimental Aircraft Association Chapter 338 in San Jose, California is also named in honor of Montgomery.

John J. Montgomery was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1964, U.S. Soaring Hall of Fame in 2001, California Aviation Hall of Fame in 2015., and International Aerospace Hall of Fame in 2017.

In 1924, a new engineering building was dedicated as the Montgomery Laboratories on the campus of Santa Clara University. This laboratory was located where Mayer Theatre is today. A celebration was held March 18, 1934 at Santa Clara University to mark the 50th anniversary of Montgomery&#x27;s first glider flight. Also on the campus of Santa Clara University, an obelisk was dedicated by the citizens of Santa Clara, California to Montgomery on April 29, 1946, at the location of Maloney&#x27;s 1905 glider flights.

In 1949, a section of what is now part of the Interstate 5 freeway that passes through the former site of the Montgomery 1880s Fruitland Ranch and goes from the Mexican border to downtown San Diego, California was named the John J. Montgomery Freeway.

In the 1960s, the National Society of Aerospace Professionals and the San Diego Aerospace Museum established a John J. Montgomery Award for aerospace excellence. Members of the X-15, Mercury, and Polaris programs received the award, including astronauts such as Neil Armstrong.

On May 11, 1996, Montgomery&#x27;s 1883 glider was recognized as an International Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.

On March 19, 2005, John J. Montgomery was the focus of a &quot;Centennial Celebration of Soaring Flight&quot;, held in Aptos, California at the location of some of his early glider experiments. At this celebration, a marker was placed in Aptos in honor of the first manned high−altitude flights.
On April 5, 2008, a celebration of the 125th anniversary of John Montgomery&#x27;s first glide took place at the Hiller Aviation Museum in San Carlos, California.

In May 2016, the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum established a new exhibit for John J. Montgomery in their main rotunda, including &quot;The Evergreen&quot; glider from 1911 and Montgomery&#x27;s original &quot;Soaring Flight&quot; manuscript from 1896. In 2017, Montgomery was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the Museum.

In June 2023, a replica of &quot;The Santa Clara&quot; glider was installed in the lobby of Crownair Aviation at Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport in San Diego. The glider is on loan from the San Diego Air and Space Museum.

Also in 2023, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers established a new annual &quot;John J. Montgomery Award for Distinguished Innovation in Aerospace&quot; designed to &quot;recognize the outstanding contribution of an individual engineer residing in the international community who has researched, designed or developed (or any combination thereof) new technologies or equipment for the aerospace industry, i.e., propulsion, aerospace structure/materials, stability and control, etc.&quot;

<text>Lollywood is Pakistan&#x27;s film industry, which has served as the base for both Urdu- and Punjabi-language film production.

Lahore has been the center of Pakistani cinema since independence in 1947. However, with Urdu film hub largely shifting to Karachi by 2007, film industry in Lahore became synonymous with Pakistani Punjabi film Industry.

The word &quot;Lollywood&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;Lahore&quot; and &quot;Hollywood&quot;, coined in 1989 by &quot;Glamour&quot; magazine gossip columnist Saleem Nasir, and is usually used comparatively with respect to other film industries in South Asian cinema.

== Etymology ==

&quot;Lollywood&quot; is a portmanteau derived from Lahore and &quot;Hollywood&quot;, a shorthand reference for the American film industry, Hollywood.

== History ==

Prior to the 1947 partition of India into the Republic of India and Pakistan, the Lahore film industry was initially part of the British Raj-era cinema of India. The Bombay cinema industry (now known as Hindi cinema or &quot;Bollywood&quot; in modern India) was closely linked to the Lahore film industry, as both produced films in the Hindustani language, also known as Hindi-Urdu, the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of northern and central British India. Many actors, filmmakers and musicians from the Lahore industry migrated to the Bombay industry during the 1940s, including actors K. L. Saigal, Prithviraj Kapoor, Dilip Kumar and Dev Anand as well as playback singers Mohammed Rafi, Noorjahan and Shamshad Begum. After the 1947 partition and the foundation of Pakistan, the Lahore film industry transitioned to becoming the centre of the new Pakistani cinema.

== Films ==

Lollywood films in Punjabi were most popular in the 1960s and are often referred to as the &quot;golden age&quot; of Pakistani Punjabi cinema.

<doc id="493931" wikidata="Q656955" url="?curid=493931" title="Combtooth blenny">
<text>Combtooth blennies are blenniiformids; percomorph marine fish of the family Blenniidae, part of the order Blenniiformes. They are the largest family of blennies with around 401 known species in 58 genera. Combtooth blennies are found in tropical and subtropical waters in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans; some species are also found in brackish and even freshwater environments.

==Description==

The body plan of the combtooth blennies is archetypal to all other blennioids; their blunt heads and eyes are large, with large continuous dorsal fins (which may have three to 17 spines). Their bodies are compressed, elongated, and scaleless; their small, slender pelvic fins (which are absent in only two species) are situated before their enlarged pectoral fins, and their tail fins are rounded. As their name would suggest, combtooth blennies are noted for the comb-like teeth lining their jaws.

By far the largest species is the eel-like hairtail blenny at 53 cm in length; most other members of the family are much smaller. Combtooth blennies are active and often highly colourful, making them popular in the aquarium hobby.

==Habitat and behaviour==

Generally benthic fish, combtooth blennies spend much of their time on or near the bottom. They may inhabit the rocky crevices of reefs, burrows in sandy or muddy substrates, or even empty shells. Generally found in shallow waters, some combtooth blennies are capable of leaving the water for short periods during low tide, aided by their large pectoral fins which act as &quot;feet&quot;. Small benthic crustaceans, mollusks, and other sessile invertebrates are the primary food items for most species; others eat algae or plankton.

One exceptional group of combtooth blennies deserves special mention: the so-called sabre-toothed blennies of the genera &quot;Aspidontus&quot;, &quot;Meiacanthus&quot;, &quot;Petroscirtes&quot;, &quot;Plagiotremus&quot;, and &quot;Xiphasia&quot;. These blennies have fang-like teeth with venom glands at their bases. Species of the genera &quot;Aspidontus&quot; and &quot;Plagiotremus&quot; (such as the false cleanerfish) are noted for their cunning mimicry of cleaner wrasses: by imitating the latter&#x27;s colour, form, and behaviour, the blennies are able to trick other fish (or even divers) into letting down their guard, long enough for the blennies to nip a quick mouthful of skin or scale.

Some combtooth blennies form small groups, while others are solitary and territorial. They may be either diurnal or nocturnal, depending on the species. Females lay eggs in shells or under rock ledges; males guard the nest of eggs until hatching. 

In some species, the eggs may remain in the oviduct of the female until hatched. The fry of some species undergo an &#x27;ophioblennius&#x27; stage, wherein the fish are pelagic (i.e., inhabiting the midwater) and have greatly enlarged pectoral fins and hooked teeth.

<text>Sir Alfred Cecil Walker (17 December 1924 – 3 January 2007) was an Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) politician, who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for North Belfast from 1983 to 2001.

== Biography ==
Walker was born in Belfast. His father was a police constable. He was educated at Everton Elementary School, Model Boys&#x27; School, and Belfast Methodist College. He worked for the Belfast timber trader James P. Corry after leaving school in 1941 until he was elected to Parliament in 1983. He married Ann Verrant in 1953. They had two sons.

He became actively involved in Unionist politics in the 1970s, was an unsuccessful pro-White Paper Unionist candidate at the election to the 1973 Northern Ireland Assembly and was elected to Belfast City Council in 1977. He contested the Belfast North constituency in the 1979 general election, narrowly losing to John McQuade of the Democratic Unionist Party. He won the seat 4 years later, in the 1983 general election, after McQuade retired. He was one of the MPs with the lowest attendance rate at Westminster.

Along with all other Unionist MPs, he resigned his seat in December 1985 in protest at the Anglo-Irish Agreement. He was re-elected at a by-election in January 1986. In 1988, he advocated internment of Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) suspects to stem a series of murders, but also argued for the internment of suspects connected with the Ulster Defence Association and the Ulster Volunteer Force. In 1998, he was one of only two UUP MPs to support the Good Friday Agreement without reservation, and he backed UUP leader David Trimble until the end of Trimble&#x27;s own political career in 2005.

However, he lost his own seat to Nigel Dodds of the DUP in the 2001 general election, following a disastrous televised debate at Crumlin Road Courthouse in his constituency, in which he stumbled over some of the most rudimentary questions. His vote declined from 21,000 to 4,000, his 13,000 majority was transformed into a 6,000 majority for the DUP and he was beaten into fourth place behind Sinn Féin and the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) - although this was also partly because there had been no DUP candidate in the previous general election.

He was noted for the moderation of his Unionist views, which contrasted with the deep sectarian divisions in his constituency. He said he would have no objection to amending the Act of Settlement 1701 to allow the heir to the throne to marry a Roman Catholic, and caused controversy in 2001 by saying that a united Ireland in 30 years time may not be a bad thing, though he later said that was a &quot;throwaway line that has been taken out of context&quot;. He was created a Knight Bachelor in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours in June 2002.

==Death==
He lived in Glengormley, in County Antrim, and died of a heart attack in Newtownabbey. He was survived by his wife and their two sons.

<text>Ceolred (died 716) was king of Mercia from 709 to 716.

== Mercia at the end of the 7th century ==

By the end of the 7th century, England was almost entirely divided into kingdoms ruled by the Anglo-Saxons, who had come to Britain two hundred years earlier. The kingdom of Mercia occupied what is now the English Midlands, bordered by Northumbria to the north, East Anglia to the east, and Wessex, the kingdom of the West Saxons, to the south. Essex, the kingdom of the East Saxons, included London and lay between East Anglia and the kingdom of Kent.

The main source for this period is Bede&#x27;s &quot;Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot; (Ecclesiastical History of the English People), completed in about 731. Despite its focus on the history of the church, this work provides valuable information about the early Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. Bede had informants who supplied him with details of the church&#x27;s history in Wessex and Kent, but he appears to have had no such contact in Mercia. Charters of Ceolred&#x27;s, recording royal grants of land to individuals and to religious houses, also survive, as does the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, compiled in Wessex at the end of the 9th century, but incorporating earlier material.

== Ancestry and reign ==

Ceolred&#x27;s father, Æthelred, came to throne of Mercia in 675 on the death of his brother, Wulfhere. Æthelred abdicated in 704 and went to Rome, leaving the kingdom to his nephew Coenred, Wulfhere&#x27;s son.

The reduced prestige of both Ceolred and his predecessor, Coenred, may have stirred unrest among the Mercian nobility: Æthelbald was in exile during Ceolred&#x27;s reign, and the survival of a hostile account of Ceolred may indicate a more general dissatisfaction with the ruling line.

In 709 Coenred abdicated in favour of Ceolred. Coenred went to Rome and was made a monk there by Pope Constantine. Historians have generally accepted Bede&#x27;s report of Coenred&#x27;s abdication, but Barbara Yorke has suggested that he may not have relinquished his throne voluntarily. There are instances of kings being forcibly removed and placed in holy orders to make them ineligible for kingship; one such was King Osred II of Northumbria, who was forced into a monastery.

Ceolred was Æthelred&#x27;s son, but his mother was not Osthryth, Æthelred&#x27;s only recorded wife. He may have still been young at the time of his accession. Much of what is recorded about Ceolred is highly negative, accusing him of crimes and immorality; this may reflect poor treatment of the Church. In 715, the Mercians under Ceolred fought a battle at &quot;Woden&#x27;s Barrow&quot;, either against the West Saxons under Ine or together with them against an unnamed opponent, possibly the British; the outcome of this battle was not recorded.

== Charters ==
Ceolred confirmed a grant to Waldhere, the Bishop of London, evidence that London was firmly under Mercian overlordship. Later Mercian kings treated London as their direct possession, rather than as a province ruled by an underking, but Ceolred did not go that far. Three possibly genuine charters of Ceolred&#x27;s have survived.

== Death and succession ==
In the next year, Ceolred died; Saint Boniface later described him as dying in a crazed frenzy at a banquet, &quot;gibbering with demons and cursing the priests of God&quot;. Æthelbald, a member of another branch of the Mercian royal line who had been forced into exile during Ceolred&#x27;s rule, succeeded him.

== Family ==
He was related to Coenred, the brother of Saint Werburgh of Mercia.

<text>The Curtiss P-36 Hawk, also known as the Curtiss Hawk Model 75, is an American-designed and built fighter aircraft of the 1930s and 40s. A contemporary of the Hawker Hurricane and Messerschmitt Bf 109, it was one of the first of a new generation of combat aircraft—a sleek monoplane design with a retractable undercarriage making extensive use of metal in its construction.

Perhaps best known as the predecessor of the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, the P-36 saw little combat with the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. It was the fighter used most extensively and successfully by the French Air Force during the Battle of France. The P-36 was also ordered by the governments of the Netherlands and Norway but did not arrive in time to see action before both were occupied by Nazi Germany. The type was also manufactured under license in China, for the Republic of China Air Force, as well as in British India, for the Royal Air Force (RAF) and Royal Indian Air Force (RIAF).

Axis and co-belligerent air forces also made significant use of captured P-36s. Following the fall of France and Norway in 1940, several dozen P-36s were seized by Germany and transferred to Finland; these aircraft saw extensive action with the Finnish Air Force against the Soviet Air Forces. The P-36 was also used by Vichy French air forces in several minor conflicts; in one of these, the Franco-Thai War of 1940–41, P-36s were used by both sides.

From mid-1940, some P-36s en route for France and the Netherlands were diverted to Allied air forces in other parts of the world. The Hawks ordered by the Netherlands were diverted to the Dutch East Indies and later saw action against Japanese forces. French orders were taken up by British Commonwealth air forces, and saw combat with the South African Air Force (SAAF) against Italian forces in East Africa, and with the RAF over Burma. Within the Commonwealth, the type was usually referred to as the Curtiss Mohawk.

With around 1,000 aircraft built by Curtiss, the P-36 was a commercial success for the company. It also became the basis of the P-40 and two unsuccessful prototypes: the P-37 and the XP-42.

==Design and development==
The Curtiss Model 75 was a private venture by the company, designed by former Northrop Aircraft Company engineer Don R. Berlin. The first prototype, constructed in 1934, featured all-metal construction with fabric-covered control surfaces, a Wright XR-1670-5 radial engine developing , and typical United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) armament of one and one machine gun firing through the propeller arc. Also typical of the time was the total absence of cockpit armor or self-sealing fuel tanks. The distinctive landing gear, which rotated 90° to fold the main wheels flat into the thin trailing portion of the wing, resting atop the lower ends of the maingear struts when retracted, was a Boeing-patented design for which Curtiss had to pay royalties.

The prototype first flew on 6 May 1935, reaching at during early test flights. On 27 May 1935, the prototype was flown to Wright Field, Ohio, to compete in the USAAC fly-off for a new single-seat fighter, but the contest was delayed because the Seversky entry crashed on its way there. Curtiss took advantage of the delay to replace the unreliable engine with a Wright XR-1820-39 Cyclone producing and to rework the fuselage, adding the distinctive scalloped rear windows to improve visibility. The new prototype was designated Model 75B with the R-1670 version retroactively designated Model 75D. The fly-off finally took place in April 1936. Unfortunately, the new engine failed to deliver its rated power and the aircraft only reached .

Although the competing Seversky P-35 also underperformed and was more expensive, it was still declared the winner and awarded a contract for 77 aircraft. However, on 16 June 1936, Curtiss received an order from USAAC for three prototypes designated Y1P-36. The USAAC was concerned about political turmoil in Europe, and about Seversky&#x27;s ability to deliver P-35s in a timely manner, and therefore wanted a backup fighter. The Y1P-36 (Model 75E) was powered by a 900 hp Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830-13 Twin Wasp engine, and the scalloped rear canopy was further enlarged. The new aircraft performed so well that it won the 1937 USAAC competition with an order for 210 P-36A fighters.

The aircraft&#x27;s extremely low wing loading of just 23.9 lb/ft2 gave it outstanding turning performance, and its high power-to-weight ratio of 0.186 hp/lb gave superb climbing performance for the time. The single speed supercharger was a serious handicap at high altitudes. Compared to the later Allison-engined P-40, the P-36 shared the P-40&#x27;s traits of excellent high-speed handling, roll rate that improved at high speed, and relatively light controls at high speed. However, it was underpowered, affecting its acceleration and top speed, and it did not accelerate in a dive as well as the P-40.

==Operational history==

===Argentina===
Argentina bought a number of the simplified, fixed landing gear Hawk 75Os, (intended for rough-field operations and ease of maintenance) and purchased a manufacturing license for the type; 30 were built and delivered by Curtiss, and 20 produced locally. These aircraft used the same engine, Wright Cyclone R-1820-G5 as the Martin 139WAA&#x27;s and Northrop 8A-2s used by the Argentine Army Aviation at the time. Usually armed with one Madsen machine gun heavily modified for aircraft use and three Madsen light machine guns, there was provision for up to 10 bombs on underwing pylons. The last Argentinian Hawks remained in service until November 1954.

===Brazil===
In March 1942, 10 USAAC P-36As were transferred to Brazil.

===British Commonwealth===
The Royal Air Force (RAF) also displayed interest in the aircraft. Comparison of a borrowed French Hawk 75A-2 with a Supermarine Spitfire Mk I revealed that the Hawk had several advantages over the early variant of the iconic British fighter. The Hawk was found to have lighter controls than the Spitfire at speeds over , especially in diving attacks, and was easier to maneuver in a dogfight (thanks to the less sensitive elevator). The Hawk also had better all-around visibility
and was easier to control on takeoff and landing. Not surprisingly, the Spitfire&#x27;s superior acceleration and top speed ultimately gave it the advantage of being able to engage and leave combat at will.

Although the British decided not to purchase the aircraft, they soon came into possession of 229 Hawks by way of shipments diverted from occupied France and aircraft flown by escaping French pilots. The aircraft received the designations Mohawk I through IV, mirroring French Hawk 75A-1 through A-4, and were fitted with 0.303-cal. machine guns and conventional throttles (forward to increase power).

Although the Hawk was considered obsolete, a number saw service with the RAF and Royal Indian Air Force (RIAF) in India and Burma. In April 1941, the government of British India ordered 48 Cyclone-powered Mohawk IVz (Hawk 75A) for the RIAF, to be built by Hindustan Aircraft. The first such aircraft completed was test flown on 31 July 1942. Only four additional aircraft were completed before the project was abandoned. However, Chinese license production of the Hawk 75A-5 was moved to India, and these aircraft were also absorbed into the RAF/RIAF as Mohawk IVs. They were supplemented by 10 Hawk 75A-9s that were captured in Iran, during the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran of August 1941. A further 74 Mohawk IVs that had originally been ordered by France were shipped to India from the United Kingdom. The only RAF units to see combat in Mohawks were No. 5 Squadron RAF and No. 155 Squadron RAF, using the type mainly for bomber escort and ground attack. The type was retired by the RAF/RIAF in 1944.

The South African Air Force received 72 Mohawks. Its first Mohawks were delivered to East Africa in mid-1941, where they were used by 3 Squadron SAAF to support operations in the East African Campaign, taking part in the Battle of Gondar which ended the campaign, and helping to patrol the border with Vichy French held Djibouti. These Mohawks were then sent to South Africa, where, supplemented by fresh deliveries, they were used for training and for home defense.

===China===
The prototype of the Hawk 75H—a simplified version with fixed landing gear, like the 75O—was eventually sold to the Chinese Nationalist government who presented it to Claire L. Chennault for personal use. China also received two similar demonstrators, the Hawk 75Q. They also used a number of simplified Hawk 75Ms against the Japanese. On 11 January 1939, five Hawk 75Ms of the veteran CAF 25th Fighter Squadron led by commander Liu Yijun (劉依鈞) were flown to the new wartime capital of Chongqing in preparations for defense duties there; Liu Yijun and his four specially-trained Hawk 75 pilots all died in the crash of transport aircraft in the return flight. These Hawk 75Ms were intended for the newly established 16th and 18th Fighter Squadrons that were previously light attack-bomber squadrons, but did not supersede the increasingly obsolescent Polikarpov I-15 and I-16 that formed the backbone of most of China&#x27;s fighter squadrons from 1938 to 1941. The Hawk 75A-5 was built under license in China, but production was later moved to India, and these aircraft were absorbed into the RAF as the Mohawk IV.

===Finland===
After the fall of France, Germany agreed to sell captured Curtiss Hawk fighters to Finland in October 1940. In total, 44 captured aircraft of five subtypes were sold to Finland with three deliveries from 23 June 1941 – 5 January 1944. Not all were from the French stocks, 13 were initially sold to Norway and captured when the Germans conquered that country. The aircraft were given serial codes CU-501 to CU-507 (A-4 submodel with Cyclone) and CU-551 to CU-587 (all other submodels with Twin Wasp).

In Finnish service, the Hawk was well liked, affectionately called &quot;Sussu&quot; (&quot;Sweetheart&quot;). The Finnish Air Force enjoyed success with the type, credited with 190⅓ kills by 58 pilots, between 16 July 1941 and 27 July 1944, for the loss of 15 of their own. Finnish Hawk pilots included the type&#x27;s highest-scoring ace, Altto Kalevi &quot;Kale&quot; Tervo, with between 14¼ and 15¾ victories in the type; another ace, Kyösti &quot;Kössi&quot; Karhila, scored 12¼ or 13¼ of his 32¼ victories in the Hawk.

The Finnish Hawks were initially armed with either four or six 7.5mm machine guns. While sufficient during the early phase of the Continuation War, the increasing speeds and armor of Soviet aircraft soon showed this armament was not powerful enough. From 1942, the State Aircraft Factory replaced the fuselage machine guns with either one or two Colt or Browning FN machine guns and installed two or four Browning machine guns in each wing. The 12.7mm Berezin UB or LKk/42 heavy machine guns were also used. The installation of heavier armament did not change the very good flying characteristics of the fighter, and the armament was much more effective against Soviet aircraft. The Finnish Hawks were also equipped with Revi 3D or C/12D gunsight.

Surviving Finnish aircraft remained in service with the FAF aviation units HLeLv 13, HLeLv 11 and LeSK until 30 August 1948, when the last operational Finnish Hawks were put into storage. In 1953, the stored aircraft were scrapped.

===France===
Even before the P-36A entered production, the French Air Force entered negotiations with Curtiss for delivery of 300 aircraft. The negotiating process ended up being very drawn-out because the cost of the Curtiss fighters was double that of the French Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 and Bloch MB.150, and the delivery schedule was deemed too slow. Since the USAAC was unhappy with the rate of domestic deliveries and believed that export aircraft would slow things down even more, it actively opposed the sale. Eventually, it took direct intervention from U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt to give the French test pilot Michel Detroyat a chance to fly the Y1P-36.

Detroyat&#x27;s enthusiasm, problems with the MB.150, and the pressure of continuing German rearmament finally forced France to purchase 100 aircraft and 173 engines. The first Hawk 75A-1 (or H75A-1 n°1) arrived in France in December 1938 and began entering service in March 1939. A few months later, this aircraft was part of &quot;Groupe de Chasse II/5 La Fayette&quot; (heir of the Escadrille Lafayette that fought in France during World War I), wearing the famous Sioux Head on its fuselage side. After the first few examples, aircraft were delivered in pieces and assembled in France by the &quot;Société Nationale de Constructions Aéronautiques du Centre&quot;.

Officially designated as the Curtiss H75-C1 (the &quot;Hawk&quot; name was not used in France), the aircraft were powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1830-SC-G engines of 900 hp and had instruments calibrated for the metric system, a seat for French dorsal parachutes, a French-style throttle which operated in reverse from U.S. and British aircraft (full throttle was to the rear rather than to the front) and armament of four (later models had six with two firing through the prop and four in the wings) 7.5 mm FN-Browning machine guns, aimed with a French-supplied Baille-Lemaire gun sight. The aircraft evolved through several modifications, the most significant being the installation of the Wright R-1820 Cyclone engine. The H75-C1 variant saw little operational use due to its late delivery and reliability problems with the Wright radial engine. A total of 316 H75s were delivered to France before the German occupation.
On 20 September, Sergeant André-Armand Legrand, pilot of the H75A-1 n°1 in the &quot;Groupe de Chasse II/5 La Fayette&quot; was credited of the first Allied air victory of World War II on the Western front with shooting down a Messerschmitt Bf 109E of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; 3/JG 53, over Überherrn. During 1939–1940, French H75 pilots claimed 230 air-to-air kills (of a total of 1,009 air-to-air kills by the French Air Force during 1939–1940) and 81 probable victories in H75s against only 29 aircraft lost in aerial combat. While making up only 12.6 per cent of the French Air Force single-seater fighter force, the H75 accounted for almost a third of the air-to-air kills during the 1940 Battle of France.

Of the 11 French aces of the early part of the war, seven flew H75s. The leading ace of the time was Lieutenant Edmond Marin la Meslée with 15 confirmed and five probable victories in the type. H75-equipped squadrons were evacuated to French North Africa before the Armistice to avoid capture by the Germans. While under the Vichy government, these units clashed with British aircraft during the Battle of Mers El-Kebir and the Battle of Dakar. During Operation Torch in North Africa, French H75s fought against U.S. Navy F4F Wildcats, losing 15 aircraft while shooting down seven American aircraft. From late 1942, the Allies started re-equipping the formerly Vichy-controlled French H75 units with P-40s and P-39s; despite this they still saw limited service with the Free French Air Forces.

===Iran===

The Hawk 75A-9 variant was also ordered by the Imperial State of Iran (previously Persia). In or before mid-1941, 10 of these aircraft arrived in Iran, partly-assembled and in crates. They had not been assembled by the time of the Allied invasion of Iran. Seized by Commonwealth forces, these Hawk 75s were shipped to India, where they were assembled and used by the RAF/RIAF, as the Mohawk Mk. IV.

===Dutch East Indies===
In October 1939, the Netherlands ordered 24 Hawk 75A-7s for their colonies of the Dutch East Indies (&quot;Oost Indië&quot;). These planes were powered by 1,200 hp Cyclones. Factory armament was one .50 inch and one .303 inch machine gun in the cowl with two .303 machine guns in the wings. After delivery, the .50 weapons were replaced to standardize parts and ammo. The plane could carry six bombs. The fighters were shipped in 1940 and almost rerouted to the Netherlands when Germany invaded. But as the mainland surrendered, the aircraft continued to the colonies where they were used extensively against the Japanese attack on the Far Eastern part of the kingdom. By that time, the aircraft had flown so many hours that the engines were showing serious wear and tear.

Most Dutch Hawks were assigned to the &quot;1ste JachtVliegAfdeling - VliegtuigGroep IV&quot; (1ste JaVA - 1-VlG IV; &quot;1st Fighter Squadron - Flying Group IV&quot;) of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army Air Force (ML-KNIL), although some flew with 1-VlG V. These aircraft saw action over Malacca, Sumatra and Java, successfully bombing the railroad and intercepting bombers and participated in the extensive dogfights over Soerabaja, where USAAF, RAF and ML aircraft fought Japanese bombers and fighters together.

===Norway===

Norway ordered 24 Twin Wasp-powered Hawk 75A-6s, of which 19 were delivered and seven assembled at the time of the German invasion. None of the aircraft were combat-ready. The disassembled aircraft were disabled by a single customs employee who smashed the instruments and cut all the wires he could reach. Thirteen Norwegian Hawks captured by the Germans were part of the first batch of 29 P-36s sent to Finland. Norway also ordered 36 Cyclone-powered Hawk 75A-8s. Most of this batch (a total of 30) were delivered as advanced trainers to &quot;Little Norway&quot; near Toronto, Ontario, Canada, a Norwegian training base established by the London-based government-in-exile. Still later, they were resold to the U.S. and redesignated the P-36G model.

===Peru===
In 1943, the U.S. sent 28 Hawks to Peru under the Lend-Lease agreement. These were ex-Norwegian P-36Gs that had served in Canada.

===Portugal===
Portugal was officially neutral during World War II, although the Allies were allowed to use or establish ports and airfields on various Portuguese territories. One result of these friendly relations was the transfer by the British government of 12 Hawk 75A variants to the Portuguese Air Force, or &quot;Força Aérea Portuguesa&quot; (FAP), which assigned them to air defense duties in the Azores.

===Thailand===

A few Hawk 75Ns were used by Thailand during the French-Thai War. They also fought at the Battle of Prachuab Khirikhan against Japanese forces during the Japanese Invasion of Thailand. On 28 January 1941, the Royal Thai Air Force (RTAF) dispatched nine Ki-30 Nagoyas, escorted by three Hawk 75s, to bomb Pailin and Sisophon in French Indochina. Thailand was perhaps the only country operating both Japanese and American aircraft just before World War II.

===United States===
The first production P-36As were delivered to the 20th Pursuit Group at Barksdale Field in Louisiana in April 1938. The aircraft&#x27;s service history was marred by numerous teething problems with the engine exhaust, skin buckling over landing gear, and weak points in the airframe, severely restricting the performance envelope. By the time these issues were resolved, the P-36 was considered obsolete and was relegated to training units and overseas detachments at Albrook Field in the Panama Canal Zone, Elmendorf Field in Alaska, and Wheeler Field in Hawaii.

The P-36s had been delivered to Hawaii in February 1941 by being loaded on the aircraft carrier USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; in California, then in a first for the USAAC, flown off the carrier&#x27;s deck by the P-36&#x27;s U.S. Army Air Corps pilots when the &quot;Enterprise&quot; neared the coast of Hawaii. This saved considerable time over the traditional shipping method of having the fighters first disassembled, crated and then loaded by crane in the hold of a freighter, then unloaded and reassembled in Hawaii.

The only combat by U.S.-operated P-36s took place during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Five of the 39 P-36A Hawks at Pearl Harbor, delivered previously by the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, were able to take off during the attack and were credited with shooting down two Japanese Mitsubishi A6M2 Zeros for the loss of one P-36, thereby scoring U.S. aerial victories that were among the first of the Second World War.

<text>Sarah Lois Harmer (born November 12, 1970) is a Canadian singer, songwriter and environmental activist.

==Early life==
Born and raised in Burlington, Ontario, Harmer gained her first exposure to the musical lifestyle as a teenager, when her older sister started taking her to Tragically Hip concerts.

==Career==
At the age of 17, Harmer was invited to join a Toronto band, The Saddletramps. For three years, she performed with them while pursuing her studies in philosophy and women&#x27;s studies at Queen&#x27;s University.

After leaving The Saddletramps, Harmer put together a band of her own with several Kingston, Ontario musicians, and chose the name Weeping Tile. The band released its first independent cassette in 1994. Soon afterward, they signed to a major label, and the cassette was re-released in 1995 as &quot;Eepee&quot;. The band performed regularly on the rock club circuit and on campus radio with their subsequent albums, but never broke through to the mainstream, and broke up in 1998 after being dropped from their label.

Also in 1998, Harmer recorded a set of pop standards as a Christmas gift for her father. After hearing it, her friends and family convinced her to release it as an album, and in 1999 she released it independently as &quot;Songs for Clem&quot;. Harmer began working on another album, and in 2000, she released &quot;You Were Here&quot;. In 2001 she toured around Canada and the US in support of the album.

A poppier, more laid-back effort than her work with Weeping Tile, &quot;You Were Here&quot; was a commercial success, and led to the hit singles &quot;Basement Apartment&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Get Your Back Up&quot;. The album also appeared on many critics&#x27; year-end lists, including &quot;TIME&quot; magazine, which called it the year&#x27;s best debut album. It was eventually certified platinum for sales of 100,000 copies in Canada. Almost half of the album (including both of its major hits) consisted of songs she had previously recorded with Weeping Tile or The Saddletramps.

In 2002, her song &quot;Silver Road&quot; was featured as the lead track of the soundtrack of the film &quot;Men With Brooms&quot;.

In 2004, she released &quot;All of Our Names&quot;. The album included the singles &quot;Almost&quot;, which made the top 20 on Canadian pop charts, and &quot;Pendulums&quot;. &quot;All of Our Names&quot; won the JUNO Award for Best Adult Alternative Album, a new award category in 2005.

Her fourth album, &quot;I&#x27;m a Mountain&quot;, was released in Canada in November 2005 and in the United States in February 2006. It was nominated for the 2006 Polaris Music Prize, a jury-selected $20,000 cash prize for the Canadian album of the year. Also in 2005 she had an acting role in Anita Doron&#x27;s film &quot;The End of Silence&quot;.

Harmer has also appeared as a guest vocalist on albums by other artists, including Blue Rodeo, Great Big Sea, Rheostatics, Bruce Cockburn, Luther Wright and the Wrongs, Loomer, Skydiggers, The Weakerthans, Neko Case, Great Lake Swimmers, The Tragically Hip and Bob Wiseman.

In February 2007, Harmer received three Juno Award nominations. &quot;I&#x27;m a Mountain&quot; was nominated for Best Adult Alternative Album and her DVD &quot;Escarpment Blues&quot; won the JUNO Award for Best Music DVD. Harmer herself was also nominated for Songwriter of the Year for her work on &quot;I Am Aglow&quot;, &quot;Oleander&quot; and &quot;Escarpment Blues&quot;.

In 2010, Harmer released a fifth album, &quot;Oh Little Fire&quot;, which was nominated for three Juno Awards. The album signaled a shift toward a more rock-based sound.

In 2011, Harmer participated in the National Parks Project, visiting British Columbia&#x27;s Gwaii Haanas National Park Reserve and Haida Heritage Site with Bry Webb, Jim Guthrie and filmmaker Scott Smith. She was also commissioned by CBC Radio 2 to write an original campfire song for the network.

On August 19, 2016, Harmer and Jim Creeggan appeared on CBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Q&quot; to perform a live cover of The Tragically Hip&#x27;s &quot;Morning Moon&quot;. That year Harmer also performed at the Edmonton Folk Music Festival.

In 2018, Harmer contributed the song &quot;Just Get Here&quot; to the compilation album &quot;The Al Purdy Songbook&quot;. In the same year, she performed at the Juno Awards of 2018 in a tribute to the late Gord Downie, performing a medley of &quot;Introduce Yerself&quot; and &quot;Bobcaygeon&quot; in collaboration with Dallas Green and Kevin Hearn.

Her newest album, &quot;Are You Gone&quot;, was released in February 2020 on Arts &amp; Crafts. It was longlisted for the 2020 Polaris Music Prize, and nominated for Best Adult Alternative Album at the Juno Awards of 2021.

==Activism==

In 2005, Harmer co-founded PERL (Protecting Escarpment Rural Land), an organization which campaigned to protect the Niagara Escarpment from a proposed gravel development which would see some parts of wilderness near the escarpment removed. To support the organization, she and her acoustic band embarked on a tour of the escarpment, hiking the Bruce Trail and performing at theatres and community halls in towns along the way. A documentary DVD of this tour was released in 2006 as &quot;Escarpment Blues&quot;. Harmer also coauthored a book about the campaign, &quot;The Last Stand: A Journey Through the Ancient Cliff-Face Forest of the Niagara Escarpment&quot;, which was published in 2007. In October 2012, PERL won their case against the development.

Harmer has performed and canvassed in support of the NDP and politician Marilyn Churley, who also promoted the protection of the Niagara Escarpment. She has also performed in support of Ontario Green Party Leader and MPP Mike Schreiner.

On March 24, 2018, she joined the demonstration at Kinder Morgan&#x27;s Burnaby Terminal to protest against the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline.

In February 2019, she spoke against the Ontario government&#x27;s proposed Bill 66 at a Kingston City Council meeting.

In January 2022, Sarah helped launch the Reform Gravel Mining Coalition with co-chair Graham Flint. The RGMC seeks to reform the gravel mining industry in Ontario.

==Family==
Her niece Georgia Harmer, the daughter of Sarah&#x27;s sister Mary with their former Weeping Tile bandmate Gord Tough, is a singer-songwriter whose debut album &quot;Stay in Touch&quot; was released in April 2022 on Arts &amp; Crafts Productions.

<doc id="493947" wikidata="Q5083352" url="?curid=493947" title="Charles Wardle">
<text>Charles Frederick Wardle (born 23 August 1939) is a retired British businessman and politician who was the Conservative Member of Parliament for Bexhill and Battle from 1983 until 2001. In April 2001 for the last four weeks of his parliamentary career he sat without the Conservative whip because he and a group of his Conservative constituency workers would not endorse his successor, Greg Barker, until questions were answered about Barker&#x27;s activities in Russia and about money he had obtained offshore. Later the Russian oligarch, whose company employed Barker, was sanctioned in the United States of America and in the United Kingdom.

==Early life and education==
Charles Wardle is the son of Frederick Maclean Wardle, a civil engineer, and Constance (née Roach) the daughter of a Lincolnshire country parson. Raised in Tunbridge Wells he was educated at Tonbridge School from 1953 to 1958. Too young for National Service, he served for two years as an assistant district officer in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) and worked for six months in Jamaica before five years at university. At Lincoln College, Oxford, from 1961 to 1964, where he was president of the Junior Common Room and of the Fleming Society, he received an MA in Geography and at Harvard Business School, 1964-66 an MBA.

At Oxford he met Lesley Ann Wells who was reading Modern History at St Hugh&#x27;s College and they married in August 1964 before going to America.

== Business career ==
Graduating from Harvard Business School, Wardle worked in New York, 1966–1969, as assistant to the president of American Express Company; in the City of London, 1969–1971, as a corporate finance executive at Morgan Grenfell and 1971–1974, as managing director of Robert Fraser &amp; Partners; in the West Midlands, 1974–1983, as managing director and from 1977 executive chairman of Benjamin Priest Group plc. He was a member of the CBI National Council and of the Engineering Employers Federation from 1980 until his election to Parliament in 1983.

During his 18 years in Parliament Wardle&#x27;s non-executive part-time business roles included consultancies with the accountants, KPMG, and UniChem plc and the chairmanship of the Ray Powell Group, a KPMG client.

=== Harrods ===
In April 2000, after he had said he would be leaving Parliament the following year, he joined the board of Harrods Ltd as a non-executive director with the prior consent of the leader of the Conservative Party. His constituency association wrote that his private business interests were entirely a matter for himself. Wardle&#x27;s contract with Harrods was submitted to and approved by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards.

After leaving Parliament in 2001, Wardle&#x27;s role at Harrods was upgraded to external affairs director in which capacity he met the prime minister of Thailand in Bangkok six times, the presidents of Pakistan and Chad and the King of Jordan. Having completed 21 months of his three-year contract at Harrods, however, Wardle identified an irregularity in the company&#x27;s business in Thailand. He left the board with the balance of his three-year contract paid in full.

=== International negotiation ===
In 2003–2004 working under the aegis of the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office Wardle negotiated for Lloyd&#x27;s of London insurers the settlement with the state of Libya of outstanding Lockerbie claims brought by the hull insurers of Pan Am 103 and by Pan Am&#x27;s trustee in bankruptcy; and in 2005–2006 he negotiated with the UN Compensation Commission in Geneva the payment to British insurers of claims arising from Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait. These international settlements brought into the UK more than $260 million that had been in dispute since the early 1990s.

==Political career==

===1982–1987===
Wardle joined the Conservative Party’s approved candidates list in 1982. He applied for two seats, Stratford upon Avon and Solihull, reaching the final shortlist for both and was then selected for Bexhill and Battle, winning the seat in the 1983 general election.

In late 1983 he was appointed to the Trade and Industry Select Committee and in early 1984 he was made Parliamentary Private Secretary to Kenneth Clarke, Minister for Health and then to Norman Fowler, Secretary of State for Health and Social Services. Wardle campaigned with neighbouring MPs for local hospitals, by-passes and rail electrification; and campaigned unsuccessfully but with local acclaim to keep the Royal Greenwich Observatory at Herstmonceux.

===1987–1992===
After the 1987 general election Wardle declined the invitation to continue as a Parliamentary Private Secretary; was appointed to the Treasury Select Committee; was made chairman of the Conservative Party’s One Nation Forum; and joined the executive committee of the European Atlantic Alliance. In 1991 he spoke for the Party in Hong Kong, Taiwan, New Zealand and California. Later that year he resumed as a Parliamentary Private Secretary, to Ian Lang, Secretary of State for Scotland.

===1992–1997===
After the 1992 general election Wardle was appointed Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Home Office as Immigration Minister. He also had Commons responsibility for the Police and the Fire Service which were led by Lord Ferrers in the Lords. Wardle took the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Bill through its Commons stages; reviewed entry clearance procedures in Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Hong Kong; and deputised for the Home Secretary at EU Councils of Interior and Justice Ministers in Copenhagen, Athens, Thessaloniki, Brussels and Luxembourg. He took a Police Bill through its standing committee stage; chaired the National Board for Crime Prevention; and chaired meetings of Fire Service chief officers and the Fire Brigades Union.

Moved to the Department of Trade and Industry in July 1994, Wardle led trade delegations to the United States, Canada, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Sweden. As an Energy Minister he participated in the 16th and 17th rounds of North Sea oil and gas licensing; addressed the World Energy Conference at Cartagena; and signed the Energy Charter Treaty in Lisbon. He was also the Government sponsor minister for Birmingham, Walsall and the Black Country. In 1995, after private correspondence and personal exchanges with Prime Minister John Major over fifteen months, Wardle resigned from the Government to speak independently on the need to preserve British border controls within the framework of the European Treaty. The Sunday Express, Daily Telegraph, Daily Mail, The Times, Sunday Times and Independent on Sunday all supported Wardle&#x27;s reasons for his resignation. The issue Wardle raised, to keep in place British immigration controls on non-EU nationals coming to the UK from mainland Europe, was achieved by an opt-out for the UK in European Treaty law at the Amsterdam Intergovernmental Conference in 1997 by the new Labour Government who acknowledged Wardle&#x27;s campaign.

Having left the Government, Wardle was an international observer for the 1996 Russian Presidential Election at Chita, Siberia, and joined a Conservative Central Office team of election advisers to the President of Moldova.

===1997–2001===
After the 1997 general election, Wardle re-joined the Public Accounts Committee. With a member of the Defence Select Committee he attended a Moscow conference with senior Russian military personnel to discuss budgetary control of military field operations; he was part of a Parliamentary delegation to the US Senate, the IMF and the Federal Reserve; spoke for the Conservative Party in the Czech Republic; visited Taipei as a guest of the Taiwanese Government; was an Evelyn Wrench Fellowship speaker for the English Speaking Union in the US; and gave lectures to the Civil Service College.

In January 2000 Wardle was re-adopted unanimously by his constituency association for the next general election expected the following year. In April 2000, however, he informed his association executive that with great personal regret he and his wife had changed their minds about continuing for another Parliament because he needed to revert to his business career to make long-term financial provision after serious illness in their family.

In July 2000 the Bexhill and Battle constituency association interviewed for a new Parliamentary candidate for the next election, having asked Wardle to comment on their list of 186 applicants. Wardle wrote congratulating his successor, but in November 2000 a group of Wardle&#x27;s senior local Conservative supporters voiced concern about the new candidate&#x27;s recent employment in Moscow and the origins of money he had obtained offshore.

Without the Conservative whip at the close of his 18-year Parliamentary career for persisting with questions about Greg Barker’s Russian activities, after the dissolution of Parliament Wardle was approached by Nigel Farage with whom he had no previous contact whatsoever. He met Farage who decided at the last minute to stand in Bexhill and Battle. During Farage’s campaign Wardle told the local press: &quot;I am a Conservative who has decided to lend my support to Farage at this election&quot;.

During the 2001–2005 Parliament Wardle was invited to discuss immigration controls with Tony Blair. He discussed technical issues of immigration control, notably the growing problem of illegal overstayers, with three of Blair&#x27;s Home Secretaries. At the 2005 general election he attended a press conference to demolish a far-fetched Opposition claim that more than 200 UK ports of entry would be manned for immigration control.

Since he left Parliament in 2001 Wardle has not been a member of any political party. From time to time he is consulted on immigration controls. He voted &quot;Leave&quot; in the 2016 referendum.

== Personal life ==
Charles and Lesley Wardle live in Cranbrook, Kent. Their daughter, Dr Sarah Wardle is an academic and poet with five collections of poetry published by Bloodaxe Books.

Wardle is a member of the Travellers Club and the Farmers Club. He is a member of The Pilgrims and is a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society.

<doc id="493956" wikidata="Q843862" url="?curid=493956" title="Baseball Writers' Association of America">
<text>The Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA) is a professional association for journalists writing about Major League Baseball for daily newspapers, magazines, and qualifying websites. The organization was founded in 1908 and is known for its annual awards and voting on membership in the Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Early years==
The BBWAA was founded on October 14, 1908, to improve working conditions for sportswriters in the early part of the 20th century; It also sought to promote uniformity of scoring methods, and to professionalize the press box, such that access was limited only to working reporters, telegraphers, and others who had a reason to be there.

The organization began with 43 founding members. They included Joe S. Jackson, who became the association&#x27;s first president. At that time, Jackson was the sporting editor (today called &quot;sports editor&quot;) of the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;. Also selected as officers were Irving E. Sanborn of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, syndicated columnist Hugh Fullerton, and &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; baseball writer Tim Murnane. A second meeting was held in New York City in December; Sanborn decided he could not serve as an officer at that time, and he was replaced by William Weart of the &quot;Philadelphia Times&quot;. The slate of officers was ratified, and anyone who wrote about baseball in major league cities was eligible for membership. This policy changed, however, in December 1913, at which time it was decided that minor-league baseball writers could also become members. Then, Jackson became a dominant force in the early years of the baseball writers, being elected as president of the association during nine consecutive terms.

Jackson finally retired in 1919, while Sanborn returned to assume the position of president. After that, Jackson became a member of the BBWAA Board of Directors.

===Web membership===
In 2007, the BBWAA opened its membership to web-based writers employed on a full-time basis by &quot;websites that are credentialed by MLB for post-season coverage.&quot;

==Mission==
The organization&#x27;s primary function is to work with Major League Baseball and individual teams to assure clubhouse and press-box access for BBWAA members. In addition, BBWAA members also elect players to the National Baseball Hall of Fame, which is the organization&#x27;s most public function. All writers with 10 continuous years of membership in the BBWAA, plus active BBWAA membership at any time in the preceding 10 years, are eligible to vote for the Hall of Fame. The BBWAA also votes annually for the Kenesaw Mountain Landis Most Valuable Player Award, Cy Young Award, Jackie Robinson Rookie of the Year Award, and Manager of the Year Award in each of the two major leagues. The Hall of Fame also empowers the BBWAA&#x27;s Historical Overview Committee, made up of 11 or 12 veteran BBWAA members, to formulate the annual ballot for the Veterans Committee.

Considering the ready availability of television broadcasts for the majority of baseball games, plus instant access to information through the Internet, some have called into question why the BBWAA has not broadened its membership rules to include broadcasters and researchers. (Similar arguments were made for the inclusion of Web-based journalists, before the BBWAA added Web writers to its ranks in December 2007.)

Others have openly questioned why the BBWAA is involved in the award and Hall of Fame voting processes at all, citing in some cases journalistic integrity and the need to remain unbiased in their coverage of newsworthy events.

==Awards==
===Voting===
The BBWAA&#x27;s most public function is to annually vote on candidates for the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

In addition, the BBWAA is responsible for voting on several annual awards in each major league which are presented annually at the New York chapter&#x27;s dinner:
*Most Valuable Player Award (one for each league)
*Cy Young Award (one for each league)
*Rookie of the Year Award (one for each league)
*Manager of the Year Award (one for each league)

In or about 2000, the BBWAA took over the voting responsibility for the Edgar Martínez Award, given each year to the outstanding designated hitter in the American League.

From 1953 to 1962, the BBWAA presented a &quot;Sophomore of the Year Award&quot; in each league.

In 1997, a 36-member BBWAA panel selected the Major League Baseball All-Time Team.

===BBWAA Career Excellence Award===

The annual BBWAA Career Excellence Award is the highest award given by the BBWAA. First awarded in 1962 to J. G. Taylor Spink, longtime publisher of &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, it was named the J. G. Taylor Spink Award until adopting its current name in February 2021. It has been awarded annually for &quot;meritorious contributions to baseball writing&quot;, except for one year during the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike. Recipients are not considered members of the National Baseball Hall of Fame but are permanently recognized in an exhibit at the Hall&#x27;s library.

===Chapter awards===

In July 1987, the award was renamed the Jackie Robinson Award (see , above).

<doc id="493957" wikidata="Q2159745" url="?curid=493957" title="Robin Corbett, Baron Corbett of Castle Vale">
<text>Robin Corbett, Baron Corbett of Castle Vale (22 December 1933 – 19 February 2012) was a British Labour Party politician and journalist.

Corbett sat in the House of Commons from 1974 to 1979 and then from 1983 to 2001, before being elevated to the House of Lords as a Life Peer.

==Early life==
Corbett was born at Fremantle, Western Australia, to Marguerite Adele (&quot;née&quot; Mainwaring) and Thomas William Corbett. His parents had recently moved to Australia from England. His dad, working in a foundry and being a mechanical engineer, was a fervent union supporter. His active participation in some protests led to his and his family&#x27;s deportation back to England in 1935.They resettled in West Bromwich, and Corbett attended Holly Lodge Grammar School in Smethwick, leaving at the age of sixteen. He was called up for two years&#x27; national service in the Royal Air Force in 1951. After completing his national service he became a journalist, first for the &quot;Birmingham Evening Mail&quot; and then for the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;. In 1968 he became deputy editor of &quot;Farmer&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, then worked for IPC Magazines in 1970, where he stayed until his election to parliament in 1974.

==Parliamentary career==
Corbett first stood for Parliament at Hemel Hempstead in 1966, and then in a 1967 by-election at West Derbyshire, but was unsuccessful at both attempts.

He was elected Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Hemel Hempstead at the October 1974 general election, but he lost the seat at the general election in 1979. He then returned to IPC Magazines, working as a communications consultant until he returned to parliament in the 1983 general election, representing Birmingham Erdington. He held this seat until retiring from the House of Commons at the 2001 general election, when Siôn Simon succeeded him as Labour Member of Parliament for Birmingham Erdington.

In the House of Commons, Corbett served as Opposition Spokesman for Home Affairs (1979–1992), then for National Heritage, Broadcasting and Press until 1995. He was a Labour Party Whip from 1984 until 1987, and Chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee from 1999 to 2001. His Private Member&#x27;s Bill, still law today, granted lifetime anonymity for rape victims in court and media.

==House of Lords==
Created a Life Peer as Baron Corbett of Castle Vale, &quot;of Erdington in the County of West Midlands&quot;, on 5 July 2001, his political interests included Home Office, police, civil liberties, the motor industry, manufacturing, disability, children&#x27;s rights, alternative energy, environment, agriculture, animal welfare, and the press and broadcasting. He was Chairman of the All Party Penal Affairs Group, a parliamentary organisation clerked by the Prison Reform Trust, and a Patron of the Forum on Prisoner Education and UNLOCK, The National Association of Ex-Offenders. He was chairman of the all-party British Parliamentary Committee for Iran Freedom and Chairman of Friends of Cyprus.

Lord Corbett was a vice-president of the Debating Group.

==Family==
Married to Val Hudson in 1970, they had one daughter, Polly Hudson, a columnist for the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;. Lord Corbett also had a daughter and a son from a previous marriage.

==Death==
Corbett died of lung cancer at his home in Hemel Hempstead on 19 February 2012, aged 78.

==Robin Corbett Award==
Following Lord Corbett&#x27;s death in February 2012 and his lifelong interest in prisoners &#x27;learning through doing&#x27;, his family established a lasting memorial to his work in penal reform. The Robin Corbett Award for Prisoner Rehabilitation was launched in 2013 with the Prison Reform Trust as prisoner rehabilitation legacy.

The Robin Corbett Award funds £10,000 annually to three charities who do the most for prisoner reintegration. The presentation takes place at the House of Lords. Unless ex-offenders are steered in the right direction after release, around 50% will re-offend within two years – that figure plummets to 19% when they have a job. Yet only 12% of firms employ people with criminal convictions who have served their time and need to change direction. www.robincorbettaward.co.uk

3 This led to The Corbett Network, a coalition of over 90 decision-makers of charities, social enterprises and organisations involved in reintegration working together to persuade more firms to hire returning citizens. The videos we produced - view them on the website - has the same aim. www.thecorbettnetwork.com

On 11 February 2019 the Corbett Centre for Prisoner Reintegration opened in the centre of Nottingham, operated by the charity Safer Living Foundation. The centre aims to reducing reoffending by supporting ex-prisoners to reintegrate into society.

<doc id="493960" wikidata="Q2059276" url="?curid=493960" title="Bumper pool">
<text>Bumper pool is a cue sport played on a rectangular (or sometimes octagonal) table fitted with two pockets and an array of fixed cushioned obstacles, called bumpers, within the interior of the table surface.

== Table ==

Typically, bumper pool tables are smaller than a regulation pool table. The table has two pockets, placed opposite one another, located at the center of two of the rails. The surface of the table has the same cloth covering as a standard pool table.

Two bumpers flank each pocket. The remaining bumpers are arranged in a cross in the center of the table, with one line of the cross in line with the pockets. At the center of the cross, there is an open space just large enough to allow a ball to pass through. Most tables have eight bumpers in the cross, with two comprising each arm, though additional pairs of bumpers may be included in the cross.

== Gameplay ==
The game is played with 5 red and 5 white billiard balls, with one ball in each set marked. At the start of play, each set of balls is arranged on five spots near each edge of the table by a pocket with the marked ball placed directly in front of the pocket. The object is for a player to sink all of their balls into their pocket at the opposite end of the table. The player&#x27;s marked ball must be sunk before the player can shoot any other balls. Unlike most other billiard games, there is no designated cue ball; any ball may be shot directly with the cue stick, including into a pocket, rather than the more common rule that a cue ball must be hit into the intended ball. 

To begin play, both players shoot their marked ball simultaneously, banking the ball off the cushion to their right and attempting to sink their ball in their pocket at the other end of the table. If both players sink their first shot they each select another ball, place it in front of their opponent&#x27;s pocket and repeat the simultaneous shot. If both players successfully sink all five of their balls in this fashion the game ends in a draw.

If, on the initial simultaneous shot, one player fails to sink their marked ball in the pocket, the player who successfully sank a ball or who came closest to their own pocket shoots next. A player&#x27;s turn continues until he or she fails to sink a ball.

When a player sinks all five balls in the target pocket without interruption of their sequence of play, it is referred to as a &#x27;perfect game&#x27;.

== Fouls ==
If a player sinks one of the opponent&#x27;s balls there is no penalty. However, the ball is considered sunk regardless of which pocket it drops in. If a player sinks one of their own balls (but not the last) in the wrong pocket, the opponent may drop two of their own balls into their pocket. A player sinking their last ball in the wrong pocket loses the game. If a player causes a ball to leave the table, their opponent may place that ball anywhere on the table (usually in the middle space surrounded by bumpers) and may (depending on local custom) drop two of their balls into their pocket. are not permitted in bumper pool.

<doc id="493961" wikidata="Q3048622" url="?curid=493961" title="Edward M. Kennedy Jr.">
<text>Edward Moore Kennedy Jr. (born September 26, 1961) is an American lawyer and politician. He is a partner at Epstein Becker &amp; Green, a firm headquartered in New York City, and previously represented Connecticut&#x27;s 12th State Senate district in the Connecticut State Senate from 2015 to 2019.
He is a son of United States Senate member Ted Kennedy from Massachusetts and a nephew of President John F. Kennedy and Senator Robert F. Kennedy.

==Early life and education==
Kennedy was born in the Brighton section of Boston, Massachusetts to U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy and Joan Bennett Kennedy during the presidency of his paternal uncle, John. He is the brother of Kara (19602011) and Patrick J. Kennedy (born 1967).

In 1973, when Kennedy was twelve, osteosarcoma (a form of bone cancer) was diagnosed in his right leg. The leg was surgically amputated on November 17, 1973. On that same day, his father had escorted his niece Kathleen down the aisle at her wedding and rushed back to the hospital. A made-for-TV movie, &quot;The Ted Kennedy Jr. Story&quot; (1986), concentrated on this event in young Kennedy&#x27;s life.

In 1982, his mother, Joan, revealed that Kennedy missed being aboard Air Florida Flight 90 by just ten minutes, which crashed into the Potomac River on January 13 of that year, killing 74 people. Kennedy was delayed on the drive to the airport and missed the flight.

Kennedy graduated from the private St. Albans School, in Washington, D.C. After completing a Bachelor of Arts degree at Wesleyan University in 1984, he continued his studies at Yale University, earning a master&#x27;s degree from the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. He then attended the University of Connecticut School of Law at night, earning a Juris Doctor degree. On May 19, 2013, Kennedy received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of New Haven.

==Career==
After graduation he worked at the New Haven law firm Wiggin &amp; Dana specializing in disability issues. He later co-founded and served as president of the Marwood Group, a firm that advises corporations about health care and financial services. He left the Marwood Group in 2014 to join the law firm of Epstein Becker &amp; Green where he advises health care providers, commercial insurers, and life science companies on critical issues related to health care reform policies.

Kennedy is the Chairman of the board of directors of the American Association of People with Disabilities.

==Political career==
On April 8, 2014, Kennedy announced his candidacy for a seat in the Connecticut State Senate representing the state&#x27;s 12th district. He was elected on November 4. He was re-elected on November 8, 2016. In both election cycles, Kennedy defeated Bruce Wilson Jr.

On June 26, 2017, Kennedy announced that he would not run for Governor of Connecticut in 2018. On February 28, 2018, Kennedy announced he would not seek re-election to the State Senate. On November 6, 2018, Democrat Christine Cohen won the general election to replace Kennedy after defeating Republican Adam Greenberg. She was sworn in on January 9, 2019.

===State Senate===
Kennedy was first sworn in to serve in the Connecticut State Senate on January 7, 2015.

==Personal life==

On October 10, 1993, Kennedy married Katherine Anne &quot;Kiki&quot; Gershman (born 1959) on Block Island, Rhode Island.

<doc id="493963" wikidata="Q1413670" url="?curid=493963" title="False cleanerfish">
<text>The false cleanerfish (Aspidontus taeniatus) is a species of combtooth blenny, a mimic that copies both the dance and appearance of &quot;Labroides dimidiatus&quot; (the bluestreak cleaner wrasse), a similarly colored species of cleaner wrasse. It likely mimics that species to avoid predation, as well as to occasionally bite the fins of its victims rather than consume parasites. Most veiled attacks occur on juvenile fish, as adults that have been attacked in the past may avoid or even attack &quot;A. taeniatus.&quot;

It is indigenous to coral reef habitats in the Indo-Pacific.

==Mimicry==
===Appearance===
The false cleanerfish primarily lives in coral reef margins among the cleaning stations of the bluestreak cleaner wrasse (&quot;Labroides dimidiatus&quot;), and are usually seen near locations of one or more &quot;L. dimidiatus.&quot; With its territory primarily overlapping with its model fish, the false cleanerfish mimics both the appearance and occasionally the behavior of said fish. Though &quot;A. taeniatus&quot; is typically known to exhibit the characteristic black stripe and blue body and general body shape and structure of &quot;L. dimidiatus&quot;, some individuals have been witnessed to mimic the appearance of other reef fish, as well as atypically colored cleaner wrasses that live in the same territory.

Juvenile &quot;A. taeniatus&quot; fish match the appearance of juvenile &quot;L. dimidiatus&quot; (black body, blue dorsal stripe), and continue to match the coloration of cleaner wrasses of the same size throughout growth. It is not known whether the false cleanerfish adopts a permanent color pattern or if it alters its coloration to mimic the appearance of neighboring cleaner wrasses.

One major difference in appearance between the false cleanerfish and its model is the location of the mouth. &quot;A. taeniatus&quot; has an underslung mouth, whereas &quot;L. dimidiatus&quot; has its mouth in the terminal position. Additionally, the false cleanerfish has a small set of teeth on the upper mandible, as well as enormous canines that protrude from its lower jaw and fit into sockets laterally on the roof of its mouth.

===Cheating behaviour===
The false cleanerfish has been observed to mimic the unusual &quot;dance&quot; of the bluestreak cleaner wrasse by spreading its caudal fin and oscillating its posterior end up and down. By doing so, the false cleanerfish elicits the same posing behavior in client fish, similarly to &quot;L. dimidiatus&quot;. Occasionally, however, rather than feeding on ectoparasites like the cleaner wrasse, the false cleanerfish will attack and attempt (and sometimes succeed) at tearing away portions of fin from the client fish. This typically occurs and is most successful with juvenile client fish, as adults have been evidenced to avoid or even indiscriminately attack cleanerfish, suggesting adult client fish remember being attacked. Also, evidence indicates adult fish are able to distinguish between &quot;L. dimidiatus&quot; and &quot;A. taeniatus&quot;, and thus avoid it altogether.

===Evolutionary basis===
Though &quot;A. taeniatus&quot; mimics &quot;L. dimidiatus&quot; in color, morphology, and mode of swimming, the false cleanerfish cheats much less often than initially reported. The stomach contents of &quot;A. taeniatus&quot; consist primarily of the demersal eggs of fishes and the tentacles of tube worms, with a relatively small portion of fish fins, or ectoparasites—the primary stomach contents of &quot;L. dimidiatus&quot;. Additionally, close observation of &quot;A. taeniatus&quot; has shown them to only attack posing clients at a rate of about 20%.

The primary reason for the false cleanerfish&#x27;s mimicry is suggested to be not to cheat and feed on the flesh of client fish, but to avoid predation by those fish that do not prey on &quot;L. dimidiatus&quot;. Aggressive mimicry typically results in the complete consumption of prey by a mimic predator (such as anglerfish), or partial consumption of prey by an unattractive mimic. In both cases, the host fish can rarely or never learn the disguise of the mimic; the fact that &quot;A. taeniatus&quot; can be easily identified by client fish helps to dispel the notion that it is primarily an aggressive mimic. Groupers raised in captivity do not attack &quot;L. dimidiatus&quot;, while they do consume all other noncleanerfish on sight. Furthermore, false cleanerfish inflict a higher cost on their models and cleaning stations when cheating, as client fish are more likely to behave aggressively or avoid cleaning stations altogether if they are consistently attacked.

However, there is evidence of geographical variation on the benefits obtained by the mimicry: whereas in the Red Sea and the Great Barrier Reef foraging on tube worms or substrate was more common than attacks by mimics, in French Polynesia and Indonesia false cleanerfish (especially juveniles) fed on client fish tissue more commonly than other food sources. An alternate reason for the mimicry behavior of &quot;A. taeniatus&quot; is to deceive egg-caring fishes so to more easily gain access to their eggs; however, little evidence favors this possibility.

The evolution of &quot;A. taeniatus&quot; to mimic &quot;L. dimidiatus&quot; has been used as evidence for the strong selection of client fish that do not attack their cleaners, or cheat and consume their cleaners after cleaning. Furthermore, the behavior of &quot;A. taeniatus&quot; mimicking &quot;L. dimidiatus&quot; in a largely nonaggressive way supports the hypothesis of the evolution of reciprocally altruistic behavior.

<doc id="493965" wikidata="Q31836365" url="?curid=493965" title="Panamanian white-faced capuchin">
<text>The Panamanian white-faced capuchin (Cebus imitator), also known as the Panamanian white-headed capuchin or Central American white-faced capuchin, is a medium-sized New World monkey of the family Cebidae, subfamily Cebinae. Native to the forests of Central America, the white-faced capuchin is important to rainforest ecology for its role in dispersing seeds and pollen.

Among the best known monkeys, the Panamanian white-faced capuchin is recognized as the typical companion to the organ grinder. In recent years the species has become popular in American media, particularly in the &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; film series. It is a highly intelligent monkey and has been trained to assist paraplegic persons. It is a medium-sized monkey, weighing up to . It is mostly black, but with a pink face and white on much of the front part of the body, giving it its common name. It has a distinctive prehensile tail that is often carried coiled up and is used to help support the monkey when it is feeding beneath a branch.

In the wild, the Panamanian white-faced capuchin is versatile, living in many different types of forest, and eating many different types of food, including fruit, other plant material, invertebrates, and small vertebrates. It lives in troops that can exceed 20 animals and include both males and females. It is noted for its tool use, including rubbing plants over its body in an apparent use of herbal medicine, and also using tools as weapons and for getting to food. It is a long-lived monkey, with a maximum recorded age of over 54 years.

Panamanian white-faced capuchins are highly social, living in groups of 16 individuals on average, about three quarters of which are females. Groups consists of related females, immigrant males, and offspring. On average, females birth offspring every 27 months even though they mate throughout the year. Females tend to stay within their original group while males leave their natal group when they are 4 years old and change groups every 4 years after. Both male and female capuchins exhibit different dominance behaviors within the group.

== Taxonomy ==
The Panamanian white-faced capuchin is a member of the family Cebidae, the family of New World monkeys containing capuchin monkeys and squirrel monkeys. Until the 21st century the Panamanian white-faced capuchin was considered conspecific with &quot;Cebus capucinus&quot;, the Colombian white-faced capuchin, but as a separate subspecies &quot;C. capucinus imitator&quot;. Some primatologists continue to consider the Panamanian and Colombian white-faced capuchins as a single species. It is a member of the &quot;C. capucinus&quot; species group within the genus &quot;Cebus&quot; which also includes the Colombian white-faced capuchin, white-fronted capuchin, the weeper capuchin and the Kaapori capuchin. This genus is also referred to as &quot;gracile&quot; capuchins.

In 2012 a study by Boubli, &quot;et al.&quot; demonstrated that &quot;C. imitator&quot; and &quot;C. capucinus&quot; split up to 2 million years ago. Boubli&#x27;s study also indicated that the Honduran white-faced capuchins, which had previously been considered a to be a possible separate subspecies, &quot;C. capucinus limitaneus&quot;, was not genetically distinct from the Panamanian white-faced capuchin.

The Panamanian white-faced capuchin is the most well-studied capuchin monkey species. Even though many previous studies were performed using the scientific name &quot;C. capucinus&quot;, as of 2014 there had been no field studies of the Colombian white-faced capuchin, so all these studies were of the Panamanian white-faced capuchin.

== Physical description ==
Like other monkeys in the genus &quot;Cebus&quot;, the Panamanian white-faced capuchin is named after the order of Capuchin friars – the cowls of these friars closely resemble the monkey&#x27;s head coloration. The Panamanian white-faced capuchin has mostly black fur, with white to yellow like fur on the neck, throat, chest, shoulders, and upper arms. The face is pink or a white-cream color and may have identifying marks such as dark brows or dark fur patches. An area of black fur on the crown of the head is distinctive. It has a prehensile tail that is often held coiled, giving the white-faced capuchins the nickname &quot;ringtail&quot;.

Adults reach a length of between , excluding tail, and a weight of up to . The tail is longer than the body, at up to in length. Males are about 27% larger than females. The brain of a white-faced capuchin is about , which is larger than that of several larger monkey species, such as the mantled howler.

The Panamanian white-faced capuchin is similar to the Colombian white-faced capuchin in appearance, except that the female Panamanian white-faced capuchins have brownish or grayish elongated frontal tufts, which provide a contrast to the pure white cheeks and throat.

== Behavior ==

=== Social structure ===

The Panamanian white-faced capuchin is a diurnal and arboreal animal. However, it does come down to the ground more often than many other New World monkeys. It moves primarily by walking on all four limbs. It
lives in troops, or groups, of up to 40 monkeys (mean 16, range 4–40) and has a male/female adult sex ratio of 0.71 on average (range 0.54–0.88). With rare exceptions, females spend their entire lives with their female kin. Males migrate to new social groups multiple times during the course of their lifetimes, migrating for the first time between 20 months and 11 years of age. The median age of migration in the Santa Rosa population is 4.5 years. Males sometimes migrate alone, but more often they migrate in the company of other males who are often their kin. One of the unusual features of the kinship structure of the Panamanian white-faced capuchin, relative to other primate species, is the high degree of relatedness within groups that results from the long tenures of alpha males who sire most of the offspring. Alpha males have been known to keep their positions as long as 17 years in this species and this puts them in the unusual position of being available to sire the offspring of their daughters and granddaughters, who produce their first offspring at about 6–7 years of age. Typically, however, alpha males do not breed with their own daughters, even though they do sire virtually all offspring produced by females unrelated to them. Those subordinate males who are allies of the alpha male in group defense are the males who sire the offspring of the alpha male&#x27;s daughters. The high degree to which alpha males monopolize matings results in an unusually large number of paternal half-siblings and full siblings in this species relative to other primate species.

Kinship is an important organizing factor in the structuring of female-female social relationships. Particularly in larger groups, females preferentially associate with, groom, and provide coalitionary support to their matrilineally related female kin. They do not exhibit a similar preference for their paternal half sisters, which may mean that they only are capable of recognizing kinship through the maternal line. Dominance rank is also an important organizing factor, with females more often grooming and associating with females who are closer to them in the dominance hierarchy. Female-female dyads groom far more than male-female and male-male dyads. Coalitionary aggression is common both among males and females, and capuchins seem to have an excellent understanding of the alliance structure in their group. For example, when capuchins are fighting, they sensibly recruit aid from someone who is both higher ranking than they are and also better friends with themselves than with their opponent.

Female capuchins have linear dominance hierarchies. In contrast to many Old World monkeys such as macaques, in which females socially inherit the rank just below their mothers and just above their next oldest sisters, capuchins do not have a highly predictable ranking within their matrilines. Males are typically dominant to females. The alpha male is always easy to discern, but there are sometimes ambiguous rankings among subordinate males. Male-male relationships are tense, and affiliation between males is typically expressed by resting in contact, playing, or non-conceptive sex rather than by grooming. Males cooperate in coalitions against potential predators, and also in defense of the group against other males. Occasionally male coalitionary aggression becomes so violent that males are killed, particularly if they are encountered roaming the forest unaccompanied by allies. Because aggression from other male capuchins is the leading cause of death (aside from poaching by humans, where there is contact between humans and capuchins), male allies are critical for self-defense during migration, and to assist in taking over other groups. Male emigration to a new troop typically occurs about every 4 years, so most males are in constant danger of having to defend themselves against other groups of males.

Immigrating males often kill young infants when they take over a group. Females band together to defend their infants from infanticidal males, but they rarely succeed in saving their infants. Because infants inhibit their mothers from ovulating by nursing frequently, males are able to bring females into estrus earlier by killing the infants and thereby terminating nursing; this has the effect of increasing their breeding opportunities. Females do often mate with the killers of their infants, and with time, they typically become as supportive of the new alpha male as they had been of the previous one. The alpha male helps defend females from subordinate males within the group as well as from infanticidal males from other groups.

=== Interactions between groups ===

Panamanian white-faced capuchin troops occupy home ranges of between . They travel between daily, averaging per day. Although they engage in activity that has been described as &quot;territorial&quot;, more recent research indicates that white-faced capuchin troops tend to behave aggressively to other white-faced capuchin troops regardless of where they meet, and the aggression is not necessarily intended to exclude the other troops from a specific home range.

Home ranges overlap extensively, so groups are not territorial in the strictest sense of the word. Perhaps because of the intensity of male-male competition and the threat of infanticide, interactions between groups are typically hostile: the males display aggressively toward one another and sometimes engage in physical aggression (even killing an opponent), while females grab their infants and run. Typically, males are the primary participants in aggressive intergroup encounters, and it seems likely that males are defending access to the females in their groups. Alpha males, who have the largest reproductive stake in the group, participate at a higher rate than subordinate males. Groups with more males have an advantage over groups with fewer males, but the location of the encounter within the home range matters as well; smaller groups defeat larger groups when the contest occurs in the core or center area of the smaller group&#x27;s home range.

=== Interspecific interactions ===

The Panamanian white-faced capuchin sometimes interacts with other sympatric monkey species. Panamanian white-faced capuchins sometimes travel with and even groom Geoffroy&#x27;s spider monkeys. However, aggressive interactions between the capuchins and spider monkeys also occur. Interactions between the Panamanian white-faced capuchin and mantled howler are infrequent, and sometimes result in the capuchins threatening the larger howlers. However, affiliative associations between the capuchins and howlers do sometimes occur, mostly involving juveniles playing together.

Although South American capuchin species often travel with and feed together with squirrel monkeys, the Panamanian white-faced capuchin only rarely associates with the Central American squirrel monkey. This appears to be related to the patchier, more dispersed distribution of food resources in Central America and the fact that there is less dietary overlap between the Central American squirrel monkey and the white-faced capuchin than between their South American counterparts. Therefore, there is less benefit to the Central American squirrel monkey in associating with the Panamanian white-faced capuchin in order to exploit the capuchin&#x27;s knowledge of food resource distribution. In addition, compared to their South American counterparts, male Panamanian white-headed capuchins are relatively more alert to rival males than to predators, reducing the predator detection benefits that the Central American squirrel monkey receives from associating with the Panamanian white-faced capuchin compared to its South American counterparts. Since the squirrel monkeys generally initiate interactions with the capuchins in South America, the fact that similar associations would impose higher foraging costs and impart fewer predator detection benefits to the Central American squirrel monkey leads to fewer associations with the Panamanian white-faced capuchin.

Several non-primate animal species tend to follow troops of white-faced monkeys or are otherwise attracted by their presence. white-lipped peccaries and agoutis are attracted by feeding white-faced capuchins, looking for fruit that the capuchins drop. Several species of bird are also known to follow Panmanian white-faced capuchins looking for food. These include the double-toothed kite, the white hawk and the sharp-shinned hawk.

=== Diet ===
The Panamanian white-faced capuchin is an omnivore. Its primary foods are fruit and insects. It forages at all levels of the forest, including the ground. Methods for finding food include stripping bark off of trees, searching through leaf litter, breaking dead tree branches, rolling over rocks, and using stones as anvils to crack hard fruits. Its prehensile tail assists with feeding, helping support the monkey when foraging for food below the branches.

Fruit can make up between 50% and 67% or more of the capuchin&#x27;s diet. In one study in Panama, white-faced capuchins ate 95 different fruit species. Among its favorite fruits are figs from the family Moraceae, mangos and related fruits from the family Anacardiaceae, the bean-like fruits from the family Leguminosae and fruits from the family Rubiaceae. It will also eat fruits from Euphorbiaceae such as Mexican jumping bean &quot;Sebastiania pavoniana&quot;. It generally only eats ripe fruit, testing for ripeness by smelling, tasting and prodding the fruit. It typically eats only the pulp and juice, spitting out the seeds and fibers. Other plant matter eaten includes flowers, young leaves, seeds of certain plants, and bromeliads. It also uses the bromelids as a water source, drinking the water that gets trapped inside. In Carara National Park the capuchins have a varied diet in addition to the above of banana fruits and flowers, heliconia seeds, huevos de caballo fruits and anacardiaceae stems.

Insect prey eaten includes beetle larvae, butterfly and moth caterpillars, ants, wasps, and ant and wasp larvae. It also eats larger prey, such as birds, bird eggs, frogs, lizards, crabs, mollusks and small mammals. The population in Guanacaste, Costa Rica in particular is noted for hunting squirrels, magpies, white-crowned parrots and baby coatis. The amount of vertebrate prey eaten varies by troop. Even neighboring troops can show significant differences in their diets.

The diet can vary between the rainy and dry season. For example, in Guanacaste, Costa Rica the Panamanian white-faced capuchin can eat a wide variety of fruits as well as caterpillars in the early rainy season (June to November). But during the dry season, only figs and a few other types of fruit are available. During the dry season, chitinous insects, ant and wasp larvae and vertebrates become a particularly important part of the Panamanian white-faced capuchin&#x27;s diet. Access to water can also become an issue during the dry season. The Panamanian white-faced capuchin likes to drink daily, so in forests where water holes dry up during the dry season, there can be competition between troops over access to the remaining water holes.

=== Tool use ===

Capuchins are considered among the most intelligent of the New World monkeys; they have been the subject of many studies on behaviour and intelligence. The capuchins&#x27; intelligence is thought to be an adaptation to support their feeding habits; they rely on ephemeral food sources which may be hard to find. In one particular study conducted in 2007, capuchins were found to be among the ten most intelligent primates, second to spider monkeys among New World monkeys.

The use of stone tools is a marked difference between the gracile capuchins of the genus &quot;Cebus&quot; and the robust capuchins of the genus &quot;Sapajus&quot;. Although widespread in robust capuchins, only one case of habitual stone tool use has been reported by gracile capuchins. One population of Panamanian white-faced capuchins found in Coiba National Park in Panama has been observed using hammerstones and anvils to process fruits from &quot;Terminalia catappa, Bactris major&quot;, and &quot;Cocos nucifera&quot; (coconuts) and invertebrates such as nerite snails, hermit crabs, and Halloween crabs.
The Panamanian white-faced capuchin is known to rub parts of certain plants into their hair. Plants used in this manner include citrus fruits, vines of the genera &quot;Piper&quot; and &quot;Clematis&quot;, monkey comb (genus &quot;Sloanea&quot;), dumb cane and custard apple. Ants and millipedes are also used in this way. It is not definitively known what this rubbing is for, but this may deter parasites such as ticks and insects, or it may serve as a fungicide or bactericide or anti-inflammatory agent. Alternatively, it may be a form of scent marking. The Panamanian white-faced capuchin also uses tools in other ways. It has been known to beat snakes with sticks in order to protect itself or to get the snake to release an infant, and it sometimes uses sticks as probes to explore openings. In captivity, it has been known to use tools to get to food or to defend itself, and in one case a white-faced capuchin used a squirrel monkey as a projectile, hurling it at a human observer.

The Panamanian white-faced capuchin&#x27;s intelligence and ability to use tools allows them to be trained to assist paraplegics. Other species of capuchin monkeys are also trained in this manner. Panamanian white-faced capuchins can also be trained for roles on television and movies, such as Marcel on the television series &quot;Friends&quot;. They were also traditionally used as organ grinder monkeys.

=== Communication ===
The Panamanian white-faced capuchin is noisy. Loud calls, such as barks and coughs, are used to communicate threat warnings, and softer calls, such as squeals, are used in intimate discourse. Different types of threats, such as a threat from a terrestrial animal versus a threat from a bird, invoke different vocalizations. Facial expressions and scent are also important to communication. It sometimes engages in a practice known as &quot;urine washing&quot;, in which the monkey rubs urine on its feet. The exact purpose of this practice is unknown, but it may be a form of olfactory signal.

== Reproduction ==

The Panamanian white-faced capuchin uses a polygamous mating system in which a male may mate with multiple females. Although the dominant male does not monopolize breeding, studies have shown that the dominant male does tend to father most of the young. Although a female may mate with several males, the dominant male may be more likely to copulate when the female is at peak fertility. Nonetheless, there is evidence that dominant males do tend to avoid breeding with their own daughters who are members of the troop. Such avoidance is rare among New World primates.

Copulation takes about 2 minutes, and the gestation period is 5 to 6 months. Usually a single young is born, but twins occur occasionally. Most births occur during the dry season from December to April. The infant is carried across its mother&#x27;s back for about 6 weeks. After about 4 to 5 weeks it can stray from its mother for brief periods and by about 3 months it can move around independently, although some infants will be mostly independent earlier. Weaning occurs between 6 and 12 months. While the mother rests, the young spends most of its time foraging or playing, either on its own or with other juveniles. Capuchins engage in high levels of alloparenting, in which monkeys other than the mother help care for the infant. Infants are carried by alloparents most often between 4 and 6 weeks in age. Males as well as females engage in alloparenting.

Like other capuchin species, the Panamanian white-faced capuchin matures slowly. Sexual maturity can be reached at 3 years. But on average, females give birth for the first time at 7 years old and give birth every 26 months thereafter. Males attain reproductive maturity at 10 years old. The Panamanian white-faced capuchin has a long life span given its size. The maximum recorded life span in captivity is over 54 years.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The Panamanian white-faced capuchin is found in much of Central America. In Central America, its range includes much of Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama. It has also been reported to occur in eastern Guatemala and southern Belize, but these reports are unconfirmed. It is among the most commonly seen monkeys in Central America&#x27;s national parks, such as Manuel Antonio National Park, Corcovado National Park, Santa Rosa National Park and Soberania National Park. It appears on the reverse side of the Costa Rican 5,000 colón note.

While the white-faced capuchin is very common in Costa Rica and Panama, the monkey has been largely extirpated from Honduras and much of Nicaragua. Many Honduran capuchins were captured and relocated to the island of Roatán, and many Nicaraguan capuchins were captured and relocated to the island of Ometepe. In Nicaragua, wild capuchins may still be easily spotted in regions around Masaya, as well as around Bluefields and other locations around the South Caribbean coast. They are seen, in the wild, daily by visitors who climb one of the volcanoes on Ometepe Island.

It is found in many different types of forest, including mature and secondary forests, and including evergreen and deciduous forests, dry and moist forests, and mangrove and montane forests. However, it appears to prefer primary or advanced secondary forests. Also, higher densities of white-faced capuchins are found in older areas of forest and in areas containing evergreen forest, as well as areas with more water availability during the dry season.

== Conservation status ==

The Panamanian white-faced capuchin is regarded as vulnerable from a conservation standpoint by IUCN. It is threatened by deforestation, hunting for pet trade and sometimes for bushmeat and by the fact that farmers sometimes attack them as potential threats. However, deforestation may also impact its main predator, the harpy eagle, more than it directly impacts the Panamanian white-faced capuchin, and so on a net basis deforestation may not be as harmful to the capuchin&#x27;s status. The Panamanian white-faced capuchin can adapt to forest fragmentation better than other species due to its ability to live in a wide variety of forest types and exploit a wide variety of food sources. The Panamanian white-faced capuchin is important to its ecosystems as a seed and pollen disperser. It also impacts the ecosystem by eating insects that act as pests to certain trees, by pruning certain trees, such as &quot;Gustavia superba&quot; and &quot;Bursera simaruba&quot;, causing them to generate more branches and possibly additional fruit, and by accelerating germination of certain seeds when they pass through the capuchin&#x27;s digestive tract. In addition, the Panamanian white-faced capuchin sometimes kills &quot;Acacia collinsii&quot; plants when it rips through the plant&#x27;s branches to get to resident ant colonies.

<text>Jeffrey William Rooker, Baron Rooker (born 5 June 1941) is a British politician and life peer who served as a government minister from 1997 to 2008. A member of the Labour Party, he was Member of Parliament (MP) for Birmingham Perry Barr from 1974 to 2001.

Raised and educated in Birmingham, Rooker worked as a production engineer in the city before lecturing in the subject at Lanchester Polytechnic. He studied at Aston University and the University of Warwick; and he eventually gained a postgraduate degree in industrial relations. After unsuccessfully attempting to be elected to Birmingham City Council in 1966, he was elected to the House of Commons at the February 1974 general election and joined the government after the Labour victory at the 1997 general election as Minister of State at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.

Rooker did not seek re-election as an MP at the 2001 general election and was immediately created a life peer where he continued to serve in the government under several ministerial portfolios until 2008, including as Deputy Leader of the House of Lords and Minister of State for Sustainable Food, Farming and Animal Health from 2005 to 2008. He resigned the Labour whip in 2009 after being appointed chair of the Food Standards Agency. He sat as an independent member in the House of Lords until 2013 when, standing down as chair of the FSA, he took up the Labour whip once again.

==Early life and career==
The son of a factory worker, Jeff Rooker attended Aldridge Road Secondary Modern Boys School, Aldridge Road, Great Barr. He later attended Handsworth Technical School and College, Goldshill Road, Handsworth. He initially trained as a production engineer, working in various factories in and around Birmingham for 14 years and then became a lecturer on the subject at Lanchester Polytechnic.

Rooker graduated with an undergraduate degree from Aston University in the city of Birmingham and he served as editor of the Birmingham &quot;Student Union News&quot; (SUN) from 1963 to 1964. He later received a postgraduate degree from the University of Warwick in industrial relations. In 1966, he was an unsuccessful candidate for membership of Birmingham City Council.

== Early parliamentary career ==
Rooker was selected as the prospective parliamentary candidate in October 1971 for his home constituency of Birmingham Perry Barr, which he won in the February 1974 general election.

Rooker achieved a measure of national prominence in June 1977 while still a backbencher. With fellow MP Audrey Wise, he introduced the so-called &quot;Rooker–Wise Amendment&quot; to the Budget. This linked personal tax allowances to the rate of inflation, thereby preventing the erosion of non-taxable income. The BBC has described the amendment as &quot;a rare example of direct backbench influence on the Budget&quot;.

Beginning in 1998, Rooker led an unsuccessful attempt to prosecute World War II German general Wilhelm Mohnke for his alleged role in war crimes inflicted on British troops at Wormhoudt in 1940.

== Ministerial career ==

After Tony Blair led Labour to power in the 1997 general election, Rooker served as Minister of State for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. In July 1999, he was moved to the Department of Social Security where he served as Minister of State for Pensions. He was made a Privy Counsellor in 1999.

Rooker did not seek re-election as an MP at the 2001 general election and was created a life peer on 16 June 2001 with the title Baron Rooker, &quot;of Perry Barr in the County of West Midlands&quot;. As a member of the House of Lords, he was re-appointed to the government as the Minister of State for Asylum and Immigration and remained in the post for a year. He then was moved to the Department for Communities and Local Government, where he served as Minister of State for Housing and Planning, then subsequently Minister of State for Regeneration and Regional Development.

Following the 2005 general election, Rooker was named the Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office, with responsibility for children in Northern Ireland.

On 6 May 2006, Rooker was appointed Minister of State for Sustainable Food, Farming and Animal Health at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. He was a controversial choice as minister responsible for animal welfare due to his well-known pro-hunting views. In 2007, following Rooker&#x27;s appointment, numerous complaints from animal welfare campaigners were sent to the Labour Party. He later also became deputy leader of the House of Lords. He retained both these roles when Gordon Brown became Labour leader and Prime Minister in 2007 and showed himself to be outspokenly in favour of genetically modified (GM) foods at the September 2008 Labour Party Conference, when he accused people opposed to GM foods of &quot;ignorance&quot;. Rooker&#x27;s ministerial appointed ended at a reshuffle in October 2008.

== Later career ==
Rooker is a vice president of The Birmingham Civic Society. As of January 2008, he is a lay governor of Aston University. In July 2009, he was appointed as chair of the Food Standards Agency and resigned the Labour party whip for the duration until he ceased to be chair in 2013.

In December 2015, Rooker called for Jeremy Corbyn to be removed as Labour Party leader before 2020.

Rooker is a member of Labour Friends of Israel.

==Personal life==
Rooker married Angela Edwards in 1972 in Paddington, London. He was widowed in January 2003. He married second wife Helen Hughes on 5 February 2010 in a private ceremony in Christchurch, New Zealand. In 2001, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Aston University of which he is an alumnus.

<doc id="493980" wikidata="Q333882" url="?curid=493980" title="Richard Livsey, Baron Livsey of Talgarth">
<text>Richard Arthur Lloyd Livsey, Baron Livsey of Talgarth (2 May 1935 – 16 September 2010) was a British Liberal Democrat politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Brecon and Radnorshire from 1985 to 1992, and again from 1997 to 2001.

==Family and education==

He was the son of Arthur Norman Livsey and Lilian Maisie (née James). His father was a seacaptain who died in Iraq when Richard was just three years old. He was therefore brought up in a single parent household by his mother, Lilian, who was a local teacher and headmistress. It was she who had a great influence in his life.

Baron Livsey was educated at Talgarth County Primary, Bedales School, Seale-Hayne Agricultural College and Reading University (MSc in agricultural management).

On 3 April 1964 he married Irene Earsman of Castle Douglas, Galloway, Scotland, and they went on to have two sons and one daughter.

==Employment history==

Livsey was an agricultural development officer for ICI from 1961 to 1967. He then went on to become the farm manager on the Blairdrummond Estate in Perthshire from 1967 to 1971. He then returned to Wales as a senior lecturer at the Welsh Agricultural College, Llanbadarn Fawr until 1985. He had one further spell in employment outside of Westminster politics when he lost office in 1992, as the Development Manager of ATB-Landbase Cymru from 1993 to 1997.

==Political career==

Livsey joined the Liberal Party in Wales in 1960. In 1970 he stood unsuccessfully as the party&#x27;s Scottish candidate in Perth and East Perthshire. When he returned to Wales he became active in the Welsh Liberal Party and stood unsuccessfully for Pembroke in 1979 and Brecon and Radnor in 1983. Livsey had been a keen supporter and activist during the 1979 St David&#x27;s Day referendum on a Welsh Assembly on behalf of the Yes Campaign. He continued to be central to the pro devolution cause and was the leader of the Liberal Democrat campaign in the successful 1997 Welsh devolution referendum.

Livsey won his home constituency at the second attempt at the 1985 Brecon and Radnor by-election (it subsequently became Brecon and Radnorshire), as a Liberal, with a majority of 559. The by-election was one of the most notable successes of the SDP-Liberal Alliance period. It was the only Welsh Liberal parliamentary gain in Wales. 

With a background as a farm manager and lecturer in farm management, he joined Parliament&#x27;s Select Committee on Agriculture. Livsey joined a group of three Welsh Liberal MPs (the others being his friend and mentor Geraint Howells, and Alex Carlile). He held the same seat in the 1987 general election, subsequently becoming the Liberal Democrat spokesman on Wales, and held the position of Leader of the Party in Wales from 1988 to 1992. He was also a member of the Welsh Affairs Select Committee. 

He lost the Brecon &amp; Radnorshire seat at the 1992 United Kingdom general election by the narrow margin of 130 votes, but regained it again at the 1997 United Kingdom general election, with a majority of over 5,000. He then became leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats until he stood down in 2001. In that same year he was ennobled as Baron Livsey of Talgarth. As well as being a central figure in Welsh Liberal politics in the post war era Baron Livsey&#x27;s main success was to build Brecon and Radnor into a Liberal Democrat stronghold which enabled Kirsty Williams (Assembly Member) and his successor Roger Williams to further strengthen the Liberal Democrat hold there.

Livsey was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1994 Birthday Honours.

==Involvement with the community==

Livsey was an extremely active as a constituency MP and remained involved with the community, afterwards. He was patron of and active in many of the organisations in Brecon and Radnor. These included a role as President of the Hay Festival, chairman of the Brecon Jazz Festival and a member of the Talgarth Male Choir. He sang with them at their appearance at the Royal Albert Hall in 2009.

He was succeeded by Roger Williams at the 2001 United Kingdom general election and was created a life peer on 28 August 2001 with the title Baron Livsey of Talgarth of Talgarth in the County of Powys.

He became a fellow of Aberystwyth University in 2007.

<doc id="493988" wikidata="Q2410775" url="?curid=493988" title="Orel Hershiser">
<text>Orel Leonard Hershiser IV (born September 16, 1958) is an American former baseball pitcher who played 18 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1983 to 2000. He later became a pitching coach for the Texas Rangers from 2002 to 2005 and a broadcast color analyst for the Dodgers. He is also a professional poker player.

After playing baseball in high school at Cherry Hill High School East and at Bowling Green State University, Hershiser was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1979. After several years in the minor leagues, he made his major league debut with the Dodgers in 1983. During his tenure with the team, Hershiser was a three-time All-Star, finishing in the top five in Cy Young voting four times in his first six full seasons. Hershiser&#x27;s most successful season came in 1988, when he set a major league record by pitching 59 consecutive innings without allowing a run. He helped lead the Dodgers to a championship in the 1988 World Series, and was named the National League (NL) Championship Series Most Valuable Player (MVP) and the World Series MVP. That season, he won the NL Cy Young Award and an NL Gold Glove Award. He later pitched in two more World Series and earned the American League Championship Series MVP Award. After 12 seasons with the Dodgers, Hershiser spent time with the Cleveland Indians, San Francisco Giants, and New York Mets before returning to Los Angeles for his final season. After retirement as a player, he briefly worked as a coach and team executive for the Texas Rangers before serving as a color analyst for ESPN and then the Dodgers.

Known for his slight frame and fierce competitive spirit, Hershiser was nicknamed &quot;Bulldog&quot; by former Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda, who managed Hershiser during his time with the Dodgers.

==Early life==
Hershiser was born in Buffalo, New York, to Orel Leonard III and Mildred Hershiser. The family moved to Detroit, Michigan, when he was six and to Toronto, Ontario, when he was 12. At age eight, Hershiser was the third-place finisher in a national hit, run, and throw competition. Hershiser played in Little League Baseball until he was 12. His father was a coach and league administrator and his mother ran the snackbar. During his family&#x27;s time in Canada, he participated in ice hockey with the Don Mills Flyers in the Greater Toronto Hockey League.

His family moved again and he attended Cherry Hill High School East in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. He did not make the varsity team until his junior year as he spent his first year on the freshman team and his second year on the junior varsity. He set the single-game strikeout record for his high school in 1976 when he retired 15 batters in a game against Deptford, a record that stood for 21 years. He also remains on the school&#x27;s leaderboards in career winning percentage, strikeouts and earned run average (ERA). He was an all-conference selection his senior year.

Hershiser received only a partial scholarship from Bowling Green State University. As a freshman he played little baseball and was academically ineligible as a sophomore. He left school and hitchhiked home, where his parents convinced him to return to school. He enrolled in summer school to bring his grades up and worked at his father&#x27;s paper company during the summer. He grew and gained that summer, which added to his fastball and got him more playing time. He made the all-Mid-American Conference All-Star team his junior year, during which he pitched a no-hitter against Kent State on May 4, 1979. He won that game 2–0 despite only striking out two batters. In his only full-time season with the baseball team, in 1979, he was 6–2 with a 2.26 ERA.

Hershiser was also a member of the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity. One of his fraternity brothers played a joke on him on draft day, pretending to be a scout from the San Diego Padres calling to tell him he was drafted in the first round. After getting excited and starting to call his friends, he realized it was a hoax.

==Professional career==

===Minor league career===
The Los Angeles Dodgers selected Hershiser in the 17th round of the 1979 Major League Baseball draft. The original scouting report on him for the draft said that he had poor control, a weak fastball, and threw the curveball incorrectly. It went on to state that he rattled easily and had questionable makeup.

The Dodgers assigned him to their Class A farm team in the Midwest League, the Clinton Dodgers. He started four games for Clinton in 1979, and appeared in 11 more out of the bullpen to finish with a 4–0 record with a 2.09 ERA.

Hershiser spent the next two seasons in AA with the San Antonio Dodgers of the Texas League. He worked primarily as a reliever at San Antonio. He was leading the league in saves at one point but then gave up 20 runs in seven innings on a road trip. He called this point the lowest of his career. He wanted to quit but the manager and pitching coach talked him out of it.

Hershiser was promoted to the Triple-A Albuquerque Dukes of the Pacific Coast League in 1982. He was 9–6 with a 3.71 ERA in 47 games, with seven starts. He was almost included in a trade with the Texas Rangers that season, but catcher Jim Sundberg wanted his contract re-written before agreeing to the deal and the Dodgers backed out of the transaction.

Hershiser won the Mulvey Award as the Dodgers top rookie in spring training in 1983 and expected to make the club but was sent back to Albuquerque where he was briefly reunited with pitching coach Rocky Giordani. He was 10–8 with a 4.09 ERA for the Dukes in 1983 in 49 games, with 10 starts and 16 saves.

===MLB career===

====Early years (1983–1987)====
The Dodgers promoted Hershiser to the major leagues for the first time on September 1, 1983. He made his debut the same day, against the Montreal Expos. He came into the game in the seventh inning and retired all three batters he faced on two ground outs and a strikeout (of Tim Wallach). However, in his second inning of work he allowed a double and a single for a run and was promptly taken out of the game. In eight appearances that month, he had an ERA of 3.38.

Hershiser played winter ball in the Dominican Republic after the season and worked with pitching coach Dave Wallace on his delivery. He was almost arrested when some fireworks his friends were setting off for a New Year&#x27;s party hit a Dominican General&#x27;s house, but Dodger coach Manny Mota intervened on his behalf.

Hershiser made the Dodgers Opening Day roster for the 1984 season as the last man in the bullpen and was mostly used as a long reliever early on. His first win was in a 12-inning game against the St. Louis Cardinals on April 5. After getting pounded in one game, he received such a loud, verbal lashing from Dodger manager Tommy Lasorda that his teammates took to calling it the &quot;sermon on the mound&quot;. Lasorda told Hershiser that he was too timid on the mound, giving hitters too much respect. He gave him the nickname &quot;Bulldog&quot; so that he would have a tougher attitude in games.

Hershiser made his first start on May 26 against the New York Mets because of an injury to Jerry Reuss. He pitched six innings and allowed only one run. He became a full-fledged starter in the Dodger rotation in July and responded by pitching four complete game shutouts that month, which was good enough to tie for the most in the Majors that season (with Joaquín Andújar and teammate Alejandro Peña). He finished the season with a record of 11–8 and a 2.66 ERA in 45 games (20 starts).

In the 1985 season he led the National League (NL) in winning percentage, compiling a 19–3 record with a 2.03 ERA. The Dodgers won the NL West, and Hershiser finished third in Cy Young Award voting. He also saw his first postseason action, pitching in two games in the 1985 National League Championship Series. In the 1986 season, Hershiser went 14–14 with a 3.85 ERA. The next season he was selected to his first All-Star Game while compiling a 16–16 record with a 3.06 ERA.

====Cy Young, scoreless streak, and World Series (1988)====
Hershiser started to feel sick playing golf a week before pitchers and catchers reported, and it was discovered he needed an emergency appendectomy. The Dodgers planned to hold him back in spring training, but instead let him go through it normally after he was fine during workouts on day one.

Hershiser in 1988 led the league in wins (23), innings (267), shutouts (8) and complete games (15). He was third in ERA at 2.26. He finished the season with a record 59 consecutive scoreless innings pitched, breaking the mark of innings, held by former Dodger Don Drysdale. The streak began on August 30, when he pitched four scoreless innings to conclude a game and the record was broken when he pitched 10 shutout innings, on 116 pitches, in the final game of the season. He was selected to his second all-star game and was a unanimous selection for the National League Cy Young Award. He also won the Gold Glove Award for the best fielding pitcher in the National League.

In the 1988 National League Championship Series between Hershiser&#x27;s Dodgers and the New York Mets, Hershiser not only started Games 1 and 3, but recorded the final out in Game 4 in relief for a save. He then pitched a complete-game shutout in Game 7 and was selected as the NLCS MVP. He then pitched a shutout in Game 2 of the World Series and allowed only two runs in a complete game in the clinching victory in Game 5, winning the World Series MVP Award.

Hershiser is the only player to receive the Cy Young Award, the Championship Series MVP Award, and the World Series MVP Award in the same season. He later received both &quot;The Sporting News&quot; Pitcher of the Year and &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine&#x27;s Sportsman of the Year award for his accomplishments in 1988.

====Final years with Dodgers (1989–1994)====

Hershiser signed a new $7.9 million three-year contract with the Dodgers prior to the 1989 season that was the richest three-year contract ever signed to that point.

That season, he made his third straight All-Star team and he had another good year with an ERA of 2.31 in 35 games. However, the Dodgers weren&#x27;t as good and he suffered from a lack of offensive support. He went 0–7 over one nine-game stretch because the team only scored nine runs total in that period. He had a 15–15 record that season but only evened it out because he pitched 11 innings in the last game of the season and threw 169 pitches. He was determined to stay in until his team took the lead, no matter what the manager wanted.

After just four starts in 1990, it was discovered that Hershiser had a torn labrum in the shoulder of his pitching arm. Dr. Frank Jobe performed shoulder reconstruction surgery on Hershiser on April 27, 1990, the first time the procedure had been performed on a major league player. He did not rejoin the Dodgers until May 29, 1991, a return that he called &quot;a miracle.&quot; Two games later, he picked up his 100th career win against the Chicago Cubs on June 9, 1991. In 21 starts, he was 7–2 with a 3.46 ERA. He won his last six decisions and was selected as the UPI Comeback Player of the Year.

There were still questions about his recovery heading into 1992, but he managed to pitch 33 games in both 1992 and 1993. His numbers were not what they were before the surgery, but he was still effective. He was 10–15 with a 3.67 ERA in 1992 and 12–14 with a 3.59 ERA in 1993. Notably in 1993, Hershiser hit .356 in 83 plate appearances, earning a Silver Slugger Award.

In his final start of 1994, on August 7, Hershiser took a no-hit bid into the sixth inning before it was broken up. The 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike ended the season on August 11. Hershiser was involved in the negotiations as part of the Major League Baseball Players Association but the strike signaled the end of his time with the Dodgers and he became a free agent.

====Cleveland Indians (1995–1997)====
Hershiser signed a three-year contract with the Cleveland Indians on April 8, 1995. Indians General Manager John Hart said that the team was looking for a veteran with &quot;character and competitiveness&quot; to show the young players how to play the right way. He went 16–6 with a 3.87 ERA in 26 starts for the Indians in 1995 to lead the young team to their first post-season appearance in 41 years.

Hershiser won the two games he pitched in the 1995 American League Championship Series (ALCS) against the Seattle Mariners and was selected as the ALCS MVP, the first player to have won the LCS MVP Award in both leagues. He also pitched effectively in the 1995 World Series against the Atlanta Braves, though the Indians would lose the series in six games.

He pitched two more seasons for the Indians, and was 14–6 for the 1997 team, including pitching seven shutout innings in Game 3 of the 1997 ALCS. In his final World Series appearance in 1997 he gave up 13 runs in 10 innings and lost 2 games to the Florida Marlins.

Though he pitched for the Indians for only three seasons, Hershiser became something of a folk hero in Cleveland. One memorable image from his tenure is of Hershiser screaming &quot;Take that!&quot; at the Braves dugout after starting a 1–3 double play late in game five of the 1995 World Series.

====Later career (1998–2000)====
Hershiser signed a one-year $3.45 million contract with the San Francisco Giants on December 7, 1997, but his age was beginning to catch up to him. He made 34 starts and was 11–10 with a 4.41 ERA in 1998. The contract contained an option for 1999 but the Giants declined the option after the season. At the time they said they might come to terms on a new deal. Instead he signed a minor league contract with the Indians on February 20, 1999.

The Indians released him during spring training and he signed with the New York Mets on March 25, 1999. Hershiser made 32 starts with the Mets and was 13–12 with a 4.58 ERA. He served as a mentor to the young pitchers on the Mets staff and helped them make the playoffs by allowing just one run in innings in a 2–1 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates in the last game of the season. He pitched out of the bullpen in the playoffs as the Mets lost to the Braves in the 1999 National League Championship Series.

Hershiser signed a one-year contract to return to the Dodgers on December 17, 1999. He started the home opener on April 14, 2000, against the Reds and allowed only one run in six strong innings. He struggled after that, allowing 36 runs on 42 hits, 14 walks and 11 hit batters. His 13.14 ERA in 2000 is the worst ERA by any pitcher with 20 or more innings. One day after allowing eight runs in innings on June 26, he was released by the Dodgers.

==Pitching style==
Hershiser was not an overpowering pitcher, but he developed a variety of pitches and outthought hitters. Hershiser explained his pitch repertoire in 1989 as follows:
:I have a sinking fastball to either side of the plate, a cutter (which changes the direction of my fastball so it breaks instead of sinking) to either side of the plate, a curveball I throw at three speeds and three angles, a straight change—using the same arm speed and position as a fastball but with a grip and a release that slows it dramatically, and changeups to different locations that I throw off my sinker which look like batting practice fastballs. Different locations, different speeds, and slightly different arm angles on all those pitches give me a wide palette of choices.
By 1999, he noted that his pitches were not as sharp, so he added a slider to the mix. He also emphasized locating his pitches in good spots: &quot;You&#x27;ll hear pitchers say, &#x27;I had great stuff and got shelled,&#x27; but you never hear them say, &#x27;I had great location and got shelled.

==Post-retirement==

Hershiser remained with the Dodgers briefly as a player-personnel consultant. He went to AAA Albuquerque and filed one report but there wasn&#x27;t much for him to do, so he left the position.

He was subsequently hired to work on broadcasts of the Little League World Series for ABC and ESPN in 2000–2001. He also worked on &quot;Wednesday Night Baseball&quot; for ESPN during the 2001 season.

Hershiser left that position to join the Texas Rangers as a special assistant to General Manager John Hart in fall of 2001 and was named as the Rangers pitching coach on June 22, 2002. In October 2005 Hershiser was mentioned as a candidate to replace Jim Tracy as manager of the Dodgers, but the position went to Grady Little. He was also mentioned as a possible replacement for Ken Macha of the Oakland Athletics; however, he was ultimately passed over for Bob Geren. He left his position of Rangers pitching coach after the 2005 season to become an executive director of the Rangers, reporting to Club President Jeff Cogen. He did not last long in that position as he quit on February 3, 2006.

On February 13, 2006, Hershiser rejoined ESPN as an analyst for &quot;Baseball Tonight&quot;, &quot;Sunday Night Baseball&quot;, and the Little League World Series.

Through a group that included fellow former Dodger Steve Garvey, Hershiser became involved in the bidding process for the Dodgers when the team was up for sale in 2011–12. His group did not make it past the first round of the bidding.

In 2014, Hershiser left ESPN and rejoined the Dodgers as a television analyst for their new regional sports network SportsNet LA. At the time, he teamed with Charley Steiner and Nomar Garciaparra to call Dodger road games not played in California when Vin Scully reduced his travel. Since 2017, he has worked with Joe Davis as the primary broadcast team for Dodger baseball following Scully&#x27;s retirement at the end of the 2016 season.

==Poker==
Hershiser started playing poker competitively in 2006. After retirement from baseball, he moved to Summerlin, Nevada, and befriended a poker instructor. He became a regular at Red Rock&#x27;s poker room in Summerlin, playing $2–$5 No Limit Hold&#x27;em.

Hershiser signed with Poker Royalty to represent his poker career. He was invited to participate in the 2008 NBC National Heads-Up Poker Championship. Playing under the PokerStars banner, Hershiser stunned the poker world by making the quarterfinals, defeating 2006 event champion Ted Forrest, Allen Cunningham, and Freddy Deeb—players who had won a total of 12 World Series of Poker bracelets heading into the event. Andy Bloch defeated him in the quarterfinals.

Hershiser has played in a number of events, including the 2008 World Series of Poker and the 2009 PokerStars Caribbean Adventure. Hershiser won $54,570 on September 7, 2008, by taking ninth place in the $10,000 Pokerstars World Championship of Online Poker Event 5. Hershiser also has made a tradition of giving an autographed baseball to the poker player who eliminates him.

==Personal life==
Hershiser is descended from a Hessian soldier who came to North America to fight in the American Revolutionary War. There had been people named &quot;Orel&quot; in his family &quot;for longer than anyone can remember&quot; and he was teased for the name as a child. He did not know until he was informed by Martina Navratilova during the filming of a commercial that it meant &quot;eagle&quot; in Czech.

Hershiser and his first wife, Jamie Byars, divorced in 2005. They have two sons, Orel Leonard V (known as Quinton) and Jordan. In 2010, Hershiser married his second wife, Dana Deaver. Jordan graduated from St. Mark&#x27;s School of Texas in 2007, where he earned all-conference honors in baseball and basketball, and played college baseball at the University of Southern California as a pitcher and first baseman. Despite his college career being hampered by injuries, Jordan was drafted by the Dodgers in the 34th round of the 2012 MLB draft. Hershiser and Deaver live in Las Vegas with Deaver&#x27;s two children.

Hershiser is an active Christian. He was a guest star on the 1992 episode of the Christian children&#x27;s video series &quot;McGee and Me!&quot; &quot;Take Me Out of the Ball Game&quot;. On an appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; after the 1988 World Series, Johnny Carson talked him into singing hymns for the audience.

<text>Branch Brook Park is a county park of Essex County, New Jersey. It is located in the North Ward of Newark, between the neighborhoods of Forest Hill and Roseville. A portion of the park is also located within the Township of Belleville. At , Branch Brook Park is the largest public park in the city of Newark.

The park is noted for the largest collection of cherry blossom trees in the United States, having over 5,000 in more than eighteen different varieties collectively called Cherryblossomland, as well as a Cherry Blossom Festival each April.

The park is home to many architecturally significant structures, including bridges, buildings, gates, and sculptures. Many of these were designed by the beaux-arts architectural firm of Carrère and Hastings headed by John Merven Carrère and Thomas Hastings. The pair designed two Subway Bridges now referred to as Subway 1, East and Subway 2, West.

== History ==
The area had served as an Army training ground during the American Civil War. At the time, the northern portion of the area had been a marsh known as Old Blue Jay Swamp. In 1867, Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, the designers of Central Park, presented their report on the site to the Board of Commissioners of the Newark Park. It recommended Concourse Hill, with its commanding views of Newark and distant Manhattan, as the best location for the park. However, the New Jersey State Legislature did not approve the $1 million required to acquire and improve the land. By the time the plan was re-visited 28 years later, only a third of the original that was envisioned was available for twice the cost.

The park was formally created almost three decades later, in 1895, by the newly created Essex County Parks Commission, making it the nation&#x27;s first county park. In 1898, a public appropriation financed the conversion of the swamp into a landscaped lake. The initial park was only in size but grew in the 1920s through private donations from prominent Newark families, such as the Ballantines, eventually reaching the city limit with Belleville and becoming one of the largest urban parks in the United States.

The Morris Canal originally ran on the park&#x27;s west side, until its old bed was turned into the Newark City Subway, providing access to the park from Downtown Newark.

The first designs of the park, based largely on romantic garden themes, were proposed in 1895 and 1898, after the Parks Commission hired several architectural firms to plan the park. In 1900, the commission hired the Olmsted Brothers firm to redesign the park. The result was the park&#x27;s current naturalistic look and feel, with acres of meadows and forests, in a manner similar to their father&#x27;s earlier designs of Central Park and Prospect Park.

The famous cherry trees were the result of a 1927 gift from Caroline Bamberger Fuld, sister of department store magnate Louis Bamberger and widow of the store&#x27;s vice president. The Cherry Blossom Festival attracts approximately 10,000 visitors each April. Branch Brook Park also features a lake and a pond.

During World War II, the park&#x27;s grounds served a tent city for recruits, as well as a landing strip for airplanes of the United States Postal Service.

The neighborhood on the east side of the park, Forest Hill, is Newark&#x27;s most affluent. Also on the east side of the park is the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart Basilica, one of the largest cathedrals in the United States.

It has been placed on both the New Jersey (1980) and National (1981) Registers of Historic Places.

=== Roller rink ===
In 1956, a former reservoir was converted to a skating rink to accommodate requests for year-round ice-skating facilities. In October 1957, it opened to the public, featuring dancing and roller-skating in the summer. Before December of that year, 50,000 skaters used the facility for ice-hockey and figure skating. In 1961, funds from a New Jersey Department of Transportation park sale purchase were used to fund an enlarged entrance and 230-car parking area. The structure was enclosed in 1969 for all-weather use. The present roller rink was designed circa 1992.

Its current iteration, Branch Brook Park Roller Skating Center, opened in 1996, is managed by national roller rink chain United Skates of America. The 12,000-foot roller rink building is located within the park, and has a contract with Essex County for Branch Brook. In 2013, &quot;NJ.com&quot; described the rink as &quot;a symbol of revitalization for Newark&quot; and &quot;a literal savior of urban skating&quot;, exemplifying its relationship to the community, including roller derby, style skating, gospel skaters, and DJ nightlife.

=== Restoration ===
In 1999, Branch Brook Park began a $25 million ten-year restoration program. In 2004, the Park Avenue bridge was repaired, as were the baseball fields in the center of the park. In 2007, a plan was created to provide for more than 5,000 cherry trees in the park and renovate and rename the Welcome Center. The plan uses a $650,000 grant from the Essex County Recreation and the Open Space Trust Fund from 2006 and private donations.

In 2012, statues dedicated to sports figures Althea Gibson and Roberto Clemente were unveiled in the park. In 2013 the park was in the final phase of the restoration plan.

<text>Bejeweled is a 2000 match-three video game developed and published by PopCap Games. &quot;Bejeweled&quot; involves lining up three or more multi-colored gems to clear them from the game board. The game was inspired by a similar browser game, titled &quot;Colors Game&quot;. Originally titled &quot;Diamond Mine&quot; and released in 2000 as a browser game on the team&#x27;s official website, &quot;Bejeweled&quot; was licensed to be hosted on MSN Games under its current name. PopCap released a retail version titled Bejeweled Deluxe in May 2001.

&quot;Bejeweled&quot; has since been ported to many platforms, particularly mobile devices. The game has been commercially successful, having sold over 10 million copies and been downloaded more than 150 million times. It is credited with popularizing match-three video games and launching the casual games industry, which grew to be worth $3 billion within a decade. The game was followed by a commercially successful series of sequels and spin-offs.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Bejeweled&quot; is a match-three video game. Gameplay centers around gaining points by swapping two adjacent gems within a tile-based grid to create lines of three or more matching gems, which will disappear and allow gems from above to fall and occupy the vacant space. If neither of the gems swapped create a line of three or more of the same gem, the two gems will revert to their original positions. Versions such as &quot;Bejeweled Deluxe&quot; have two game modes: untimed and timed. Untimed mode revolves around attempting to reach a high score and ends when no further matches are possible; timed mode involves trying to gain points to prevent a timer bar from reaching the end. JAMDAT&#x27;s &quot;Bejeweled Multiplayer&quot; includes an additional multiplayer mode, in which opponents compete in timed one-on-one matches. During these matches, players can use special gems, such as bomb gems, to affect their opponent&#x27;s gameplay.

== Development ==

After a failed venture into online erotic video games with the strip poker simulator &quot;Foxy Poker&quot; (2000), the video game developer Sexy Action Cool shifted to developing simple video games to license to other companies. At the time, the company consisted of its three cofounders: business manager John Vechey, programmer Brian Fiete, and designer Jason Kapalka. In April 2000, Vechey discovered a match-three browser game titled &quot;Colors Game&quot;, which was reportedly primitive. It used squares as graphics, required the webpage to be refreshed between moves to update the game, and did not have animation or sound effects. Finding the match-three mechanic addictive, the team was inspired to develop a more polished version of the game.

Though Kapalka considered using fruits or geometric shapes for the graphics, he ultimately picked gems, as the fruits lacked visual diversity and the shapes lacked visual appeal. The game, originally titled &quot;Diamond Mine&quot; after a song by the Canadian country rock band Blue Rodeo, had a cave mining theme before it was renamed to &quot;Bejeweled&quot;. It was initially time-based by default at the suggestion of other game developers such as Pogo.com, with the goal being to maximize one&#x27;s score before the timer ran out. Though an untimed mode was only included as an afterthought to serve as a tutorial, it would become the main mode associated with &quot;Bejeweled&quot; upon positive feedback from players.

== Release ==
&quot;Diamond Mine&quot; was released for browsers in 2000, first appearing on Sexy Action Cool&#x27;s website. The team offered &quot;Diamond Mine&quot; to Microsoft for $50,000 but were rejected and instead offered to lease the game for $1,500 per month for their online gaming portal MSN Games. Microsoft requested that they rename the game to &quot;Bejeweled&quot;, due to &quot;Diamond Mine&quot; sounding similar to another game titled &quot;Diamond Mines&quot;. Kapalka conceded to the naming despite disliking its similarity to the 2000 film &quot;Bedazzled&quot;. As part of their deal, the team maintained ownership of &quot;Bejeweled&quot; and hosted it on their site, while Microsoft hosted the game on MSN Games and created versions sponsored by other companies such as Tyson Foods and the National Pork Board. After the deal, Sexy Action Cool was renamed to PopCap Games to make the brand more reflective of their new family-oriented target audience.

Though &quot;Bejeweled&quot; was successful on MSN Games, PopCap did not experience significant monetary revenue. To remedy this, PopCap considered selling a cheap retail version of &quot;Bejeweled&quot;. Astraware executive Howard Tomlison suggested selling the game as shareware for $20, with the rationale that, for consumers, a cheap price would imply an inferior product. Around this time, Astraware ported &quot;Bejeweled&quot; to Palm personal digital assistants (Palm PDAs) on March 1, 2001. A retail version with graphical enhancements, titled &quot;Bejeweled Deluxe&quot;, was released for Microsoft Windows on May 30, 2001. The business model surrounding &quot;Bejeweled Deluxe&quot; and subsequent PopCap games was to provide both a free version to play online and a downloadable retail version with the option of a limited trial run before requiring payment to continue.

As PopCap became more successful, they planned to release their games to as many platforms as possible, including newly developing platforms such as mobile phones. Astraware ported &quot;Bejeweled&quot; to the Pocket PC on August 26, 2001, and Windows Mobile on May 3, 2004. &quot;Bejeweled&quot; was packaged with another PopCap game, &quot;Alchemy&quot;, by MacPlay for the Mac OS X on June 28, 2002. JAMDAT Mobile released a multiplayer version of &quot;Bejeweled&quot;, titled &quot;Bejeweled Multiplayer&quot;, for Java ME and BREW on May 13, 2003. &quot;Bejeweled&quot; was released as a launch title for Xbox Live Arcade on the original Xbox on November 6, 2004, and for the iTunes store on the fifth generation iPod on September 12, 2006. In the lead-up to the release of the Apple App Store, PopCap created a version of &quot;Bejeweled&quot; compatible with iPhones to be played through the Safari browser on July 30, 2007.

In February 2006, Electronic Arts (EA) acquired JAMDAT, granting EA&#x27;s subsidiary EA Mobile the rights to &quot;Bejeweled&quot; on mobile platforms, a license that would be extended through 2010, before EA acquired PopCap in July 2011. EA Mobile updated JAMDAT&#x27;s version of &quot;Bejeweled&quot; with graphical enhancements, releasing it on May 18, 2007 in North America. On August 12, 2008, EA Mobile announced a deal with Handango to distribute ports of EA Mobile&#x27;s games, including &quot;Bejeweled&quot;, on Windows Mobile, BlackBerry, and Symbian phones. EA Mobile added &quot;Bejeweled&quot; to BlackBerry App World on August 21, 2009.

==Reception==
&quot;Bejeweled&quot; achieved success on MSN Games, becoming the number one game by traffic on the site within a month and maintaining that position until July 2002. Vechey estimated that &quot;Bejeweled&quot; peaked at 50,000 to 60,000 users on MSN Games. &quot;Bejeweled Deluxe&quot; was commercially successful, netting PopCap $30,000 to $40,000 a month after its release. By 2008, &quot;Bejeweled&quot; had been downloaded 150 million times, with &quot;Bejeweled Deluxe&quot; selling 10 million copies.

The lack of skill required to play &quot;Bejeweled&quot; led to it being ignored by reviewers. However, according to gaming journalist Harold Goldberg, the reviewers who appreciated &quot;Bejeweled&quot; &quot;could feel a Zen peacefulness when playing&quot;, an experience comparable to &quot;Tetris&quot;. David Manning of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; wrote of the staff becoming transfixed with &quot;Bejeweled Deluxe&quot;, threatening the magazine&#x27;s production. The addictiveness of Astraware&#x27;s PDA versions were positively received by &quot;Maximum PC&quot; and &quot;Hyper&quot;. &quot;Bejeweled Multiplayer&quot; was praised by both &quot;IGN&quot; and &quot;GameSpot&quot; for its additions to the original &quot;Bejeweled&quot;, which they felt contributed to its entertainment value. &quot;IGN&quot; considered the Xbox Live port of &quot;Bejeweled&quot; fun but criticized its lack of multiplayer function. The iPod port of &quot;Bejeweled&quot; was criticized by &quot;IGN&quot; and &quot;Pocket Gamer&quot; for its controls, as the usage of the iPod&#x27;s click wheel was seen as unintuitive for an otherwise fun game.

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; selected &quot;Bejeweled&quot; as the best puzzle game of 2001 and included the game in their Hall of Fame in 2005, becoming the only puzzle game alongside &quot;Tetris&quot; to be inducted. At the 2004 G-Phoria, hosted by G4techTV, &quot;Bejeweled Multiplayer&quot; won &quot;Best Mobile Phone Game&quot; among 500,000 online votes. In 2007, &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; listed &quot;Bejeweled&quot; as a PC game that &quot;shaped a generation&quot;, saying, &quot;But not since &quot;Tetris&quot; has such a simple mechanic gripped so many for so long.&quot; &quot;Gameswelt&quot; (2012), &quot;Polygon&quot; (2017), and &quot;Game Informer&quot; (2018) have ranked &quot;Bejeweled&quot; as among the best video games of all time in their respective lists. In 2020, The Strong National Museum of Play inducted &quot;Bejeweled&quot; into the World Video Game Hall of Fame.

== Legacy ==
The popularity of &quot;Bejeweled&quot; is credited with the rise of the casual games industry in the 21st century. Kapalka attributes the rise to the exclusion of a default timer in &quot;Bejeweled&quot;, allowing for gaming that did not require skill. The commercial success of &quot;Bejeweled&quot; allowed PopCap to develop small casual games with high-production values to be ported on a wide-range of platforms, as games such as &quot;Bookworm&quot;, &quot;Peggle&quot;, and entries of the &quot;Bejeweled series&quot; were developed for multiple years. The success and simplicity of &quot;Bejeweled&quot; and other games developed by PopCap influenced independent video game studios to invest in developing low-cost video games for high profits. As a result, within a decade, the casual games industry grew to be worth $3 billion. &quot;Bejeweled&quot; influence led to it becoming the first mobile game inducted into the World Video Game Hall of Fame.

&quot;Bejeweled&quot; popularized the match-three genre of puzzle games; many such games have been accused of being &quot;Bejeweled&quot; clones and lacking innovation. Thousands of match-three video games have been released in the wake of &quot;Bejeweled&quot;, including over 2,200 match-three games on the Apple App Store as of February 2014. Some of these games, such as &quot;Candy Crush Saga&quot; (2012), have exceeded the popularity of &quot;Bejeweled&quot;. Developers such as King, Playrix, and Demiurge have created popular mobile games that tweak &quot;Bejeweled&quot; match-three formula. For example, Demiurge&#x27;s &quot;Puzzle Quest&quot; (2007) fuses match-three gameplay with role-playing game conventions, King&#x27;s &quot;Candy Crush Saga&quot; (2012) includes power-ups and stylized levels, and Playrix&#x27;s &quot;Gardenscapes&quot; (2016) involves renovating a garden through successful match-three rounds.

The &quot;Bejeweled&quot; series consists of two direct sequels and several spin-offs. Development of these entries, according to Kapalka, took years and were focused on improving upon the original formula. Of the direct sequels, &quot;Bejeweled 2&quot; released in 2004 to mixed reviews, while &quot;Bejeweled 3&quot; released in 2010 to positive reviews. Of the spin-offs, &quot;Bejeweled Twist&quot; released in 2008 and &quot;Bejeweled Blitz&quot; released in 2009 to positive reviews, while &quot;Bejeweled Stars&quot; released in 2016 to mixed reviews. The game series overall has been commercially successful; by 2010, &quot;Bejeweled&quot;, &quot;Bejeweled Twist&quot;, and &quot;Bejeweled Blitz&quot; collectively reached 50 million sales. Outside of the franchise, PopCap licensed a version of &quot;Bejeweled&quot; that can be played in &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; starting in September 25, 2008, and PopCap&#x27;s &quot;Plants vs. Zombies&quot; (2009) contains a mini-game based on &quot;Bejeweled&quot;, titled &quot;Beghouled&quot;.

<doc id="493992" wikidata="Q6581478" url="?curid=493992" title="Latin honors">
<text>Latin honors are a system of Latin phrases used in some colleges and universities to indicate the level of distinction with which an academic degree has been earned. The system is primarily used in the United States. It is also used in some Southeastern Asian countries with European colonial history, such as Indonesia and the Philippines, and African countries such as Zambia and South Africa, although sometimes translations of these phrases are used instead of the Latin originals. The honors distinction should not be confused with the honors degrees offered in some countries, or with honorary degrees.

The system usually has three levels of honor (listed in order of increasing merit): &quot;cum laude&quot;, &quot;magna cum laude&quot;, and &quot;summa cum laude&quot;. Generally, a college or university&#x27;s regulations set out definite criteria a student must meet to obtain a given honor. For example, the student might be required to achieve a specific grade point average, submit an honors thesis for evaluation, be part of an honors program, or graduate early. Each school sets its own standards. Since these standards vary, the same level of Latin honors conferred by different institutions can represent different levels of achievement. Similarly, some institutions grant equivalent (or additional) non-Latin honors to undergraduates. The University of Wisconsin–Madison, for example, has a series of plain English grading honors based on class standing. Some colleges and universities (e.g., Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Reed College, Yale Law School, and Stanford Law School) do not use honors at all.

These honors, when they are used, are almost always awarded to undergraduate students earning their bachelor&#x27;s degree, and, with the exception of law school graduates, much more rarely to graduate students receiving their master&#x27;s or doctorate degree. The honor is typically indicated on the diploma. Latin honors are often conferred upon law school students graduating as a Juris Doctor or J.D., in which case they are generally based upon class rank or grade point average.

==English-speaking countries==
===United States===
====Distinctions====

Most American colleges and universities use Latin honors for bachelor&#x27;s degrees and for the Juris Doctor degree, but not for other degrees such as master&#x27;s degrees or the Ph.D. and M.D. degrees. There are three standard levels of Latin honors:
*&quot;&quot; (English: ), meaning &quot;with praise&quot;, typically awarded to graduates in the top 20%, 25%, or 33% of their class, depending on the institution.
*&quot;&quot; (), meaning &quot;with great praise&quot;, typically awarded to graduates in the top 5%, 10%, or 15% of their class, depending on the institution.
* (), meaning &quot;with highest praise&quot;, typically awarded to graduates in the top 1%, 2%, or 5% of their class, depending on the institution. Some institutions do not award the &quot;summa cum laude&quot; distinction or award it only in extraordinary circumstances.

====History====
In 1869, Harvard College became the first college in the United States to award final honors to its graduates. From 1872 to 1879, &quot;cum laude&quot; and &quot;summa cum laude&quot; were the two Latin honors awarded to graduates. Beginning in 1880, &quot;magna cum laude&quot; was also awarded. In his 1895 history of Amherst College, college historian William Seymour Tyler traced Amherst&#x27;s system of Latin honors to 1881, and attributed it to Amherst College president Julius Hawley Seelye:

=== United Kingdom ===

 In the UK, the Latin &quot;cum laude&quot; is used in commemorative Latin versions of degree certificates sold by a few universities (e.g. the University of Edinburgh) to denote a bachelor&#x27;s degree with honours, but the honours classification is stated as in English, e.g. &quot;primi ordinis&quot; for first class rather than &quot;summa cum laude&quot;, etc. Official degree certificates use English.

==Other countries==
For undergraduate degrees, Latin honors are used in only a few countries such as Israel, Indonesia, the Dominican Republic, the Philippines, one university in Singapore and Canada. Most countries use a different scheme, such as the British undergraduate degree classification (usually used in Commonwealth countries) which is more widely used with varying criteria and nomenclature depending on country, including Australia, Bangladesh, Barbados, Brazil, Colombia, Georgia, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Jamaica, Kenya, New Zealand, Nigeria, Pakistan, Singapore, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Trinidad and Tobago, Uganda, the United Kingdom, Zimbabwe and many other countries. Malta shows the Latin honors on the degree certificates, but the UK model is shown on the transcript.

=== Austria ===
In Austria, the only Latin honor in use is (&quot;under the auspices of the president of the republic&quot;) for doctoral degrees. Candidates must have consistently excellent grades throughout high school and university, making it very difficult to attain: only about 20 out of a total of 2,500 doctoral graduates per year (i.e. 0.8%) achieve a degree.

=== Belgium ===
In Belgium, the university degree awarded is limited to:

* &lt;68% ( in Dutch, in French) 
* &gt;68% ( in Dutch, in French)
* &gt;77% ( in Dutch, in French)
* &gt;85% ( in Dutch, in French)
* &quot;with the congratulations of the examination committee&quot; &gt;90% ( in Dutch, in French)

=== Brazil ===
In Brazil, most universities do not provide honors to their students. Among the few universities that do so, the Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica (ITA—Technological Institute of Aeronautics) awards the honor for graduates with every individual grade above 8.5 (out of 10.0), the honor for graduates with average grade above 8.5 and more than 50% of individual grades above 9.5, and the honor for graduates with average grade above 9.5. As of 2009, only 22 graduates have received the honor at ITA. The Federal University of Rio de Janeiro awards the honor for graduates with average grade from 8.0 to 8.9, the honor for graduates with average grade from 9.0 to 9.4, and the honor for graduates with average grade from 9.5 to 10.0. The Federal University of Ceará awards the honor for undergraduates who have never failed a course, achieved an average grade from 8.5 (out of 10.0) and have received a fellowship of both &quot;Academic Extension&quot; and &quot;Teaching Initiation&quot;.

=== Czech Republic ===
In the Czech Republic, universities usually award the distinction to its best graduates in bachelors and masters study programmes. The criteria required by Czech universities are usually the following: a) an overall study results average up to 1.5 out of 4.0 (while &quot;1&quot; is the best, &quot;excellent&quot; grade and &quot;4&quot; is the failing grade), b) completion of the final state exam with the overall classification of 1 (&quot;excellent&quot;) and also c) proper completion of studies in a period not exceeding the standard period of study by more than one year. Other distinctions such as or are not used. Alternatively, the phrase , which means &quot;with honours&quot;, is substituted for the usual . The Czech universities usually do not award any Latin honours to its graduates in rigorosum and doctoral study programmes.

=== Estonia ===
In Estonia, up until 2010 both and were used. was awarded only for very exceptional work. Since 1 September 2010, only is used. It is awarded to bachelors, masters and integrated studies graduates. Occasionally the word , which means &quot;with praise&quot;, is substituted for the usual . To receive one must achieve a 4.60 GPA (out of 5) and receive the highest grade (A – 5.00) for the thesis or the final examination.

=== Finland ===

The Finnish Matriculation Examinations at the end of lukio/gymnasium uses the grades of: (I, failing; &quot;not accepted&quot;), (A; &quot;accepted&quot;), (B; &quot;willingly accepted&quot;), (C; &quot;accepted with praise&quot;), (M; &quot;accepted with great praise&quot;), (E; &quot;accepted with excellent praise&quot;) and (L; &quot;praised&quot;). They are roughly equivalent to Finnish school grades ranging from 4 to 10. Some Finnish universities, when grading master&#x27;s theses and doctoral dissertations, use the same scale with the additional grade of (N; &quot;accepted not without praise&quot;) between and ; technical universities use a numerical scale (1–5) instead.

=== France ===
In France, usually the French honors (&quot;very good mention&quot;), (&quot;good mention&quot;), and (&quot;quite good mention&quot;) are used. However some Grandes Écoles, like the Institut d&#x27;études politiques de Paris, HEC Paris, use the Latin and English titles / &quot;graduated with highest honors&quot; for the top 2% and / &quot;graduated with honors&quot; for the next 5% of a year. From 2016, honorifics ceased to be used for the completion of a PhD. Before this date, the French PhD diploma could be awarded with increasing honors: , , . While these honors grades have been revoked for the PhD diploma, they are still in use for doctors of Medicine, Pharmacy, and Dental Medicine.

=== Germany ===
In Germany, the range of degrees is:

* (&quot;below any scale&quot;, fail, numerical grade 5.0) (see Sub omni canone in German Wikipedia)
* or (&quot;insufficient&quot;, fail, numerical grade 4.0–5.0)
* (&quot;duly&quot; conferred, that is, the requirements are fulfilled, numerical grade 3.0–4.0)
* – or no additional comment (&quot;satisfying&quot;, numerical grade 3.0)
* (&quot;with honors&quot;, numerical grade 2.0)
* (&quot;with great honors&quot;, numerical grade 1.0)
* (&quot;with highest honors&quot;, numerical grade &lt; 1.0).

These degrees are mostly used when a doctorate is conferred, not for diplomas, bachelor&#x27;s or master&#x27;s degrees, for which numerical grades between 1.0 (&quot;very good&quot;) and 4.0 (&quot;pass&quot;), and 5.0 (&quot;fail&quot;), are given.

=== Hungary ===
In Hungary, the range of degrees—similar to the German system—is: (&quot;duly&quot; conferred, that is, the requirements are fulfilled), (with honors), (with highest honors). These degrees are used in university diplomas and in certain fields of sciences (medical, legal and a very few others) only. The grades of degrees are dependent on the received average points from final exams and from average points from the university studies.

=== Italy ===
In Italy, the notation ( being the equivalent in Italian) is used as an increasing level of the highest grade for both exams (30/30) and degrees (110/110), in all its levels; 
Passing an exam () has usually only an honorific meaning, but sometimes it influences the average grade and can be useful to the student so honored (usually weighting 31/30). is usually awarded after answering correctly a bonus difficult question at the oral examination.

In Italy, (at institutions using a 110-point system) is the highest rank that can be achieved during the academic studies, and corresponds usually to a final score greater than 110/110 (the specific threshold varies from university to university). Up to 3 bonus points can be awarded for merits, e.g. having an average exams score greater than 28.5/30 (95% equivalent), excellent final project or for graduating on time. More notations include: (&quot;academic kiss and embrace&quot;), (&quot;honor mention&quot;), and (&quot;dignity of printing&quot;), and were given based on various university-specific requirements, but without a legal value.

=== Malta ===
In Malta, for Bachelor Honours degrees refers to first class honours, refers to second class honours (upper division), refers to second class honours (lower division), whilst refers to third class honours. Professional degrees lasting longer than the standard three years such as the five year Bachelor of Pharmacy are awarded . Postgraduate diplomas and master&#x27;s degrees may be awarded as pass with distinction (), pass with merit (), or pass ().

=== Mexico ===
In Mexico, (also known as in Spanish) is used, by the major universities, to recognize an outstanding dissertation for bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and PhD degrees. Also different awards on public and private universities are given to the student with the highest final grade average (i.e. or Gabino Barreda Medal) and a diploma is given as a form of .

=== Netherlands ===
In the Netherlands, two classes of honors may be used for bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and PhD degree programs: (with honor) and (with highest honor). Typically these distinctions are reserved to mark exceptional achievement above a high minimum grade point average. Sometimes it is lost, despite a high average mark, when the student gets a mark of 6 or lower for one of the many exams (on a scale of 1–10, where 10 is the highest). It may also be awarded based on the weighted average of first achieved grades for each subject only. Generally, less than 2% receive the distinction. It is also possible to receive a PhD degree , although this honor is even rarer than for master&#x27;s graduates. In view of the difficulty and subjectivity of determining this, some universities and fields of study very seldom award doctorates . At Dutch university colleges , and, exceptionally, may be awarded.

=== Philippines ===
In the Philippines, junior high school and senior high school students under the new K–12 curriculum use an honor system using Filipino translations of the Latin original. Students who achieve a final grade average of 90-94 are awarded the title () and will receive a bronze medal with the DepEd seal. Those who have a final grade average of 95–97 receive the title of () and a silver medal with the same seal. Students with a final grade average of 98-100 shall be awarded the title of () and a gold medal with the same specification. In college, students are awarded the latin honors , and , respectively.

=== Russia ===
In Russia, the honor system is based on the grade point average. At least 4.75 out of 5.0 points are required for the summa cum laude degree (in Russian, , &quot;with excellence&quot;). The graduate has to receive a perfect grade on all final examinations. Usually less than 2% of all graduating students accomplish this (depending on the university and year). In military schools, a &quot;red diploma&quot; may be accompanied by a gold medal () for outstanding performance. Russian high schools also award a gold medal to the student who achieves a perfect score in all final examinations and in all other subjects not requiring a final exam. A silver medal is awarded to high school students who have one or two grades of 4 ( , &quot;good&quot;, being second highest grade) on their final exams or other subjects as listed in the high school diploma ( ).

It is only applicable to doctoral degrees that achieve an outstanding mark (10/10) and it is awarded after a secret vote of the jury members, using envelopes that must be opened in a session separate from the defense session. Obtaining the qualification of doctorate requires the unanimity of the members of the examining board (between 3 and 5 experts, depending on the university). In Spain, the summa cum laude mention is regulated by RD 534/2013.

=== Switzerland ===
In Switzerland, the degrees , , , (&quot;distinguished with praise&quot;), and are used, but the exact GPA corresponding to each varies by institution.

=== Ukraine ===
In Ukraine, the university education honor system is based on by-law # 161 (2 June 1993) of the Ministry of Education of Ukraine (3.12.3.5). For a student to graduate from a university with a diploma with honors (), students have to receive mark 5 (excellent) at least on 75% of courses, receive mark 4 (good) at max 25% of courses, and pass the state exams only with mark 5 (excellent). Also, students are expected to have participated in research projects with visible results.

<text>Willy Millowitsch (, ; 8 January 1909 – 20 September 1999) was a German stage and TV actor and the director of the &quot;Volkstheater Millowitsch&quot; in Cologne.

==Early life==
Millowitsch was born in Cologne, Rhine Province. His parents were Peter and Käthe Millowitsch and came from a long family tradition of engagement with the theater which can be traced back to 1792. It was not until 1895 however, that Millowitsch&#x27;s grandfather stopped using puppets and resorted to real actors instead.

Millowitsch was interested in theater at an early age and took to the stage for the first time in 1922 at just 13. He quit school without a degree to pursue his acting career full-time. At first he worked under the auspices of his father who had to give up his theater after the inflation hit. This forced them to go on tour in and around Cologne until they got a permanent theater in 1936, the now famous &quot;Volkstheater Millowitsch&quot;, which Willy took over from his father in 1940. In 1939 he married his first wife Lini Lüttgen, but they got divorced soon after.

During World War II, the theater was damaged, but not severely, and by October 1945 it was fully restored, owing to the support of mayor and later German chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, who proclaimed that the people need something to laugh about again. Consequently, in the time from 1945 to 1949 there were daily performances in the theater. It was during this time that he met his second wife, Gerda Millowitsch, formerly Feldhoff.

==Career==
In 1949, when the postwar theater euphoria died down, Millowitsch focused on his film and television career and in 1949 his first film (&quot;Search for Majora&quot;, directed by Hermann Pfeiffer) was released. Many more were to follow. He did not content himself just transferring from one medium to the other, but brought the theater with him. On 27 October 1953 the Kölsch dialect play &quot;Der Etappenhase&quot; was broadcast on the Western regional channel WDR, the first live broadcast of a theatrical performance with real audience in German television history. Despite bitter criticism of the entry of low &#x27;folk culture&#x27; into television by the director of the Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk, Adolf Grimme, it was an instant success. This remains one of Millowitsch&#x27;s most popular plays and has been performed more than 1,000 times. &quot;Der Etappenhase&quot; was so popular that just six weeks later it was broadcast again, live from the &quot;Volkstheater&quot;.

He continued to put on television plays that were instant successes, gaining national popularity. It is in great part Millowitsch&#x27;s achievement to have popularized Kölsch throughout Germany. People were now associating the &quot;Rhinelander&quot; with a relaxed lifestyle and genial humor. Theaters from other dialectal areas scrambled to catch up with him and soon the dialect theater became an important part of the German television landscape.

With the success of these plays on television, interest in theater gradually increased and by the 1960s flocks of people took to the theater again to witness performance of Millowitsch&#x27;s popular plays first hand. Until the beginning of the 1960s Millowitsch had to rent out his theater now and again, but with the arrival of the new crowds Millowitsch could afford to concentrate his career on theater from then on. He renovated the theater in 1967 and the &quot;Volkstheater&quot; once again became a focal point of local culture, and many young dialect artists started their careers there.

Throughout the 1970s, Millowitsch stuck to the folk theater, and it wasn&#x27;t until the end of the 1980s that he also turned back to television and took the title role in a detective series as Kommissar Klefisch, whom he played until 1996. He played a small part in the Hollywood comedy &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s European Vacation&quot; with Chevy Chase (1985). Aside from his theatrical merits, he also wrote classic popular folk songs, such as &quot;Schnaps, das war sein letztes Wort&quot; and &quot;Wir sind alle kleine Sünderlein&quot;. He also embraced political causes and in 1992 he participated in the important anti-Nazi campaign, &quot;Arsch huh, Zäng ussenander&quot; (Kölsch, meaning: Move your butts and pipe up!), which culminated in a major concert by local acts attended by 100,000 people at Cologne&#x27;s Chlodwigplatz.
==Death and legacy==
In 1989, the city of Cologne conferred honorary citizenship on to Millowitsch, which is a very exclusive honor in Germany. He celebrated his 90th birthday on 8 January 1999, with 18,000 fans at a sold-out event at the Kölnarena and told people all he wanted for his birthday was to stay healthy. However, he died of heart failure on 20 September that year.

Two of his four children, Peter Millowitsch, who is now the director of the &quot;Volkstheater&quot;, and Mariele Millowitsch have continued the family tradition and have both become successful actors. The city of Cologne has named a square near the Millowitsch theater &quot;Willy-Millowitsch-Platz&quot; in his honor.

<doc id="493995" wikidata="Q1140112" url="?curid=493995" title="Deltahedron">
<text>A deltahedron is a polyhedron whose faces are all equilateral triangles. The deltahedron was named by Martyn Cundy, after the Greek capital letter delta resembling a triangular shape Δ.

Deltahedra can be categorized by the property of convexity. The simplest convex deltahedron is the regular tetrahedron, a pyramid with four equilateral triangles. There are eight convex deltahedra, which can be used in the applications of chemistry as in the polyhedral skeletal electron pair theory and chemical compounds. There are infinitely many concave deltahedra.

== Strictly convex deltahedron ==

A polyhedron is said to be &quot;convex&quot; if a line between any two of its vertices lies either within its interior or on its boundary, and additionally, if no two faces are coplanar (lying in the same plane) and no two edges are collinear (segments of the same line), it can be considered as being strictly convex. 

Of the eight convex deltahedra, three are Platonic solids and five are Johnson solids. They are: 
* regular tetrahedron, a pyramid with four equilateral triangles, one of which can be considered the base.
* triangular bipyramid, regular octahedron, and pentagonal bipyramid; bipyramids with six, eight, and ten equilateral triangles, respectively. They are constructed by identical pyramids base-to-base.
* gyroelongated square bipyramid and regular icosahedron are constructed by attaching two pyramids onto a square antiprism or pentagonal antiprism, respectively, such that they have sixteen and twenty triangular faces.
* triaugmented triangular prism, constructed by attaching three square pyramids onto the square face of a triangular prism, such that it has fourteen triangular faces.
* snub disphenoid, with twelve triangular faces, constructed by involving two regular hexagons in the following order: these hexagons may form a bipyramid in degeneracy, separating them into two parts along a coinciding diagonal, pressing inward on the end of diagonal, rotating one of them in 90°, and rejoining them together.

The number of possible convex deltahedrons was given by , using the fact that multiplying the number of faces by three results in each edge is shared by two faces, by which substituting this to Euler&#x27;s polyhedron formula. In addition, it may show that a polyhedron with eighteen equilateral triangles is mathematically possible, although it is impossible to construct it geometrically. Rausenberger named these solids as the &quot;convex pseudoregular polyhedra&quot;.

Summarizing the examples above, the deltahedra can be conclusively defined as the class of polyhedra whose faces are equilateral triangles. Another definition by is similar to the previous one, in which he was interested in the shapes of holes left in irregular close-packed arrangements of spheres. It is stated as a convex polyhedron with equilateral triangular faces that can be formed by the centers of a collection of congruent spheres, whose tangencies represent polyhedron edges, and such that there is no room to pack another sphere inside the cage created by this system of spheres. Because of this restriction, some polyhedrons may not be included as a deltahedron: the triangular bipyramid (as forming two tetrahedral holes rather than a single hole), pentagonal bipyramid (because the spheres for its apexes interpenetrate, so it cannot occur in sphere packings), and regular icosahedron (because it has interior room for another sphere).

Most convex deltahedra can be found in the study of chemistry. For example, they are categorized as the &quot;closo&quot; polyhedron in the study of polyhedral skeletal electron pair theory. Other applications of deltahedra—excluding the regular icosahedron—are the visualization of an atom cluster surrounding a central atom as a polyhedron in the study of chemical compounds: regular tetrahedron represents the tetrahedral molecular geometry, triangular bipyramid represents trigonal bipyramidal molecular geometry, regular octahedron represents the octahedral molecular geometry, pentagonal bipyramid represents the pentagonal bipyramidal molecular geometry, gyroelongated square bipyramid represents the bicapped square antiprismatic molecular geometry, triaugmented triangular prism represents the tricapped trigonal prismatic molecular geometry, and snub disphenoid represents the dodecahedral molecular geometry.

== Non-convex deltahedron ==

A &quot;non-convex deltahedron&quot; is a deltahedron that does not possess convexity, thus it has either coplanar faces or collinear edges. There are infinitely many non-convex deltahedra. Some examples are stella octangula, the third stellation of a regular icosahedron, and Boerdijk–Coxeter helix.

There are subclasses of non-convex deltahedra. shows that they may be discovered by finding the number of varying vertex&#x27;s &quot;types&quot;. A set of vertices is considered the same type as long as there are subgroups of the polyhedron&#x27;s same group transitive on the set. Cundy shows that the great icosahedron is the only non-convex deltahedron with a single type of vertex. There are seventeen non-convex deltahedra with two types of vertex, and soon the other eleven deltahedra were later added by , Other subclasses are the isohedral deltahedron that was later discovered by both and , and the &quot;spiral deltahedron&quot; constructed by the strips of equilateral triangles was discovered by .

<text>Canada&#x27;s Wonderland, formerly known as Paramount Canada&#x27;s Wonderland, is a amusement park located in Vaughan, Ontario, a municipality within the Greater Toronto Area. Opened in 1981 by the Taft Broadcasting Company and the Great-West Life Assurance Company, it was the first major theme park in Canada and remains the country&#x27;s largest. Cedar Fair (merged with Six Flags since 1 July 2024) purchased the park from Paramount Parks in 2006, and they have owned and operated the park since then. In 2019, it was the most-visited seasonal amusement park in North America with an estimated 3.9 million guests. The park still retains this record, with an estimated 3.8 million guests in 2022 amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Canada&#x27;s Wonderland normally operates from late April or early May to Labour Day, and then on select dates until early January. Special events are held throughout the season, including Halloween Haunt, WinterFest, and various festivals such as Celebration Canada, a month-long Canada Day festival.

With eighteen roller coasters, Canada&#x27;s Wonderland has the third most of any theme park around the world, behind Energylandia in Poland with nineteen and Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, California with twenty. of the park houses a water park named Splash Works.

Since the closure of Crystal Beach Park in Fort Erie in 1989, Canada&#x27;s Wonderland remains the only amusement park in Ontario with wooden roller coasters in operation. Since the closure of all rides in Marineland of Canada in 2024, Canada&#x27;s Wonderland remains the only amusement park in Ontario with roller coasters with inversions in operation.

==Park history==
===Predecessors===
When Canada&#x27;s Wonderland was planned, the Greater Toronto Area lacked a seasonal amusement park that had roller coasters. The city of Toronto had previously hosted three amusement parks that had roller coasters. Sunnyside Amusement Park closed in the 1950s to make room for the Gardiner Expressway. The Scarboro Beach and Hanlan&#x27;s Point amusement parks both closed in the 1920s.

===Planning===
In 1972, the Taft Broadcasting Company, headed by Kelly Robinson, first proposed building a theme park in the then small village of Maple, part of Vaughan, Ontario, located directly north of Toronto. Several other possible locations in Ontario were considered, including Niagara Falls, Cambridge, and Milton, but Maple was finally selected because of its proximity to the City of Toronto and the 400-series of highways.

Others had seriously considered the Greater Toronto Area as a spot to build a theme park, among them the Conklin family (whose Conklin Shows ran various midways around North America, including Toronto&#x27;s Canadian National Exhibition midway in Exhibition Place). Walt Disney also considered the idea before choosing Florida for the Walt Disney World Resort, rejecting Toronto mainly because of the city&#x27;s seasonal climate, which would make the operating season too short to be profitable.

Construction of the park was opposed on multiple fronts. Many cultural institutions in Torontosuch as Ontario Place, the Royal Ontario Museum, and the operators of the Canadian National Exhibitionfelt that the Toronto market was not large enough to support more competition. Other groups that fought the building of Wonderland included a Vaughan residential association called SAVE, which thought the increased traffic would reduce property values. People in the region were concerned that the new park would be similar in aesthetics to a carnival or midway. Some of the concessions the company made included a landscaped berm around the park to reduce noise and modifying the appearance of the large parking lot. Taft Broadcasting was concerned about opposition and flew a group of opponents and regional councillors to Mason, Ohio (just north of Cincinnati) to show them the positive impact of one of its theme parks on the local community.

Canada&#x27;s Wonderland was also responsible for changing the master development plan for the province of Ontario. The provincial government wanted to increase residential and commercial development to the east of Toronto in the Regional Municipality of Durham, which includes Pickering and Oshawa, while keeping the lands to the north of Toronto agricultural, as a Greenbelt. The Wonderland promoters were able to convince the province to amend the planning policy for the region, and the park secured infrastructure improvements, including a highway overpass and sewage systems, that were expanded and built out to the site. This infrastructure paved the way for increased development throughout the region.

Concerns were also raised about the cultural implications of allowing an American theme park to open in Canada. Many felt that it would be a &quot;Trojan Horse&quot; for American culture. To counter the criticism, Taft planned to open Frontier Canada, a part of the park devoted to Canada&#x27;s history. Early park maps show the area encompassing what is now Splash Works, White Water Canyon, the Action Theatre and the southern part of Kidzville. Taft also proposed including a steam passenger train. While Frontier Canada was not brought up as an idea until 2019 by a different owner, several original themes remain in the area. Unlike its sister parks, Kings Island and Kings Dominion, it was decided early that the centrepiece of the park would not be a replica of Paris&#x27;s famous Eiffel Tower. Instead, the park&#x27;s designers chose to build a massive mountain, known as Wonder Mountain, situated at the top of International Street. Wonder Mountain featured a huge waterfall and interior pathways that led visitors to a look-out point. The interior pathways have been closed since and have remained closed. In 2018, the park announced plans to open a Hyatt House and Hyatt Place–branded hotel eventually.

===Construction and opening===
On 13 June 1979, Ontario Premier Bill Davis depressed the plunger on an electronic detonating device at St. Lawrence Hall in downtown Toronto, triggering an explosion on the site. Construction began immediately and continued on to early 1981. Canadian companies were partners on the preliminary design and engineering of the project. Construction of the mountain alone involved a dozen local companies under Cincinnati engineer Curtis D. Summers.

Two years later on 23 May 1981, Davis and Taft Broadcasting President Dudley S. Taft Sr. officially opened Canada&#x27;s Wonderland to the public. The spectacular opening ceremony included 10,000 helium balloons, 13 parachutists, 350 white doves, and a pipe band. Four children, representing the Arctic, Pacific, Atlantic, and Great Lakes regions of Canada, each poured a vial of water from their home regions into the park&#x27;s fountain. Hockey superstar Wayne Gretzky also appeared as a special guest, helping to raise the Canadian flag. 12,000 guests were welcomed into the park for the first time. The park cost $120 million ($ million in dollars) to build.

===Kings Entertainment and Paramount era===
During the 1980s, Canada&#x27;s Wonderland and the Loblaws supermarket chain mounted a cross-marketing campaign. Loblaws issued &quot;Wonder dollars&quot; based on customers&#x27; purchases, which were redeemable at Canada&#x27;s Wonderland at par with the Canadian dollar on weekdays. The obverse of the coin featured Wonder Mountain, while the reverse featured the Loblaws logo.

Kings Entertainment Company operated the park during the 1980s and early 1990s. The park&#x27;s former connection to Hanna-Barbera Productions lessened after Paramount Pictures raised its stake from 20 percent to full ownership of the park in 1993 and renamed it Paramount Canada&#x27;s Wonderland. After Viacom bought Paramount in 1994, a successful attempt was made to bring families back to the park by attracting children with original Nickelodeon cartoon characters that were familiar to a new generation.

Many changes occurred in the next decade. In 1996, Splash Works expanded, with a new water slide, a wave pool and a new child-friendly water playground (The Black Hole, White Water Bay and The Pump House). In 1998, the park expanded by adding KidZville, which was mainly designed for infants and children. In 1999, Splash Works expanded for the second time, with the addition of raft rides: The Plunge and Super Soaker.

Other changes involved Paramount incorporating references to their film properties into the park. This included the addition of film props around the property, a film-merchandise store, and the renaming of several attractions after Paramount film properties.

In 2001, a new themed area called Zoom Zone was added within the KidZville section. Three new attractions were built in that area: Silver Streak (a family roller coaster), Blast Off (a &quot;frog hopper&quot;), and Jumpin&#x27; Jet. In 2002, the park unveiled Action Zone, a new themed area replacing the Exposition of 1890, which at the time contained already existing rides and added the Psyclone ride.

Splash Works also received its third and most current upgrade, with the addition of a child water playground area called Splash Island and the removal of Pipeline.

On 11 May 2003, with the park packed with people for Mother&#x27;s Day, two guests were involved in a fight at the front gates of the park, which led to a shooting death. It was thought to have followed a prior dispute involving the two over a drug exchange, according to York Regional Police. The park has since added metal detectors at the front gate, with additional security, but not as a direct result of this event.

In 2005, the park introduced Fearfest, a Halloween event featuring various haunted house attractions in different themed areas. Though the section for smaller children was closed off, the park continued running many of the thrill rides during the event, such as the Thunder Run, in which patrons ride a mining type train through a mountain. During the Halloween season, it is re-themed as the &quot;Haunted&quot; Thunder Run, with a darker tunnel and more strobe lights, fog machines, and black-light lit scenes featuring the &quot;skeletons&quot; of miners.

In 2006, the park introduced Spooktacular, a child-oriented Halloween event. The event included children&#x27;s rides, costume contests and a treasure hunt. Spooktacular was open on weekends during the daytime, while Fearfest remained open at night. Fearfest was renamed Halloween Haunt and Spooktacular was renamed Camp Spooky.

===Cedar Fair era===
On 14 May 2006, Cedar Fair announced it was interested in acquiring the five Paramount theme parks from CBS Corporation (successor of the original Viacom), including Canada&#x27;s Wonderland. CBS stated that amusement parks did not fit the company&#x27;s new strategy. The acquisition was completed on 30 June 2006.

After the sale, Cedar Fair began to drop the name &quot;Paramount&quot; from all of the former Paramount properties it acquired, as a result, the park reverted to its original name of &quot;Canada&#x27;s Wonderland&quot; in January 2007. The 2007 season was a transition year throughout the park and included renaming the movie-themed rides since Cedar Fair did not hold the rights to Paramount film properties. By the start of the 2008 season, all Paramount logos and similar references had been removed. In August 2007, Cedar Fair announced that Fearfest would become Halloween Haunt to remain consistent with most other Cedar Fair parks, and that Spooktacular would become Camp Spooky. The park extended its regular operating season until the last weekend in October. Halloween Haunt runs in the late evenings on October weekends.

On 4 May 2008, Canada&#x27;s Wonderland opened a Bolliger &amp; Mabillard hypercoaster called Behemoth, which held the record for the tallest and fastest roller coaster in Canada at the time of its opening, standing at and reaching speeds of .

On 19 July 2009, stunt performer Nik Wallenda walked on a tight rope from the pond area of Medieval Faire to Wonder Mountain.

For the 2010 season, &quot;Planet Snoopy&quot; opened to the public, which was a retheme of both &quot;The Happy Land of Hanna-Barbera&quot; &amp; &quot;Nickelodeon Central&quot; areas of the park to align Canada&#x27;s Wonderland with the rest of the Cedar Fair chain. The area consisted of a retheme of all of the rides and facilities of both areas into one cohesive section themed to the Peanuts comics (both Ghoster Coaster &amp; Swan Lake remained unchanged following the change), along with the addition of three new rides for children and families from Zamperla; Lucy&#x27;s Tugboat, Peanuts 500, and Snoopy&#x27;s Revolution.

In 2011, Canada&#x27;s Wonderland opened WindSeeker, a tower-swing ride, making it the tallest ride in the park until &quot;Leviathan&quot; opened in 2012. The park also announced the addition of the Starlight Spectacular show, which started on 25 June 2011 and ended on Labour Day, 3 September 2011. It was a nightly &#x27;light and sound show&#x27; designed to celebrate the park&#x27;s 30th anniversary; it was shown at 10 pm EST every night on International Street. Canada&#x27;s Wonderland stated that the total cost for the show was approximately $1 million, with 16 million different colours and 300,000 LED lights. While the show took place at the front of the park (International Street), the highlight was on Wonder Mountain, with many 3D images and colours.

In 2012, Leviathan, a Bolliger &amp; Mabillard Hypercoaster (also classified as a giga coaster), opened, surpassing the Canadian records set by Behemoth in 2008, becoming the tallest and fastest roller coaster in Canada. Norm Pirtovshek, general manager of Canada&#x27;s Wonderland, said that the Leviathan as a new attraction would help to spread out visitors. It was also described as part of a &quot;roller coaster renaissance&quot; where theme parks distinguished itself by introducing bigger and faster rides to attract guests. In addition to Leviathan, Canada&#x27;s Wonderland also opened the Dinosaurs Alive! walk-through dinosaur exhibit, which was located in &quot;Planet Snoopy&quot;.
On 27 May 2012, for the first time in the park&#x27;s history, Canada&#x27;s Wonderland in partnership with the Ahmadiyya Muslim Youth Association hosted the Run For Vaughan, a one-kilometre, 5-kilometre, and 10-kilometre run to raise money for the planned Cortellucci Vaughan Hospital (then known as Mackenzie Vaughan Hospital) that would be built on land once owned by Canada&#x27;s Wonderland north of Major Mackenzie Drive.

On 30 August 2013, Canada&#x27;s Wonderland announced that Wonder Mountain&#x27;s Guardian would open inside Wonder Mountain in May 2014. The attraction is a 4-D interactive dark ride/ roller coaster with animations from Montreal-based Triotech. Park management also announced that SkyRider would close Labour Day, 2014.

In October 2014, a man was fatally stabbed at Halloween Haunt. SkyRider was removed at the end of the 2014 season and relocated to Cavallino Matto in Tuscany, Italy, as Freestyle in 2015.

For the 2015 season, Splash Works opened two new attractions, which marked the first expansion to the waterpark since 2002. Both attractions were relocated from Ontario Place, however they never opened in their original locations and were sent to Splash Works. Typhoon is a set of two partially enclosed tube slides with funnels, and was formerly known as &quot;Topsy Turvy&quot;. Splash Station is an interactive children&#x27;s play structure similar to the adjacent Pump House, featuring two slides, numerous water features, and a tipping bucket. Though not announced prior to its opening, SlingShot also for the 2015 season in the dry park. This upcharge attraction catapults riders nearly 300 ft (91.5m)in the air, and reaches speeds approaching 100 km/h (60 mph).

Near the close of the 2015 season, Canada&#x27;s Wonderland announced that two new flat rides would be added in 2016: Skyhawk (a Gerstlauer Sky Roller) and Flying Eagles (a Larson International Flying Scooters). Cedar Fair CEO Matt Ouimett also confirmed in December 2015 that virtual reality (VR) headsets would be added to Thunder Run in 2016. Available to riders for an additional upcharge fee, the experience is co-developed with Mack Rides, a German amusement ride company. The VR headgear is a type of head-mounted display that animates the entire field of vision to produce a 360-degree 3D experience.

On 26 August 2016, Canada&#x27;s Wonderland announced that a new flat ride would be added in the 2017 season: Soaring Timbers (a Mondial Inferno). The ride is stated to be the first of its kind in North America. The park also announced a Splash Works expansion for 2017 in the form of Muskoka Plunge, a tall waterslide complex featuring four &quot;trap-door&quot; speed slides. The slides replaced Body Blast.

On 16 August 2017, Canada&#x27;s Wonderland announced the addition of Flying Canoes for the 2018 season. Flying Canoes is an interactive family ride that allows riders to control their journey of flight in two-person canoes that rotate speedily around a circuit. They also announced the addition of Lumberjack for 2018. Made by Italian manufacturer Zamperla, Lumberjack is a thrill ride that takes guests to heights of on two swinging axe-themed pendulums, propelling them into a looping 360-degree experience. In addition to these two attractions, the park announced an expansion to the Splash Island pool (located in Splash Works), which doubled the size of the pool and included new interactive water features and children&#x27;s slides, along with shaded seating areas for families to relax. The area was renamed to Lakeside Lagoon following these upgrades.

On 15 August 2018, Canada&#x27;s Wonderland announced Yukon Striker, a B&amp;M Dive Coaster which opened to the public on 3 May 2019. The ride features a drop into an underwater tunnel in the centre of the Vortex helix, which has a top speed of 130 km/h. Upon opening, the ride became the tallest, fastest, and longest dive coaster in the world and features four inversions, more than any other dive coaster, including the first vertical loop on a Dive Coaster. They also announced the opening of Frontier Canada, a gold-rush-themed attraction area that includes Yukon Striker, Mighty Canadian Minebuster, Lumberjack, Soaring Timbers, Flying Canoes, Vortex, Timberwolf Falls and White Water Canyon. Canada&#x27;s Wonderland also announced Winterfest, an immersive holiday-themed event. In addition, the park announced that &quot;Dinosaurs Alive!&quot; would be closing on 28 October 2018. The attraction&#x27;s former gift shop is still used seasonally for WinterFest.

On 4 February 2019, the park announced that Orbiter would not be opening for the 2019 season. Since the announcement, the attraction has been removed from the park and the area surrounding it was replaced with a pathway connecting Action Zone and Frontier Canada.

On 14 August 2019, Canada&#x27;s Wonderland announced the addition of two new attractions for the 2020 season. The first, Beagle Brigade Airfield, is a new children&#x27;s ride located in Planet Snoopy. The attraction is mostly identical to the version at sister park Worlds of Fun in Kansas City, Missouri, which share the same name, but Wonderland&#x27;s version is partially covered. In addition, the park announced Mountain Bay Cliffs for Splash Works, which is a cliff-jumping style attraction featuring multiple platforms of varying heights, the highest of which is . Both of these attractions opened in 2021.

On 22 November 2019, WinterFest debuted at Canada&#x27;s Wonderland. WinterFest is a holiday event. During WinterFest, five million energy-efficient LED lights were strung on 800 trees, the buildings, the décor, and on Wonder Mountain. On International Street, the lake had been frozen into a skating rink called Snow Flake Lake. There were eight themed areas.

On 16 June 2022, Canada&#x27;s Wonderland announced Lazy Bear Lodge (marketed as &quot;Lazy Bear Lodge: Wood Fire Grille&quot;), which became the park&#x27;s largest dining facility to date. The restaurant is located on the hillside beside Vortex&#x27;s first drop, overlooking Yukon Striker and the rest of Frontier Canada, and features seating for over 500 guests, an indoor and outdoor bar, two floors, a multi-level outdoor patio, and numerous fire pits for guests to relax by. The menu is a Canadian-inspired rustic-grill BBQ, featuring local ingredients and two meat smokers. In addition, the menu is rotational, changing for each major season. The restaurant opened to the public on 17 September 2022, with the indoor bar opening a week prior.

On 11 August 2022, Canada&#x27;s Wonderland announced two new attractions for the 2023 season. The first, Tundra Twister, is a first-of-its-kind flat ride from Mondial that is located in Frontier Canada next to Yukon Striker&#x27;s zero-g winder inversion, creating many near-misses with the coaster. The ride features rotating gondola arms that freely rotate, while the ride&#x27;s base spins 360 degrees at heights of and speeds of . The second was Snoopy&#x27;s Racing Railway, a family launch coaster manufactured by ART Engineering and the park&#x27;s 18th roller coaster overall. Snoopy&#x27;s Racing Railway is located in Planet Snoopy and takes up a portion of the land that was previously occupied by Dinosaurs Alive!. The coaster opened to the public on 18 May 2023, and Tundra Twister opened to the public a few weeks later on 3 June 2023.

On 10 August 2023, the park announced Moosehorn Falls, a new waterslide for Splash Works for the 2024 season. The slide features six-person rafts travelling down a course of small drops and turns before plummeting down a large drop into a wall, leading into the final splash pool. The name &quot;Moosehorn Falls&quot; is inspired by waterfalls on the Moosehorn Trail in the Fundy National Park in New Brunswick. The trail and park is located within the UNESCO-designated Fundy Biosphere Region. The attraction opened in June 2024.

On 8 February 2024, Canada&#x27;s Wonderland announced that Xtreme Skyflyer would permanently shut down for the 2024 season after 26 years of operating. The attraction gave over 1.17 million rides prior to its removal. This closure was cited for future expansion and development by the park.

====COVID-19 pandemic====

Restrictions placed by the Government of Ontario to combat the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the park remaining closed for the 2020 season. This also led to the cancellations of that season&#x27;s Halloween Haunt and Winterfest events. Canada&#x27;s Wonderland posted a series of four horror vignettes 30 October 2020 titled Nighttime Walk to celebrate Haunt featuring the empty park. The park attempted to reopen in May 2021, but it was postponed to July of the same year. An online reservation system was required for guests to book the date and time of their visit during the shortened 2021 season. As a result, 2020 and 2021 season passes were extended to partially include the 2022 season and refunds were not officially offered. Both Beagle Brigade Airfield and Mountain Bay Cliffs had their opening years pushed back to the 2021 season.

Also due to the pandemic, the 2020 and 2021 editions of Toronto&#x27;s original Santa Claus Parade – normally held on the streets in Downtown Toronto in previous years – was pre-recorded from Canada&#x27;s Wonderland with no spectators on site and was broadcast on Eastern Standard Time&#x27;s prime time on 5 December 2020 and 4 December 2021, respectively. From 29 March 2021 until summer 2021, Canada&#x27;s Wonderland served as a drive-in mass COVID-19 vaccination site.

===Six Flags era===
On 1 July 2024, Cedar Fair merged with Six Flags, and the combined Six Flags Entertainment Corporation took over Canada&#x27;s Wonderland.

On 8 August 2024, the park announced the construction of a Premier Rides launched coaster for the 2025 season known as AlpenFury. The ride will be in length and feature a launch out of Wonder Mountain at along with nine inversions, setting a record for inversions on a launched roller coaster in North America. Concurrent with AlpenFury&#x27;s addition, the International Festival section of the park will be renamed and re-themed to Alpenfest to match the new ride.

==Attractions==

===Roller coasters===

==Grounds==

Canada&#x27;s Wonderland is situated in Maple, a neighbourhood of Vaughan, Ontario. The park is east of Highway 400 between Rutherford Road (Exit 33) and Major Mackenzie Drive (Exit 35), north of Highway 401, north of Highway 407 and south of Barrie. It is bounded by Highway 400 to the west, Jane Street to the east, Major Mackenzie Drive to the north and an access road approximately north of Rutherford Road to the south. When the park originally opened, its surroundings were largely rural; however, the suburban sprawl since the mid-2000s has resulted in it being surrounded by housing and shopping plazas on all sides.

Canada&#x27;s Wonderland is located north of Vaughan Mills and north of Vaughan Metropolitan Centre station of Line 1 Yonge–University of the Toronto subway system. Prior to the opening of the subway station in December 2017, it was served by the 165 Weston Road North bus of the Toronto Transit Commission bus system operating from York Mills station via Wilson station. The park has two public entrances and one entrance for staff, deliveries, and buses. On the north side of the park, there is a small bus terminal, which serves a seasonal bus route operated by York Region Transit. A new, larger bus terminal is currently under construction that is intended for year-round use.

===Areas===
The park has several themed areas. The five original sections include International Street, Medieval Faire, Grande World Exposition of 1890 (renamed Action Zone; Grande World Exposition of 1890 returned in 2019 by renaming a portion of Action Zone), International Festival, and the Happyland of Hanna-Barbera (divided into more than one children&#x27;s area since 1998). The current areas include the original sections stated above, Splash Works (1992), Action Zone (2002), and two children&#x27;s areas: Kidzville (1998), and Planet Snoopy (2010). In 2019, the park introduced a new themed area, &quot;Frontier Canada&quot;, a gold-rush-themed section originally planned for the park&#x27;s original opening in 1981, but was postponed until 2019 due to financial issues.

====Action Zone====
Action Zone was created as a subsection within the Grande World Exposition of 1890 section of the park in 2002. However, the entire Grande Exposition section was renamed Action Zone in 2009. In 2019, the park split Action Zone into two sections, with its eastern portion of Action Zone reverting its theme and name to The Grande Exposition of 1890.

====Frontier Canada====
Frontier Canada is the newest themed section of the park, debuting for the 2019 season. The section consolidates most of the park&#x27;s Canadian themed rides; as well as an area of the park formerly known as White Water Canyon, which operated from 1984 to 2018. The area is themed after a boom town found during the time of the Klondike Gold Rush, with most of its inspiration coming from Dawson City, Yukon, and its surrounding area.

====Grande World Exposition of 1890====

The Grande World Exposition of 1890 is one of the original four themed areas of Wonderland. It was made to resemble a late 19th century world&#x27;s fair with expositions from different countries with a particular focus on African and Asian themes. The restaurants and washrooms were formerly true to the exposition theme. One of the restaurants was called Ginza Gardens (now The Backlot Cafe) and had a Japanese theme and a Japanese façade. There is also an arcade area (Crystal Palace Arcade) within this section of the park.

In 2009, the entire Grande Exposition section was incorporated in Action Zone, an area of the park that formerly operated as a themed subsection of the Grande Exposition. The section operated as a part of Action Zone until 2019, when the eastern portion of Action Zone reverted to its original name and world fair theming.
====International Festival====
International Festival is located in the northeast section of the park. It includes rides, midway games and a mild Alpen theme, which will be expanded in 2025 upon opening AlpenFury.


====International Street====

International Street is the park&#x27;s entry area, similar to the Main Street, U.S.A. sections of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. Using a format borrowed from sister parks Kings Island and Kings Dominion, both sides of the street are lined with shops, including souvenir shops, clothing stores, restaurants, and candy stores. Unlike the use of replica Eiffel Towers at Kings Island and Kings Dominion, Wonder Mountain, the park&#x27;s centrepiece, appears at the end of the street. In the early decades of the park&#x27;s history, stores sold high-quality imported goods themed to the buildings, and restaurants sold food and beverages from non-North American culinary traditions, such as shrimp, paella, and smoked sausage. The buildings are named the Latin, Scandinavian, Mediterranean, and Alpine Buildings.

International Street has hosted to a number of shows presented at the park, including:


====Medieval Faire====

The Medieval Faire section of the park has a medieval European theme in both the setting and the rides. The two original roller coasters, Wilde Beast and Dragon Fyre, use pseudo-Elizabethan English spellings before being renamed using modern spelling (Wild Beast and Dragon Fire) from 1998 to 2018. Many of the original names of some the attractions have reverted to their pseudo-Elizabethan spelling, such as &quot;Dragon Fyre&quot;, &quot;Wilde Beast&quot;, &quot;Wilde KnightMares&quot;, &quot;Viking&#x27;s Rage&quot;, and &quot;Canterbury Theatre&quot;. These renames occurred prior to the beginning of the 2019 season.

The stores, midway games and restaurants follow the medieval theme, as does the castle theatre (Canterbury Theatre, renamed Paramount Theatre during Paramount&#x27;s ownership, and Wonderland Theatre until 2019) and a pirate show (originally opened with the park as Sea Sceptre and later replaced with Kinet-X Dive Show) in the middle of Arthur&#x27;s Baye. However, rides such as Drop Tower, Riptide, Spinovator, and Speed City Raceway have no medieval theme.

Canterbury Theatre hosted ice shows from 2006 to 2011 and hosted Cirque Ambiente in mid-2012 and mid-2013.


====Children&#x27;s areas====
There are presently two children&#x27;s areas at Canada&#x27;s Wonderland, KidZville, and Planet Snoopy. A third themed area known as Zoom Zone also exists as a part of KidZville section.

The children&#x27;s areas in Canada&#x27;s Wonderland originally were themed as The Happyland of Hanna-Barbera. The three areas were themed as Yogi&#x27;s Woods, Scoobyville, and Bedrock; the first was converted to Smurf Village in 1984 and the last also had a marine mammal show held at the Bedrock Aquarium. In 1993, the Smurf area transitioned to Kids Kingdom, which became KidZville in 1998. In 2003, Bedrock became Nickelodeon Central; Bedrock Aquarium and its marine mammal show closed down as well. The park replaced Nickelodeon Central and Hanna Barbera Land with Planet Snoopy for the 2010 season, standardizing the park with the rest of the Cedar Fair chain. Planet Snoopy is a section of the park themed after the comic strip &quot;Peanuts&quot;.

The Zoom Zone subsection of KidZville was created in 2001 with the debut of Silver Streak; it also contains the small rides Blast Off and Jumpin&#x27; Jet. One of the KidZville rides, and originally a Kids Kingdom ride, Jumbo Bumps, was removed to make way for these three rides and the new section. Starting in 2004, Zoom Zone was no longer shown on park maps as an independent section. However, since Cedar Fair&#x27;s acquisition, each of the three rides are depicted in Zoom Zone, and park signage continues to use the name.

The first ride accident in the park&#x27;s history occurred on 23 August 2003, when the Jimmy Neutron Brainwasher (later renamed Woodstock Whirlybirds due to Cedar Fair&#x27;s contract with &quot;Peanuts&quot;) fell apart. Three children were sent to hospital as a precautionary measure.

Rides located within these children&#x27;s areas include:


====Splash Works====

Opened in 1992, Splash Works is an water park. The water park is home to Whitewater Bay, the largest outdoor wave pool in Canada, and 16 water slides. It is included with the price of admission to Canada&#x27;s Wonderland and is open from late May to early September.

==Priority queuing==

Fast Lane is Canada&#x27;s Wonderland&#x27;s two-line system since 2012, which is also implemented at other Six Flags parks. For an additional cost (in addition to normal admission charges), visitors receive a wrist band that enables them to bypass the &#x27;normal-wait&#x27; line and enter the Fast Lane. Opting for this benefit essentially allows purchasers to cut in at the front of the line on 21 of the most popular attractions without waiting. In 2013, the park introduced Fast Lane Plus, which allowed purchasers to bypass the lines of two additional attractions (later three with the addition of Yukon Striker in 2019) that standard Fast Lane users would otherwise not have access to. An unspecified limited amount of both types of passes are sold each day.

===Boarding pass for guests with disabilities===
Similar accommodations are given to guests with restricted mobility issues and guests with cognitive impairments. Guests with these disabilities receive paper boarding passes in which ride operators provide wait times equal to those in the queue. These guests enter at the ride&#x27;s exit. Boarding passes are not valid at any upcharge attraction (SlingShot and Speed City Raceway). Lazy River is the only attraction in Splash Works that accepts boarding passes.

==Timeline==
Today, Canada&#x27;s Wonderland has over 200 attractions (including games), with over 60 thrill rides. The park holds a number of Canadian records, among them the most roller coasters, with 17. The park encompasses eight themed areas on of land, with an artificial mountain as the central feature. In the southwestern quadrant, an waterpark called Splash Works has over of heated water, Canada&#x27;s largest outdoor wave pool, measuring , a lazy river, and 16 water slides.

In 1983, Canada&#x27;s Wonderland added the Kingswood Music Theatre, a 15,000 seat amphitheatre that has hosted many concerts. After the Budweiser Stage (then known as Molson Amphitheatre) opened on the grounds of Ontario Place in 1995, itself replacing The Forum, cultural festivals at the theatre became less prominent.

==Logos==
The park, from its opening in 1981, was known as Canada&#x27;s Wonderland. In 1994, when Paramount Pictures (later Viacom) purchased the property, the name of the park changed to include the word Paramount, a practice Paramount Parks implemented with all of its parks in 1993. Prior to that, none of the Paramount-owned parks included Paramount in the name.

In 2003, Viacom updated the logo of Paramount Parks, and all its theme parks, including Wonderland, to include an updated Paramount logo, even though the logo for Paramount Pictures, the film studio, remained unchanged.

In 2006, CBS Corporation (split from Viacom in 2005) sold all of its theme park properties to Cedar Fair, which in turn, dropped the Paramount prefixes from all five parks (and thus reverted to their original names), and adopted a Cedar Fair logo and typeface. The logo and typeface have been retained even after Cedar Fair merged with Six Flags in 2024.

==In popular culture==
The park was the location used in &quot;The Littlest Hobo&quot; episode &quot;Forget Me Not&quot; aired March 4, 1982.

<text>Milton Academy (informally referred to as Milton) is a co-educational, independent, and college-preparatory boarding and day school in Milton, Massachusetts, educating students in grades K–12. The Lower School (grades K–8) educates day students and the Upper School (grades 9–12) educates a roughly even mixture of boarding and day students.

Milton&#x27;s list of notable alumni includes Nobel laureate T. S. Eliot, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy, and Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick.

== History ==
=== Early years ===
Milton Academy was founded by Edward Hutchinson Robbins, the speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, after the General Court of Massachusetts set up a committee to study options for secondary education for residents of Norfolk County. Although the committee considered putting the academy in Braintree, Roxbury, Quincy, Dorchester, and Milton, it chose Milton; Speaker Robbins was a Milton resident. Other founding members of the board of trustees included Fisher Ames, Nathanel Emmons, Thaddeus Mason Harris, Joseph McKean, and Ebenezer Thayer.

According to the official town history, the early Milton Academy, like many other old New England academies, was initially &quot;a state-chartered and partially subsidized institution which, in effect, served as a county high school.&quot; In March 1798, the Massachusetts legislature granted the academy a corporate charter and a state-funded endowment (three square miles of land in Maine). However, the academy did not actually open for business until 1807, due to protracted disputes about whether the campus should be located in the center or outskirts of town. In 1807, the academy opened in the center of town with 23 students. Most students were locals, although some out-of-town students boarded with local families.

Few records of the early academy survive. Alumni of the early academy include Major General Edwin Vose Sumner, who commanded Union troops at Antietam and Fredericksburg.

In 1866, the town of Milton effectively bought out the first Milton Academy. It opened Milton High School, a tax-funded, tuition-free public school, and hired the academy&#x27;s principal to lead it. In response, the academy&#x27;s board of trustees shut down the academy and sold the campus to the public school. From 1866 to 1884, Milton Academy survived as a paper entity, with a board of trustees but no teachers, students, or campus.

=== Refounding as college-preparatory private school ===

In 1879, at the urging of Harvard president Charles Eliot, Milton Academy&#x27;s board began preparations to re-establish the academy as a fully private school. This was accomplished in 1884, when Milton resident and railroad magnate John Murray Forbes re-established Milton Academy on a new 125-acre site. The academy claims the history of the 1798 institution, and celebrated its 150th anniversary in 1948.

Milton Academy re-opened in September 1885 with four teachers and roughly 40 day students. John Forbes&#x27; son William H. Forbes (president of Bell Telephone Company, the predecessor of AT&amp;T) was elected president of the board of trustees. The academy reopened its boarding department in 1888. Although Milton originally educated both boys and girls, in 1901 the Upper School divided into separate boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; divisions, each with its own faculty and campus. The boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; schools reunited in 1981.

The new Milton attracted an affluent clientele and became a notable college-preparatory institution. From 1906 to 1915, Milton sent 179 students to Harvard College, making it Harvard&#x27;s fifth-largest feeder school, after Boston Latin, Phillips Exeter, Cambridge Latin, and Nobles. In 1996, 33% of Milton graduates went on to Ivy League colleges, second-highest among New England boarding schools. In 2002, Harvard&#x27;s student newspaper reported that in some years Milton has produced as many as 25% of the students admitted to Harvard through the so-called &quot;Z-list,&quot; a set of students who are promised admission to Harvard after taking a gap year; students on the Z-list often have legacy connections to Harvard.

Although Milton was nonsectarian, it traditionally educated large numbers of Unitarian students, in contrast to the many Protestant Episcopalian boarding schools founded at the turn of the 20th century. (In the nineteenth century, the town of Milton was one of the few towns in Massachusetts where Unitarians may have outnumbered trinitarians.) Unitarian Miltonians include poet T. S. Eliot (who later converted to Episcopalianism) and architect Buckminster Fuller. In 1901, several Milton friends and alumni (including William Forbes&#x27;s son Cameron and Milton trustee Norwood Penrose Hallowell) helped establish Middlesex School, another formally nonsectarian prep school with a large and wealthy Unitarian clientele. Some prominent Catholics were also drawn to Milton&#x27;s relative lack of Protestant influence. Robert F. Kennedy attended Milton after Rose Kennedy withdrew him from St. Paul&#x27;s (due to what she believed was SPS&#x27; anti-Catholic atmosphere), and his brother Ted also went to Milton.

In November 1948, T. S. Eliot &#x27;06 visited Milton to give a lecture to the students; during this visit, he learned that he had won the Nobel Prize. Academic Richard Livingstone spoke at Milton&#x27;s 150th anniversary celebration; his talk was published, in abridged form, in the November issue of &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;. Other notable guest speakers include Scottish statesman John Buchan, the politicians Newton D. Baker and Franklin D. Roosevelt, and the diplomat Sumner Welles.

=== Recent years ===
In 1984, Milton purchased the Mountain School, a 418-acre campus and working farm in Vershire, Vermont. Milton operates the Mountain School of Milton Academy as a semester-long program for high school students from around the country. In 2022, author and educator Alex Myers was appointed as director of the program.

In 1991, Milton appointed Needham High School president Edwin P. Fredie as headmaster. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, this made Milton &quot;the first major American boarding school with a black headmaster.&quot; Fredie served until 1999 and was succeeded by Milton&#x27;s first female headmaster, Robin Robertson, who served until 2007.

From 2015 to 2020, Milton conducted a $182 million fundraising campaign, which included $48 million for student financial aid and funded upgrades to Milton&#x27;s science, art, drama, and athletic facilities.

== Admissions and student body ==

=== Admissions ===
In the 2022–23 school year, Milton&#x27;s Upper School accepted 13% of applicants for approximately 140 openings. Graduates of the Lower School are automatically accepted to the Upper School.

In a typical year, the Upper School enrolls 100 freshmen, 25 incoming sophomores, and 15 incoming juniors. The Lower School enrolls 24 kindergarteners, 8 incoming fourth-graders, 13 incoming sixth-graders, and 10 incoming seventh-graders.

=== Composition ===
In the 2023–24 school year, the Upper School educated 717 students, of whom 316 (45%) were boarders. 52% of Upper Schoolers identified as students of color. Milton has an unusually small contingent of American boarding students by New England prep school standards, as boarders are a minority of the student body and just under half of Milton&#x27;s boarders (19%) are international students.

In the 2021–22 school year, the Lower School educated 317 students.

== Finances ==

=== Tuition and financial aid ===
In the 2023–24 school year, Milton&#x27;s Upper School charged boarding students $73,950 and day students $63,950. 35% of students were on financial aid, and the average financial aid grant covered 75% of tuition.

In the same year, tuition at the Lower School ranged from $42,950 for kindergarteners to $62,550 for middle schoolers.

=== Endowment and expenses ===
Milton&#x27;s financial endowment stood at $408 million as of June 30, 2021. In its Internal Revenue Service filings for the 2021–22 school year, Milton reported total assets of $483.5 million, net assets of $411.8 million, investment holdings of $394.2 million, and cash holdings of $7.8 million. Milton also reported $65.4 million in program service expenses and $16.2 million in grants (primarily student financial aid).

== Athletics ==

=== Overview ===
Milton offers 15 interscholastic sports for both boys and girls each, as well as seven intramural teams. Its athletic teams compete in the Independent School League and the New England Schools Sailing Association division of the Interscholastic Sailing Association.

Milton&#x27;s athletics rival is the Noble and Greenough School of Dedham (colloquially &quot;Nobles&quot;). The two schools began playing an annual football game in 1886, and contest the fifth-oldest high school football rivalry in the United States. In 2020, Milton and Nobles were the two largest feeders to Harvard&#x27;s varsity athletic teams; Milton supplied nine Harvard athletes and Nobles supplied fifteen.

=== Notable teams ===

* Tennis. From 1998 to 2004, Herb Chennel&#x27;s boys&#x27; tennis team went 74-1 and captured six ISL championships and six New England championships. More than 10 players from those teams went on to Division I tennis careers.
* Sailing. The coed sailing team won two national championships in 1998 and 2002—one in team racing and one in fleet racing. It also won the team racing world championship in 2015.
* Hockey. Milton&#x27;s boys&#x27; hockey team has had several players go on to successful professional careers, most notably 12-year NHLer Marty McInnis and 2023 Calder Memorial Trophy winner Matty Beniers. In 2011, the Milton boys&#x27; hockey team won the New England Preparatory School Athletic Council (NEPSAC) championship; it also finished second in 2016.

==Sexual assaults==
In February 2017, the academy announced the results of a nine-month sexual misconduct investigation by T&amp;M Protection Resources. The firm interviewed 60 alumni, parents, current and former staff and came to the conclusion that four former employees had engaged in illegal sexual conduct with students in the 1970s and 80s. The most egregious abuse came from a drama teacher named Reynold Buono who had abused at least 12 male students between 1975 and 1987, when Milton fired him. After extradition from Thailand, Buono was indicted by the Norfolk County District Attorney. Following an appeal to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, Buono pleaded guilty to two counts of rape of a child with force in 2022.

In 2005, the school expelled five members of the boys&#x27; varsity ice hockey team for obtaining oral sex from a 15-year-old female student on three separate occasions. Following an investigation by the Norfolk County District Attorney, all five expelled students were indicted for statutory rape. The DA dropped the charges against the three older students in exchange for an apology, 100 hours of community service, and two years of probation. (The two younger students were indicted in juvenile court, where fewer details are disclosed to the public.) The female student was placed on administrative leave and eventually transferred to a different school. One of the expelled students later sued the academy, but his suit was dismissed in 2007. Two Milton graduates used this story as the inspiration for a book, which was later adapted into a movie.

<text>The 74th (Yeomanry) Division was a Territorial Force infantry division formed in Palestine in early 1917 from three dismounted yeomanry brigades. It served in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the First World War, mostly as part of XX Corps. In May 1918 it was sent to the Western Front where it remained until the end of the war.

The division&#x27;s insignia was a broken spur to signify that its units were once mounted but now served as infantry.

==History==
===Formation===
On 14 January 1917, Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) Order No. 26 instructed that the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Dismounted Brigades (then with the Suez Canal Defences) be reorganized as the 229th, 230th and 231st Brigades.

On 23 February 1917, Lieutenant General Sir Archibald Murray, the General Officer Commanding EEF, sought permission from the War Office to form the 229th, 230th and 231st Brigades into a new division. On 25 February, the War Office granted permission and the new 74th (Yeomanry) Division started to form. It was acknowledged that it would take some time for artillery, engineers and auxiliary services to complete the division.

The division began to assemble from 4 March at el Arish. The 229th Brigade joined at el Arish by 9 March, the 231st Brigade joined at Khan Yunis by 6 April and the 230th Brigade joined by 13 April at Deir el Balah. The other divisional units (cavalry squadron, engineer field companies, veterinary section, and the train), had joined by April. The artillery did not become a part of the division until July and August (after the division had already fought in the Second Battle of Gaza).

===Palestine 1917–18===
The 74th Division took part in the invasion of Palestine in 1917 and 1918.

The division was not fully formed when it participated in the Second Battle of Gaza between 17 and 19 April 1917. It acted as reserve to the Eastern Force and was not engaged. Thereafter, the division was assigned to XX Corps where it remained for the rest of its time in Palestine.

In October and November 1917, the division took part in the Third Battle of Gaza (including the capture of Beersheba on 31 October and the Sheria Position on 6 November). At the end of 1917, it took part in the capture and defence of Jerusalem and in March 1918 in the Battle of Tell &#x27;Asur. On 3 April 1918, the division was warned that it would move to France and by 30 April 1918 had completed embarkation at Alexandria.

Before departure for France, the 4th (of 229th Brigade), 209th (of 230th Brigade), 210th (of 231st Brigade) and 261st MG Companies formed 74th Battalion, Machine Gun Corps. It concentrated at Alexandria between 17 and 30 April and departed for France with the division on the latter date.

The artillery was also restructured in March and April 1918 before departing for France. On 21 March, &#x27;A&#x27; Battery of CCLXVIII Brigade, RFA (A/CCLXVIII) returned to 60th (2/2nd London) Division where it resumed its original identity as B/CCCI. It was replaced by 425 Battery which was redesignated A/CCLXVIII. Then, between 11 and 21 April, the artillery was reorganized as two brigades at Lydda:
Each brigade now consisted of three batteries of six 18-pounders and a battery of four 4.5&quot; howitzers. Each of the howitzer batteries were later made up to six 4.5&quot; howitzers in France (on 21 May 1918 at Noulette).

===France and Flanders 1918===
In May 1918, the 74th (Yeomanry) Division landed at Marseilles, France. It served in France and Flanders for the rest of the war. By 18 May, the division had concentrated around Rue in the Abbeville area. Here the dismounted Yeomanry underwent training for service on the Western Front, particularly gas defence.

Due to a lack of replacements, British infantry divisions on the Western Front had been reduced from 12 to nine battalions in January and February 1918. To conform with this new structure, on 21 June, 12th Royal Scots Fusiliers (of 229th Brigade), 12th Norfolk Regiment (of 230th Brigade) and 24th Royal Welsh Fusiliers (of 231st Brigade) left the 74th (Yeomanry) Division. They were used to reconstitute 94th Brigade of 31st Division which was renamed the 94th (Yeomanry) Brigade on that date. On 16 May, the Pioneer Battalion, 1/12 Loyal North Lancashire Regiment, was reduced from a 4-company to a 3-company organization.

On 14 July 1918 the 74th (Yeomanry) Division went into the line for the first time, near Merville on the right of XI Corps. From September 1918, as part of III Corps of Fourth Army, it took part in the Hundred Days Offensive including the Second Battle of the Somme (Second Battle of Bapaume) and the Battles of the Hindenburg Line (Battle of Épehy). In October and November 1918, it took part in the &#x27;Final Advance&#x27; on Artois and Flanders. By the Armistice it was in the area of Tournai, Belgium.

With the end of the war, the troops of 74th Division were engaged in railway repair work and education was undertaken while demobilisation began. The division and its subformations were disbanded on 10 July 1919.

==Commanders==
74th (Yeomanry) Division was commanded throughout its existence by Major General E.S. Girdwood.

<text>The Posavina Canton (; Serbian and ; ) is one of ten cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is the smallest canton with an area of only . The canton is an exclave of Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, being bordered by Republika Srpska and Brčko District to the south and the river Sava and Croatia to the north. Its capital is Orašje and the largest town is Odžak.

== History ==
The Posavina area was inhabited since prehistoric times, as evidenced by various archaeological finds of coins and other artifacts. After the 1718 Treaty of Passarowitz between the Ottoman Empire and Habsburg monarchy, mostly Catholic families from mountain villages were displaced across the plains, as the Turks themselves settled in the hills and valleys. The Croats from Županja, Babina Greda and Štitar moved to the villages of Kopanice, Vidovice, Tolisa and Domaljevac.

The current municipalities of Derventa and Bosanski Brod were settled by people from Herzegovina between the years 1735 and 1782, and once again in a minor wave in 1820. Since 1697, approximately 20,000 Catholics emigrated from the area. Most of the people emigrated to the municipalities of Modriča, Gradačac, Orašje, Bosanski Šamac and Brčko from Mostar, Posušje, Uskoplje, Bugojno, Livno and Duvno.

Before the Bosnian War, the present-day municipalities of Donji Žabar and Vukosavlje belonged to Odžak and Orašje, while the present-day municipality of Domaljevac-Šamac belonged to Bosanski Šamac. The history of today&#x27;s canton begins on March 18, 1994, with the signing of the Washington Agreement. Posavina Canton was officially established on June 12, 1996 as one of the ten cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, one of the 3 Croat-majority cantons.

== Politics and government ==
According to the law, Posavina Canton is one of the ten cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is one of the two entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Posavina has its own legislative, executive and judicial powers. Like each of the cantons of FBiH, Canton Posavina has its own constitution, assembly, government, symbols and has a number of exclusive competences (police, education, use of natural resources, spatial and housing policy, culture), while some competences are divided between federal and cantonal authorities (health, social protection, transport). The seat of the executive power, i.e. the capital of the canton, is Orašje (Posavina Cantonal Government), while in Domaljevac is the seat of the legislative power (Posavina Cantonal Assembly) and in Odžak is the seat of the judiciary.

Every four years, the citizens of Canton Posavina vote in general elections for a total of 21 deputies in the Assembly of Canton Posavina. Based on the general elections, the current KP government is formed by a coalition between the Party of Democratic Action (SDA), the coalition of the Croatian Democratic Union of Bosnia and Herzegovina (HDZ BiH) and the Croatian Party of the Rights of Bosnia and Herzegovina. (HSP BiH).

At the local level, the citizens of Posavina Canton vote for the government in three municipalities every four years in free elections.

The cantonal assembly is composed of:
*Croatian Democratic Union, HSS BiH, HKDU BiH – 11
*Croatian Democratic Union 1990 – 3
*Party of Democratic Action – 2
*Posavina Party – 2
*Social Democratic Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina – 1
*Union for a Better Future of BiH – 1
*Movement of Democratic Action – 1

==Geography==
The canton lies near the border with Croatia and near the river Sava which forms a natural border between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. The canton consist of two unconnected exclaves: the western one consisting of Odžak municipality and the eastern one consisting of Orašje and Domaljevac-Šamac municipalities.

Posavina is a region which includes other parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina and parts of Croatia. Because of that, this canton is sometimes called Bosanska Posavina (Bosnian Posavina) and is the only part of northern Bosnia near the border with Croatia that lies in the Federation. The rest of northern Bosnia near the river Sava and near the border is the Brčko District and the Republika Srpska. The Brčko district divides Republika Srpska into 2 parts.

The Posavina canton&#x27;s position near the Sava river makes it a good place for agriculture because it is a flat lowland and there are no mountains in the area. It is like this in the entire northern border with Croatia, with a great deal of farming and agriculture. The river Sava is a river that flows through Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia. In Bosnia and Herzegovina it flows through the northern border and makes a natural border between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia.

Posavina means literally along Sava in the Bosnian language. The river Sava is the largest navigable river in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Much of the food in both Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia comes from this region, not only Bosnian Posavina but the rest of the fertile fields along the river Sava.

===Municipalities===
The canton consists of the municipalities of Domaljevac-Šamac, Odžak, and Orašje.

<text>Donationware is a licensing model that supplies fully operational unrestricted software to the user and requests an optional donation be paid to the programmer or a third-party beneficiary (usually a non-profit). The amount of the donation may also be stipulated by the author, or it may be left to the discretion of the user, based on individual perceptions of the software&#x27;s value. Since donationware comes fully operational (i.e. not crippleware/freemium) when payment is optional, it is a type of freeware.

== History ==
An example of donationware is the 1987 Atari ST video game &quot;Ballerburg&quot;, whose programmer distributed the game for free but asked for a donation, offering as incentive the source code for the game. Red Ryder was a terminal emulation software program created for the Apple Macintosh in the 1980s that used donations to fund development..

About 150 people attended Wing Bowl I (held in a hotel) in 1993 to see a competition between two contestants. The event pitted competitive eaters in a Buffalo wing eating contest. The Wing Bowl was traditionally held on the Friday before the Super Bowl. The event, which began as a radio promotion, grew to encompass television, the Internet, and a contest for women who were termed &quot;the Wingettes.&quot;

From 2000 to 2018, the event was held at Philadelphia&#x27;s Wells Fargo Center, where they did live broadcasts on 94-WIP-FM. There were no television deals to broadcast the event live; however, a replay was usually shown on CW 57, Comcast SportsNet, or one of the other local stations within the following week. The Wing Bowl drew crowds of over 20,000.

The final Wing Bowl, Wing Bowl XXVI was held on February 2, 2018, and the winner was Molly Schuyler, who devoured a record 501 wings in a half hour.

==Background==
Wing Bowl was the brainchild of WIP radio host Al Morganti, who came up with the idea when it became apparent the Philadelphia Eagles were not going to make the Super Bowl anytime soon. It is also suggested that Morganti was fed up with the Buffalo Bills going to the Super Bowl and not winning. The first Wing Bowl was held in the lobby of the Wyndham Franklin Plaza Hotel in Center City. Carmen Cordero walked away with the inaugural title, receiving a hibachi as his prize.

Since then, media coverage has grown to the point where every one of the major Philadelphia television stations has covered the event. The ABC 6, CBS Channel 3 and Fox 29 affiliates all aired live reports from the event during their morning news. Features on the event have appeared in the &quot;Courier-Post&quot;, &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; and &quot;Daily News&quot; as well as a host of newspapers in the surrounding counties. The event has been featured on ESPN and the syndicated television shows &quot;Real TV&quot; and &quot;The Montel Williams Show&quot;. Segments on Wing Bowl have appeared on TV newscasts in cities throughout the country. Several Wing Bowl contestants, including &quot;El Wingador,&quot; competed in Fox&#x27;s &quot;Glutton Bowl&quot; in the spring of 2002. The 2007 Wing Bowl was carried on Comcast Cable&#x27;s On Demand channel.

Then Mayor of Philadelphia and future Governor of Pennsylvania Ed Rendell attended Wing Bowls II, III, IV and VI, where he presented the winner with a &quot;Liberty Bell&quot; trophy. Other celebrities who have appeared include retired heavyweight boxer Randall &quot;Tex&quot; Cobb, former 76ers President Pat Croce, former Phillies manager Larry Bowa, U.S. Senator Arlen Specter, and others. Major-league umpire Eric Gregg served as the &quot;Commissioner&quot; of Wing Bowl from its second year until his death from a stroke on 5 June 2006. From December 2006 to 2013, Pat Croce was the second commissioner. Jon Dorenbos served as the last commissioner from 2014, and served the final 5 editions.

==Qualifications==
(As per Wing Bowl Commissioner Jon Dorenbos)
Entry into Wing Bowl can be gained in two ways, the first of which is successfully performing an &quot;eating stunt&quot; on air during &quot;The Morning Show&quot; at the 94 WIP studios in Center City, Philadelphia, with Al Morganti as judge. Stunts have included eating 20 cups of cooked oatmeal, eating of creamed spinach with of hot sauce, and eating five Big Macs. The stunt must be completed within a time limit negotiated between the contestant and Morganti. Morganti, known to be a tough judge, has disallowed stunts that involved what he considers &quot;cheating&quot;, such as dipping bread into a beverage to make it easier to swallow, or breaking up a food item into constituent parts for easier chewing (such as separating hot dogs from their buns). He is also tough on contestants who suggest a stunt involving liquid consumption; &quot;The Morning Show&quot; hosts prefer eating stunts over drinking stunts. If a person offers to perform a drinking stunt, it must be compelling to the hosts, such as Wing Bowl XIV champion Joey Chestnut&#x27;s offer to drink of milk. The hosts deemed it not difficult enough, but, fortunately for Chestnut, former champion Bill &quot;El Wingador&quot; Simmons was present and declared the stunt to have a high level of difficulty, upon which the hosts accepted his offer, with a five-minute time limit to complete the challenge.

The other way to gain entry to Wing Bowl is to win a &quot;Wingoff.&quot; A &quot;Wingoff&quot; is a 10-minute eating contest held at a Philadelphia or South Jersey bar hosted by former Philadelphia Eagle and WIP Host Hugh Douglas and WIP Personality Marc Farzetta. The &quot;Wingoffs&quot; began in 2005 when 610 WIP decided to spoof the Big 5 Philadelphia area universities basketball teams. The winner of these &quot;Wingoffs&quot; gain automatic entry into the Wing Bowl.

==Cancellation==
WIP announced on October 30, 2018, that event was being canceled after 26 years because the time for doing so felt right after the Eagles won Super Bowl LII. According to WIP program director Spike Eskin, &quot;When Wing Bowl started ... a large part of it was the lead-up to the Super Bowl never involved the Eagles. We just wanted to get to the promised land.&quot;

<doc id="494012" wikidata="Q7979585" url="?curid=494012" title="Weeping Tile (band)">
<text>Weeping Tile was a Canadian rock band formed in 1992 in Kingston, Ontario.

==History==
The band was started by singer-songwriter Sarah Harmer in 1992, when she was invited to fill in for the opening band at a Thomas Trio and the Red Albino concert in Ottawa, Ontario. Taking the name Weeping Tile from the pipes that are placed around the foundations of homes to draw groundwater away from the building, she did the show as a duo with Joe Chithalen on bass, and later added other musicians, Gord Tough on guitar and Chris Smirnios on drums, to round out the lineup.

The band released a seven-song debut cassette in 1994, and was quickly signed to a major label. That cassette was re-released in 1995 with the title &quot;Eepee&quot;, and in 1996 they released &quot;Cold Snap&quot;, their first full-length album.

Between &quot;Eepee&quot; and &quot;Cold Snap&quot;, the band&#x27;s line-up changed almost completely, leaving Harmer as the only original member. Chithalen was replaced by Harmer&#x27;s sister Mary, Tough was replaced by Luther Wright, and Smirnios was replaced by Cam Giroux. Upon the departure of Mary Harmer, Spin the Susan alumnus Rebecca Henderson (a.k.a. Sticky) was brought in on bass guitar. Her presence led to the formation of The Wadds, an alter-ego band which would perform after the Weeping Tile set was completed, usually with the musicians switching instruments. This gave Harmer the opportunity to demonstrate her versatility on the drums, and showcased Sticky as a bandleader and singer. Some live recordings of these performances are extant. The Wadds also recorded five songs but they were never released.

In 1997, they released their follow-up album, &quot;Valentino&quot;. Although they were a popular draw on the live music circuit and a regular presence on campus radio, Weeping Tile never broke through to mainstream success, and in 1998 they were dropped from their record label. Later that year they recorded another independent cassette, &quot;This Great Black Night&quot;, but shortly afterward the band broke up.

According to Harmer, &quot;We were never a super ambitious commercial band. We just did our thing and we were lucky to be able to get people to hear our music. It was a great situation, but it wasn&#x27;t economical for [Warner]. When we got dropped, it was freeing, it was good.&quot; She attributes the band&#x27;s breakup soon afterward to interpersonal dynamics rather than being dropped from the label.

==Post-breakup activities==

Sticky partnered with Merrill Nisker in a live project called The Shit, and later started a group called Ass Machine. The latter group released three independent albums and was locally notorious for its on-stage aggressiveness, but no record deals ensued, despite having received media attention as a band worth watching during the 1999 NXNE Festival. Sticky later played bass with the bands Music Maul and Velvet Claws, and released the solo album &quot;Life on the Sideboard&quot; in 2013.

Harmer covered &quot;Silverado&quot;, a song by Music Maul&#x27;s Trevor Henderson, on her 2010 solo album &quot;Oh Little Fire&quot;.

Harmer went on to success as a solo artist, and Wright&#x27;s new band, Luther Wright and the Wrongs, have made six albums to date and attracted considerable attention with their 2001 release &quot;Rebuild the Wall&quot;, a country music interpretation of Pink Floyd&#x27;s album &quot;The Wall&quot;.

Although Weeping Tile have not recorded a new album as a group since the breakup, they still play together on stage in Kingston, and sometimes perform on each other&#x27;s solo recordings. They also recorded a cover of Rheostatics&#x27; &quot;Public Square&quot; for the 2007 tribute album &quot;The Secret Sessions&quot;, with both Wright and Harmer sharing vocal duties.

<text>A hexagonal number is a figurate number. The &quot;n&quot;th hexagonal number &quot;h&quot;&quot;n&quot; is the number of &quot;distinct&quot; dots in a pattern of dots consisting of the &quot;outlines&quot; of regular hexagons with sides up to n dots, when the hexagons are overlaid so that they share one vertex.

The formula for the &quot;n&quot;th hexagonal number

:formula_1

The first few hexagonal numbers are:

:1, 6, 15, 28, 45, 66, 91, 120, 153, 190, 231, 276, 325, 378, 435, 496, 561, 630, 703, 780, 861, 946...

Every hexagonal number is a triangular number, but only every &quot;other&quot; triangular number (the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, etc.) is a hexagonal number. Like a triangular number, the digital root in base 10 of a hexagonal number can only be 1, 3, 6, or 9. The digital root pattern, repeating every nine terms, is &quot;1 6 6 1 9 3 1 3 9&quot;.

Every even perfect number is hexagonal, given by the formula 
:formula_2
:where &quot;M&quot;&quot;p&quot; is a Mersenne prime. No odd perfect numbers are known, hence all known perfect numbers are hexagonal.
:For example, the 2nd hexagonal number is 2×3 = 6; the 4th is 4×7 = 28; the 16th is 16×31 = 496; and the 64th is 64×127 = 8128.

The largest number that cannot be written as a sum of at most four hexagonal numbers is 130. Adrien-Marie Legendre proved in 1830 that any integer greater than 1791 can be expressed in this way.

In addition, only two integers cannot be expressed using five hexagonal numbers (but can be with six), those being 11 and 26.

Hexagonal numbers should not be confused with centered hexagonal numbers, which model the standard packaging of Vienna sausages. To avoid ambiguity, hexagonal numbers are sometimes called &quot;cornered hexagonal numbers&quot;.

==Test for hexagonal numbers==
One can efficiently test whether a positive integer &quot;x&quot; is a hexagonal number by computing

:formula_3

If &quot;n&quot; is an integer, then &quot;x&quot; is the &quot;n&quot;th hexagonal number. If &quot;n&quot; is not an integer, then &quot;x&quot; is not hexagonal.

==Congruence relations==
* formula_4
* formula_5

==Other properties==
===Expression using sigma notation===
The &quot;n&quot;th number of the hexagonal sequence can also be expressed by using sigma notation as

:formula_6

where the empty sum is taken to be 0.

===Sum of the reciprocal hexagonal numbers===
The sum of the reciprocal hexagonal numbers is , where denotes natural logarithm.
:formula_7

===Multiplying the index===
Using rearrangement, the next set of formulas is given:
formula_8

formula_9

formula_10

formula_11

===Ratio relation===
Using the final formula from before with respect to &quot;m&quot; and then &quot;n&quot;, and then some reducing and moving, one can get to the following equation:

formula_12

===Numbers of divisors of powers of certain natural numbers===
formula_13 for &quot;n&quot;&gt;0 has formula_14 divisors.

Likewise, for any natural number of the form formula_15 where &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are distinct prime numbers, formula_16 for &quot;n&quot;&gt;0 has formula_14 divisors.

&quot;Proof.&quot; formula_18
has divisors of the form formula_19, for &quot;k&quot; = 0 ... 2(&quot;n&quot; − 1), &quot;l&quot; = 0 ... n − 1. Each combination of &quot;k&quot; and &quot;l&quot; yields a distinct divisor, so formula_20 has formula_21 divisors, i.e. formula_22 divisors. ∎

== Hexagonal square numbers==

The sequence of numbers that are both hexagonal and perfect squares starts 1, 1225, 1413721... .

<doc id="494015" wikidata="Q3074924" url="?curid=494015" title="Fokker XA-7">
<text>The Fokker XA-7 was a prototype attack aircraft ordered in December 1929, and first flown in January 1931 by Fokker and then General Aviation Corporation after it bought Fokker-America in 1930, and entered in a competition held by the United States Army. However, the Curtiss A-8 won the competition, and A-7 development was not continued.

==Design and development==
The XA-7 was a two-seat low-wing all-metal monoplane design. It featured a thick cantilever wing, tunnel radiator and two closely spaced open cockpits.

Despite some innovative features, the XA-7 did not proceed past flight test status. After testing, the sole prototype was scrapped.

<doc id="494018" wikidata="Q6422975" url="?curid=494018" title="Knole Settee">
<text>The original Knole Settee (also known as the Knole Sofa) is a couch chair made in the 17th century, probably around 1640. It is housed at Knole in Kent, a house owned by the Sackville-West family since 1605 but now in the care of the National Trust.

It was originally used not as a comfortable sofa but as a formal throne-like seat on which an aristocrat or monarch would have sat to receive visitors. It was wide enough that a monarch and consort could be seated side by side. , it is kept at Knole House in a transparent case.

Modern versions of the design are marketed as &quot;Knole settees&quot; or &quot;Knole sofas&quot;. They feature adjustable side arms and considerable depth of seating and usually have exposed wooden finials atop the rear corners, and some exposed wood may be present on the arms. The arms, more correctly sides, are the same height as the back. The side arms are tied to the sofa back using a heavy decorative braid, often with an elaborate tassel, looped around the finials on the arms and back.

==Etymology and history==

The name of the sofa is spelled as &quot;Knole&quot; and not &quot;Knoll&quot;, and it has no relation to the Knoll furniture company. The sofa&#x27;s name derives from Knole House in Sevenoaks, Kent, which is open to the public and run by the National Trust. On display there is the original Knole Sofa, along with other pieces of matching seat furniture.

The exact date of the making of the &quot;Knole Sofa&quot; and its original patron is unclear. The sofa or couch may have been made for the royal family and brought to Knole sometime in the 17th or 18th century. It was probably originally described as a couch or couch chair. A London furniture maker and upholsterer, Ralph Grynder, made couches for Henrietta Maria in the 1630s, and these were supplied with suites of matching chairs and stools with a canopy suspended above. The inventories of English aristocrats also include similar suites. A portrait of Vere Egerton, Mrs William Booth, painted around 1619 at Dunham Massey, shows a red couch with a curtained canopy.

Some records show that couches or couch beds were brought to Knole from the London residence of the family, Dorset House, in 1624. These included a &quot;cooch of velvet laced with Crimsin silk &amp; gold Lace, six longe cushions suitable to it, four chairs suitable to it&quot;. It is unclear if this describes the surviving sofa or if the Knole Sofa is more like those made later by Ralph Grynder in the 1630s and 1640s. The exposed beech woodwork of the Knole Sofa has traces of original marbling and painted and gilded arabesque decoration. Thomas Capp was a specialist in painting furniture in this period who worked for Lionel Cranfield, 1st Earl of Middlesex, briefly a keeper of the Royal Wardrobe.

==In literature==
Some pieces of literature refer to the Knole sofa. For example, Derek Marlowe notes the usage in his 1968 book &quot;Memoirs of a Venus Lackey.&quot; In the 1962 novel &quot;In High Places&quot;, a Knole sofa is positioned in a room with a fine antique Kerman carpet.

<text>Peter John Snow (born 20 April 1938) is a British radio and television presenter and historian. Between 1969 and 2005, he was an analyst of general election results, first on ITV and later for the BBC. He presented &quot;Newsnight&quot; from its launch in 1980 until 1997. He has presented a number of documentaries, including some with his son, Dan Snow.

==Early life==
Snow was born in Dublin, the son of John FitzGerald Snow and Margaret Mary Pringle. He is the grandson of First World War general Sir Thomas D&#x27;Oyly Snow; first cousin of Jon Snow, the presenter of &quot;Channel 4 News&quot; from 1989 to 2021; nephew of schoolmaster and bishop George D&#x27;Oyly Snow; and brother-in-law of historian-writer Margaret MacMillan. He is the father of fellow TV presenter Dan Snow.

He spent part of his early childhood in Benghazi, Libya, where his father was stationed. His father became deputy Fortress commander at Gibraltar in 1956.

==Education==
Snow was educated at Wellington College, an independent school in the village of Crowthorne in Berkshire, and subsequently studied Greats at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was taught by classicist and ancient historian Russell Meiggs and moral philosopher R. M. Hare. From 1956 to 1958 he did National Service as a junior officer in the Somerset Light Infantry, serving in Plymouth and Warminster.

==Life and career==
Snow was a foreign correspondent, Defence and Diplomatic Correspondent, and occasional newscaster for Britain&#x27;s Independent Television News (ITN). He also appeared as an election analyst and co-presenter of ITN&#x27;s General Election programmes throughout the late 1960s and 1970s. He joined the organisation in 1962. He gained a much higher profile after he was recruited in 1979 to be the main presenter of the new late evening BBC 2 in-depth news programme &quot;Newsnight&quot;, which began almost a year later than planned, in January 1980. He left &quot;Newsnight&quot; in 1997 and presented &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot; (with Philippa Forrester) and the BBC Radio 4 quizzes &quot;Masterteam&quot; and &quot;Brain of Britain&quot;, amongst other projects. At the Royal Television Society in 1998, Snow won the Judges&#x27; Award for services to broadcasting.

Snow has been involved as an election analyst and co-presenter in the live General Election results programmes for many years, first at ITN for five General Elections (1966–1979) and later at the BBC for a further six (1983–2005). He presented in-depth statistical analyses of the election results at both ITN and the BBC, and at the BBC took over responsibility for this in 1983, following the death of Robert McKenzie, and became largely associated with McKenzie&#x27;s BBC &quot;Swingometer&quot; when it was reinstated in 1992. In his presenting, he often made use of props and graphics. During the Falklands War in 1982 and the First Gulf War in early 1991, he used a sandpit to illustrate the progress of the combat. In 1994, he parodied his election role by providing analysis of the entries for the Eurovision Song Contest in the BBC&#x27;s two contest preview shows ahead of the final in Dublin. His data analysis predicted that either France or the United Kingdom would win. They finished seventh and tenth respectively.

Snow survived a plane crash at Port Blakely, Bainbridge Island, Washington on 1 October 1999 when the de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver, registration number N9766Z, in which he was a passenger hit trees during a film project for the BBC.

Along with his son, Dan, Snow presented &#x27;Battleplan: El Alamein&#x27; for the BBC in October 2002 to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the allied defeat of Rommel&#x27;s Afrika Korps. They then went on in 2004 to make the eight-part BBC series &quot;Battlefield Britain&quot;, covering battles on British soil from Boudicca&#x27;s struggle with the Romans to the Battle of Britain. They demonstrated the hardships that the much smaller soldiers must have faced (Peter is 6&#x27;5&quot; and Dan is 6&#x27;6&quot;). They reunited to host &quot;20th Century Battlefields&quot; for BBC 2 and the Military Channel in 2006. This covered battles all around the world from the Battle of Amiens in the First World War in 1918 to the Gulf War of 1990–1, and was presented in similar fashion to the first Battlefield Britain. Peter and Dan Snow authored BBC books with the same titles to coincide with the TV shows.

Peter and Dan Snow also presented &quot;Whose Britain is it anyway?&quot;, a survey of the ownership of Britain&#x27;s countryside, in 2006, &quot;What makes Britain rich?&quot; in early 2007 and &quot;What Britain earns&quot; in 2008. Peter and Dan have also made two history series for BBC Radio Four on the Black Prince, on Wellington&#x27;s Peninsular War, and the story of the Royal Flying Corps. He also presented &quot;Random Edition&quot; over a number of years, a Radio Four programme that examined in detail the stories in a newspaper chosen at random from one day in history.

On 6 October 2005, the BBC announced that Snow would cease working on election broadcasts. Snow said &quot;I shall be over 70 at the next general election and that, frankly, is a bit old to be dancing around in front of huge graphic displays.&quot; In July 2006, Snow presented &quot;Pompeii Live&quot; for Channel 5, a live outside broadcast telling the story of the Roman towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum. In January 2008, while presenting &quot;What Britain Earns&quot;, a BBC programme about salaries in the UK alongside his son, Snow admitted to earning around £100,000 a year. In the summer of 2008, Peter presented a six part series for Channel 5, &quot;Brits who Made the Modern World&quot;, a celebration of great twentieth century British engineers and inventors. In August 2008, Snow appeared in the reality TV talent show-themed television series, &quot;Maestro&quot; on BBC Two.

In July 2009, to coincide with the 40th anniversary of the NASA Moon landings, ITN produced five special 10-minute programmes for ITV titled &quot;Mission to the Moon – News from 1969&quot;. Snow participated in these programmes, acting as a correspondent alongside former ITN colleague John Suchet, the presenter of the specials. Snow also presented a special on BBC Radio 4 focusing on &quot;Britain&#x27;s First Day of War in 1939&quot;. In June 2013, Snow presented &quot;D-Day As it Happens&quot; for Channel 4.

In July 2016, Snow presented &quot;Trainspotting Live&quot; – a three part television series about trains and trainspotting on BBC Four.
In June 2018 Peter presented a five-part series for Channel Four &quot;Great Train Restorations&quot; which created a so-called Time Train from four refurbished railway carriages.
In July 2019 Peter presented &quot;Planespotting Live&quot; for BBC4 with co-presenter Andi Peters.

== Books ==
In addition to presenting programmes, Snow has written a number of books besides the ones written with his son, Dan. In 1970, he wrote &quot;Leila’s Hijack War&quot; with a journalist colleague, David Phillips, telling the story of the international crisis that was caused by Palestinian guerrillas, including Leila Khaled, who hijacked three airliners and blew them up on a desert airstrip. In 1972, he wrote &quot;Hussein&quot;, the Biography of King Hussein of Jordan. In 2010. Snow published &quot;To War with Wellington&quot;, the story of the Iron Duke&#x27;s campaigns from Portugal to Waterloo. In 2013, he published &quot;When Britain burned the White House&quot;, the story of the 1814 British invasion of Washington.

In 2015, he published &quot;The Battle of Waterloo Experience&quot; with his son Dan on the occasion of the bicentenary of the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. In 2016, they went on to write &quot;Treasures of British History, The Nation&#x27;s History told through its 50 Most Important Documents&quot;.

In 2017, Peter and his wife, Ann MacMillan of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), wrote &quot;War Stories, Gripping Tales of Courage, Cunning and Compassion&quot;, which was published by John Murray.
In 2020, Peter and Ann wrote &quot;Treasures of World History, the Story of Civilisation in 50 documents&quot; published by Welbeck. In 2022 Peter and Ann wrote - also published by Welbeck - &quot;Kings and Queens, the real lives of the English Monarchs&quot;.

==Personal life==
Snow has been married twice, and has six children from three relationships. His eldest son, French citizen Matthieu, was born before his first marriage, although Snow was not aware of his existence until he was an adult. He married Alison Carter in 1964 and the couple had a son (Shane) and a daughter (Shuna). They divorced nine years later.

In 1976 Snow married Ann MacMillan (of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation since 1981), with whom he has a son, Dan (who is married to Lady Edwina Grosvenor, daughter of the 6th Duke of Westminster), and two daughters, Rebecca and Kate. His second wife and sister-in-law are great-granddaughters of former British Prime Minister David Lloyd George.

Snow was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2006 New Year Honours for his services to Broadcasting. His hobbies include model railways, and he has an OO gauge layout installed in his loft. In August 2014, Snow was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

He is the cousin of fellow journalist and broadcaster Jon Snow.

<doc id="494022" wikidata="Q843752" url="?curid=494022" title="Political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina">
<text>The political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina were created by the Dayton Agreement. The agreement divides the country into two federal entities: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) and the Republika Srpska (RS) and one &quot;condominium&quot; of the two entities named the Brčko District.

The vast majority of the population in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina are Bosniaks and Croats, while in Republika Srpska, the vast majority are Serbs. Due to the high powers the entities have and the political differences between the entities themselves, Bosnia and Herzegovina is described as a confederation.

== Overview ==

The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is split into 10 cantons, local governing units that were endowed with substantial autonomy, whereas Republika Srpska operates under a centralised government structure. While the state level holds a limited set of exclusive or joint responsibilities, the entities wield most of the authority. Both the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska control the majority of responsibilities and resources, each with its own constitutions, presidents, parliaments, governments, and prime ministers. They manage citizenship matters and primarily enforce laws since the state level lacks this ability. The entities serve as the primary level for distributing state-collected funds and oversee a significant portion of civil and political rights. They hold direct representation in state-level institutions and essentially possess veto power over all state policies.

<doc id="494023" wikidata="Q505759" url="?curid=494023" title="Andrew L. Harris">
<text>Andrew Lintner Harris (also known as The Farmer–Statesman) (November 17, 1835 – September 13, 1915) was one of the heroes of the Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War and served as the 44th governor of Ohio.

==Biography==
Harris was born in Milford Township, Butler County, Ohio, and was educated in the local schools. After graduating from Miami University in 1860, Harris enlisted as a private in the Union Army. Harris was married at West Florence, Ohio, to Caroline Conger of Preble County, Ohio, on October 17, 1865. They had one son.

==Career==
He quickly rose to the rank of colonel of the 75th Ohio Infantry, seeing action in many of the Army of the Potomac&#x27;s engagements. At Gettysburg on July 1, 1863, he led his men in a successful withdrawal through the hotly contested streets to Cemetery Hill, where they entrenched on the northeastern slope. Assuming command of a brigade, Harris played a key role in delaying repeated attacks the next day by Harry T. Hays&#x27;s famed Louisiana Tigers, helping secure the critical hill for George G. Meade. Harris continued to lead troops through the war, although he suffered an embarrassing defeat in August 1864 at the Battle of Gainesville in Florida. When the war ended he was brevetted a brigadier general of volunteers.

An attorney, Harris began practicing law in 1865 and then served in the Ohio State Senate from 1866 to 1870 and as Preble County Probate Judge from 1875 to 1882. Harris served as the 23rd and 29th lieutenant governor of Ohio having been elected in 1891 and 1893 as the running mate of William McKinley, and again in 1905 when Democrat John M. Pattison was elected governor. An early temperance activist and Republican politician, Harris succeeded Pattison (upon the latter&#x27;s death in June 1906) as governor, serving from 1906 to 1909. He was nominated in 1908 but lost narrowly to Judson Harmon in the gubernatorial election. While in office, Harris signed legislation banning corporate political donations. Harris also served on the U.S. Industrial Commission on Trusts under President McKinley. His official residence was at the Hartman Hotel in Downtown Columbus.

==Honors==
Per state law, U.S. 127 between Hamilton and Eaton was renamed the Gov. Andrew L. Harris Bicentennial Roadway. At the Milford Township Bicentennial in 2005, the Gov. Andrew L. Harris Bicentennial Roadway was dedicated by the Governor&#x27;s relative, James Brodbelt Harris, president of the family reunion association and whose family continues to own an Ohio Century Farm in the township.

==Death==
Harris died of heart trouble on September 13, 1915, and is interred in Mound Hill Union Cemetery, Eaton, Preble County, Ohio US.

<text>The Lockheed-Detroit YP-24 was a 1930s prototype two-seat fighter aircraft produced by Detroit Lockheed. An attack version called the A-9 was also proposed. The YP-24 is most notable for being the first fighter aircraft to bear the Lockheed name.

==Design and development==
In 1930, Detroit Aircraft Corporation undertook a private venture to develop a new fighter (&quot;pursuit aircraft&quot; in contemporary terminology) for US Army Air Corps based on the successful Lockheed Altair transport plane. Designed by Robert J. Woods, the aircraft was completed in 1931 with Detroit Aircraft fabricating the metal fuselage and Lockheed providing the wooden wings, essentially identical to the Altair. Wright Field assigned the prototype the designation XP-900. Vance Breese was hired to be the chief test pilot for the project. The aircraft was purchased by USAAC in September 1931 and redesignated YP-24, serial number &quot;32-320&quot;. Early testing was sufficiently impressive to generate an order for five Y1P-24 fighters and four Y1A-9 attack aircraft intended to replace the Berliner-Joyce P-16. The A-9 differed in having four forward-firing machine guns, underwing racks for bombs, and a V-1570-27 engine better low-altitude performance.

==Operational history==

On 19 October 1931, the sole aircraft crashed. The aircraft had a partially stuck landing gear, and Wright Field pilots painted messages on the side of their P-12D and O-25C aircraft, indicating to test pilot Lt. Harrison Crocker to bail out.

Shortly after, in October 1931, events in the Great Depression forced Detroit Aircraft into bankruptcy with Lockheed following suit in June 1932. Although Lockheed was resuscitated by a group of investors only five days after it closed doors, the financial hardships had taken their toll and the P-24/A-9 project was cancelled with no aircraft built beyond the original prototype. Four pre-production Y1P-24s, &quot;32-321/324&quot;, were cancelled. However, after Robert Woods left Detroit Aircraft for Consolidated Aircraft, he continued to develop the YP-24/A-9 concept into the Consolidated Y1P-25/Y1A-11 which eventually entered service as the Consolidated P-30.

<text>Hypericum calycinum is a species of prostrate or low-growing shrub in the flowering plant family Hypericaceae. It is native to the Strandzha Mountains along the Bulgarian and Turkish Black Sea coast. Widely cultivated for its large yellow flowers, its names as a garden plant include rose-of-Sharon in Britain and Australia, and Aaron&#x27;s beard, great St-John&#x27;s wort, creeping St. John&#x27;s wort and Jerusalem star.

==Description==
&quot;Hypericum calycinum&quot; is a low, creeping, evergreen woody shrub (classified as a subshrub or shrublet) to about 1 m tall and 1–2 m wide but often smaller. The green, ovate leaves grow in opposite pairs. Usually 4 inches long, the undersides of the leaves are net-veined. In the sun, the leaves are a vibrant green color, and in shade, the leaves are a lighter yellow-green. The underside of the leaves is a blue-green color and in the fall, the leaves take on a purple color.

The flowers are 3–5 cm in diameter, a rich yellow, with five petals and numerous yellow stamens. Its flowers can be described as &quot;rose-like&quot; and tend to be single or in units of two or three, flowering in June to September.

&quot;Hypericum calycinum&quot; is indigenous to southeast Europe and southwest Asia. It is a popular, semi-evergreen garden shrub with many named cultivars and hybrids derived from it.

Although the genus is generally not affected by rust fungi, it can appear on &quot;H. calycinum&quot; (and another cultivated plant, &quot;Hypericum&quot; × &quot;inodorum&quot; &#x27;Elstead&#x27;).

==Usage==
Various species of the genus &quot;Hypericum&quot; have been used since ancient times as herbal remedies. This species has been used traditionally to reduce muscle spasms and for the treatment of asthma.

&quot;Hypericum calycinum&quot; is an economically valuable plant in North America, commonly used for ornamental reasons and landscaping.

Under ideal growing conditions, from full sun to partial shade and well-drained acidic soil, this species can grow rapidly. Although resilient in many soil types, this species grows best in sandy or loamy soils. This shrub grows through underground stems and is typically grown as ground cover or to stabilize soil on hills and requires low maintenance. It does have the potential to become invasive, as reported in some areas of California, due to its ability to grow rapidly by stolons. While generally easy to take care of, this species is suggested to be cut down each spring.

According to the USDA, this species is used as nursery stock product.

It is visited by the honeybees for its pollen. 

==Etymology==
In North America the name Rose of Sharon is applied to a species in a different order, &quot;Hibiscus syriacus.&quot;

The common name of St. John&#x27;s wort, which is used to describe plants of the entire genus, arose from the old tradition of &quot;Hypericum&quot; plants being burned on the eve of St. John&#x27;s Day, to stave off evil spirits. The species name, &quot;calycinum&quot;, comes from the flower&#x27;s prominent calyx, the whorl of the sepals.

==Research==
This species is capable of producing the same medicinally active components as &quot;H. perforatum&quot; (hyperforin etc.), though in different ratios, with adhyperforin predominating, and a low level of hyperforin present.

Research has shown that the UV pigments of the &quot;Hypericum calycinum&quot; flower stave off predators such as mites and aphids. One type of DIP (dearomatized isoprenylated phloroglucinols), a category of pigments alongside flavonoids, was found to be toxic to a caterpillar as well. A large quantity of DIPs were found in the male and female reproductive organs, which furthers emphasizes the use of DIPs as a defense mechanism. These pigments also serve a dual function to attract pollinators, as they are visible to insects and not humans.

Recent research on mice has shown that the alcoholic extracts from &quot;Hypericum calycinum&quot; have antidepressant effects and are comparably as effective as antidepressant drugs, such as desipramine and trimipramine. Unlike the rest of the genus, &quot;H. calycinum&quot; does not have hypericin, which causes photosensitization, which causes the side effects of flush, fatigue, and pruritus when used in drugs. These extracts have the potential to be a remedy for depression without these side effects common in current antidepressants. However, more research is required.

<text>Per Christian Jersild, better known as &quot;P. C. Jersild&quot;, (born 1935) is a Swedish author and physician. He also holds an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Medicine at Uppsala University from 22 January 2000, and another one in engineering from the Royal Institute of Technology (1999).

== Biography ==

P. C. Jersild was born in Katrineholm in a middle-class family.

His first book was &quot;Räknelära&quot; which he released 1960 at the age of 25, although he had already been writing for 10 years at that time. Until now he has written 35 books, usually focused on social criticism. His most famous work is &quot;Barnens ö&quot; (&quot;Children&#x27;s Island&quot;), which tells the story of a young boy, on the verge of adulthood, who runs off from a children&#x27;s summer camp to spend time alone in the big city, Stockholm. Other notable books include &quot;Babels hus&quot; (&quot;The House of Babel&quot;), which gives an account of the inhuman treatment of patients at a large modern hospital, said to be modeled on the Karolinska Hospital in Huddinge outside Stockholm, and the science fiction novel &quot;En levande själ&quot; (&quot;A Living Soul&quot;), about a living, thinking and feeling human brain floating in a container of liquid.

Aside from his literary production, Jersild has also been a columnist for Dagens Nyheter since the mid-1980s. In 1999, he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

<text>&quot;London Bridge Is Falling Down&quot; (also known as &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; or &quot;London Bridge&quot;) is a traditional English nursery rhyme and singing game, which is found in different versions all over the world. It deals with the dilapidation of London Bridge and attempts, realistic or fanciful, to repair it. It may date back to bridge-related rhymes and games of the Late Middle Ages, but the earliest records of the rhyme in English are from the 17th century. The lyrics were first printed in close to their modern form in the mid-18th century and became popular, particularly in Britain and the United States, during the 19th century.

The modern melody was first recorded in the late 19th century. It has the Roud Folk Song Index number 502. Several explanations have been advanced to explain the meaning of the rhyme and the identity of the &quot;fair lady&quot; of the refrain. The rhyme is well known and has been referenced in a variety of works of literature and popular culture.

==Lyrics==
There is considerable variation in the lyrics of the rhyme. The most frequently used first verse is:

Although another version substitutes:

The rhyme is constructed of quatrains in trochaic tetrameter catalectic (each line made up of four metrical feet of two syllables, with the stress falling on the first syllable in a pair; the last foot in the line missing the unstressed syllable), which is common in nursery rhymes. In its most common form it relies on a double repetition, rather than a rhyming scheme, which is a frequently employed device in children&#x27;s rhymes and stories. The Roud Folk Song Index, which catalogues folk songs and their variations by number, classifies the song as 502.

A melody is recorded for &quot;London Bridge&quot; in an edition of John Playford&#x27;s &quot;The Dancing Master&quot; published in 1718, but it differs from the modern tune recorded above and no lyrics were given. An issue of &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1821 noted the rhyme as being sung to the tune of &quot;Nancy Dawson&quot;, now better known as &quot;Nuts in May,&quot; and the same tune was given in Richard Thomson&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles of London Bridge&quot; (1827).

Another tune was recorded in Samuel Arnold&#x27;s &quot;Juvenile Amusements&quot; in 1797. E.F. Rimbault&#x27;s &quot;Nursery Rhymes&quot; (1836) has the same first line, but then a different tune. The tune now associated with the rhyme was first recorded in 1879 in the United States in A.H. Rosewig&#x27;s &quot;Illustrated National Songs and Games&quot;.

==The game==
The rhyme is often used in a children&#x27;s singing game, which exists in a wide variety of forms, with additional verses. Most versions are similar to the actions used in the rhyme &quot;Oranges and Lemons&quot;. The most common is that two players hold hands and make an arch with their arms while the others pass through in single file. The &quot;arch&quot; is then lowered at the song&#x27;s end to &quot;catch&quot; a player. In the United States, it is common for two teams of those that have been caught to engage in a tug of war. In England until the nineteenth century, the song may have been accompanied by a circle dance, but arch games are known to have been common across late medieval Europe.

Five of nine versions published by Alice Gomme in 1894 included references to a prisoner who has stolen a watch and chain. This may be a late 19th century addition from another game called &quot;Hark the Robbers&quot;, or &quot;Watch and Chain&quot;. This rhyme is sung to the same tune and may be an offshoot of &quot;London Bridge&quot; or the remnant of a distinct game. In one version the first two verses have the lyrics:

==Origins==

Similar rhymes can be found across Europe, pre-dating the records in England. These include from Denmark, from Germany, from 16th-century France, and from 14th-century Italy. It is possible that the rhyme was acquired from one of these sources and then adapted to fit the most famous bridge in England.

One of the earliest references to the rhyme in English is in the comedy &quot;The London Chaunticleres&quot;, printed in 1657, but probably written about 1636, in which the dairy woman Curds states that she had &quot;danced the building of London-Bridge&quot; at the Whitsun Ales in her youth, although no words or actions are mentioned. Widespread familiarity with the rhyme is suggested by its use by Henry Carey in his satire &quot;Namby Pamby&quot; (1725), as:

The oldest extant version could be that recalled by a correspondent to the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1823, which he claimed to have heard from a woman who was a child in the reign of Charles II () and had the lyrics:

The earliest printed English version is in the oldest extant collection of nursery rhymes, &quot;Tommy Thumb&#x27;s Pretty Song Book&quot;, printed by John Newbery in London (), and has words very close to that. A version from James Ritson&#x27;s &quot;Gammer Gurton&#x27;s Garland&quot; (1784) is also similar but replaces the last verse with:

==Meaning==
The meaning of the rhyme is not certain. It may simply relate to the many difficulties experienced in bridging the River Thames, but a number of alternative explanations have been put forward.

===Viking attack explanation===
One hypothesis of origin is that the rhyme relates to the supposed destruction of London Bridge by Olaf II in 1014 (or 1009). The translation of the Norse saga the , published by Samuel Laing in 1844, included a verse by Óttarr svarti, that looks very similar to the nursery rhyme:

However, modern translations make it clear that Laing was using the nursery rhyme as a model for his very free translation, and the reference to London Bridge does not appear at the start of the verse and it is unlikely that this is an earlier version of the nursery rhyme. Some historians have raised the possibility that the attack never took place. However, the original document detailing the attack was written only about 100 years after what would be a famous event in a highly populated area, leading the majority of historians to conclude that the account is at least relatively accurate.

===Child sacrifice/immurement explanation===
Alice Bertha Gomme (later Lady Gomme) put forward the hypothesis that the song refers to the burying, perhaps alive, of children in the foundations of the bridge. This theory was repeated by Iona and Peter Opie. This was based around the idea that a bridge would collapse unless the body of a human sacrifice was buried in its foundations and that the watchman is actually a human sacrifice, who will then watch over the bridge.

Bodies were found beneath London Bridge in 2007 while building work was being carried out for the London Dungeons tourist attraction.

===Age and damage explanation===
Until the mid-18th century the Old London Bridge was the only crossing on the Thames in London. It was damaged in a major fire in 1633, but in the Great Fire of 1666, this damage acted as a firebreak and prevented the flames from further damaging the bridge and crossing to the south bank of the Thames. With its 19 narrow arches, it impeded river traffic and flow. Central piers were removed to create a wider navigational span. Widening and the removal of its houses was completed in 1763, but it remained relatively narrow and needed continual and expensive repairs. In the early 19th century, it was decided to replace the bridge with a new construction. New London Bridge was opened in 1831 and survived until it was replaced in 1972. At that time, the 1831 bridge was dismantled and reconstructed in Lake Havasu City, Arizona.

===&quot;Fair lady&quot; identity===
Several attempts have been made to identify the &quot;fair lady&quot;, &quot;lady gay&quot;, or lady &quot;lee/lea&quot; of the rhyme. They include:

* Virgin Mary: The nursery rhyme could allude to the Virgin Mary as the &quot;fair lady&quot;. The Viking attack was on 8 September 1009 (or 1014), the traditional feast for the birthday of the Virgin Mary; they burned the bridge but could not take the city, as it was protected by the &#x27;fair lady&#x27;.
* Matilda of Scotland (): Henry I&#x27;s consort, who between 1110 and 1118 was responsible for the building of the series of bridges that carried the London–Colchester road across the River Lea and its side streams between Bow and Stratford.
* Eleanor of Provence (): Consort of Henry III, who had custody of the bridge revenues from 1269 to about 1281. Eleanor of Provence was also pelted with eggs and stones at London Bridge by mobs as her barge tried passing beneath. This was in response to the political discontent that had been created not only by the king’s vast unpopularity at the time, but was also sparked by his son King Edward I&#x27;s raiding of the Temple.
* A member of the Leigh family of Stoneleigh Park, Warwickshire, who have a family story that a human sacrifice lies under the structure.
* The River Lea, which is a tributary of the Thames.

==Legacy==
By the late 19th century, the rhyme had become one of the most popular and well known in the English-speaking world. It has also been referenced in both literature and popular culture – appearing, for example, at the climax of T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot; (1922). The final line may have been cited as the inspiration for the title of the 1956 musical &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, while the chorus of Brenda Lee&#x27;s song &quot;My Whole World Is Falling Down&quot; (1963) is loosely based on &quot;London Bridge Is Falling Down&quot;. The music on the first track of the Helloween&#x27;s album &quot;Walls of Jericho&quot; (1985) was also based on &quot;London Bridge Is Falling Down&quot;, and the traditional tune is often used by English football supporters as the basis for chants.

<text>Chicago Express Airlines, Inc. was a regional airline headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, United States.

It operated regional feeder services from Chicago Midway Airport under the name ATA Connection. On June 1, 1999, ATA Airlines acquired Chicago Express for $1.9 million. Chicago Express became a wholly owned subsidiary of Amtran, later known as ATA Holdings, and now known as Global Aero Logistics, Inc. The airline had a line maintenance base at Midway Airport in Chicago, Illinois, and a hangar maintenance base at Gerald R. Ford International Airport in Grand Rapids, Michigan. In 2000, The hangar maintenance base was moved to South Bend Regional Airport in South Bend, Indiana. Chicago Express provided connecting service at ATA&#x27;s hub, Chicago Midway International Airport. In 2004, ATA Airlines declared bankruptcy, and as a result, ATA terminated turboprop service (ATA Connection), and Chicago Express ceased all operations on March 28, 2005. It was purchased by CSC Investment Group based in Chicago, headed up by investment group CEO Edward Halley, on March 28, 2005. Chicago Express Airlines relaunched June 1, 2021 as an International Charter Cargo Airline Broker utilizing multiple International Airlines Operating Certificates and Aircraft.

== History ==

The airline was established in 1993 by Mike Brady of Express Airlines I in Atlanta, Georgia. The airline started operations in August 1993. Its route structure in many ways mimiced an unrelated defunct predecessor named Chicago Air which also operated from Chicago Midway&#x27;s airport less than a decade before. On June 1, 1999, Chicago Express became a wholly owned subsidiary of Amtran, later known as ATA Holdings and now Global Aero Logistics, and operated as ATA Connection, a regional code sharing affiliate of the now defunct ATA Airlines (formerly known as American Trans Air). Chicago Express&#x27; principal base of operations was Chicago Midway International Airport, where the company maintained its headquarters. For several months before its liquidation, the company also operated a hub in Indianapolis, part of ATA&#x27;s failed plan for intrastate flights throughout Indiana. However, following ATA Holdings&#x27; decision to codeshare flights with Southwest Airlines, a decision was made to terminate Chicago Express effective March 28, 2005, in favor of a strictly mainline operation. CSC Investment Group, Inc., headed by CEO Edward S. Halley, purchased the airline in 2005 for $3.2 million. Chicago Express Airlines relaunched June 1, 2021 as a International Cargo Charter Airline utilizing aircraft from International Cargo Carriers Operating Certificates and Aircraft

==Destinations==

At the time of ATA&#x27;s grounding of Chicago Express on March 28, 2005, Chicago Express/ATA Connection had operated scheduled service to 17 destinations throughout the Midwest:

===United States===

====Illinois====
*Chicago (Chicago Midway International Airport) Hub
*Moline (Quad City International Airport)
*Springfield (Abraham Lincoln Capital Airport)

====Indiana====
*Evansville (Evansville Regional Airport)
*Fort Wayne (Fort Wayne International Airport)
*Indianapolis (Indianapolis International Airport) Hub
*South Bend (South Bend Regional Airport)

====Iowa====
*Cedar Rapids (The Eastern Iowa Airport)
*Des Moines (Des Moines International Airport)

====Kentucky====
*Lexington (Blue Grass Airport)

====Michigan====
*Flint (Bishop International Airport)
*Grand Rapids (Gerald R. Ford International Airport)
*Lansing (Lansing Capital City Airport)

====Ohio====
*Dayton (Dayton International Airport)
*Toledo (Toledo Express Airport)

====Wisconsin====
*Madison (Dane County Regional Airport)
*Milwaukee (General Mitchell International Airport)

Prior to the airline&#x27;s dissolution, it announced new service from Indianapolis to Gary/Chicago International Airport in Gary, Indiana, however it never began service on this route.

== Fleet ==

At the time of termination on March 28, 2005, the Chicago Express fleet consisted of 16 Saab 340B configured to carry 34 passengers on short-haul and commuter flights. All were former American Eagle aircraft.

===Fleet history===

Chicago Express received delivery of its first Saab 340B (registered as N194AE) on February 5, 2000. 
Having previously operated a fleet of BAe Jetstream 31 aircraft, at the time Chicago Express ceased operations its fleet consisted of 17 Saab 340B aircraft, all of which were former American Eagle aircraft. The 17 Saab 340Bs replaced the BAe Jetstream 31s, which were used prior to ATA&#x27;s acquisition of the airline in 1999.

The Jetstream 31s were divided into two groups based on design features: 6 Jetstreams were equipped with Garrett turboprops with Automatic Power Reserve (which came from JetStream International, a USAir commuter. These were the ones with tail numbers N8xxJS), and the remaining 4 Jetstreams were equipped with Garrett turboprops with water-methanol injection. After Amtran&#x27;s acquisition of Chicago Express in 1999, the Jetstreams were &quot;retired&quot; and most found homes with other (mostly corporate) operators. One aircraft was written off during an engine run-up immediately prior to its resale to another operator when one propeller struck a ground power unit.

Two Saab 340Bs (N309CE and N311CE) were owned by Amtran, and remained in Indianapolis for several months after Chicago Express ceased operations. The remainder were quickly leased by Colgan Air.

<doc id="494055" wikidata="Q5205774" url="?curid=494055" title="DNA synthesis">
<text>DNA synthesis is the natural or artificial creation of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecules. DNA is a macromolecule made up of nucleotide units, which are linked by covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds, in a repeating structure. DNA synthesis occurs when these nucleotide units are joined to form DNA; this can occur artificially (&quot;in vitro&quot;) or naturally (&quot;in vivo&quot;). Nucleotide units are made up of a nitrogenous base (cytosine, guanine, adenine or thymine), pentose sugar (deoxyribose) and phosphate group. Each unit is joined when a covalent bond forms between its phosphate group and the pentose sugar of the next nucleotide, forming a sugar-phosphate backbone. DNA is a complementary, double stranded structure as specific base pairing (adenine and thymine, guanine and cytosine) occurs naturally when hydrogen bonds form between the nucleotide bases.

There are several different definitions for DNA synthesis: it can refer to DNA replication - DNA biosynthesis (&quot;in vivo&quot; DNA amplification), polymerase chain reaction - enzymatic DNA synthesis (&quot;in vitro&quot; DNA amplification) or gene synthesis - physically creating artificial gene sequences. Though each type of synthesis is very different, they do share some features.
Nucleotides that have been joined to form polynucleotides can act as a DNA template for one form of DNA synthesis - PCR - to occur. DNA replication also works by using a DNA template, the DNA double helix unwinds during replication, exposing unpaired bases for new nucleotides to hydrogen bond to. Gene synthesis, however, does not require a DNA template and genes are assembled &quot;de novo&quot;.

DNA synthesis occurs in all eukaryotes and prokaryotes, as well as some viruses. The accurate synthesis of DNA is important in order to avoid mutations to DNA. In humans, mutations could lead to diseases such as cancer so DNA synthesis, and the machinery involved &quot;in vivo&quot;, has been studied extensively throughout the decades. In the future these studies may be used to develop technologies involving DNA synthesis, to be used in data storage.

==DNA replication==

In nature, DNA molecules are synthesised by all living cells through the process of DNA replication. This typically occurs as a part of cell division. DNA replication occurs so, during cell division, each daughter cell contains an accurate copy of the genetic material of the cell. &quot;In vivo&quot; DNA synthesis (DNA replication) is dependent on a complex set of enzymes which have evolved to act during the S phase of the cell cycle, in a concerted fashion. In both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, DNA replication occurs when specific topoisomerases, helicases and gyrases (replication initiator proteins) uncoil the double-stranded DNA, exposing the nitrogenous bases. These enzymes, along with accessory proteins, form a macromolecular machine which ensures accurate duplication of DNA sequences. Complementary base pairing takes place, forming a new double-stranded DNA molecule. This is known as semi-conservative replication since one strand of the new DNA molecule is from the &#x27;parent&#x27; strand.

Continuously, eukaryotic enzymes encounter DNA damage which can perturb DNA replication. This damage is in the form of DNA lesions that arise spontaneously or due to DNA damaging agents. DNA replication machinery is therefore highly controlled in order to prevent collapse when encountering damage. Control of the DNA replication system ensures that the genome is replicated only once per cycle; over-replication induces DNA damage. Deregulation of DNA replication is a key factor in genomic instability during cancer development.

This highlights the specificity of DNA synthesis machinery &quot;in vivo&quot;. Various means exist to artificially stimulate the replication of naturally occurring DNA, or to create artificial gene sequences. However, DNA synthesis &quot;in vitro&quot; can be a very error-prone process.

===DNA repair synthesis===

Damaged DNA is subject to repair by several different enzymatic repair processes, where each individual process is specialized to repair particular types of damage. The DNA of humans is subject to damage from multiple natural sources and insufficient repair is associated with disease and premature aging. Most DNA repair processes form single-strand gaps in DNA during an intermediate stage of the repair, and these gaps are filled in by repair synthesis. The specific repair processes that require gap filling by DNA synthesis include nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair, mismatch repair, homologous recombinational repair, non-homologous end joining and microhomology-mediated end joining.

==Reverse Transcription==
Reverse transcription is part of the replication cycle of particular virus families, including retroviruses. It involves copying RNA into double-stranded complementary DNA (cDNA), using reverse transcriptase enzymes. In retroviruses, viral RNA is inserted into a host cell nucleus. There, a viral reverse transcriptase enzyme adds DNA nucleotides onto the RNA sequence, generating cDNA that is inserted into the host cell genome by the enzyme integrase, encoding viral proteins.

==Polymerase chain reaction==

A polymerase chain reaction is a form of enzymatic DNA synthesis in the laboratory, using cycles of repeated heating and cooling of the reaction for DNA melting and enzymatic replication of the DNA.

DNA synthesis during PCR is very similar to living cells but has very specific reagents and conditions. During PCR, DNA is chemically extracted from host chaperone proteins then heated, causing thermal dissociation of the DNA strands. Two new cDNA strands are built from the original strand, these strands can be split again to act as the template for further PCR products. The original DNA is multiplied through many rounds of PCR. More than a billion copies of the original DNA strand can be made.

===Random mutagenesis===
For many experiments, such as structural and evolutionary studies, scientists need to produce a large library of variants of a particular DNA sequence. Random mutagenesis takes place in vitro, when mutagenic replication with a low fidelity DNA polymerase is combined with selective PCR amplification to produce many copies of mutant DNA.

===RT-PCR===
RT-PCR differs from conventional PCR as it synthesizes cDNA from mRNA, rather than template DNA. The technique couples a reverse transcription reaction with PCR-based amplification, as an RNA sequence acts as a template for the enzyme, reverse transcriptase. RT-PCR is often used to test gene expression in particular tissue or cell types at various developmental stages or to test for genetic disorders.

==Gene synthesis==
Artificial gene synthesis is the process of synthesizing a gene &quot;in vitro&quot; without the need for initial template DNA samples.
In 2010 J. Craig Venter and his team were the first to use entirely synthesized DNA to create a self-replicating microbe, dubbed Mycoplasma laboratorium.

===Oligonucleotide synthesis===
Oligonucleotide synthesis is the chemical synthesis of sequences of nucleic acids. The majority of biological research and bioengineering involves synthetic DNA, which can include oligonucleotides, synthetic genes, or even chromosomes. Today, most synthetic DNA is custom-built using the phosphoramidite method by Marvin H. Caruthers. Oligos are synthesized from building blocks which replicate natural bases. Other techniques for synthesising DNA have been commercially made available, including Short Oligo Ligation Assembly. The process has been automated since the late 1970s and can be used to form desired genetic sequences as well as for other uses in medicine and molecular biology. However, creating sequences chemically is impractical beyond 200-300 bases, and is an environmentally hazardous process. These oligos, of around 200 bases, can be connected using DNA assembly methods, creating larger DNA molecules.

Some studies have explored the possibility of enzymatic synthesis using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), a DNA polymerase that requires no template. However, this method is not yet as effective as chemical synthesis, and is not commercially available.

With advances in artificial DNA synthesis, the possibility of DNA data storage is being explored. With its ultrahigh storage density and long-term stability, synthetic DNA is an interesting option to store large amounts of data. Although information can be retrieved very quickly from DNA through next generation sequencing technologies, de novo synthesis of DNA is a major bottleneck in the process. Only one nucleotide can be added per cycle, with each cycle taking seconds, so the overall synthesis is very time-consuming, as well as very error prone. However, if biotechnology improves, synthetic DNA could one day be used in data storage.

===Base pair synthesis===
It has been reported that new nucleobase pairs can be synthesized, as well as A-T (adenine - thymine) and G-C (guanine - cytosine). Synthetic nucleotides can be used to expand the genetic alphabet and allow specific modification of DNA sites. Even just a third base pair would expand the number of amino acids that can be encoded by DNA from the existing 20 amino acids to a possible 172. 
Hachimoji DNA is built from eight nucleotide letters, forming four possible base pairs. It therefore doubles the information density of natural DNA. In studies, RNA has even been produced from hachimoji DNA. This technology could also be used to allow data storage in DNA.

<text>Mug Root Beer (sometimes stylized as MUG Root Beer) is an American brand of root beer that was originally produced in 1940 under the name Belfast Root Beer. It is now produced by New Century Beverage Company of San Francisco, California, which was acquired by PepsiCo in 1986. 

== History ==
Mug Root Beer was originally sold under the name Belfast Root Beer in 1940 by the Belfast Beverage Company in San Francisco, California. The company had been known for making sparkling water and ginger ale since 1877. Belfast Beverage Company was purchased around 1925 by New Century Beverage Company, which had successfully launched Crush Soda in 1918. 

In 1936, New Century Beverage Company was granted permission to franchise Pepsi-Cola products, and about four years later, it launched Belfast Root Beer. An advertisement for Belfast Root Beer appears as early as 1947. According to the San Francisco Examiner, the catchphrase, &#x27;You haven&#x27;t tasted Root Beer like this in years!&#x27; filled 1950s newspaper advertisements.&quot; An advertisement for Belfast Old Fashioned Mug Root Beer appears as early as 1952. In the 1950s, the soda took on the title Belfast Old Fashioned Mug Root Beer before its name was eventually shortened to Mug Root Beer.

In the late 1960s, Sugar Free Mug (later known as Diet Mug Root Beer) was introduced. Mug Cream Soda and Diet Mug Cream Soda were later introduced, but they are not as widely available. Mug was purchased by Pepsi in 1986, and replaced On-Tap Draft Style Root Beer as Pepsi&#x27;s root beer brand. Mug Root Beer is currently manufactured by independent bottlers under the authority of New Century Beverage Company.

Since Mug Root Beer&#x27;s acquisition by PepsiCo in 1986, the company&#x27;s logo has displayed a bulldog named &quot;Dog&quot; holding a glass of what appears to be frothy Mug Root Beer. PepsiCo stopped producing its sodas in San Francisco in the early 1990s, including Mug Root Beer.

<doc id="494060" wikidata="Q471260" url="?curid=494060" title="Josiah Royce">
<text>Josiah Royce (; November 20, 1855 – September 14, 1916) was an American Pragmatist and objective idealist philosopher and the founder of American idealism. His philosophical ideas included his joining of pragmatism and idealism, his philosophy of loyalty, and his defense of absolutism.

Royce&#x27;s &quot;A Word for the Times&quot; (1914) was quoted in the 1936 State of the Union Address by Franklin Delano Roosevelt: &quot;The human race now passes through one of its great crises. New ideas, new issues – a new call for men to carry on the work of righteousness, of charity, of courage, of patience, and of loyalty. [...] I studied, I loved, I labored, unsparingly and hopefully, to be worthy of my generation.&quot;

==Life==
Royce, born on November 20, 1855, in Grass Valley, California, was the son of Josiah and Sarah Eleanor (Bayliss) Royce, whose families were recent English emigrants and who sought their fortune in the westward movement of the American pioneers in 1849. In 1875 he received a B.A. from the University of California, Berkeley (which moved from Oakland to Berkeley during his matriculation), where he later accepted an instructorship teaching English composition, literature, and rhetoric.

While at the university, he studied with Joseph LeConte, Professor of Geology and Natural History and a prominent spokesperson for the compatibility between evolution and religion. In a memorial published shortly after LeConte&#x27;s death, Royce described the impact of LeConte&#x27;s teaching on his own development, writing: &quot;the wonder thus aroused was, for me, the beginning of philosophy&quot; (p. 328). After studying in Germany with Hermann Lotze, he returned to the United States to finish his doctorate at Johns Hopkins University, where he was awarded one of the institution&#x27;s first four doctorates, in philosophy in 1878. At Johns Hopkins he taught a course on the history of German thought, which was “one of his chief interests” because he was able to give consideration to the philosophy of history. After four years at the University of California, Berkeley, he went to Harvard in 1882 as a sabbatical replacement for William James, who was Royce&#x27;s friend and philosophical antagonist. Royce&#x27;s position at Harvard was made permanent in 1884, and he remained there until his death on September 14, 1916.

Royce was an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the United States National Academy of Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.

==Historiography==
Royce stands out starkly in the philosophical crowd because he was the only major American philosopher who spent a significant period of his life studying and writing history, specifically of the American West. “As one of the four giants in American philosophy of his time […] Royce overshadowed himself as historian, in both reputation and output” (Pomeroy, 2). During his first three years at Harvard, Royce taught many different subjects such as English composition, forensics, psychology and philosophy for other professors. Although he eventually settled into writing philosophy, his early adulthood was characterized by wide-ranging interests, during which he wrote a novel, investigated paranormal phenomena (as a skeptic), and published a significant body of literary criticism. Only as historian and philosopher did he distinguish himself. Royce spread himself too thin, however, and in 1888 suffered a nervous breakdown which required him to take a leave of absence from his duties.
John Clendenning&#x27;s 1999 book is the standard biography of Royce. Autobiographical remarks by Royce can be found in Oppenheim&#x27;s study. In 1883 Royce was approached by a publishing company who asked him to write the state history of California, “In view of his precarious circumstances at Harvard and his desire to pursue the philosophical work for which he had come east, Royce found the prospect attractive […]. He wrote to a friend that he was ‘tempted by the money’”. Royce viewed the task as a side project, which he could use to fill his free time. In 1891 his historical writing career came to an end, but not before he had published several reviews of California’s historical volumes, and articles in journals to supplement his history.

==Philosophy==
The years between 1882 and 1895 established Royce as one of the most eminent American philosophers. His publication in 1885 of &quot;The Religious Aspect of Philosophy&quot;, and in 1892 of &quot;The Spirit of Modern Philosophy&quot;, both based on Harvard lectures, secured his place in the philosophical world. The former of these contained a new proof for the existence of God based upon the reality of error. All errors are judged to be erroneous in comparison to some total truth, Royce argued, and we must either hold ourselves infallible or accept that even our errors are evidence of a world of truth. Having made it clear that idealism depends upon postulates and proceeds hypothetically, Royce defends the necessity of objective reference of our ideas to a universal whole within which they belong, for without these postulates, &quot;both and the commonest results of theory, from the simplest impressions to the most valuable beliefs, would be for most if not all of us utterly impossible&quot;.

The justification for idealistic postulates is practical (a point Royce made repeatedly in his maturity, accepting the label of pragmatist for himself), to the extent that it embraced practical life as the guide and determiner of the value of philosophical ideas. Royce accepted the fact that he had not and could not offer a complete or satisfactory account of the &quot;relation of the individual minds to the all-embracing mind” (see &quot;RAP&quot;, p. 371), but he pushes ahead in spite of this difficulty to offer the best account he can manage. This stance is called fallibilism by the philosophers of his generation, and Royce&#x27;s embrace of it may be attributed to the influence of Charles Sanders Peirce and William James.

Royce also defends a view that was later to be called personalism—i.e., “The ambiguous relation of the conscious individuals to the universal thought...will be decided in the sense of their inclusion, as elements in the universal thought. They will indeed not become &#x27;things in the dream&#x27; of any other person than themselves, but their whole reality, just exactly as it is in them, will be found to be but a fragment of a higher reality. This reality will be no power, nor will it produce the individuals by dreaming of them, but it will complete the existence that in them, as separate beings, has no rational completeness”. (&quot;RAP&quot;, pp. 380–381) This is an unavoidable hypothesis, Royce believed, and its moral and religious aspect point to the existence of an Absolute.

===Absolutism and temporalism===
The “Absolute&quot; Royce defended was quite different from the ideas of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and F. H. Bradley. Royce&#x27;s Absolute is the ground and originator of community, a personal, temporal being who preserves the past in its entirety, sustains the full present by an act of interpretation, and anticipates every possibility in the future, infusing these possibilities with value as the ideal of community. The principal difference between Royce&#x27;s Absolute and the similar idea held by other thinkers is its temporal and personal character, and its interpretive activity. This divine activity Royce increasingly came to see in terms of the notion suggested by Charles Sanders Peirce of “agapism”, or “evolutionary love”. Royce believed that human beings do have experience of the Absolute in the irrevocability of each and every deed we do. To confront the way that our acts cannot be undone is to meet the Absolute in its temporal necessity. The philosophical idea of the Absolute is an inevitable hypothesis for a coherent system of thought, Royce argued, but for practical purposes and a meaningful ethical life, all human beings need is an ongoing &quot;will to interpret&quot;. The temporal ground of all acts of interpretation is &quot;the Interpreter Spirit&quot;, which is another name for the Absolute, but a philosophical understanding of such a being is not required for successful interpretation and ethical life.

===The &quot;conception of God&quot; debate===
A benchmark in Royce&#x27;s career and thought occurred when he returned to California to speak to the Philosophical Union at Berkeley, ostensibly to defend his concept of God from the criticisms of George Holmes Howison, Joseph Le Conte, and Sidney Mezes, a meeting the &quot;New York Times&quot; called “a battle of the giants”. There Royce offered a new modal version of his proof for the reality of God based upon ignorance rather than error, based upon the fragmentariness of individual existence rather than its epistemological uncertainty. However, Howison attacked Royce&#x27;s doctrine for having left no ontological standing for the individual over against the Absolute, rendering Royce&#x27;s idealism a kind of pernicious impersonalism, according to Howison. Royce never intended this result and responded to Howison&#x27;s criticism first in a long supplementary essay to the debate (1897), and then by developing the philosophy of the individual person in greater detail in his Gifford Lectures, published under the title &quot;The World and the Individual&quot; (1899, 1901). Simultaneously Royce was enduring a resolute assault on his hypothetical absolutism from James. 

Royce later admitted that his engagement with the philosophy of Bradley may have led to a more robust engagement with the Absolute than was warranted, and it might be added that his persistent reading of Spinoza might have had similar effects.

===The World and the individual===
The First Series of Gifford Lectures made the case against three historical conceptions of being, called “realism”, “mysticism”, and “&quot;critical rationalism&quot;”, by Royce, and defended a “Fourth Conception of Being”. Realism, according to Royce, held that to be is to be independent, which mysticism and critical rationalism advanced other criteria, that to be way to, immediacy in the case of mysticism and objective validity in critical rationalism. As hypotheses about the fundamental character of being, Royce shows each of these falls into contradiction. In contrast Royce offers as his hypothesis that “to be is to be uniquely related to a whole”. This formulation preserves all three crucial aspects of being, namely the Whole, the individual, and the relation that constitutes them. Where previously Royce&#x27;s hypotheses about ontology had taken for granted that relations are discovered in the analysis of terms, here he moves to the recognition that terms are constituted by their relations, and insofar as terms are taken to refer to entities, as we must assume, we are obliged to think about individuals as uniquely constituted by a totality of relations to other individuals and to the Whole that are theirs alone. In the Second Series of Gifford Lectures Royce temporalizes these relations, showing that we learn to think about ideas like succession and space by noting differences and directionality within unified and variable “timespans”, or qualitative, durational episodes of the “specious present”. Royce explains, “our temporal form of experience is thus peculiarly the form of the Will as such”. (&quot;The World and the Individual, Second Series&quot;, p. 124)

Hence, for Royce, the will is the inner dynamism that reaches beyond itself into a possible future and acts upon an acknowledged past. Space and the abstract descriptions that are appropriate to it are a falsification of this dynamism, and metaphysical error, especially “realism”, proceeds from taking these abstractions literally. Philosophy itself proceeds along descriptive lines and therefore must offer its ontology as a kind of fiction. But ideas, considered dynamically, temporally instead of spatially, in light of what they do in the world of practice and qualities, do have temporal forms and are activities. The narrative presentation of ideas, such as belongs to the World of Appreciation, is “more easily effective than description...for space furnishes indeed the stage and the scenery of the universe, but the world’s play occurs in time”. (&quot;WI2&quot;, pp. 124–125). Time conceived abstractly in the World of Description, although it can never be wholly spatialized, provides us with an idea of eternity, while time lived and experienced grounds this description (and every other), historically, ethically, and aesthetically. Since philosophy proceeds descriptively rather than narratively, “the real world of our Idealism has to be viewed by us men as a temporal order”, in which “purposes are fulfilled, or where finite internal meanings reach their final expression and attain unity with external meanings”.

Hence, for Royce, it is a limitation of conceptual thought that obliges us to philosophize according to logic rather than integrating our psychological and appreciated experience into our philosophical doctrines. There is ample evidence for supposing a parallelism between our conceptual and perceptual experiences, and for using the former as a guide to the latter, according to Royce, particularly with regard to the way that the idealization of our inner purposes enables us to connect them with the purposes of others in a larger whole of which we have no immediate experience. We can appreciate the sense of fulfillment we find in serving a larger whole and form our characters progressively upon the ways in which those experiences of fulfillment point us outwards, beyond the finite self, but we are not so constitute as to experience the greater Whole to which our experiences belong. We cannot help supposing that there is some experiencer within whose inner life the Whole exists, but only the inevitability of the assumption and not any experiential content assures us of the reality of such an experiencer.

===The philosophy of loyalty===
This social metaphysics lays the groundwork for Royce&#x27;s philosophy of loyalty. The book of this title published in 1908 derived from lectures given at the Lowell Institute, at Yale, Harvard, and at the University of Illinois in 1906–07. The basic ideas were explicit in his writings as early as his history of California. Here Royce set out one of the most original and important moral philosophies in the recent history of philosophy.

His notion of “loyalty” was essentially a universalized and ecumenical interpretation of Christian agapic love. Broadly speaking, Royce&#x27;s is a virtue ethic in which our loyalty to increasingly less immediate ideals becomes the formative moral influence in our personal development. As persons become increasingly able to form loyalties, the practical and ongoing devotion to a cause bigger than themselves, and as these loyalties become unifiable in the higher purposes of groups of persons over many generations, humanity is increasingly better able to recognize that the highest ideal is the creation of a perfected “beloved community” in which each and every person shares. The beloved community as an ideal experienced in our acts of loyal service integrates into Royce&#x27;s moral philosophy a Kingdom of Ends, but construed as immanent and operative instead of transcendental and regulative.

While the philosophical status of this ideal remains hypothetical, the living of it in the fulfillment of our finite purposes concretizes it for each and every individual. Each of us, no matter how morally undeveloped we may be, has fulfilled experiences that point to the reality of experience beyond what is given to us personally. This wider reality is exemplified most commonly by when we fall in love. The “spiritual union [of the lovers] also has a personal, a conscious existence, upon a higher than human level. An analogous unity of consciousness, a unity superhuman in grade, but intimately bound up with, and inclusive of, our separate personalities, must exist, if loyalty is well founded, wherever a real cause wins the true devotion of ourselves. Grant such an hypothesis, and then loyalty becomes no pathetic serving of a myth. The good which our causes possesses, then, also becomes a concrete fact for an experience of a higher than human level”. (&quot;The Philosophy of Loyalty&quot;, p. 311).

This move illustrates what Royce calls his “absolute pragmatism”, the claim that ideals are thoroughly practical—the more inclusive being more practical. The concretization of ideals cannot therefore be empirically doubted except at the cost of rendering our conscious life inexplicable. If we admit that the concretization of ideals genuinely occurs, Royce argues, then we are not only entitled but compelled to take seriously and regard as real the larger intelligible structures within which those ideals exist, which is the purposive character of the divine Will. The way in which persons sort out higher and lower causes is by examining whether one&#x27;s service destroys the loyalty of others, or what is best in them. Ultimately personal character reaches its acme in the recognition that service of lost causes, through which we may learn that our ultimate loyalty is to loyalty itself.

Some recent scholarship on Royce has framed his philosophy of loyalty as being based on racist theories of assimilation and conquest. Tommy J. Curry argues that previous generations of Royce scholars have ignored the historical context and primary texts Josiah Royce used to develop his theories of racial contact. Curry writes that Royce was widely read as both an imperialist and an anti-Black racist by his contemporaries. Other American philosophers such as John Moffatt Mecklin, a pragmatist and a segregationist, openly challenged Josiah Royce&#x27;s views of race and the Negro. Mecklin insisted that Royce&#x27;s theories suggested that while white Anglos had a racial gift and duty to lead the world towards the ideal, the Negro had no special gift and as such could have their racial traits destroyed through assimilation.

===The problem of Christianity===
The final phase of Royce&#x27;s thought involved the application and further illustration of the concepts he had defended since 1881. Some have seen here a fundamental shift in Royce&#x27;s thinking but the evidence is far from conclusive. Royce&#x27;s hypothetical ontology, temporalism, personalism, his social metaphysics based on the fourth conception of being remain, along with the operation of agapic loyalty, and the unity of finite purposes in the ideal of the beloved community. There is no obvious shift in method and no overt move to abandon idealism. Royce himself declared the “successive expressions” of the philosophy of loyalty “form a consistent body of ethical as well as religious opinion and teaching, verifiable, in its main outlines, in terms of human experience, and capable of furnishing a foundation for a defensible form of metaphysical idealism”. (&quot;The Problem of Christianity&quot;, Vol. 1, p. ix)

Royce never was an old-style absolutist in either method or ontology but there were those among his peers who only came to recognize this in his later thought. Some of these believed he had changed his view in some fundamental way. Royce&#x27;s ethics and religious philosophy certainly matured, but the basic philosophical framework did not shift. Having provided throughout his career an idealistic way of grasping the Will, in contrast to Schopenhauer&#x27;s pessimistic treatment, it remained for Royce to rescue Pauline Christianity, in its universalized and modernized form, from the critique of Nietzsche and others who tended to understand will in terms of power and who had claimed that the historic doctrine was no longer believable to the modern mind. Striking in this work is the temporal account of the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church and the communion of saints as a universal community. This community is a process of mutually interpretive activity which requires shared memory and hope. In seeking to show the reality of the invisible community, perhaps Royce was seeking communion with his departed son Christopher and his close friend William James, both of whom had died in 1910. Royce kept these and other personal tragedies far from the text of his published work, but the grieving certainly affected and deepened his insight and perhaps exaggerated the quality of his hope.

Two key influences on the thought of Royce were Charles Sanders Peirce and William James. In fact, it can be argued that a major way Peirce&#x27;s ideas entered the American academy is through Royce&#x27;s teaching and writing, and eventually that of his students. Peirce also reviewed Royce&#x27;s &quot;The Religious Aspect of Philosophy&quot; (1885). Some have claimed that Peirce also supervised Royce&#x27;s Ph.D., but that is impossible as Peirce arrived at Johns Hopkins in 1879.

==Logic==
Royce influenced the Harvard school of logic, Boolean algebra, and foundations of mathematics. His own logic, philosophy of logic, and philosophy of mathematics were influenced by Charles Peirce and Alfred Kempe.

Students who learned logic at Royce&#x27;s feet include Clarence Irving Lewis, who went on to pioneer modal logic, Edward Vermilye Huntington, the first to axiomatize Boolean algebra, and Henry M. Sheffer, known for his eponymous stroke. Many of Royce&#x27;s writings on logic and mathematics are critical of the extensional logic of &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;, by Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead, and can be read as an alternative to their approach. Many of his writings on logic and scientific method, are reproduced in &quot;Royce&quot; (1951, 1961).

==Psychology==
Royce&#x27;s philosophy of man as the product of the interrelationship of individual ego and social other laid the foundations for the writings of George Herbert Mead.

Royce saw the self as the product of a process of social interaction. Royce wrote: &quot;In origin, then, the empirical Ego is secondary to our social experiences. In literal social life, the Ego is always known in contrast to the Alter&quot;.

He also considered that the social self could itself become diseased, seeing delusions of grandeur or persecution as distortions of everyday self-consciousness, with its concern for social standing and reflected place in the world.

Royce was involved with the American Society for Psychical Research, and researched telepathy. In 1889 he served as Vice-President of the society.

Erving Goffman considered that his pioneering work of 1895 on the distortions in the subjective sense of self which take place in the grandiosity of mania was unsurpassed three quarters of a century later.

<text>The Volkstheater Millowitsch, also known as the &quot;Millowitsch-Theater&quot;, was a medium-sized theatre in Cologne, Germany where popular, low-brow comedies were performed.

== History ==
The Millowitsch family had been active in theatre before ownership of this building with a tradition dating back to 1792. With the onset of the Great Depression and the ensuing inflation, Peter Millowitsch was forced to abandon the family’s old theatre and tour Cologne and the surrounding area, until in 1936 they finally moved into the new theatre in &quot;Aachener Straße&quot;.

In 1940 Willy Millowitsch took charge of the theatre. During World War II it was damaged, but not too severely, so on September 16, 1945, the theatre was reopened. In the time from 1945–1949 there were daily performances in the theatre, but afterwards the attendance dropped and Millowitsch had to rent out the theatre sometimes. Fortunately, the building doubled as a cinema, so he could still make money with it.

The first live broadcast of a theatrical performance in front of a real audience on German television took place in this theatre. On October 27, 1953 Willy Millowitsch’s Kölsch dialect play &quot;Der Etappenhas&quot; was broadcast on the Western regional channel WDR. It was immensely successful and just six weeks later was broadcast again, live, from the &quot;Millowitsch-Theater&quot;. Over the course of the years, over one hundred performances from the &quot;Volkstheater Millowitsch&quot; were shown on television.

The television plays spawned interest in theatre and the audiences gradually grew and by the 1960s a steady flow of people were teeming in to see Millowitsch’s plays firsthand. He renovated the building in 1967 and the Volkstheater once again became a focal point of local culture. Changing his original concept, Millowitsch turned the theatre from a house just for plays into a venue for local performances of all kinds. Many young dialect artists started their careers there, including the now famous singing groups Bläck Fööss and Höhner.

In 1998 only few months before Willy Millowitsch’s death in 1999, his son Peter Millowitsch took over the running of the establishment.

== Location ==
The &quot;Millowitsch-Theater&quot; is located at &quot;Aachener Straße&quot; 5, near the Hahnentor and &quot;Rudolfplatz&quot; in the centre of Cologne, just by the tramline. It is a medium-sized theatre that can seat up to 383 people. Ticket prices usually range from €19 – €24.

<text>Marisa dos Reis Nunes (born 16 December 1973), known professionally as Mariza (), is a Portuguese fado singer.

Mariza was born in Lourenço Marques, Portuguese Mozambique, to a Portuguese father, José Brandão Nunes, and a Mozambican mother, Isabel Nunes. When she was three years old, her family moved to Metropolitan Portugal, and she was raised in Lisbon&#x27;s historic quarters of Mouraria and Alfama. While very young, she began singing in a wide variety of musical styles, including gospel, soul and jazz. Her father strongly encouraged her to adopt fado; he felt that participating in the traditional music would grant her greater acceptance in the Portuguese community. Mariza has sold over 1 million records worldwide.

==Music career==
In 1999, fado&#x27;s most famous and beloved interpreter, Amália Rodrigues died. In the public remembrance and mourning that followed, fado regained much of its previous popularity, and Mariza was asked to perform a broadcast tribute to Rodrigues&#x27; memory, which caused her friends to begin urging her to record an album of fado music. She did so, and in 2001 &quot;Fado em Mim&quot; was released. It sold an astounding 100,000 copies (4,000 copies of a fado disc would have been considered successful). After this the record company made the disc available worldwide, and sales eventually topped 140,000 copies.

One of Mariza&#x27;s hit songs, &quot;Transparente&quot; is a tribute to her African grandmother.

Mariza sang the Portuguese national anthem at the 2002 FIFA World Cup of football, at the game which pitted the home team (South Korea) against Portugal.

By the time Mariza&#x27;s second album, &quot;Fado Curvo&quot;, was released in 2003, she was considered a member of the &quot;New Fado&quot; movement, with a voice reminiscent of traditional divas of the musical form such as Rodrigues. Her interpretations of fado standards brought her rapid international recognition, leading to her being the recipient, in March 2003, of BBC Radio 3&#x27;s award for &quot;Best European Artist in World Music&quot;. Her British television debut was on &quot;Later with Jools Holland&quot;. For the Olympic Games of Athens 2004 she sang &quot;A Thousand Years,&quot; as a duet with Sting. It was released on the official pop album of the Athens Olympics, &quot;Unity&quot;, on which fado is sung in English and Portuguese.
In 2004 Mariza won an EBBA Award. Every year the European Border Breakers Awards (EBBA) recognize the success of ten emerging artists or groups who reached audiences outside their own countries with their first internationally released album in the past year.

Mariza&#x27;s third album, &quot;Transparente&quot;, was recorded in Brazil and released in 2005. She performed at Live 8; she sang at the Eden Project in Cornwall, after which she has been invited to concerts and events worldwide to promote Portuguese culture, from Australia to Finland, the United States and Argentina. That album eventually reached Top Ten in countries which include The Netherlands, Spain and Finland. Mariza, who lives in the upmarket Alcântara dockside area of Lisbon, has received awards from Denmark, Australia, Canada, Germany, UK, Guinea-Bissau and Equatorial Guinea.

She has performed at venues such as New York&#x27;s Carnegie Hall and Central Park, Walt Disney Concert Hall, Barbican, Hollywood Bowl, London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall, Union Chapel, Royal Festival Hall, Lisbon&#x27;s Centro Cultural de Belém, Frankfurt&#x27;s Alte Oper, Paris&#x27; Théâtre de la Ville, Madrid&#x27;s Teatro Albéniz, Barcelona&#x27;s Teatro Grec, X Cairo International Song Festival 2004, Centro Cultural de Macau, Moscow International House of Music, Toronto&#x27;s Massey Hall, Sydney Opera House and the National Concert Hall in Dublin in February 2010.

Her album released in 2007 &quot;Concerto em Lisboa&quot; received a Latin Grammy nomination for Best Folk Album. The following year, she again released an album, &quot;Terra&quot; which also was nominated for Best Folk Album at the Latin Grammy Awards. This album continued to mix a variety of genres, containing basic fado influenced by jazz, flamenco, Latin and African sounds.

In 2010, Mariza was featured in the pilot episode of the PBS music series, &quot;Sound Tracks: Music Without Borders&quot;, singing the &quot;global hit&quot; -- &quot;Minh&#x27; Alma.&quot; In 2010, Mariza released the album &quot;Fado Tradicional&quot;, returning to the roots of Fado, but also interpreting the music in Mariza&#x27;s unique style.

Beginning on 28 February 2011 the airline TAP Portugal began airing its &quot;TAP With Arms Wide Open&quot; (TAP de Braços Abertos) campaign, featuring its new slogan. Three singers, Mariza, the Brazilian singer Roberta de Sá, and the Angolan singer Paulo Flores starred in a music video with the song &quot;Arms Wide Open.&quot;

Mariza performed alongside Ana Moura as the opening act of the Grand Final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2018 held in Lisbon, Portugal, singing &quot;Barco Negro&quot;.

In May 2024, Mariza released the single &quot;Desamor&quot; (featuring GSon), from her forthcoming album &quot;Amor&quot;.

==Personal life==
Mariza was married to António Ferreira, father of the singer&#x27;s first and only child, Martim, born on 6 July 2011 two months ahead of schedule, and later diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Mariza said that her Catholic faith strengthened as a result of a promise that she made to Our Lady of Fátima, after the birth of her son.

<text>Carol Elizabeth Heiss Jenkins (born January 20, 1940) is an American former figure skater and actress. Competing in ladies&#x27; singles, she became the 1960 Olympic champion, the 1956 Olympic silver medalist, and a five-time World champion (1956–1960).

== Early life ==
Carol Elizabeth Heiss was born January 20, 1940 in New York City, and grew up in Ozone Park, Queens. Her father Edward was a baker and her mother Marie was a homemaker. Both her parents were German immigrants. 

She started skating at six years old. Her younger sister and brother, Nancy Heiss and Bruce Heiss, were also elite figure skating competitors. During the 1950s, the three skating Heiss siblings were featured in publications such as &quot;Life&quot; magazine.

==Career==
===Competitive===
After some early victories in regional youth skating, she came to national prominence in 1951, when she won the U.S. novice ladies&#x27; title at age 11. Coached by Pierre Brunet, she won the junior women&#x27;s singles title at the national championships in 1952.

She moved up to the senior level in 1953. From 1953 to 1956, she finished second to Tenley Albright at the national championships. She competed with a slashed Achilles&#x27; tendon at the 1954 U.S. Championships.

Heiss was named in the U.S. team to the 1956 Winter Olympics in Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo, Italy. She won the silver medal, while Albright took the gold. However, at the following World Championships, in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, West Germany, Heiss defeated Albright for the title; it was the first of her five consecutive world titles.

After the 1956 Winter Olympics, Heiss had offers to turn professional and skate in ice shows. But her mother, Marie Heiss, was quite ill with cancer at the time, and before her death in October 1956, she asked Carol to win a gold medal for her. Between 1957 and 1960, Heiss dominated women&#x27;s figure skating like nobody since Sonja Henie. She was the World and U.S. Champion each year, and at the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley, California, Heiss captured the gold medal, being ranked first by all nine judges. She also took the Olympic Oath as representative of the organizing country to open the 1960 games. She was coached by Pierre Brunet. By winning the 1960 World Championships held after the Olympics, Heiss became one of three women to have won five consecutive World Championships. She then retired from competitive skating.

In 1953, Heiss became the first female skater to land a double Axel jump. One of her trademarks was performing a series of alternating clockwise and counterclockwise single Axels. She normally rotated her jumps clockwise and spins counterclockwise; it is much more common for skaters to do both in the same direction (usually counterclockwise).

Heiss was inducted into the World Figure Skating Hall of Fame and the United States Figure Skating Hall of Fame.

===Post-competitive===
Heiss played the female lead in the 1961 film &quot;Snow White and the Three Stooges&quot;. In the late 1970s, she began coaching in Lakewood, Ohio. Her former students include Timothy Goebel, Tonia Kwiatkowski, and Miki Ando.

==Personal life==
During her competitive career, Heiss attended New York University, graduating after the 1960 Winter Olympics. In 1961, she married American figure skater Hayes Alan Jenkins, who had won the 1956 Olympic gold medal. They have three children together.

<text>The Yeomanry Mounted Division was a Territorial Force cavalry division formed at Khan Yunis in Palestine in June 1917 from three yeomanry mounted brigades. It served in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the First World War, mostly as part of the Desert Mounted Corps. In April 1918 six of the regiments were withdrawn from the division and sent to France, being converted from Yeomanry to battalions of the Machine Gun Corps. These were replaced by Indian Army cavalry regiments withdrawn from France, and the division was renamed 1st Mounted Division, the third such division to bear that title. In July the combined division was renamed as the [[4th Cavalry Division (British Indian Army)|4th Cavalry Division]].

==History==
===Formation===
In June 1917, it was decided to reorganize the mounted troops of the Desert Column into three divisions. Previously, the two existing divisions (ANZAC Mounted Division and Imperial Mounted Division) each contained four mounted brigades; hereafter, the three divisions would have three mounted brigades each. As a result, between 20 June and 22 July 1917, the Yeomanry Mounted Division was formed at Khan Yunis, Palestine.
* the 6th Mounted Brigade was transferred complete from the Imperial Mounted Division on 27 June 1917, joining the new division at el Maraqeb. On 20 June, the Imperial Mounted Division was redesignated Australian Mounted Division as the majority of its units were now Australian.
* the 8th Mounted Brigade arrived back in Egypt from Salonika on 8 June 1917. The Machine Gun Squadron was formed in Egypt on 14 June. The brigade moved forward and joined the new division on 21 July 1917 at el Fuqari.
* the 22nd Mounted Brigade was transferred complete from the ANZAC Mounted Division on 6 July 1917, joining the new division at el Fuqari.
* the CCLXIII (V Lowland) Brigade, RFA from 52nd (Lowland) Division joined as XX Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery (T.F.) (less Essex Battery, RHA which was attached to 7th Mounted Brigade) on 7 July 1917 at Khan Yunis. On the same date, the Berkshire Battery, RHA (formerly of the Imperial Mounted Division) and the Leicestershire Battery, RHA (formerly of the ANZAC Mounted Division) joined XX Brigade.
* the Field Squadron Royal Engineers was newly formed at el Maraqeb between 1 and 22 July 1917.
* the signal squadron was newly formed at Alexandria between 29 May and 11 July 1917. It joined the division at Khan Yunis on 14 July.

===Battles===
The Yeomanry Mounted Division served as part of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force in Palestine throughout its brief existence. From 31 October it took part in the Third Battle of Gaza, including the Battle of Beersheba (in GHQ Reserve) and the Capture of the Sheria Position under the Desert Mounted Corps (DMC). Still with the DMC, it took part in the Battle of Mughar Ridge on 13 and 14 November and the Battle of Nebi Samwil for 17 to 24 November. From 23 November it was attached to XXI Corps. From 27 to 29 November, it withstood the Turkish counter-attacks during the Capture of Jerusalem. From 28 November it was attached to XX Corps.

===Restructured and renamed===
In March 1918, the 1st Indian Cavalry Division was broken up in France. The British units (notably 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons, 17th Lancers, 1/1st Queen&#x27;s Own Yorkshire Dragoons and A, Q and U Batteries RHA) remained in France and the Indian elements were sent to Egypt.

By an Egyptian Expeditionary Force GHQ Order of 12 April 1918, the mounted troops of the EEF were reorganised when the Indian Army units arrived in theatre. On 24 April 1918, the Yeomanry Mounted Division was &quot;indianized&quot; and its title was changed to 1st Mounted Division, the third distinct division to bear this title.

On 24 April 1918, the 6th Mounted Brigade was merged with elements of the 5th (Mhow) Cavalry Brigade, the 8th Mounted Brigade with the 8th (Lucknow) Cavalry Brigade, and the 22nd Mounted Brigade with the 2nd (Sialkot) Cavalry Brigade. Six of the Yeomanry Regiments were merged in pairs, converted to Machine Gun Battalions, and posted to the Western Front:
*C Battalion, Machine Gun Corps was formed by the merger of the 1/1st Royal Buckinghamshire Hussars and the 1/1st Berkshire Yeomanry
*D Battalion, Machine Gun Corps was formed by the merger of the 1/1st Lincolnshire Yeomanry and the 1/1st East Riding of Yorkshire Yeomanry 
*E Battalion, Machine Gun Corps was formed by the merger of the 1/1st City of London Yeomanry (Rough Riders) and the 1/3rd County of London Yeomanry (Sharpshooters) 
They were replaced by Indian Cavalry Regiments from France. The Field Ambulances and Mobile Veterinary Sections merged with their Indian counterparts. Other units were retained unchanged, though some were renumbered to reflect the new divisional designation.

On 22 July 1918, the 1st Mounted Division was renumbered as the 4th Cavalry Division and the brigades as the 10th, 11th and 12th Cavalry Brigades. The sub units (Signal Troops, Combined Cavalry Field Ambulances and Mobile Veterinary Sections) were renumbered on the same date.

<doc id="494094" wikidata="Q2011812" url="?curid=494094" title="Objective idealism">
<text>Objective [[idealism]] is a philosophical theory that affirms the ideal and spiritual nature of the world and conceives of the idea of which the world is made as the objective and rational form in reality rather than as subjective content of the mind or mental representation. Objective idealism thus differs both from materialism, which holds that the external world is independent of cognizing minds and that mental processes and ideas are by-products of physical events, and from subjective idealism, which conceives of reality as totally dependent on the consciousness of the subject and therefore relative to the subject itself.

Objective idealism starts with Plato’s theory of forms, which maintains that objectively existing but non-material &quot;ideas&quot; give form to reality, thus shaping its basic building blocks.

Objective idealism has also been defined as a form of metaphysical idealism that accepts Naïve realism (the view that empirical objects exist objectively) but rejects epiphenomenalist materialism (according to which the mind and spiritual values have emerged due to material causes), as opposed to subjective idealism, which denies that material objects exist independently of human perception and thus stands opposed to both realism and naturalism.

== In German idealism ==
Within German idealism, objective idealism identifies with the philosophy of Friedrich Schelling. According to Schelling, the rational or spiritual elements of reality are supposed to give conceptual structure to reality and ultimately constitute reality, to the point that nature and mind, matter and concept, are essentially identical: their distinction is merely psychological and depends on our predisposition to distinguish the &quot;outside us&quot; (nature, world) from the &quot;in us&quot; (mind, spirit). Within that tradition of philosophical thought, the entire world manifests itself through ideas and is governed by purposes or ends: regardless of the existence of a self-conscious subject, all reality is a manifestation of reason.

== Charles Peirce ==
The philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce defined his own version of objective idealism as follows:

The one intelligible theory of the universe is that of objective idealism, that matter is effete mind, inveterate habits becoming physical laws (Peirce, CP 6.25).
By &quot;objective idealism&quot;, Peirce meant that material objects such as organisms have evolved out of mind, that is, out of feelings (&quot;such as pain, blue, cheerfulness&quot;) that are immediately present to consciousness. Contrary to Hegel, who identified mind with conceptual thinking or reason, Peirce identified it with feeling, and he claimed that at the origins of the world there was &quot;a chaos of unpersonalized feelings&quot;, i.e., feelings that were not located in any individual subject. Therefore, in the 1890s Peirce&#x27;s philosophy referred to itself as objective idealism because it held that the mind comes first and the world is essentially mind (idealism) and the mind is independent of individuals (objectivism).

<text>This is a list of tectonic plates on Earth&#x27;s surface. Tectonic plates are pieces of Earth&#x27;s crust and uppermost mantle, together referred to as the lithosphere. The plates are around thick and consist of two principal types of material: oceanic crust (also called &quot;sima&quot; from silicon and magnesium) and continental crust (&quot;sial&quot; from silicon and aluminium). The composition of the two types of crust differs markedly, with mafic basaltic rocks dominating oceanic crust, while continental crust consists principally of lower-density felsic granitic rocks.

==Current plates==
Geologists generally agree that the following tectonic plates currently exist on Earth&#x27;s surface with roughly definable boundaries. Tectonic plates are sometimes subdivided into three fairly arbitrary categories: &quot;major&quot; (or &quot;primary&quot;) &quot;plates&quot;, &quot;minor&quot; (or &quot;secondary&quot;) &quot;plates&quot;, and &quot;microplates&quot; (or &quot;tertiary plates&quot;).

===Major plates===
These plates comprise the bulk of the continents and the Pacific Ocean. For purposes of this list, a major plate is any plate with an area greater than 
* – 
* (sometimes considered to be two separate tectonic plates) – 
** –

===Minor plates===
These smaller plates are often not shown on major plate maps, as the majority of them do not comprise significant land area. For purposes of this list, a minor plate is any plate with an area less than but greater than .

===Microplates===
These plates are often grouped with an adjacent principal plate on a tectonic plate world map. For purposes of this list, a microplate is any plate with an area less than 1 million km2. Some models identify more minor plates within current orogens (events that lead to a large structural deformation of Earth&#x27;s lithosphere) like the Apulian, Explorer, Gorda, and Philippine Mobile Belt plates. The latest studies have shown that microplates are the basic elements of which the crust is composed and that the larger plates are composed of amalgamations of these, and a subdivision of ca. 1200 smaller plates has come forward.

==Ancient tectonic plates==
In the history of Earth, many tectonic plates have come into existence and have over the intervening years either accreted onto other plates to form larger plates, rifted into smaller plates, or have been crushed by or subducted under other plates.

The following is a list of ancient cratons, microplates, plates, and terranes which no longer exist as separate plates. &quot;Cratons&quot; are the oldest and most stable parts of the continental lithosphere, and &quot;shields&quot; are exposed parts of them. &quot;Terranes&quot; are fragments of crustal material formed on one tectonic plate and accreted to crust lying on another plate, which may or may not have originated as independent microplates: a terrane may not contain the full thickness of the lithosphere.

<doc id="494101" wikidata="Q466585" url="?curid=494101" title="American Railway Union">
<text>The American Railway Union (ARU) was briefly among the largest labor unions of its time and one of the first industrial unions in the United States. Launched at a meeting held in Chicago in February 1893, the ARU won an early victory in a strike on the Great Northern Railroad in the summer of 1894. This successful strike was followed by the bitter 1894 Pullman Strike in which government troops and the power of the judiciary were enlisted against the ARU, ending with the jailing of the union&#x27;s leadership for six months in 1895 and effectively crushing the organization. The group&#x27;s blacklisted and dispirited remnants finally disbanded the organization via amalgamation into the Social Democracy of America (SDA) at its founding convention in June 1897.

== Organizational history ==
=== Establishment ===
Volition for a formation of an industrial union uniting all branches of the railroad industry began in the early 1890s with the failure of an attempt at loose federation of several railway brotherhoods by Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen Secretary-Treasurer and &quot;Locomotive Firemen&#x27;s Magazine&quot; editor Eugene V. Debs. A new union bringing together all railway workers, regardless of craft or service, was constructed in a series of meetings held in Chicago, Illinois, beginning with a four-hour session held at the Leland Hotel on February 9 and 10, 1893. Headquarters for the new union were to be rented in Chicago.

This preparatory meeting, chaired by George W. Howard of Oshkosh, Wisconsin, former Grand Chief of the Brotherhood of Railway Conductors, elected a three-person committee to write a constitution and by-laws for the new organization, which was formally launched at a week-long convention attended by 24 delegates representing many of the numerous railway brotherhoods held at Chicago&#x27;s Greene Hotel from April 11–17, 1893. This gathering formally elected officers for the new union, including Debs as president, Howard as vice president and Sylvester Keliher (Secretary-Treasurer of the Brotherhood of Railway Carmen) as Secretary-Treasurer of the ARU.

Day-to-day governance was by these three officers as part of a nine-member Board of Directors, which also included W.S. Missemer of the Brotherhood of Railway Carmen, W.H. Sebring of the Order of Railroad Conductors, Frank W. Arnold of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, Henry Walton of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, James A. Clark of the Railway Telegraphers and Louis W. Rogers of the magazine &quot;Age of Labor.&quot;

A convention to introduce the new union to the broader public and to build organizational momentum was scheduled and held in Chicago on June 20, 1893. A mass meeting of railroad employees was held in conjunction with the gathering, meeting at Uhlich&#x27;s Hall in Chicago at 8 pm, where it was addressed by Eugene Debs and others.

=== Structure ===

The ARU was to be divided into 12 regional districts, each of which maintained a headquarters office in a local urban center. These districts were to in turn be subdivided, apparently on a state basis, with the organization to be governed by annual state conventions and a quadrennial national convention of the entire organization. These national conventions were to choose a governing Board of Directors for the organization and to elect officers.

Only one official national convention of the ARU was held; this convened at Fisher&#x27;s Hall in Chicago at 10 o&#x27;clock on the morning of June 12, 1894. About 400 delegates were in attendance—too many for the venue, which caused the gathering to be immediately moved after convocation to the more spacious room at Uhlich&#x27;s Hall. There the assembled delegates heard a lengthy keynote address delivered by ARU President Gene Debs before adjourning for additional meetings in secret session.

=== Great Northern Railway strike ===
Beginning in August 1893, the Great Northern Railway enacted a series of wage cuts for its workers, reductions amounting to $146,500 per month. The American Railway Union organized all classes of employees of the road in a strike action lasting 18 days and forcing the company to arbitration of its unilateral wage cuts.

The arbitrators, consisting of businessmen from St. Paul and Minneapolis, Minnesota, found in favor of the Great Northern workers, thereby pressuring the company to roll back its wage cuts. It was the ARU&#x27;s first and only victory.

=== Pullman Strike ===

Buoyed by the success of the Great Northern strike, railway workers on other lines sought similar redress of their grievances through strike action. Debs and other union officials were concerned that other disruptions were inopportune, with the union needing a brief respite to better organize itself and to restore its finances. However, this was not to be because on May 11, 1894, the workers of the Pullman Palace Car Company launched a wildcat strike against their employer.

The Pullman Company had begun a company town on the outskirts of Chicago called Pullman, Illinois, incorporated into the city of Chicago in 1889. The company and town were namesakes of its millionaire owner, George Pullman. The town of Pullman was his &quot;utopia&quot;. He owned the land, homes and stores. Workers had to live in his homes and buy from his stores, thereby ensuring virtually all wages returned directly back into his pockets.

Although initially opposed to the strike, Debs responded to notice of the strike of the Pullman workers by traveling to Chicago to investigate the situation in person. Debs later recalled in sworn testimony:I found that the wages and expenses of the employees were so adjusted that every dollar the employees earned found its way back into the Pullman coffers; that they were not only not getting wages enough to live on, but that they were daily getting deeper into the debt of the Pullman company; that it was impossible for many of them to leave there at all... Wages had been reduced, but the expenses remained the same, and no matter how offensive the conditions were they were compelled to submit to them. After I heard those statements I satisfied myself that they were true and I made up my mind, as president of the American Railway Union, of which these employees were members, to do everything in my power that was within law and within justice to right the wrongs of those employees.

An effort was made by the ARU to engage the Pullman Company and its workers in arbitration, but the officers of the company refused to submit to the proposal, instead claiming that they had nothing to arbitrate. Railway workers had lost confidence in the existing network of craft-based railway brotherhoods—which were essentially fraternal benefit societies—to resist an industry-wide wage reduction campaign coordinated by the railway managers&#x27; association and looked to the fledgling ARU as a mechanism to stem the tide. Sympathy for the Pullman Company workers was widespread among other workers in the railroad industry.

The ARU&#x27;s constitutionally-required biannual convention was forthcoming and delegates representing the 465 locals of the union—which claimed a total membership of about 150,000—assembled in the city to take up matters of concern to the organization. During the course of the proceedings, the situation of the Pullman workers came before the assembly, which appointed a committee of Pullman employees to study the situation.

On June 21, 1894, two days prior to adjournment of the convention, the Pullman Committee reported that the company continued to refuse to arbitrate its unilateral wage cuts. The committee recommended that an ultimatum be delivered that unless the Pullman Company began arbitration within 5 days, a boycott of railroad workers should be launched under which no member of the ARU would handle a train to which Pullman cars were attached. After discussion this proposal was accepted by majority vote of the convention and a strike deadline was scheduled for June 26.

The June 26 deadline came and still the Pullman Company refused to arbitrate its wage reductions. Railway employees began to refuse to handle trains pulling Pullman cars. The ARU established temporary strike headquarters in Chicago to keep more closely abreast of the situation. Chicago became a constant mass of meetings as workers of the various railway crafts gathered to discuss the strike situation. The railway switchmen were the first to act, refusing to attach Pullman cars to trains. When one switchman would be fired for insubordination, all the others in the shop would quit, in accord with a previously agreed upon plan.

The railway managers took to the courts for relief, gaining a sweeping injunction against the ARU which was served upon union president Debs on July 2. Terms of the injunction prohibited the union from sending out any telegram or letter or issuing any order which would have the effect of inducing or persuading railroad workers to withhold their service in pursuit of the strike action.
The rationale for this legal action lay in the fact that the Mail was transported by rail—transport which was interrupted when trains including Pullman cars were stopped in their tracks. Under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890, which ruled it illegal for any business combination to restrain trade or commerce, an injunction was issued on July 2 enjoining the ARU leadership from &quot;compelling or inducing by threats, intimidation, persuasion, force or violence, railway employees to refuse or fail to perform their duties&quot;. The next day, President Cleveland ordered 20,000 federal troops to crush the strike and run the railways.

=== Transition to a political party ===
By July 7, Debs and ten other ARU leaders were arrested and later tried and convicted for conspiracy to halt the free flow of mail. The strike was finally crushed while the board and president spent six months in prison in Woodstock, Illinois. Pullman reopened with all labor union leaders sacked.

During Debs&#x27; time in jail, he spent much of his time reading the literary works of Karl Marx and socialist texts brought to jail by Victor L. Berger. After Debs got out of jail, he merged the ARU with the Brotherhood of the Co-operative Commonwealth to form the Social Democracy of America (SDA). In 1900, Elliott ran for Congressman in Montana and Debs ran for President heading the SDA ticket. Elliott was later elected to the Montana Legislature while Debs ran unsuccessfully four more times for the presidency as a socialist.

<doc id="494109" wikidata="Q16931641" url="?curid=494109" title="Lytle family">
<text>The Lytle family was a prominent American family that played significant roles in the settlement and development of Kentucky and Ohio from the late 18th to the mid-19th centuries. The family&#x27;s prominence began with Captain William Lytle (1728–1797), who led settlers to Kentucky in 1780. His son, William Lytle II (1770–1831), became the first landed millionaire in the West and founded Cincinnati College and Cincinnati Law College. The family produced several notable figures, including William Haines Lytle (1826–1863), a lawyer, poet, and Brigadier General who died in the American Civil War. Lytles served in various conflicts, including the French and Indian War, the American Revolutionary War, the Mexican–American War, and the Civil War. The family&#x27;s influence extended to politics, with members such as Robert Todd Lytle serving in the United States Congress. Their legacy is commemorated in Cincinnati&#x27;s Lytle Park Historic District, which includes the site of the former Lytle mansion, donated to the city in 1903.
==Captain William Lytle==

Captain William Lytle (1728–97), son of Christopher Lytle, 1693–1783, from Cumberland County. Pa. served in the British army in the French and Indian War and was deeded of land for service in the Revolutionary War. He solicited settlers to follow him with the promise of land in Kentucky, then part of Virginia. In April 1780, Capt. Lytle and his family led 63 Kentucky flatboats of settlers accompanied by 1,000 fighting men, down the Ohio to the falls of the Ohio. They passed the future site of Cincinnati April 11 where they attacked and chased an Indian party which escaped on horseback. (Lytle, William. &quot;Personal Narrative of William Lytle.&quot; Quarterly Publication of the Historical and Philosophical Society of Ohio 1 (January–March 1906): 3-30.) (Centennial History of Cincinnati, p. 120) They continued on to Beargrass Creek (the site of Louisville), landing on April 15, 1780. Lytle made his permanent home near Lexington, Ky, in August, 1787.

Three Lytle relatives were named Surveyor General of the Northwest Territory, based in Cincinnati after 1808. Family members included William Lytle II, the Surveyor General of Illinois, Congressman Robert Todd Lytle (a relative of the Todd-Lincoln family), Brig. Gen. William Haines Lytle (the poet), and members of the Livingood family. Captain Lytle (1728–97) gave land to his daughter Anne for a wedding gift on which she and her husband, Judge John Rowan, built the Federal Hill Mansion, in Bardstown, Kentucky, which, according to tradition, inspired the song &quot;My Old Kentucky Home&quot;.

==William Lytle==

His son, William Lytle (1770–1831), amassed a fortune surveying the lands of Revolutionary War veterans granted land in Ohio, and was a good friend of Andrew Jackson, serving in his &quot;kitchen cabinet&quot;. Considered the first landed millionaire in the West, Lytle lost most of his money during a financial panic when western landowners could not pay their debts and the banks in Cincinnati failed. Using the land from his father&#x27;s land grant, he founded Cincinnati College and Cincinnati Law College (the University of Cincinnati). He funded it with $500 of his personal money, land donated by his father William Lytle, and $500 he solicited from a group of prominent first citizens of Cincinnati (John H. Piatt, David E. Wade, Ethan Stone, William Corry, John H. Lytle, Gen. James Findlay, Andrew Mack, Jacob Burnet). Each shareholder took turns serving on the Board of the Cincinnati College.

As a lad of only sixteen, William rode with Colonel (later General) Benjamin Logan on his famed &quot;Logan&#x27;s Raid,&quot; a punitive expedition against the Shawnee villages located near the headwaters of the Great Miami and Mad Rivers in west central Ohio in October, 1786. Lytle later penned his eyewitness account of the raid, and of the brutal murder of the great Shawnee chief Moluntha by Colonel Hugh McGary which Lytle himself attempted unsuccessfully to thwart.

The Lytles served in the French and Indian War, the American Revolutionary War, the Mexican–American War, and the Civil War.

==William Haines Lytle==

Brigadier Gen. William Haines Lytle (1826–1863) was a lawyer, educated man and syndicated poet (in newspapers). His poems spoke of courage, loss, the glory of war and tales of gallantry. He led the Irish troops (the most recent immigrants to the U.S.) and was so admired by his troops that six weeks before his death they presented him with a medal to show their affection. His most famous poem, &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, was beloved by both North and South in antebellum America and regularly memorized by school children in the U.S. through the 1940s. General William Haines Lytle died leading a charge at Chickamauga in the Civil War. Lytle Hill, in Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park, is named for him and a monument in the shape of a pile of cannonballs marks the spot where he fell. When he was shot, he fell from his horse with a half-finished poem in his pocket. A southern soldier who served with him in the Mexican–American War, stood guard over his body until arrangements could be made to return his body to the North. A Guard of Honor composed of fifteen officers and men from the 10th Ohio Volunteer Infantry was appointed to escort Lytle&#x27;s body from Chickamauga to Cincinnati. Under a flag of truce, both southern and northern soldiers escorted his body to Louisville where it was loaded on a paddle-wheeler and returned to Cincinnati. Since most soldiers were buried where they fell in the Civil War, few bodies were returned to their families. The city immediately went into mourning with all the windows of the stores draped in black. His horse, Fallaballaugh, another gift from his troops, led a parade down 4th street, with Lytle&#x27;s boots turned backwards in the stirrups to represent a riderless horse. A long line of dignitaries followed the coffin.

A branch of this family settled to the north in Butler County, where Judge Robert Lytle acquired a section of land from the U.S. and named it Milford Township. Prominent descendants include Sen. Homer Truett Bone, Secretary of Agriculture Claude R. Wickard, Gov. Andrew L. Harris, James McBride of Hamilton, and others.

Lytle Park, where the Lytle mansion was located, was donated to the city in 1903 by the family, with terms that it remain a park in perpetuity. When an expressway needed to be built downtown, the terms forced the Lytle Tunnel to be built under the park to preserve it. The statue of Abraham Lincoln at the entrance of the park was commissioned by the WPA Works Progress Administration.

<doc id="494137" wikidata="Q483226" url="?curid=494137" title="Coming of Age Day">
<text>is a public holiday in Japan held annually on the second Monday of January under the Happy Monday System. It is held in order to congratulate and encourage all those who have already reached the age of maturity between April 2 of the previous year and April 1 of the current year, and to help them realise that they have become adults. Festivities include held at local and prefectural offices, as well as after-parties among family and friends.

== Overview ==
On June 13, 2018, the age of maturity was lowered for the first time since it was established. According to the new law, which came into force in 2022, a citizen is considered an adult with the onset of full 18 years.
Note that Coming of Age Day and the ceremony itself are not directly linked to changes in the legal status of young people. For example, adult status becomes effective on the 18th birthday, with some exceptions; both men and women can marry and are released from parental authority. At the same time, they are released from the various family and social restrictions imposed on minors. As adults, they become eligible for contracting on their own. As before, drinking and smoking are allowed at age 20, and the right to vote and to obtain a driver&#x27;s license for passenger vehicles begins at age 18 (16 for motorcycles).

==History==
Coming of age ceremonies have been celebrated in Japan since at least 714 CE, during the reign of Empress Genmei when a young prince donned new robes and a hairstyle to mark his passage into adulthood.

Rituals to celebrate adulthood have existed since ancient times, such as &quot;Genpuku&quot; (changing to adult clothing) and &quot;Fundoshi-iwai&quot; (loincloth celebration) for boys and &quot;Mogi&quot; (dressing up) and &quot;Keppatsu&quot; (tying the hair up) for girls. Cultural anthropology and folklore studies treat such ceremonies as rites of passage (initiations).

===&quot;Genpuku&quot;===

 is a Japanese coming-of-age ceremony which dates back to Japan&#x27;s classical Nara period (710–794 AD).[1] This ceremony marked the transition from child to adult status and the assumption of adult responsibilities. The age of participation varied throughout history and depended on factors such as sex, political climate, and social status. Most participants were aristocratic children between the ages of 10 and 20, and most descriptions of &quot;genpuku&quot; focus on the male ceremony rather than the female ceremony due to the exclusion of women from politically important court positions and warrior status. Important changes in clothing and hairstyle typically denoted this transition, for both men and women. Youth and children were often synonymous, and a period of adolescence was not often present throughout the periods in which traditional &quot;genpuku&quot; flourished. The etymology of the word, which is atypical, reflects the major points of &quot;genpuku&quot; ceremonial format; in this case means &quot;head&quot; and means &quot;wearing&quot;. The ceremony is also known as , , , , and .

==== General ceremonial format ====
&quot;Genpuku&quot; was traditionally considered a major rite, an important ritual affecting life course in which a child exchanged his childhood status for an adult status, and continues from the Nara (710–794 AD) into the Tokugawa period (1603–1868). The ceremony was usually backed by an older society member of political importance, and included the exchange of a childhood name for a , the adoption of adult hairstyles and clothing, and the assumption of adult responsibilities. &quot;Genpuku&quot; was undergone by both males and females, but was differentiated by ceremonial dress, with men receiving signifying headgear such as a or samurai helmet and women receiving, instead, a . The population, and members of the population, participating in &quot;genpuku&quot; depended largely upon both which historical time period the ceremony took place in and the kind of government that was in place at the time. Specific ceremonial formats are built around specific constructions of class, rank, and time period.

==== Child roles as preparation for adult roles ====
Since aristocratic children between the ages of 10 and 20 took part in &quot;genpuku&quot; in order to assume adult status and responsibilities, the role of the aristocratic child was to prepare for adult life. For both male and female children, studies in the Heian period began between ages three and four, usually under the supervision of a wet nurse and perhaps her husband. Children of these ages were taught about key court ceremonies, Buddhist doctrine, and proper ethics. At the age of seven they moved on to more formal learning, specifically studying the skills needed to navigate court life and to succeed in court positions. Skills included, but were by no means limited to, handwriting and calligraphy, and were mainly an education requirement for male children; however, the education of girls was important as well. The ultimate goal of children, whether they were male or female, was to successfully carry on their family&#x27;s tradition and reputation. Proper education for girls was tied to successful or advantageous marriage, or their future ability to maintain a wealthy patron within the court.

==== Nara and Heian periods (710–1192) ====

The earliest official record of &quot;genpuku&quot; in Japan dates back to the Nara period (710–794 AD), and the ceremony itself is based on an earlier Chinese custom in the Tang dynasty. Beyond the Nara, the ceremony flourished throughout the aristocratic Heian period (794–1185 AD), the last classical period in which Japan was governed by an aristocratic court. Children during Heian were not recognized as officially gendered before &quot;genpuku&quot;, and were said to have remained near the gods as &quot;children of the kami&quot;. As children of the gods, those who had not undergone &quot;genpuku&quot; were often seen as youthful mediums and were some of the primary performers of ritual exorcisms. In addition, clothing and attire of childhood were ungendered and it was not uncommon for male children to wear makeup often as &quot;wakashū&quot;. In the period between early childhood and &quot;genpuku&quot;, boys were classified as &quot;wakashū&quot;.

During these periods, primarily male members of the aristocracy between the ages of seven and fifteen engaged in &quot;genpuku&quot;. The ceremony was generally a precursor to obtaining court cap and rank. Parents chose when to hold their children&#x27;s &quot;genpuku&quot; based on a number of factors, including the arrival of a suitable opportunity, the child&#x27;s readiness for court service, the presence of one or more influential court backers, and the parents&#x27; ability to finance the ceremony.

Once it was deemed an appropriate time for a child to undergo &quot;genpuku&quot;, a variety of preparations were made for the upcoming ceremony. The child had to acquire a &quot;capping parent&quot;, usually a person of influence, who would help the child don the ritual clothing of adulthood, most significantly a ceremonial court hat (&quot;kanmuri&quot;). Both the capping parent and the biological parents made preparations for the ceremony, but the capping parent was more active in making arrangements.

The &quot;genpuku&quot; ceremony itself almost always took place in the evening on a predetermined &quot;auspicious day&quot;, either at the residence of a &quot;kakan&quot; (dignitary) or at the Shishinden (Kyoto Imperial Palace). When the capping ceremony was held for the son of a Counselor or Consultant, the capping parent was most often a &quot;kakan&quot; and the ceremony took place at the &quot;kakan&quot;″s residence. When the ceremony was held for an Emperor or Crown prince, the current Emperor would sometimes cap the initiate within the Shishinden. The capping parent was joined by another important ceremonial participant, either the Nokan (if an Emperor was undergoing the ceremony) or a Rihatsu, who &quot;loosened the childhood coiffure, cut the ends of the hair, bound the head with a fillet, and otherwise prepared the boy to receive the cap&quot;. After the capping, the child retreated to a private room to exchange his ungendered wide-sleeved childhood robes for adult male robes. The transition from child to adult was complete, and feasting followed closely thereafter. &quot;Genpuku&quot; and adult status were accompanied by marriage eligibility, gendering, a removal from the male &quot;erotic gaze&quot; within court, the abandon of makeup use for males, and the opportunity to obtain court rank.

Girls engaged in &quot;genpuku&quot; as well, although the particular ceremonial rituals were more commonly referred to as &quot;mogi&quot;. For women, as for men, the ceremony revolved around the presentation of adult clothing; however, women were presented with a pleated skirt, not a court cap. Girls participating in &quot;mogi&quot; coming-of-age ceremonies traditionally blackened their teeth, shaved their eyebrows, and applied makeup. In addition, their long unbound hair was tied on top of their head in an adult hairstyle.

==== Age of the samurai (1185–1868) ====

In 1185 AD the aristocratic court government of classical Japan was forced to coexist with a warrior-administration, ushering in the Age of the Samurai. Just as the sons of aristocracy underwent the ceremony of &quot;genpuku&quot; to signify their adulthood, so did the sons of warrior nobility. The central feature of &quot;genpuku&quot; throughout this time period was the placing of a samurai helmet, rather than court cap, by a high status warrior. Adult samurai received their swords and armor at this time. After going through &quot;genpuku&quot;, youths were expected to do adult labor, and samurai-class men acquired full warrior status and were expected to fight in open battle. In addition, youths gained the right to marry, and to officiate at shrine ceremonies. The ceremony acted to bind youth to the previously mentioned high status warrior. Often this practice was used to confirm and solidify the social status of samurai families. For example, a samurai family of lower status might, through the ceremony of &quot;genpuku&quot;, become tied to a higher status family. The lower status son would then act as a retainer to the higher status warrior to whom he was tied. After &quot;genpuku&quot;, warrior sons were accepted as full adults and welcomed to a career in the warrior-administration.

The average age of &quot;genpuku&quot; varied over time. For example, throughout the Tokugawa period (1603–1868), the age at which children underwent &quot;genpuku&quot; depended upon whether there was unrest. Full-fledged warriors were expected to take part in battle, so during the unsettled first years of the Tokugawa period, parents delayed &quot;genpuku&quot; until their sons were full-grown, at around 20 years old. However, as the country became more peaceful, a transition period resembling adolescence emerged. Young boys underwent &quot;genpuku&quot; and trained to be warriors under an older warrior, but did not engage in war. War acted as a sort of consummation following &quot;genpuku&quot;, solidifying societal acknowledgement of full adult warrior status. As the long peace continued, the appropriate age to transition from child to adult was lowered in response to dynastic pressures to marry and produce heirs. Boys could not marry until they came of age, so the &quot;adolescent phase&quot; vanished. By the 1700s the average coming of age of samurai-class boys was at 15 to 17, and in the early to mid-1800s it dropped to an average of 13 to 15.

==== Muromachi period (1338–1573) ====
During the Muromachi period, a period set within the Age of the Samurai, &quot;genpuku&quot; gradually spread from the samurai class to include men and women of lower ranks. Within the less wealthy, &quot;genpuku&quot; was used as a way of acknowledging an entrance into occupational roles, often in the form of apprenticeship. Boys of farming families and the artisan class came of age at 15 to 17, an age that had more to do with their ability to do adult work and take on adult social responsibilities than with their readiness for marriage or war. As a result of the new meanings tied to the ceremony and work, the once solid transitions between childhood and adulthood were lost within the artisan and merchant classes. Adulthood was put off in order that youth could acquire more or new skills related to their future occupations, resulting in the re-emergence of a period resembling adolescence.

===Warabi Town, 1946===
Today’s form of the Japanese Coming of Age Ceremony has roots from the Youth Festival held in Warabi Town (currently Warabi City), Kitaadachi County, Saitama Prefecture on November 22, 1946, shortly after Japan’s defeat in World War II. At the time, when Japan was in a state of despair due to the defeat, Shojiro Takahashi, then the leader of the Youth League of Warabi Town (later the mayor of Warabi City), hosted a youth festival in order to give hope and encouragement to the young people who would bear Japan&#x27;s future. The festival was held in a tent on the school grounds of Warabi First Elementary School (currently North Warabi Elementary School), which included the Adulthood Ceremony. This ceremony spread throughout the country and became the present Coming of Age Ceremony.

In Warabi City, it is still called the Adulthood Ceremony. On the Coming of Age Day in 1979, the city erected a monument to mark the birthplace of the Coming of Age Ceremony in Warabi Castle Site Park and commemorated the 20th anniversary of the promotion to a city and the 30th anniversary of the establishment of Coming of Age Day.

===The first holiday===
Inspired by Warabi’s youth festival, the Japanese government promulgated and enacted the National Holidays Law in 1948, to be held every year on January 15. The official holiday aimed &quot;to realise the passage from youth to adulthood, and to celebrate and encourage young people embarking on their adult lives&quot;.

In 1949, January 15 was designated as the Coming of Age Day to congratulate and exhort young people to become adults and live independently. Since then, the Coming of Age Ceremony has been held on this day in most regions of Japan. Later, with the 1998 revision of the National Holidays Law, the Coming of Age Day was moved to the second Monday of January in 2000. This amendment is called the Happy Monday System because it makes a long weekend (Saturday – Monday). In addition, according to a survey conducted around 2018, Nagoya City and Morotsuka Village in the Higashiusuki District, Miyazaki Prefecture also claim to be the birthplace of the Coming of Age Ceremony.

Japan&#x27;s low birth rate and shrinking percentage of young people, coupled with disruptions to some ceremonies in recent years (such as an incident in Naha in 2002, when drunken Japanese youths tried to disrupt the festivities) and a general increase in the number of 20-year-olds who do not feel themselves to be adults have led to decreased attendance of the ceremonies, which has caused some concern among older Japanese. In 2012, the decline continued for the fifth year in a row, with a total of 1.22 million adults celebrating the holiday in 2012 – under half of the participants seen at its peak in 1976, when 2.76 million adults attended ceremonies. This was the first time it has declined below the 50% threshold. Japan lowered the age of adulthood in 2018 from 20 years of age to 18 which took effect in 2022. This change has caused confusion on the status of the holiday, and raised concerns among the kimono industry which profits from the garments worn during the ceremonies.

==Ceremonies==
 mark one&#x27;s ending of coming of age (age of maturity), which reflects both the expanded rights but also increased responsibilities expected of new adults. The ceremonies are generally held in the morning at local city offices throughout Japan. All young adults who turned or will turn 18 between April 2 of the previous year and April 1 of the current one and who maintain residency in the area are invited to attend. Government officials give speeches, and small presents are handed out to the newly recognized adults.

During the ceremony, guest speakers give lectures, and commemorative gifts are presented. It is not sponsored by the Japanese government but by each municipality independently. Therefore, although the school-age system, which determines the eligibility for participation, is the same everywhere, some municipalities hold the event on days other than the Coming of Age Day. The age of adulthood was lowered from 20 to 18 on April 1, 2022. However, some municipalities continue to set the age eligible for participating in the ceremony at 20, while others have lowered it to 18.

Many women celebrate this day by wearing &quot;furisode&quot;, a style of &quot;kimono&quot; with long sleeves that hang down, and &quot;zōri&quot; sandals. Since most are unable to put on a &quot;kimono&quot; by themselves due to the intricacies involved, many choose to visit a beauty salon to dress and to set their hair. A full set of formal clothing is expensive, so it is usually either borrowed from a relative or rented rather than bought especially for the occasion. Men sometimes also wear traditional dress (e.g. dark &quot;kimono&quot; with &quot;hakama&quot;), but nowadays many men wear formal Western clothes such as a suit and tie more often than the traditional &quot;hakama&quot;. After the ceremony, the young adults often celebrate in groups by going to parties or going out drinking.

The ceremony often takes place in the city hall or school&#x27;s gyms. There are some special cases such as the ceremony having been held at Tokyo Disneyland since 2002.

===Date ===
The ceremony is commonly held on the Coming of Age Day, but there are regional variations. Some municipalities hold it during Golden Week (a week from late April to early May when Japanese holidays follow one after another), Obon (days to honor one&#x27;s ancestors), or January 1–3. For example, in Niigata prefecture in 2017, no city held it on the Coming of Age Day (January 8); two were on January 7, and all others were during March, April, May, or August. It is because these areas have high snowfall, and many young people are out of town and do not come back until Golden Week or Obon. Many ceremonies were canceled or postponed in 1989 due to the death of the Emperor, and in 2020 due to the Corona pandemic.

=== Eligibility ===
Initially, eligible people to participate in the Coming of Age Ceremony were those with birthdays between the day after the Coming of Age Day of the previous year and that of the current year. So for the Ceremony held on January 15, 1999, participants must have been born after January 15, 1980 (19 years ago), until January 14, 1981 (18 years ago). However, recently (especially since the introduction of the Happy Monday System), the school-age system has become more common. In the Japanese school system, a grade consists of students born between April 2 of a year and April 1 of the subsequent year. Today, those who legally become adults between April of the previous year and March of the current year are eligible to participate in the ceremony.

This new practice caused a problem. If the eligibility for the Coming of Age Ceremony is based on the school age, those born after the Coming of Age Day and before April 2 must attend the Ceremony a year later than their peers. Consequently, they can find fewer friends to celebrate with at the Ceremony.
Due to the Happy Monday system, there were some people who were still 19 years old at the Coming of Age Ceremony for the year, but they would become 21 years old at the Ceremony of the following year. For example, as shown in the January 2001 calendar, a person born on the second Monday, January 12, 1981 was still 19 years old on the Coming of Age Day (January 8, 2001), but the same person became 21 years old on the Day in 2002. The same problem occurred for those born between January 10–13 in 1992 and January 9–13 in 1998.

Additionally, in Sapporo City, Hokkaido and Hiroshima City, Hiroshima Prefecture, the calendar year system was used in which those who reached their 20th birthday between January 1 and December 31 of the past year were eligible to participate in the Coming of Age Ceremony. This system has been switched to the school-age system since 2000, however.

Until the 1960s, more than half of the new adults were working youths who had already entered society. However, since the 1970s, the number of students entering universities and vocational schools has increased, while the number of junior high school and high school graduates finding employment has decreased. Consequently, the ratio of students (rather than working youth) to all new adults has been increasing year by year.

The Statistics Bureau of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications estimated the population of new adults in January 2020 to be 1.22 million. Its percentage in comparison to the total population had been below 1% for 10 consecutive years. The participation of people from other countries, such as technical intern trainees and international students, has also been increasing. In 2020, Shiogama City, Miyagi Prefecture sent out invitations in Indonesian, Vietnamese, English, and Easy Japanese. The city had 30 foreign-born participants in 2019, about 6% of the total participating adults.

=== Business ===
In recent years, fewer Japanese people have worn kimonos. Since many participants wear expensive kimonos for the Ceremony, the kimono industry promote kimonos. However, because kimonos are so expensive, many participants end up renting them or using those handed down from their mothers.

The Ceremony is also a good opportunity for the beauty industry, which dresses, makes up, and hairdos for the attendees. They host makeup workshops for those who begin wearing makeup earnestly and sell cosmetic products. Even photo studios, where attendees take commemorative pictures after being decorously dressed, will focus on advertising. Competition for customers has become zealous in related businesses.

In 2018, Harenohi, a company that sells furisode (long-sleeved kimono) in Yokohama and other cities, abruptly shut down its business on January 8, the Coming of Age Ceremony day. This incident caused an uproar because those who had made reservations to purchase or rent a furisode from the company were unable to wear it, and some had to cancel their participation in the Ceremony.

=== Problems ===
According to the public opinion survey conducted by the Yokohama City Board of Education in March 2004, among minors, new adults, and people in their 20s, approximately 20% to 30% viewed the Coming of Age Ceremony as an event like a reunion where friends meet again. Furthermore, 20% of the women in their 20s or younger responded that the Ceremony is an event where new adults meet in formal suits and festive clothes. This result suggests that the event’s purpose and the target group’s expectations are divergent.

In this survey, 82.7% of high school students and minors said that they wanted to participate in the Ceremony, while 17.2% said they did not. Among high school students and minors, the most common reason for not participating was “not interested in the content,” at 36.8%. While more than 50% of high school students, minors, and new adults answered that attractions such as concerts by singers were necessary, half of them also answered that introductions of guests such as mayors and politicians were unnecessary. The Yokohama City’s proposal determines that such components make the Ceremony lengthy and impoverish the content.

==Risshi-shiki==
 is a ceremony held in school for students who have turned 15 years of age; literally &quot;establishing aspirations ceremony,&quot; in which children stand in front of the school and declare their goals for the future.

==Notes==
* In premodern Japan, ages 15, 16, 17, etc. corresponded roughly with modern Japanese and Western ages 14, 15, 16, etc. The average age of genpuku was therefore 15 to 18 in premodern Japanese reckoning, and 14 to 17 in modern reckoning.

<text>Zori (), also rendered as zōri (, ), are thonged Japanese sandals made of rice straw, cloth, lacquered wood, leather, rubber, or—most commonly and informally—synthetic materials. They are a slip-on descendant of the tied-on sandal.

Similar in form, modern flip-flops became popular in the United States, Australia and New Zealand when soldiers returning from World War II brought Japanese zori with them.

==Use==
Like many Japanese sandals, zori are easily slipped on and off, which is important in Japan, where shoes are removed and put back on when entering and leaving a house, and where tying shoelaces would be impractical when wearing traditional clothing.

The traditional forms of zori are seen when worn with other traditional clothing. Modern forms are fairly common, however, with casual Western wear, especially in summer. While geta are now mostly worn with the informal , traditional zori are often worn with the more formal kimono.

In rain, zori may be worn with toe covers ( zori).

==Materials==
The zori originated as a slip-on form of the tie-on . In the Edo period (1603-1867), the production of zori became professionalized, and a variety of fancy types of zori emerged, using fancier materials. While zori were still commonly woven of rice straw ( , literally &quot;straw zori&quot;), rushes of various kinds and bamboo sheath were also used. If they were made of something less cheap than rice straw, an extra outsole was often sewn on. This could be made of coiled hemp rope (), wisteria stems, (), or wood in lateral strips ( or ). Leather soles were used on . In modern times, polyurethane and cork are used as outsoles.

Zori also have a variety of upper surfaces. Zori with a woven wicker covering are referred to as If it is woven of rice straw (as above), they are . If they are woven on the same four-warp pattern, but using a weft of bamboo sheath (peelings of bamboo culms), they are zori, literally bamboo-skin zori. The topsole may also be woven of common rush (). This is the material used for most tatami mats, and are also woven on the same many-warp pattern as tatami.

Raffia, rattan, and paper strips (treated and twisted to resemble rush) are also used in topsoles. Some soles are skiamorphic moldings that look like woven topsoles. Topsoles might also be made of cloth, leather, vinyl cloth, or EVA foam. Soles made entirely of waterproof (usually synthetic) materials are called zori, literally rain-soled zori. Elastomer zori are called .

Wrapping straw straps with cloth makes the zori into (cloth zori, ) Modern zori are usually made with the straps as a separate piece, not woven at the same time as the sole.


The are the straps holding the sole to the foot; the part that should fit loosely between the toes is the , and the side-straps are the . , like zori soles, are traditionally symmetrical, with no difference between left and right, though some designs diverge from this.

The of informal zori can be made of a velour-like material, as is often the case for zori. The of more formal colored vinyl zori are either vinyl or fabric straps. The fabric is often either the fabric used for the shoe, or (a type of Japanese crepe, of silk or rayon), or cotton, often with a different, softer fabric underneath. Men&#x27;s zori may also feature leather or leather imitation .

Traditionally, are adjusted to the wearer, being tied through three holes by strings attached to the straps. can wear and stretch easily; in such instances, the can be adjusted or replaced through small flaps in the soles, which conceal the knots that hold them in place. In other instances, however, the can be entirely inaccessible, requiring the glued sole to be split open, or entire shoe to be replaced.

==Varieties and formalities==

Both the gender of the wearer and the formality of the occasion affects the choice of zori. Regardless of variety, zori are almost always worn with socks.

Women&#x27;s zori are seldom flat, save for zori. The soles come in different thicknesses and angles, and are typically covered by vinyl or fabric, though some modern varieties feature a hard black plastic sole with a non-slip base. In contrast, men&#x27;s zori almost always feature a flat sole.

Zori with a woven wicker covering are referred to as zori are generally considered to be relatively formal zori, even if the covering is a vinyl imitation of a woven bamboo-sheath cover. Though most zori with a cover are considered to be menswear - known as - traditional women&#x27;s footwear with a cover also exist, though these are generally confined to the variety of geta. In contrast, zori are more modern, and are not worn with kimono, but are considered working wear or are sometimes matched with casual Western or Japanese clothing. These zori more closely resemble a flat sandal with a woven base.

Setta were historically mostly , but , they were often ; they were also increasingly likely to have coloured and patterned straps.

Vinyl or plastic zori are next in formality. They are worn with formal clothing such as a semi-formal kimono. The most formal variety of zori are generally worn by women; they are brocade covered zori that are used with the most formal of kimono, such as wedding and funeral wear.

The , or thongs, may be white or black, depending on the occasion; white are worn with formal zori, with black considered to be informal. They may also complement the colour of the garment. Black, white, and red are traditional and commonly mass-produced, but colourful with a variety of patterns, sometimes chosen separately from the zori, are also popular.
